[48:19] may you come Lord and do all things Lord
[48:21] For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name
[48:23] amen God bless you friends you can have
[48:25] your seats this morning
[48:27] I mean so I want to talk about the power
[48:29] in God's pardon and Grace
[48:31] so there's power in his pardoning grace
[48:33] this morning I want to speak about that
[48:35] you know there's just something that
[48:37] happens to a Believer when they
[48:38] experience God's pardoning grace I'm
[48:40] going to use that phrase there's power
[48:41] in it right as we read in Leviticus 25
[48:44] ye shall return every man to his
[48:46] possession so there was a law in that
[48:48] Year of Jubilee where where where every
[48:51] 50 at the end the Jubilee trumpet was
[48:53] sounded it would be tied and with the
[48:54] atonement as we read and there was a law
[48:56] in that that every man had to go free if
[48:59] they wanted to go free so so it wasn't a
[49:02] suggestion but there was power in that
[49:04] Jubilee or in that pardon that that
[49:07] whatever caused them to to end up in
[49:09] slavery they didn't have to stay in that
[49:10] slavery where they could walk free you
[49:13] know many times they um sometimes they
[49:15] would actually sell themselves into
[49:16] slavery because of debt they couldn't
[49:18] pay a debt so they tried to work off
[49:20] that debt and different things but they
[49:21] couldn't they couldn't free themselves
[49:23] but but God in his great Mercy would
[49:26] pardon them of their transgressions and
[49:29] this is a shadow of what the Lord would
[49:30] do in our day because this was the
[49:31] natural law and this is a natural man
[49:34] shall return you know ye shall return
[49:35] every man to his possession so it was
[49:38] the responsibility of man to restore
[49:40] someone who was in slavery back to their
[49:42] possession now that's just a natural law
[49:44] now how much more under the blood of
[49:45] Jesus Christ now where where it's not
[49:48] man enforcing the word but it's God
[49:50] himself enforcing his own word where a
[49:52] jubilee Trumpet of the Gospel has
[49:54] sounded in this day and everyone who
[49:56] chooses to hear it and receive it can go
[49:58] free back to their possession praise the
[50:00] Lord so back to something that they had
[50:02] in the beginning you know when someone
[50:04] returns to something they return to
[50:06] something that they already had right
[50:07] you never return to something you never
[50:09] had in the beginning that would be going
[50:10] to get something new but we are
[50:12] returning back to what we originally had
[50:14] amen as the Sons and Daughters of God
[50:17] Amen as Adam's Fallen race it has been
[50:20] redeemed we return back to godship over
[50:22] the Earth amen back to dominion over
[50:24] Satan over hell every work of the flesh
[50:26] amen we have dominion by the blood of
[50:28] Jesus Christ over all these things and
[50:30] we have a possession that we have been
[50:32] called to return to amen but I'm so
[50:34] thankful it's God's power that returns
[50:36] us to this Hallelujah yo David would say
[50:39] in the Psalms blessed is the man to whom
[50:41] God will not impute sin you know you
[50:43] think about the you know something
[50:44] happens to a Believer when they really
[50:45] experience God's pardoning grace when
[50:48] it's more than something that comes
[50:49] comes into your ears but it's an
[50:51] experience Where You Realize by
[50:52] Revelation you have been pardoned that
[50:55] it's not you trying to be part of not
[50:56] try you trying to earn the pardon of God
[50:58] but you receive it amen you see The
[51:01] Power Within it amen and it moves you it
[51:02] changes your life it changes your
[51:05] attitude towards one another you cannot
[51:06] be the same person I mean when you've
[51:08] been pardoned by the blood you cannot be
[51:10] the same person you cannot have the same
[51:12] attitude you cannot be condescending you
[51:14] can't degrade no one no if you receive
[51:16] Grace you can give Grace but if you've
[51:19] never received the grace of God you
[51:21] cannot impart it to someone else it's
[51:22] impossible because only something that
[51:24] has been received can be given
[51:27] Hallelujah say it's a blessed is the man
[51:29] to whom God will not impute sin amen so
[51:31] we're a blessed people today Hallelujah
[51:34] we can Rejoice today because God has
[51:35] chosen not to impute our sin Upon Us
[51:39] amen but he imputed on thee on the
[51:41] originator of sin which was the devil
[51:43] that perverted righteousness and brought
[51:44] sin into the world allowed it to come in
[51:46] amen he is the beginning of it remember
[51:48] sin started in heaven in the in the
[51:50] heart of Lucifer that's where sin
[51:52] started didn't start in the garden it
[51:53] started in heaven amen so now you know
[51:56] there's something when we can just look
[51:58] how we because the Bible would say that
[52:00] he became sin whom you know sin that
[52:02] will become the very righteousness of
[52:04] God in Christ so when you think about
[52:06] hell out no one we could never we could
[52:08] never earn the pardon we couldn't do it
[52:12] no one could ever do it you know the law
[52:14] was actually designed in a way for man
[52:16] to realize he could never keep it you
[52:18] know if the law was able to be kept then
[52:20] Jesus did not need to die Amen to
[52:22] release his holy ghost upon the Earth to
[52:24] change the people's nature from a sin
[52:26] nature to a nature of Faith see it's
[52:28] impossible to to obtain righteousness in
[52:31] our own ability we have to come to that
[52:33] point well we cannot do it in our own
[52:35] strength man has always tried Amen to
[52:37] earn his place with God but that's not
[52:39] how God works that's not how the plan of
[52:41] God works no God earns your place with
[52:44] him amen that's what he did that down
[52:46] Calvary it was his atonement that lifted
[52:49] us up into our position with him it's
[52:51] not our own ability we cannot earn our
[52:53] our Salvation this may be very
[52:55] Elementary at first but there's power
[52:57] within the pardon to move you
[52:59] it moves you to a place
[53:01] Hallelujah Amen brother I'm saying loud
[53:04] now look but God foresaw the bride in
[53:06] the groom Hallelujah see to save his
[53:08] wife like Adam he had to go with her
[53:10] Adam knew what he was doing Eve didn't
[53:12] know what she was doing but Adam walked
[53:14] out with his wife see and Jesus took his
[53:16] wife's place and became sin for her
[53:18] remember he became you he stood your
[53:20] punishment that you might stand in his
[53:22] place he stood in your place that you
[53:24] might stand in his place he says what a
[53:26] love what a fellowship how can we deny
[53:28] it how can we do anything but love him
[53:30] friend I could stand there for hours but
[53:32] let's move a little farther like the
[53:34] Pentecostal experience today and the
[53:35] coming of the Holy Ghost in This last
[53:37] days as promised is like the abstract
[53:39] tour title deed see now now you get a
[53:43] title so so if you want to buy a piece
[53:44] of property you get the title to that
[53:46] property but an abstract deed means
[53:48] there's been a title search and no and
[53:50] everyone's claims on that title has been
[53:52] struck off so you have a right to
[53:53] possess the promise so now now you think
[53:56] how great our pardon is today that every
[53:59] claim the devil has on our lives has
[54:01] been struck off by the blood of Jesus
[54:02] Christ I mean it doesn't matter what
[54:04] what what your forebe is dead what
[54:06] Spirits are in your family whatever
[54:08] whatever Fallen traits you have your sin
[54:10] nature doesn't matter what they have
[54:12] done what you have done when the blood
[54:13] is really applied that's all struck off
[54:15] your life that you're free indeed amen
[54:17] there's no the devil has no claim on the
[54:19] believer just like Jesus would say I
[54:21] have no part in the devil the devil has
[54:23] no part in me Hallelujah so we can stand
[54:25] amen because remember he took our
[54:28] punishment that we might stand in his
[54:29] place amen what a love that is if we can
[54:32] really look at this part and that he's
[54:33] given us this morning I mean I believe
[54:35] it would change our lives I mean I
[54:37] believe it would revolutionize our walk
[54:38] amen it would revolutionize our thinking
[54:42] Hallelujah
[54:43] amen because when an abstract search is
[54:45] done it searches all the way back to the
[54:47] everything struck off plumbed back from
[54:49] the foundations there is no claim that's
[54:52] able to be made when that abstract
[54:54] search is done and all the claims have
[54:55] been struck off amen it's the same thing
[54:57] with us I don't care what you've done
[54:59] where you've been what you've said
[55:00] things you've willingly done in sin God
[55:03] strikes that off you when the blood of
[55:05] Jesus Christ comes into your life
[55:07] doesn't matter what you've done you say
[55:08] I've gone too far though there's nowhere
[55:10] too far that someone cannot can go that
[55:12] God can't get them amen Lazarus was four
[55:15] days in the grave and God reached down
[55:17] he says I'm the resurrection and the
[55:19] life resurrected a dead man riding in
[55:21] the grave and brought him back so no
[55:23] cases too far the devil will say you've
[55:25] gone too far but you say hold on you're
[55:27] not my God God is my God you're just the
[55:29] accusation you've been cast down I'm not
[55:31] listening to your voice anymore
[55:33] Hallelujah everything that the devil
[55:35] would try and hold against us is struck
[55:36] off but you've got to believe the power
[55:38] of the pardon you're going to believe it
[55:40] does that amen I could I could you know
[55:42] I could you know know I don't have the
[55:44] vocabulary this morning to really give
[55:45] it to you but but you've got to believe
[55:47] it's the there's power within it I mean
[55:50] because if you really believe there's
[55:51] power within it then you can walk in
[55:52] that power amen all the way out into
[55:55] your possession amen so it's an abstract
[55:58] that everything against you doesn't
[55:59] matter whether your mother did it your
[56:00] father your grandmother it doesn't
[56:02] matter amen it's just like the little
[56:04] epileptic child I prayed for this is
[56:05] Brother Brown he says a few minutes ago
[56:07] that came that came from the
[56:09] grandparents that epilepsy fell down
[56:10] upon that child but when the abstract
[56:13] has come it's struck off omitted
[56:15] everything I'm an abstract holder then
[56:17] amen and it sure is a spirit that raised
[56:18] Christ from the dead I have an abstract
[56:20] deed that I'm part of that body
[56:22] with the abstract of the Holy Ghost
[56:24] making that body of word live out
[56:26] exactly like it did in him as he
[56:28] promised in the last days the abstract
[56:29] my sins are all struck out your sins are
[56:32] all struck out by the blood of Jesus
[56:33] Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as an
[56:36] abstract to the title thee that God Gave
[56:37] Me by Grace by foreknowledge oh my so he
[56:40] looked down through Time by four
[56:41] knowledge and saw you and said that's a
[56:43] that's a title deed hold on I've got
[56:45] I've got to take a make an abstract
[56:47] search on that person and take it all
[56:48] away Hallelujah so how powerful that is
[56:51] you know when we read about you know and
[56:53] and um you know there is nothing
[56:55] negative about Christianity
[56:57] the devil will try and say these
[56:59] negative things you can't do this you
[57:01] can't go here you can't say this you
[57:02] can't act like those people he tries to
[57:04] make it like a negative thing but
[57:05] there's nothing negative about
[57:06] Christianity I mean Christianity is all
[57:09] positive hallelujah what do you mean
[57:11] that I don't have to walk by the spirit
[57:13] of the devil of this world I can walk
[57:15] free with God how's that a negative
[57:17] thing Hallelujah there's nothing
[57:19] negative about about the lord it's all
[57:22] positive Christianity
[57:24] eternal life there's nothing negative to
[57:26] it it's everything's absolutely positive
[57:28] a man that becomes a child of God has a
[57:31] positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has
[57:34] a positive hold on him with the
[57:36] Assurance by almighty God by an oath to
[57:38] himself that he will raise him up in the
[57:40] last day and take him to glory and it's
[57:42] not an if and and or nothing it's
[57:44] something that's positive amen so it's
[57:47] not something that's a Ayah I hope I'm
[57:48] going to be raised up in the last day no
[57:50] the Lord gives an assurance amen you're
[57:52] going to go as sure as there's the
[57:54] people that's going to go I mean because
[57:56] remember the Rapture is a revelation
[57:58] amen it's more than a teaching it's a
[58:00] revelation an individual Revelation that
[58:02] God puts in the hearts of the people
[58:03] amen that they are going to go in a
[58:05] translation they're not going to go into
[58:07] the Great Tribulation they're going to
[58:08] go to the wedding supper in the sky and
[58:10] but that's how powerful our pardon is
[58:12] amen remember remember in this day is
[58:15] when the Capstone of the Lord himself
[58:16] would come upon the church and when
[58:18] Zechariah saw that there was there are
[58:20] shoutings of Grace Grace Under The
[58:22] Headstone under the Capstone why because
[58:24] there's a great grace in this day sure
[58:26] there's a lot of darkness in this day of
[58:28] the devil but but God's grace his power
[58:30] is always greater than the enemy he's
[58:31] always the greater than it's never equal
[58:34] God is always greater than anything the
[58:36] devil can do amen so there's actually
[58:38] great grace Upon Our Lives
[58:40] Hallelujah you say well I don't feel a
[58:42] lot of Grace but look you're here this
[58:44] morning you're still a Believer amen
[58:46] You're Still Loving the Lord you're
[58:47] still walking with him amen that's a
[58:49] manifest manifestation of his grace
[58:52] Hallelujah
[58:53] praise the Lord see it's all positive
[58:56] amen as as the Apostle Paul would say in
[58:59] Hebrews 2 he says for as much sin as the
[59:01] children are partakers of Flesh and
[59:03] Blood he also himself took uh likewise
[59:06] took part of the same that through death
[59:08] he might destroy him that had the power
[59:11] of death that is the devil and deliver
[59:13] them who through fear of death for all
[59:16] their lifetimes subject to bondage
[59:19] so he would not just destroy the works
[59:20] of the devil or destroy the Devil but he
[59:23] would deliver us
[59:25] who that through the fear of death where
[59:26] all our lives bondage to it I'm just
[59:29] changing the words around so now when
[59:31] the pardon comes there's no fear of
[59:33] death
[59:34] as as brother Ron Spencer says death is
[59:36] just a travel bus to get me to where I
[59:38] want to go
[59:41] Hallelujah that's really all death is
[59:43] death death sure it's it's a painful
[59:46] thing to bury loved ones don't get me
[59:47] wrong you know it's a sad thing to have
[59:49] that separation but but for a Believer
[59:51] we just realized it'll just be a few
[59:53] moments you know you can look back in
[59:55] your life whatever years you're up to
[59:56] you think where did all the time go it
[59:58] just it just went like that and it'll be
[1:00:00] the same thing when we see the dead in
[1:00:01] Christ Rays our loved ones come forth
[1:00:03] it'll just be a few moments
[1:00:06] Hallelujah but you see death CeCe where
[1:00:08] those who have received his pardon and
[1:00:10] grace are not under the fear of death
[1:00:12] anymore
[1:00:14] Hallelujah I trust you don't you know
[1:00:16] this is not bravado there's a fear is
[1:00:17] taken out of your life because that fear
[1:00:20] is where am I going when when my heart
[1:00:22] stops beating where am I going to go but
[1:00:24] when he gives the Assurance I made a way
[1:00:26] for you
[1:00:27] and and and I've changed your life by my
[1:00:30] Holy Spirit I've given you the assurance
[1:00:31] I've given you an abstract deed in your
[1:00:33] soul you can just praise God hallelujah
[1:00:36] I trust you feel that way this morning
[1:00:38] amen that we are not afraid of this this
[1:00:41] welcome fall apart it will but we stand
[1:00:44] as sure as sure as sure why because it's
[1:00:46] not us holding ourselves as God holding
[1:00:48] us amen when you realize that this one
[1:00:51] who gave the pardon is the pardon and he
[1:00:53] enforces that same part of in your life
[1:00:55] he enforces word in your life you can
[1:00:57] just rest and praise God hallelujah
[1:01:00] praise the Lord if I get happy while I'm
[1:01:02] happy okay hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:01:05] see it's such this see this pardon is
[1:01:07] such a positive such a positive token
[1:01:10] such a positive Assurance amen it is
[1:01:13] such a positive thing it's not a hope so
[1:01:15] or maybe it's a positive it's an
[1:01:17] assurance that you know that you know
[1:01:19] that you know that you know him why
[1:01:21] because he first loved you he died for
[1:01:24] you on Calvary that's why you'll hear
[1:01:25] the swan you're gonna think you're not
[1:01:26] here haphazardly amen we're not here by
[1:01:28] chance just well let's just well these
[1:01:30] people are nice I'll just join this
[1:01:32] group it's got nothing to do with it no
[1:01:34] the Lord calls us to himself to his word
[1:01:36] and we walk with him hallelujah it's got
[1:01:39] nothing to do with these four walls just
[1:01:40] know the Lord calling you and you're
[1:01:42] receiving his pardon
[1:01:44] Hallelujah brother Ram says that the
[1:01:46] guarantee of that token makes you feel
[1:01:48] so relaxed not lacks relaxed
[1:01:53] all tension goes when it comes to you
[1:01:56] and God all the tension's gone you just
[1:01:58] let off the pressure you just Rejoice
[1:02:00] You Can Dance all the way laugh all the
[1:02:02] way to the bank as the saying goes
[1:02:05] why because he settled your account
[1:02:08] holy that's what the pardon does he
[1:02:10] settles your account we could not pay
[1:02:12] for our own sins
[1:02:14] that's why he had to come
[1:02:16] and purchase our salvation
[1:02:18] it makes you feel so relaxed I mean we
[1:02:21] can rest in his goodness believing He'll
[1:02:23] Do It Again
[1:02:25] amen remember he didn't stop being God
[1:02:27] he didn't quit being God when when the
[1:02:29] when the calendar went to 2023 he's the
[1:02:31] same God today as he was back then I met
[1:02:34] exactly the same in character and action
[1:02:36] indeed every and power everything is
[1:02:38] he's the same today hallelujah amen he's
[1:02:41] the same yesterday today and forever but
[1:02:43] you see when you receive this part and
[1:02:45] you cannot treat everyone the same again
[1:02:48] you could not treat people carnally
[1:02:51] when you receive his pardoning grace
[1:02:53] then you can extend it to others and you
[1:02:56] cannot fight carnal with carnal as my
[1:02:59] wife says you can't fight carnal with
[1:03:01] carnal but if you have this you know if
[1:03:03] you really have the pardon you won't
[1:03:04] fight carnal with carnal amen you don't
[1:03:07] know you'll you you'll try and stay in a
[1:03:10] spiritual way
[1:03:11] see because the devil wants to drag us
[1:03:13] down to fussing and fighting an argument
[1:03:15] and resentment and building walls and
[1:03:17] bunkers we're not here in the bunker
[1:03:19] building business
[1:03:20] right this is not what we're here to do
[1:03:22] we're here to walk free in God's
[1:03:23] goodness amen I've been so so my parents
[1:03:27] used to live in Papua New Guinea as you
[1:03:28] know and where they live the Japanese
[1:03:30] had their headquarters in World War II
[1:03:32] and I've been in Admiral Yamamoto who's
[1:03:34] a Japanese leader of the forces in that
[1:03:36] area I've been in his bunker
[1:03:38] it's it's the roof is lower than this
[1:03:41] it's smaller than this room
[1:03:44] it's not a nice place you go outside
[1:03:46] tropical green beautiful you go on this
[1:03:50] bunker concrete dark dingy we're not
[1:03:54] here building bunkers
[1:03:56] so don't build a bunker of a complex and
[1:03:58] try and hide away come out of the bunker
[1:04:00] that's what the pardon does is a call
[1:04:03] come out of your pain come out of your
[1:04:05] hurt come out of your resentment your
[1:04:06] own forgiveness it's a bunker you're not
[1:04:08] meant to live in a Bunga amen we're not
[1:04:10] nocturnal creatures or some fish down in
[1:04:13] the bottom of the ocean where there's no
[1:04:14] sunlight come up where the sun is
[1:04:15] shining Hallelujah that's what the
[1:04:17] pardon does amen
[1:04:19] praise God Amen so we can't be justified
[1:04:22] in being carnal just because someone
[1:04:23] said something bad about you
[1:04:25] that is that is just you're just being
[1:04:27] dragged down to that spirit's level not
[1:04:29] that person's level that spirit's level
[1:04:31] we'd ever want to become countries
[1:04:33] because people say bad things about us
[1:04:35] if we want to be like Jesus we want to
[1:04:37] be the same to everyone
[1:04:39] hey people said a lot of bad things
[1:04:40] about him he didn't start getting carnal
[1:04:42] you know like the disciples you know
[1:04:44] there's one Village they wouldn't give
[1:04:46] them food they said can we call fire
[1:04:48] down from heaven burn them all up what
[1:04:50] that was the disciples righteous
[1:04:52] indignation just their carnality rising
[1:04:54] up let's burn this whole place up and
[1:04:56] Jesus said you don't understand what
[1:04:58] what Spirit we're off you know you're
[1:05:01] trying to be carnal boys you're trying
[1:05:02] to be spiritual but cuddle at the same
[1:05:04] time and look what it's going to do you
[1:05:05] just want to kill a bunch of people no
[1:05:07] that's no no see they had a lot to learn
[1:05:09] they had to go to Pentecost that's how
[1:05:11] they had to learn Amen to really
[1:05:13] received the receive the Holy Ghost see
[1:05:15] if you've always got trouble with other
[1:05:17] people's problems and fussing then
[1:05:19] you've got to ask yourself have you
[1:05:20] received the pardon you've really got to
[1:05:22] ask yourself that question if if your
[1:05:25] order of the day is some grudge match
[1:05:26] with someone and you're fussing and
[1:05:28] fighting and arguing this thing and this
[1:05:30] person this person and your memory is
[1:05:31] just full of those things have you
[1:05:33] really received the pardon because
[1:05:35] remember the pardon himself said father
[1:05:38] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:05:39] do he didn't carry you know he was
[1:05:41] acquainted with grief he bore our
[1:05:43] sorrows but he didn't carry grudges and
[1:05:45] pain and resentment and unforgiveness he
[1:05:47] didn't carry those things and we want to
[1:05:48] be like Jesus amen so you've got to read
[1:05:51] ourselves have you really received the
[1:05:52] pardon of your if you're always acting
[1:05:55] that way see the Apostle Paul before he
[1:05:57] received the pardon man he was he was an
[1:05:59] angry guy
[1:06:00] he was he he had a vendetta against
[1:06:02] these these these Christians this cult
[1:06:06] he was all our out against it but you
[1:06:08] see now but something something happened
[1:06:10] to the Apostle Paul on the roads of
[1:06:11] Damascus he received the pardon
[1:06:14] because he met him
[1:06:15] I mean brothers and children of Israel
[1:06:17] sometimes I feel like the runaway slave
[1:06:19] when Paul found him he wrote back to his
[1:06:21] master he said no no put all videos you
[1:06:24] put it on my bill and I'll pay it when I
[1:06:26] come when I think of that I think of
[1:06:27] Paul here that great Christian how did
[1:06:30] his heart knew that there was a great
[1:06:31] charge against him and Christ by his own
[1:06:34] blood wrote his pardon at the cross and
[1:06:36] took his place and he knowed how to feel
[1:06:39] for other people wouldn't it be
[1:06:40] wonderful if we all had that feeling he
[1:06:43] says this afternoon but this morning see
[1:06:45] see he could say that about that slave
[1:06:46] when he when he's running to the slave
[1:06:48] master saying saying put his put his put
[1:06:50] his what he owes on my bill because he
[1:06:52] realized someone far greater than him he
[1:06:54] had a far greater bill and the Lord
[1:06:56] Jesus Paid It On Calvary Hallelujah so
[1:06:58] so it gave him because he realized the
[1:07:00] Lord wrote by his own blood as pardon
[1:07:03] amen he knowed how to feel for other
[1:07:05] people do you know how to feel for other
[1:07:07] people this morning amen do you really
[1:07:09] can you really just say you know Lord
[1:07:11] don't lay this to their charge because
[1:07:13] you've received such a great pardon such
[1:07:16] an incredible pardon man didn't give you
[1:07:18] this pardon the preacher doesn't give
[1:07:19] you the part in government God himself
[1:07:21] says here's the pardon amen is something
[1:07:23] and he says I choose to receive that do
[1:07:25] you understand it no but I choose to
[1:07:27] receive it see it's always see it starts
[1:07:29] with a power of decision a power of
[1:07:31] choices like David here a couple of
[1:07:32] camps goes you decided right there that
[1:07:35] camp I want to serve you all day I don't
[1:07:36] want to put words in your mouth that's
[1:07:37] kind of what you prayed yep yep you and
[1:07:40] brother um Alpha was preaching that that
[1:07:43] evening so it started with a decision
[1:07:45] a decision
[1:07:47] and look where it's literally
[1:07:51] Hallelujah transform life see but it
[1:07:53] starts with a decision praise God we
[1:07:55] could dance around for the rest of the
[1:07:56] day Hallelujah this pardon Works
[1:07:59] Hallelujah
[1:08:02] praise the Lord but no it makes you know
[1:08:04] how to feel for other people well they
[1:08:06] should know better we should have known
[1:08:07] better
[1:08:08] we should have known better you know
[1:08:10] it's amazing the more you know you know
[1:08:12] Society thinks they can educate younger
[1:08:15] Generations out of drug taking
[1:08:17] y'all remember how the draft coming
[1:08:18] who's who's ever seen how the giraffes
[1:08:20] or kiwi because now come to the bus and
[1:08:22] house it don't do drugs kids and you
[1:08:24] know it says about what it does to your
[1:08:25] brain and your lungs and you know you
[1:08:26] know everything what it does
[1:08:28] does it stop anyone
[1:08:30] no so we should know better we should
[1:08:33] know better than to go into sin and go
[1:08:34] into trouble but and but you know and
[1:08:36] and and and we take that same attitude
[1:08:38] against one another well that that
[1:08:40] sister should know better that brother
[1:08:41] should know better you should have known
[1:08:42] better
[1:08:43] so why do you hold that against them if
[1:08:45] you should have known better be yet the
[1:08:47] Lord just forgave you
[1:08:49] he wrote pardon across your book
[1:08:51] hallelujah it's amazing you know you
[1:08:53] know brother Brown would have a um um he
[1:08:55] would he would encounter story when he
[1:08:57] went into a diner and there's this old
[1:08:58] lady about 65 or something all dressed
[1:09:01] up trying to get these men arms around
[1:09:02] them drinking and stuff in the middle of
[1:09:04] the day and you know he just saw the
[1:09:06] site that made him sick
[1:09:07] he's being honesty and you know he
[1:09:09] actually asked God God how can you stand
[1:09:11] and look upon sin like that how can you
[1:09:14] just let it go by see if it would make
[1:09:16] me a sinner saved by grace feel like
[1:09:18] that what would it do to you holy God
[1:09:21] you just destroy the thing see he's
[1:09:23] getting all this righteous ignation
[1:09:24] against this person hasn't been in their
[1:09:26] shoes doesn't understand why they're
[1:09:27] that way but just thinking because it
[1:09:29] grieved him so much he thinks God how
[1:09:31] can you stand this if I can't stand it
[1:09:33] how can you stand it you might just wipe
[1:09:34] the whole thing off but then the Lord
[1:09:36] showed him a vision
[1:09:37] see God always gives perspective
[1:09:40] God always gives perspective here he is
[1:09:42] with condemning this woman and these men
[1:09:44] you know playing there playing slot
[1:09:45] machines and gambling drinking all this
[1:09:47] stuff you know and then and and then he
[1:09:50] was so condemning to them in his heart
[1:09:51] then the Lord showed him a vision of the
[1:09:53] earth then there's like a Red Mist
[1:09:54] around the earth of the blood of Jesus
[1:09:56] Christ and there's the Lord on the cross
[1:09:57] and there was dark streaks were coming
[1:09:59] and hitting him like he says like a car
[1:10:01] bumper like he's being hit by a car and
[1:10:04] it was sin hitting him and it was his
[1:10:05] sins
[1:10:06] and then he saw that and they began to
[1:10:09] cry out he says my God have I caused
[1:10:11] that to you and then and then and then
[1:10:13] he looked and he said you know he saw
[1:10:16] those black streaks and they were and
[1:10:17] they were going into a book that had his
[1:10:19] name across the top of it and he says
[1:10:21] Lord Jesus forgive me and the Lord Jesus
[1:10:24] took his blood and his finger pardoned
[1:10:26] across the book thrown to the Caesars
[1:10:27] sea of his forgetfulness and he just
[1:10:30] started saying oh Lord I really love you
[1:10:31] for that but the Lord said but I forgave
[1:10:33] you but you want to blow her up
[1:10:36] and that changed that changed his whole
[1:10:38] attitude towards her because he's
[1:10:41] rejoicing thank God I'm pardon but yet
[1:10:43] he's condemning this woman
[1:10:44] right and then so he actually started to
[1:10:46] talk to her about this and everything
[1:10:48] and she began to open up about her life
[1:10:49] and he led her to the Lord in that Diner
[1:10:53] Hallelujah why because he realized he
[1:10:55] received such a great pardon but how he
[1:10:57] was responding to others wasn't
[1:10:58] according to the pardon he received see
[1:11:01] he was condemnings all this world that's
[1:11:02] so dark whatever no it's actually people
[1:11:04] like you and I are trapped in a cage of
[1:11:07] sin
[1:11:08] right and if they're in their right mind
[1:11:09] they'd want to get out of it but but
[1:11:11] many times it's pain it hurts it's
[1:11:13] insecurities lead people into those
[1:11:15] things and we look at them and say well
[1:11:16] this world's so dark and you know
[1:11:19] where's our pardon
[1:11:21] I'm not looking at anyone in particular
[1:11:23] okay just you know I'm just trying to
[1:11:25] look at everyone but don't think I'm
[1:11:27] just singling you out okay but where's
[1:11:29] our pardon where's our love for people
[1:11:33] out there and in here if we've been
[1:11:35] pardoned from everything and you say
[1:11:37] well it seems almost unfair you ask Lord
[1:11:39] forgive me he says okay done
[1:11:42] where's that gone it's in a sea of his
[1:11:44] forgetfulness hallelujah it's gone
[1:11:46] pardon washed in his blood you know some
[1:11:49] people think that's cheap Grace no it's
[1:11:51] not because we don't have to earn
[1:11:52] anything we just have to receive it
[1:11:55] Hallelujah see now I said how can we see
[1:11:59] see we want the Lord to forgive forgive
[1:12:01] us our sins but we want to blow people
[1:12:03] up
[1:12:04] something's got to happen in our lives
[1:12:07] we need the love of Jesus Christ more
[1:12:09] than ever in this day
[1:12:11] we need a bit of understanding
[1:12:13] but uh long suffering we've got to fill
[1:12:16] that tank up
[1:12:17] you know a bit of patience a bit of
[1:12:19] understanding we were there once we were
[1:12:22] there it took God years to get on our
[1:12:25] case
[1:12:25] you know we'd hear service after service
[1:12:27] and God will be working and God will be
[1:12:29] and we'd sit there and we'd think it's
[1:12:31] just going like this and not going in
[1:12:32] and you know but then but then we're on
[1:12:34] the other side there where God
[1:12:35] transforms us and we look at someone
[1:12:36] else saying why aren't they getting it
[1:12:38] but we forget it took us a long time to
[1:12:40] get it took a long time for us to let
[1:12:42] down our walls and let God start dealing
[1:12:44] so why are we so impatient with other
[1:12:45] people
[1:12:46] we should be we should be more patient
[1:12:49] you say Lord if you if you put up with a
[1:12:51] dummy like me Hallelujah God's got
[1:12:55] patience man he's got patience amen we
[1:12:57] need patience like his patients
[1:12:59] Hallelujah you see now if if if we want
[1:13:02] to see everyone blowing up or if we want
[1:13:04] to see
[1:13:05] if we want to be better than other
[1:13:07] people
[1:13:08] we want to push other people down in
[1:13:10] their Christian walk then something's
[1:13:11] happened to us and it's not a good thing
[1:13:14] Brother Band would say in the church in
[1:13:16] its condition he says how many here
[1:13:17] that's backslidden there's at the end of
[1:13:20] the service say oh you say I wouldn't
[1:13:21] admit that brother brown but he says but
[1:13:23] look if that Dove of meekness is gone
[1:13:25] from you brother there's something wrong
[1:13:27] there's something wrong when you can't
[1:13:29] bear with one another when you can't
[1:13:31] forgive every person from the very
[1:13:32] depths of your heart no matter what
[1:13:35] they've done or what they've said if you
[1:13:36] can't forgive them from the depths Jesus
[1:13:38] said if you don't forgive every man
[1:13:40] whose trespasses from your heart neither
[1:13:42] does your heavenly father forgive you I
[1:13:44] mean so there's Something's Happened
[1:13:45] that Dove of meekness of the pardon I'm
[1:13:49] not saying you're now Unforgiven but the
[1:13:51] power in it has left
[1:13:55] we we never want to get to a state where
[1:13:57] you're just grumpy with everything
[1:13:59] and we can have bad days right we're
[1:14:01] people who who's a person here are we
[1:14:03] people good praise the Lord so so we
[1:14:05] have bad days we have hard days you know
[1:14:06] sure but we shouldn't always just be
[1:14:09] grumpy with everyone and all that we
[1:14:10] think about is what everyone else has
[1:14:12] done wrong against me
[1:14:13] we should never be in that state right
[1:14:15] we should be able to forgive everyone
[1:14:17] from the very depths of their from the
[1:14:20] depths of our heart that we actually
[1:14:22] remember because true forgiveness is
[1:14:23] when you when you actually surrender the
[1:14:25] right to hold it against the person
[1:14:27] sure trust has to be earned but give
[1:14:29] forgiveness should be freely given and
[1:14:31] you can even you know and and it doesn't
[1:14:34] matter if that forgiveness is received
[1:14:35] or not
[1:14:37] right it's not it's not on your lap
[1:14:39] anymore you're free of it
[1:14:41] Hallelujah so we should never ever just
[1:14:43] be grumpy with everyone brother brother
[1:14:45] grumpy sister grumpy
[1:14:47] everything's wrong today forever
[1:14:50] believers wish me everything's fine
[1:14:53] everything's good it's Well with My Soul
[1:14:55] his blood still works he's still
[1:14:58] redeeming he's still calling prodigals
[1:14:59] his power is just the same as healing
[1:15:01] power is here I mean he's he's on time
[1:15:04] he's still on the throne
[1:15:06] Hallelujah
[1:15:08] amen so every Israelite if they wanted
[1:15:10] to return we're just going to go back to
[1:15:12] that amen they could return to where
[1:15:14] they came from now as I said you know if
[1:15:17] they to return to something as as you're
[1:15:20] going back to where you came from so for
[1:15:22] example if someone was from the tribe of
[1:15:24] Reuben and they and they and they sell
[1:15:25] themselves into slavery they had to
[1:15:27] leave their inheritance and go into
[1:15:29] slavery work for someone else but when
[1:15:31] that Jubilee trumpet blew they had a
[1:15:33] choice they could either stay a slave
[1:15:35] and actually stay a slave forever or
[1:15:37] they could go free yeah it was up to
[1:15:39] them but they had to choose to accept it
[1:15:41] that was a jubilee trumpet because
[1:15:43] remember the Jubilee trumpet is tied in
[1:15:45] with the atonement see atonement is made
[1:15:48] and then the trumpet is blown through
[1:15:49] the land that the people can go free so
[1:15:53] now when they when they heard the
[1:15:55] Jubilee trumpet and uh and and I believe
[1:15:57] I'm looking at a room of Jubilee trumpet
[1:15:59] hearers and responders right it's not
[1:16:02] just hearing a noise saying what was
[1:16:04] that no this sound has significance you
[1:16:07] know like you know when I used to work
[1:16:08] in the lab there's so many different
[1:16:09] alarms for the freezer and for this this
[1:16:12] detector and you had to know what they
[1:16:14] all meant you had to be aware you know
[1:16:16] you hear it's not just a beat this beep
[1:16:18] beep beep has a has a significance you
[1:16:20] know it's not just a sound for the sake
[1:16:21] of it and you had to be trained to say
[1:16:23] now this is the freezer and this is this
[1:16:25] and if this does this you need to do
[1:16:27] that and all this you know it's the same
[1:16:28] thing with the gospel you hear the sound
[1:16:31] we're going to respond to it we're gonna
[1:16:33] act upon it because there's power within
[1:16:35] it to take us back to our inheritance
[1:16:37] Hallelujah so someone who will say for
[1:16:40] example from the tribe of Reuben you
[1:16:41] know they hear the Jubilee trumpet they
[1:16:43] went back to where they came from
[1:16:46] they did not return to a place that they
[1:16:48] were not from in the beginning amen
[1:16:50] because that's not returning that's
[1:16:51] going to somewhere new Hallelujah so now
[1:16:54] the Apostle Paul would say in Ephesians
[1:16:56] 1. he says blessed be the God and Father
[1:16:58] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:17:00] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:17:03] places in Christ Jesus according he as
[1:17:06] he has chosen Us in him before the
[1:17:08] foundation of the world that we should
[1:17:10] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:17:12] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:17:15] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:17:17] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:17:19] of his will now we know adoption in the
[1:17:22] Bible is not like in in this world like
[1:17:25] for example if I wanted to adopt a child
[1:17:27] now I'd go to someone who's not blood
[1:17:30] relation will go to someone who's not
[1:17:32] related to me wasn't birthed out of me
[1:17:34] and I would take them into my family and
[1:17:36] write some paperwork now they're my
[1:17:38] child
[1:17:39] that is modern day adoption that is not
[1:17:41] Bible adoption adoption in the Bible
[1:17:43] means the placing of a son so someone
[1:17:46] who's been born into the family so very
[1:17:48] so for example my children if I wanted
[1:17:49] to adopt them I would come to a certain
[1:17:51] age and maturity and I would place them
[1:17:54] in the family that what they say and
[1:17:56] they do is the same Authority as me
[1:17:58] doing it
[1:17:59] that is Bible adoption right so so now
[1:18:03] notice he's predestinated us unto the
[1:18:06] adoption of children
[1:18:07] by Jesus Christ to himself so the
[1:18:10] believer's destiny is being
[1:18:11] predetermined our path has been made
[1:18:13] that we would come to our placing right
[1:18:18] as a child of Jesus Christ
[1:18:20] Hallelujah amen now now I know I said on
[1:18:24] my my my summary last Sunday I want to
[1:18:26] apologize for it because I said if you
[1:18:28] have the Holy Ghost and you have the
[1:18:29] character for the third pull it's a new
[1:18:30] potential but it's got to grow and
[1:18:31] mature
[1:18:32] right so there's got to be a maturity
[1:18:34] you need the Holy Ghost but then it
[1:18:36] grows okay amen and and we're well on
[1:18:39] our road I believe amen but you see but
[1:18:41] you see our deaths now now this is all
[1:18:43] part of the pardon because the pardon
[1:18:45] takes us somewhere the pardon takes us
[1:18:47] to our position in Christ Hallelujah
[1:18:50] remember you've got to believe in the
[1:18:51] power of the pardon amen if you don't
[1:18:53] believe it it won't take you anywhere
[1:18:55] amen but you see we have been predised
[1:18:57] unto the adoption of the placing of
[1:18:59] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:19:01] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:19:03] will Amen to the praise of the glory of
[1:19:05] his grace when he hath made us and I say
[1:19:07] me accepted in the Beloved appraisal in
[1:19:10] whom we have Redemption through his
[1:19:11] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:19:13] to the riches of his grace now we have a
[1:19:16] right to return
[1:19:18] now the difference between us and the
[1:19:20] Israelite is as the Israelite would
[1:19:22] remember where he came from
[1:19:23] right because it's a natural piece of
[1:19:25] land it's a natural where he was born he
[1:19:27] knew his parents were there his lineage
[1:19:29] was there he knew exactly the plot of
[1:19:31] land that was his that he would return
[1:19:32] to but the difference was that with us
[1:19:34] is that we are born with spiritual
[1:19:36] amnesia
[1:19:37] that we you know you know we don't know
[1:19:40] where we fell from we don't know where
[1:19:42] we're returning when we're born we think
[1:19:43] well I'm from New Zealand or I'm from
[1:19:44] here I'm from this place and this is my
[1:19:46] parents this is my history and we think
[1:19:48] that's our inheritance our natural
[1:19:50] inheritance but it's not
[1:19:52] right we're not from this world we're
[1:19:54] from Heaven you've got to believe you're
[1:19:55] from who believes they're from heaven
[1:19:57] amen they came from God they're going
[1:19:59] back to God oh Lisa now we have a place
[1:20:01] to return but you see we're born with
[1:20:03] spiritual Amnesia that we don't know
[1:20:05] where we fell from but now the Lord
[1:20:07] comes our way and he begins to reveal to
[1:20:10] us who he is and it begins to break the
[1:20:12] spiritual Amnesia you know brother Brown
[1:20:14] would tell a story of soldiers from the
[1:20:16] war I think it's World War one and they
[1:20:18] and they got amnesia because they got
[1:20:20] too much shell shock under the
[1:20:22] bombardment of the enemy they just lost
[1:20:23] their minds they forgot who they were
[1:20:25] and they're put in a in a train carriage
[1:20:27] and they're going to be taken to a
[1:20:28] mental Asylum and that was going to be
[1:20:30] them for the rest of their lives now now
[1:20:32] as they were going to this mental Asylum
[1:20:34] the train stops at a certain station and
[1:20:36] then and then they let the prisoners out
[1:20:38] to stretch their legs because they're
[1:20:39] actually normal human beings but they
[1:20:40] don't know who they are right they're
[1:20:42] not crazy they just don't know who they
[1:20:43] are so so so these men got out and then
[1:20:46] the guards were watching them because
[1:20:47] the guards had to keep them to make sure
[1:20:49] at a certain time they get back on the
[1:20:50] train and go right but then one of the
[1:20:52] one of the prisoners or one of the
[1:20:55] patients what are you going to call them
[1:20:56] he began to look around in a different
[1:20:58] way than the other men and he looked up
[1:21:00] and then he looked at a water tank and
[1:21:02] then he started walking on a track and
[1:21:05] then the guards one guard was going to
[1:21:06] stop him but the another guy said no
[1:21:08] hold on let's follow him let's see where
[1:21:10] this man goes and then he begins to walk
[1:21:12] and he walks down a path he sees a
[1:21:13] building then he walks and he sees it
[1:21:15] and he begins to walk now he now he's
[1:21:18] walking in familiar places but he
[1:21:19] doesn't exactly know where he is but
[1:21:21] then he comes along a Garden Path he
[1:21:23] comes up to a house and an old man comes
[1:21:25] out the front door runs downstairs my
[1:21:27] son I knew you'd come home and he
[1:21:29] Embraces him and then his Amnesia lifts
[1:21:32] him I mean when his father Embraces him
[1:21:34] his Amnesia of of who he was where he's
[1:21:37] from where his mother and father are all
[1:21:39] those things it breaks when the father
[1:21:41] Embraces him Ben and then the thing is
[1:21:44] he begin to see familiar places right
[1:21:46] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:21:48] amen the Lord opens the word to us and
[1:21:51] he begins to show us familiar places
[1:21:53] right so so he begins to show us types
[1:21:56] of like Joseph mating his Brethren but
[1:21:58] the Gentile bride he's taken is already
[1:22:00] in the palace saying that they say that
[1:22:03] the Lord Jesus before he reveals himself
[1:22:04] to the Jews we are raptured up in glory
[1:22:07] already oh oh he'll shout in the Book of
[1:22:09] Ruth how Ruth being a gentile amen would
[1:22:12] come into the promises of God and be
[1:22:14] married to the Mighty Man of wealth Boaz
[1:22:16] amen and she would be redeemed because
[1:22:18] of that Union it takes him to familiar
[1:22:21] places amen or the woman at the well we
[1:22:23] were like the woman at the well amen
[1:22:25] where where she was their broken life
[1:22:27] just thinking this is just how my life
[1:22:29] is going to be an outcast forever but
[1:22:31] then the Messiah came her way began to
[1:22:33] speak to her reveal her past amen she
[1:22:35] said I know when Messiah cometh he'll do
[1:22:37] these things and she said he said to her
[1:22:39] he that speaks to thee and he opened her
[1:22:42] eyes amen broke her spiritual Amnesia
[1:22:44] Hallelujah and that's what the message
[1:22:46] does it takes us into familiar places in
[1:22:49] the word amen so what happens is those
[1:22:51] familiar places begin to move us
[1:22:54] right but it's not just to take us on a
[1:22:56] sightseeing tour it's taking us to
[1:22:58] Father's house I must take him to
[1:23:00] himself that's the purpose of it and as
[1:23:02] we begin to walk through types and
[1:23:04] shadows and we begin to see ourselves
[1:23:06] and who he is but then finally father
[1:23:08] comes out amen because he said although
[1:23:10] the father has given me will come to me
[1:23:13] and all that come to me all no way is
[1:23:15] cast out amen so that call of the word
[1:23:17] that we start walking down familiar
[1:23:19] places
[1:23:20] it draws you to him
[1:23:23] then he Embraces you by the baptism of
[1:23:25] Holy Ghost is my son my daughter I've
[1:23:27] been looking for you I knew you'd come
[1:23:29] to me I drew you and here you are then
[1:23:31] what happens our spiritual Amnesia
[1:23:33] breaks and we realize I'm a son or
[1:23:35] daughter of God I know who my father is
[1:23:37] I know and whom I have believed
[1:23:40] Hallelujah
[1:23:41] hallelujah amen you'll be may have been
[1:23:44] so shocked by so much training and so
[1:23:46] many shocks at denomination Creed and
[1:23:47] things of the world but when you step
[1:23:49] off for a few minutes and look around
[1:23:50] the Bible I mean you might find yourself
[1:23:53] identified with the words of God
[1:23:55] hallelujah so amen he saw familiar
[1:23:58] places and then he brought him back to
[1:24:00] the back to the Father the boy came to
[1:24:03] himself his Amnesia left him he could
[1:24:05] identify who he was he knew who he was
[1:24:08] when he met his father Hallelujah that's
[1:24:11] the same thing with you and I am but
[1:24:13] this is where the pardon takes us see
[1:24:15] the pardon wants to his pardoning grace
[1:24:17] wants to open our eyes you're more than
[1:24:19] church people
[1:24:21] you're more than just religious people
[1:24:22] you're more than just even Christians
[1:24:24] don't say that no your sons and
[1:24:26] daughters of God hallelujah this is what
[1:24:28] the part in Grace wants to show us amen
[1:24:30] because there is a power in the truth
[1:24:33] Jesus said ye shall know the truth
[1:24:36] and the truth shall make you free so
[1:24:38] there's a force in the truth that will
[1:24:40] free a person amen it's not you shall
[1:24:43] know the truth and you shall Free
[1:24:44] Yourself no he said ye shall know the
[1:24:46] truth you shall see people in this day
[1:24:48] say how can you know truth if you're
[1:24:50] honest and sincere with God he'll bring
[1:24:52] you to the truth
[1:24:53] not just partial truth all truth I mean
[1:24:57] because remember all truth is not a
[1:24:59] collection of Doctrine all truth is a
[1:25:01] person all truth is the almighty is
[1:25:03] Jesus Christ himself amen so if you
[1:25:06] continue in his word then you shall be
[1:25:07] my disciples indeed he said and you
[1:25:09] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:25:11] make you free so in other words you
[1:25:13] shall know the pardon and the pardon
[1:25:16] will make you free because there's power
[1:25:17] in the pardon to free you amen but
[1:25:19] you've got to believe that there's a
[1:25:21] force in it amen it's not a force it is
[1:25:23] the force maybe because the truth is not
[1:25:26] just a collection of doctrines or ideas
[1:25:27] but Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:25:30] and the life Hallelujah he is the truth
[1:25:32] amen and if you know him you shall know
[1:25:35] him and he will make you free that's why
[1:25:38] I say I can't free myself you're not
[1:25:39] made to Free Yourself he is made to free
[1:25:42] you he said I can't fight this battle
[1:25:44] you don't need to fight the battle the
[1:25:45] battle is of the Lord I mean because
[1:25:47] remember every testimony is actually God
[1:25:50] to this and God did that and God led me
[1:25:52] here and God freed me here and God
[1:25:54] healed this person and God did this and
[1:25:56] God spoke this and God responded this
[1:25:58] way and God changed me and it wasn't and
[1:26:00] I did this and I said that and I went
[1:26:02] here and I spoke to that person and I
[1:26:04] healed no that's not a testimony a
[1:26:07] testimony is evidence of him in our
[1:26:09] lives that's a testimony amen when you
[1:26:12] give evidence and Court you say this is
[1:26:13] what happened
[1:26:15] Hallelujah and so when we give evidence
[1:26:17] amen when we give testimony it's it's
[1:26:19] evidence of what he has done
[1:26:22] that's real testimony praise the Lord
[1:26:24] will weaken because every testimony
[1:26:26] should give praise to him
[1:26:27] when you see it and he did that and he
[1:26:30] saved me and he gave me the pardon and
[1:26:32] he purchased my salvation on Calvary and
[1:26:34] he's redeeming he's washed all my sins
[1:26:36] away and he's healed me and he's guiding
[1:26:38] me and he's loving me and he's caring
[1:26:40] for me and he's keeping me and he's
[1:26:41] watching over me and he's answering my
[1:26:43] prayers and he's got my children in mind
[1:26:45] and my family's come in because he said
[1:26:47] and he said I'm gonna make it and he
[1:26:49] said I'm going to be in the Rapture and
[1:26:50] he's not going to be in the wedding
[1:26:51] supper and he said I'm going to be
[1:26:53] Eternal and he said I'm gonna be off
[1:26:54] streets of gold he said I mean you've
[1:26:56] got to judge him faithful I mean he is
[1:26:58] more than Abel he is faithful and true
[1:27:00] amen that's why you've got to have in
[1:27:02] your heart member Sarah judged him
[1:27:05] Faithfully is able to keep that which he
[1:27:06] promised I mean have you judged them
[1:27:08] faithful amen because of your judged and
[1:27:10] faithful he'll do it again Hallelujah
[1:27:13] and you may have been wallowing an
[1:27:14] unbelief but he's come to open your eyes
[1:27:16] and to show you I'm faithful and true
[1:27:19] just trusted my word trust in me and you
[1:27:21] shall never fail Hallelujah why because
[1:27:24] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[1:27:26] shall make you free
[1:27:28] Hallelujah
[1:27:30] glory to God
[1:27:32] Hallelujah
[1:27:34] hey man that's why we've got to have
[1:27:35] such confidence and God wants us to have
[1:27:37] such utter confidence in him in this day
[1:27:39] amen that he's going to gather a people
[1:27:41] he's given us pardon we've chosen to
[1:27:44] receive his pardon now there's power in
[1:27:47] that pardon to take us to where we need
[1:27:49] to go
[1:27:50] Hallelujah
[1:27:51] Hallelujah
[1:27:53] amen the all the all the religious Jews
[1:27:55] got angry at him saying but we are
[1:27:57] Abraham's seed we've never been in
[1:27:58] bondage what are you saying we're slaves
[1:28:00] we're not him but we're free
[1:28:02] but Jesus answers in barely realize
[1:28:04] saying to you whosoever commit a sin as
[1:28:06] the servant of sin and the servant
[1:28:08] abideth in the house uh forever so the
[1:28:12] servant abideth not in the house of evil
[1:28:13] but the son abideth forever so he's
[1:28:16] saying there's times when the servants
[1:28:17] say that they had their wages and
[1:28:19] they're kicked out why but those who are
[1:28:21] born
[1:28:22] into the family stay in the house they
[1:28:25] don't leave the house don't leave the
[1:28:27] kingdom of God because they're birthed
[1:28:28] into the kingdom Hallelujah
[1:28:31] amen see those he has given birth to
[1:28:33] they're no longer servants their sons
[1:28:35] and John is with him in the Kingdom
[1:28:37] that's the way the church is as joint is
[1:28:39] with Christ and the kingdom ears of all
[1:28:41] things to God through him
[1:28:44] Hallelujah he says if the son therefore
[1:28:46] shall make you free you're free indeed
[1:28:48] if the pardon has made you free you're
[1:28:50] free indeed you're not partially free
[1:28:53] this is not a joint custody thing
[1:28:55] between God and the devil and you're the
[1:28:56] child being passed to and fro no no this
[1:28:59] is full custody God says I want full
[1:29:01] custody of my children you have no part
[1:29:03] in them I have no part in you you have
[1:29:05] no part in their lives I'm going to cut
[1:29:06] you off devil Hallelujah that's exactly
[1:29:09] what he's done by the blood of his son
[1:29:11] Hallelujah
[1:29:13] praise Lord
[1:29:14] amen now with a pardon

[1:31:35] who's condemned to die he's just
[1:31:36] resigned to his own fate
[1:31:38] you know he's just sitting there and his
[1:31:40] friend maybe rattles the door saying say
[1:31:42] Johnny Johnny I've got it what have you
[1:31:45] got I've got your pardon what do you
[1:31:47] mean I've got you what what do you mean
[1:31:49] look at this look at this and then and
[1:31:52] then his friend Johnny just gets angry
[1:31:54] he said no no you're mocking me you're
[1:31:56] making fun of me that's not an official
[1:31:58] letterhead with where's the watermark
[1:32:00] where's the Seal of the United States
[1:32:02] and I said no no no but look look it's
[1:32:04] got his name it's got Abraham Lincoln
[1:32:06] it's got a signature he said no you're
[1:32:08] just mocking me you're just making fun
[1:32:10] of me anyone could sign that and he
[1:32:12] turned it down
[1:32:13] and in the morning he was shot
[1:32:16] and now an inquiry happened because
[1:32:18] here's a man who was pardoned got shot
[1:32:21] he shouldn't have got shot
[1:32:23] and and and it went to the Supreme Court
[1:32:26] or tried in the federal courts and the
[1:32:28] and the decision was a pardon is not a
[1:32:30] pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon
[1:32:33] so because the man chose not to accept
[1:32:35] his pardon he got shot
[1:32:38] now that man's pardon was perfectly good
[1:32:42] right nothing wrong with it it wasn't a
[1:32:45] forged letter it was perfectly good I
[1:32:48] believe the guards and the ward and
[1:32:50] everyone had control that prison believe
[1:32:52] that pardon because they let the man in
[1:32:54] with the pattern
[1:32:56] you see they believed what was written
[1:32:58] on the paper but the man who was was
[1:32:59] four did not believe it he said no this
[1:33:02] is my fate well I've just I've just been
[1:33:04] too long like this this is just how my
[1:33:06] life has to be no God interrupts things
[1:33:10] we think yeah yeah the devil says this
[1:33:12] is your road this is how it's just gonna
[1:33:14] be and this is your and but then God God
[1:33:16] sets up a traffic jam and you've got to
[1:33:19] drive off the devil's Road and you find
[1:33:21] yourself on the King's Highway he's very
[1:33:23] good at interrupting the devil's plans
[1:33:25] hello like the woman at the well or
[1:33:27] Peter James and John any of the
[1:33:28] disciples Legion that was him they
[1:33:31] couldn't help him they couldn't tie him
[1:33:33] up they couldn't subdue him so he's just
[1:33:35] out there with the you know the
[1:33:36] mountains and the and and the graves and
[1:33:38] stuff and the devil thought I've got him
[1:33:40] oh no oh no one greater than those
[1:33:44] Devils came his way he crossed the sea
[1:33:46] for one Hallelujah and he can cross the
[1:33:49] sea just for one today amen he can leave
[1:33:51] Heaven just for one right now Hallelujah
[1:33:54] I believe that's all my heart amen he
[1:33:56] will leave heaven for one
[1:33:57] praise the Lord if he would die you know
[1:33:59] if he only purchased the salvation of of
[1:34:02] of one person on the calvary he would
[1:34:03] have done it all the same
[1:34:05] amen praise God Amen
[1:34:08] Hallelujah so he had to accept it now if
[1:34:11] he now you just think about this now if
[1:34:14] he really accepted that pardon
[1:34:17] the power in it wasn't just to free him
[1:34:19] from the penalty of desertion which was
[1:34:21] to be shot
[1:34:22] right it so he didn't just stay in his
[1:34:24] prison cell saying I'm not going to get
[1:34:26] shot anymore
[1:34:27] I'm free
[1:34:28] right
[1:34:29] and then just take that from him but the
[1:34:32] power within that pardon was greater
[1:34:35] than the prison Buzz
[1:34:36] right it was great so so the prison bars
[1:34:40] had to give way to the pardon so just
[1:34:42] say if he accepted that pardon he could
[1:34:44] take it
[1:34:45] the prison buzzer hits a open those
[1:34:47] prisoner bars make way why I've got a
[1:34:50] pardon I don't have to be in here
[1:34:52] anymore and then he goes out the prison
[1:34:54] then maybe there's a guard down the
[1:34:55] hallway what are you doing out of
[1:34:56] yourself make way get out of my way I've
[1:34:58] got a pardon and the prison guard would
[1:35:00] have to go to one side he'd walk through
[1:35:02] and then and then maybe the warden will
[1:35:04] come out because it'd be a bit of a
[1:35:05] commotion going on here's someone on
[1:35:07] Death Rows being pardoned this doesn't
[1:35:09] happen all the time you know maybe other
[1:35:11] inmates are looking at different things
[1:35:12] and the warning comes out what's going
[1:35:14] on what are you doing out of yourself
[1:35:15] get out of my way Warden you're in
[1:35:18] charge of me you're in charge of this
[1:35:19] prison but I've got a pardon you don't
[1:35:21] have you have no right over my life
[1:35:23] anymore I am free to walk free and there
[1:35:26] come to thee come to the prison doors

[1:35:42] you and I you've got to realize this
[1:35:43] power there's power in your pardon
[1:35:47] if I can find this there's power in your
[1:35:48] pardon

[1:35:52] than every single thing
[1:35:54] oh it's probably in here
[1:35:58] amen here's a few prison guards and
[1:36:00] levels of security that God's pardon can
[1:36:02] take us through it's greater than every
[1:36:04] complex
[1:36:05] it's greater than anxiety if you have
[1:36:08] anxiety this morning you can say my
[1:36:10] partner is greater than anxiety amen it
[1:36:13] is greater than depression there's power
[1:36:15] in this pardon right now it's greater
[1:36:17] than depression amen it is greater than
[1:36:19] any insecurity you feel insecure when
[1:36:22] you get out of your comfort zone your
[1:36:23] pardon is greater than any insecurity
[1:36:26] amen it is greater than stubbornness
[1:36:29] Hallelujah there's power on that you see
[1:36:31] you've got to believe there's power in
[1:36:32] this pardon right not just to men you're
[1:36:35] not shot so so it doesn't mean well I'm
[1:36:37] not going to go to hell anymore there's
[1:36:38] more than that power right sure that's
[1:36:41] the first thing that's got to be taken
[1:36:42] out of your life I'm not going to hell
[1:36:44] I'm going to heaven right so you're not
[1:36:45] going to be shot by firing squad right
[1:36:47] but there's power in the pardon to walk
[1:36:49] out of every prison now
[1:36:51] I mean so so that's greater than
[1:36:52] stubbornness
[1:36:54] there's more power in the part and then
[1:36:56] and then than any unforgiveness they can
[1:36:58] cage someone it is greater than all
[1:37:01] unworthiness
[1:37:02] Hallelujah there's power in this part
[1:37:04] and you say well I Feel So Unworthy
[1:37:06] we're all unworthy
[1:37:07] but the devil wants to push us down a
[1:37:09] whole saying you're not worthy no no
[1:37:11] none of us are worthy but he's worthy
[1:37:13] and the worthy one gave you the pardon
[1:37:15] so I'm walking free holy it is greater
[1:37:18] than any doubts there's power in this
[1:37:19] pardon
[1:37:21] it's it's greater than being backslidden
[1:37:23] and cold and formal and lukewarm there's
[1:37:26] power in this pardon to make us white
[1:37:27] hot again on fire for God Amen why
[1:37:30] because there's power in this part now
[1:37:32] what is the power of the pardon its
[1:37:34] faith is that power
[1:37:35] I mean faith is that power you know
[1:37:38] Hallelujah who's with me right now
[1:37:41] Hallelujah amen there's power in this
[1:37:43] pardon Amen to Lucius from any any
[1:37:45] prison nothing has to hold you because
[1:37:48] there's power in your pardon remember
[1:37:49] there's no power in him if there's power
[1:37:52] in him to get out of the jail he would
[1:37:53] have busted out like a Rambo and been
[1:37:55] free he would have been on the run
[1:37:56] somewhere but he couldn't get out
[1:37:58] someone had to come from the outside in
[1:38:00] to get him out right and his friend just
[1:38:02] didn't come empty-handed saying man
[1:38:04] we've got to get out of here I've got to
[1:38:06] help you somehow no he went to the right
[1:38:07] Source amen and he got the presidential
[1:38:10] pardon and went to his friend I mean so
[1:38:12] it wasn't his own ability that got him
[1:38:14] out it was the power and the pardon got
[1:38:16] him free
[1:38:17] holy so we're gonna realize that our
[1:38:19] partner Network who's carrying the
[1:38:21] pardon where's the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:23] Ghost have you got that you've got the
[1:38:24] pardon right if you choose to accept it

[1:38:31] in here well what about is it a
[1:38:33] revelation don't worry about that have
[1:38:34] you chosen to accept it
[1:38:36] and just and just walk on with that amen
[1:38:39] remember faith is that power no no we we
[1:38:42] must realize that our pardon is greater
[1:38:45] than Satan's Eden right now it is
[1:38:47] greater than the lukewarmness of ladies
[1:38:49] it's greater than this world we live in
[1:38:52] Hallelujah who believes that I know see
[1:38:54] it's greater than anything you see we we
[1:38:57] Marvel at the Masters and how they
[1:38:59] overcame in their day how they were fed
[1:39:01] to Lions they were tortured they were
[1:39:03] sworn asunder you know pregnant woman
[1:39:04] their bellies were ripped open horrible
[1:39:06] things happen right and we Marvel at the
[1:39:08] great faith that they had
[1:39:10] you admire them
[1:39:12] amen I believe any True True Believer
[1:39:15] should admire the faith in another
[1:39:16] believer
[1:39:17] right we should be able to admire the
[1:39:19] faith in one another say praise God
[1:39:21] that's all I'm so I'm so privileged to
[1:39:23] know you and know your testimony and
[1:39:25] know your life amen that's how we should
[1:39:27] feel about one another
[1:39:28] Hallelujah you see now see the faith
[1:39:32] that they used or had to overcome and
[1:39:35] being faithful martyrs
[1:39:38] see well well I'll just read it
[1:39:40] he says now be thou faithful unto death
[1:39:43] he does not say be faithful until death
[1:39:45] but unto death you may have to seal your
[1:39:48] testimony with your blood thousands yet
[1:39:49] Millions have died through all the ages
[1:39:51] they died in the faith like anti-pass
[1:39:53] the faithful martyr they held out their
[1:39:56] lives dear unto the death
[1:39:58] often we think that it would be almost
[1:40:00] impossible to be a martyr but dare to
[1:40:02] recall that the faith we daily use to
[1:40:04] Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same
[1:40:06] faith that upholds the polycarps and all
[1:40:08] the martyrs the Supreme faith will give
[1:40:11] Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour amen
[1:40:14] so when we come to a time of great
[1:40:15] challenge the Supreme faith that you
[1:40:18] have will give Supreme Grace for that
[1:40:20] Supreme hour Amen to the faith we have
[1:40:22] every day
[1:40:25] is the same faith that they Triumph with
[1:40:28] is the same faith we have
[1:40:31] Hallelujah because remember if you don't
[1:40:33] think your partner is good enough you're
[1:40:35] going to start doubting
[1:40:36] is this really good for everything
[1:40:39] oh it's good for some things well that
[1:40:41] means you're only partly out of the
[1:40:42] prison
[1:40:43] you've got to realize this is this is
[1:40:45] good all the way to the body change
[1:40:49] this pardon is good amen and there's no
[1:40:51] sub Clauses in it the devil can get in
[1:40:53] and trick you and Rob you of the pardon
[1:40:55] if you have that pardoning grace of God
[1:40:57] it is good for everything amen right up
[1:41:00] to the change of the body
[1:41:02] hallelujah amen now Faith Faith brings
[1:41:06] the word into manifestation right
[1:41:08] because the word can't just be argued
[1:41:10] about or talked about it's got to be
[1:41:11] manifested that's what the Lord is
[1:41:13] working looking for for his promises to
[1:41:15] become flesh I mean so so the pardon the
[1:41:18] power and the pardon which is Faith
[1:41:19] brings the pardon into manifestation
[1:41:22] Hallelujah
[1:41:24] amen so what does it do it brings
[1:41:25] Deliverance in a manifestation it brings
[1:41:28] healing into manifestation amen it
[1:41:30] brings it brings every promise of God
[1:41:32] becomes manifest Why by the power in the
[1:41:34] pardon
[1:41:35] Holly is as as
[1:41:38] um Paul would say in Hebrews 11 that
[1:41:39] through faith subdued kingdoms wrote
[1:41:41] righteousness obtained promises stop the
[1:41:43] mouths of lions what was that that was
[1:41:45] the power in God's pardon having caused
[1:41:47] those things they obtained promises
[1:41:49] righteousness subdued kingdoms what
[1:41:52] through the power and the pardon
[1:41:53] Hallelujah amen now now this part and
[1:41:57] you think about it it'll take you to one
[1:41:59] place but it'll stop you going to
[1:42:00] another place
[1:42:02] so before you head the pardon
[1:42:05] your your road was to destruction
[1:42:08] doesn't matter who you are your lineage
[1:42:10] whatever how holy or good your how
[1:42:14] Spirit-filled your parents are
[1:42:15] grandparents whatever we're born on a
[1:42:17] road to destruction right but the pardon
[1:42:20] stops US going on that road it actually
[1:42:22] diverts us off that road onto the road
[1:42:24] of righteousness Amen to this power and
[1:42:27] God's pardon to stop us going into the
[1:42:29] Great Tribulation
[1:42:30] Hallelujah it actually stops when you've
[1:42:32] really received this part that's how
[1:42:33] great it is when you really receive this
[1:42:35] pardon you can't go to the Great
[1:42:37] Tribulation
[1:42:38] Hallelujah because a full pardon is the
[1:42:40] body change
[1:42:42] amen hallelujah
[1:42:43] praise the Lord amen now then we also
[1:42:46] need to realize so I think time is time
[1:42:47] is time is running away but but we need
[1:42:50] to realize that there's power in this
[1:42:52] pardon not just for ourselves
[1:42:54] right remember Christianity is not just
[1:42:56] for yourself sure you meet the Lord
[1:42:58] yourself but now God wants to use you to
[1:43:00] reach others Amen to this power in this
[1:43:03] pardon not just for you but it's for
[1:43:04] your family amen like like Paul and
[1:43:07] Silas would have a praise you know
[1:43:09] you're an all-night prayer meeting
[1:43:10] they're in the jail Hallelujah they
[1:43:13] didn't care they were beaten they didn't
[1:43:14] care because remember their thoughts
[1:43:15] went Heavenly and not kindly say when
[1:43:18] they weren't looking at their stocks no
[1:43:19] more in their beatings and the pain and
[1:43:21] the Darkness and the inner prison and
[1:43:23] the dampness and the rats and the
[1:43:24] whatever that was going on in there they
[1:43:26] began to think Heavenly our God is so
[1:43:28] awesome our God is so great they begin
[1:43:31] to testify one to another about his
[1:43:33] goodness and Silas would say I remember
[1:43:35] when Jesus found me and the Apostle Paul
[1:43:37] would say man the roads are Damascus
[1:43:40] I I'm never the same traveling that road
[1:43:42] there's always that spot that I remember
[1:43:44] oh look it just comes back to me as
[1:43:46] amazing grace and they begin to sing the
[1:43:48] Psalms and praise God hallelujah then
[1:43:51] then it's like they went in prison no
[1:43:52] more but they were totally free and
[1:43:54] that's the thing you can be bound and
[1:43:56] changed but you're the freest person in
[1:43:57] the world I mean like the Apostle Paul
[1:44:00] when he went before king of gripper and
[1:44:01] chains he wasn't the chained one
[1:44:03] king of gripper and those were actually
[1:44:05] chained in sin he was the free man
[1:44:07] Hallelujah so it may look naturally like
[1:44:10] we're Bound in some way no no we're free
[1:44:12] Hallelujah so they begin to praise God
[1:44:15] then God came down and his presence
[1:44:17] filled the prison and there's an
[1:44:18] earthquake is shaking and all the prison
[1:44:20] does bars came open the doors came over
[1:44:22] and then the Jailer woke up you know
[1:44:25] pulled out a sword saying well they've
[1:44:26] run away so this is the end of me but
[1:44:28] then he heard a voice from the end of
[1:44:30] prison don't kill yourself we're still
[1:44:33] here
[1:44:34] hallelujah hallelujah and then and then
[1:44:37] he began to realize he yo he asked the
[1:44:39] question we went down his knees before
[1:44:40] Paul what must I do to be saved and he
[1:44:43] said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:45] and thine and thy house shall be saved
[1:44:48] so basically the Jailer said how can I
[1:44:50] get this pardon that you're enjoying
[1:44:52] because I know it's not just for you
[1:44:53] there must be some of it for me I'll
[1:44:55] lose to the so that Jayla was told this
[1:44:57] is how you get the pardon believe on the
[1:44:59] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:01] and thine and it's not just for you the
[1:45:03] pardons for your house it's not just for
[1:45:06] you this is not just for you this is for
[1:45:07] your wife for your children your house
[1:45:11] and so he was told to believe on the
[1:45:13] Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy
[1:45:16] house shall be saved so in other words
[1:45:17] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:45:19] your house
[1:45:20] right so apply the same pattern you have
[1:45:23] upon them in faith Hallelujah so don't
[1:45:26] just don't just say well it's just for
[1:45:28] me and somehow they've got to get no you
[1:45:30] the same Faith you have for you use on
[1:45:33] them
[1:45:34] how do you do that in prayer and being a
[1:45:37] witness living a surrendered life
[1:45:39] creating a right kind of atmosphere not
[1:45:42] getting carnal with them not getting all
[1:45:43] fighting and fussing but have such an
[1:45:45] atmosphere around you of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:46] can you do it absolutely
[1:45:48] absolutely we can walk an unconscious of
[1:45:51] fear we can walk unconscious of
[1:45:53] criticism we can walk unconscious of
[1:45:56] fighting and fasting we can ride all
[1:45:57] above it and that's not being oblivious
[1:45:59] but you're in such an atmosphere of the
[1:46:01] Holy Ghost everyone can be fighting
[1:46:03] around you but you're just walking in
[1:46:04] perfect peace why because you're
[1:46:06] carrying a pattern
[1:46:07] Hallelujah and you think man if those
[1:46:10] people only knew what I had in my
[1:46:11] possession
[1:46:12] and they said I've got good news for you
[1:46:14] it's for you too and it's for you it's
[1:46:15] for all of you if you want it hallelujah
[1:46:17] what do you do create an atmosphere of
[1:46:19] power around you that your family see
[1:46:21] something's happened to this person they
[1:46:23] haven't just joined a church or some
[1:46:24] religion whatever no no they've received
[1:46:26] a pardon amen because remember when you
[1:46:29] receive the pardon you're not receiving
[1:46:30] a Doctrine you're not receiving a

[1:47:21] Christianity is in everyday life this
[1:47:23] partner is not just that you get to sit
[1:47:24] in a church that's got nothing to do
[1:47:26] with it I mean but it's a rugged
[1:47:28] everyday walk where God lives I mean
[1:47:30] because part of the partners I'll never

[1:48:05] same yesterday today and forever well
[1:48:07] how do you live that you let him live
[1:48:09] through you
[1:48:10] right so what brother Brown preached
[1:48:12] about is manifested in your life you
[1:48:13] become a living epistle read a known of
[1:48:16] all means you become a living pardon
[1:48:17] what people read your life you say
[1:48:19] Something's Happened to that person
[1:48:21] they're different it's not just by the
[1:48:23] way they dress there's something in
[1:48:25] their nature it's more than just a
[1:48:27] natural nature and you get salty that I
[1:48:29] want to be around those people
[1:48:31] you know people who just want to be
[1:48:32] around you why because they actually
[1:48:33] love the Lord within you they may not
[1:48:35] know who he is at the moment but there's
[1:48:37] just something that you attract people
[1:48:39] what is that that's the pardon
[1:48:41] attracting people
[1:48:42] Hallelujah why but you've got to give
[1:48:44] the pardon to those people
[1:48:47] praise God
[1:48:48] Hallelujah
[1:48:50] amen
[1:48:52] because if you look at Revelations 10
[1:48:53] when the mighty angel came down with an
[1:48:55] open book what is that that's the pardon
[1:48:57] come open that's the fullness of the
[1:48:59] pardon right the Believers down Through
[1:49:00] the Ages had it but now it's all come
[1:49:02] open the word has all come open what so
[1:49:04] by what do you mean through come one
[1:49:05] with the pardon and speak the pardon
[1:49:08] Hallelujah see so so we don't just
[1:49:11] absorb the word and it just sits in
[1:49:13] there no it's got to come out as a lived
[1:49:15] voice as a manifested word out of our
[1:49:17] Lives the pardon becomes manifested well
[1:49:20] how does that part of work well someone
[1:49:22] you know does something wrong to you you
[1:49:24] have the pardon you say father forgive
[1:49:26] them
[1:49:27] you know it's like water off a duck's
[1:49:29] back you just walk on why because you've
[1:49:31] got a pardon you can't help it you've
[1:49:33] got a different nature I mean you don't
[1:49:35] have a cartilage you're not walking like
[1:49:36] men anymore you're walking like the Son
[1:49:38] of God because his faith is within you
[1:49:41] Hallelujah that's how we should be
[1:49:44] amen
[1:49:46] so I'm just going to wind it up just
[1:49:47] there I'm just going to land the plane
[1:49:48] just like this
[1:49:50] do you have the pardon
[1:49:52] does your life
[1:49:54] show you have this pardon more than just
[1:49:57] being part of a church more than even
[1:49:58] just getting baptized in Lord Jesus
[1:50:00] Christ which is the Bible
[1:50:02] do you have you chosen to receive this
[1:50:04] pardon and is the pardon manifested in
[1:50:07] your life or have you forgotten what he
[1:50:09] gave you
[1:50:10] have you forgotten what he gave you you
[1:50:13] know the value of what's in at
[1:50:15] brotherbraham tells the story of a boy
[1:50:16] who went up to an attic one day up to
[1:50:18] his father's attic and he found a stamp
[1:50:20] he wanted an ice cream
[1:50:21] got this stamp ran to the ice cream you
[1:50:24] know the dairy the corner Dairy says I
[1:50:26] want a double scoop what are you going
[1:50:28] to pay for it with this now the owner of
[1:50:30] the store said yep sure
[1:50:32] took that stamp sold the Flight 500 what
[1:50:34] a few thousand dollars nowadays you know
[1:50:36] and then and then the stamp Trader sold
[1:50:39] that that he sold it to sold it for like
[1:50:41] five hundred thousand dollars and then
[1:50:43] that guy sold it for more why because
[1:50:45] the boy didn't know the value of what he
[1:50:48] had
[1:50:48] he just thought well I want an ice cream
[1:50:50] you know but the reason he didn't know
[1:50:53] the value of that stamp is because his
[1:50:55] parents put it in the Attic it wasn't on
[1:50:57] the mantelpiece in a picture frame
[1:51:00] it wasn't the value of it wasn't taught
[1:51:02] to the child that's why he sold it for
[1:51:05] an ice cream right and it's the same
[1:51:07] thing with the power of the pardon if
[1:51:10] it's put up in the attic its value is
[1:51:12] forgotten how can our future generation
[1:51:15] how can our children know the power of
[1:51:16] this pardon you have received
[1:51:18] right they'll sell it for an ice cream
[1:51:22] we don't want to sell this pardoning
[1:51:25] grace for a night trade it for something
[1:51:26] of the world that actually has no value
[1:51:29] right but the reason he didn't know the
[1:51:30] valley because it wasn't taught him the
[1:51:32] value why because their lives weren't
[1:51:34] actually saying look at the stamp we
[1:51:35] have look how much this is rare this is
[1:51:37] one of a kind this is incredible right
[1:51:39] it was just put up in the attic put away
[1:51:41] in storage somewhere
[1:51:42] now that's what I say maybe you've
[1:51:45] forgotten the power of the pardon that
[1:51:46] you have
[1:51:48] because they forgot the value of that
[1:51:49] Stamper put it in the Attic
[1:51:51] now how about you and I this pardon you
[1:51:53] have
[1:51:54] do you know its value do you carry it
[1:51:57] around didn't you
[1:51:58] or do you walk calmly as men
[1:52:01] do you have the pardon
[1:52:03] are you fussing and fighting with
[1:52:04] everyone all the time
[1:52:05] is it always drama
[1:52:07] if it is I say you need to make sure you
[1:52:10] have that pardon
[1:52:12] amen
[1:52:14] because this is serious time
[1:52:16] you don't have the part and you're not
[1:52:17] going if you have the pardon you're
[1:52:18] going but you've got to choose to accept
[1:52:21] it well I need the Lord to tell me
[1:52:24] you've got to choose to accept it and
[1:52:27] then the power of the pardon can start
[1:52:28] manifesting in your life if that man who
[1:52:30] is going to be shot chose to accept that
[1:52:32] pardon he may not understand it why
[1:52:35] isn't it on the right page and blah blah
[1:52:37] blah but he chose to accept it the power
[1:52:39] of that pardon with a manifest he walked
[1:52:40] out he would have walked out a free man
[1:52:42] it's that simple
[1:52:44] let's not turn it down today friends
[1:52:46] I mean let's have the musicians this
[1:52:48] morning
