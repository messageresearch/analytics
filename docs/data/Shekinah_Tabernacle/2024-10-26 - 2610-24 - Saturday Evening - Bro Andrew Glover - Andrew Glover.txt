morning Father encouraging the hearts of those and situations Lord that father seems impossible Lord seems like things will never change Lord seems like time has it turned against them and they've been in those conditions for a long time but then to know that you have a designated time that you've ordained Lord that you would come yourself and minister to the needs of your children father we're so grateful Lord Lord Lord we're so thankful for the faith that's in our hearts to believe you and to believe your word Lord living in this world where so many have been darkened and their eyes have been blinded Lord to the realities of you and father Lord not even to be able to see you in nature or to be able to see you around them oh God lord we're thankful tonight that our eyes have been open to see you and Lord to know you and our souls have been restored Under The Fellowship of your blood Lord that we're back communing with you Lord Lord as your children and as your children's believ in you Lord I invite you to come among us tonight in a special way Lord you see these things you've laid up on our heart now Lord without your anointing it will just be words that have been put together but oh God if you will come among us as you did on that emus road walk and Lord you'll take the bread of your word and you'll begin to break it father Lord we know that eyes will come open and Believers will be a begin to see who they are in your word Lord I pray that Faith would come to every heart here tonight oh God lord I pray as your word Goes Forth May sicknesses leave bodies Lord May diseases that have plagued lives for years oh god father we rebuke them in the name of the Lord Jesus and may by the authority of your word Lord may they leave the bodies of your children oh God pray for empty vessels here tonight Lord father May the Holy Ghost in fire fill every vessel here oh God lord I pray tonight there would come such a reality of this message in the hearts of your children Lord that every devil that is defeated him and has turn has tried to tear him down lord may they raise up tonight oh God under the pure inspiration of the message of the hour and strike back against those enemies and Prevail now Lord we commit this meeting tonight in our faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God Rich you bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we want to invite you in the word of the Lord tonight for just a few moments we want to turn to the Book of Jeremiah the book of Jeremiah the first chapter and while you're returning there tonight we want to say God bless you all and amen wasn't that a wonderful service this morning amen we sure appreciate our brother Chris and the word of the Lord that he brought to us this morning God bless you my brother amen we're looking forward to the amen the furtherance of these meetings and what the Lord is going to do amen we're trusting the Lord just to do some wonderful things as he's already doing Among Us and amen we do want to say God bless you to the church here and amen I was just sitting back there in the back room a few minutes ago and amen just looking around and admiring amen I tell you this local assembly has put a lot of work into this meeting amen you can look around and see that's just not thrown together but they've put some time and effort and amen usually you uh go to meetings on campgrounds and you're outside of local churches and you're in offices and studies and they just find a little corner somewhere and do the best they can but amen these brothers have put together a whole office back there there amen I tell you there's a a refrigerator and I'm I better stop cuz you might go in there while I'm preaching amen but we say God bless you Brothers thank you for all the work you're doing to make the believer so comfortable and make it so amen give him a hand tonight amen that's okay amen All The Tech Guys and all the audio work and amen it's just a wonderful wonderful meeting we say God bless you tonight in the book of Jeremiah the first chapter I want to look here in Jeremiah chapter 1 and verse number 4 and then we'll read in the Book of Daniel and then we want to turn to St John 15 amen Jeremiah chapter 1 and verse four the Bible says then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so this didn't happen after he was born but when he was born and he was walking or moving into the Fulfillment of an ordination upon his life then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I commanded thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth so it's not going to be Jeremiah's words it's going to be the words of the Lord see I have this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant amen I think that's powerful the word of the Lord in the mouth of a prophet is going to tear down it's going to destroy it's going to root out but then it's also going to build and it's going to plant or positionally place now in the Book of Daniel the 9th chapter The Book of Daniel uh the ninth chapter I want to read there and I want to read in the first verse of Daniel chapter 9 and verse one and you that study brother brandham you know that he'll tell us that Daniel uh is the Book of Revelation in the Old Testament in Daniel chapter 9 and verse one in the first year of Darius the son of azurus of the seed of the mes which was made King over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to jermiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I sat my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes now in the book of St John chapter 15 I know tonight that as Believers uh this scripture here is memorized in our hearts in St John chapter 15 and verse number 16 I love the words of our Lord Jesus he says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this evening I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight amen from those uh various passages of scripture I want to speak to you on this ordained to the message by the spirit amen ordained to the message by the spirit now I believe that we are living in a very special time believe we're living in an hour amen where the time has come to preach the message I believe if there's ever been a time a season an age a generation that the message of the hour ought to be taught and ought to be preached in our churches I believe now is the time to do it you know I believe that this is the time amen that by the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the word amen that the people of God are moving into higher high amen and deeper depths of the message of the hour you know I believe that the message of the hour amen is bringing a stability to the body of Christ and it is positionally placing every adopted son and daughter of God underneath the headship of the word now as ministers I believe that we are under a commission Amen to establish the people in the word amen and to establish the word in the people brother B said in Satan's edting he said the thing of it is is today he said we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts he said we are trying to establish ourselves he said the churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church amen in a person's heart but we are commanded to establish the word of God see Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words amen of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but I come to you in the power and the manifestation of the holy ghost that your faith would rest in God now I think of the words of Peter when he would say wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things amen though you know them amen and be established in present truth now listen this is the hour amen that we're not establishing the church in what God has done amen or what God is going to do amen but this is The Hour That by the preaching of the unsearchable riches of Christ we are esta establishing a generation in the present truth of what God is in the hour that we're living in you know recently I was listening to a tape and brother bradam was there and he was ordaining some brothers into the ministry does God ever change his mind about his word he actually comes to a brother here in uh 1965 he says now here does anybody know brother Merlin anthon he's new he's new to me and somebody speaks up they say oh he's with the Salvation Army brother said oh that's right I remember him sure I know him see his face didn't look familiar to me just then at this time he said now how many knows this to be a man of God he said how many believes that God is working with him raise your hand he said now how many will pray for him now listen to the prophet he said now brother we know that you're coming from a great group of people the Salvation Army they're are great people he said the Salvation Army does a great work out on the street he said we can say nothing against the Nazarene or the Pentecostal church or the Salvation Army or any of them they are our Brethren he said but you see we believe that we are carriers of a great message amen for this very hour that we're living in he said now you want to do that with us amen I find it amazing as I study several places where brother Brandon will ordain men to preach the word amen he makes it very clear and very emphatic amen that he is ordaining them to preach the message amen if if a Baptist was ordaining a Baptist he would ordain him Amen to carry Baptist Doctrine if a Pentecostal was ordaining a Pentecostal he would ordain them to carry Pentecostal Doctrine but clearly when a prophet would ordain a man amen to preach the gospel he was ordaining him Amen to preach Christ as he has been revealed amen through this end time message now I'll say this I don't believe this is the time Amen to get casual with this message I don't think this is the time amen I can't ever I can't ever speak of that without thinking of a of a of a of a of a a legacy or a amen a legendary sermon of our brother bisc he preached years ago on proven accuracy of the spoken word he said now this is not the time to become deluded with the message of the hour and you know tonight I say it's an hour where men amen are presuming and they're adventuring and they're going beyond the teachings of a prophet they're digging over into psychology and they're pulling things out of reformers and they've been going back and studying what this Theologian thought and amen trying to put it underneath the umbrella of the message amen but I say if God has called us and God has given us the grace to see and understand amen the things that we're seeing and understanding I say if there's ever been a time to die to everything else apart from the words of the seventh angel I say now is the time to do it amen education is not going to Rapture this bride theology is not going to change our bodies amen but the Revelation that is coming in this generation amen without form without fashion without any controversy of man but it's come to the church pure is the only thing that will change our bodies when I think of these things I think of how God Amen reveals things amen but he only reveals them to those who he has ordained to see them 1965 he said well that's the way Christ is himself the gospel the message is when you once see the message of the hour amen there's nothing else you can see but that that's all everything else is gone amen the rest of it is just a filler see amen when you once see the message listen when you once see the message you can't see anything else when you once hear the eagle scream you can't hear anything else let me say this I don't believe God is just calling and ordaining men to preach this message but I believe he's ordaining Bel belever amen by the spirit of Truth to carry this message he said I think if ministering Brethren today would just not take it from an intellectual standpoint but would find them a place on the backside of the desert on those sacred Sands where Satan cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief and stay there until a message comes from God and positionally places you in the ministry then all the Devils out of Torment couldn't shake you from it because you know you are caught I think each Christian ought to do that before you come out and confess the Holy Ghost confess you have the baptism there ought to be such a personal contact with God until all the intellectuals in the world Amen couldn't explain it from you because you know you've been there you've had the witness and you know it's so what is this message calling for it is calling for believers Amen to come in personal contact with God but the prophet of God said we get so sour down on theology amen till we don't know nothing about the spirit he said I hope you love me after this amen but that's what it is I mean Pentecost too that's right just shouting and dancing around amen doesn't mean you know anything about the spirit it is a personal contact face to face that's what you need he said that's the kind of church amen that God is fixing to raise up when they come together in unity in power and in spirit let me just say this I cannot help what others do amen I can't help what other preachers feel amen is important to preach to the people I cannot help what other people have done with the message amen but ask for me in my house amen I am ordained to the message of William Brandon I am ordained to say what a prophet said I am ordained to believe what a prophet T listen the prophet of God said my friends I don't want to hurt your feelings but I am responsible for for a message and that message is this come out of this mess oh Church of the Living God Amen and if I ask you to come out amen then where am I going to take you to when I take you to the brandham Tabernacle it's got as much fault as any of the rest to them but there's one place I can take you to where you're safe and protected from death and that is in Jesus Christ which is God's provided place of worship listen this message is not the car amen of you from one tradition to another it's not carrying You from One denomination to another this message is carrying you amen back to where you come from listen you didn't come from Leota so you can't stay in Leota my Bible says I have come from God and I must go back to God so God must provide something to take me back to where I come from and denomination won't do it emotions won't do it feelings won't do it but the revelation of Jesus Christ amen quickened in the soul of a Believer will carry them beyond the Realms of time and will transport them into eternity hey I believe and I believe what Jeremiah said when he said before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb amen I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet un the nation look at this word ordained it means to employ in other words before Jeremiah was born he already had a job in the kingdom of God he didn't have to go apply for a job amen he was born with a job that word ordained means to devote it means to consecrate it means to dedicate I love what the prophet of God said he said Jeremiah before he was even brought forth amen from his mother's womb God said he knew him and he Sanctified him and he ordained him a prophet over the nation before he ever come from his mother womb amen before Jeremiah ever was born amen God already knew him so that when he was born amen by the seed on the inside of him he would know the God who knew him listen I can't I can't get off my notes and preach here but I want to and then in the last days there will be a people who will know their God and they will be strong and they will do great exploits listen the world is looking for that people but tonight I'm looking at that people the world is looking for that generation who would declare the salvation of Jesus Christ but God who is rich in Mercy has allowed me to hear the voice of the seventh angel and it was not an uncertain sound it was a certain sound and here's what he said amen if you ever was a Son of God you always was a Son of God so the only thing this message is doing is Awakening you to your true identity of who you are in Jesus Christ my then you're not just here as a denominational child you are here as a child of God let me say this you have been born into the world for a specific purpose I love what the Bible says as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name listen which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God now listen most Moses had a specific purpose it was to deliver the people that were in bondage I think of Israel they had a specific purpose that their purpose brother says was that their bloodstream amen would be the cleanest for out of that would come the lineage of the Messiah let me say this the Messiah was none other than our Lord Jesus Christ who would fulfill the office of Redeemer Amen to those who would need Redemption so Jesus the Redeemer had a specific purpose Jesus said no man come to me except the father draws him first it's nothing you can do about it see Jesus didn't come to the calvary Amen to die for a haphazard purpose he didn't come there and say well maybe I'll die and it'll be so pathetic some people will see that I die and maybe they'll come and serve the Lord no Jesus come for a specific purpose to redeem those who God by forn knowledge elected to come to him to fulfill the words of the lord it's not of him that willth amen not of him that runneth but it is of god that showeth Mercy listen I don't know if you know who you are amen but you are not The Condemned of the Lord you are the redeemed of the Lord and my Bible says the redeemed of the Lord amen shall say so listen I think it's time Amen to remember we might have been born in sin we might have been shaping in iniquity but there was a soul on the inside of you and let me say this your flesh is not the real you your spirit is not the real you but you got a soul on the inside of you and that soul is the real you that's why I don't believe from my flesh I don't believe from my spirit I believe this message from my soul because it has redeemed my soul God didn't make you and I just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore is a purpose of us all being here he said you're not here just to be another human being you are here because God Amen has made you for a specific purpose you're not here just to eat the food that God growed or to live in the house that manmade or to wear the clothing that someone fashioned you are here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail on my finger is for a purpose my eye in every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose listen if it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so are y'all ready for this and if we're here for a purpose then there is nothing can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled that ought to make you shout aloud in the house of God there is nothing the devil can do to destroy you until the purpose that God sent you on the earth to fulfill has been fulfilled nothing can harm us until the purpose that God has for us has been made manifest you know what I say I say devil get out of my way get out of the Church of the Living God's way I know who I am and I know why I'm here hallelujah I'm not just here to take up space I'm here on assignments come on church amen when I flew down to New New Zealand amen I didn't get off the plane and walk around and ask where I could preach or if there was a church open or if somebody would let me say something in their puppet I came here amen under an assignment I had a specific place to go I had a specific time to be there oh Church of the Living God that's why we're not wandering through denomination because God sent a message and he sent us to an AGS to fulfill the promises of that message when God calls you when God calls you to be something brother B said if God wants you to be a certain thing he brings you to this earth to be that and you will be it well tell that devil God didn't call me here to be defeated so I ain't going to be defeated he didn't call me here to be depressed so I refused to be depressed he didn't call me here to be confused amen so I refuse to walk underneath the influence of Babylonian confusion but he called me here to be an overcomer he called me here to be a messiah hallelujah amen when God calls he calls by a Divine call I think of what Isaiah said in Isaiah 426 he said I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and will give thee for a covenant of the people amen for a light of the Gentiles I want to say this as plain as I know how God has called you and he has ordained you amen by his Spirit to this message somebody shout back message oh say it like you're awake message I know it's got an embarrassing to say it but I'm not embarrassed to say I am a follower of the message of the hour listen I know it's gotten ashamed Amen to stand behind a pull pit and read a quote but I'm not ashamed to say what a prophet said listen amen somebody say well if you say it you're going to lose your reputation news flash I don't have one so I'm a very dangerous person I don't have a reputation to keep I have been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ I have been redeemed from the hand of my enemy and God has opened my eyes to see my purpose in this age is to believe what William brandham taught on every scripture in the age I'm living in hallelujah hallelujah listen that's the dangerous thing about somebody that don't have a reputation I don't have to worry about keeping it I was a nobody when God called me I was a nobody on the Backwoods of East Tennessee amen hunting and fishing and enjoying nature but God saw fit to open my eyes to this word listen I refuse I refuse to believe anything apart from what a prophet has revealed in the age I'm living in Hallelujah somebody say you lost your mind brother Andrew I've come too far to turn back now I sitting over in my room today and just looked at the calendar and 15 years ago today I preached my very first sermon as a 13year old boy 15 years amen I've spent studying this message and listen to these tapes if you think I'm going to back up now and let some intellectual ungodly devil confuse the minds of the redeemed of the Lord you're crazy I say let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in you and whatever the word done in him it'll do the same thing in you you're here for a purpose this then is the message I love that which we have heard of him and we declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all look at this word message it is an announcement it is a promise it is the act of promising it is a promise given or to be given it is a promise good or blessing brother BR comes along and why it had to be Shepherd the high of Heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth he was bypassing all between to make himself known to Common herdsmen amen coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message Of All Times listen when God decided to declare himself on Earth he did not go to the temples and employ the rabbis he did not go to the temples and employ the lawyers and the scribes but he had already employed some Shepherds On The Backs side of the hills there had been many great Messengers we could think of Noah's day and the prophets and the great priests the Great learn men the Kings the potentates the monarchs but here comes here he comes with the greatest of all the messages what was the message are you ready for this Messiah is here now yes sir and to make that known he bypassed all the trained and made it known to Humble Shepherds now sometimes I get to studying and brother N I just get to thinking about things and sometimes I maybe get a little far out there amen but I just got to thinking one day that God had to choose some dumb old Shepherds that didn't have no education to run and tell the people Messiah is here because if he would have taken some educated men they would have made education the filter for the greatest message that ever come that the Messiah was on the earth and they would have so diluted it and watered it down to where he couldn't be the Messiah because of his background and he couldn't be the Messiah because of what city he come out of but God just found some old Shepherds that didn't have nothing better to say than just to say what a prophet said oh Church of the Living God can I tell you something amen God will bypass Aristocrats he will bypass hierarchies and he will raise up somebody on the islands of New Zealand that don't have no social standing they got a lot of stars and a lot of things against them but he's just looking for somebody who will declare the Messiah is here now in 1960s a prophet walked to a platform and he said this is my message it's different from the pastor it's different from the Evangelist he said my message my Ministry is to declare him he's here see God passed somebody's and declared the key message the greatest message by noodies somebody wonders why that we shout like we shout and why we Rejoice like we rejoice somebody told me one time brother Taz they said there's a lot of odd people around that message there's a lot of weird people around the message there's a lot of strange people and I got to thinking about that and then it dawned on me you know why because this is the only message he gives everybody chance it don't matter where you come from it don't matter what social standing what level of Education who your mama was who your daddy was there is a message that has returned us back to that day on Calvary and the cross is still Level ground for every man woman boy and child hallelujah what is this this is an announcement it is a revealing that Christ is in his church he said upon my heart the Holy Spirit has laid this warning of conviction the church in this day should have this message because I believe that it is the most outstanding of the messages of the Bible because it reveals Christ in his church at this time then no one can have faith or know what they're doing or where they're going unless they have something to base their thought and their faith upon therefore if the scripture has revealed Christ to us in these last days and the condition of the time it would do good us to search it and find out where we're at listen we are in the lay out ofan age which is supposed to receive a message but it will won't be any kind of message it will be a scriptural message as a matter of fact Malachi 4 said amen that it would be a restoration message that would turn our hearts amen back to the faith of the original fathers can I say this we are not looking for a message we have the message come on Amen it's time to Rejoice Church we're not looking for the message we are in possession of the message when you're looking for something there's no room to Rejoice but when you found what you're looking for come on I can prove it to you by the Bible and St Luke chapter 15 The Bible says a woman lost the coin and she swept the entire house and said help me find the peace that was missing while she was sweeping or looking there was no rejoicing but the very minute she found the peace that was missing her looking turned into a rejoicing there was a Shepherd who had lost a sheep and he was searching for the sheep and while he was looking there was no rejoicing but when he found the Sheep he called all of them together and said Rejoice with me for the one that I had lost has been found well let's not stop there let's go to the prodical son there was a son who was out of his position in the father's Kingdom and the father knew he was going to return and the very minute that boy broke across the hill on his way back to his father's house his father said bring the patted calf bring forth the best robe put a pair of shoes upon his feet Put a Ring upon his hand and rejoice with me it ain't time to look it's time to Rejoice it's the king's message people say why do you all say that message of the hour thank you for asking 1965 the Rapture he said many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up and make these remarks about a message of the hour and so forth what they're getting at is God's promise of this hour that what he promised he would do and we see him scripturally vindicating exactly what he said he would do in the same manner listen it foretold it hits exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it recognizing your day and it's message don't you see the message of the hour can't you recognize where we are at the message itself from the scripture interprets to you the hour that we're living in see it's the interpretation then can I say this the bride of Christ is the living interpretation of the word of God in this hour 1963 question answers on the seals brother Brandon would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture oh sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ amen certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of Christ she is consisting of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry it's a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour but it will be so humble now let me say this the message of the hour is the promise to see Jesus like you all remember zakus amen what he wanted to do he wanted to see Jesus the prophet of God said so he climbed up the tree and he got up there and he found where two limbs come together and they met in the trunk of the tree and there he sit down now that's a good place to sit see we're two ways meet yours and God's your idea and his that's a good time to sit down and take it over your own thoughts about him and what his word says He is what you think he is and what the word says He is listen that's a good place to sit down listen what the message of the hour is to your thinking what the message of the hour is to his word listen there's a big difference between the message of the hour to your thinking and the message of the hour to his word according to your thinking some have made it legalism according to your thinking some have made it condemnation and judgment and a bunch of dos and don'ts and rituals and ideas but according to God's word it is the shout of the king in the camp according to God's word it is the evening l prophesied by Zechariah according to God's word it is the quickening power of Romans chapter 8 according to God's word it is the announcing that the Rapture is in progress by the authority of the word of God listen I don't care what your thinking thinks about this message you say why because I don't care what mine thinks well we might as well preach somebody told me one time hey said brother Andrew you need to come over my house and sit down and let me share you my ideas and views on this subject and then you can go preach it I said brother save your time I ain't going to go preach it he said 'why not I said cuz I don't even preach my own views so why would I preach yours if I Don't Preach mine see I'm employed to a message I'm dedicated to a message God called me to a message I can't say nothing else but what my employer tells me to say hallelujah what do you say this message is then I'll tell what a prophet said he said we're not come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message are y'all ready for this and the message is Christ that ought to put a devil on the run right there the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're to get into it to get beneath it so we don't get above the message we get in it and we get under it we get beneath it that's what we're supposed to do see the message of the hour is this apply the token in Exodus 12 he said I will pass through the land of Egypt but I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you see pass over you because you're under the token Hallelujah amen he's got to pass over you because of what you're under Hallelujah he's got to go over your home because of what you're under he only recognizes the token that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it come on Rahab amen everything around you is coming down but brother B said this he said but anyone knows about the Bible knows that that Harlot was predestinated listen I am a firm believer that Joshua was a predestinated ordained prophet of God who sent two spies into the land of come on who sent two spies in the land amen and found rahab's house oh Church found rahab's house and said apply the token and whatever is underneath this token when the battle breaks out will be spared from destruction I love what brother says he says Rahab stopped the two spies and he said this he said Rahab she looked at him and said are you sure they said oh we're confident everything she said everything that I get underneath this token will be spared they said everything everything under oh God everything underneath that token will be spared in the hour of the war brother B said like this he said Rahab went to work she got her mama under that token she got her babies and her family everybody she could because she knew there was a destruction on its way oh Wellington New Zealand hear me tonight there's a judgment coming there's a tribulation coming but before judgment comes there's a message that has been revealed and if you can go to work and get your family and your babies and your loved ones underneath this token everything underneath this message will be spared Hallelujah I don't care how it looks right now that's the word of the Lord and I believe it Hallelujah somebody say well that's crazy he said she believed the message now I know the devil hates these kind of quotes but let's just get it out in the open William Mary and brandom the real brother brandom never taught stay home and not go to church the real brother bam never taught that hogw now come on Church brother Ben can I preach are you hearing me but men without the Holy Ghost have got a hold of quotes and misinterpret them and now they say things like see we're following Rahab who didn't have a church to go to so she just played tapes in her home so if you want to be the bride be like Rahab and just stay home and play a tape listen I know I was born at night but it wasn't last night and I'm not ignorant I know this there was no other churches for her to go to in Jericho but a devil has invaded this message and it's got entire families and churches staying home and pushing play and letting the church sit empty when they say well there's nowhere to go to that is a Lie from the pits of Hell there's people sitting at home streaming churches hundreds and thousands miles away with five churches within 20 minutes of their house I'll tell you what it is it's a lukewarm devil that's trying to squash the authority of the ministry of the Bride of Jesus Christ but on the infallibility of Hebrews 10:25 I say forsake not the assembling of yourselves together that much more as you see the day approaching come on get out of this layo of see of lukew stream of nonsense we're Sons and Daughters of God [Applause] it's a devil it's not the message it's a devil and I don't care what name we tack to it you show me one quote where brother ever T that nonsense but I'll show you hundreds where he said if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to get open he said if God is in your heart and you've been saved you won't stay home on Wednesday night and watch We Love Sushi he said you'll go to prayer meeting and you'll pray until the Holy Ghost comes in the church and changes situations that's what the real brother brandham [Applause] [Music] taught I don't know it's the message or nothing either we believe what he taught or we don't believe it at [Applause] all y'all forgive me but I guess it's the Evangelist coming out tonight get back in the house of God get off your pity party get off of your excuses get off of who didn't shake your hand and who didn't give you a cookie and who didn't invite you over for tea and get back in the house of God and begin to be what God called you to [Applause] be I think that devil got out of here we're [Music] Believers and if anybody tells you different take them back to where the Prophet said well I guess that spirit's just lingering but I'm sorry I'm not a coward I won't back up we're going to have an entire gener we're already got entire generation that don't know what it means to go to church they don't know how to be deacons oh God they don't know how to conduct a church service because a devil CRA up out of hell and has convinced this generation that the house of God is not important but if this is the last sermon I ever preach let my voice go on record and say this the house of God is the most important place you'll go for the entire week it's where you pray together it's where you shout together it's where you sing and you enjoy the blessings of Elohim I say Old Church of the Living God rise and Shake yourself and put your walking shoes on and walk back to the house of God [Applause] and back the man of God back the message of the hour this is a message it's not a playground this is a message it's not a boys club it's not a social hall it's not a community center it's a place of transformation it's more than just seeing who can out sing who and who can out preach who and who can write a better song than who it's about a place where the pillar of fire comes down and lives are changed and homes are put back together hallelujah hallelujah I believe in a good oldfashioned Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back in the church [Applause] again we know that God somebody shout amen out told me my or something but it's the truth anyhow now we know that God is perfected in threes the message my brother Andrew I would I stay home and listen why would I go to church and listen to a preacher that's got mistakes when I can stay home and listen to a prophet well obviously you ain't listen to much tapes cuz I listen to him every day of my life and he tells me over and over and over I'm a man I make mistakes I've got shortcoming either we believe it or we don't and if we don't let's get away from it but if we do let's give everything we are to it let's give everything we are to this message we know God is perfected in threes right brother says it like this he says now paraphrasing this message of the hour is going to come to us by a Vindicated Prophet which will have which will have three pools in his ministry in 1962 he says this and is this the sign of the in sir he says now is this that third poll he told me three or four years ago see the first PLL you remember what happened I tried to explain it he said don't do it the second pull he said don't try and I pulled anyhow but then he said now there's a third pull coming somebody say this with me a third pull coming there's a third pull coming but don't try to explain it you see he said now you know how I approach this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusion 1962 at the changing of the ministry he says the third pull is coming he said in paragraph 398 of the same sermon he said works that I do more than this shall you do see now watch he was in one person then but he's in the whole church now if this is the third pull then there's a great ministry line ahead I don't know I can't say I don't know so the third pull is coming there's a great ministry line ahead but in 1963 in the indictment he says may there come forth a Revival of the just and a great power come among the church just before it's going it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we're looking Lord for that third pull that we know that it will do great things for us in our midst so the third pull is coming the third pull will have a great ministry now he says we're looking for that third pull 1963 why Christ speak God give me courage to take the sword of the word that he put in my hand about 33 years ago and hold it and March forward to the third pull is my prayer so now we've gone all the way from the third pull is coming to now we have a sword in our hand and he's marching forward to the third pole but in 1963 Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says paragraph 637 of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this God Knows It But if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the second pull amen the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand now we've gone all the way from the third pull is coming to now the second pull has come to its end and the third pull is at hand look at this word at hand it means nearby it means readily accessible it means when needed amen it is close in time I love this one brother Chris it means it's about to happen so when a prophet announces the third pull is at hand he's saying it's about to happen Daniel 12:4 thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased in Revelation 13 blessed is he that readeth they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand Revelation 22:10 he saith unto me seal not the Saints of the prophecy of this book listen for the time is at hand in Daniel 12 he was told to seal it up until the time of the end but in Revelations 1 and 22 he says this the time is at hand brother BR picks this up in the church age book he said now the time was not at hand previous ly but in the wisdom and the economy of God the mighty Revelation though fully known to God could not come forth hither to he said thus we immediately learn a principle that the revelation of God for each age can only come in that age and at a specific time listen I'll say it like this a specific time to a specific people comes at a specific Revelation to accomplish a specific work look at the history of of Israel the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time in history and even more specifically it came as the people Cried unto God Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead but in this age leonos the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter and neither will it be premature think on this and heed it way for we are in the end time today now look here the third pull is at hand how can I overcome 63 paragraph 31 he says I can feel that the third pull is beginning to move you see within me Look Away to Jesus 63 paragraph 38 so now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is the thing we've looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is let me say this only the spiritual will catch the third pull he goes on to say everyone knows that he said the third pull is properly identified we know where it is oh God I love this the third pull is here Church of the Living God we've gone all the way from the third pull is coming to now he says the third pull is here he said it's so safe I mustn't say much about it now watch the third pull then see It'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church hallelujah hallelujah the third pull is to the lost but it's for the bride listen Church there is no more doubt in my mind he says I know what the third pull is and I know what it does Shalom 64 he said the one time he said about the third pull how it would come by this one way then by knowing the heart and then the spoken word the first pull was to deal with the healing of the flesh the second pull was the Discerning of the spirit but when you come to that third pull it was going beyond the flesh it was going beyond the spirit the third pull come to the soul oh we all know that's the identification he says we know what the third pull is we all understand that you got your tape see I think it'll lay dormant for a little while until that great hour of persecution comes on that's when it'll be it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure now let me just go ahead and go all the way to the end of the message and not stop if that's okay what is or the anointed ones at the end time rather notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull is healing the second pull is prophesying but the third pull is the opening of the word it's the Mysteries revealed and there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way he can be Vindicated is by the word and remember and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word can I just go ahead and cut to the Chase and get it out there in the open is that okay the third pull is the message you were not ordained to a first pull you were not ordained to a second pull you was ordained to a third pull which was the opening of the word the revealing of the mysteries of God he said so I've Got My Mind Set On this message that's that third pull it's the one I must be loyal and reverent to what is the message friends it is the opening of the word in the church and by the power of the Revelation you are being transformed into the bride by the word brother B said here you are not years later you're just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well it's God manifested in flesh amen now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh these two are one the church is becoming the bride by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same it's the word in the church that's making it the Bride come on friends it's not the church you go to that makes you the bride it's not the preacher you follow that makes you the bride what makes you the bride is the word the word in the flesh redeemed flesh transforming you into the word bride of God now I love in 1961 comes along and he preaches a series to us in three Parts you all got the books I know he calls it Daniel 70 weeks he said now the first part is going to be Gabriel's instructions to Daniel you all familiar with that series let me see your hands you're familiar with Daniel 70 weeks he said see the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel and then the last one was the 7eventh week of Daniel now when he opens that series he says we're speaking on Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying in to instruct him about the future my goodness while Daniel was in prayer Gabriel the Angel come in to instruct him now brother B said this he said I am Desiring an understanding he says not to be puffed up but what he was wanting was he was wanting Revelation to Enlighten the people of the future by the word are you with me the revelation of the message is the enlightening of the church of the future by the word it's not by charts it's not by eschatology teachers he said see I've been visiting the library in Kentucky some of those ancient astronomy of the calars and times and picking up from libraries and so forth all the ancient books that I can what little I can do in having my trust solemnly in Christ Jesus to reveal it to me because I do not want it to say I know this and I know that he knows my heart but I want it that I might Enlighten his people therefore or I believe he will give it to me I remember one time there was a guy a preacher and then he was on his way out of the message and he was doing everything he could to tear the message down you know everybody could get to listen he had something to say so one day he made the mistake AC crossing my path he said well brother Andrew he said I'll tell you right now he said one of these days you're going to find out amen that brother brandom studied Matthew Henry and Clark and all these commentaries and it's going to blow your mind he said you don't know that but one day you will I said brother I already knew that he kind of jumped back and he looked at me kind of bug eyed he said how did you know that I said cuz I got books and tapes where brother Bram told me he'd done that himself hello he says right here I'm going to libraries to find what I can on Daniel 70 weeks but beyond the education I am ried on spiritual Revelation to come into my heart and reveal to me the word of God what is this Revelation no matter how complicated it is God can break it down and he can make it so simple I love to study about Daniel do you all know that Daniel was about 12 or 14 years old when he went into captivity the Bible says in Daniel 18 but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat brother comes along in Investments and says Daniel was a prophet he said the words of God the Bible was invested to Daniel to manifest to the people that God still lived and Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile his investment so God ordained Daniel Hallelujah God ordained Daniel as a child before he was born to receive the investment of the word of God concerning the future of Israel through the prophet Jeremiah's message oh Church of the Living God list it's a parallel Daniel's day parallels our day see where Daniel was he was in Babylon which you know what Babylon means it means confusion remember said like this he said here we are privileged tonight to see the message of God and the angel of God in the day of confusion he said we're living in a day of confusion we're living in a day that when men and women hardly know what to do he said everything seems to be in a turmoil everything it seems to be there's so many ways to look he said that Satan to do that now amen y'all forgive me but brother Chris tried to get out of here easy this morning but I'm just going to go and read a quote okay American and Canadian people are the worst confused people in all the [Applause] world God bless you Buddy ain't going to put all that on us Americans I'm just kidding I'm going to find one on New Zealand I guarantee you I will the worst of all the confus now come on Church you all know that's the truth men going in women's bathrooms and women going in men's bathrooms and all of a sudden we live in a day and time where a baby can be born and live 15 years nature says it's a boy mama says it's a boy daddy says it's a boy science says it's a boy come on everything identifies that child as a boy but some morning he wakes up and says I think I'm a girl you see what's happening it's because it's a day of confusion what's happening is is God is bringing things to an end but before he oh God before he brings it to an end he forewarns now there's different ways that he gives us to Mark the times like if you look at lot amen lot marked it by Angels if you look at Abraham he marked his time by the visitation of the Angel of the Lord Elohim if you looked at Rahab she marked her by Messengers if you look at Noah he marked his by Revelation but if we'll slow down here and read in in Daniel 9:2 it says this in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books I Daniel understood by books the number of years look at this word understand it means to discern to distinguish to consider diligently amen the years the Lord the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet he he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face un the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and asked by Angels Abraham by Elohim Rahab by Messengers Noah by Revelation but Daniel by books is this okay Daniel discerned the Times by the books he was reading and those books was moving him am to desperation said when the vision came in BC 538 from 606 Le 68 years he had been in Babylon amongst heathens and still had the victory my goodness 68 years in a heathen Empire but Daniel still had the victory by the books he was reading oh Church of the Living God hey you got some books you know what they're called they're called spoken word books they're called a seven seal book They're called a church age book They're called an adoption book listen friends we're in the middle of Leona but I want to put that devil on notice I have not lost the victory I still have the victory in my soul hey Daniel stood alone but he had some books 68 years he was undefiled before God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost with without the blood of Jesus Christ to make intercession for him with only the blood of bulls and goats and heers listen in Heathen Traditions Daniel no church to go to no songs to sing but Daniel the Prophet of the Lord would consult Jeremiah's books and if the church listen he said oh what a shame it is to us he said those books caused Daniel to go into prayer and supplication he said now listen he said how can spend wasteless time gambling swiming holes on Sunday I know this ain't popular preaching no more but it's still in the message no time for the Lord just run down and if the pastor speaks on something or other you don't like you just get up and go out if the church holds too long while you're dissatisfied look at our condition look at what we're doing and compare our life with Daniel no church no Fellowship was Tor down and burned down his City and his people was captive but for 68 years he held the victory by laying in Jeremiah's books oh Church see before I I want you to catch this before Daniel went into captivity there was a Prophet Jeremiah who was ordained to bring a message and brother tazwell there was a day in who was ordained to receive the message Jeremiah was ordained to bring B said like this he said this he said see in Jeremiah in Jeremiah CH 25:3 I will bring upon that land of all my words which I pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations now listen friends amen God smoked that now now you all know that there was a true Prophet right and whenever there's a true Prophet there's always a false prophet that comes behind the true prophet and now there was a false prophet followed Jeremiah and he says this he said listen he said don't you all worry he said God told me amen listen God done told me that what Jeremiah said ain't right B said but God smoke that false prophet and took his life that same year because God had told his true Prophet that there was 70 years now I just want you I just want you to catch something with me okay okay are you with me Daniel is in captivity and he goes before the Lord to receive a revelation concerning his future and he does it but when he goes before the Lord bam said this he says Gabriel appeared to reveal not only what he was asking about but to tell him all the way down what was determined for the Jewish race all the way to the consummation don't you all love studying a prophet brother he says this he said he asked ask a little bit are y'all ready for this Daniel went before God and ask a little bit but he got the whole thing some of y'all can Shout with me on this point you remember when you got saved you were just looking for salvation you were just looking for a better way to live you were just looking to get free from tormenting spirits and free from your first na and listen you weren't looking for all these things but there was a seed in your soul and you just said God save me and Deliver Me From The Wretched Man I am but God who is rich in Mercy he didn't just give you a little bit he gave you Seven Seals he gave you the serpent seed he gave you predestination he gave you the seven trumpets he gave you the seven Church ages he revealed the Seven Stars in the right hand of God oh Church of the Living God if anybody got a rightous shout is the Bride of Jesus Christ we just asked for a little bit but we got the whole [Music] thing Glory Glory Glory we got the whole thing church we got the whole word and when Daniel received that my goodness when Daniel received that I love what the Bible says the Bible said Jeremiah made them drink in other words Jeremiah I give you this message but don't you sit still don't you stay in one place but prophesy to all the nations you see he just put the word out there and it made them all mad at him now notice Here We Go Again Jeremiah didn't stay home Jeremiah didn't just stay in one little spot but he made all the nations to drink of it now what was he making them drink of the wine of the word listen and Daniel drank it I love this and Jeremiah took the word of the Lord the wine of his word and the wine is the power of His word see wine has a power and wine is an intoxication it's got a power behind it so Daniel was in captivity looking at all these Heathen Traditions no Fellowship no blood No sacrifice no Fellowship to go to no songs to sing but he had some books and Daniel got to drinking and eating on those books you know what the Bible says the Bible says he got drunk on the wine of Jeremiah's message now now come on friends you know what I believe it's time to do for the Church of the Living God I think it's time to get drunk again you want to fix some problems in your church just get everybody drunk well Glory Glory Glory you want to fix some marriages just get the husband drunk and get the wife drunk come on I believe in counseling but there's things we can't counsel and fix but there's things the Holy Ghost can come into the church a living God and somebody gets so intoxicated on the power of the Holy Ghost listen if you ever get a man drunk he loves everybody if you ever get a man drunk he loves his enemies he loves his neighbors he loves his workers he loves his husband he loves his wife oh come on church if you ever get drunk on the Holy Ghost it'll cause you to love everybody somebody say I don't like the pastor well just get drunk one time I don't like the musicians just get drunk one time I don't like the song leader he SS too fast he sings too slow just get drunk one time and you'll love everybody in the church well I feel good brother I feel good in the house of God you know why because I ain't a cold formal starching intellectual believer I am a fully intoxicated Holy Ghost filled fire baptized Pillar of Fire following message of the hour preaching son of the Living God hallelujah hallelujah I hate to ask this brother it's getting cold up here if we can turn these fans off it' be great I'm coming to a close wine is the stimulation of Revelation so when a man gets drunk there's a power oh God that comes behind that intoxication in other words what he's drinking on will make him 10 foot tall and Bulletproof y'all know what I'm talking about amen just get a man drunk one time he's ready to fight everybody is that a paradox brother get him drunk he's ready to love everybody and get him drunk he's ready to fight everything I'm going somewhere you know what else you know what else you know what else getting drunk will make a man do it'll make him start claiming things I've never been drunk I've just heard this I'm just preaching off a off of secondhand information but apparently is true because I've seen some people tell me it was true seen a man one I better not get into that I'll just say this amen you get a man drunk he'll be in somebody else's house and you know what he'll do he'll start claiming something that's not even his get him so intoxicated brother Tony you know what he'll say he'll say that's my refrigerator that's my couch that's my truck that's my y'all know what I'm talking about you know why because he's lost the ability he's lost his senses he got drunk on something and it took him Beyond his human senses oh Church of the Living God I pray tonight we'll pass the bottle around until we get so drunk on the Holy Ghost will'll go to Sayan that's my joy that's my healing that's my peace that's my baby that's my marriage that's my church that's my home that's my sanity Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I adure Thee by the intoxication of the power of the word of God in the age we're living in hallelujah hallelujah are y'all ready for this get a man drunk and he'll begin to believe things he can do that in reality he can't but when he gets intoxicated it's a whole another story remember one time my great-grandfather picked me up from school one day and we was leaving the elementary school I went to it was right across the road from a liquor store we sitting there in the car we just waiting to pull out and there was this little old lady I mean man she's probably 85 years old bu her heart she come walking out there and brother she had two big old arms full of brown paper bags only the Lord in heaven knows what was in those bags but they were full of some intoxication brother F she come walking out there I never forget as long as I live Grande looked over at me he said now son he said here's what's going to happen she going to go home and drink all that and she going to get drunk and she going to lay in the floor and she's going to look at that wall and she's going to say I'll climb it if it takes me all night I said really he said because intoxication church are you hearing me you know what I say I say it's time to pass the wine again we've been looking at things and we've been saying I can't I can't I can't I can't but if you get drunk one time you'll look at that mountain and say I'll climb you if it takes me all my life we've laid down and said I can't take the Rapture I can't overcome I can't believe this message but I say to you tonight hear ye the word of the Lord there is a stimulation of Revelation there is an intoxication of the holy ghost in the house of God it'll cause you to get drunk till you believe things that you don't think will ever [Music] happen what are you saying preacher I'm saying God oh my I've run out of time God opened the revelation of Israel's future through a prophet's message Jeremiah and he ordained a 12 14y old boy the Bible says he put this treasure in earn brother said do you see what God did he never revealed it to the hind prudent so they could fuss about it all this time but he put it in an Earthly vessel and he created himself his own son Christ Jesus and in the last days now he's opening the and showing it to his church kept it in an Earthly vessel so it wouldn't rot or rust listen it's been kept wrapped in the vessel of the earth that was redeemed out of the Earth come up on Easter morning where death seals couldn not hold him any longer but he broke the seals and Rose up and prove himself in the last days he's alive he's in his church and in this last days he's revealing it by his own presence among his people he got somebody he can get the world out of and the things out of the church anty out of so he can speak through them and reveal and open these seals listen just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things I've run out of time but can I could I could I buy five minutes 10 minutes would that would that honestly be okay Revelation and understanding has come to you and has made you a prophetic class of people let me say this understanding brother says this in the last days we're given the understanding by the word that we're going to understand it because it'll come an Ephesian to it now brother B goes in this he says I understand there'll come scoffers in the last days I understand there'll be tidle waves in the last days I understand there'll be fearful sights I understand organization women will Bob off their hair in the last days they'll wear short clothes and walk with highill shoes tinkling as they go in the last days I understand the morale will be very low in the last days understand that preachers will be false shepherds in the last days and they'll compromise will not feed the people the word of God but will'll go after Creeds and things instead but I understand there'll come a voice in the last days crying out of the Wilderness calling the people back to the original message back to the things of God I understand by the books these things will take place listen friends you're not here as just church members you are here as people who have come underneath the influence of prophetic word you say influence yes sir brother B said this he said we could just give you scripture after scripture see the last stage is a prophetic message to the church calling them back to the original word will you agree with me we have come under prophetic utterance can I say this as clear as I know how we are not going back to the second pull hello we're not going backwards Church we're going forward why would we go back to the permissive will when we have the perfect will the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has began as he had declared rather to his servants the prophets he said now to this to do this is prophetic utterance of the spirit that foresees what will be what has been and what is now brother said this when prophetic utterance comes you see now now how many will obey prophetic utterance he said you see well if I told you to put that crutch on his shoulder and he would not have done it he had have went right back out there just as crippled went back home in a worse shape than he was when he come see it always does that just what the inspiration says do what the holy spirit is giving that prophetic utterance if it surely knows your life and who you are and knows what you have been it'll know what you will be can I say this this Prophet has already been in your future he's already been in your future he says I believe that I was born as a prophetic utterance many people call it one thing or another I don't know what it is he said don't have to be anything called anything but just so it gets the results for the Lord Jesus and his people listen prophetic utterance come underneath the fourth anointing which was the eagle the prophetic age listen when God would lead his people by prophetic utterance now let me say this to you when prophetic utterance comes in the church it brings a real change in other words things look hopeless situations look permanent Journeys look like they have final destinations decisions look like they can never be changed but I'm reminded the valley of dry bones I'm reminded that Ezekiel walked out there and he looked across this entire valley of dry bones brother Taz it looked final brother Isaac it looked like it was over it looked like it was the end but but Ezekiel walked out there and he said Can these bones live again Lord thou knowest son of man prophesy prophesy upon these bones brother said this oh God hallelujah prophesy look look at this word prophesy bring these bones under the influence of a Divine Spirit can these bones live again prophesy and as I began to prophesy there come a great noise there come a great shaking look what he said he said that breath come into them he said what was the breath it was the fourth message of life it was the light that will bring forth the same signs what was it it was the light of God see friends what I'm saying to you tonight tonight is if you come underneath the prophetic utterance of this message can I say it to you very plain you've been commissioned I'm not going to read it to you I'm just going to preach it real quick okay you've been commissioned to eat the book and in eating the book you've been commissioned to prophesy again to speak forth by divine inspiration you know I find it amazing we live in a day and time where everybody wants to prophesy everybody wants to prophesy yay I say unto thee yeah I say unto thee and you know brother Bram actually come along and he said like this he said uh prophecy tongues interpretation he said it will not be the repeat now yall know these quotes he said it will not be the repeating of vain scriptures or vain vain repetition of scripture over and over and over he said it will be a direct message he said now that message has to be judged before it can be given so if a tongue's interpretation comes forth brother according to brother brandom now I'm just preaching the message he said it has to be judged before it can be given to the church he said if it don't come to pass and you got a lying devil among you and he said you need to cast it out but you know what tonight since everybody wants to prophesy okay we're going to have prophetic class you ready brother Ben can I have my Liberty all right I'm getting ready to teach you how to prophesy are you ready you got your notebooks and your pens and your pencils I'm getting ready to teach you how to prophesy brother okay here it comes go listen to a tape and then go tell somebody what you heard on [Applause] it it don't have to be judged it's the word of the Lord come on Hatty RS you're sitting there and your boys are on the other side of the wall and they're laughing at a prophet of God but he said as I stood there and begin to tell her and tell them what happened on the mountain he said the anointing changed it went from an anointing to a super anointing he said it swept in there oh church of living God Amen I'm I'm done on this I love what he says he says it's swept in there and he says this he said I looked at her and I said he's Jehovah Gyra brother said this he Jehovah Gyra said that I said that he said that little humble woman for the first time ever happened the third pull upon a human being listen when I said only thing I I know he is still Jehovah Gyra she come underneath prophetic utterance you know what she said she said that ain't nothing but the truth are you hearing me she was saying the same thing that had already been said are y'all hearing me and when she begin to say what had already been said brother said that super anointing come in there I love these words he said the Creator come in the Creator came in there brother FY hears a wall and on the other side of that wall is two boys They're laughing at a prophet of God they're making fun of the story but when their mama said that ain't nothing but the truth the same Creator who met Abraham up on the mountain come down there to William brandham in the turkey and the in the squirrel Woods you know where it went it went right into that room where hady RS two boys were listen there was nothing there to reverence the word of God but but when the Creator come in the room when the Creator stepped in there the Creator put a desire in them boys' Hearts to believe God may I say this to you tonight the preaching of the message of the hour has brought the third pull into this meeting here tonight I don't know what you have need of but hady right you're in position to speak the word and to believe that what you say will come into existence won't you stand your feet tonight and give God praise you're in position by the message of the hour I got to studying that one day Church sitting there in my little office studying that heard brother say this he said when that super annoying come in that room he said it felt like the room was coming apart I'm the guy that stops IT and rewinds it listens to it again when that supern and come in the room felt like the room was coming apart I said Lord there's something in that so I rewel it again when that super anointing come in the room there and all those things were happening felt like that room was coming apart I said oh there it is House of Hell House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ Church what is this message it's the manifestation of the name of God in the age we're living in listen brother said this he said they're all out there hollering Jesus he said but they're not getting anything he said because under the open of the Seven Seals are you with me he he said the name of God has now become interpreted Church we're not just holler in Jesus our musicians are coming tonight we're ordained ordained to this message listen friends I don't know about you but I I have to say from my heart I'm ordained to say what the prophet said [Applause] can I say this you're ordained to believe what a prophet said this is your hour this is your season you said brother Ander things aren't changing do you realize things are changing when you don't know they're changing do you know things are happening right here in this meeting and you may not see it feel it but according to the message of the hour brother man would leave thousands of meetings and he would say this he would say Pastors in the the days to come you're going to hear testimonies of what God has done months and years after I'm gone Church of the Living God you know why because it wasn't him it was the prevailing Revelation that had been restored to the church let me say this God just needs somebody to say what a prophet said God just needs somebody to call these this message these promises present tense God needs somebody God needs a young person to stand up and say this is more than a religion this is more than something daddy preaches or mama taught me this is god this is my hope this is my future I don't know how else to say that than this break open the books [Music] again break them open he said brother Andrew I don't I don't I just don't think things can change the doctor said well can I say this what does the third pool say about it do we do do do we believe or do we just take the doctor's word as the final say something you know I say this God just needs somebody to preach this message somebody say well I tell you right now by the preach of the message things can't change hey you've come too late to tell us that several years ago brother brother Wayne Lawson was over in Norway preaching and while he was preaching he would standing there and somebody say well people I guess I'm just feeling too much at home right now but people say people say some really let me be correct with this they say some really silly things they say like you can't preach the depths of the message and Powerful things happen in the church you're getting too intellectual well brother Wayne stands there and just reads the scripture there's a seven stars in the right hand that names all six of them and he says now let's come down here to the seventh one and he says oh here it is he said it's a man named William brandom and he said ever devil in hell hates that name hates that name being mentioned because the devil knows that is the Fulfillment of just preaching the identification of the seven star and a woman sitting there with leukemia said amen she just said amen and when she said amen the leukemia left her body come on hands wasn't laid on her but somebody was preaching the message few years ago I was out in Cloverdale at brother bisc preaching on a Wednesday night just standing there preaching on the third pull and the word of God in the church and I didn't know brother Murphy Wong's daughter was sitting there brother Murphy daughter and her husband there was sitting there I didn't know him from nobody I was just preaching the word and I said you know when God come down in a prophet's voice and spoke those squirrels into existence I said he didn't come down there and say abracadabra abadoo I rub my hand over this squirrel residue and make a squirrel out of you I said he didn't do that there was no squirrel DNA there but he spoke the word and when he spoke the word god backed up the word and creation by the spoken word brought curls into existence I just stood there and said that same gge in this building right here tonight next year I went back little I know that when I said that brother Murphy's daughter was sitting there and her and her husband had been Desiring a child and hadn't been having to have a baby and they went to the doctor and the doctor said you'll never have a child without having a surgery said there's something missing in your body and you won't be able to have a child brother brother brother Murphy told me the testimony he said they went through a prayer line and they believed God was their healer but this was the powerful thing that just got me I said brother Murphy amen he said do you know what happened I said I don't have a clue what happened he said well last year when you said that on Wednesday night he said my daughter went home and she believed if God Did It for squirrels he could do it for her he said the next morning she took a pregnancy test he said and she came to Camp with a positive pregnancy test he said brother Andrew right there's the baby without a surgery but the third pull come among the church and somebody remembered it was more than just a cliche it was God fulfilling his word oh I say here tonight the same God is right here in this building I don't know what's missing but I know what God can do he can put something there I'm not a crazy man I believe this message I've seen people Changed by the preaching of this message several years ago I there I don't know why I'm testifying but I'm just here brother Ben several years ago out at Mall's Youth Camp I was standing there preaching on a Friday night it was outside like a like an outdoor tent type setting brother it was just it was it was a hot I mean it was ringing wet
