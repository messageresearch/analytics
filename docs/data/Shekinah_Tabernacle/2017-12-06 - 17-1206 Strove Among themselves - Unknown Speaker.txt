word tonight and we just want to commit the service of your hands in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen amen musicians I mean good evening everyone good to have have father Mario and by the Unown here god bless you I mean trust you when you go hunting you'll you'll bring home something big I hope you have a blessed time down south I mean let's just go to the scripture let's go to Luke chapter 22 and let's read from verse 19 and it's hot I can't do much about it at this point but just bear with me a min it'll be fine so here in Luke 22 and verse 19 it says and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this doing remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed now watch this and they began to enquire among themselves which one of them it was that should do this thing and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest my Lord blesses word you may have your seats this night but of a very odd if you if you look at the arrangement of of Luke I've been reading through the Gospel of Luke and it's amazing there's such a contrast and many things you read yeah we were on Sunday about Jesus coming up into Jerusalem on the back of you know a bank of the back of the donkey prophecy is being fulfilled the people are crying out Hosanna listen he that comes the name of the Lord and the great and the great excitement of the people and the atmosphere that would have been there as as the king was coming into a city and but then when Jesus when we when man was looking at they thought what an incredible triumphal entry but they said when Jesus beheld the city he wept over it saying if you only knew the days of your peace but it's hidden from you so that's such a contrast and then we come down to where Jesus's is in his last last you could say day or two maybe I think last day upon the earth and his earthly ministry he's breaking the bread it says they came to the Last Supper they had supper before this they had the Passover before this but this was the last one that we're gonna have in this way and he's breaking the bread and he's saying this is my body which is given for you and this is this cup is the New Testament in my blood and drink it as you often as remember me and then he they kind of turns from from the saying the one that's going to betray me is at the table with me yeah imagine the atmosphere would have turned he's talking about these things with his disciples the last few moments he's upon the earth in his body and they begin to strive among themselves which one will be the greatest and you know the last few moments they're going to be with them it's gonna be done it's gonna be happy it's gonna go right by it's gonna be finished and they're worried about who's going to be the greatest such a such a contradiction you know but people are always people you know I was thinking about this today I read this on Monday I've been I've been pondering on it for a while you know they were worried about who would be the greatest and it's amazing because here was the resurrection and the life and he was he was sitting among them I am the resurrection and the life you know he said to Mary and Martha there before Lazarus to and he said believe without us and here he was he is going to carry the sins of the world upon his shoulder carry them up to Calvary amen in the eternal life that was in it was going to be released I mean by the shedding of his blood his life was going to be really be released upon his disciples I mean incredible things were going to happen and they were getting caught up and who's going to be the greatest and I just say among us even even tonight I mean we have the greatest thing that's ever struck the earth I'm in the second part of Redemption I mean where God as God has taken the lamb has taken the book of of of Redemption he's taken our inheritance a man he's taken the seals off the book where once upon a time no man was even worthy to look upon the book amen but then now it's not it it's because of his blood has changed it instead of you would you know worth it even look upon it now you've got to become one with it I mean you've got to manifest the contents of the book hallelujah so now it's it's an incredible hour they were living an incredible hour I know it's very hot but don't fall sleep on me I'm in there living an incredible hour here was the power of God was going to be released I mean for a sacrifice through the blood of the Lamb that the people would live above sin I mean I live above their tradition they live above their first breath hallelujah that have that have that have power over their own nature that they were born with I mean you want to see a miracle you see a man or a woman a boy or a girl they can live above sin they can live about their first nature I mean that this flesh can be in subject to the Spirit of God that's within them that's a miracle friends that's a great miracle I mean where a person can yield themselves and give themselves hallelujah that this flesh and then their nature that they inherited I mean doesn't dictate their life but eternal life dictates to them how they're gonna live and how they interacted how they can respond to things hallelujah this was being released and this is about in a few moments they were going to go to the garden and they were tired and weary they they didn't fully catch what was going on prophecy was being fulfilled right in front of their eyes amen but they were missing it and not worried about who would be the greatest it games about who's the greatest amen you think about what's been what's being delivered to us well it's being delivered to them I mean where where God would God would release a power amen we're now to me you read the book of Acts and the Holy Ghost coming I mean a Peter standing up and saying ye men of Judea and yo you mean of Israel then we're not drunk as he supposed that being but the third out of the day but this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel I mean he could identify the prophecy being fulfilled in his life he could identify what was going on in the scripture hallelujah and they had dominion I mean the the government couldn't control them the religious power couldn't control them demon power couldn't control them hallelujah I mean nothing could control these people now because they'd been changed I mean so what Jesus is saying this is my body which I'm good at yours gonna be given for you this is the New Testament in my blood I mean this is this is the will this is the new will I mean that's in my blood it's gonna be released to you hallelujah that now I can live out of you amen you think of Moses are standing on Mount Sinai with a I trust when you when you listen to the message when you read the Bible when you when you read about the inheritance has been laid up you know I trust it means a great deal where everything the prophets us everything Adam lost has been restored I mean everything that Adam lost has been restored to you hallelujah he was he had dominion over the earth I mean he was a god over this earth hallelujah he you know he could speak to nature nature obeyed him amen he was he was the boss they meant the first Adam demonstrate I mean the second adam demonstrated everything the first one lost a mentor said it was now and now in hands of of a man it was a god man and then now then it wasn't just enough for the second adam to be you know four for the man to be restored the woman's got to be restored there's going to be a second Eve upon the earth and the Prophet tells us the first thief was predestinated to fall but the second Eve will not fall I mean she's predestinated not to fall that means she's been predetermined she will not fall to the Satan's lie I mean she will not listen to the Serpent's hiss I mean I pay attention to what he's saying but she'll turn him down hallelujah just as the first one accepted the live was deceived I mean the second one will see him for what he is and will turn down his lie hallelujah hey man this is this is incredible I'm in Alexander the Great he conquered he conquered as far as he could conquer to the east he went into northern India and his troops he will go no further he conquered everyone that he came against and he died a drunk or whatever in Babylon at the age of 32 whatever it was I mean he died to feed it he couldn't conquer his own self great generals couldn't conquer the earth they couldn't conquer the passions of this flesh I mean they couldn't they couldn't overcome their own selves but here comes a man at the age of 33 hallelujah he didn't just conquer the hell the death and the grave he conquered himself I mean because he yielded himself to the word that was allotted to him amen he is not my will but thy will be done and he says amen as because I live you shall live also amen you'll you'll live the same kind of life hallelujah amen we have an incredible God as God has given us an incredible promise he's given us incredible covenant hallelujah the thing about I think I mentioned Moses very briefly Moses is standing on Mount Sinai you read Deuteronomy you can feel the burden that he has this is his last few moments his last church service he's going to preach to these people that he's led that he delivered them out of Egypt God used him to deliver them out of Egypt he's lead them 40 years in the wilderness and here he is there wouldn't be another Sunday after this one there wouldn't be another church service yeah Deuteronomy was was one service basically he with me he stood there on you know there there by the mountain he is going to go up and die on and he preaches the book of Deuteronomy to them you can feel the burden I feel on his heart I mean cleave to the Lord your God this day choose you this day who are you gonna serve he says if he take the idols of the people of the lands Amen they will basically you'll be taken out of the land and he has a burden and he's delivering his lost his last service he received the law out of God wrote it with his own finger he received the law on Mount Sinai he received a word a minute he sprinkle he took the blood of bulls and goats he sprinkled the book and the people and enjoying them together saying this is the this is the Covenant that God has written by his own finger and he's gonna join it to you I mean then when you go into the land that you'll live I mean this word out I mean that be a burden Joshua had a great burden I mean he was commissioned I mean to take the people into the land but then he had the same kind of burden I felt when he gave us last church service he's now I'm now old and shook at an age choosie this day who you'll serve there would have been a great burden imagine if you had the last opportunity to address the people and you've seen God live and you've seen them come down and do incredible things and quick in his word I mean to people and see its word become manifest in people's lives and see prophecy being lived out right in front of you and now it was your turn to move off the scene amen and someone else had to take your place you'd have a burden what would be your last service if you could tell your family I mean because we know parents preach their children and mothers of the fifth gospel you know the Prophet tells us what would be your last service service mums if you had one last opportunity to speak to your children if you knew this was the last day you had upon the earth what would you share with them what would you preach to them I mean I trust you'd stand there and say well there's mostly boys boys five to one you'd say Oh daughters you'd say children Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a true and living God there's no other God beside him he's not a fable we do not follow some a can link devise fable of man we serve the true and living God and he came down and made his word real to me and show to showed himself to me that I'm not a God of history and he's present here among us amen and he's quick and his word to my soul and I'm going to go to heaven one of these days and I believe you are going to come with me serve this God I mean you'll never you'll never regret it I mean Moses no doubt if he could have if I could put words in his mouth he would say I never regretted leaving Egypt I never regretted leaving the throne room and having one last look of that throne and walking out of that palace amen to be identified with a bunch of slaves I never regretted it hallelujah Paul could have said the same thing I never regretted leaving the feet of Gamaliel I meant to follow this Lord Jesus Christ I never regretted a Timothy it's worth it all stir up the gift that's within thee Timothy amen we said the true and living God I've got a crown of life hallelujah C the disciples I'm trying to bring a great big contrast here they are God's gonna unite himself it's not enough for God to be with you he's got to be in you he's got to be dwelling in you permanently that's why he died on Calvary that's why he that's why I send this message upon the earth brother Graham says that the Holy Ghost is released through this evening message hallelujah I happen to believe it amen so now this is the purpose he sent Elijah to turn our hearts back to the original faith and the original faith produced God dwelling in a people hallelujah amen sir Timothy no doubt Paul would say the incidents that he did say be incident season out of season a mint take this word live this word let it manifest in you it's worth all the rejection it's worth all the misunderstanding it's worth all the resentment it's worth all all of the pain the hardship whatever it is you've got to take the worse that the your the best the devil can give you and take the worst that God can give you and the worst that God can give you not that he can ever give you a bad thing but I'm trying to give you a contrast as far greater than the best the devil could ever give you I mean because because the most richest people in all the world it comes to a moment that stops beating and then what where am I now they can have the greatest doctors and all the land but they come to a point say we can't help you anymore and then what where are we gonna go we were gonna go from here we have nowhere to go from here sir ma'am we can't do anything for you what do you mean have you tried this yes we'll try this what about this no we can't do that why can't you do that we haven't researched it yet what do you mean what about this no we can't do it oh we have the greatest thing we God has taken a people God has taken a people in you to say he's taken me he's called me Abraham was just an orderly ordinary person the Prophet said he's just an ordinary man but then God called him and that's what made the difference hallelujah it's not how much we learn even though study you learn absorb something you're going to absorb something I'd rather be absorbing this then all absorb I mean something in the news it doesn't really matter I'd rather be absorbing something that can actually live hallelujah so absorb all you can I mean but he's got to come and make it live hallelujah he's gonna come and make it live so here they were striving but here was Jesus here was Jesus saying here's the Covenant this is the reason I'm here this is why I gathered you I'm joining myself to you you're my children hallelujah what an age to be alive and brother bram said that the death bear resurrection of jesus christ was the greatest week in history just stay with me for a few more moments and it's okay now we live in an age that was the beginning of redemption you know we're going to live under the inspiration given for our our I mean we can't go back into Luther's day and live under the just the inspiration of just shall live by faith that's being lived out we can't go back to the Weasly in time and live by sanctification only only I mean that inspiration was poured out we can't go back there I mean we can't go back to Azusa Street Pentecost I mean that inspiration has been poured out but we're living in another season that's all God doing the work and then we still need the supernatural amen but God has opened his word to us he's opened his covenant to us hallelujah and it's and it's amazing when when you see God come to you has he come to you I probably asked us every service but I trust you can say yes he's actually come to me and he's revealed himself to me I mean I remember when when when I think I mentioned a few Sundays ago how how I was talking to my darling soon-to-be wife on the phone she says I want to know about the Seventh Seal and I hung up the phone and about three scriptures came to came straight away and I'm gonna read them let's go to look let's go to second Thessalonians we'll just read one and I'll show you something here oh no we'll go to to go to revelations chapter three as well because what is it the Seventh Seal is we understand is the wind up it's the end of time by the band scissors like a rocket going up and there and then a piece goes off it it breaks off it have you ever seen a firecracker a fire rocket go up and it breaks up and blows up and goes here the other but goes up loads he goes here that's not the Seventh Seal that is the Seventh Seal it's the end of time at sea into the devil at sea into this world system it's the end of the millennium it's the end of sin at all it's all encompassed in it but it's actually also more importantly to us it's a person coming to you yes Jesus coming to you as Jesus coming to you joining himself to you so sick of this alone Ian's two and seven see when god quickens a scripture to you it means the world sees here for the mystery are we in seventh yes for the mystery of iniquity doth already work speaking only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way well who's he who's he that's that's the Holy Ghost amen that's Jesus Christ so but who's he he's a person he represents a person not part of a person right not not say if I say I am here and my arms only here that's not all of me it's just part of me he's a person so he who now will err but only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way brother and sisters that when the Holy Ghost has taken off the earth and the bride goes with him so he's going to be here he's got to be here present amen he's here Jesus is here not in a physical not in as corporal body we're going to meet him in the air in that way but as spirits down here upon the earth amen till he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way he's a person amen and then let's go to revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 it says behold revelations 3 and 20 behold I stand at the door I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with with him and he with me I am standing at the door that's a person it's not part we we've received the fullness of Christ in this age not just a part the fullness everything God is in his word as has been released everything that is we're not living like in the Luther a suggestion live by faith that's it that's a part of him or all those yo or the or the age of the loop of the Wesleyan Church of sanctification that's part of him or the gifts being restored that's just a part of them but that's the full thing everything is is here brother Ram says everything God has he poured into Christ and all that Christ is he poured into the church it means to win so around the world I mean the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in a multi-member body Alleluia so he says i standard or not it's not a part of a person if I say I'm standing behind the pulpit I'm all here amen sometimes people go somewhere in there only there and body but I'm here body and in spirit I'm all here why are you saying this do you do you understand what we have I mean here was Jesus giving the last communion the Last Supper I'm gonna I don't know if he said those words the last first two suppers they had this is my body it's going to be given for you this is the blood of new testament drinkers off as you remember me I don't know if he said in the first two times when they had the look supper because it says the Last Supper he had some before but he's trying to share these things with his disciples and they're getting caught up with all these other things that don't really matter he's following me and it's the same thing with us God has given us his word and it's not just a bunch of doctrine it's a person this message is a person amen this message is Jesus Christ it is the Son of man being revealed amen and that same that son of man was revealed that a son of man a prophet but now the Son of Man is revealed in a church I mention it's manifested in a people he is manifested in a people hallelujah and then the other scripture I don't have it reference here but it says I will never leave thee nor forsake thee I that's a person it's not part of a person and that is you say well how is that the Seventh Seal Jesus that's Jesus Christ personally coming to you Amen he comes with this open book saying I'm going to make you I'm gonna make you manifest this word you're going to live out this message you're going to be the interpretation of this message hallelujah that it's your life your life I mean what you hear in 1100 takes 66 books Amen you are going to be the living manifestation of those things hallelujah when brother Brown speaks about a future home and before he goes into the future home he says you know you know I go to the motels and the Blue Boar in different places you eat and sleep and they say you're so nice people and you know he's giving these compliments why is he telling those things he's not just trying to Pat them on the back he's trying to show this is the characteristics of the people that will be in the future home I mean so this is the this is the manifestation of the people that will be there Alleluia it's about the but because brother Bram teaches us very simply God interprets his word by bringing it to pass behold a virgin shall conceive they had eight hundred years of debate well how is it going to happen who's it going to be you know how do you think it'll happen rabbi well maybe it'll happen this way what about you scholar maybe it'll happen this way because this Hebrew word says this and this and this and you know and they they they could have debated all day long but then there's a woman in Nazareth hallelujah and she was walking the Prophet tells us to get water to a well and there was a passageway and a was staying there about six foot tall shoulder-length here kind of a olive complexion and says Hail Mary hallelujah Gabriel tells her how it's going to happen and she just says that it be unto me according to thy word amen the prophecy became fulfilled a virgin shall conceive that's how the virgin conceived hallelujah a star will rise out of Jacob the wise men saw the star they saw the prophecy be fulfilled hallelujah here comes your king meek and lowly on the back of her you know on the back of an ass back of a donkey riding into Jerusalem they could have debated how's it going to happen what's he going to look like what's the donkey going to look like and it just happened to them about a week or so before the account we just read of the Last Supper it was it was fulfilled hallelujah their lives became the man at the interpretation of the scripture the voice of one crying in the wilderness rabbi how do you think it'll happen well one of us will learn and we'll get our PhD and then we'll go camping in the wilderness and we'll begin to have open-air meetings maybe it'll happen that way they would have thought don't you think when you read the scripture do you sometimes think how things will happen I wonder how oh and how God would make organ Armageddon a house this or do you wonder sometimes how these things will happen well we'll see it happen you'll know it'll happen when you see it fulfilled amen and if it was that way for things we were ponder about it would have been you think the Apostle Paul didn't wonder how how things would be fulfilled and then he comes to find himself standing there saying that we're a light to the Gentiles hallelujah he begin to you know he he would maybe one to have them you know had what the Messiah would be like in different things and then the inspiration comes to him he meets the very Messiah then he then he goes into the desert and he takes the Old Testament and he shows that Jesus is the fulfillment I mean off the priesthood and all different kinds of things he says that his ministry and what he's doing right now is the fulfillment of the prophecy and here we are don't let this pass you by here we are I mean the fulfillment hallelujah brother Bram says as Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament so the bride will fulfill than you hallelujah amen so now we read you know we read in the book of Ephesians that his courses has certain heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said well how does that work out and then you happened to find yourself and he comes and meet you and he transforms you he changes you and then you're living in a whole different realm you're thinking a whole different way hallelujah taught you first did imagine bigger mansion bigger mansion being in an egg like an eagle and you're an egg and you're fully conscious that you're in an egg you used to your surroundings you can't leave you can't push so far sometimes you know when when when the sunlight begins to shine you may see it looks all red because you can you know because you can see the light through the shell a little bit you know you shine a light through a chicken egg and you can see what's inside you know that's like a human understanding before they're born again and they can think well how's this going to happen and how's this going to happen how's this going to happen and then and then one day they begin to find I've got a pick out of the shell I'm being restricted I've been restricted for by this first birth I want to be born again amen and there's something it's amazing because there's something on the end of the bill that's built there to pick through the shell all birds have it I mean you're built to pick through the shout hallelujah say how am I gonna do this you're built to do it I mean you begin to pick and pick and then you first you break out then maybe it's a bit too bright for you keep picking and you keep pushing and you find yourself in a whole different atmosphere what's happened you're once under you're under the mother Eagle in the nest and then you find yourself you may be still in that same nice beak and look around and oh that's what the Sun is that's what the rain is oh that's what mama is hallelujah look how big and strong she is amen unless you're born again you see the kingdom of God you cannot understand the kingdom of God I mean so when you get when you when you bust out of your shell hallelujah then you begin to see great Jehovah regal I mean for the power you know what he what he really is Amen brother BAM says win win win with a little babies are in the nest this great big giant mama with a great big giant wings all the New Testament or mama how strong you are how powerful you are hallelujah Amen then she says jump on my back we'll go for a ride I mean you couldn't do that in an egg are you following me thanks you what what's happening you're now living in a different kind of atmosphere amen and the baby sir I wonder what it's like because the prophecy is you shall be born again I wonder what it's like to be out of this egg well maybe it's like this maybe it's like this and then it happens then you find yourself chief the baby finds itself fulfilling a mean the prophecy its life is now fulfilling the prophecy of what it's like to be outside hallelujah and then now they and then and in the babies go down on the mother's back and they go down in the grass I mean they begin to walk around and have a Jubilee in different things hallelujah and in the storm begins to blow and their mother you'll screams and then comes down and picks them up again goes back into the nest hallelujah but then now there comes a time where the mother says you're getting too big for this nice child you've got to fly yourself and then you know I've seen I've seen videos where these Eagles and they come take baby goats off mountaintops they come and grab them they fly off you know you see apparently at Eagle's Nest a big one is a big thing it's got all kinds of 30 yards it's not just branches there's all kinds of things so the nest is comfortable but then there comes is the prophecy remember and in the believer you take Moses he was born under a prophecy he was part of a prophecy your seed Abraham will sojourn in a strange land they'll be afflicted for hundred years but I'll bring them out with a mighty hand and that prophecy was Moses and that he was part of that prophecy he didn't know that when you know when his mother said you know you're a special child we've been praying for a deliverer you know he had in his mind okay I'm I'm in Pharaoh's house I'm the general I know where the arms are I know how this is going to all work out I meant but when the interpretation of that prophecy came here he was 80 years old he was on the backside of the desert 40 years hallelujah this old man with a big long beard and different things and he comes and he comes into Egypt and the customs he fills out his customs form what's the purpose of your visit invasion other invasion and they lead him through that's what you know what's your purpose of your visit other invasion please specify okay and then yeah where you go Moses the Prophet says I'm going to take over and the thing is he did it Alleluia he was his life was the interpretation of that prophecy in him was that prophecy and then it was expressed I mean David was to be king over Israel Samuel goes down to Jesse's house and Jesse's house I have a king amen and then who must to be that king he was going to be the fulfillment of that word he didn't know how it was all going to work out all he knew is I'm going to be the manifestation Pulu you of that word because I am that word amen and so now and the Eagles of prophecy you must fly you must be like mama hallelujah you must be like mommy you got a sore from the heavenlies that's in the babies it's in the babies they they may be a look at bummer and say that's so amazing did you see what you did there look how she so fast how could you ever follow there that's so amazing and we read the word you hear the message and you see God come down service after service amen casting out Devils healing the sick where the promises get out of that stretcher hallelujah I think it's certain whose's Melchizedek in the end there's a woman of saying lying on a cot get off that cot hallelujah and then you can hear she gets up on the people just in all hallelujah they say that's so amazing how can that be sorry but you go to it's just like they baby eagle look at mama look how incredible that is and it but it's one thing now why is mama flying like that because she wants to tell her babies you'll do the same as me I'm going to demonstrate this that you'll do it one day hallelujah that's the same thing with our God he did he's been waived brother ham says that as the rising of the Sun and to me it's it's one of my most precious sermons where's the Declaration he says it was a dual Sun rising that that resurrection morning and natural Sun arose but then the sol rose as well this is after two thousand years hallelujah that take me somewhere has risen I mean he's been waved over the people why is it being waved because you look at him and say because he's telling you yeah you know what the waving is about let's just go back a bit and in Leviticus I think it's Leviticus 23 they have a field of wheat wheat and matures at a different rate the mature part of the field is cut down some of it can still be green some of it can be yay big I don't know they cut down the mature part that's given to the priest and the priest ways that before God saying thank you God that the rest of the field will come like these ones hallelujah so it's waved its waved as an offering the rest of the same grain amen will be exactly like this and brother Graham says that was that was the son of God was cut down and then he was waved over the people of Pentecost Amen sit in that that same God has waved over the people hallelujah because if the grain could look up that say they could be green they could be still standing up like this half growing but they could say to your neighbor hey look at that we're going to be exactly like that one hallelujah because we're the same species we're the same type of of seed hallelujah and they couldn't help but maturing they couldn't help but growing amen to his wave their Helou you I mentioned how God was with a Holy Spirit wave the Son of man has been waved over the people and this should be something in you you say I'm gonna be like this hallelujah you say well how am I gonna become like that I don't know but there's something in me like the baby eagle you take a baby eagle that's just hatched out of a pest out of it some egg and you look at the mama do you think how's that gonna ever saw like that how's it ever going to swoop down and catch its prey and take it up and but it's going to it has to it has to because the same DNA the same life that's and murmurers in the baby I mean the baby's just got to grow hallelujah and follow its Mama's leading hallelujah and it will become it must become like its mother and is the same thing with us friends holy say how am I ever gonna be like Jesus amen their same life that was in him as in you I trust you got to say it the same life that was in him it's in me and that will produce the same life the same characteristic everything that he is I mean I will become your brother Graham says she is him in just a few words but it's very astounding she assumed does that mean we we become Jesus we receive worship no I mean but husband and wife become one did everything the husband is the wife becomes hallelujah she is we are Christ's and feminine form because we are part of him not the way of anything good of ourselves it's all him hallelujah and then now the baby gets big enough a little bit and then then the mama Eagles got a gotta stir the nest because now now the babies are going to learn to fly like mama they may have danced around had a little Jubilee in the nest glory hallelujah isn't this wonderful but then they get a certain size your mama begins to take all the soft stuff out of the nest hallelujah maybe all the goat skins in there and the leaves and whatever more that's soft and that you're the rabbit skins or whatever's there go dig it all out children you got to fly but mama right I want to fly you've got to fly you've got to exercise your wings of faith I mean you're going to soar in the heavenlies I don't want to pack you around I want you to fly with me I want to have fellowship with you I mean you can show me a barrel roll I'll do a barrel roll hallelujah although loop-the-loop you do a loop-the-loop y-you do experience this together there's a nut grater you know what's greater you that have children carrying them around like a baby and going on a swing or going down the slide or when they get big enough they say come daddy let's go let's go down the slide let's go on the swing together let's play a game what's better as a parent when they get older cuz you begin to interact hallelujah and they begin to enjoy it more you following me how loose like us now we get a certain age he's taking all the padding out of the nest bad things are good bad things are good because he wants you to fly in the heavenlies he doesn't want you to be earthbound in the and the nest with a bunch of did did kill he wants you to fly up into glory amen catch a catch a thermal and just ride it up into the heavenlies hallelujah I remember the first time I saw an eagle in the wild was in Papua New Guinea and it was just way up we were talking I was talking to to brother modem about baptism under their house Christine knows because she's been there and then knows that Eagle just so just didn't even didn't even flap its wings it's just like this just going so fast high up in the sky so while that's incredible spread your wings set them in the winds of faith hallelujah I mean that's what we're called to do that's why though that's why the nests get stood up and you're glad it's that way hallelujah because he wants you he wants you to see what's in you I mean when we see you know as I see it about Moses and David and you know it's easy to put it on them but then when we come you to look at your own self and say I'm a prophecy I'm a prophecy Peter James and John 120 in the upper room they didn't know in the prophecy of Joel maybe before it happened I'll pull my spirit out upon all flesh this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel they didn't know that containing that prophecy was Peter James and John and one hundred and hundred and seventeen other people in the Upper Room to initiate that outpouring you follow me they didn't know that they were part of their prophecy but God God when he thought of that would being manifested he saw them in the upper room he saw these ones of the vessels I'm going to pull myself into hallelujah and that's why Peter could say this is X welcomed by the Prophet Joel he could say I am the fulfillment of this prophecy this day the Scriptures fulfilled in your ears hallelujah he was the fulfillment amen and it's the same thing with you and I when when God said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready amen when when God God gave the inspiration at Scripture to John you were there you were there in the vision I'll put it out because you're the fulfillment amen the bride around the world is the fulfillment I don't think I've gone off in some crazy tangent if Moses was part of the prophecy there Amen Jesus was Jesus was the fulfillment of the seed of the woman coming there was prophesied to Adam and Eve they meant there all Isaac was the fulfillment of of God telling Abraham that you can have the promised son he was the manifestation of that of the natural part of that prophecy we know Jesus was the greatest seat amen yo this that's all they are the interpretation of that scripture that's easy sometimes I say well that's them but we're going to look at now what is the what is the scripture allotted to us because the inspiration is poured out upon the scripture that's being fulfilled in your day amen that's why I said Lutz's lived out his portion of the word weasely lived out his portion amen Azusa Street Pentecost lived out their portion but what about our Porsche hallelujah that's why we've got to preach the message for this day I mean Peter said that you would be established in present truth present truth we want to be established in present truth not just passed truth present truth hallelujah because of your established and present truth did everything that would that happen for and your behalf in the past will be a lot of Tears Amen because it's when you receive they made the message for your day I mean it ties you back into what everything he did feel in the past hallelujah it's like some man standing there now hope I don't this is okay he's a man steering he's there on the Mount crucifixion he sees the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world he believes it but then here comes the apostles and here they bring the Word of Life now he had to receive what they preached he had to they had to receive it he had to walk in the light as he is in the light amen yeah because that was where the present truth was is it is this all like you you understand what I'm saying it's like Moses comes along you got to take a lamb hold them for about 14 days then you got to kill the lamb take the blood put it on the door and lintel of your house the death angels going to strike now a lot of people who could have said but I'm a circumcised Jew I'm a circumcised Jew I don't need to do this with no lamb I'm not putting no blood on my door I just painted it that's not practical for me that's messy I'm a very clean person now if he didn't if they didn't apply the Lamb's blood to their house the death angel would have hit them even though they were circumcised they had to receive what God was telling him in that day they meant and it's the same thing in this day we don't serve a historical God I'm gonna wind up with this and we'll continue with it on Sunday but we don't serve a historical God he is the great I am he's the present God what is he doing in this day hallelujah what is he doing in this day an hour I just leave that hanging for Sunday but you see we have to receive you have to receive what he does in your day in our Amen even even in the days of Noah because God God gave covered Adam and Eve with lambskins Abel offered a sacrifice and that sacrifice was accepted they come down a few hundred years I'm building an ark showed me this is the only way of escaping this day it's gonna rain you got to get in now someone could say and say mister no sir I don't know about your arc I know Abel was accepted I'm just going to offer a lamb that's all I'm going to do I'm not gonna get in your boat I'm gonna do this what would have happened to that person Abraham I mean Abel's sacrifice was accepted but now this was another season think about it let's have some musicians to come they had to get in the ark you know the ark is Christ amen but you've got to receive you have to receive what God does that's like Moses seed to the people God will raise up a prophet like unto me and who doesn't hear him he'll be cut off from among the people and the scribes and Pharisees Pharisee said we are Moses disciples but then Jesus said if you had known Moses you would have known me because Moses wrote of me they didn't really know Moses they said tradition it hadn't become a life to them Amen let's just I want to sing that song and heavenly armor will enter the land the battle belongs to the Lord it's probably not that related but I feel like seeing you I mean this take every promise that belongs to us let's not shrink back this could be the last Wednesday we have one day there will be a last Wednesday Malou you amen no weapon that's fashioned against us will stand no unbelief will stand against us hallelujah the battle belongs to the Lord I mean we could actually sing in heavenly armor we've entered the land hallelujah I've crossed Jordan how about you I mean I've crossed Jordan this is worship the Lord tonight and you're glad think is it going on but here he is we have any goddess if God is for us I wish we can just I wish I had a few hours but you know the Apostle Peter this is a Paul a said if God is for us who can be against us and you see the Covenant that God has given you the Covenant of his word as he's enjoying to you and you look at the precious treasures in it because for the bride you got to say for me this is all good none of the bad pounders for me it doesn't belong he doesn't have my name on it all the good butts belong to me I mean sorry in heaven [Music] [Applause] [Music] that'll be long and we say [Music] when the power like of love the bad he's raised up a standard the power [Music]
