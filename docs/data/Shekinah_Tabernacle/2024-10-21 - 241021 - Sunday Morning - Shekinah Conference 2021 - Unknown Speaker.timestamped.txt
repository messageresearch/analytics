[12:09] praise the lord
[12:11] welcome again to the house of the lord
[12:13] how are you all feeling this morning
[12:16] good
[12:17] so good
[12:18] that's the right answer
[12:20] and the lord we're always feeling so
[12:22] good
[12:24] regardless of what's happening
[12:25] regardless of what the circumstance is
[12:27] we are so good
[12:29] because you know when you win christ you
[12:31] win everything that's it
[12:33] you've won you've won
[12:35] the whole game of life finished done
[12:36] i've won this whole thing so what
[12:38] happens after that doesn't really matter
[12:40] we've won so we're all champions this
[12:42] morning thanks to the thanks to our
[12:45] champion of champions the king of kings
[12:47] and the lord of lords that that won the
[12:49] victory for us
[12:50] amen i've really enjoyed the ministry so
[12:52] far at this camp
[12:54] it's um
[12:55] if the brothers that ministered knew the
[12:57] things that were going on and even in my
[12:59] own life and things they just having
[13:01] everything exactly
[13:04] for where i'm at for a lot of things and
[13:07] um
[13:08] it's been outstanding actually you know
[13:11] i've often thought
[13:12] like you know we have these meetings and
[13:13] we we like to bring someone in from
[13:15] overseas
[13:16] but i've always thought that i
[13:18] these are my favorite guys right here
[13:20] man
[13:21] from taranaki from auckland from
[13:23] around the place
[13:25] you know it's just our mental state
[13:27] because we think if we get someone in
[13:29] from overseas and that they come in it's
[13:30] like oh it's going to be something you
[13:32] know whereas if they drive from down the
[13:34] road oh that's just by the sun so from
[13:35] down the road you know
[13:37] but but it's not like that in the lord i
[13:39] mean we need to get past that that
[13:41] mental block because
[13:42] you know when jesus went to his hometown
[13:44] they said isn't this just jesus joseph's
[13:46] son and they they didn't respect them
[13:48] they couldn't they didn't listen to him
[13:50] and and it said that because of their
[13:52] unbelief he could do he couldn't do very
[13:54] many mighty works because they they they
[13:56] didn't esteem him
[14:00] as from the lord they just sustained him
[14:02] as from
[14:03] down the road you know but that's the
[14:05] reason why we've been so blessed at
[14:07] these meetings is because i don't think
[14:08] our minds have esteemed these brethren
[14:10] from just down the road we've esteemed
[14:12] them as being from the lord
[14:13] and
[14:15] and and the lord's blessed us for that
[14:16] and we need to always keep that and the
[14:18] same goes with our pastors and the
[14:20] ministry and the
[14:22] the people in our fellowship when we
[14:23] esteem them
[14:25] as from the lord we get really blessed
[14:28] and and the fellowship any fellowship
[14:31] flourishes when we when we respect the
[14:33] the order that god's put into place and
[14:35] we we receive it as being from him when
[14:37] we don't do that
[14:38] i'll show you a fellowship that goes
[14:40] down faster than a lead ball
[14:42] because that's how it happens but i'm so
[14:44] glad that that we're of a nature that we
[14:47] respect ministry we we receive ministry
[14:49] as from the lord
[14:51] and if we continue to do it which we
[14:52] will because that's the season that
[14:54] we're in we're in a season of victory i
[14:56] really like your sermon last night bro
[14:58] it was really good
[15:00] and and
[15:02] i'll just hear this one thing before i
[15:05] have brother ben up um
[15:09] i've been going through a big thing at
[15:11] the moment
[15:12] and i was wondering how it was all going
[15:14] to happen a very big thing
[15:17] and um
[15:19] i was burdened you know when you get a
[15:21] burden to really find out from the lord
[15:22] what the answer is
[15:25] and then one night about two months ago
[15:26] i thought lord i just want to find out
[15:28] how do i do all this how do i
[15:30] get through this whole thing that that
[15:32] i'm
[15:33] doing
[15:35] and
[15:38] through the prayer a really strong
[15:40] answer came back and it said it's going
[15:42] to be different than the way you've
[15:43] always done it
[15:45] it's not going to be you trying to
[15:46] figure things out or work it all out or
[15:49] do that it's going to be a different
[15:50] season
[15:51] you just don't need to do anything it's
[15:52] just going to happen it's just going to
[15:53] be by faith
[15:55] and
[15:56] this is in a bigger sense right because
[15:58] we we all want to operate by faith but
[15:59] this in my mind i thought this is a
[16:01] bigger thing than just oh i'm going to
[16:02] try and do this by faith this is
[16:04] a new season of operating
[16:07] and i
[16:08] tried to explain it to shan about a
[16:09] month ago
[16:11] um and i just explained it like that but
[16:13] i said it's i haven't really explained
[16:14] it properly because it's not like by
[16:16] just trusting the lord and we just go on
[16:18] it's i think it's different than that
[16:19] it's like a whole new
[16:21] i'm not going to do things the old way
[16:22] of i'm changing everything how i do
[16:24] things
[16:25] that i'm not going to think about
[16:26] tomorrow i'm going to actually just the
[16:28] lord's in control of it all i was just
[16:30] it's i said it's bigger than just
[16:32] i'm going to trust in the lord it's a
[16:33] different thing and that's why i was so
[16:36] blessed yesterday because i basically
[16:38] thought these guys gave my answer this
[16:39] is what i'm talking about i'm talking
[16:41] about that
[16:42] that's the season
[16:44] so it was it was
[16:46] it was exactly what i'm going through
[16:49] in a in a seasonal
[16:51] sense too and i think all of us are
[16:53] becoming like that where
[16:55] where we are looking to the heavenlies
[16:58] more than the earthly
[17:00] you know and and we all
[17:01] because we're a body we all go through
[17:03] this together we don't one person
[17:04] doesn't just happen it's a it's a body
[17:07] work and every one of us are going
[17:08] through the same thing and we're in for
[17:10] a great time
[17:12] we're in for an outstanding time in the
[17:13] lord we're this is like the things that
[17:16] are happening in the world are just
[17:17] outstanding
[17:18] you know it's we're in for such a good
[17:20] time like the things we're going to see
[17:23] and experience
[17:25] so you hear all these
[17:27] passports and all this stuff like that
[17:29] don't worry about it it's actually
[17:31] it's going to make this experience all
[17:33] the more fun what if we just drifted on
[17:35] with nothing how boring would that be
[17:37] right life just goes on and we just work
[17:39] and do our thing it's not going to be
[17:40] like that
[17:41] we've got some intense pressure coming
[17:43] in it's going to be fantastic
[17:45] going to have such a good time
[17:48] yeah man that's the way it's going to be
[17:50] and and i'm looking forward to it
[17:52] we don't approach it with fear we
[17:53] approach it with faith this is our
[17:55] journey out you know where things are
[17:57] heating up to leave for us to leave and
[17:59] we're going to leave victorious we're
[18:00] not going to leave defeated
[18:02] we're going to leave the most victorious
[18:04] people that were ever walking upon the
[18:05] face of the earth
[18:07] that's
[18:08] there's going to be no one more
[18:09] victorious than what we're going to be
[18:11] when we leave this earth and in the
[18:12] history of mankind it's the season we're
[18:15] in that's that's the way it's going to
[18:16] happen so when you when you hear all
[18:18] this stuff on the news just be happy
[18:20] but i used to follow the news quite a
[18:22] bit but i don't really do it too much

[55:00] and cast those things out that you may
[55:02] have the liberty lord we pray father we
[55:05] ask this in your name the name of jesus
[55:08] christ amen
[55:10] thank you uh musicians um if we could
[55:12] have the first slide up this morning we
[55:14] are going to take a a subject that i've
[55:17] already taken in various forms in our
[55:19] own church i'm going to do a part three
[55:21] this morning
[55:24] and this subject is
[55:26] a very
[55:28] challenging one
[55:31] very challenging one
[55:34] now the lord gave this to me about two
[55:36] or three months maybe three months ago
[55:39] and
[55:40] when you come to comprehend the depth of
[55:42] it
[55:43] everything that you see on the earth
[55:46] becomes understandable
[55:50] everything you see in world events
[55:52] everything you see in the church events
[55:53] everything you even see in your own self
[55:56] becomes understandable
[55:59] and so for those who are streaming in
[56:01] this morning don't
[56:03] don't look at this with critical spirits
[56:06] go and check it out with the message
[56:08] as everything i've done for the subject
[56:10] this morning i've done with a fine-tooth
[56:12] comb
[56:13] and i'm not a kind of guy who goes up in
[56:15] the pulpit and tear and just makes
[56:17] things up
[56:18] so now we're going to go and
[56:23] look at this
[56:24] heading this morning now
[56:27] every single person on this earth right
[56:29] now has been
[56:30] affected
[56:32] by the word of god whether they like to
[56:34] know it or not
[56:35] is that right
[56:37] and so
[56:38] the sanity that is coming into your life
[56:42] is causing insanity upon the earth
[56:48] say is that right man
[56:50] sanity coming to you is causing the
[56:53] world to go insane
[56:59] and there's something causing the world
[57:01] to go hysterically mad
[57:04] at such a rapid pace
[57:08] it's all from the word of god
[57:10] there's something that's coming out of
[57:12] the scriptures
[57:15] making them go stark raving mad
[57:18] but making you come completely sane
[57:22] so now there's an expectation
[57:25] over you for this hour
[57:28] and you must live within that
[57:30] expectation because we are a prophetic
[57:33] people we are not a people that wander
[57:36] around with supposition we should not be
[57:39] like wandering stars wandering here and
[57:41] wandering here and wondering in our
[57:43] minds we should be stable stars
[57:46] settled behind in relation to the north
[57:49] star christ himself
[57:53] and i'll say to you this is not an hour
[57:56] for negativeness
[57:59] negativeness puts you in the camp of the
[58:03] devil
[58:05] oh my goodness
[58:07] if you've got a negative thoughts about
[58:09] yourself
[58:10] you're already in the camp of the devil
[58:15] that's a mouth wouldn't it
[58:19] now we're going to read from genesis the
[58:21] seed book
[58:24] anything you see in black is up there is
[58:27] what i had put there for you to to look
[58:29] at if anybody wants the notes
[58:32] from this meeting
[58:34] go and see brother bear
[58:36] amen
[58:38] now abraham was old
[58:41] and well stricken in age
[58:44] and the lord blessed abraham and all
[58:47] things not some things now are you the
[58:49] royal seat of abraham he's not going to
[58:51] just bless you with some things he's
[58:53] going to bless you with all things is
[58:54] that right praise the lord
[58:57] and abraham said unto his eldest servant
[58:59] who was that eliezer
[59:02] who was the eldest servant come at the
[59:05] end time
[59:06] who was our eliezer
[59:08] brother branham came at the end time
[59:10] elijah to fulfill malachi 4 5 and
[59:12] revelations 10 7 is that right
[59:15] he was the chief reaper
[59:16] that ruth met
[59:18] they're right come on now we have
[59:20] there's some elected amends
[59:23] praise the lord
[59:26] and
[59:27] abraham said unto his elder servant of
[59:29] his house that ruled over all that he
[59:31] had but i he said put i pray thee thy
[59:33] hand under my thigh
[59:36] i want you to put my hand your hand
[59:38] where i have seed to reproduce myself
[59:42] from
[59:43] oh
[59:44] my
[59:45] this is deep stuff man
[59:48] god is concerned about his genetics
[59:53] is that right
[59:54] you just don't go it he didn't say put
[59:56] it under my
[59:58] armpit he's concerned about his genetics
[1:00:03] and i'll make thee swear by the lord the
[1:00:05] god of heaven and the god of earth you
[1:00:08] shall not take a wife unto my son of the
[1:00:11] daughters of the canaanites among whom i
[1:00:13] dwell
[1:00:15] he says i don't want you to go and get
[1:00:17] yourself a wife from satan's eating
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] but you should go into my country
[1:00:24] what kind of a country is that the place
[1:00:26] of its origin
[1:00:28] to my kindred and take a wife unto my
[1:00:31] son
[1:00:33] isaac
[1:00:35] now the seed of abraham that god is
[1:00:38] concerned about
[1:00:40] is not
[1:00:41] god is concerned about not the natural
[1:00:44] seeds
[1:00:46] for the end time
[1:00:47] he's talking about a spiritual seat
[1:00:52] this is a seed
[1:00:54] that has representation in heaven
[1:00:57] that has a theophany waiting
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:02] praise the lord
[1:01:04] let's just bow our heads
[1:01:08] lord jesus your word is true
[1:01:12] and we are living in such
[1:01:14] an astounding time lord
[1:01:18] and lord i pray that you come and open
[1:01:19] the book
[1:01:21] to us
[1:01:22] personally in our own personal lives
[1:01:26] lord
[1:01:27] and i pray
[1:01:29] that reality would sink into hearts
[1:01:33] about what you're doing right now i pray
[1:01:35] in jesus name amen maybe seated
[1:01:46] my goodness those seats are the noisiest
[1:01:48] seats i ever heard it just sounds like
[1:01:50] there's some ghosts around the place you
[1:01:52] know my goodness me
[1:01:55] now i can't get this gadget to go there
[1:01:57] bro
[1:01:59] okay
[1:02:02] now abraham
[1:02:05] if you want to get more information
[1:02:07] about abraham you got to go and see it
[1:02:09] as paul teaches in the book of hebrews
[1:02:12] by faith
[1:02:14] abraham when he was called to go out
[1:02:16] into a place which he should
[1:02:18] after receive receiving an inheritance
[1:02:20] obeyed and he went out not knowing where
[1:02:24] he went
[1:02:25] and so when we start out of this walk
[1:02:27] brothers and sisters when we hear in
[1:02:29] revelations 18 come out of her my people
[1:02:34] we did not know where he was going to
[1:02:35] take us to
[1:02:37] is that right
[1:02:38] well i sure did it in 1984
[1:02:42] but god
[1:02:44] he orchestrates your footsteps
[1:02:48] and then further down the road he goes
[1:02:51] and shows you where you've come from
[1:02:54] and then you connect and know where
[1:02:56] you're going to
[1:02:59] praise the
[1:03:00] lord by faith he's adjourned in the land
[1:03:04] of promise as an estranged country
[1:03:06] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[1:03:09] jacob the heirs with him of the same
[1:03:11] promise now these men these sons had the
[1:03:14] same destiny as their father
[1:03:18] now when he came out of babylon
[1:03:21] there was
[1:03:22] an action coming from another dimension
[1:03:26] oh my
[1:03:28] he was looking for a city whose builder
[1:03:33] and maker
[1:03:34] is god
[1:03:36] and if you are the royal seat of abraham
[1:03:39] you are doing the same
[1:03:42] thing because there is a positive
[1:03:46] pulling your negative into a reality
[1:03:51] because when you heard this message was
[1:03:53] eagle food you heard from your theophany
[1:03:57] the theophany did not say oh well um
[1:03:59] you've heard from me now nothing more is
[1:04:01] going to happen your theophany is
[1:04:05] magnetizing you
[1:04:07] to the scriptures
[1:04:10] to scriptural fulfillment
[1:04:14] that's why we are a people of prophecy
[1:04:18] he looked for a city his building maker
[1:04:19] was god
[1:04:20] therefore sprang the even one and have
[1:04:23] as good as dead so many as the stars of
[1:04:26] the sky and multitude and the sand which
[1:04:28] is by the seashore innumerable
[1:04:32] the ones that stand by the seashore was
[1:04:34] the natural jews
[1:04:38] but when he talked about the stars in
[1:04:39] the sky and multitude he was talking
[1:04:41] about me he knows talking about you
[1:04:46] come on now
[1:04:49] we're not sitting in church just to pay
[1:04:51] religion
[1:04:53] praise the lord
[1:04:56] god was connecting abraham
[1:04:59] to the his
[1:05:00] reality
[1:05:02] now the holy ghost comes at the end time
[1:05:04] brother branham says it goes from
[1:05:06] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:05:09] the holy ghost to the person of the holy
[1:05:11] ghost so the person of the holy ghost
[1:05:14] comes to connect you to your reality and
[1:05:18] that is why he says in the sermon things
[1:05:21] that are to be i think it was he says
[1:05:23] you are this is matching time
[1:05:26] you are being matched
[1:05:28] by the holy ghost to your reality
[1:05:32] is that right
[1:05:33] this is reality time he said this world
[1:05:37] is not even real
[1:05:43] we're just passing through saints
[1:05:45] [Applause]
[1:05:47] we're pilgrims on a journey we came from
[1:05:50] eternity we come down through time our
[1:05:53] gene was put in a period of time now
[1:05:56] we're going back
[1:05:58] to our origins
[1:06:00] by an eagle anointing
[1:06:02] that lifted the darkness off of your
[1:06:05] life
[1:06:06] i still broke over you
[1:06:10] and the light
[1:06:11] went through the darkness and touched
[1:06:13] the gene on the inside of the soul
[1:06:16] praise the lord and god has been lifting
[1:06:19] the seals off of your life
[1:06:21] breaking away the earthly
[1:06:23] bringing in the heavenly taking you in a
[1:06:26] transformation from the earthly to the
[1:06:29] heavenly
[1:06:30] that is what the holy ghost is for in
[1:06:32] this hour it's not to make you just seek
[1:06:34] that you can gusta how using a gift
[1:06:37] is to make you aware
[1:06:41] praise god
[1:06:43] oh my
[1:06:45] i'm already worn out already
[1:06:52] oh my
[1:06:53] genetics
[1:06:55] god's genetics are you god's genetics
[1:06:58] i don't want don't don't you don't look
[1:07:00] in the mirror with this uh
[1:07:02] what you think is mama and daddy's
[1:07:04] genetics that's sticking inside of you
[1:07:10] to the people looking at the earthly
[1:07:12] things and combat and trying to make it
[1:07:14] look nicer
[1:07:16] the genetics that god placed in my soul
[1:07:17] well he's just making that nice
[1:07:19] i'm not interested in just filming
[1:07:21] everything up on the outside you know
[1:07:23] god always works from the inside to the
[1:07:25] outside it's that right in exodus
[1:07:27] chapter 25
[1:07:28] god showed moses a pattern of the
[1:07:31] tabernacle in heaven
[1:07:32] where did he start
[1:07:35] in the holy of holies
[1:07:37] is that right he didn't start on the
[1:07:39] outside he started on the inside is that
[1:07:41] right
[1:07:42] so god starts on the inside and redeems
[1:07:44] the inside and i want to tell you this
[1:07:47] body is not yet redeemed
[1:07:49] has got to be changed and the atom has a
[1:07:52] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:07:54] which is in ephesians chapter one
[1:07:57] which is the end time because ephesians
[1:07:59] is the end time book
[1:08:01] is that right we are in a time
[1:08:04] where our atoms are going to be
[1:08:06] changed
[1:08:09] that's the expectation
[1:08:11] you talk about nuclear power man
[1:08:14] have they got nothing like what's going
[1:08:15] to happen
[1:08:19] and the servant said
[1:08:22] perhaps the woman
[1:08:24] come on now perhaps
[1:08:28] hey
[1:08:28] they
[1:08:30] will not be willing to follow me into
[1:08:32] this land must i need to bring thy son
[1:08:34] again unto the land for whence thou
[1:08:35] camest and abraham said beware that thou
[1:08:38] bring not my son there again
[1:08:41] and the lord god of heaven which took me
[1:08:43] from my father's house and from the land
[1:08:45] of my kindred which spake unto me
[1:08:48] that swear unto me saying unto thy
[1:08:51] will i give this land
[1:08:53] he shall send his angel
[1:08:55] before thee
[1:08:58] who was with brother brennan
[1:09:02] he said the mighty angel and the earthly
[1:09:04] angel are on the land on the earth at
[1:09:07] the same
[1:09:08] time
[1:09:11] and when the earthly angel left the
[1:09:14] heavenly angel did not leave
[1:09:18] and that heavenly angel
[1:09:22] was continuing
[1:09:25] the work that eliezer sparked
[1:09:29] that angel
[1:09:31] that descended from heaven
[1:09:34] the prophet said oh i like this
[1:09:38] he left
[1:09:39] his throne
[1:09:41] to come to another throne the throne of
[1:09:45] his
[1:09:46] redeemed praise the lord are you a
[1:09:49] throne
[1:09:50] are you a throne that god has calmed
[1:09:53] down too
[1:09:54] there is a throne of mercy and judgment
[1:09:57] inside god's people
[1:10:00] now call me a heretic
[1:10:03] the way that calls that's called heresy
[1:10:05] that's the way that i worship my god
[1:10:10] if someone wants
[1:10:12] to know whether
[1:10:14] the way to salvation is
[1:10:17] the way to mercy is
[1:10:20] where they're going to go
[1:10:22] to the final voice
[1:10:24] of the final age
[1:10:27] under her messenger
[1:10:29] you are the most important people on
[1:10:30] this opinion
[1:10:32] don't you ever get that out of your
[1:10:34] heads brethren
[1:10:36] because that devil will come along and
[1:10:37] try to make you think lower than what
[1:10:39] you really are and the moment that you
[1:10:41] think yourself lower than what you
[1:10:42] really are you're in the devil's
[1:10:43] territory because you're now taking
[1:10:45] negative thoughts
[1:10:46] when i come up here i come up here for a
[1:10:48] war
[1:10:49] and i come up here for a war that i
[1:10:51] ain't going to lose
[1:10:53] see
[1:10:54] well i ain't up here here here to lose
[1:10:56] not any wars brethren
[1:10:59] and you shall take a wife
[1:11:01] unto thy my son from this and if the
[1:11:04] woman will not be willing to follow thee
[1:11:05] then you shall be clear from this my
[1:11:07] oath only break not my son wither again
[1:11:12] what did that angel come to do
[1:11:15] he came to break the amnesia that's been
[1:11:19] over you
[1:11:21] amnesia comes because you have been hit
[1:11:25] by worry
[1:11:26] shock and two opinions
[1:11:29] you are born on this earth with worry
[1:11:31] shock and two opinions this whole world
[1:11:34] is full of it
[1:11:35] but the angel came
[1:11:37] to have you to look at familiar things
[1:11:40] the familiar things breaks the amnesia
[1:11:43] so the ministry must take you back to
[1:11:45] familiar things
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:49] this world is not familiar things
[1:11:52] eternity is familiar thing and that's
[1:11:54] why he said to john look up
[1:11:58] come and see the reality of yourself
[1:12:02] praise the lord
[1:12:06] there's a day breaking brethren
[1:12:09] is that right
[1:12:14] my goodness i hope we haven't started
[1:12:16] yet
[1:12:19] let the killing machine go
[1:12:24] and the servant took ten camels
[1:12:26] of the camels of his master
[1:12:30] and departed for all the goods of his
[1:12:32] master were in his hand as he rose and
[1:12:34] went to mesopotamia unto the city of
[1:12:36] naha he had the whole seven seals
[1:12:39] in his hands
[1:12:41] is that right he had the whole under
[1:12:44] whole revelation from genesis to read
[1:12:46] the book of revelation and he made his
[1:12:48] camels to kneel down without the city by
[1:12:51] the well of water at the evening time at
[1:12:53] the time of the evening sacrifice at the
[1:12:56] time of the evening sacrifices when full
[1:12:58] praise comes back the seals have been
[1:13:01] open the revelation comes forth god
[1:13:04] comes down says to the angels i don't
[1:13:06] want to hear that total worship anymore
[1:13:08] i want to hear worship of the redeemed
[1:13:13] and god inhabits the praises of his
[1:13:15] peoples
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:22] and come at the time when the woman go
[1:13:24] to draw water
[1:13:26] oh my prayer praise god
[1:13:29] are you drawing water
[1:13:31] amen at the evening time and he said o
[1:13:33] lord god my master abraham i pray thee
[1:13:35] send me good speed this day and show
[1:13:37] kindness unto my master abraham and
[1:13:39] behold i stand here by the well of water
[1:13:41] and the daughters of the men of the city
[1:13:42] come
[1:13:43] and draw out water
[1:13:47] and here was a woman
[1:13:50] that came out to the well at evening
[1:13:52] time
[1:13:53] and inside of his soul
[1:13:55] was the same dna
[1:13:57] that abraham had
[1:14:03] the same
[1:14:04] dna
[1:14:07] the same attribute
[1:14:11] and she was of the same lineage as
[1:14:14] abraham because in the old testament you
[1:14:17] married of the same bloodline
[1:14:20] and in the end time we marry of the same
[1:14:23] bloodline
[1:14:24] the holy spirit is the life of the blood
[1:14:27] when you get the holy spirit you are
[1:14:30] marrying into the same bloodline
[1:14:33] are you with me now
[1:14:35] praise the lord
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:41] and how did rebecca respond
[1:14:44] from the voice she responded with the
[1:14:47] voice of her dna
[1:14:52] thank you lord
[1:15:00] now watch what he did
[1:15:02] he gives her a down payment
[1:15:05] before the reality of the message i
[1:15:07] should submit the reality of the
[1:15:09] marriage
[1:15:11] and he placed upon her the sign
[1:15:13] of deity
[1:15:15] he gave her a golden earring
[1:15:18] some golden
[1:15:19] the golden bracelets
[1:15:22] to hear and to serve
[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:28] now eliezer
[1:15:31] came into rebecca's house i want you to
[1:15:32] catch these things
[1:15:34] what do you represent
[1:15:38] when he came into
[1:15:41] her father's house
[1:15:44] his father recognized eliezer who he was
[1:15:51] the mother recognized who eliezer was
[1:15:56] the brother recognized who eliezer was
[1:15:59] and the maidens recognized who eliezer
[1:16:02] was
[1:16:03] but only one got married
[1:16:14] recognizing who eliezer was
[1:16:16] and is does not mean you're going to get
[1:16:19] married
[1:16:21] knowing who revelations 10 7 is does not
[1:16:25] mean you're getting married
[1:16:28] come on now we're going to go deeper
[1:16:30] with this work
[1:16:32] there's only one woman getting married
[1:16:35] who knew the purpose of eliezer
[1:16:41] hey man brethren
[1:16:43] too many people to say
[1:16:45] oh i know who brother brandon was that
[1:16:46] don't mean to
[1:16:52] amazing time isn't it
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:58] now in genesis 24 53 and the servant
[1:17:01] brought jewels of silva
[1:17:03] and jewels of gold
[1:17:05] and raymond and gave them to rebecca
[1:17:09] he also gave her to her brother
[1:17:12] and her mother
[1:17:14] precious things
[1:17:16] they got precious things
[1:17:18] but they did not get what rebecca got
[1:17:27] steep
[1:17:28] man many people
[1:17:31] are getting blessed by elias's message
[1:17:36] but they did not get
[1:17:38] the silver
[1:17:39] redemption by marriage
[1:17:41] the gold position of deity by a marriage
[1:17:46] and they did not get
[1:17:47] a change of raiment
[1:17:51] a change of rain
[1:17:54] they got gifts
[1:17:55] they knew who eliezer was
[1:17:57] and too many people are resting on the
[1:17:59] gifts that come from acknowledging the
[1:18:01] message of the hour but they haven't
[1:18:03] come into the fullness of redemption
[1:18:07] i'm sorry i've got this out like this
[1:18:08] brethren
[1:18:10] but i ain't into mincing words
[1:18:14] so there were blessings on a family
[1:18:17] they got precious things they got gifts
[1:18:20] in that move of god but those gifts had
[1:18:22] no connection with marriage there was
[1:18:26] salvation
[1:18:27] under the message eliezer brought
[1:18:30] and there was redemption under the
[1:18:32] message that eliezer brought and
[1:18:34] salvation and redemption are two
[1:18:37] different things
[1:18:42] redemption is to bring back what god
[1:18:46] always owes back into position
[1:18:49] salvation is for many many people on
[1:18:51] this earth brothers and sisters but
[1:18:53] redemption is only for a part of god
[1:19:01] my burns don't it
[1:19:03] that's why we got to know who we are
[1:19:06] i am sweating like a dog up here at the
[1:19:08] moment she freaks out you standing
[1:19:11] now
[1:19:12] she had the journey
[1:19:14] to meet isaac
[1:19:17] that right
[1:19:19] she got that get on the camels
[1:19:22] she went on the camels to meet
[1:19:25] isaac
[1:19:27] with her on the journey was eliezer
[1:19:30] and with her on the journey was the
[1:19:32] maidens
[1:19:34] and as she's on the journey
[1:19:37] she's got one thing on her mind
[1:19:40] oh my goodness
[1:19:42] that man
[1:19:47] she's got one man on her mind but the
[1:19:50] maidens are withered too
[1:19:53] is that right
[1:19:54] they're on the journey
[1:19:56] but only a one woman is going to get
[1:19:58] married
[1:19:59] praise the lord
[1:20:03] and on that journey she's going through
[1:20:04] a transformation
[1:20:06] she's just moving from the things from
[1:20:08] her her family's place as she's moving
[1:20:12] and moving up higher coming into a
[1:20:14] relationship with the one she can see in
[1:20:17] the invisible by a vision
[1:20:24] and she doesn't know it
[1:20:27] she's been moved
[1:20:29] by two
[1:20:30] reigns
[1:20:34] did you hear what i said
[1:20:37] she's been moved by
[1:20:40] two reigns
[1:20:42] and she don't know it
[1:20:44] how would i know
[1:20:45] because in this end time
[1:20:47] two reigns have come down
[1:20:50] right now to give us rapturing faith
[1:20:53] so i can go here and i can look back and
[1:20:56] know what happened back there because
[1:20:58] everything that god did back then goes
[1:21:00] in cycles of prophecy and here we are
[1:21:03] living at the end time and there's two
[1:21:05] rains that have come down and those
[1:21:07] rains are not only affecting god's elect
[1:21:11] it's affecting the whole
[1:21:13] world
[1:21:17] i found a quote this morning
[1:21:21] that will blow you out of the water
[1:21:26] it's going to be dynamite
[1:21:30] i'll read it to you in a moment to keep
[1:21:32] you in suspenders
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:38] and type
[1:21:39] we're not getting into it yet
[1:21:41] keeps you awake
[1:21:43] and type as she's moving towards isaac
[1:21:48] the fourth seal is on the earth
[1:21:52] is that right
[1:21:54] how has come up on the earth
[1:21:58] demon powers have been loosed
[1:22:02] as she's moving towards isaac
[1:22:06] is that right
[1:22:08] she's watching the world go insane
[1:22:11] as she's moving towards isaac
[1:22:17] and she's living in the prophecy of
[1:22:19] eliezer as she's moving towards isaac
[1:22:24] she's heard what uh what elias has said
[1:22:27] and she's looking at everything going on
[1:22:29] around her as she's moving towards isaac
[1:22:33] and her theophany
[1:22:35] is affecting her
[1:22:39] at the time
[1:22:40] of the evening sacrifice
[1:22:45] there shall be light
[1:22:47] in the evening time sacrifice
[1:22:50] is that right
[1:22:54] watch this girl
[1:22:57] sister rebecca
[1:23:04] my dear friends
[1:23:06] i hope this is happening to you
[1:23:10] and rebecca lifted up her eyes when she
[1:23:13] saw isaac
[1:23:15] and the prophecy had carried her to a
[1:23:18] destination she gets off the camels and
[1:23:21] she's seeing isaac
[1:23:23] who descended from heaven
[1:23:27] and a voice
[1:23:31] is that
[1:23:32] right for she said unto the servant
[1:23:37] elijah who is this man
[1:23:42] i feel pull
[1:23:43] from this man
[1:23:46] what matters is that walks in the field
[1:23:48] to meet us when at evening time
[1:23:51] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:23:53] and the servant has said it's my master
[1:23:57] therefore
[1:23:59] she took a bail
[1:24:02] and covered
[1:24:03] her
[1:24:05] head
[1:24:06] my dear friends
[1:24:08] when you cover your face with a veil
[1:24:12] there's only one person you're thinking
[1:24:13] about
[1:24:16] is the man you're going to marry
[1:24:19] but she could see through the veil
[1:24:25] she could see through the mail world
[1:24:27] events
[1:24:30] behind the veil she's only concerned
[1:24:32] about isaac
[1:24:33] remember behind the veil all she wants
[1:24:37] to know about is isaac but through the
[1:24:40] veil she sees the world falling apart
[1:24:44] praise the lord
[1:24:45] are you getting it yet
[1:24:47] the veil doesn't make you blind to
[1:24:49] what's going on the world
[1:24:51] the veil just shelters you from the
[1:24:54] effects as you're looking towards isaac
[1:25:01] she was no longer looking at the servant
[1:25:07] she wasn't looking any more out of
[1:25:09] family
[1:25:11] she wasn't looking at the damsels that
[1:25:13] were on the journey with her but didn't
[1:25:14] go
[1:25:15] weren't behind the same veil
[1:25:20] her prophetic surroundings had carried
[1:25:24] her to him
[1:25:27] and through the lattice of the veil
[1:25:29] she could see everything everybody else
[1:25:32] can see
[1:25:35] well
[1:25:36] ask the damsels
[1:25:37] is the world falling apart damsels yes
[1:25:40] it is
[1:25:42] uh is the force seal on the earth damsel
[1:25:44] oh yes
[1:25:48] are people going and saying on the earth
[1:25:49] the devil's oh yes it is
[1:25:51] well rebecca could say well through this
[1:25:54] veil i can see the same thing
[1:25:57] but behind the veil
[1:25:59] i only want to know about isaac
[1:26:02] my dear friends if you could get that
[1:26:04] into your hearts it does not matter what
[1:26:07] is happening to this world
[1:26:09] there could be a bunch of pumpkin heads
[1:26:11] in every government on this earth for a
[1:26:13] look at isaac
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:20] okay how many networks are running this
[1:26:22] world
[1:26:23] i'm looking at isaac
[1:26:26] and that he takes care of everything so
[1:26:28] you want to take care of all your
[1:26:30] problems it's because you're not looking
[1:26:32] at isaac you're not looking at jesus
[1:26:34] christ you're trying to do this
[1:26:36] everything on your own steam because
[1:26:38] you're not looking at him
[1:26:44] all that mattered to her is that she
[1:26:45] could see him
[1:26:47] and he took her into a tent
[1:26:49] into his tent
[1:26:52] and she took a veil
[1:26:54] and put it upon the shoulder
[1:26:56] of isaac
[1:26:58] to say you are my headship
[1:27:02] when she came out of the tent
[1:27:05] she did not have that physical veil on
[1:27:07] her but she was still veiled
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:13] because she was no longer looking at
[1:27:15] life
[1:27:18] through those old eyes
[1:27:21] she was connected to the revelation of
[1:27:24] who she was
[1:27:27] hey did you get it
[1:27:31] that is our foundation who you are
[1:27:35] in christ
[1:27:40] ain't gonna let no stupid news media or
[1:27:43] anything else like that try to talk me
[1:27:44] out of that i do not care what satan's
[1:27:47] eden says about this day and that we
[1:27:50] can't make it i'm looking at the one i'm
[1:27:52] married to
[1:27:54] and he said he would take care of me and
[1:27:56] he said he would take care of you get
[1:27:58] that into your head and never have a
[1:28:00] negative thoughts
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:05] all right
[1:28:06] we're going to talk about these two
[1:28:07] reigns
[1:28:09] if you catch this
[1:28:11] your problems are all over
[1:28:20] people say man you're a stirrer i know
[1:28:23] i do not deny it
[1:28:29] right
[1:28:31] watch these words
[1:28:34] those words mean far more than what most
[1:28:36] people realize
[1:28:38] the effect of merge reigns upon the
[1:28:40] elect
[1:28:42] and the world
[1:28:45] joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then you
[1:28:47] children of zion who's that that's the
[1:28:49] bride of christ is that right he said be
[1:28:51] glad he said not be sad
[1:28:53] amen
[1:28:54] is that right let's get the spelling
[1:28:56] right it says gl not s
[1:28:59] and rejoice is that what he says
[1:29:01] there was so many glum looking faces and
[1:29:03] yawning going on
[1:29:07] for he has given you the former rain
[1:29:09] moderately
[1:29:11] and will cause to calm down for you the
[1:29:13] rain
[1:29:15] when
[1:29:18] where
[1:29:20] rain comes in seasons
[1:29:24] rain comes in seasons for seed
[1:29:27] is that right
[1:29:28] there is a season you are a seed of god
[1:29:31] by election there are seasons for the
[1:29:34] seed
[1:29:37] the former rain and the latter rain in
[1:29:38] the first month or the coming together
[1:29:43] they didn't used to come together
[1:29:46] but they come together
[1:29:48] i tell you something
[1:29:52] this will uh make some fellas feel good
[1:29:56] i've been in this message for nearly 40
[1:29:58] years
[1:30:00] what used to irritate me so much
[1:30:03] was when these young guys
[1:30:06] his young ministers ben
[1:30:08] mathen
[1:30:09] andy
[1:30:10] now there's this young guy here
[1:30:12] [Laughter]
[1:30:15] catching on ten times faster than what i
[1:30:17] did
[1:30:20] after all the hard work and labor
[1:30:23] and these guys come in
[1:30:25] and get the same portion
[1:30:28] and i'm thinking
[1:30:32] just accept it man that's god's way
[1:30:37] and when i realized that i relax myself
[1:30:39] because god's doing her work
[1:30:42] they're right so i didn't want to
[1:30:43] embarrass you the arnold
[1:30:46] he's a good man don't worry
[1:30:48] i like arnold very much
[1:30:54] now watch
[1:30:55] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[1:30:59] where do you take wheat
[1:31:02] a garner
[1:31:03] is that right
[1:31:06] the bats is this a bat
[1:31:08] i want to say this is this this a bat
[1:31:10] full of wheat it's got to go to a place
[1:31:12] you don't go and feed the wheat to the
[1:31:14] ranch you put it in a storehouse to take
[1:31:15] it to another dimension
[1:31:17] praise the lords and the vats shall be
[1:31:19] full of wine and oil oh my goodness me
[1:31:22] they're so full of revelation that comes
[1:31:24] from the holy spirit
[1:31:26] we are in a time there's no restrictions
[1:31:29] on revelation
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:33] and i will restore to you and i'm going
[1:31:34] to ripping you right back to your true
[1:31:37] origins restoration and redemption is
[1:31:39] the same thing brothers and sisters
[1:31:43] all the years
[1:31:44] that got
[1:31:46] where you were getting eaten up in your
[1:31:48] six-sealed body
[1:31:51] all the blessings that you could not
[1:31:56] access right let's go deeper now
[1:32:01] no one no one's sleeping yet
[1:32:03] that's good you never sleep in front of
[1:32:06] me brethren
[1:32:09] it's mighty dangerous
[1:32:11] now watch
[1:32:13] former rain carves at the time seed is
[1:32:17] planted in the ground to start the
[1:32:20] growth
[1:32:21] that's a natural okay
[1:32:23] but spiritually it's when the lord
[1:32:25] brings the seed word teaching to his
[1:32:27] people to start the growth
[1:32:30] brought god brought a shout
[1:32:33] to activate the seed inside of you to
[1:32:36] start the growth
[1:32:39] is that right
[1:32:42] now
[1:32:43] the latter rain usually in the old
[1:32:46] testament comes seven months after the
[1:32:50] seed was sewn
[1:32:54] see it was sown
[1:32:55] seven church ages ago
[1:32:58] now something happens
[1:33:00] the rain comes months later after the
[1:33:02] plant has grown and brings it to final
[1:33:05] maturity
[1:33:06] spiritually it brings the word seed
[1:33:08] that's already been started growing in
[1:33:10] the soul to its adoption and to its
[1:33:14] maturity
[1:33:17] now there is a principle of god
[1:33:21] and this is the thing you must
[1:33:22] understand and that's why many ministers
[1:33:25] get so totally confused
[1:33:27] now i've met a lot of confused ministers
[1:33:29] i can tell you
[1:33:31] my their pack of trouble makers
[1:33:35] a principle of god
[1:33:37] what he does on a dispensation
[1:33:41] he does on the world level
[1:33:43] a nation level
[1:33:45] a church level a family level and an
[1:33:48] individual level
[1:33:50] so
[1:33:51] there is a capstone on a dispensational
[1:33:54] level but there must be the capstone in
[1:33:57] your personal life as an individual
[1:34:00] do you understand me now so you place
[1:34:02] prophecy over all these categories as
[1:34:05] they come down to one person
[1:34:09] praise the lord
[1:34:11] now we're going to look at what the
[1:34:12] prophet says
[1:34:14] about the political economic and
[1:34:16] religious world watch these things
[1:34:21] you see
[1:34:23] we can get we can so limit god
[1:34:27] by not reading all the other quotes
[1:34:31] he says
[1:34:33] then we find also this unrest
[1:34:36] what year was that 1960 man i was only a
[1:34:38] little candid in 60 and you talked about
[1:34:40] unrest back then
[1:34:42] look at that at the whole world now
[1:34:47] everything seems to be nervous unrest
[1:34:49] the time has run out east and west has
[1:34:52] met one another now we just told you
[1:34:54] something
[1:34:58] come forward from the east and went west
[1:35:00] and has come and met it now the natural
[1:35:02] world that parallels the spiritual world
[1:35:05] now the bible said in my scripture
[1:35:06] reading there would come a day when the
[1:35:08] lord would not be caught but called be
[1:35:09] neither day nor night it's a dismal day
[1:35:12] just enough light to see how to get
[1:35:14] around that's the day we've lived since
[1:35:16] the beginning and that's all the way
[1:35:18] during the church ages
[1:35:20] it was a dismal day during the church
[1:35:21] ages
[1:35:23] she says the sun rises and the east sets
[1:35:25] in the west not a different sun the same
[1:35:27] sun that rises in the east it's in the
[1:35:29] west civilization has traveled with the
[1:35:32] sun
[1:35:34] now i said but china was the oldest
[1:35:36] civilization our first that we have
[1:35:38] record of now we're back in the west
[1:35:41] coast where east and west has met
[1:35:44] civilization has traveled with it
[1:35:48] praise the lord
[1:35:52] he says and during the time in the east
[1:35:54] when the holy spirit was poured out
[1:35:55] first was on the eastern people is that
[1:35:57] right on the eastern people and in
[1:35:58] israel
[1:36:00] he says now i'm quoting this again he
[1:36:01] says they had the first light the sun
[1:36:03] shines in the east first and the s o r n
[1:36:07] shines in the east first on the eastern
[1:36:09] people now we've had a dismal day
[1:36:12] seven church ages
[1:36:14] didn't have any clarity of understanding
[1:36:16] was the dark time
[1:36:18] but like him at the end time you don't
[1:36:20] bring light if there's already light
[1:36:25] we've had enough light to walk in enough
[1:36:26] to believe it on the lord jesus and save
[1:36:29] so he's just talking about salvation we
[1:36:31] formed churches lutheran
[1:36:33] netherlands baptist presbyterian all
[1:36:34] those great churches but we've never
[1:36:36] exactly had a promise and a ladder rain
[1:36:39] as we're prophesied to have now he's
[1:36:41] saying that in 1960 but before the seals
[1:36:44] were open
[1:36:44] oh my
[1:36:47] it's getting close now
[1:36:52] in the last days there would be a ladder
[1:36:54] rain and the former rain and the latter
[1:36:55] rain would be together
[1:36:58] now the first rain was in the east the
[1:37:00] latter rain is in the west and in the
[1:37:02] latter rain
[1:37:03] both former rain and latter will be
[1:37:05] together
[1:37:09] we are in our time my dear friends
[1:37:11] we're teaching
[1:37:14] and maturing
[1:37:16] run together
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:21] so
[1:37:21] when some of these young guys
[1:37:24] start coming in
[1:37:25] and receive the former rain the teaching
[1:37:27] rain that came from the message of the
[1:37:29] hour the same holy ghost that ignited
[1:37:32] them brings them rapidly to maturity
[1:37:36] there is a rapid maturity over the earth
[1:37:40] there's a rapid maturity when amongst
[1:37:43] god's elect and it's causing the world
[1:37:45] to do the same thing
[1:37:50] brother says there's unrest
[1:37:53] there's an overlapping of the east and
[1:37:55] the west in the natural world and the
[1:37:56] east and west in the spiritual world so
[1:37:59] what was taught in the former rain
[1:38:01] overlaps and merges into the latter rain
[1:38:04] teaching
[1:38:06] and maturing
[1:38:07] comes together
[1:38:11] you can get taught something and within
[1:38:13] days stuck
[1:38:16] and you can't stop it
[1:38:18] because god's doing it
[1:38:20] but if a dirty low down teaching comes
[1:38:24] in
[1:38:25] you will go
[1:38:27] and mature into false teaching
[1:38:32] is that right
[1:38:35] now you know
[1:38:36] why ministry
[1:38:38] must be precisely accurate on the word
[1:38:41] why they had to be eunuchs
[1:38:45] they ain't meant to give seed of
[1:38:47] themself
[1:38:48] notice i'm taking it from the word of
[1:38:50] god not from brother adrian
[1:38:55] they'll watch
[1:38:57] i don't know if the techy stuff down
[1:38:58] here is going to make this work but it
[1:39:00] don't matter
[1:39:01] no it don't work but anyway
[1:39:04] it starts in the east
[1:39:06] and it goes to the west
[1:39:08] 2 000 years ago it started in the east
[1:39:11] and here we are it's in the west
[1:39:14] but when it comes out to the west as far
[1:39:16] as it can go where does it go back
[1:39:20] to the east
[1:39:23] what happens to america
[1:39:25] after it's gone as far west as it can go
[1:39:29] it goes down
[1:39:31] what's happening to china is coming up
[1:39:38] where is the message taking the most
[1:39:40] effect
[1:39:43] you do know what i'm talking about don't
[1:39:45] you
[1:39:49] uh that's how it's meant to go brethren
[1:39:52] it's turning but the tech up here was
[1:39:54] well you know we're not going to worry
[1:39:56] about that
[1:39:59] now watch
[1:40:02] here's the diagram of it
[1:40:04] you want to get it later on you can have
[1:40:06] it
[1:40:06] it starts in the east the son of man
[1:40:08] ministry where civilization started a
[1:40:11] former reign teaching in the east
[1:40:15] there's 2 000 years of teaching in the
[1:40:18] seven church ages
[1:40:19] and the church is eaten down in those
[1:40:22] seven church ages by the local uh the
[1:40:24] locust cankerworm what's first second
[1:40:25] third fourth seal
[1:40:30] here's the prophecy
[1:40:33] but at the end time
[1:40:36] there comes
[1:40:37] a cloud
[1:40:39] what does a cloud bring
[1:40:43] rain
[1:40:46] to what
[1:40:47] the siege
[1:40:50] do you understand now
[1:40:53] now he says here
[1:40:58] just stay with me because this is too
[1:41:00] important to miss out on okay
[1:41:04] a teaching
[1:41:06] on the second raid merges with the
[1:41:08] latter reign and revealed he says a
[1:41:10] strange thing our lord
[1:41:12] he was on earth he taught more of the
[1:41:14] second coming than he did of his going
[1:41:17] away he didn't talk about too much on of
[1:41:19] his first coming
[1:41:21] he was always speaking about a second
[1:41:22] coming
[1:41:24] is that right
[1:41:26] he said better than 80 of his talk was
[1:41:28] on his second coming he gave people
[1:41:30] warnings i'm just reading from the
[1:41:31] highlights if jesus talks so much uh 80
[1:41:34] of his time on the second coming then it
[1:41:36] behooves us to to listen and see what he
[1:41:39] said would take place he says you'll
[1:41:40] hear of nation rising against nation
[1:41:42] kingdom against kingdom you'll hear of
[1:41:44] these things
[1:41:45] what's causing it to happen
[1:41:49] and said down low as he says the fig
[1:41:51] tree putting forth its buds and all the
[1:41:52] other trees
[1:41:55] and then if you watch the scriptures
[1:41:58] nearly everything he's talking about is
[1:42:00] a second coming
[1:42:02] i won't read all this out
[1:42:04] compare it
[1:42:05] now everything's on his second coming
[1:42:07] he's only one bit on his first text
[1:42:09] first coming teaching
[1:42:12] now we go back to this this this new
[1:42:13] picture here
[1:42:16] when jesus came
[1:42:19] he had a teaching to
[1:42:21] the jews and samaritans under a son of
[1:42:24] man ministry
[1:42:27] but not to the jews
[1:42:28] oh sorry sorry not to the gentiles
[1:42:31] there was a former rain moderately
[1:42:34] this coming of the son of man the first
[1:42:36] time in the east
[1:42:40] everything goes around in a circle and
[1:42:41] merges in
[1:42:44] then there's a long dry season
[1:42:47] not much rain
[1:42:49] during the church ages
[1:42:51] not much holy ghost because there's not
[1:42:52] much of the word the holy ghost is
[1:42:54] connected to the word when there's more
[1:42:56] word there's more holy ghost is that
[1:42:58] right at the end time the word was
[1:43:00] released the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:43:01] comes down is that right that's just
[1:43:03] basically i'm just a farmer trained in
[1:43:04] the cow shed that's all i know
[1:43:07] at the end time
[1:43:08] comes the visitation of the son of man
[1:43:10] again
[1:43:12] so
[1:43:14] there is emerging at the end time
[1:43:17] of the latter rain and the former rain
[1:43:20] and it's going to do a rapid work
[1:43:24] amen
[1:43:26] so there's a cloud to bring the rain
[1:43:34] now watch now
[1:43:36] just keep that picture in your mind as
[1:43:38] we flip to another quote
[1:43:43] it says
[1:43:45] written in the resume of the ages he
[1:43:46] said this age started after the turn of
[1:43:48] the 20th century as it was to be an age
[1:43:50] in which the true church would return to
[1:43:52] being the bride she was at pentecost we
[1:43:54] know that there must of necessity be a
[1:43:57] return of dynamic power down next to the
[1:43:59] next hard highlights it was not for the
[1:44:03] latter rain can only come after the
[1:44:05] former rain which is the the spring or
[1:44:07] teaching rain now you watch the
[1:44:09] pentecostals today they think that they
[1:44:11] have the latter rain they ain't got
[1:44:13] anything at all because when the former
[1:44:15] rain came they rejected it
[1:44:17] and they could speak in tongues until
[1:44:18] the cows come home
[1:44:20] they ain't got the holy ghost
[1:44:22] they've just got an anointing on them
[1:44:24] they are not converted and yet they have
[1:44:27] gifts
[1:44:30] how could this be the real thing
[1:44:33] when the teaching lane had not come the
[1:44:35] prophet messenger who was to be sent to
[1:44:37] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[1:44:38] the children back to the pentecostal
[1:44:40] fathers had not come yet
[1:44:43] so with the pentecost he says it was a
[1:44:45] mixture of the unrighteous partaking
[1:44:49] it was also was with devil power as men
[1:44:52] were under the control of devils yet no
[1:44:54] one seemed to realize it then to prove
[1:44:57] that it was not real these people even
[1:44:59] before a second generation had appeared
[1:45:01] organized and wrote their unscriptural
[1:45:03] doctrines
[1:45:05] yet anointed by the holy ghost but
[1:45:07] without the holy ghost
[1:45:09] the rain was falling on them it was
[1:45:10] falling on their spirit they thought
[1:45:12] that they were born again they were not
[1:45:13] born again
[1:45:15] because they still look like the world
[1:45:16] acted like like the world and did
[1:45:18] everything like the world
[1:45:22] now
[1:45:23] next quote i'm having actually got to
[1:45:25] the
[1:45:25] the thing i wanted to to really hit
[1:45:28] are you with me now
[1:45:30] the serious time
[1:45:32] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:45:34] it says so it is this this time in this
[1:45:36] country that that person will appear for
[1:45:38] it's a scripture and it's thus saith the
[1:45:40] lord then in the latter rain there will
[1:45:41] come a mount carmel showdown bible
[1:45:43] fulfilled to the letter john the
[1:45:45] baptist's messenger before his face and
[1:45:47] malachi 3 planted a former reign and was
[1:45:49] rejected by the churches the
[1:45:51] denominations the pharisees and
[1:45:52] sadducees in his day jesus came and had
[1:45:55] a mount transfiguration showdown this
[1:45:57] forerunner of the last days or so for
[1:46:00] the former reign this is jesus will be
[1:46:02] the showdown between denominations and
[1:46:04] creeds which is the word when he comes a
[1:46:06] showdown the rapture of his bride
[1:46:10] praise the lord
[1:46:13] now
[1:46:15] i'm just going to click through
[1:46:18] i'm not going to read this but here i'm
[1:46:20] going to show you the quote i've got
[1:46:21] this morning
[1:46:26] and it's a right hum dinger
[1:46:31] because
[1:46:32] if you noticed
[1:46:35] in the last few years
[1:46:38] things have have gone sky high with
[1:46:40] inequity
[1:46:42] now the seals have been open since 1963
[1:46:47] it was a year that i started school
[1:46:50] and i watched the world deteriorate
[1:46:54] since then but in the last few years it
[1:46:57] went sky high
[1:47:00] hey they can't even tell the difference
[1:47:01] between a male and a female now how dumb
[1:47:04] can you get
[1:47:06] i can i can i know the difference
[1:47:08] between a male and female i won't even
[1:47:09] go in charge of 50 bucks to go and show
[1:47:11] them
[1:47:14] quick examination yourself soon find out
[1:47:16] whether you're a male or female
[1:47:22] i will
[1:47:23] i will
[1:47:25] they're a pack of insane weirdos
[1:47:30] totally demon possessed
[1:47:34] hell has come up and possessed them
[1:47:37] because of the rain
[1:47:43] now brother branham's just preached the
[1:47:45] seals
[1:47:47] he's preached the token
[1:47:49] and here it comes
[1:47:52] you ready
[1:47:58] after the seals i am looking for a time
[1:48:01] of a break forth of the spirit of god in
[1:48:04] these last days that we're now living in
[1:48:06] for another surge of the holy ghost and
[1:48:08] guess what it has come
[1:48:11] [Applause]
[1:48:14] and that is what's causing the world to
[1:48:17] go into chaos and you to go into
[1:48:20] maturity
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:23] we are in that search now
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:28] amen
[1:48:30] for rapturing faith just before it comes
[1:48:33] and everything is sitting straight in
[1:48:35] order for that but i declare to you this
[1:48:38] day prophecy has been fulfilled
[1:48:41] we are in it
[1:48:46] and the whole world is going stark
[1:48:48] raving mad because the rain is falling
[1:48:51] on the just
[1:48:53] and the unjust
[1:49:03] this is not some lying white male up
[1:49:05] here
[1:49:10] i'm telling you what a prophet said
[1:49:25] now we're going to go and just skip out
[1:49:26] a few of these things because otherwise
[1:49:28] it's going to be here till next year
[1:49:32] watch the scriptures
[1:49:34] watch the scriptures
[1:49:38] you're reading it
[1:49:39] proverbs proverbs is a parable
[1:49:43] a mystery
[1:49:45] that is revealed
[1:49:46] is that right
[1:49:48] proverbs chapter 16 verse 15 in the
[1:49:51] light of the king's countenance
[1:49:56] and that is that our kink
[1:49:59] is that the mighty android descent from
[1:50:00] heaven
[1:50:01] is that right he's come as prophet
[1:50:02] priest and king
[1:50:06] son of man
[1:50:07] priest into sitting are for thee for us
[1:50:11] and is our king
[1:50:13] the lamb has come the marriage of the
[1:50:15] lamb has come
[1:50:17] and who was the one who introduced that
[1:50:20] bride to the king it was the what was
[1:50:23] the angel with the seventh vial
[1:50:26] they're right and the angel with the
[1:50:28] seventh vial is there uh and he and a
[1:50:31] fire contains what a plague
[1:50:38] you see i see insanity coming upon the
[1:50:40] earth
[1:50:42] it's already happening
[1:50:44] but the seven vials is in the
[1:50:45] tribulation the fullness of everything
[1:50:47] is in the tribulation there's an amateur
[1:50:49] judgment on the earth right now
[1:50:54] and the light of the king's countenance
[1:50:56] is life or if i want life in this day i
[1:50:59] better look at the king's countenance
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:03] and when i look at the countenance i
[1:51:04] have his favor
[1:51:06] praise the lord i have found favor with
[1:51:09] the king
[1:51:11] amen and he's as the clown of the letter
[1:51:14] reign
[1:51:16] oh my goodness the scripture
[1:51:18] [Applause]
[1:51:20] and i saw
[1:51:23] another mighty angel descending from
[1:51:25] heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:51:27] and when he found me
[1:51:30] and he found you
[1:51:32] i found favor with him
[1:51:34] because he was connecting to his dna
[1:51:40] and i heard from my theophany because my
[1:51:43] dna was connecting to my reality
[1:51:46] i found favor in the cloud
[1:51:52] and as his face was the sun and his
[1:51:54] fetus pillars of fire and in his hand a
[1:51:56] little book open and guess what
[1:51:59] my name was found written in the book
[1:52:02] your name was found written in the book
[1:52:04] how do you know your name is found
[1:52:06] written in the book because there's a
[1:52:08] supernatural poll
[1:52:10] [Applause]
[1:52:12] at the right time right season
[1:52:14] oh somebody might be sitting in here i
[1:52:16] haven't had an experience yet with the
[1:52:18] lord don't worry there's a time in the
[1:52:20] season for each individual there's a
[1:52:21] dispensational season and a personal
[1:52:25] [Applause]
[1:52:28] season are you happy
[1:52:32] praise the lord
[1:52:34] favor means acceptance
[1:52:41] but to the world
[1:52:43] he was veiled
[1:52:46] but not to us
[1:52:49] he's not veiled to us
[1:52:50] is that right
[1:52:53] to the elected his face must become
[1:52:55] unveiled
[1:52:56] because it's the power to change into
[1:52:58] the same image
[1:53:02] the devil knows this concept of god
[1:53:06] if you keep looking and looking and
[1:53:08] looking
[1:53:09] at every garbage that comes out on the
[1:53:11] social news media you will be changed
[1:53:14] into the image of that garbage
[1:53:18] is that right
[1:53:20] and that's why you have everybody going
[1:53:22] around
[1:53:24] like a bunch of zombies fiddling around
[1:53:26] with a stupid screen all day long
[1:53:28] and what they've been is a change into
[1:53:30] the image of the idiocracy they see on
[1:53:31] the screen
[1:53:32] but god comes down with an open book and
[1:53:34] he says look on this and be changed into
[1:53:37] the image what you look at so he rips
[1:53:40] the veil off of himself rips the vial
[1:53:43] off of you and now you have a contact to
[1:53:45] look directly at your reflection
[1:53:54] bloodbath gives the parable
[1:53:56] oh i don't even gonna last
[1:53:59] oh body just needs changing
[1:54:05] look you're just gonna have to get the
[1:54:06] notes okay you're going to see brother
[1:54:07] ben afterwards
[1:54:10] there's just no way i can finish this i
[1:54:12] i'm not even 10 percent through
[1:54:14] because i've just i i'll knock off in
[1:54:16] about 15 minutes that's it
[1:54:18] your body is just talking already
[1:54:21] brother brown talked about
[1:54:29] rather than talked about the little boy
[1:54:31] in the bush you know
[1:54:34] and that little boy had a daddy who
[1:54:36] shaved in a mirror up on a tree
[1:54:39] it was a piece of broken mirror
[1:54:41] you know the story
[1:54:44] and so
[1:54:45] he watched his dad shaving in that
[1:54:47] mirror
[1:54:49] and all you could see in the mirror
[1:54:51] was his daddy's head
[1:54:53] see he only see a part of the person in
[1:54:55] that mirror and for seven church ages
[1:54:59] the bride could only see a portion of
[1:55:01] the prophecy
[1:55:02] is that right but at the end time there
[1:55:05] was an invitation to go to auntie's
[1:55:07] house in the city
[1:55:09] and so he came from one location to
[1:55:12] another location
[1:55:15] and there was a house in the city with
[1:55:16] seven steps going up into the passage
[1:55:18] which was in the house
[1:55:21] is that right
[1:55:22] and so god is taking us from a portion
[1:55:25] of understanding
[1:55:26] to see ourselves
[1:55:29] fully
[1:55:30] because in that passage at the end of
[1:55:32] the passage was a full-length mirror
[1:55:35] that shows you in all your totality
[1:55:39] you're not no longer looking through a
[1:55:41] dark glas
[1:55:42] glass darkly at yourself you are seeing
[1:55:44] the fullness of yourself
[1:55:47] but he had to go and walk up
[1:55:50] and see the image
[1:55:51] he says
[1:55:53] is this real or not don't have a walk
[1:55:54] don't go get closer boy
[1:55:56] don't get scared don't have a closer
[1:55:58] look at yourself
[1:56:02] is that right and he walked up closer
[1:56:04] and closer and he said as he waved in
[1:56:07] the mirror
[1:56:09] esther waved back
[1:56:12] as he waved in the mirror ruth waved
[1:56:14] back
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:16] as he waved in the mirror hannah way
[1:56:18] back
[1:56:19] as he waved in the mirror abraham waved
[1:56:21] back and he looked in the mirror all the
[1:56:24] female attributes of god ways back
[1:56:29] and was seeing his walk
[1:56:31] her walk
[1:56:34] from genesis to revelation
[1:56:36] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:56:39] ordered by the lord
[1:56:40] though i fall though i fall
[1:56:43] in my flesh
[1:56:45] i should not be cast down
[1:56:47] the bible says
[1:56:49] and
[1:56:50] romans 8
[1:56:52] he says when you have come to receive
[1:56:54] the spirit of god there's no more
[1:56:56] consciousness of sin now get it now know
[1:56:58] what consciousness means no more desire
[1:57:01] you can still fall
[1:57:04] is that right
[1:57:05] you can still fall over because you're
[1:57:07] flesh
[1:57:08] but there's no more desire and what
[1:57:09] happens when you fall over in your flesh
[1:57:11] get back up again stop grizzling
[1:57:14] all right get back up again and one john
[1:57:17] chapter one he says uh if you he says if
[1:57:19] a man says he does not sin he's a liar
[1:57:22] and one john chapter 3 says a man cannot
[1:57:24] sin
[1:57:28] because the seed remains
[1:57:30] so he's talking about the outside man
[1:57:31] can sin and if you say this does not sin
[1:57:34] you're a liar but if you say this sin
[1:57:36] you cannot sit in here because the word
[1:57:38] is inside here
[1:57:39] so this sins and forms over get back up
[1:57:42] god's looking at this
[1:57:46] tell it to the devil
[1:57:48] don't let a negative thought come into
[1:57:50] your heart brothers and sisters
[1:57:53] oh look what he did look what he did if
[1:57:56] god don't remember it why should you
[1:57:58] the devil keep reminding you every time
[1:58:00] you find special you young fellas i know
[1:58:02] what teenagers is like i happen to have
[1:58:04] been one of them once years ago
[1:58:07] and i wasn't exactly a very polite one
[1:58:10] either
[1:58:11] but god by his grace redeems me
[1:58:16] did you ever notice brothers and sisters
[1:58:20] this perfect god
[1:58:23] he put all the stars
[1:58:26] perfectly in place
[1:58:28] rotating in their in their right
[1:58:30] positions
[1:58:32] he was so great and he goes and makes
[1:58:34] the botany life and all the botany life
[1:58:36] is so perfect and all the cells got
[1:58:38] these words of plastic but everything
[1:58:40] but the cells were so perfectly in order
[1:58:43] is that right such a great creator
[1:58:46] and then and then this great creator he
[1:58:50] puts in the bible the worst people on
[1:58:52] the earth
[1:58:56] the worst bunch of people
[1:58:58] thieves and liars and murderers
[1:59:04] oh my goodness
[1:59:05] he was so perfect
[1:59:08] to show his retention
[1:59:10] i shake my head man
[1:59:11] [Applause]
[1:59:13] i cannot find anybody in the bible that
[1:59:15] was a decent guy when they started out
[1:59:19] that's how great our god is
[1:59:22] is that right
[1:59:24] oh my goodness me
[1:59:31] here's james
[1:59:33] you've got you've just got to love james
[1:59:34] i tell you so this guy read the old
[1:59:35] testament
[1:59:40] be patient oh who's patient around this
[1:59:42] place you know i've missed some
[1:59:43] impatient people
[1:59:45] i want it yesterday lord
[1:59:50] be patient therefore brethren they
[1:59:52] saying that to the brethren not to the
[1:59:53] worldly people now brethren be patient
[1:59:55] is that right of you fellas
[2:00:01] after the coming of the lord
[2:00:04] speaking for the seven church ages now
[2:00:07] behold the husbandman waiters
[2:00:10] hey look look at the words what does a
[2:00:12] husbandman do
[2:00:14] a husbandman is a person who looks after
[2:00:16] plants
[2:00:17] and seeds is that right
[2:00:19] he didn't go and say the farmer
[2:00:21] said the husbandman
[2:00:23] he talked about nature botany life but
[2:00:25] he's bringing in a spiritual sense
[2:00:29] behold the husbandman waiteth
[2:00:31] well a husbandman just doesn't go plant
[2:00:34] the seed that
[2:00:36] not over seven church ages that don't
[2:00:39] for the precious fruit of the earth and
[2:00:41] has long patience for it until he
[2:00:44] received the early
[2:00:45] and later rain
[2:00:49] he's by the seven churches
[2:00:53] amen
[2:00:55] now
[2:00:58] when you ask anything of the lord yes it
[2:01:01] must be seasonal
[2:01:06] did you get what i said
[2:01:10] he said ask ye the lord
[2:01:14] reign in the time of the latter rain
[2:01:18] amen
[2:01:19] you must ask according to the season
[2:01:23] so the lord shall make bright clouds
[2:01:26] and give them showers of rain to
[2:01:28] everyone grass in his field he's talking
[2:01:30] about your spiritual walk
[2:01:35] you know why some people get nothing
[2:01:38] because they don't ask
[2:01:45] if i don't get an answer
[2:01:48] i keep going back
[2:01:50] and back
[2:01:52] and back
[2:01:53] because in the book of luke maybe 19
[2:01:56] or whatever
[2:01:57] there was a widow woman
[2:02:01] who got
[2:02:02] and she lost her husband
[2:02:04] and the seven church ages
[2:02:06] in the end time she's come with a desire
[2:02:09] to be avenged of her enemy
[2:02:11] and she comes up to an unjust judge and
[2:02:14] so the lord puts himself as an unjust
[2:02:16] judge he's a just judge but he's just
[2:02:18] putting himself in that parable form
[2:02:21] and he's the kind of man and she comes
[2:02:23] up says offends me of my enemy says no
[2:02:26] avenge me of my enemy
[2:02:33] i want some blessings no
[2:02:38] she keeps going back and back and back
[2:02:40] and drives and clean up the wall
[2:02:44] he says she's he says all right you can
[2:02:46] have it
[2:02:49] and he says shall i find faith
[2:02:51] when revelations 10 has been revealed at
[2:02:53] the end time
[2:02:55] shall i find that time of faith
[2:02:59] that you can ask and keep asking and
[2:03:01] keep asking and keep asking until he
[2:03:04] gives it to you because he doesn't want
[2:03:06] want some so
[2:03:09] soft soap believers
[2:03:13] where everything just falls into into
[2:03:15] their lap
[2:03:16] wants someone if you've got some
[2:03:18] problems in your life
[2:03:20] you can ask
[2:03:21] keep asking keep asking keep asking
[2:03:25] i've been delivered over
[2:03:26] from some things i've had for 60 years
[2:03:32] and do you think i could get rid of
[2:03:33] these things
[2:03:34] i ain't going to go and give you the
[2:03:36] list
[2:03:39] i'm 63. i had had a problem for 60 years
[2:03:44] i got it from my
[2:03:45] natural dna of my parents
[2:03:48] and you think i could throw it
[2:03:51] but i kept asking

[2:04:17] straight man
[2:04:19] i don't like the wishy-washy preachers
[2:04:22] man
[2:04:25] it makes me sick in my stomach listen to
[2:04:27] some women
[2:04:29] the scenery for the end time later reign
[2:04:31] is speaking now at the end time
[2:04:33] go ye now you rich man weep in hell for
[2:04:36] your miseries that shall come upon you
[2:04:40] your riches are corrupted your garments
[2:04:43] are moth eaten your gold and your silver
[2:04:45] is cankered and all the banks are
[2:04:46] rusting apart
[2:04:48] what
[2:04:49] was it talking about silver and gold is
[2:04:51] the banking system is that right it's
[2:04:53] where you value things the whole thing
[2:04:55] is conquered
[2:04:57] you shall end shall witness against you
[2:04:59] and shall eat your flesh as it were fire
[2:05:01] you have heaped up treasure together for
[2:05:03] the last days
[2:05:04] behold the heart of your labor is who
[2:05:06] you ripped off
[2:05:10] that's how farmers talk anyway
[2:05:15] and reaped your fields which is of you
[2:05:18] of you kept back by fraud crieth that
[2:05:20] the cries of them which have reaped are
[2:05:22] entered into the ears of the lord of
[2:05:24] sabawath it's not the lord of sabbath
[2:05:28] sabbath it means
[2:05:30] the lord of war
[2:05:35] you have lived in pleasure on the earth
[2:05:37] and been wanted you have nourished your
[2:05:40] hearts as in the day of slaughter
[2:05:43] what are we seeing on the earth right
[2:05:44] now what's god doing
[2:05:47] the rain is forcing every human being
[2:05:50] and to come into a maturity of the seed
[2:05:53] that has
[2:05:54] been placed in them now
[2:05:56] i'm just going to say some things as it
[2:05:58] flashes in front of me
[2:06:01] in fact i'm going to end up on this look
[2:06:03] i haven't even got a part away through
[2:06:04] this but you have to get the notes okay
[2:06:07] a teaching reign on a dispensational
[2:06:10] level
[2:06:12] will bring a dispensation to a maturity
[2:06:18] a teaching reign that comes from the
[2:06:20] word of god upon you
[2:06:22] will bring you to a very rapid maturity
[2:06:26] now let's say you start teaching
[2:06:29] yourself something that's wrong about
[2:06:30] yourself
[2:06:35] on a personal scale
[2:06:37] you start teaching yourself
[2:06:39] all right
[2:06:40] i'm just no good
[2:06:44] how you're going to end up
[2:06:47] i've ministered all around the world
[2:06:50] and i can go into a church
[2:06:55] and i know whether that church is going
[2:06:56] to end up in a total disaster or not
[2:07:00] i was in a certain country once
[2:07:02] preaching with an american minister
[2:07:05] come to the last meeting
[2:07:07] and five people came in
[2:07:10] that were not a part of that church
[2:07:12] and i was and they are people from a
[2:07:14] false teaching
[2:07:16] and i'm looking at them and they'll kind
[2:07:18] of yet get get get that sort of people
[2:07:20] like yapping like a jack russell dog
[2:07:24] and when the meeting was over
[2:07:27] they started maneuvering around that
[2:07:30] church teaching false stuff
[2:07:34] within a few months
[2:07:36] that whole church went into two souls
[2:07:38] doctrine
[2:07:42] rapidly
[2:07:45] amen
[2:07:47] it took years and years and years to
[2:07:50] clean that garbage out of that church
[2:07:56] i have seen people in this message
[2:08:00] come and talk to me and i'm listening to
[2:08:02] the what they are talking about
[2:08:05] and i sometimes warn people i said now
[2:08:08] that man or that woman or this person or
[2:08:10] this person they're going to cause a
[2:08:11] church split
[2:08:14] why
[2:08:15] because i hear what they are saying
[2:08:18] and inside of themselves they have
[2:08:20] taught themselves that they are
[2:08:22] something that god has not made them
[2:08:26] amen
[2:08:29] and i warn people i says watch that
[2:08:32] watch that watch that watch that some
[2:08:34] people don't even listen says look man
[2:08:36] this is a dangerous time if you teach
[2:08:39] yourself something the wrong way you're
[2:08:41] going to rapidly grow into it
[2:08:45] amen
[2:08:47] now let's just say you have something in
[2:08:49] your life
[2:08:51] that should not be there okay
[2:08:54] now catch this something in your life
[2:08:56] that should not be there
[2:08:59] now let's say it's a lust that should
[2:09:01] not be there okay well just
[2:09:03] hypothetically now okay
[2:09:06] now
[2:09:08] if you say in your heart i don't want
[2:09:11] that to be there
[2:09:13] god can deal with it
[2:09:15] the moment you say oh it's okay it's
[2:09:17] okay i can keep this i can keep this
[2:09:20] boof
[2:09:22] you're going to turn straight into the
[2:09:24] image of that lust you have
[2:09:31] what's causing it
[2:09:32] the surge of the holy ghost
[2:09:35] at this end time is making the whole
[2:09:37] world
[2:09:38] become what it is
[2:09:40] is that right
[2:09:49] all right we will stop there look
[2:09:50] brethren it's too big a sermon
[2:09:55] now you got to ask yourselves right now
[2:09:59] now this is why when i look at the
[2:10:01] church like this i said praise god me
[2:10:05] i look at our church in strep i say
[2:10:07] thank you jesus
[2:10:10] because i watch what's getting taught
[2:10:14] i watch what the pastor and the
[2:10:16] ministers are teaching
[2:10:17] and what they teach
[2:10:19] goes on the people
[2:10:21] and then they grow straight into a
[2:10:23] maturity like that
[2:10:27] i'm so thankful
[2:10:28] for righteous pastors
[2:10:31] that have a revelation
[2:10:34] of this message
[2:10:37] and you pray for those pastors
[2:10:40] that god will protect them
[2:10:43] i'm not a pastor but i know what they go
[2:10:46] through
[2:10:49] nice watch
[2:10:51] i know many many pastors worldwide my
[2:10:53] god they suffer
[2:10:56] and the devil taunts him and and gets
[2:10:59] them to feel depressed about these these
[2:11:00] things and as long as they start getting
[2:11:02] depressed and thinking in that depressed
[2:11:04] state they are going to go into some big
[2:11:07] troubles
[2:11:08] but what about you
[2:11:10] brothers and sisters this is the hour
[2:11:13] that you can pray

[2:12:10] fallen
