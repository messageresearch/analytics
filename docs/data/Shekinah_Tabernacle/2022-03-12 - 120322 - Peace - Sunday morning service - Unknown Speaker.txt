this morning lord we just pray bless the service bless us time lord be thank you for this technology that we can um do a church service even when we are all apart we thank you lord for the the things you've designed even these man-made things that they can aid us in your kingdom so we just pray a bless this service lord and bless um yeah the ministry we just want to commit to you in jesus name amen amen okay you can um take your seats again i'm actually going to have my seat because um we had a guard this last night and we decided that the way the computers the camera was this is a better um shot brother head was joking that it's my filmmaking stuff going into play but um in film if you do the camera low and you point up at someone it shows like that they've got this sort of they're a powerful person then they're looking down on the camera and when i stood up and looked down at the camera it looked like that and i was a bit put off right so i'm just going to um sit here and do it this way um the the message that i have on my heart today is a sermon called peace and i won't be as always i won't be telling you anything that you don't already know um i'm just going to be talking about things that you already know but i just sort of package it together a whole lot of a lot of things you know and put it together so um and we actually do have people here they're my family all hide from the camera but they're all like sitting there there's people there there's people david and everyone else they're over i'm sorry where are they they're all they're all there david's there everybody's here but they don't seem to like the camera don't blame them here we go now i can hear some people that's good amen let's get some a little bit of feedback okay so so now i'm going to go through this reasonably fast but brother you only did a short song service so he's actually left me with quite a bit of time which is good um the so the message is peace and it's a very powerful word peace and it's something that we all want i believe in our life is peace it's a it's a wonderful thing and when you have peace we're really happy who enjoys peace peace is good i'm always very grateful and i've got peace i'm always very very grateful because i know that it's a blessing of god that we can have peace so that's what i want to speak about but but in order to get where i'm going with my um thought i've got modern technology this microphone is set up that when i tap it the slide changes miraculously [Laughter] yeah um but in order to talk about peace we have to acknowledge that the time that we are living in now is definitely not a time of peace across the board we are living in a time of war and like if i had a program of the way that things were happening i would look at the program and say okay so now at this time we have a time of war or if i looked at the season that we were in i would say okay at the moment it's a season of war and no amount of um whether it be a natural war united nations deliberations or whether it be conflicts between people or conflicts between anybody there's actually no amount of of energy or effort that we could put in will actually stop this from being a time of war amen we don't we've gone to the point where this is what we we will we will reap what we've sown we as in humans mankind not not the bride but mankind it's just it's the season that we're in there is there is nothing that we can do to get out of this or try and work out some big plan politicians and everybody will try and work out plans and schools and everything will try and teach people a certain way to be peaceful but that it actually won't happen that way because this is now the season that we're in this is all that's on the program is a time of war i've got a scripture here and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you've been not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet and i just gathered a few photos there to show examples of the fact that even though we have enjoyed a relative time of natural peace for a while we have actually mankind have just got a thing about fighting wars and we just we we have wars for all different reasons but there's a there are a few photos there that show war and conflict that only in the last 100 years that man have been in and if you study history there have been a lot of conflicts but there haven't there hasn't been a time where there has been so much conflict in general as what we are engaged what we're engaged in now um it works but there are always reasons why things happen there's a reason why this is a season of war it doesn't just happen and we and there's no no it's not the result of some um action or it's not a consequence we always live in consequences i was overhearing sister letabo's um sunday school lesson this morning and she talked about consequences and we are right now we are we are as a world we are living in the in consequences um for what we've done as mankind you know and the path that collected that generally we've chosen to take now not us as a as sons and daughters of god but the world in general and has chosen to take a certain path and um and it's also a time that is going to be like this anyway but there are reasons why things are like how they are it doesn't just happen and we can't understand the reason why it doesn't just spring upon us and we say well i didn't know that was gonna happen like this that's right we can we can understand by the wisdom of god and by his word why we can understand why things are happening a certain way so there are two reasons if you really boil it down there are two reasons why we are in a time of war the first one is is because it's a it's it's a uniting time a dividing time and a harvest time they all sound like they are different things but they all uh correlate back together you can bring that back up yep there you go um not that you tried to bring it down but they all correlate together these th this idea or this this thought uniting time and dividing time and harvest time they're actually all relatively talking about the same thing and and within that within that reason there you get a lot of conflict in that reason and i'll take you through that um next but the other reason why is because the second reason why is because the world's rejected the prince of peace and now we are governed by what i'm going to call the prince of war yeah that the governing power that man has chosen to rule over them is is is not a prince of peace he desires war that's right and that's satan his kingdom of darkness desires war he desires conflict that's all that he knows he doesn't know peace he doesn't know how to create peace and create an environment where people are happy and at peace that he doesn't that that's non-existent in his and his um when he plans his schemes so the more he rules the more we will get conflict in every every area of life now you'll see when i go through this that i'm not talking about guys getting out and guys and girls getting out guns and shooting each other there is more to war and conflict than just that although that is going to be part of the conflict in some places some places are at war without people firing shots but there's this conflict in this war that's right so um i want to start off with this thought about it being a uniting time in a dividing time and a harvest time which all correlate to war or conflict luke 21 verse 29 to 31 says and he spoke to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is night hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand so we know that the fig tree is talking about israel when it's becoming um when it's becoming a nation again and it's blossoming again and it's becoming something when we see that then we know okay the end is not at hand when we see it starting to to come forth and become everything that it was designed to be um but in the scripture it says behold the fig tree and all the trees so there's a time when israel starts coming into being and starts to grow but at the same time everything is doing the same thing because it's becoming into a harvest time so that before that this is an important factor fact but that i want to explain it like this is where the world essentially was in a season like what you see here these trees that they're all kind of the same there's not too much difference between them when they don't have any leaves when you can't quite see what they are they just look like this you know there's there's a certain degree of unity i suppose you could say when you look at this they nothing really stands out from the other unless you're an arborist then you understand trees you can maybe maybe there are three or four different trees in this and you can say that tree is this that tree is that but if you didn't generally know that trees very well you could look at a bunch of trees like this and you wouldn't really know what they are and they're none of them are standing out one from another or or none of them are making any bold statements because it's all just branches and that no no leaves no fruit you can't quite see what they are and when when the world before israel started to burden that the world essentially is looking like this so there's not this ability for a whole lot of differences because it's just they're all kind of looking like this so within this you could say within the state you don't really have much difference there's not much bold statements and people and nations and everything becoming what they are um but if we go if we see i want to give an example like like this tree here things are quite quiet when it's the tree on the right with no leaves in that it's quite a quiet time in terms of there's nothing pushing forth and making statements but when you get to a point where there are leaves and there's everything's pushing forth it's a loud it's a bold time you understand like there it's a time where everything is becoming what it is so that means good and that means evil they're becoming what they are in a powerful way and as a result of that you start to get differences start to get shown and conflicts start because things are expressing themselves more what they are so that's because we're coming into that time everything whether it be good or whether it be evil is now pushing out powerfully more than what it ever was because it's it's it's this time it's a things are coming forth it's a harvest time um and differences in this scenario if you don't have to be an arborist to look at it look at the bunch of trees that and say well that's an apple tree that's a because i see an apple on it that's a fig tree because i see a fig on it that's a pine tree because i kind of know the pine needles the way that that's they they're not just the newest but you understand they become more apparent and things are expressing themselves a lot more um and also in this harvest time it's a dividing time in terms of when jesus talked about it he said that you know when the tears were sowed amongst the wheat they all grew together there was a time where they were all growing together and although you kind of knew they were different they all could dwell together and grow together and without too much fuss i suppose you could say there wasn't too much conflict they were just all let to grow when it rained they would all be blessed together because the rain would come and all the wheat would grow but the tears would grow as well because it's raining this is nice i can grow each one could grow together and you couldn't really tell one from the other essentially they were all sort of mixed everything was just growing and you could say they were all kind of getting along to a degree because they were just all doing around about the same thing it's a there was a time when it was like that but at the end time there's a separation starts to happen and that's why jesus said you know at the end gather the tears together and bind them up and put them over here and take the wheat and put it this way so start to separate everything so now they become this starts to become when things separate there you start to see the differences you realize okay now that's wheat and that's tear it's it becomes there are differences which create that starts to create conflict because before that they when everything is the same there's not really conflict that they're just all the same it's just going together but when things start to separate yeah and bind together the the the the it creates a betting ground for conflict you understand what i mean it starts to things are starting to at one on one hand show what they are they're starting to fruit so this that and that's different than that that's different than that um things are being bound together and being separated and it's creating conflict um there's a scripture here that says we were false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but immediately they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree brings forth corrupt fruit so this goes along with what i was saying about the fact that next one i'll just bring you this next one when we get in this harvest time things are manifest what they are there's no hiding now what they are that's a it's a fig tree there's fruit and it's also coming into bed so we have we have a climax i've written it here it's the climax or expression for a tree or a plant it's it's it's finals it's a final expression of what it is it's fruit because after when it when a tree will grow and bear fruit it bears all this wonderful fruit and then it actually then it dies that's the end of it because it wants to once you put more life forth because all this life is on the seed and then it drops the fruit off and then hopefully someone eats that piece of fruit and they walk away and throw the apple somewhere else and then the seed grows there it wants to it wants to spread out this god's way of getting the trees to multiply but at the same time it's so it's a climax of everything that's in the tree it wants to come out at the end it's a it expresses itself and we are in this time where not only are things being separated and divided but everything is being separated and showing what it is and expressing itself and it's it's creating a lot of conflict now i've got this to give an example of how this idea works in mankind god knows that the human psyche operates like this because when man all spoke one language and they were building the tower of babel because a man they live men and women live for a long time so they could acquire a lot of knowledge that back then that was one especially but also but the other aspect was they were they could they all spoke the same language so they all got on together because they were all of one there wasn't anything separating them so they could easily get along and you could say there wasn't any conflict amongst them because they had the same culture disputes could be resolved i would say relatively easily because they could all talk about it they understood each other they were all of one and when god went down he said let's go down and see them and he said because they all speak the same language there and they've got the same culture essentially they're all one people and now they can work together and and do these sorts of things so so god had to find a way to separate them so that they wouldn't all be able to work together and and that they would they would separate and so what he did was he he mixed up all the language and made them all speak a different language so you can imagine in the aftermath of all that everyone had to talk and talk and talk until they they suddenly encountered someone that they no longer got along with because they couldn't communicate and while they may have known that person yesterday as john they couldn't now now i couldn't communicate with john so the next day they wouldn't have had so much conflict with them because they knew still john they just couldn't talk to him but they would have started to go towards gravitate towards people that they could speak to when they heard their language being spoken they would be they would think hey use the same language as me let's let's now team up you know i'll spend time with you i won't spend time with john anymore even though maybe john was as maybe he doesn't want to hang out with john anymore because he can't talk to john he wants he will go and spend time with the people he can that that is right like-minded like him and then over time this was actually the start of all of our conflict over time these people separated they began to move away because they thought i just don't get on with john and his people anymore i can't talk to them i don't understand them and as time went on they started to form their own culture and their own way of doing things and suddenly john formed his own culture and his own way of doing things with his people when you started having differences and within that that's why we have all the wars and differences we have today is because people don't understand they don't understand the language they don't understand the culture they think these guys are scheming something funny about us but we don't know what it is because we don't understand them you know that's that that was that started to create a conflict but it was through the through people separating and showing and becoming something different that conflict starts that was an example of what's happening today and that's why the scripture says can two walk together except they be agreed but now because everyone's ideas are fruiting it's hard for people to walk together now because everyone's ideas are showing what they are in a loud way this is my idea this is this idea this is that one it's loud and there's there's this you've got a situation where people can't walk together because and it's creating conflict that's right and i've got this one here that every idea every set in every belief everything is fully fruiting now of what it is everything it's becoming powerful and as a result enemies and friends are appearing that's like oh he speaks my language i will team up with him they don't i don't like them these are my people here that's not my people there whereas one day before that these were my people it was we were all friends but now it's now there's a separation happening between a lot of people a lot of sex and everything and ideas and it's you've got this betting ground for conflict and it's what's happening now is there's a there is conflict and war starting between all these different factions in the world that's the that's the hour that we live in and it's only getting worse these are we are becoming the world is it becoming a divided and divisive place and everyone is being separated out now i've got this little picture here this is to make fun of it but this is what is actually happening you know if we all if you put yourself in a room full of about 200 people and you gave everyone a different color hat some were pink some were blue some are red some are orange some are black you would for some strange reason you would think you hadn't if you had a black hat on you had to keep the black hat on you would you would seem to think for some reason you have an affiliation with the people with the black hat on like okay that uh we must be kind of the same group because you've got a black hat on so away yeah yeah if you ever got a black cat and you're gonna mix all the people with the red hat it's like uh well i'm always the guy with the black hat you guys always the people with the red hat i'm kind of like this is different you know like and and if the yellow people if the yellow people did something to the yellow hat there's something people with the black hat on then you would suddenly fear you would have now an indifference towards the people with the yellow hat but that may have just been a little conflict between one unique person with the yellow and one unique person with the black but because you've got a black hat you'd think oh well i'm now i've got a conflict with the yellow hat people because one of their people did this to the black cat people yeah yeah it sounds silly but this is and and the way that satan has devised it now as well is to put people to give people different hats and to get people into different to to convince people you're part of this group you're part of that you're part of that to create a conflict that's part of his his plan of creating conflict like when when god comes down and preaches his word he says that we're all one in christ and in the in the believers in the body of christ there's this concept that we're all one and christ is unity in the body of christ but there has been no time in the world where there's so much disunity among people because they've all been given different hats and they've they've all been labeled certain ways you you must be if you think that you must be this group then if you think that you must be in that group and there's a there's conflict starting to arise in a powerful way very powerful um right okay that's that is what's happening and you'll see it happening more and more as as time goes on you'll see you'll see times where there once was no conflict between groups or peoples there's now conflict and and separation between them and between ideas and the people are becoming separated to their own groups and the second the second powerful reason is because people have rejected the prince of peace now i've got this we can easily say this but that's that's it's more than just a sentence oh we've done that therefore we get this it's a it's a very powerful thing because we get governed by ideas yeah that's and when we surrender our life to the lord and we let the holy ghost come and lead our life we get governed by his ideas and and then we then live out his ideas we might say don't steal so then we go out to society and we don't steal you know or we we say to be kind to one another and love one another so when we we're governed by that idea then we go out to society and we we live that out through society right but but when we reject the prince of peace then we get governed by the when you reject light you get governed by darkness by default i've just got this here about peace peace is an attribute of god galatians 5 22 says but the but the fruit of the spirit is love joy and peace long suffering given us goodness faith meekness temperance it's part of the the attribute of god when we have when when mankind gets god in their heart they will by default have this desire for peace as a general idea i just like photos like this because i could just imagine this nice family going along to church and the dad would always be teaching good values to his children and saying you know you want to be peaceful and all this and the mum will be doing the same and you create awesome people in society that go out and and shine the light of god in society and make the world a better place that's right what you get and i and you know there's a scripture that says blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god and i believe that sons and daughters of god are peacemakers when you get into a situation you desire for there to be peace you don't desire conflict we don't desire to have conflict in fighting we desire peace i've got this picture here because i can often think about you know armies that are a war for some silly reason and some and someone comes up with an idea to somehow create peace and he says i want to go and go and see that army and see if we can't work out and i want to go with terms of peace that we can work out our differences without having this big conflict peacemakers and that god values people that are peacemakers if you want to be anything in your life be a peacemaker amen the peacemakers if you want to be called a child of god then be a peacemaker now going on to this essentially what we have said what we have said to is that we want to turn the light off you know because god is light and his light shines in it it's he's love but he's also light and he shines the light on things and it keeps everything okay what we've said now is turn the light off we don't want light anymore mankind says turn the light off i want to explain it doesn't matter how how smart we think we are how great we think our ideas are in society and how we think we're going to excel with this progressive idea if you turn the lights off you get darkness it doesn't matter what you think it's going to be you get darkness and then darkness there's confusion and darkness you don't know where you're going darkness has a the opposite attributes of light it doesn't matter which way mankind tries to play it what we've what we're asking for is turning the lights on now if you look at these pictures here i've got a whole bunch of people in light the people are still there in the other picture i just put a bit of an opaque dark color over them but they're all still there but they're all now in darkness and that's what the if you look closely you can probably see a few other people there they're all still there i want to read you some scriptures about what happens to mankind when we when we turn off the lights now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance wrath strife suggestions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like now the world can just wait and see what happens when you turn the light out this is what happens i'm not making this up just let it let it play out and you'll see and with hatred wrath and strife and murders you're going to get conflict you're not going to have peace that's why we're going to have as civilized as man thinks they are we're going to get more and more conflict sam says draw me not away or you can go to the next one yep sam says draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but mischief is in their hearts they're saying we want peace but really they they're after some sort of conflict they're out to do their neighbor wrong in some way and that's what's in the heart that's what is in the heart of darkness so people are saying one thing but they their objective is to do another thing that's where we're at at the moment i've got some scriptures more scriptures about about this concept that when we have darkness we have war we have we're not going to have peace let them that are my enemies wrongfully let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land a peacemaker doesn't sit down and desire ways that he could have a conflict and have war he desires ways that he can have more peace but but when people start to dwell in darkness they sit back and desire ways that they could actually cause a conflict when there isn't a conflict there now that doesn't mean they go up and pick up arms and go and shoot people but you see in this society people will just stir up a conflict between people for no particular you think why would you do that you're just steering up a conflict why not have peace but that's an attribute of darkness now these people might stand up and say i want peace i don't want war and they're talking about natural war and yet they'll go at war with their neighbor in an instant i've got this next one here but he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor but a man of understanding holdeth his peace and where the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom so as we start as man starts to go away from god then he is just going to despise his neighbor and cause conflict just because that's all that he knows how to do because when you dwell in darkness that's that's the that's what we get now i got this this quote here and it's it's it's relevant in a sense i'll just read it it's a it's a quote from ronald reagan and he said we maintain the peace through our strength weakness only invites aggression so that was what ronald reagan's big idea was peace through strength right and but but his his idea being that this only works when the person that wants to be the strongest desires peace right yeah because he desires peace he's saying well the way we get peace is if we be strong and we build up a good economy and a big army and we are a powerful nation that desires peace so that if someone else in the world is going wants to have a war we can step in and say say no don't have a war you know and they will listen to us because we are powerful that's what he meant by that peace through strength is like you know oh this next one this essentially it's this one here you know to put it in simple terms what he's meaning is we want to be the biggest guys in playground and then so we can keep all the other guys under control now this concept works if you it works both ways like if if if he desires to if he is a genuine peacemaker then this is a great scenario you know you have this and i think i think that the the the american culture was godly and did desire peace so there was although there were all sorts of mess-ups here and there i think in general there was this desire that okay if we're strong we will we will we want peace that was the general the world has enjoyed a good season of peace because there has been a big strong person in the playground that wants peace right because you get you get this one here when the righteous are an authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn the same could go the opposite you know you could have oppression through strength you know because if the strongest person in the room is an oppressor then you're going to have the opposite effect you're not going to get peace you're going to get war and oppression once he's taken over you he's going to oppress you and so that that concept has worked well peace through strength but unfortunately the evil is rising up now that they're becoming the stronger force in the world in countries countries that don't desire peace oppressive countries are becoming more and more powerful and they are starting to tip the balance of power and as a result you're going to start to see global unrest because there's there are there's evil rising up not saying that that america is good it's not because that that would be the wrong way to put it you know because i'm not caught up in that there are people that have caught up in that fight now they think it's a spiritual fight it's the spiritual fight was actually was when the word of god came that was that's spiritual that's the only spiritual fight this other stuff that people are trying to catch people into at the moment is nonsense and don't get involved in it it's not true but if i could go to the next one i hope this is making sense i've just i'm going to talk about peace at the end of this because i just want to lay this foundation first and just take you through this now we we as humans we try and learn from our mistakes we think we can look back at history and think well we shot each other there so we won't um have any more conflict you know let's not fight anymore you know which is good that's we we try and learn although our mankind as they're becoming in more of a darker place they are they will go back to more and more natural conflict anyway even though we try and think we learn but i want to point out that that the the conflict that i'm talking about which is what i spoke about at the start the conflict that we're involved in is not it's not always guns shooting people that's in bombs and that that's the war is more than that goes the next one if you look around you if you look around you there is war going on all around us powerful wars that are happening and these are actual wars that are just this fight all around us and if you're not in a country where there's people running around with guns you're in a country where there's another conflict happening in and one of them one of the major conflicts now is there's there's an information war it's a it's a massive conflict it's a global conflict that's happening at the moment napoleon said if i were to give liberty to the press my power could not last three days meaning i need to keep control of the information because they they keep people for me and they keep putting out my side of the story and if i keep them doing that then the people are going to like me everything's going to work and i'm going to have support but if i take that away then they'll rise up against me because he'll start to hear these other opinions that i don't want him to hear he he learned that if he controlled the information that he would do well that's why he said another one of his quotes were you know napoleon he was the french general he said four hostile newspapers are more to be fed than a thousand bayonets so it was he he knew it was paramount for him to to get to won this information war right but but as a result what you've got now in the world as you've got it used to be news outlets used to be just unbiased information that you could go for a source of information and they would tell you something about an event but but it's not like that anymore it's become a hostile place 10 years ago people were maybe saying oh i'm sure these these people these newspapers are biased and that's biased this way and that's maybe they're attacking that and they would be laughed to score and say no that's not the case you're just thinking this stuff up but it's become apparent now it's it's like common knowledge now that there's a war going on it's not it's not a conspiracy anymore it's not just like a cover-up it's not unknown yeah that this there is a there is an information war going on and and the battle lines have been drawn and people know who is on which side and they are actively engaging in conflict with each other it's active it's not so these and most of them are media companies that they are not out to tell you the news they are out to compete against this other idea and most of it is now opinion it's not news yeah and and it's all coming to fruition and and that's why that's why there are there are now social media platforms that have started up and they're like the fastest growing ones ever because they are they are say say if there's a bulk of the social media is for this side then if one starts up for this side all of the people that are for that side say well great there's now a platform that it's on our side so they jump and go on that one and they leave that one and it's massive these ones are there was one app that was i think it was truth social something it was like the fastest growing app ever because when it opened everyone wanted to be on it because it would it's a war they're like right here's our here's our next battleground in there we'll jump on that this is a massive conflict that's happening in the world and i wouldn't recommend getting involved too much in newspapers these days because it's actually uh it is it's a you get caught up in the middle of an of a war there's actual there's a there's a war happening because now these are people that say we want peace we want peace and yet during the day they're sprouting out conflict and war you see it because it's deception and and this is a powerful well this this is causing families to divide and this is causing people to divide this this what's happening here is causing so much division because it's drawing battlegrounds of well you're this idea you must be that you're that idea you must be that it's been the next one we i put this one here because it's even got this country all caught up in it you know like what this what what's happening in our country it's it's these people are the epicenter of what they would call an information war and and there was you know we're not immune to it being down here we we all have every country is involved in this and it's a it's becoming a you can't see an end to this i remember barry sofa he was uh he's a political commentator for like 30 years he was talking about this situation here and he said he said i've been talking i've been doing political commentary and this for 30 years i've never ever seen in my entire life anything like what i saw what happened down here now he's a he's actually an older guy so he's he's a bit more unbiased and he just says it as it is and he doesn't mind too much about which way it is but he's he's very mainstream middle of the road stuff but but he was saying usually whenever there's a big crowd the politicians are running to get down there because they want to be in front of the cameras yeah that's always what happens but he said i've never seen anything like this where there was a massive crowd and they made a pact that no one will go down there because they've drawn the battle lines we're on this team that's the other team it's an information war you know and if you if you went down and visited it would be like you would be seen as oh you're on that team are you you know you've changed sides you know it's it was an information war and he was surprised he didn't know what he was he said why is this happening i've never seen this before but he doesn't realize it's a because of this concept of war that satan is making making people so divisive getting caught up and all this sort of stuff and next one i'll just go through this fast the next one is an economic war you know there's been an economic war going on and i'm going to put this one here i'll just give you one example of this economic war there was china a while ago they they would have real i think they realized that they couldn't they've always been in conflict with america but they thought we can't beat them militarily they're too strong now that what we can do is attack them economically so what they did um in the in the mid in the early 90s they this is an act of war that they engaged in with with america to try and bring it down it wasn't uh haphazard thing it was an actual act of war they pegged their their dollar to the american dollar so they said one american dollar is going to be worth eight u.n so it doesn't matter if the american dollar goes up or down our one is going to stay with the american dollar and the eight u.n so it's always going to be eight times cheaper than the american dollar it was an act of war because they said if we do that that means we can start making things because what we've got is a whole lot of people here that can make stuff we can start making stuff and we can make it eight times cheaper than the americans because of the currency difference and we can then start selling that stuff back to them and we will slowly close their factories we will slowly start to get all the work and we will become a powerful economic force and they will become weaker that was the plan it was an act of war and that they engaged in from the early 90s they said we're going to peg this to the dollar and now as a result you know you all know what started happening next one this is this is you can see the at the same time the the graph on the bottom right is the american manufacturing jobs look the way that it goes it the the the chinese succeeded in this economic war that they were engaged in with the american look at the the manufacturing jobs all started going down and as in every war there were beneficiaries of this conflict you know some people found themselves in the middle of this conflict that they benefited from it just because they just happened to be at the right place at the right time companies like walmart what walmart set up was they their whole scheme was we're going to bring in chinese stuff and sell it you know and we can sell up stuff cheaper than what the americans can make it and we can just so so they were they were essentially caught up in this war but they they benefited from the war i'm not saying they were there was a plan to do that they just have to be at the right place the right time the same with the warehouse you know right they were just the right place at the right time and they they benefited from this war that china engaged in that's just this is the way as a result walmart and now the they got they got right in the middle of this war and they became between two superpowers and they they seem to they profited off the war so much so that they are now at the moment the biggest company in the world by turnover there's no other company in the world that are bigger than walmart because they basically take china and sell it to america but they just happened to be at the right place the right time started up and they they were the ones that worked the scheme but they only got there because china is at war there's an economic war going on you know and so we we may just be living our lives and kicking along you know but not realizing there's a massive conflict there's an economic war happening there's there's conflict happening and it's here's the next one and at the same time you had we had you have cultural wars you know that that that these ideas come into people's minds that are and essentially the cultural wars were in the 60s it was so there were no guns being shot in these wars or apart from if they were trying to calm down riots but there was a war between ideas of of next one the the war essentially people boiled it down and it was the war against the three ps which was the parents the pastors and the police because they represented society like parents represented the family unit and mum dad the children they the guidance from the parents and helping you know the family unit so they fought against that fought against the authority of the parents fought against that unit pastors represented the church represented god represented the the rule of the higher being being that that we follow his rules you know they fought against that and the police represented civil society where that was the law and you you you obey the law and you helped be a good citizen you know so you've got these three pillars in society that that keeps society peaceful because when when god runs the show he says the parents are to be like this and the family unit is like this and you you know that the honor your parents and you the family unit stays together you you know the and then you serve god you honor his ways and then you honor society you obey the laws of the land so he's got this way but the culture was essentially all they were were a rebellion against against those things and people call it a culture war but it was just a it was just people fighting people getting it wanting a different idea and fighting against all these things and and i know not yet as a result you had massive just go back you had back one sorry you had massive upheaval in society and i'm going to say that it hasn't produced anything very good the because what that was was darkness coming in darkness came upon mankind and they decided to start living out that darkness now it gets to a point now where you have like you have a disaster somewhere like an earthquake or something what's the first thing that happens is people go on loot and then you try and if people need shelter then they might they might put a designated football stadium to house people but then within that there becomes rape and all these things happen in there it's like why because in society you've got darkness so that things don't function like what they should you know like if it was a godly society when there's a disaster yeah people aren't going to be running out looting they're going to be running out helping people is everyone okay here okay fixing up things and when they're all if they'll get put in a stadium they're all going to be helping but but as a result of darkness coming in it's not the same the next one the next thing that we face now the only spiritual war that i know of is is actually the satan coming against the revealed word of god that's that's the true spiritual war not not don't get caught up in anything else these days there's proclaiming a spiritual war between essentially the romans and the jews you know like that that conflict that was titus taken over jerusalem you know that's the war that people that's the type there but we're not of that war that's not a spiritual war that's just that's a both everyone is deceived but there there has been a spiritual war waged against the word of god and it's a it's a the war is raging and it's the i i just printed this one off i don't know if you can see that but this is the world council of churches and this is their celebration of baptism i'm just going to give you one example of this because it's always the easiest one to show that we're in a spiritual war this is their rules baptism is administered with water in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit so next one you know you're at war you know europe there's a you know there's a war happening when when if paul went to join the the this group that he wouldn't be allowed on their team because he doesn't agree with what they say so just by virtue of that because paul said acts 19 then said paul john really baptized with baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe in him which had come after them that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus so so there's a war between these two groups because if paul went in to preach in their churches his his uh his um doctrine on baptism he wouldn't be allowed to preach there so you know we have a war in our hands there's a there's a war between this one group and another group that that and it's a you've got conflict you've got war and that this this war has been and this war has been raging from right from the start the the the seed of the serpent that's it's been a war raging all the way through but when jesus was here they said the same thing here is jesus when he was when he was being on his trial that they these people on this other side they just tried to get liars and stuff to come and speak it speak a lie to try and convict him they knew they were lies lying but they they wanted to try and make it all work and convict him that shows that there was actually these were supposed to be godly people but in their heart they knew they were getting liars in to come and speak lies and they were hoping that the lies would all just gel together and that the the um romans would put jesus to death but then it says for many war false witnesses against them but their witnesses agreed not together you know so they because they they you know when liars speak they forget the lies they've told one liar speaks another life speaks because they're all lies nothing works so they couldn't actually get in that way even though they desired to and if they could they would they would have that just shows the there was a battle between that and even even there was a battle once he when they found out that he was gone that jesus the tomb was empty they they couldn't let out that possibly he has risen so they they gave a lot of money to the soldiers and they said okay here's the here's what you say if anyone asks you you go and tell them that they were that the disciples came in at night and stole them away you know you guys were sleeping and they came in and stole them and and then if that gets if word gets back to your superiors and you guys get in trouble for that then we will go and um you know we'll persuade him and we'll probably bribe him as well and say no that is that is what happened yet we we know these disciples they're real cunning you know they probably sedated them when they were sleeping and they went in and got him or you know they were all involved in this big lie it was just a it was a battle going on and it was a battle full of lies and you see the same thing today against the message it's a battle full of lies that people like breaches lies and it doesn't take long before you uncover the lies and you think okay well i know what where you're off and this is what's been happening for a long time there's been lies you know spoken for a long time here's one here this next one i i i found this well it's not amusing but it's it's i'll just read it brother branham says a certain baptist church that my little family went to the other day and they had been down at the meeting in tucson the pastor got up knowing that not knowing that the boy that goes with my daughter as a member there and he said you know i just learned brother adam's father and mother travel in a circus and that they were magicians and that's a little trick that he does so i guess it was a trick that he heals the sick i doubt whether my father and mother ever seen a circus they never seen an automobile until i had one see they never know nothing about it but you see the devil has always got to say they told jesus they do this by beelzebub so there were lies going around that his his brother and his parents were magicians in a circus and he learned all these healing tricks in the circus from his parents [Laughter] that was a lie going around and this this baptist minister had heard that and he started repeating that just like the lie that went around that oh no jesus didn't raise from the dead the disciples just came and stole him away at night that's how he rose that was the lie going around and if you were you'd hear that lying and if you were if you were of that on that side you would just wholeheartedly believe that lie and spout it out again because you it suits with you didn't like jesus anyway so that suited your idea so you think well science they told me must be right and that's what was happening here there were just lies going around and people repeating lies saying his parents were in the circus and he brother pam says they'd never even been to the circus oh do you want a call never even know this is um this is another one this is when brother brown went to tucson and they said are you here to start a church he said no i'm here to help you guys you know just a minister in that but he never got one phone call and and he said it's because they had to get together right after that after they talked to him and they said if any man had me in the pulpit they would excommunicate that preacher why because there was a war going on yep you know and and it would have been the same with jesus you know that when he was here you know if you if you have him in your synagogue you're out of the synagogue it would have been the same with paul there was a there's a war going on and i've just got a few more now we come to we see all these other conflicts but they now we we also have we can't negate the fact that we also have physical wars you know which is the ones that's going on and at the moment and what i find amusing about this you know is that how quickly life can change you know this is these are some before and after photos that before that when you had this these places would have just been people in these cities and kiev and they would have had plans and ideas and businesses and schemes and maybe some people just bought a home and they've worked so hard for it and the they've just started a family and all these different things you know life was going on even up to january of this year life was that that was all that was involved in life it was just all good things were going to go well and then a month later how so much can change in a month or six weeks later it's completely different and and unfortunately what we see here is is just darkness coming in more and more and i've just got i just got a few of these photos it's just it just this is so pointless any any war i think is pointless when you just all you get is destruction and ruin and death it's an absolute pointless venture i can't wait to be in a place where there is no war amen it's absolute it's just this is not we are not civilized people that when we do this this is not no war is this is nonsense and and i think the people of god never desire wars and never want to start wars but this is just these are people's businesses and people's livelihoods just everything just changes but that goes to show that we can't trust in that our trust and our confidence has to be in the lord because it could happen here in a moment there could be a nuclear war tomorrow and life as we know it will change we could be putting all this effort into certain things right you know even in the economy and certain things and tomorrow there could be a nuclear war and things will change amen you know or a massive war breaks out and things just change you're not the same as what they used to be go to the next one um and i think it's the saddest thing to watch um i think one of the saddest things that i've seen played in this conflict is if you know the story of titanic they as with a not just this ocean line about a lot of ocean liners that actually all of them they didn't have enough lifeboats for the people on board it's especially if they had over ten thousand if they were more than ten thousand tons they didn't really have rules to regulate ships of that size so most almost all of the vessels over ten thousand tons they didn't have enough lifeboats i think the titanic had i think it was 40 or 50 i could be wrong but somewhere around that vicinity which was about average i think the best ship had like 70 um of the people could get out of the boat onto a lifeboat that's at full capacity but what happened on this one was there were people once they got the lifeboats into the water and the some of them could could take 70 people but they only they set off with 30 people and they were all the first class passengers first but once they got out into the water they people would you can imagine in the water there were hundreds and hundreds of people and the people in the boats decided some people wanted to go back that but the majority rule said we're not going to go back if we try and pick them up we're going to sink our own boat so we're going to leave them to die and just save ourselves because otherwise we will all die that concept you know and some people in the boat that wanted to save people they he one man he said well you bear me record everybody here if we survived this i wanted to go back and save people and you guys all said no so just so it's on a record that's what i wanted to do but you guys wouldn't let me but this is what's that's the saddest thing because that's what's happening in the ukraine is that is that people are essentially the rest of the countries are saying well we would love to come and help you when we sympathize with your plight that you're all dying but if if we come and try and save you we risk ourselves and sinking our own boat you know so we're just going to sit back and watch you oh yeah watch you die that's what's happening you know that cause and the ukraine are there saying oh buddy old pal come and help me and they're saying we won't do it we're not going to do it you know and morally i don't think it's right you know hey call there bluff go and okay bomb us if you want you know what is life yeah we'll go in and we'll help and if you newcast you nuke us maybe sometimes men and women need to stand up and just do the right thing regardless of whether hey you know wouldn't you feel better if you did try and go back and save people and you'll sunk unless you think well i tried to help i died myself but i tried to help you know i know it's a moral dilemma but that's the saddest thing about this conflict is that's what's happening it doesn't matter how many pictures you see of women and children little children lost and killed they won't go in because they say if we go on we risk ourselves and it won't happen and russia knows it too so it's a that's the worst part of this conflict is seeing that happen in slow motion essentially and no one will step in until and the country will get taken over may or may not i don't know but their friends won't step in and help you wonder if they'll be good friends afterwards um but i want to i want to just speak now that we've talked about a whole lot of conflict i want to speak about the term of peace now because we serve a god of peace and this is what what i want to major on for another five minute five or ten minutes then we're done this idea of peace i'm so glad that we can have peace now the first the first person we have to make peace with is god because when we're born we're actually we talk about being at war when we're born we're at we're actually at war with god when we're born and it says romans 8 7 says because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither can be so we're born basically at war with god and that's not a good place to be but we are in a constant conflict because of that because of our fallen nature we're in a constant conflict with god and that's that's where we are when we begin our life and that's how we start to live our life is in a conflict against god and a war with god so the first thing we have to do is make peace with god we have to there has to be some way we can make peace because we don't want to be at war with god we don't want to be found fighting against god because in the end we're going to lose if we if we have this conflict you know as paul says again but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind my mind wants to serve god but my fallen nature is warring against that idea bringing me into captivity to the law of sun which is in my members we're at this constant war with god and the only it's because of our sinful nature and the only way that that that could be that could be done as if god came down himself paid the price of our sins and actually came in and dwelt in us and had this new life that actually is at peace with god and that was god's whole plan of coming down and saving us was so that he could create peace because if god says to us blessed are the peacemakers he has to be the biggest peacemaker that there is you know because he always he doesn't just say us to do one thing he doesn't do it he always does he does it first and he expects us to do the same thing it's like greater love has no man that they lay their life down for their friend well he laid his life down for us and he's saying well can't you even commit your life to me and lay it down for me you know i laid it down for you now can't you do it for me he doesn't just ask us to do something he wouldn't do himself so he was a great peacemaker and i like one of my favorite scriptures and one of my favorite ideas next is in concepts of humanity and and the power of god was this one when the angels came down after jesus was born and they said glory to god in the highest and on earth peace and good will toward men because when christ was born he was he was he was this ambassador of peace there was this great war between god and man and here came the son of god down born in a manger and he was a he he came down with a you could say with with terms of peace he says i want to make peace with you i'm here to make peace glory to god in the highest and on earth peace and good will toward men and we can we can accept that that peace from god and accept that he paid the price for us and be forgiven of our sins and have that new life come into us and that new life that dwells within us is at total peace with god we're not we can we're no longer at war with god we're now at peace and we can live a life we can accept as terms of peace and actually as terms of peace our surrender i demand that you surrender we say lord i surrender and then and then he rules over us and then we have peace you know he becomes the prince of peace comes in and he rules in our life and he gives us peace and amongst all of this conflict that we see in the world we can have total peace we can have total peace amongst all this conflict because we've got the prince of peace that dwells in us and i want to say this that the that with the blessing of god always brings peace the blessing of god always brings peace i love this scripture the lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you the lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace the blessing of god always brings peace in our life the the more of god we get in our life the more peace that we have in our life and and the next one this this picture here is king solomon's temple now i just want to touch on this real quick and i want to show you something else the this here was david david had war all his life but because god was blessing david david in every fight that he had he won every battle because even though he had to fight he kept on winning and getting stronger and stronger and stronger till he slowly defeated all his enemies and he overtook this patch of ground at jerusalem and then by the time his son solomon went to rule solomon also decided to serve god too so god continued to bless solomon but by the time solomon came along david had built up such a powerful army you talk of this concept peace through strength that people were scared to come and fight against them because they'd beaten them so many times they were they they were pushed back and pushed back and as a result you had peace in the land and that's when solomon came along he there was peace in the land because david had built up such a mighty army and that and then david could go on he built the temple and solomon built the temple and built an even more bigger army and i often think you know when david was just a ragtag guy you know it's like us when we first start serving the lord satan thinks we just easy game i will just go and deal to that little guy you know like when when david was up in the hills with him and his that all the men that drew with them were all the men that were indebted and that had nowhere else to go and they were they were they were the men that no one else wanted there with this ragtape bunch running around and and saw all and all these different enemies thought they could easily just overtake them you know so they said oh let's just go and attack that little david up there in the hills with his men you know there's a hundred or so of them 200 let's just go and attack them you know in the minute ziggler did too we'll just attack their women and children you know but because god was with david he kept on blessing david and david kept on winning and the more that he won the more he got peace so much so that as he got you know when he was just a smaller little battalion of guys if one of his enemies spoke to another one of his enemies and said hey how about we go and fight against david they would have said yeah let's go and get him he's easy he's an easy target he's easy game you know we're just going to attack him but as he got more and more powerful those same people maybe would have come to each other and said i'm thinking about attacking david and one of them would have said oh i'm not so sure about that you know uh we've tried that four times now and now it's bigger and stronger uh i think we won't do it you imagine when solomon came along and solomon amassed a mighty army even the thought of going and attacking solomon people like there is no way we're going to attack solomon no don't touch his borders don't don't mess with any of his people leave him alone so he gets wondered that we're after him we'll be done you know he's he's because he monopolized all the countries around them he made them supply more this wood and all these things and all they all like solomon and everything but god gave them peace through strength because because they committed their lives to god and they started god established their life the more that they were established the more peace they had in their life and and that's why brother brown says you know you can get so full of god that the devil doesn't know what to do with you you know because the blessing of god just makes you you standing you're standing upon his word in every area of your life and you're you're fortified and there's there's peace in your life in every area that's that's what the blessing of the lord does for your life it gives you peace and we win every battle that we engage in as a believer if there's a promise of god we we win i've and the we get peace in every area like if we've got a sickness in our body that's actually a war i remember one time when i was you know when you you get sick and you you're sleeping at night and you've got maybe a temperature and you're trying to go to sleep and you're thinking the most stupidest things you ever could think of has anyone ever done that you're just thinking okay i'm and you can't sleep because you're thinking i'm walking across this branch and then if i fall down the branch i'll hit the suitcase and then the lid will go this way you're thinking man they're branched they're not then the suitcase is down the bottom oh but what type of suitcase is it yeah i'll fall on the suitcase and then you wake up and you think what on earth am i talking about i can't sleep i'm losing sleep thinking about the suitcase this is just this is silly this is insane and then you you start to go back to sleep again and you start to think the same thing you think wow that suitcase well you're on i better not fall into that suitcase it'll the lip will flip up and you can do that all night just when you come to yourself you think this is random what am i thinking but it's because it's because there's a war going on in your body you've got a conflict going on this this there's some sort of germ or something coming and and then your your good cells your white blood cells everything it's it's fighting there's a there's a fight going on in your body that's why you're you know you're you're a you've got a temperature and you're an upheaval because there's a battle going on but god wants to give us peace in our body he wants to give us if we've got some ailment god actually wants to give us peace he doesn't want that he doesn't want this thing warring against us in and to make us sick god's desire for us is that we would have peace in our body that we would be well so and that's his promise now there's little things about that but you know if you want to you can claim that for yourself if there's something in your body you can proclaim peace and that was actually my word for the church this morning is is actually peace amongst all this conflict peace if you've got any if you've got any album in your body or anything like that and you you can you can claim the promise of god you can claim peace in your body next one you can have peace in your family you know like in a family situation sometimes you can start to have conflict and jesus says we're not immune to that he said he said don't think that i've come to bring peace but a sword and that sounds like an oxymoron like he's contradicting himself but he said i haven't come to bring peace with the sword but a sword i've come to bring you know between um um mother and daughter and father and son and all these things because because and sometimes he's doing that to test us because when you get two different ideas dwelling together if they are different you're going to have conflict that's why saying i've got i'm going to bring a sword if suddenly the the daughter decides she wants to serve the lord and if the mother is not into it you're suddenly were you son where you had peace you now have conflict you have a sword and you have what they call it you have a sword in the home you've got a conflict there because there's now a battle and jesus says don't be surprised we're often tempted to compromise and just given the battle because we want to have peace in the family so i'll just a lot of people have given up christianity they've given up a certain stance because they want to have peace they'll compromise for the sake of having peace but that's not peace they've just had to surrender to the enemy and actually they won't get peace that they won't get the peace of god that way but you know god has promised us regardless of what our situation might be go back so that's not that one god go before that god has promised us peace you know in our family we can have peace if there is conflict his power can come in and create peace in our family if there's someone walking the other way god can change turn that around and give you peace and that's what his desire for us is peace if you need that peace you can claim that peace now just like david's battle sometimes david didn't go to fight anyone straight away but he he always believed god is my victory in every situation god is my victory and sometimes things that happen overnight but we can keep pressing on and proclaim peace god is going to give me peace in the situation he's going to overcome and he's going to give me peace and we don't have to compromise with the enemy and say well i'll just give in and you know we don't have to compromise we can demand that we overcome and then there's peace in our land next one and the same goes you know we often i we can sometimes go through financial conflict you know the the the woman in the bible she was that that owed the debt she was in a in a financial conflict and there were people coming to i think they were coming to get take her son and sell him and you know she she had lost everything and she was in a there was people were at war with her and to overcome her but but god stepped in and said no i'm going to give you peace and he said yeah just start filling get all the oil that you can find and stuff just pour oil into these however many barrels you can find and go and sell that and pay all your creditors and pay everything i'm going to overcome this and give you peace thank you and god gave her peace brother brother peregrine said that brother branham told him there's no pressure like financial pressure and sometimes god gets us into financial pressure just to to take us through things but ultimately he wants to give us peace he doesn't want creditors on us and give us a conflict in the area he wants to give us peace so that we can live peaceably in that so if you if you've got that in your life anything at all you give you he'll give you he's a god of peace you can have peace in your mind philippians 4 7 says in the peace oh in this one and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus isaiah 26 3 says they will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee we live in a world where there's no peace people are people don't dwell peacefully but their minds are all caught up and worried but but god is the blessing of god gives us complete peace the peace of god which passes all understanding keeps our hearts and minds he will keep us in perfect peace if our mind has stayed on him and if we trust in him we'll be it regardless of how much this conflict happens around us and all this even in our country there's conflict there's division we don't care we're at total peace that's the god that we serve and the word that i want to speak to you speak over the church and give to the church if you remember one thing from today is shalom shalom i think that's a nice greeting we should start saying it to each other shalom because shalom means peace amen shalom it means peace and it means more than peace it means the peace the goodness the wholesomeness everything that god has be upon you the blessing and that because with with shalom comes with the peace of god with it's it's like may god's favor be upon you may his may everything that god has come upon you and give you peace give you make you know bless you and overcome you so that you become in this place of peace and if we can accept it and we just we just believe it god will give us shalom in every area of our life and i've got some a few scriptures i want to read about that this is gideon after god had told him you know he had all the enemies coming after him and always he was having to hide away and hide all the stuff from the enemy because he was oppressed and the angel came to him and said gideon now mighty man of valor and he told him he was going to deliver him and he built an altar that day and he called it jehovah shalom god of peace because he knew god promised he's going to give me peace god has got to give me peace from all these enemies that are coming at me every day there's going to be a season there's going to be a time that i can sit back and i can be at peace and i won't have all these enemies coming and i won't have to hide in here anymore and hide away all my my harvest from them and for fear they're going to steal i'm going to be in a place of peace and god has proclaimed peace to each one of us every one of us and that's it we need to start saying that to each other when we greet because the jews say that they say shalom instead of it's not hello and they speak peace i think that's a nice way to greet each other and when they say goodbye they say shalom shalom i've taken a few scriptures because the when we write peace in the bible it's actually in the in the english that's actually the word shalom you know it's this word it's not so i've got two scriptures to finish with shalom i leave with you my shalom i give unto you not as the will giveth i give unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid so god says shalom i leave with you my shalom my peace i give unto you not as the will give not as well giveth give unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid he always said shalom when he was when he walked on the water and the disciples were scared he always said shalom or when an angel came to visit someone he said fear not shalom even that word fear not means it's a lot of the times that's that's translated from shalom shalom be at peace don't worry just be at peace here's my last scripture for today then we'll close now the lord of shalom himself gave you shalom always by all means the lord be with you all the god of shalom the god of peace himself he's he owns it it's it's part of his domain he owns this thing and it says may he give it to you always may he give you his shalom his peace by all means by any means that he can may he get it to you if there's an area in your life where you don't have peace i want to encourage you you can stand upon the word of god and he will give you peace don't don't give up don't don't doubt the promises of god sometimes battles are overnight sometimes they last a long time but don't doubt the promises of god he'll give you peace because he is the god of peace and if we commit our lives over to him in every area of our life he'll give us peace i can guarantee you i can assure you of that because he is the god of peace now the lord of shalom himself give you shalom always by all means the lord be with you amen thank you praise the lord that was my message that i had today so um i'm going to hand it back over to you brother um ed god bless you all shalom brother isaac thank you so much um i'm i was very blessed with that i'm still i am still um that was that was that was my brain and um with with me
