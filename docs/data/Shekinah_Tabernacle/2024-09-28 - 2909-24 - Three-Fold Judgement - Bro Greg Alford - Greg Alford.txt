these people here because of you who's who's been changed met the Lord because of here that's because of brother Greek sister Nancy years ago they gave their lives to the Lord their life is rippled out and had great impact so I want to I want to honor you both today say thank you very much [Applause] not just here but Around The World God has used them to bring his strin and lost sheep home so I believe he that will continue on this morning so whatever the Lord's put on brother Greg's heart say Lord speak to my life change my life Lord you know brother Gregory sharing testimonies of just being on the mission field of being overseas seon preaching something and decades later people come back to them say what you said has gripped me has changed my life I believe he'll do the same today our God is the same yesterday today and forever amen so let's sing that chorus as as brother Greg comes to the pulpit amen Lord change my life today word of God ever true amen let's stand shall we amen this morning as brother Greg Crums amen word of God [Music] changing and [Music] changing heart let the word of [Music] God never true changing me changing you here I [Music] the word of [Music] God wow what all you do huh I didn't think I was old till I heard him speak about myself so we're glad to be here with you today you may be seated for just a few minutes I I kind of want to get the butterflies all flying in the right direction um like you said we moved to New Zealand in 1972 I see a few people that might be in my age bracket and uh you remember Norm Kirk was the prime minister of New Zealand when we arrived and uh so a lot of years ago and I came across this message within within a year of coming here and yet there was a message church just 30 miles south of where we lived in Oregon and uh I remember coming into the things of the message and I hearing brother brandom say it'll be these young men that'll take the message into the Rapture and I was it that's right I was 25 years of age and uh so yeah we sort of felt this is it yeah we're going we're going in the Rapture you know and then 1977 came around and because we read the church age book and we got kind of confused at that and we wondered well okay let's go to the South Island so we went to the South Island and we we've been on the mainland ever since you know what I'm talking about these young ones don't what I'm talking about do [Laughter] they when we had our first convention down there in 1978 77 uh we had North Islanders come down and you know there was this big debate on who is the mainland and uh so that's kind of drifted away over the years but we're glad to be in service with you here today we trust that we can say something that would help you along the way um we bring you greetings from our sh assembly there in Kaio and we've got uh some men that are going to be going into the prison this afternoon to minister in the prison as well so God's opened the door there for us and and uh yeah we're just glad to be able to be share the word of God with you today trusting somehow that it will might well what I'm going to do today is I trust that it will you'll be able to identify yourself you know because so often when the preacher preaches he he says things and it goes right over the top and and I want to be able to say something here today that would say you know okay I know where I'm at I know exactly what God's dealing with me I know exactly why I'm in the position because I've been uh back in the prisons again ministering not back in there and staying but back in the prisons ministering for the last four years again 20 years ago I got kicked out of the prisons because of the message and then all of a sudden supernaturally God led us back into the prison and gave us an audience there and if is there any of you have ever dealt with the prison system here in New Zealand no okay so what's happening is they don't want you to talk about hell they don't want you to talk about uh Salvation they they just want you to talk about feel-good things and so what has happened then is that uh I if if I was underneath the chaplain see I couldn't do that but I'm under a volunteer so I go win as a volunteer rather than than as a as a minister for the chaplaincy and so they don't care what I say so we we've just really enjoyed some good times and uh we have a lot of young men in New Zealand 60% of the men who are in prison end up reoffending so the first thing I asked them is uh so how do you learn cuz we had two sons and the oldest boy was a real go-getter and the young one kind of tailed in behind him maybe you have children like that as well and so if they got in trouble the youngest boy would say he did it Dad it was him not me and so I said you know some people learn by their own mistakes right and some people learn by watching other people do things and then saying no that doesn't work I'm not going to do that and then other people just don't learn at all so I say to the prisoners what are you where are you because you know I'm going to teach you because I deal with a thing called anger resolution not anger management anger resolution because you can all have anger that's a natural phenomena within the human race but what do I do to resolve the problems that anger has created not manage them resolve the issues and I said I'm going to give you the tools to resolve them but you have got to have Christ in your life or you will never totally conquer that anger problem it will always be there and you'll always be in trouble so I'm not going to deal with that today so let's stand as we get go to God's word and I'm going to take a little thing then and you can plug me in now uh to for my slideshow because I started doing op so I had the privilege and some of you may have uh watched his ministry um Jimmy amigo uh some of you may have watched brother Lonnie Jenkins Ministry and I had the privilege of uh of sitting under Lonnie's ministry as far as having him come to my church at times and then I went and stayed with him at his house and and had fellowship with him and and I kind of caught on to some of the things that he he does as far as delivery and I found that when you have a picture a picture says a thousand words right and so what we're looking at today is I'm going to give you illustrations to be able to identify where you're at you'll be able to pinpoint exactly what where God is dealing with you so let's go to the Book of Psalms first and we're going to deal with the three-fold Judgment of God now there's more than that and I'm going to explain that to begin with but I want to first of all just start with with a three-fold judgment of God in Psalms 1 on 119 verse 30 so often other Christian talk about the love of God and the grace of God and all that's true but we forget that there is a judgment of God as well if you're not careful and we don't want to we don't want to be there at that Judgment Day and not have it said in the right way that you know depart from me you workers of iniquity we want well done th good and faithful servant we don't want to we don't want the other way around so Psalm 119:30 says I have chosen the way of Truth truth thy judgments have I laid before me so let's pray together heavenly father as we look into this thought we pray that your Holy Spirit would keep me focused amen Lord don't let me go up any rabbit burls and and just let me stay focused on what you want me to say so that you could be glorified within our midst today vindicate your word in our hearts and our lives we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated stay with him and 190 and 119 because we're just going to go right through the whole the whole Psalm let's jump over to one uh verse 52 remember thy judgment oh l oh of old oh Lord and have comforted me myself then go over to 62 at midnight I will rise and give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgment so David's he's going this whole Psalm is dedicated virtually for his for judgment go to 75 verse 75 I know oh Lord that thy judgments are right and thou art faithful and has Afflicted me 102 I have not departed from thy judgments for thou Hast taught me 156 great are thy Tender Mercies oh Lord Quicken me according to thy judgment and then the final one 160 Thy word is true from the beginning every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever yeah so God's we can say here God is a god of judgment right and yet he's still a god of Grace but let me just give you some statistics here so over 200 times salvation is spoken of in the Bible but judgment is spoken of over 400 times so you know we we know that God's got Grace we know that he's got Mercy but he also has got a judgment because you've got to have a contrast right that's right you cannot you cannot have a heaven without a hell because there would be no reason for you to want to be in heaven if it just all happened without some other form of bad that could happen to you and so as we as we look through this thought I thought that I would uh sort of go from from the judgments of God and it looks like my mouth is working so uh this is an interesting one so here in Acts 24:24 uh Paul is with Felix and he's been asked to explain the gospel and so he goes through and he says and after certain days when Felix came with his wife drilia which was a Jewish he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ so what a good thing you know he actually wanted to know what what is Christ all about what are you what are you what are you trying to tell us and so and as he reasoned of righteousness and Temperance and judgment Felix trembled so you know he got through you know it was registering yeah you know a lot of times when you talk to people they don't register right or else they're looking to counterd do what you're saying you know they're looking for the argument rather than for listening to what you're saying and so here Paul as he was preaching was such he was the Lord was there and magnifying his word so much that he trembled at the word he realized this is true yeah I need to do something and and yet the old man kicked in right the his he trembled at the he trembled and answered go thy way for this time when I have a convenient season I will call for thee isn't that interesting that that somebody could be so affected by the word of God that they trembled at at hearing it knowing what was going to happen to them and then say Oh come back another day but you know if you follow the scriptures through he never asked him to come back so where does Felix stand today then now I'm not his judge but you know after death comes judgment so there is a there is a judgment time and and when you know the word then you're responsible for what the word says to you let me give you an example just we have this woman who lives next door to our church she's a Pentecostal person and she's been involved in uh Pentecost AOG and and uh I think the other one was New Life Center down in the Christ Church area and she uh she's moved in next we have a block of flats longside our church and so she comes along to a Sunday night service that we have where we just hang sing hymns and and choruses and things like that and have testimony time and and just it's I tried to get the people to invite somebody you know uh because you know if you don't start doing that you become the chosen Frozen right because you you know you're just kind of locked into your little groupy and bless God it's us four and no more and I I'm not too sure about you either but so you know we we we're not careful we do those sorts of things and so she she came she comes along and at first for a long time she was wearing a trousers when she came which is a normal dress for a woman nowadays not when Norm Kirk's day was around right the Kiwi women dressed in dresses in those days but not no anyway she sitting there and as we're leading song and Caleb's leading song I guess and and uh God speaks to her heart and he said would it be all right for Caleb to wear a dress nobody's talking to her she's God's speaking to her heart she says no it wouldn't be and then the voice came back then why are you wearing trousers wow nobody nobody said anything we just all we were doing was singing choruses there was no preaching there was you know just singing A Chorus giving testimony to the Lord and she felt convicted so she changed so last month we just you know three it's the third Sunday of every month last month she come along and she I said you're were late she said I had to get my skirt [Laughter] on so she'll no other time but if you're going to come to church here we're going to put a skirt on we're going to put a dress on but you know the word had penetrated right and so that's what we want is the word to penetrate in our lives correct so let's let's just go through some of the judgments of God to begin with and just give you an overview so we have the guy here and we realize that uh if he accepts Christ then Christ becomes his judgment and that's a judgment for the past right because once you give your life to Christ that's it your sin has been dealt with right you don't pay for that sin again oh my Lord he he he he paid for it right he paid for it all but we'll we'll I don't want to carry there because we're going to I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do and then I'm going to tell you how I do it and then I'm going to give you an example of of where you're at okay so then we have next one the judgment is is for present as a son because now you're a son and daughter of God correct right you receive Christ as your savior you're a son and daughter of God you're not dealing with your sin now although you do make mistakes so he's not dealing he's not dealing with your sin though because your sin question was dealt with at Calvary thank you and then the future one is as a servant so what did you do for the Lord now that you became a Christian what did you do for the Lord and and so we want to be able to know what that is and then of course the last judgment is the great white Throne judgment and then we realize if we go a little bit further with that we as we look into it we realize that that there's there's more to that when we when we take the next step so let's let's just expand it out a little bit here and we see that uh if we don't receive Christ then there's a hell that aways right after death comes judgment and that becomes at the white Throne judgment when everybody will be brought up and there'll be a judgment given and the bride will sit there with Christ to judge the world right and so now anybody who's not found written in the Lamb's Book of Life or in the book of life will be judged and be put into the Lake of Fire correct so if we follow a little bit further we realize that there's a tribulation period we realize there's a millennium and then after the thousand years we realize then the Judgment comes but we have also the Judgment of the Nations at that time when we come to the seventh judgment we have the Judgment of Israel and we have the Judgment of the Angels who fell let me give you some script here so we understand where we're coming from so in 2 Peter 2:4 it says for for if God spared not the angels that sin but cast them down to Hell and delivered them into chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgment right so those ones that were in the days of Noah they will be judged eventually because they didn't receive the word of God and they'll be judged for what they knew so the Judgment of the Nations is there the Judgment of the Gentiles the Judgment of the Jew the Judgment of the Angels it's all comes at the end time now as we take this a little bit step further look at what brother Bram says here he says and if you've been accepted in Christ and Christ took my judgment and I accepted his propitiation for my sin how can God judge me yeah how can he he took my sin right so he's done judge me when he judged Christ then I'm free from judgment when I see the blood I'll pass over you now that don't mean I don't make mistakes right my old Nature has to die but as far as the sin question is concerned because you know it wasn't me that put my name on The Book of Life my name was put there before the foundation of the world right and all of a sudden I recognized it amen and when I saw it I go whoa really me so we we see that happen now let's let's take this and and start to break it down so basically as a as a human being and and in my case I was 25 years of age when I came to this country and I knew I was a sinner but I wasn't bad you know I was wasn't that bad you know I paid my taxes and you know I I was good to my wife that's my first wife and uh and so I I wasn't bad person but then I we ended up in a little bible study out in the place called a mockery in out near blackhead Beach uh here in the north island and um and I learned that I was lost I'd grown up in a church I played Church basketball for our church team we were we were we were state champs for five years in a row man when I was back in the 60s so yeah know we were we were good guys even got up in front of the whole church and the church applauded us for playing winning the championship for the church basketball team Whoopi but I didn't know Christ right and so I I as I began to read the Bible I I realized I was lost I realized I needed Christ so I can take you to the house I can take you to the spot where I knelt down and I gave my life to Christ I can take you it's here in New Zealand I can take you to that place cuz something happened that day now that didn't finish it and there's a lot needed to go on after that but that day I gave my life to Christ and my burden rolled off my sin burden was rolled off oh my so we realize that also that God loves me and he paid a price for me now let me back some of these things up with scripture so we get get an understanding of where we're coming from so the Bible tells us in Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and in fact Paul picked that up from Psalms 14 where it says for all they have gone astray all together become filthy there is none know that doeth good know not one so you know Paul grabbed the stuff from the Old Testament brought it into the New Testament and showed that it was absolutely true so as we go a little bit further the Bible also shows us that uh wherefore by one man's sin sin sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for all have sinned so the Bible clearly shows us that all have sinned there's none righteous and I'm sure you've probably been to funerals where they say well he's looking down upon us now and you know and and these sorts of things I went to a Catholic funeral once uh one of our older sisters at the time which probably none of you would remember uh anyway her grandson had passed away as a young age and it was they were catholic and so they took the smoke and they put the smoke around there around the coffin and and and and the priest was very good good he told me exactly what he was doing and why he was doing it so as you know these things so why they put the smoke around there is they released the spirit so the spirit can't release until they put the smoke around there it has nothing to do with the Bible right it's all dogma of what they feel is right and and so yeah it it was kind of interesting but got Bible tells us here that God loves us so if God loves us and Christ died for me then he took my Place yeah amen wow he took my place amen and because he took my place then then I I can come to this place where the Bible tells us Romans 5:8 for God commanded his love toward us and while we were yet sinners Christ died for us Ephesians 4 or Ephesians 2 ver4 but God who is rich in Mercy with his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead in sin Quicken together in Christ by grace are you saved so we see that there's plenty of scripture and we realize that Christ then took my place for my sin and when he took my place for my sin the Bible says Isaiah 53 all we like sheep are gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid upon him the iniquity of us all so Christ took my place amen and the Bible tells us in many the other places so the Bible tells us in 1 Peter 3:13 Christ also has suffered once for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to Death In the Flesh and quickened by the spirit so the Bible then tells us he says to us he says now uh in Isaiah 53 uh sorry in Isaiah 1:18 come let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as wool and though they be red like Crimson they will be as they shall be as wool so we see here God has made a way for you and I to come but I have to accept that you know and even I you know going to Sunday school as a kid and drawing the pictures and coloring in and all the things that kids do at Sunday school I never realized what Christ had to come I you know I I believed in a God but I never realized why Christ had to come so when we were young and if you can go back in your life maybe like this too when we were young I was married I married my first wife when she was uh 18 and I was 19 I don't recommend that right we were just kids but you know thank God he came into our lives and changed our lives right so uh you know we were at had a young couples around us at that time and I remember one night we were sitting around the house and and um talking and uh yeah well maybe I should yeah we drank a little beer and had you know and I mean we were we were Sinners man and and we got to talking now Vietnam War was on at that time and uh they were taking young men at 18 years of age I was 19 but then they came to a place to where uh Johnson had said well as long as the young man is married he don't have to go to war so I got married and then then we go a little bit further on a few years go a bit farther along and then they they say we're taking young men that are married I had a child we had a child and then went a little bit further on and they said we're taking young men with two children but no the war stopped then so you know I I just kept One Jump Ahead all the time right I didn't have to go to war but you know we were sitting there this guy and he he was the same position I was in and we were talking about God and we were and and I said to him so you're in a trench over in Vietnam and the Viet Kong are spraying the thing with bullets you're not going to ask God to help you he said no I said I would see and and I think God takes those confessions when you really don't even know anything about about it right he takes that confession and he made a way for me then to learn later on and so that was years later you know may I was maybe 21 22 years old I was 25 before he he actually came into my life but God kept putting people in my life that would begin to tell us about the Lord and before I left to go to New Zealand I had an old hunting partner that I used to go deer hunting with and um he came came to me and he'd been a Pentecostal boy he belonged to the uh Amy simple mcferson group and uh anyway he he was a rat bag yeah he was a Pentecostal boy but he was a rat bag you know he he was into drinking he was into everything but then he got saved and I watched the change we used to take alcohol to where we go deer hunting cuz we went by horseback up into the Wilderness Area of Oregon and uh then we got to a place to where we didn't take alcohol he took a Bible and he's laying on his bed reading his Bible and we're sitting around the campfire drinking so there was a change yeah and so when I was ready to come he came to me he says I want you to know one thing you need Christ in your life I said I believe in God but I don't know who this Jesus Christ is yeah because you know in Sunday school we did they never put it together Jesus was just a good man did wonderful things and so when he said that to me I go oh okay you know see you later then when I started the church I gone back in 1983 just before I started the church and I told him I felt that God was calling me into the ministry and I'd sent him a letter when I got saved and he had moved addresses but the letter arrived at his address and so he opened the letter and as he's driving he had to stop to read the letter because he was crying so hard because I had gotten saved wow now God puts people in your lives and they just kind of drop a little something in there that you you know you're not even aware of to begin with and then it just dribbles on down until it finally hits the rock bottom and then you get locked into it and so I told him I got saved so I went home and he gave me 500 us smackers so in those days it was double so I was a th000 bucks I started the church on $1,000 and I said Lord when it runs out I quit you know that was Faith yeah right and so uh because I sort of felt well because you you know as a young man you know you uh listen to the message doing God a service without his will and I don't want to be doing that I want to do God's service in his will not out of his will I want to be in his will and so you know if Lord if it's your will you'll make this thing profit if it's not your will you let it die okay so anyway we we started off with that and you know I was able to share with him later on that by your money this place is still going wow wow 40 years now 40 years we've been going some of you kids weren't even thought of so what we're dealing with here now is we're dealing with the Judgment of sin and really what we're talking about then it's past it's dealt with I don't go back and confess all the old sins that I did I I did that at Calvary and and you know I made that that confession and you know I'm one of those guys that kind of likes the individual to to make a confession of their own words because you know you can lead them in a sinner's prayer but the relationship is between you and God not me you and God and I can maybe Kickstart you to give you a a little bit of a start but you you need to do that that's right and I had a woman in my church for five years that was unsaved and she was the boy and the girl were kind of friendly together and but he wasn't going to marry her until she'd given her life to Christ and you know many of you know that we lost our oldest boy at 30 at 21 years of age 35 years ago and uh on the fifth anniversary of his death I was kind of down I said God can you do something for us do something for a special today it was the anniversary of his death and I said would you do something special and he told me I'm going to do something special so we had full church at that time only seated 70 but it was pretty well full and and uh I preached the message all of a sudden this this sister well she's a sister now but she she come forward and she's one of those private people you know don't like to you know be out there too much and very private and so she come up and she stood there and I knew it I said that's it Lord thank you thank you Lord so I I said whatat are you here for and she had her head down she says you know I said no I don't she said you know I said no I don't tell me what do you hear for because I wanted her to say I want to receive Christ as my savior right because it's out of the confession of your mouth that you're saved not not because you felt some pull by the holy Spirit you know I've talked to some of the older ones when God was really moving by his spirit in the the 50s and 60s I don't know if you guys ever remembered a guy named Harold hilderbrandt but he was he was a minister in the message but he was raised in in Pentecost and he say when he backslid he had to hang on to the seat so he wouldn't go forward the pull was so strong for him to come you don't have that today if there's a little inkling in your heart you need to go you need to make it right with God right cuz God's not pulling like that anymore you know and so you know I waited for her and she wouldn't say anything I said would you like me to help you yes she would she wouldn't even speak she was tears running down her face and everything I thought well that's a good sign and so we we let her started it off and then got her to Kickstart it and got her going and Margie you know her Karen Tolson so yeah it's it's one of those things that God does right and that's what we want to is to where they make that confession because now the sin has been judged it's passed right the Bible says if we confess with our mouth the Lord Jesus believe in thy heart God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved finished amen it's not even dealing with feelings it's confession with the mouth Thou shalt be saved it's not dealing with feelings all feelings will be a part of it but it it's not really dealing with feelings it's dealing with just that so let me give you a little illustration that that would kind of maybe help you so in the wild west days they would have prairie fires and the fires would burn through the Prairie and if a cowboy was out on the open and range and he seen the fire coming there was no way he could outrun the fire so what he would do is start a backfire where he's at at the present moment and he would let that fire run ahead of him then because it's blown behind him and he's going to let that fire run ahead of him so when that fire run far enough ahead of him he'd step out into that burnt ground now as the fire is coming in from behind him it's not going to touch him because it's already been burnt and he's safe and he can carry on going right the way the fire is going because he's behind the fire now he's not in front of the fire so that's what he is with Christ in you yeah you confess he's faithful and just to forgive you wow man I got up out of that time when I gave my life to the Christ and I was by Tears were pouring down my face but praise God I was free right I i' received something right so as we as we look at it the Bible tells us then and maybe you want to turn to this one let's go to 2 Thessalonians 1 because we realize now that the judgment is on Christ not on us and so when when we look at this thing we see it as a past now 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 8 it says INF flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God and Obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ so when the Judgment comes it's going to be upon those who have not received Christ as their savior that's right so we see that happening and we realize it's a past judgment now so there can't be a double jeopardy because it's already been judged yeah we're finished with that the Bible tells us for he was made sin who knew no sin that I might become the righteousness of God now I know I don't look righteous but it's not what I look like it's what he said amen cuz I know I've got faults and I'm sure if if I hang around you I'm going to find some faults right we're very good at that we'll find your we'll find your faults I guarantee you I will find your fault and you'll guarantee me that you'll find my fault right because that's that's the way we are okay so now we're in this position now where we've given our life to Christ so what where are we at then okay so from now on now we are a son of God and because we are a son of God we don't have judgment as far as Sin is concerned any longer because God loved us so now I move to the to the next step which is I'm under a judgment as a servant or as a son sorry and so as a judgment as a son now we see that the Bible tells us in First Peter 4:1 17 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be to them that obey not the gospel so that's happening right now that's what you come to church for it's not to be happy Clapper we enjoy that too but there is something that we want to be judged by and so we want to get the Judgment as a son so we become so the the name on the check is is good righten now I try not to go over any rabbit Bros you got to let me go this one just recently how how many of you know Ron Peterson minister in Arizona friend okay so he's I've I've known Ron for probably 20 years and and had him preach a couple of times at the church who had done missionary work with him and anyway his wife ended up with breast cancer and so she had a lump epom and she prayed in the name of Sandy Peterson I claim my he and when I first heard that I thought what are you doing didn't brother Brandon tell you the your name on the check is as good as his and she was healed now I wouldn't have done it that way would you I would have claimed the name of Jesus but you know if you're in a right relationship with the Lord he brother brand said the your name on the check is as good as the father's right I don't NE please understand I don't necessarily agree with this this isn't Alfred's Doctrine one and one right it's it's just that you know she did it and it happened and she got up before the church and she testified that God had healed her and she's come back clean what can I do right because your testimony is what God did for you am right and I may not like your Doctrine I may disagree with your Doctrine but your testimony I cannot deny if God did it for you how can I do that that's that's between you and the Lord so as we get judged as a as a son now let's see what brother brand says about it and when you come to a place called Kadesh barer at one of the time the I'm told was a great judgment seat I say a great spring of well there many little Wells a perfect type of the church the church is the Judgment seat where Heaven is the Judgment seat of God and the little Wells represent little churches all out and judgment begins at the house of God see here's where the judgment begins so you know there's the quote that brother brandom used we call it the word to the church you're all big one happy family now but Satan won't leave you like that he will send somebody in and he says don't you take sides with it because it's the devil and then you pray for that brother you pray for that sister whoever it might be that God will change them or move them out right now I've been around long enough but I've had I've seen that happen very vividly very vividly and you know you you you put time into people you put time into the situations you you go out of your way and they turn around and go right against the word of God some of them have I had to put out from underneath the blood some of them I've just said I think it's better you go somewhere else but it happens right and who am I who am I to do that right because I've got problems but we also have to keep the church clean that's right you can't have blatant sin in the church right so you've got to there's there's things there's in the scripture first 1 Corinthians 5 gives you the list tells you exactly what to do and one individual that I put out over 25 years ago she she thank God she well thank God that's not the right word to use um well thank God she's not in my church I can say that yeah when I when I took her out from underneath the blood she knew the word of good enough she he says I Repent you've got to take me back I said I ain't taking you back till you become born again because there was no birth in her she used the church to manipulate to whatever she needed and then would just come in on people hard and so I had to deal with it and it's not an easy thing to do I mean I don't want to it's it's just like okay it's just like marriage and divorce and I don't want to put any step on anybody's toes here but you know I some things seem very unfair right because we've watched over the years women young girls get married to guys and they're they look like they're solid but they turn out to be a dead loss and then they can't marry again hope this is okay Ben you might have to fix it up later but you know and and so the pastor has to take a stand on you cannot and when it's for the third time this what happened down home she had already had two living husbands and came the third what do you to do the Bible said till death do you part that's why I said that's my first wife my only wife right cuz you know what do you to do and and and you understand you know I mean because a woman's nature is to to nurture and to care and to to have a home and everything and and I feel for them because you know without that and their kids are raised in their mid-40s you feel for him but hey I have to stay with what the word says because judgment begins at the house of God that's amen it's not a condemnation but it's judging it's a Discerning wow we'll never going to get through this we don't carry on so let's look at this as the sun how God's going to judge you so first thing we realize it's a present day thing am this is happening on a regular basis we'll put it that way and so as we look at it happening on a regular basis we accept that Christ paid the penalty for sin and I've been born again into the family because the Bible says for as many as received him to them gave you power to become the Son of God but after that the Bible also says that we are to realize that there is a present day judgment go with me to Romans 8 verse4 and let's just go down through Romans 8 and see how Paul put this out here for us hallelujah in Romans 8:14 he begins to tell the church here he says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba Father amen that happens right he's your father now okay then he goes on he says it's the spirit that bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then Hees and HS of God and Joint HS with Christ so now I I because I'm a son I'm an heir of God I'm a joint Heir I've got an inheritance with God because of what I did at Cal what he did at Calvary and I accepted it nobody can take that away from me that's right nobody can take that away from you okay so as a son we should live then to please the father right and you know when your kids are small they want to please you you know and and you know you say good boy good girl you made your bed you threw your dirty clothes down you did that good good girl so you know the and and you know the encouragement then makes the kid want to do it even more right should right and so we we see then that God wants us to feel encouraged but there's also a judgment we have to do what he tells us to do and you know mothers God bless your heart have you picked up your clothes you know the kid wants to do something the first thing you say to him is have you picked up your clothes have you done have you fed the dog the cat whatever have you done this have you done that and you know what you repeat that thing how many times over and over have you done this you know you're wearing the monkey you should just tell the child do you have the freedom to go out and play right if you've already told them what to do then they take responsibility for what they're responsible for and then you just say do you have the freedom to do this you watch the wheels turn oh oh yeah now I see see so God expects you do you have the freedom you know how many times have I heard over the years oh God's been dealing with me over this well 35 years later come on man it's about time God quit dealing with you and you did it right so there has to to come a time to where you want to get right with God you want to do what the right thing is for God and so the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 6 verse 17 it says wherefore come out from among them be ye separate sayeth the Lord touch not the unclean thing for I will receive you I will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the almighty the Lord Almighty so God wants you to come away from the things of the world come closer to him and the closer you come to him the more privileges you have yeah things drop off but you got privileges right can I do one more rabbit Burl how much time I so I got into the prison to minister there and there was still one chaplain that was there that was uh 20 years ago that had kicked me out because of what we believed and I was going in under the volunteer person who was coordinating the volunteer he was headed of the chaplaincy she was head of the volunteers and uh the chaplain had sent word to her don't let that guy in the prison we kicked him out 20 years ago don't let him in he's got false Doctrine don't let him in and so uh she says to me what's the deal between you and the chaplain now I had learned from the guy who got me the interview inter which was a a chaplain a volunteer chaplain I had learned from him that she was a missionary child so her parents had been missionaries somewhere and and but she was no longer carrying on with a Christian experience and so I said to her well do you understand church history she says yes I do I said no you remember that in the Dark Ages we were all under Catholicism right she goes yes I I understand that and then there came a guy named Martin Luther who brought reformation and the light sprung out and the just shall live by faith and he he broke the Catholic Church apart and started the Lutheran Church well he didn't start it but the movement began from there she goes yeah I said I'm Martin Luther oh she says is that all it is come on in right so you know you can you can express things in a certain way that that people actually understand where you're coming from and appreciate it so we we need to realize that we have to have God dealing with us present day right rather than past and so brother Brown says you can't live in a rearview mirror you got to live in in today's society so as we begin to look at this thought here and we see he wants us to come away we realize now he wants us to judge ourselves so I don't know when you folks would have communion we have it once every other month first Sunday of every other month and that was a voted it's not my decision you know cuz when we had Co we even cut down from the one cup down to little cups once again I hope I'm not treading on toes here but um you know we'd had it one cup for 35 years and then all of a sudden we had to go down to one cup you know the little dinky thing and so but anyway that church voted upon it brother man says what the church votes is the Holy Ghost so we let we not my opinion anyway when we do First Corinthians 11 when we talk about the communion in 1 Corinthians 11 the Bible says at towards the end of it there he says in 1 Corinthians 11:31 he says if we judge ourselves right so before you come to the communion you judge yourself correct amen right you you make sure that you've got things right you don't want to take that cup unworthily right so you make sure that you've got things fixed up between you and him or him and you you know you you've done everything you needed to do because when you come to that time of Judgment of the first communion or that communion time you you want it to be right you don't want to eat and drink damnation to yourself amen all with me okay so he says we judge ourselves we should not be judged so if I'm judging myself then I'm not going to come into any more judgment right because I'm a son and it's a present day judgment amen and it's also a judgment upon self I'm not telling you now I may be telling you by preaching but I'm not telling you directly and if I'm reading your mail I'm I'm just the Mailman right I'm not I didn't brother Ben didn't tell me anything about you okay so but you know so that's what happens we judge ourselves and it brings us to a place of repentance Hallelujah because that's what we want to do before we have the communion we want to repent right anything is wrong there we want to make it right but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned to the world so we see that that now is a present day judgment and it's actually a repentance right I'm repenting so even though I repented of my sins and they've been dealt with I still have repentance I need to do that's still a part of my life but my sin that separated me has been dealt with so now as I look at that thought the Bible tells us in Acts 3: 19 it says repent therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and we know that repentance is a total turnaround not just a half not a 90 Dee but a 180 right go in a different direction okay the Bible also says that it should bring forth fruit meat for repentance so if you tell me that you know let me just put it this way I'm no longer going to smoke right I Repent of that well then I shouldn't see you smoking right I'm no longer going to drink I I shouldn't see you drinking you know I mean I'm trying to use something that I'm not going to step on anybody's toes anyway uh we we see then that it's a fruit coming from that and we know that Godly sorrow worketh repentance so if I realize what I've done to my Lord then I'm sorrowful for my Lord not because I got I got caught like I was telling you my sons the one would watch the other one and if the other one got in trouble the other one would say it was it was him dad I didn't do anything but he he might have done it but he started it right so he's he's shoving the thing over onto his brother so there's no Godly sorrow there right there has to be a Godly sorrow that's right and when I'm Godly sorrow I mean business yeah I mean business with God and then we should the Bible says forsake so Proverbs 28:13 says cover he that cover this him shall not Prosper but whosoever confesseth and forsaketh him shall have mercy so I confess it and then I forsake it I don't make provision for it yeah now I will slip and I will do things wrong and that's why we talk about with the anger resolution yeah you're going to have anger but we need to realize how I can resolve what I did wrong maybe you've had this over the years I've had guys come up to me you forgive me for what I've ever done to you which one right because you might have done quite a few but you were only thinking of one so it's always good to identify what you're asking sorry for or forgiveness for because if there's a multitude of them then which one is it and this is what I tell the guys with the man with their Partners I says you know don't let the sun go down upon your wrath right because you give a place for a devil you know that word place means a jurisdiction means a piece of ground you given them a piece of ground to work in and then the Bible says it's a stronghold and that stronghold stays there until you tear that stronghold down right so we see then that we realize that it's serious business we need to confess and forsake the sin if we do that hey I'm free free in the Lord then right okay so let's go a little further the next one is repentance but the next one is confession because I've seen many people repent and make somewhat of a confession but a True Confession brings forth the fruit and so the Bible tells us here as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent right so we confess and the Bible says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse Us in all unrighteousness hey man I'm camping on that one amen that's that's underlined that's the one I want because you know there's many things I do that that that are wrong then the last one is chastisement because if you won't pay attention H then I got to chastise you that's God right not me but that's God he's got a chastise you you you look at Paul doing God's service without his will and God had to knock him down now I said he ride a horse my wife says he didn't ride a horse but every picture I've got of him he's riding a horse right that's the clip art that I've got so you know knocked him off his high horse and put him on the ground made him blind right because he thought he was doing the right thing so God had the only way he was going to turn him around was nail him right and sometimes that's you sometimes he's got to do something pretty drastic to you too and then other times it may not be for that right CU we had people tell us when when Chris died the only reason Chris died was because he didn't go to the gizor convention it was on an Easter Good Friday 1988 boy I tell you what I nearly laid that guy out that was before I started preaching anger resolution by the way but you know I nearly I you know I mean that that's the wrong thing to tell a dad yeah at the funeral home when you've just gone and looked at the body of your son right 21 year old boy so you know it was it was tough going but we realize that sometimes God does things in chastisement to get your attention and he wants you to be faithful not successful and we'll deal with this in a few moments it's not about how much you do it's whether you're faithful in what you do I'm counting on that too okay so we've got this far let's bring her down the home stretch so the Bible says in Hebrews 12:5 have you forgotten the exhortation that speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastising God deal with you as sons and for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not so now we're dealing with chastisement in our lives right should be happening on a pretty regular basis some of you are able to confess right away some of you able to repent right away but others of you are as hard as hard can be but you're a son you're a daughter so he's not going to let you go yeah he's just going to have to do something more get your attention so the Bible says here that the chastisement is not for the payment of sin not for the payment of sin it's because you're doing wrong so give you an example here as a young boy I played baseball and uh we played in our street and I hit the ball and I broke the neighbor's window now the spanking didn't pay for the window right it only chastised me for doing wrong the window still had to be paid for so when God chastises his child it's not for the payment of sin but it's because Jesus Paid For That sin but because you're a son he's not going to let you get away with it you've got to make it right so just saying would you forgive me well which one because if I'm if you if I really want forgiveness from this person I'm going to itemize what you remember that time and I you and I and I kind of smacked you up alongside the head or something you remember that time you know I if I identify what we're talking about all of a sudden I can see okay now I can forgive him because he's he's wearing what he did wrong and that's what happens in the prison is I talked to them I said now you remember how your wife when you and her get in an argument or your partner because they're not many of them have wives anymore uh they they I said when you guys get in an argument she'll drag up stuff that was five years ago or 10 years ago yeah you did this to me yeah but what about when you did that to me you know and so we get this thing going and we say the Bible says don't let the sun go down upon your wrath because if you do it builds a stronghold and now you you're you got a stronghold and Satan comes out of that stronghold and torments you all the time and you come up you get prayed for every gizor convention Margie you remember this every gizor convention to be the same On's coming forward for prayer right and and what was wrong we didn't break the stronghold we only dealt with a surface problem fear anxiety pain whatever it might be well you got to break the stronghold you got to get the ground back yeah because he's got a right to stay there remember brother Braham said you cast a demon off somebody and and God put it there he said you're in trouble because God put it there for a reason right so we need to know what that is and confession and repentance and chastisement is God's way of bringing us to that place wow so don't despise the chastising of the Lord so what did job do wrong well he didn't do anything wrong right but you know what he did wrong have you ever figured it out I think it's chapter 4 job's talking about all the things that have gone wrong he says the very thing I feared Came Upon me yeah so it was his fear not trust in the Lord yeah his fear Came Upon him so it wasn't God wanted that fear out God wanted him to trust him and no matter what was going to happen so he had to allow something to happen so that job would come to a place where he could trust him and then you see in chapter is it 19 well one point he says though he slay me yet I'll trust him amen the other point I know my redeemer liveth right why he he crossed over now he he got to a place to where he' made things right with God and he crossed over and he oh GL and in the latter days he'll stand upon the Earth and though the skin worms eat my flesh yet in my flesh I'll see my God right so no fear right you got fear deal with it we can help you if we if we can but yeah you still got to deal with that thing okay let's move on to the last part here let me just validate this so in Galatians 4 Galatians the 4th chapter first to uh F first one to five verses gives a beautiful picture of it how that we're under the tutor so on but now when this child was born he became a son the very moment he was born in the family he he got it now then there was a tutor over the boy to educate him to raise him up well he was no more than a servant as the gal letter until he came to an age a certain time that he was set and this tutor would would always take the father's word your son is progressing right or whatever it was whoop I went went the wrong way did I yeah I did sorry okay oh wow uh Escape hit escape on that for mine will you we i' I've got lost I I I know I'm old and let's go back to uh maybe let's see what I can see here let's go back to 67 there yeah just double click it there okay speaking of K Baner right I think I can go forward now right yep okay I'll come to it now so we see now that he's judging us as Sons as in Galatians 4 now as we go a little further with this thought now we come to this this last one because we've been under child training and so in Galatians 4:1 there was this child training that was going to take place and the way it was done was chastisement so he brought us to that place of chastisement in order to bring us into that full sunship so that that our name on the check is as good as his now you see where where Sandy sister Sandy was getting it from because if I'm in the right position with God my name is as good although I personally I wouldn't do that but still I see the principle right okay so let's go a little further take it to the next spot we're going to take it now to to a future let me get this out of the way take it to the Future now and with the future then becomes we are judged as a servant okay let's go to uh 2 Corinthians 5:10 to fill in this last one so in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 10 so we're going to take responsibility to have our confessions and our efforts to do right and then we we come to 2 Corinthians 5:10 for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that Heath done whether it is good or bad now this is the Judgment seat of Christ this is not the white Throne judgment now brother brandham had the dream do you remember this where he had the dream where uh his name was called I'm going to paraphrase it his name was called and he starts to go forward and hope comes into one hand and he steps a little bit further and mey comes into the other hand so what happened he went to the rewards for what he had done they're Broms no they weren't Broms brother they weren't blood related they're you and I believing the message right that's what he saw behind him is as a reward so we we see then this is what we're talking about it's not a judgment to judge you for sin and wrong necessarily but because you have put it under the blood and you're serving God now you're going to be judged as a servant of God and as you're judged as a servant of God we see that uh we all come before the Judgment seat of God now important now to go to 1 Corinthians 3: 11 so as you go to 1 Corinthians 3:1 we're talking about a future judgment and first thing we're going to deal with here and we're just almost done so stay with me watch this is a this is so good I trust you'll see it way that way as well 1 Corinthians 3:1 11 sorry for the foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ so your foundation must be in Jesus Christ amen not the message not because I believe a prophet not because I believe serpent seed not because I believe Doctrine it's because I believe Jesus Christ paid for my sin that's that's where my Foundation has to be CU watch watch as we go further with this now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble so we got six things that you're going to build on so what are we dealing with here we're dealing with a judgment but it's being judged on service of what I built with interesting let's go a little further verse 13 Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work what sort it is ah so now my works are going to be judged at a fire and the fire is generally the fiery Trials of your faith right what am I doing with each trial that God sends me how am I how am I handling it am I taking it back to the Lord right so it's not a it's it's a service of works and we see here gold silver precious stones hay wood hay stubble what happens with fire fire with those first three only make them better fire with the second three they get burned up okay let's go a little further verse 14 and if any man's work abides okay something's going to hold it through if any man's work abides which he has built thereupon he shall receive a reward so the fire is what's going to test the work let's go a little further verse 15 if any man's Works shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so by fire ah a penny dropped so over the years I baptized over 200 people you know I so many of them over 40 years it's hard for me to count I got about 40 there now so what's happened to them all well I don't know what's happened to them all but if they were I baptized them right right in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I made sure that they received Christ as their savior so no matter what they do now what they build upon is their business and it will be Tried by fire but if it gets burnt up and their Foundation was good it'll stay that's why you see the foolish Church come up in Revelation 7 who are these These are they who G through Great Tribulation and made their robes white through the blood of the Lamb why because their Works got burnt but they love the Lord they may have been baptized right they may not have been but they love the Lord so you know you can't judge somebody because God's still gonna he's still got a foolish church somewhere so we see here that the man will suffer LOF but he shall be saved by fire okay let's let's look at the other part of this verse here so now we're dealing with in verse 15 is it yeah verse 15 if any man's Works shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved by fire so when we look at this thought here we realize that his works it's really dealing with the Judgment of what sort it is so we see here in verse 12 for If any man will build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay or stubble so that's dealing with the sort or the size not the size the sort so even if I have a small church that don't make any difference if I have a large church more trouble but but it's not dealing with with size it's dealing what are you building with right so when when I first got started I ran at an old Methodist Church and I I got a little catchy phrase I'm preaching the seventh Angel's message in the six Message Church six Angel message church right didn't mean a whole lot but you know you like to have these little catchy phrases shakina of glory and all these things that we use you know we have these little catchy phrases that we use no offense I preach every place twice at least I preach and then I have to go back and say I'm sorry for what I preach okay so we we see here that that the Bible tells us it's not what the size so it's God's not dealing on size he said what are you preaching so it's not un success it's where I'm serving God is God real in my heart do I want him active in my life that's what God's dealing with that's the sort I'm dealing with precious stones gold silver that's only going to get better with the fire hey wouldn't stubble be burnt up okay let me finish it off with this is thought here's brother Brandon this I believe is every pastor and then at that day of the rewards given out God's standing there I hope I'm standing near with my hands up screaming to see him place the crown upon your head that's where we want to stand as ministers with our congregation sitting there and watch you come forward your name's called Hallelujah they made it I don't know how they they did it but they made it right that's what we want right that's that's that's our heart's desire is to see people make it I mean we're we're not in this for the money Silver and Gold Have I None amen such as I have give by thee right haven't had a raise in 10 years but Silver and Gold Have I None such as I give have give I Thee that's where we want to be so now we told you what we're going to say and everything now we're going to ask you the question okay out of this chart where do you stand where are you on this chart are you still not serving God have you not asked the Lord into your life this is your opportunity to receive Christ it's your call you see the judgments of God you saw how it works you see that it's not going to be a bed of roses everything's going to go you know once I give me eyes to Christ it's going to be fine I mean there is a time of honeymoon time sure but then comes the hard yards yeah man I I told you I thought I was a young man I thought I was going to take the thing into the Rapture and here we are who would believe we'd be 2024 I worked on the sheep station in in 70s 72 in Hawks Bay there and every post we put in the ground this will do to 77 well 77 is come and gone long ago right but we weren't reading what brother brandham said he said this is not prophecy this is I predict because I see things happening and look I can predict right now who would believe that Israel could send off an explosion by somebody wearing a pager surely the Lord's coming right yeah he's very close and then a cell phone okay so where are you where are you standing then are you judged are you judging your own sin and the next one is are you being chastised by the Lord don't go quiet on me now come on and then finally will you have a reward is the Judgment seat of Christ right so I'm not talking about size I'm talking about sword see he didn't call you to be successful he called you to be faithful amen one last thought in SE 87 we've been going for about four years and things had kind of plateaued and I thought we Revival was going to strike and you know because you know in America as children we're taught that you could be president of the United States I don't know how that would be well I guess anybody could be if Trump's going to be right but uh you know we're taught that you can do anything just put your nose to the wheel and do it and I you kiwis are not a lot way different than that you know there's a lot of kiwis that spend hard time working right but things are plateaued so I called a guy named Ted Pedley he's still around and uh I had him come out to hold Revival because he was an evangelist and we were having these revivals down at the old church there white cuckoo and uh we had a beach house at that time because we lived on the farm so we had a beach house and he was staying in the beach house during the day we'd pick him up go to service bring him back feed him B him down then he would spend the day at the beach house he came to me he says this morning I was out on the beach walking thinking about what the Lord wanted me to do he came to me and he said to me this whole thing is because if you if there's no Revival after this you're going to shut down I said yeah that's what I put before the Lord he said I want you to know something this has helped me all these years right he says God didn't call you to be successful he called you to to be faithful just keep doing what's right amen God will bring the success one way or the other and so you know he knows what we can stand he knows what we're able to take care of he knows exactly what's going to happen so let God just trust him Proverbs 3:5 the maybe one of the first scriptures you ever learned trust in the Lord with all your heart lean not on your own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths right just trust am and you know we just over in vanatu over in vanatu with the 50th of the Jubilee celebration for the message going to the to the uh vanatu this February March and brother Moy is the pastor at at Port V and um I've known him for a lot of years I started going there in 1995 so I was one of the few surviving guys that had been going there the longest so they asked me to come and do this celebration ceremony with brother Ron Peterson and uh brother Moy I told Brother Moy as he says we need to hear that because what happens with these guys you know island people when they when they have a pastor he's the king he gets the best food he gets the nice car he gets all the nice things right and so they a lot of guys want to be Pastor because they want all those things and he says you know we need to realize realiz that we need to be faithful rather than successful and so you today you be faithful amen and on that day I'll be there hey praise the Lord they made how I don't know how but they did it praise God what a wonderful thing huh GL let's stand [Applause] well I trust that we've said something that you could identify with you can see where you're at and you can see how God is dealing with you and some of you are thick you know keep with have a kiwi saying you're thick as two post but you know God still can deal with you if you come to that repentance right and and confession and and say God I I all I want to do is be faithful put me in a church somewhere where I can just be the doorkeeper at the house of God rather than the tents of the wicked right amen I invite the musicians to come oh you guys got more musicians you got congregation you know we've always struggled with that my son that was killed was a musician but the we struggled with that for years and years and so I went to Brother Eugene Brown's Church in Edmonton Canada he had 15 song leaders and I said to him that's sinful I said I'm lucky to get one you got 15 brother Ben you better
