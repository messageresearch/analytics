[4:14] doctors said that I wasn't going to
[4:15] survive I think that was the situation
[4:16] and my mother had apparently prayed and
[4:20] the Lord gave her a promise that I would
[4:21] live and that's why they called me Isaac
[4:23] because the promised son apparently

[21:14] having church lunch the Sunday at the
[21:16] community hub here in Stokes Valley and
[21:20] also there's a music practice as well I
[21:22] mean so if you like to stand with me
[21:25] sorry for making you sit just now let's
[21:27] go to Daniel chapter 9 and we're going
[21:32] to read verses 1 1 2 3
[21:45] she's here
[21:50] then unit 9 in verse 1 2 3 it says in
[21:56] the first year of Darius a son of a
[21:59] hazardous of the seed of the Medes which
[22:01] was made king over the realm of the
[22:03] Chaldeans and the first year of his
[22:05] reign I Daniel understood by the books
[22:07] the number of the years where of the
[22:10] word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[22:11] Prophet that he would accomplish 70
[22:14] years in the desolations of Jerusalem
[22:16] and I set my face unto the Lord God to
[22:20] seek by prayer and supplication with
[22:22] fasting and sack cloth and ashes amen
[22:26] and we'll just go to Zechariah chapter 4
[22:29] I'm going to read the first seven verses
[22:44] this is in the angel that talked with me
[22:48] came again and waked me as a man that
[22:51] wakened out of his sleep and said unto
[22:54] me what's it thou and I said I have
[22:57] looked and behold a candlestick all of
[22:59] gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
[23:01] his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes
[23:04] to the seven lamps which are upon the
[23:07] top thereof and two olive trees by one
[23:10] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[23:12] other upon the left thereof aside
[23:14] thereof so I answered and spake unto the
[23:16] angel that talked with me saying what
[23:18] are these my lord in the angel that
[23:21] talked with me answered and said unto me
[23:22] knowest thou not what these be and I
[23:25] said no my lord then he answered and
[23:28] spake unto me saying this is the word of
[23:30] the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by
[23:33] might nor by power nor by my spirit
[23:35] saith the Lord of hosts I mean sorry
[23:37] this is the word Lord and as rouble
[23:39] saying not by might nor by power but by
[23:42] my spirit saith the lord of hosts who
[23:44] art thou a great mountain before before
[23:46] xue rule thus shall become a plain thou
[23:50] shall become a plain and he shall bring
[23:51] forth the headstone where with shoutings
[23:55] crying grace grace unto it I mean let's
[23:58] bow our heads in word of Prayer gracious
[24:01] father we thank you we can be gathered
[24:02] this night Lord as our people to be
[24:05] gathered father to you and naught I just
[24:07] ask as we as we gather here Lord we have
[24:10] opened your word and we know that any
[24:13] mortal that can read can open the pages
[24:15] of your Bible and they can they can read
[24:17] the words but it takes you the author to
[24:19] come and anoint it to us Lord to to
[24:21] bring the interpretation and to make it
[24:23] plain we thank you Father this book is
[24:25] not a book of mystery to us anymore but
[24:28] you have revealed it farther in this end
[24:30] time and I just pray father's we look
[24:32] into this this thoughtless night father
[24:34] may you awaken us more and more ahead
[24:37] father may you bless your word to every
[24:39] soul I just father we have we all have
[24:42] needs on our hearts and and battles and
[24:45] things we are going through I pray you
[24:47] to meet those needs
[24:48] Lord this night father according to your
[24:50] riches and glory and we want to pray for
[24:52] those who couldn't make it here this
[24:53] night be their portion and their
[24:54] strength father Lord we just commit the
[24:57] service into your hands may
[24:58] have preeminence for your glory alone we
[25:01] ask these things in your wonderful name
[25:02] and them Lord Jesus Christ amen I mean
[25:06] God bless you all you may have your
[25:07] seats this night so I want to maybe
[25:11] start a start a subject that if I could
[25:14] title this something I want to speak
[25:16] about awakening to the day an hour in
[25:18] which you live we we are living in a we
[25:22] understand the world as you know we're
[25:24] living in a very important time in
[25:26] history and we but we're going to know
[25:30] where we are in the scripture because if
[25:32] you don't know where you are in the
[25:33] scripture how do you know where you have
[25:35] been and how do you know where you have
[25:37] to go to since you've got to know where
[25:38] you are like if you have a map you know
[25:41] you ought to know where you are on the
[25:43] map to see how much further you have to
[25:44] travel to your destination now Daniel we
[25:47] see here he was reading the prophecy of
[25:50] Jeremiah and he had come to recognize
[25:53] that it was nearly the time of
[25:55] completion of the 70 years where God
[25:58] spake through Jeremiah that they would
[26:00] be carried into Babylon they would be
[26:02] near 70 years then after that 70 years
[26:04] they would return to to the homeland so
[26:07] they came a time when they were going to
[26:09] return to their homeland and this stood
[26:11] up Jeremiah well I mean so I uh it stood
[26:14] Daniel up he began to pray and he began
[26:17] to inquire Lord what is going on in my
[26:19] season what is going on in the day and I
[26:22] on which I live he didn't just let it
[26:24] pass them by he wanted to know amen
[26:27] because he knew that he would have he is
[26:29] going to play a part in the scripture
[26:32] and this prophecy there's word for us
[26:34] that we must fulfill in this day are you
[26:38] following me so far
[26:39] amen to this so we can't just let you
[26:41] know we live in this in this lukewarm
[26:43] age this lady I see in church age you
[26:46] know it's all lukewarm a little bit hot
[26:48] a little bit you are not too hot not too
[26:49] cold just tip it kind of atmosphere and
[26:52] you know we don't want to let that
[26:54] affect our spiritual life I mean this
[26:56] should be a crying out Lord is a
[26:58] scripture for me to fulfill there's a
[27:00] word that must be manifested in my life
[27:03] I don't want to let it pass me by this
[27:05] is my one life I have to live I want to
[27:07] live it for you flow through me Holy
[27:10] Spirit flow through me
[27:11] I mean that your word would be fulfilled
[27:13] in my life hallelujah because the bride
[27:16] has a portion of the word that she must
[27:18] manifest upon the earth and you Moses
[27:21] say it must all be me I mean it's not
[27:23] just enough for my mom or dad or my
[27:25] neighbor I want it to be me Lord I want
[27:27] you to manifest your word in my life
[27:29] so Daniel begin to pray it was more than
[27:32] just tickling his ears I wasn't that
[27:34] interesting 70 years is nearly up he
[27:36] began to pray and he was fasting and he
[27:38] was diligent and he sought God God
[27:41] when's this going to happen you know
[27:42] what's going on in my day an hour and
[27:44] then eventually an angel came and and
[27:47] showed him things that must come to pass
[27:49] now if this was a man living in living
[27:53] in Babylon we didn't even know if he
[27:55] offered a sacrifice there in a strange
[27:57] land I mean but he's just under the Old
[27:59] Testament law and he began to pray and
[28:01] seek God for when when when the next
[28:05] part of the scripture would be fulfilled
[28:06] amen how much more people under the
[28:08] blood of Jesus Christ that are not out
[28:10] of their homeland in a strange land but
[28:13] they've come back to the homeland which
[28:14] is their you know which is the Word of
[28:16] God
[28:16] hallelujah how much more people I mean
[28:19] which have a greater promise more than
[28:21] just going from a natural you know from
[28:23] from modern-day Iraq back to Israel but
[28:26] they're going from this world to the
[28:27] next world how much more people are
[28:29] going to be taken hallelujah I think we
[28:32] should pray and seek God and seek Him in
[28:35] his word hallelujah because he's a
[28:38] reward of them that diligently seek Him
[28:40] I mean so I believe we should we should
[28:43] look into the scripture look into what
[28:45] the prophetess taught us about this day
[28:47] and diligently look into it
[28:49] dig into it hallelujah brother Bram says
[28:52] is untapped resources and God is that
[28:55] this resources sitting there in his word
[28:57] that have been untapped and we must will
[28:59] become prospectors and begin to dig and
[29:02] begin to refine and pick it up and see
[29:04] oh this is precious
[29:05] hallelujah was worth the labor I mean
[29:08] you see people they know gold is under
[29:10] some rock and they'll dig and I'll move
[29:12] tons of dirt and tons of rock and
[29:14] they'll put a lot of energy into it and
[29:17] then finally they'll get the gold
[29:18] hallelujah and they know what to worried
[29:20] about all the rock they have to move
[29:22] they say look at all this gold of God
[29:24] amen it should be the same thing with us
[29:27] hallelujah wish me looking at the prize
[29:29] cuz it's worth it all
[29:31] hallelujah now Zechariah he was awakened
[29:35] as one out of sleep now before God
[29:38] really comes your way we're all been
[29:39] sleeping someone who's asleep
[29:42] is they may be in the same room you were
[29:45] but if they're totally asleep they won't
[29:47] catch what's going on they won't
[29:49] understand what's going on because
[29:50] they're asleep but yet they're alive yet
[29:53] they're in the same place you may be in
[29:54] you know there's been a lot of people I
[29:56] mean but the first big earthquake caused
[29:58] them was in Gisborne I slept through it
[30:00] and there were chimneys came down damage
[30:03] to buildings I just slept right through
[30:04] the thing I wasn't awakened to what was
[30:07] going on and the timer was alive we
[30:09] don't want to be asleep when God is
[30:11] shaking this earth we don't want to be
[30:13] asleep when God is calling a bride we
[30:15] don't want to be asleep when he's
[30:17] fulfilling his word and mercy has come
[30:19] upon the earth hallelujah we don't want
[30:21] to be asleep when he's given the
[30:22] invitation I'm going to take you up into
[30:24] a wedding supper I'm gonna unite myself
[30:26] with you here hallelujah we don't want
[30:31] to be asleep so he was Zechariah I was
[30:33] awakened and he began to see some things
[30:35] and it's the same thing with us I'm just
[30:38] kind of laying a bit of a foundation
[30:39] we'll see where this goes later on but
[30:41] you know we've become awakened this
[30:43] message has been sent to awaken us I
[30:46] mean more than just being Church people
[30:48] or religious people but it awakens us I
[30:51] mean that we know that that not just the
[30:53] day now which we live but we know the
[30:55] promise that God has said there's
[30:57] multitudes upon the earth they know
[30:59] world war three is coming they know our
[31:00] mageddon is coming people prep and they
[31:03] do all kinds of things I mean they can
[31:05] see things coming upon the earth but
[31:07] they've missed the awakening of the
[31:09] bride I mean they've missed their ticket
[31:11] out of here
[31:11] but if God be gracious to them I pray he
[31:14] is he'll awaken them to God has to come
[31:17] and awaken you hallelujah and if you've
[31:20] been awakened if he's pulled on your
[31:22] heart and and your and your eyes have
[31:24] come open whose eyes have come open in
[31:26] this day and hour I mean that's got
[31:28] awakened you out of sleep I mean you may
[31:31] have been raised in church set their
[31:32] service after service but there comes a
[31:35] time when God speaks to you and God
[31:37] opens your eyes
[31:38] just to recognize your lust that's God
[31:40] awakening you hallelujah to your present
[31:42] state but he doesn't want to leave you
[31:44] in that state hallelujah he wants to
[31:46] awaken us and if you've been awakened to
[31:49] the promise of this hour you're the most
[31:50] blessed person I mean you're the most
[31:53] blessed person although all the earth
[31:56] Alleluia
[31:57] an angel awakened Zechariah and an angel
[32:01] has awakened us we are living in a
[32:06] precious time you gotta you know God
[32:08] placed great value upon you he's placed
[32:11] great value upon you he put you above
[32:13] his own life he put you above his own
[32:16] blood hallelujah he sent you Elijah the
[32:18] prophet and you just read you read the
[32:21] prophets life of all the strain and the
[32:22] hardship and everything he had to go
[32:24] through I mean that he had come to a
[32:26] place where a sword would be put in his
[32:28] hand the Word of God
[32:29] I meant that that sword had gone to you
[32:31] hallelujah that you had become prepared
[32:33] to meet your God he went through a great
[32:36] deal of hardship and strain and God kept
[32:39] them on earth you know God really
[32:41] trained him and dealt with him maybe
[32:43] more severely than he would deal with us
[32:45] because he was a word gonna come through
[32:47] his lips hallelujah that's how much God
[32:49] God watched over his word for you
[32:53] hallelujah God watched over his word for
[32:56] you God's eyes are upon his children has
[33:01] elected one amen and and that's a good
[33:04] thing because he's interested in you he
[33:08] may he's not really interested in what's
[33:10] going on in North Korea and Russia and
[33:12] whatever more but he's more interested
[33:14] in you he's more interested in his
[33:16] elected ones and he wants you to be
[33:18] awakened because was an awakening comes
[33:20] a comes an awakening to who you are an
[33:23] awakening to your position the Prophet
[33:26] tells us when the bride recognizes what
[33:28] she is then the rapture will go
[33:30] hallelujah there's got to become a
[33:32] recognition more than just up in here in
[33:34] a mental understanding where something
[33:36] drops down into here and you begin to
[33:39] recognize I'm a son or daughter of the
[33:41] king
[33:41] hallelujah his royal blood now flows
[33:43] through my veins hallelujah and that's
[33:47] how we are well you say well how do I
[33:49] know that that I'm one of them
[33:52] how do you know the very reason he told
[33:54] you you were lost it undone is because
[33:56] he wants to take you from that state
[33:58] awaken you because you are one of his
[34:00] children amen
[34:02] now let's go to Isaiah 29 I'm just gonna
[34:07] read we're gonna read a few scriptures
[34:10] but the the promise of this day I'm glad
[34:14] that the mystery of God has become open
[34:17] to us in this hour we're not stumbling
[34:19] around saying as he three is he five of
[34:22] az2 or you know how many is he and you
[34:25] know how what does he love what is he
[34:27] not love how does he want us to be we
[34:29] don't know it's not sealed it's not
[34:32] being sealed up amen if God has awakened
[34:35] you as it would be his wood becomes
[34:37] plain it's not a mystery as and you
[34:40] don't understand it it becomes something
[34:42] that was hidden is now revealed amen so
[34:46] Isaiah 29 and 9 he says here stay
[34:52] yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry
[34:58] they are drunken but not with why and
[35:00] they stagger but not with strong drink
[35:02] for the Lord hath poured out upon you
[35:05] the spirit of deep sleep now this is not
[35:08] speaking of you this is the world this
[35:09] world is being lulled to a drunken sleep
[35:12] and have closed your eyes the prophets
[35:16] and your rulers the seers Hathi covered
[35:18] and the vision of all has become unto
[35:20] you as the words of a book that is
[35:22] sealed amen it's become sealed to some
[35:27] it's become sealed which men deliver one
[35:31] that has learned saying read this I pray
[35:33] thee and he saith I cannot further
[35:35] sealed and the book has delivered to him
[35:37] that does not learn saying read this I
[35:39] pray thee and he saith I am not learned
[35:41] therefore the Lord said for as much as
[35:44] this people draw near me with their
[35:46] mouths and with their lips to honor me
[35:48] but has removed their heart far from me
[35:51] and their fear towards me as taught by
[35:53] the precept of men I'm just going to
[35:56] leave it right there
[35:57] but there so there comes a season where
[35:59] here's the book and people are passing
[36:02] it around what does it say what does it
[36:04] say and
[36:05] you bring it into modern terms people go
[36:07] on YouTube what does this say and they
[36:09] look at this person then they go to go
[36:10] to what this person says about the Bible
[36:12] and they and they search and search them
[36:14] they're saying what does it say what
[36:15] does it say but people who are just
[36:17] probing at things it's sealed to them
[36:19] but unto his elected ones I trust you
[36:22] can say I'm one of them it's not a
[36:23] sealed book Amen it's become an open
[36:26] book hallelujah where things where
[36:28] people do not understand who they are in
[36:30] Christ he makes you understand who you
[36:32] are in him and when he causes you to
[36:34] understand what he's done for you and
[36:36] what redemption really is what salvation
[36:38] really is hallelujah amen he shows you
[36:41] what healing really is and peace
[36:44] hallelujah
[36:45] does he not he does it's not just a nice
[36:48] idea it becomes a reality and when it
[36:50] becomes a reality that means it's not
[36:52] sealed up anymore Amen hallelujah so now
[36:58] there are people in this category but I
[37:01] trust you say well that's pretty tough I
[37:03] just say glory to God I'm thankful not
[37:06] fulfilling that Scripture I mean because
[37:08] it says in the last days that the word I
[37:10] mean the book would be sealed until the
[37:12] time of the end we're living at the time
[37:14] and the end and it's not sealed anymore
[37:16] this Bible is not a book of mystery to
[37:18] us it's a love-letter hallelujah and
[37:21] it's by relationship you can read the
[37:23] love letter and you can understand what
[37:25] he's really saying because you have a
[37:26] relationship just like the Prophet says
[37:29] his wife would write Amelita when he's
[37:30] out on the campaigns and he'd say yeah I
[37:32] just put Billy to bed and that in all
[37:34] different things and he says because I
[37:36] have a relationship with her I
[37:38] understand exactly what she's saying
[37:40] without her even really saying it right
[37:42] out hallelujah because there's a
[37:44] relationship amen and it's the same
[37:47] thing with us amen if you have a
[37:50] relationship with him you understand
[37:52] what he's saying without him really
[37:54] saying it right out we say what do you
[37:55] mean you go into Joseph's life and he
[37:58] see Joseph taking a Gentile bride a man
[38:01] and she's up in the palace before he
[38:03] reveals himself to his brethren he's
[38:05] telling you in there he's saying I'm
[38:07] going to take you marry you take up the
[38:10] wedding supper then I'm going to come
[38:11] down and reveal myself to my brethren
[38:14] hallelujah like the story of Ruth I mean
[38:16] she's a Gentile Boaz the mighty man of
[38:19] it becomes more than a story hallelujah
[38:23] hallelujah now brother Bram says in 1964

[38:47] complaining ministers crying I was

[39:17] great thing going to happen all of you

[39:21] then he asked the question why do they
[39:23] do that why do they do that they want a
[39:26] Great Awakening they're crying believing
[39:28] there will be awakening they're good
[39:30] people
[39:31] why is it what have they done they have
[39:33] not recognized the awakening of the
[39:36] bride see by being a Christian they feel
[39:38] the pull of the hour but they haven't
[39:40] recognized what's been done that's what
[39:43] making them feel that way they know
[39:44] something is supposed to happen but see
[39:47] they're looking for it a way off in the
[39:49] future to come when it's already
[39:51] happened right by you
[39:53] hallelujah and they were you know
[39:56] brother and sister more that was Jack
[39:57] more from life tabernacle and Shreveport
[39:59] brother brand preached a lot of messages
[40:01] there he was one of us campaign managers
[40:03] he is right there by the prophet of God
[40:06] I mean but yet they're saying there's
[40:08] going to be a new breaking of the day
[40:09] pray pray pray he's saying they good
[40:11] people they feel the pull of the hour
[40:13] just like a lot of Christians in the
[40:15] world they feel the pull of the hour
[40:16] we're going to prepare for Armageddon
[40:18] we're going to prep for this and this
[40:20] and this and this there's a pool because
[40:22] a Great Tribulation is going to sit in a
[40:24] min very soon so they feel the pull but
[40:27] they having to recognize their wakening
[40:30] of the brain hallelujah
[40:32] have not recognized the awakening of the
[40:34] bright but there's some people upon the
[40:36] earth I trust I'm looking at them some
[40:39] of them hallelujah Amen that they God
[40:42] has caused him to recognize Amen that
[40:45] this message is more than a man from
[40:47] Kentucky it's a voice from heaven that's
[40:49] God speaking through us through his
[40:51] vindicated servant this is me gathering
[40:53] you to myself hallelujah we've been
[40:56] awakened amen we have been awakened now
[41:02] God is not slack you say well that was
[41:05] preached in 1964 there was a very long
[41:08] time ago most of us were not even born
[41:10] at that time I'll say this God is not
[41:14] slack concerning his promise because if
[41:17] God came back in 1977 and the rapture
[41:20] had gone or wherever more I mean we
[41:22] would not have been there but God waited
[41:24] because he had so many names on the
[41:26] Lamb's Book of Life and those names had
[41:28] to be manifested I mean I believe that
[41:31] you got to say my name was on that book
[41:33] hallelujah and I had to be manifested
[41:35] upon the earth and I had to receive my
[41:38] my Savior amen I had to become one with
[41:41] him hallelujah
[41:42] and then so God is not slack concerning
[41:44] his promise of a rapture amen but he
[41:47] lets it go or what we think of it going
[41:49] on because there's ones that have to
[41:51] come in
[41:52] amen there's got to be people from every
[41:54] kindred nation tongue Amen it has to be
[41:57] there
[41:57] so God God's great timepieces moving on
[42:00] he knows when it's going to happen
[42:02] I meant sometimes we think is just
[42:04] lagging on and I never thought we'd be
[42:06] here in 2018 but here we are but the
[42:09] promise of a body changes just as real I
[42:12] mean it's just as fresh it's still going
[42:15] to happen i mean noah preached for 120
[42:18] years and maybe here try and start as
[42:20] sermons all different kinds of ways but
[42:22] it always come back to the same
[42:24] conclusion it's going to rain god told
[42:26] me to build this Ark get in the ark when
[42:28] it's finished and you'll be safe when
[42:30] the waters come that was always this
[42:32] conclusion of the service does it matter
[42:34] how much he tried to change it around to
[42:36] make it a bit different it always ended
[42:38] up that same conclusion and then
[42:40] eventually it happened eventually they
[42:44] got in and eventually the
[42:46] all clothes and eventually the rain fell
[42:48] hallelujah that's going to happen it's
[42:51] going to happen
[42:52] God is not slack concerning his promise
[42:55] as some men count slackness but is
[42:57] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[42:59] that each of perish but that all should
[43:02] come to repentance but the day the Lord
[43:04] will come as a thief in the night in
[43:06] which the heavens shall pass away with
[43:08] great noise the elements shall pass melt
[43:10] with fervent heat the earth also and the
[43:12] works that are therein shall be burned
[43:13] up seeing then that all these things be
[43:17] dissolved what manner of persons ought
[43:19] we to be in all holy conversation and
[43:22] godliness looking for and hasting unto
[43:25] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[43:27] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[43:28] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[43:31] heat aiming at second Peter 3 God is not
[43:34] slack amen better but he is gathering
[43:37] his children out of every corner of the
[43:39] world hallelujah now look at look at
[43:43] wait you know we understand that our
[43:45] redemption is tied and with Israel's
[43:47] Redemption we can see this in the Book
[43:49] of Ruth was now Naomi and and and Ruth
[43:52] and and how and how they were redeemed
[43:54] our our Redemption is linked with the
[43:56] Jewish people and now if you look at the
[43:59] history of of the return of Israel they
[44:03] had a lot of opposition they had a lot
[44:05] of obstacles amen there were there were
[44:08] countries and regimes that would not let
[44:10] the people go there was the Soviet Union
[44:13] and they had their Iron Curtain
[44:15] and Israel was already a nation but the
[44:18] Soviet Union would not let them go but
[44:20] they came a time when the wall fell down
[44:22] and they had to go they had to return to
[44:25] their homeland nothing upon the earth
[44:28] could stop God's children returning to
[44:31] their homeland hallelujah the Jews have
[44:34] to return to their homeland because
[44:35] Jesus will were in the wedding supper
[44:37] he's gonna come down reveal himself to
[44:39] them I mean there's a hundred forty-four
[44:41] thousand of them that are going to be
[44:43] there and God has ordained they'll be
[44:45] there and nothing can stop them being
[44:47] there hallelujah
[44:48] the the iron curtain had to fall amen
[44:51] doesn't matter what man tries to build
[44:53] up to keep God's children from going to
[44:56] their homeland it has to be it has to
[44:58] let go
[44:59] has to go amen anything that gets in the
[45:02] way of God's program that's going to
[45:04] move hallelujah amen he says in Isaiah
[45:09] 43 but now thus saith the Lord that
[45:12] created the Oh Jacob and that formed
[45:14] thee O Israel fear not for I have
[45:17] redeemed thee I have called thee by thy
[45:20] name thou art mine when now passes
[45:23] through the waters I'll be with thee and
[45:24] through the rivers shall not overflow
[45:26] thee when thou walk us through the fire
[45:29] thou shall not be burned neither shall
[45:31] the flame Kindle upon thee for I am THE
[45:34] LORD thy God the Holy One of Israel thy
[45:38] Savior I gave Egypt for thy ransom
[45:40] Ethiopia and see before thee since thou
[45:43] was precious in my sight
[45:44] thou has been honorable and I have loved
[45:47] thee therefore will I give men for the
[45:49] young people for thy life fear not for I
[45:52] am with thee I will bring thy seed from
[45:54] the east and will gather them from the
[45:56] West I'll say to the north give up and
[45:58] to the south keep not back bring my sons
[46:01] from far and my daughters from the ends
[46:03] of the earth even everyone that's called
[46:05] by my name for I've created him for my
[46:07] glory I have formed him yay I have made
[46:10] him so when God makes the commandment
[46:12] they must come I mean nothing can hold
[46:14] them back they must come he following me
[46:17] amen the Soviet Union fell apart I mean
[46:20] all the countries that tried to hold
[46:22] them back they fell apart because God
[46:24] said they cannot remain there they must
[46:26] return to their homeland hallelujah and
[46:29] so now if that is the case in the
[46:31] natural how much more in the spiritual I
[46:33] mean this is a natural and natural
[46:35] people coming back to their position in
[46:38] their promised land and God calls come
[46:41] forth amen we hold them not back south
[46:44] give them up hallelujah is a commandment
[46:46] goes forth they had to return just the
[46:49] natural people back to their homeland

[46:53] member we are the spiritual Israel how
[46:55] much more spiritual people who are
[46:58] wandering in darkness there in the
[46:59] foreign field someplace hallelujah maybe
[47:02] a church or out in the world doesn't
[47:04] matter some foreign place and then God
[47:06] calls
[47:07] hallelujah they must come to me they
[47:09] must come back to their homeland
[47:11] hallelujah which is the word of God
[47:13] coming right back into their rightful
[47:14] position and me hallelujah

[47:19] Union different countries couldn't hold
[47:21] back the natural seed amen
[47:23] no spiritual power can stop amen
[47:26] God's spiritual bride hallelujah coming
[47:29] into her homeland

[50:33] mountain has to move nothing can stand
[50:35] before that man I mean that's why we've
[50:38] got to really change how we think about

[50:42] because we can get into a negative
[50:44] pattern in our minds yeah we're too

[50:49] to attain the promise you know I'm just
[50:50] too weary and life is too hard you know
[50:53] you get into a cycle of thinking that
[50:55] way I mean that's a slave mentality and
[50:58] then we're not called to think like that
[51:00] or to speak like that we're sons and
[51:02] daughters of the king I mean where God

[51:26] that's why he Knight himself with me
[51:28] hallelujah you gotta start to think like
[51:30] that
[51:30] you gotta start to think like that I
[51:33] mean because otherwise you just get your
[51:35] mind fixed on situations and things that
[51:37] are going on and and

[51:49] slave mentality I mean when they you
[51:51] know when they come in to take the land

[51:55] they were thinking about what they were
[51:57] back in Egypt but there was a Caleb and
[52:00] Joshua they were not thinking about what
[52:02] they were
[52:02] they'll think about what God had made
[52:04] them hallelujah and you're going to be
[52:06] the same way I mean we're not slaves to
[52:09] sin anymore friends we're not we're not

[52:29] never have victory
[52:30] you'll never overcome you'll never have
[52:32] peace you don't really have salvation
[52:35] you gotta you gotta say hold on hold on
[52:38] that's what you think about me but what
[52:41] does God say about me what does he say I
[52:43] am that's the only one his and it's not
[52:46] an opinion but I'm just gonna use the
[52:47] word cuz I can't think of a better one
[52:49] his opinion about me is the only thing
[52:50] that matters what he has said what is he

[56:59] people amen it's dehumanized everyone
[57:03] look at the fashion world as dehumanized
[57:05] everyone the sports world entertainment
[57:07] I mean there's no real humanity on
[57:09] display
[57:10] people are just tools and objects and
[57:12] that's what the devil wants to make of
[57:14] humanity I say he can come this far but
[57:17] no more as for me and my house will not
[57:19] be come at all amen or just some object
[57:22] hallelujah my god thinks far more of me

[57:28] never think negative saying you're
[57:31] worthless you're not worthless you may
[57:33] be the dumbest person in the class and
[57:36] the dumbest class of the dumbest school
[57:37] amen but that doesn't matter you're
[57:40] highly valued in God's eyes hallelujah
[57:43] you're very highly valued amen
[57:48] and the book of Easter we weren't we
[57:50] weren't read it but an Easter after
[57:55] after Haman has been hung and the King
[57:58] signs a new law that that the Jews can
[58:01] avenge their enemies you know they
[58:03] didn't just wipe out their enemies
[58:05] attack them once they did it like twice
[58:08] have you read that
[58:09] should we go read it if I see I'm not
[58:12] gonna read it please just read this
[58:13] again we should be on the warpath
[58:17] amen if I went real quiet I thought
[58:21] we're a peaceful people yeah love
[58:23] peaceably with all men but not with the
[58:24] devil amen
[58:27] we're not here to live peaceably with
[58:29] with him now if we read in chapter 9
[58:46] sees here now
[58:51] season verse 5 thus the Jews smite all
[58:53] their enemies with the stroke of the
[58:55] sword and slaughter and destruction and
[58:56] did what they would to those that hated
[58:58] him right and then let's go down to
[59:05] verse 13 I'm just I'm just skipping you
[59:07] can read the whole chapter the insidious
[59:09] if it please the King let it be granted
[59:12] to the juice which is in Shushan to do
[59:14] tomorrow also according unto this day's
[59:17] decree do you have it up there so so so
[59:22] they've already they've already took
[59:24] vengeance on their enemy and then it's
[59:26] to go to the king again I want to do it
[59:28] again I want to do it again and they do
[59:31] it again hallelujah don't see it all
[59:34] just for one victory I want to I want to
[59:37] give the devil a black eye every day and
[59:40] you know the best way to give him a
[59:41] black eye live a consecrated life to God
[59:44] love the Lord with all your heart soul
[59:46] and mind and strength that gives the
[59:49] devil black eye I mimicked because
[59:51] someone can be so surrender to God that
[59:53] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[59:55] them hallelujah that really you don't
[59:58] just go you know don't just go chasing
[1:00:00] Devils love the Lord with all that you
[1:00:02] are being loving worship in every moment
[1:00:06] of your life the devil can't stand that
[1:00:08] the devil cannot stand a people that
[1:00:11] that want nothing to do with his works
[1:00:15] Alleluia so now
[1:00:23] we've been awakened
[1:00:27] we've been awakened no this is just
[1:00:29] maybe a opening thing but friends were
[1:00:32] being awakened and we've been awakened
[1:00:35] to come to a position in Christ this is
[1:00:38] more than just an awakening you say well
[1:00:40] I know where we are it's more than that
[1:00:42] God wants to recognize who you are and
[1:00:44] what you are amen and many times we are
[1:00:48] in a position before we even realize it
[1:00:50] you read the book of Ephesians where
[1:00:53] where Paul starts with you know he
[1:00:57] starts with who Jesus is and then and
[1:01:00] then begins to go and how they believed
[1:01:01] and they heard the gospel they trusted
[1:01:03] and they're sealed into the kingdom he
[1:01:06] goes into chapter 2 he says you were
[1:01:08] once dead in trespasses and sins and now
[1:01:10] you've been quickened you were made
[1:01:11] alive this has already happened to them
[1:01:14] but he's now he's placing their
[1:01:15] experience this is we were Alleluia and
[1:01:19] then he goes from there and he goes
[1:01:20] through through verse B chapter 3 to
[1:01:23] chapter 4 now let's grow into the
[1:01:24] fullness of the statue of Christ and
[1:01:26] then finally ends up put on the whole
[1:01:28] armor of God I mean but he's trying to
[1:01:31] give them to see this is who you are
[1:01:32] this is what God has done for you but
[1:01:34] now let's press on to the mark of the
[1:01:36] high calling in Christ and it's got to
[1:01:39] be the same yeah the Prophet tells us
[1:01:42] we've come to another Ephesians again he
[1:01:45] says that I believe it some paradox
[1:01:47] we've come to Ephesians again but
[1:01:49] instead of aiming at and relaxing we
[1:01:51] possess the promise Alleluia and so but
[1:01:54] it's by knowing who we are and him
[1:01:56] that's how we we have to recognize what
[1:01:59] God has made us they meant we have to
[1:02:02] recognize what God has made us because
[1:02:05] that gives us power of the devil I mean
[1:02:07] brother Bram and I'll say this in
[1:02:09] closing he gives a story of a of a slave
[1:02:12] buyer that goes to a plantation and he's
[1:02:16] and he's wanting to buy slaves he looks
[1:02:17] around at all the slaves as there's an
[1:02:19] America and he sees one slave and he
[1:02:22] walks different he works different he
[1:02:24] acts different to the rest of the slaves
[1:02:26] and the slave owner says to the
[1:02:28] plantation owner I want to buy that one
[1:02:29] and the plantation owner says no he's
[1:02:32] not for sale in the slave bias is now
[1:02:34] what
[1:02:35] front about him he says well I was
[1:02:38] wondering that too and the and the and
[1:02:40] the slave by said do you feed him
[1:02:42] different no don't feed him different do
[1:02:45] you treat him different as he do
[1:02:46] different work than the others or does
[1:02:48] he sleep in a different place he sleeps
[1:02:50] in the same place well what makes him
[1:02:52] different
[1:02:53] well I begin to ask around I found out
[1:02:55] that back in Africa
[1:02:57] his dad is a king of a tribe and though
[1:03:00] he'd be far away from home and he will
[1:03:03] never go back to Africa to to to take
[1:03:06] his father's place he knows he's a king
[1:03:08] son and so he treats himself as a king
[1:03:12] son he conducts himself as a king son
[1:03:14] and that's why he's different because he
[1:03:16] knew who he was
[1:03:17] doesn't matter that he was in a in a
[1:03:20] plantation far away from his homeland he
[1:03:22] knew his royal blood in my veins I'm a
[1:03:26] king and so we operate he lived
[1:03:29] according to who he was it's got to be
[1:03:32] the same thing with us we live in the
[1:03:34] same world that everyone else lives in
[1:03:36] there's no temptation common to man that
[1:03:38] tempts you everything that comes against
[1:03:41] us comes against them Amen we live in
[1:03:43] the same economy we have all the same
[1:03:45] things that going on just like that that
[1:03:48] slave was on the same plantation as the
[1:03:49] other slaves but in you who he was and
[1:03:52] it's got to be the same thing that's
[1:03:54] what God wants you to know
[1:03:55] amen you're not just another person off
[1:03:58] the street you're one of mine you're an
[1:04:02] elected one amen you're one of my blood
[1:04:04] washed ones before the foundation of the
[1:04:07] world I mean the lamb was slain for you
[1:04:09] how Lou you I put a deposit of me and
[1:04:11] you before the foundation of the world
[1:04:13] I mean that the reason you've become
[1:04:15] awakened is because that seed has become
[1:04:17] awakened hallelujah Amen Lee once you
[1:04:20] recognize that this is not a
[1:04:21] fly-by-night I'll try this and I'll try
[1:04:24] that and see how it works
[1:04:25] that's not what this message is this is
[1:04:27] God this is God moving over the earth
[1:04:30] brooding over the earth to find his
[1:04:32] elected ones
[1:04:33] hallelujah just like Genesis one the
[1:04:38] world was out formal void darkness
[1:04:39] covered the face of the deep in the
[1:04:41] Spirit of God moved upon the waters he
[1:04:44] had a purpose of moving I have seed in
[1:04:46] this earth I wanted to come forth
[1:04:49] hallelujah and you were covered in
[1:04:51] darkness you are that form you just like
[1:04:53] the world and he began to brood over you
[1:04:56] I'll Lou your child of mine if we're
[1:04:59] gonna separate light from darkness
[1:05:01] separate things out of your life
[1:05:03] holy just like Abraham was separated
[1:05:05] from things and you begin to find
[1:05:07] yourself it's a life that comes forth
[1:05:10] hallelujah you didn't even know was
[1:05:12] there
[1:05:12] who knew that they were a child of god
[1:05:14] when they were little Alton's you know
[1:05:16] maybe while I was raising you John you
[1:05:18] but no but who really knew I don't know
[1:05:21] but something in me brothers is it that
[1:05:24] that seed is crying for expression and
[1:05:26] you may not do it's a deep calling to
[1:05:28] the deep you may not understand what is
[1:05:30] this thing why am I not happy in the
[1:05:33] world or all footing in them places it's
[1:05:36] because there's that seed there and it's
[1:05:38] calling out and then eventually the
[1:05:41] Spirit of God comes and broods over your
[1:05:42] life am I gonna find out this this
[1:05:45] sounds like home to me this is where I
[1:05:47] really belong hallelujah amen amen
[1:05:51] and that's God's election amen
[1:05:54] he has a purpose he doesn't just it's
[1:05:58] just like when he died on Calvary he
[1:06:00] died for the sins of the world but he
[1:06:01] didn't hang up there saying well I hope
[1:06:03] some people feel sympathetic and they'll
[1:06:05] follow me later no he knew who who would
[1:06:08] serve him he knew who would who would
[1:06:10] believe him and he knew who he would
[1:06:12] reveal it to that he really did die for
[1:06:14] them hallelujah amen when I was on the
[1:06:18] cross I mean when he was on the cross I
[1:06:19] was on his mind
