amen good morning everyone it's just just a quick announcement we're gonna have Church lunch at the community center Nick's Sunday or the 18th and we're gonna have the AGM either there if we have time or back here so after lunch next next weekend amen so let's just take our Bibles shall we and we'll go to 2nd chronicles chapter 34 and we're going to read also from the book of Corinthians as well let's just go to 2nd chronicles in chapter 34 and we're gonna read from verses 15 to 30 I'm sorry it's a bit of a long well I'll be standing longer than you but um you know but I want you to get this my so let's just read this and then we'll get into what the Lord has placed on my heart today so syncing chronicles 34 and it says this here from verse 15 so just a background before you read so King Josiah there's a righteous King he's already driven out much of the idol worship in Israel he has commanded that the temple would be repaired and as they have been repairing the temple they found a book of the law so they found the Bible they didn't even have a Bible and they found it and then they begin to read it and so it's amazing when when revival revival takes place the word comes back into into preeminence and so and it said in and so this is from verse 15 so this is where we are in the story but I encourage you go read the whole chapter and season and hilkiah answered and said to SEF and the scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord and hilkiah delivered the law the book to chuffing forgive me if I've pronounced he's all prolly differently and chuffing carried the book to the king and brought the king word again saying as it was committed to to thy servants they do it's that's that's repairing the temple and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workman hold on is it all then in sefferman the scribe told the king saying he'll kayo the priest has given me a book and Stefan read it before the king and it came to pass when the King had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes and the king commanded he'll cure and hikin the son of seven and abdon the son of mica and seven the scribe and a messiah a servant of the king saying go inquire of the Lord for me and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great as the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord to do after all that is written in this book and he'll kaya and they that the King had appointed went to holder the prophetess the wife of Shalom the son of silk the son of Esther oh the keeper of the Wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem and the college and they spake to her to that effect and she answered them and thus saith the Lord God of Israel tell you the man that sent you to me thus saith the LORD behold I'll bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah because they have forsaken me and have been and sits unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the words of their works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and it shall not be quenched and as for the king of Judah who sent me to inquire of the Lord so shall you sound to him thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the world which thou hood because thine heart was tender this is very important and now Dennis humble thyself before God when thou Harris to his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humblest thyself before me and that it's not written and it's written I close and weep before me I've even heard thee also saith the Lord behold all gather near thy father's and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave and peace neither shall they and I see all the evil that I have I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the word the King word again that the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem now notice he doesn't just sit back and say well I'll be gathered in peace i watch the world go by notice what he does and the king went into all the house I went up into the house of the Lord and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the Lord and the king stood at his place and made a covenant before the Lord to walk but after the Lord and to keep his Commandments and his testimonies any statutes with all his heart and with all the soul to prefer to preform the words of the Covenant which is written in this book and he caused all who were president Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to do it and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God the God of their fathers and Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the country there pertained to the children of Israel and made all that were president Israel to serve even to serve the Lord their God and all his days they departed not from following the Lord the god of their fathers hallelujah now let's go to let's go to 2nd Corinthians 5 I'm going to read verses 9 to 15 synchronous 5 9 to 15 is wherefore we labour that we're the prisoner absent we may be accepted of him for we must for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in this body in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and Trust also are made manifest in your consciences now if any man build upon the foundation weight sorry if I got that twice oh wait it's just in the wrong order sorry now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver no forgive me 1 Corinthians 3 okay we'll just leave it there sorry about that you may all have your seats we'll get me to that later now if I want to entitle this something I want to speak a subject not on my watch I trust this is all your heart's desire by the end of the service now we read here about Joe siren and if you read the story of Josiah he was a righteous King he walked before the Lord in all of his ways before the account we just read he had already begun to drive all of the take the idols out of his rally early begin to purge the high places and these different things and when and and then he commanded the people to to repair the temple and they they found the book of the law and the temple amazing they had no Bible I mean but they found the Bible the word came back and so now it was read before the king and we see that he was he was he rent his clothes because he knew that God was a God of his word so all of the curses and all the blessings that were written amen in the Old Testament they were going to apply and he knew because the nation had been wicked they had there save God's wrath and nothing could ultimately turn it from happening but we see here that God God spoke through a prophetess saying that yes this will happen but not in your days but we see that he did not just sit back and say well I'm going to go to the grave and peace all's fine whatever will be will be you know let's stop being so Calvinistic Calvinistic is if we're previously we'll be there if we're not we won't you know yo won't worry about it God's looking for you to pick up a burden God is looking for you to say what will you do what are you what are you going to purpose in your heart to do are you gonna watch the world go by float down the stream like some dead fish floating or are you going to swim against the tide I meant to swim and run this race what are you going to do and so now he so after he heard that he wearied he preached all the abominations he finished purging all the abominations out of Israel and he brought the people and he and he had the words spoken to them and he caused them to enter into a covenant with God because he would have purpose in my heart this is my heaven but but not on my watch if I have anything to do with it it will not happen and the next generation it will not happen there either we understand that there's a Great Tribulation coming we know that there is a great apostasy amen already upon the earth but we should purpose in our hearts not on my watch I'm not going to let this lukewarm lady I see in just a little bit of emotion sometimes come to church sometimes just a half haphazard kind of walk I'm not gonna let that affect me not on my watch not while I have life in this body I'm not going to just let it affect me and watch the world go by we have one life to live friends one life to give so I wouldn't just sit back I'd say Here I am Lord Alleluia you know the zeal of the sages to repent you read the latest in church age the letter the zeal of the ages to repeat hallelujah to turn from wickedness and serve God not in a lukewarm or lukewarm way where people just have a little bit of emotion we have a nice little time there's no victory in the camp we're just walking on like waster that's not what God has called us to have God has called us to have victory unto victory hallelujah so we read here and first Corinthian and sick in Corinthians 5 if we can find us again we shall all appear before the judgment seat of Christ this is not the white throne judgment this is not the white throne judgment you read in the book of Daniel you read in the New Testament as well the bride does not go to the white throne judgment in the Book of Daniel it says that he saw a vision and there was and there was thousands ministered unto Him God Himself standing in the judgment within thousands times thirteen thousand stood before him that's a great white throne judgment there and so the bride is judging judging with Christ Paul says no you know that the Saints shall judge the earth and so when do they do that they are they are standing in the judgment seat with God himself so we do not go to the great white throne judgment Amen it says and John he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me shall not go to the condemnation but is passed but has everlasting life and has passed from death to life so that condemnation is the judgment so the bride receives heareth hears his word his his god's voice to this age which is the message of Malachi 4 they hear that word it changes them it changes their heart from unbelief to faith hallelujah and it says you have everlasting life now and you shall not go to the condemnation the judgment the bride is not sitting there in the white throne judgment I mean as in being judged she judges with Christ well so we all have that firmly cemented in our minds right so now Paul is saying well then we'll what is the judgment seat of Christ this is a this is a judgment that you receive rewards for what you have done in your body you receive rewards we all receive you can't lose eternal life but you receive rewards for what you do for him this is not talking about salvation salvation is already sorted I trust it has in your life I mean this is not about if you go on the rapture Oh mr. rapture if you become one with this word here everything everything he tells you to do if you become one with this more than just baptism I mean how we dress modest apparel uncut here forces as a protection amen how we conduct ourselves all those things you become one with it if you become one with it you become one with him you can't you can't you can't receive Jesus Christ as personal Savior and rejecters word because he and it's word are one they're not two people they're not two different things his word and him are the same so you can trust see how I received him but in your rejecters word you turning him down amen the proof you have received it was saviors receive His Word you made that he say that's awful strong in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the word whilst God the word became flesh and dwelt among us amen we don't want to turn down his word we will be judged according to what we did in our flesh and it's for rewards now this got a little further he says this in 1st Corinthians 3 and 9 for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as the wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he builds thereupon for our foundation can no man lay that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones hey a wood hay stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every shall shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he has built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire this is the judgment seat of Christ what are you building what are you building in your Christian life what are you doing every man has to get we shall all appear before the judgment seat of Christ and we'll have to give an account for our Christian walk this is not I'm not talking about salvation here do we all understand this this is not like we're in peril will we go to hear it or not if God has really became real to you and you're manifesting his word then you'll you've become one with him then you have to go okay I trust I don't I don't want to let you to color in any spaces today this is the judgment seat of Christ we all must appear before so you got to look at now what am i doing you say well it doesn't matter what my walk is it's personal between me and God you'll walk or fix the whole church you'll walk affects the whole body of Christ what you do and your conduct and how you treat each other and how you live affects the whole body of Christ it affects the whole body of Christ if one member suffers or one member is living in sin and unbelief it affects the whole body if one member has a spirit of rebellion it affects the whole body and we're gonna do it but a reading I want to show this now this is the story oops we're gonna read this where's it take support let's try this again god bless brother Ian yeah anyway we're gonna read about the story here we are yes thank you why does that go oh yeah no no that's actually my fault yeah my tablet died and I gotta go old school anyway for each so brother Brown speaking about Aiken who knows the story of Aiken they cross Jordan they take they take they take Jericho they gotta come against AI but but as they're taking the spoils out of out of Jericho one man gets selfish and he hides a Babylonian government in a wedge of gold because he's not looking he's looking for just natural rewards instead of walking in the light of God's Word now I'm going to show you this in the New Testament as well because people say oh that's Old Testament that's under the Lord God's full of grace he is full of grace but he but he doesn't just let you get by he's not a doting granddad that that you know if you really love someone you are not indifferent to how they feel you are not indifferent if you really love that person you care how your conduct a conduct and what you say affects them as in their right you really care above all things you'll rearrange your life you'll change what you do because you're concerned I love them I want to show my love and what I do and how I treat them and where I go and what I say isn't that that's just natural how much more God Himself we made all things who shed his blood upon the earth polina take us to heaven how much more our Redeemer hallelujah amen friends how God is amazing how God is incredible hello ezel powerful he's almighty amen he separated us out of the world he called us out of Egypt He shed his blood Amen we are his precious possession we belong to him so why go why go living with the devil when you say you belong to him no adulterer will see heaven the Bible says there's a power in this room to set you free if you want to be free that's I can shout like this because I know it may sound a bit heavy but he's here to set free and why just get a little bit emotional get wounded and walk out the same way your a purpose in your heart I want to serve you god I don't care what it costs me I'm going to serve you I don't care if everyone leaves me Jesus himself said unless you hate father mother brother sister whatever you cannot be my disciple but my family who are you living who's your god my family is not my god I love them with everything within me they are not my god they are they can not do anything for me for this next world amen are you willing you got to be willing to forsake all is it worth it brother Isaac was saying these things here are just nothing what's this work gonna be smoke bombs and craters hallelujah doesn't put you tree down here so we've got to live in whatever more and jobs and take care of family but don't put your tent stakes down too far hallelujah now here we are each now the land was provided so this is when they're going into the Promised Land the land was provided and divvied up by inspiration and each one I could take the scripture and show it to you exactly and he put them in the place with our supposed to be positionally how that the turn to half tribes was to stay across the river how was their mothers cried that in their birth and how at how it placed each one worse mean to be in the land and now after you're in that don't mean you're free from war after you're in Christ doesn't mean you're free from war Amen you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on where the battle friends this is not a picnic this is not a church lunch this is a battle we're gonna fight for every inch of ground what are you gonna need you to shrink back and hide in your bunker watch the world go by are you going to church both ever belongs to me I want it you gonna do with the sword do you have confidence in your weapon now you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on see Kanan did not represent the Great heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and Fighting's and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk this is you me but they will call the church after they were called out of Egypt Israel was the Church of God it's a perfect walk that's where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed have you ever thought about this ah but it's my walk and they've got nothing no your account we are accountable to each other do you know we're accountable to each other amen if we are living if we are living in unbelief and we're and we're living in sin and all these that we're accountable we're not just accountable to God were accountable to each other do you know that your own behavior could knock someone else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you believers can cause this church to birdly fail you believe us your conduct your unconfessed sentence your misbehavior can cause this church to bitterly fail amen I could leave it right there I've seen it I've seen other churches around and they have Bentley failed because of this they have all wearing the bride we got the message we're going in a rapture now we know that I mean from these things we're not I mean from these things this is not a picnic this is not a picnic friends and on the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother branham well that's the truth think of it Joshua after he crossed over into the land God gave him the promise just think to fight an entire campaign without losing a man without even getting a scratch without having to have a nurse or a first-aid or a band I think it means band-aid amen God said the land is yours go fight think of fighting a campaign there's no Red Cross around at all there's nobody going to get hurt and they slayed the Emirates and the Hittites but it wasn't one hurt among any of them until sin came into the camp and when a kentuc the Babylonian Gulman and their gold wedge and hid it under his camp then the next day they lost 16 men Joshua said stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call the seven days of fast God made us a promise that there nothing will hurt us our enemy will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere cause we've got 16 dead men laying here there is like brothers and they did now whatever you do do me a favor put your pitchfork down put it down do not think this is for someone else oh I hope that person gets it you you stop that right now because the devil will allow you to go like this and you could be the one with that spirit that's causing the problem and you'll mess your deliverance I did not enjoy coming here this morning to speak this to you I'll be real honest I haven't been happy about it but here we are we've got to take this we're gonna take our gloves off we're not we're not we're not toddlers we're to look it in the face and we're gonna say lord help us we don't want to bid ly fail amen no one who wants to bid ly fail here put your hand up no I want to go to heaven victorious and they did why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of the line you see you see you see reason this needs to be taught the church lining up lining up with the Word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not have done took the life of 60 mean I think it was 16 maybe more I believe it was 16 that was dead Joshua said there's something wrong God made the promise and something's wrong when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise he's got to stick to that promise and he'll do it amen we're gonna get to the New Testament soon but I'm just gonna keep going a bit more with this he says and you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe this is from crisis of mystery of God revealed you've got tapes on discipline in the church how to behave yourself in the Church of God how we've got to come to here together and sit in heavenly places don't stay don't stay home if God's in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers why does it why can you hardly wait to get in the door to fellowship with your brothers and sisters amen if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to praying because we're in the last days with a Bible exalted or exhorted us much more as we see that they approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to ensue to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples when you love one from another that's right stay right together if brother you think he's a little wrong or the sisters say Lord don't let me never have a root of bitterness springing up because it'll affect him it'll take the Christ Road right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you and it'll run them from the Tabernacle here and I see it amen and it'll kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your posture and it does and it does it does it does I never understood this until recently it does hurt us it'll do everything see don't do that you just wax that much closer together drawer up take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision see that buckles the whole armor of God just put it on tight tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one of the say nice things about one another then God will bless you now it says here about how the malice now when I'm reading all these things think about we shall all appear before the judgment seat of Christ we will give an account and there'll be you'll have to if you are packing these things you'll have to give an answer one day and you won't be able to hide it with with a with a veneer of a liar or twisting the truth a little bit you'll be fully exposed before Jesus Christ you won't have one place to hide and he'll ask you why did you build this wood hay and stubble of malice malice is an evil intent towards someone how you treat someone Envy strife goodness and forgiveness why did you build that why did you cause cliques to form in the church why did you cause church splits why did you cause the love to go from sum why did you why did you allow this to happen you have to give an account you have to give an account and it won't be actually over this person no it's all remember when you point a finger at someone there's three pointing back at you Jesus tells us in a parable why take the little twig basically out of your brother's eye when you go to hole beam in your own take that out first take that out first and then you can help your brother amen why do we waste worries pointed someone else are there the problem there the problem well how about you how about you you're to look in the mirror of God's Word and say God is at me you honestly have to this is not about what they do Jesus hang on Calvary he said Father forgive them they don't know what they do he did not say I crush you bunch of people you hypocrites how dare you do this some I have a right to be angry he didn't do that he said Father forgive them he didn't lead any rule of goodness coming to him he all the rejection he came to his own his own received him not he did not hold it against them and we will take some pity little thing and it will become an idol in our life and our whole Christian walk well because someone said this to me or or someone did this to me and I'm jealous of this person and I resent this person or because maybe they're living a holier life than you and it will become our whole Christian walk and that's wood hay and stubble and Jesus will ask you why did you build that why did you allow it to be built why did you why did you make this thing why did you allow this thing to grieve my spirit away from a group of my children it says in the Bible Ephesians 4 and 30 greevey not the Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption you can grieve them away you can't grieve them away and you'll be asked why did you grieve me I died on Calvary to walk with you but because of your attitude and your unforgiveness and your resentment I could not walk with you like I wanted to walk oh but where predestinated what have you purposed in your heart to do many people they leaned on predestination and they're still living in unbelief what do you have a free will as for me and my house we will serve the Lord as for me in my house that's a decision you're going to make that decision sorry watch out churches a few years ago when we had the old-fashioned holiness churches it's still old-fashioned holiness where they stood for God and righteousness when woman dressed and acted like ladies men dressed and acted like men when people went out at the church on Sunday morning when they had all-night prayer meetings when they had the old fashioned type they had a real revival God blessed he cut off every enemy before them they were journeying on but when the wage of making God in the camp with nothing left but destruction he says we're on our word God on our Road God keeps his word the testing time come the testing time come for the Lutheran Church the testing time came for the Methodist Church the testing time come for the Pentecostal church it comes for every Church it comes for every person the testing time the testing time what are you gonna do are you gonna be an akin and cause the whole campaign to cease are you gonna be an akin or are you gonna really be in harmony with God's Word you say well I have rights I had rights too but I became a love prisoner to Jesus Christ I don't have any rights well I have a right to to to wear shorts and cut my hair and drink and smoke and whatever more I had rights to brother Brown was in South Africa there's a photo of him in the Kruger National Park in a safari suit who's seen it in shorts in' and and and socks his daughter who who showed the slideshow said that was a 1950 and the brothers talked them into putting it on now and that we you all know what happened to him in 1950 when he went to South Africa God told him to have meetings in certain places but because of the influences of the ministry of man he listened to man instead of God and he suffered terribly for it amen he suffered for that trip and we will take that and use it as an excuse say well he did it people as oppression look we're out here in the Kruger we're just brothers around put this on it'll be funny he was taught she she'd Rebecca bread Smith said he was talked into putting it on and that trip didn't go so well for him because of human influence are you all following what I'm saying they meant I had a right to do those things god convicted me before I even heard it you're naked aye aye I threw them out the Spirit of God should convict you of sin jesus said the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit should convict you of sin if it's really there it will and so now that campaign didn't go very well from he came home with a knee buzz he was very sick at all these things because he listened to man instead of God he suffered for that as a lesson we have to look at that and say well if that didn't go so well for him because he listened to man and I'll just do this because we're here and it's you know what about you that's what she said about it I don't care what other people make of it that's what his daughter see that actually showed the photo the testing time now remember okay he says he I don't know why this is not here but anyway he says the testing time come the testing time comes I read that and there's only one way wait maybe that's still there forgive me I'm still getting used to this and there's only one way only one way you can ever know that you're right stay with God's eternal blueprint stay with the word what God says that's right don't take nothing less or nothing more why should we take a substitute for this that and the other when God's Word is full of promises yes sir we don't have to take any substitutes this is the truth God keeps his word don't matter how unreasonable it may seem God keeps his word anyhow he certainly did stay with God's blueprint you'll get the results the Brut blueprint said it would give now remember that in this promised land that don't mean you're immune from sickness that don't mean you are immune from troubles but it does spell this or let the sink deep it says this that it's yours amen everything in Jesus Christ is ours our promised land just rise up and take it see and remember the only way that Israel ever lost a man as we in sin God in the camp there's only one way we could ever lose a victory is for sin to get in the camp something wrong somewhere when I can stall that wage and that Babylonian garments sin was in the camp and the battle went wrong you give me this church tonight this group of people perfectly perfectly in the promise of God with the Holy Ghost walking in the spirit I challenge any disease or any affliction or anything that there is every Joe Lewis that's in the country with all this infidelity and all the unbelievers that there is to bring any sickness or affliction in the store and we'll walk out here perfectly whole yes sir God gave the promise only sin of unbelief can keep it away now we've got to get down to what are this little sinners and we know sinners unbelief they say well that's all Old Testament this is in the book of Corinthians we all know the Corinthians were a group of believers I mean they were believers they were the bride in the first age they were part of the bride in the first age brother Bram tells us he said that another book of Acts is being written in this endtime another book of X now that's just not healings and miracles and prophecy inversions the book of Acts the Corinthian church was birthed out of the book of Acts the Galatian church was birthed out of the book of Acts the Ephesian Church the Thessalonica Church they all came with birth during the book of Acts period so these groups of believers were birthed into the kingdom during another during a book of X being written and now if there's another book of Acts being written in the end time then these other these groups will rise again amen do you understand history repeats itself if we're living in a book of X time these people will come these churches the conditions you see in the Galatian Church the Ephesian Church the Thessalonians like a church the Corinthian church all of those will be back here again amen because we're living in a book of Acts time you've got to understand this because that's why you can look around and say why are these people like this why are these people like this why these people like this and if you don't have understanding of the scripts you'll be confused but if you can see now this the book of Acts was the blueprint it's being repeated again what it was in the beginning is at the end but remember the Galatians were believers the Corinthians were believers the Ephesians were believers the church at Thessalonica was believers were they not they weren't they weren't unbelievers they were real believers they just had to grow they were influenced by certain spirits but I believe God brought them back amen he says it's commonly reported that there is fornication among us as sin in the camp this is in the New Testament it's commonly reported this fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among Gentiles that one one should take us for others wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you fry really as absent in the body but present in spirit have judged already and though I were present concern that has so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such as one under Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus your glorifying is not good no you're not that a little leaven living the whole lump we know yeast yeast is living you put yeast into a dough it changes the whole nature of the dog it doesn't just it doesn't just raise a little bit of dough in other bits flat it spreads through the whole dough it changes the chemical composition of the dough it changes what the bread is like at the end a little leaven leavens the whole lump that's why I say we are accountable one to another we are accountable because what you may be doing is affecting all of us Amen we are accountable a little leaven leavens the whole lump it will change our churches look at these Corinthians they lost their vision they begin to fight among themselves I'm of Paul I'm of a polis I'm of Cephas I'm of Christ I mean I'm of these different ministries in Christ well maybe I just stream righteous listen to tapes they were all gathering around these ministries and all the ministries with God given by the they became carnal their account of people they allowed this said when Paul says it's commonly reported among you that this fornication obviously it wasn't a secret thing it became : common knowledge amen so was just allowed to sit there and it changed the whole thinking of the church now there are fussing among each other there was divisions there was cliques you know they were all gathering around different ministries everyone had a psalm or a horse your song were a word of knowledge or something to say it they're all puffed up but yet they are believers or because the sin it was another akin in the camp they mean and there'll be question asked to this fellow who did this we know in the second book he repeats and he's he's back in the church but if he did not repent the big question why why did you build this Wood hay and stubble why did you allow this to happen why'd you step beyond the word when the word says you shall not do this why did you do it and he left to give an account see see that - it basically turned him over to Satan that his spirit will be saved but his flesh would be destroyed so it doesn't mean that he'd lose his salvation he'll be taken but he will be saved but his body will be destroyed right so he will still but he had to give an account she's purged therefore out the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ our Passover sacrifice for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth maybe that's what he's saying don't don't keep the malice don't keep the old old ways but serve the Lord I mean with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen it's one now what a great leader Joshua become never losing a battle at least something went wrong in the church when a kentucker which it wasn't Joshua's shape faith that did it it was he took a Babylonian garment in a wedge of gold out of the camp and when he did it hindered the whole battle one member suffers all members suffer suffers what God is coming to one of these days brothers a church without spot or wrinkle he's coming to a spirit-filled Church that divinely love of God so welded their hearts together that they'll walk as one amen one member suffers all the members suffer now I want to go back to I want to go back to this scripture here and that we read very early on the peace we all must give an account because I'm going to come to it but we all must give an account for what we what we build we almost give an account if it's gold or hay wood and stubble because the fire god is going to prove out prove our works well we've done in this flesh before the judgment seat of Christ now that's why you've got to look at now you see you know I'll come to a reason why do you want a labor labor in this body that you'll get a reward that's because well let's just go to it real quickly but it season it season revelations chapter four there are four and twenty elders around the throne and it says now that they cast their crowns before the throne now these four and twenty elders they represent the older New Testament believers they represent you and they have been given crowns because of their service upon the earth and they cast it before him they say thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for all thy pleasure they are and were created so here's now here's a would they receive a reward now they have something to give back to him like why do you like what do you say it's so important to build the right things and to enter you know and to look for a reward I want something to give back to him I want something to give back to him you understand I want something to light a street I mean what you you gave it all for me I gave it all for you hallelujah I labored not that I was looking for maybe how big it was i I serve them because I love them and just to be there will make me happy will make me very it'll make it worth it all but I want something to lay at his feet I mean I want something say Lord here it is here's my life I gave for you here's my life I lived for you hallelujah I want something to lay and don't you want that too don't you want something to present back to him I mean that you won't just add a you know a deathbed confession which those are ok cuz they'll be there but I want to be morally as a did did confession I want something I will turn to later sweet because he is worthy he is worthy of all of our time he's worthy of all about love he's worthy of everything we are all of our energy don't you want something oh but I'm gonna be there it doesn't matter I want something to lay at his feet I want to say Lord there's a reason it was you died for me I mean there's a reason you saved me and I wanted to live out that reason it's not just a sit at a seat at the winning supper of the Lamb I mean but we we he redeems us in this life for a reason amen and brother Graham says that the souls that that people saved like for example if someone see it out as a missionary and souls come into the kingdom the church that sins that missionary out will be attached with those souls for all of eternity amen there your name you could be associated with someone else coming in hallelujah isn't that worth it there are people you say well the bride will be the we turn it a little predestinated yeah but God has hands and feet upon the earth what are we living for what are we striving for amen what are we building I mean when we need pity jealousy and insecurity amen affect others and damage people and God will say why did you build that why did you laugh do you know there's been this is true and in America and misses churches there's been church splits over the color of the carpet when they renovate the building there's been church splits over carpet color and those people who had to stand there on that day and the Lord will say why did you why did you cause the work of God to fragment and split and pain and anguish and hurt and resentment and and wounds that took a long time to heal effectively that church became you know became like it went into the ditch for a season because when there's hurt and pain you can't run hey if I've got a stitch I can't run as fast as I can without the stitch if there's blood pouring out of my leg I can't sprint I'm wounded I being paradis yeah if my leg is broken you won't see me during the hundred they say hold on let this get better and so now not just individuals but whole groups are still in Estill in and plaster still wounded because someone in their pettiness said no I'm not gonna stand for this out of pettiness and jealousy in so little things and they caused a church to be basically in the ditch for a while and it had to get fixed and repaired how we treat each other I want this to really sink real deep how we treat each other well that person said something you know love is corrective do you know love is corrective if I didn't love my girls I mean if I love them all correct them well this is like a kid majid if my builders run out onto the street I love you girls have fun I want you to be happy I want you to enjoy your day they're on the street they're gonna die statistically speaking someone's gonna hit them oh but I left them so much and God will say you're a steward over those girls your steward over them I placed that not yours they are given to you for a season to race yeah and he'll say why did you let them go because I loved him I want them to be happy and he'll say no you don't you didn't love them you didn't care for them you didn't Creek them in their era amen and people can come to us and you say hey brother sister what about this what about this and people say oh they don't love me they do love you I mean if someone came to me with description see brother have you considered this in your life I'd say thank you that means you care about me that means you want me to be victorious that means you want me to overcome I mean that means you want me to make it I mean that doesn't mean you want to put me down in a hole and say you'll never make no you want to lift me up we have blind spots so we're not we have blind spots and we think we're all peachy and everything's wonderful we're blind spots you know there's a there's a method of of mastering sheep if you're if you're going up through trees and stuff where where where the view is obscured you know there'll be people coming from different angles because I maybe look at the forest this way and they may be a dozen sheep I can't see so someone will come this way but they're there in my blind spot do you understand there are my blind spot I can't see them so so another ship it will come around this way and he'll see them as though they're over there and I'm if I'm pity and I'm prep full of pride I'll look at him and say I'm a shepherd I've been here longer than you I've been here shorter than you I'm better at this what are you talk about I can't see them and they'll remain there because they're in my blind spot but if I'm humble if I am humble to the word and I know that that person actually has my best interest in mind irrespective of how they say it I'll actually say thank you I'll go get those sheep I did not see them your help we're helping each other amen we want something to give them I don't want honestly friends you want to stand there on that day and God you have to give an account why did you treat your brother and sister that way why did you speak evil of them why did you murder their their i what he call it the influence why did you murder their influence to others when they are the one that God we all have a gift we're all here for one another we're all here to help one another but if you put it someone in a box and label them a certain way and you tell if I know this is how they are what's happened you've basically tied up their mouth tied up their hands thrown them in a closet thrown them into prison because the influence has now been killed and that one influence could have could have helped many people but because of our own it's such a pity thing I use that word penis there's such a pity thing that we would allow our humanity and our pride to get in the way of what God wants to do he sees this here we're going back I want something to lay at his feet don't you now surely he says here wait spiritual adoption yeah and here is the point I want to drive home may the Holy Spirit take it to every heart of you believers just because you're a believer certainly you are you have everlasting life God said so but would you want to get in as job said by the skin of your teeth would you just want to come before the father and the talent he has given every one of you as being negligent you didn't you just didn't use it or you let something else stand in your way you let petty things that meant nothing to you after all little fascist Jews and arguments and church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life would you stand would you want to stand before the father like that I don't believe you would I don't believe you would do that neither would I now I want him to say it was well done not by the skin of my teeth but it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of Lord for you did well with what you have to do he says maybe you're a housewife if you are God made you a teacher of your children do a good job out of it regardless of what you have to do do it well now wives you will not be accountable for your husband's actions on that day because the husband is the head of the house you will not be accountable for what he does you will not be accountable for how he how he treated the word has attitude towards this entire message in this time you you will not be held accountable for what he does but you'll be accountable for your children and what they and what they do you will be accountable for how they are raised you will be accountable you restored over those kids I look at them and I say Lord they are your daughters they are yours you purchase their salvation on Calvary you sent a load to the Prophet that they would go in a rapture Amen you send this message that they would become one with you in the same time they're your property they are not my property and I'll be given I'll have to I'll have to give an account what did you do with those girls oh why did you let them on the road because I loved him no you didn't love them you were not you didn't because if you really love them you would have corrected them amen but they are I'm assured of them but your mum's will be accountable for your children that's why it's so important you've gotta set it in your hearts gathering as it as a group of believers should be the most important thing in the week not just a Sunday amen we will I want to teach my kids we go to church you say well they'll fall asleep I'd rather than fall asleep in the prisons of God amen they're not I'd rather them asleep where God is moving people being delivered hallelujah people agree filled with the spirit I'd rather them asleep in that kind of atmosphere I mean then not in that atmosphere amen we need to teach them this is what we should it's important you say but but God is with me at home but he's greater where two or three gathered you say well there's three of us in the house when more of God comes together brother ham says that the fullness of the Godhead bodily is now on the church amen there's more of God here then you just by yourself or you and your family by yourself amen it's important you say but it's you but but you say but it's just this just works I'd say I want to be like Josiah on my watch hey this world may go into a tribulation and there will be a generation where God is no longer known but not on my watch there will be a generation in this message where it's just a club I mean there will be people who are just a cultural message believer that do not know God not on my watch not on my watch friends the elders that were with Joshua says in the book of Judges that after those elders died then Israel turned to idols not on my watch you say but they still believe deals Jehovah God and and and and if you ask them well did Moses really deliver you and did all those things happen that's absolutely but they turn to idols because it was to the generation that was with Joshua after the generation that was with the pillar of fire then they turn to idols and I'd say they say not on my watch what are you gonna do I just want I don't I want you to purpose in your heart not on my watch I mean not while I have life in my body there's gonna be a witness upon the earth it may just be one Here I am at Meyer's well be me what are you building husband's you will be responsible for your wives and how they dress and the things they do and how your family is but let me tell you this it's not proud beating the man it's not making them conform and as you pray and God comes down into your house and the atmosphere of God will change them I met the husband is the priest of the home they're the conduit you say but my wife knows God yeah but you're in your a you have an office of being the priest of the home I mean the priest was the conduit for God to come down amen you have an office to stand in but I'm busy forget the busyness what are you rearranging your life around I mentioned so I've said it before I'm we've all laughed but imagine someone who's going to run the hundred of the Olympics and it's maybe two years out and they've already qualified and they're sitting on the couch eating pizza watching the world go by and they tell you I believe I'm gonna win I really believe I'm gonna get there oh I'm gonna stand on the podium and you would look at them and say you don't believe that you don't believe you're gonna win your life is proving you're not gonna win how can you expect to win and you're eating pizza on the catch you're not even running where's your running shoes I don't know but I'm gonna win hallelujah it may sound ridiculous but it's how some of us are we're sitting on the couch doing nothing ah but I'm busy what's important friends do you know what gives people motivation if they're going to win a gold they have the stats from previous runs I'm in striking distance it is just to get on the podium I'm in striking distance we get to get a bronze or get a silver and a motivate semen probably they put more energy in an effort how much more friends we've got some stats we've got some stats friends and it says he's gonna win it says you're going to get a rap show how the law says you're going to overcome should they give us motivation should it really put some energy in us and some some zeal sure it does me when I sit down and count your blessings name them one by one we have been injured with power from on high I mean to manifest this would in the same time how their to be united with Jesus Christ can your blessings name them ton by tongue you'll be accountable but it's hell when God comes down you got to pray God comes down changes them that's how you get them that's how you get them into position I mean cuz just only conformity and enforcing people it doesn't work it's got to be from here sure you light before them say honey what about this and what about this we really want to serve God don't we really want to serve them it'll be worse at all when we see Jesus won't it be worth it all Lord and he'll say father they stood for me I'll stand for them hallelujah you understand it'll be worth it it's not are you just getting emotional it will be worth it we have no regrets if you ran this with all your energy and you just kind of fall into heaven you know because you're given all you know someone who's running the hundred and they're totally expired by the time they cross that line they've given it at all and we should be that same kind of way we gave it all for him not to get salvation this is not what I've been talking about I said I want something to lay at his feet amen you'll be accountable for your families children you'll be accountable for the influence you have on others you will be accountable for how you influence others in the church and the little ones look up to the older ones they stand in awe I've seen some of the brothers mainly boys here they stand in awe of the older ones and they look at them saying I want to be they don't say it out loud but you can see it in their faces I want to be like him and the older ones you will give an account what influence did you put on the younger ones we all have to give an account amen we'll just finish with this for God has not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which he have showed towards his name and that ye have ministered to the Saints and do minister that's not just preaching we minister to one another amen if you desire that every one of you shall show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience and here at the promises amen Caesar look and now shall be pleased for they cannot recompense thee but thou shalt be recompense at the resurrection of the just des rewards to be handed out these rewards to be handed out what are you gonna do you we all have to give an account just as this we are all going to stand before the judgment seat of Christ and we are we will give an account as we were in out in the scripture you will give an account for the works you did in this body amen shall we have some musicians please I want you to think about it this morning not
