[32:29] the scripture, turn to Psalms
[32:33] 51 and and five. I just read off here.
[32:38] Amen. And it says here, "Behold, I was
[32:40] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[32:44] mother conceive me." Amen. So, we're all
[32:48] shapen in iniquity. Amen. And we were we
[32:50] were born with a a fallen nature. Amen.
[32:53] God bless you. May have your seats.
[32:55] I mean, I I feel such a nice atmosphere
[32:58] in here. It's so warm and just nice.
[33:00] Amen. You know, I I was in the bush. I
[33:03] walked into the bush on Friday to go for
[33:05] a hunt. Stayed overnight. And I got back
[33:08] up at 4 in the morning and by 5 in the
[33:10] morning, I was walking. And where I was
[33:12] going, I was going sort of along this
[33:14] this sort of a a ridge, big long ridge
[33:17] shaped like a U. And um it was there was
[33:20] one spot that I had to sort of um walk
[33:24] beside someone's boundary like it was a
[33:26] little bit of private land.
[33:29] And anyways, I was walking and I'd sort
[33:30] of passed that and it was just getting
[33:32] just starting to break break some
[33:34] daylight. And um and then in 50 mters
[33:37] from me, I saw what I thought was a
[33:40] someone shining a torch, you know. I was
[33:41] like, "Oh my, these people are someone's
[33:43] deer hunting here." And when they're
[33:45] deer hunting, you know, you can't make
[33:47] any sound. You dogs can't run around and
[33:49] my you know, they're going to swear at
[33:50] me when I come around here. And so I was
[33:53] panicking, you know, quickly. I'm
[33:55] checking my phone. Am I on dockland
[33:57] putting my dogs on leashes? You know,
[33:59] cuz I don't want anything, you know, to
[34:01] get upset these people who are doing
[34:04] this and found it odd cuz you're not
[34:06] allowed to to shine a light on Dockland.
[34:08] Anyways, I was like, what's happening?
[34:09] You know, are these bad people? You
[34:11] know, am I in danger? And so I decided I
[34:15] was like, I'll go, you know, I have to
[34:16] go quietly, put my torch on to you to do
[34:18] like a green light setting so they can't
[34:20] really see your your torch light. Walked
[34:22] a bit further and, you know, it turns
[34:24] out it was the sunrise. It made it look
[34:26] like a light beam. Amen. And I man and I
[34:29] was I just felt a atmosphere change from
[34:32] like all panicking and all this stuff to
[34:35] suddenly, you know, I was in a pleasant
[34:37] atmosphere. I realized I'm alone. You
[34:39] know, there's no bad people. I'm I'm in
[34:41] no harm. I'm just having a blessed time
[34:43] in the Lord. Amen. So, amen.
[34:47] So, so here we see that we we we are
[34:51] born we are born with this this fallen
[34:53] nature because in in in the in the fall
[34:56] when Adam fell
[34:59] a mean that before he fell the human
[35:01] race was perfect but then after Adam
[35:03] sinned
[35:05] then then the human race the human race
[35:07] fell and we are now born in and shaped
[35:10] in in sin and iniquity.
[35:14] Amen. And you know like myself when I
[35:15] was a kid um
[35:18] I used to bite people and stuff and you
[35:21] know go make quarrels and try to always
[35:24] touch fireplaces and stuff when people
[35:26] told me not to. But it's cuz I was born
[35:28] with a fallen nature. Amen. There was
[35:30] just something in me that that just that
[35:32] didn't want to to do the right thing.
[35:34] And I mean we we we are all born with
[35:36] this nature.
[35:38] Amen. And brother Brandham says here now
[35:41] quietly reverently before God as we seen
[35:44] this seal open to us God giving his own
[35:47] beloved children and blind the eyes and
[35:50] send them because his own justice
[35:52] justice requires judgment of sin. Think
[35:55] of that his justice and his holiness
[35:58] requires justice. A law without a
[36:00] penalty is not a law. And his own laws
[36:03] himself he cannot defy and still remain
[36:05] God. So when we fell, God couldn't just,
[36:08] you know, we couldn't just then be back
[36:10] better again. We had to have a
[36:11] sacrifice. Amen. Something something had
[36:13] to happen. Amen. The the the fallen
[36:16] David had to had something sacrificed
[36:19] for him so I could I could be brought
[36:21] back to to how Adam was.
[36:24] Amen. So So you know, God can't just he
[36:27] can't just forgive this and we be back
[36:30] to back to how it was. You know, there
[36:32] had to be a sacrifice. Amen. And you
[36:35] know, but but but God couldn't let the
[36:38] fallen David go because I'm part of him,
[36:41] you know, and we're all part of him.
[36:42] Amen. So God had to come and and and he
[36:46] wanted he he wants to to dwell in us
[36:49] again. Amen. So so so God has a plan.
[36:53] Amen. And
[36:56] and we see that, you know, that that God
[36:58] God wants to he he he he desires to to
[37:02] to be to be to be back with us. And and
[37:05] brother Brandham says here, God's
[37:07] holiness, God being God projects that
[37:10] himself. If there was not a sinner,
[37:12] there would never he would never have
[37:15] been a savior. And God also doesn't just
[37:18] desire to to be back with us in this
[37:20] fellowship. He did there before the be
[37:22] in the beginning we he was um he had
[37:26] these attributes in him like brother
[37:28] Brandham's saying here to to be a savior
[37:30] and stuff and and and God wants God has
[37:34] to express those attributes. Amen. So
[37:37] you know you could say we had to fall
[37:39] for for God to be able to express these
[37:42] attributes as brother Bram was saying.
[37:43] But if he was a savior at the beginning
[37:45] so there was nothing lost and his own
[37:48] attributes as being a savior projected a
[37:51] sinner. There had to be something to be
[37:53] saved before there could be anything
[37:55] saved. There had to be something lost.
[37:57] So we had to fall in in order that in
[38:00] order that God could become a savior to
[38:01] us. Amen. And brother Brandham carries
[38:03] on here. He says, "And his righteousness
[38:06] and his holiness, if there had never
[38:08] been a a sick person, he'd have never
[38:11] been a healer from the beginning. And of
[38:14] the beginnings, he was before the
[38:16] beginning, he was a healer." So there
[38:18] was nothing sick, so had projected a
[38:21] sick person that he might heal them to
[38:23] make them a healer. Amen. So So we had
[38:26] to fall and we had to get sick and have
[38:28] these problems so that the Lord could
[38:30] come and could could come and heal us.
[38:33] Amen.
[38:35] Amen. Brother Bam says here
[38:40] he says um
[38:43] says here and he was crucified for our
[38:45] sins and raised for our justification.
[38:48] Then through his righteous blood we are
[38:51] cleansed that God could come into us and
[38:54] fellowship. God making his way back to
[38:56] fellowship with Adam's children as he
[38:59] did with Adam before the fall. And we
[39:02] are redeemed from all the curse of the
[39:05] fall and now have the earnest of our
[39:08] salvation. Amen. So God so so so God God
[39:12] came and and died for us. Amen. That's
[39:14] why he had to die because because he had
[39:17] to redeem us from from this from the the
[39:22] fall. Amen. He had to bring us he wanted
[39:24] to bring us back into communication with
[39:26] him so that he can come dwell in us and
[39:29] and s with us. Yeah. Amen. And and and
[39:33] so and so he died for us. And and and we
[39:36] can see that he also had to had to had
[39:38] to come die for us so that he could be a
[39:41] savior. Amen. Because we understand that
[39:43] from from the beginning of time, he was
[39:45] a savior, but he had to come and express
[39:48] those attributes. Amen. Hallelujah. John
[39:51] 3:13 says here, "For God so loved the
[39:53] world that he gave his only begotten son
[39:56] that whosoever believeth in him should
[39:59] not perish but have everlasting life.
[40:01] For God sent not his son into the world
[40:04] to condemn the world but that the world
[40:07] through him might be saved."
[40:09] Amen. So, so just in closing, if the we
[40:12] could have the musicians. So we we
[40:15] understand that why God had to die was
[40:17] because God had to express the
[40:19] attributes of a savior that were order
[40:21] in him. But he had to come and and
[40:23] express these attributes and he wanted
[40:26] to have communion with us so he could
[40:29] come and and dwell dwell in us.
[40:32] Amen. He couldn't just he couldn't just
[40:35] stay stay he when when we fell he wanted
[40:38] to come yeah come come come sub with us.
[40:41] And you know when I fell into the world
[40:44] you know that felt like you know there
[40:45] was just I wanted to go back to how
[40:47] things were. You know I didn't want to
[40:49] stay like this in this broken person.
[40:51] Amen. I wanted to to come back and
[40:53] really really suck with the Lord. Amen.
[40:55] And you know that's sort of what the
[40:57] Lord wanted with us. He just wanted to
[40:59] come back. Amen. And praise God he did.
[41:02] Amen. And praise God because else I
[41:04] would have been lost. Amen. So but I am
[41:06] found. And praise God that God has found
[41:08] all of us. Amen.
[41:10] Such a blessing. Amen. Just if the
[41:13] musicians could play quietly, we'll just
[41:15] um if we could just stand.
[41:18] Let's close in a word of prayer. And
[41:19] Amen. And you know, if you if you really
[41:23] feel you want the Lord to just come and
[41:24] work in your life and and just come and
[41:26] come and bless you. I love raising my
[41:27] hand. Amen. Cuz you know, at first you
[41:30] sort of think, "Oh, who's looking at
[41:31] me?" But I heard a quote brother
[41:33] Brandham said. He said, "I always raise
[41:34] my hand when anyone um whenever someone
[41:38] asks me if there any need, should we
[41:39] raise a hand?" He said, "Always do cuz
[41:41] we are a needy people." So every time
[41:43] Brother Ben says, "Raise your hand." I
[41:44] always I always got my hand up, man. Cuz
[41:45] I'm a needy person. I mean, if Brother
[41:47] Brandon was needy, I'm very needy. Amen.
[41:49] Um let's just pray. Dearly Father, oh
[41:53] Lord, I pray you just come, Dear Lord,
[41:55] come meet all the needs. Dearly Father,
[41:57] oh Lord, we're a needy people, dear Lord
[41:58] Jesus. Oh Lord, I've got my hand up.
[42:00] Dearly father, I'm a I'm a needy person.
[42:02] Oh Lord, I pray you just come come meet
[42:04] our needs, oh Lord, and just come come
[42:07] be very close to us, dear heavenly
[42:08] father. Oh Lord, I pray that you just
[42:10] come and just bless us, oh Lord. I thank
[42:13] you that we could come today, dearly
[42:14] father, and just be so so blessed in
[42:16] you, dear Lord Jesus. And dear Lord, may
[42:19] you just continue your your your great
[42:21] and mighty work in our lives, dely. And
[42:23] dear Lord, we thank you for saving us,
[42:25] dearly Father. And oh Lord, we we
[42:27] understand why you had to die, dearly
[42:29] Father. dear Lord, to save us, oh Lord,
[42:30] and to to express the attributes of a
[42:33] savior, of a redeemer, dear heavenly
[42:35] father of a healer, we thank you that
[42:36] you've done this for us, oh Lord, we
[42:38] thank you that we're not lost, that
[42:39] we're found, and dearly Father, that
[42:40] we're all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[42:41] going to heaven in a rapture. Oh Lord,
[42:43] if Deather,
[42:45] dear Lord, if we don't die before,
[42:46] Dearly Father, but dear Lord, I thank
[42:48] you for being with us. I thank you for
[42:49] being our portion, dear Lord Jesus. In
[42:52] Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. Amen.
[42:54] Brother Jim,
[43:03] [Applause]
[43:04] Thank you, David.
[43:07] I remember one time when I was a kid, I
[43:09] was going down a slide. Was a very high
[43:12] slide and you know when you're a kid,
[43:14] you you just want to have some fun and
[43:17] what happened with my Hi, Ven.
[43:22] So, I was going down and I start to fall
[43:24] to the side. So, I was going to land on
[43:26] the ground, but there was a guy from the
[43:29] youth that he just grabbed me and and he
[43:33] saved me from landing on on the ground.
[43:35] That guy was my friend for the rest of
[43:38] the years that I was there in Chile. And
[43:42] one of the greatest um attributes from
[43:46] the Lord is being a savior. I remember
[43:49] when he rescued me. Amen. When you have
[43:52] that revelation that he's a savior,
[43:55] man. Hallelujah. Let's just sing um
[44:01] um worthy is the lamb.

[48:43] Worthy is the lamb.
[48:51] Worthy is love.
[48:59] Worthy is love.
[49:06] Worthy is the lamb.
[49:15] Amen. Um,
[49:18] thank you musicians.
[49:20] Um, thank you brother Ben as well for
[49:22] giving me the opportunity. Um,
[49:26] today I'd like to preach on something
[49:28] um, fairly simple and probably we've all
[49:31] like heard it a couple times before, but
[49:34] it really stuck out to me this month.
[49:37] Um, and I want to share it with you
[49:38] guys. So, um, I just like to open in the
[49:41] word of um, prayer real quick.
[49:45] Thank you, Lord, that you could um,
[49:47] bring us here, Lord, this afternoon.
[49:48] Lord, I pray that you'll please help me,
[49:51] Lord, to get out the way and that you
[49:52] would speak to your people, Lord. And I
[49:54] pray that they'll be able to get
[49:56] something out of it. I pray pray bless
[49:58] the word as we open it in Jesus name.
[49:59] Amen. Amen. Okay.
[50:03] This is my scripture. Trust in the Lord
[50:05] with all thy heart and lean not unto
[50:08] your own understandings.
[50:10] In all ways acknowledge him and he shall
[50:12] direct thy path. You may be seated.
[50:15] So today I'd like to talk about
[50:17] listening to God's voice and letting him
[50:19] lead. And I've got two people in the
[50:21] Bible today that um I want to talk
[50:24] about. So this is the meaning of lead.
[50:27] So to lead is to direct in a course will
[50:30] show the way to be followed. And that's
[50:32] what the Lord did for us I believe. So
[50:36] I'd like to talk about David this
[50:37] morning uh afternoon and um ziglag and I
[50:41] would just read a little bit from here
[50:42] and then I'll kind of go to the
[50:44] definition and come back. So it says
[50:47] here and David inquired of the Lord
[50:48] saying shall I pursue after this troop?
[50:51] Shall I overtake them? And he answered
[50:54] him, "Pursue, for thou shalt surely
[50:56] overtake takeake them and without fail
[50:59] recover all." And so I want to just go
[51:02] to this
[51:04] um meaning here. Diligently is to
[51:07] active, attentive, carefully, eager,
[51:10] earnest, and persistent. So um I would
[51:14] say that David didn't just ask the Lord
[51:16] once, but he asked of the Lord a couple
[51:19] times if he if he should go or not. And
[51:22] it says here as we go on, so David went,
[51:26] he and 600 men that were with him and
[51:29] came to the brook Besso. And when those
[51:32] when those that were left behind stayed,
[51:34] but David pursued he and 400 men for 200
[51:38] abode behind where which were so faint
[51:42] that they could not go over Brooks. And
[51:45] they and wait, I just quickly go back
[51:47] here. So in this scenario, David was in
[51:50] a very like tense time. His family and
[51:54] everything was taken away and um many
[51:57] like the people wanted to stone him and
[51:59] things. So he was in a very tough time
[52:02] and he could have listened to many
[52:03] people. He could have listened to his
[52:05] friends. He could have listened to his
[52:07] governor and all that. But instead, he
[52:10] listened to God and he asked God first.
[52:12] And we can do that in our life. Like if
[52:15] we've got a situation where we need God
[52:17] as leading, we should ask God and we
[52:20] shouldn't go to our friends and
[52:22] different things for a first opinion.
[52:24] And
[52:26] it keeps going to say, "And they found
[52:28] an Egyptian boy in the field and brought
[52:30] him to David. And he gave them gave him
[52:33] bread, and they did and he did eat. And
[52:36] they made him drink water. And he gave
[52:40] and they gave him a piece of cake of
[52:42] figs and two clusters of raisins. And
[52:45] when he had eaten, he his spirit came
[52:49] again to him. For he had not eaten bread
[52:52] nor drunk any water three days and three
[52:54] nights. And you see here by David
[52:57] listening to God, he didn't just
[53:00] um go on to win the battle and get back
[53:03] his family, but he also came to help
[53:06] this person that was probably going to
[53:08] die if he didn't come that way. So
[53:12] sometimes the Lord leads us a certain
[53:14] way that might not seem the way we want
[53:17] to go or we think we should go but there
[53:20] might be someone else that we can help
[53:22] while going through that going through
[53:24] that trial or whatever. So
[53:28] um down here it says and
[53:31] and he said unto him to whom belongest
[53:33] thou and whence art thou? And he said,
[53:36] "I'm a young man of Egypt, the servant
[53:39] of Amalcch, and my master left me
[53:42] because 3 days a gone, I fell sick." And
[53:47] um and he goes on to say about how they
[53:50] invaded and gives David like some
[53:53] information about where the the um
[53:56] people were and where he could find
[53:58] them. And
[54:01] and so you can read on here and it says
[54:04] I'm just skipping down a bit to and it
[54:07] says and day um and he and David
[54:10] smokeote them from the twilight even
[54:13] unto the evening of the next day and
[54:16] they escaped no not a man of them save
[54:20] 400 young men which rode on camel camels
[54:22] and fled. And David recovered all that
[54:26] the Amalachites had carried away. And
[54:28] David rescued his two wives. And there
[54:31] was nothing lacking them. Neither small
[54:33] nor great, son nor daughter, neither
[54:35] spoil nor anything that had that they
[54:38] had taken to them, David recovered all.
[54:42] And also, you see, when God leads you,
[54:44] like you get everything back. You don't
[54:47] leave anything behind. So listening to
[54:49] God, I would say, is probably the best
[54:51] thing you could do. And I want to talk
[54:54] on the other side. So God listened to
[54:56] David but uh to David listened to God
[55:00] but here's another part where about Saul
[55:03] and this is when Saul didn't listen to
[55:05] God. And thus saith the the Lord of
[55:09] hosts I remember that which Amalcch did
[55:12] to Israel how he laid weight for him in
[55:15] the way when he came up from Egypt. Now
[55:18] go and smite Amalcch and utterly destroy
[55:20] all that they have and spare them not
[55:24] but slay both man and woman, infant and
[55:27] suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
[55:32] And so I've got a little meaning here as
[55:35] well for utterly destroy. It is to
[55:38] completely ruin or eliminate something
[55:40] leaving nothing remaining. So this is
[55:43] quite a clear instruction from God.
[55:45] Don't leave anything behind like just
[55:48] absolutely take them out. And D and Saul
[55:51] gathered his people together and
[55:53] numbered them in tell him 200,000
[55:55] footmen and 10,000 men from of Judah.
[56:00] And David came to the city of Amalcch
[56:03] and laid weight in the valley. And Saul
[56:06] said unto Canite, unto the Canites, "Go
[56:10] depart, get you down from among the
[56:13] Amalachites, lest I destroy you with
[56:15] them. For you showed kindness to all the
[56:18] children of Israel when they came up out
[56:20] of Egypt." So um Kenn the Kennedites
[56:24] departed from among the Amalachites
[56:28] and and Saul smokeote the Amalachites
[56:30] from Havali Havala um unto the thou
[56:36] comest to sure that it that is over
[56:40] against Egypt. And he took Aag the king
[56:42] of the Amalikites
[56:45] and utterly destroyed all the people
[56:47] with the edge of the sword. But Saul and
[56:49] the people spared Aag the best of the
[56:52] sheep and of the oxen and of the
[56:54] fatlings and of the lambs and all that
[56:57] was good and would not utterly destroy
[57:00] them. But everything that was vile and
[57:03] refuse that they destroyed utterly. So
[57:07] he didn't listen to God and he just like
[57:11] destroyed what he didn't want. He didn't
[57:13] he didn't go by what God wanted him to
[57:15] do. And um so he kept the king and he
[57:18] kept all the nice things of the land.
[57:21] And then came the word of the Lord unto
[57:24] Samuel, saying, "It repenteth me that I
[57:27] have set up Saul to be king, for he
[57:30] turned turned back from following me,
[57:32] and he has not performed my
[57:34] commandments." And it grieveth Sam and
[57:36] it grieveth Samuel, and he cried unto
[57:38] the Lord all night. And so here you see
[57:41] as well he got punished for not
[57:43] listening to God just like we remember
[57:45] the story of brother Brandham with hope
[57:48] when he didn't listen to God and um to
[57:51] go preach for the meetings that the
[57:53] people wanted him told and um listened
[57:56] to his mother-in-law instead of
[57:57] listening to God and hope died. though
[58:01] in this case Saul didn't listen to God
[58:04] and he from there on the throne got
[58:07] given to David and he was no longer king
[58:10] and so God can also like with danger God
[58:13] can show us where to go cuz like if
[58:17] there's a story so I'll tell you a story
[58:20] um not Noah nos but me Liam and another
[58:23] friend of us and Noah uh we were playing
[58:26] in the backyard and we saw wasp nest in
[58:28] Belmont And um we decided to hit it with
[58:32] bats, but I I always had this feeling
[58:35] that we shouldn't do it, like just stay
[58:37] away, like go away from it. And we just
[58:40] I didn't really listen. So we kept on
[58:42] whacking at the bush. And the luckily
[58:44] not many came out, but some wasps came
[58:47] out and stung us. But that's just a
[58:50] quick um like story to show that if you
[58:52] don't listen to God, like he does warn
[58:54] you and he tries to help you, but if you
[58:56] don't listen to him, then he can't do
[58:58] much about that. So,
[59:02] um if the musicians want to come up, I'm
[59:04] just going to read one more quote here
[59:05] that brother Bham says, um there's one
[59:09] more thing left and God take me to the
[59:12] cave where I can find it. Let's get that
[59:15] still small voice. That's something that
[59:17] puts the cream in life. That's some
[59:20] That's something that though you speak
[59:22] with tongues of men and angels and have
[59:24] not that you're nothing. Though you can
[59:27] prophesy and do great signs, but if that
[59:30] little still small voice isn't there,
[59:33] you're nothing, says a scripture. That's
[59:35] what we're listening for. We've had the
[59:37] earth, the thundsies. We've had the
[59:39] fire. We've had the rushing winds and
[59:42] the earthquakes. But God sent us as the
[59:44] still small voice. That's what we need.
[59:48] So, I believe that all of us in this
[59:50] week coming and through our lives should
[59:53] listen to God and let him lead because
[59:55] there's no one better to lead us than
[59:56] God cuz he knows what's going to come
[59:59] before us and and everything and how he
[1:00:01] wants it planned out. So, I pray you
[1:00:04] guys were blessed by that. And yeah, I'm
[1:00:06] just want to pray real quick. Um, if I
[1:00:09] can just close it.
[1:00:12] Thank you, Lord, for being with with me,
[1:00:15] Lord, and helping me, Lord. I pray that
[1:00:16] the people here would be able to take
[1:00:19] something from the service, Lord. And I
[1:00:21] pray that you'll please just bless them
[1:00:23] as they go on their ways home. I pray in
[1:00:25] Jesus name. Amen.

[1:03:54] Amen. That was a blessing. Appreciate
[1:03:55] both of those. Amen. Let's um Thank you,
[1:03:57] musicians. Amen. So, I set up a for the
[1:04:00] youth, I set up a anonymous question
[1:04:03] form. Basically, a blank form and they
[1:04:05] can just put in anything, send it to me.
[1:04:07] I don't know who it comes from. I just
[1:04:08] receive it. So, I got a couple of
[1:04:10] questions in the week. So, we're just
[1:04:11] going to go through them. This is
[1:04:12] actually one question even though it's
[1:04:14] three. And then we're going to go the
[1:04:15] second one. So, got a good um but yeah,
[1:04:18] I won't try and be I'll try and not be
[1:04:19] too long. Um we're just going to So,
[1:04:22] here's the question. So, we're going to
[1:04:23] go to Judges 13. It says, "So, how is
[1:04:26] the story of Samson relevant to us as
[1:04:28] the bride? Also, how uh is him not
[1:04:31] cutting his hair significant to his
[1:04:32] strength? And is there a link of how
[1:04:34] women are to keep their long hair?" So,
[1:04:36] that's the question. Good question.
[1:04:38] That's a good question. So, let's go to
[1:04:40] Judges uh 13. We just read here um
[1:04:42] quickly then you can um have your seats.
[1:04:47] So it says here, yes we have it here. So
[1:04:49] it says uh and the children of Israel
[1:04:52] did evil again in the sight of the Lord
[1:04:54] and the Lord delivered them into the
[1:04:56] hand of the Philistines 40 years. And
[1:04:58] there was a certain man of Zora of the
[1:05:00] family of the Danites whose name was
[1:05:02] Monoah and his wife was barren and bear
[1:05:04] not. And the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:05:06] unto the woman, and said unto her,
[1:05:08] Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest
[1:05:11] not, but thou shalt conceive and bear a
[1:05:12] son. Uh, now therefore, beware, I pray
[1:05:15] thee, drink not wine, nor strong drink,
[1:05:18] and and eat not any unclean thing. For
[1:05:20] lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a son,
[1:05:22] and no razor shall come on his head. For
[1:05:24] the child shall be a Nazerite unto God
[1:05:27] from the womb, and he shall begin to
[1:05:29] deliver Israel out of the l hand of the
[1:05:31] Philistines. Amen. So, let's pray this
[1:05:34] afternoon. and gracious father, we want
[1:05:36] to thank you Lord so much that you are
[1:05:38] our heavenly father. We appreciate this
[1:05:40] Lord this afternoon. Thank you for what
[1:05:42] we've heard just now. Lord, thank you
[1:05:44] for speaking to our lives. And Lord, I
[1:05:45] just pray as we've read your word once
[1:05:47] again, may you anoint speaker and hear
[1:05:48] her one more time and bring clarity and
[1:05:50] bring understanding. Lord, we love you
[1:05:52] so much and we thank you in Jesus
[1:05:54] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may have
[1:05:56] your seats um this afternoon. So how is
[1:05:59] the story of Samson relevant to us as
[1:06:01] the bride and how is him not cutting his
[1:06:04] hair significant to his strength? So I'm
[1:06:05] just repeating myself here and is there
[1:06:07] any linked of how women are to keep
[1:06:08] their long hair. So the story of Samson
[1:06:11] being relevant to the bride is it speaks
[1:06:13] of the believers down through the seven
[1:06:15] church ages but in particularly this
[1:06:17] last age. Now um the mother of Samson
[1:06:21] was told to to not uh you know to don't
[1:06:24] drink strong wine or eating unclean
[1:06:27] thingy because the child that she was
[1:06:30] going to birth was going to be a
[1:06:31] Nazarite. Now a Nazerite if we look into
[1:06:34] the scripture in numbers 6 it says and
[1:06:36] so this is the law of the Nazarite
[1:06:38] basically means someone who separated to
[1:06:39] God. Okay that's what Nazarite means.
[1:06:41] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[1:06:43] Speak unto the children of Israel, and
[1:06:44] say unto them, uh, when either man or
[1:06:46] woman shall separate themselves a vow,
[1:06:49] vow of a Nazarite, to separate
[1:06:50] themselves unto the Lord, he shall
[1:06:52] separate himself from wine and strong
[1:06:54] drink, and shall not drink no vinegar of
[1:06:56] wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
[1:06:58] neither shall he drink any liquor of
[1:07:00] grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
[1:07:03] All the days of his separation shall he
[1:07:05] eat nothing that is made of the vine
[1:07:06] tree from the kernels, even to the husk.
[1:07:09] And all the days of the vow of
[1:07:11] separation shall there shall be no razor
[1:07:13] come upon his head until the days be
[1:07:15] fulfilled in which he separated himself
[1:07:17] unto the Lord. He shall be holy and
[1:07:19] shall let the locks of his hair of his
[1:07:21] head grow all the days that he has
[1:07:23] separated himself unto the Lord. He
[1:07:24] shall come at no dead body. He shall not
[1:07:27] make himself unclean for his father or
[1:07:29] his mother, for his brother or for his
[1:07:31] sister when they die because the
[1:07:32] consecration of God of his God is upon
[1:07:34] his head all the days of his separation.
[1:07:36] He is holy unto the Lord. So Samson was
[1:07:39] born a Nazerite. Okay. So he was and it
[1:07:41] says he shall be a Nazerite even unto
[1:07:44] his death. So he was going to be a
[1:07:47] Nazerite all all of his life. Okay? So
[1:07:51] he's separated to God. Now his strength
[1:07:54] lay in his separation to God which is
[1:07:57] symbolized by his uncut hair. And this
[1:07:59] is where it comes into how it ties in
[1:08:00] with a woman. We'll go into 1
[1:08:02] Corinthians 11. But a Nazarite vow. We
[1:08:04] are all Nazarites to the Lord. When you
[1:08:07] give your life to the Lord, you're
[1:08:08] separated unto him. See, many times
[1:08:10] people just say, "Oh, you're separated
[1:08:11] from the world." But what are we
[1:08:12] separated to? We're separated to the
[1:08:14] true and living God. The power of his
[1:08:16] blood cleanses us from the things of the
[1:08:18] world and we're separated to God. Now,
[1:08:20] this is symbolized in the uncut hair of
[1:08:23] a woman because it's showing that she is
[1:08:24] under the word. Okay? So, she is
[1:08:26] separate. Her headship is the Lord
[1:08:28] himself. And this brings a power and a
[1:08:30] protection with it. But now with Samson,
[1:08:33] because we know that anything God puts
[1:08:35] in his word for us to do, there's a
[1:08:36] spiritual application or principle
[1:08:38] behind it. It's not just because, you
[1:08:41] know, there's a reason behind it. Now,
[1:08:42] so Samson was ordained by God to begin
[1:08:45] the deliverance
[1:08:47] um of Israel from the Philistines. Now,
[1:08:50] it's just like when the church was
[1:08:51] birthed on the day of Pentecost, it was
[1:08:53] birthed that God would bring deliverance
[1:08:56] to all of his people through his body on
[1:08:58] the earth, which was the church. But
[1:09:00] then what happened is because when
[1:09:01] compromise came in then um then of
[1:09:04] course the you know those locks were
[1:09:05] were were shaved off and the power of
[1:09:07] God was shaved off the church but now in
[1:09:09] this end time it has regrown. So B but
[1:09:12] so I'm going to kind of I've given you
[1:09:13] the long the short of the long of it but
[1:09:15] now I'm going to kind of jump into that
[1:09:17] because the question is how is the story
[1:09:19] relevant to you and I because it's not
[1:09:21] just on a seven church ages level but
[1:09:22] it's on a personal level. Now, Samson
[1:09:25] had the secret of his strength was his
[1:09:27] Nazarite vow. And the enemy was always
[1:09:30] trying to see how the how he could break
[1:09:32] that power. It's the same thing with the
[1:09:34] devil against you and I. He's seeing how
[1:09:36] he can break the power of God because he
[1:09:38] knows I mean he knows he doesn't have
[1:09:40] the keys to his own house. He knows he
[1:09:42] was defeated on every hand. But he but
[1:09:44] he's trying to how can I he always
[1:09:46] thinks how can he separate God and man?
[1:09:49] Remember and you know in in heaven he
[1:09:51] was anointed cherub that coverth. He he
[1:09:53] he protect he he guarded access to God.
[1:09:56] So he's always going to try and be that
[1:09:57] wedge between you and God. That's just
[1:09:59] how he's built because he's fallen but
[1:10:01] he's still a cherubam in that way but
[1:10:02] he's fallen from that but he's still
[1:10:04] made that way. So he's going to always
[1:10:05] try and get between you and God. And so
[1:10:07] now the you know the Philistines would
[1:10:09] try and say how can we how can we uh
[1:10:12] find the secret of his strength that we
[1:10:13] can cut it take it from him that he'll
[1:10:15] be like any other man because Samson
[1:10:17] wasn't some big Hulk smash kind of a
[1:10:19] guy, right? He was a little bitty
[1:10:21] shrimp. He wasn't some big massive 10-ft
[1:10:24] monster, primeval monster guy. He was he
[1:10:26] was small. And that's, you know, and
[1:10:29] that's the secret of it is the fact that
[1:10:31] it wasn't his physical strength. It was
[1:10:32] the anointing of God came upon him cuz
[1:10:34] he was separated to God that God would
[1:10:36] do supernatural things through his life.
[1:10:38] And so the enemy wanted to find the way
[1:10:42] to to um get it. Now, the problem is is
[1:10:45] Samson had a weakness. Samson didn't
[1:10:48] give his whole life to the Lord. See,
[1:10:51] there's always, you know, if you're
[1:10:52] fully surrendered to God, there's
[1:10:53] nothing the devil can do to get you,
[1:10:55] right? But he gave his strength to God,
[1:10:57] but he gave his heart to Delilah. And it
[1:11:00] shows that us as a people can give our
[1:11:02] gifts to God. But what about us? Cuz his
[1:11:05] heart is, you know, your heart is who
[1:11:06] you really are. You see, he didn't give
[1:11:08] his heart to the Lord. He gave his
[1:11:09] strength to the Lord. And we can be
[1:11:10] gifted. We can speak. We can play. We
[1:11:12] can sing. We can do whatever. That's
[1:11:14] just a gift we can give to God. But what
[1:11:15] about our hearts? God wants our heart,
[1:11:17] right? He doesn't just want a gift. He
[1:11:19] wants you. He wants me. Amen. So Samson
[1:11:22] Samson, you know, he didn't he didn't
[1:11:24] give his strength. I mean, sorry, he
[1:11:26] gave his strength to God. He didn't give
[1:11:27] his heart. Now, Brother Bram says this
[1:11:29] in in a total deliverance. He says, just
[1:11:31] like you, if you're a Christian, God
[1:11:33] doesn't make any halfways. God makes
[1:11:35] complete Christians. God don't make
[1:11:37] halfway preachers, but a preacher can be
[1:11:39] halfway. And God makes his children
[1:11:41] Christians, but sometimes they're
[1:11:43] halfway Christians. Amen. But it's not
[1:11:45] God's intention for them to be that way
[1:11:47] as their own ways got mixed up with the
[1:11:49] plan of God for their life. And that's
[1:11:51] what makes them the way they are. So
[1:11:53] Samson had a plan. God had a plan.
[1:11:55] Samson's plan was I want the pretty
[1:11:57] Philistine girls. And God wanted him to
[1:11:59] deliver deliver Israel from the
[1:12:01] Philistines. Right? So so he was halfway
[1:12:05] in that way. See? Um and this is the
[1:12:08] problem is that because of that he
[1:12:10] yielded his his heart. He gave to
[1:12:13] Delilah, his strength he gave to God. So
[1:12:16] this doesn't come into how does it apply
[1:12:18] to you and I. We got to give all that we
[1:12:19] are to the Lord. God doesn't want part
[1:12:22] of us. He wants all of us. He wants all
[1:12:24] of our life, all of our heart, all of
[1:12:26] our affections, all that we are wants to
[1:12:28] be surrendered to him. Because if if
[1:12:31] Samson was completely surrendered to God
[1:12:33] and he came to that point, right? He
[1:12:35] came to that point where he's blinded in
[1:12:37] the temple of the Philistines. He came
[1:12:38] to that point then, but earlier in his
[1:12:40] life, he could have done it. Okay? He
[1:12:42] could have fully surrendered because
[1:12:43] when we're fully surrendered, we can't
[1:12:45] be bought. You know, there's nothing the
[1:12:47] devil can offer us that we want because
[1:12:49] our hearts aren't ours. Our life isn't
[1:12:51] ours. It's God's. Right? So, it's just
[1:12:53] like the Lord Jesus, he didn't just give
[1:12:54] his strength to God. All he was was
[1:12:57] God's. He was our living sacrifice.
[1:12:59] Amen. And so, the devil couldn't buy him
[1:13:02] with anything when he was tempting him
[1:13:03] in the wilderness and so on. And so now
[1:13:07] Samson's strength lay or the source of
[1:13:09] his strength lay in the fact he was a
[1:13:11] nazite to the Lord. And when Delilah
[1:13:14] finally wore him down because the
[1:13:17] Philistines say, "Hey, Samson loves
[1:13:20] Delilah. We're going to pay Delilah to
[1:13:23] to to find out where his strength is."
[1:13:25] And this is what happens is the world
[1:13:26] comes our way to try and shave our
[1:13:28] strength off and blind us and make a
[1:13:30] mockery of us. That's what the that's
[1:13:31] what the world wants to do. That's a
[1:13:33] problem with things like you say, well,
[1:13:35] you know, it's not religion that grabs
[1:13:36] us here, but what about social media?
[1:13:38] What about Tik Tok? What about, you
[1:13:40] know, you see shorts and reals and
[1:13:41] stuff. There's a reason there's always
[1:13:43] music blurring when you start watching
[1:13:44] it. Because brother Bram says, if that
[1:13:46] person is not converted, the spirit of
[1:13:48] that music will catch them. And this is
[1:13:50] why it's always there's never a silent
[1:13:52] thing. There's always this music because
[1:13:53] it wants to grab your spirit. And so
[1:13:55] what's that? It's like Delila saying,
[1:13:57] "Where is your strength? How can I
[1:14:00] destroy you?" And people become addicted
[1:14:02] to that thing because their spirit's
[1:14:04] been captured by that. But we're here to
[1:14:06] set spirits free. Amen. Because Samson,
[1:14:09] he could have actually walked away, but
[1:14:10] he was he was already bound up in his
[1:14:12] heart to the Laya. And so that's why
[1:14:15] never get never get caught up in those
[1:14:17] things because it's addictive. And the
[1:14:20] reason it's addictive because it's got a
[1:14:21] spirit behind it. And that spirit wants
[1:14:22] to grab your spirit and keep you
[1:14:24] enslaved to it. And so like Delilah
[1:14:26] basically enslaved. Isn't it amazing
[1:14:28] Samson? You you know Delilah basically
[1:14:30] could have said to Samson how can I
[1:14:31] destroy you?
[1:14:34] That's basically what you know where
[1:14:35] does your where does your strength
[1:14:38] where does your strength lie? I don't
[1:14:40] know if I have the scripture here
[1:14:41] exactly but you know so people get you
[1:14:43] know so this is how it applies to us is
[1:14:45] that the world wants to find the source
[1:14:48] of our strength. What is the source of
[1:14:49] our strength? The baptism of the Holy
[1:14:51] Ghost in the promised word. That's the
[1:14:53] source of our strength. That's what
[1:14:55] gives us supernatural overcoming power
[1:14:57] is God's anointed word in you and I.
[1:14:59] It's not us in our humanity. It's God in
[1:15:01] us that gives us the power. But you see,
[1:15:03] the enemy wants to try and strip that
[1:15:04] off us. So that's how um you know, if he
[1:15:07] can separate you and the word, he's got
[1:15:10] you. Never let nothing, Brother Bam says
[1:15:12] it, never let nothing get between you
[1:15:14] and God's word cuz that's God in print
[1:15:16] form. Never let nothing, doesn't matter
[1:15:18] how good it feels, how exciting it may
[1:15:19] be. If it's contrary to the word, leave
[1:15:21] it alone. Yeah. And then so Samson
[1:15:24] finally relented, gave his gave his um,
[1:15:28] you know, gave his secret over to
[1:15:30] Delilah. Delilah, you know, after
[1:15:32] because there's a few times that she,
[1:15:34] you know, asked him where his strength
[1:15:36] lay. And, uh, it's even um, I don't have
[1:15:38] the scripture here, but it says that,
[1:15:39] you know, um, Samson had seven locks of
[1:15:41] hair. It's in the scripture. So, it
[1:15:43] speaks of the seven church ages of the
[1:15:45] power of God. And, you know, so,
[1:15:46] finally, he said, "It's in my hair. I'm
[1:15:48] an Azarite. You know, I've been
[1:15:49] separated to the Lord." and then you
[1:15:50] know if you cut off my hair then I'll be
[1:15:52] like any other man. That's exactly what
[1:15:54] happened. And he got blinded. So the
[1:15:57] world wants to take our strength and
[1:15:59] blind us. So we can't see spiritually
[1:16:03] where we are, who we are, where we're
[1:16:06] going. That's what he wants to do. Cuz
[1:16:08] remember, just cuz we're the bride of
[1:16:10] Christ doesn't mean we're invincible if
[1:16:12] we put go on the devil's ground. You got
[1:16:15] to stay on God's ground. Right? If God
[1:16:17] wants you to go on the devil's ground,
[1:16:18] it's not it's not going to be to
[1:16:20] compromise. Like Samson went on the
[1:16:22] devil's ground to compromise with his
[1:16:24] separation. Is that okay? Does it all
[1:16:26] make sense? We're going to stay in the
[1:16:28] word more than anything. It's our
[1:16:29] protection, right? And so if we stay
[1:16:31] with the word, we're invincible. If we
[1:16:33] leave the word,
[1:16:35] we're we're it's going to be turkey
[1:16:37] shooting season. It's just going to be a
[1:16:39] disaster. Okay? But we stay with the
[1:16:41] word, all will be well. I mean that with
[1:16:43] all seriousness. So then, but then you
[1:16:45] see while while Samson see Samson when
[1:16:49] he was blinded in the prison when he
[1:16:51] began to realize what he had given up.
[1:16:55] And you got to realize if you're if
[1:16:57] you're sitting in a place of defeat, if
[1:16:59] you feel defeated, think back of when
[1:17:01] you had victory. Amen. Think back where
[1:17:04] you had victory. Cuz Samson, he was
[1:17:05] defeated. He was blinded and grinding at
[1:17:07] the mill. But he began to think about
[1:17:09] when God used to move in his life. And
[1:17:12] that brought him back to a place of true
[1:17:14] repentance. You see, Samson backslid,
[1:17:18] right? He was still God's child, but he
[1:17:20] backslid. And backsliding doesn't mean
[1:17:22] you're lost. It just means you're out of
[1:17:23] fellowship. And so, people can
[1:17:25] backslide. They can be out of out of
[1:17:26] fellowship with God. And the victory out
[1:17:28] of their life leaves, right? But Samson
[1:17:31] began to think about the times when God
[1:17:32] gave him victory. And then what
[1:17:34] happened? That brought a repentance into
[1:17:36] his heart. And then so finally when he
[1:17:38] was there um in the in the temple of
[1:17:41] Dagon and he you know he's standing
[1:17:43] between the two pillars he was willing
[1:17:45] to die with his enemy and he killed more
[1:17:48] in his death than he did in his life.
[1:17:50] Why? Because he is willing to die out to
[1:17:52] everything.
[1:17:54] That's how it applies to us. We got to
[1:17:56] be willing to die out to everything. And
[1:17:58] so um I put this in yellow. He says,
[1:18:00] "How be it the hair of his head begin to
[1:18:02] grow again after he was shaven." So you
[1:18:04] know that you know that began to grow
[1:18:06] and brother Bram would would um
[1:18:09] say this um this is a deceived church by
[1:18:12] the world says may the God of Samson may
[1:18:14] the true in heart those who are longing
[1:18:16] and crying and pleading and holding on
[1:18:18] may they stay with stay with it Lord
[1:18:20] until this new crop grows out until
[1:18:22] there comes forth again a joy in Zion
[1:18:25] and there comes forth a group that can
[1:18:27] recognize and understand that can see
[1:18:29] the Messiah and the hidden power that's
[1:18:31] hid from the world that they will not
[1:18:33] under that that they will not
[1:18:35] understand. Now grant Lord that they'll
[1:18:37] see this for we ask it in Jesus' name.
[1:18:40] So praise Lord. May there be a new crop,
[1:18:43] a people grow out come out of the church
[1:18:46] that will see and recognize Messiah and
[1:18:48] the hidden power that's in the word. He
[1:18:51] says they won't see it now, but granted
[1:18:52] they'll see it. I believe he's talking
[1:18:54] about 2025.
[1:18:56] Amen.
[1:18:57] He says here God send us another church
[1:19:00] just before the end time that the power
[1:19:01] of the Holy Ghost will come into her and
[1:19:03] the demonstrations of the spirit and
[1:19:05] Mark 16 can follow the church. Acts 2:4,
[1:19:07] Acts 238, all of it will be following
[1:19:10] right along with the church signs and
[1:19:12] wonders accompanying the apostles, great
[1:19:14] signs of his resurrection accompanying
[1:19:15] them while they're while they're in
[1:19:17] prison. Surely God's growing a crop
[1:19:19] somewhere for the last great kill. May
[1:19:22] it be you, my Christian friend, here
[1:19:23] this morning. May it be your strength
[1:19:25] that has begun to grow. I pray that this
[1:19:27] message this morning and out into the
[1:19:28] land to where it will go. I trust that
[1:19:30] this message will help bring the vitamin
[1:19:32] to your system that'll grow a spiritual
[1:19:34] power back into your life again. I
[1:19:37] thought my that's powerful.
[1:19:39] Amen. So that's a so that's Sam. Now
[1:19:42] that's I mean you could go on a lot into
[1:19:43] the life of Samson. That's it in a
[1:19:45] nutshell. I don't want to be too long.
[1:19:46] You see it represents the church through
[1:19:49] seven church ages. They had the power of
[1:19:51] God in the beginning. It was shaved off
[1:19:52] in Na but then eventually it begin to
[1:19:54] grow coming through the reformation and
[1:19:56] now here's a crop that's growing forth
[1:19:58] for the last great kill. Amen. Where
[1:20:01] where the enemies of the you know the
[1:20:02] devil will be under the feet of the
[1:20:04] bride of Jesus Christ. So it speaks of
[1:20:06] the church ages but also speaks of us as
[1:20:09] an individual. Make sure you give your
[1:20:11] whole life to the Lord. Not just your
[1:20:12] strength, not your gift or talent but
[1:20:14] your heart. All that you are give to
[1:20:16] him. Amen. that the world can't come and
[1:20:18] try and find your secret and cut that
[1:20:20] power from your life that you become
[1:20:21] blinded as a mockery for the devil. But
[1:20:24] even if you find yourself in that place,
[1:20:26] think about where God was moving in your
[1:20:28] life. It will bring a repentance back at
[1:20:31] just once more, Lord. And God will bring
[1:20:33] greater victory in that full repentance
[1:20:35] that you did your entire Christian walk
[1:20:37] leading up to that point. I like that.
[1:20:40] Don't you? God always gives a way out.
[1:20:41] Isn't that wonderful? Amen. There's no
[1:20:43] prison that we can't get out of. Amen.
[1:20:46] Praise the Lord. Now, and then so the
[1:20:48] last part of that question was uh here.
[1:20:51] So, how's this uh the link of how women
[1:20:53] are to keep their long hair? So, as I
[1:20:54] said before, it's a symbolic of you as a
[1:20:56] Nazarite vow. We're all Nazarites here,
[1:20:58] but you know, uncut or long hair
[1:21:01] represents that your headship is the
[1:21:03] word of God. Okay. Now, I think I've got
[1:21:06] the scripture here. Um
[1:21:10] he says
[1:21:12] I'll just read it here. But I'll have
[1:21:13] you know that the head of every man is
[1:21:15] Christ, and the head of the woman is the
[1:21:16] man, and the head of Christ is God.
[1:21:18] Every man praying or prophesying, having
[1:21:20] his head covered, dishonorth his head.
[1:21:22] But every woman that prayth or
[1:21:23] prophesieth with her head uncovered,
[1:21:25] dishonest her head. For that it is even
[1:21:27] all one, as if she was shaven. And if
[1:21:30] the woman be not covered, let her also
[1:21:32] be shorn. But if it be a shame for a
[1:21:34] woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
[1:21:35] covered. For a man indeed ought not to
[1:21:38] cover his head. For as much as he is the
[1:21:40] image and glory of God, but the woman is
[1:21:42] the glory of the man. For the man was
[1:21:45] not made for the woman, but the woman
[1:21:46] for the man, neither was the man created
[1:21:48] for the woman, but the woman for the
[1:21:49] man. For this cause ought woman to have
[1:21:51] power on her head because of the angel.
[1:21:53] So if she's got uncut hair and her
[1:21:55] attitude's right towards that promise,
[1:21:57] then she has an angelic protection in
[1:22:00] her life. So sisters have greater
[1:22:02] protection than men
[1:22:05] to me based on this scripture. And we
[1:22:07] all know the testimony. Christian could
[1:22:08] come up and share it. Not asking you to
[1:22:09] do so. Not want to put you on the spot.
[1:22:11] But we all have the testimony right here
[1:22:14] of God vindicating that scripture power
[1:22:16] in the head because of the angels. Not
[1:22:18] once but twice, right? And I I I'll save
[1:22:21] the time. I won't share it now. But you
[1:22:23] know, you go ask her if you want
[1:22:24] details. God proves his word. It's not
[1:22:28] you. You know, it's the reason why, you
[1:22:30] know, this world is in such a chaos.
[1:22:32] It's symbolically of, you know, in the
[1:22:33] 20s, so 100 years ago, women begin to
[1:22:35] cut off their hair wholesale and here we
[1:22:37] are now. This world is in chaos. But
[1:22:39] symbolizing man has moved from the
[1:22:41] headship of the word and they want to do
[1:22:43] their own thing,
[1:22:45] right? Um, nevertheless, neither is the
[1:22:47] man without the woman, neither the woman
[1:22:48] without the man in the Lord. For as a
[1:22:50] woman is wait, sorry, here, here I am.
[1:22:53] Sorry. Judge in yourselves, is it comely
[1:22:55] that a woman prayeth unto God uncovered?
[1:22:58] Does not even nature itself teach you
[1:22:59] that if a man have long hair, it's a
[1:23:01] shame unto him. But if a woman have long
[1:23:02] hair, it is glory for her, for her hair
[1:23:04] is given her for a covering. And if any
[1:23:07] man seem to have cont to be contentious,
[1:23:09] we have no such custom, neither the
[1:23:11] churches of God. It's basically Paul is
[1:23:13] saying that's it. We don't have any
[1:23:15] other custom. Don't be contentious. This
[1:23:17] is how it is. Okay? So it's not about a
[1:23:19] covering as in a hat or a scarf. No,
[1:23:22] hair is given as a covering. Okay? Okay.
[1:23:25] And that word long, if you want to don't
[1:23:26] have the definition, but if if you work
[1:23:28] with that word long hair, it does not
[1:23:30] mean length. It means to let grow uncut.
[1:23:33] Right? Otherwise, some of our African
[1:23:34] sisters would have short hair. But they
[1:23:36] don't. They have long hair if it's uncut
[1:23:38] hair. Right? How does it become long
[1:23:41] then if you've cut it? You just repent.
[1:23:44] Then in God's sight, it's like you never
[1:23:46] cut it. Amen. Let it grow. Covering.
[1:23:50] Okay. I'm just being very brief. Sorry
[1:23:52] if I'm not giving the time I should, but
[1:23:54] I I trust these things are quite
[1:23:55] self-explanatory. Now, the next question
[1:23:57] is, why did Ruth have to uncover Boaz's
[1:23:59] feet? And what is the significance of
[1:24:01] that? Okay, so Ruth in Ruth chapter 3,
[1:24:05] she's instructed by Naomi to go and lay
[1:24:08] at uh Boaz's feet on the threshing
[1:24:11] floor. And so I just read this here. It
[1:24:12] says, "And now is not Boaz of our
[1:24:14] kindred." This is Naomi speaking to
[1:24:16] Ruth. With whose maidens um thou was.
[1:24:19] Behold he winnoweth barley tonight in
[1:24:21] the threshing floor. Wash thyself
[1:24:22] therefore and anoint thee and put thy
[1:24:24] raignment upon thee and get thee down to
[1:24:26] the floor. But make not thyself known
[1:24:28] unto the man until he shall be done
[1:24:31] eating and drinking. And it shall be
[1:24:32] when he lieth down. Thou shalt mark the
[1:24:35] place where he lie. And thou shalt go
[1:24:37] and uncover his feet and lay thee down,
[1:24:39] and he will tell thee what thou shalt
[1:24:41] do. And she said unto her, "All that
[1:24:42] thou saith unto me, I will do." So Ruth
[1:24:46] needs uh Ruth here. This is before she
[1:24:50] marries Boaz, before he acts as her
[1:24:52] kinsman redeemer and restores Naomi's
[1:24:54] land, Naomi's position, and marries
[1:24:56] Ruth. And and and the only way that
[1:24:58] Naomi can be restored is by Boaz
[1:25:01] marrying Ruth. Right? So now this is a
[1:25:04] type we know of Ruth being the bride of
[1:25:06] Jesus Christ. Naomi being the word or
[1:25:08] the old testament church and then also
[1:25:10] Boaz is Christ the kinsman redeemer.
[1:25:13] Okay. So what is the significance of you
[1:25:16] know Ruth laying down at his feet? Well
[1:25:18] what is happening is she by laying down
[1:25:20] at his feet is actually showing you are
[1:25:22] my head. I'm laying down as a servant at
[1:25:25] your feet. I'm laying you know I'm not
[1:25:27] I'm not becoming you know I'm not above
[1:25:29] you. I'm under you. Because when we come
[1:25:32] to Christ because this place you know it
[1:25:33] says mark where he laid down. We know
[1:25:36] Christ where he laid down, he laid down
[1:25:38] at Calvary, right? That's where he laid
[1:25:41] down. Amen. So, so what is Naomi is
[1:25:44] saying basically is mark the place where
[1:25:46] he laid and go lie down there. And so it
[1:25:51] says today we want to uncover um so it
[1:25:53] says today they want to uncover
[1:25:54] themselves, cover yourself, go down
[1:25:56] because he winnows barley. But then mark
[1:25:58] the place where he lith down. Did you do
[1:26:00] it? Oh goth. Many years ago, I marked in
[1:26:03] my heart where he laid down his life
[1:26:05] that he might take me. Mark the place
[1:26:07] that he lith down. Watch where he laid.
[1:26:10] That's what every believer should do.
[1:26:12] Mark what he's done for you. He says
[1:26:14] last Sunday's message on the visit to
[1:26:16] Calvary. Mark what he did for you. So,
[1:26:18] he died at Calvary. You've got to have
[1:26:20] your own. You got to die at Calvary.
[1:26:23] Amen. You go to the feet of where the
[1:26:24] Lord died. Lay down there. Amen. He says
[1:26:28] here, he says, "She said, mark where he
[1:26:31] lith down. Then when he lieth down to
[1:26:33] sleep, to rest, you go lie down at his
[1:26:35] feet, not his head, his feet unworthy,
[1:26:38] and take the blanket that he was covered
[1:26:40] with, and pull it over you." Do you see
[1:26:41] it? Oh my. I know you may think I'm a
[1:26:43] fanatic, but it just suits me just
[1:26:45] right. That the spirit of God, Mark,
[1:26:46] where he said, "Calvary, where he laid
[1:26:48] down in the tomb in Gethsemane, Mark,
[1:26:50] and crawl up to his feet and lie down
[1:26:52] there and die to yourself. See, there
[1:26:54] you are. Cover yourself over with his
[1:26:55] skirt." She said the skirt she called it
[1:26:58] and Ruth said that's what uh what you
[1:27:00] say that I'll do. Oh, what a clearcut
[1:27:03] decision for a believer. What the Bible
[1:27:05] says that I'll do. It says repent, be
[1:27:06] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:27:08] I'll do it. If it says go into all the
[1:27:10] world and preach the gospel, I'll do it.
[1:27:12] If it says whatsoever it says Jesus
[1:27:13] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:27:15] forever, what it says for me to do, I'll
[1:27:16] do it. See the church taking its orders
[1:27:18] from the word and she laid down.
[1:27:22] Amen. So what does that skirt symbolize?
[1:27:24] It it symbolizes the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:28] Ghost, his robe spread over. He says she
[1:27:31] laid at Boaz's feet. And when he woke
[1:27:33] and seen the confidence, oh, one of
[1:27:34] these days he'll see the confidence that
[1:27:36] his church has got in him. When he'd
[1:27:38] seen the confidence, he taken his own
[1:27:40] robe. The Holy Spirit spread it over
[1:27:41] her. It was getting cool. And he spread
[1:27:43] his robe over her and sent her on her
[1:27:46] road. So did the people on the day of
[1:27:48] Pentecost, the new church when they went
[1:27:50] out there wasn't ashamed and stood under
[1:27:52] there waiting for 10 days according to
[1:27:54] his word. Christ spread his robe, the
[1:27:56] Holy Ghost over the church to protect
[1:27:58] her and warm her to keep her heart to
[1:28:00] keep your heart right warmed up in
[1:28:01] fellowship until the full time of
[1:28:04] redemption.
[1:28:06] Amen. What did that robe do? Covered her
[1:28:08] covered her shame. Covered her guilt.
[1:28:11] Covered her past. Covered her moabitete
[1:28:13] identity. Covered everything. And when
[1:28:17] and then what happened when Ruth you
[1:28:19] know when Boaz woke up saw Ruth Ruth
[1:28:22] said cover me because I'm your near
[1:28:23] kinsman and that caused Boaz to become a
[1:28:26] kinsman redeemer you know um Naomi said
[1:28:29] to Naomi said to Ruth after this when
[1:28:31] she came back with six measures of
[1:28:33] barley Naomi said to Ruth he will not
[1:28:36] rest until he will accomplish what he
[1:28:39] said he would do this day. Well so Ruth
[1:28:41] now rested. Boaz went into action, went
[1:28:44] to the elders at the gate, did all he
[1:28:46] did. Then he married Ruth, you know. So
[1:28:50] she became Mrs. Boaz, the mighty woman
[1:28:52] of wealth, and then Naomi was restored.
[1:28:55] So the whole plan of redemption was be
[1:28:57] was really activated because Ruth lay at
[1:28:59] his feet.
[1:29:01] My friends, what a position we have to
[1:29:03] get the ball rolling. This is what's
[1:29:05] been happening for seven church ages.
[1:29:06] The believers have found where he laid,
[1:29:09] gave their life, poured it out, laid
[1:29:10] down at his feet, say, "Lord, cover me."
[1:29:13] Amen. What happens then? Then then the
[1:29:15] Lord steps up on your behalf, undoes
[1:29:17] your past, undoes your sin, wipes it all
[1:29:19] away, unites with you. Your identity is
[1:29:22] now in him, and he's doing that all the
[1:29:24] way down till the final one, lays at his
[1:29:26] feet, he finishes his plan of
[1:29:28] redemption, and then the restoration of

[1:30:42] he ever went into sin, Lord, may we be
[1:30:45] like that, dear God, where we give not
[1:30:47] just our strength, Lord. He only gave
[1:30:49] his strength to you. He gave his heart
[1:30:50] to Delila, but Lord, may we give our
[1:30:53] strength, our body, our mind, our
[1:30:55] spirit, our soul, our all that, our
[1:30:57] heart. May we be completely surrendered

[1:31:07] corner blinded being made fun of by the
[1:31:09] enemy Lord there's still a way of
[1:31:11] escape. So Father's anyone here Lord who
[1:31:14] the joy the cry of joy has gone out of
[1:31:16] their heart the victory has left them
[1:31:18] Lord and they just sit sad and depressed
[1:31:20] and down. I ask, Father, may they just
[1:31:22] begin to think about the times when you
[1:31:24] moved in their lives, Lord, when the
[1:31:26] sweetness of the refreshing of your Holy
[1:31:28] Ghost, the joy of their salvation was so
[1:31:30] alive and bubbling out of them. May they
[1:31:32] begin to think on those things, dear
[1:31:34] God. And may they just come back to you,
[1:31:36] Lord, with a heart of repentance, and
[1:31:37] may you restore them, Lord Jesus. Grant
[1:31:39] it, Father. May there be a cry of just
[1:31:41] once more. We love you so much. We thank
[1:31:43] you, dear God, we can be like Ruth and
[1:31:45] find where you laid down. Oh, where
[1:31:47] would we be without that day on Calvary,
[1:31:49] Lord? Father, thank you. We could mark
[1:31:51] where you laid down and Lord, lay down
[1:31:53] at your feet, dear God. Give our all.
[1:31:54] And Lord, we thank you, Father, that
