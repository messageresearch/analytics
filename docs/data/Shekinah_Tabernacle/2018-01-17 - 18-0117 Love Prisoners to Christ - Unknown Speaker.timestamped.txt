[5:54] [Music]
[6:23] good evening everyone welcome to the
[6:27] house of God this evening we have a bass
[6:29] player tonight or are we down a bass
[6:31] player I suspected as much
[6:37] [Laughter]
[6:40] usually when they want to play they come
[6:41] up here rather than sit down there I
[6:44] didn't know I was doing music tonight
[6:46] that's not EADS fault that's my fault I
[6:47] was totally my fault I'm kind of you
[6:50] know when you have a holiday for a
[6:51] couple of weeks
[6:52] you kind of do find that you you sort of
[6:56] slow to get back into the daily grind of
[6:58] life I was a bit more enthusiastic about
[7:02] the whole thing when I was younger but
[7:04] now that I'm getting a wee bit older
[7:06] it's kind of becoming average you know
[7:09] work that the curse of work it's just a
[7:12] soul part of son you know that this
[7:14] world is run by selfishness and and
[7:16] greed and everything so as a result
[7:17] you've got to keep on working and
[7:18] because if you stop everything gets
[7:20] taken away from you because people other
[7:21] people take it that's just part of the
[7:23] curse that we live under I'll be glad
[7:25] when it's all over when when we can
[7:30] enter into that rest because that's what
[7:32] we were designed to do is actually just
[7:34] be in the presence of God and be at
[7:37] peace and there's being harmony and just
[7:39] have a good time that's actually what
[7:42] the human was supposed to do that's the
[7:44] way Adam was made he didn't have to do
[7:45] much everything worked for him but I'll
[7:48] be glad when we get to that place but
[7:50] praise the Lord I came in my sort of
[7:53] that side of the pulpit attire too but
[7:57] you know thinking um when Jesus was
[8:01] around the Bible says the common man
[8:03] sort of heard him badly no they they
[8:05] they kind of liked and I I think for
[8:08] most of the time it was probably dressed
[8:09] like a common man but look one thing we
[8:13] want as we want the Lord to meet with us
[8:14] tonight and we're under expectation to
[8:16] hear from God and to just receive a
[8:19] blessing it's nice to see all the
[8:21] different folk here there's just really
[8:23] entering put our minds off of whatever
[8:26] we've been going through we'll work
[8:27] everything else and really focus on God
[8:30] and make the most of this opportunity
[8:31] that we have that we've met with me met
[8:34] together
[8:36] - to worship God and to receive what he
[8:39] has for us and we want to welcome
[8:40] brother Robert Wilson here tonight and
[8:43] let's just give him Liberty and just let
[8:48] the Lord move it's not let's not let
[8:50] anything get in the way that wastes time
[8:51] you know
[8:52] let us enter and straightaway receive it
[8:55] and and just be blessed tonight so let's
[8:57] just um come at the service of the world
[8:58] we'll stand up and we'll pray and then
[8:59] we'll send some praise songs heavenly
[9:02] father we're so grateful Lord that we
[9:04] can be gathered in your house this place
[9:06] Lord that we've set aside to worship You
[9:09] Lord and we want to invite you into our
[9:12] midst this evening Lord may you come in
[9:15] and speak to us in a special way tonight
[9:19] may each heart be attentive to the
[9:22] things of You Lord may we be sensitive
[9:23] to your spirit and set our minds on
[9:27] things above floor so much time of the
[9:29] day we have to just do these daily
[9:30] things Lord but it's just so nice to be
[9:33] here this evening and to really focus
[9:35] all of our attention on you Lord in to
[9:37] lay hold upon eternal life this evening
[9:39] so we Lord will run a great expectation
[9:42] that you would meet with us Lord we know
[9:44] that we Lord we're just mortal men and
[9:46] woman we we as we get on we realize that
[9:49] we don't have much to offer Lord but
[9:51] when we just let you move in our life
[9:53] and when we let you take control of our
[9:55] life Lord that's when things change and
[9:57] that's when things happen Lord so that's
[9:58] our desire this evening Lord is that you
[10:00] would take over Lord in it and that we
[10:03] would just lay at your feet sit at your
[10:05] feet this evening and learn from you
[10:06] Lord and let you let you have the full
[10:08] control of the service and that your
[10:11] perfect world will be done this evening
[10:12] so we just pray in Jesus name Amen
[10:15] I mean least that was number 107 though
[10:18] I first it in a barren land of sin and
[10:20] shame and nothing satisfying there I
[10:23] found but to the Blessed cross of Christ
[10:25] one day I came with Springs of a living
[10:28] water that abounds amen
[10:31] Arthur stood in a barren land of sin and
[10:36] shame
[10:36] and nothing says my hair I found

[36:08] conditions of our hearts you knew
[36:11] everything and planning and maybe come

[36:44] little bit of understanding a little bit

[37:29] word come alive come alive in us so we
[37:33] can express you in the name of Jesus we
[37:36] pray
[37:36] amen thank you all check one another and
[37:42] say god bless you
[37:43] I'd rather thanks god bless you that's
[37:45] all the music we're going to have
[37:46] Wednesday night weekday service
[37:49] sometimes you can't keep too long so I'm
[37:51] going to do my best
[37:53] appreciate the musicians
[38:05] so if you have your Bibles so trying to
[38:08] find the mind of Christ for tonight I
[38:15] don't have to be here I was telling your
[38:19] pastor I didn't plan to even come to New
[38:21] Zealand let alone to Wellington
[38:23] my daughter got me into it she wanted to
[38:27] come to New Zealand so bad one year
[38:29] doubt she heard I was going to Melbourne
[38:31] so I told her that George Smith and
[38:33] better Tony admin well I might go to New
[38:36] Zealand who can I contact there and then
[38:39] on and on and on and I'm hopping through
[38:41] all that so I've been to Milwaukee is
[38:44] that what you call it been to Auckland
[38:48] and I was seeing Stratfor last night
[38:52] so tonight I'm passing through here but
[38:57] let it not be me passing through here
[38:59] that would be Jesus passing through so I
[39:02] want to give bring greetings for my
[39:04] family in Chicago we have a little
[39:07] assembly there and do the work of a
[39:10] pasta because my heart is really in the
[39:12] mission fields I spent more time in
[39:15] Africa especially the Muslim world when
[39:19] Morocco and me J and Mari last year and
[39:22] we are planning to go to China and other
[39:24] places so I just desired to somehow do
[39:30] something that will bring in the last we
[39:34] enjoying life you are little boy or girl
[39:37] going to school you want to get there
[39:38] get married have a big house but a world
[39:41] is so much in chaos that if even we live
[39:45] longer we don't know what state of mind
[39:48] we will be and so our prayer should be
[39:51] that Lord come quick so tonight let it
[39:54] be Christ speaking to you tonight I want
[39:58] us to go to the scripture and turn with
[40:04] me to 1
[40:10] there's a a verse that we're going to
[40:14] read in the book
[40:16] just after Timothy is called fire lemon
[40:18] fire lemon or Philemon
[40:21] how do you pronounce that Philemon okay
[40:25] so you go to Timothy you go to Titus
[40:29] then you go to Philemon it's just a joy
[40:32] to be here for you I wish there's a
[40:35] couple more nights because when you miss
[40:38] somebody for the first time we sized
[40:39] each other anything I say it could go
[40:41] you think about it wrongly so I'm going
[40:44] to sustain the Scriptures myself I can
[40:47] because we don't know each other and
[40:49] there's too many evil spirits flying
[40:52] around preaching about that suppose idol
[40:54] preaching the gospel so we just want to
[40:56] stay in the way as close as we can so if
[41:00] you have fire lemon fire lemon I'm just
[41:04] going to read verse 1 and this that's 1
[41:10] and 9 and take a lot of thought so verse
[41:17] 1 says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[41:22] and Timothy our brother on to Philemon
[41:26] of Philemon our dearly beloved and
[41:29] fellow laborer and if you jump to verse
[41:32] 9
[41:33] yet for love's sake I rather beseech
[41:36] thee be such an one as Paul the aged and
[41:39] now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[41:43] so I want to take a little thought in a
[41:51] message once more Lord the RAM said you
[41:59] are going to be somebody's prisoner you
[42:03] don't belong to yourself you are
[42:07] somebody's prisoner you are either a
[42:10] prisoner of the devil knowing this truth
[42:13] and won't surrender to it
[42:17] or a prisoner to God as you surrender to
[42:22] the way you are either the devil's
[42:25] prisoner to sin or you are God's
[42:28] prisoner to righteousness
[42:30] you are one or the other so tonight I
[42:35] want to take a thought as God expresses
[42:38] through my heart whose prison are you
[42:43] are you really God's prisoner then you
[42:46] have to be really surrender to this
[42:48] truth if you are not surrender to it
[42:52] there's no middle ground you know some
[42:54] things you want a great area we call it
[42:55] there's no gray area in walk to God you
[42:59] are either the prisoner of God or
[43:00] prisoner of the devil and many times in
[43:05] our mind we convince ourselves who we
[43:07] are but our works and the things that we
[43:10] believe display is what we really are so
[43:14] tonight I want to challenge you as we go
[43:17] to the Bible and the message if you
[43:21] don't find yourself a total prisoner you
[43:25] don't find yourself a prisoner of God in
[43:28] your heart pray and cry to God Lord I
[43:30] want to be your prisoner Lord I want to
[43:33] be your prisoner Lord I want to be your
[43:36] prisoner
[43:36] let's pray again Lord Jesus tonight
[43:38] that's our desire show us in a mirror
[43:43] how and where and where we lack and let
[43:47] your spirit not only convict us but
[43:49] bring us to your presence that you will
[43:51] perform your work in our lives in Jesus
[43:54] name we pray amen
[43:57] please be seated as I said I have only
[44:00] one service so if it doesn't go well I
[44:03] probably don't have to come back again
[44:07] I'll just stick to Australia but we are
[44:14] not here to get a name there's no
[44:17] greater name like Jesus Christ the name
[44:20] of William Brown is there but Jesus
[44:22] Christ is above all and so we have to
[44:24] always look at it
[44:26] so this subject of being a prisoner is
[44:29] really difficult because many times we
[44:35] go to church regularly so we can call
[44:39] ourselves a prisoner many times we do
[44:42] many things that we don't understand but
[44:45] it looks like we're doing the right
[44:46] thing but when we talk about a prison I
[44:48] don't think anybody has been in jail yet
[44:51] we are all too young to get into jail oh
[44:54] you've been in jail before
[44:56] oh no jail is not a right place to be if
[45:03] you read the books and the stories of
[45:05] people who end up in jail you don't have
[45:10] the chance to eat your fish and chips so
[45:12] what you want is what the jailor will
[45:14] give you and they open a little hole and
[45:17] throw a cup of water in there for you
[45:20] and you got to live with it your toilet
[45:23] facilities is just by your bed if you
[45:26] are good enough in Chains you are taken
[45:29] to a room to do your thing when they
[45:31] release you for about an hour every day
[45:34] you feel controlled you feel locked up
[45:39] you feel that you don't have your own
[45:42] liberty so for power to coin self Paul a
[45:48] prisoner of Jesus Christ there is
[45:50] something that Paul is talking about
[45:52] that maybe we haven't come to because
[45:56] working with God is a different matter
[46:00] it's not your thoughts of following your
[46:03] parents or following a message but it's
[46:06] a work that comes with a price that
[46:09] works means you get to a point where you
[46:14] don't do anything except what God wants
[46:16] you to do that's what means to become a
[46:19] prisoner
[46:20] Paul had an ambition she was a trained
[46:23] lawyer he was very religious he had all
[46:27] his stuff together till when there was a
[46:31] time that people were claiming there was
[46:34] a man called Jesus Christ he had
[46:37] disciples on the Sabbath day they were
[46:39] cutting food and doing everything to
[46:42] disobey the commandments that Moses laid
[46:45] down Paul being a strict Jew a Pharisee
[46:50] looked at it and said you people are
[46:53] desecrating the Word of God
[46:56] so you took on himself to persecute the
[47:00] Christians because he was committed to
[47:03] something many times we are not
[47:05] committed to anything we just follow
[47:06] blindly but on the way to Damascus on
[47:12] the way to bring get all the stuff to
[47:15] persecute them he met Christ and that
[47:18] changed him completely changed his
[47:21] ambition changed everything that Paul
[47:24] ever thought he was going to do because
[47:27] there is a meeting God will meet you
[47:31] because that's what will bring a change
[47:33] many times the chain hasn't happened and
[47:35] will claim and put a microphone on it
[47:38] and claim so many things God brings a
[47:42] change if this message that you claim
[47:45] you believe hasn't brought a change you
[47:47] haven't got it you can claim it as much
[47:49] as you want your claim doesn't count
[47:51] it's what God testifies that counts and
[47:55] so you have Paul now all of a sudden he
[47:58] was changed so much that the disciples
[48:00] were even afraid of him he was they were
[48:04] afraid of him but Paul got to a point
[48:07] where prophecy didn't move him if
[48:10] somebody prophesied to date tomorrow
[48:14] you're going to have an accident so
[48:15] don't go to Christ Church or something
[48:18] we induce a wonderful God has confirmed
[48:23] what I didn't want to do anyway so I'm
[48:25] not going but one great Prophet Agabus
[48:29] one day he walked there and took pause
[48:32] garments
[48:33] and say whoever has this there's a big
[48:35] persecution coming don't go to Jerusalem
[48:38] now poorer by condition knew God was
[48:41] sending today so it's not prophecy that
[48:44] makes us do what God wants us to do it's
[48:47] not a quote that you have to see before
[48:49] you realize God said prophet said I
[48:51] shouldn't cut my hair it's not a
[48:53] prophecy but something in you will
[48:55] confirm to you what you need to do those
[48:58] codes and prophecies may come and
[49:00] confirm it but even when they come and
[49:03] they don't confirm the way he said
[49:04] praise God for that confirmation but why
[49:07] why not die for him so poor disobeyed
[49:11] everybody and went to Jerusalem and if
[49:14] you read all the commentaries they said
[49:16] haw ruin his ministry by disobeying that
[49:20] prophecy but he took a profit in this
[49:23] age to come and said you know Paul was
[49:27] in jail in ships locked up he couldn't
[49:33] preach for all those two and a half
[49:35] years but why he was there he was
[49:38] thinking about the Corinthians that is
[49:40] preached so he wrote a letter to them he
[49:44] was thinking about the Galatians all
[49:46] foolish Galatians wrote a letter to them
[49:48] he was thinking about Titus he was
[49:51] thinking about Philemon if Paul did not
[49:54] go to Jerusalem we want to have the New
[49:56] Testament but Paul didn't even know what
[50:02] was happening to him but he was writing
[50:04] all these letters that we can go back so
[50:06] we can know how to have communion so we
[50:09] can know how to have bishops so we can
[50:11] know all these things so our life I
[50:15] still haven't got my subject our life is
[50:17] predetermined amen
[50:20] I'm not sure whether this country is a
[50:23] cricket country or soccer country or
[50:25] football but I have lived in I'm
[50:27] originally from Africa Ghana so soccer
[50:30] is important but have you ever watched a
[50:34] recorded play or recorded game before
[50:38] it's pre-recorded and you don't know
[50:43] this course and you know why you are
[50:46] watching
[50:46] prerecorded game maybe between Australia
[50:49] and New Zealand you are all charged up
[50:52] sometimes you forget is prerecorded goal
[50:57] and you throw your hand well it's
[50:59] already done you can't change it I want
[51:04] to tell you tonight the Prophet said
[51:06] your life was pre-planned before the
[51:10] foundation of the world was laid the
[51:13] devil can change your life even God can
[51:16] change your life because then God is
[51:19] changing his thoughts about you he can
[51:22] do it he laid it all before the
[51:24] foundation of the world and saw you
[51:27] walking in it even today till tonight he
[51:31] knew what clothes you away you didn't
[51:34] need a pastor to tell you you know wear
[51:36] a red skirt or a shed or something but
[51:39] the Spirit of God is in you something
[51:42] trances you I'm going to change this is
[51:45] not for change this is for change this
[51:48] is how long I want to look to present
[51:49] myself and on and on and on and then you
[51:52] come in and then you know he knows
[51:54] exactly where you are going to sit and
[51:56] you sit there tonight your life is all
[51:59] pre-recorded many times we make a
[52:02] mistake thinking I'm going to change it
[52:03] no you can't change it and so the
[52:05] predestinated of God are predestinated
[52:08] to walk in his counsel and his way and
[52:12] that's all that we do so every day your
[52:15] life is to come to a point say Lord
[52:17] where do I go from here because don't
[52:21] you see the Bible says the steps of the
[52:23] righteous are honored your steps are
[52:25] ordered so tonight God has ordered our
[52:28] steps to get together so being a
[52:31] prisoner means you've gotten to a point
[52:33] where you wait for God to tell you what
[52:37] to do you move when God makes you move
[52:40] and pour how to get to that point in his
[52:43] life that all the disciples in my ear
[52:46] Peter say Peter prisoner of Jesus Christ
[52:49] he never said John or might you say a
[52:52] prisoner of Jesus Christ but I haven't
[52:54] after having a real revelation Paul saw
[52:57] that his life was not his
[53:00] his life was Christ's life that he is
[53:03] living a portion of Christ's life that
[53:07] he said for him to live and so he looked
[53:11] at himself and said Paul a prisoner it's
[53:13] not what you say that will change what I
[53:16] have to do for God is what God will
[53:19] enable me to do that's what makes the
[53:21] difference so to be a prisoner for
[53:23] Christ has a very strong meaning and
[53:27] Paul admonishes us when you get a chance
[53:30] there's two tips I'd like you to listen
[53:32] to one is called oneness another one is
[53:36] called Paul a prisoner so we're going to
[53:38] try to the next 30 45 minutes try to
[53:42] focus on it a little bit because unless
[53:45] you become a prisoner of Christ
[53:47] you can't live this message you can't
[53:51] live for Christ after a while school job
[53:56] marriage money something is going to
[53:59] come in the way some of us are old
[54:02] enough you know I dye my hair a little
[54:04] bit that's why I don't see the gray hair
[54:05] but we've been in a message saying 72
[54:08] and we've seen the impact and we've seen
[54:13] how people have also gone back and forth
[54:15] so when I see a young group like that
[54:17] I'm so excited
[54:18] there's a next generation for this
[54:19] message part of my heart I won't go to
[54:22] today part of my heart I want him to
[54:24] come quickly because I feel every
[54:27] generation has something to fulfill we
[54:30] have done our part and you are going to
[54:32] carry the next part but Paul brings us
[54:36] to the top topic of being a prisoner and
[54:40] I want to so I'll be bringing in quotes
[54:42] here and there yes so that we can build
[54:44] on it the first one I want to talk about
[54:49] before we go deeper it says we are all
[54:52] born a free moral agent any decision
[54:57] that we wish to God has given us to make
[55:01] it and because every man is on the same
[55:04] based like Adam and Eve we have to make
[55:08] our decisions so let's learn one first
[55:11] principle
[55:12] God would never make a decision for you
[55:16] you might say mom dad make a decision
[55:19] for me choose my school choose my
[55:21] husband choose this god never does if he
[55:25] does it then he has to wake up Adam and
[55:26] Eve and ask for forgiveness he created
[55:30] Adam and Eve put them on on the same
[55:33] level as you and I gave them a choice
[55:38] Adam had a choice Eve had a choice you
[55:43] have a choice I have a choice and God
[55:47] will never make the choice for us but
[55:49] you always presented to us and give us
[55:52] the tools to make the right choice but
[55:54] when you get there whether you make a
[55:57] choice on the business of God's Word or
[55:59] you make a choice because there was
[56:01] something flashy because you are afraid
[56:03] that's where we face a lot of
[56:06] consequences so first remember God will
[56:11] always bring you to a point that you
[56:12] have to make a choice a choice of who
[56:15] you want to be a choice of who you want
[56:18] to marry a choice of school parents will
[56:21] influence you a little bit but there are
[56:23] many times you get to a point it's like
[56:25] driving you make a choice to turn left
[56:27] or right you make a choice to right
[56:29] drive through a yellow light you make a
[56:31] choice and as human beings often when we
[56:33] make a choice and it doesn't work we
[56:35] like to find somebody to blame in my in
[56:38] my growing up the lady in the village
[56:41] caused all the troubles in this message
[56:45] you saw the pasta oh it's all a tape or
[56:49] a quote I didn't find but the choice is
[56:52] yours and this afternoon I read a quote
[56:56] to your past and I want to read it as we
[56:58] get started give me a second because
[57:00] with that it helps us to come to see
[57:04] that our choice our choice is really not
[57:08] our choices go just give me a second I'm
[57:10] just getting this on so in this message
[57:15] faith
[57:19] Moses I'm going to read a portion 58 or
[57:23] 720 I want you to listen carefully he
[57:31] says there is a choosing and we choose
[57:35] for ourselves we choose something for
[57:38] our own good
[57:39] but Moses chose their afflictions and
[57:42] disgrace that he might walk with the
[57:44] people of God think of it
[57:46] now listen choose the afflictions of the
[57:50] people of God and counted it greater
[57:53] treasure for he and yet seeing him who
[57:55] was invisible so a lot one time had to
[57:58] make a choice we all remember the story
[58:00] of Lord and it may be this morning that
[58:04] there will be men and women sitting here
[58:05] that will make your final choice so now
[58:08] listen carefully you are today what you
[58:11] are because several years ago you chose
[58:18] to be what you are now and what you
[58:21] choose now will determine what you will
[58:24] be five years from today should I read
[58:28] it again what you choose now will
[58:32] determine what will be five years from
[58:35] today
[58:42] five years from today you may be a
[58:44] missionary five years from today you may
[58:47] be a renowned Christian or five years
[58:49] from today you may be in hell because
[58:52] you made a wrong decision five years
[58:56] from today he may be cleaning splittings
[58:57] in a ballroom five years from today you
[58:59] may be a prostitute on the street or you
[59:02] may be a man or woman that's a credit to
[59:04] any society because of your choice of
[59:07] Christ five years from today you may be
[59:10] in glory and now he says you are what
[59:13] you are today
[59:15] because of a choice you made five years
[59:17] ago so when I read something like this I
[59:21] want to make a note of my choices
[59:22] there's few that you can and work on it
[59:25] and put it on a wall and see yourself
[59:27] five years from today so five years from
[59:31] today the choices we made comes into
[59:34] existence in our life fast forward so
[59:38] many things that come to us sometimes we
[59:41] don't know where it came from
[59:43] it's all based on the choices you can
[59:46] choose to serve Christ or choose not to
[59:50] serve Christ choose to go to school or
[59:53] not choose to go to school so God has
[59:55] given us that freedom it's yours the
[59:59] moment you bound a human being you have
[1:00:01] that choice children have that choice
[1:00:04] when they are young adults we can guide
[1:00:06] you but you get to a point where you're
[1:00:09] going to choose a husband and wife a job
[1:00:10] and all that and choose to follow Christ
[1:00:14] there are things that affect us so to be
[1:00:18] a prisoner means you've got to a point
[1:00:21] where your choice is what God's where it
[1:00:24] says you must do it's a tough one it's a
[1:00:30] tough one would you say that God's Word
[1:00:34] says I must go to church I'll go to
[1:00:37] church every day there'll be times you
[1:00:38] hit church he don't like the music you
[1:00:41] don't like the preacher the church is
[1:00:45] too far your car is broken down it's
[1:00:48] costing you too much cars and too much
[1:00:50] effort I would rather be somewhere so to
[1:00:54] be a prisoner means you got to a point
[1:00:55] where
[1:00:56] you surrender your choice you turn it
[1:00:59] all upside down and said what does God
[1:01:01] say about it and sometimes you stick
[1:01:04] only to the Bible you might end up with
[1:01:06] an interpretation for the denominations
[1:01:08] or somebody so you said what does the
[1:01:11] Bible say about it in light of the
[1:01:13] message of today because you are
[1:01:16] prisoner being a prisoner means you've
[1:01:20] gotten to a point where it's not what
[1:01:23] your pastor says it's not what you find
[1:01:25] a code but something in you drives you
[1:01:28] to do what you are doing and people will
[1:01:32] turn around and say oh I have the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost I have news for you the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] if it doesn't lead you to live this life
[1:01:40] I don't care how much you speak in
[1:01:43] tongues I don't matter how how much you
[1:01:45] see prophecies I don't know I don't care
[1:01:48] whatever you can lay on because it's a
[1:01:50] life it's God spirit in you producing
[1:01:53] God through you and if you don't live
[1:01:55] that life don't cram it just say Lord
[1:01:59] I'm not there yet I want to be there
[1:02:01] help me help me help me
[1:02:03] and so here by ramming the same message
[1:02:06] a prisoner says always don't judge your
[1:02:09] life by how much power you have to
[1:02:12] perform miracles and we don't judge
[1:02:14] ourselves by how much knowledge you have
[1:02:16] in the way but always judge yourself
[1:02:19] look back take inventory and see what
[1:02:23] kind of fruit you are bearing I can stop
[1:02:27] right here I hope I like you more amen
[1:02:30] you already you already could give me
[1:02:32] out tonight yes I'm amen amen
[1:02:40] you know seven God is the easiest yet is
[1:02:45] the most challenging if you don't get to
[1:02:48] a point where God has to do it you are
[1:02:51] not there yet
[1:02:53] like Jesus always said is God doing it
[1:02:57] through me and it's astroturf I'll tell
[1:03:01] you I've been in a message seven you
[1:03:02] know since 72 there are times I thought
[1:03:05] God was doing it then I find out I was
[1:03:07] doing
[1:03:08] at times I thought God was doing it but
[1:03:13] then I look at myself oh this is
[1:03:15] difficult
[1:03:16] how could I do it and then I do it I
[1:03:19] come back and I said how did I do it it
[1:03:22] was good
[1:03:23] is sometimes easier sometimes you see
[1:03:26] after the fact whether you did it or God
[1:03:29] did it because the Prophet also said God
[1:03:34] always testify he always backs his way
[1:03:36] so if God is doing it you stand by it
[1:03:40] so Paul after working with God for all
[1:03:43] this time prophecies didn't movie quotes
[1:03:50] didn't move him because he had got into
[1:03:53] a stage where he knew you can prophesy
[1:03:57] Paul you are going to die tomorrow
[1:03:58] praise God
[1:04:00] death where is your sting you can
[1:04:04] prophesy a poor don't go to Jerusalem
[1:04:06] well the same God that came to me that I
[1:04:10] should go to Jerusalem it doesn't mean
[1:04:12] your prophecy is false
[1:04:14] of course God is probably one in me but
[1:04:17] we sometimes get to a point where we are
[1:04:19] so paranoid till we want God to say
[1:04:21] something to confirm what we are doing
[1:04:23] so we don't do it we want a quote to
[1:04:26] confirm what we want to do so we can say
[1:04:30] I found a quote and when we find a cord
[1:04:32] that we don't really like it then we say
[1:04:34] but around may be said it from himself
[1:04:37] didn't know this edge and the stage will
[1:04:40] be in and all the excuses we can give I
[1:04:44] tell you tonight you are not doing it
[1:04:47] when you get there you'll be doing
[1:04:50] something that you find a quote he says
[1:04:52] I wonder why I was doing this now here
[1:04:54] is a quote that confirms what I'm
[1:04:56] hearing so tonight I want you to bring
[1:04:58] you a little bit closer
[1:05:00] no to butter brown bar to Jesus Christ
[1:05:02] because Jesus is what is going to make a
[1:05:05] difference in our life he's the one that
[1:05:07] is going to make a difference in your
[1:05:09] home a difference in this church and the
[1:05:12] more you bring him in the more you will
[1:05:16] see him so being a priest
[1:05:20] we'll look at some little implications
[1:05:23] and then take a little bit of examples
[1:05:26] Paul had an ambition but he got to a
[1:05:30] point where Paul and his ambition where
[1:05:33] all we're all completely surrendered to
[1:05:39] God Paul got to a point where he looked
[1:05:45] at himself with all the education his
[1:05:47] mind every day is what can I do for God
[1:05:49] next to get to that mentality it's like
[1:05:55] not you are not living in this world you
[1:05:58] get up in the morning I'm going to work
[1:05:59] yes I have to be at work to pay my bills
[1:06:03] but Lord what can I do today how can I
[1:06:07] walk in your world today how can you I
[1:06:10] be a blessing today when you get to that
[1:06:12] point where your everything your mind is
[1:06:16] on that then you know you are making
[1:06:19] progress it's not when you do something
[1:06:21] you come about all Lord I should have
[1:06:24] done it God will forgive you but we have
[1:06:27] to come to a point where this is what we
[1:06:29] must do and this is what we do let me
[1:06:33] take a few examples because examples
[1:06:36] always establishes that thought how many
[1:06:40] have read the story of Samson he read a
[1:06:44] story you remember Samson Judges chapter
[1:06:48] 15 and 16 you can mark it down Samson
[1:06:54] was raised
[1:06:55] I said Nazareth God raised him because
[1:07:00] Israel was in trouble and God wanted to
[1:07:03] use something to bring deliverance and
[1:07:08] we learned that a prophet said he was a
[1:07:10] little man he wasn't probably as big as
[1:07:13] me and it was such a miraculous power
[1:07:17] that will come on Samson that he can
[1:07:19] take the job all born upon us and kill
[1:07:23] thousands it was Joe it was he was so
[1:07:27] powerful when the Spirit of God comes to
[1:07:29] him
[1:07:30] and we want to get to that point but
[1:07:34] there was something a little something
[1:07:36] has never done he had not certain that
[1:07:39] he's had to go so God can use you God
[1:07:48] can use you to bring even people save
[1:07:52] people and you still have me surrender
[1:07:54] to Christ so Sampson was such a great
[1:07:57] man everybody was afraid of him
[1:07:59] but he got to a point because his head
[1:08:01] was not surrendered he kept doing the
[1:08:04] wrong thing he kept everything that
[1:08:08] something thought about was vile in his
[1:08:11] heart he started going after woman we
[1:08:14] all know the Bible you would think with
[1:08:19] all that power of God she represented
[1:08:21] him he had a choice the choice was to
[1:08:25] give his heart completely to God he
[1:08:28] didn't do it he kept on and on and on he
[1:08:30] found beautiful lady Delilah
[1:08:33] that's all that I want that's fine
[1:08:38] the Spirit of God was still day you tell
[1:08:41] Delilah I let him tie my hands with a
[1:08:43] rope they will come and the power of God
[1:08:46] will fall again and it was still living
[1:08:49] in sin that moyson was there that
[1:08:55] anointing can still be in the message on
[1:08:57] the coat and we can still live in sin no
[1:08:59] Holy Ghost and that was the life of
[1:09:04] Samson it went on and on and on and on
[1:09:07] until the very thing that God raised
[1:09:11] Samson to help the people overcome
[1:09:14] overcame Samson yeah till one day he
[1:09:18] told a story I was born in Nazareth you
[1:09:22] know since a child no Caesar has got my
[1:09:25] head Delilah felt now he's told me the
[1:09:28] truth he took razor shared his hair
[1:09:32] Samson the Philistines are upon you
[1:09:35] there was no power and you might think
[1:09:38] how does the hair connect with that
[1:09:42] you see we live we live in different
[1:09:44] dimensions there are a lot of things in
[1:09:47] this dimension that connects with our
[1:09:50] other life and so when your path is
[1:09:53] written I said women don't cut your hair
[1:09:55] he's gonna against you because if you
[1:09:58] read a word of god the head is a woman's
[1:10:01] glory why would you desecrate your glory
[1:10:05] now will you take a scissor and trim it
[1:10:07] just leave it
[1:10:09] I know it's fashionable to look like the
[1:10:11] other friend or some movie star but you
[1:10:14] are not a movie star you have another
[1:10:16] word Val
[1:10:20] so something toward another Shelby said
[1:10:25] now when the Philistines were upon
[1:10:28] something the Power had disappeared how
[1:10:32] will it come back so I keep saying this
[1:10:37] that the devil is not smart because they
[1:10:41] were looking for what is trendlines Nadi
[1:10:43] founded don't you think they should have
[1:10:45] bought all the reasons in the world and
[1:10:47] every morning shave something two or
[1:10:49] three times a day after every shower
[1:10:52] shave something shave something
[1:10:56] chef Sampson don't make sure there's not
[1:10:59] even one hair coming on his head because
[1:11:01] they found the solution to Samson's
[1:11:03] friend and that's why the devil does
[1:11:06] he's always looking for a solution to
[1:11:08] attack your life maybe your prayer life
[1:11:12] the friends you you keep the whatsapp
[1:11:15] messages and YouTube and all those
[1:11:18] things they affect your faith now we'll
[1:11:21] do it and the devil is trying more
[1:11:23] lifeline to awesome eventually he gets
[1:11:26] us in a corner he locks herself so if
[1:11:29] you don't get it
[1:11:31] what's up message in one day you are
[1:11:33] nervous why am I not getting anything
[1:11:36] he's got you are dicta to it you are
[1:11:39] like something in jail I was what's up
[1:11:44] when you were born I was a phone call or
[1:11:48] YouTube or Facebook because the devil oh
[1:11:53] I didn't read it
[1:11:55] he says God likes to make prisoners of
[1:12:00] people he wants to use and the devil
[1:12:04] also likes to do the same the our
[1:12:07] methods are different God wants to make
[1:12:09] you a prisoner by your choice the devil
[1:12:13] want to force you into request you and
[1:12:15] put a stamp on you so you can't get out
[1:12:18] so here was something that's so powerful
[1:12:20] man of God that everybody was afraid of
[1:12:23] now Samson and when the devil gets you
[1:12:27] he's going to remove your eyes he's
[1:12:29] going to take away your understanding
[1:12:31] he's going to blunt you
[1:12:33] so they took Samson's eyes am i reading
[1:12:35] the Bible and the man that has all the
[1:12:39] power now that power is being used to
[1:12:41] grind some milling meal or some corn or
[1:12:44] something because the devil is doing the
[1:12:48] same to us the power of the message the
[1:12:51] power of that shed the power of God now
[1:12:53] we just get it so distorted and that's
[1:13:00] because we are not prisoners yet so
[1:13:03] something became a laughingstock
[1:13:07] sometimes I think when people laugh at
[1:13:09] us
[1:13:10] we are exhibiting not a gospel but a
[1:13:14] hybrid life that we will see we are fake
[1:13:19] you you claim you a basic believer you
[1:13:22] on Facebook like me so what's the
[1:13:24] difference you are what's up like me
[1:13:26] it's just going to church that's what is
[1:13:29] the difference but there has to be a
[1:13:31] difference which is the life of God
[1:13:34] through us so now something when the
[1:13:39] devil get you
[1:13:40] Samson's eyes were gone but watch was
[1:13:45] there the Prophet said every day Lord
[1:13:48] forgive me I failed
[1:13:50] he was grinding the stuff Lord forgive
[1:13:52] me I failed I failed and slowly as he
[1:13:56] was I don't know how many years or weeks
[1:13:59] or something he was free confessing his
[1:14:02] fault and his hair was growing end of it
[1:14:06] there was a party and they thought oh
[1:14:08] today
[1:14:09] we are going to showcase we're going to
[1:14:12] demonstrate something so they brought
[1:14:14] something but they didn't know something
[1:14:16] has been confessing his self they didn't
[1:14:19] know Sampson has repented they didn't
[1:14:22] know Sampson now has become a prisoner
[1:14:26] so they brought Samson out they thought
[1:14:31] they were going to have a display and
[1:14:33] Samson whispers to that little boy and
[1:14:35] said show me put my one hand to a pillar
[1:14:38] and the other one to the other pillar I
[1:14:40] want to feel it so they always looked at
[1:14:42] something and he has something if you
[1:14:45] read I believe judges 16:30 or something
[1:14:47] he said Lord let me die with my enemy
[1:14:50] the professor that's the time he reached
[1:14:53] total prisoner he got to a point where I
[1:14:57] want to just affect my enemy so much
[1:15:00] that if it costs my life
[1:15:02] let it be we have to get to a point
[1:15:05] where our life doesn't matter to us
[1:15:07] anymore only the life of Christ that
[1:15:09] matters
[1:15:12] Samson said let me die with my enemies
[1:15:14] so imagine a little man there's one till
[1:15:17] I hear one today is going to be the
[1:15:22] greatest performance better man because
[1:15:28] he's free because the committed himself
[1:15:31] to Christ and he could stretch one hand
[1:15:34] from here to the other hand I don't know
[1:15:36] how he did it
[1:15:37] but I believe the power of God and then
[1:15:40] he brought the whole Bil'in down the
[1:15:42] Bible says more people died on that day
[1:15:46] than he's ever done why was that the
[1:15:50] Prophet said God cannot use you until
[1:15:53] you become his prisoner he can't do it
[1:15:58] you might feel a goose bump you might
[1:16:01] have a pillar of fire you might do
[1:16:02] something but God wants to tap business
[1:16:05] that you can use he want to use you at
[1:16:08] home he want to use you at work you want
[1:16:10] to use you at school you have to be that
[1:16:13] point it's more than what you are doing
[1:16:16] today
[1:16:18] now something
[1:16:21] god never will fail God gives us the
[1:16:25] gifts but we can only come to their full
[1:16:28] maturity of that gift until we become
[1:16:31] full prisoners so on that day if you
[1:16:35] remember Samson's prayer maybe you don't
[1:16:37] believe it but I'll read it for you
[1:16:39] yeahjust is chapter 16 and Sampson West
[1:16:44] when she and Samson caught on to the
[1:16:45] Lord and said O Lord God remember me I
[1:16:48] pray thee strengthen me I pray thee only
[1:16:50] this one so God that I meet my baby once
[1:16:52] avenged of the Philistines for my two
[1:16:54] eyes fester 29 and Sampson took hold on
[1:16:58] the pillars on which the house stood on
[1:17:01] which it was born up one in his right
[1:17:03] hand and the other on his left hand was
[1:17:05] steady and Samson said let me die what
[1:17:10] I've reached a point where life doesn't
[1:17:13] mean much to me my life not my will but
[1:17:18] your work not my life but your life we
[1:17:23] don't have any life to live except the
[1:17:25] life of Christ and Sampson got to that
[1:17:28] point where steady and Sampson said let
[1:17:30] me die with the Philistines the Bible
[1:17:33] says and he bowed himself with all his
[1:17:35] might in the house fell upon the lords
[1:17:37] and I when all the people that were
[1:17:39] there so that dad which is true at his
[1:17:42] death
[1:17:42] we're more than they which he slew in
[1:17:45] his life we of course knows the message
[1:17:50] we of course go to change we of course
[1:17:52] pray we do everything but God is waiting
[1:17:55] yeah total surrender a tutor prisoner
[1:18:02] that it doesn't take somebody to get us
[1:18:06] to do God's work the church door doesn't
[1:18:11] have to be reminded something is driving
[1:18:15] you there
[1:18:16] this is Samson's life I wouldn't
[1:18:19] understand it but he took a prophet to
[1:18:22] look at Samson's life and said nothing
[1:18:24] could happen to Samson slime that was a
[1:18:27] credit until he gave himself to Christ
[1:18:29] and so you can see the same thing
[1:18:32] there's no power in the church because
[1:18:34] there's no
[1:18:36] commitment you come to church when you
[1:18:40] are able to when your favorite preacher
[1:18:43] is coming to preach or your favorite
[1:18:45] song leader is coming to leave songs or
[1:18:47] something whatever reason that that will
[1:18:49] give you but until you have a committed
[1:18:53] people in a church you can't even see
[1:18:55] the full power of God and and this
[1:18:59] message we are dying for Christ to come
[1:19:01] alive again we are dying to see the
[1:19:04] power of God again we are sit down to
[1:19:07] see the pillar of fire again let's get
[1:19:09] to that point where we have Christ in
[1:19:13] our mission because something in us
[1:19:15] tells us we are hungry I know it's easy
[1:19:20] to point to the Prophet how people were
[1:19:22] healed let me tell you the good news the
[1:19:26] same power is still here to do the same
[1:19:29] purify is still here he's waiting for a
[1:19:33] to attack commitment the Prophet made me
[1:19:35] sick but he had to get to a point where
[1:19:37] he was committed so when he pray and he
[1:19:39] stands there the pillar of fire will
[1:19:40] come wonderful that's the prophet today
[1:19:45] is the bride we are not draw much we are
[1:19:51] the Bride of Christ I'm hungry for
[1:19:58] Christ so much and when I go and I see
[1:20:01] his people he said whatever two or three
[1:20:03] I gathered every day I am expecting him
[1:20:06] I'm expecting him oh I can take so many
[1:20:09] other people I could take Moses let's
[1:20:11] take a few minutes on Moses you remember
[1:20:13] Moses he was born a proper child a
[1:20:16] bright cold trained he knew who he was
[1:20:22] he was a deliverer so much power that
[1:20:27] Moses could go and you know go to
[1:20:29] Pharaoh he seems to Egyptians fight him
[1:20:32] you can kill one and then he got to a
[1:20:36] point where they were after Moses when
[1:20:41] you have totally given yourself to
[1:20:44] Christ you can never be a cow
[1:20:46] because the Lord fights your battles so
[1:20:49] now Moses run into the hills and now
[1:20:51] he's a shepherd and everyday he'll be
[1:20:54] heading the ship you look up there he
[1:20:56] sees the light fire burning big fire and
[1:21:02] the bush is not bad he kept doing that
[1:21:04] for one year two years three years 14
[1:21:10] years till one day he said okay I'm
[1:21:15] gonna see what it is so he went there
[1:21:20] see why do I'm not completely
[1:21:22] surrendered to God you even brought on
[1:21:24] holy ground and don't know it you don't
[1:21:28] even know one crashes amongst you so he
[1:21:32] goes there and he says Moses move your
[1:21:34] shoes he looks around who is speaking to
[1:21:36] me well I'll get my shoes anyhow and see
[1:21:40] what is next now God had to talk to him
[1:21:44] so Moses that finally he says they won't
[1:21:49] believe me said I'll give you three
[1:21:51] signs
[1:21:51] throw your stick on there he did tennis
[1:21:54] snake said hold it by the bat by the
[1:21:56] tail and he did 10 and Moses now had all
[1:21:58] the signs wonderful and finally said
[1:22:02] Lord do you think God he makes mistakes
[1:22:08] I think don't you think so
[1:22:10] how could you select somebody who is of
[1:22:12] a slow speech III grew I went to school
[1:22:15] with people who has Tamara slow speech
[1:22:17] that's what if the Prophet said it means
[1:22:19] so when they want to say something it
[1:22:23] takes more energy than the way that will
[1:22:25] come out so you can take Moses goes to
[1:22:30] the Jews and he has to tell Pharaoh let
[1:22:34] my people go
[1:22:35] took him probably five minutes to let
[1:22:37] those three words come out
[1:22:43] Moose's what are you saying let okay so
[1:22:48] let what my mama and that is God's
[1:22:51] prophet but before he went he told God
[1:23:00] God I miss Tamra how could I do it God
[1:23:03] said who made your mouth see God knows
[1:23:08] how to do it if God took a preacher like
[1:23:10] me I'll be preaching to Pharaoh I'll
[1:23:14] have a long sermon three hours because I
[1:23:17] know the power of God but God knew who
[1:23:20] he wanted so he was saying exactly
[1:23:25] and everybody was looking God and his
[1:23:29] choices that's why God chose you they
[1:23:33] didn't choose you because you are better
[1:23:35] looking than somebody he chooses you
[1:23:38] with infirmities that will confirm that
[1:23:40] he is God because he only gets all the
[1:23:45] glory you didn't get part of it he gets
[1:23:48] all the glory so people look at Moses
[1:23:51] but Moses could not go because at that
[1:23:56] time 40 years ago he wasn't surrounded
[1:23:59] but a professor when he came to that
[1:24:01] point that he was a prisoner 9 he went
[1:24:06] there with a staff in his hand
[1:24:09] I hope this man knows what he's doing he
[1:24:15] knew it he had more than that says the
[1:24:18] Lord he spoke to God live to hear God
[1:24:24] can speak to him directly mostly say
[1:24:26] this and Moses is struggling to say it
[1:24:29] and man is wondering what is he trying
[1:24:32] to say and when he became a prisoner the
[1:24:37] Prophet said he caught so much all his
[1:24:40] courage or his friend all his energy was
[1:24:44] all gone - anytime there is any
[1:24:47] confrontation who say God now these
[1:24:50] people are laughing at me what should I
[1:24:52] do
[1:24:53] these people are crying they need
[1:24:56] help what should I do they need water
[1:24:58] why should I do
[1:24:59] and Moses kept doing that today even God
[1:25:03] has to tell him why cry speak he
[1:25:09] sometimes became so delinquent because
[1:25:12] he just wants to hear that voice and we
[1:25:15] had a voice of God and we are fed up oh
[1:25:17] my goodness they got you now yes to his
[1:25:20] voice Moses were so tuned I haven't got
[1:25:25] a head God's voice today I don't know
[1:25:27] what I'm doing
[1:25:29] he was so tuned that's being a prisoner
[1:25:32] I won't go to speak to me today he will
[1:25:37] but Moses he it was formed by the
[1:25:43] Prophet people for my life you know what
[1:25:46] I'm waiting for
[1:25:47] he with an angel of God told him you are
[1:25:50] limiting even your ministry to miracles
[1:25:53] pretty soon they won't believe you until
[1:25:55] they see a miracle because when you see
[1:25:58] you are totally CERN and you see the
[1:26:00] power of God you got to a point where
[1:26:02] you don't want it to even an inch be
[1:26:04] yourself you want it just to be in Moses
[1:26:10] for forty years God has to get all the
[1:26:15] self out of him before he could use him
[1:26:18] God has to get you out of yourself so he
[1:26:24] can use you you know we live the way
[1:26:29] even we are
[1:26:30] I picked the salmon I'll just be quick
[1:26:33] on that on God's gifts that I wrapped
[1:26:36] see God gives us gifts but the same God
[1:26:40] that gives us gifts like to wrap it for
[1:26:42] us and many times we'll get stuck in the
[1:26:45] wrapping the greatest gift the world had
[1:26:49] Jesus Christ was wrapped in a human
[1:26:52] being that was God wrapped in a human
[1:26:56] being and sometimes we are home
[1:26:58] mother-father
[1:26:59] God's gift wrapped in a human being
[1:27:01] sometimes we get on each other others
[1:27:04] they have so much because we are looking
[1:27:06] at a rapid
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:11] you got to look beyond the wrapping God
[1:27:17] will always wrap his gift in the words
[1:27:19] wrapping that you can ever get and if
[1:27:23] you are into Christmas gifts Christmas
[1:27:25] time you look at a wrapping I don't know
[1:27:27] I don't want to open it and then you
[1:27:29] open it and it's a surprise that gives
[1:27:33] in this church but God has wrapped it so
[1:27:36] we got to look beyond that our kids look
[1:27:39] beyond that look beyond the irritation
[1:27:42] because God will always wrap it in a
[1:27:45] human being I wish you wrap it in an
[1:27:47] angel that has no fault he would sneeze
[1:27:51] at the wrong time you get on your knife
[1:27:54] the way he eats the way he smacks the
[1:27:57] way he does everything tells you off but
[1:28:01] he's a gift of God you reject it you
[1:28:07] reject her God I said that for the pasta
[1:28:15] you might like not like him he's a
[1:28:18] little bit boisterous young boy I know
[1:28:20] that that's God's gift and new husband's
[1:28:26] and your wives those gifts and many
[1:28:31] times I have to remind myself oh that my
[1:28:34] wife Helen is God's gift oh he's got
[1:28:37] kids Scott gifts men to do something for
[1:28:40] me aha let me hold my thought I have a
[1:28:47] couple more minutes why do you become a
[1:28:51] prisoner you recognize God because he's
[1:28:56] always going to do something that you
[1:28:58] see and say this is beyond man's
[1:29:00] thinking so now if you give gifts wrap
[1:29:04] it in there the west place that you can
[1:29:07] God started wrapping gifts before mine
[1:29:09] everybody started thinking about it and
[1:29:12] so you look at the human being and you
[1:29:16] let it drive you away that's the same
[1:29:20] gift that you are rejected
[1:29:23] that's why Jesus - that says if you
[1:29:26] believe in me believe also in me in him
[1:29:30] the angel told by wrong if you can get
[1:29:32] them to believe in you nothing can stand
[1:29:35] against your prayer it was on him and so
[1:29:38] people have to go beyond the wrapping of
[1:29:41] William Brown and we can't go beyond it
[1:29:44] because we are being Conner but when we
[1:29:47] go beyond the wrapping of William Brown
[1:29:50] we can see Christ expressing it if we go
[1:29:55] beyond that we can see Christ expressing
[1:29:57] your children crisis pressing your
[1:29:59] husband crisis pressing your church then
[1:30:03] we are coming to a point where we are
[1:30:05] completely serene keeping our eyes on
[1:30:10] Christ oh I wanted to talk about Abraham
[1:30:14] but I will make it quick I wanted to
[1:30:18] talk about the prodigal son you know the
[1:30:22] story he started praying for his parent
[1:30:25] and father to die so he can inherit it
[1:30:26] quickly and when it's not happening he
[1:30:30] said that just give me my portion I just
[1:30:33] know what I'm going to do I'm a better
[1:30:34] investor than you see God has given us
[1:30:40] so much knowledge in this age that
[1:30:42] through the message we can go back and
[1:30:44] see what was wrong in their life to help
[1:30:48] us be better than them prodigal son and
[1:30:53] finally
[1:30:54] excuse me one day he woke up and said
[1:30:57] I'm going to my father's house
[1:31:01] his father was able to receive him we
[1:31:04] look at Luke chapter 8 it's a story that
[1:31:07] is read I've read many times I'm going
[1:31:09] to use that to just try to change
[1:31:11] everything God always has to take a man
[1:31:20] that will serve Him truly to be his
[1:31:21] prisoner
[1:31:22] a man has to surrender every ambition
[1:31:25] he's got everything he is everything in
[1:31:28] his life so body everything else to
[1:31:31] become a complete prisoner that's the
[1:31:34] only time God can use him so I'm
[1:31:38] learning everyday that lord if I may yet
[1:31:41] life and I don't become your prisoner
[1:31:43] you can't use so it doesn't matter what
[1:31:48] I've prepared what I've done I have to
[1:31:50] try and enter in and get to a point
[1:31:52] where because God knows what you need I
[1:31:54] don't know it and if I say anything for
[1:31:59] myself it will bear no fruit but if God
[1:32:01] says it I tell you from tonight you
[1:32:04] start making decisions that five years
[1:32:07] from now you will see the results
[1:32:10] because God is raisin a CD seed will
[1:32:13] never perish so if you have with me Luke
[1:32:16] chapter 8 I want to go quickly because
[1:32:18] time is not with us we did I'm glad
[1:32:21] nobody has fallen asleep but Luke
[1:32:30] chapter 8 I said right so if you've
[1:32:35] thought with me from verse 22 I'm going
[1:32:37] to be quick now he came to pass on a
[1:32:39] certain day that he went into a ship
[1:32:41] with his disciples and he said unto them
[1:32:44] let us go onto the other side of the
[1:32:46] lake and a lunch for but as I they said
[1:32:50] he fell asleep and there came down a
[1:32:52] storm of wind on the lake and they were
[1:32:55] filled with water and we're in jeopardy
[1:32:57] and they came to him and awoke him
[1:32:59] saying master master we perish then he
[1:33:01] arose and repeat the wind and the raging
[1:33:04] of the water and they ceased and it was
[1:33:06] calm last 25 and he said unto them where
[1:33:09] is your faith and they be being afraid
[1:33:12] one that saying one
[1:33:13] - another what manner of man is this for
[1:33:16] the command before for he commanded
[1:33:18] even the winds and the water to obey Him
[1:33:20] now best 26 and they arrived at the
[1:33:24] country of the gadarenes which is over
[1:33:26] against Galilee and when he went forward
[1:33:29] to the land there met him a man him out
[1:33:32] of the city a certain man which are
[1:33:34] devils long time and wine no clothes
[1:33:37] neither aboard in any house but in tombs
[1:33:40] and when he saw Jesus he cried out and
[1:33:43] fell down before him and with a loud
[1:33:45] voice said what have I to do with thee
[1:33:47] Jesus thou son of God Most High I
[1:33:50] beseech thee torment me not for he had
[1:33:51] commanded that unclean spirit to come
[1:33:53] out of the man for off times in our
[1:33:56] cotton and was kept bandwith changed and
[1:33:58] in Ferris and he break the bands and was
[1:34:00] driven of the devil into the wilderness
[1:34:02] so let's stop right there we saw how the
[1:34:05] devil keeps his prisoners when you know
[1:34:12] spiritually probably most people in this
[1:34:15] world today are worse than this man so
[1:34:20] they don't even know which sex they
[1:34:22] belong they are worse than this man this
[1:34:27] man didn't recognize his room anymore
[1:34:30] he lived in gravy ax and for me growing
[1:34:32] up anytime I see a graveyard spooky to
[1:34:36] me I'm just nervous that somebody's
[1:34:39] going to jump out it scare me but this
[1:34:43] man got to a point where the graveyard
[1:34:46] was his home but you wonder because now
[1:34:54] we want to trace this man who jumped to
[1:34:56] verse 30 so verse 29 38 sorry that I
[1:35:01] said now the man out of whom the Devils
[1:35:04] were a pilot besought him that he might
[1:35:06] be with him
[1:35:08] but since Jesus sent him away saying
[1:35:11] returned to their own house let's stop
[1:35:14] right there the man had a house he had a
[1:35:17] house before
[1:35:21] but a devil's took over completely till
[1:35:24] the gravy I was better he stopped paying
[1:35:27] his mortgage he stopped paying his rent
[1:35:29] he forgot completely then he has a nice
[1:35:33] bed so spiritually the world has gone to
[1:35:40] a point where we can't even think
[1:35:42] straight but if you see the story we're
[1:35:46] going to try to bring it to a close the
[1:35:49] man people saw him in his right mind and
[1:35:52] the Prophet said one day his wife and
[1:35:56] his kids has given up on him completely
[1:36:00] one day there was a knock on the door
[1:36:03] the man that was living in the graveyard
[1:36:06] nan was in his right mind telling his
[1:36:09] wife forgive me I am back a mind is
[1:36:13] better I have been restored but he
[1:36:18] missed his home while he was in the
[1:36:21] graveyard God wants you to be a prisoner
[1:36:29] if you don't want it these are the
[1:36:32] choices like Samson
[1:36:34] like this man it took Jesus to go to set
[1:36:37] him free but I wouldn't know the history
[1:36:40] of this man he took her prophet I want
[1:36:43] to get a chance you can read some of
[1:36:44] these messages I'm going to read from he
[1:36:47] said this man belonged to a holy ghost
[1:36:50] Church
[1:36:55] he didn't want to he didn't enjoy going
[1:36:58] to check so he started missing Church
[1:37:02] and I thought why is that and the
[1:37:07] Prophet said don't you remember that
[1:37:11] people in that city have been used to
[1:37:15] demonic possession till they are afraid
[1:37:19] of anyone that can cast out Devils I
[1:37:22] give you power to cast out Devils if
[1:37:26] somebody came in the church and cast out
[1:37:28] Devils it will be looking at him and so
[1:37:30] oh I don't want too much power in this
[1:37:35] church but that's the Holy Ghost Church
[1:37:38] and so after they seen that the man's
[1:37:41] evil spirit has been cast out because
[1:37:43] we've been given power to cast our evil
[1:37:45] spirit tonight if their evil spirits
[1:37:48] even by the preaching of the way they
[1:37:50] get cast out but we've gotten to a point
[1:37:54] where we've become so like much like a
[1:37:57] mock that would like to greet read a
[1:37:59] quote and go home so he said this man
[1:38:03] used to be in a Holy Ghost church where
[1:38:05] he seen the power of God so why he was
[1:38:08] in the graveyard he was always in his
[1:38:10] heart waiting for God to do something
[1:38:12] and here comes a man cast up those evil
[1:38:16] spirits now he's in his right mind he
[1:38:19] was afraid to go back because that
[1:38:21] church there women accepting the way we
[1:38:25] think he's been set free they would
[1:38:27] think is the same person so he wanted to
[1:38:30] go with Jesus Christ and Jesus said you
[1:38:32] go back to your house and your people
[1:38:35] and tell them what God has done for you
[1:38:38] that the Holy Ghost church is still here
[1:38:40] the RAM didn't take the Holy Ghost
[1:38:43] churches away the power of the Holy
[1:38:45] Ghost is still here tonight and this man
[1:38:49] looks at everybody in our village he was
[1:38:53] ready to battle for God because he's
[1:38:55] been delivered a greater power has come
[1:38:58] back in his right and they got rid of
[1:39:02] Jesus Christ we don't want you here
[1:39:04] because you because in all the demons
[1:39:07] away
[1:39:08] loosen housewives will be we want our
[1:39:11] our pigs because our pig meat when we
[1:39:14] roasted we enjoy it and you can't Davos
[1:39:16] spirits and cause so much havoc we don't
[1:39:19] want you don't you want the Holy Ghost
[1:39:22] church tonight the power of God is still
[1:39:25] here we must exercise it when you lose
[1:39:30] on a sit loose in heaven
[1:39:31] what you barn or Nance is bound in
[1:39:33] heaven God is not coming down to bound
[1:39:36] it you and I have to bound it you and I
[1:39:39] have to lose it we have to lose
[1:39:41] ourselves to worship God because we've
[1:39:46] been hungry we've been looking at the
[1:39:48] tapes and we know God is alive where is
[1:39:52] he in my church that's what we have to
[1:39:56] come to but it takes a change that is
[1:39:59] completely surrender to God it takes a
[1:40:01] change that is an expectation that God
[1:40:03] can be among us never than we have seen
[1:40:06] before so this man was sad when he had
[1:40:10] to let Jesus go but he had Christ's
[1:40:13] heart to remind him you have the power
[1:40:16] because I will be with you to the end of
[1:40:19] the world and if you read a story when
[1:40:24] he started his testimony everybody most
[1:40:27] of the people there they got converted
[1:40:29] so when we become completely prisoners
[1:40:32] of Christ the light shines in our
[1:40:34] community wherever we go people can see
[1:40:36] God you don't have to draw people in the
[1:40:39] church God will draw them now we've gone
[1:40:43] to a point where it is just a bunch of
[1:40:44] code that's all we do it's more than a
[1:40:47] quote it's meant to bring the power of
[1:40:51] God and make us conscious of it I don't
[1:40:58] know about you but I'm yearning for that
[1:41:00] day that people who say maybe Bob ROM is
[1:41:04] dead but I see the same power in the
[1:41:07] change
[1:41:07] I see the same pillar of fire in the
[1:41:09] church it's not you or me but is us
[1:41:14] deciding that God that's what we want
[1:41:16] Lord you are welcome it's not a song
[1:41:19] anymore but it's a life we want to live
[1:41:22] we don't want to get together unless you
[1:41:24] among us
[1:41:29] Paul has experienced that that's why I
[1:41:32] said Paul a prisoner and yes I read it
[1:41:35] for you God cannot use you until you
[1:41:38] become his total prisoner
[1:41:40] I want the Holy Ghost Church so much any
[1:41:46] times I'll go to a church I hear the
[1:41:48] sing and I see what is going on I said
[1:41:50] if somebody being prophesied people are
[1:41:52] going to look ha I thought the Prophet
[1:41:56] said you can prophesy you can stop it
[1:42:01] was spirit oh I don't believe it where
[1:42:04] is the quote that you can cut out it was
[1:42:05] where you lay hands on the sick oh my
[1:42:10] goodness that was meant for the Prophet
[1:42:14] don't you yearn for a holy ghost church
[1:42:23] so let's go leave it I'm bringing it to
[1:42:27] a close so this man was so possessed he
[1:42:31] was humble
[1:42:33] this man was a lovely brother I didn't
[1:42:36] even know he goes to church until I read
[1:42:38] his message he was elaborate brother he
[1:42:41] belonged to a Holy Ghost Church but
[1:42:44] slowly he didn't like he missed the
[1:42:47] church here and there miss the prayer
[1:42:49] meeting miss going home and finally the
[1:42:54] devil slowly led him into that like he
[1:42:56] did something through now his home was
[1:43:01] not good for him graveyard living among
[1:43:04] the tombs scaring people with some
[1:43:08] demonic strength I want to tell you
[1:43:12] tonight the power of God is here tonight
[1:43:14] to cast away every evil spirit
[1:43:18] that is giving you a headache that is
[1:43:21] troubling to you because it's the same
[1:43:23] power what you bound on that is bound in
[1:43:27] heaven God is not going to bind anything
[1:43:30] in heaven he's waiting for you and I to
[1:43:32] do it he's not going to lose anything on
[1:43:35] earth he's waiting for you and I to do
[1:43:37] it and we are sitting there looking for
[1:43:40] a court a court won't do it it's you
[1:43:45] that would do it is that God is looking
[1:43:48] for prisoners and man has to be a
[1:43:52] prisoner to Christ against anything
[1:43:56] connected with anything but Christ not
[1:43:59] even comma not connected with your
[1:44:01] father your mother your brother your
[1:44:02] sister husband wife pastor you are only
[1:44:05] connected with Christ then you can see
[1:44:09] God manifested I'm not sure tonight
[1:44:17] whether God met you expectation but I
[1:44:21] believe he wanted you to see here this I
[1:44:25] believe he wants you to hear this I'm
[1:44:33] reading from the message oneness he says
[1:44:37] I'm persuaded and many of us friends
[1:44:41] have received the Holy Ghost but we just
[1:44:44] received enough of the Holy Ghost enough
[1:44:46] in us to take us to a place where we
[1:44:50] don't want to lie we don't want to steal
[1:44:53] we don't want to do anything wrong but
[1:44:56] God wants to fill every fiber of his
[1:44:59] church amen he wants to fear your
[1:45:05] thinking he wants to fear your mind he
[1:45:10] wants to feel every bit of you so you
[1:45:13] can he can make you completely total
[1:45:15] dare to yourself or to your thinking
[1:45:17] just so surrounded in God till his word
[1:45:21] is just living right through you you
[1:45:24] don't know anything else by God's Word
[1:45:26] and you just want to stay right with
[1:45:29] this way it's a life
[1:45:31] my weights alive said Jesus Christ I
[1:45:36] like that it's not enough of the Holy
[1:45:41] Ghost to go to church everyday enough to
[1:45:44] read your Bible and I have to feel
[1:45:47] convicted when you tell a lie but you
[1:45:50] need every fiber every part of you
[1:45:54] filled with the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:45:57] God is trying to do to become for us to
[1:46:00] become prisoners it's not more
[1:46:02] Pentecostal time that I spoke in tongues
[1:46:04] I have the Holy Ghost so it's all
[1:46:06] finished you haven't even started yet
[1:46:09] I'm reading a message instead that does
[1:46:12] not what we caught we caught what will
[1:46:15] help us so we can do something that we
[1:46:18] want to do but I want to bring you to
[1:46:20] Christ tonight and before we leave
[1:46:23] there's a couple of decisions we got to
[1:46:25] make and after hearing something like
[1:46:28] that we just have to help god help you
