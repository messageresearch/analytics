[26:09] scriptures are I'm sure to us all if we
[26:12] go to Genesis 24 and we're gonna read
[26:14] verses 61 down to 64 and then we're
[26:18] going to turn to Ephesians chapter 2 so
[26:23] Genesis 24 and and verses 61 to 64 do
[26:26] you want to say Amen or wave your hand
[26:28] or I mean when you are when you are
[26:32] there amen
[26:33] since so let's forget the read here it
[26:36] says and Rebekah rose and her damsels
[26:39] and they rode upon the camels and
[26:41] followed the man and the servant took
[26:44] Rebekah and winters way and Isaac came
[26:46] from the way of the well llama Rory for
[26:50] he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac
[26:52] went out to meditate in the field at the
[26:54] Eventide and he lifted up his eyes and
[26:57] saw and behold the camels were coming
[27:00] and Rebekah lifted up her eyes and when
[27:03] she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel
[27:07] I mean let's just go to Ephesians
[27:10] chapter 2 we're gonna read from verse 1
[27:12] down to verse 6 I mean so Ephesians 2 in
[27:20] in in verse 1 I mean say mean or wave
[27:25] your hand with you there

[27:35] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[27:38] and sins weird in times past you walked
[27:41] according to the course of this world
[27:43] according to the Prince of the power of
[27:45] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[27:48] the children of disobedience among whom
[27:50] also we all had our conversation in
[27:54] times past in the lusts of our flesh
[27:55] fulfilling the desires of the mind and
[27:58] of the desires of the flesh of the mind
[28:01] and we're by nature the children of
[28:03] Wrath even as others but God who's
[28:05] Richard mercy for his great love
[28:07] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[28:09] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[28:12] with Christ by grace ye are saved and
[28:15] now now know
[28:17] where we have gone so we've gone from
[28:19] being under the spirit of this world but
[28:22] then we've been quickly made alive and
[28:24] we've been moved the Lord has moved us

[30:00] morning I mean it's good to see each and
[30:01] every one of you today I mean better but
[30:04] if I could if I could take a um if I
[30:07] could take a subject I would I want to
[30:10] speak about being closer to heaven than
[30:11] here this is my subject being being
[30:15] closer to heaven than here and you know
[30:17] we read in Genesis 24 that you know
[30:20] Rebecca made her journey to to marry
[30:22] Isaac and I just want to focus on the
[30:23] part you know because we know that the
[30:25] the wedding happens here the Union
[30:27] happens here you know we go here to the
[30:29] in supper you know you know you know by
[30:31] a rapture but you know there's also we
[30:33] are going on a journey from this world
[30:35] to the next world and so I want to take
[30:38] that part of Rebecca's journey where she
[30:39] left where she lived where she was born
[30:41] and then she was transported she was
[30:44] taken from from from there to her future
[30:47] home it's just like the same way we are
[30:48] being transported we're being taken I
[30:51] mean from this world to the next world
[30:53] so you know we are on our way from here
[30:55] to glory I mean whose good think it's I
[30:57] mean I'm I'm a pilgrim I'm traveling
[30:59] through this land hallelujah I mean so
[31:02] but I really pray that the Lord would
[31:03] make this real personal today you know I
[31:05] don't want this to be some abstract
[31:07] thing some kind of new thought of
[31:09] different angle but I want this to be a
[31:10] reality and I prayed it you know as this
[31:12] lockdown has been going on that the wood
[31:14] has become more personals become more
[31:16] real and it's all from theory to to to
[31:19] reality and there's God's from abstract
[31:22] to to material you know it's not a not
[31:24] as an idea you know we're not here you
[31:26] know we don't for this message like like
[31:29] we sit in some University Hall and he
[31:31] lecture after lecture
[31:32] believe me I've been there I can help be
[31:34] there listening to lecture out the
[31:36] lecture and you cram for an exam and
[31:38] then after the exam you forget most of
[31:40] what you've learned this is not how this
[31:41] works I mean we're walking with the
[31:43] Living God
[31:43] I mean he's molding and shaping us amen
[31:46] he's taking us from this world to the
[31:48] next world I mean but it's just like
[31:50] with you know Rebecca when she was born
[31:53] to wish she went to is quite a distance
[31:57] you know just just googling and
[31:59] searching you look on the map it's about
[32:01] 500 miles there's not just a day journey
[32:04] it's not just like I get my car and I
[32:06] could come see any of you you know 500
[32:08] miles by camels quite a long way Oh amen
[32:12] but but I want you to notice now that
[32:14] the same how she got there was not
[32:16] herself walking me right she didn't go
[32:19] on foot and walk those 500 miles you
[32:21] know because when we when we when we
[32:23] talk about we're you know we're walking
[32:25] with God as he not walking with God from
[32:27] this world to the next world
[32:29] you know the nipple like to try and
[32:30] twist it in our mind saying well now
[32:32] what do we have
[32:33] to get their tribe you following me I'm
[32:36] in but but I want you to notice that the
[32:37] sand camel she wanted by the well we're
[32:40] exactly the same camels that took her to
[32:42] her eyes that came in so wasn't her
[32:44] walking there but the same power the
[32:46] same camel she watered and it took her
[32:49] from from from where she was born to her
[32:51] future her hallelujah
[32:53] I mean so you know we wanna you know
[32:56] song I'm just gonna call it a follower
[32:58] you know this thing
[33:00] I mean sometimes believers can get in
[33:02] such a twist is just by comments
[33:04] sometimes believers can get in such a
[33:06] twist
[33:07] okay we're on a journey from this world
[33:09] and we're going to take a rapture to the
[33:10] next world but we you know we you know
[33:42] it won't be that anybody did all that
[33:45] for me in spite of me you lived amen so
[33:51] this may be very obvious and and and
[33:54] I've seen it before but this may be very
[33:55] obvious but those camels that pecked her
[33:57] there those camels picked her there they
[34:00] carried her she didn't walk herself they
[34:02] carried her amen and brother Brad was
[34:05] saying show us the father and we've seen
[34:07] the father in the cell hallelujah he
[34:09] says now the Lord Jesus bless you help
[34:11] you he says I love you and God loves you
[34:13] God wants you to get well God and His
[34:17] creation you believe it God in His Word
[34:19] you believe it God was in his son you
[34:21] believe it God indeed himself in Jesus
[34:23] Christ you believe it God emptied
[34:25] himself into the church is that right
[34:27] being God's and his word gods and his
[34:30] creation God's and his son and God as in
[34:33] his people do you believe it in Jesus
[34:35] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[34:37] forever is that right what he did then
[34:40] he can do now is that right we love him
[34:43] we believe him we've got we got
[34:47] soles magnetized with power tonight
[34:49] that'll take us in the rapture I mean
[34:52] the Holy Ghost I mean now soldiering
[34:54] mega times of the power then I'll take
[34:56] us in the rapture oh my I think of that
[34:58] beautiful Rebecca that afternoon
[34:59] watering the camels watering the very
[35:02] thing was going to take her I mean
[35:04] that's what it was watering the camels
[35:07] represents power and the Church of
[35:09] Living God today is rejoicing and
[35:11] watering the power of the Holy Ghost
[35:13] that'll pick up some day and take your
[35:15] yonder to meet the Isaac in the air for
[35:18] the winning stuff a hallelujah a means
[35:20] do you believe it
[35:21] I mean to the same cow I mean so just as
[35:24] that you said that camels represented
[35:25] the Holy Ghost she watered it with
[35:26] praise amen and giving it glory I mean
[35:29] that same power from that place where
[35:34] her bridegroom was and the holy guys
[35:36] that we have her seat we'll carry out
[35:38] orders from this world to the next world
[35:40] be gone forever hallelujah amen isn't
[35:45] that wonderful
[35:45] I mean whoa does that mean we sit back
[35:49] and I say well no if the Lord is in your
[35:51] heart you'll do like the Apostle Paul
[35:53] did what did the Apostle Paul do that's
[35:55] a good question and I'm glad I've got
[35:57] the answer for that question he's in
[35:59] Philippians 3 and 12 not as our ha I
[36:02] have already obtained neither were
[36:05] already perfect that we know that
[36:06] perfect is fully mature but I follow
[36:09] after if that I make every him
[36:12] that's which also I am every handed off
[36:14] Christ Jesus so Paul's gold he was
[36:17] gripped by something I mean he he was on
[36:20] the road to Damascus and he met the log
[36:22] and then and it gripped them I mean the
[36:24] Lord had prohibitive grab them seize
[36:26] them and then to his whole life's
[36:28] ambition now was every hint that which
[36:30] had apprehended her I mean this is the
[36:32] thing that he was wanting to do I mean
[36:34] that this this is what he wanted this
[36:36] was his hostas ire I mean that he would
[36:38] get ahold of God as God had got ahold of
[36:40] him
[36:41] amid so now this way isn't that why we
[36:44] read the world I mean isn't that why we
[36:46] listen to the
[36:47] we pray I mean that we would every and
[36:49] we'd get a hold of this goddess got a
[36:51] hold of us man it's not that you know
[36:54] Lord I want more of you I mean you've
[36:56] got a hold of me and now I want to get a
[36:59] hold of you that your mayor hostas I
[37:02] mean to the thing we wore I'm in this
[37:04] powered water without praise and our
[37:05] worship is the work you know you know as
[37:07] the wood comes up and what happens it
[37:09] just generates a praise out of our lives
[37:11] I mean I was thinking and maybe I'll
[37:13] come with the this is in the future
[37:15] sometime but I've been pondering them on
[37:17] John's response to the book coming open
[37:20] now to me it's you know you know it's
[37:24] not about the volume of a shot though he
[37:26] had a shout yeah but but it wasn't like
[37:30] he he took some notes and say that's a
[37:32] good thought but something came out of
[37:33] his life when he's little lamb' advice
[37:35] from glory and take the book and open
[37:37] the seals and it should be the same
[37:39] thing when the word comes out but that
[37:41] you generated praise they made she
[37:42] generated glory and you such a worship I
[37:45] mean it's not just a new idea or wasn't
[37:48] mad and I saying but it was sold that
[37:49] way before he began to praise God was
[37:54] becoming material what uncalibrated was
[37:59] now going to be fully complete amen in
[38:01] terms of he purchases bride now he's
[38:03] come to redeem his bride means letting
[38:07] you know the very power I mean this
[38:09] that's why I would give God glory
[38:10] hallelujah why because we're watering
[38:12] that power I mean we're wondering the
[38:14] camels they mean that same cow that the
[38:17] world is going to peck us into the next
[38:18] world
[38:20] I see it's not trying to use our own
[38:25] human effort to earn it earn something
[38:28] now this may sound a bit ridiculous but
[38:31] this just how I wrote it down and you
[38:33] know I don't mean to be joking but sadly
[38:36] many are trying to learn their way dress
[38:40] modestly enough their way listen their
[38:42] way into getting some favor with God
[38:45] that he will then move on their behalf
[38:48] you know it's kind of like people having
[38:50] a - kind of like a reward system you
[38:54] know it's like getting brownie points
[38:55] with God who's following made you
[38:56] understand what I mean it's like people
[38:58] evident they buy
[38:58] they do something thank God is all the
[39:01] guys to do something in return it's just
[39:04] kind of like her look system is how
[39:05] people are subconsciously you know so
[39:08] just let I earn five brownie points with
[39:09] God then they're entitled to a small
[39:11] healing God you on because I prayed this
[39:13] much I read this might try study this
[39:15] cut oh maybe you are didn't in brownie
[39:18] points with God then you get a big
[39:19] healing
[39:20] I prayed more and I I studied more I
[39:22] booked us again tomorrow
[39:24] I dress this way born what is it trying
[39:26] to add something right all 50 points is
[39:28] of deliverance because God you owed me
[39:30] now
[39:31] I made a thousand points in the one
[39:33] ticket safe but this sounds ridiculous
[39:36] but it said we have some people up they
[39:39] think I have done this fearful God you
[39:41] owe me goodness knows nothing amen and
[39:44] sadly they do not see by the revelation
[39:48] of the powers of the world God has done
[40:34] all we just need to walk in the victory
[40:36] hallelujah Amen see you know Rebecca
[40:40] just got on the camel she made a
[40:41] decision Oh God
[40:42] and she went Medici got to a place in
[40:47] her and her journey wish she was closer
[40:49] to her future Hartman to her previous
[40:51] home the Lea so so sadly maybe do not
[40:55] see that see see faith seat see faith is
[40:57] a revelation
[40:58] it's not something you study out now I
[41:01] just want to say I'm not against study
[41:02] I'm not against spending time looking at
[41:05] courts looking at scriptures i I'm all
[41:07] for that
[41:08] okay so I want you to understand I'm not
[41:10] against those things
[41:11] but if that's what we depend upon to
[41:13] take a rapture sadly we're going to be
[41:15] least behind amen it's not that's not
[41:18] how much we know I mean to me I mean
[41:20] that that will change our bodies Mitch
[41:23] we're we're face receives the word and
[41:25] the dynamics the Holy Ghost coming to a
[41:26] person and that will transform this
[41:29] mortal body I mean so so it's not about
[41:33] trying to get some kind of breath the
[41:35] weather stares rubbing my brownie points
[41:38] consciously think they have to do enough
[41:40] I'm just looking down as well look at
[41:42] the camera looking at you I mean you
[41:44] know you know weird understand it's not
[41:46] us trying to learn something with God I
[41:48] mean grace obtains the problems faith is
[41:53] a revelation sadly many people do that
[41:57] because they have not actually grossed
[41:58] the revelation of the power of the blood
[42:00] that is released upon the scene part
[42:03] right through the entire message a
[42:04] because the entire message takes us back
[42:07] to the scripture Texas back to the
[42:09] unadulterated Word of God remember
[42:11] basics did not come to replace this
[42:14] you're following me the message to talk
[42:17] to him to replace the Bible the message
[42:19] came to establish this is the Word of
[42:21] God
[42:22] this has a power I mean when this is
[42:25] received into a heart of faith I mean
[42:27] it'll move mountains I mean so sorry so
[42:31] the message reveals Christ in the
[42:33] scripture it's very important we need to
[42:36] see this message in the scripture I mean
[42:39] because the mises came to reveal Christ
[42:41] in the scripture but it doesn't replace
[42:42] the Bible I mean it just actually places
[42:45] the Bible in its correct place
[42:47] hallelujah amen amen say see when you
[42:51] see I mean so I mean I mean I was just
[42:53] in tears I was having such a good time
[42:55] to sing brothers when you see that it
[42:57] was all seen on that day on Calvary I
[42:59] mean that the blood of God was in
[43:01] the life of God that was that was in him
[43:03] now comes into the believer I mean by
[43:05] the shed blood and you begin to see
[43:08] I mean before the wood was just think on
[43:10] paper I mean before became real I mean
[43:14] always just quotes or just books or
[43:16] tapes or just
[44:31] [Music]
[44:37] such a fight and produces such a fight I
[44:41] mean when you see it smaller the story
[44:42] it's more than even a brother preaching
[44:44] better voice but the voice behind the
[44:46] voice begins to grip your soul I mean
[44:48] hallelujah oh my when he comes I mean
[44:52] personally to you and tell you child the
[44:54] books open prevail I've heard this young
[45:10] only so I just get excited hallelujah
[45:14] I'm in MCS jomkwan Manas division
[45:28] represents a whole body of people I mean
[45:30] this one says dog is the collective
[45:32] thing that the lamb takes the book and
[45:33] Joe's a seeing it all happen it's going
[45:35] to become a reality tear listener
[45:39] produces such a faith like I say even
[45:41] when you recognize it the black payroll
[45:43] that produces such a face in your life
[45:45] Holly I produced such a piece I made
[45:48] such a joy nothing held against me
[45:51] hallelujah amen
[45:54] and that face you begin to see working
[45:56] in your life what kind of faith is it
[46:00] isn't just human faith nas got this
[46:02] human face
[46:03] Paul Paul would write to the Galatians
[46:06] an end and he was speaking to a people
[46:08] that have been derailed by legalism
[46:10] he says I'm crucified with Christ
[46:12] nevertheless I live yet i but Christ
[46:15] liveth in me and the life which I now
[46:17] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[46:21] the Son of God
[46:24] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[47:26] we say what's happening you find
[47:29] yourself to be closer to there than here
[47:34] amen Hebrews 11 and I didn't steal this
[47:39] off sister Lundy's our Sunday schools
[47:41] already of my notes now faith is the
[47:43] substance of things hoped for the
[47:46] evidence of things not seen
[47:47] for by it the elders obtained a good
[47:50] report through faith we understand that
[47:52] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[47:54] God so that things which has seen are
[47:57] not made of things which to appear by
[48:01] faith aid offered so you know I just
[48:04] want to stop there I don't need a big
[48:06] documentary series to explain creation
[48:08] to me I don't need Sun look I work in
[48:13] the field of science so I can kind of
[48:14] say this
[48:15] I don't need science to prove me that
[48:17] God created the world's my faith I
[48:19] understand it right I received a
[48:22] revelation I understand he made the
[48:24] world world class work amen I find Abel
[48:29] offered unto God a more excellent
[48:30] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[48:33] witness that he was righteous God
[48:35] testifying of his gifts and putting out
[48:38] he being dead yet speaketh by faith
[48:41] Enoch was translated that he should not
[48:44] see death and was not found because God
[48:46] had translated him for before his
[48:49] translation he had this testimony that
[48:51] he pleased God
[48:52] so his faith I know I've seen this
[48:54] before but his faith took him in a
[48:56] rapture my faith Enoch was translated so
[48:59] saw his faith translated him right you
[49:03] follow me that's like a part we need to
[49:05] come visit you now by my car I came and
[49:07] visited you I was translated from my
[49:10] address to your address because my car
[49:12] took me there
[49:13] hallelujah so his faith took them from
[49:15] this world to the next world and the
[49:18] scripture tells us he walked with God
[49:20] and was not so he was just walking he
[49:25] entered into a relationship with God and
[49:27] he just began to walk with God but they
[49:30] came a day in his life where he realized
[49:32] that he was a shape change human shape
[49:46] from a mold until you look more heavily
[49:49] more like the earthly injecting us I
[49:55] need to look more like the world and
[50:00] even by the blood room creation so that
[50:02] we we not be in the Himalayan sea of the
[50:04] earthly though we may be still at least
[50:06] by sufficiently change but I betcha I
[50:09] mean our character because what happens
[50:13] we getting closer to heaven and to the
[50:17] earth hallelujah his faith translated
[50:25] him now and he had this testimony there
[50:29] before his translation he pleased God
[50:32] now we just read we just read in Hebrews
[50:38] I'm sorry I texted an extra for that
[50:41] faith but I'm going to come back to
[50:42] Enoch it's impossible to please him he
[50:45] that cometh to God must believe that he
[50:47] is and he that is a rewarder of them
[50:50] that diligently seek Him so Enoch space
[50:53] took him in a rapture but then Paul
[50:55] would begin to write without faith it's
[50:57] impossible to please him
[50:59] so in our ability we cannot please God
[51:01] it takes faith to please him right so
[51:04] without faith it's impossible to please
[51:06] him but I'll say with the faith of the
[51:09] Son of God and you it's impossible not
[51:11] to please go hey maybe he's going to
[51:15] take the vice versa right I mean we live
[51:17] by the faith of the Son of God the bride
[51:19] does
[51:19] Amen so now with faith it's impossible
[51:22] Lisa sure we have our ups and downs of
[51:25] disappointment whatever but it's all
[51:27] part of our journey yes and even I think
[51:30] it was brother I'm speechless hit it and
[51:32] just place me so well even many things
[51:35] that we bet that God delivers us from he
[51:38] allows us to remember those things and
[51:40] those things are still in our mind not
[51:43] to condemn us and keep us down but that
[51:45] we remain thankful that we were
[51:47] delivered from them louia so sure we
[51:51] have our ups and downs every but we're
[51:53] walking with God before his translation
[51:57] he had a testimony that he pleased God
[51:59] now automatically people were going to
[52:03] think now how can I have a taste for
[52:04] that pleases God because I'm going to
[52:06] get into condition then I'm rapture
[52:09] ready yeah
[52:10] the brides in rapture condition all
[52:13] right but it's not our own ability I
[52:14] just want to I just want to kick them I
[52:16] just want to kick what he calls supports
[52:19] out of human ability the way I've seen
[52:22] I've seen a perfect streets of perfect
[52:25] weakness he said one thing we must
[52:27] master is our own human ability but you
[52:31] can actually master than the fact it's
[52:33] not your human human ability that can
[52:35] actually produce the promises of God so
[52:39] I thought I just want to kick that thing
[52:41] down or maybe beat on it for a while yes
[52:43] I mean because we have to we have to
[52:46] understand it's not it's not us and our
[52:49] ability okay now okay so I better have a
[52:51] taste right it pleases God so I need to
[52:53] have a certain demeanor and I need to
[52:55] treat people a certain way and be happy
[52:58] with me and I've got a dream you know
[52:59] I'm all for holiness living I believe
[53:02] the Holy Ghost makes you live holy
[53:05] but people what they do is we're gonna
[53:07] kind now I need to have you know they
[53:09] try and maintain you everything in their
[53:11] own strength how's my prayer life doing
[53:13] it so long enough am I reading enough it
[53:15] might have my personal time I'm not
[53:17] against any of those things but but but
[53:19] they try and maintain this I've got to
[53:22] achieve the standard of Christian living
[53:24] you know he'll know my is my skirt to
[53:27] the floor now it's not it should be to
[53:29] the floor hold out now now I'm getting
[53:30] into condition because it becomes a
[53:32] legal thing right and and now I have the
[53:34] quotes for every question
[53:36] but everything hold together cross at
[53:38] the eyes and you know because he his
[53:59] life in the world I'm gonna be
[54:20] translated Jesus was asked the question
[54:52] what shall we do that we might work the
[54:56] works of God that's a good question
[54:58] because fielding well I'm gonna I'm
[54:59] going to get in this condition I'm going
[55:01] to have a teacher that I please God my
[55:03] behaviors going to be a certain way and
[55:04] I get upset at anything nothing bothers
[55:07] made I'm just in this crowd of serene
[55:09] kind of state and you know everything's
[55:11] fine and and I have no sickness I have
[55:14] no worry I have no stresses I'll say
[55:17] this sickness will be with us till the
[55:19] rapture why rain will be with us till
[55:22] the rapture birds will be with us till
[55:25] the rapture they will think I'm sorry
[55:28] they will be what but that doesn't mean
[55:31] just because you're burdened or you're
[55:33] sick or you worry about something that
[55:34] doesn't mean you're not going in a
[55:36] resurrection
[55:38] amen yeah so we just need to we just
[55:42] need to take all the you know take all
[55:45] those things put them to one side see
[55:47] because the devil puts it on us or
[55:49] you've got to worry you've got a burden
[55:52] maybe you're sick in your body you have
[55:54] this or you're not reps you're ready
[55:56] since when is it actually your those
[56:01] things will actually get your reps ready
[56:02] or not yeah I mean if it was then the
[56:06] problem would just preach human
[56:07] psychology
[56:08] he didn't preach human psychology and he
[56:10] preached rapturing faith in the world I
[56:13] mean sighs oh Jesus what shall we do
[56:16] that we might do the works of God and
[56:19] jesus answered and said unto them and is
[56:20] it well now now did he say you better be
[56:24] in every service I believe in that you
[56:26] better dress room obviously I believe
[56:28] you know we should your dress immodestly
[56:31] oh you better pray now every day read
[56:33] your Bible I mean you better listen to
[56:35] all the tapes you better have all the
[56:36] doctrine down packed no did anyone read
[56:40] that in the Bible
[56:42] let's have some people are on their mind
[56:44] right right he said this is the work of
[56:48] God he's gonna answer it they'ii believe
[56:51] on Him who he has seen
[56:52] I didn't believe this word bleep it this
[56:56] is how you do the work I mean this is
[56:58] how I believe in us and works it Bob he
[57:00] believes the word she believes the work
[57:02] and she believes that word and it
[57:04] changes
[57:08] I mean someone who sees they believe it
[57:11] in there's no change I don't know I kind
[57:13] of doubt the faith a men
[57:18] I thought you actually believed the word
[57:20] and they act upon the word they have
[57:21] World Bank hallelujah so we need to
[57:25] believe on Him whom he has see a men
[57:29] hallelujah no I'm just gonna jump back
[57:32] into Philippians how how Paul said I'm
[57:34] going after him that which has
[57:35] apprehended me and then the next thing
[57:38] he sees breather
[57:39] I count not myself to have apprehended
[57:42] so our pool was still trying to grab
[57:44] this one I believe their entire lives
[57:46] who wants more Jesus
[57:48] I meant I don't believe you'll be a time
[57:51] where we ever get satisfied when we
[57:53] think we have it all we just want more
[57:55] the more you have the more you want the
[57:58] more you have the more you walk and then
[58:01] the more you have them you know you just
[58:03] keep wanting more what's more tell us
[58:05] the reality of God merely wants a way to
[58:08] become flesh your name he wants all the
[58:09] promises of God and in workers the
[58:12] reason is because there's something that
[58:13] you were apprehended hallelujah but this
[58:18] was see see brethren I taught myself to
[58:21] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[58:23] now the Apostle Paul says this one thing
[58:26] I do I want to listen to what he does
[58:28] and I want to say I want to do what he
[58:30] did I mean forgetting those things which
[58:33] are behind so this is the one thing he
[58:36] does behind and reaching forth unto
[58:40] those things which are behind and
[59:25] reaching forth unto those things which
[59:28] are before I preached towards the mark
[59:31] of the full of prize of the high calling
[59:32] of God in Christ Jesus this was Paul's
[59:37] ambition
[59:38] this was her sure manifested and begin
[59:41] apostles a bigger profit messenger to
[59:43] the aged and all those things but but
[59:45] the same the same desire should be in
[59:47] every believer I mean that we forgive
[59:50] the things which in the past and we're
[59:51] pressing on let's keep pressing on
[59:54] church okay man let's not slip back and
[59:56] say well
[59:57] five years ago this place off hallelujah
[1:00:01] so they came at time and her journey
[1:00:05] wish you and I'm going to make to
[1:00:07] Rebecca now there was actually a time in
[1:00:09] her journey where she was actually
[1:00:10] closer to her future home then the home
[1:00:13] she was raised and now I just want to I
[1:00:15] don't I just have a couple of slides
[1:00:17] here I trustee everyone's following me
[1:00:19] and I trust there's something in you
[1:00:21] that says he's talking about me and you
[1:00:24] know the Lord is good I think we can
[1:00:27] rejoice now now who can see that this is
[1:00:29] the court now those equations answers
[1:00:32] number 3 1964 remember Isaac had lived
[1:00:35] the Tina was standing out in the field
[1:00:37] meditating in the late afternoon amen
[1:00:39] when he saw a bigot coming and she had
[1:00:42] never seen him he'd never seen her but
[1:00:44] it was love at first sight
[1:00:45] she fell in love with him and he was
[1:00:48] happy and she was even Val they made oh
[1:00:51] my and look when she seen him her heart
[1:00:55] was so full of joy she didn't know who
[1:00:58] she was going to marry but by faith amen
[1:01:00] and remember Jesus will leave the
[1:01:02] kingdom and will not meet him in glory
[1:01:05] will where to meet him in the air
[1:01:07] between heavens and earth where it's
[1:01:09] expanded to redeem us and he met Rebecca
[1:01:13] in the middle between her home and his
[1:01:15] high-minded took her into his home and
[1:01:17] married her and tell it everything has
[1:01:19] father had a mean are perfect just
[1:01:21] perfect alright so he sees that we're
[1:01:24] gonna meet the Lord halfway between here
[1:01:26] and there
[1:01:27] right where heaven has come and expanded
[1:01:31] down to redeem us now we know redemption
[1:01:33] is where God purchases our salvation any
[1:01:36] times to claim us again to get a hold of
[1:01:38] us so heaven is expanded and and I just
[1:01:41] want to meditate on the stolen but
[1:01:44] heaven has expanded to redeem us
[1:01:46] probably so hippin is actually extended
[1:01:49] itself out I need to get a hold of us
[1:01:51] now we not think of heaven expanding to
[1:01:54] redeem us
[1:01:55] I think of lucky nations at war now this
[1:01:58] picture here is a as I am it's from
[1:02:01] world war two and it's a prisoner of war
[1:02:03] camp which i think has just been
[1:02:05] liberated I mean but but we know think
[1:02:07] of heaven expanding to redeem us I think
[1:02:10] it's like
[1:02:10] nation is at war and and and that nation
[1:02:13] is beginning to expand its territory
[1:02:16] taking enemy land and as it's doing that
[1:02:19] it's looking to do two things number one
[1:02:22] is looking to engage the enemy and
[1:02:25] destroy it but also looking for its own
[1:02:28] forces that have been previously taken
[1:02:30] captive and present
[1:03:01] I mean of the devil but then God you see
[1:03:07] the you know you know you see the faces
[1:03:09] of these men here but they're happy why
[1:03:12] because I see deliverance is coming very
[1:03:18] much they look like this without mice
[1:03:20] into that prison camp in the beginning
[1:03:22] they would be down and serious and fear
[1:03:24] defeated in there and the shoulders
[1:03:26] hanging down and said I always stuck
[1:03:28] Carol you know why can't we be free and
[1:03:30] we want to fight the war whatever war
[1:03:32] but you know when when they're our side
[1:03:35] time to get them halia and turned their
[1:03:38] faces from Doncaster rejoicing why cuz
[1:03:41] here was their liberation our I mean why
[1:03:44] because you could say that I mean
[1:03:45] expanded it their territory and they
[1:03:49] were driving their enemies out but also
[1:03:51] driving the enemy up but also rescuing
[1:03:55] redeeming those hadn't ordered
[1:03:56] previously taken captive by the enemy
[1:04:00] hallelujah glory to God sorry so this is
[1:04:04] what has happened to his friends
[1:04:06] we have been liberated and also that
[1:04:10] liberation now what happens is those
[1:04:12] prisoners of war
[1:04:13] what would either happiness is that
[1:04:16] would be either rehabilitated and put
[1:04:18] back into the fighting forces or they
[1:04:21] would be set free to be
[1:04:24] well what's happened you know and then
[1:04:26] and then I you know I want to point this
[1:04:28] out to if you aren't going just say you
[1:04:32] know you know you are taking to me
[1:04:33] territory and you see a prison camp
[1:04:36] there and you are armed forces of there
[1:04:38] you don't leave that prison camp hold it
[1:04:40] up you go liberate the thing I mean but
[1:04:44] you're looking for your on side right
[1:04:46] you're looking for your arm on comrades
[1:04:48] you're looking for the same rods with
[1:04:50] the same kind of uniform as your
[1:04:51] hallelujah as the same thing heaven
[1:04:54] expanded because God is looking for his
[1:04:56] attributes
[1:04:56] I mean God is upon the earth and in
[1:04:59] liberating his attributes now we are the
[1:05:01] attributes of God in flesh amen I mean
[1:05:04] and we didn't become that father give
[1:05:06] birth we already were us I meant we
[1:05:08] already were as attributes I mean but
[1:05:10] the Holy Ghost indeed breath I mean just
[1:05:12] polkas attributes alive right so here
[1:05:15] they are I mean and and they're here I
[1:05:18] need to liberate all of their own forces
[1:05:21] and they not gonna lead one who's behind
[1:05:24] it's exactly the same with God human has
[1:05:27] expanded that upon the earth to meet us
[1:05:29] and Inter Dimas and he has done the same
[1:05:32] in that he's not really one who's behind
[1:05:34] he's not gonna leave a single attribute
[1:05:36] upon the earth he's gonna find every
[1:05:39] member of the bride hallelujah yes they
[1:05:42] were all in a prison of sadness or
[1:05:44] loneliness of torment of sickness ah
[1:05:46] celebration is here now I wanna I just
[1:05:57] wanna I'm just gonna leave that picture
[1:05:59] up a bed sore eyes
[1:06:00] now amen that's exactly the same in this
[1:06:04] battle it's a contest between God and
[1:06:06] Satan going on who does is it caught
[1:06:08] this guy everyone has expanded to redeem
[1:06:11] II every attribute of God upon the earth
[1:06:13] that's why this message is gone round
[1:06:15] the world hallelujah that's exactly
[1:06:18] that's exactly mother man has a story of
[1:06:20] mama eagle she knew she knew she had two
[1:06:23] eggs but but but one time when she was
[1:06:25] off hunting a farm you know the store a
[1:06:28] well book but let's just go they because
[1:06:29] it makes me happy
[1:06:30] I mean so you know you know farmer goes
[1:06:32] gets one of the eggs takes it puts it
[1:06:34] down to the chicken cook and then and
[1:06:37] then finally eat that yo you know that
[1:06:39] that baby eagle hatches and he opens his
[1:06:42] eyes he has no idea what he is they give
[1:06:44] us a look around me Caesar he sees his
[1:06:46] mama
[1:06:46] well thinks it's his mother as a hidden
[1:06:48] you know you know his brothers and
[1:06:50] sisters old little chickens and he and
[1:06:51] he follows him tries to mimic armor and
[1:06:54] eat worms and eat corn
[1:06:55] but doesn't says fires you know he just
[1:06:58] feels he doesn't fit it because no
[1:06:59] reflection but in all this time when
[1:07:02] he's in that prisoner of war camp and
[1:07:05] that time when he's born into that
[1:07:07] slavery trying to be like a chicken mama
[1:07:09] knew that she had another attribute Amy
[1:07:12] because she because she had two internet
[1:07:14] repeats and what was hence one was
[1:07:16] flying one was fledgling but she wasn't
[1:07:19] satisfied just with one coming to birth
[1:07:21] coming to its position I mean she had a
[1:07:23] burden I had another eight subway and
[1:07:26] she because o open a big great big wings
[1:07:29] fly into the hip atleast and then she's
[1:07:31] looking and she's flying she's looking
[1:07:33] there's a bird another hot seat she's a
[1:07:36] mama bird on her hop we said other ink
[1:07:39] whiz another attribute and she saw a
[1:07:42] slapping to the flap into the sky
[1:07:45] and then her eyes looked down at a place
[1:07:47] and she sees a chicken yeah but one of
[1:07:51] those chickens does not look like a
[1:07:53] chicken because now she's thinking is
[1:07:58] this black chick what's happening
[1:08:00] outside I mean heaven expanded I made
[1:08:03] that Eagle you could say its character I
[1:08:05] expanded over that chicken cook was that
[1:08:07] one thing in mind I want my places we
[1:08:19] gonna fly the chicken yeah to be good to
[1:08:21] scream with that Eagle spring I mean
[1:08:26] because they in regard to claim an edge
[1:09:21] should be just like that mother Eagle I
[1:09:23] mean her territory expanded until she
[1:09:25] found that one and then they went up in
[1:09:27] DeHaven Lee places I just want to point
[1:09:33] out something as I said that there's a
[1:09:35] call this between God and Satan this is
[1:09:39] God's battle this is God's battle I mean
[1:09:42] face phase following this is God's
[1:09:45] battle he's in Sound City for medal
[1:09:47] singing at the inter-service I don't
[1:09:49] know but this is this poor man cried Sam
[1:09:51] City for verse 6 and the Lord heard him
[1:09:53] and saved him out of all his troubles
[1:09:56] I mean how God is a God of deliverance I
[1:09:59] mean our God is a God of Liberty
[1:10:01] Sam City 4 verse offside as verse 6 now
[1:10:04] now verse 7 I think the angel of the
[1:10:06] lord encamps around them that fear him
[1:10:08] and lower thing losing kent by the angel
[1:10:12] of god and then he delivers us from all
[1:10:14] our fears I mean sounds 34:19 many are
[1:10:18] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:10:20] Lord delivers them out of being all they
[1:10:24] say that o Lord you have got me out of
[1:10:26] my all my afflictions I mean any may be
[1:10:28] my affliction
[1:10:29] - love me out of them all hallelujah
[1:10:33] I mean I love the story of this in
[1:10:36] second chronicles and chapter 20 and and
[1:10:40] it's going to be a battle between King
[1:10:42] Jehoshaphat and and Israel and his
[1:10:45] enemies and and and they begin together
[1:10:49] they don't know how they're gonna fight
[1:10:50] this battle within a season in verse 14
[1:10:54] and the Spirit of the Lord is in the
[1:10:56] midst of the congregation so God's going
[1:10:58] to give it us that's why it's all water
[1:11:00] death right atmosphere and how harmless
[1:11:02] unplugged at the right atmosphere in
[1:11:04] church I've been to spirit alone with
[1:11:06] common come among the congregation
[1:11:07] because God's going to give us battle
[1:11:09] orders he's gonna show us how we're
[1:11:11] gonna win the spell hallelujah and he
[1:11:14] said verse 15 I can heal all Judah this
[1:11:17] is God speaking and II inhabitants of
[1:11:19] Jerusalem and now King Jehoshaphat
[1:11:20] listen to me that side the Lord unto you
[1:11:23] be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of
[1:11:25] the scrap multitude for the battle is
[1:11:28] not yours but gods and because I don't
[1:11:30] be dismayed sure hell is literally
[1:11:33] indeed itself upon the earth
[1:11:34] I mean yeah it is way more demonic power
[1:11:37] and besides if it has been in any aids
[1:11:39] but don't be dismayed by their great
[1:11:41] multitude I mean because the battle is
[1:11:43] not yours I mean you're not in this walk
[1:11:45] I mean try to work later and your eyes
[1:11:47] straight your there's any demon power by
[1:11:49] your own ability I mean you know either
[1:11:51] coming by your own shake not the battles
[1:11:53] like Moses gods battle I mean when
[1:11:55] they're recognized and he's in charge of
[1:11:57] this battle holy we can try and take it
[1:11:59] our hearts tricks I mean you know but
[1:12:01] say god this is your battle hallelujah
[1:12:06] Amen he say well I'm in a great battle
[1:12:10] also humans here to fight fear I mean
[1:12:13] humans expanded to her demons our reason
[1:12:19] I can say this is because yo say it's
[1:12:21] God's battle because now here's a
[1:12:23] diagram of the spectrum of the spectrum
[1:12:27] of light now this world that we live in
[1:12:30] we only see a very small portion of this
[1:12:32] you can see there that you know cosmic
[1:12:37] rays are very small broadcast bands are
[1:12:40] cooler
[1:12:41] kilometers and hike but the visual
[1:12:44] spectrum of the light is a very small
[1:12:46] band in the middle that's in expanded in
[1:12:49] that other beauty on the bottom so we
[1:12:51] can only see a small portion of light
[1:12:53] and that shows us actually that that
[1:12:55] most of the world that we live in is
[1:12:57] actually unseen right there's actually a
[1:13:00] very small person posture of the
[1:13:02] squirrel directly in contact with that
[1:13:03] doesn't mean it's not there right
[1:13:06] radio waves are here I can't see them I
[1:13:09] mean you know gamma rays x-rays
[1:13:11] ultraviolet and for red broadcast fans
[1:13:14] radio microwaves all those things are
[1:13:17] here I can't see them it doesn't mean
[1:13:19] they're not here right I mean and it's
[1:13:22] the same thing with us now we have to
[1:13:25] recognize Amen angels are here my
[1:13:28] father's here the captain of the hosts
[1:13:31] the Lord which is the Lord Himself is
[1:13:32] prese hey man this I'm saying we're not
[1:13:35] in this bad Lord but God is with us in
[1:13:38] this battle oh I just want us to quit
[1:13:44] now is a reason why Rebecca got on that
[1:13:46] Camel there's a reason why human has
[1:13:49] expanded amen - to redeem us in the
[1:13:52] south there's a reason that that Enoch
[1:13:55] walked with God and was not because God
[1:13:56] took them there's a reason and and the
[1:13:59] reason is because they had a man a
[1:14:02] theophany body an eternal body already
[1:14:04] in the heavens for them I mean if we are
[1:14:07] part of the word we already have an
[1:14:09] eternal home waiting for us I mean Paul
[1:14:12] would say though this earthly tabernacle
[1:14:14] of this house Peter's old I have one
[1:14:16] eternal in the heavens waiting for me
[1:14:18] already right so there was actually a
[1:14:20] call there was a call from an unseen
[1:14:22] world upon their lives and I was
[1:14:25] actually drawing them amen - to their
[1:14:28] future home now brother Graham would say
[1:14:31] this this entosis mark is like he says
[1:14:34] that's the alternate is something you
[1:14:35] could not see it could be right here now
[1:14:39] you could not see it should be right
[1:14:41] here
[1:14:41] that's just like well my television
[1:14:44] that's in another dimension television
[1:14:47] people are moving right through this
[1:14:48] room now singing there is cows also but
[1:14:51] the eye is only subject
[1:14:52] to the five senses I mean you're hoping
[1:14:54] is only subject to the five senses
[1:14:56] rather and you and you are only subject
[1:14:59] to what the site has been limited to see
[1:15:01] that's why I showed you the spectrum of
[1:15:03] life you're only limited to that little
[1:15:04] band but there is another dimension that
[1:15:07] can be seen by transpire transformation
[1:15:09] by television that television does not
[1:15:12] manufacture a picture a television only
[1:15:15] channels it into a circuit and in the
[1:15:18] television screen picks it up but the
[1:15:19] picture is there too to begin with
[1:15:22] television was here when Adam was here
[1:15:24] television was here when Elijah MC
[1:15:26] remarkable television was here when gzip
[1:15:29] nez earth walk the shores of Galilee but
[1:15:31] we just now discovering it they wouldn't
[1:15:34] have believed it back there you would
[1:15:36] have been crazy to have said something
[1:15:38] like that but now it become a reality
[1:15:43] so does crisis here the angels of God
[1:15:46] are here and some day and the greatly
[1:15:48] needed to come it will be just more real
[1:15:50] than television or anything else because
[1:15:52] they aren't here he reveals himself in
[1:15:55] his great form of what he claimed as
[1:15:58] here more face himself into his servants
[1:16:01] to prove himself anybody sees that all
[1:16:04] these so those things are all here
[1:16:08] televisions here even now I mean as I'm
[1:16:11] standing in my lounge speaking to you I
[1:16:13] mean you know I could be we can be
[1:16:15] having the service just just me and my
[1:16:18] family here I could be doing exactly the
[1:16:19] same thing saying exact you're saying
[1:16:21] the same things I mean and you'd never
[1:16:23] see it but because of this technology we
[1:16:26] have I mean my image in my voice is
[1:16:29] transported from my my lounge into your
[1:16:32] heart amen that's the same thing now I
[1:16:36] mean the angels of God I hear the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost is here I mean what God gives us
[1:16:42] faith in contact at odds in world
[1:16:46] hallelujah but it's more real as as
[1:16:49] brother Baron would send either they
[1:16:51] quote I mean it's just more real than
[1:16:55] television or anything else because they
[1:16:57] are here so now we're living in this
[1:17:00] world where most of this world is
[1:17:02] actually unseen and these five senses do
[1:17:05] know
[1:17:05] declared and these five senses would all
[1:17:07] make - contacted I remember faith that
[1:17:10] sixth sense that we have has made to
[1:17:12] contact an unseen world and the reason
[1:17:15] that that we do recommend field you know
[1:17:18] the reason that that we do contact an
[1:17:21] unseen world or their unseen world
[1:17:23] contacted us is because we have a body
[1:17:26] that we're going to step into as I say
[1:17:30] now we're closer to there than here
[1:17:33] amen I mean the bride the bride has been
[1:17:36] walking right the bride has been
[1:17:39] ascending alia not just a nice idea but
[1:17:43] we're XE let me be descending I mean
[1:17:46] climbing higher each day hallelujah
[1:17:48] where where once where we started the
[1:17:50] journey maybe something would fathers
[1:17:52] and toss us around but then we overcame
[1:17:54] it but haven't we climbs a little higher
[1:17:55] I mean and then there's nothing no I
[1:17:58] climb a little higher and there is
[1:18:00] nothing we conquered a little conquer
[1:18:02] throws every climbed a little higher
[1:18:03] I mean and when we started our journey I
[1:18:06] mean you know it's just like a natural
[1:18:08] child when they born you know sometimes
[1:18:11] it's hard to say you know you heard
[1:18:14] that's all she just looks like you or he
[1:18:16] just looks like you your mom or dad and
[1:18:18] sometimes you look at the baby and you
[1:18:19] look at the fair I don't know how this
[1:18:21] is working you know you know to me but
[1:18:25] then eventually as they grow and then
[1:18:27] they begin to walk and they begin to
[1:18:29] speak Indonesian personality come out
[1:18:31] you begin to see actually there are a
[1:18:33] lot like I'm and day I met and even when
[1:18:37] they're well off in years any of the
[1:18:39] things that parents that I mean they
[1:18:41] they said character a night did you see
[1:18:43] it living in their lives because as
[1:18:46] they're walking as they were walking
[1:18:47] along last journey they become more like
[1:18:50] the seed of the gene that was in them
[1:18:52] but that life that natural efforts and
[1:18:55] then becomes manifested greater and
[1:18:57] greater way and it's the same thing with
[1:18:59] you and I mean as the wolf of God maybe
[1:19:01] when we first start a little crawling
[1:19:04] along in your yard you know whole thing
[1:19:06] along and picking up and falling down
[1:19:08] juanzi so to speak trying to get a long
[1:19:10] walk with God I mean we didn't look the
[1:19:13] whole bunch like the word right now
[1:19:15] we're not saying about looking like the
[1:19:17] word I'm not just talk about being
[1:19:19] modestly dressed right I'm doing better
[1:19:21] nature and a character that's what I'm
[1:19:24] talking about because remember this is
[1:19:26] the character of God revealed in here
[1:19:28] and this is a love leader this is the
[1:19:31] heart of God I mean reveal to you in a
[1:19:33] lovely - right and the more you read
[1:19:36] this the more you become like your lover
[1:19:39] amen right so as you walk with God I
[1:19:43] mean we've become looking more like him
[1:19:46] and what we are actually doing this
[1:19:48] because mimic God has an image of us God
[1:19:50] has an eternal body and the heavens I
[1:19:53] mean already waiting for us and he knows
[1:19:57] what it looks like now know what I'm
[1:19:58] saying well it looks like it's more than
[1:20:00] just all we look can look like we're 19
[1:20:02] 18 or 18 or whatever age it's more than
[1:20:04] just a physical look that's the
[1:20:05] character of nature he knows that he
[1:20:07] knows what nature in character we have
[1:20:09] we will have after the rapture but he
[1:20:13] knows he knows what that is so he has an
[1:20:15] image of us and the heavens and then now
[1:20:18] as we're walking with God right we
[1:20:21] become more and more like that image
[1:20:24] following more and more right so I just
[1:20:27] say you know we start walking with God
[1:20:29] at first we look like this but I'm it
[1:20:31] looks like this but as we're walking
[1:20:33] with God and God gives us one of a kind
[1:20:36] power more of his nature we surrender
[1:20:37] Marty you know fills with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:39] changes matures us stabiliser
[1:20:42] I'm stabilized I'll walk that of each
[1:20:44] lead we go from looking like this which
[1:20:46] doesn't look like an open hand there is
[1:20:47] to walk with them we become more and
[1:20:49] more and more like him I know it's a
[1:20:53] very crude illustration but but but but
[1:20:55] I'm sure you get what I mean
[1:20:56] but we just got to walk with them and
[1:20:58] love them what but the reason now the
[1:21:03] reason now we are walking with us
[1:21:05] because we have representation and hip
[1:21:06] and already now our brother man would
[1:21:09] say this is an expectation in 1954 he
[1:21:13] says he says now I mean well I'll just
[1:21:18] say this first seat we may not see we
[1:21:21] may not see the unseen
[1:21:22] but we feel it's a fix amen
[1:21:26] he says now on expectation I pray before
[1:21:29] now I'm Pentecostal or fog or Full
[1:21:31] Gospel people around the world
[1:21:33] I find them with a great faith and the
[1:21:35] reason they have faith is because they
[1:21:37] just skipped up a bit Father they have
[1:21:41] been born of the Spirit of God which is
[1:21:43] the supernatural and many people tell me
[1:21:44] brother Branham as you get older you
[1:21:47] look like you're dead
[1:21:48] well he's my dad that's the reason I
[1:21:50] look like him well now the same thing
[1:21:52] many things that we have that that we
[1:21:55] favor by a family strain like that
[1:21:58] through each other ending in the family
[1:22:00] strain of God if we become born of the
[1:22:02] Spirit ago we take on the nature God
[1:22:04] then we are his son we are the sons of
[1:22:07] God and this is where I find that the
[1:22:10] Full Gospel people has become sons and
[1:22:11] daughters of God they believe the
[1:22:13] supernatural now the other has never
[1:22:15] stepped up be performed why because
[1:22:17] they've climbed a little higher right
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:19] so they can't believe the supernatural
[1:22:21] there's nothing to believe would see so
[1:22:24] he's saying the people who believe you
[1:22:25] just believe the supernatural The Full
[1:22:27] Gospel Church they've come a little
[1:22:28] higher then then then the others right
[1:22:32] why because they've been walking with
[1:22:33] God and so it's the same thing with us
[1:22:35] friends we've been we've been walking
[1:22:37] with him and we'll be kind of looking
[1:22:40] for life from all the time amen
[1:22:43] now have you ever um you know I'm sure
[1:22:47] during this lockdown maybe maybe you
[1:22:50] yeah you know as I say this like a we
[1:22:53] may feel the effects of the unseen realm
[1:22:55] just like brother Graham said and who's
[1:22:58] the smoke is the public was when you
[1:22:59] realize that this this message is eagle
[1:23:02] food you heard from your theophany yeah
[1:23:04] right I think I think brother Nene you
[1:23:06] said on we're on but you know you know
[1:23:09] but you heard from your theophany so you
[1:23:11] actually have this eternal body wedding
[1:23:13] in the heavens and when you recognize
[1:23:14] that this message is the word of God
[1:23:16] this eagle food then he says you've
[1:23:18] heard from that eternal home but the
[1:23:21] thing is now the thing is is but they
[1:23:23] still a dimension between us and here
[1:23:25] right we can't see our theophanies we
[1:23:29] can't see that realm as you know like
[1:23:31] brother Brad is caught up in the
[1:23:33] anointing as a
[1:23:34] and he could see from eternity to
[1:23:37] eternity all right but we're not all
[1:23:40] built that way I thought that that realm
[1:23:43] are still live Amy that realm is still
[1:23:46] there and it's still affecting this
[1:23:47] realm and to me it's kind of like you
[1:23:49] know maybe maybe you know during this
[1:23:51] lockdown you may have bumped into
[1:23:53] another believers when you've gone to
[1:23:56] the supermarket or gone somewhere but
[1:23:58] there's like so so so before when you're
[1:24:01] just going about your business
[1:24:02] amen you don't realize they're there but
[1:24:05] suddenly they appear and you and you
[1:24:09] begin to actually feel their influence
[1:24:11] in the place right because you sees that
[1:24:13] their presence is there and you know
[1:24:15] their presence there is because you can
[1:24:17] see them right now we can't see the
[1:24:20] angels we can't see God but we feel as
[1:24:22] presence come down and so we know he's
[1:24:24] here with us
[1:24:25] right so then you begin to see another
[1:24:27] believer I mean but because of the
[1:24:29] social distancing which I'm sure we've
[1:24:31] all get to know and we should you know
[1:24:34] there's still a gulf between you and
[1:24:37] them right but but they can talk to you
[1:24:40] and you can talk back to them I mean but
[1:24:42] it's kind of like now and in this world
[1:24:46] right now because of the star meets you
[1:24:48] know get amen
[1:24:49] well theophanies come close and and they
[1:24:53] begin to affect us I mean the angels of
[1:24:55] God come down God Himself comes down and
[1:24:58] we'll feel that presence I mean we we
[1:25:00] feel their effect we feel their
[1:25:02] influence hallelujah but we've got to
[1:25:05] understand it's not going to stay that
[1:25:06] way brother Branham would would would
[1:25:11] say and go awake Jesus in 1963 now I'm
[1:25:15] asking the quit no I'm answering the
[1:25:17] question maybe better nasca but you know
[1:25:19] why did why is he even expanded or how
[1:25:22] do we know heavens expanded I mean
[1:25:24] because I mean we feel the effect of
[1:25:26] that unseen world because we've got a
[1:25:28] new body to see right he says could you
[1:25:31] imagine a person that's never had the
[1:25:33] sense of sight and evidence see and you
[1:25:35] would bump against objects and you would
[1:25:38] have to derive your food from energy or
[1:25:41] some other resource but you would bump
[1:25:44] into something you have a sense of
[1:25:45] feeling but not
[1:25:47] and then all of once somebody opened
[1:25:49] their eyes up and seen a complete
[1:25:50] different world they'd never seen they
[1:25:53] had never seen anything and if then you
[1:25:55] could say well well now what should feel
[1:25:59] real woman you it's the Sun and the
[1:26:02] blood business is well what is the Sun
[1:26:03] it's a life that's a what's a life he'd
[1:26:05] never seen he'd even lived in that sense
[1:26:08] he doesn't know what it is that you bump
[1:26:10] against it's a certain thing well what's
[1:26:12] it see he never lived in that dimension
[1:26:14] at all it would be very strange to him
[1:26:17] to know it well know if God leads us
[1:26:19] look we are broadly here in five senses
[1:26:22] but there is another sense and then when
[1:26:24] we wake up into that sense and that is
[1:26:26] the sense of vision and we see that
[1:26:29] thing and what it is makes us feel these
[1:26:31] things that we do and try to tell
[1:26:34] someone about it that's like trying to
[1:26:35] tell man that never did see in his life
[1:26:38] that he wouldn't understand because he's
[1:26:40] not acquainted with that sense and that
[1:26:42] is that and that's the way it is in the
[1:26:45] gospel they don't understand it it's
[1:26:47] hard for them to see it because they
[1:26:50] never lived in there they know nothing
[1:26:52] about it they feel it and they can have
[1:26:55] a reaction to it but to actually know
[1:26:57] what it is we don't so when we can see
[1:27:00] beyond that curtain where it comes from
[1:27:02] and then try to come back and tell the
[1:27:04] people that's on the Felda with the
[1:27:05] seeds of feeling well never being able
[1:27:07] to see it aside to tell a man but you
[1:27:10] just have to do the best you can until
[1:27:11] we all see face to face I mean is
[1:27:14] like the throat towards a whole other
[1:27:16] world that's there but you've got to
[1:27:18] have a siege to contact that world now
[1:27:20] we have bits of faith now brother man
[1:27:23] would speak about and in quite a few
[1:27:26] places I mean we're we're eternity he
[1:27:30] says you don't understand and now
[1:27:33] because you're just bumping into us so
[1:27:35] basically we're just walking along this
[1:27:37] life we notice that heaven to God do we
[1:27:39] know there's a rapture to take I mean we
[1:27:41] know there's a God whose name is the
[1:27:43] Lord Jesus Christ we know he's redeemed
[1:27:45] us I mean but that eternal realm is
[1:27:47] influencing us constantly but it's like
[1:27:50] we can't see you just kind of bump into
[1:27:52] it amen and it bumps into you and it
[1:27:55] influences you and he and he says that
[1:27:58] quite a few times about you know
[1:28:00] that thing that you're bumping into it
[1:28:01] ought to say that condemns you when
[1:28:03] you're wrong you know he says it's
[1:28:05] actually it's actually eternity bumping
[1:28:08] into you or rather you were bumping into
[1:28:10] it you know these cannot come a time and
[1:28:13] and maybe I'll just close with this
[1:28:15] thought
[1:28:15] I remember to Rebekah we don't know
[1:28:17] journey and she got to a place that she
[1:28:20] was closer to there than here and heaven
[1:28:24] expanded Justine's brother Browns woods
[1:28:27] heaven expanded or he even has expanded
[1:28:30] to redeem us right so at first I mean
[1:28:34] when when Rebecca first got on the camel
[1:28:36] maybe the draw wasn't so strong what but
[1:28:40] as she journeyed as the camels carried
[1:28:42] her just like the Holy Ghost is carrying
[1:28:45] us from this world to the next world
[1:28:47] maybe maybe the influence got stronger
[1:28:49] you know maybe she began as she was
[1:28:51] listening to early days and isn't what's
[1:28:52] what's Isaac like what's he really like
[1:28:55] and she no doubt would have would have
[1:28:57] put him under that great you know what a
[1:28:58] porter of a question after question and
[1:29:01] Eliezer would have been telling her this
[1:29:02] is what he's like a missus character
[1:29:05] this is what he looks like this is what
[1:29:06] he likes and doesn't like if this is us
[1:29:08] hot and all these things you know s and
[1:29:11] she was hearing and she was hearing and
[1:29:13] the ASA tell her about Isaac I mean she
[1:29:16] became more like trouble all the time
[1:29:18] hallelujah I was like eternity was
[1:29:21] bumping bumping into her I mean changing
[1:29:25] her changing her but then eventually and
[1:29:28] to me that's like a CO threes they come
[1:29:30] close they bump into us hallelujah men
[1:29:34] we begin to hear from them more and more
[1:29:36] right but then eventually you're not
[1:29:39] just gonna bump into us ain't never
[1:29:40] actually get a hold of us right we're
[1:29:43] gonna become one with them I mean your
[1:29:46] father hallelujah sighs our eternity is
[1:29:48] literally get a comments carry us away I
[1:29:50] mean because as we become more like the
[1:29:52] word hallelujah
[1:29:53] I'm ending as you become more like kid
[1:29:55] bottle side what I have in my mind is
[1:29:58] down with my bride

[1:30:02] bride
[1:30:05] hallelujah amen this is where we have
[1:30:09] friends
[1:30:11] we closed it too there than here
[1:30:16] I think we should rejoice but a God that
[1:30:22] called you as the God that will rapture
[1:30:24] you
[1:30:25] I mean the God that called you unwashed
[1:30:27] you insane you he'll deliver you from
[1:30:28] all your fear in trouble I mean the
[1:30:30] battle is the Lord's hallelujah memory

[1:30:55] about it amen

[1:30:57] tried work it out in your human
[1:30:59] understanding I mean I'm trying to

[2:15:42] Lord everybody would walk in that light
[2:15:44] as you are the light Lord and we have
[2:15:47] fellowship one with another Lord and
[2:15:49] we'll commune one with another Lord even
[2:15:51] in our rooms Lord when we when we think
[2:15:53] God it's not worth it Lord we can't do
