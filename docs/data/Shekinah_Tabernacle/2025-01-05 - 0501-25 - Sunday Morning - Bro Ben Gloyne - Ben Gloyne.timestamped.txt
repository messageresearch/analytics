[5:40] Cliffords. Do I see any new anymore? I

[5:50] You good? Ready to ready to worship the
[5:52] Lord? Feeling good? Feeling like
[5:53] refreshed? Feeling Feeling like you're

[5:57] Amen.
[5:58] Amen. You know, I was
[6:02] um you know, I just had this picture.
[6:05] There's a
[6:07] saying, you would have heard it, that
[6:09] when the cats away, the mice come out to
[6:12] play. You know, it's like when something
[6:14] dominant leaves, then all these little
[6:16] pesky things come around and try
[6:19] and play around where they shouldn't
[6:22] actually be. It's just that this more
[6:24] dominant thing isn't there to kind of
[6:26] chase these little mice away. you know,
[6:28] the cat's not there. Often times it's
[6:30] like that in our life. You know, we
[6:32] sometimes it seems like the Lord's not
[6:34] left us, but you know, he kind of isn't
[6:36] at a certain place and then these little
[6:38] these little things come and try and
[6:40] mess in our life. You know, they just
[6:41] come and they hang around where they
[6:42] shouldn't be. You know, we start to get
[6:44] troubles and little things in areas of
[6:46] our life where they where they shouldn't
[6:48] be. These little pesky little let's call
[6:53] them in this case, let's call them
[6:55] hyenas. you know, they just come around
[6:57] to try and mess around.
[6:59] But, you know, it's a powerful thing
[7:01] when the, you know, when the lion of the
[7:04] tribe of
[7:07] Judah, you know, there's a point in time
[7:09] where he awakes, you know, and he he
[7:12] wanders over to where he to to his
[7:14] territory that's maybe being messed
[7:16] around with, you know, where these
[7:17] things are in our life and he just comes
[7:18] over and, you know, the minute he
[7:20] arrives, everything that's there is
[7:22] scared.
[7:23] you're
[7:24] scared because you know he's really the
[7:26] king of the jungle and all these little
[7:28] things that are there. You know, if
[7:30] you've got anything in your life this
[7:31] morning like that, let's just call the
[7:33] lion of the tribe of Judah to that place
[7:35] in our life to walk in. The minute he
[7:37] arrives, the moment every one of those
[7:40] creatures are scared cuz they know in
[7:42] their heart who the king of the jungle
[7:44] is. And that's why we come here this
[7:46] morning to actually say, "Lord, come
[7:47] into every area of my life. Lord, if
[7:50] there's that that little place where
[7:52] these things are plaguing me, go there,
[7:53] Lord. All you need to do is go there the
[7:56] moment you arrive there. These things
[7:58] start to go. So, let's invite the the
[8:00] the the lion of the tribe of Judah here
[8:03] this morning to to let's stand and just
[8:05] just we believe God's going to move in a
[8:07] powerful way this morning. I believe
[8:08] he's going to meet us in a powerful way.
[8:10] I can already feel his atmosphere here.
[8:13] So, Lord, we just Lord want to invite
[8:15] you here, Lord, to our midst this
[8:17] morning.

[8:24] Lord, it's not just a normal event.
[8:27] Things don't stay the same when you
[8:28] arrive, Lord. Lord, you've got so much
[8:31] dominance, so much power, Lord, you
[8:34] command so much fear, so much respect.
[8:37] Lord, so much
[8:39] authority, Lord Jesus, that anywhere
[8:41] that you go, Lord, things
[8:44] change. Things don't remain the same,
[8:46] Lord. when when you walk into a place,
[8:48] Lord God, cuz you, Lord, you're the all
[8:50] powerful, almighty king, Lord God. Lord,
[8:54] you're the ruler, Lord.
[8:57] Lord, and we just pray, Lord, that you'd
[9:00] go to every place in our life this
[9:01] morning, Lord, that needs dominion,
[9:04] Lord. If there's a place in our life
[9:05] that's overrun by anything, Lord, we
[9:07] pray that the King would come in and
[9:08] take dominion there, Lord God.
[9:12] Lord, that the all powerful almighty
[9:13] king would come in and take dominion,
[9:15] Lord. So we invite you into our midst
[9:17] this morning, Lord. Take dominion of
[9:19] this place this morning. Lord, make all
[9:21] the demons scatter, Lord God. All these
[9:24] things that would try and plague us,
[9:25] make them scatter this morning, Lord
[9:27] God, as the king comes in, Lord Jesus.

[41:30] of the world that we should be holy and
[41:32] without blame before him in love. having
[41:34] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[41:37] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[41:39] according to the good pleasure of his
[41:41] will to the praise of the glory of his
[41:43] grace wherein he hath made us accepted

[42:09] together for good to them that love God
[42:11] and to them who are who are the called
[42:14] according to his purpose. For whom he
[42:17] did forno, he also did predestinate to
[42:19] be conformed to the image of his son,
[42:21] that he might be the firstborn among
[42:23] many brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[42:25] predestinate, them he also called. And
[42:28] whom he called, them he also justified.
[42:30] And whom he justified, them he also
[42:32] glorified. What shall we say then to
[42:35] these things? If God before us, who can
[42:38] be against us? Hallelujah. Amen. Let's
[42:42] pray together this morning. Praise the
[42:44] Lord. Gracious father. Hallelujah. Lord,
[42:47] we thank you for your word. Thank you,
[42:49] Lord.
[42:51] Hallelujah. Thank you. We can bow our
[42:54] heads and say thank you, Jesus, for all
[42:56] you've done and all you're doing. Lord,
[42:57] we praise your holy name this day. We
[43:00] thank you, Lord. We're not alone, Lord,
[43:01] in this place. Father, already we
[43:03] already know your great presence is here
[43:04] among us, Lord. Father, because you said
[43:07] in your word, where two or three
[43:08] gathered in my name, there you are in
[43:09] the midst, Lord. So, we're so thankful
[43:11] we can take you at your word and we can
[43:12] say you are here. Father, we pray, Lord,
[43:14] that you would supercharge our faith,
[43:16] Lord. Raise us into heavenly places like
[43:18] never before. Father, may every demon
[43:20] spirit be bound in the name of Jesus
[43:22] Christ and may you have preeminence
[43:24] every life. Father, may we all place you
[43:26] in the highest place, dear God. We thank
[43:28] you, Father, for your unfailing power of
[43:30] your blood. We thank you, Lord, you're
[43:32] here. We pray you'd touch each life, be
[43:34] it those who are watching as well by the
[43:35] way of the internet, Lord. Heal those
[43:37] who are sick in body and in spirit.
[43:39] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name, we thank
[43:41] you. Amen. Amen. God bless you friends.
[43:44] You can have your seats this morning.
[43:46] So, I want to talk about position power
[43:48] because of position uh today. So as we
[43:51] read there we just want to get this out
[43:52] of uh uh you know just put it let let's
[43:55] just start with this God has adopted he
[43:58] has predestinated us to the adoption or
[44:00] placing of children amen by Jesus Christ
[44:03] to himself that's what adoption means it
[44:05] means a placing of a child in the family
[44:07] right so he has predestinated us to do
[44:09] uh to to become that according to the
[44:11] good pleasure of his will so it's not
[44:13] that anything we have done or what even
[44:15] we want as the Bible says it's not him
[44:17] that welleth or runth but god but to God
[44:20] that shows mercy. Right? So that's the
[44:22] main thing. Now I just want to go
[44:25] through a couple of things today about
[44:26] about position because but I want to
[44:29] start off first with the fact that we
[44:31] are all uh kings and priests to our God.
[44:34] Right? So we all we all have a position
[44:36] of authority and power uh over over
[44:40] every enemy. Now, I just want to
[44:45] um as as uh let's just go here for a
[44:49] second. Now, we are now seated with him
[44:52] with power and authority over every
[44:54] devil. Oh, if you could only believe
[44:56] what God has given. But if you're not
[44:58] seated there, you don't have it. And if
[45:00] you're seated there and don't believe it
[45:02] and afraid to move, you'll never use it.
[45:04] But if you're seated there, you will use
[45:05] it at for you're ordained to do what you
[45:07] do. Amen. So God has placed us with
[45:10] authority. Now, how do you get to that
[45:12] position? You receive the baptism of the
[45:14] Holy Ghost. Amen. And because you're his
[45:16] child, you receive the baptism of the
[45:17] Holy Ghost. Right? So it's nothing that
[45:19] we do. It's what God has done for us.
[45:21] But by him dwelling in us, he gives us
[45:24] power and authority over every devil.
[45:26] Okay? So the position we're in is not a
[45:29] position of of weakness. It's a position
[45:31] of strength, right? It's a position of
[45:33] prevailing power. Now, the thing is,
[45:35] it's not who we are. It's where we are
[45:37] that matters and him, right? Like you
[45:41] look at this is not a very updated
[45:42] photo. We know there's Biden, you know,
[45:44] Trump and Biden that should be in this
[45:46] lineup, but this is the most, you know,
[45:47] this is uh uh this is all the US
[45:50] presidents from Theodore Roosevelt now
[45:52] down to Barack Obama right now. All of
[45:54] them have different personalities. All
[45:56] of them have different backgrounds. All
[45:57] of them have different parents. All of
[45:58] them have different probably levels of
[46:00] education, different experiences. But
[46:02] what ma but but what gave them the
[46:04] authority of being president is because
[46:06] they got placed in the position of
[46:08] president right and they got placed
[46:10] there not by sure they wanted to become
[46:12] president but it was a higher authority
[46:15] that placed them in that position. It
[46:17] wasn't their own ability alone that made
[46:21] them president. See these these men were
[46:23] not dictators. They weren't kings that
[46:25] had supreme authority but a greater
[46:27] authority to them placed them as a
[46:29] president. Right? So the Constitution of
[46:31] America and the voting system they have,
[46:34] whatever you say about it, that's not
[46:36] important right now. But what I want to
[46:37] say is that the the Constitution of
[46:39] America and their voting system placed
[46:42] these men in to become president.
[46:46] Before they were president, their words
[46:48] did not have much weight. It was just
[46:51] opinion at best. After they president,
[46:54] the same thing. Their words had a had a
[46:56] bit of weight, but really just opinion,
[46:58] but did not have the authority that it
[47:01] had when they were in office. Right now,
[47:03] as the bride of Jesus Christ, we're not
[47:05] elected, then voted out. Right? If God
[47:08] places us in, we stay in. Right? But you
[47:10] got to realize that because of our
[47:12] position in Christ, our words have great
[47:14] power. I mean, our words have great
[47:17] authority. Amen. When it's him speaking
[47:19] through you, because of your position,
[47:21] your words have great power. Brother
[47:23] said that a man filled with the Holy
[47:25] Ghost, amen, when he speaks, it's not
[47:27] him speaking, but deity speaking, every
[47:30] mountain has to move. Nothing can stand
[47:32] before that man. Now, if they speak
[47:34] according to uh uh what their nation is
[47:38] is is is wanting to project, I'd say
[47:40] then they really have
[47:41] authority. And we know when we pray,
[47:43] it's not our selfish ambition that we're
[47:45] praying. It's God's desire and ambition.
[47:48] So these men, they all came from
[47:50] different backgrounds, but they had
[47:51] power when they were placed in their
[47:53] position as president. I'll say the same
[47:55] thing with you and I friends. It doesn't
[47:57] matter our background. It's the fact
[47:59] that we're elected to be the bride of
[48:00] Jesus Christ. That's the thing that
[48:02] matters. Amen. But now there is
[48:05] a but we but we got to understand that
[48:08] that that our position is not one of
[48:11] lordship over each other.
[48:13] as even as John I mean sorry Jesus would
[48:16] be asked by the mother of James and John
[48:18] the sons of Zebedee. You know um she
[48:20] came to she came to um she came to Jesus
[48:24] and asked you know can my can my sons
[48:27] sit on your left and right hand and
[48:30] Jesus would ask them saying do you know
[48:32] what you know do you know what uh
[48:34] baptism you know uh can you drink the
[48:36] cup that I've received and can you be
[48:38] baptized with the baptism that I'm
[48:39] baptized with? They said yes we can.
[48:42] Jesus said unto them, "Ye shall indeed
[48:44] drink of the cup that I drink of, and
[48:46] with the baptism I'm baptized, with all
[48:48] shall you be baptized." But he said,
[48:50] "But to sit on my right and left hand is
[48:52] not mine to give, but it shall be given
[48:54] to them whom it is prepared." Now,
[48:56] Brother Bram says that this position was
[48:58] not in existence at that time. It's for
[48:59] the overcomer. There's a pre but but
[49:02] that but but that position of authority
[49:04] is given to those who it's been prepared
[49:06] for, which is you and
[49:08] I, right? But then but then the the 10
[49:11] heard that they be to be displeased with
[49:13] James and John. But Jesus called to them
[49:16] and said to them, "Ye know uh ye know
[49:19] that they which be accounted to rule
[49:21] over the Gentiles exercise lordship over
[49:23] them and their great ones um exercise
[49:26] authority over them, but it not but it
[49:28] shall not be among you." So this is a
[49:31] different kind of a leadership,
[49:32] different kind of authority, different
[49:34] kind of dominion that you're going to
[49:35] have. You're not going to be like these
[49:36] gentile kings that just give whims of um
[49:39] decrees and you know all these things.
[49:41] But no, because it says but but
[49:43] whosoever shall be great among you shall
[49:45] be your minister. Right now you got to
[49:47] realize that the positions we're placed
[49:48] in is a position of really humility.
[49:51] Amen. It's not a it's not a law because
[49:53] if someone thinks that they are better
[49:55] than the sinner on the street because
[49:57] they're the bride of Jesus Christ, I'll
[49:58] tell you one thing, they haven't come to
[50:00] that position yet.
[50:03] God don't make stuff shirts that they
[50:04] think they're everything. Oh, that
[50:06] person is just not that you know
[50:08] people's opinion that person is just not
[50:09] it. They're not going to get nowhere.
[50:11] That person hasn't been seated in
[50:13] heavenly places yet if they've got that
[50:14] opinion. Right? Because we've come to
[50:16] minister. We haven't come to be
[50:18] ministered to. We've come to minister.
[50:20] Right? We've come to give our lives.
[50:21] Serve one another. Serve Amen. wherever
[50:24] we are. And whosoever you shall be the
[50:27] chiefest, let him be the servant of all.
[50:30] And even the son of man came not to be
[50:32] ministered unto but to minister and to
[50:34] give his life for a ransom for many. Now
[50:38] I just want to go back to this. What
[50:40] good would it be if these men were in uh
[50:42] as president but didn't use the office
[50:44] of
[50:45] president. What a waste of four years
[50:49] right? If they were elected but they
[50:50] didn't use a single they didn't do a
[50:51] single thing to help their country go
[50:54] forward. You know they had they had a
[50:57] desire in their heart. I want to I want
[50:59] to make my country go forward. Right?
[51:00] Because they had a they were they were
[51:02] placed in that position because they but
[51:04] you see and it's the same thing with you
[51:06] and I friends. We're not here just to be
[51:08] idle for the kingdom of God. I'm not now
[51:11] I'm not even talking about evangelism.
[51:12] I'm talking about our home life. What
[51:14] kind of environment are we because a son
[51:16] or or a son or daughter of God that's
[51:18] placed in the body has a job to do.
[51:20] Right? Even as Adam and Eve they are
[51:22] placed in the garden and God told them
[51:24] have dominion, subdue, you
[51:26] know, take
[51:28] over. So, so we in our in our positions
[51:32] have been given a mandate. Subdue, take
[51:35] dominion, further it, don't let chaos
[51:37] because we know that that you know
[51:40] there's never a void. Especially when
[51:42] God has levels of leadership and
[51:44] headship and different things, there's
[51:46] something that will, you know, a void is
[51:49] always filled by something. And when I
[51:51] go and talk about, you know, uh,
[51:53] fathers, I mean, yeah, fathers and
[51:54] mothers and all the, you know, sometimes
[51:56] none of us, maybe some of us never had a
[51:58] father or a mother, right? We all come
[52:01] from different backgrounds. You say,
[52:02] "Well, then am I at a disadvantage?" Not
[52:04] necessarily if you let God fill that
[52:07] void, right? If you let God fill that
[52:09] vacuum, you're not a disadvantage
[52:11] because he wants to be your father. He
[52:13] wants to be your mother. He wants to be
[52:14] your brother. He wants to be your
[52:16] friend. He wants to be your counselor.
[52:18] Don't let the devil be your counselor.
[52:20] Don't let hashtag trending whatever
[52:22] death scrolling, doom scrolling be your
[52:24] counselor and your comfort. Let him be
[52:26] your comfort.
[52:28] Right? So, so we got to realize we can't
[52:31] because voids are always filled when it
[52:33] comes to leadership and headship because
[52:35] you know we're placed in a power of
[52:37] position. So now we take for example one
[52:40] here. This is I got a few pictures to
[52:42] show just to keep the children engaged.
[52:44] This is Ahab. Ahab's just uh gone down.
[52:48] He seen Neabboth's vineyard, which he
[52:49] would he would look over from his palace
[52:51] cuz the his uh Neabboth's vineyard was
[52:53] hard against his palace wall and he'd
[52:56] look at it. Then he just came to a
[52:58] decision one day. I want this. I want
[53:00] this uh I want his vineyard. Now, Ahab
[53:04] was in the office of a king, but he
[53:06] wasn't exercising what God says a king
[53:09] should be. He wasn't like David at all.
[53:11] He was the polar opposite of David, a
[53:13] man after God's own heart. And so Ahab
[53:16] went to Nabboth and said, "Nabboth, I
[53:18] want to buy your vineyard. I want to
[53:19] turn it to a garden of herbs, and I'll
[53:21] give you even a better vineyard." So, so
[53:23] Ahab actually had a better vineyard than
[53:24] Nabboth's vineyard. He just wanted it
[53:26] cuz it was there. He wanted to turn it
[53:27] into a garden of herbs. This is in 2
[53:29] Kings 21. But then what happened is is
[53:33] Nabboth because because a true son or
[53:35] daughter of God in their position will
[53:37] never go against the word of God. So
[53:39] Nabboth was in his position saying, "I
[53:41] can't sell you this because it's got to
[53:43] remain in my family according to the
[53:45] word." Right? And then so Nabboth
[53:48] Nabboth said this to the king. And and
[53:50] the king, what did he do? He threw a
[53:52] pity
[53:54] party. It says here in verse three here,
[53:56] and Nabboth said to Ahab, "The Lord
[53:58] forbidth me that I give you the
[53:59] inheritance of my father unto thee." And
[54:02] Ahab came into his house heavy and
[54:04] displeased because the word which
[54:05] Nabboth the Jezraelite had spoken to
[54:07] him. Fred said, "I will not give thee
[54:09] the inheritance of my father's." And he
[54:11] laid down upon his bed and turned his
[54:13] face and would not eat no bread. So he's
[54:16] sulking.
[54:18] He's got he's he's having an adult
[54:19] temper tantrum because he's in the
[54:22] office of a king, but he's not he
[54:23] doesn't have the character to fill that
[54:25] office. Right? So So now because he's in
[54:29] this condition, there's a void.
[54:31] because he's not there actually ruling.
[54:33] He's just he's just basically a puppet
[54:35] now because of his own failures of a of
[54:38] a of a man. We should never we should
[54:40] never throw a tantrum because we don't
[54:42] get things our way, young and old,
[54:45] right? He threw a big, you know, he's
[54:48] the king of Israel or whatever and he's
[54:50] throwing a tantrum because he can't have
[54:51] this vineyard here. So then what happens
[54:54] is now there's a void that's in his a
[54:57] void in his life. And so Jezebel who's
[54:59] really because he's not the leader of
[55:02] course there's a void. So what fills the
[55:04] void? Jezebel fills the void. Dominating
[55:07] female fills the void. And then so what
[55:10] happens is she says well I'll write
[55:12] letters in in in your name and I'll get
[55:15] you the vineyard. Now isn't it
[55:17] interesting when you when you hear
[55:18] people speak when you hear maybe even
[55:20] sisters or wives speak and they'll quote
[55:23] their their their husband's name. Oh, he
[55:26] says this and he thinks this and he
[55:28] should, you know, he says this, but he
[55:29] doesn't say a peep. What is that? That's
[55:32] a dominating female using the her father
[55:36] uh her husband's name for authority just
[55:38] like Jezebel did. I say that husband's
[55:41] not in his position, but neither is she.
[55:44] You see? So, so there are positions, but
[55:47] those positions will always be filled by
[55:49] something.
[55:51] Amen. So, we don't want to be an
[55:53] Ahab. Amen. Do you know the reason why
[55:56] there's so many woman preachers in this
[55:58] age? Because the word does not have
[56:01] authority there. Brother Bam gives an
[56:03] account of a of a of a woman. She was a
[56:05] woman preacher. But then but then when
[56:08] when her and her husband came to the
[56:10] message, that gift went on the husband
[56:12] and he began to preach.
[56:15] There's a void. The word is not in those
[56:18] places. So it actually causes, you know,
[56:20] women who shouldn't be preaching to
[56:21] preach because they're not in their
[56:23] position because the word is not there
[56:25] in its position. If the word was in
[56:27] Ahab's kingdom properly, it wasn't the
[56:29] Baal, but it was actually God was there.
[56:31] The word was there. It wouldn't be
[56:32] Jezebel exercising authority. Actually,
[56:35] when Nabbal said, "I can't give it to
[56:37] you." Ahab wouldn't have been sulking.
[56:39] He would have said, "Praise the Lord."
[56:40] That's true.
[56:42] Because the word rules this kingdom, not
[56:44] what I want, not what they want, but
[56:46] what God wants.
[56:48] Amen. So we must always always remember
[56:50] that there are voids can be there but
[56:54] what do you let fill it?
[56:58] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[57:00] Now as I said that we are we are living
[57:04] stones. We are we we all have a holy
[57:07] priesthood. This is men and women. So
[57:09] I'm going to probably diverge between
[57:11] the both and bring them back together
[57:13] and diverge the both. Okay? Because as a
[57:16] husband, I can't be a wife naturally
[57:18] speaking. I know that's pretty obvious
[57:20] to all of us here. Neither neither can
[57:23] my wife be a
[57:25] husband, right? We have two distinct
[57:28] roles, right? But yet we have supreme
[57:32] power over hell individually because we
[57:36] are part of the bride of Jesus Christ,
[57:38] right? So we all have we we all have
[57:41] him. He should be under our feet.
[57:45] Amen. You say, "Well, I'm I'm nothing in
[57:47] the body of Christ." Well, I'll tell you
[57:49] this. If you're the little if you're the
[57:51] skin on the bottom of the little toe of
[57:52] the body of Christ, you're still on the
[57:54] head of the devil. Amen. You still have
[57:57] power over him. Amen. If you are the
[57:59] little, you say, "I'm nothing." But if
[58:00] you're part of the body, you're still on
[58:02] his head. Right? So, you got to realize
[58:04] this. So we are we are built up as a
[58:06] spiritual house a royal priesthood
[58:08] accepting up spiritual I mean to offer
[58:10] up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
[58:12] God by Jesus Christ. Amen. As as as
[58:16] Peter would continue saying that but ye
[58:18] are a chosen generation a royal
[58:21] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[58:23] people. Amen. What so what does a royal
[58:26] what does a priest do? It it it it
[58:28] contacts God right? It brings communion
[58:32] with God. Amen. If there was ever a time
[58:34] that this world needs Jesus Christ is
[58:36] right now. Amen. Well, where is he going
[58:38] to flow through? Through his word in his
[58:40] body. Amen. God needs your hands, your
[58:43] feet, your mouth. Amen. Never let the
[58:45] devil think that you are not effective
[58:46] against him or your problems too big.
[58:50] But there comes a time when when when
[58:52] the sons and daughters of God break the
[58:54] strangle hold of the devil. Amen.
[58:58] Amen. Amen. We got to realize that it's
[58:59] the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in
[59:01] condition of fellowship. Amen. John
[59:04] said, "God is able for these rocks to
[59:06] raise up children unto Abraham." God,
[59:08] how we thank you that we can speak to
[59:09] you. We are so thankful uh to be on
[59:12] speaking terms. The blood of Jesus
[59:13] Christ puts us in this condition. Amen.
[59:16] I pray, Father, you forgive every sin of
[59:17] the people in here. Take uh take us all
[59:20] together tonight. Father, forgive our
[59:22] sins, heal our sickness. May the Lord
[59:24] God of heaven show forth his power and
[59:25] his glory upon amen this people. Amen.
[59:29] So you got to realize doesn't matter how
[59:30] you feel. His blood puts you in speaking
[59:33] terms with him. Mean because you're
[59:35] you're a royal priesthood. Amen. You're
[59:38] built to contact God. God to contact you
[59:40] and God to speak through your life.
[59:43] We're not here we are not here just to
[59:45] take up time.
[59:48] We're here to to now I just want to drop
[59:50] back to this because many people
[59:52] misunderstand adoption in terms of the
[59:56] power of a position. Many people think
[59:58] well ministry and different things but
[1:00:00] no you can be as brother would say the
[1:00:03] church positionally before the
[1:00:04] foundation of the world when God and his
[1:00:06] labor pain was bringing forth bringing
[1:00:08] forth you knowing what you would do he
[1:00:11] positionally placed you into his own
[1:00:12] body to be a housewife.
[1:00:15] Amen. if you're a housewife and and
[1:00:17] that's even a sister who works as a
[1:00:19] housewife by the way right but that is
[1:00:23] an adopted position in the body of
[1:00:25] Christ
[1:00:28] we I think we make things too complex or
[1:00:31] too lofty
[1:00:32] because many times people think well
[1:00:34] when I'm placed in my position in the
[1:00:36] body then I'll have prevailing power
[1:00:37] then I'll really do something no but
[1:00:39] your everyday life who you are amen as a
[1:00:43] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:00:44] preacher to be a prophet or to be this
[1:00:46] or that. He placed you positionally.
[1:00:50] Amen. So now if you're if you're in your
[1:00:52] position, why don't you use that
[1:00:53] position? Why don't you let God why
[1:00:55] don't you let your faith go into action?
[1:00:58] Amen. Where it's more than just idle
[1:00:59] empty talk, but a reality of God begins
[1:01:01] to come into your home. I mean, because
[1:01:03] of the position he's placed you in, not
[1:01:06] because of who you are. Like you like I
[1:01:08] said about the presidents, you know,
[1:01:09] they all had different personalities. It
[1:01:11] didn't matter who they were the officer
[1:01:13] in mattered. And that's the same thing
[1:01:15] with you. The devil wants you to look at
[1:01:17] yourself. You need to look at your
[1:01:18] position in Christ. Say, "God, you've
[1:01:20] placed me in your body. I'm part of you.
[1:01:22] By your word, by your supreme grace,
[1:01:25] you've made me part of you, Lord. I'm in
[1:01:27] this office. You've elected me, Lord.
[1:01:29] I'm going to stand in this position, and
[1:01:30] I'm going to exercise the God-given
[1:01:32] authority you've given me." And the
[1:01:35] church says, "Amen." Hallelujah. This
[1:01:37] is, see, see, many times we get
[1:01:39] intimidated. Oh, can I do it? Well,
[1:01:41] God's made you to do it. God's made you
[1:01:43] to believe his word. That's really Do
[1:01:46] you believe his word this morning? Do
[1:01:48] you believe his word? Well, then you are
[1:01:49] positionally placed. If I can make me,
[1:01:51] well, that's too simple. No, take him at
[1:01:53] his word. It's not a feeling. It's not
[1:01:56] how I feel. They would have woken up.
[1:01:58] Some days I feel like a president. Some
[1:02:00] days I'd have woken up middle of a
[1:02:02] crisis. Lord, help me. if they're
[1:02:03] praying people. I don't know, you know,
[1:02:06] but you know, it's like I've said, you
[1:02:07] know, like I asked my well, I've never
[1:02:09] asked him the question, but you know,
[1:02:10] like myself, people ask me, well, no, no
[1:02:13] one's asked me, but what does it feel
[1:02:15] like to be a glowin? Like the devil
[1:02:18] wants you to have a certain, he says,
[1:02:19] you don't feel like a Christian today.
[1:02:20] Who's had that feeling? Brother Bram
[1:02:23] says there's days when he doesn't even
[1:02:24] feel like he was saved.
[1:02:26] Didn't change him from being a prophet
[1:02:27] messenger to the age of a son of God,
[1:02:31] right? It's like, so the devil wants you
[1:02:33] to go by a feeling. It's like, you could
[1:02:35] ask me, what does it feel like to be a
[1:02:37] Gloian? I don't know.
[1:02:39] Sometimes I feel like this. Sometimes I
[1:02:41] feel up. Sometimes I feel down.
[1:02:42] Sometimes I feel happy, sad. I feel all
[1:02:45] kind of feelings.
[1:02:47] It doesn't change who I am. How about
[1:02:50] you today? How about your feelings? Do
[1:02:52] you go by I'm a Christian cuz I feel a
[1:02:54] certain way. I need to a certain mindset
[1:02:57] and I'm good. No, you don't know. Just
[1:02:59] like these guys, troubled, not troubled,
[1:03:01] at peace, trouble, whatever, didn't
[1:03:03] matter. They're still president. Amen.
[1:03:05] Same thing with you and I, friends. We
[1:03:08] are the sons and daughters of God.
[1:03:10] You've got to believe what God says
[1:03:11] about you and then begin to exercise
[1:03:15] your God-given authority.
[1:03:18] Amen. Brother Brandon says, "In perfect
[1:03:20] faith." Now, the only thing you have to
[1:03:21] do then is have faith in what you are.
[1:03:24] Have faith in what the word says you
[1:03:25] are. You see, as God has placed us,
[1:03:28] let's just keep reading this. And Jesus
[1:03:30] had faith in the word that said what he
[1:03:33] was. It's written of me. Didn't David
[1:03:34] and the Psalms and the prophets and all
[1:03:36] them speak of him? I am the bread of
[1:03:38] life that came from God out of heaven.
[1:03:40] Amen. I am the tree of life from the
[1:03:42] garden of Eden. I am all these things. I
[1:03:44] am that I am. He knew uh what uh uh with
[1:03:47] that perfect faith that he was the
[1:03:49] anointed Messiah, that the spirit of God
[1:03:51] was upon him. He said, "Now I in myself
[1:03:54] do nothing, but it's my faith in God,
[1:03:57] and God was in him, and the uh the word
[1:04:00] made manifest, and when the word of God
[1:04:02] comes in you, it's made manifest. And
[1:04:04] you are a believer." See, a believer is
[1:04:06] the faith of God that moves in you. So,
[1:04:09] you got to have faith in what God says
[1:04:11] you are. We're going to start believing
[1:04:13] what God's made us to be. That's right.
[1:04:15] Already, like the Bible says, now we are
[1:04:17] the sons of God. Oh, one day, one day
[1:04:19] when the squeeze, no, we are right now.
[1:04:21] There's already a squeeze coming on,
[1:04:23] right? We've already been conditioned to
[1:04:25] overcome in this season.
[1:04:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. So now, as I
[1:04:31] said, now we've got to put our faith
[1:04:33] into our faith into action. I'm just
[1:04:37] going to go through a couple of couple
[1:04:39] of ones here. David was an he was an
[1:04:42] anointed king of Israel as a shepherd
[1:04:46] boy, right? He was anointed as a
[1:04:48] shepherd boy because in him was
[1:04:49] kingship, right? in him was kingship.
[1:04:52] Now, there's something about when a man
[1:04:53] gets anointed by the spirit of God.
[1:04:56] There's something happens that real
[1:04:57] manhood can only come when the spirit of
[1:04:59] God fills your life. I mean, remember
[1:05:01] this is an age where manhood has been
[1:05:03] broken. Not just womanhood, manhood's
[1:05:05] been broken. Amen. Where it's turned
[1:05:07] into a generation of people just doom
[1:05:09] scrolling, playing games, wanting to
[1:05:11] escape into something. The thing we
[1:05:13] should escape into is the revelation of
[1:05:15] Jesus Christ. I mean, that's the thing
[1:05:16] we should escape into. Amen. When you
[1:05:18] get so troubled in life, just escape.
[1:05:20] Your escapism should be the word of God.
[1:05:23] Amen. Because that will give you the
[1:05:24] solution. That will give you your help
[1:05:26] that you need. Amen. But you see what
[1:05:28] happens is an anointed son of God in his
[1:05:30] office does not put up with a stalemate.
[1:05:34] There was a stalemate for 40 days.
[1:05:35] Imagine 40 days of this giant that
[1:05:37] wasn't actually that big. We all
[1:05:38] remember camp, don't we? Right. He
[1:05:40] wasn't actually that big. Amen. But he
[1:05:42] made his boast. The devil puts a
[1:05:44] condition because a man is made to have
[1:05:47] dominion. Right? We're built to have
[1:05:49] dominion. And of course, if you're a
[1:05:51] Christian, you'll have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:52] will have dominion in your uh in your
[1:05:54] life. So that means that his anointing
[1:05:56] in you will have priority. We'll have
[1:05:58] number one position if you're a man.
[1:06:01] Right? So then when anything else comes
[1:06:03] in and it tries to dictate to you how
[1:06:05] things should be, you'll be like, "No,
[1:06:07] I'm not putting up with this thing."
[1:06:09] See, David heard the boast of Goliath
[1:06:11] like all the rest of Israel. But David
[1:06:13] said, "Who is this uncircumcised
[1:06:14] Philistine?" You see, he identified
[1:06:17] Goliath has no position in Christ.
[1:06:21] He's uncircumcised. He has no covenant.
[1:06:23] He has no dealings with God. And but he
[1:06:25] knew who he was. David knew he's a
[1:06:28] circumcised son of Abraham. He was
[1:06:30] anointed. He was in his promised land.
[1:06:32] He knew who he was. And he had faith in
[1:06:35] what he was. Amen. Amen. He was going to
[1:06:38] the throne. This thing's not going to
[1:06:41] stop me. This thing is not going to stop
[1:06:43] me. It may stop the rest of Israel. is
[1:06:45] not going to stop me. And friends, we're
[1:06:46] on our way to a throne and overcome his
[1:06:48] throne. So whatever tries to stop you,
[1:06:50] you got to realize this thing's going
[1:06:52] down today. Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] Amen. That's this should be our
[1:06:57] mentality. And indifference comes into
[1:06:59] our life. This ain't stopping me. Amen.
[1:07:02] Trouble comes into the home. This ain't
[1:07:04] stopping me. Amen. Unbelief tries to
[1:07:06] creep in. Fear tries to grip your life.
[1:07:08] This ain't stopping me. Amen. Oh, the
[1:07:10] problem's too big. This ain't stopping
[1:07:11] me.
[1:07:13] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:16] Amen. Shouldn't we be that way?
[1:07:18] Shouldn't we be that way? I want to lift
[1:07:19] up the head of that devil. Hallelujah.
[1:07:22] Amen. Cause everyone because because
[1:07:24] remember, we've come to minister to one
[1:07:26] another. What did David minister to
[1:07:29] Israel? God can do it. God's more than
[1:07:32] able. Amen. God is present. Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] Should not should that should that not
[1:07:37] be our lives? Amen. Where where where
[1:07:39] the whole ambition of our life should be
[1:07:41] God, you're real. I want everyone else
[1:07:43] to know you're real. I want you to come
[1:07:44] down through my life and have dominion
[1:07:46] in everyone else's life around me. Not
[1:07:48] my personality, your word.
[1:07:52] Hallelujah. So, we should not have to
[1:07:53] put up with, well, it's been this way
[1:07:55] all of our lives and our generations
[1:07:56] were this way. This is just how things
[1:07:58] are. Let God anoint you. Let this word
[1:08:02] take over.
[1:08:04] Hallelujah. You'll be doubting a
[1:08:05] Philistine and well, this is just how I
[1:08:07] am. This is just no you in your home.
[1:08:12] can have dominion in such well God can
[1:08:14] have dominion in such a way you step in
[1:08:16] the door you feel his presence amen
[1:08:19] there's peace in your home you go to bed
[1:08:21] there's peace and as soon as trouble
[1:08:22] gets in you see the problem is with the
[1:08:24] Israel here they got used to Goliath
[1:08:27] boasting it became in 40 days you you'll
[1:08:30] adapt right you'll become a creature of
[1:08:33] habit in 40 days if if the same thing
[1:08:35] happened twice a day for 40 days I
[1:08:37] guarantee it just become and so they got
[1:08:39] used to living in this fear they got
[1:08:41] used to this. But to David, it wasn't
[1:08:43] normal cuz he was used to the presence
[1:08:45] of God around him. See, he was in his
[1:08:48] position as a son of God. So when this
[1:08:50] fear tried to grip him too, he said,
[1:08:52] "No, I'm not putting up with this. This
[1:08:53] is foreign to me."
[1:08:56] Amen. Indifference, coldness,
[1:09:00] lukewarmness, fear, double-mindedness,
[1:09:02] all those things should be foreign to
[1:09:04] us. It doesn't mean it won't try and
[1:09:06] come upon you, but when it does, say,
[1:09:07] "Hey, I'm not used to this. This is not
[1:09:09] right. I'm not putting up with this
[1:09:11] thing.
[1:09:12] Amen.
[1:09:14] Don't lose heart, friends. We ain't lost
[1:09:16] the war.
[1:09:18] You ain't lost the war. You got life in
[1:09:20] your body. You got faith in your heart.
[1:09:23] Amen. You got prevailing faith. See,
[1:09:25] just because you're a son of God doesn't
[1:09:26] mean it won't everything will just be
[1:09:28] easy for you. You can look back in your
[1:09:30] life. David could say, "Look, I got a
[1:09:32] lion skin. I got a bear skin. I got now
[1:09:34] the head of Goliath."
[1:09:37] Amen. God never failed him. Did God ever
[1:09:40] fail him? Never failed him. Not one day
[1:09:42] did God fail him. He was with him on the
[1:09:45] run. He was with him in trouble. He was
[1:09:47] with him in the cave, with him in the
[1:09:48] Philistine land. He was with them when
[1:09:50] when when they went back to Ziglag and
[1:09:52] Ziglag was on fire. They didn't know
[1:09:54] where their family was. God was with
[1:09:56] him. Amen. Hallelujah. What about you
[1:09:59] and I friends? God hasn't forsaken you.
[1:10:01] Amen. God didn't forsake David. Even
[1:10:03] when David did horrible things, God
[1:10:05] didn't forsake him because he was his
[1:10:06] son.
[1:10:08] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:11] Take that, devil. That's right. The
[1:10:13] devil wants to make you think you've
[1:10:14] gone too far. You've put a foot too
[1:10:16] wrong and all this stuff. No, it's not
[1:10:18] based on what you do. But my children
[1:10:20] are my children.
[1:10:22] They're part of me. Hallelujah. Whatever
[1:10:24] they do, wherever they go, they're mine.
[1:10:27] Amen. How much does more God think of
[1:10:29] that? Thinks of you. They're my
[1:10:31] children. No one can pluck them out of
[1:10:34] my hand. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:37] Hallelujah.
[1:10:39] Amen. I believe that. Don't you see if
[1:10:42] we could just look at things through
[1:10:43] God's eyes. See, David, when he was
[1:10:46] saying, "I'm going to take your head
[1:10:46] off," that was God saying, "Satan, your
[1:10:49] head's coming off."
[1:10:51] Hallelujah. Remember, because God has
[1:10:53] not given us a spirit of fear, but power
[1:10:55] and of love and a sound mind. Amen. So,
[1:10:58] when that spirit of fear tries to come
[1:10:59] on, you say, "No, this ain't this is
[1:11:02] stopping right here. This is stopping
[1:11:04] right here." here. You got to realize if
[1:11:05] the devil's against you, that's a good
[1:11:07] thing cuz you're not on his side.
[1:11:10] Amen. If he's waring against you, that's
[1:11:12] a good thing cuz he wants something that
[1:11:14] you've got. Amen. Your soul and you've
[1:11:17] given it to another.
[1:11:19] You're part of God. Amen. So, don't be
[1:11:22] fearful. You say, "Man, there's a lot of
[1:11:23] trouble. I don't know the way out."
[1:11:24] Jesus is the way out. He's the way when
[1:11:26] there seems to be no way. Amen. The
[1:11:29] devil comes you says, "You've heard that
[1:11:30] for years and years and years, but there
[1:11:32] comes a day." Yes. There comes a day.
[1:11:35] Amen. Just like for 40 days, they heard
[1:11:37] a lot of things. Oh, come on. Come on.
[1:11:39] What's going on here? The Israelites
[1:11:41] heard it for 40 days. Bring me a man.
[1:11:43] Bring me a man. No answer. Bring me a
[1:11:45] man. Where's God? Bring me a man. Saul,
[1:11:47] what are you doing? You should be
[1:11:48] fighting. Bring me a man. But then
[1:11:50] finally, a little boy stepped into the
[1:11:51] room.
[1:11:53] That's it. Amen. Anointed. Who's this
[1:11:55] guy? What is this fear really? When it
[1:11:58] when when you really when you see see
[1:12:00] the devil just he wants to be the main
[1:12:02] thing on the stage.
[1:12:04] He wants to take up your focal view to
[1:12:06] fill the whole view. Look how big I am.
[1:12:08] Look how great I am. Look what I've done
[1:12:10] in the past. Look what I've done to your
[1:12:11] family. Look at all these things. He
[1:12:13] wants to fill the whole view. Just take
[1:12:14] a step back. Because who's bigger than
[1:12:17] the devil is our God. Amen. That's
[1:12:20] right. Bring him into the picture.
[1:12:21] Whatever you do.
[1:12:24] Amen. But because of position now, we
[1:12:26] can turn the wrath of Almighty God
[1:12:27] against our enemy.
[1:12:29] Amen. We can do it. Amen. Esther became
[1:12:33] queen not because of who Esther was,
[1:12:37] because God elected her into that
[1:12:38] position. That because God knew she
[1:12:41] needed to be on the throne for a certain
[1:12:43] time. Amen. Because in the king now, now
[1:12:46] in our God is attributes, right? We know
[1:12:49] he's a father. He's a king. He's a
[1:12:51] judge. He's a healer. He's a counselor.
[1:12:54] He's a guide. He's a friend. He's a
[1:12:56] comforter. He's he's a lion of the tribe
[1:12:59] of Judah. Amen. He's the mighty one. and
[1:13:01] he's a mighty in battle. He's the
[1:13:02] conqueror. Amen. He's a defeater of our
[1:13:04] enemy. He's he's a man of war. All these
[1:13:07] things. But now God has placed us in a
[1:13:09] position in him to draw those attributes
[1:13:12] out of him. That's why when you go to
[1:13:14] prayer, what what are you really? You're
[1:13:15] calling on God that God's attributes
[1:13:18] will be released into your life. Lord,
[1:13:20] I'm sick. What are you doing? Lord, I'm
[1:13:21] pulling healing out of you by the faith
[1:13:23] you've given me. Because God wants to be
[1:13:26] expressed. He loves to express himself.
[1:13:28] He loves to show up and show himself
[1:13:30] mighty in battle. I mean, he loves to
[1:13:31] show himself as a comforter, as a guide,
[1:13:33] as a friend, as a healer. I mean, he
[1:13:36] loves to show himself, but he needs
[1:13:38] someone on the earth to call him on the
[1:13:40] scene.
[1:13:42] Amen. So, Esther, we know she had
[1:13:44] purpose in her heart. I know I've said
[1:13:45] this many times, but she had two things
[1:13:47] on her heart when she invited the king
[1:13:49] and her enemy to this banquet of wines.
[1:13:52] One is the salvation of her people. Two
[1:13:54] is the destruction of her enemy. And we
[1:13:56] know she was placed in this position in
[1:13:59] order for this to happen. Hallelujah. I
[1:14:02] mean, you've been placed as queen for a
[1:14:04] time such as this because God wants to
[1:14:07] be expressed upon the earth. Amen. So
[1:14:10] there she is. She created a banquet of
[1:14:11] wines. Yeah. And and and we know wine is
[1:14:14] a stimulation of the revelation of the
[1:14:15] word. That's why it's so important,
[1:14:18] friends. You feel dead is opposed. Start
[1:14:20] singing.
[1:14:21] Start praising. Start thinking about how
[1:14:24] God is. Let your thinking change. Amen.
[1:14:26] There's a battle going on in here. Amen.
[1:14:29] And the devil ain't welcome in this top
[1:14:31] two inches of my head. Right? He'll come
[1:14:34] in with doubt, double-mindedness. How do
[1:14:36] you know it's really going to work? How
[1:14:38] do you know this and this has happened
[1:14:39] and this is the problem? Start praising
[1:14:41] God.
[1:14:43] Amen. Start telling him how great he is.
[1:14:46] Amen. Start listening to the word. Start
[1:14:48] enjoying his word. You say, "Well, I
[1:14:50] don't feel like it." I had brother Ron
[1:14:52] Spencer years ago after, you know, he
[1:14:54] had that burn, he's blown up in that
[1:14:55] propane explosion, lost 80 odd% of his
[1:14:58] lung capacity, you know, all of his
[1:15:00] burns and all these things. He said he
[1:15:02] would actually literally with his nose
[1:15:04] turn the pages of his Bible to read it.
[1:15:07] He said, "Did I feel like it?" No. Many
[1:15:09] times I didn't, but he said, "I
[1:15:10] encouraged myself in the Lord."
[1:15:13] If a man with all those burns and all
[1:15:15] those things he's gone through can do
[1:15:16] that, how about you and I?
[1:15:20] Remember the state of this body doesn't
[1:15:22] change who we are in Christ.
[1:15:24] Amen. So Esther now turn the wrath of
[1:15:27] the king against Hmon. She created a
[1:15:29] banquet of wines and moved the heart of
[1:15:30] the king. L Esther, what is your
[1:15:32] request? I'll give you even up to half
[1:15:34] the kingdom, which means I I'll make you
[1:15:36] joint heir with me.
[1:15:39] And she says, "My life is in jeopardy in
[1:15:41] the life of my people. Why are we afraid
[1:15:43] to go before God?"
[1:15:46] You know, God is God is a zealous God.
[1:15:49] He's a jealous God. Amen. But it's up to
[1:15:52] us for God to use us that God's wrath
[1:15:55] will be turned against our enemy.
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:02] Abigail, this is a story of Abigail. Now
[1:16:04] we know Abigail was married to um Nibal
[1:16:09] which means a fool right now there's
[1:16:12] certain positions like for example a
[1:16:14] wife will never be responsible for her
[1:16:16] husband's spiritual well-being but the
[1:16:19] husband is the head of the family is
[1:16:21] responsible for the whole family but she
[1:16:23] brother says will never answer for his
[1:16:25] spiritual
[1:16:26] well-being right just like children will
[1:16:28] never answer for their parents'
[1:16:30] spiritual well-being because they're not
[1:16:32] under their headship it's the other way
[1:16:34] So you see now, but the thing is that a
[1:16:37] wife can conduct herself in such a way
[1:16:40] to pull things out of God because of her
[1:16:42] office.
[1:16:44] Amen. Cuz she was she realized, look, my
[1:16:46] my husband is a fool. That's why his
[1:16:48] name is Nibal, right? But you see, she
[1:16:52] knew that David because you know Nibal,
[1:16:54] you know, a fool will receive the
[1:16:56] blessings of God without knowing it. But
[1:16:58] when it but when they when it's revealed
[1:17:00] to them like David sent his men to Naul,
[1:17:02] look, I've been looking after your
[1:17:03] people. I've been actually defending you
[1:17:05] this whole I think sharing season, you
[1:17:08] know. Can we have something to eat? And
[1:17:10] then Naul just says to them, "Get out of
[1:17:12] here. I'm not giving you a free meal.
[1:17:14] Get out of here, buddy." You know, so
[1:17:15] what was he what was he? He It was
[1:17:17] revealed to him why he had a good
[1:17:19] season, but he wasn't willing to thank
[1:17:21] the one who actually gave it to him. And
[1:17:24] then now David got angry. He got
[1:17:27] angry and so he said, "No, we're just
[1:17:29] going to go wipe them all out." But you
[1:17:30] see, Abigail, Abigail realized there's
[1:17:33] mercy in David. In spite of what my
[1:17:36] husband's doing, I'm not even going to
[1:17:37] consider him in this matter. I'm going
[1:17:39] to go with all this food and I'm going
[1:17:41] to stand in the gap.
[1:17:44] Hallelujah. I'm because of who I am as a
[1:17:46] wife, I'm going to stand in the gap.
[1:17:48] Amen. That she and And what did she do?
[1:17:51] She turned the wrath of David away.
[1:17:54] Oh, but I'm just a housewife. I'm just
[1:17:56] this. You got a powerful position. Amen.
[1:17:59] You can stand in the gap for your family
[1:18:01] that even sometimes even husbands can't
[1:18:03] do.
[1:18:06] Amen.
[1:18:08] Praise the Lord. And how many times we,
[1:18:10] you know, we really thought about the
[1:18:11] times when we've gone before the Lord,
[1:18:13] our family's done this, children have
[1:18:15] done this, but you gone and interceded
[1:18:17] on their
[1:18:19] behalf. Amen. You know what's happened.
[1:18:21] You can just think back in your mind,
[1:18:22] parents. Amen. Praise the Lord. There's
[1:18:26] something about our
[1:18:28] position that our family
[1:18:32] matters. Even our extended family.
[1:18:35] Abraham heard that his well, it says
[1:18:36] here we know, you know, was really his
[1:18:39] nephew, but uh Lot was called his
[1:18:42] brother, you know, and and and we know
[1:18:44] Lot was taken captive when there was war
[1:18:46] going on. And Abraham we know became
[1:18:48] Abraham. He armed his servants, not even
[1:18:51] soldiers, and went and got back Lot and
[1:18:54] his goods and the woman and and all the
[1:18:57] people. Because why? Because Abraham
[1:19:00] realized Lot is a part of me.
[1:19:03] Amen. Lot is a part of me. So my faith
[1:19:06] is going to go into action and I'm going
[1:19:08] to go get him back. Amen. That's why you
[1:19:11] got to realize when you talk to your
[1:19:12] family, have a good relationship with
[1:19:15] them. Create an atmosphere. Brother
[1:19:18] says, "How do you apply the token?" You
[1:19:19] create an atmosphere, right? You the
[1:19:22] influence of it comes from you upon them
[1:19:24] and they'll drop right into it.
[1:19:28] So, be friendly. Be loving. Be
[1:19:31] thoughtful. Don't be a grump. Don't be
[1:19:35] some standoffish holier than now. Be
[1:19:37] approachable. Be loving that they
[1:19:39] actually want to build a relationship
[1:19:40] with you. Cuz really in your heart they
[1:19:42] think, "Oh man, uncle or auntie so and
[1:19:44] so really likes me." They just think
[1:19:46] it's like a surface thing, but in your
[1:19:47] heart, you're like, "Lord,
[1:19:49] I'm going after them. Sin has got their
[1:19:52] life. Indifference has got their life."
[1:19:54] You know, something of the world has got
[1:19:56] their life, but Lord, I'm arming by your
[1:19:59] word, and I'm going after them.
[1:20:02] Hallelujah. It appears so simple, but
[1:20:04] yet it's so powerful. You're following
[1:20:05] me, friend. See, that's why it's worth
[1:20:07] it. You say, "Well, they're not friendly
[1:20:09] or they're not this." Hold on. Look
[1:20:12] beyond.
[1:20:13] Look beyond. See, Abraham looked beyond
[1:20:15] the captivity of Lot and said, "No, he's
[1:20:17] part of my inheritance. He's coming
[1:20:19] back." Hallelujah.
[1:20:23] Amen.
[1:20:26] Amen. Ruth would Ruth would be
[1:20:28] instructed by Naomi to go to Boaz at the
[1:20:31] threshing floor. She would, as the Bible
[1:20:33] would say, she laid down at his feet.
[1:20:37] She pulled, see she was actually the
[1:20:40] whole, you could say keystone or the
[1:20:43] important cog in the wheel for Naomi who
[1:20:45] is an Israelite to receive redemption
[1:20:47] and her her her land to be restored back
[1:20:50] to her. She had to go to Boaz who was a
[1:20:53] near kinsman. We all know the story,
[1:20:55] don't we? You see, so her but but so so
[1:20:58] it wasn't Boaz initiating this. It was
[1:21:00] it was Ruth initiating this. See, the
[1:21:02] Bible says, "Draw nigh unto God and I'll
[1:21:04] draw nigh unto you." Right? So she she
[1:21:06] drew nigh unto Boaz who's a type of
[1:21:08] Christ. But where did where did she go
[1:21:10] now? He was asleep. He didn't just whack
[1:21:12] her. She did not whack him on the head.
[1:21:14] Say, "Hey, wake up, boy."
[1:21:16] Her attitude was one of humility. Right?
[1:21:19] She laid down at his feet. Amen. And
[1:21:23] brother says, "You're going to lay down
[1:21:24] where our Lord laid down. He laid down
[1:21:26] at Calvary." Amen. But she laid down at
[1:21:29] his feet, signifying, you are my head.
[1:21:32] Hallelujah. I've come I'm coming in
[1:21:34] humility to to to get what I have need
[1:21:37] of. And friends, if you come in real
[1:21:39] humility to God, something's got to
[1:21:40] happen. When you lay your life down,
[1:21:43] say, Lord, and what happens when you go
[1:21:44] to Calvary, Lord, forgive me of my sins.
[1:21:47] Lord, I've been wrong. Lord, I've been
[1:21:49] indifferent. I've been wewarded. My
[1:21:50] heart's been on something else. Do you
[1:21:52] know we all have a certain amount of
[1:21:53] desire?
[1:21:55] People say, "I just have no hunger for
[1:21:56] God." Well, it's because their hunger's
[1:21:58] on something else.
[1:22:00] That's why it's not because brother says
[1:22:03] every man, woman, and child hungers for
[1:22:05] God. Some people think, well, some
[1:22:07] people have it in them, some people
[1:22:09] don't.
[1:22:10] And not really. Everyone has a hunger
[1:22:13] for God. That's why when we came here,
[1:22:15] the the the Moldi people were worshiping
[1:22:17] something. Brother Aaron says they went
[1:22:19] to North America. The Indians were
[1:22:21] worshiping something because everyone
[1:22:23] has a hunger, right? So, you got to
[1:22:26] realize that people say, "Well, I just
[1:22:28] don't have a hunger for God." It's
[1:22:29] because their hunger's on the wrong
[1:22:30] thing. But create an atmosphere around
[1:22:33] you. Share some testimonies. Not in a
[1:22:35] not in a doineering way. I'm better than
[1:22:37] you. But no, God's real. He saved my
[1:22:40] soul. He changed me.
[1:22:42] Amen. He He did incredible things for
[1:22:45] me.
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. So, she she laid down at his
[1:22:49] feet in humility. And what did she do?
[1:22:52] She pulled redemption out of him. Amen.
[1:22:55] Because after this Boaz began to act,
[1:22:58] went to the went to the um uh what do
[1:23:00] you call it the city gate and you know
[1:23:03] publicly said I'm redeeming you know I'm
[1:23:05] going to marry Ruth to redeem Naomi and
[1:23:07] all these things. So Christ Boaz went
[1:23:09] into action after Ruth laid at his feet
[1:23:13] and asked her request to him.
[1:23:15] Hallelujah.
[1:23:17] She knew her position and because she
[1:23:20] acted in that position she got what she
[1:23:22] needed.
[1:23:24] Amen.
[1:23:26] Praise the Lord. Now, we got to realize
[1:23:29] I'm just going to go back to I'm just
[1:23:30] going to go back to this again. We got
[1:23:32] to realize that we have a there's that
[1:23:34] power. Now, I just wanted to share this
[1:23:36] real briefly. Now, I'm sure well, most
[1:23:38] of us were here, but a few years ago,
[1:23:40] you know, my my niece my niece
[1:23:43] Abigail, she had that that disease that
[1:23:46] that that autoimmune disease was
[1:23:48] attacking her brain. I can't remember
[1:23:49] the terms of it right. Something in me
[1:23:51] said, now it was during co time and
[1:23:53] they're at Starship Hospital and all
[1:23:54] these things, you know, but something in
[1:23:56] me said, "No, that's wrong. I'm going
[1:23:58] after her." He said, "Well, could you
[1:24:01] physically get to her?" "No, but I could
[1:24:03] send her dad, Emerson, quotes and
[1:24:05] scriptures." And I would say, "Lord, I'm
[1:24:07] going after her. She's my niece." Amen.
[1:24:10] And I can't get up there, but her
[1:24:11] parents are believers. And even if they
[1:24:13] weren't, you still encourage them,
[1:24:14] right? But they're believers. Lord, use
[1:24:16] them. Anoint their faith. God, go into
[1:24:18] that hospital room and bring her out of
[1:24:20] that thing. Amen. And the doctor said,
[1:24:23] well, you know, she's going to need
[1:24:24] therapy, going to need all these kind of
[1:24:25] things. They got out of the hospital
[1:24:27] before a lockdown. She's healthy,
[1:24:28] normal, and well, back at school, all
[1:24:29] these things. But should be something to
[1:24:31] say, that's wrong. I'm going after them.
[1:24:35] Hallelujah. I'm sure we all had that
[1:24:37] feeling. But, you know, I thought, no,
[1:24:38] I'm Abraham. She's my like not Lot. Lot
[1:24:41] was Abraham's nephew. Aby's my niece. I
[1:24:44] can go after her the same way. Amen.
[1:24:46] Amen. Bring her home. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:50] Amen.
[1:24:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:56] Now, the important thing is is we
[1:24:59] recognize our position as a
[1:25:03] believer. Right? I'm kind of going back.
[1:25:06] I'll come forward again. We need to
[1:25:07] recognize our position in the scripture
[1:25:09] as a believer. Right? So, if you if you
[1:25:12] want to be abiding in your position,
[1:25:14] find yourself in the Bible. There'll be
[1:25:16] a character that is a believer, not a
[1:25:19] make a believer. That's you and your
[1:25:22] your current situation. And it's not
[1:25:24] something that you just say you are and
[1:25:26] nothing happens. You know it's you and
[1:25:29] God proves it right now. Brother Bram
[1:25:32] would would tell the story of the lady
[1:25:34] in Memphis. Now, she was a real
[1:25:37] mom. She was a real mom. She had a real
[1:25:40] mother's love for her for her son. Now
[1:25:42] we know her son you know so so so she
[1:25:46] she lived in such a way she was a real
[1:25:49] Christian. Now it was the
[1:25:52] faith of her that caused the prophet to
[1:25:55] be grounded in Memphis because of a snow
[1:25:57] uh a storm. Right? So her faith brought
[1:26:01] what she needed on the scene. But she
[1:26:03] was standing in her position as a mom.
[1:26:06] Right? And she knew who she was in the
[1:26:08] scripture. She would say to brother Bram
[1:26:10] after brother Bram walked all the way
[1:26:11] down there from the airport or wherever
[1:26:13] he was, you know, she was um you know,
[1:26:16] she was leaning on her her front gate.
[1:26:19] Brother Bram's walking by and you know,
[1:26:21] she just says to him, "Good morning,
[1:26:22] Parson." And he, you know, he stops and
[1:26:25] says, "How do you know I was a person?"
[1:26:27] And she would explain, you know, did you
[1:26:28] ever read in the Bible about the
[1:26:29] Shinomite woman? How you know you, you
[1:26:32] know, they had the baby by promise. She
[1:26:34] identified herself in the scripture. Now
[1:26:36] she can act according to that position.
[1:26:38] right? This is what we need to do. It's
[1:26:40] very important. And and and brother, I
[1:26:42] said, "Yes, auntie. I um I've read that
[1:26:45] many a time. I preached on it a lot uh
[1:26:47] not long ago." She said, "I's that kind
[1:26:49] of a woman, too. And I told the Lord
[1:26:52] that if you give me a child, I'd raise
[1:26:54] it for him." Said, "Pastor, the Lord,
[1:26:56] give me a boy and I raised him till he
[1:26:58] was in his teens." Said, "He took a a
[1:27:01] road that's wrong. Got out with some bad
[1:27:02] company. He's laying here dying now.
[1:27:04] He's caught a bad disease and the
[1:27:06] doctors can't do nothing for him." said
[1:27:08] they give him all kinds of shots, but
[1:27:10] said he's a backslider and said he's
[1:27:11] laying here dying. Said he's been
[1:27:13] unconscious since the day before
[1:27:14] yesterday and said he don't know
[1:27:16] nothing. He thinks he's out in a deep
[1:27:18] ocean somewhere cold. I said, Parson, it
[1:27:21] just breaks my heart to see my boy die
[1:27:23] like that. Said I want him saved. That's
[1:27:26] a real mother.
[1:27:28] That's a real mother. I think it's a
[1:27:30] real father, but it's a real mother. I
[1:27:32] mean, didn't care about how educated,
[1:27:34] smart, rich, whatever. She just wanted
[1:27:37] to see him on the other side. She knew
[1:27:39] as a believer, she knew where she was
[1:27:41] going. Now, her concern in all of her
[1:27:43] life was, "I want him there. I want the
[1:27:45] family circle unbroken." And no doubt
[1:27:48] she had many hard conversations with him
[1:27:51] growing up. As she begin to see him step
[1:27:53] off the path and begin to see him get in
[1:27:55] among the wrong crowd and see his
[1:27:57] attitude change and see his see the way
[1:27:59] he talked and the lack of respect and
[1:28:01] all these things as he got older. You
[1:28:03] know, there would have been a lot of
[1:28:04] heartache, but it wasn't the end of the
[1:28:06] story. That's right. I mean, it wasn't
[1:28:07] the end of the story. Amen. So, when the
[1:28:10] So, so when we see children go that way,
[1:28:12] it's not the end. Don't quit. Don't give
[1:28:15] up. Don't quit. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] Because she had in her heart, Lord, you
[1:28:20] gave me the child. I want to see him
[1:28:23] saved. Amen. And as the Shunite woman
[1:28:26] got in got in contact with the prophet
[1:28:28] now she's praying, "Lord, I know who I
[1:28:30] am. And you've showed me who I am in the
[1:28:33] scripture, I'm not just claiming this
[1:28:35] out of nothing. I'm I know who I am
[1:28:37] because you've showed me." Now, where's
[1:28:38] the other part of the story that can
[1:28:40] meet the present need of the day?
[1:28:43] Hallelujah. So now, so and then and then
[1:28:45] she's telling this story to Elijah.
[1:28:47] Amen. She doesn't realize it, but God is
[1:28:50] answering her prayer by a little
[1:28:52] preacher walking down the road singing,
[1:28:54] "I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them."
[1:28:56] Amen. But it was her faith. It wasn't
[1:28:57] the prophet's faith. It was her faith
[1:29:00] because she is standing in her position
[1:29:02] brought deliverance and salvation to her
[1:29:04] son.
[1:29:06] Hallelujah. Aren't we the same? Amen.
[1:29:09] Aren't we the same kind of people?
[1:29:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:14] Amen.
[1:29:15] And she said, "Now Lord, if you'll help
[1:29:17] me, don't let my baby die like this. And
[1:29:19] the Lord told me this morning said, "I
[1:29:20] kind of fell asleep here in the chair
[1:29:22] and I dreamed that I was come out of
[1:29:24] here and stand in this gate and I see a
[1:29:25] man coming dressed just like you." And
[1:29:27] then brother says, "Yo, you know," she
[1:29:29] says, "You know," kisses him, says, "Yo,
[1:29:30] my little, you know, you know, mama's
[1:29:33] baby. You know, yes, he was a disgrace,
[1:29:35] all these things, but doesn't matter how
[1:29:37] disgraceful he was, how much trouble he
[1:29:38] got into, he's still mama's baby." I
[1:29:41] mean, that's a mother's love. And if a
[1:29:43] mother if a love of a mother will do
[1:29:45] that, what will the love of God do?
[1:29:47] Amen. So there she was, you know, um you
[1:29:50] know, brother Bram um asked her,
[1:29:51] "Auntie, you know, can you pray? You
[1:29:53] pray first." And brother Ram said, you
[1:29:56] could tell she knew who she was talking
[1:29:59] to. Talking to the Lord. Amen. The
[1:30:02] brother Ram started praying. You know,
[1:30:04] you know, then and then and then the boy
[1:30:05] who was lying there on the bed saying,
[1:30:07] "It's dark said, "It's getting lighter."
[1:30:09] He sat up. He was healthy, strong, and
[1:30:10] normal, and well, not because of the
[1:30:13] prophet's prayer, but because of the
[1:30:15] mother.
[1:30:18] Don't diminish what God's made you. This
[1:30:20] is what I want to get to. Don't Don't
[1:30:22] ever downplay who you are in Christ
[1:30:24] because of who, you know, what God has
[1:30:25] made you to be. Amen. Don't you believe
[1:30:28] God can do the same things for us?
[1:30:31] Amen. Amen. We're here's one
[1:30:36] here. Praise the Lord. Amen. And faith
[1:30:39] was projected cuz why? Cuz parents stood
[1:30:41] in their position. The family circle's
[1:30:44] going to be unbroken. Hallelujah.
[1:30:48] Amen.
[1:30:50] Praise the
[1:30:52] Lord. Amen. You look at Elisha. Elisha
[1:30:55] after he saw Elijah go up in the
[1:30:57] chariot. I'm I'm I'm just going to I'm
[1:30:59] just going to wind up with this thought
[1:31:00] and I actually will. Elisha, you know,
[1:31:03] saw Elijah go up in the chariot.
[1:31:04] Elijah's mantle came down. Elijah
[1:31:06] promised, "You'll receive a double
[1:31:08] portion of the anointing upon me." So
[1:31:10] Eli um Elisha picked up Elijah's mantle,
[1:31:13] went back to the Jordan where they
[1:31:14] crossed not long before cuz remember
[1:31:16] Elijah um took a well Elisha followed
[1:31:19] Elijah. Elijah took his mantle, smoked
[1:31:21] the Jordan, it parted, they walked
[1:31:22] across. Then Elijah went up in the
[1:31:25] chariot. Now Elisha, I believe, came
[1:31:27] back to the same spot. He picks up
[1:31:29] Elijah's mantle. He says, "Now where is
[1:31:31] the God of Elijah?" smites the Jordan.
[1:31:34] And what happened in the prophet's
[1:31:36] ministry was now happening in his
[1:31:37] ministry. Amen. Because he realized that
[1:31:39] God had placed him in a position. Amen.
[1:31:41] Just like he positioned the prophet, he
[1:31:44] positioned him. Amen. And we know Elisha
[1:31:46] types the bride, right? And Elijah
[1:31:50] Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. You say
[1:31:53] the prophet and the bride, whichever
[1:31:55] one. Right. So now here is here is
[1:31:57] Elisha calling out God. You're the same.
[1:32:00] He knew he was placed in the same
[1:32:02] position.
[1:32:03] She says, "Now God, I'm calling you on
[1:32:05] the scene." And he smites the Jordan and
[1:32:07] it parts. Now friends, how many times
[1:32:09] have we stood I remember years ago,
[1:32:11] Sister Shannon in a prayer meeting
[1:32:12] crying out, "Where is the God of
[1:32:13] Elijah?"
[1:32:15] Hallelujah. What you crying out, Lord? I
[1:32:17] want to see salvation come again. I want
[1:32:20] to see people birth. I want to see
[1:32:21] people change, Lord, because you're the
[1:32:23] same God. Remember the keystone of the
[1:32:26] Bible that holds the whole Bible
[1:32:27] together, brother Bram says, is Jesus
[1:32:29] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:32:31] forever. He hasn't changed. Amen. That's
[1:32:33] why we can stand in our position. Say,
[1:32:34] "God, you're God." Amen. So, she cried
[1:32:37] that out. Then, Brother Isaac had his
[1:32:38] experience was changed. God began to
[1:32:40] move in all these things. Can't we be
[1:32:42] the same way? I think it's time,
[1:32:44] friends. I'm just going to finish this.
[1:32:46] And now, this is just me and my heart,
[1:32:48] but we just got to we're to come to a
[1:32:50] place whatever hinders us, That's right.
[1:32:53] it's got to die.
[1:32:56] Amen. Whatever Whatever hinders, is it
[1:32:58] fear? Is it fear of failure? Is it fear
[1:33:01] of what people think of us? Is it is it
[1:33:04] just, you know, just a devil trying to
[1:33:07] intimidate us, thinking you don't really
[1:33:09] have it, you're not really a Christian.
[1:33:12] You know, we got to cut its head off.
[1:33:15] We're standing in a position, friends,
[1:33:17] of power and authority. Jesus Christ has
[1:33:19] placed us that way. So, what are we
[1:33:22] going to do? I think the fear, you're a
[1:33:24] liar. We don't have to put up. If your
[1:33:27] if your home is in a stalemate, you
[1:33:29] don't have to live in that stalemate.
[1:33:31] Amen. You can pray. You can love the
[1:33:33] Lord so much that he can step in and
[1:33:37] take over. Amen. Change the
[1:33:40] conversation. Remember, David dictated
[1:33:43] to Goliath what's going to happen.
[1:33:46] Before David turned up, Goliath was
[1:33:48] dictating to Israel what's going to
[1:33:49] happen. Right? So, what do you do now?
[1:33:51] You got to realize I'm a son or daughter
[1:33:52] of God. If it's all negative in my home,
[1:33:55] I'm going to change the conversation. If
[1:33:57] it's just fussing and fighting, Lord,
[1:33:59] through me, change this whole
[1:34:01] atmosphere. Take dominion, oh God.
[1:34:04] Hallelujah. Why? Cuz I am an adopted son
[1:34:06] or daughter of God. And you'll see
[1:34:09] things begin to change.
[1:34:11] Amen. Like for example, what if I stood
[1:34:13] up here every Sunday just spoke
[1:34:14] negative?
[1:34:16] There's going to become a real
[1:34:17] stalemate.
[1:34:19] Amen. Well, it just becomes tradition,
[1:34:20] just becomes a ritual, just becomes a
[1:34:22] this, you know. But then what if what if
[1:34:24] someone begin to say, "No, this is not
[1:34:27] how church should be.
[1:34:29] Let's pray. Let's have a prayer meeting.
[1:34:31] Let's have a testimony meeting. Let's
[1:34:32] change the whole scene here." Amen. What
[1:34:34] would happen? A Goliath would go down.
[1:34:38] Amen. The kingdom of God would go
[1:34:39] forward. We don't need to kill a Goliath
[1:34:41] in that sense, but let's let the kingdom
[1:34:42] of God go forward.
[1:34:45] Amen. We've been placed in an office.
[1:34:48] Let's use that office because of where
[1:34:50] he's placed us to say, Lord, all power
[1:34:53] in heaven and earth has been given unto
[1:34:54] who?
[1:34:56] Amen. Lord, use it through us. We're not
[1:34:59] here to humanly David didn't humanly
[1:35:01] say, "I'll cut your head off." That was
[1:35:02] God speaking through him.
[1:35:05] Amen. Let's have the musicians, please,
[1:35:07] this morning. Do you know who you are?
[1:35:10] Do you know what God has made you?
[1:35:13] Amen.
[1:35:15] Exercise your God-given authority.
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:24] Amen. We're not hopeless. We're not
[1:35:27] helpless. Nothing is too hard for the
[1:35:34] Lord.
[1:35:37] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:35:44] stand. Amen. Let's sing that. Let's sing
[1:35:46] the Revelation song, shall we, Brother
[1:35:47] Isaac? I think I think it's a good one.
[1:35:50] Amen. You say, well, you say, "What do I
[1:35:51] do then?" You say,
[1:35:53] "Lord, let my faith go into action." Let
[1:35:57] my faith go into action. Lord, may I may
[1:36:01] you through me change the atmosphere in
[1:36:02] my home. May it be full of love and
[1:36:04] faith and encouragement, right? Not
[1:36:07] negative and tearing down all these
[1:36:09] things. Lord, may I take you at your
[1:36:11] word, Lord.
[1:36:21] Okay. Worthy is
[1:36:24] the lamb who was
[1:36:29] slain. Holy, holy is he.
[1:36:38] Sing a new
[1:36:40] song to him who sits
[1:36:45] on heaven's mercy
[1:36:53] seat. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[1:37:00] Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[1:37:10] With all creation, I sing praise to the
[1:37:15] King of
[1:37:17] Kings. You are my
[1:37:20] everything and I will adore
[1:37:29] you.
[1:37:31] Amen. Praise
[1:37:33] God.
[1:37:41] Amen. Clothes and
[1:37:45] rainbows of living
[1:37:48] color, flashes of lightning, rolls of
[1:37:53] thunder.
[1:37:57] Blessing and honor, strength and glory
[1:38:02] empower
[1:38:04] be to you the only
[1:38:08] wise
[1:38:12] me. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[1:38:20] Almighty who was and is and is to come.

[1:38:35] king. You are my
[1:38:39] everything and I will adore
[1:38:45] you. Oh yes, I will adore you.
[1:38:59] Oh, filled with
[1:39:04] wonder, was struck
[1:39:08] wonder at the manion of your
[1:39:15] name. Jesus, your name is power.
[1:39:20] Breath of living
[1:39:23] water. Such a marvelous
[1:39:31] mystery. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[1:39:37] God
[1:39:39] Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[1:39:45] For as you
[1:39:47] are through all creation, I sing praise
[1:39:52] to the king of kings.
[1:39:55] You are my
[1:39:57] everything. But I am holy,
[1:40:03] holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[1:40:10] Almighty. Who was and is and is to

[1:41:16] pray. Amen this morning. Let's pray. who
[1:41:18] wants to say,
[1:41:19] "Lord, may I possess this office you've
[1:41:22] placed me in? May I not shrink back? May
[1:41:24] I not be afraid? May I take you at your
[1:41:26] word, Lord?" Hallelujah. May it just be
[1:41:29] positive in my home faith building.
[1:41:32] Hallelujah. Lord, let's pray. Gracious

[1:41:41] our position Lord how we can come to you
[1:41:44] Lord we can call upon your great name
[1:41:46] Father to pull out what we have need of
[1:41:48] Lord Jesus and Lord it's not us that's
[1:41:51] important it's it's the position you've
[1:41:53] placed us in Lord it's the power of your
[1:41:54] blood lord it's what you have done for
[1:41:56] us so father in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:41:58] I pray that we would we wouldn't just

[1:42:12] great you are. May there be an
[1:42:13] atmosphere of your Holy Ghost around us,
[1:42:15] Lord. May we just yield ourselves to
[1:42:17] you, Lord, that you would take over,
[1:42:19] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[1:42:21] I pray, Lord, whenever the enemy comes
[1:42:24] around us, may it feel very foreign and
[1:42:26] strange. And may we drive them out,
[1:42:28] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. May
[1:42:30] you grant that, Father. Thank you Lord
[1:42:32] that as as your prophet said that even a

[1:42:38] adopted positions in your body. So we
[1:42:41] thank you for that dear God. Help us to
[1:42:43] walk in confidence Lord and Lord knowing
[1:42:45] that you are the same yesterday, today

[1:42:49] into trouble, when things come our way,
[1:42:50] Lord, may you show us in your word who
[1:42:53] we are. Father, like that woman in
[1:42:56] Memphis, she knew you revealed to her
[1:42:57] that she was like the Shunomite woman.
[1:42:59] Father, then you did the rest. Father,

[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:28] He will end
[1:44:30] your steal
[1:44:33] your
[1:44:38] sin. He is a
[1:44:42] liar. He will rob your rest, steal your
[1:44:48] happiness.
[1:44:50] So cast your
[1:44:53] fear in the
[1:44:57] fire because of
[1:45:01] fear. He is a
[1:45:04] [Music]
