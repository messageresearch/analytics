not feeling too tired didn't stay up too late no it's always nice when we have these like 21st or big events CU then on the Sunday morning after that there's always a lot of people at church and we always have a great time you know there the Lord where one or two are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst but if you have three pieces of wood on a fire you get quite a small fire if you have about 50 pieces of wood on there you get a raging Inferno know and and that's and the spiritual works the same when when Brethren come with their lick of fire it actually adds to the atmosphere and that there's a really powerful um atmosphere of the Holy Ghost so that's what we are already in this morning I'm going to say that that we that you know I think the Lord is always looking forward to meeting he doesn't sort of stand back and go oh well let's let's Let It Go on a bit for a bit then we'll go he actually wants to meet with us people his whole all of his effort all of his effort was just so he could come and meet with us the the whole word of God I sometimes it it it blows me away where I think that the the complexity of the Plan of Salvation and how the whole thing has worked out creation and and everything and and God slowly revealing himself and then coming down revealing saying there's going to be a lamb and he comes as the lamb and redeems and all of that the whole purpose was so that we could say Hello Lord I'm here let's can can we fellowship and he says yes I'm here let's Fellowship that's it that's the whole and and we're in that moment right here where we can meet the Living God the the whole purpose of all of his effort is here so let's we're going to have such a good time in the Lord let's sing um This Little Light of Mine I'm going to

perfectly um Sister Kim Micah and Hannah praise the Lord taste taste awesome um blessed Believers um we're sorry we a little bit late um um we just had a real quick practice in the car again um but we

time when the walls of Jero fell at Joshua's feet every time I feel discouraged don't have to wonder where he'll be God's been in time on time every time for me that's [Music] right now this the little David with the thinging in his hand but before the giant so tall and it was unlikely then to all those men surely Goliath would fall and when the three Hebrew Bo put him bow on to Bale the king said they crossed the line when they were thrown into the flame but then the fourth man came in and delivered right on time was in for the children of Israel to cross the mighty Red Sea he was on time

nothing Lord God that is would would offend or upset Lord but we only speak according to your word Lord so have your way and hide man behind the cross of Calvary as we wait upon thee in Jesus name amen and amen amen while you're standing we'll just read a quick scripture if you don't mind amen amen praise the Lord amen a well-known portion of scripture it's found in the book of Jude praise the Lord let's read verse one amen the Bible says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and of brother and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called wow what a salutation amen Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that he should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints amen praise the Lord amen we want to exalt you this morning amen and then 1 Corinthians chapter 9 amen 1 Corinthians chapter 9 amen verse 24 Paul says know he not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth a prize so run that he may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible listen to Paul you now I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that Beth in the air amen but I keep under my body and bring it and bring it bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a Cast Away amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated in his presence amen praise the Lord I I want to greet you all this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and amen special greeting to brother Ben and Sister Christine God bless you amen actually I should say Pastor Ben amen so greetings Pastor Benjamin amen and Sister Christine and uh all the Believers this morning and uh and the only reason I'm preaching and my father's not preaching because he wasn't going to come right and so when brother Ben asked me and I said yes then afterwards I heard he's coming also so I don't know if they planned it that way and I always said I am I'm a great support for my my dad and when you ask him favors he says no so I said why don't you preach and he just said no brother and just straight out no so amen and that's I thought i' just let you know that's the only reason I'm preaching and not him amen and I think you didn't plan it like that he you're a very upright man right amen amen and uh you know one minute they weren going and the next minute I heard they coming and so Dad says that brother poor you called him twice and he said he couldn't say no amen so I I don't know I don't know but praise the Lord so that's why I'm here this morning amen but we trust we just want to be a blessing and um and the reason I've got I just let you know the reason I've got this thing I am I don't like I I deal with technology on a daily basis right but I'm of the old school and I come to the pulpit I don't like technology I've got to use this amen they're trying to convince me to use that thing and this thing and I can't use that amen I amen they say you can't teach a old dog new tricks amen so uh praise the Lord I I use this amen and uh and the only reason I got this is because I found out you know you come to I don't I didn't have a printer to print the quote so I had to put it on here amen and then Dad said yesterday I've got to you know come up to the play and you know preach on an iPad and uh I I I can't do I still write my stuff out right I still I'm Antiquated I tell you amen but uh God bless you this morning greetings in jesus' name it's really good to Amen to be here this morning and uh thank you for the opportunity to be part of yesterday brother Po and the family amen it was a privilege yesterday to be part of it amen and then uh to be here this morning amen I'm grateful for that amen and uh I was just thinking this morning it's I think it was um and uh I'm I'm going to say this and I'm going to get it also but I I think it was L and tazwell that was instrumental in introducing us I think it was e am I right or was it you I don't know who it was but uh I I'll get a text message from Taz I'm sure I'll get a text message but I they were in instrumentally introducing us amen and um and I always yeah so and I'm glad they did amen and so it's good to have friends and it's good to be together amen I consider you all friends this morning and uh amen so God bless you greetings in Jesus name and uh to all the helps and governments and the officers and all the Believers God bless you this morning amen greetings amen and uh you know I'm just trying to settle down right you know that right you know that all right and um I just wanted to say that you know uh I I don't I don't really care about people's opinions but I should he I should I really should when no when people have an opinion of me I don't really care right if it's negative or good whatever and but I thought I just wanted to say uh I hope nobody was offended when they ended up calling me Bishop right and I just wanted I just wanted to say it's not an office it's a term of endearment all right I thought I wanted to say that you know it's a so brother brother and PO is from Africa and males find it hard to say I love you or to say brother you're awesome or brother you're great so they give you this little this this title of that doesn't mean anything really so it's just brother PA and brother brother Ben said it yesterday and Andy said it was just their terms of endearment you know just saying how much they they like me amen so I just thought I'd say that all right so please amen don't don't go tell everybody brother F's got a title eh don't please don't please don't right it's a term of endearment and then I discovered I looked into it and apparently you know they they they they the term Bishop is synonymous with an elder and overseer and then I was you know I was thinking brother Paul laying in bed I think are they trying to tell me that I'm older than them and they so yeah so I thought I'd just let you know okay okay I'm not any of that I'm I it's just the term he so when he says it he's just trying to say brother fedy I I love you okay so so pray that he can say those words brother fedy I love you okay so praise the Lord amen but really enjoyed yesterday uh I really enjoyed it I enjoyed amen the fellowship and the the food amen and uh I I never really ate yesterday but amen so I think it's insane right you you've got all that food and then you don't eat and at the end of the night you've got to go to McDonald's did we go to mcdonal was it McDonald's e so I had to get me dinner at McDonald's last night as just I I I I'm so stressed out for what was happening yesterday and trying to keep the time and you're looking at this program and you got the time and and I got pressure from Brother Po and I and I get the looks from sister sepy and it's like oh God help me God help me here you know and I'm watching the clock and uh you know so brother Isaac is pressure right you know a little bit about that amen it's pressure amen it's I I can deal with brother with a brother right but when a sister's got you in know under sight oh man oh man it's scary he it's scary so and so after all that food yesterday I go to McDonald's for a meal can you believe it but that's fine that's fine you know but I enjoyed we enjoyed yesterday enjoyed the food was awesome Fellowship was awesome amen and thank you for yesterday amen so we we just want to today be try to encourage you along the way uh we fighting a terrible devil and uh I'll monitor the time there amen and uh you know I always tell Brother Andy I said we you know it's a message of the hour amen and uh I always tell Andy do that don't worry brother I I got on my iPad he took the clock off at the back I said don't worry I got on my iPad and I always tell brother brother Andy but when we talk I always say Brother Andy remember it's a message of the hour so I've got to I've got to stick to that right stick to that so um just to encourage you along the way you know and just to you know be be in encouragement and I think that's what we need we just just encourage me you know uh I'm fighting a I'm fighting a battle right so encourage me you know tell me you got my back that's what I want to hear you know what I mean and uh tell me that you care you know and when I'm when I'm going through a valley you you've got discernment to know that I'm in a valley and you can come and you can just you know and and don't don't even say anything sometimes just be there yeah am I right I believe that's the season we're in you know it's it's a phone call it's a WhatsApp it's a it's a it's a visit you know and because we're all busy with life you know uh I think it's a time where we we we we we we've got the Holy Ghost discernment right and it's not just the pastor's job to do that no and it's not just the prince of deacons job to do that you know it's our responsibility you know and and some and we need that because I know we in a battle and I know like Jude said we contending I'm not here to tell you to contend I know you're contending I know you're in the battle I know you're fighting I know the battle gets hard and it's okay now and then to you know feel a bit like oh man I'm a little bit punch drunk here you know and I'm a little bit I need a I I need some I need some support or I you know or I need the my corner to give me a little drink of water you know and I thank God for a good corner you know you know you got a good corner you know where you're in the ring and the the devil gives you a left and the right and you I I love how the how the the referee asks the the fighter what what day is it have you you seen that what day is it you know and sometimes you don't know what day it is and uh you know but then they get they got a little stool and they sit you down and they you know they fan the towel not sure what that does and a little drink of water and it's good to have a good ring corner and I thank God Amen back home we've got a good corner and really that's all I do at church I'm just there to support the pastor amen I'm in the corner and when he comes on a Sunday and he's punching drunk a little bit and he's fought a good fight and I put the chair down and we you know and we fan the towel and we give him a drink of water and uh we there to support Hallelujah and and we're there to support the Believers amen we support each other amen and I know you're fighting this fight and listen this fight is rough and and and look you I I I there's nothing I can tell you that's new you know everything but I just want to tell you yeah the fight is rough and it's okay to say brother I'm having a hard time Believers don't want to do that how are you good how are you okay and I understand they say don't don't uh uh magnify the negative I know that too right but it's sometimes good to say okay you know brother I've got a problem I'm struggling pray for me you know support me be there for me and that is what it's all about I don't personally I believe holding a mic and standing behind the pulpit that's the smallest part of my Ministry that's what I this is f right the biggest part of my Ministry is being there for people it's all about people and it's and and and and we do it you do it from Your Heart Right you've got a heart for the people and so this fight as Jude said he says we earnestly contending for the faith right and uh I I I I went and I I don't do this and I sort of thought I'd do it I going to go look at the word contend in the Greek word and this is what the scholars WR but I don't do this I'm I'm I'm uh I'm very simple person humble person you I don't I'm not educated but I can't even say the word but I looked at the Greek word for contend and it's I'll just spell it e p a g o n i z o m a i I don't know what it is right that's the Greek word for contend and it says contend it it means to contend about a thing as a combat patent listen so we're not on a picnic I I want to just remind you you're not you're not sitting in the park somewhere amen with your picnic blanket and your picnic lunch and you're looking into the eyes of your loved one you know and there little hearts and little arrows and uh you it's not always that no you you you you a combatant Hallelujah you know you a you a soldier on and I want to encourage you this morning so come on soldiers you you you're not in the kitchen uh uh uh uh um peeling potatoes right you a combatant and and this battle is intensive well maybe yeah some of you know what I'm talking about right and and and I I I picture the soldier right I picture this special elitist Force and when they go to army they put the stuff on their faces and they got bandana on their heads and they you know they and you look at them and you can see man they they it's been rough all right and I and I went further and and apparently this word content comes from the English word earnest comes from the English word to agonize and Agony he says and the they say this is the effort we should expend as we undertake the counter attack and I read that and I thought man that's it you see we as Believers we we we we we sometimes we too passive man you know we we we we sit back and we and we let the enemy attack us sometimes I think we should go on the attack now I want to ask you sitting back and saying this is my lot where has it gotten us yeah amen where has it gotten us brother I'm just humble and I'm just the devil punching bag while you could be I ain't the English guy says it's about a counter attack and it's about identifying where the biggest issues are yes sir and then going on the attack we're not going to build up our defenses we're not going to build up the walls yes we have the walls but we're not going to build up and hide behind it you know what I mean and Dodge the enemy and hide from the enemy I believe it's time we as Believers we go on the Counterattack so this morning God is looking for believers now yes we have problems and I will never uh uh disrespect what you're going through I will never turn around and tell you toughen up yes I will but I know we go through problems and I know there are things that happen and I know there are situations but really Believers it's time we deal with these things it's time we put our shoulders back amen I know say you say things like that it scares the life out of people right and it's associated with vigorous combat this earnestly contending it's not just taking a stroll in the park and you know holding your husband or your wife's hand and look that's good too amen looking in each other's eyes and uh you know the young brothers are praying for wives and the youngers are saying Lord let me be the one and it's not just that you know it's time you you you you you you you g your loins it's time you pick up your Shield it's time you say I'm in a battle and I'm fighting Paul says a good fight brother I don't know how Paul could call it a good fight amen Paul said it's a good fight he said I kept the faith I never walked away from the faith and I believe that is our testimony Heen we fighting a good fight and we are not fighting our brother we are not fighting our sister I said the other day a lot of times we get wounded by friendly fire but that's all right that's all right that brother just needs help with his aim amen that's it amen amen amen but we're fighting a good fight and we fighting a common enemy and we are contending this morning and so I want to say this morning let's not what's the opposite you go on the offensive and the defensive amen and you sit back and you wait for the devil to come your way and you wait for the problem to come your way and oh yeah I'm just going to have these problems again I'm going to have these battles again and you know instead of taking the fight to the devil instead of taking the fight to the devil now brother Brandon makes a statement and I if I can find my quotes he said and I've got some there and some here and whatever amen I will see how we go now brother brandom says amen hallelujah and no wor I'm going to say nothing new I'm going to say nothing strange amen I'm just going to remind you what you already know amen and brother B says the possessing all things he says the believer yet we addir to All Things We addir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises but this is the where we come yet you have to fight every inch of it oh he says and just listen to his words that's the way God's got it set up so I might as well let you know amen if you feel it's going to get easier it ain't going to get easier brother brandom said that is how God has it set up he makes the promise but he says you're not going to get it easy he goes on it's always amen you have to fight to possess what you know is your own hey he says you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what we have to do now amen I don't know what you fighting over I don't know what you striving for but I want to let you know you're going to have to fight for it Church of the loving God you're going to have to take a stand for it amen if it's healing you're going to have to stand and say God said he's a Healer now I didn't say he's a Healer he said he's a Healer and if he's a Healer he's got to stand behind his word and God all that God wants is for a Believer to stand up and take a stand and say that God is a Believer sorry A Healer that's what he needs your children are Wayward did he make a promise so find the promise then you take the promise and you stand with the promise and you say God you said it am I right he's God a liar he ain't a liar so what are we afraid of let's take the word of God and let's stand there God you said it that's my encouragement this morning I didn't say it God said it God said it and what am I going to worry then will it happen won't it happen will it happen not my problem it's God's problem he's got to vindicate his word he made a promise it's his job to fulfill that promise amen what did Brother brandham tell John Ryan John Ryan said brother brandham you said I'm Healed brother Brandon said John Ryan you said you believe and that's the question this morning do you believe I want to ask the church do you believe so if you believe why don't you just stand stand there why don't you just put your shoulders back amen you say brother FY now what do I do you rejoice on the promise has the promise been given has the promise been given can God lie does God stand on his word so what's my problem I don't have a problem I just have to stand there and keep smiling on the promise hallu what what's your problem what's your issue you think you got to fulfill it do you think you got to make it come to pass no you just stand there you stand there because you know why you plant it you plant it you haven't been stuck in you plant it and you know when you plant you dig a hole you put fertilizer in listen we staying on a 16 acre block and I realized I don't know what to do I'm out of my depth and I hear all of them saying do this do that do that and I've got I've I've confessed I don't know what to do I realize I belong in the city but I'm willing to learn but we as a church we've been planted you haven't been stuck in because once you plant a tree there are roots that go down and David said amen blessed is the man listen that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly in other words stay in the word stay in the church stay in Fellowship that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly but standeth oh but sth and he shall be like a tree I don't know if there's any trees here I don't know if there's any trees here are you planted are you planted and plant Ed By the Waters that bringeth forth his fruit you bringing forth fruit you know every time you raise your hand that's fruit every time you say amen that's fruit amen you know what Jesus does with a tree that doesn't bring forth fruit he says hey let's cut it off oh so every time you raise your hand that's fruit that's fruit of Joy that's fruit of pray is you thought you thought it was a South African thing no it's you giving God glory because you planted by the river of waters amen and your leaves you what Paul's the Bible says your leaves shall not wither you'll never lose your praise you'll never lose your worship You'll Never Lose Your Glory why brother you planted oh hallelujah it's good to be planted it's good brother I'm not a stick stuck in mud why do you think you're still here why do you think listen listen listen what was this year like for you easy was hard but you're still here so if you're questioning whether you planted ask yourself why you still here yeah you've had so many problems am I right or you never had had or never had let's try that again you had many problems we won't glorify that are you still here are you still standing that means you planted so don't let the devil tell you you not plant it don't let the devil Say You're Just a stick in the mud you are planted and you bringing forth your fruit oh Hallelujah sometimes the fruit of worship comes out loud in the shower sometimes the fruit of worship comes out loud in the car but it never really comes out much in church but that's okay it still comes out and every time you say Amen to the word that's your fruit every time you say Amen to the word raise your hand every time you dance every every time you smile that's your fruit because we plant it amen so I don't have to worry oh is it going to come to pause is it all mine no no no I just stand there I just stand there amen amen like the Rock of Ages I just stand there say brother you yeah yeah because I've got a god in me I've got a God that keeps me I've got a God that kept me thus far I never kept me I never held onto me there's a song We says something keeps holding me you should not be here today but you're here it's got to be something it's got to be something on the inside so my so stop understanding what God has done for you stop Church walking around like God did nothing for you you wouldn't be here if God didn't do something for you you would have walked away like the rest of the crowd but you still here hey you still here don't compare life with others you still yeah amen you like that tree amen and the good thing about that tree as that tree gets bended by pressure take the pressure off tree comes up I sound like a farmer Marcus right praise the Lord and I don't know what I'm talking about naturally amen but amen that's what I'm saying because why we planted and I just love that I'm encouraged this morning we are planted sisters and brothers you are planted amen and if our children not planted amen we make the whole not naturally spiritually you prepare the ground you plant that Tree Bible says you rear the child in the fear of the Lord and it shall not depart from them it may look like it's departed but it hasn't departed in due season in due season I want to encourage you Believers this morning I don't know what you're going through I'm off there and the notes doesn't matter but in due season God will visit your neighborhood you you've been standing you've been standing you've been like a tree it's been problem on problem on problem but you are still standing what keeps you standing don't know I'm planted church we are planted this morning so be encouraged brother Maran you are planted when you go hunt those poor animals you are planted brother Maran amen when you aim for that poor little animal you are planted brother Marian amen and church whatever you do when you lay the carpet brother man when you wash the carpets you are planted amen amen you a builder amen he builds the houses as God builds inside of him he are planted amen amen hallah be encourages morning amen you know what I actually feel like closing say let's go home H to know this morning church amen yes we got problems yes we hey we got problems huh we got problems man we got oh my but I'm not here to glorify problems I'm here to glorify the God we serve so parents take courage amen I I I was I enjoy looking at those boys last night the enthusiasm their Joy the young sister they enjoy the little girls that were dancing there with py them yesterday the enthusiasm amen we say God don't take it away amen why is it when they get older they seem to lose it we will not allow amen when I listen to Hannah and Micah sing yesterday I said we're not going to let the devil take that we are not going to let him take our joy he's not going to take our peace he's not going to take our love he's not going to take my joy we will not allow him amen Lord so brother R says you have to fight to possess what you know is your own I love that slogan you have to fight to possess what you know is your own what a battle what a battle combatants soldiers Warriors oh my I was going to oh my God Amen wow what a battle amen and to be fighting it huh I I got a lot to say but I'm just sort of saying Lord where do you want me to go with this Amen brother bandam said as we fight this battle that's the believer today got to fight to possess what you know is your own do you know it's yours I can't tell you it's yours you have to realize it's yours you have to look at this Bible and say every promise and the book is mine every chapter every verse every line as it go I am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine now I can't sing that for you you got to sing it for yourself you've got to get a revelation that God you gave me a promise I can't get that for you and that is really what the ministry is trying to achieve it's for you as an individual to say wow he is a Healer amen I can't get that for you you as an individual to say wow he does answer prayer wow he does meet needs you see I can get that for you and really that's what brother Ben is trying to achieve he's really trying to get you to get to a place to realize that's actually my promise you see the god that created what we what we walking on the earth he created it with a spoken word that was his building tools he never had the tools that Ben uses to build a house he just St stood there and brother BR says he stood on an invisible platform and he just just spoke and he said let there be now I don't care what the agnostics and the atheists and the unbelievers say about creation I'm simple enough to know he spoke it now the same God that said let there be all right it's he's the same God that said by his stripes you are healed huah yes sir am I right he's the same God that said I'll meet every need he said you are the head and not the tail he said I'll bless you going out and coming in he said I'll be your portion you got all the promises but these promises Believers won't mean anything to you as an individual Until you realize oh my word that's for me and then you take what he said is for you and you apply it to your life and he said that your family is like a quiv of arrows right so if some of the arrows has gotten a mind of its own and God W gone wondering a little bit the Bible says your qu will be full so they may Wonder but they can't stay but I can't get that Revelation for you nobody can get that Revelation for you you have to get it who gave Abraham his Revelation yes 25 years man oh brother Noah to any man anybody here been 100 Years yet none of you what gave Abraham the gumption man huh and sister SAR in his church one of the founding members in his church didn't want to believe am all right you know the Bible did that move Pastor Abraham when the church never said amen when he preached never moved Pastor Abraham uhuh Pastor Abraham said or Pastor Ben said pastor Abraham said God said am I right he never said I said or you said he said God said now God put that in the Bible yes it's history he put it there because he knew there'd be someone come along with a similar circumstance and with that similar Circ circumstance that someone will be able to take what Abraham said and done and said If Abraham can I can and Sister Sarah being the fleshly the way she was she misguided the pastor a little bit but the church is church right but it never wavered Pastor Abraham he stood there now here's my question did the Deon convince Pastor Abraham did the elders convince Pastor Abraham or did God give Pastor Abraham a revelation and that's the key he had a revelation amen that God told him one day Abraham look up and Abraham looked up that's your seed can you count it no Abraham look at the sand can you count it no that's your seed and Abraham got a revelation and the Bible me picks it up in Romans and said Abraham grew stronger in Praise amen so Abraham with a revelation not a son not of manifestation with a revelation of the word want you listen to me Believers a revelation of the word sustained Abraham for 25 years wasn't Isaac no no no wasn't Hager it wasn't Sarah it was a revelation of what God had promised sustained him for 25 years amen 25 years later year was little Isaac but for 25 years he held on to a promise you know what I'm saying yeah huh I know what I'm saying huh find a promise then say God reveal that promise to me now with your revelation of the promise you'll be standing huh amen you'll be coming to church every Sunday and you'll be get stronger and so as Abram got weaker physically spiritually he got stronger every time he looked in the mirror and he saw another gray hair he got stronger yeah yeah every time he looked in the mirror he saw another wrinkle he got stronger every time he looked at Mama Sarah and Mama Sarah was older he got stronger and even when Sarah doubted you know what I love Bible says you know what the Bible says the Bible says Sarah laughed and the Bible says Abraham laughed right but when you go to the book of Hebrews and you try and find out when they write about the memo he's going to me anky right he's going to give me a cloth but he says I'm not wiping my face I better do it e i just sorry brother I just sometimes get so caught up and I I couldn't be bothered wiping sorry I apologize right it must be unpleasant I apologize if it looked unappealing to the eye looking at the sweaty Bal man sorry I apologize we might as well go home huh what's the song they used to teach us when we were younger fishing for Jesus we'll change it brother sweating for Jesus am all right and this is what I love but when Abraham's memo were written in Hebrews 11 nothing was said about Abraham laughing nothing was said about Abraham listening to to his wife's fleshly fleshly commands nothing was said and nothing was said about Sarah laughing nothing so you've got to decide what you want to believe right and Abraham I tell you Abraham I tell you God just thinking I don't know about what but and so yeah Abraham meets this King right you know the story right he meets this King I just want to show how God works and he goes to the king with a 90-year-old wife H and the King Falls for a 90-year-old wife hey and something must have happen to this woman but man he had the most beautiful ladies at his be and call and he falls for this woman here that's 90 years old something must have happened but the point I'm trying to make so Abraham tell tell Sarah this is that God's vessel with a revelation you know this guy that was known as the friend of God I I'm trying to show you stop underselling what God what how God sees you and I show you how God sees you so this man God's friend tells his wife tell them you're my sister and the King falls in love with a 90 listen a 90y old woman man 90 don't don't don't be all spiritual 90 don't don't be don't don't spiritualize this now she's a 90y old woman and he's a 100y old man right go and Google what 90 looks like look somebody like me was probably right and I'm not even there yet but the point I'm trying to make this morning is and so the king likes her and God comes to the king and says hey you better give this man's wife back but the king said but God he told me and God said that's why I'm giving you a chance no he's God's friend he has a revelation he's God's Prophet but he's a liar right God turns around to him and God tells the King you better give that man's wife back he's my Prophet hang on hang on right there stop the bus but I thought he lied I I'm trying to show you just because you failed doesn't change God's mind about you just because you wouldn't being a little bit fruitful with your worship didn't change God's mind and here is the point here here's the cliner not only does God say you better give his woman back his wife back he's my prophet and you better let this guy pray for you this liar you want me to get this liar to pray for me you better get him to pray for you because he's my Prophet so his behavior didn't change the calling you hear me so just because you have have a problem it doesn't change that God has called you to be a soldier contending for this Faith that's been restored by William brandham the liar sorry to call him a liar but that's what he was the lying brother had to pray for him for the king and he was still God's Prophet so being en encourage this morning church huh God did the same with job God tells job's bodes if you want me to forgive you you better let joob pray for you the brother on the asep the brother on the asep scratching his boils the brother was told by his wife man Curse God and die thank God job had a revelation you speak like her now brothers that doesn't give us license to tell our wiv is that right God said you get that man to pray for you and I want to let you know this morning the calling on your life is precious and just because you made a mistake doesn't change the calling just because go then God made a mistake then God made a mistake when he predestinated you if you feel I'm not worthy of this calling if you feel this morning I think I've gone too far then you saying predestination was wrong wrong but I want to let you know this morning predestination is not wrong now you see because what God I was saying the other day the Bible says he is the author and the finisher the Bible says nothing but the in between right we don't know what happens in between and if we knew brother we'd Run for Our Lives I don't want to know about the in between but what I do know he's the same God that started it he'll be the same God that finishes it he said I'm the author and I'm the finisher yes there may be some mountains yeah there may be some fire amen what does the song say he didn't promise that the cross would not get heavy and the hills been hard to climb he never Pro offered a victory without I without F but he said help will always come in time so just remember when you standing in the valley of decision and the adver says what give in just hold on I want to encourage you this morning thank you just hold on our Lord will show up I love that part you know all of a sudden you alone in the fire and God just shows up can you testify of that amen you in the Lion's Den on your own and all of a sudden God just shows up when you feel you're going through a trial on your own and all of a sudden I just love this about God brother I just love this about God can you picture it in your mind God just shows up you feel you alone and all of a sudden he's just there that's the kind of God I serve amen so I want to say just hold on our God will show up and he'll take you through the fire again amen amen what's the verse give me the verse please brother somebody amen the verse amen oh my what's the verse amen oh my that's not the verse but okay but praise the Lord you know the verse amen he will show up he never help nowadays e oh man but anyway praise the Lord I think we can just go home I want to encourage you church now just to pick up the faith quickly because this is what we're fighting for now we're not starting to contend we have been contending right we have been right I don't know how long but we have been and the fight has been 2023 let's just say it's been interesting that's right it's been interesting right has it been interesting but because you've been contending you've been contending for a faith that's been restored by Brother brandom Jude said the faith was delivered once Malachi came forame and restored it he went to fetch that faith that was lost through the Dark Ages and he brought it back into this day and he said I'm restoring that faith and brother brandham has gone of the sin so I say the faith not a faith not a faith that we are saved by grace through faith now that faith and this faith is not two separate faiths it's the same Faith but this one here is a matured faith that one year is a faith that just starts you on your journey but this Faith here is a restored faith that you've been fighting for now when Jude told them that they needed to be restored to contend for a faith that was delivered I went back and I asked into brother bram's message and I asked myself what happened on the day of Pentecost and brother brand makes a statement and he says those Apostles their bodies were quickened very strong word quickened he doesn't say their bodies were changed because if their bodies were changed there would have been a Rapture but their bodies were quickened they were quickened by the Holy Ghost their bodies and Jude is trying to tell the people hey you got to go back to that a quickening of a body but brother brandham comes comes along and he says no no no we're not just going back to a body being quickened we going back to a body being changed so if I can say this we are contending for what Jude said plus more so you are on a journey this morning not to get the faith restored it's already been restored you are just contending for that Faith to operate in your life because brother brother Brandon said Jesus introduced the faith I'm not going to read the quotes and he says you got to look at the life of Jesus the signs the Wonders the Miracles and he came and I say he introduced the faith in three phases or stages amen the first one was your brother Brandon had three pools also and the first one was healing right Jesus healed right healed the second stage he discerned the spirit woman at a well right and he said yeah your husband the fif six husband but then the third stage he now broke the word and he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you've got no part of me he started opening the word and then they walked away the 70 was it the 70 something like that and then Jesus said do you also want to go thank God for Peter hey thank God for Peter this impulsive brother Peter thank God Peter said Lord where where am I going to go where am I going to go and that's how we feel this morning where are we going to go if we walk away from this message where are we going to go are you going to go back to John 3:16 church for God so loved the world we love that but you see that was the start of our journey but we don't stick around the mountain of John 3:16 and I thank God for a prophet imagine we never had a prophet we'll still be preaching this morning for God so loved the world we go beyond that and so Jesus introduced the faith in his life and that Faith culminated on the day of Pentecost and you know what happened on the day of Pentecost right you know right something happened there there was 120 devout Jews walked into the upper room they couldn't handle one another read the Bible they had battles with positions they had drama with personalities some one of their mothers even came and said Jesus put my one son on the left and my one son on the right thank God for zala's mothers they were cowards brother brandham said when Jesus died his church almost broke up did you know that he had been walking and preaching to them for three and a half years yeah he dies and the church almost breaks up and the head Deacon decides I'm leaving the church Peter Peter said I go fishing am I right I'm just quoting scripture and the other Bru in the church said hey Pete we go too Jesus is church almost broke up because Jesus wasn't around you know why because it was just word and so Jesus comes out of the Grave he leaves the people that he pulled out of paradise to go and do some sightseeing and he says I got to go check this church of mine because Sunday morning brother Thomas is not even in church this is at the resurrection first service should have been there Thomas said I ain't going to church scripture unless so Thomas is not in church if Jesus if Jesus hadn't arose now listen now you thinking you thinking your situation is so bad right my situation is so bad brother you wouldn't known my situation put yourself in Peter shoes huh he cut off malus's malus's ear right he swore I didn't know Jesus he says I'm going fishing he influences half the church to go fishing with him he is just one backsliding brother he is totally backsliding and he's fishing on the shore fishing and uh yeah I don't want I won't say the state he was in but it was fishing Jesus arose right and thank God now sisters be be calm sisters the sisters at the tomb sisters calm down sisters calm down the sisters at the tomb are there to anoint the body thank God for our sisters e our sisters that just know how to say amen and worship God and amen make God God if Jesus tells the disciples he says hey it says go tell my disciples I'll meet them but he says go tell my disciples and and Peter now I sometimes tell myself I never denied God I may have cut off the ear I may have done things I shouldn't have I may I console myself with that I never denied God and here Peter denies Jesus right and Jesus says tell Peter I'm tell Peter all right so the story goes fast forward now in the upper room the faith is about to be delivered they in the upper room yeah and God puts them in a room 120 he locks them upstairs in a room that they were behind closed doors because they were scared of the Pharisees and I don't know whether they used perfume back then I don't know whether they washed their feet back then because remember they walked so you have 120 people locked in a room we don't know what the size of the room is and God leaves them there for 10 days days can you imagine the personalities can you imagine oh my Lord the issues and he keeps him there for 10 days he's getting his church sorted 10 days later or was it 50 days so it's 40 days and Jesus ascends and then on the 50th day the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come something happened the faith was delivered am something happened because the Bible brother Brandon said they came out of there they were no longer cowards I want to let you know this morning the Holy Ghost is a definite experience that brings a change in a person's life you cannot meet God in a burning bush experience and be the same you cannot that's so I say what we need is to make sure our kids get the Holy Ghost and here they come out 120 right come up the upper room Holy Ghost all over them licks of fire resting on on them right and we need a spokesman and we definitely not going to use Peter because Thomas may be said I only never came to church I didn't lie I didn't swear I didn't cut the ear I didn't curse I should be the spokesman am all right Matthew said no I should be the spokesman man holy ghost anoints Peter as a spokesman didn't change Peter's calling your mistakes doesn't change your calling your failures doesn't change your predestination what you did listen stop saying God you made a mistake when you called me God doesn't make mistakes it's 120 right something happened however their bodies were quickened and now brother randam says and this maybe you don't like this part he said if the church a now the church was planted then right he says now he says if the church age started with fire just brother random he says over down on the other side it's going to end with fire so if the faith was delivered with fire somewhere along the line in the restoration process there's got to be fire and people are scared of the fire people are scared of this Holy Ghost Fire that's burning in my soul it feels just like fire don't you sing a song like that it's just like that's what it say it's just like fire shut up in my bones do you know what you're singing it feels like fire there Holy Ghost Fire when Peter came out of the upper room with his fire look otherwise you got to stop singing the song otherwi brother Isaac they'll have to stop singing the song Because if this fire is shut up in your bones oh church I'm telling you because when that fire struck Peter's Jewish bones he came from that upper room and they thought he had been to the bottle store they thought he had drunk a liter of Jack Daniels they didn't know this was fire shut up in his bones and that is what we need church we don't need more Doctrine we don't need more revelation we need a manifestation of the song that was on the screen fire shut up in my bones people are scared of the fire people are scared that the fire may make you do things you don't want to do yes it will the fire will make you shout have you seen what brother Marcus does when the Holy Ghost gets a hold of him man something happens man and when the Fire gets in your bones you can't turn it off that's right you can't turn it off Hallelujah so we praying for all of you to get the fire that doesn't have it oh brother Ben I tell you brother Ben and when it gets a hold of you young sisters you don't care whether the hair is like that or the hair is like that and you I don't care we don't have hair right doesn't bother me but I tell you when that fire gets in your bones I don't want to I don't want to talk color and nationality and all all that but we want to see a fair skinned person run let that fire get in their bones it will do it to the fair skin and the dark skin and the yellow skin and listen there's no skin in God's God's economy there's no Jew no Gentile or whatever we are one in Christ we are all believers in Christ man there fire shut up in our bones amen do you have it do you have it shut up in your bones hey man it quickens you on a Monday morning hall or maybe it doesn't maybe some of you quickens you man have you ever walked into church on a Wednesday night and you feel man I had such a hard day brother oh my brother Phillip I had a hard day and you come in and they start singing feels like fire and it's like you're getting a car cranked up man by the time that song gets halfway man brother am I right brother man just something inside of you amen that's what fire does I tell you church amen amen oh my 1983 when the fire hit my bones yeah I am how many years later I can't even count trust used to say okay 40 years later I still can't shut it down dad 60 years brother Ben how many years 15 you can't shut it down

amen you may snot and man and all that stuff sorry I shouldn't say that but the Holy Ghost when it hits you man hallelujah oh Hallelujah it does something on the inside my Lord it does something man I tell you you get up from there you love everybody you love everybody you care about everybody amen when the Devil comes with trials yeah he trips you up now and then but there just something that picks you up you know what I'm talking about something that picks you up so I haven't lost my thought I'm watching my clock amen so Peter faith is restored delivered 33 years later they lose it now they never lost it it was just that the original Apostles they died out and that's the scary part is that second generation that third generation or the fourth generation that's the scary part because you see my dad and has has I mean you know he's he's had a period right and now I come along right as a Son of God but it's that generation after that's the scary part because if they don't meet God like Dad did and like I did and like brother Ben did and like brother Isaac did we're going to have problems going forward we're going to have problems going forward I looked at the young men yes the young boy sitting I look at them I said if God doesn't meet them we're in trouble brother Ben we are in trouble if God doesn't meet our children we are in trouble but that's not that that's it's not all that gloom and doom God said I'll meet them because God said that's my promise so our children are our heritage so they may wonder they can't stray they coming back they coming back so if anybody here has got children that are away with be at rest they coming back amen you may look at them and they may be painted up and short dress and hair cut and all my parting in the world and don't worry it's easy for 30 to say right I can hear you also say yeah brother for it's easy for you to say Amen you don't have those problems that I have and you don't amen I understand but let me encourage you they going to come because predestination is strong I tell you that sometimes we just as parents we need to be a little bit hard and make a hard decision that will reap good benefits but that is between you and God right but I want to encourage you they're coming you know it's like God will start reeling them in and I always tell the young people you can come easy or you can come hard and some of them are so silly they come the hard way we were talking that and I we were driving me saying we realize that it's a demon that gets onto the child and makes that child feel that me being rebellious is the right thing they are not at their sound Minds you don't you don't I'm telling you because what makes a child that grow up in the grew up in the church decide to walk away from God somewhere they picked up a devil sir I'm telling you sorry I got to say that so what we we need to do is we we we need to pick up the skill of Deliverance some or other we need to get God you need to show me how to set my children free because brother brandham said I should have served God from the age of 12 but there was a devil that stopped me so what we need to do parents is less up the belt and more of the knes and I know you do that I know you do that go to to 12 wow haven't touched my notes right but let's let's finish with this so the Holy Ghost Faith restored deliver it generation dies Jude comes 33 years later he says Hey we've got to contend for that right gets lost through the church ages but God says I'll restore he said I'll send you Elijah the prophet hallelujah amen and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children amen thank God for brother brandom and brother brandham comes with a message listen it comes with a message that restores the faith right restores the faith they had three and a half years we've had more than that so the faith gets restored right but he locks it up in books and tapes because some of us were not around so laying in the message is rapturing Faith right so we're not fighting for I want a I want a Ministry of healing yes we want healing we're not fighting for miracles and signs and wonders yes we want that but we're fighting for a body to be changed that's what we're fighting for so Jude said hey we got quickened at Pentecost let's go back to that brother BR says no we're not going back to that only we're going to back to that plus because we've got to get back to Eden right we need to have a body change cuz brother brand said it's not just a faith it's the faith a faith for a Rapture so what we contending for is for a Rapture some of you don't believe me all right do you believe there's going to be a Rapture do you believe the Rapture is on do you you believe you're part of the Rapture now I've got a question for you do you believe you changing you had to think about that first because you thought it was like a trick question not a trick question do you know so you can this morning testify that there's things changing in your life right do you know what that proves that the rapture's on do you realize that if you can say today brother that God is changing me it means the rapture's on you mean we've been in the Rapture since I don't know when you've been because God's been changing you you see this body change is not going to be like that the body change is happening as we sit in church and as you go through life and to as you go to work and now as 10 to 12 I got to finish now shortly right give me a few minutes people can accept when we say God's A Healer people accept that but people struggle with when you tell them God's changing you because we look in the mirror and we don't see the change am I right we look in the mirror and we know our own failures and we know our own mistakes and we know what happens when the child upsets you right it's all right we know that you know that when the child gets you makes you angry and all of a sudden you blow up like a p frog and because you know all these things you struggle to accept that you're being changed you can easily accept if I tell you young sister you be God's going to send you a husband you say yeah brother yeah right you can accept that God God will heal you yeah brother God will give you a job yeah brother God will meet your needs yeah brother but if I tell you God's changing you that's a difficult one H because we judge ourselves by what we see in the mirror and what makes it even harder is sitting next to you is your biggest critic your husband or your wife and so I'm not going down that path brother man where you said amen you to get in trouble and I'm not going to be to blame for that but that's what I'm saying right because I can't I struggle to accept that God is changing me when I know my wife knows me better than I know myself because I know my wife knows about the times I get upset so am I and and I'm thinking the devil's telling me yeah how can you say you're being changed when your wife will tell you you're not being changed and so we struggle with that because we don't realize but listen I want to tell you this morning you're changing you you are changing and your children are changing and your home is changing and your life is changing and that sister stood up and said I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I was and that is what we can testify to this morning and if you can testify to that it means the raptures on it means the body change is on but brother Feddy how can you say that look at my hair I'm getting gray I'm just looking at brother Milan's beard that's almost fully gray and I dare say he's changing yes he's changing yes look at sister Marty yes she's changing little by little it's happening you don't know it it's happening there's a change happening there's a change happening you don't get angry like you used to you're praying more you love more you care more you're reading more amen your child upsets you don't react like you used to when the Lov one next to you upset you don't react like you used to you're being changed and if they will just be honest they will acknowledge there's a change happening there's something happening what is it brother FY the rapture is on the Rapture is on there's a body change happening amen amen one day it will be a full change I tell you then us golden oldies we're going to come walking in here brother hair on the head down to Optimum weight look I'm walking in here brother spring in our step brother will be changed but I want to tell the critics don't wait for then yeah amen I just put a back on you that laughed at me right you see what I'm saying some of you laughed when I said I'm going I'm being changed unbeliever he should have been on your feet Said Amen brother 30 we believe that see what I'm saying but if I said now God's A Healer you'll all go yeah whatever I tell you brother fedd is changing wow brother Ben the the doubt to that one brother Ben I think we got to have a prayer line brother Ben and pray for them but some of them don't believe it now if you can't believe that I'm changing how are you going to believe you're changing I want you to look in the mirror and say I'm changing man stop listening to the devil man we are changing man we we we we we getting better every day we we loving more man look at back in 2023 and you look back say wow look we have come look where God's brought me the song keep them saying look where God has brought me man he never said the road would be easy he never said there'll be no problems but look where God has brought us he has brought us from a mighty long way what are we doing we're contending for the faith we're contending for our faith has been restored man look where God has brought us he has brought us from a mighty long way and I love the other part help me Kim I'm not what I I'm not what I ought to be the song oh you can't remember I'm not what I should be but I'm not what I was be encouraged this morning Believers he's brought us he brought us he brought us he brought us he has brought us from from a mighty long way can you testify to that you've been contending you don't realize you've been contending for a faith that's already been restored because what the ministry has done they've gone check it wasn't my phone e the ministry has gone into the message and they've picked up the faith and they've preached the faith to us as Believers and then you go to Revelation I'm going to finish shortly it's 5 to2 then you go to Revelation chapter 10 so what brother Ben has really been doing if I'm allowed to say this is he's come with the open book you know the open book in Revelation chapter 5 he he went to Christ and Christ gave him the open book which was the Fai fath right and brother Ben has come so what happened was the angel now steps behind the pastor brother brandham says the manifestation of the Holy Ghost is the Angel so the angel veils himself behind Pastor Benjamin and the angel through the pastor he now presents to you the faith that's laying in the word rapturing faith body changing Faith overcoming Faith but he presents it to you as a promise that's what he does he fetches it from the angel he comes behind the pulpit with a word from the angel which is the Faith from the open book and he presents it to the church and he titles his sermon uh speak and go forward you don't realize that he's bringing the words the promise from the angel and he's presenting it to you and because we are in scripture the angel says brother Ben says holy ghost through brother Ben says take the book he says that he's preaching it inir saying take the book I'm just quoting scripture he says take the book Revelation 10 it's verse seven in the days of the voice brother brandham verse eight the bride to 11 the bride so the ministry picks up the voice of brother brandham that's laying in books and he comes and he presents the open book and he says the raptures on on right he presents it to you as a word a promise now you take that promise and you do with it whatever you wish to do with it and if you go back to Revelation can we go to Revelation 10 brother I've got a close there Revelation I've got a 10-hour driver right so trust the Lord I'll travel like a thought but Revelation 10:8 please brother Armand and then we'll close right and look what the voice says right so verse verse 7 brother brandom Revelation 101 can we go to 101 sorry you know that's Christ right okay 101 is Christ 107 brother please that's brother brandom right 108 that's us okay you know these things right but look what happens from 108 to 11 there is the word presented then there is a response from the yeara then the year has to do something with it and then the year in verse 11 needs to prophesy it so when the word gets presented to you which is today or Pastor Ben does you say Amen the angel told John take the book all right John said Give me the book human nature angel said uhuh take the book in other words you must want to be in the book take the book then the angel said now you eat the book so you saying Amen to the book you saying hallelujah to the promises and then the angel says the Revelation it's sweet the revelation of the word it's sweet like you this morning saying Amen to the word it's sweet but then the angel says it's going to be bitter in your belly so when your child walks away it's bitter when a problem happens it's bitter when a situation happens it's butter but in the mouth oh sweet when you say when you say oh God spoke to me this morning God told me he's going to meet my needs sweet sweet sweet but Monday you got to stand and the devil trips you up and the devil messes you up but you're standing there remember you planted now you prophesy so I meet you I said brother how you doing he said brother fedy God's answering my prayer how you doing we don't use the word good anymore oh good tell the young people don't
