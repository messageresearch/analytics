today amen who's happy to be Christian amen praise the Lord middle of the week but the Lord is good amen just as a musicians are um going to their seats amen just a couple of quick announcements that um so there'll be a regular Service uh on Christmas Eve Sunday morning service there'll be no service on Christmas day um and there also be no midweek service between Christmas and New Year and then on um Christmas Eve I mean sorry New Year's Eve which is a Sunday as well we'll have no morning service but we're going to have an evening service of of dinner and testimony specials and then communion foot washing or say and the plan is to all be done by 11:30 and pray the New Year in and praise the Lord so details to come but that's basically the idea so if you come here Sunday morning New Year's Eve you've come early cuz there's no morning service okay but yeah we'll put that all on those B things but yeah just thought I'd um y put that there okay so let's go to the scripture shall we let's go to Galatians 2 and 20 going to read a couple of portions of script here um I'm going to read Galatians 2: 20 then we're going to go to uh uh Acts chapter 4 may pray this will tie together I believe it will as we go along um so Acts 2 uh sorry Galatians 2: 20 we'll get to acts soon amen this is I trust a very familiar piece of scripture to us all it says here I am crucified with Christ neveress I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me he says I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain amen then we're going to go to acts 4 and then we're going to go to uh verse 23 I believe I have it here acts 4 and 23 then we're going to read down to uh verse 31 and um says here uh acts 4:23 and being ghost this is after the Sanhedrin has questioned them and so on uh they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said un to said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered to together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou Hast anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together uh for uh for to do whatsoever thy hand or thy counsel determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness uh they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done in the name of thy holy church all Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together they're all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness amen that's the first prayer meeting one of the first prayer meetings I pray we have a that kind of a prayer meeting we've been restored back to a book of Acts prayer meeting amen amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer amen this evening if you got a need you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen gracious father we want to thank you so much we can truly from our heart say we want you to stay Lord we want to be in your presence Lord we want to be very near where you are Lord we don't want to be at a distance from you father we want to be right next to you we want to want you to be in US Lord Jesus surround us father Lord we just want to pray there be nothing between our souls and our savior tonight Lord if there is anything I pray just be put under the blood father may you forgive us of all of our sins our trespass our iniquities Lord cleanse us even of our secret faults father and may just have your way in this service we're so thankful we can stand in Victory because you won US the victory that on Calvary and as we bow our heads we say Lord take the service under your Great Divine control may you anoint speaker and hearer Lord may you pray through us as well Lord and anyone who may be watching by the way of the stream I pray your presence would be with them as well minister to their lives too father we love you Lord and we thank you for this opportunity to praise and worship you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may you may have your seats uh tonight just want to take a couple of moments here uh just speaking about you know the goodness of our God now I'm so thankful that we can we can look into the book of Acts here and you know you know they had a bad day they had a real stressful day and we know we've come to the middle of a week and you there's a lot of things going on in life there's a busyness of life there's pressure of Christmas coming up and presents and family and Logistics and there's all these things that are going on in life there's pressure of this world and this laty and age we live in but yet we have a source of strength we can run to amen that that that that we can be filled because I'm so thankful that the life of God within us is greater than that of the world you know we are Overcomers in this age we're not just getting by or scraping through us we are Overcomers amen so so the spirit of God within us will overcome all things now brother Braham says this in in in the SM Church age here in the church age book he says as uh quoting the scripture be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands y Millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like Antipas a faithful martyr they held not their lives dear un death often we think it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycaps and all the martys the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be God forever amen it's going to realize that we have a faith that's working mightily and we got to realize that as brother FY said on Sunday as God started with fire he's going to end with fire so how he started the church is how he's going to finish the church so if the church was filled with the Holy Ghost and the god came down and broke every shackle Every Chain every problem he'll do the same thing tonight amen cuz how he started is how he's going to finish I'm so thankful for that amen tonight now you know we think about the think about it where the Apostle Paul would say this you know that the life he now lives he lives by the faith of the Son of God so he you know you I know I've said this many times but it wasn't the the faith of the Apostle Paul he lived by anymore but it was the faith of God himself that was living in his life and he says I do not frustrate the grace of God now to frustrate it means uh just from the Thea Bible dictionary it says to do away with to set aside or disregard the Apostle Paul says I do not set aside the grace of God now we know Grace in The Bible in the New Testament means a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life so he says I do not set aside God's Divine influence in my life I do not disregard it I do not nullify it or make it void or frustrate I do not reject it I do not refuse it amen it doesn't matter what I'm going through in life I embrace the grace of God Amen I embrace God's Divine influence I do not reject it because you know the Apostle Paul came to a place in his life he realized he was part of the word I mean he wasn't just a Pharisee learning the word he was part of that word he was actually prophecy manifested because because um it would say in the book of Isaiah that our lord Jesus would be a light I will also give the as a light for the Gentiles now I'm just I'm just jumping through these things so don't want to be uh caught up in reading but you can read it later in Isaiah 49 they also give the light to the Gentiles now we know that this speaks of speaks of our Lord Jesus Christ as as I think even Paul himself would say that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should raise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles but then Paul himself even said that he was the fulf Fulfillment of that scripture it says for for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I will set thee to be light o to the Gentiles or of the Gentiles so Paul realized he was prophecy made flesh he was more than just a religious person it wasn't just part of his life it was his life it's all that way he was cuz his identity was wrapped up in the Lord it wasn't something he just he just decided to try for a season but he realized it was him it's who he was was the word and he realized that the life he was living was prophecy made manifest now we speak about predestination and we can throw it way into the deep end where where where it actually nullifies the power of God and that's what's happened down in every age where where the church has got bogged down to predestination they don't think they need to witness no more they think they don't need to pray no more they think they don't need to reach out in the spirit no more because whatever God's going to do he's going to do and whatever he's not going to do he's not going to do you you see it you know that's why that's why Wesley came with the Armenian Doctrine sure it wasn't imp Perfect Balance cuz he wasn't a prophet like in this last age but the church had g into Calvinism so much they had no burden for Missions they had no burden to outreach or just be a living witness because I thought well if you're predestinate you'll make it if not you'll not what you know that's it but you know God's program is tied with man and so God would use Wesley to swing the church back into a missionary fire and Zeal even just in their local area and we know brother Brown brought the right balance between Calvinism and Armenian ISM I'm not going into that tonight but he brought that perfect balance between it right because we know we're predestinated but really you should you should be living your predestination amen right the life you now live like Paul could have basically said I'm predestinated that's why God found me on the road to Damascus that's why he's transformed me that's why he's living in my life cuz Isaiah when he spoke of that prophecy he was actually speaking of me and here I am yeah and we should be able to say the same thing with the scripture what God spoke about a bride predestinated before the foundation of the world here I am and I'm living out that predestinated prophecy amen praise God Amen you know so so this is to me you know if I'm predes inated why not live it to all that you are why not give yourself to it you know if you're predestinated to be part of the word why why only give it part of your life why only give part of your life to Lord why don't you give your all you know you think about how you know you think about it like just say for example of years when I was maybe a child and I'd tell everyone I'm predestinated to marry Christine ruig and then I get old enough I can get married but I don't even start she doesn't know who I am you know I don't start cting her we don't get engaged we don't get married and maybe you time would go on go to my 40s 50s you know but I'm predestinated to marry you think hold on why don't you go marrier then you if you're saying you're boasting this is who you are this is what you meant to be why aren't you giving yourself to it letting it live you'd begin to question if I was really predestinated or not to do that right but see the thing is if it was really revealed to me which it was and here's a wedding band and she's got the wedding band praise God Amen Hallelujah well the rest is history right but you know but what kind of testimony would it be is oh the Lord told me I'm going to marry her and we're not even you know we don't even you know what I mean there's no wedding band on here it's not be it's not become living you'd be think what do you mean shouldn't you say yes and just jump into it and praise God now you take that into the spiritual realm prise the Lord you know we say we're predestinated why not live out your predestination because because the Bible says we pre we are predestinated to be conformed to His Image we are predestinated to overcome we are predestinated to go on a Rapture amen so why not live it out amen oh but you know I want to I want to do some other things first I wish I'd met God younger amen yeah I wish I was younger I wish when I was 11 I had a heart on my heart I wanted to meet God I wish I met him back then I was 22 or something when I finally met him went through all kind of Sorrows and pains and hardship and darkness the Lord can bring you out but it would have been good at 11 yeah I would have liked that more to know him through the teenage years for him to be my guide through all kinds of troubles and different things man that'd be awesome yeah yes that's right praise God Jesus amen you see on I'm just finding something here but you see what happens is people get in their mind they haven't sewed enough Wild Oats yet so they got to live life before they really serve God no serving God is living life he I I've come to give you life and life more abundantly I haven't come to give you a monastery kind of life with nothing in it just a stone cell and a window on a chair no no we got Abundant Life yeah we got the best kind of a life amen and I'm actually talking more spiritual than natural with that whole Al you know because who cares about natural riches it's going to be Vapor anyway you know but to know him endureth forever but people get in their mind that they haven't soed enough Wild Oats haven't lived life yet see there's something that they're lacking and I say that that that that lacking is the indwelling of the Holy Ghost that's right amen because God can anoint and you know we were actually driving was it today we were talking about it or I don't know where you know because people have this phrase oh they just were Anointed with the Holy Ghost hold on what do you mean just anointed by God people were just anointed praise God for the anointing we should never diminish anything God does for us we should never say oh people just shout at camp and that's it and that like like that's a bad thing praise God you got somewhere to shout if you shout in the in the the shower praise God you're shouting somewhere amen I'd rather be shouting somewhere and not anywhere right so people say oh they were just anointed what do you mean that was God who made heavens and earth came and anointed their Spirit started ministering to their lives and people say they were just anointed that's a that's an incredible thing amen praise the Lord you know because if he starts there well he can get into the soul he starts working he get into the soul you know we should we should we should treasure everything God does no matter how big or small that's all Stepping Stones that's stepping stones in the journey so praise the Lord so we should never ever speak negative about those kind of things we should treasure it say thank you God you know I'm always I know I probably get very emotional at Camp come Monday morning so I'm like thank you Lord you came this year again I don't take it for granted oh we're going to have camp and this is what's going to happen no God sovereignly says I'm coming too he could easily say no he's Sovereign you can't make him do anything he he chooses to say yes I'm going to be identified with those people I'm going to be identified with you I'm going to live in your life I'm proud of you I'm not ashamed of you and he and he and he and he joins himself to you know that's incredible amise the Lord praise the Lord amen so you know what we need like the disciples in Acts chapter 4 is a prayer meeting where God refills us with the holy spirit it's absolutely essential it will answer every question I'll say 9.99 problems out of 10 in life are answered by refilling of the Holy Ghost amen amen that is it is the cure for basically everything sure you can come and get a bit of guidance you have some questions sure that's all part of it we're happy to talk to you about anything but more of God answers basically everything amen because if we have less of God we become more caral if we have more of God we become more like him right so we can we can we can serve God in a greater way you know we really always want to stay with our source of strength we never want to be cut away from our source of strength I'm not going to ask for a show hands but how many people actually listen to the sermon of the week I hope you all say yes I do it's amazing Christian I talking about it if people just listen to that the answer that they asked us about for that week was already in that message and we just marvel at that they said what didn't you not hear that you know but see the devil wants to Cloud Our Lives over that we're not listening to the voice of the messenger we're not in the word this is our source of strength we're getting spiritual food I me gives us strength through the day amen gives us you know you hear the you hear the ministry of God there in the prophet the power of God moving it should raise an expectation Lord You're the same God as you were back there you're still alive today you can do the same things you can move in power we've seen him move in power but but we I'm expecting him to do far more than what he's already done you know we're not here just to say well it was good a year ago and now we just slump down and go through the motions no the Supernatural part of our life is the most important part amen we are Supernatural beings we're not natural beings we're not carnal beings we are supernatural beings and if you neglect the Supernatural part you neglect really all of your Victory all of your joy all of your peace you're basically frustrating the grace of God and throwing it aside but if you embrace it like the disciples see they didn't go to their they didn't go on trade me or someplace and and and and find some self-help book how to overcome pressure they didn't sit around and go on their Instagram feed and look at some nice motivational you know scriptures and they didn't look at those things and some power quotes and well that's fine but that wasn't their source of strength their source of strength was more than ink on paper or or pixels on a screen their source of strength with God himself that's why they had that prayer meeting is because they realized the devil had come against them right and that's why they cried out Lord You're God you made all things look at what they're doing and here we are we're in this need and God came and filled them gave them boldness that that what the devil is trying to put on their lives to to stop them living the Christian Life God just broke it off Hallelujah and they became stronger because of it amen that's why you know you're in a trial the devil's trying to stop your joy stop your witness it's actually God allowing that to make you stronger amen that you can actually God wants to use it as a testimony where you go to him say God the enem is against me you're God I need your help I'm just one of your children then God comes down breaks the Yoke of that thing and you begin to realize that mind battle where did that go where did that troubled feeling go where did that question go it just it just burnt out by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah amen brother BR says I've seen men who took Alcoholics Anonymous and tried to make uh tried to be made well take shots take everything at all the psychology in the world and the best types of doctors that could have been gotten to give them treatment and fail now if you're not willing to take God's way go there that way yeah you need help people need help okay these things are to help but it's not the Cure right and I've seen that same man picked up by the blood of Jesus Christ and be made a saint of God and a preacher of the Gospel amen now if you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am right but if it takes the name of Holy Roller to find favor with Christ and be condemned by the world that I'm one of them that's right look I love him amen so so the the anointing of God breaks the Yoke of the enemy I mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Cure All Hallelujah we have a silver bullet right we have the Cure amen some of you looking at me like what are you going on about but you know if you really meet God and realize if he did it for you then he can do it for you again remember they did not go there for have a prayer meeting to receive the Holy Ghost they already had the Holy Ghost they got in Acts chapter 2 but God refilled them to break every chain amen and we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen and we know that the pre predestinated will hear and make ready for the countdown brother says in the message the spoken words The Original Seed amen so if we're predestinated we're going to hear and be made ready that's why we that's why we hear the word that's why let the word change our lives it's because we're preparing for the countdown amen praise the Lord and we're living in that season right now are we not amen hallelujah praise the Lord but you see everyone wants to you know this world is full of substitutes fake sh fake meat fake everything it's a substitute of the original and that's the same thing with the word of God people want to substitute something well you know for the word it won't do what it says you know I won't go into that I'll just leave it alone but you know the fake stuff is not the same as the real stuff they say it does the same thing it's not anyway now otherwise I'm going to go a food tangent I don't feel like talking about food right now now how are you going to substitute something for the word of God and still say you're led by the Holy Ghost don't make sense does it no sir it doesn't he's been my God guide through life he's guided me unto life he was the one that led me to life and he is my life without him I have no life without him I have nothing else he's my all and all in the hours of my trouble he stands by me yesterday he blessed me today they done the same what can I expect the same forever praise His name amen yes sir he promised it he'll do it he is my life he's my guide all in all I've trusted him I've had some hard Tri I trust him uh wherever I go I want you to do it if you go to wash you woman trust him if you go downtown trust him so may he be your guide in every part of life Hallelujah Lord amen now brother Bram says that he's speaking of the church you know the Bram Tabernacle he says he says they need a refilling of the Holy Ghost this is what we need as well oh yes okay he's saying here now I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the the big sister so obviously he's not a Braham Tabernacle right here he says one thing that the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at the Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and a and a refilling of the Holy Ghost right everyone get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle here but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and when it comes to place I can't enjoy my religion my salvation cuz there's something wrong somewhere because it's joy unspeakable full of Glory one see taste and see the Lord is good the it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm so glad I tasted that the Lord is good and I love honey but I never tasted any like that that's the best that I know so if we come to a spot where we can't enjoy our religion we can't we can't enjoy our Salvation what's happened the devil's put something on us that we stop enjoying it I that's why we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost because you get into his presence once again he refills you what happens The Joy comes back the bubbling stream starts gushing like never before and you can enjoy your religion your salvation better than when you first met him hallelujah amen why because he keeps it fresh amen now brother Braham now I've got I got two minutes now brother Braham says now he's speaking about when he crossed a log one day hunting and it was a big old log a big big old beach log it was laying in a stream and it looked big and strong but when he stood on it bits fell off of it and it became soft and doy because it was dead in that stream of life and he said now that's the same thing what happens you know with a Believer amen if if if the Life of Christ ever goes from them they'll be they'll be in the Stream of life but they'll rot twice as quick and he says to overcome is to keep life in you if you want to know how to overcome in this life keep the life of God in you keep it around you keep him around you don't do nothing to grieve him away I mean don't do nothing that's contrary to his word you keep him around you and you'll overcome yeah praise God Amen because remember if you think about that tree if that tree was alive it would probably be growing more than the ones around it because it's right in the Stream of life amen and we don't want to be sitting in church riding twice as quick because we've G the spirit of God from us he say well I'm predestinated but do you but do
