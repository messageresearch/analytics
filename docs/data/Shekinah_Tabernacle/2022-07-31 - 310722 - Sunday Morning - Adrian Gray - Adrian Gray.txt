believer is encompassed with angels and your prophet said we're even bumping into those angels and lord god your presence is where those lord [Music] have a representation an eternal thought that came from the lamb's book of life lord amen and how that your prophet said we were always christians we didn't become a christian when we gave our heart to you lord we just recognized that we were christians before the foundation of the world [Music] and lord god how your prophet said that we are as eternal as what you are eternal lord not on our bodies but lord jesus and that attribute and the soul and lord i pray lord this morning as we come to look into the depths of the word lord god that you have preeminences and that law that there will be no spirits that would try to interrupt this meeting lord amen and lord we are an overcoming people lord god and lord i pray lord this morning that we could do great destruction to the kingdom of satan amen because lord it's the time for us to take possession of everything we were robbed of by this earthly birth jesus amen and i pray lord god it should come on the scene and break every power father we are asking this and also lord for our brother ben where he is preaching and his wife and family lord god i pray that you'll be with him and then and you'll be with the fellowship in taranaki and with our brother already wherever he is in the united states lord i just pray lord god you'll bless them all and lord we ask these things in your wonderful name the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you saints thank you very much musicians it's nice to see you all again after this time and well we're back again after some time and i just pray that you prayed up this morning we're going to look into a lot of uh subjects i hope that you're not too frightened by the uh the heading here but we want to do great damage this morning amen you know you know we we don't want to be slacking around and just saying i'm in the message that's just a bunch of religion if you want it to be you know yes but we are here because the lord has a vision of you amen and so we're going to look into some things this morning i'm going to do the the most impossible thing i'm going to cram a five-hour sermon into one hour 10 minutes so you're going to have to hang on to your seats and uh i just pray that the lord will bless you mightily so we're going to go and look at a scripture uh how does this thing go uh i'm just a little bit nervous at the moment i've been preaching for 30 years i'm still going to get get nervous flick it on you just give that just make sure that it's all turned on by the handy does it go how come it doesn't go bro hey okay try it again put up the first slide there okay let's just look at this now i want to thank andy and his dear wife and family for the hospitality it's been really wonderful now we're going to look at our opening scripture the climax of a person's life [Music] and he says in the proverbs here two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die remove far from me vanity and lies amen amen give me neither poverty or riches feed me with food convenient for me amen not just any food now amen that's not not just uh what jesus once did food but food convenient for now amen praise the lord let us bow our heads heavenly father lord i pray just make these words alive lord and i pray we'll give you the glory lord we ask in jesus wonderful name amen amen now we are living in this age called laodicea we know that laodicea means people's rights and everyone's got rights but it is an age of narratives it is an age of conforming powers and it is an age of psychological influence that right yes and there's an age where satan is drawing up he's making up scenarios to draw you into amen he he makes scenarios to draw you into an entrapment and then he draws you into something and as he traps you then he blames you for being the one that caused the problem and initiated the problem amen that's exactly right is that right and if you accept what you have been entrapped in as real not even the lord can help you until you refuse to accept the condition that you agreed to and when you realize the entrapment that that has come to you and you go to the lord and he puts it under the blood he not only justifies you but the one who entrapped you he then puts it back on to the one he who trapped you yes so here so devil's been trying to put it into your lap now god puts it back into his lap amen praise the lord amen now we're going to go into some deeper things now so you just just have to keep with me because you have to know who you are in this hour you cannot think like a new zealander you cannot think from whatever culture that you come from that will not work the only power in this hour that you can look at that keeps you in a stable condition is knowing your true identity to know yourself as god sees you not as you see yourself but as god sees you yes sir that's right now watch down revelations 2 verse 17 hear that heavenly and now this is for the an earlier church age not follow this here he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to whom that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna yes and i will give him a white stone and us and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it so this what that we are in brothers and sisters is something that only you know about personally in your life a revelation is not something that you can give to somebody else it's personal to you now in the old testament the old testament were shadows pointing to reality at the end time now if you notice in the old testament temple there was a pot in the temple in the holy of holies where they stored some manner that fell every day but they picked some of it up and put it into a pot in the holy of holies yes that's right in that place that manner never rot it is that right and it could only be consumed once a year by a high priest when he went into the presence of the lord and it was only for that high priest and so nobody on the outside could access that hidden manner it was only personal glory to the priest that's right [Music] we're just building up something okay see if this is all going up now a profit comes and he says each age has a portion of hidden manner then comes the fullness at the end time that light never shined on then he says now then there's also a thought of the future partaking of hidden manner i think it will be the eternal partaking of the revelation of jesus christ and we'll go down to the last part and then the blue says but one day when our flesh changes the word and he will become what we have never dreamed possible now we are n and a glory hallelujah that god is releasing a revelation from within us that will change our bodies but you have to agree to that hallelujah amen so now at the end time when those seals were revealed from those seals comes a breaking away from your six seal earthly identity to your seventh seal heavenly identity yes and he's removing the dark glasses off of us so we can see ourselves as god sees us now let's go on to with another scripture just building up a big platform okay this is going to go it might shock you this this sermon okay it might be a real shocker go to this next one please bro this thing's not going this thing's not there we are now watch when the temple was being dedicated by solomon in the old testament he spoke certain words and those words carried on all the way right down to the ions of time but as the temple changed the attitude of the people had to be looking at where god was now watch now and one kings verse 8 uh chapter 8 verse 33 solomon's speech at the dedication of the temple where the lord came down when my people israel be smitten down before the enemy and we're living in a very evil age because they've sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication into this house now we're talking back then about the temple okay but i want to know where is the temple where's the temple today then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gave us unto their fathers now just keep those thoughts now now we have to look at the mystery of the temple because the temple is a progressive revelation amen that must end up with a conclusion so now it starts as a heavenly vision that moses was shown a heavenly vision of the temple in heaven now that heavenly vision had to be made and it's something tangible on the earth that's right so he saw this vision and this vision was the same vision in revelations 4 in revelation chapter 5 and he makes on the earth a tabernacle now we'll just show you the the these the scriptures because it's going to be a bit laborious for a starter next one please brothers now watch the words now he's seeing this vision in heaven let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them according to all that i show you so moses i'm going to show you something after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of the instruments thereof even so shall you make it and they shall make an arc of chopper in wood two cubits and a half shall be the length of robin a cubit and a half the bread the of and the cubit and the half the height thereof now when god makes something right he works from the inside to the outside amen when you do something you went from the outside to the inside but god is interested in the inside then the outside will take care of itself then he says in verse 21 and you shall put the mercy seat above the ark and the ark shall put the test and you shall put the testimony that that i shall give thee and there will i meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat between the two cherubims and upon the ark of the testimony of all the things i will give thee in commandment upon unto the children of israel so now moses i want you to make something i want you to make a tabernacle and this tabernacle that you are making is going to unfold into a revelation that it's going to be concluded at the end time it will be concluded at the time when the hidden manner is being revealed yes amen so now moses is catching this vision and he comes and he makes this earthly tabernacle and this earthly tabernacle is on a journey that's right hey matt so a heavenly vision is on a journey that's right through time yes and as time progressed the lord added more information to the vision that came to moses he gave more river information to the revelation of the tabernacle amen and moses the prophet had to lay out certain actions that pertained to the temple now watch when this temple was built by moses next one please brothers this tabernacle had to be anointed and moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein and sanctified them he sprinkled there upon the altar seven times and upon the altar and all the vessels both the lava and his foot to sanctify them and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him now i want you to watch that the tabernacle had to be anointed once by a prophet amen every time you see about a tabernacle it must have been anointed by a prophet but it was sprinkled seven times amen but when solomon came along and he built the temple it was not anointed again because they've already been anointed once and never to be anointed again on something that is made by man's hands i want you to catch these things now so now when moses the prophet anointed the tabernacle he anointed everything that pertained to it the priesthood all the furniture everything that pertained to that tabernacle a prophet anointed it yeah thank you lord all right amen god you catch this oh yeah because of because this denominational world out there it's missed the plot because it missed its profit now this tabernacle that moses built it had no city it was not constructed with any stones amen so as the heavenly vision of the pattern went from tabernacle to temple more information was given to the revelation this temple that moses sorry that solomon built david wanted to build it but he shed much blood he got many of the ingredients to build that tabernacle but his at that temple but solomon had to be the one to do it but it had to be in a certain geographical location it had to be placed in a location where david sinned amen because counted his soldiers he counted the people sorry that he had dominion over and he sinned against god because he was putting his trust in human ability and not trusting in god and an angel came and smote tens of thousands of david's people and the angel came and met david on the threshing floor of ornan the jebusites so now on a threshing floor was where things happen on a threshing floor chaff is separated from the wheat on a threshing floor is where your old nature gets thrashed away from you and your true identity comes into full expression yes amen now we would go a little bit further again next one please brothers now watch now here's solomon he's built this temple it took seven years to build the conclusion of the matter is at the end time seven church ages it takes to bring the temple to its conclusion mount moriah was chosen as the place to build the temple because of the sin of a man and so that temple was to show us something now remember in the book of ruth ruth met boaz in a certain place he met she met boaz on the threshing floor after that she had decided after sorry after she had decided and labored she met boaz on a threshing floor typing the holy spirit showing that the holy spirit is here to separate chaff and nature's away from us so that only our reality is able to stand is that right so on the threshing floor was as where your earthly dna is removed off of you [Music] and the seventh seal dna comes into reality foam are you with me so far amen praise the lord because the devil don't like this stuff it's going to get real hard you know i actually feel sorry for the devil at the moment what's coming now on and the jebusite wanted to give david that land free but david said no i'm going to pay for it amen now the reason why he paid for it was because if he didn't pay for it ornan could come back and make a claim on that land is that right so anything that's not paid for the enemy can make a claim on it and if a person's sins have not been saved they've not been saved from their sins the devil can make a claim upon you so now whoever pays for something it belongs to the redeemer of that land and the redeemer of that land has his right to do what he wants with anything that he's redeemed now if you claim to have been bought by the blood of jesus christ and you still want what has been added if you claim to be bought by the blood of jesus and you still want to have your own life then your testimony is false if it's not paid for the previous owner can come back and make a stake a claim upon you next one please brothers now the revelation in heaven went from a tabernacle to a temple but it must end up in a man now jesus has come on the scene to give more revelation to what moses saw that's right amen and he says oh it's going working now that's good now watch now the words it's just a foundation then jesus answered the jews and said what sign show us thou unto us seeing that thou dost these things and jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple in three days i will raise it up and they were listening and they were not listening by revelation then said the jews 46 years was this temple in building and will you roar it up in three days but he speaks spake of the temple of his body now as the revelation of the temple proceeds the previous has no longer any emphasis that's right okay now jesus himself he was the temple he was the real high priest he was the real sacrifice but this temple could not be put into action until it had had been anointed by a prophet so when jesus went down to the jordan river there was a prophet amen he washed the high priest he washed him as the sacrifice and in the presence of that prophet the dove of the holy ghost down came down to set that temple into service a prophet anointed that temple that's right amen now watch now jesus is in a junction of time this is coming it's going to get really it's going to be such a blessing to you to understand who you are amen now jesus himself he's the temple now remember the temple solomon built had had more information it had stones to make that temple that was not when the tabernacle was being built the tabernacle was moving but the temple was built on a hill as it became a city okay more information is coming so here comes jesus and jesus is a city amen he's the light of the city he's a priest he is melchizedek he's a sacrifice he's the lamb of god he's the vessels all in one man he's a stone he's a headstone he is the future capstone all in one man amen amen so now from the vision that moses saw in heaven it's now unfolding itself into a man and that one man has everything that was in the temple inside of himself amen that's right amen but the mystery of the temple could not remain as one man amen amen this is scary for the devil glory the female part had to come forth [Music] hey matt now watch now as we still building up the believer comes becomes the temple with all the additions now watch this thing this is in the book of acts but solomon built him in house however the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as south the prophet in other words the vision in heaven was not to read to be remaining in a tabernacle and a temple amen that's right he said heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool what house will you build for me saith the lord what is the place of my rest [Music] but he said heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool and when you have a footstool everything comes under dominion of your by your feet the way you walk now this temple that jesus was was not made by hands but there must be a conclusion to the vision in heaven where is the place of my rest when all earthly things are going to be my footstool where is the place of my rest in laodicea where there's got to be a temple of human beings that put everything under their feet so a footstool is where you take possession over all things to be conquered a footstool of satanic influence of the sickness of sickness of legacy of all things that came from the fall that bind us down of insecurities complexes jealousies envying and strife where is the temple on earth to make those things their footstool hallelujah amen come on here we are now watching this the statue of a perfect man remember what was in the lord's prayer let it be done on earth as it is in heaven let it be done on earth as it is in heaven amen let this be a parallel to what is in heaven amen is that right now watch what brother brad says statue of a perfect man now god of the bible said that stephen spoke of solomon building a temple and the most high don't dwell in temples made with hands for heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool but a body has thou prepared me amen there you are a body has thou prepared me god dwells in the statue of man reflecting himself into that being we are to be one for him the heavenly vision to reflect through amen god in us being his tabernacle god manifesting god has always at all time reflected himself and man now let's just go a little bit further there's only a platform now now apostle paul a messenger anointing a church one corinthians 6 19 what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is which is in you which you have you have of god and you are and you are not your own that's right for your bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit now where is the biggest problems that we have in laodicea and our body and our human spirit that's right that right but he said glorify god in your body and in your human spirit because when he says the spirit is not talking about the holy spirit that's right your spirit yes that's right amen and then he says and here's the apostle paul two thousand years ago prophesying and the people are listening to him and they don't even know what he's talking about romans 16 verse 20 and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly but not back then shortly means sometime in the future at the end time the true temples at the end time are going to put all things under their feet believe it praise the lord what are you as god sees you you see brothers and sisters we're in a serious time and i'm going to show you very soon shockingly how probably 95 of people in this message have got a wrong concept on what god says they've got they have actually blown it and we need to shake ourselves because we are living in a time you cannot live beneath your privileges it will be brother now what are you as god sees you now watch now apostle paul says 2000 years ago for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part for seven church ages i know in part i'm looking through the glass darkly but right at the end time but then i shall know even as i am known watch now sorry as the scriptures unfold these multiple temples now the book of matthew he says here you are the light of the world a city i am a city yes i am yes amen amen sit on a hill that cannot be hit this city you do not hide it somewhere you don't hide it in the bedroom you don't go and hide it or you know this city must be seen now watch how he's unfolding some things in that he's typing the old testament temple and he's bringing it into you and he says if any man purge himself from these things he shall be a vessel oh i'm a vessel i'm one of the furnitures in the temple i'm a vessel in the temple that right then in one peter two verse five he says you're lively stones i'm a stone in the temple but where was i cut to be a stone in this temple at the end time i was cut in a quiet place making a noise somewhere over there and then brought it brought at the right time into a place where i could be useful into the hands of god i am a stone you are a stone you're a vessel you are a city is that right build up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood i am a priesthood a priest can go right into the presence of god oh thank you lord that's fine i am a stone i'm a vessel i am a city all in one person amen is that right yes and i can offer up spiritual sacrifices yes praise the lord the devil don't want you to know these things now because we can say amen but what do we do when we're not here so now we'll just go i'll just flick this through a couple of more we have already done that one so now the elect the person the individual is the true city the new jerusalem the real temple of god the stones of the temple the vessels in the temple the real priesthood and the offerer of spiritual sacrifices all in one person that's right hey man so now here's this temple you are it you're all that now we're going to look at this picture now there is all the things that went in the natural temple there was there all of these things was in that temple that had to be anointed by a prophet all these things was spread out amongst this man-made temple there was a road priesthood and he wasn't interceding there was a labor washed by the water of the word and here's the incense which is the prayers of the saints being offered up all in a temple there was this basin for the uh the oil there was this um what thing for carrying wine what is wine in this day stimulation by the revelation of the word of god is that right we have this prophetic light within us we have the throne of god in our hearts is that right but do we know it and we have this and inside this is a treasure and an earthen vessel now the temple and the vessels had to be anointed by a prophet and if there was no prophet to anoint the temple then there was no life going to come to the temple and this is why you are a privileged people because you received a prophet that brought forth a word that was able to anoint you and if you receive that word that anointing it puts you into service and that but it must be recognized because the one thing that satan does not want you to be able to do is to start making claims on what you are so now i'm just trying to get to where we're going to start off this morning now in the old testament this is what moses had to do you shall make now moses had to anoint his vessels the ark and everything you shall make it an oil of a holy ointment and ointment compound after the art of the apothecary it shall be unholy anointing oil and you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation there with and the ark of the testimony and the table and all his vessels it looks as this word his and the candlestick in all his vessels and the altar of incense and the ultra of burnt offering with his vessels and the lava and his foot then he goes on and you should take the anointing oh and anoint the tabernacle and all that is therein and you shall hallow it and all the vessels thereof and it shall be holy and you should take the anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels and you shall anoint the labour and his foot and and so on and so on that's right so now all these things that you saw in the old testament temple all these things accumulates into one person but what was your opening scripture when you fall into problems what do you look to amen now we're going to go to a certain place now we're going to clip down so i just got to squeeze this in the hidden manner in an earthen vessel now brother bradley was preaching the contest in 1962 and he says some startling things that people missed it and he says make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us o lord god with thy mighty hand jehovah bless these ministers here bless all the laity and all the visitors be thou with us lord we are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit may have more preeminences in our life now if if you didn't know what the rapture cycle was you wouldn't know what he was saying because what is the rapture cycle he reveals himself as the son of man with a shout is that right and then after that shout comes forth he has to get preeminences over the believer and then once he's got preeminences over the believer then he can change the body but if he hasn't got preeminences over the believer he cannot change the body because this must reflect a heavenly vision amen because as the vision came down from heaven to moses at the end time it takes those that are the temple back to eternity again because remember it comes from heaven down through time then back to eternity again amen that's right amen said help us god forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty warriors of the faith open this year lord the hidden manner that rock beneath the rock that we may see the program of god kept off the pyramids of our lives put the capstone jesus christ upon every one of us now we'll go and we'll look at this now amen for god has who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so we have this treasure and earthly vessels so inside of your earthly vessel god has placed a treasure there that must come into expression amen now you have no value for something to be a treasure there is value put upon it that treasure in you must give honor to god but what is that treasure now we go back to the old testament again don't worry if you're not getting all this you will jeremiah thus says the lord god of host the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase which is sealed and this evidence which is open open and put it in an earthling earthen vessel at a certain time you will come and possess lands now the prophet god then says in gabriel's instructions he says then we picked up the scroll we picked up the scrolls that the scroll was handed to his hand and that jeremiah and jeremiah 32 verse 6's cousin hannah meal was left some air and they were going into captivity which we're going into with him this morning captivity and was kept in an earthen vessel shows where the power of god and the scrolls and the secrets of god is known in the heart he says our our plan of redemption that same being kept in earthen vessels jesus name and the revelation so now in the old testament was in the temple an earthen vessel but now this earthen vessel becomes us and inside of us and the earth and vessel is a revelation of ourselves a revelation of your reality amen and how god brought a message to you to bring down your six seals of your earthly lineage and bring you up into your eternal representation thank you lord we believe it now we're in a junction time we and i laid the seer is mystery babylon okay now watch you are seeing in the news worldwide the whole human race turned completely insane that's right the whole human race has moved into total insanity that's right they don't even know the difference between a male and a female they're that stupid that's just stupid but this world systems is on the verge of total collapse something's causing it now we're not going to get and i'm going to show you some things now in the old testament when the children of israel were captured and taken into babylon they were down there 70 years is that right and they took and they dismantled the temple and took it and took all the furnitures down into babylon they took the priesthood into babylon they took the candlesticks into babylon they took all the furniture into babylon and they took the vessels into babylon but you watch what's happening to the world now they are trying to put babylonian influence into god's vessels now when beltish has ah his kingdom was coming to an end so those babylonians went and got some temp some vessels that have been anointed by a prophet and tried to put babylonian drunkenness into those vessels oh god have mercy they're right and right at the time when they were trying to put drunkenness into those vessels that were anointed by a prophet god was raising up cyrus the bear i am so amazed how many people in the message look at world events and they haven't got a cotton-picking understanding of what's going on worldwide how many people you hear going on about oh look what russia is doing don't you know the prophecy in the bible amen it's true even ministers going on about oh was it so awful what russia is doing is that right russia's fulfilling what a prophet said they would do now watch now these things remember that babylon was destroyed by the meads and the persians is that right and they are tight there's the bear that's right babylon was the lion the beast and the persians the bear greeks greece was a leopard and rome was a dragon the bear is always raised up to destroy babalon amen yes so here we see it in the image that daniel saw the lion the bear the leopard and the dragon but the time when that babylonian empire came to an end was at a junction when they were trying to put drunkenness into vessels anointed by god amen and how many of us come under the influence of babylonianism and start agreeing with babylonian things that's coming over the news media and start to accept it as normal oh lord have mercy amen amen now watch in 1960 i think it was this great thing happened i preached this last three weeks ago in our church and i was so staggered by how many in the message haven't even seen the thing what's going on in the world right now in 1963 only one man on the earth knew what that was a sign of amen when a russian president hit his shoe upon the podium at the united nations only one man on the earth knew and this man was putting his shoe on the podium and all these ignorant serpent seed leaders looked yeah and i thought what a stupid man hitting us they didn't even know he was fulfilling what daniel said was going to happen at the end time to show this is the time of the feat at the free time of the image that daniel saw one man knew it one man who looked at to the scriptures of daniel and placed the activity and says this is that that was spoken by daniel that's right man this went over the internet all over the world i put it together three weeks ago and everyone stole it but never mind sure has ex-russian president medvedev prophesy and he doesn't even know why he's saying it and he's quoting the sixth seal to the united states and nato he said we're going to destroy you oh my god wow he's quoting the sixth seal to all these leaders of the world amen and they look and they can't see that scriptures have been fulfilled right before their eyes that's right he says the us and its worthless lap dog do i like the way this man talks man i just love that that's that's my kind of talk you know worthless lap dogs those bunch of worthless useless european prime ministers and presidents useless worthless lap dogs must remember the words of the scripture judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged this is a heathen man quoting scriptures then he goes into the sixth seal for the great day of his wrath has come and who can withstand it amen wow hallelujah amen wow he's declaring to babylon we're going to destroy you wow is that right amen and it's happening right in front of your eyes in world events and you should know these things if you have read what a prophet said was going to happen at the end time and message people go on the usual day thinking about all the extra dollars they can make and not knowing that prophecy is coming to pass right in front of your eyes the government of russia banned all sodomite laws you are not allowed to make yourself anything more than a male or female to show and bring a rebuke to the west that has corrupted the whole world that's right yeah right now we're going to go into the subject now i just put that as a platform there okay awesome this is where satan really gets us hiding give it to him right now who are you amen the temple are you all the vessels and everything that was in shadow form in you is that right amen then don't ever deny that in your life because you'll be defeated every single day of your life now i stand here no different to you i get every every temptation you get i get that's right i am not superman i suffer everything that you suffer see i'm not one step better than any of you you don't want to see what look i did something i spent years of my life overseas the devil cannot get me with money woman or popularity but by gummy tries see he tries now we're just going to skip some things now there are various forms of attack that he's that he takes has it go with he tries to conform you to the realm of bodily afflictions is that right now right now rome controls using four things wars famines diseases and beasts of the earth amen but when you mention the word diseases everybody goes quiet but rome's behind it all amen now what rome does it creates a scenario traps you into it then blames you for it now let's go into the political world who made the war in the ukraine was it russia was the vatican using the united states of america and nato they provoked and provoked and provoked they are creating something russia goes in to defend themselves then they go and blame russia for starting the war right russia never started anything they're defending themselves so in your humanity he sets up scenarios to trap you you get trapped he blames you then he wants you to accept what you've been trapped into as real so in the lowest realm he's tries to conform you to the realm of bodily afflictions the next realm higher he's using mind paralyzing narratives and the next realm higher he's trying to get you by ref by having you not identify yourself as god sees you now this is where the bit that i'm going to enjoy in 1995 i was in egypt and i took some six other people with me to egypt on a tour i took them to the pyramids and into then i took them into israel so there was myself and you know six other kiwi brethren and the others went uh we were we had to go from cairo to where the pyramids were in the desert now i was warmed out in the desert as hawkers a hawker is a person who's a liar and a deceiver and a thief you're like a car dealer basically these people these people get stolen goods and they try to go and rip a tourist off right and so these people they hide behind rocks watching the tourists come out and then they step out and try to rip you off now there's some good egyptians okay not just the ones in the in the red sea there are some good egyptians so now i've been warned watch out for the hawkers so i'm walking along the others are riding camels like that you know these these arabs come out and you pay a dollar or something i'm saying it's more than that your mother was there that's right your mum was there so while they were riding camels i'm walking around minding my business and out from the rocks pops a hawker and what he what he does he throws something on the ground in front of him well we'll just we'll put it like this throws her on the ground in front of me like this just pick it up it's yours it's free no i know he's a lying help okay he keeps on going pick it up it's yours it's free there's nothing free in the middle east now i'm good for a go you know i've always been good for a go he keeps on saying it pick it up it's yours it's free so i'm thinking mate i know this guy's a crook and i'm looking at this this trinket he's just thrown on the ground just throwing it in front of me about a meter in front of me i'm looking at this i'm looking at this guy and i think mate i wonder what'll happen if i pick it up says it pick it up it's yours it's free so i said i'm good for a go man so i picked it up and i picked it up and the guy was on to me he says i want this match and i want this match and i want this for this and i want you to sell i want to sell you this and this guy was on and on and i said i thought you said it was free when i picked it up i made a contract with that man without knowing it and that guy was on to me pick it up it's free i picked it up now it's no it's no longer free and i had unwittingly entered into a contract with that man and as long as i held that in my hand i was obligated to that man and i was holding that thing and man i can get stewed up and as long as i was holding that in my hand that guy was taunting me i want this much i want you to pay this much for that he's going on and on and on and on and it would go from one thing to another to that man i'd made a deal with him when i held that in my hand see then i got so brassed off i threw the thing on the ground and walked away and after i threw it on the ground he was cursing me and carrying on and using every profanity and calling my mother and all sorts of things and you know he was just going for it but i was no longer holding it amen see i was no longer holding it now he could only just curse at me you know i'm used to people cursing at me that doesn't worry me i just kept walking to the pyramids and he was cursing away but i was no longer holding the object now i hope you got this now now we've got to try and find a balance in all these things trying to find a balance now if you can get this thing in the disease realm you'll get it in every realm amen all diseases we know are of the devil is that right they are fallen angels sickness can be permitted of the lord to keep a person the lord uses in full submission like paul and brother branham they you know apostle paul was given a a a uh a demon on him but affected his eyesight so that god could keep him in his hands brother barron had that black thing in his stomach to keep him in his hands to keep him in god's hands sickness can be used by the lord for character building chastisement or showing mercy or to prove your faith but also then not connected with that a sickness and disease can be satan directly trying to hinder the work of the lord and fighting against your calling amen or satan trying to defeat you and take your life before your time now i'm just trying to get so that this doesn't go on for hours i want to get to a certain spot now one night i was watching i was you know when a minister gets a sermon god puts him through things to give him something to direct his thoughts with i was watching all the people in the message getting sick this virus thing that was going on around the place and i was watching them i think man what's going on here then one night at 12 o'clock i woke up and i saw myself saying these words they are nothing but lying vanities they're nothing but lying vanities and then i decided that i would go the next day and discover what was in the subject of lying vanities now my theme today is a box full of snakes in a symptom and vanity age a box full of snakes is that in the message brother absolutely i don't get any say anything that's but it's in the message a box full of snakes now put some six inch nails through you through through your clothes because this is going to get really hard out bring it on now how do you look at things brothers and sisters do you look at things from your earthly perspective or do you look at things from your heavenly perspective do you look at each situation that you fall into from what you're born with here or do you look at every situation you go into as god sees you because it's too much fear in the message right now watch this now this is a beautiful looking box this is the spirit of the spirit of laid this here that looks so presentable to you laodicea looks so wonderful on the outside oh we can do this and we can do this and oh you know ladies here presents itself as good intentions to disarm you light a seer is all good intentions and it goes out saying just accept this agree to this and it will all work out right so now let's just say that you were in the natural world and there's a person who comes along and gives you this beautiful looking box and it's got this beautiful ribbon on it and you look at this box say oh what a lovely lovely box oh it's such a nice color it matches my skirt that color see this is a beautiful looking thing thank you brother for that oh and the and the ribbon is so beautiful it matches my apron it's just so beautiful the way that this box has been presented to me the colors are perfect the ribbon's beautiful and it draws you and you think oh so thank you very much amen and it's caught you off guard i think i'll have a look at the box it looks so beautiful on the outside but i wonder it's such a beautiful and the ribbon's just so neat i'm going to take the ribbon off and i'm going to see what beauty is in inside the box we'll have to i'm sorry but i'll show you with this there's the box amen inside of it is a snake inside of the box is a snake and that snake in the box is not what you looked at when you looked at the outside now let's have a look at what brother branham says now don't sign on the dotted line now you are a temple of the holy ghost and you've got every influence coming against you sicknesses psychological problems anything to bring you down now this world that we have living in is a world of symptoms now what is a symptom a symptom is any any effect trying to be recognized as a fact that's what a symptom is it's a feature wanting to be a recognized condition an attribute of sickness trying to be accepted as a fact of sickness all right that's what a symptom is now we're going to go to a certain place i'm going to show you this i'm going to cut out a whole heap of stuff there is a box full of snakes laodicea i got this in the message now i drew this up it has been sent to every believer in the message worldwide everybody has been offered it it's yours just sign here just sign for it it's offered to you sign for it and it's yours now let's see what a prophet says about that shall we watch this what if someone came up this this morning to your door an express agent that's like a courier and thrown a whole basket full of rattlesnakes and had your name on them and that's got your name on it ladies here is going to give this to you your name's on it i had your neighbor said here are they yours you know they are there what you feel symptoms of sickness you know they're there if you receive them they are yours that's right but you don't have to take them you can say i don't want them but your name's on them say i don't want them i won't have them amen that's right oh how are you feeling brother oh i've got covert it's yours the doctor said i've got cancer i've got cancer it's yours amen don't go quiet on me now come on oh he said i've got pneumonia he said i've got it i know he's educated he's been to university this guy he's got a phd in a ddt and all that sort of thing he said i've got it i've got it it's yours now god can do nothing with you amen not a thing amen because you've just signed the contract with the devil when you said i have got it you've signed a contract with the devil and how many message people have i heard say that amen message people say i've got i've got i've got now you've got it yeah god had mercy on us yes because here is not just keeping it in the disease realm it goes into the mind realm oh i don't feel like oh my i don't feel like i'm going to make it i'm not going to make it you won i feel you know a symptom is trying to make you say it's real but the thing was you picked it up and you're starting to say i've got this but throw it down amen then god can deal with the symptom amen amen the moment you say i've got it god could do nothing with you the moment you throw it down god can deal with the symptoms now here's something that happened the other day i have fellowship with some people overseas i will not identify where and who i'll pick this thing up not to get it this brother was cooking outside he had a barbecue that was like yours brother andy with all the flames coming in and he was cooking something in a stainless steel pot and the handle of the pot was accidentally over the flame coming up in this outside barbecue and he didn't know it and he didn't see that the handle had gone red hot this actually happened with witnesses so he goes and he and he's he's wanting to go and take the pot off and take out whatever's cooking in he puts his hand on it and it's red hot and it took all the skin off his hand to the bone you could see the bones in his hands now satan's watching him and saying come on say you got it say you got it this brother was a wise man he looked at those symptoms of this agony he is going through and the devil was trying to get him to agree you're wounded forever the symptom was wanting to become real to him so he said to the to the the devil you trapped me into this i'm not going to accept that jesus christ has healed me and before his eyes within 15 minutes it was in the scar on his hand [Music] amen 15 minutes there was not a scar amen he wants to keep you down to say i've got this i'm no good i've got this problem i've got that problem if that was the case i'd never be in the pulpit ever [Music] you know my testimony oh i can't speak i'm never going to be any good there's that and i had 34 years of that in my life until the lord told me got me to stop saying that i have this problem amen [Music] i agreed to a pack of symptoms in my life that wasn't even the truth and god had to shake that thing off me until i started to deny it and then god could deal with the symptoms that made me not be able to speak and he dealt with my mind he dealt with my body until now i can speak jesus that is the power of god when you start looking at your reality now watch it now the prophet says when you testify you still have your sickness the devil keeps it with you hey he keeps it you got it man say i won't have it no sir amen come now now watch then on the next paragraph he says give your faith a chance turn it loose unbridled let it work you've got it bound down with traditions traditions but the first time you testify your sickness it brings you right down to that realm again you signed for it what traditions the tradition of always listening to experts who are educated to pushing narratives amen the tradition of listening to negative comments on earthbound or calling the chipmunks in the message hey we're eagles are we we stop listening to a bunch of idiot chipmunks they're traditional being quick to say i'm sick by the way i feel i said to our church just because i got a headache don't mean to say i've got this this problem or that problem my mother-in-law gives me a headache that doesn't mean to say that i've got a disease i got a sore back i get that from getting the firewood in that don't mean to say i've got a disease amen yes amen now watch what is a symptom he says the same thing again symptom does something like say tomorrow when you go home to a place the express agent will come up say are you mrs joe yes i have a present for you all right what is it he hands over a basket and you hear something hitting in that box you look in it it's a big box of snakes rattlesnakes it's inside the box rattling i feel this i feel this i feel this this is this rattlesnake rattling is that right when you when you're feeling some pain coming over that's a rattlesnake rattling amen yeah it's a big box the rebel says well you don't want them things oh but they're yours somebody sent them to you rome sent them to you with your name on it accept these symptoms suckers now in one sense of the word via yours in another sense are not somebody sent them to you but they're not yours until you sign for them then you've received them and when you sign you receive them then they are yours the express company has to send them to the he says but if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express company the express company has to send them to the one that sent them to you is that right it goes right back to the devil is this speaking to you this morning amen well don't sign for nothing that the devil brought no said just refuse it no sir say i just haven't got it devil you take it all back that's what i won't have it refuse to have your sickness or arthritis whatever it is i just haven't got it by straight from here nothing but the truth it's the battle that we're in brothers and sisters praise the lord no it doesn't have to be a bodily disease you know we're living in this age and there's everything thrown at us you go on to google up something and there's something worrying not something and it's always these influences trying to calm upon you and it's trying to draw you in and draw you in hey if you're a normal human being it'll affect you if you look too long that's right he could be tempted to pick it up have a good look is that right a bad attitude is just a satanic symptom it's coming and you're feeling this way about a brother or sister and then and then suddenly you sign your name to that say i feel like that and i'm not changing now god can do nothing with you that's right that right then you live justifying yourself and all your actions that were once just symptoms i'm not coming to church anymore this person's done this to me i know what i'll do i'm going to justify myself i'm going to form a house group is that right that's people with an attitude problem and you sink into the world of your own self-importance right now let's turn to the book of joan i want to show you something hallelujah glory to the book of jonah chapter two we're going to finish up on this because i i can't go for five hours you know i just want to hit the high spots no no we just got to kill him quick andy [Laughter] kill him quick don't give him a long day just quick let's just deal with it now when you read the book of jonah brothers and sisters it's in the old testament is that right yes and it's a resurrection sign in the old testament that jesus comes along and fulfills that shadow form that jonah was doing in the old testament jonah was in the wales valley for three days within three days or three nights jesus comes along and he was in the grave within three days and three nights he resurrected out but then brother barum says he says that's the resurrection sign at the end time jonah is a sign for the end time making jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now remember what is the rapture cycle a shout and a voice and a trumpet is that right now jonah types the bride he's cold to be a resurrection minister to a bunch of gentiles they're right when hell is on the earth god's called this man be a resurrection ministry to gentiles and this man he's in a self preservation he's he wants to preserve himself now he's in the second part of the resurrect of the rapture cycle where god's got to get preeminences over this man and all he sees is symptoms [Music] remember god prepared a fish he says i'm going to get that man to be a resurrection ministry to nineveh those gentiles and this man is having a whole bunch of problems with his thinking and you know when you look at these types you've got to find out for yourself what is this fish that god prepared it was the god of nineveh amen is that right and here he is inside the god of nineveh and what is the god of this age hell has come up on the earth lay this here watch for verse 1 yes sir this man god's going to put him through something yes he said jonah you're looking at yourself all the time you're looking at your weaknesses your insecurities or yourself it's all about you but i've got to get preeminences over you in the second part of the rapture cycle amen and jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly watch what he says now and i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell hell has come up on the earth is that right yes amen and here he is and the second part of the rap the rapture cycle hell has come up on the earth and has caught jonah in his self-will and all he looks at is symptoms and these symptoms is having an effect on them and god must remove those symptoms and he's got to shake this man this man is in the message he has read all about solomon he has read the book of ecclesiastes where solomon says it's all vanity and vanity is a vapor that passes away hey this world out here don't you think that's real it ain't real but i tell you something many people think it is real that's right it's passing away and brother branham says and souls that are in prison hell has come up on the earth amen is that right hell has come up on the earth and guess what we have to live amongst hell and it's affecting you and affecting jonah and this man he's down under this whale's gut and man it stinks down there brethren he'll tell you something it ain't a nun too flash down there it's just the worst stink that you can ever have down there and he's down there and god's training this man to stop looking at symptoms because as long as he's looking at those symptoms god can do nothing with him if he agrees with those symptoms he says i want you to be a resurrection ministry to them gentiles and he wants you to be a resurrection ministry to those gentiles brothers and sisters where is the mercy seat in the temple hello do you go out and preach jesus christ to people do you or do you not or do you sit at home say oh i feel this is happening to me this is happening to me you're called to be a resurrection ministry amen yes do you go and talk to the one you work to work with about jesus christ and what he's doing in this day well you're seriously backslidden if you're not that's right because that's what you're here for amen is that right amen where's the last time you talk to the one that you work with about jesus christ and what he's doing in this hour he says give me the word convenient to me that was in our first opening scripture now look at this man he's going to shake this guy this this our brother down because in hebrews 12 he says i will not only shake the earth i'll shake the heavens and the earth i'm going to shake all your influence of this dna that you've been born with off of you until there's only one that remains the eternal things that's why god shakes us and shakes us and shakes us until oh the only thing left is eternal things in our thinking now watch him now i'm just doing this uh doing it on the hoof you know for you has cast me into the deep verse two three in the midst of the seas and the floods covers me about all the blows and the waves are passed over me i'm saving such a terrible time lord in this place that's called hell but you're an elected man boy hey i'm trying to get preeminences over you jonah and or as you see your symptoms come now amen and you're agreeing with them oh lord jesus then i said i'm cast out of thy sight oh my god this this guy is in a bad situation that right oh i'm cast out of thy sight i can never do any good i'm cast out of my sight preach it mother oh i've got this problem i've got that problem i've got some other problem i'm cast out i'm an incurable disease you're right oh lord jesus let's get some more gold eh amen the waters that compass me about oh i'm having such a rotten time the depth closed around me the weeds are wrapped around my head yeah that's right that's where his problem was was his head now right so watch how you got to read between the lines because he said if you've got a revelation of those thunders you can see it from genesis to revelation and every type and shadow and the bible so i want to see the rapture cycle in the book of jonah amen is that right yes i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with the bars was about me forever thou has brought up my life from corruption oh my lord when my soul fainted with within me i remembered the lord that's it he's been shaking me to get my mind off what's happening a bunch these serpent seeds out there on this earth and all their information oh i remembered the lord oh i remembered what he spoke about me i saw my name in the book i didn't see my name in grandma's book of dad's book or anything i saw my name in his book amen see he's awakening him to his true identity and the second part of the rapture cycle to be a resurrection ministry to the gentiles amen amen my prayer when i was my soul faded within me i remember the lord and my prayer came unto thee into thy holy temple what's he looking at now his reality he's looking to the temple i'm not looking to my problems i'm looking to what god has made amen is that right amen they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy i've got this i'm no good i've held onto this you're forsaking your own mercy is that right amen oh my kids can never be saved thou this and this and this i've signed to the devil they can never come in you have forsaken your own mercy to your kids hey i don't care what the kids look like amen don't ever take your don't ever take away your prayers from your kids and say that they are lost cause nothing's a lost cause when the bride of christ speaks amen [Music] that's right but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving halloween oh lord thank you for making me the way that you've made me you know i'm no longer going to be con concerning myself with myself amen i'm going to look to what you have made me i'm going to see myself as you see me i am a temple of the holy ghost i am the mercy seat of god i do not care for the circumstances i'm looking at the promises and when i look at the promises of god even the hand will come back and be completely healed is that right yes we'll finish up on this hallelujah hallelujah did you know jesus said to your two ladies here i'll spew you out of my mouth but the whale said to jonah i've had enough of you boy the biggest chunder the world has ever seen he was down the only hood he was making the whale expel him i'm trying to be nice now you know ladasia cannot stand somebody who knows who they are that's right it will literally spew you out and i say praise god amen now brother talked about two little birds i'll finish on this i'll read it out to you somewhere away at the end i could be doing this for a long time because i said this is a five hour sermon we'll just go to the end my goodness me you should be thanking jesus that this is not lost my my my mind's about 150 slides my biggest one's 360. all right now it's quite an amazing thing now brother brahms speaks about two birds a robin and a nightingale two birds innocent little birds so that's why it's a story you watch every morning we get up grouchy and get out well i'm just about half asleep and so forth he says no wonder we've got high blood pressure diabetes and everything else you get out of bed grumpy is that right no brother that just doesn't happen oh my god he says look at that little robin to say is where he had to speak to me i tell you he will raise up other morning and the first thing throw his little head face upwards to the heavens and go singing at the top of his voice you never seen any sign of them with high blood pressure walking on crutches and diabetes and he says said a little robin said one time well or wonder what's the matter and creatures call themselves human beings said why they must be so sad maybe they haven't got a heavenly father like we've got that takes care of us see here's a prophet he's looking at nature and he sees a robin yeah and his robbers looking human beings look at they say they don't even know god like i know god i didn't have to worry and get diabetes and crutches god's looking after me but where were these funny creatures see where the sickness and that come from comes from attitude problems heart problems some attitude problems diabetes and grouchiness and that's where these things come from then he talks about another bird the nightingale one night holding a meeting in mill town baptist church when i was a little past at the pastor danny i was home with an old friend of mine to stay all night and i used to notice when i passed by there'd be a nightingale sitting on a cedar bush there all night long he would sing at the top of his voice remember this is at night now not even in the daytime in nightingale just as loud as he could sing how well i could understand why them birds sing when it's daylight i can imagine the sunlight bathing on them makes them sing but what makes the nightingale sing because he's not singing in the daytime he's singing at night and so i got me a book so brethren's reading up on this nightingale i come to find out that the knight and guy what what makes him sing that he watches the skies and every time that he can look to the sea the clouds begin to move back and see one star one ray of light he begins to scream hallelujah and sing to the top of his voice because he knows the suns are shining somewhere he's speaking to the earth that the suns are shining somewhere so this animal kingdom a prophet has to use nature to show us what his expectation is from you and what do we do we get up in the morning grouchy and gut-shaking about this and everything else like this and money problems and all this sort of things he says well actually you're not following what a prophet said because that's why you're sick and just have this problem and this problem and this problem and rome comes and flooding you out with psychology and you have to have this and have to have this or you'll catch this or you'll catch that it's garbage amen amen it's pure garbage how do you get what i feel like i ain't going to go and sign my name to anything that comes from the devil amen i might get tempted with this and tempted with that and when the temptation comes i throw it down then god can deal with the symptoms are you with me now let's stand to our feet i've kept it i've kept honest now it's not five hours could the musicians come forth please now i'll tell you something i took a meeting in russia that was 12 hours long so don't complain five hours preaching seven hours worship wow take me there twelve long hours and you couldn't get them out of the church what's what's western technology done to us you know oh man honestly you just couldn't get them out now it went from midday to after midnight to end the following day amen they want to go home this is the kind of god may that be our portion what's a nice song there's a song so it's brother onion's birthday today and there's a song i would sing about the birthday but the first one that came to my mind is that church is moving on so we're gonna do that one instead of happy birthday we're gonna do this can you bring that one up do you know this one it's real wee all night bro

the heavens rule all things and nothing can happen to god's elect if as long as she stays connected with what he has spoken of her and lord esther he even had to look at her reality not as the orphan
