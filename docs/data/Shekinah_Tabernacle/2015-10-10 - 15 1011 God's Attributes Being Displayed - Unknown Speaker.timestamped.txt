[30:59] offices in greater and greater numbers
[31:02] Latin America during the 1940s and 1950s
[31:06] while Senator McCarthy was investigating
[31:09] the communist influence in America the
[31:12] Reverend buddy Graham is on record as
[31:15] saying and this was Polly Grail feed of
[31:21] communism must die or call Christianity
[31:24] must I cry because it is actually a
[31:29] battle between Christ and antichrists oh
[31:31] so very grave identified communism is
[31:35] the Antichrist
[31:37] while body Graham was telling the
[31:39] American public communism was the
[31:41] greatest 3 william branham understood
[31:45] the real trip came from the purple
[31:47] curtain rod of Catholicism that would
[31:50] work too deep denigrate the power of God
[31:54] in the American people
[31:58] the Reverend Graham dubbed the past in

[32:18] he said what are four copies
[32:21] mr. Harding and for years for years
[32:23] we've been reading this but this was the
[32:25] quote
[32:26] it's easier this comes from the
[32:28] histories of the bride trinkets brother
[32:30] branham frites in April 32
[32:33] he says here and I'm obviously says it
[32:35] in a few places
[32:37] there's an Iron Curtain there's a bamboo
[32:40] curtain
[32:42] obviously understand I include the
[32:44] communism
[32:46] China take over the world so brother
[32:49] Branham is making there's an Iron
[32:50] Curtain there's a bamboo curtain
[32:53] purple curtains brother branham this is
[32:56] your brother don't you fear none of the
[32:59] rest of them but what's that purple

[56:41] so what
[56:57] 24
[57:00] I
[57:14] adopt her eyes and we saw Isaac he
[57:17] lighted off the camels for she and set
[57:19] out to the server what madness
[57:22] and the superintendent is my master
[57:25] therefore she took a veil and covered in
[57:27] milk and now we just want to go to
[57:30] Hebrews chapter to us
[57:34] through our water conference and
[57:38] so some of us may be but familiar to
[57:42] those who are here but I want to expand
[57:44] it's a Hebrews chapter to Murray from
[57:47] 18
[57:50] for as much then as the children are
[57:52] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[57:55] himself likewise took part of the same
[57:57] that through death he might destroy him
[57:59] that had the power of death that is the
[58:01] devil and deliver them who through fear
[58:05] of death for all their lifetime subject
[58:07] to bondage for belly he took not on in
[58:09] the nature of ain't took train for
[58:11] barely he took not on him the nature of
[58:14] angels but he took on him the seed of
[58:15] Abraham we're for all things that /
[58:18] heard them we made like under his
[58:20] rhetoric that he might be a merciful and
[58:23] faithful high priest of the things
[58:24] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[58:26] for the citizens of people well in that
[58:28] he himself has have suffered being kept
[58:31] it he is able to to secure them that are
[58:35] tempted as to help to able to relieve
[58:38] I mean my love is
[58:42] it's an L you know I'm balika know what
[58:47] I feel like I'm kind of going out into
[58:51] something that's being kind of it like
[58:54] it's a deep waters you know but uh you
[58:57] know I just trust a little put it all
[58:58] together yeah I just mean pondering a
[59:01] few things enough trust a little just
[59:04] over it up yeah we understand it
[59:06] Ecclesiastes 3 is it yes to everything
[59:09] there is a season into a time to every
[59:11] purpose under heaven so there's a
[59:13] there's a purpose for everything in life
[59:15] is a season forward as well and then the
[59:18] prophet Isaiah would say in chapter 55
[59:20] and verses 10 11 as his froze the rain
[59:22] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[59:24] return if not Heather but water if the
[59:27] earth and make root makers that bring
[59:28] forth and bud that it may give see to
[59:31] the sower and bread to the eater so
[59:33] shall my word that goes forth out of my
[59:36] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[59:38] but it shall accomplish that which I
[59:40] please and it shall prosper and the
[59:42] thing we're into I i sent it so gotta
[59:45] say that a season now when he sends his
[59:48] word upon the earth there is an intent
[59:50] that he has to send that work he has
[59:52] something in his mind that he wants to
[59:54] see expressed and it's a particular
[59:56] season you know the word that we have
[59:59] received mistake is not the same as
[1:00:01] though was work no your God told Noah
[1:00:04] I'm going to flood the earth build an
[1:00:06] ark and he told him exactly what to do
[1:00:07] that was the word for Noah's day and
[1:00:09] then brother bran brings out very simply
[1:00:11] Moses could not have come with noise
[1:00:13] message that would not have worked on
[1:00:15] that day he came in use
[1:00:17] all they've got to be expressible season
[1:00:19] and then you know as the prophets came
[1:00:21] down you know Elijah Malcolm all these
[1:00:24] things they had to bring a fresh part of
[1:00:26] the work and we see John the Baptist as
[1:00:28] well he could not um come with Moses
[1:00:30] message he had to come he was here to
[1:00:32] prepare the way the law says God was
[1:00:34] revealing as weren't down through the
[1:00:36] ages it was season a season to fulfill a
[1:00:38] particular thing yeah and we can see the
[1:00:41] same thing now in this day that god has
[1:00:43] sent a word of the state to do a certain
[1:00:45] thing and it's not just to call the
[1:00:48] people out of denomination and say all
[1:00:50] this is the this is the mark of the
[1:00:51] beast you must come out as more than
[1:00:53] just that but it's too as to bring us
[1:00:55] into a real union with Christ I mean
[1:00:58] that God would be revealed as leash
[1:01:00] again but in his bride that is the
[1:01:02] purposes message has been sent to us and
[1:01:05] so because we understand you and this is
[1:01:07] important that I that I really love from
[1:01:10] from prices of mystery of God revealed
[1:01:12] he says now he had this threefold
[1:01:15] purpose we want to find out what is this
[1:01:18] threefold purpose the first thing was
[1:01:21] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:01:23] people he couldn't do it as a great
[1:01:26] Jehovah God who covered all space time
[1:01:29] and eternity he could not he's too great
[1:01:32] to ever be revealed to people because it
[1:01:34] would be too mysterious how could that
[1:01:37] great being that never did begin that
[1:01:40] after you went beyond the cycle of a
[1:01:42] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:01:45] trillions of years of light space and on
[1:01:49] out into the infinite and to the
[1:01:51] eternity and a great creature that was
[1:01:55] and still is how can how can man fathom
[1:01:58] such a great big being that is our
[1:02:00] eternal God but what he wanted to do he
[1:02:03] loved fatherhood for he was a father and
[1:02:07] the only way he could express it was too
[1:02:10] I'm a son of man so that's the reason
[1:02:13] Jesus kept saying son of man see they
[1:02:16] didn't know what he was talking about
[1:02:18] many of them but now you get it he
[1:02:20] wanted to express himself that was his
[1:02:22] one of his great victory for purposes
[1:02:25] was to express himself identify himself
[1:02:27] with human beings to reveal herself in
[1:02:30] Christ secondly to have preeminence and
[1:02:33] his body of believers that is his pride
[1:02:35] that he might live in people now he
[1:02:38] could he could do that in adam and eve
[1:02:40] but since separated them so now there
[1:02:43] had to be some way to get it back again
[1:02:45] oh my this is rich to me justjust even
[1:02:48] to think of it and see see what god's
[1:02:49] purpose was now why didn't he just keep
[1:02:54] Adam and Eve like that before the fall
[1:02:56] then he would never been able to express
[1:02:59] his fullness his full attribute he could
[1:03:04] have been see he could have been a
[1:03:06] father there that's true but he's also a
[1:03:08] savior you say how do you know he was
[1:03:10] cuz I've had the experience see he's a
[1:03:14] savior and he had to express that and
[1:03:16] how could he do that only through Christ
[1:03:18] how could he be how could he be a son
[1:03:22] only through Christ how can he be a
[1:03:24] healer only through Christ see all
[1:03:26] things are wound up and that one person
[1:03:28] Jesus Christ and then he says when I
[1:03:31] think of that I just said denominations
[1:03:33] pass off the scene everything else just
[1:03:34] go when I see God's great purpose
[1:03:37] revealing himself first to reveal
[1:03:39] himself in Christ the fullness of the
[1:03:41] Godhead bodily and then to bring that
[1:03:43] fullness of Godhead bodily into a people
[1:03:46] that he could have the preeminence a--'s
[1:03:48] the oversight the leading so God you
[1:03:52] know is God wants to express themselves
[1:03:54] this is operation
[1:03:56] is he made this whole world and put you
[1:03:59] up on the school that he could reveal
[1:04:01] himself to you he's determined to have a
[1:04:03] relationship with a people yeah he's
[1:04:05] determined to express himself enter
[1:04:07] people but the only way that God
[1:04:10] bestowed on had all these attributes of
[1:04:12] himself to be healer and a savior and
[1:04:14] redeemer and a father and you know a
[1:04:16] counselor to God and all these things
[1:04:18] with him and he wanted to express them
[1:04:20] down to his children but the only way he
[1:04:22] could fully Express them as when they
[1:04:24] put on flesh and we can see this now
[1:04:27] where you know in the old testament
[1:04:30] where where Moses was you know he was
[1:04:33] commissioned you know you're the agile
[1:04:35] Lord came down the burning bush
[1:04:36] commissioner to take the people out of
[1:04:38] you know out of Egypt then and God would
[1:04:41] begin to display his attributes and that
[1:04:43] journey into the Promised Land you know
[1:04:45] they had the brains of server that they
[1:04:47] raised up in jesus said as that server
[1:04:49] was lifted up as Moses looked out the
[1:04:51] sermon so I will be lifted up because in
[1:04:53] their work divine healing and he was a
[1:04:55] sort of divine healing and then he was
[1:04:57] you know he you know of you with your
[1:04:59] they would say to him you're our fathers
[1:05:01] a manner and the wilderness he says I am
[1:05:03] that bread iron that matter you know
[1:05:06] idiot say you know and in Paul would
[1:05:08] Paul would identify the smith rock that
[1:05:11] they drank from of the wellness was
[1:05:12] Christ so all these so now attributes of
[1:05:15] God being displayed through these things
[1:05:17] but they could have displayed fully now
[1:05:20] what God wanted to express so for
[1:05:22] example the blood of bulls of God's you
[1:05:24] know redemption by blood that was that
[1:05:27] was a part
[1:05:27] cause attribute to be a redeemer but I
[1:05:29] can only cover the ascent in that form
[1:05:31] it had to but we didn't put on flesh now
[1:05:33] and put a whole new dimension and
[1:05:36] they're just cover the people since been
[1:05:38] annihilated this a minute mile andaman
[1:05:41] brother bran tells us at descent now
[1:05:43] goes through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:45] and it goes on the head of the accuser I
[1:05:47] mean then he's going to take it to the
[1:05:48] judgment I mean then he's going to take
[1:05:50] it to the lake of fire I mean to your
[1:05:52] sin that you repeated over 30 min York I
[1:05:54] was even blogged you must be transferred
[1:05:57] and then on to the head of the accuser
[1:05:59] hallelujah so now you're all these
[1:06:01] things they had to be you know they had
[1:06:04] to be expressed that a man before your
[1:06:08] father name Amen and then even the same
[1:06:10] thing now where we're at your Nexus 23
[1:06:14] now because he's expressed as a guide
[1:06:17] there as well he says behold i'll send
[1:06:19] an angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:06:21] way and to bring them into the place
[1:06:23] which i have prepared and so that was
[1:06:26] just that was just an earthly journey
[1:06:27] from Egypt a new you know you know at
[1:06:29] the Palestine but then when he when he
[1:06:32] with that same angel put on flesh
[1:06:34] because that same God that thin them out
[1:06:36] of Egypt now you know our people he was
[1:06:38] he was Jesus Christ in a different form
[1:06:41] I'm indeed change for me put on flesh
[1:06:43] and then so now Jesus would say in John
[1:06:47] 14 I go to prepare a place for you there
[1:06:49] were I and II shall be also this is all
[1:06:51] the leave you comfortless I will come to
[1:06:53] you amen and he sees when the spirit of
[1:06:57] truth has come John would say he will
[1:06:59] lead to guide you into all truth sure
[1:07:01] there's a guy job they had a guide in a
[1:07:03] pot but it was
[1:07:05] was it was Yankee Lord wait before them
[1:07:07] but now that same angel comes as well to
[1:07:09] this church and then God is on the
[1:07:11] inside amen
[1:07:15] it's a whole whole different dimension
[1:07:17] to it where we once it was God above him
[1:07:22] you know God was still separated even
[1:07:25] though he he was at F&N who live and he
[1:07:27] could well with his people you know I've
[1:07:29] not anymore could go to the holy place
[1:07:31] not even go to the Holy of Holies you
[1:07:33] know it was dead too that's the mountain
[1:07:36] when God can be on Mount Sinai but now
[1:07:38] through the blood of jesus christ is
[1:07:40] dead dr. garden to the prison the
[1:07:42] Prophet tells us what time it was dead
[1:07:44] too to go one now did not to go it he
[1:07:48] must dip into the Prince of God another
[1:07:50] life and that same life that was there
[1:07:52] now comes into you and then he begins to
[1:07:54] him individually guide you in the way he
[1:07:58] say well what is that way the way is the
[1:08:00] work and the angel Lorde now will keep
[1:08:03] us in the work I mean that we won't your
[1:08:05] we may be things my influence we may go
[1:08:08] sideways a little bit but there will be
[1:08:10] it yeah that guy to lick it up maybe
[1:08:13] that's why you must know him personally
[1:08:15] because otherwise human human influence
[1:08:17] comes long different things come along
[1:08:19] and you know you can get sidetracked and
[1:08:21] push left and right amen and we can all
[1:08:24] be subject to that allows it i think
[1:08:26] last other Peter Peter came under human
[1:08:28] of look you know when the Jews came in
[1:08:31] and they tried to enjoy any separated
[1:08:32] himself it wouldn't eat with the
[1:08:34] Gentiles anymore as human influence
[1:08:36] coming in maybe but because they glide
[1:08:38] was on the inside of him now Emma
[1:08:40] sometimes what God to speak from the
[1:08:42] heavens sometimes he does but many times
[1:08:45] it'll be a part of his body come along
[1:08:47] amen I mean m3 you know brother Brennan
[1:08:50] he would he would you know
[1:08:53] 1111 sermon what message you know he
[1:08:56] quotes revelations 3 as videos i love by
[1:08:58] your rebuke and chasten he says you're
[1:09:01] receiving you're chasing you rebuke now
[1:09:02] and he's preaching you know some people
[1:09:04] think we gotta open the heavens and put
[1:09:06] a finger on something he comes a little
[1:09:08] man from Kentucky he opens the word as
[1:09:11] the prophet of the AG begin to speak
[1:09:13] some things and his Creek God is using
[1:09:14] that instrument to correct the people i
[1:09:16] mean because the Prophet can see far
[1:09:19] more than what we can see a menu say
[1:09:22] there was he say that was that was
[1:09:24] preached 50 years ago does the wood for
[1:09:26] the eight and then and in their word now
[1:09:28] God God will keep us in that work
[1:09:31] because the message is if your
[1:09:34] interpretation of this is not a
[1:09:36] different book not everything that's
[1:09:37] just this interpreter yeah I mean that
[1:09:40] light as one is now shone upon the work
[1:09:42] that we can really see you know we know
[1:09:46] God is one now how a manifest himself
[1:09:47] you know how you know we can see what
[1:09:51] the word really means is it's not just
[1:09:53] smoke and mirrors and patterns and add
[1:09:56] stories but it been young you know it's
[1:09:58] a living thing it was God himself and so
[1:10:02] now he would so it's just like you're
[1:10:04] one of the Old Testament prophets yours
[1:10:06] written in there watchman what are the
[1:10:08] night and God sets watchman above us
[1:10:11] here to Jabbar's people i meant they're
[1:10:13] still part of the body but God places
[1:10:16] them up in a certain office they can see
[1:10:19] more than what we can see and in so i
[1:10:21] watch minh up an attack and identify
[1:10:23] what's what your what's out there and a
[1:10:26] watchman is normally training they got
[1:10:27] keen eyesight don't want to put a blind
[1:10:29] man up in a tower and then you will have
[1:10:32] somebody's got twenty-twenty mission and
[1:10:34] they can pick things yo
[1:10:35] the enemy tries to sneak it you know and
[1:10:38] then did you pick someone that can
[1:10:40] identify things that are moving right
[1:10:42] amen so just like a problem we can look
[1:10:45] at something say what so you know just
[1:10:47] like how you know brother dining brought
[1:10:49] out that quote with Kennedy coming in
[1:10:51] today you know your ears available
[1:10:52] system come in there and through you
[1:10:54] know to America many men would have
[1:10:55] looked at that and then they say what's
[1:10:57] so bad about that it's a good man but
[1:10:59] the Prophet being up there having the
[1:11:00] keen eyesight now he could identify the
[1:11:03] spirits that we're working and then he
[1:11:05] can warn us about it that we can see it
[1:11:07] now it's comes with maturity amen so
[1:11:10] that's why now you know that's why you
[1:11:13] say well you know that's what God gotta
[1:11:15] send his angel in this day I'm talking
[1:11:18] about the one that was reflecting
[1:11:20] through the prophet amen yeah the very
[1:11:22] god of glory I can't reveal themselves
[1:11:24] through man answer that but that same
[1:11:27] Angeles still watching over us would
[1:11:29] what you got repeat like I had that then
[1:11:32] he would keep us in the way until we use
[1:11:34] the places prepared for us oh yeah well
[1:11:37] what is that place I've been glory at
[1:11:38] the wedding stuff but that place is
[1:11:39] prepared for us I mean we ever we have a
[1:11:42] body I mean that isn't comfortable if
[1:11:45] this earthly Tabernacle meters all we
[1:11:47] have one body way to go really bad maybe
[1:11:49] you can step into their body but now we
[1:11:50] have to be kept in the way yeah because
[1:11:52] we're you know we have these five senses
[1:11:55] we have our emotions you know where we
[1:11:57] are we're eternal beings for in the
[1:11:59] spine our body or go I met any time if
[1:12:02] we look at things you know we look at
[1:12:04] these things and we look at this world
[1:12:05] through our five senses now it will be
[1:12:07] swayed by things even and even if we
[1:12:10] look at through the sixties which is
[1:12:11] fight amen I mean we can look at the
[1:12:13] world of real identify what's going on
[1:12:16] maybe so we must be very careful only
[1:12:20] looking things and look at your brother
[1:12:22] brown can see things going on and you
[1:12:24] can see you know you know this the
[1:12:27] brother ground meat you know you know he
[1:12:29] would add another preview of the bride
[1:12:30] okay and he saw you know he go back into
[1:12:34] the other day you know the you know how
[1:12:38] could I frontier abounded he was he was
[1:12:40] raised at the clinic off in the 50s and
[1:12:42] 60 he was 11 years old sitting in
[1:12:46] sitting in those treat for meetings of
[1:12:48] 1965 and he was he was 11 years old and
[1:12:52] he was sitting on the USC because here
[1:12:54] was a prophet standing there relating
[1:12:56] Sydney jackson street the Angels new
[1:12:58] glory of God coming through the window
[1:13:00] università delivered he was looking for
[1:13:03] things to happen and he said he didn't
[1:13:05] go and so it came with an expectation
[1:13:07] and and that expectation was bent and
[1:13:10] then what it he saw out there he-man is
[1:13:13] 11 years old and you never be true God
[1:13:15] what your expectation us amen no I did
[1:13:19] those go in those days now part of the
[1:13:22] Pentecostal move was the liberation of
[1:13:24] the woman you see there's whole family
[1:13:26] was split some some states up the Bible
[1:13:29] way it seemed a bit of carrot dress for
[1:13:32] the using its right then the others with
[1:13:34] the liberal weapons right and in and
[1:13:36] those they can tell it's a zebra mall he
[1:13:39] visited a yes but then a problem can
[1:13:41] look at that
[1:13:42] say this is where it's going to go you
[1:13:43] man yeah because the promo ratings are
[1:13:45] deceitful yeah you understand yeah and
[1:13:48] then so he sees a season a sequel we may
[1:13:51] look at it say it's just a scene you
[1:13:53] know it's like you find some some some
[1:13:55] wheat that just gross yo covers your
[1:13:58] entire garden someone say don't plug
[1:14:00] that scene and say whatever some week
[1:14:03] and you say no it just looks like I want
[1:14:06] this on our roads or whatever do they
[1:14:08] look exactly the same we would be out of
[1:14:11] identify here we can look at that scene
[1:14:14] and say this is what is going to grow
[1:14:16] into you should that's why that's why
[1:14:18] the message is this Bible amen maybe the
[1:14:21] messages vital content that were now God
[1:14:24] has revealed on us work the way we
[1:14:26] should walk here amen you know we're not
[1:14:29] here I'll be thinking about you we're
[1:14:32] not here haphazard this is not a
[1:14:34] gathering this is not together your
[1:14:35] people are closed or what my family goes
[1:14:38] here or the people love me and I feel
[1:14:40] love here this is nice as walk out you
[1:14:42] know sure that you're part of an LLC
[1:14:44] part of it here and then we're elected
[1:14:47] group of people that God has gathered
[1:14:49] you know and there's a purpose that we
[1:14:51] are even sitting here you know there's a
[1:14:54] purpose that we have our families here
[1:14:56] is a purpose that we are here and we
[1:14:58] must identify God why do you place me in
[1:15:01] this place yes they will i'm jung yong
[1:15:04] i'm just raced here God placed you here
[1:15:05] for a purpose I've moved you here for a
[1:15:08] purplish unit and if we could identify
[1:15:10] that purpose then we can walk at what
[1:15:12] God has for us hey take Joseph you take
[1:15:15] Joseph he had the trendy good help
[1:15:17] having drinks yesterday they could help
[1:15:19] him spiritual he just had a couple of
[1:15:21] dreams but it so angered an assault that
[1:15:24] every you
[1:15:25] every step of his life that was that was
[1:15:27] always in front of them amen brother BAM
[1:15:31] says and the church age book just I'm
[1:15:34] probably jumping well ahead of myself
[1:15:35] but I'm not too worried about it he says
[1:15:38] he says no unless we suffer with him we
[1:15:42] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[1:15:45] to rain the reason for this is that
[1:15:47] character simply is never made without
[1:15:49] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:15:52] gift a man without character can't rain
[1:15:55] because power apartment character is
[1:15:57] satanic but power with character is fit
[1:16:00] to rule and since he wants us to share
[1:16:03] even as thrown on the same basis that he
[1:16:05] overcame and a sit down in his Father's
[1:16:07] throne then we have to overcome and sit
[1:16:10] with him and the little temporary
[1:16:11] suffering we go through now is not
[1:16:13] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:16:15] glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:16:18] he comes Oh what treasures are laid up
[1:16:19] for those that are willing to eat into
[1:16:22] his kingdom through much tribulation and
[1:16:24] you take you know because God has the
[1:16:27] white attributes that he wanted to
[1:16:29] express and we are part of those
[1:16:31] attributes amen this is a certain
[1:16:35] portion of God that he wants to display
[1:16:36] in you the event amen that's why that's
[1:16:39] why our duties you know we could
[1:16:42] identify that we have the same spirit of
[1:16:43] god in US but God will take us through
[1:16:45] through down different roads because he
[1:16:47] wants to express different things amen
[1:16:50] and if we don't understand what we're
[1:16:52] called to do then we'll begin to walk
[1:16:54] down the road and saying why am I going
[1:16:56] down this road right amen but God be pre
[1:17:01] pre would by God yes we are his
[1:17:03] attributes manifested upon the earth he
[1:17:06] knew exactly where you'd be sitting
[1:17:07] today he knew what close you'd be
[1:17:09] wearing he knew what breakfast you'd
[1:17:11] have
[1:17:12] men he knew we would be living just now
[1:17:14] he knows every you know if the Prophet
[1:17:16] could say that God Lord it every flea
[1:17:18] that with better side how much Tala
[1:17:19] would make Lord amen it say if he knows
[1:17:22] all the minor details of every part of
[1:17:25] every creature that ever been existence
[1:17:27] he knows like your life amen and he's
[1:17:30] ordained he's all day MacArthur we must
[1:17:32] walk yes amen but a week and we just
[1:17:35] look at the path for walking we can lose
[1:17:37] focus on while we're walking the path
[1:17:39] amen you know we have to we have to look
[1:17:43] at the end goal you know Joseph Joseph
[1:17:46] knew because he knew that was God
[1:17:49] speaking to him and God's work cannot
[1:17:51] fail and must it must come at the
[1:17:54] manifestation it must be come upon the
[1:17:56] earth you know it must be looked out and
[1:17:59] so on he understood that one day one day
[1:18:01] his brothers are get about her yes amen
[1:18:04] but then the details of how was going to
[1:18:06] come about he didn't know you were an
[1:18:08] internal you know you would think now so
[1:18:11] no doubt in his mind Yaser so it's given
[1:18:14] that robe you're the coat of many colors

[1:18:18] rainbow covenant there for you because
