announcement so debbie is being re-baptized after service today amen praise the lord amen so we will have that directly after about half an hour after service um down at the original you know at our spot there i'll put a pin on the on on whatsapp um let's go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to genesis chapter 39 and verse 1. and we're going to read verses 1 to 6. and we have it there okay amen how's everyone today amen praise the lord amen says and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer an officer of pharaoh the captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hand of the ishmaelites which had brought him down hither and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and joseph found grace in his sight and served him and made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for joseph's sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in his house and in the field and he left all that he had in joseph's hand and he he knew not ought he had saved the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favored amen what a testimony to have wouldn't you like that kind of testimony amen let's uh bow heads in a word of prayer this morning gracious father as we approach your great presence this morning we just want to come with thanksgiving in our hearts knowing that it's it's you that have ordained us to come into your presence oh god as as you said in the days of your flesh to your disciples that they did not choose you but you chose them and i want to thank you you have chosen us lord you have called us and also i want to thank you lord you said whomsoever will let him come so lord we come to you this morning father just want to pray lord you just cover us in your blood may you forgive us of all of our sins and our wrongs may you just make us more like you i pray fathers who just read your sacred word i ask once again that you being the great author may you come stand here lord and not just stand here and speak but may you sit in every pure lord and listen lord may you speak may anoint speaker and hear it one more time lord we need you to quicken your word to our hearts lord we need you to come and make it live we have not come to a lecture theater lord we haven't come to some classroom lord lord of some hall of learning but we've come oh god to the house of god into your presence you'd mold us and shape us into your image more and more so father i just pray come and take our lives and make them thine lord in a greater measure today oh god take all of our lives all that we are just want to ask lord that your blessing would be upon all those who are watching as well those who may be a second body you couldn't come lord may you anoint them lord may you just touch their lives as well we just want to commit the service into your hands lord for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i want to speak about living a rugged everyday christian life christianity is not just the mountaintop experiences it's not just the camp experiences or the special meeting experiences or even the prayer meeting experience it is an everyday rugged life now joseph like all the believers in the bible that were down through the ages you know if you read his life all we read is is the highlights of his life you know he was uh 30 years old when he when he was exalted to the throne of pharaoh he was 17 when he was sold into slavery there was 13 years of of of being in prison or serving potiphar or you know different ups and downs but you know those things weren't recorded you know you know we just we just get the highlights there's a lot of time a lot of no doubt monotony that is glossed over but it's really in the monotonous times of life really defines who we are it's not just the highlight you know anyone can shout on the prince of god brother brown when he saw the you know when he was trying to work out he you know he couldn't you know after he was at that mishawaka meetings and there were the two men and both had you know tongues interpretation and you know he went and spoke to them one was a genuine christian the other one was a hypocrite and he just couldn't work this out and he was praying and god would you know god would open his bible and show them about the wheat and the tears and the you know the just and the unjust how the rain falls on the just and the unjust and the you know the rain falls on the wheat and the tears and they both grow by the same rain and you know and you're saying that yeah that those plants were representing people claiming to be christians that the wheat and the tears shout in the presence of the rain they shout in the prince of god you know i heard one preacher say years ago you know if you're a tear at least be a bible tear leash out you know but but you know i don't believe i'm looking at tears this morning but what i'm saying is that it's very easy to rejoice in camp it's very easy to be i'm a christian and be overcoming and you know it's like the every devil's under your feet and you're about to step into a rapture and you know god's moving in a powerful way it's easy to rejoice and shout in those moments and we need those moments we need god to come and stir the waters we need us we need him to touch us and change us and have those moments of you know when god comes down and maybe things we've been carrying for many years or months or weeks they get broken off our lives you know we need those moments we need those moments so i'm not in no way i'm just i'm not disqualifying those things i hate a powerless dead religion god does too i'm not here to go through some formality i'm not here just to fill time on a sunday morning i mean but we're here to be in the presence of god that god would supernaturally change us remember and see that the dynamics of the end time church will be a refilling of the holy ghost so there i'm in no way discounting those things maybe i lean too much on that side but i think that's a good way to lean amen because you just let god work and he'll put us in our position he'll bring the church order he'll do what he needs to do let him do the job remember we are his workmanship we're not our own this is not us trying to conform to the message our own humanity man has tried that churches have tried that they have miserably failed and we don't want to fail we want to we want to let god take control and take over our lives but what we need is a is a genuine experience that makes our everyday life different amen that's and i'm not saying we don't have that but uh but we need that brother i'm says in a hidden life in christ and the reason we're not getting anywhere today is because we've got too many dry eyed professions in church joinings lukewarm backslidden church members that's the truth we need more of the old-fashioned godsend saint paul's revival in the bible holy ghost power amen and breaking up to make people act different look different walk different talk different and be different and live different in their everyday life because remember christianity is not from a 10 to a 12 on a sunday and a wednesday from a 7 30 to 9 30 whatever time we have that's not christianity actually i'd say this is the lesser part of christianity christianity is an everyday rugged life where you're the same i trust you're the same here as you are in your work workplace or at school or at home you're the same person you're the same kind of christian everywhere you go jesus was the same on the on the sea of galilee as he was on mount transfiguration as he was in jerusalem as he was in nazareth he was the same kind of jesus he wasn't a different jesus he did not change his behavior how he you know what he did he didn't pull shady deals by himself you know when no one was around no one's sure so you know he didn't take shortcuts he was the same lord jesus everywhere he was amen and if he you know if if if he is the second adam and brother ram says that the identified masterpiece of god he's the first part of that masterpiece but the bride is the second even she's that part of that masterpiece and we're actually one should we not have the same kind of life because remember brother brahms i mean jesus said when the vine ever puts forth another branch it will produce the fruit right right ye are the branches and he's the vine now brother brahm says that denomination has been grafted in right so if you look you can actually see a piece where there's actually a graft line but brother ram says if the holy ghost ever puts forth another another branch it'll write another book of acts behind it so it's not a grafting of a different life or a different tree that's now living off the life of the vine it's that same vine putting forth a branch i mean so so the real believer is not grafted in we are part of the vine you can't see the differentiation between the vine and the branch the same life the same dna the same bark on the outside everything you can't see where it changes because the same who's ever seen grafting yeah my friend had an orchard this is back in gisborne they had a sheep farm and cattle but they had orchards in the valley and we did some grafting and you could see you could see where it you know but with the bride there's no grass mark because we're not grafted we're the same life the same life so if he was the same wherever he went we should be the same wherever we go amen because it's a rugged everyday life now it astounds me that we live in the greatest i'll say the greatest easiest country to live in brotherhood says there's a curse in soft living there's actually a curse in it but it's amazing that we have every tool to live a an easy life you know but yet people and but the problem with it is that it doesn't give a resolve it doesn't give a determination as i said the last time i was in png we went around the city dumping garoka and we got some firewood and these people they're not paid by the dump but they're they're looking for aluminium cans to to sell to get money to exist it's not a hobby it's this is their daily bread and they're not there moping around saying well it was me i hate my life and life is hard and poor me no they're happy they you know you drive past the market if i could dig up the video i could show you and they're waving how are you how are you doing good to see you they're happy people but but if you put a kiwi up in that kind of condition you put someone a kiwi up in the silver stream dump oh boy life is over life is horrible people are the same but it's the spirit upon them and it's their outlook that's different so now to me those kind of people are rugged people they are you know sure they may be in the bottom of the pile but they're not worried life's worth living life is worth it every day is important amen but you know we so we don't want to get conditioned by the soft living of this of this country now i'm not saying you have to go live in a shack to be a rugged christian no no we could be rugged christians you could be in the i don't know what the biggest houses fanciest house in new zealand is you could live in it you could be born in it live in it and be a rugged christian so it's not based on your circumstance and your and how many zeros you have in your bank and whatever no no no it's it's we should live a rugged life the holy ghost makes us rugged right he makes us rugged you know he doesn't make us a uh you know just a jellyfish you know we're not jellyfish we have backbone we have resolve the holy ghost has resolved right and he wants us to to to be a rugged kind of christian you know being a rugged christian means you can take some knocks and get back up you know you can you can actually weather some misunderstanding you can actually weather some even a falling out your brother ram says about the branhams he said they used to fight in the backyard all amongst one another but if someone else came in the front yard and started fighting they all gathered because i remember hey where where the same blood we're the same family sure i may not be able to stand my brother but hey if someone comes against him i'm on his side i mean and that's how we should be as believers sure we can fight in the backyard all we want but when the enemy comes when the enemy comes amen we're all united people amen united under one head hallelujah amen that's how we should be rugged christians amen so joseph now he had many days of monotony many days his life how did he find grace we we read there and um uh so i'm just trying to find it here where he found grace in the sight of potiphar we did we did read it verse 4 there in 39 he found grace now how did he find grace and part of his sight it wasn't that powerful or super spiritual and he just realized oh god's called him and he's gonna he's gonna save egypt he's gonna save my life one day and he's gonna gather his brethren and this is god's great plan and and christ is being revealed through the life of joseph he's a perfect type of christ no no he didn't have that kind of understanding but he saw joseph's conduct he saw the life that it because remember he just bought him as a slave it's just another commodity like a horse or a dog or a cattle whatever he it was just a tool in his hand to further his his household but then he saw how how joseph was conducting himself and how he was how how he was diligent in the small things brother man says it's the little things we leave undone of the problem not the big things it's the little things we leave undone and so and so he saw how he conducted himself how he treated the other servants how he treated his master how we how he was diligent and in the affairs placed in his hands see it's it's whatever's placed in our hand we should be diligent in it you say well you know i i'm just the guy that sweeps the floor you do a good job you be diligent sweeping floor he said well i just stand there and i don't know wave you know like the person who stands there came out on the mat and welcomes you you know i just do that job you do it real good you say well there's no purpose here i'm just going through the motions of life no you're not god wants to mold you and shape you in everyday living every day is important to god god doesn't say well i can't wait for the weekend yeah it's tuesday i've got monday itis or i'm on was it hump day wednesday or you know it's you know he doesn't think like that he's looking for character and he's going to mulder people into his character he's determined to do it but the thing is if we get all what's the point of tuesday and oh you know school what's the point of this assignment and no there's a purpose in it you say well i won't remember this i can guarantee you 95 of what i sat through university i cannot remember but there was a purpose in it right one we moved here because of a job but to this character in those things because god is looking for someone see his character he doesn't quit on a job he doesn't you know he doesn't say well this is too tough and you know what's the point and just throw it in no no he is he is he has resolved i think brother isaac preached it you know he has real resolve he's determined to see it through so you say well what's the point of learning this calculus you know trying to determine a object moving through three-dimensional space you may never use it in your life but it is so you get a bit of discipline because there'll always be something in life that's difficult you know and and but the thing is when you become an adult it's more your choice what's difficult and the thing is when you become an adult is your comfort zone becomes smaller because when you're a child your parents push you out of your comfort zone you're always going out of your comfort zone go to the school you should play this sport i want you to learn this oh you like violin go learn violin go to this person you know and and you're pushed out of your comfort zone all the time being a child you don't choose where you go on holiday what school you go to necessarily you know the hobbies you do and things you're kind of guided by your parents but you're always pushed out of your comfort zone but they've done they've done studies that people are happier when they're pushed out of their comfort zone because they're growing as a person they're actually their character is being developed but the problem is in this soft-soaked society that we live in is people's comfort zone can rapidly become very small and what happens is they don't grow as a as they now this is just on the natural side but even in these things our character is developed right so so our comfort zone rapidly gets smaller as we get older but we should never let it get so small that that you know something can upset your your life so easily we should never be so set in our ways when because many times as believers we've got to realize our comfort zone actually gets changed or we get pushed out of it because god wants to push us out of our comfort zone it's time for the next stage of your journey amen right joseph could never have become the man he was in pharaoh's house if he stayed there at his father's side as a spoiled favorite son right he had to be wrapped you say well that's a dramatic push out of a comfort zone god doesn't care because he has confidence in you and the seat he's placed in you he wants you to fly and he wants you to realize that you're built of the same material he's built out of just like mama eagle stirs up the nest because those baby eagles have got to realize that that that what they admire in their mother is actually in them you know they admire the power of her wings and how she can bring such good fresh meat to feed on and you know how she saws up and does incredible error you know aerodynamic you know movements and aerobatics and different things but the reason that their nest is stirred up is they need to realize i'm built on the same stuff i'm not lesser than mama i'm not i'm not a different kind of bird that can't do those kind of things actually it's in me it's within me to fly it's within me to soar it's within me to get my own prey and you know do those things and that's what god wants you to realize is you're built to the same material not a different material the bride and the groom are the same material amen so because remember that we are living in the time of the wedding of the lamb every church service is basically a proposal every sermon you hear is actually a proposal will you take me as your lawfully wedded husband that's what the lord is asking us will you in the good times in the bad rich or poorer sickness health till death do we pardon actually it's not that because we've got eternity you know because there's no separation with death between you and god remember death just changes our dwelling place we don't change who we are when we get on the other side that's why it's so vital you say one day i'll rejoice no today because who you are here is who you'll be over there you know we should never let i think it was actually um sister francis brother you know i'm your your grandma right was it francis yeah yeah so brother emerson uh ben's cousin stood up there at her funeral and and i thought it was such a blessed uh tribute he said you know that his grandmother never let her her physical limitations stop her serving god i mean so so we should never let our physical limitations that we perceive to stop us actually serving god amen so so it shouldn't be based on how well we you know sure if you're sick stay at home you know don't spread things but you know you get up and you have a bad day or you just have a bad morning don't let that stop you coming to church you know it's not based on well i just feel so good today and energized and though there'll be days when you don't feel that hallelujah but that shouldn't stop us serving god you know because remember our our walk with god should not be based on our our physical body you know eli eli got real fat he was the high priest and it was health issues were a big that was recorded because obviously his health became a problem and some people can get so fixated on their health we should be healthy okay we should be healthy yes amen this is not about growing the church this way right right we should be healthy but don't let that become your god don't let it become your fixation it should be nothing between my soul and my savior that should be your fixation look as everything is everything under the blood have i placed my whole life and my whole family all that i am and you know i said lord just just may there be no may there be no account not you know some people say keep a short account no i say keep no account there shall be nothing on that ledger amen so joseph proved himself to potiphar and that's how he found grace in the sight of potiphar now potiphar um we know he was just well let's just go back to joseph now joseph's whole life changed when he had those two dreams those were so ingrained into his soul he didn't know necessarily how the details of how it would be manifested but he knew it was going to happen so his whole life was now governed by those two dreams before that i don't know but after that his whole life was governed by those two dreams now those two dreams molded him in such a way that it didn't matter necessarily where he was if he was tied behind a camel of the ishmaelites going down to egypt or if he was in prison now all those things would have been traumatic events here your brothers which actually you know they're you're not having a good relationship with anyway because it says they couldn't even speak peaceably to them you know they just really disdain the guy and um you know but not you know we never he he would never have thought that his brothers were going to sell him to slavery and i doubt very much he would have thought they actually really wanted to kill him this was plan b and you know so there was a lot of trauma of those things in his life it would have been a great a great thing but yet he was so governed by those two dreams that i believe he could see that in everyday life he was stepping closer to the fulfillment of those two dreams amen now we have more than dreams we have a vindicated word amen and we have bible evidence of a holy ghost of the holy ghost moving in our lives proving that we're on our way to a rapture and actually we're in the rapture cycle already i mean because the lord himself has descended with the shout right that first thessalonians the rapture cycle has already begun because brother rahm said the shout is the message very clearly in the rapture sermon so so we are living in that time so we're living in the time of that fulfillment now but the thing is if he could live in such a way that two dreams govern his whole life how much more you and i that have had sermon after sermon message after message outpouring after outpouring revelation after revelation amen where he's revealed he's dropped into your heart you're the bride of christ you're made in my image you're my darling you're my beloved you're the you're the whole object of my love and attention and affection is you i mean that's what he's done hasn't he that's what he's shown you he chose me hallelujah amen that you know that's why the message came because he wanted to show you that you are the reason of his being hallelujah you know i know i've said it often but do you think we're going to be the only ones rejoicing around the throne our lord jesus is going to be rejoicing with us hallelujah because what he had in his mind is now material in front of him i mean where he thought of you at your best you know he knows exactly what you'll look like when you're on the throne he knows the age you know well you're what we think is h yo how will be our height our hair whatever you know it's like a great artist they have in their mind the inspiration to to to paint a painting or make a sculpture it's all in here but then it's got to come out amen and it comes out then they can rejoice what was in here now everyone can see it hallelujah it's the same thing with god and his heart was you redeemed made in his image amen and then now as we're walking with him the spirit man is being matured and growing that we're actually what's within us our maturity is actually matching what god saw before the foundation of the world so so eventually there'll come a time where we're not in time no more we're up in glory hallelujah and he comes out the wedding supper set and he comes out wipes away physically wipes away all our tears you don't need to cry a child no more it's all over hallelujah but he'll be rejoicing amen because the devil couldn't stop him i mean the enemy couldn't stop him what he purposed in his heart has there been been made flesh right now hallelujah so we won't be the only ones he's not going to be indifferent on that day you think we're excited for a body change he's real excited he's been waiting for i know how many eons of time when he first thought of you hallelujah before the foundation world he thought of you you know we're not just a number to god we are not just a number we are the most important object of his love and attention right now as you hallelujah amen you know i love it where i just we'll come back to joseph but you know because it can be such a such a thing we can look at the great things like that but it's got to come down into our everyday life it should govern our everyday life amen now he says in recognizing your day and its message he says now now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride so it's not national forces economic effects whatever is going to put you in the bride it's not the prophet just told us so amen but the power of god i'll just repeat that because i like it but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my my word of spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force will do it [Music] you can take it up with malachi 4 if you don't believe that oh but the world's got to get a certain way and then then we'll be ready no no no no god puts us what is holding what is holding back the great tribulation it's not putin saying what is he going to do and wondering and how is this going to work out it's not america wondering how this is going to work out or nato or the eu no no it's actually because you're still here you are holding back chaos hallelujah you are but the world is falling apart because of you in the same token why because as the bride comes into order everything goes into disorder so it's not market forces which mean you can't buy jib it's you it's you coming into your position so we should actually expect the world to get worse because we're coming in line with the word more and more hallelujah and it's god putting you in line with the word with him more and more hallelujah so yeah praise a lot amen do you like to see the world falling apart no i don't i don't like to see people suffering things but the same token it was prophesied it has to happen that's why we should with prayer prayerfully find that last one so we can go home as the prophet said amen now no national force will do it but the national but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national forces of the of the council of churches will drive every organization organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride and to glory out of it hallelujah amen so we can we can rejoice in that can't we now let no but it's it's interesting though like if we bring that into everyday life now brother brown makes this statement i'll just read this from questions and answers 54 he says now as i've often said i believe in the church here there's a row here and here lives mortal beings are talking about now dimensions and each one is a great color conglomeration of gaiety of blackness and and darkness mortals live in here this world but they are either influenced from this way or from that way you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world that's every man woman and child upon the earth if you are influenced from here you're from above you're celeste your body is waiting up here but if you're wicked and hypocritical and indifferent your celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it's up there so because the fruit that you bear before people proves where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else your life your life that you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here i think that's a big boom your life that you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here so if you're if your life is reflecting this world then then your inheritance is darkness right but if your life is reflecting the word of god then your inheritance is heaven amen so the life and you know what i love about right now is you can change your inheritance right you can actually turn down the devil's inheritance which is the lake of fire and you can sign up for god's inheritance because he said whosoever will let them come right so it's the life that you live is reflecting your inheritance amen so if so if you are not wicked if you're not hypocritical and you're not indifferent then your celestial body just using the prophet's words here is up there amen so that's why people can sit in church and be wicked hypocritical and indifferent but yet think they're up they're going up there that's why i say lord you know as he said by their fruits you shall know them may the fruit of our lives be him amen not a manufactured message culture amen we don't want to have some manufactured put on because it's very easy to to to put the denominations in that bracket but if it's just a manufactured message put on of just pretending god bless you brother god bless you as to how are you and dressing the part all those things but there's no life in here and you know and there's wickedness in here that's just a manufactured something we're never called to manufacture christianity a sheep does not manufacture wool they never ever have a quarterly meeting where they say this is our production this is the amount of feed we have this is more hours we've got to put in we're above budget below budget there's no budget you know no they don't have those kind of meetings they just live every day being sheep and the nature within them bears wool they can't help it you can't say sheep you know they they it's not a mind over matter thing a sheep can never have a meeting and they have one person your um you know the uh what do you call it a motivational speaker sheep stand there before the rest and say now now boys just get in your mind wool wool and this and they're standing maybe we said no i don't mean this is a joke but this is how ridiculous some people are you know you know and then and then we walk past the field and you know all we hear is ba ba and they're trying to you know trying to bear will no no it's a life this is more than mind over matter christianity is not mind over matter christianity is revelation where the lord drops his promises into your heart and you know it's going to happen it's not well i hope it works no no you know it works i mean so that's why if you need guidance in your life say lord i need revelation show me what i need to do amen show me where i need to go brother braham says that we should pray for revelation more than anything but do we pray for revelation lord and it's not to make this gray matter appear this big no forget that man's great matter has failed since the beginning of time since the fall so you know we need to pray lord reveal yourself in the situation show us away because when he reveals himself in a situation everyone can criticize what you're doing but you can take your your revelation back into the word and you can walk in peace irrespective of how people feel about it amen because we have to you know i pray we can walk in such a way that it's actually not us trying to do it we cannot not one of us can get into a rapture in our own ability it's god's ability but that doesn't mean we just sit back get fat and sassy as brother john and he said and you know forget about the whole thing no no we're going to push in as well we're going to give ourselves to it amen amen he says no i saw i'm just going back to this quote we are right now all just think of it we are right now glorified the prince of god born again believers for if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we are we have one already waiting in glory not somewhere else right yonder already waiting now and these earthly bodies grown to be clothed upon with that immortality is that right sickness and aches and pains and disappointments and heartaches oh i'll be glad within that when the old pest house is closed up amen won't you yes sir we can go home that's right just we are grown to be clothed upon the spirits groaning oh when you look and see all the pains around about all the uh conglomeration stink and sin and mortal living deceit and everything i think oh god how much longer will it be now we've got to keep this very much in balance because sometimes when we so we should be burdened for this world we should sign cry for the abominations done in the city but at the same time we should be rejoicing full of glory and praise that he's redeemed redeemed us amen but the thing is if we get so caught up in the future we will miss the present we will miss the present if we saw one day one day it's gonna happen one day god's gonna pour us where are you in the bride's revival amen it's raining glory i'm the weather man i'll say it's raining what's going to happen tomorrow it's going to rain and the next day it's forecast until we go home it's raining if it's sunny where you are get out of the shade of unbelief and criticism and trouble whatever it is come into the reign of the spirit hallelujah amen amen so it's raining we have the revival we have the awakening who knows they're the bride of christ amen you've been awakened this word has awakened you it's not you that decided one day well i'm going to be mrs jesus today no no he already determined it amen but the thing is if we're always looking for tomorrow for a better day we miss today we shouldn't be always looking for tomorrow right now today should be the best day of your life oh but i was richer back then i had better tires back then i had less burden no no i'm not talking about those things trouble will be with us we have to work until these bodies are changed this is under the curse until this body's changed a lot of people want to get the spoken word that they don't have to go work we need a character development because i i'll be i'll just be frank honest i don't care about meals i want salvation for people that's all i'm interested in the stake will be there and gone and what i don't care about that i would rather starve and see my whole family and my extended family any you know colleagues whatever i'd rather see them come in and starve than be fat and sassy and see no one but enjoy a good wagyu that's spoken into existence who cares about those things those things will go but eternal life that's why haiti wright said the right thing that's right amen and that same anointing and the same faith is here that super anointing brother brown said that is here amen to change people's lives like her son's lives were changed i mean so we should look at everyday life we should be the same i'm maybe i'm just going around in circles but how we treat others should be we should treat a believer the same as a non-believer we should treat a believer the same as a make-believer now i'm not putting anyone in any categories not looking at anyone in particular so i'll just look at everyone at the same but we should treat everyone the same because jesus said if you love one another but don't love the sinner what reward do you have sinners love each other you know but if you can love the unlovable if you can treat the unlovable with the same love and respect as a as some godly man or woman or you know someone you love there's a reward in that and we are called to love the unlovable amen you know it's easy to say oh divine love is here the caps are divine lovers here but it's got to put on flesh words are very cheap but actions you know they're not cheap amen so it's everyday life never ever think a day is just a wasted day as brother isaac preached a while ago on time a lot in time actually we a lot time to do nothing it's not you know it's not just something you can just you know if you further away you have a lot of that to frittering you know some of us are very good fritterers but let's not fritter no more okay because every day every day god is molding us every day god is shaping us it's through the monotony of what we call boring you know the problem with the the age we live in as you see people's lives on social media it's only highlights there's not the there's not the burnt coffee there's not the broken down car there's not another day at work there's not another same old problem or whatever this needs fixing all those monotony things no no it's the highlights look at where i am today all these influences and their staged photos of things and you know trying to say this is life no no it's not life that's actually just fake art that's all it is because it's not everyday life but the problem is that's pushed in front of people and they say i need to obtain to that but you can't obtain something that's not real because do you have a group of 30 people around you setting up those shots and millions of dollars to go to places and do those things is that everyday life no so why why try and live in a fantasy world when actually today's the best day and why is today the best day of our lives well if we could just realize i've been loose from the clutches of the devil by the blood of jesus christ i've been completely loosed i'm not i'm not in his pawn shop i'm not under his you know what i'm sure the devil can afflict our body and we get sick he can even afflict our spirit and we can be troubled in our mind but he can't touch that soul i mean he can't touch the real part of us that's actually hidden away in god hallelujah so today is the best day of my life i could be having the worst week ever but it's the best day of my life because i'm one day closer to him taking me away and he's doing something in my worst week of my life joseph no doubt when he got to the right hand and potiphar thought now here we are i've arrived he's the captain of the guard how high can you go he's made it we're in there all the potiphar he he came to a place in his life where all he knew was what he was eating in his next meal that's all he knew what he owned because joseph just had it all under his hand and nobody thought finally i'm ready but he wasn't ready because that wasn't the position that that god wanted him to be he need to get to pharaoh's right hand so he's there no doubt thinking i'm secure i've got my life sorted lord when are these dreams going to be fulfilled but he didn't realize he had to be in a dungeon forgotten for a couple of years before he came to his place you know we think sometimes we're ready who's had those moments i've had that moment i'm ready a lot just push the button dead in christ we're on schedule but god's schedule's different to our schedule we should not be so caught up in in our troubles and so tense about life and children and things you know the most powerful thing brother braham said is a committal to god it's a powerful thing when we can really commit our troubles and things to god that's a as he said it's one of the most powerful weapons placed in your hand when you actually commit them to god not just lord i give them to you but actually you got a string and you pull it back and say you know no you commit them and then once you've actually committed them to god you give thanks that the answer's on its way you give thanks that they're coming home you give thanks they're going to get saved because you've placed them in his hand amen hallelujah that's what we need to do amen remember it's not our job to fulfill the word now this may sound wrong because we're here to fulfill the word but who's going to fulfill the promises of god in your life it's him it's not you yourself it's him it's our sure it's our obedience to the word but it's he the one that fulfills it amen so it's everyday life no hallelujah he says here and where i think pentecost failed now as i've said before i never put these things back there anymore i bring them into here because if you look through the bible i like to second kings is a great lesson for me because you see there's a cycle where godly kings they come to a spot and they either and they either we know every man has to fail sure and some you know and you know in some way but they get to a spot where they either stay humble with god and walk on or they're lifted up in pride thinking they can do anything because god has blessed them in the past and they fall into ruin like um um uzziah the king if i'm saying yo god blessed him so much he thought i can be a priest now i don't need to stay as just a king remember all the priesthood stop you have no right to offer sacrifices but he was so blessed by god he god in his mind i can do whatever i want and god will bless me but did he even even i think you know josiah godly king and then and then the egyptians are coming along and he just decides i'm gonna go fight them because he thought nothing could happen to me sadly he ended up dead so we can't just keep walking like everything i touch turns to gold we have to stay humble with our god we need to stay with a consecrated life no matter what stage of life we are we can't get complacent and just sit back and say well you know we can't live off our reputation reputation's just actually among men no and and the problem with the reputation is actually then a respect of persons comes in sure we respect what people have done in the past i'm not discounting what people have done or our testimonies we have but we can't just rest on our reputation like they did we've got to keep walking with god we need to walk humble with him he says and where i think pentecost failed now well what we need today is a consecrated life where you have to speak nothing god speaks in your place and he proves just what you are that's right the blood of jesus christ cleansing us from all unrighteousness then we have fellowship one with another the blood making us clean and holy we live so that we could walk up to any denomination a church or anything and say good morning my brother not a hypocrite he'd know it but with a true heart say how goes it with you and god today my dear brother like that and walk along talk with him have fellowship with him that's the way that's when you're getting salty so we don't want to ever approach anyone anyone so atheist agnostic whatever denomination doesn't matter how ridiculous you think in your mind we never want to ever think we're better than them we actually don't want to think well they've got nothing and i've got everything no god has everything and it was his supreme grace that reached out in his hand for you it wasn't you that decided i'm going to walk on the king's highway no god put you on the king's highway god cleansed you and put you on the king's highway and said walk up this way and then us you know one time no a couple of times me and my brother we were we were young 10 12 around that age on my uncle's sheep station sheep and cattle station from the uh it's it's it's between wairua and gisborne the the the country you know not the coastal road the back road and they're like 500 sheep or whatever you know he gives us a quad bike and says now take the sheep up to that paddock along the road but we couldn't really fail because every gate was closed apart from the one they need to go into but all these sheep are walking along and then half the time you got to be walking along the ditches to get them out of the ditch and keep them on the road because they're walking oh there's grass here and they wander over here you're going this way but it's like this and they go eat over here and but we're going this way and it's the same thing with us we walk along the king's highway and then oh what's this over here and then we go like this and what's this over here we're just you know and and the great shepherd he's not behind us he's in front of us he's not hold on come this way don't get distracted by what you see in the world of what's going on over here or problems in the family or in the church no keep walking that's how we need to be amen now now you can't do that just impersonating what's that being a real genuine how are you doing how's you in the lord talking with them being being real salty now you can't do that just impersonating you if you do it you're a hypocrite that's all if you do it just because you know it's a line of duty you don't do it at all so don't do it just because it's expected right stay before god until it's in your heart to do that then you're coming right with god do you believe that he says i believe with all my heart i think that's where the church has failed i think we've failed to bring love among us and to bring fellowship among the groups and things like that and we've tried to push ourselves into something that god has not ordained he hasn't ordained secretariat um i can't say the word but division i use that word you know he hasn't ordained that kind of thing he has an ordained well this church is better than that church now we're all the same the body of christ is the same around the world doesn't matter if where you go be the same spirit the same love the same revelation amen amen we are not this church is not better than any other church we should never get that in our mind oh we're special no no well the bride is special right we're all special to god we're the we're all the apple of his eye he doesn't have favorites we're all his favorite but you should have in your heart that you're his favorite that you know that should be how you are with god actually no i'm the apple of his eye i'm the favorite he loves me shouldn't you feel that way you know you should never think oh he he doesn't care about me oh i'm kind of on the out and out group of his bride and you know he he treats us all the same he loves us all the same amen amen so and things like that we've tried to push ourselves into saying that god has not ordained and i believe that if we would just walk back down the line to god and say god here i stand nothing all i have to offer you about my life but god i pray you'll let me live so that i'll find grace in your sight now now you're coming along getting pretty close to the kingdom that's right then you'll see a real healing meeting and this is when the great healing revival was going on is if we just walk along like that then you'll see a real healing meeting then you'll really see what what you're longing for because that's what they are longing for in that day i would love to see a real healing meeting but we have just more than just a healing meeting i'd love to see the holy ghost pour himself out i'd love to see people renewed in the holy ghost to see the word put on flesh in a greater measure to see the bride come to her full position to see the cycle because sometimes we're just caught in cycles the devil fights us and we beat him but then we come around the mountain again i'd love to see cycles broken i'd love to see the cycle of depression broken in people's lives people withdraw themselves feel sorry for themselves and pull away it's a spirit that's haunting them i'd love to see that broken i'd love to see the spirit of indifference broken and where people don't just go around the mountain and slay that same devil but they go around the mountain slay the devil and turn northward and go on that's what i would love to see amen where where overcoming power puts on its full manifestation amen that's what i want to see we're actually we walk so humbly with god that every devil is under our feet that we walk we gather together and the spirit is so strong that sin is just called out amen hallelujah that's what i'd love to see amen we're we're we're actually we have to go back and watch the service again because god just took over we didn't know what happened that's what i'd like to see amen where you know where we realize who we are because remember we don't just talk about the blood as an as an idea no no we have experienced the power of his grace in his blood hallelujah but you see now we've got to see him in everyday life monday god's going to be in monday he's going to be in tuesday he's going to be in that sore back problem he's going to be in that thing with a where the car doesn't start he's in that he's in there i mean when there's when there's a trouble and attention in the house he's in that tension he's not causing us the devil but he wants you to call call him on the scene i mean don't go by the carnal way of fighting it but let god come down and take over amen that's what he wants to do he wants he's going to be in tuesday if you lose your job he's in the losing of the job i mean if you're having financial trouble he's in there but you've got to see him in those things you got to be looking for him and every day remember god there's nothing with there's not monotony in god it's it's us because of our concept of time that we think this is just another week and another term and another year oh it's autumn again it'll be another autumn this could be the last autumn we're here we may not even get to winter and i say praise god because i'm a summer kind of person i like the sunshine amen so so everything that we everything we do we've got to realize actually no this is not a wasted moment even if you're relaxing that's not a wasted moment bring god into your relaxing bring him put your feet up on the chair god come sit down put your feet up on the chair too let's have a time hallelujah but if we get so tense and stressed about things now i've got to fix everything and how i'm going to manipulate this and work this situation here and how am i going to talk to this person i want them to say a certain thing this way to agree with me here no it's never going to work we're not called to be manipulators that's a whole sermon in itself we'll leave that maybe for next time hallelujah now i'm just going to read a few more quotes and then we're gonna now love and faith work hand in hand brother braham says in the message perfect faith he says now won't you love won't your love reach back to him and there's a love affair talk about you and god no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith that god loves you and you love god so the circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith so it should never be a situation or circumstance that happens that the devil is allowed to come in and do something in your life that actually governs you that's right it should be your love and your faith should govern the circumstances it may not change the circumstances in terms of whatever has happened but it will change you in the circumstances you see peter when he was you know jesus is walking on the water and it's not a mill pond like some place you know the waves were going jesus is there i don't know what the swell is but you know the sea of galilee can get quite quite choppy and you know so here's jesus walking on the water they get all scared they think it's a spirit but then he calls him no it's me and peter says can i come out there too amen so he had faith and love and the one calling him to come out because because the lord said come so now the sea hasn't changed he's still on the boat he's still on the sea of galilee the circumstances have not changed one iota but he steps out upon the water so now he's in the same storm but he's keeping his eyes on the lord jesus right so his love and his faith because before maybe he's travelled by the boat how it's going to handle in the water but then he sees jesus walk out on the circumstance he says can i come too so he begins to walk and as long as he keeps his eyes on the lord he can walk but you see as soon as he stepped out the water didn't become calm the wind didn't stop blowing nothing changed and can be the like the storms of life can come in but he wants you to walk on the storms of life he's called you actually not to drown in them not to be trouble but just keep your eyes on the master and you can actually walk on the storm because you know we we want the storm to go away well i'll be honest i like st i don't like storms you know i like calm you guys like tornado chasers or what you know some of you like storms you know but the thing is if god only did that where's the character being formed where's the character being formed in that you see so because god is looking for character he's looking for his character and a people that's what he's looking for that's what he's interested in so he knows because all things work together for our good that those that love god and called according to his purpose what's that good that his character is molded in us we may not see it in the particular circumstance but he it's working for our good because it's moulding himself into us right so now many times we want the storms to be calmed but god wants character form dinner so he'll allow us to keep walking in the storm but then overcoming power that character starts to come out of us now if peter kept looking at the lord he would never start to sink but what i love about that story is as even though his eyes got off the lord and god on the storm he began to drown he began to sink you know peter says lord save me i'm i'm sinking and says immediately jesus put forth his hand and pulled him up hallelujah so we can actually get begin to sink in a storm but if we call out to the lord lord help me i can't cope with the storm it's too windy it's too stressful it's too troubling i cannot you know my heart is overwhelmed i cannot i cannot go through this anymore he'll grab you by the hand and pull you up that's it hallelujah amen so so peter wasn't the only one to walk on water once he walked on water twice because he walked on water with the law back to the boat hallelujah hey amen amen so circumstances governed by this love that creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings the faith many people ask the question how do they know god loves loves me it's because he called you before the foundation of the world his love is an elective love brother brahm says the church age book many people think that god's love is like parental care love so that is parents want to keep their children from every scrape and bump that they could possibly get they want to keep them safe but god's love is not like that it's greater than that it's an elective love because he chose you before the foundation of the world he loves you how do you know you've been called before the foundational world because when the message came your way it transformed your life where the lord jesus christ was not a god of history no more he became a god of reality and he transformed your life even contrary to your own nature he changed you hallelujah that's how you know you're predestinated amen and that's how you know that he loves you amen his love don't change his love is constant his love his love does not fluctuate it doesn't fluctuate by circumstances he doesn't look at you one day and say i love you you're great and the next day i'm not sure you know he doesn't his love doesn't go up and down like the tide his love is constant he cannot change if he's loved you he loves you if he's declared his love for you he loves you he does not change that love it stays so it's not based on performance not based on how we're doing or how we think we are his love stays the same hallelujah and his love is very great amen praise the lord now now watch pure faith uh perfect faith is pure just as pure as love as see now when you love somebody you love your husband or you or or you love your wife there's no need of anybody telling you you don't because you do it and you know you do now i'd ask you how um how can you how can you prove you do it oh i prove it by the way i look to him see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me that i love my wife i love my husband see your life proves what you are amen the same thing christianity does see your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure it's something real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you've got it and your actions prove it and when you get pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it's done just walking along no matter what the thing look like what anybody else says you know it's happened you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as well as well as you know you love see love and faith go together their kin folks they love love produces faith that's why we should never ever let our love diminish it should increase for the lord amen now i say two more quotes so i'm going to read one more because i've read one and then we're going to close i'm going to read this one i might read about more than it and and though you say well i wish i know the bible though i understand all the mysteries of god and still though i could do it and have not charity i'm nothing see you haven't got nowhere yet see the main thing is love god and humble yourself with it now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in it and if you want to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in now remember this in everyday life everyday life because because arrogant means to have having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities so if you put someone if you put a sinner down here and you put yourself up here you're being arrogant are they just cannon fighter they're just atomic fodder don't put someone in that category that's right i'll say this god will put someone in that category it's god that puts people where he puts people right but don't have that attitude oh they're just ashes they're nothing it's gonna you know they're going to the tribulation how do you know god loved you when you were actually unlovable right so how about the unlovable in your life can you love them and and have a burden for them and pray say lord may my life influence them in such a way that they want to turn towards you and serve you may they want what i profess to have because remember we are god's billboard we are god's advertising many people these days will never read this but they'll read your life you know people say oh i follow the message well then they'll say well what does your what does this message produce right and you that's what they're looking at they're they're not necessarily interested in doctrines and things no they want to see a life lived they want to see a gospel that's manifested amen so lord jesus help us because i'm putting myself very much in this practice and never let an arrogant spirit ever get around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anyone has done if they are wrong don't ever build a complex against that person see you must be kind and sweet remember god loves you when you're in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you love the other person when he's wrong see just pray for them and love one another amen and above everything love god and love one another and be humble with god and around one another and god will bless us it's a hard thing telling what he will do amen amen amen because there's no limit on god usually when a church begins to get in numbers and gets to getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from the real thing the real thing we're 10 years old in june oh we've been here a while no we can't get away from the real thing amen do you know what brought these things to pass so i'm just going to read this and then and then i'm going to quit when i first started the lord appeared to me down the river and told me that as brother vale saw that i believe in the paper in canada many years ago with angel lord appeared on the river down there it was on associated press mystic light over local minister while baptizing you know what did that when we had a tent meeting just across the street a tent that seated about 2500 people ministers come from everywhere said brother come here a minute i was just a boy oh just a kid he said how do you keep those people in one accord they love one another till till they um he says i haven't seen people love one another that's the lord that's what this church was established upon that godly brotherly love for one another i've seen them even shake hands with one another leaving the place and cry like babies to leave one another they loved one another that well and i could get to their house and visit them in times the bible was laying open and stained with tears coming at night time where fathers and mothers were gathered together and their little children around on the floor kneeling around and fathers and mothers on their knees crying and praying i stand at the door and wait and wait and wait and they didn't stop praying i just sit down on the steps and start praying myself waiting for them see that's what and they love one another they love one another we used to stand and sing that old song blessed be the tie that binds our hearts and christian love their fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above when we ascend apart it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again i say this with great joy in my heart to christ many of them are sleeping around in the in these graves marked tonight waiting for that great resurrection where we'll meet together again let not that spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does then i don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of god the spirit of god i mean the word of god the spirit of god is grieved away see when when we can have all things in fellowship in common and love one another then god will work with us who wants that kind of church who wants that kind of life hallelujah amen but you see it's in everyday life these things begin to happen may we ever may we ever see god's hand in our lives every day may we never think well this is just another day another dollar another going through the motions it's not remember the problem is the devil wants us just to think it's just monotony and god's not doing anything because then we lose focus on the one we're living for right and if we lose focus on the one we're living for then we can't live for one another we can't be a blessing to one another so may we be like joseph amen and actually see every day has a purpose we're not here occupying time we're not here just sitting around doing nothing even if you're being a real mum god bless you brother am said that's actually an adopted position in the body is his mother right so that's actually someone fully adopted in the body of christ as being a mom many times you think i was going to be a songwriter a preacher whatever no no no mom that's powerful a mother in her position that's incredibly powerful hallelujah so you know you're changing another diaper wiping a nose feeding whatever getting up and helping your children at night or whatever god's in those things god's in that character building and it's important you you may be laying the same floor that you've laid a million times god's in that you know i don't know how many thousands of samples come through my work and they all look the same urine in a urine and a tube this big there's three of them and they've got different stickers but they all look the same but god is in that amen so you know we may think what's the point no there's a point say lord jesus guide me through this day remember brother braham said if if if he knew the lord jesus was coming this afternoon he said he'd come to the pulpit the same he'd preach the same do the same things till the lord takes him home now i don't know how you do that because i remember before christmas the morning of i i just couldn't sleep but he said i'll just continue living on be a sweet humble christian continue living on try and get as many souls into the kingdom as you can but every day is important so let's serve god in the every day amen let's have the musicians this morning [Applause] hey man let's stand this morning i mean let's sing that song every day with jesus sweeter than the day before hey man i'm sure we have that in the um in the book somewhere [Music] hey man what key shall we g okay amen let's sing

hallelujah amen let's sing that song let me walk blessed lord on the way thou hast gone leading straight to the land above giving cheer everywhere to the sad and alone do you know what's incredible

have all the material wealth of the world right here in this country have need of nothing but yet this this country is full of the sad and alone let's bring them joy and peace amen we're not better

word of prayer amen who wants to be more like him and every day who wants to see him in your everyday life amen gracious gracious lord jesus you see the hands that are raised my both my hands are raised as well lord may life not be a monotony to us lord but may we see your unseen hand if i can say it that way lord in our lives lord that every day you're molding and shaping our character every day lord you are making us more like you every day you want to reveal yourself in every trial of every day may we look for you oh god in the mundane that we will consider to be mundane lord and just lord may we may we see you from monday to friday saturday sunday then monday to friday again oh god may you grant it father even if we feel like we've done this a million times before may we see you in it dear god thank you lord for a life like joseph lord if he could if he could live such a way because of two dreams how much more us and what you've poured in oh god you've opened your word you've made yourself so real to us lord your spirit moves oh god time after time to remind us that we have a home beyond the river oh god i just pray father may we walk with purpose lord may we have our shoulders back oh god may we not be feeling sorry for ourselves and being downcast oh god but maybe realize that you're in control you're guiding us oh god you're allowing all things for our good lord we just want to submit our lives into your hands may we be real consecrated christians oh god surrendered into your hand that you can do with us what you will grant it father we just want to commit the day and ourselves into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends brother honest you want to lead us in a couple more choruses and you can dismiss amen god bless your friends [Music] hello brother ben just wants to say something we are going to try after consuming [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] you want to see no i'm not going to sing sorry [Music] it's very short and sweet um so halfway through the service i when i woke up this morning there was a scripture that that i was given and um and i thought oh okay because i've been dealing with my own personal strife and stuff and how to deal with all of that i thought okay well maybe it's the lord just telling me to calm down and um and then halfway through the service off i thought the lord said you need to read that scripture and i thought oh that's but do you want me to testify law do you want me to speak about this or you know some things that have been happening and it didn't you know didn't get an answer so i just left it and then i came again you need to just read that scripture that's it and i thought but it doesn't make sense i'll feel so silly and um then brother ben read his last two quotes and then it made sense so sorry i feel so nervous um so it's just very very simple but i felt like i was it's a if the lord was giving it to me it must be for other people too so it's philippians 2 verse 3 let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let it let each esteem other better than themselves [Applause] please line up there think it's uh brother ben if you ever seen the timely message it was today okay so this morning we started our class off and we rent out of matthew 22 verse 30 they even remember today and it says there it says jesus said unto them thou shalt love thy lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbors their selves and these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets and what our sunday school lesson was about and i'm going to tease someone mr kira law and love law and love so i just want to say something god is telling us something that the law that we're under the law how we share it must be in love you know because remember when jesus came he magnified that law he says even if you're angry with the brother you committed murder don't do that and what we said this morning said we're here to love one another live for one another we are each other servant and if you see someone and you see the little one struggling we're here to help amen and i believe with all of my heart god is trying to tell us stay humble stay in position and keep loving one another still live under god's law he still has commandments we should keep it's fine yeah but don't kill with the letter amen you know like like ben and i i thank you for it jesus is walking in front of us and saying are you following along he ain't pushing us he's a gentleman yeah so guys sunday school lesson just what brother being said about hey can we testify to that amen there's something happening there right amen you can have your seats [Music] sorry i forget that sometimes we don't take this moments just to show god living and he's alive today you know let these moments go past don't don't ever let them go past police [Music] go for the baptism e key e [Music] i need some fire here thank you [Music] fire fire the holy ghost is fire do you have fire i have fire i need fire who has fire fire will fire [Music] so slow let's
