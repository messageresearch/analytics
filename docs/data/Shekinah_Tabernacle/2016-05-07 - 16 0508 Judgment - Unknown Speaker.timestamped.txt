[17:34] somebody with testimony this
[17:37] morning Shannon okay again I thought if
[17:41] Lord you want to share this testimony
[17:42] I'll share it with you it's when we were
[17:44] singing delight yourself in the Lord and
[17:45] I was Naomi last night about the
[17:47] testimony about how we okay so um 13
[17:52] years ago I wanted to be a ranger and I
[17:55] was studying to be this Ranger you know
[17:57] live out in the bush carry a gun it was
[17:59] my ideal and um then when I came to New
[18:03] Zealand it all changed and um I met the
[18:06] Lord then met my husband then ended up
[18:09] being a wife and a mom of three and
[18:10] staying home with children and um you
[18:13] know it says forsake all and follow him
[18:16] amen praise the Lord so you know
[18:18] thoughts came up like once in a while
[18:20] it's like oh didn't know if I wanted
[18:21] this job but I'm here and I'm you know
[18:23] following the Lord and then um we got
[18:27] this place we are at at the atas and one
[18:30] night I was outside um stargazing and
[18:34] just really appreciating what the Lord's
[18:36] made and I really felt his presence come
[18:39] right next to me and it was a presence
[18:41] that I wasn't used to or having
[18:43] experienced before because I couldn't
[18:45] say anything I couldn't worship I
[18:46] couldn't talk to him I couldn't sing to
[18:48] him I couldn't do anything to him he was
[18:49] like he was ministering to me and um I
[18:52] tell them say as you delight yourself in
[18:55] me I Delight in you amen so then I
[18:58] thought oh this I don't want it to just
[19:00] be out of my mind so I checked the
[19:02] scriptures to see about delight and what
[19:05] Psalm is it where it says delight
[19:07] yourself in the Lord and He Shall give
[19:08] you the desires of your
[19:10] heart 36 OR7 and so um 13 years later
[19:15] I'm out in the bush I'm a Ranger with my
[19:17] little Ranger X and it dawned on me it
[19:20] dawned on me that he gave me my desire
[19:23] and it didn't happen straight away but
[19:25] he knew it he placed it in my heart and
[19:26] he fulfilled it everything we ask for is
[19:29] the song says he gives us everything
[19:31] amen and he does yes he
[19:35] does so praise the Lord amen praise the
[19:39] Lord amen you Lord

[39:09] John okay so I've got um a little
[39:13] message that I want to bring this
[39:15] morning and it sounds like a um maybe a
[39:19] negative subject but it's really not
[39:22] um and the subject is called
[39:24] judgment amen
[39:27] and it um I'm probably not going to um
[39:31] maybe say a lot of things that you
[39:32] haven't already heard but I'm just going
[39:34] to go through it
[39:37] um from what the Lord sh me about it so
[39:39] far and just work our way through this
[39:42] concept of
[39:43] judgment um and I've had a real blessing
[39:46] getting it
[39:47] together back that a bit
[39:52] bigger and this the
[39:55] um
[39:58] okay I didn't put that font
[40:00] there
[40:09] anyway why is that font funny Brother
[40:11] Andy hope it's not like that through all
[40:13] of them anyway praise the Lord let's um
[40:16] yeah that's fine
[40:18] okay now when I start this I'm going to
[40:21] go quite fast okay is that all right I'm
[40:24] going to run through it quite quick so
[40:26] I'm not going to go slow I've got a
[40:28] little bit to get through it I'm just
[40:29] going to keep going okay so I'll just
[40:32] slow go slow at the start but when I get
[40:34] into it I'll speed it up um because I I
[40:37] it's a sort of thought that if you if
[40:39] you just go through the whole thing it
[40:40] it it can as Peter said you know I'm not
[40:43] telling you things you don't know but
[40:44] I'm just going to stir stir up your
[40:46] remembrance about these things and
[40:48] that's what this has done for me I've
[40:49] just after looking through it I've
[40:50] thought well you know there is actually
[40:52] judgment is in a lot of areas of our
[40:54] life and there's a lot of judgment
[40:55] coming and it's it's not just a story we
[40:58] hear and oh it's far far away it's
[41:01] happening now and it always has been
[41:02] happening and there's a lot on its way
[41:04] to
[41:05] happen and um my scripture this morning
[41:08] is seems funny with the
[41:11] um the subject but it's Isaiah
[41:14] 9:6 it says For unto us a child is born
[41:16] unto us a son is given and the
[41:19] government shall be upon his shoulder
[41:21] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[41:23] counselor I like counselor the Mighty
[41:26] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[41:31] peace and it's so good that we
[41:34] have a counselor we have the mighty
[41:37] father and we have the Prince of Peace
[41:39] on our
[41:40] side and you'll see why in the end I use
[41:43] that scripture and I want to Major on
[41:44] the Prince of
[41:45] Peace because after all this we have
[41:48] peace amen okay let's just get into it
[41:52] now can we make that bigger brother
[41:55] someone
[42:07] can we take two minutes and fix that you
[42:10] mind I
[42:13] just I just want to get this so you can
[42:15] see it
[42:18] properly who's had a good week who's had
[42:21] a Victorious week
[42:24] amen um and in a service I was in in
[42:27] Australia there was a sister that had to
[42:28] leave and she was I think she was in a
[42:30] wheelchair and she had to go somewhere
[42:31] and there was all this disruption so the
[42:33] brother said let's sing a song and we
[42:35] sang an EA Palace song and it was
[42:37] um it's me it's me oh Lord you guys know

[43:55] song but actually it is me standing in
[43:56] the need of
[43:58] prayer we need his mercy and his grace
[44:00] every
[44:01] day good thank you very much that's
[44:05] better um yeah good thank you you can
[44:10] always rely on Brother Andy to get
[44:11] technical stuff sorted
[44:15] out good work
[44:19] okay so this is what I'm going to be
[44:20] going through it's it's a judgment
[44:22] timeline and I'm I'm essentially going
[44:25] to start um here I'm not going to cover
[44:29] those but I'm just going to go from
[44:30] there back through to the end and Zone
[44:31] in on a few things but right throughout
[44:34] time there's been judgments happened to
[44:36] man and God's God's a god of judgment
[44:38] he's implemented judgment many times now
[44:41] we had at the beginning we've got Adam
[44:43] and
[44:44] Eve and then we we understand the story
[44:47] there um how that they sinned and then
[44:50] God proclaimed judgment so that was that
[44:51] was the first judgment that he
[44:52] proclaimed and it was upon Adam and Eve
[44:55] and and they were sent forth from the
[44:57] garden and man fell but that was that
[45:00] was the first judgment really towards
[45:02] man that God made that God implemented I
[45:05] should say and then the next major
[45:07] judgment outside of the flood I haven't
[45:09] got the flood in here is is then he got
[45:12] this idea of judging a lamb a natural
[45:14] lamb it sounds strange but he he he
[45:17] would judge a lamb and say if you would
[45:21] you you can lay your sins upon that lamb
[45:22] and I'll judge that lamb in your place
[45:24] so that was judgment that he
[45:26] judged upon a lamb a natural lamb and
[45:30] then later on he came himself and he
[45:33] took judgment upon himself as the um
[45:38] spiritual
[45:39] lamb and the Bible says it pleased God
[45:42] to bruise
[45:43] him and and that the wrath of God the
[45:46] Judgment of God was poured out upon the
[45:49] upon
[45:49] himself essentially but he played the
[45:51] part of a son so he he took his own
[45:53] judgment upon himself and it wasn't a
[45:56] nice judgment it was a painful hard
[45:58] judgment that he took upon himself so he
[46:00] took judgment himself although he imp he
[46:02] he um implements judgment for our sake
[46:05] he took judgment that's right and that
[46:07] was a major judgment it pleased God to
[46:10] bruise him he he was he poured out his
[46:13] wrath the wrath of God As we sing the
[46:15] song The Wrath of God was satisfied the
[46:18] the fierce judgment he had he could pour
[46:20] it out and he was satisfied with with
[46:21] that so so he took his own judgment
[46:25] there now now for where we're going to
[46:27] go this morning we're going to start
[46:29] from the we're going to go through this
[46:31] in segments but we're going to take it
[46:34] from the the section of judgment between
[46:36] there and the Judgment of the
[46:38] tribulation I'm just going to work in
[46:39] there for a we bit so after he took that
[46:42] judgment then there was another minor
[46:45] judgment happened after that if you go
[46:47] to the next
[46:48] one now the this is not really what I'm
[46:51] going to cover but I just want to cover
[46:52] this the next minor judgment was
[46:53] actually on the Jewish people
[46:56] because he was um trying to save them
[47:01] and help them all the way through but
[47:02] there came a point where he said when
[47:05] they finally rejected the Messiah that
[47:07] was sent to them to take their judgment
[47:09] because that was for the Jews that
[47:10] wasn't for us he took that judgment for
[47:12] them they were his people we weren't his
[47:14] people all of us here were Gentiles he
[47:17] came to his own and his own received
[47:18] them not so his own rejected that
[47:21] substitute rejected the judgment and so
[47:25] the next
[47:26] essentially the next judgment that
[47:27] happened was on his own people he said
[47:29] well I'm going to cut you off and the
[47:32] Bible talks about it in terms of an
[47:34] olive tree and I want to read the
[47:35] scriptures that I've got here because as
[47:37] brother Ram said my words will fail but
[47:38] his won't so if we read the scriptures
[47:40] they won't fail so the Jewish people
[47:42] were cut off from essentially the the
[47:46] the
[47:48] um
[47:49] salvation as as and and God turned to
[47:52] the to the Gentiles but some of them
[47:54] still were saved we understand that but
[47:56] as a nation they were cut off and Romans
[47:57] 11:24 talks about the Olive Tree and it
[48:00] says for if they were cut out of the
[48:01] Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and
[48:04] were grafted and contrary to Nature into
[48:05] a good Olive Tree how much more shall
[48:07] those which be the natural branches be
[48:09] grafted into their own Olive Tree so you
[48:12] all understand the um he likened the the
[48:15] this whole thing to an olive tree and he
[48:16] said I've broken off the natural branch
[48:18] which were the Jews and I've grafted in
[48:20] the Gentiles which are us okay and now
[48:24] Paul actually man that when Paul is
[48:26] speaking in Acts 13:46 he said then Paul
[48:28] and Barnabas waxed bold into speaking to
[48:30] the Jews and they said it was necessary
[48:31] that the word of God should have been
[48:33] first should first have been spoken unto
[48:35] you because you were his people but
[48:37] seeing you put it from you and judge
[48:39] yourselves Unworthy of eternal life Lo
[48:41] we turn to the Gentiles so he's he's
[48:44] saying this is what's happening now
[48:45] we're turning from you now what we then
[48:48] have is us as Gentiles were grafted into
[48:51] this the the the good things of God into
[48:54] the promise of Abraham Romans 11:9 says
[48:57] Thou wil say then the branches were
[48:59] broken off that's the Jews that I might
[49:02] be grafted in well because of unbelief
[49:04] they were broken off and th stand this
[49:06] by faith be not high minded but fear so
[49:09] saying you were grafted in because the
[49:12] others didn't believe so you believe
[49:13] otherwise you'll be you taken out now
[49:15] I've got this timeline here now at the
[49:17] end here the um the Jews will be grafted
[49:20] back in and we're getting to the point
[49:21] where the where the Gentiles have had
[49:23] their chance and their branch is going
[49:24] to be broken off so we've we've got this
[49:26] period now within this period of time
[49:28] you have the you've got the seven Church
[49:30] ages the seven Messengers and the four
[49:32] beasts and the four horse riders all of
[49:34] this activity happens within this space
[49:36] of time between in the Gentile period
[49:39] here okay go to the next one please now
[49:43] within that space of time there are
[49:45] different people that come
[49:47] along different Gentiles that come along
[49:49] and
[49:50] they they all receive a judgment of
[49:53] sorts as they live through this period
[49:55] of time
[49:56] and they all react differently to this
[49:59] judgment we all receive judgment somehow
[50:02] and depending on what's in Us and how we
[50:04] are is is how we respond and act towards
[50:07] it and if you search it through you'll
[50:09] find that there
[50:11] are there are basically these types of
[50:14] people now I'm not here to name any
[50:16] names or anything like that I'm just
[50:17] here to give a give ideas of what who
[50:20] they are now we obviously know we've got
[50:21] the
[50:22] unbeliever okay now we've got the make
[50:24] believer
[50:26] uh we've got the remnant and the sheep
[50:28] and you'll find why I just called it
[50:29] sheep because the in the great we
[50:33] through judgment talks about the sheep
[50:34] and the goats so there's a there's sheep
[50:36] there and then you've got this you've
[50:39] got people called the friend of the
[50:40] Bride that receive a different judgment
[50:41] and then you've got the
[50:42] bride now everybody fits in one of those
[50:46] categories
[50:48] eventually okay now what I'm going to do
[50:50] is just go through these ones and just
[50:52] see how they would respond to judgment
[50:54] because we all get judged in this life
[50:57] now that's right there are many
[50:59] judgments that we face okay now the
[51:00] first one please now the unbeliever the
[51:04] unbeliever is a is a person that doesn't
[51:06] really care about the things of God
[51:07] whatsoever he couldn't care less
[51:11] and when the Judgment of God comes
[51:13] across his path to show maybe hey you're
[51:15] wrong maybe you shouldn't be doing those
[51:17] things he doesn't care there's nothing
[51:19] in him to respond to that judgment he
[51:21] doesn't care now the Romans 1:26 says
[51:24] for this cause God gave them up to vile
[51:26] affections for even their woman did
[51:27] change the natural use of that which is
[51:29] against nature and likewise also the men
[51:31] leaving the natural use of the woman
[51:33] burned in their lust toward one toward
[51:35] another men with men working that which
[51:37] is unseemly receiving in themselves the
[51:39] that recompense of the error which was
[51:41] met and even as they did not like to
[51:43] retain God in their knowledge God G gave
[51:45] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[51:46] those things which are not convenient
[51:48] being filled with all unrighteousness
[51:50] fornication
[51:52] wickedness covetousness maliciousness
[51:54] full of envy murdered debate deceit
[51:58] malignity Whisperers backb backbiters
[52:00] haters of God despiteful proud boasters
[52:03] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[52:05] Parents Without understanding Covenant
[52:07] Breakers without natural affection
[52:10] implacable unmerciful who knowing the
[52:12] Judgment of God that they which commit
[52:14] such things are worthy of death not only
[52:16] do the same but have pleasure in them
[52:17] that do them
[52:20] okay now these people don't care about
[52:22] God or his ways whatsoever they actually
[52:26] enjoy going against it now the Bible
[52:30] talks about them it says the Lord knowth
[52:32] how to deliver The Godly out of
[52:33] Temptation and to reserve the unjust
[52:35] until the day of judgment to be punished
[52:37] so now they may at some point get a get
[52:40] a a a judgment of God upon their life
[52:42] here to say look what you're doing is
[52:44] wrong but they will just turn it away
[52:45] and say I don't care yeah essentially
[52:48] they receive no more judgment here they
[52:50] just keep doing what they're doing and
[52:51] they enjoy it and what they're doing is
[52:53] storing up judgment against the day of
[52:54] Wrath so they're building up and account
[52:57] you wonder why the wicked man can do all
[52:58] these sorts of things and seem to get
[52:59] away with it and we do one thing we
[53:01] can't get away with it because they
[53:04] judge they're not getting away with it
[53:05] don't worry about that but it's being
[53:06] stored up against the day of Wrath
[53:08] that's what's happening they receed no
[53:10] more judgment that's what's happening
[53:11] there but after the Romans 2:5 says but
[53:14] after thy hardness and impenitent heart
[53:16] treasur up thyself wrath against the day
[53:18] of Wrath that's that's the Judgment at
[53:20] the end and the revelation of the
[53:22] righteous Judgment of God that's why
[53:24] David said don't look at the evil doer
[53:26] don't look at the choose none of his
[53:28] ways don't look at him and think he's
[53:29] doing that maybe I could do that and get
[53:31] away with it he said don't do that
[53:33] because there's judgment coming for them
[53:34] but they receive no no more there's a
[53:35] point where they receive no more
[53:36] judgment here aside from maybe you reap
[53:39] what you sow in terms of natural sense
[53:41] now brother Brown talks about the
[53:42] unbeliever with this here he says you
[53:44] remember years ago many of you he the
[53:46] old times remember that sermon I
[53:47] preached on the disappointments of
[53:48] judgment he said the Harlot she ain't
[53:50] going to be disappointed there she knows
[53:52] where she's going the drunkard ain't
[53:53] going to be disappointed there the
[53:54] bootleg The Gambler the liar the thief
[53:56] he's not going to be disappointed they
[53:58] know where they're going they know what
[53:59] they're doing they don't care that's the
[54:01] unbeliever okay move to the next
[54:04] one oh this is a story that I've got
[54:07] although this was there are times when
[54:09] they do get judged here just I I don't
[54:11] know why but they just do there was a
[54:13] brother Brown told a story about how him
[54:15] and a couple of about four other
[54:16] minister Brothers went to a city and
[54:20] um they were on one side of the street
[54:22] and they crossed over the street and
[54:24] they what you call walked across the
[54:26] street and there was a policeman down
[54:28] the road we ways and he said he said hey
[54:30] boys you're jay walking what do you
[54:32] think you're doing and they said jay
[54:34] walking what do you mean jay walking we
[54:36] we're from they were from Louisiana
[54:37] they're in another state they said we
[54:39] can walk anywhere we want to back home
[54:41] we didn't realize you couldn't jwalk
[54:42] here and he said no you you know you're
[54:44] not supposed to jwalk here you guys are
[54:46] just getting smart to me and you know
[54:47] you saw me there and there you just did
[54:48] this in front of me and he this
[54:49] policeman really started hassling
[54:51] brother Bram and his friends about
[54:52] jaywalking and and he really and they
[54:55] said to him look we're telling you the
[54:56] honest truth you know we're Ministers of
[54:57] the Gospel we're not we're not doing
[54:58] this to you know be smart to you we just
[55:02] didn't realized that we were doing this
[55:04] and so he really started heading into
[55:06] them once they said they ministers and
[55:07] oh here you guys call yourselves
[55:08] ministers and now look what you're doing
[55:10] these sorts of things and these brothers
[55:12] were trying to not argue back to him but
[55:14] State their cases to say look we were we
[55:17] were innocent we if we if we knew there
[55:18] was a rule we would have just maybe
[55:19] crossed over in a certain place he
[55:21] wouldn't believe them and he was really
[55:23] um hitting away at them and brother
[55:26] Brandon was starting to talk back too
[55:27] but he said something said to him just
[55:29] leave it alone he
[55:30] said
[55:32] um be not deceived and this the Holy
[55:35] Ghost gave him the scripture said be not
[55:36] deceived God is Not mock whatsoever man
[55:38] s that shall he also reap and so he just
[55:40] left it that and let this guy let off
[55:42] his Steam and he was he wanted to take
[55:44] him to court and all these sorts of
[55:45] things really nasty nasty man for no
[55:48] reason they stayed there for a couple of
[55:50] days and they they um when they went to
[55:53] go brother R and picked them up was
[55:54] going to pick them up from the the um
[55:56] where they stayed and they were driving
[55:58] along and then brother bam says and we
[55:59] started driving out and I took them back
[56:01] to the to their place about six blocks
[56:03] away or a little more and I came back
[56:05] around just in time to see the man this
[56:06] is the
[56:08] policeman um tried to run around the man
[56:11] making a right hand turn and was crushed
[56:12] under the wheels I stopped my car and
[56:13] pulled over to one side to be sure if
[56:16] that was a policeman and it was he'd run
[56:18] under a truck making a right hand turn
[56:20] policeman's fault slid his tire sideways
[56:22] went right through the big wheels of
[56:23] that truck there he was mashed up legs
[56:25] broke arms broke couldn't scream he's
[56:27] out unconscious pulled him out and then
[56:28] I stood there and thought now what about
[56:30] it so now he'll receive more judgment in
[56:33] the world to come but he also received
[56:35] the Judgment here um but that doesn't
[56:38] always happen like that like someone may
[56:40] do that to us and nothing happens to
[56:42] them but sometimes it does happen like
[56:44] um with the prophets in the bible and
[56:46] that okay the next one is
[56:48] the this is a really evil one here the
[56:50] make
[56:51] believer the unbeliever is not so bad
[56:54] because he doesn't pretend anything he's
[56:55] just he is who he is he's quite easy to
[56:57] deal with but the make believer I think
[56:59] is one of the most evil people you can
[57:02] get because they they are absolutely
[57:04] from Satan but they
[57:06] they pretend like they're from God and
[57:10] they're out to deceive good people that
[57:13] want to serve God and want to seek God
[57:16] and these people hinder them I think
[57:18] this is just these are the most evil
[57:19] people you can you can get now I'm not
[57:22] going to name any names but this group
[57:24] here cuz there are group and Jesus was
[57:26] blunt with them when he talk to them he
[57:27] said you're of your father the Devil
[57:29] he's talking to these make Believers
[57:31] that that are
[57:33] actually in infiltrated the church
[57:35] everywhere and the lust of your father
[57:37] you will do he was a murderer from the
[57:39] beginning and Abode not in the truth
[57:40] because there is no truth in him when he
[57:42] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[57:44] for he is a liar and the father of it
[57:47] now this group here don't
[57:50] have when the when the truth comes
[57:52] across their
[57:53] path I'll put it this way the the
[57:56] unbeliever just has to have a an idea
[57:58] that maybe there's a God and maybe you
[57:59] should behave yourself and that's enough
[58:01] for him to say I don't care there's no
[58:03] God I'll just do what I
[58:04] want these people here have to have a
[58:07] bit more of a
[58:08] judgment made to them to discern who
[58:11] they
[58:11] are so if you try and tell an unbeliever
[58:15] God sent a prophet he doesn't care
[58:17] whether there's a prophet or not that
[58:18] won't really affect him if you just say
[58:20] there is a God he'll say I don't care so
[58:23] saying there's a prophet is not going to
[58:25] affect him either either way he doesn't
[58:26] care about it but these people
[58:29] here the way that God has has has has
[58:32] put a separating line between these
[58:34] people he has to hone it down a bit more
[58:36] because they claim to be Christians and
[58:38] Believers you see so he has to hone it
[58:40] down a bit more and that's when we get
[58:41] into the area that we deal in a bit more
[58:43] which is recognizing your day and its
[58:45] message right you understand because
[58:47] it's got to come in and separate these
[58:49] people out it's it's Jesus came and he
[58:52] separated these people out who they were
[58:55] because he honed down into Christian
[58:57] things into religious things and and it
[58:59] was the word for that day was manifested
[59:01] you understand so that that these people
[59:03] show their Colors by their fruits you
[59:05] shall know them and and it's it's what
[59:08] they do with the word for their day
[59:09] discerns who they are you understand it
[59:11] has to come and it has to come and judge
[59:13] them that way and so this this word can
[59:15] come to them in the Right Through the
[59:17] Ages the the the Word of Life the
[59:19] message for the hour has come to them
[59:21] and they they will fight against it it
[59:23] has to manifest who they they will fight
[59:25] against it so they actually they receive
[59:26] opportunity for salvation hey do you
[59:28] want to come and accept the truth they
[59:30] say no we don't want that then they
[59:31] actively fight against it from then on
[59:35] you understand so they they received
[59:37] they received a judgment shown that hey
[59:38] you're wrong maybe you should go this
[59:40] way they said no I don't want that I'll
[59:41] go this way and then they actively fight
[59:43] against against God for the rest of
[59:46] their life okay and that's why Romans 66
[59:49] talks about if they shall fall away so
[59:51] they they maybe have an opportunity to
[59:54] start walking in these things and they
[59:55] say no I don't want it then it says if
[59:57] they shall fall away to renew them again
[59:59] to repentance seeing They Crucified to
[1:00:01] themselves the Son of God a fresh and
[1:00:02] put him to an open shame for the Earth
[1:00:06] which drinketh in the rain that cometh
[1:00:07] off upon it and bringeth forth herbs
[1:00:09] meat for them by whom it is dressed
[1:00:11] receiveth blessing from God but that
[1:00:13] which beareth thorns and briers is nigh
[1:00:15] to cursing whose end is to be burned now
[1:00:18] in them is a their Thorns to begin
[1:00:20] with right so even when they get this
[1:00:22] anointing all that brings forth a thorn
[1:00:24] it doesn't bring forth fruit because
[1:00:26] they're not actually one of gods now
[1:00:28] this sounds hard I'm not going to that's
[1:00:29] why I'm not mentioning any people but
[1:00:31] this is Godly principles that we have to
[1:00:33] look into go to the next
[1:00:35] one I just want to read this here from
[1:00:37] brother brandom he said now this this is
[1:00:39] a continu the last quote that we read
[1:00:41] watch it now it's not just purely old
[1:00:43] everyday sin committing
[1:00:45] adultery getting drunk using God's name
[1:00:47] in vain that's not it you remember years
[1:00:49] ago and here's the quote I read before
[1:00:50] many of you here the old times remember
[1:00:52] that sermon I preached on the
[1:00:53] disappointments that judgement the
[1:00:55] Harlot she ain't going to be
[1:00:56] disappointed there she knows where she's
[1:00:57] going the drunker ain't going to be
[1:00:59] disappointed there The Bootlegger The
[1:01:00] Gambler the liar the thief he's not
[1:01:01] going to be disappointed but the man who
[1:01:04] thinks he's right there's the
[1:01:05] disappointment that fellow that said he
[1:01:07] come said Lord have not I preached the
[1:01:09] gospel have not I cast out devils in thy
[1:01:11] name Jesus said depart from me ye that
[1:01:13] work iniquity I never know you there's a
[1:01:16] disappointment see that deceitfulness
[1:01:18] that's what I'm constantly this is what
[1:01:20] brother saying that's that's where I'm
[1:01:22] so misunderstood it's not that I want to
[1:01:23] be different of don't want to be
[1:01:25] different but I've got to be honest I
[1:01:26] have a message that must go to the
[1:01:27] people makes it very much misunderstood
[1:01:29] amongst the people they think I'm
[1:01:31] against everybody if they only knew I'm
[1:01:33] for everybody and try my best to bring
[1:01:35] them what's the truth just as it's laid
[1:01:37] on my heart and the way it's laid out in
[1:01:39] the Bible here and God proves that to be
[1:01:42] the truth so there's nothing else can be
[1:01:43] done about it so men either they look at
[1:01:46] it or they don't see they don't want to
[1:01:49] see it because they've already sold out
[1:01:50] sold their Birthright to some
[1:01:51] organization some denomination to tie
[1:01:54] their birth rights to get to heaven upon
[1:01:56] the basis of some organized religion
[1:01:57] which Satan is the head of every bit of
[1:01:59] it that sounds a bit like Jesus when he
[1:02:00] said you're of your father the Devil
[1:02:02] he's come along saying Satan's ahead of
[1:02:04] all this stuff and all I'm coming here
[1:02:06] is trying to actually help you to get
[1:02:07] out of it but of course the the make
[1:02:09] believer doesn't want out because
[1:02:11] there's nothing in them to get out God
[1:02:13] never did have an organized religion
[1:02:14] never did and they sell out to that so
[1:02:16] this is this is part of the battle that
[1:02:18] we and what we do we fight against this
[1:02:22] as well as the unbeliever now next one
[1:02:26] okay now in order to to not make it
[1:02:29] sound so hard there's also what they
[1:02:31] call there's the The Remnant and the
[1:02:33] Sheep now brother Brown talks about the
[1:02:37] foolish the wise and the foolish virgins
[1:02:39] and there's a there's a scripture about
[1:02:41] the wise and the foolish virgins now
[1:02:43] there are 10 virgins and the Bible says
[1:02:46] five are wise and five are
[1:02:48] foolish and when you look into it you
[1:02:51] think well both of these here are both
[1:02:53] these virgins doing the the best they
[1:02:54] can living as good as they can they both
[1:02:57] they're both essentially Christian
[1:02:59] people the the difference is half of
[1:03:01] them have the Holy Ghost and half of
[1:03:02] them don't and so when the Bride Comes
[1:03:05] to catch the bride away the ones with
[1:03:08] the Holy Ghost go with them but you've
[1:03:10] still got these five left that are
[1:03:12] actually very sincere and they they're
[1:03:13] doing the best that they can but they
[1:03:15] don't go into the
[1:03:16] wedding now these
[1:03:19] people it's hard wee bit to think about
[1:03:22] it but these people aren't lost they're
[1:03:25] not lost these brother Adam calls them
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:28] remnant and now they have to go through
[1:03:30] the tribulation there but they're not
[1:03:31] lost now Remnant he gives an example he
[1:03:34] says if a if a if a someone is making a
[1:03:37] dress and they've got a pattern and they
[1:03:39] get a big piece of cloth their pattern
[1:03:41] requires this piece and that piece and
[1:03:43] that piece so they sit out their pattern
[1:03:45] onto this piece of cloth and they cut
[1:03:47] out all of their pattern patterns that
[1:03:50] they need to sew their dress together
[1:03:52] and he said look it was all good cloth
[1:03:54] there was nothing wrong with the cloth
[1:03:56] all the cloth was good the only thing
[1:03:58] was he he just put his pattern on it and
[1:03:59] he only needed these pieces out of the
[1:04:01] cloth he doesn't really need the rest of
[1:04:03] the cloth to make the dress but it was
[1:04:05] good cloth it was he said it's just by
[1:04:07] election that he just chose these little
[1:04:10] pieces out of it but the rest of the
[1:04:11] cloth is still good now that's what the
[1:04:14] remnant is it's just not elected to be
[1:04:17] the bride but it's not going to be lost
[1:04:19] do you understand okay we don't need to
[1:04:22] read that one I just explain that one
[1:04:24] there next
[1:04:26] one now brother talks about this here
[1:04:29] and he says you might different a little
[1:04:31] with this but just but listen close just
[1:04:33] because you accepted Christ as personal
[1:04:35] savior that doesn't mean that you're
[1:04:36] going on the Rapture that's for the
[1:04:38] elect right with the Holy Ghost with the
[1:04:39] cloth there will be a Remnant left here
[1:04:42] on Earth that will go through the
[1:04:43] persecution and Great Tribulation the
[1:04:45] church will be caught up in the Rapture
[1:04:46] he's talking about the the bride will be
[1:04:48] caught up in the Rapture how many woman
[1:04:49] here doesn't know when you're going to
[1:04:52] cut a piece of goods you lay the goods
[1:04:53] out that's and lay your pattern on it
[1:04:55] like this and you cut the goods just
[1:04:56] according to the pattern is that right
[1:04:58] and the rest of the goods is just the
[1:04:59] same kind of goods that's in the pattern
[1:05:01] is that right but this is the kind you
[1:05:03] take you might lay that away for further
[1:05:05] use but but the goods that you cut out
[1:05:08] of who places a pattern God by election
[1:05:11] amen God by election places a Pat and he
[1:05:12] said now I've chosen you before the
[1:05:14] foundation of the world I know places
[1:05:16] here and there while Jesus told the
[1:05:18] disciples that he was with them and he
[1:05:19] had chose them and he knew them before
[1:05:21] the foundation of world was ever laid is
[1:05:23] that right so God placed is a pattern
[1:05:25] now there will be elect that'll go on
[1:05:26] the Rapture and there'll be a group of
[1:05:27] people that's good upright holy living
[1:05:29] God saved people that will that will not
[1:05:31] be in the Rapture but they will come up
[1:05:33] in the second
[1:05:34] Resurrection
[1:05:37] okay now the Sheep are also in that
[1:05:40] section as well now Romans 8:9 says but
[1:05:44] ye not in the flesh but in the spirit if
[1:05:45] so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:05:47] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:05:48] of Christ there is none of his
[1:05:51] now when you read that scripture with
[1:05:54] just understanding you realize one of
[1:05:55] his means one of his bride you know you
[1:05:58] you want one of his bride but there all
[1:06:00] there are people that are going to be in
[1:06:01] heaven that are not his bride but
[1:06:03] they're going to be there okay because
[1:06:05] you can't not everyone that say goes to
[1:06:09] the how would you put it there's the
[1:06:12] make believer and then there's people
[1:06:13] right throughout those organizations
[1:06:15] that are not make Believers but they're
[1:06:16] not they're not going to turn away
[1:06:18] everything but there's just nothing in
[1:06:19] them really to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:23] okay next one
[1:06:26] this is a story that brother brandham
[1:06:28] talked about and you'll find this
[1:06:30] interesting in light of what we just
[1:06:31] talked
[1:06:32] about um and I don't want to start a new
[1:06:35] doctrine of you know if you just do
[1:06:36] something good you're going to be saved
[1:06:37] it's not about that but nonetheless this
[1:06:39] is what the scripture say this is what
[1:06:40] brother Brown talked about brother Brown
[1:06:41] told a story about an old doctor and he
[1:06:44] said speaking to an old doctor yesterday
[1:06:46] one of my doctor friends Budd he's 80
[1:06:49] something years old he said and a
[1:06:50] sister-in-law here at the church tonight
[1:06:52] A sister-in-law is here at the church
[1:06:54] church tonight and this is what I want
[1:06:55] to look into and she's been just a teeny
[1:06:58] weeny bit worried about him so this is a
[1:07:00] sister going to church thinking and her
[1:07:02] brother is brother-in-law is is dying
[1:07:04] and and she's obviously thinking you
[1:07:06] know he's never really been a Christian
[1:07:08] or otherwise brother wouldn't say this
[1:07:10] so he said I'm a bit worried about him
[1:07:13] okay that's that's what this and I went
[1:07:15] to see him and as soon as I began to
[1:07:17] talk to him he brightened up told me
[1:07:18] about a hunting trip he had taken many
[1:07:20] years ago up in Colorado the very same
[1:07:22] country I hunted just as brilliant and
[1:07:23] bright and I said Doctor how long you
[1:07:25] been practicing and he said when you
[1:07:27] were nursing so well you were still
[1:07:28] breastfeeding I was practicing and way
[1:07:31] down I said and many a time he said I've
[1:07:33] practiced taking my buggy I put my
[1:07:35] saddle bags over my horse I took the
[1:07:37] little satchel and I've walked and I
[1:07:39] said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00
[1:07:42] in the morning with your flashlight
[1:07:43] trying to find a house where a little
[1:07:45] child had a tummy ache or a mother in
[1:07:47] labor pains he said that's right and I
[1:07:49] said you know doctor I believe across
[1:07:51] the this dividing line between here
[1:07:54] between Mortal and immortality God has a
[1:07:56] place for good old doctors that serve
[1:07:58] like that great tears came in his eyes
[1:08:00] and he started crying he reached up his
[1:08:01] feeble hands and said brother I hope so
[1:08:04] across the land god judges a man's Soul
[1:08:06] what he is then I gave him the
[1:08:08] satisfying scripture many times plowing
[1:08:10] through those dark muddy fields at night
[1:08:12] trying to help somebody maybe never get
[1:08:14] a penny for it but it's all right I said
[1:08:16] Jesus said in the scripture blessed are
[1:08:17] the merciful for they shall obtain
[1:08:20] Mercy okay now I can't just go and say
[1:08:23] this you'll be right cuz you did this
[1:08:25] nice thing nonetheless he he said here
[1:08:27] look God's going to judge this man
[1:08:29] according to his works and he told his
[1:08:32] sister-in-law just don't worry about it
[1:08:33] it's going to be all right
[1:08:36] okay
[1:08:37] now next one I want to give some other
[1:08:39] few
[1:08:40] examples who's heard of the chattam
[1:08:43] islands okay I've just used this as a we
[1:08:46] just to not that I know what's happening
[1:08:48] here or not that I know God's thoughts
[1:08:49] on it but it's an interesting story
[1:08:51] about this so the chattam islands are to
[1:08:53] the east of New
[1:08:54] Zealand and they were populated by uh uh
[1:09:00] um um tribe or I guess people called
[1:09:03] moror people and I think when they
[1:09:05] turned up they would have these
[1:09:06] intertribal they would have fights and
[1:09:07] that sort of thing but one of the Le
[1:09:10] Chiefs
[1:09:12] um saw the the Carnage that was
[1:09:15] happening when they were always fighting
[1:09:16] because it's not a massive
[1:09:17] Island um I think it's it's about the
[1:09:20] size of bigger than Lake Tapo but it's
[1:09:22] it's a reasonable size
[1:09:24] um so he he implemented
[1:09:28] rules about how they were supposed to
[1:09:30] live and he basically he said look we're
[1:09:33] not going to fight each other and kill
[1:09:34] each other that's not going to happen um
[1:09:37] and he made laws that look if you if you
[1:09:39] guys get into an argument if you want to
[1:09:40] have a have a fight he said because men
[1:09:43] get angry and during such anger feel the
[1:09:45] will to strike that that so they may but
[1:09:48] only with the rod the thickness of a
[1:09:50] thumb and one stretch of the arms length
[1:09:52] so they they're allowed to stick about
[1:09:54] that long and they said they can hit
[1:09:55] each other and he
[1:09:57] said but that on the abrasion of the
[1:09:59] height or the first sign of blood you
[1:10:01] stop that's it no more
[1:10:02] fighting and that he implemented a
[1:10:05] pacifist culture where you actually
[1:10:06] don't fight each other don't kill each
[1:10:07] other we're going to we're not going to
[1:10:09] do it and these Mori people live by that
[1:10:12] code all the way through now in the
[1:10:16] um the the
[1:10:18] 1800s a the moldi a lot of moldy guys
[1:10:23] from Teran I A Tribe hijacked a ship and
[1:10:25] they went across through the chattam
[1:10:27] islands and another ship followed after
[1:10:29] them there were hundreds of them there
[1:10:30] were thousands of moru moru on this
[1:10:33] island here and um the Marys began to
[1:10:37] slaughter
[1:10:38] them and the Mori had a meeting and some
[1:10:43] of them wanted to go and fight fight
[1:10:44] back at these marry Invaders but the
[1:10:48] Chiefs gathered around they said look we
[1:10:49] didn't just start this code you know it
[1:10:52] wasn't based on circumstance there this
[1:10:53] is how we operate so we're not going to
[1:10:55] fight back against these people so
[1:10:57] that's what they said now as a result
[1:10:59] the majority of them were slaughtered
[1:11:01] and and killed mercilessly on some of
[1:11:04] them on Stakes on the beach for days it
[1:11:07] was just it was an awful thing that
[1:11:08] happened to them but they didn't fight
[1:11:09] back because they live by this code that
[1:11:12] we're just not going to operate that way
[1:11:13] now I don't know when judgment comes
[1:11:15] what what's going to happen I don't know
[1:11:18] but but someone did something good for
[1:11:19] these people and said you're going to
[1:11:20] live like this and he would have saved
[1:11:22] many lives throughout the existence of
[1:11:24] that Nation by saying you're not going
[1:11:25] to kill each other now what will his
[1:11:28] judgment be I don't know but it'll come
[1:11:30] up before God at some point and and
[1:11:32] these people he'll be judged I don't
[1:11:34] know they didn't hear the gospel so far
[1:11:36] as I'm aware German missionaries came in
[1:11:38] after that so so this is just an example
[1:11:41] of there are circumstances that we know
[1:11:42] nothing of that God will be the judge of
[1:11:44] these sorts of things we don't know next
[1:11:47] one while I was looking at this I found
[1:11:50] this interesting article so I thought
[1:11:51] I'd put it up they found dinosaur bones
[1:11:54] there bones from a 4 ton meat eating
[1:11:57] dinosaur have been uncovered on the
[1:11:58] chattam islands they said Australian
[1:12:02] paleontologist Jeffrey Stillwell of
[1:12:03] Melbourne's monach University found a 2
[1:12:06] km long deposit of bones teeth and
[1:12:08] clawes and is already uncover more
[1:12:10] dinosaur fossils in the chattam islands
[1:12:12] than have been Unearthed in New Zealand
[1:12:14] over the past 25
[1:12:16] years question why are there dinosaur
[1:12:18] bones on a small island in the middle of
[1:12:20] nowhere cuz at one point it was land
[1:12:23] before the flood and there were many
[1:12:24] dinosaurs there I just thought that
[1:12:26] these people are saying oh that was when
[1:12:28] the land
[1:12:28] all continents drifted apart and no no
[1:12:33] no there was more land than what there
[1:12:34] was water at some point and there were
[1:12:35] heaps of dinosaurs around here and they
[1:12:37] found a lot of dinosaur bones I just
[1:12:39] thought put that in there that was
[1:12:41] interesting you know when you're doing
[1:12:43] these things you get sidetracked
[1:12:44] sometimes onto little
[1:12:46] stories next
[1:12:48] one now we've got the next people that
[1:12:51] we call that the friend of the bride now
[1:12:53] I want to give you some scriptures on
[1:12:55] here Mark 9:41 says for whosoever shall
[1:12:58] give you a cup of water to drink in my
[1:12:59] name because you belong to Christ verely
[1:13:01] I Stand to you he shall not lose his
[1:13:02] reward and we've got this one over here
[1:13:05] this is also the Sheep one but I'll just
[1:13:07] put in here and the King shall answer
[1:13:09] and sayto them verely verely I say unto
[1:13:10] you in as much as you have done it unto
[1:13:12] the least of these my brethren you have
[1:13:13] done it unto
[1:13:14] me the reason why I put this old man up
[1:13:16] there with a bag was because my father
[1:13:18] told me a story
[1:13:20] when um he
[1:13:22] was newly married and they maybe had one
[1:13:25] or two children and they lived on the
[1:13:26] west coast Inland from Hamilton towards
[1:13:30] um the west coast and my mother would
[1:13:33] have to take a bus into Hamilton or
[1:13:35] Huntley wherever it was to go shopping
[1:13:37] once every two weeks and she would come
[1:13:39] back with all her um shopping bags and
[1:13:41] she would have maybe one or two babies
[1:13:43] with her and there was a man that lived
[1:13:45] nearby where they lived an older man and
[1:13:47] it would happen that quite often he
[1:13:49] would be on this bus with her on the
[1:13:52] same Journey so um this old man would
[1:13:54] always help my mother carry all her bags
[1:13:57] and always help her to get to where she
[1:13:59] was going I don't think they really knew
[1:14:01] him that well but he would just do this
[1:14:03] towards them um and then my father says
[1:14:07] that um he was out um fencing one day
[1:14:11] and a thought came to him and said pray
[1:14:13] for that man and he thought well I'm
[1:14:16] just thinking that I'll just carry on
[1:14:17] doing my fencing and he said the thought
[1:14:19] came to me even more you need to pray
[1:14:20] for that man and so he thought well this
[1:14:22] must be the Lord saying something so
[1:14:24] he stopped fencing and he said oh what
[1:14:25] do I pray for for him about and and the
[1:14:28] S said to
[1:14:30] him and as much as you have done it to
[1:14:32] the least of the is my bre and You' have
[1:14:33] done it unto me so so he prayed for this
[1:14:35] man he said Lord I pray for him and as
[1:14:37] much as he's done it to the least he is
[1:14:38] my bre and he's done it unto me and he
[1:14:40] went home that night and my my mother
[1:14:43] said oh I just found out that s so
[1:14:46] passed away later on this afternoon
[1:14:49] something happened there something
[1:14:51] happened some transaction took took
[1:14:53] place there was some remembrance happen
[1:14:55] now that will come up at some point
[1:15:00] so there
[1:15:02] are look this is just a bit of advice if
[1:15:05] someone does something nice to you
[1:15:07] sometimes it's family and that thank God
[1:15:09] say Lord I thank you for that person a
[1:15:11] family member may just drop something
[1:15:12] off to you say Lord I Thank you for them
[1:15:14] doing that for me I really it really
[1:15:16] blessed me just speak it out there's
[1:15:18] people in my family that I that you know
[1:15:20] sometimes you you shouldn't say it but
[1:15:22] you lose a bit of Hope after a while but
[1:15:24] these people every now and then I've got
[1:15:26] some random package in the mail with all
[1:15:28] of the stuff for my children or
[1:15:29] something like that and I thought Lord I
[1:15:31] Thank you for this person that they did
[1:15:32] this for me this has been a real
[1:15:33] blessing towards me and and I know if if
[1:15:36] nothing else on the day of judgment I'll
[1:15:38] bring that up and I'll say yeah I
[1:15:39] actually got this package from this
[1:15:40] person and it will it will replay what
[1:15:41] happened that's just a just do that you
[1:15:44] just never know what it might do amen
[1:15:47] okay next
[1:15:49] one the judgment on those ones was I
[1:15:51] don't know how it works but they just
[1:15:53] they don't reject but they don't accept
[1:15:54] it's just I don't know how that one
[1:15:56] works so I can't say about the The
[1:15:58] Remnant or the friend of the Bride I
[1:16:00] can't really speak on that now the True
[1:16:03] Believer the True Believer has a way bit
[1:16:05] of a different journey in his life
[1:16:07] because
[1:16:08] now as does the unbeliever and the make
[1:16:11] believer he gets judgment come across
[1:16:13] his path saying that he's wrong
[1:16:14] something he shouldn't be living like
[1:16:16] this and that you know if he's walking
[1:16:18] away something convicts his heart okay
[1:16:22] now the difference with the with the
[1:16:23] True Believer is something in him says
[1:16:27] yes you know what I'm
[1:16:29] wrong and it starts to stir up in his
[1:16:32] heart and he can't rest until he he just
[1:16:35] okay he needs to know the answer then if
[1:16:36] I'm wrong what's the answer amen
[1:16:38] something in him just cries out for it
[1:16:40] he's made that way that's why in Acts
[1:16:43] 237 after Peter finished preaching those
[1:16:46] that the True Believers that had
[1:16:47] something in them to receive it they
[1:16:48] said that's the Bible says they are
[1:16:50] pricked to the heart something in them
[1:16:52] said yes
[1:16:54] for hundreds of people have said no no
[1:16:56] we don't want this but these men said
[1:16:58] yes and they said un to Peter and the
[1:17:01] rest of them men and Brethren what shall
[1:17:03] we do they not only are they convinced
[1:17:06] they're concerned brother B talks about
[1:17:07] convinced concerned there's something in
[1:17:08] them that they they want to they just
[1:17:11] okay what's the answer if I'm wrong I
[1:17:12] want to know how do I get right and they
[1:17:14] won't stop seeking and searching and
[1:17:16] pressing and doing this until they
[1:17:18] receive until they get the solution to
[1:17:20] the problem which is if I'm wrong I want
[1:17:22] to be right yeah because that's what's
[1:17:24] in them and acts 13:48 says and when the
[1:17:26] Gentiles heard this where after they
[1:17:28] heard Paul
[1:17:29] preach the whole bunch of people tried
[1:17:31] to Stone Paul but then other people said
[1:17:34] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:17:35] the Lord and as many as were ordained to
[1:17:37] eternal life
[1:17:39] believed now the True Believer has a has
[1:17:41] a nature in him that that he fulfills
[1:17:44] Luke 14:33 that says so likewise
[1:17:47] whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
[1:17:49] not all that he had he cannot be my
[1:17:51] disciple there's something in him that
[1:17:53] he knows come what may
[1:17:56] regardless it doesn't matter what I have
[1:17:58] to give up what obstacle will come in
[1:18:00] the way I don't care I want this he will
[1:18:04] fulfill that scripture now it doesn't
[1:18:06] mean that He will
[1:18:07] forsake but if if push comes to he's
[1:18:10] going to forsake everything he doesn't
[1:18:12] care amen if it's his wife he'll say
[1:18:15] well then if you don't want me to go
[1:18:16] this way I'm going this way anyway I
[1:18:18] don't
[1:18:19] care if it comes down to it he will just
[1:18:22] like Abraham was willing to sacrifice
[1:18:24] his own son because he wanted to follow
[1:18:26] the lord now that's the nature of the
[1:18:29] way that he is he will just say yes I'm
[1:18:32] going um and that's now brother talks
[1:18:35] about this here and the token he says
[1:18:37] now when you want eternal life you
[1:18:39] receive a token showing that the price
[1:18:41] has been paid it isn't the blood but
[1:18:43] it's the token of the blood it's the
[1:18:44] life itself amen then he says full
[1:18:46] obedience to the to the whole word of
[1:18:48] God to God's entire word will entitle
[1:18:50] you to this token now within the
[1:18:53] believer the True Believer is the desire
[1:18:55] to just yes I surrender all I'm going to
[1:18:56] be fully obedient to your word it's they
[1:18:59] just they just want to Something in them
[1:19:01] wants to and that's why they receive the
[1:19:02] Holy Ghost receive the token because
[1:19:04] they want to forsake all and just serve
[1:19:05] him when they receive this judgment they
[1:19:08] they press on towards it now how do you
[1:19:11] do it Peter still on the day of
[1:19:12] Pentecost repent every one of you and be
[1:19:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:19:15] the remission of sins and you shall
[1:19:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[1:19:18] token for the promises unto you and to
[1:19:20] your children to them the far off even
[1:19:21] as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:19:23] all so now we here are believers okay
[1:19:28] True Believers so now we receive this
[1:19:30] judgment and we've and it moves us and
[1:19:33] we we want to be right with God we want
[1:19:34] to we want to just forsake all and serve
[1:19:36] him
[1:19:38] okay now go to the next one right we had
[1:19:42] a sin issue in our life we we were
[1:19:44] separated from God and when we realized
[1:19:46] that we didn't want to be because part
[1:19:47] of us is supposed to be with him so now
[1:19:50] we we make this effort we just say Lord
[1:19:52] whatever I just want I want Mercy I want
[1:19:55] I want that so when we receive that
[1:19:57] mercy and we receive Holy Ghost we
[1:19:59] receive all of this that's dealing with
[1:20:01] the sin question in our life it's it's
[1:20:04] it it just disappears although we and
[1:20:08] the brother Ben talked about this last
[1:20:10] week some with a capital S and some with
[1:20:11] a lowercase s right because of that's
[1:20:13] the nature of how we
[1:20:15] operate John said and and the Book of
[1:20:17] Jesus says verely verely I say unto you
[1:20:19] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:20:21] him that sent me hath Everlasting life
[1:20:23] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:20:24] has passed from Death unto life okay
[1:20:27] whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[1:20:29] sin for he cannot sin because he is born
[1:20:32] of God this sin question with the
[1:20:35] capital S gets done away with dealt with
[1:20:37] for the believer he doesn't have any sin
[1:20:39] it's gone it's it's he accepts salvation
[1:20:42] he accepts the Holy Ghost and he becomes
[1:20:44] born of God sin and it doesn't matter
[1:20:48] what he does from then on he could no
[1:20:50] sin gets attributed to him whatsoever
[1:20:52] nothing he could ever do can never get
[1:20:53] put on his account his account gets
[1:20:55] closed you understand he closed account
[1:20:58] he sin is gone it
[1:21:00] doesn't he cannot commit sin a Christian
[1:21:03] doesn't sin full stop you understand
[1:21:07] they don't
[1:21:08] sin but then they still kind of do so
[1:21:11] you think well this is this is
[1:21:13] odd now this is then now because
[1:21:16] judgment came our way and we we accepted
[1:21:19] judgment we took we took that Judgment
[1:21:20] of God to say we're wrong we say yes
[1:21:22] we're wrong
[1:21:23] now this is where the believer has a a
[1:21:25] different Journey than the rest of the
[1:21:26] world and that we then begin to receive
[1:21:29] our judgment every day daily we start to
[1:21:31] receive judgment now that doesn't mean
[1:21:33] do we have a capital l sin no that's
[1:21:35] what we're talking about now the little
[1:21:36] sin it just it's sin but it's not
[1:21:38] getting put on our account but it's sin
[1:21:39] nonetheless but now it gets judged you
[1:21:42] sin you get judged sin judged sin judged
[1:21:44] that that's how it operates now with us
[1:21:46] and our natural life but it's doesn't
[1:21:48] mean oh I'm saved I'm not I'm saved I'm
[1:21:50] not no no you're saved period full stop
[1:21:53] this is now the little sin right and
[1:21:55] this is now where the chastisement comes
[1:21:57] into it and correction comes into the
[1:21:58] believer Hebrews 12:5 says and ye have
[1:22:01] forgotten exaltation what speaketh unto
[1:22:02] you as unto children my son despise not
[1:22:06] thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:22:07] faint when thou are rebuked of him for
[1:22:09] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth he's
[1:22:11] dealing with the little he's he's
[1:22:13] dealing with the same sin but it's just
[1:22:14] little sin it's it's no worse or better
[1:22:17] but it's just he starts dealing that way
[1:22:19] encourage every son whom he receiveth if
[1:22:22] ye your a chastening god dealth with you
[1:22:24] as Sons why because you're a Son of God
[1:22:26] you have received the Holy Ghost you're
[1:22:27] one of his for what son is he whom the
[1:22:30] father chasteneth not but if you be
[1:22:33] without chastisement whereof all all all
[1:22:36] the Believers are partakers then you are
[1:22:38] illegitimate us another word but yeah
[1:22:40] illegitimate and not Sons if you don't
[1:22:42] receive this it shows that you're
[1:22:43] actually not a son of God so the the
[1:22:45] make believer doesn't receive this this
[1:22:47] chastisement as what we would my father
[1:22:50] was walking along he told me another
[1:22:54] story
[1:22:57] and I've forgotten it I won't tell it
[1:22:59] sorry if it comes back to me I'll tell
[1:23:04] it y it's back to
[1:23:08] me a
[1:23:10] um I forgot it again sorry I won't tell
[1:23:13] there was a bit of a
[1:23:14] [Laughter]
[1:23:16] flip-flop it was a very good story but
[1:23:18] I'll maybe a tell Fellowship move on to
[1:23:20] the next one please so now now this is
[1:23:22] what happens now to the believer for the
[1:23:24] time has come that judgment must begin
[1:23:26] at the house of God and if it first
[1:23:28] begin at us what shall the end be to
[1:23:31] them that obey not the gospel of God we
[1:23:34] begin to receive judgment daily in our
[1:23:36] lives and the Bible says but when we are
[1:23:38] judged judged for all these things we
[1:23:41] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[1:23:42] not be condemned with the world now that
[1:23:45] doesn't mean we're judged the
[1:23:46] condemnation but we're judged because
[1:23:47] we're one of his okay now I want to just
[1:23:51] um now no doubt if if you've been a
[1:23:54] partaker of this you know that you do
[1:23:56] something you
[1:23:57] think if you do something wrong you
[1:24:00] think ouch okay something's on its way
[1:24:04] I'll be very surprised if I get away
[1:24:05] with this one you just know now that's
[1:24:09] because you're a son and daughter of God
[1:24:11] okay listen to Brother Andy he knows all
[1:24:13] about
[1:24:15] this you brother
[1:24:18] hey some of us take a you know you got
[1:24:20] children some are quite I and they
[1:24:23] they're more submissive and some are a
[1:24:24] bit more harder they need to be whipped
[1:24:25] into shape a bit more
[1:24:29] brothery I want to give you a few
[1:24:31] examples of this just to you'll have
[1:24:32] these in your own life but these are
[1:24:34] kind of comical but they are this is
[1:24:36] want to show you how the Lord deals I've
[1:24:38] had some very harder dealings where the
[1:24:40] Lord's I've had big price to pay for
[1:24:43] things but other things like this it's
[1:24:44] it's a bit
[1:24:45] more it's not humorous because it was
[1:24:48] still annoying to go through but these
[1:24:50] are examples I want to show you about
[1:24:51] this one um go to the next
[1:24:56] [Laughter]
[1:25:00] one this is a recent
[1:25:05] one no tomorrow
[1:25:10] so um I they brought in a new rule in
[1:25:14] New Zealand that says you can't talk on
[1:25:16] your phone while you're driving and now
[1:25:18] I had a bad habit of talking on my phone
[1:25:20] while I was driving cuz I just always
[1:25:22] had to
[1:25:23] talk to people while I was driving
[1:25:24] because it's a good time you get in a
[1:25:26] car and you're driving for an hour it's
[1:25:27] the time to catch up on all your phone
[1:25:28] calls and that so when the rule
[1:25:31] changed I didn't really change with it
[1:25:34] and I think I got two fines over the
[1:25:37] course of about 18 months for driving
[1:25:39] with my using my cell phone
[1:25:42] now but I just kept on doing it because
[1:25:44] I kind of had to it was just such a
[1:25:45] habit and I i' um phone people I check
[1:25:48] my texts check my emails check the bank
[1:25:50] whatever do just do business man you get
[1:25:52] a lot done in an hour driving from
[1:25:54] Wellington to carpy
[1:25:56] Coast um
[1:25:58] now the funny thing was when I would go
[1:26:00] into prayer in the evenings I would say
[1:26:03] you know you want to just get into an
[1:26:05] atmosphere and then and you want to say
[1:26:06] Lord is there anything that I'm doing
[1:26:07] that's that's not right you know it's
[1:26:08] not pleasing to you that I could um that
[1:26:11] you want to show me
[1:26:14] and a thought would come up you got to
[1:26:16] stop talking on your phone while you're
[1:26:18] driving it's a bad testimony you just
[1:26:20] got to stop it's not right that's people
[1:26:22] look at you and say here he's a
[1:26:23] Christian look at him driving around
[1:26:24] talking on his phone but God didn't
[1:26:27] explain like that he just said you got
[1:26:28] to stop doing that I'll stop doing that
[1:26:30] I'm sorry and I'll do it the next day
[1:26:32] then the next night I say that's right I
[1:26:34] did it today I'll stop doing
[1:26:36] that but there wasn't really enough in
[1:26:38] me to really give it up because it was
[1:26:39] just so convenient to talk on my phone
[1:26:42] and I but but every time I would do it I
[1:26:43] would think I'm sure there's going to be
[1:26:45] something happened because I'm doing
[1:26:46] this it just this is just getting a bit
[1:26:48] too easy to do it doesn't seem to be
[1:26:49] very many consequences for this it's
[1:26:51] what I started thinking
[1:26:56] so yeah no it doesn't really work that
[1:26:59] way because God wants to improve us amen
[1:27:03] that's what he wants to do he's not just
[1:27:04] going to leave us a good parent doesn't
[1:27:05] just leave us so now one day I'm driving
[1:27:08] along into going to appointment in the
[1:27:11] city and um I'm talking to brother Ian
[1:27:13] on the phone you know we having to catch
[1:27:15] up in the
[1:27:16] morning and I'm driving along and I see
[1:27:20] a I see a sign on the overhead
[1:27:24] um barrier on the motorway and it says
[1:27:28] accident head take extra care and and I
[1:27:32] I
[1:27:33] think and I
[1:27:36] think brother andyw love for me to send
[1:27:39] him a picture of that because he hates
[1:27:41] people crashing on the motorway he
[1:27:43] thinks what sort of a stupid person
[1:27:45] would crash on the motorway what sort of
[1:27:47] drivers are they you know that's just a
[1:27:48] Motorway you're just driving along don't
[1:27:50] crash it's so simple and yet they crash
[1:27:52] Hold Me Up Hold everyone up so I'm
[1:27:54] talking to about the Ann on the phone I
[1:27:55] think oh bro hang on I just got to
[1:27:57] there's a funny sign up the head I'm
[1:27:59] just going to start my photo on my phone
[1:28:01] and I'll just take a picture of that cuz
[1:28:02] I'm going to send it through to Brother
[1:28:03] Andy because he'll he'll think that's
[1:28:04] funny so I say wait there a minute so as
[1:28:07] I'm talking to him I'm getting my photo
[1:28:09] out right and I take a photo of that and
[1:28:11] I look down at it I think now it's too
[1:28:14] small I can't quite see the sign so I
[1:28:16] hang on brother in so I go to the next
[1:28:17] one hang on oh no no one before that oh
[1:28:21] go one more before
[1:28:23] yeah that's the first one okay so I
[1:28:25] think it's a bit too small I can't see
[1:28:27] the he won't recognize the sign so I
[1:28:30] take it up and take another one that's
[1:28:31] about pretty good there get a bit closer
[1:28:33] yeah I'll take a photo next one there
[1:28:34] yep it's pretty good then I put my phone
[1:28:37] down I look ahead of me and there's a
[1:28:38] car stopped
[1:28:40] there
[1:28:43] bang I crashed into him the minute I
[1:28:46] crashed I thought I knew it I knew it I
[1:28:49] knew it that was me I just I knew I'd
[1:28:52] pay for this at some point I I just I
[1:28:55] there was getting out of hand talking
[1:28:56] and photos and you know it was all on I
[1:28:58] just thought no I I knew I'd pay for
[1:29:01] this and he was mad rightfully so he was
[1:29:03] angry and I just took it all he was just
[1:29:05] angry at me getting out of the car and I
[1:29:07] said what can you say you know what it's
[1:29:10] happened his car wasn't too badly
[1:29:12] damaged
[1:29:13] but I want to tell you this here too now
[1:29:17] I started talking to that he called the
[1:29:18] police and I had to give my
[1:29:20] statement and I thought thought oh man
[1:29:22] I'm going to be in trouble for this with
[1:29:25] the police as well so I started saying I
[1:29:27] said I was just driving along and I was
[1:29:29] going to change lanes and then I looked
[1:29:30] there was a car there and I just hit him
[1:29:33] and the policeman said yeah yeah yeah
[1:29:35] that's he was a young guy said yeah this
[1:29:37] is nothing just happens about once or
[1:29:40] twice a day yeah yeah just another day
[1:29:42] in the office somebody said to me you
[1:29:44] didn't tell him the whole truth of what
[1:29:46] happened and I I had to sign a statement
[1:29:48] right and I signed it and someone said
[1:29:50] to me if you don't tell them the truth
[1:29:51] you're going to pay for this one too I
[1:29:53] thought oh man I I'm I could probably
[1:29:55] just not tell him then ring him up
[1:29:57] afterwards and I thought the effort I'm
[1:29:58] going to have to go through to try and
[1:29:59] retract my statement and all that I
[1:30:01] thought oh man this is going to be tough
[1:30:02] but some said you got to tell him the
[1:30:04] truth so he came back over and I said
[1:30:07] hey um can I just add a wee bit more to
[1:30:08] my
[1:30:10] statement he goes yeah yeah sure and I
[1:30:13] said to him look this is what I was
[1:30:14] doing man I was driving along I said I
[1:30:16] was talking on the phone to my my friend
[1:30:18] and then I saw a sign that said accident
[1:30:19] and I and I started the photo up and I
[1:30:21] took a photo I was taking photos with my
[1:30:23] phone as well as talking on it and then
[1:30:25] when I looked up I crashed into the sky
[1:30:28] and this man
[1:30:30] says the polican
[1:30:32] says
[1:30:34] look he didn't know what to say he's
[1:30:36] like look I'm not going to put that in
[1:30:38] there he said
[1:30:40] look I appreciate that you've told me
[1:30:42] that but that's going to create a whole
[1:30:43] lot of work for me I'm going to have to
[1:30:45] take you through the court system and
[1:30:46] that he said I just I'm too busy to do
[1:30:49] that but he walked away came back he
[1:30:51] said look that was one in a million no
[1:30:53] one's ever did that to me before he
[1:30:55] said he
[1:30:57] said he said well okay but I really
[1:31:00] appreciate your honesty man good yeah
[1:31:02] and I said so he let me off he said look
[1:31:04] that's yeah look don't worry about it
[1:31:06] it's done I'm just going to leave it the
[1:31:07] way it is this will just go away but so
[1:31:10] I'm glad I was honest about that one
[1:31:11] because I would have got something else
[1:31:13] I haven't had this car for two or three
[1:31:15] months man I get it back tomorrow at
[1:31:16] 12:00 I got a text so I've had to it's
[1:31:18] been a bit of a price to pay so I try
[1:31:20] not to use my phone I'm driving
[1:31:26] anymore yeah yeah that's what it's yeah
[1:31:28] yeah yeah yeah this one here it
[1:31:31] actually I'm not
[1:31:34] um have I got time for one more real
[1:31:36] quick on okay you may have heard this
[1:31:38] one but some of you may have not I think
[1:31:40] I've said it once here but it goes well
[1:31:42] with this with the story of how the Lord
[1:31:43] just gets us to a spot so I this was
[1:31:46] back in Gisborne maybe eight seven eight
[1:31:48] years ago and there was a young guy that
[1:31:50] started working for me and he was
[1:31:52] uh trying to be a Christian so he after
[1:31:54] a while he came to me and said can you
[1:31:55] help me in my walk with the Lord can you
[1:31:58] disciple me a bit because he saw that I
[1:31:59] was maybe quite steady in the Lord he
[1:32:01] said can you help me I want you to help
[1:32:03] me toop me in the Lord and help me to
[1:32:04] get my walk stable and that sort of
[1:32:05] thing so I said yeah I can help you with
[1:32:06] that so so that was our relationship but
[1:32:09] he worked for me too and um one day him
[1:32:12] and my brother was supposed to be on a
[1:32:14] job and they were supposed to go to this
[1:32:15] job and that job and that job and they
[1:32:16] just weren't where they were supposed to
[1:32:17] be and I don't know when sometimes you
[1:32:20] just get angry with the stuff cuz people
[1:32:22] are ringing you up they want to know
[1:32:23] where's this guy where's that guy and
[1:32:24] you can't they're not there and you
[1:32:25] can't get hold of them and you just get
[1:32:26] angry well I did at that point anyway
[1:32:29] frustrated to the word I'm
[1:32:31] frustrated look I've never been so angry
[1:32:33] for a long time and and now this is what
[1:32:36] I did I think I told you some of you
[1:32:37] this before I got so angry in the car
[1:32:39] that I I just I couldn't hold in my
[1:32:42] frustration with the situation any
[1:32:43] longer that I swore out loud in the car
[1:32:45] no one was in there just
[1:32:46] me I was so angry and I sort of thought
[1:32:50] I wonder if that was bad
[1:32:53] and I I drove along and I thought well
[1:32:54] if no one's really there to hear it I
[1:32:55] wonder if it's actually wrong cuz I
[1:32:57] didn't swear I didn't do it to anybody
[1:32:59] cuz I I don't swear these guys never
[1:33:00] heard me but I I thought it was I was
[1:33:03] trying to reason it so it's probably
[1:33:05] okay you probably get away with this
[1:33:07] one but then a scripture came to me let
[1:33:10] no corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:33:12] your mouth well even though there's no
[1:33:14] one to hear it it still came
[1:33:16] out no but that wasn't really enough I
[1:33:18] was still angry but wild about it I was
[1:33:21] worked up and then I finally got hold of
[1:33:23] the guy I rang him up I said hey where
[1:33:25] are you guys man so I found out where
[1:33:28] they were and they were somewhere they
[1:33:29] shouldn't be and they were just having a
[1:33:31] lunch and I said cool man sweet see you
[1:33:34] later I'll catch you later on I was so
[1:33:35] angry I put the phone down on the side
[1:33:38] of the car I was parked up put it down
[1:33:39] there and I was angry and I went and I
[1:33:42] did it once more about twice I was
[1:33:46] angry and
[1:33:48] then then I thought I'll better calm
[1:33:50] down I ring my brother see where he is
[1:33:52] so I picked up the phone and it was
[1:33:53] still on I hadn't hung
[1:33:55] up no no sorry sorry i' I left a message
[1:33:58] with him sorry I left a message on his
[1:34:00] phone that's what it was I left a
[1:34:02] message I said can you come and see can
[1:34:04] you get back to me I need to know where
[1:34:05] you are straight away actually sorry
[1:34:06] that's what it was and I put the phone
[1:34:07] down then I went to pick it up again I
[1:34:09] thought it's still recording a message
[1:34:11] on his
[1:34:12] phone oh I thought no you know the
[1:34:15] scripture gave to me before now I just
[1:34:16] did it again now I've recorded it onto
[1:34:18] this young guy's phone that I'm trying
[1:34:19] to disciple in the Lord I thought oh man
[1:34:21] this say I'm in a awful State I thought
[1:34:23] the Lord's got me you wouldn't believe
[1:34:25] what I did so I went around to the place
[1:34:26] where I thought they were I turned up
[1:34:28] there now the reason why I he didn't ask
[1:34:30] for his phone it's because he was
[1:34:31] sitting there and I was like whoa oh
[1:34:32] there's his phone okay there's
[1:34:34] opportunity here to maybe get rid of the
[1:34:36] evidence so I took his phone and I was
[1:34:39] like I didn't cuz I thought man I've got
[1:34:41] this reputation to keep up now I'm sworn
[1:34:43] on his answer machine I I can't do this
[1:34:46] so
[1:34:47] I I went down to the warf I thought do I
[1:34:51] do it
[1:34:52] do I just Chuck his phone and then when
[1:34:54] and he wonders where it's gone I'll say
[1:34:55] oh look bro it's a shame about your
[1:34:56] phone look look you work for me I'll buy
[1:34:58] another one you know have yeah you know
[1:35:00] so I thought I'll justify it by buying
[1:35:01] him one the things they trying to do to
[1:35:04] cover Your Tracks
[1:35:05] so then I thought
[1:35:08] no I thought no give up just give it all
[1:35:11] up you put his phone back and tell him
[1:35:13] the truth I said okay right so I went
[1:35:16] back put his phone back and I said look
[1:35:17] bro this is what I did you're going to
[1:35:19] have a message on your phone I was angry
[1:35:20] I and I just conf to him and he said hey
[1:35:23] he actually really appreciated that that
[1:35:25] he said man this is good I I I respect
[1:35:27] you for doing that and so I'm having to
[1:35:29] confess to a younger guy of course then
[1:35:31] he said ah I'll check my message
[1:35:33] now but but look I paid for it that's
[1:35:37] just the way that it went now we have
[1:35:39] those experiences in our life that we we
[1:35:41] have to
[1:35:42] deal now so that these are light-hearted
[1:35:45] ones to agree I still had to pay a price
[1:35:46] but there are other ones that I've paid
[1:35:47] more of a price than than that but when
[1:35:50] we do what's right the Lord ALS also
[1:35:51] blesses us you remember brother B
[1:35:53] talking about the girl that in her
[1:35:55] school she stood up for what was right
[1:35:57] and the other girls were hesting her but
[1:35:58] she stood up for what was right I think
[1:35:59] in the school picture they wanted her to
[1:36:00] dress a certain way she said no I want
[1:36:01] to I want to dress like this and she
[1:36:04] stood out a bit in the school photo and
[1:36:06] then I think the next month or something
[1:36:09] later she won a big competition the big
[1:36:11] sign competition or came second and
[1:36:13] brother Brandon went and said to her she
[1:36:14] said he said she he said you won that
[1:36:16] because of what you did back there God
[1:36:17] actually blessed you for that so it
[1:36:19] doesn't just go that way it goes both
[1:36:20] ways now we're not earning our way to
[1:36:22] heaven but just as much as we can
[1:36:24] displease God we can actually and we can
[1:36:27] grieve the Holy Ghost we can actually
[1:36:29] live at peace with God and be at peace
[1:36:30] with the Holy Ghost and yeah just like a
[1:36:33] relationship you know there's things you
[1:36:34] can do in your relationship with your
[1:36:35] wife to make it good or Worse okay so
[1:36:38] that and that's it's not works but it's
[1:36:39] actually love okay next one I want to
[1:36:41] carry on we've got a little
[1:36:45] bit we're going to make it through this
[1:36:47] we've got 20 minutes left we'll get it
[1:36:49] through now the the
[1:36:53] we were dealing with these are this area
[1:36:55] in here okay now we're coming up now to
[1:36:56] the the um tribul the next major
[1:36:59] judgment is the
[1:37:01] Tribulation if I had two parts I'd
[1:37:03] probably stop it here and do the next
[1:37:05] one another time
[1:37:06] but go to the next one brother
[1:37:09] Andy
[1:37:10] now now after all this is finished
[1:37:13] there's a judgment on its way now
[1:37:15] heading to us and we're in the
[1:37:17] beginnings of it called the Great
[1:37:18] Tribulation now it's judgment upon this
[1:37:20] world
[1:37:22] because the cup of the iniquity of the
[1:37:24] Gentiles is becoming full and it's just
[1:37:27] there's judgment on its way severe
[1:37:30] judgment and it's it's the Judgment of
[1:37:32] the Great Tribulation now if you
[1:37:34] remember the five different people that
[1:37:35] we had back in the beginning there's
[1:37:37] only one group that doesn't go through
[1:37:39] this before this happens there's a
[1:37:40] Rapture but all of the rest of the
[1:37:42] people have got to face this judgment
[1:37:44] that's coming but but but brother bam
[1:37:46] I'll go through the next one brother B
[1:37:48] talks about it he says I believe that
[1:37:50] the church goes through the tribul
[1:37:51] period Church organization but the bride
[1:37:53] does not would you choose a woman you
[1:37:55] had to purify before you married
[1:37:57] her God's bride is chosen and she's
[1:38:00] elected and she's God's bride the Bride
[1:38:02] of Jesus Christ and he talks about the
[1:38:04] Judgment as a purification time for the
[1:38:06] for the foolish virgin for these for
[1:38:08] this in Revelations 22 talks about the
[1:38:10] tribulation it says he that is unjust
[1:38:13] let him be unjust still he which is
[1:38:14] filthy let him be filthy still he which
[1:38:16] is that is righteous let him be
[1:38:18] righteous still and he that is Holy let
[1:38:19] him be holy still because after the
[1:38:21] bride's
[1:38:22] gone salvation that the door for Mercy
[1:38:25] for opportunity for salvation is done so
[1:38:28] the way that you are is the way you'll
[1:38:29] stay and that's what the scripture says
[1:38:31] if you're if you're this way you'll just
[1:38:33] stay that way you'll go through it this
[1:38:34] way if you're righteous you'll go
[1:38:35] through it that way but but you're not
[1:38:37] going to come and change the status of
[1:38:39] who you are from now this is the way
[1:38:41] this is the way you're going to head
[1:38:42] into this great judgment period next
[1:38:47] one next next one please um now now I've
[1:38:51] got these I've got these quotes that
[1:38:53] brother Brown talked about cuz he he he
[1:38:55] says look it's Mana going to mana's
[1:38:57] actually going to blow himself up he's
[1:38:59] going to bring it on himself and he he
[1:39:01] talks a lot about how it's going to be
[1:39:03] an atomic event that's just that's the
[1:39:05] way it's going to happen now I've got
[1:39:07] these quotes as you read through all the
[1:39:08] quotes you realize it's this he talks a
[1:39:09] lot about this Jesus even said as it was
[1:39:12] in the days of no we in eight Souls were
[1:39:14] saved by water so shall I be the coming
[1:39:15] of the son of man all of all this you
[1:39:18] see walking on the street is Canon
[1:39:20] fodder that's Atomic fod only laid in
[1:39:23] there for judgment the Rapture comes
[1:39:24] here will be scarce few straight As the
[1:39:26] gate and narrow as the way and but few
[1:39:29] they will be that find it for broad is
[1:39:30] the road that leads to destruction and
[1:39:31] many there be that go and there at he's
[1:39:34] talking about the tribulation he's
[1:39:35] saying pretty much what you see here is
[1:39:37] is atomic fodder that's a hard statement
[1:39:39] but he's saying the bride's going to go
[1:39:41] and then it's just it's just fod for the
[1:39:43] atomic bombs just to blow the whole
[1:39:44] thing up that's a hard statement but
[1:39:46] that's it and he says the world's
[1:39:48] hanging Yonder the atomic bombs is in
[1:39:50] the hangers and God speaking through his
[1:39:52] servants into the churches and pulling
[1:39:54] them out and showing the signs that he
[1:39:55] promised he would do just before the
[1:39:56] coming where at the end time the token
[1:39:58] is required so he's getting his people
[1:40:02] and and and selling them in to get them
[1:40:04] out before before all this stuff happens
[1:40:06] he's saying these atomic bombs are all
[1:40:07] just hanging there ready to go they're
[1:40:09] in the hangers next one I've got four of
[1:40:11] these just to cement it in next
[1:40:14] one when that radar screen picks up that
[1:40:17] atomic bomb when they when when some
[1:40:20] country sees the first one going he says
[1:40:22] every one of them is going to turn loose
[1:40:24] it's going to happen wow if you fire one
[1:40:26] at me boom I fire one back but the
[1:40:30] church will be gone before that so that
[1:40:31] could so if that can happen any minute
[1:40:33] and the church has to go before that
[1:40:34] happens how far is it off and the Very
[1:40:36] things that he said would happen as a
[1:40:37] Ministry and what would take place in
[1:40:39] the last days we watch it night after
[1:40:40] night and day after day saying the time
[1:40:42] is at hand oh we ought to Humble
[1:40:43] ourselves and get in humility and get
[1:40:45] into action these things are sitting in
[1:40:47] the
[1:40:48] hangers the next one the atomic bomb are
[1:40:51] in the hangers everything sitting ready
[1:40:53] and God before he can let this thing
[1:40:54] happen he makes a call down through like
[1:40:56] he did in Sodom come out of it get ready
[1:40:58] there's something going to
[1:41:00] happen this is where we this the time we
[1:41:02] dwell in next
[1:41:05] one okay now this is talking about the
[1:41:09] battle of
[1:41:10] Armageddon and he gathered them together
[1:41:12] into a place in the Hebrew tongue
[1:41:14] Armageddon and and the seventh angel
[1:41:16] poured out his violin to the air and
[1:41:18] there came a great voice out of the
[1:41:19] Temple of Heaven from the throne saying
[1:41:21] it is done and there were voices and
[1:41:23] Thunders and Lightnings and there was a
[1:41:24] great earthquake such as was not since
[1:41:26] men were upon the Earth so mighty an
[1:41:28] earthquake and so great and the great
[1:41:30] city was divided into three parts and
[1:41:32] the cities of the Nations fell and great
[1:41:34] Babylon came in remembrance before God
[1:41:36] to receive judgment to give unto her the
[1:41:39] cup of the wine of the fierceness of his
[1:41:42] wrath and every island fled away and the
[1:41:44] mountains were not found and there fell
[1:41:47] upon men a great hail Out of Heaven
[1:41:48] every stone about the weight of a talent
[1:41:50] and Men blessed blem God because of the
[1:41:51] plague of the hail for the plague
[1:41:53] thereof was exceeding great
[1:41:56] now now the the the tribulation period
[1:41:59] is starting to set in now but when the
[1:42:00] bride goes it it just sets in and it
[1:42:02] culminates in this thing that we call
[1:42:05] Armageddon it just it's just
[1:42:08] Annihilation brother R says it's finally
[1:42:11] winding up into the great battle of
[1:42:12] Armageddon that will be the last of it
[1:42:14] when she comes to the battle of
[1:42:15] Armageddon that will settle the whole
[1:42:16] thing just before the great Millennium
[1:42:18] Armageddon is to clean off the Earth she
[1:42:20] rep purifies itself with this Atomic
[1:42:22] blowing with the and the volcanic ash
[1:42:25] and thing sinks the soaked blood of men
[1:42:27] upon the Earth and sin and crime she
[1:42:28] sinks beneath the Earth the volcanic
[1:42:30] breaks out again and renews and cleans
[1:42:32] the Earth for the great Millennium he
[1:42:33] cleans his church during that time for a
[1:42:35] people to live here
[1:42:37] amen so
[1:42:40] um the tribulation culminates with this
[1:42:43] event that just annihilates what he
[1:42:45] called Atomic fod now yeah I want to
[1:42:47] talk about this is just to make it
[1:42:49] reality to us the these are these are
[1:42:51] the countries that have the atomic bombs
[1:42:53] and Russia's got more than America
[1:42:55] Russia has
[1:42:57] 8,500 estimate and America's Got 7,700
[1:43:01] the other countries have a few you know
[1:43:02] up to 300
[1:43:04] France Pakistan they don't know how many
[1:43:06] Israel has it doesn't really disclose
[1:43:08] the information
[1:43:10] but between America and
[1:43:13] um
[1:43:15] Russia what's that 15
[1:43:18] 16,000 there's a lot of atomic bombs and
[1:43:20] these are
[1:43:21] these are in submarines they're in
[1:43:23] hangers they're just they're all sitting
[1:43:25] there you push that button these things
[1:43:29] go it's there's enough Firepower to just
[1:43:32] blow us up done that's the end of story
[1:43:35] right that's where brother R says that's
[1:43:37] where science will take us go to the
[1:43:39] next one and just to make it real they
[1:43:41] they're all sitting in the the red ones
[1:43:43] are actually where they got major um
[1:43:45] Americans have got major um missile like
[1:43:49] in the hangers yeah and the blue
[1:43:51] the green are nuclear power stations the
[1:43:52] blue are um where they they make the
[1:43:55] bombs and that sort of thing but but the
[1:43:57] country look they're all across the
[1:43:59] country they're sitting there waiting
[1:44:00] and they're on what they brother talk
[1:44:03] calls about the hangers which they're
[1:44:04] actually they're they're in like silos
[1:44:06] in the ground and and it's a it's all
[1:44:10] CAU anded off and these these nuclear
[1:44:11] warheads are just sitting in these silos
[1:44:14] and they always ready to be launched at
[1:44:15] any point and they've got a lot in the
[1:44:16] nuclear submarines out in the oceans and
[1:44:19] that but these these things as we speak
[1:44:21] today are sitting there ready to the
[1:44:23] button to be pushed now I got this photo
[1:44:25] because when you think about this this
[1:44:28] this is actually an artist rendition of
[1:44:30] of a a a nuclear bomb coming out of one
[1:44:33] of these solos out of the ground it may
[1:44:35] just be a a normal day just it's out in
[1:44:38] the field it's the grass everything is
[1:44:40] there it's it's another day in the life
[1:44:42] of the world but you imagine when this
[1:44:45] happens when when this bomb leaves that
[1:44:47] Silo Something's Happened to cause it to
[1:44:49] leave it it's it's it's the beginning of
[1:44:52] the end of all things it's just it's
[1:44:54] done this thing's sitting there when it
[1:44:56] leaves that's it there won't be another
[1:44:59] there won't be many more tomorrows after
[1:45:00] this happens and and there's destruction
[1:45:04] coming from these things that just wipe
[1:45:06] things out Atomic fod it it's doing away
[1:45:11] with everything and the ability to do it
[1:45:13] is now God doesn't need to send down
[1:45:15] fire and brimstone we we've got it all
[1:45:18] to do it all
[1:45:19] ourselves and
[1:45:21] these are just ideas of everything we
[1:45:24] see has got judgment impending upon it
[1:45:28] everything that we see here next one and
[1:45:31] it talks about earthquakes there's going
[1:45:32] to be an earthquake like there was never
[1:45:33] seen before it's just it's just going to
[1:45:34] sink continents the islands he says the
[1:45:37] islands were no more New Zealand's an
[1:45:40] island it will be no more it's done it
[1:45:43] it's there's just a it's just
[1:45:47] gone that's reality that we face
[1:45:52] and
[1:45:55] now the bride goes up now I don't know
[1:45:57] if this fits exactly
[1:45:59] here but there's a reason why I've put
[1:46:01] it here and this is don't don't take
[1:46:02] this as this is where it exactly is but
[1:46:04] there is another judgment for the
[1:46:05] believer and it is called the Judgment
[1:46:07] seat of Christ and it's not the same as
[1:46:09] the great white Throne judgment I want
[1:46:11] to show you this next scripture I just
[1:46:12] want to come in on that just quickly if
[1:46:14] I can Romans
[1:46:16] 14:10 says I don't know the the
[1:46:19] tribulation happened
[1:46:20] the bride is away at the wedding supper
[1:46:22] but at some point sometime there is a
[1:46:24] judgment for the for the bride I know it
[1:46:27] sounds odd but I want to show you the
[1:46:29] scriptures but why Dost thou judge thy
[1:46:32] brother or why Dost thou sit it not thy
[1:46:34] brother for we shall all stand before
[1:46:35] the Judgment seat of
[1:46:36] Christ and he says for we must all
[1:46:39] appear before the Judgment seat of
[1:46:40] Christ that everyone may receive the
[1:46:42] things done in his body according to
[1:46:43] that he hath done whether it be good or
[1:46:46] bad now this is not talking about the
[1:46:48] great white thr in judgment because
[1:46:49] brother talks about it here he says I
[1:46:50] don't know when I can be back again
[1:46:53] it'll only be through the will of God
[1:46:54] and whatever he shows me to do and I
[1:46:56] love you and someday I must stand at the
[1:46:58] Judgment seed of Christ to give an
[1:47:00] account for the things that we've done
[1:47:01] in this
[1:47:03] life if I never meet you no more till I
[1:47:06] meet you in the land of glory and stand
[1:47:07] there at the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:47:09] where we we'll all come I've told you
[1:47:11] the truth many times he says I'll meet
[1:47:13] you at that judgment there but that's
[1:47:16] not it's not the great white Throne
[1:47:18] judgment you might have missed all these
[1:47:20] but here's one that you're going to
[1:47:21] stand that's the conference at judgment
[1:47:24] there you're all going to be there every
[1:47:26] one of us is going to stand at the
[1:47:27] Judgment seat of Christ to give an
[1:47:28] account for what we've done with Christ
[1:47:29] and his word sometimes he might say it
[1:47:31] like the great white Thad judgment but
[1:47:33] it's different and I want to show you
[1:47:34] this other quote that he gave next
[1:47:38] one now Brotherman was talking about
[1:47:40] when he went beyond the curtain of
[1:47:42] time so we've heard the story so he goes
[1:47:44] beyond the curtain of time and he sees
[1:47:46] all the the the the people there and he
[1:47:49] says who are all these people people
[1:47:51] what does this mean and and he said
[1:47:53] they're your people I said my people
[1:47:54] there couldn't be that many Brams
[1:47:56] there's Millions he said they your
[1:47:57] converts Hallelujah they're your
[1:47:58] converts they're the ones that said see
[1:48:01] that one standing there the most
[1:48:02] beautiful woman I've ever seen he said
[1:48:04] she was past 90 years old when you led
[1:48:06] her to God no wonder she's crying my
[1:48:07] darling brother said she'll never be old
[1:48:09] no more she's passed from that she's in
[1:48:11] the Splendor of you she's standing here
[1:48:13] she can't drink she can't drink a cold
[1:48:15] drink of water she don't need it she
[1:48:17] can't lay down and sleep cuz she don't
[1:48:19] get tired there's no tomorrow no
[1:48:20] yesterday no nothing we're in eternity
[1:48:22] now but some Glorious Day the Son of God
[1:48:24] shall come and you will be judged
[1:48:26] according to the word that you preach to
[1:48:27] them and he said and I said will I will
[1:48:31] Paul have to bring his group now in
[1:48:34] another one brother B says I want to go
[1:48:36] and see Jesus and they said you can't go
[1:48:38] and see him yet you first got to be
[1:48:39] judged for what you
[1:48:41] preached right then you can go and see
[1:48:43] him so there was some I don't know when
[1:48:45] it is but there was something that we
[1:48:47] have to go and face and and it's what
[1:48:50] have we done what did we do cuz if we
[1:48:53] receive a reward then okay what did you
[1:48:55] do for your
[1:48:56] reward I don't know how it works but the
[1:48:58] Bible talks about
[1:49:01] it and I don't know is there more or
[1:49:03] less I don't I don't know all I know is
[1:49:05] he couldn't go and see Jesus because it
[1:49:07] says you have to be judged for this
[1:49:08] first and and whether it fits in that
[1:49:11] timeline I don't know but when I think
[1:49:13] about this then it makes me think I want
[1:49:15] to make sure that my actions everything
[1:49:16] I do counts for the gospel and when my
[1:49:18] motives are judged you know I can say
[1:49:20] you know what Lord I can stand here
[1:49:21] clean and say my Motors were pure and I
[1:49:24] may have not got everything right but in
[1:49:26] that situation may have people may have
[1:49:27] thought it was that but in my heart I
[1:49:28] knew it was this this is what I said in
[1:49:30] that this is what I was thinking in that
[1:49:31] situation this is that and it makes us
[1:49:35] more cautious of how we do it to realize
[1:49:36] well we're not just going to get away
[1:49:38] scotf free it's all going to come open
[1:49:40] and and and as brother B said I'll meet
[1:49:43] you there and I'll give an account for
[1:49:45] everything I did okay next
[1:49:49] one
[1:49:51] now after that after the the tribulation
[1:49:54] happened that Fier judgments happened
[1:49:55] and the Earth as ashes then the Bible
[1:49:58] says that there's a millennium for a
[1:49:59] thousand years and the righteous walk
[1:50:01] out on the ashes of the wicked so now
[1:50:03] that's a thousand- year rest period it's
[1:50:04] the type of the Sabbath you got 6,000
[1:50:06] you've got 1,000 years so now the bride
[1:50:09] Christ and his bride come back down to
[1:50:11] the Earth for for a thousand year and
[1:50:13] it's called the Millennium Reign okay
[1:50:16] next one cuz I want to show you there's
[1:50:17] a few more judgments and I saw an angel
[1:50:19] come down from heaven having the key of
[1:50:21] the bottomless put and a great chain in
[1:50:22] his hand and he laid hold on the dragon
[1:50:24] that old serpent which is the devil and
[1:50:25] Satan and bound him a thousand years and
[1:50:27] cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:50:29] shut him up and set a saell upon him
[1:50:31] that he should deceive the Nations no
[1:50:32] more till a thousand years should be
[1:50:34] fulfilled and after that he must be
[1:50:35] loose for a little season so there's a
[1:50:38] Thousand-Year period and the Revelation
[1:50:41] 25 says but the rest of the Dead live
[1:50:42] not again until the thousand years were
[1:50:43] finished this is the first resurrection
[1:50:45] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:50:47] the first resurrection which is the
[1:50:49] bride because you know the dead in
[1:50:50] Christ meet him they rise up that's the
[1:50:51] first resurrection on such the second
[1:50:54] death which is a great white Throne
[1:50:55] judgment ha no power but they shall be
[1:50:57] Priests of God and of Christ and shall
[1:50:59] reign with him a thousand years so this
[1:51:01] is the bride reigning a thousand years
[1:51:03] and brother Brown says this here and
[1:51:05] immediately after his days shall the
[1:51:07] Great Tribulation set in and burn the
[1:51:08] Earth it's Armageddon everything gets
[1:51:10] burnt and then at the return of the
[1:51:12] church and the bride the Bride In Christ
[1:51:13] shall walk out upon the ashes in the
[1:51:15] Millennium when the earth is purified by
[1:51:17] fire and there and there they shall this
[1:51:20] is interesting and I not going to get
[1:51:21] into this but this is what brother R
[1:51:22] says and the heathens that never heard
[1:51:24] the gospel shall be raised in that time
[1:51:25] and the sons of God will be manifest a
[1:51:27] feast rign is got to have something to
[1:51:28] re over he's got a domain and they ruled
[1:51:30] and reign with Christ and Christ ruled
[1:51:32] with the ruled with the rod of iron the
[1:51:35] Nations so there's this time where we We
[1:51:38] Rule and Reign for a thousand years
[1:51:40] called the Millennium that the Thousand
[1:51:42] Years of the earth okay now next
[1:51:46] one okay the scriptures talk about that
[1:51:48] the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb
[1:51:49] and the and the leopard shall lie down
[1:51:50] with the kid and the calf and the Young
[1:51:51] Lion and the fatling together and a
[1:51:53] little child shall lead them there's
[1:51:55] going to be things here so I don't know
[1:51:57] how it works but we don't know how the
[1:51:59] Earth was made either you know so God's
[1:52:01] got a way of doing things there's going
[1:52:02] to be animals there's going to be things
[1:52:03] here there'll be there'll be kingdoms to
[1:52:05] rule and rign over and things to do in
[1:52:07] this Millennium time it is going to
[1:52:09] happen next
[1:52:10] one now at the end of a thousand years
[1:52:13] there's there's this final battle that
[1:52:15] they call the Battle of Gog the Bible
[1:52:17] talks about the Battle of Gog and Magog
[1:52:19] okay
[1:52:20] it says after a thousand years that
[1:52:22] Satan's loosed back and when the
[1:52:25] thousand years are expired Satan shall
[1:52:26] be loosed out of his prison and shall go
[1:52:27] out to deceive the Nations which were in
[1:52:29] the four quarters of the earth Gog and
[1:52:30] Magog to gather them together to battle
[1:52:33] the number of whom is the sand of the
[1:52:35] sea and went upon up on the bread of the
[1:52:38] earth and compassed the camp of the
[1:52:39] Saints about and the Beloved City and
[1:52:41] fire came down from heaven fire came
[1:52:43] down from God out of heaven and devoured
[1:52:45] them so when he's Loos it's like they
[1:52:47] just he he gets in them all again and
[1:52:49] they all come against the the the the
[1:52:51] camp of God now this time here God just
[1:52:53] says his own fire came down and just
[1:52:55] destroyed them this the Battle of Gog
[1:52:57] and Magog and it's not Armageddon it's a
[1:52:59] different one now that pretty much wipes
[1:53:02] out all living after that everything
[1:53:04] living is gone and in this earth as we
[1:53:06] know it finished done next one there's a
[1:53:09] lot of judgment going to happen that was
[1:53:12] Gog and Magog now the next one we have
[1:53:14] is the great white Throne judgment just
[1:53:16] and this is the last judgment next one
[1:53:21] now after that it says and I saw the
[1:53:25] dead small and great stand before God
[1:53:28] and the books were opened and another
[1:53:29] book was open which is The Book of Life
[1:53:31] and the dead were judged out of those
[1:53:33] things which were written in the books
[1:53:34] according to their works and the Sea
[1:53:36] gave up her dead remember that word sea
[1:53:38] and death and Hell delivered up the dead
[1:53:40] which were in them and they were judged
[1:53:42] every man according to their Works
[1:53:43] remember brother B said we looked at the
[1:53:45] other passages now blessed are the
[1:53:47] merciful they shall obtain Mercy all
[1:53:49] these people people are going to turn up
[1:53:51] here to be judged and death and hell
[1:53:54] were cast into the Lake of Fire this is
[1:53:55] the second death I was supposed to
[1:53:57] delete that read that later on but and
[1:53:59] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:54:00] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:54:03] Fire next
[1:54:07] one
[1:54:11] now I don't know if I got I beheld I
[1:54:15] just want to say this
[1:54:16] here the Bible says know ye not that the
[1:54:19] Saints shall judge the
[1:54:21] Earth okay the Saints the the bride
[1:54:25] isn't being judged at this one the bride
[1:54:27] brother man talks about the bride is is
[1:54:29] the one that judges Earth sits as a
[1:54:30] Queen of Heaven judges the Earth you
[1:54:32] wonder why we go through these judgments
[1:54:33] here we've got to know how to
[1:54:35] judge the the bride doesn't get judged
[1:54:38] here now Daniel says I beheld till the
[1:54:41] Thrones were cast down and the Ancient
[1:54:42] of Days did sit whose garment was white
[1:54:44] as snow and the hair of his head like
[1:54:46] the pure wool his throne was like the
[1:54:48] fiery flame and his whals as Bur burning
[1:54:50] fire a fiery stream issued and came
[1:54:52] forth from before him thousands
[1:54:55] thousands ministered unto him and 10,000
[1:54:58] time 10,000 stood before him the
[1:55:00] Judgment was set the books were open so
[1:55:03] you've got the smaller group ministering
[1:55:05] with him which is his bride then you've
[1:55:06] got 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him
[1:55:10] which was the sea that gave up a did
[1:55:11] everything just everything else stood
[1:55:12] before him but the bride stood with
[1:55:15] him okay next one oh here we go do ye
[1:55:21] not know that the saint shall judge the
[1:55:22] world this is not just something that is
[1:55:25] a little passage this is what happens
[1:55:27] here the bride shall judge the world and
[1:55:28] if the world shall be judged by you are
[1:55:30] you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:55:32] matters next
[1:55:36] one Jesus talked about the queen of the
[1:55:39] South and he said the queen of the South
[1:55:41] shall rise up in the Judgment with the
[1:55:43] men of this generation and condemn them
[1:55:46] for she came from the utmost parts of
[1:55:48] the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[1:55:49] and Behold a greater than Solomon is
[1:55:50] here brother BR gave this example to say
[1:55:53] I think it was him to say or maybe it
[1:55:55] was just in discussion to say that the
[1:55:58] people from your generation you'll judge
[1:56:00] so he says because the queen of she was
[1:56:02] from that sort of time so she'll come up
[1:56:04] and judge these people because she was
[1:56:05] like she could say I was there I went
[1:56:08] through that this is how I this is what
[1:56:10] I did what was your excuse you know and
[1:56:13] and and our generation will come up
[1:56:15] before us cuz we can say I was I lived
[1:56:17] in Wellington you're from Wellington I
[1:56:19] was there there you're from New Zealand
[1:56:21] you from South Africa I was
[1:56:24] there that's the way it will work next
[1:56:26] one but this is a
[1:56:28] great and before him shall be gathered
[1:56:31] all nations and he shall separate them
[1:56:32] one from another as a Shepherd divideth
[1:56:34] his sheep from the goats and he shall
[1:56:36] set the sheep on his right hand but the
[1:56:37] goats on the left remember the five we
[1:56:39] went
[1:56:40] through this is when the the Bible talks
[1:56:43] about the the death and Hell gave up
[1:56:45] their dead then it talks about the sea
[1:56:46] gave up their dead these some people
[1:56:48] didn't come from death death and hell
[1:56:50] some people came from this place the
[1:56:51] Bible calls to see I don't know is that
[1:56:54] these other people that actually they're
[1:56:56] waiting for their judgment and they will
[1:56:57] actually make it in but they're not from
[1:56:59] death and
[1:57:00] hell but but what is sure is people will
[1:57:03] receive a righteous judgment here and
[1:57:06] there will be those the five types
[1:57:08] different types will come will stand
[1:57:10] here and that's what I was saying before
[1:57:12] that one thing that someone did for you
[1:57:13] and you said Lord I really appreciate
[1:57:15] this that could be it for them that
[1:57:19] could be it the the remnant that went
[1:57:21] through tribulation that that had to die
[1:57:23] for all that that that they come there
[1:57:25] and they they've been purified they that
[1:57:27] that was it for them they they they
[1:57:29] stood with the Lord and what they knew
[1:57:30] and they made it
[1:57:31] through think about it the Lord has got
[1:57:34] the right to save who he wants to
[1:57:38] because he paid the own price so he can
[1:57:39] say you're in you're
[1:57:41] out he paid his own price so he can do
[1:57:44] what he wants to do so it's not unjust
[1:57:46] to say you're in because I've chosen to
[1:57:47] forgive you you understand stand he can
[1:57:49] do what he wants to
[1:57:51] do but the goats death and Hell
[1:57:53] everything this is the final point where
[1:57:55] where everything evil every every bit of
[1:57:58] sin everything evil is just going to be
[1:58:00] finished done this is his final judgment
[1:58:02] the Lord spent a lot of time with
[1:58:04] judgment implementing judgment all the
[1:58:06] way through he's put a lot of effort
[1:58:07] implementing judgment a lot of effort go
[1:58:10] to the next one and death and hell were
[1:58:13] cast into the Lake of Fire this is the
[1:58:15] second death and whosoever was not found
[1:58:17] written in the Book of Life was cast
[1:58:19] into the Lake of Fire that's just the
[1:58:20] end of it no more no more next
[1:58:26] one now the last one I've got here is
[1:58:30] peace and it's an amazing word to think
[1:58:33] and that's why I use the scripture the
[1:58:34] Prince of
[1:58:35] Peace because at some point you look at
[1:58:38] all the effort the the the fight that
[1:58:40] God has had to wage and the judgment and
[1:58:43] things he's had to do I don't believe
[1:58:45] God enjoys that I don't believe he does
[1:58:49] the way he created man was I'll create
[1:58:51] Adam and Eve and I'll just it'll be a
[1:58:53] peaceful existence and I'll come down
[1:58:55] and fellowship with you we'll live in
[1:58:57] peace that was his ideal idea of how he
[1:59:01] wanted to do things but because things
[1:59:03] went the way they did he had he's had to
[1:59:05] fight this battle all the way through
[1:59:07] and Implement all this judgment who
[1:59:09] likes implementing judgment I don't I
[1:59:11] can't stand it sometimes I have to do it
[1:59:14] to my children I think I I I can't wait
[1:59:16] till this is over cuz I don't enjoy this
[1:59:20] I think God is the same he doesn't sit
[1:59:21] there and think I want to get rid of all
[1:59:23] this I want to implement my judgment and
[1:59:24] that but he'll do it because he has to
[1:59:26] but he it wasn't his desire his desire
[1:59:29] was to have peace go to the next one and
[1:59:32] I I I got this picture because it really
[1:59:34] spoke to me I thought you know one day
[1:59:37] even the Lord's going to sit back and
[1:59:38] think I can to have peace it's it's all
[1:59:42] done I can just be with my bride and
[1:59:44] those that I've redeemed and I don't
[1:59:45] have to do this I don't have to I don't
[1:59:48] have to for me any more judgment it's
[1:59:51] done he's a prince of peace that the and
[1:59:54] I can just dwell here in this place with
[1:59:58] my bride and with all with my my kingdom
[2:00:00] and I don't have to it's all over I
[2:00:03] think even he'll sit back and go it's
[2:00:05] done because he's fought a major battle
[2:00:08] against evil and to get us out of it
[2:00:11] he's fought a major
[2:00:13] battle and I'm so glad that one day
[2:00:16] there's a song that says there will be
[2:00:18] peace in the valley for me
[2:00:20] someday there will be peace in the
[2:00:21] valley for me till that day comes we'll
[2:00:24] fight with everything we've got but I
[2:00:25] can't wait to have to be in a place of
[2:00:27] peace and to be with the Prince of Peace
[2:00:30] amen let's just pray this evening we ask
