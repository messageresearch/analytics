[15:33] hallelujah amen you may have your seats
[15:36] for our first special amen sister
[15:38] belinda
[15:40] heyman can you please make your way
[15:52] forward
[16:20] oh
[16:28] this song is called let god live
[16:32] and i wrote it earlier this year in june
[16:38] and some of the inspiration for it was
[16:40] um you know when
[16:42] in the bible when he talks about sham go
[16:44] and he
[16:45] planted his his fruit every season and
[16:48] then the philistines would come every
[16:49] season to steal his fruit
[16:51] but then eventually one year he just
[16:53] thought i can't do it
[16:56] but he cried out to the lord and says
[16:57] right now i'm going to stand against
[16:59] that enemy
[17:00] and then he just walked in that it just
[17:02] let the lord come and and work through
[17:04] him and with that
[17:05] with that jawbone he just slayed all
[17:07] those philistines
[17:09] and they no longer came to destroy his
[17:12] land anymore for him and his family
[17:14] and that was part of the inspiration for
[17:16] the song
[17:18] and then also where brother brenham
[17:20] talks about the greatest battle ever
[17:21] ford
[17:22] is in the mind and then um i think it
[17:25] might have been
[17:26] been mentioning that right here you know
[17:28] like where the no man's land is
[17:30] is where the final enemy will be you
[17:33] know dealt with
[17:35] and that when when we have overcome that
[17:38] we have the final victory you know then
[17:40] so that was the inspiration for the song
[17:50] there are times of trouble and despair
[17:54] [Music]
[17:55] so many burdens to bear
[18:00] but i've learned to put my trust in god
[18:06] and let god live
[18:11] let go
[18:14] [Music]
[18:19] having the victory i open
[18:22] my heart to the things of god
[18:27] and let god live
[18:32] in the greatest battle ever for
[18:37] the enemy surrounds me like a flood
[18:42] i will let the lord raise the standard
[18:47] and let god
[18:56] let him live in me let
[19:00] god live having the victory
[19:03] i open my heart to the things of god
[19:09] and let god live
[19:14] now i walk in perfect victory
[19:18] [Music]
[19:20] knowing jesus has come and set me free
[19:25] and i claim every promise
[19:28] of his word and let
[19:36] god
[19:38] [Music]
[19:45] having the victory i open
[19:48] my heart to the things of god
[19:52] and let god live
[19:58] and let god
[20:09] [Applause]

[41:34] [Music]
[41:37] [Applause]
[41:41] amen praise the lord
[41:46] amen
[41:49] and a prophet says there's no one else
[41:51] like you
[41:52] [Music]
[41:53] amen he said you are greater than all
[41:56] the kings and all the potentates and all
[41:58] the presidents
[42:00] so we can glorify him and he says
[42:02] there's no one else like you
[42:04] praise the lord is that right you must
[42:07] be able to identify how god sees you
[42:12] because when god looks at you he looks
[42:14] at a part of himself
[42:16] is that right god came and searched out
[42:18] for a part of
[42:19] himself and we are here we are the
[42:24] searched out
[42:24] people and he called and we responded
[42:29] because we
[42:30] can only respond if we are an attribute
[42:33] of god
[42:34] so it's attribute coming to attributes
[42:37] is that right
[42:39] praise the lord well i just want to say
[42:43] how
[42:43] thankful to be into the house of the
[42:46] lord this morning
[42:47] and uh for the wonderful meeting last
[42:50] night
[42:51] thank you very much musicians we
[42:53] appreciate the musicians amen
[42:55] for creating the atmosphere praise the
[42:57] lord
[43:02] and uh brother freddie was saying last
[43:04] night
[43:05] how he uh you know accepted an
[43:07] invitation and
[43:09] wondered why he accepted the invitation
[43:12] well actually i was a little bit like
[43:13] that myself
[43:14] uh thank you musicians i was in
[43:17] switzerland at the time and an email
[43:18] came through from brother ben and
[43:21] i uh i said yeah i'll do a meeting
[43:26] and when i got home from
[43:29] europe i thought well the lord will give
[43:32] me something when i've been quarantined
[43:33] for two weeks
[43:35] and guess what nothing happens
[43:39] and it's just in the last few days that
[43:41] the lord just showed me
[43:43] do this and do this and do this and do
[43:45] this because
[43:46] i want to do a a part three of what i
[43:49] did in poland just a few weeks ago
[43:52] and it's something that is heavily on my
[43:54] heart to be able to get you into war
[43:56] mode
[43:58] amen we're in a battle this is not for
[44:01] a bunch of fairies we are soldiers amen
[44:04] we're in a battle and we're in a battle
[44:06] to the end
[44:08] not only to the end but beyond the end
[44:10] is that right because we are eternal
[44:12] beings
[44:13] we are not temporal beings we are
[44:15] eternal beings
[44:16] you are sure your body is a temporal
[44:18] body but this body is going to be
[44:20] changed in the twinkling of an eye
[44:22] but this part of ourselves is as eternal
[44:25] as what god is eternal
[44:27] he say man that sounds like heresy but
[44:29] that's the word of god
[44:31] amen we are as eternal as what god is
[44:34] eternal praise the lord
[44:37] brother ben thank you very much for the
[44:38] invitation uh it's just wonderful to be
[44:41] able to preach with some real preachers
[44:42] down here i'm just a farmer
[44:44] and i'm happy to be just called a farmer
[44:47] and uh but you know if the lord can use
[44:49] a farmer for his glory then that's all
[44:50] that matters to me
[44:52] you may be seated for a while okay
[44:58] when i came back from europe with my
[45:00] wife a few weeks ago i had
[45:03] i realized that there had been some
[45:05] serious changes in my life
[45:07] because i saw things going on in the
[45:10] world
[45:11] that was very serious and
[45:14] the lord enabled us to go into europe
[45:17] when that you could not get into europe
[45:20] uh it was impossible to get into europe
[45:22] but the thing is that with the lord
[45:23] nothing is impossible
[45:25] because he had people that were sitting
[45:27] in message churches
[45:28] that were wondering what is going on all
[45:31] around them
[45:32] and it is not because of the pastors and
[45:34] not preaching things the right way it's
[45:36] just that in every congregation there
[45:38] are people with weaknesses
[45:39] that that need to be strengthened you
[45:41] know so
[45:43] we're not here to go and run somebody
[45:45] down because you're weak we are here to
[45:46] strengthen you
[45:47] because you do not need to be
[45:49] strengthened if you're strong you need
[45:50] to be strengthened if you've got some
[45:51] weaknesses
[45:53] is that right praise the lord so uh
[45:56] i just want to um to just
[45:59] show you a few things and where is this
[46:01] little gadget here
[46:05] turn this thing on
[46:12] uh what am i doing wrong here brother
[46:17] you better go and turn this thing on i'm
[46:19] in the the dinosaur age with technology
[46:25] okay let's just see if that works
[46:31] i want to challenge you this morning
[46:37] as to what you are i want to seriously
[46:41] challenge you
[46:42] because this civilization brothers and
[46:44] sisters is dying
[46:45] for the lack of love amen
[46:49] and this is a civilization that has
[46:51] industrialized
[46:52] fear and you are living in an age
[46:56] where everything where you go is fear
[46:59] fair fear and the prophet god says fear
[47:02] is the biggest curse that's in the
[47:03] church
[47:04] and so we must get rid of all doubts we
[47:07] must get rid of all fear
[47:09] otherwise you cannot progress forward
[47:11] with the lord with a spirit
[47:13] now remember fear is a demon i'm going
[47:17] to call it call it what it is
[47:19] it's a demon
[47:23] and we cannot afford to have a demon of
[47:25] fear
[47:26] overshadowing us and the only way that
[47:29] you can have no fear is to know who you
[47:31] are in the book
[47:32] jesus knew who he was in the book and he
[47:35] had perfect faith by what the word spoke
[47:37] about
[47:38] her and you get perfect faith by knowing
[47:40] what the word spoke about you
[47:42] and when you know who you are that is
[47:44] your confidence
[47:46] that is your power that is your your
[47:49] identification is your power
[47:52] can you also say amen to that
[47:55] now when i was walking around casually
[47:58] through
[47:58] uh amongst the cosmos in other words the
[48:01] world systems in europe
[48:02] i did not know it but the lord was using
[48:04] me
[48:06] and i'm not the most spiritual guy here
[48:08] okay
[48:10] sometimes i think to myself my lord why
[48:11] did you choose me
[48:14] i look in the mirror and say i wouldn't
[48:15] choose me
[48:17] and you look in the red say well you
[48:18] wouldn't choose you either but i don't
[48:20] argue with god because he said he chose
[48:22] me and that's that
[48:23] and the story so i'm walking around
[48:28] not realizing that a lot of the time i'm
[48:30] walking around the world
[48:32] and amongst the world and this and the
[48:34] holy spirit's just doing things
[48:36] i want you to be conscious of who you
[48:38] are
[48:39] i was in krakow airport in poland just a
[48:42] few weeks ago
[48:44] and i had i was dropped off by the
[48:46] pastor i'm just walking
[48:48] around uh killing time until the plane
[48:51] left uh krakow to take me to frankfurt
[48:55] and i look and there's an african man
[48:58] in poland now you see african people
[49:02] in the western western europe but you
[49:04] don't see them in eastern europe
[49:07] because eastern europe is no money you
[49:09] know
[49:10] they they go there to get an education
[49:12] and things like that
[49:13] and i'm looking and and there's this
[49:15] this fellow up there i'll just put them
[49:17] back up there again
[49:18] can you put up that that slide please
[49:22] and i'm just walking around and i see
[49:25] this
[49:26] african man i said what an unusual thing
[49:30] to see a man there because and
[49:33] in poland the income is only 500 a month
[49:38] and so he goes and he's a
[49:42] the chicken opens up and the chicken to
[49:44] check in your bags he gets his boarding
[49:46] passes and go through security in the
[49:48] transit area
[49:49] and then sometime later i put my bags
[49:51] through get up my
[49:53] my boarding passes go through security
[49:55] into the transit area
[49:57] and i'm looking up to see where is the
[49:59] departure lounge
[50:01] and then as i see where the departure
[50:03] lounges this man the same man comes up
[50:05] to me and speaks
[50:06] speaks to me in polish i thought this
[50:09] man speaks polish i said look man i only
[50:11] speak english he's there he starts
[50:12] speaking in pure english
[50:16] and he says it's just a flight to
[50:18] frankfurt because uh i had to go from
[50:20] krakow to frankfurt frank victor to
[50:23] zurich onto a train up to the alps where
[50:25] our daughter lives
[50:27] and so i said yes this is the um the
[50:29] departure lounge to frankfurt
[50:32] and you know i i'm just a
[50:33] conversationalist
[50:35] if somebody wants to talk to me i'll
[50:36] talk to them back
[50:38] and so he just said i said well where
[50:40] you from man he says the ivory coast
[50:43] i don't know why they call that place in
[50:45] africa the ivory coast maybe there's
[50:46] some dead
[50:47] elephants on the coast or something i
[50:48] don't know why they caught on ivory
[50:50] coast
[50:51] and he says where are you from i said
[50:53] from new zealand
[50:55] and he said no he said well what are you
[50:57] doing here i said i'm a minister and he
[50:59] thought i was a government minister
[51:03] i tell you something i'm not one of
[51:05] those deceivers
[51:11] and it took him a little while to so he
[51:12] started walking with me and i'm not
[51:14] knowing the lord's using me
[51:17] he's and so he starts walking with me he
[51:20] says
[51:21] i've never had a white man talk to me
[51:23] before
[51:24] and my jaw drops
[51:29] and look i couldn't care if someone is
[51:30] black white pink blue
[51:32] polka dotted or striped
[51:36] in christ ain't no difference man
[51:39] and christ is no difference because in
[51:42] christ we all come from the same place
[51:46] we all just got trapped into a body
[51:49] that body is not the real you that body
[51:52] is not the real me
[51:53] and we got trapped into a culture called
[51:56] a pest house
[51:57] that pissed out is not your reality
[52:00] praise the lord we bypassed our reality
[52:04] but god places us in certain places and
[52:08] he expects us
[52:09] to utilize what he has made us for the
[52:12] sake of somebody else
[52:15] now we are living in an amazing time
[52:17] this is the greatest time to be leaving
[52:19] us right now
[52:21] and the only way that you can intercede
[52:23] or bring somebody to christ
[52:25] is by being an eternal being on the
[52:28] earth
[52:31] is that right jesus was an intercessor
[52:34] because he came from heaven and he's on
[52:36] the earth
[52:37] as a nearest kinsman to somebody else us
[52:41] and for any one of us to be an
[52:43] intercessor you have to first come from
[52:46] heaven
[52:49] praise the lord and be placed on the
[52:52] earth
[52:53] and stand in the gap for somebody
[52:57] who has no understanding of what god is
[53:00] doing in this hour
[53:03] praise the lord did this man walk with
[53:05] me
[53:07] i said look man i'm not a government
[53:09] minister i'm a servant of god
[53:12] he says what he said who supports you
[53:16] god who pays for your air tickets
[53:19] god and he was baffled
[53:23] because in the ivory coast these are big
[53:26] ministers come over from
[53:28] you know places in the world and they're
[53:30] jets with
[53:31] bodyguards and they come into ivory
[53:35] coast
[53:36] and he says they take all our money and
[53:39] you can't get to them
[53:40] you can't get to them for prayer he says
[53:42] man he says you're different
[53:44] of course i am different
[53:48] i wake up every morning i say man you're
[53:50] different i sure am you are too
[53:54] man were all different
[53:59] see anyway i'm not realizing the lord's
[54:01] using me and i said hey come on look
[54:03] look there's no seats
[54:04] over here just let's go and sit down
[54:05] here see we're talk talk talk talking
[54:07] away
[54:09] then it dawns on me i say i'm slow
[54:13] it dawns on me the lord is doing
[54:15] something with this man
[54:20] and so we sit down and i thought you
[54:22] know this inspiration is coming to i'm
[54:24] going to try this guy out
[54:26] i want to see what's in him i said look
[54:29] if you were to die right now man where
[54:30] you going
[54:35] he said i'm 70 to 90 sure i'll be
[54:39] go to to the lord i says well you're
[54:41] lost
[54:44] this is not a time to be 70 sure my
[54:47] friends
[54:49] 100 sure or not at all
[54:53] i said now look at the window see that
[54:56] world out there
[54:58] it's falling apart why is it falling
[55:01] apart
[55:05] i'm going to stir you now why is it
[55:08] falling apart
[55:10] you're making it fall apart
[55:16] you are making the world fall apart
[55:20] because as a civilization of faith rises
[55:23] up in us
[55:24] the cosmos goes down
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:28] and i know though i'm standing in a
[55:30] place where that man
[55:32] must connect with eternity so the only
[55:35] way he can connect with eternity is
[55:37] through an eternal being
[55:42] you understand now brethren you are the
[55:44] most important people on this earth i
[55:46] want to stir your faith up
[55:49] this world is dying for the lack of love
[55:52] so
[55:52] love must step forth
[55:54] [Applause]
[55:58] praise the lord and when love steps
[56:00] forth
[56:03] the grace is projected
[56:10] amen you must know who you are
[56:14] i am so excited about this day so now i
[56:17] start talking to this fella
[56:20] and he says uh you know he starts going
[56:23] on about how old that
[56:24] uh evade and apple and all that sort of
[56:26] thing so i started that genesis
[56:29] you know if if if an apple makes a woman
[56:32] pregnant well
[56:32] i tell you something man at harvest time
[56:34] there's going to be pregnant women all
[56:35] over the place
[56:37] but this guy caught an understanding
[56:40] of genesis then i'm saying now look out
[56:45] there
[56:46] the door to the gentiles is closing
[56:50] and it shocked him i said look man
[56:56] if someone was to put one million euros
[56:59] in front of me
[57:00] right now and give me a challenge either
[57:02] i take the euros
[57:04] or i am going to go and see the
[57:06] salvation of your soul
[57:08] what do you think i would choose i said
[57:11] i would choose your soul
[57:12] before any stinking money
[57:14] [Applause]
[57:16] because that money will pass away but
[57:18] your soul was worth ten thousand worlds
[57:22] i tell you something brothers and
[57:23] sisters that man he
[57:26] said to me he said you know you jesus of
[57:29] the bible is not doing anything
[57:30] supernatural anymore
[57:32] i thought here is my entrance
[57:40] my whole life is a testimony of the
[57:43] supernatural of god
[57:46] and your whole life is a testimony of
[57:48] god
[57:50] when i started on my testimony and the
[57:52] supernatural that happened
[57:54] in my life that man started screaming
[57:57] and the more testimonies testimonies i
[58:00] gave to him
[58:01] the louder he got and the louder he got
[58:04] and if you don't like emotion you won't
[58:06] like heaven because heaven is full of
[58:12] as full of africans
[58:15] [Music]
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:15] [Laughter]
[58:21] you africans don't have a monopoly on
[58:23] praise
[58:25] because i'm joining you amen

[1:00:21] not motivating to me to any of these
[1:00:22] people here

[1:01:26] and i come back and she's still you know
[1:01:28] looking around again
[1:01:29] i go out then after a while i get fed up
[1:01:32] and i come back
[1:01:34] there's only one there's a woman behind
[1:01:36] the counter now watch how god does
[1:01:38] things
[1:01:39] the woman behind the counter she had a
[1:01:41] mask on
[1:01:43] now some people need to wear masks
[1:01:44] permanently but that one there
[1:01:46] she was behind the counter
[1:01:51] and i said to her i couldn't see her
[1:01:54] face
[1:01:55] she said i estimated around about 25.
[1:01:58] and so she's there and i said oh how's
[1:02:00] business and she speaks to me
[1:02:02] in english now she's a german swiss she
[1:02:05] starts speaking to me in english
[1:02:06] she says it's just no god this virus
[1:02:09] thing and
[1:02:09] this and this and this and she was
[1:02:10] really and she said such a scam and all
[1:02:13] this and sort of
[1:02:14] entry i started
[1:02:17] speaking to her about world events
[1:02:21] world events and talking about all the
[1:02:25] the the way that the world's uh falling
[1:02:27] down and what's causing it and this and
[1:02:29] this
[1:02:31] and and she and she's stunned that
[1:02:33] there's somebody
[1:02:35] who's not sucked in by at all amen
[1:02:40] she said i want to tell you something
[1:02:41] you won't believe this
[1:02:43] i said okay speak it now watch this
[1:02:46] i'm not knowing that the lord is using
[1:02:48] me okay
[1:02:50] now be careful with your walks because
[1:02:52] the lord can be using you don't know
[1:02:54] nothing
[1:02:55] she says i want to tell you something
[1:02:57] you won't believe me i can say it
[1:02:59] last year i used to work downstairs in
[1:03:02] this airport in the shop that sold
[1:03:04] t-shirts and a man
[1:03:08] walked into the shop with bare feet and
[1:03:10] a white gown on
[1:03:13] and i thought it's my time to die
[1:03:19] he said nobody else saw him there was he
[1:03:22] we couldn't even get it on the uh the
[1:03:24] close circuit tv he wasn't there
[1:03:28] i said girl god is calling you
[1:03:31] right now it says you go
[1:03:34] home and get on your knees and ask the
[1:03:36] lord to come into your heart
[1:03:39] i gave him my email my testimony i
[1:03:41] always give my testimony
[1:03:42] to people that i witness to because my
[1:03:44] testimony is on youtube it means
[1:03:46] very much to me how that the lord could
[1:03:48] take someone that's utterly useless
[1:03:50] could not speak had damage when he was a
[1:03:52] kid and god could put him in the pulpit
[1:03:57] it does not matter what your weakness
[1:04:00] is god can change that
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:05] i am a witness of that
[1:04:08] and i and i got to the stage now
[1:04:11] brothers and sisters
[1:04:12] if you want to get anywhere with god you
[1:04:14] must be able to take criticism
[1:04:17] because you cannot be hung in the hall
[1:04:19] of fame
[1:04:20] without people criticizing you
[1:04:23] and peop some people hate criticism but
[1:04:25] it's a part of the walk
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:28] is that right expect it
[1:04:33] praise the lord so she said i will
[1:04:38] i will i haven't heard from her since
[1:04:41] that doesn't mean to say she's first
[1:04:43] resurrection person
[1:04:44] she could be a second resurrection
[1:04:46] person but she had respect
[1:04:49] of what was spoken to her because when
[1:04:52] you carry this word when somebody
[1:04:55] respects
[1:04:56] that which you are carrying they are
[1:04:58] respecting
[1:04:59] god because you are the mercy seat
[1:05:06] do you believe it
[1:05:09] praise the lord okay one more
[1:05:17] walking around my wife and i went for a
[1:05:21] drive on saturday
[1:05:23] in switzerland and we stopped off
[1:05:26] in a certain town in the alps and
[1:05:29] there's a farmers market
[1:05:31] so we get out of the car everyone
[1:05:34] and my wife she wants to look at the
[1:05:35] tents and uh all the
[1:05:37] produce and things like like that and i
[1:05:39] like looking around other things
[1:05:42] and so i'm walking along and this uh

[1:06:53] question
[1:06:53] number one what can be done to improve
[1:06:58] at the united nations
[1:07:01] [Applause]
[1:07:03] i thought girl i said an atomic bomb
[1:07:10] there was momentary silence
[1:07:13] then it started raining i said girl come
[1:07:16] with me sit down there i got some things
[1:07:18] to say to you
[1:07:20] so she sat down on the bench with me and
[1:07:22] i found out she was a denominational
[1:07:24] girl
[1:07:25] i says girl this world is toast
[1:07:29] it's completely falling apart and it
[1:07:32] says your
[1:07:32] access to mercy is coming to an end she
[1:07:35] says but sir but sir these things you're
[1:07:37] talking about is 10 years or 20 years in
[1:07:39] the future
[1:07:40] it says it's happening now
[1:07:43] does she swiss means that the shell is a
[1:07:47] little bit harder to crack
[1:07:50] but she i got through i'll be careful
[1:07:52] what i say because there's two sisters
[1:07:53] here
[1:07:54] that swiss it's a little bit harder to
[1:07:57] crack
[1:07:59] but i got through
[1:08:03] and i said look you the lord's calling
[1:08:05] you
[1:08:06] because something was registering in
[1:08:07] this this particular lady
[1:08:09] i don't know where she fits into the
[1:08:11] economy of god
[1:08:13] but i'm taking advantage of my position
[1:08:18] amen my position
[1:08:22] your position must be realized you
[1:08:25] are the access to mercy in this hour
[1:08:28] do you believe it praise the lord
[1:08:32] this is our subject we're going to go
[1:08:34] back
[1:08:35] it's our subject
[1:08:39] maybe you could just flick it back less
[1:08:40] down to our feet
[1:08:51] turn to our bibles to habakkuk
[1:08:54] now i'm a person i look at the scenery
[1:08:58] out there i've got to find it in the
[1:09:00] scriptures
[1:09:01] i'm a scriptural minister like these
[1:09:04] other brothers here i'm a scriptural
[1:09:05] minister
[1:09:06] i want to see what is god's
[1:09:10] expectation for us now
[1:09:13] you are a prophetic people amen
[1:09:17] you're under an eagle anointing we are
[1:09:19] not
[1:09:20] wallowing down here in the cosmos
[1:09:24] where you don't see anything we are up
[1:09:27] in a high place by a new birth is that
[1:09:30] right
[1:09:31] and it says in habakkuk 2 verse 1
[1:09:35] now watch this man you have to
[1:09:37] understand
[1:09:38] who is this man what kind of age is he
[1:09:42] living in what is the scenery
[1:09:44] around this minor prophet he says i
[1:09:47] will stand upon my watch that means i'm
[1:09:49] going to stand in the position that god
[1:09:51] has called me into
[1:09:53] amen and i and sent me upon a tower
[1:09:57] now a tower is not somewhere down here
[1:10:01] a tower is somewhere up here so god had
[1:10:04] to open up the tower
[1:10:05] and those seven seals so we could stand
[1:10:08] up in the tower
[1:10:09] and look down because an eagle
[1:10:12] locks down and sees the panorama
[1:10:17] of um from genesis to revelation from
[1:10:20] eternity to eternity
[1:10:21] the ego sees the panorama
[1:10:26] and will watch to see what he will say
[1:10:28] unto me
[1:10:30] and what i shall answer when i'm
[1:10:31] reproved and the lord answered and said
[1:10:33] unto me write the vision make it a plan
[1:10:35] upon tables
[1:10:36] says i'm going to show you something uh
[1:10:37] have a cook
[1:10:39] because you are a representative of
[1:10:41] something that's going to happen right
[1:10:42] at the end time
[1:10:44] that he may run that read with it and he
[1:10:47] says for the vision
[1:10:49] is for an appointed time
[1:10:53] amen an appointed time
[1:10:56] it's got to come to pass but there must
[1:10:59] be the right time
[1:11:00] right season with the right people and
[1:11:02] the right maturity
[1:11:03] is that right and you are those people
[1:11:06] that he may run that readeth it the
[1:11:08] revision is for at a point of time but
[1:11:10] at the end it shall speak
[1:11:13] in other words it comes into expression
[1:11:17] amen he says wait for it
[1:11:22] because it surely will come
[1:11:25] it will not carry the word terry means
[1:11:27] wait it will not wait
[1:11:29] we are in the time when everything
[1:11:33] is speaking out its expression amen this
[1:11:37] bow hits
[1:11:40] the lord lord jesus i pray lord that
[1:11:41] you'd let the eagle fly this morning
[1:11:43] lord god
[1:11:45] lord jesus i'm just a man in my body
[1:11:47] lord god
[1:11:48] but in my soul lord i came from you lord
[1:11:50] god
[1:11:51] lord and our souls every one of us came
[1:11:53] from you lord we're in your eternal
[1:11:55] thinking lord god
[1:11:56] lord i want to cast no doubts upon
[1:11:58] people in this meeting lord that they
[1:12:00] could be sick and resurrection people
[1:12:02] lord god i want to believe in every
[1:12:04] heart here this morning
[1:12:05] is an election that comes from
[1:12:07] predestination
[1:12:09] and and law that you would call out
[1:12:11] those names from the lamb's book of
[1:12:13] life this morning lord god by a
[1:12:15] supernatural poor lord god
[1:12:16] that the people can be connected to what
[1:12:18] you're doing in this day lord i pray
[1:12:20] for i'm asking this for your glory in
[1:12:22] jesus wonderful name amen
[1:12:24] you may be seated
[1:12:28] now we're going to talk about habakkuk
[1:12:29] for a moment because we need to identify
[1:12:32] this man
[1:12:33] now we cannot leave characters in the
[1:12:35] old testament in the old testament
[1:12:37] amen because the old testament is a
[1:12:40] shadow of things that is to come
[1:12:42] so a shadow is a shadow because there's
[1:12:44] an element of light to make that shadow
[1:12:47] but at the time of the end time all the
[1:12:49] shadows come up into the reality time
[1:12:52] because this is the time of the rising
[1:12:53] of the sun
[1:12:55] so everything i look at in the old
[1:12:57] testament must be
[1:12:58] revealed now now watch this man
[1:13:03] we cannot leave him as a historic event
[1:13:07] now this man was in the time when josiah
[1:13:10] was the king
[1:13:12] so you know what happened in the days of
[1:13:14] josiah
[1:13:16] there was a book that had been lost
[1:13:20] that had been found
[1:13:23] there was a book called the book of
[1:13:24] moses
[1:13:26] and the book of moses was a book that
[1:13:29] was placed
[1:13:31] in the holy of holies beside the ark
[1:13:36] and every seven years at the feast of
[1:13:38] tabernacles
[1:13:40] that a high priest had to go into the
[1:13:42] holy of holies
[1:13:44] pick up the book come out with the book
[1:13:47] and read the book to the people
[1:13:49] at the feast of tabernacles and the
[1:13:52] prophet god says this is the feast of
[1:13:54] tabernacles right now
[1:13:55] so the high priest had to come down from
[1:13:58] heaven with an
[1:13:59] open book at the end time is that right
[1:14:02] and read from the open book and restore
[1:14:05] you back to your origins
[1:14:09] and there was a revival in the time of
[1:14:11] josiah
[1:14:13] there was a a revival a short revival
[1:14:16] before the babylonians completely took
[1:14:18] over
[1:14:20] hello now we are prophetic people are we
[1:14:29] every seven years the book had to come
[1:14:32] out
[1:14:33] and read to the people and what the
[1:14:35] reading of the book did
[1:14:36] it got rid of all the garbage and
[1:14:39] scattered all those scarecrows away
[1:14:42] and brought them right back to their
[1:14:43] true origins
[1:14:45] new zealand is not by origin
[1:14:48] africa is not your origin heaven is my
[1:14:52] origin and when the book came out he
[1:14:55] restored me back to my origin
[1:14:58] because perfect faith is my origin
[1:15:02] praise the lord and he was watching
[1:15:05] how that judah had become drunken
[1:15:09] they have become obsessed with sin now
[1:15:11] watch now
[1:15:12] in the days when josiah had the book
[1:15:14] restored he's in the days also of
[1:15:16] jeremiah the prophet
[1:15:17] and we've had a prophet like jeremiah in
[1:15:19] the last days is that right
[1:15:21] praise the lord a major prophet but
[1:15:24] here's one like habakkuk coming out
[1:15:26] that's your people amen
[1:15:29] that's all of you you're the habakkuk
[1:15:33] watching things happening
[1:15:36] on the earth babylon
[1:15:40] mystery babylon now moving in with a
[1:15:43] complete takeover
[1:15:46] but the book was what happened
[1:15:49] had his face in because the
[1:15:53] book was his stability the book
[1:15:56] revealed his origins and the book was
[1:15:59] holding him
[1:16:00] it's not you holding god as god holding
[1:16:02] you
[1:16:05] you can so many people say i'm holding
[1:16:07] on to god no you're not god's holding on
[1:16:08] to you
[1:16:10] if god's not holding on to you you will
[1:16:13] not last
[1:16:15] is that right it's god holding on to you
[1:16:20] and he does not choose you to lose you
[1:16:22] and i'm not being poetic
[1:16:25] amen praise the lord
[1:16:30] and so he's just seen judah sorry
[1:16:33] israel taken away by the assyrians
[1:16:36] then the babylonians took over the
[1:16:38] assyrians now the babylonians are going
[1:16:40] to come into judah
[1:16:41] and take away judah because judah has
[1:16:44] left
[1:16:44] the word of the lord amen
[1:16:47] and when they leave the word of the lord
[1:16:49] hell comes up like a flood
[1:16:51] now remember that what i've just told
[1:16:53] you
[1:16:55] we'll get into this later on if we get
[1:16:58] later on
[1:16:59] so now he had to have confidence
[1:17:03] he had to have an attitude when he saw
[1:17:07] evil
[1:17:07] moving in on the earth for a complete
[1:17:09] takeover now i'm just going to go and
[1:17:11] read you
[1:17:12] uh put up now the next one
[1:17:17] now watch this man he's seeing the evil
[1:17:20] on the earth
[1:17:21] and he says he says uh
[1:17:24] when i heard my belly trembled
[1:17:28] amen one part of him is frightened
[1:17:32] i had my lips quivered at the voice
[1:17:34] rodness entered into my bones and i
[1:17:36] trembled on myself that i might rest on
[1:17:38] the day of trouble
[1:17:40] we are in a day of trouble and i need to
[1:17:43] have rest in the day of trouble
[1:17:46] when he cometh up to the people he will
[1:17:48] invade them with his troops
[1:17:51] and he says although the fig tree shall
[1:17:53] not blossom
[1:17:54] watch the words no there shall be fruit
[1:17:57] on the vines
[1:17:58] the labor of the olive uh fail and the
[1:18:00] fields yield no mood and color from the
[1:18:02] fall
[1:18:02] uh the flock shall we cut off from the
[1:18:04] fold and there be no herd in the stalls
[1:18:06] there's economic failure
[1:18:12] so the economies are failing it says i'm
[1:18:15] seeing the economies
[1:18:16] failing
[1:18:20] through a roman inspired conspiracy
[1:18:23] the economies are failing
[1:18:29] yet i will rejoice
[1:18:34] in the lord i will joy in the god of my
[1:18:38] salvation
[1:18:39] the one who chose me i am going to have
[1:18:41] joy in that salvation
[1:18:43] the lord is my strength when in a time
[1:18:45] of trouble
[1:18:46] [Applause]
[1:18:49] and he will make my feet like hinds feet
[1:18:52] and he will make me walk upon
[1:18:54] high places i'm not going down to low
[1:18:56] places
[1:18:57] i'm out of the church ages i've come up
[1:18:59] into revelations four
[1:19:01] i've been caught up into him that came
[1:19:03] down
[1:19:06] amen and when john got caught up to him
[1:19:09] that came down what did john see
[1:19:12] john saw john
[1:19:17] amen the holy ghost in this hour
[1:19:22] connects you to the realization of your
[1:19:25] theophany
[1:19:32] it does not connect you to new zealand
[1:19:35] or south africa
[1:19:36] or wherever you come from it connects
[1:19:39] you to your theophany
[1:19:41] because your theophany is a word body
[1:19:43] the attribute is the word and the word
[1:19:45] must come to the word
[1:19:47] and it's only in the time of the eagle
[1:19:50] that you can be removed from the
[1:19:51] gravitational pull
[1:19:52] up into your reality and the prophet of
[1:19:55] god's word says we are bumping into
[1:19:57] those angels
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:00] you're coming to a meeting and the
[1:20:02] inspiration strikes
[1:20:03] he says you're bumping into angels
[1:20:09] praise the lord now you're a crazy man
[1:20:14] the way that they call crazy is the way
[1:20:16] that i worship my
[1:20:18] god amen
[1:20:21] praise the lord do you want to call me a
[1:20:24] crazy man thank you jesus
[1:20:29] now watch now
[1:20:35] a compression of events
[1:20:38] now yeah and if you catch this you'll
[1:20:41] understand genesis to revelation
[1:20:44] a compression of events in their
[1:20:46] heavenly and earthly
[1:20:49] parallels amazing thing
[1:20:55] now when we look at an occurrence on the
[1:20:58] earth
[1:20:59] we must realize brothers and sisters
[1:21:01] that a heavenly dimension is affecting
[1:21:03] it
[1:21:04] amen nothing's out of control heaven's
[1:21:07] controlling everything
[1:21:08] he says well the devil is doing this the
[1:21:10] devil is doing that yet but who's over
[1:21:12] the devil god is over the devil
[1:21:16] i think he made him for just say i'll
[1:21:19] just go and kill him off look he's there
[1:21:22] to be a contrast to bring god's
[1:21:24] character
[1:21:25] out in you so don't try to avoid
[1:21:29] the character building character
[1:21:31] building comes from ups and downs
[1:21:33] praise the lord now says
[1:21:36] and then he says in the lord's prayer he
[1:21:38] says
[1:21:39] let it be done on earth as it is in
[1:21:42] heaven
[1:21:44] so everything that's been done in this
[1:21:48] earth here
[1:21:50] your 16th element earth is to reflect
[1:21:53] heaven
[1:21:54] see i thought it was this is yes it's
[1:21:55] that earth too but we're also on earth
[1:21:59] let it be done let it be done on earth
[1:22:01] on in my earth
[1:22:02] let it reflect the prophecy coming from
[1:22:05] heaven
[1:22:07] praise the lord and jesus says in john 3
[1:22:09] verse 12 he says
[1:22:10] if i have told you earthly things and
[1:22:12] you believe not
[1:22:14] how shall you believe if i tell you
[1:22:15] heavenly things
[1:22:17] amen says that no man hath ascended up
[1:22:20] to heaven but he that came down from
[1:22:22] heaven even the son of man which is in
[1:22:23] heaven
[1:22:24] says what he's here
[1:22:28] but he's there so many sense
[1:22:33] now people could see jesus earthly
[1:22:35] actions
[1:22:37] but they could not see him being
[1:22:38] controlled by another world
[1:22:42] come on now he was here
[1:22:46] yet he was there
[1:22:53] what are you by a new birth
[1:22:57] i'm here but i'm here
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:05] i'm here but i'm not here
[1:23:10] because i'm looking at things for
[1:23:12] different eyes
[1:23:14] if i'm down here i'm looking at things
[1:23:17] just chaos and problems and things and
[1:23:19] that but when i'm up here i say
[1:23:21] all is well praise the lord
[1:23:25] all as well because the god who created
[1:23:29] me is in control of
[1:23:30] every situation and the prophet of god
[1:23:33] says
[1:23:34] never let a negative thought come out of
[1:23:36] your mouth
[1:23:37] because the moment that you speak a
[1:23:39] negative thought you're in the devil's
[1:23:41] territory
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:46] did he say that yes
[1:23:50] he did say that a negative
[1:23:53] thought you're in the devil's territory
[1:23:58] now watch now his body was
[1:24:02] a stumbling block to the people
[1:24:05] but inside of him was the throne of
[1:24:09] mercy
[1:24:10] and a throne of judgment
[1:24:13] now in my theme it's about the
[1:24:15] compression of events
[1:24:18] that every bible type releases
[1:24:21] the information of for the fullness at
[1:24:24] the end time now watch now
[1:24:33] we see five women here all those five
[1:24:36] women is
[1:24:37] you compressed into
[1:24:42] one woman is that right
[1:24:46] now ruth came out of the church ages but
[1:24:48] she's not called a queen
[1:24:51] amen did you come out of the church ages
[1:24:53] yes
[1:24:54] so we'll take this part of ruth that's
[1:24:57] part of me
[1:24:59] she meets the lord of the harvest boaz
[1:25:01] but first she meets the chief ripper
[1:25:03] is that right but she's not called the
[1:25:06] queen
[1:25:07] the queen part i'm going to have to go
[1:25:08] to esther right
[1:25:13] like she's come out uh ruth's come out
[1:25:14] of the churches church ages i've come
[1:25:16] out of the church ages also i'm like
[1:25:18] esther so i'm a queen also
[1:25:21] amen so i'm taking this piece and this
[1:25:24] piece
[1:25:25] and this piece and compressing it into
[1:25:27] me and to you
[1:25:28] well a sarah as she is she's not a queen
[1:25:31] either
[1:25:32] but the thing about sarah she's the one
[1:25:33] who had the body change
[1:25:35] so an aspect of my life is i'm having a
[1:25:38] body change
[1:25:39] so now i'm taking this this first verse
[1:25:42] and putting into here and that's me
[1:25:44] and there's rahab the harlot and she had
[1:25:46] to have the holy ghost
[1:25:47] on display in the time of the judgment
[1:25:49] in the land
[1:25:52] and the holy ghost has come into my life
[1:25:54] to connect me to the word
[1:25:57] i'm a privileged person here you are a
[1:25:59] privileged people
[1:26:00] we are being connected to the word in an
[1:26:02] hour of judgment
[1:26:03] and praise god for the hour of judgment
[1:26:06] because the squatters are going to be
[1:26:07] leaving the earth soon
[1:26:12] and they strut around saying we are the
[1:26:13] most important people we've been voted
[1:26:15] in
[1:26:17] you as a squatter and squatters can't
[1:26:20] stay in the house
[1:26:22] i've got an eviction notice
[1:26:25] for you my title deed
[1:26:28] is your eviction notice
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:35] are you with me now the eviction notice
[1:26:38] has come
[1:26:41] praise the lord and rebecca well she
[1:26:45] wasn't a queen
[1:26:46] but she met eliezer what did eliezer
[1:26:48] give her
[1:26:50] goat silver
[1:26:54] and a change of raiment for a body
[1:26:57] change
[1:27:00] gave her gold because she's deity gave a
[1:27:03] silver because
[1:27:04] redemption is coming into the fullness
[1:27:05] of expression so is redemption
[1:27:08] but gave her gave her a change of
[1:27:12] raiment
[1:27:13] because we are being robed with a holy
[1:27:15] ghost robe
[1:27:16] to take a body change praise the lord
[1:27:20] for a message that can come and change
[1:27:22] our bodies
[1:27:25] let's go deeply
[1:27:32] now watch
[1:27:36] we're going to use the compression of
[1:27:37] events in
[1:27:39] the life of david because david
[1:27:43] is a church coming into power
[1:27:48] amen read marriage and divorce brother
[1:27:49] baby says david's church come into power
[1:27:52] so what we're going to do now is take
[1:27:54] events
[1:27:55] that happen to david's life and bring it
[1:27:58] right up to the end time
[1:28:00] because david is releasing
[1:28:03] something that you need to connect with
[1:28:06] now watch this now
[1:28:10] i'd love it when i saw the lawsuit put
[1:28:12] this in i don't even understand it
[1:28:15] he said and he come and showed me i'm
[1:28:18] not a bright boy i ain't been to school
[1:28:20] well i have been to school but i've got
[1:28:22] no degrees
[1:28:24] you know what acts chapter 15
[1:28:27] the book of acts the holy ghost is
[1:28:29] moving amongst the gentiles
[1:28:32] and simeon has declared how god is
[1:28:35] speaking about the gentiles now coming
[1:28:36] in
[1:28:37] at that at the first dead visit the
[1:28:39] gentiles to take them out a people for
[1:28:41] his name
[1:28:42] and to this agree the words of the
[1:28:43] prophet as it is written
[1:28:45] after this i will return and build again
[1:28:47] the tabernacle of david
[1:28:49] he did not say the tabernacle of moses
[1:28:56] this must be a mystery going on here
[1:28:58] he's not talking about three rooms
[1:29:00] anymore
[1:29:01] he's talking about one room in one room
[1:29:04] he says i'll meet you
[1:29:05] in that place i'm not going to meet you
[1:29:08] in your intelligence i'm not going to
[1:29:10] meet you in your body i'm going to meet
[1:29:12] you in that place
[1:29:13] and in that place is where the rapture
[1:29:15] happens in this place
[1:29:18] that david made for the ark
[1:29:26] amen
[1:29:30] i will return i build the tabernacle of
[1:29:32] david which has fallen down
[1:29:35] praise the lord and i will build again
[1:29:38] the ruins thereof and i'll set it up
[1:29:41] i'm going to bring the soul into
[1:29:43] connection
[1:29:45] i'm going to bring the soul into
[1:29:46] connection with the reality
[1:29:48] of what was in the tent
[1:29:52] an attribute is coming into meta
[1:29:54] expression
[1:29:56] and god wants you to concentrate on what
[1:29:59] matters to him
[1:30:01] is the tense
[1:30:06] that's this man now
[1:30:09] now david was not a priest he was king
[1:30:15] now this tent it's on the move
[1:30:20] it was in the hands of the philistines
[1:30:23] amen so this ark sorry was on the way
[1:30:27] out of the hands of the philistines and
[1:30:29] david
[1:30:31] gets a hold of this ark and it's on a
[1:30:34] journey out of the enemy's hands
[1:30:37] and david wants to set it in its right
[1:30:39] place in jerusalem
[1:30:41] what are we new jerusalem
[1:30:45] is that right so it's on its transition
[1:30:50] and it's on a cart and david said we
[1:30:53] can't have it on a cart
[1:30:56] we're going to take it off the cart i
[1:30:58] can't leave it exposed to the elements
[1:31:00] oh my god so i'm going to make
[1:31:05] a tent for the ark
[1:31:08] i am going to make the tent for the ark
[1:31:16] amen and the ark
[1:31:20] so what he does he gets to preach the
[1:31:22] priest's robes he's not a priest now
[1:31:25] and he puts on the priest's ephod
[1:31:28] beautiful garments and he goes up to the
[1:31:31] ark and he's worshiping
[1:31:32] in the ark and he's not even a priest
[1:31:36] to show at the end time
[1:31:39] god is going to make someone a priest to
[1:31:42] get access to god
[1:31:45] at the time of the rapture direct
[1:31:49] access to god in their one
[1:31:52] room tent that god is looking
[1:31:55] at this says
[1:31:59] he says in the book of hebrews after
[1:32:02] we've come to the lord we have no more
[1:32:04] consciousness of
[1:32:05] sin that made consciousness means desire
[1:32:09] for sin
[1:32:11] amen will you fall yes
[1:32:15] will you fall every day yes paul did
[1:32:19] did did the lord change his mind about
[1:32:20] paul i don't think so
[1:32:22] did the lord change his mind about
[1:32:24] brother brennan when he uh got uh got
[1:32:25] caught up in some
[1:32:26] emotional things in the third pool no he
[1:32:29] did not go and
[1:32:30] and put but push the prophet away when
[1:32:32] in the standing in the gap sermon
[1:32:34] he just corrected the prophet and we can
[1:32:37] stand correction because we are the seed
[1:32:39] of god
[1:32:40] and though we fall though we fall he
[1:32:42] says you're going to fall
[1:32:44] but you're not going to stay down there
[1:32:45] grizzling and carrying on and snotting
[1:32:47] up and things like that to get back up
[1:32:49] again
[1:32:52] praise the lord so he's showing an
[1:32:56] end time position and this amazing thing
[1:33:01] that brother branham he's going to
[1:33:02] preach
[1:33:04] the rapture and who does he preach about
[1:33:11] david he will hide me
[1:33:16] in his pavilion in a time
[1:33:20] of trouble i don't want the troubles
[1:33:24] whether you won't be in the rapture then
[1:33:29] the rapture has to have a time of
[1:33:31] trouble
[1:33:35] you can't say oh i don't want there to
[1:33:37] be troubles god says it's a time of
[1:33:38] trouble
[1:33:39] and every time there was a rapture in
[1:33:40] the bible a trumpet was sounding and
[1:33:42] there was troubles
[1:33:45] because the troubles is what perfects
[1:33:48] you
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:53] praise the lord i don't know i'm going
[1:33:57] to get through this but we'll just give
[1:33:58] it a go anyway
[1:33:59] i'm only going to go for so long and
[1:34:00] then i'm going to say stop and i'm
[1:34:03] only going to go for so long then i'm
[1:34:04] going to say so long
[1:34:09] now watch this he's so inspired
[1:34:15] that his book of life is
[1:34:18] watching the ark the book of life now
[1:34:22] and suddenly the lamb's book within him
[1:34:25] screams out and he starts worshiping the
[1:34:28] lord
[1:34:30] because there's something inside of him
[1:34:31] the eternal part
[1:34:33] realizes what's going on now watch now
[1:34:40] david
[1:34:44] he got a revelation
[1:34:47] of the ark and when he prophesied of
[1:34:50] what was going to be end time actions
[1:34:56] here he is a king acting like a priest
[1:35:00] and what did the lord say about us will
[1:35:02] be made kings and priests unto our god
[1:35:04] because the book has been opened
[1:35:06] access has been made into the presence
[1:35:08] of
[1:35:09] god maybe i'll talk about that on monday
[1:35:12] or whenever
[1:35:16] a man-made tent and the prophet's
[1:35:18] preaching uh the lamb's book of life or
[1:35:20] something like that way back in the
[1:35:21] 1950s
[1:35:22] he says and and and he says when he's
[1:35:25] looking at that little tent about the
[1:35:26] third pool and after all the the fishing
[1:35:28] and all that sort of thing
[1:35:30] as he says and brother bran was behind
[1:35:31] the pulpit resting so after the prophets
[1:35:33] gone off the scene
[1:35:34] amen after that after 1965
[1:35:38] things is happening and life is coming
[1:35:41] into the elect
[1:35:42] right at the end it says i'll meet you
[1:35:45] in that place
[1:35:47] i'll meet you in that place only and in
[1:35:51] that place
[1:35:52] is the word but it has emotions
[1:35:56] okay it has emotions but it's not
[1:36:00] emotions because for emotions sake
[1:36:02] it's because the word is producing the
[1:36:04] emotions
[1:36:06] it is not they a pentecostal emotions
[1:36:09] it is the word of god causing the
[1:36:11] emotions
[1:36:14] when and troubleless
[1:36:18] times are you with me now
[1:36:24] now each age
[1:36:28] has an allotted word of prophecy to be
[1:36:30] fulfilled is that right
[1:36:32] each age has its pressures its
[1:36:34] activities and
[1:36:35] and poses uncertainties
[1:36:38] so the holy spirit comes and strengthens
[1:36:41] the elect
[1:36:42] in each age
[1:36:45] now what does the word strengthen mean
[1:36:48] different to what i thought
[1:36:52] have a look
[1:36:55] now the lord's coming up to peter and
[1:36:57] peter's setting a pattern for every holy
[1:36:59] ghost believer
[1:37:02] the time brothers and sisters that you
[1:37:04] come to church
[1:37:06] and all you want to do is sit there and

[1:37:57] backs out of it
[1:38:00] you follow the lord don't follow the man
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:04] praise the lord it's time for you to

[1:42:21] an agreement to sell out the lord into a
[1:42:23] false
[1:42:24] union amen and many disciples
[1:42:27] disciples including peter were not
[1:42:29] understanding the cycle of prophecy
[1:42:31] that was moving right in front of them
[1:42:37] and here was jesus preparing himself to
[1:42:40] fulfill
[1:42:40] his scriptures and order that they would
[1:42:43] become recipients of redemption
[1:42:46] and take their positions at the feast of
[1:42:49] pentecost
[1:42:50] that jesus had to do his part in order
[1:42:53] they could have
[1:42:54] their part but they were not
[1:42:56] understanding his part
[1:42:58] so they did not understand what was
[1:42:59] coming to them but when they understood
[1:43:01] his part
[1:43:02] then they could then understand their
[1:43:04] part

[1:43:10] watch that what's the words
[1:43:12] to strengthen this completely

[1:43:23] face steadfastly
[1:43:27] amen to set a person's face steadfast
[1:43:32] now steadfast does not mean
[1:43:38] it's steadfast i'm achieving the goal
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:43] amen ministers steadfast
[1:43:48] get them off the earthly things into the
[1:43:51] heavenly things and set their face

[1:44:46] can you say amen
[1:44:49] this world is too
[1:44:52] powerful for you to overcome on your own
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:59] but i'm being led by the one
[1:45:02] who knows what jezebel's up to
[1:45:06] and as long as he's holding my hand and
[1:45:08] leading me
[1:45:10] i can go anywhere he wants me to go
[1:45:16] you mr gray cannot go into europe
[1:45:20] because of this you cannot get into
[1:45:22] switzerland because of this

[1:45:26] won't be able to get there
[1:45:27] so and you'll blow your doe if you go
[1:45:29] and buy tickets

[1:45:35] document visa and you've got to have a
[1:45:37] quarantine this and a quarantine that
[1:45:40] and so you cannot go and i would advise
[1:45:43] you to stay home
[1:45:45] but i want to see my daughter and my
[1:45:47] granddaughters who my granddaughter have
[1:45:48] never met before

[1:45:57] the world
[1:45:59] where did you see me

[1:46:05] and europe
[1:46:09] you know what's the lord god to do he's
[1:46:11] controlling everything
[1:46:13] so he's got to go and make a way
[1:46:16] for us to get into europe but kiwis are
[1:46:20] not allowed in europe or switzerland
[1:46:23] the only way you can get into
[1:46:24] switzerland is if your wife has a swiss
[1:46:27] passport
[1:46:29] and she does
[1:46:31] [Laughter]
[1:46:36] praise the lord i said wrote to the
[1:46:39] government this was said
[1:46:40] are you sure i can get in they sent me
[1:46:42] with three prizes yes you can come
[1:46:45] now australia was a real mission to get
[1:46:47] through
[1:46:48] oh my goodness me i won't say anything
[1:46:50] about that
[1:46:52] get into switzerland go up to the
[1:46:55] passport people
[1:46:56] stamp stamp straight through not even a
[1:46:59] question asked
[1:47:01] i'm flabbergasted now i'm in europe
[1:47:05] thinking that i'm going there to see my
[1:47:08] family
[1:47:08] our family wasn't for that at all that's
[1:47:10] only part of it
[1:47:11] was to preach to the saints
[1:47:15] i had no idea i was going in there to
[1:47:16] preach to the saints
[1:47:18] and god was making a way he blinded me
[1:47:21] to what was coming and when i got there
[1:47:23] revealed it to me
[1:47:25] because if i hadn't known i was going in
[1:47:26] there to to preach i would have probably
[1:47:28] got a little bit nervous
[1:47:32] is that right brother tazewell get
[1:47:34] nervous
[1:47:36] but he blinds you sometimes to those
[1:47:37] things he's going to take you into
[1:47:39] and praise god that he does that so now
[1:47:42] to make
[1:47:42] one's face steadfast oh man i haven't
[1:47:45] even got into my subject yet
[1:47:47] but anyway now jesus
[1:47:51] here he isn't and luke 9 51 when and
[1:47:54] and it came to pass that when the time
[1:47:56] was come that he should be received up
[1:47:58] he steadfastly set his face to jerusalem
[1:48:01] the word steadfastly means strengthened
[1:48:04] he did not waver this way
[1:48:06] he did not waver that i'm going to
[1:48:08] achieve what god
[1:48:09] set me out to achieve he is the redeemer
[1:48:13] i am going to complete redemption
[1:48:15] redemption is not going to be something
[1:48:17] that's going to be particularly nice on
[1:48:18] my flesh
[1:48:19] but i'm going to complete redemption
[1:48:22] because in my heart i'm in a love affair
[1:48:25] and i'm looking at the joy that is set
[1:48:27] before me
[1:48:29] and who's the joy set before him you are
[1:48:33] praise the lord amen
[1:48:37] now watch what the prophet god says i
[1:48:40] like quotes sometimes yeah not all the
[1:48:42] time to to to you know to
[1:48:44] make a service go longer but it's good
[1:48:45] to have some quotes
[1:48:47] jesus told peter the night of the
[1:48:48] betrayal he was already saved
[1:48:51] he's but he's not converted he'll be
[1:48:53] he'll be you can
[1:48:54] be saved and still not have the holy
[1:48:56] ghost okay
[1:48:58] because he's a gene seed the seed that
[1:49:01] was put in
[1:49:02] to peter was already in peter was going
[1:49:04] to take him to that position of the holy
[1:49:05] ghost
[1:49:07] he might be shadowed over with this and
[1:49:08] shadowed over with that it does not
[1:49:10] matter how many shadows are over you
[1:49:12] brothers and sisters
[1:49:13] when your time and season has come the
[1:49:16] show
[1:49:16] the rising of the sun will shine upon
[1:49:18] that seed and the seed will come to life
[1:49:21] may it be these meetings that the seed
[1:49:23] comes to life
[1:49:25] praise the lord now after you're
[1:49:27] converted
[1:49:28] strengthen the brethren that's right oh
[1:49:30] sure you accepted christ as your savior
[1:49:32] but you're
[1:49:32] but when you're converters when you're
[1:49:34] really changed but he hasn't changed yet
[1:49:37] he cursed before the lord and denied him
[1:49:40] and everything
[1:49:40] ah and he was a chain seed
[1:49:45] horrors upon horrors jesus told peter
[1:49:48] that had followed him and cast out
[1:49:50] devils and done miracles and everything
[1:49:52] he says you're not converted yet but
[1:49:54] after you're converted then strengthen
[1:49:55] the brethren
[1:49:56] now watch this so astounding
[1:50:02] jesus is directing his words at a
[1:50:05] pattern
[1:50:05] that he wants for every converted person
[1:50:08] now hear me now
[1:50:12] peter was a preacher
[1:50:17] but he never strengthened one person
[1:50:24] amen he cast out devils
[1:50:28] never strengthened one person he laid
[1:50:31] hands on the sick
[1:50:32] they recovered he never strengthened one
[1:50:34] person
[1:50:37] it goes quiet didn't it
[1:50:42] he knew john the baptist was elijah
[1:50:47] he had a revelation that jesus is the
[1:50:49] son of god in matthew chapter 6
[1:50:51] mark chapter 16.
[1:50:55] he had heard the seals being preached in
[1:50:57] matthew 24 in mystery form
[1:50:59] oh it's getting really touchy now
[1:51:00] wouldn't it
[1:51:05] he's under a son of man ministry
[1:51:09] jesus is a prophet like in this day
[1:51:15] yet he could be pressured by political
[1:51:18] religious circumstances to deny the lord
[1:51:22] because it was not converted
[1:51:26] he's laying hands on the sick casting
[1:51:27] out devils preaching the gospel and he's
[1:51:29] not converted and he's not strengthening
[1:51:31] one person
[1:51:35] that shocked me says now i know
[1:51:39] why so much so many ministers are
[1:51:42] falling away in this hour
[1:51:46] how can you walk away
[1:51:50] from the word you were never converted
[1:51:54] in the first place
[1:51:58] hey i'm not pc i said the way that it is
[1:52:02] you all know me
[1:52:03] i'm not some fairy walking around trying
[1:52:05] to say the right words
[1:52:09] now here was a spiritual trumpet that
[1:52:11] was going a spiritual war was being
[1:52:14] declared
[1:52:14] at the time when jesus was saying these
[1:52:16] things
[1:52:19] and they were humanly impossible to
[1:52:22] withstand
[1:52:23] and peter with all his zeal all his
[1:52:25] enthusiasm could not withstand those
[1:52:27] pressures
[1:52:28] even in this pressurizing day
[1:52:32] people are just falling away
[1:52:36] and the reason why the ministers are
[1:52:40] not pointing them to the vision
[1:52:46] is that right of a husband
[1:52:51] and his wife walking hand in hand
[1:52:55] upward onward christian soldiers
[1:52:59] back to eden again under a rapture cycle
[1:53:02] when the seventh seal has come down in a
[1:53:05] threefold manner
[1:53:06] what it was a seventh seer god himself
[1:53:08] coming down
[1:53:10] to reveal himself and
[1:53:13] take preeminences over the elect
[1:53:17] then positionally place them to take
[1:53:19] them back to eden
[1:53:21] and the biggest problem is that people
[1:53:23] cannot give god the preeminences
[1:53:26] because to give god the preeminences you
[1:53:28] must become a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:53:31] and a prisoner has no agenda
[1:53:35] of his or her own
[1:53:47] we've got our ambitions oh i want to be
[1:53:50] so educated
[1:53:52] oh i want to be so rich oh i want to be
[1:53:55] so this and so that
[1:53:58] but that's not giving god the
[1:53:59] preeminence that's what you want what
[1:54:01] does god want
[1:54:04] praise the lord amen
[1:54:10] now watch in our church lately
[1:54:13] but our el rey has been preaching some
[1:54:15] stuff on
[1:54:16] divine love and philly i love and all
[1:54:18] that and which has been a real blessing
[1:54:20] to our church
[1:54:22] is that right brethren from taranaki
[1:54:24] that is
[1:54:26] now peter is caught in a confusion
[1:54:31] watch this man he's confused
[1:54:35] now jesus is after the resurrection
[1:54:40] amen where are we
[1:54:44] in a resurrection time there's been a
[1:54:46] second crucifixion of jesus christ is
[1:54:48] that right
[1:54:49] and there's a resurrection time
[1:54:53] and when they had dying jesus saith unto
[1:54:56] peter
[1:54:56] simon son of jonas lover sell me more
[1:54:59] than these
[1:55:01] and peter is totally confused he thinks
[1:55:03] he's talking about human love
[1:55:06] he's not do you love me with divine love
[1:55:11] he's confused he said yeah lord you know
[1:55:14] us though i love thee
[1:55:17] with for leo or human love he's not
[1:55:19] talking about
[1:55:20] philio love or human love he's talking
[1:55:22] about do you love me because of who i am
[1:55:24] and i am the word
[1:55:27] he said feed my lambs
[1:55:31] amen he's going to get really confused
[1:55:34] he sat on until him again the second
[1:55:36] time simon son of jonas lovers tell me
[1:55:38] in others do you have divine love for me
[1:55:40] he said to them lord they all know that
[1:55:42] i love thee with philly i love
[1:55:44] come on now you're not you're not
[1:55:46] getting it because what is divine love
[1:55:48] divine love is sacrificial love divine
[1:55:50] love lays down its life for
[1:55:52] others it does not think of itself
[1:55:55] and when you give yourself to lord that
[1:55:57] divine love gives preeminences to
[1:56:00] god
[1:56:03] he said feed my sheep yes now he's going
[1:56:06] to really rub it in
[1:56:10] and he says and the third time simon
[1:56:11] says son of jonas yeah love of me only
[1:56:13] with a human
[1:56:14] fully i love you see how he's just
[1:56:17] coming down to where he's at now
[1:56:18] is that all you love me with peter was
[1:56:22] grieved because he said unto him the
[1:56:23] third time love was telling me
[1:56:24] and said unto him uh lord they'll notice
[1:56:26] all these things you know that i love
[1:56:28] thee jesus said i'm gonna feed my sheep
[1:56:33] but he can't feed his sheep because
[1:56:35] you're not converted
[1:56:39] here's a conversion
[1:56:42] in other words peter after you're
[1:56:44] converted let divine love feed my sheep
[1:56:47] in other words peter no longer are you
[1:56:49] going to be deciding what you do with
[1:56:51] your life
[1:56:52] it's not your ambitions it's not your
[1:56:54] desires
[1:56:55] you are going to be so subjected to me
[1:56:57] as a prisoner
[1:56:58] i will be bridling you like the prophet
[1:57:00] talks about in the prison of jesus
[1:57:02] christ you'll be so bridled to it with
[1:57:03] me with divine love that i can turn you
[1:57:05] any way that you i want to turn you and
[1:57:08] not only that
[1:57:09] at the end of your life you will be
[1:57:10] crucified like i am
[1:57:18] this gets a bit tender doesn't it so now
[1:57:21] jesus is preparing peter for the next
[1:57:24] part of the prophetic season
[1:57:26] pentecost
[1:57:30] and peter is in a lap over time between
[1:57:33] passover and pentecost
[1:57:37] amen now watch what he says
[1:57:42] jesus said if you love me feed my sheep
[1:57:45] now he never did say share them a lot of
[1:57:47] people like fleecing the sheep
[1:57:50] is that right he didn't say fleece the
[1:57:52] sheep he said feed the sheep
[1:57:57] he never said educate my sheep
[1:58:00] brother i want you to understand what
[1:58:03] the
[1:58:04] fantasy it means this and this and this
[1:58:07] and this well i want to see it working
[1:58:08] out in flesh and life thundering itself
[1:58:10] out
[1:58:11] praise the lord he said feed them well
[1:58:13] sheep is
[1:58:14] well sheep is correctly fed with sheep
[1:58:16] food and sheep food is the word for a
[1:58:18] man shall not live by word alone by
[1:58:20] everywhere that precedes out of the
[1:58:21] mouth of god
[1:58:22] and the food that they're looking for is
[1:58:24] life looks
[1:58:25] for life does not look for theology
[1:58:28] does not look for to be the most
[1:58:30] educated person in the message
[1:58:32] is looking for life
[1:58:37] hey praise the lord
[1:58:43] now watch this now sheep food i'm just
[1:58:45] building this up oh man i'm not even
[1:58:46] going to get i haven't even laid the
[1:58:47] platform yet
[1:58:50] i'm sorry but you know i can only go so
[1:58:52] far and i must still
[1:58:54] this the bodies are still a pest house
[1:58:55] you know
[1:58:58] sheep food the bible said we've just
[1:59:00] come through it over here in the church
[1:59:02] ages jesus is the hidden man of christ
[1:59:03] is the church's manner so we're talking
[1:59:05] about the manner we're talking about
[1:59:06] christ
[1:59:07] allotted out for each age to feed the
[1:59:09] sheep for that age
[1:59:11] you cannot feed the sheep and luther's
[1:59:13] day a rapturing
[1:59:16] food because it will choke them
[1:59:20] because they are in the main age they
[1:59:22] ain't under an eagle anointing the same
[1:59:23] holy ghost
[1:59:25] under a man anointing oh choke him so i
[1:59:28] had to reserve it for people who are an
[1:59:30] attribute of god
[1:59:31] that god before the foundation of the
[1:59:32] world knew a part of himself had to be
[1:59:34] put here
[1:59:35] and that part of yourself that is put
[1:59:37] here has been put here
[1:59:38] because there's uh there is something in
[1:59:41] you that can receive it
[1:59:45] forget about your head this is just the
[1:59:46] tree of knowledge
[1:59:48] it's just a tree of knowledge this is
[1:59:50] the tree of knowledge brethren
[1:59:52] this is where this is the tree of life
[1:59:56] praise the lord and he says if you've
[1:59:58] gone so far on the tree of knowledge
[1:59:59] jump over onto the other tree
[2:00:01] because the tree of knowledge will only
[2:00:03] go so far
[2:00:05] and all your you're studying and
[2:00:08] everything else
[2:00:09] and knowing how it all fits together
[2:00:11] will only go so far
[2:00:12] but now you have to step into revelation
[2:00:15] of what he's talking about
[2:00:16] because he is between the lines in a
[2:00:18] love letter is that right
[2:00:20] he says and christ is that hidden manner
[2:00:22] that comes from god out of heaven afresh
[2:00:24] every day
[2:00:24] every day we can't say well two weeks
[2:00:26] ago i had a great experience of god
[2:00:28] what about right now
[2:00:30] [Applause]
[2:00:32] praise the lord what about right now
[2:00:38] amen he says and we feast upon this
[2:00:42] manner which is christ and he sustains
[2:00:43] us through the journey till we reach the
[2:00:45] land on the other side
[2:00:46] now that's what he meant by feed my
[2:00:48] sheep amen
[2:00:50] now let's go a little bit further now
[2:00:58] now
[2:01:01] when peter reached the feast of passover
[2:01:05] everything changed i'm sorry we reached
[2:01:07] the feast of pentecost
[2:01:09] everything changed
[2:01:14] by conversion everything
[2:01:17] changes praise the lord by a conversion
[2:01:22] peter is not speaking about something
[2:01:26] he is the first one
[2:01:31] amen he is the one
[2:01:35] who life is speaking through the channel
[2:01:38] outwards he's not speaking about
[2:01:41] something
[2:01:41] he is the identity speaking
[2:01:45] praise the lord do you get it now
[2:01:49] you can talk about this and you can talk
[2:01:51] about that but i want to know
[2:01:53] who has god made you
[2:01:59] now he's speaking from his own identity
[2:02:03] his own position and his connection to
[2:02:05] the present tense prophecy
[2:02:07] that's coming to pass all around them
[2:02:12] and he knows i'm the mouthpiece of god
[2:02:18] i'm the tabernacle of gods i'm the
[2:02:20] temple of god
[2:02:22] i'm the temple that's connected to
[2:02:24] eternity praise the lord
[2:02:28] and jesus says back in john 21 he says
[2:02:32] verily very i sound to you now this is
[2:02:33] before this now it says when you were
[2:02:35] young
[2:02:36] and you didn't have the holy ghost
[2:02:40] you gird yourself and you walk wherever
[2:02:42] you would but when you shall be old you
[2:02:44] shall stretch forth thy hands
[2:02:46] and another shall gird thee and carry
[2:02:48] their weather whether you shall wood is
[2:02:49] not
[2:02:50] neither in other words peter after

[2:03:03] problems but as i ain't going to remove
[2:03:05] the anchor

[2:03:10] and you are one scary person to the
[2:03:12] devil in that state
[2:03:15] i want to make the devil so miserable
[2:03:18] when he ever sees me says oh no
[2:03:22] he wants to go away for lunch real quick

[2:06:14] is that right it says but god has
[2:06:18] commissioned me
[2:06:19] to make a pyramid which is the second
[2:06:23] bible now
[2:06:27] so i've been building this pyramid
[2:06:32] now this pyramid on the outside is from
[2:06:34] eternity to eternity
[2:06:35] and what you see with the visible part
[2:06:38] is the time
[2:06:39] realm and inside of the pyramid i have
[2:06:42] designed it a certain way by inspiration
[2:06:44] of the holy ghost
[2:06:46] and there are and there's a moses law
[2:06:48] going down
[2:06:49] there and it stops there and then and
[2:06:51] then up
[2:06:52] here is coming into the grace time and
[2:06:54] there's seven steps going up to there
[2:06:57] and there's a platform there where the
[2:06:58] messenger of the age stands
[2:07:00] and there's and and there's and there's
[2:07:02] two little dips there where it's the
[2:07:03] first and second pill
[2:07:04] and after that dip is where the king's
[2:07:06] chamber is
[2:07:10] well what about the top of the pyramid
[2:07:12] well the top of the pyramid
[2:07:16] the inspiration has told me to leave it
[2:07:18] off
[2:07:21] because that part is for the end time
[2:07:27] amen
[2:07:31] now enoch what is the political world
[2:07:33] like out there right now
[2:07:36] well it's just well there's perversions
[2:07:40] all over the place
[2:07:41] there's men there's woman there are
[2:07:43] transvestites there's this states and
[2:07:44] that starts and every other kind of
[2:07:46] states
[2:07:47] they don't know whether the he or she or
[2:07:48] me was
[2:07:52] and and guess what science
[2:07:57] is just going through the roof
[2:08:01] they're inventing things
[2:08:05] enoch what
[2:08:08] is causing this to happen
[2:08:14] me
[2:08:21] i'm causing it to happen because the
[2:08:24] anointing on me
[2:08:26] is falling on them
[2:08:32] and when i'm building the ark i don't
[2:08:34] even have to speak
[2:08:36] i'm prophesying by my
[2:08:39] actions that's why he says you're
[2:08:42] written epistles
[2:08:44] read of all men you don't even have to
[2:08:46] speak
[2:08:47] and you're prophesying
[2:08:50] you mean to say that you're prophesying
[2:08:54] by building something
[2:08:56] yes and
[2:08:59] jude could catch
[2:09:03] a vision of that pyramid
[2:09:07] and knew what that missing part meant
[2:09:11] the lord comes with ten thousands
[2:09:15] of his saints to execute judgment
[2:09:18] upon all the ungodly upon the earth
[2:09:24] and so at the end time
[2:09:28] comes a little bright humbly out
[2:09:32] and remember i'm only saying things that
[2:09:33] flesh in front of my face okay
[2:09:37] and catches the revelation of the image
[2:09:40] that daniel saw
[2:09:43] amen now remember now what happens on a
[2:09:47] worldwide scale
[2:09:49] happens on an inside scale you were born
[2:09:53] with an image that has been built up
[2:09:56] over generations inside of you

[2:10:01] image and you've got a
[2:10:02] you've got a persian image and you've
[2:10:04] got sports and you've got philosophy and
[2:10:06] you've got all this built up inside of
[2:10:07] yourself
[2:10:09] is that right you inherited it through
[2:10:12] your
[2:10:12] earthly genetics but along
[2:10:15] comes the capstone
[2:10:20] and that capstone which is your prophecy
[2:10:24] comes and smacks that image and it
[2:10:28] smacks
[2:10:28] this image and it breaks down
[2:10:32] your old image oh i'm not wanting to be
[2:10:36] an all black anymore
[2:10:41] because the holy ghost has hit the image
[2:10:45] and the old me is going down

[2:10:52] lord
