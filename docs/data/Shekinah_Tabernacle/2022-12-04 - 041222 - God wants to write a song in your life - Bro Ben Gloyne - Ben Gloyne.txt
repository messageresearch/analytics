the Lord welcome to the other side of the world God bless you great to have you here my brother we'll be looking forward to you coming so praise God you're here amen and man we've got a string of birthdays it's like the Lord decided Well around this time boom I'm going to dump a whole bunch of my children upon the Earth and praise the Lord so brother Steve at his 40th on Friday I believe it was so happy birthday praise the Lord and uh Shekinah the birthday girl's 18 today God bless you praise the lord it's great you can be here with us we can celebrate your birthday together amen we've

birthday's tomorrow but praise a lot [Applause] amen and I hope I got everyone if I have missed anyone I'm very sorry about that but happy birthday um yes praise a lot it's great to be a Christian isn't it amen so praise God let's um let's turn to the Book of Exodus this morning amen I trust your well happy rejoicing I mean just can't lose being a Christian I so I praise the Lord so Exodus 14 and 27. we're going to read a couple of verses here then um and then you can you can have your seats we're going to read verses 27 down to 15 and 1 and then we're going to just kind of pick it up uh later on in 15 if you want to keep your Bibles handy but I'm sure we you know the story all real well so amen I believe it's a Victory Day it's victory that's not defeat day it's Victory Day praise a lot amen Our God's done mightily amen amen and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and the waters returned and cover the Chariots and the horsemen and all the hosts of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them in other words they all died praise the Lord but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the Sea and the waters were wall unto them on their right hand and on their left thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore and Israel saw the great working a great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant Moses then saying Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea amen so may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning and you know it's um this is kind of funny because brother Isaac just wrote a song and she kind of sang it last night but before that I was I was I was list I was reading um brother Baron speaking from a man running from the prince of the Lord and he says do you believe God is an all inspiration God has to write a song and that and that that phrase just jumped only God has to write a song and so when I talk about God wanting to write a song I'm not necessarily talking about a songwriter otherwise brother Isaac's just got the Lion's Share and you know but it's more than all you know you know answer your sister Esther or Christine's written some songs and Andy and yes you have it they're good don't look at me like that amen that's funny my life amen but you know God God wants to write a song in our life praise the Lord and so I'm not now saying you're going to write a song with with verses and and bridges and choruses but God wants to use a testimony and he wants it to to to to turn into a worship amen that's what that's the whole point of testimony is it would turn into a worship it wouldn't be a wouldn't be well I did this and this what happened no it's it's a testament what God has done in our lives so God has to write a song so he wants to write a song in your life amen so now we know that God but you know you know in him is the fullness you know he is the fullness of God here by thee all that the word is he is because he is the word right but now the word has to go from just a thought that he thought that it's spoken but it has to become material has to materialize like John would say in John 1 and 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us this is verse 14 and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so the word as it went from in the beginning God created heavens and the Earth all the way down through the Old Testament there's a condescension of the word till it became flesh in Jesus Christ now when he talks about the word it's not ink on paper he's talking about the being the pillar of fire God himself he would come down and become material he would become flesh now God has songs in him God has testimonies in him God before the foundation of the world knew every testimony you would have and every Victory you would win and how our God would fight your battles and you know every every circumstance of them how close the devil got but when he when he got right in your face like Samson with the lion got right in Samson's face but the anointing Came Upon Samson and he tore her in two you know those kind of testimonies when you feel the breath of the enemy right you but God steps on the scene and intervenes God knew those testimonies he'd give you and he knew exactly what they would consist of and the worship that would come out of them praise the Lord but we do not worship God because we're robots we worship God out of free will we love him because we love him because we've chose to love him because he first loved us now I'm so thankful God gives us testimonies where we don't just talk about what brother Branham did or someone else did but God is alive today and he's the same God back there as the same God today and I'm so thankful that a book of Acts is being written in our midst amen of the acts of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives praise the Lord so I'm so thankful we serve a living God today he's not dead he's not an idea he's not an argument he's not a church building or organization he's a he he's a true and living God the word himself made flesh praise the Lord in US amen so I believe God has to write a song amen he has a burden he wants to write a song now it's incredible when you think about the great journey that songwriters go through when they write amazing songs you know it's not just uh you know sure there's a lot of people they're very gifted they'll sit in a room and they'll just because of commercial ways they know how to write songs and know how to make money out of different lyrics and things but those songs are all very good but but a real song comes from a testimony normally it's me times of great hardship and trial and and and and distress and worry that's when God wants to express himself as I said a few Sundays ago about David you know the reason we got the book of Psalms is because of the anguish and hardship and and trouble David went through that Christ will be expressed out of his life and it's the same thing with you and I you know you know this is a ragged walk this is not a Sunday school picnic kind of walk this is a battlefield I mean we've got trenches we've got armor we've got weapons but there's an enemy we're going to take his land we're going to drive him off our land hey man we're gonna We're not gonna take any prisoners we're going to show No Quarter we're going to destroy every devil I mean that comes against us by our God right but but we're in a battle praise the Lord but God wants to have testimonies through that battle I trust you're all with me today I'm you know I'm going somewhere with this because you know because because worship isn't just pointing back to it's it's it's it's it's prophesying I'll show you this here so now so so it has to you know great great songs come through great anguish you know there was you know we all know the song of uh uh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me that was written by a man named John Newton John Newton was involved in the slave trade and even though he said he became somewhat of a Christian during a storm when he was a captain on a slave ship he says he did not really become a full believer until many years after he left the slave train now no doubt no doubt the memories of what he did to those poor people there selling them as slaves taking them across the sea would have haunted him every every minute of the rest of his life of what he did to human life there and the great trouble that you know you you know a great you know evil that he did but you know he knew what it was like to sing Amazing Grace because he knew what it was like to be on a slave ship himself it wasn't a physical slavery he was in but he was a he was under he was in a slavery you know ship of sin and and he was bound for Destruction he knew it was only chained in darkness where there's no hope nothing at all you know trying to just drink his life away and just trying to live life whatever more but he knew what it's like to be on a slave ship but he knew what it was like for the for the government to give a decree from heaven there's come a time where slavery has come to an end I'm talking about I'm not just talking about natural slavery I'm talking about spiritual slavery so he knew what it was like for his slave change to be broken by the blood of Jesus Christ and he was like to go free Hallelujah and and to me that's why he could pen such a such a such a song that we still sing today amen because it came through testimony it came through great trials and hardship and but mainly it came through the saving grace of God Amen that he could truly sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I sing and I believe every True Believer could not sing that song and not be affected by its words it's still as powerful as that was first pinned down because God has to write a song Amen and he wanted that song written for That season but not just for that season but for this season I remember that we could stand under the open Word and see the full extent of our Redemption amen a wicked sing that song Hallelujah with great joy in Thanksgiving Hallelujah amen now now Moses you think about the journey that Moses and the children of Israel had to go through for the song of Moses to Be Sung it wasn't just a moment of hardship or even a lifetime it was generations of slavery they had just walked out of they had been in Egypt for 400 years and that moment right there marked that end of when they were in Egypt do you think about this 400 years living under a promise that they were going to be delivered and they were going to go back to the promised land they were going to dwell in that land they were living with that testimony that prophecy they were living under that prophecy and not only that they had the bones of Joseph that no doubt they could have a terrible day being whipped and beaten but I remember Joseph God God used Joseph and we came down here because God used them to to save our forebears but Joseph made his descendants promise don't bury me here he could have had one of the greatest tombs in Egypt he could have had the greatest one because he saved the whole nation not the whole nation but the whole world at that time amen but he said no don't bury me down here bury me up in the promised land and because because Joseph being a prophet just like his his father before him he was spiritually knew that they promised land was Northern land of flowing with milk and honey it was more than just a good land and we don't have slaves and oh or rather be slaves no more it was more than that it was more than just a place we can raise our families and have our inheritance but in that land was the resurrection it's the same thing with the word of God you know sure it makes good families it makes good churches makes great singers makes good preachers musicians whatever well makes great young people different things but it's more than that right it's a place of Resurrection bury me in Christ amen no matter what right so Joseph being spiritual says don't leave my bones here because sure Egypt was fine the tombs were good all those things but the resurrection was going to come forth out of the promised land amen so he said bury me so bury me up there so he had this so he gave them their commission when you leave because you will take my bones with you so the journey that they would they would they would go through for Moses to write this song was an incredible journey they would have the anguish of their of their boy babies being fed to the crocodiles they would have the anguish of being beaten and and killed and you know back-breaking toil and strife and hunger and murder and distress and you know their lives in Jeopardy every day because they were even less and Pharaoh's eyes in his horses or as men but there came a moment where this came to an end and and and here was the end of this because you think about it this wasn't just a them physically leaving Egypt that made them to Rejoice but now you think about it the greatest army that was ever in existence at that time had come to get them but but and that Army tried to follow them through the Red Sea but that Army drowned God killed that Army I mean because they needed to know that there was nothing upon the earth that could take them back into slavery I mean they needed to be very aware see it was one thing for them to leave Egypt then they could have been haunted by the thought Egypt could come get us they're the superpower of the world they could send their armies they could bring every every Soldier and they could take the promised land they could take us back so God wanted them to realize that they would not have to live under that fear anymore there was no worry God had to take out of their mind of them ever going back there amen and it's the same thing with you and I God destroys our enemies in the blood of Jesus Christ amen that we yo he takes away all fear and worry that we'd ever go back to the world being slaves Hallelujah there was nothing could make them return back into Egypt and the same thing with you and I you think about it you know generations of pain was was destroyed that day amen those spirits that yeah because you think about those slave masters no doubt the great Granddad was a slave master because normally the son learns the trade of the father right so you know so it's generations of slave masters going down you know if it was if the Egyptians had our English kind of style of last names that'd be called slave master their last name you like Bakers uh you're a Baker's Baker because someone was a baker or a Smith or you know whatever more so it would have been slave master Egyptian right so that would have been passed down that anointing would have been passed down but it came to an end where that anointing was eradicated Hallelujah says the same thing so nothing on the earth could make them return and it's the same thing when we walk through the blood of Jesus Christ amen the same spirits that maybe have beaten down generations of our forebears of lust or lying or stealing or murder or hatred or anger or Temple whatever it is that thing gets eradicated in the blood of Jesus Christ when you walk through amen when you accept Jesus Christ really as your savior and you believe what he did for you that down Calvary repented and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's like a person crossing the Red Sea and the devil can't follow you through then just like the Egyptian armies could not follow amen could not follow the Egyptians there they got drowned so every enemy amen is destroyed in the blood of Jesus Christ and the only thing that we can be tormented by is a memory right but the thing is the memory only goes so far when the devil gives it to you because he'll never remind you of the day where he was destroyed where he was cast out of your life where Faith Rose in your heart and he's now under your feet amen he never remind you that far he'll only remind you of what he did did until he gets cast out that's why you've always got to update him hold on that's yesterday's news let's read today's news devil amen today devil you're defeated today devil you're under my feet today devil I'm an overcomer and you're under my feet today devil you're defeated I'm Victorious that is today's news amen my Lord has conquered you and you're conquered and you cannot become the Conqueror you are conquered it's done holy yes you've always got to update the devil with today's news I like today's news that's great amen it's not it's not Doom scrolling through all the bad news no it's the good news and today's news is the best news Hallelujah amen so now brother Brown would say this Israel in the church now when they come across the stream got on the other side God just closed it and that was the old task Masters could you imagine how the Jews felt look back there and there was everything I mean the very thing that made and whipped them and beat their backs into stripes and pulled them over like this was dead floating in the sea brother when you come through the Red Sea of the blood of Jesus Christ every old dirty habit that's drove you to things that you wouldn't do you'll find dead in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's right floating on down the stream every spirit that drove you to drink smoke run after woman lie cheat steal watch Evil movies is dead in the blood of Jesus Christ I mean no wonder Moses god in the spirit now you talk about having some kind of new kind of religion look at this Miriam of prophetess now she was 80. 80 something years old right so she wasn't a young person getting enthused with a tambourine she was one of the old sisters in the church and she picked up a tambourine because she really because she realized her taskmasters were dead amen she she got enough joy in her I I mean because she got a revelation the one that was tormenting her has been drowned amen and she led all the sisters of Israel in worship 80 something year old woman hallelujah amen ages got no cap on this thing praise the Lord when Revelation strikes it's got no cap Hallelujah I mean she picked up a tambourine began to beat and dance went down the banks to see dancing beating this tambourine and the daughters of Israel followed her dancing singing and beating the tambourine Moses raised up his hands and got so caught away in the Holy Ghost till he sung in the spirit Hallelujah that's right that's right and that same holy ghost that was on Moses is in this building this morning Holly the same one that made Miriam dances here this morning God is God and change is not yes sir amen that's why we've got to realize the devil's defeated this is more than you know people say we're just making the people emotional no no revelation will bring a motion don't you get happy when you think Jesus died on Calvary for you when it becomes more than a story and a reality when he reveals to you I took your sins that day up calvary's mountain and you bear them no more and I went to hell in your place as a sinner that you don't need to go and arrived I Rose triumphant and because I live you live also that makes me happy that makes me real happy amen that if if this heart stops beating I know where I'm going it's not well what's gonna happen Lord I know I know my redeemer liveth that makes me happy I it should you know it should make you happy you know you know the deal yeah you know the world thinks they're happy doing their thing but you know and you know they get all all upset you know all of Germany's upset about a ball being in or out in a in a soccer game you know and the ball was technically still in but everybody's all upset about that but they're one side's rejoicing because of a technicality you know and that's the world having their fun but this is eternal this is eternal this is not some temporary game where your Gladiators your your Gods rise and fall a different group take their place you know no this is eternal I mean we're gonna be dancing on the streets of gold we're gonna see him as he is we're gonna Embrace him we're gonna we're gonna see our Lord hallelujah that makes me happy and it's not some pipe dream pie in the sky it's a reality I mean that and and and the evidence of it the Holy Ghost sweeps through the building amen touches you may be reading listening to a message praying you come and come to church and God sweep after sweep of the Holy Ghost God's telling you there's a land beyond the river amen and you've got a reservation in that land amen and soon as very soon we're going to see him we're going to be like him we're going to see him as he is and be changed Hallelujah amen so Moses no wonder he got you know he got in the spirit began to sing because you think about it he saw fulfilled prophecy he was looking at prophecy being fulfilled it was no longer a promise of the future of when when when God would speak to Abraham so Abraham your seeds going to serve you in a Strange Land 400 years but I'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand that was prophecy but when prophecy is fulfilled it creates a song and God has to write a song right so he wants to write a song through those when they see prophecy being fulfilled so you think it's always more than just the their Enemy being drowned Moses got in the spirit because he realized now what was prophecy was now happening and it was now going to be future so he was living in the Fulfillment of the scripture he was living in Bible days he wasn't standing there saying well one day it'll happen and yes well thousands of years ago this had no yeah we know about him and Abraham yeah but what about today he was living in the pages of the Bible and he knew what side he was on hallelujah amen he was he was the part of the word because you think about it see the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us right now we always say well that's the Lord Jesus and absolutely it is but you know the word didn't just put on flesh and him it put on flesh in the Believers rights are in the upper room the word put on flesh in the 120 and as the Holy Ghost spread through the ages so the word put on flesh and then so now we come back into to this last day where God said I will restore and what is that full restoration when the word puts on flesh again in you and I Hallelujah so now it's no longer prophecy it's happening amen we're living in the season of fulfilled prophecy praise the Lord Hallelujah and to me that's very exciting because we're not wandering around in the darkness just all panicking about Russia and whatever no that's just a backdrop God's focus is on you God hasn't forgotten none none of his children we may feel forgotten but God hasn't forgotten about you and I he doesn't have the idea about them no he's he's mindful of his children every moment of every day when you're sleeping is mindful of you when you're awake he's mindful whatever you're going through he is mindful of you and he has not forgotten one amen see even you know yo you think about you know God even says in the Old Testament he says can a can a can a mother forget her suckling child and he actually says yes they can now to me I don't know how that is possible because a birth is a birth you know you don't just fall asleep and wake up and there's a baby even a Caesarean is is a big ordeal what six weeks of recovery and now you've got a baby your whole life has changed you know you can't live to yourself you can look after this baby but you know God even says a mother can forget her suckling child they says but I will not forget I cannot forget my children I mean it's a powerful thing when you think about how God cannot forget us now they were they were panicking coming up to the Red Sea because they thought they had been led to a death trap but actually no God had to write a song and he wanted to write a song of Deliverance so so he made them walk a certain way come to a certain Beach come to a certain place where there's nowhere else to go but across the sea amen for for this testimony to come forth now Moses got in the spirit as I said because he saw the Fulfillment of Prophecy in his day Hallelujah now it's such a vital key we get in the spirit of the Lord the Holy Ghost before we do anything before you go through any religious act you've got to get in the spirit it's so important that we get in the spirit before we do anything as John John said in Revelations I was on the spirit in the Lord's day so he is in the spirit he has transported forward in time on the Lord's Day right but he got in the spirit before he saw anything and it's the same thing with you and I we've got to get in the spirit now how did Moses get in the spirit Moses did so so see we do like Moses did we look and believe what the Lord has already done that's how you get in the spirit he saw his enemy did he saw the soldiers that no doubt would have given evil looks or whatever when he walked into Pharaoh's Palace and walk out he saw them face down dead in the you know in the Red Sea he saw the ones were beating on his family beating on his loved ones beating on his people they were all dead amen and it made him get in the spirit Hallelujah and then so so that's how you get in the spirit of God remember what God has done for you already amen If he if he saved your soul that's an eternity of Praise right there amen if he's redeemed you by his blood that's an eternity of Praise Hallelujah and when you begin to get in the spirit amen remember faith is not a Feeling the love of God is even not a feeling it's far above human love see man Jesus when Jesus asked people if they were sick and they came to him and needs he says do you believe he did not say do you feel anything he asked do you believe see even without feeling see faith is not a Feeling faith is a I believe it it's a revelation in the heart see even if we don't feel anything you don't go by feelings if I went by feelings I wouldn't be standing here right now I wouldn't be here a lot of church services I wouldn't be here I'll be honest because I don't feel like it but here I am because faith is not a Feeling see the devil wants to drive you by your five senses or even the inward senses of your spirit but God wants to drive you by Faith by Revelation and the Soul amen and that's what the enemy he wants to make you feel a certain way to do a certain thing but God wants to reveal himself to you a certain way that you'll have victory amen amen Hallelujah see it's what we believe so I believe amen he's done incredible things for me amen well I need proof well we could have testimony sir for sure but he's done incredible things for me before I even touch my life I believe he died on Calvary for me amen Psalms 40 and 1 to the chief musician Assam of David I waited patiently for the Lord and he and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry you think about the you know we just read that and think yep and he heard My Cry David was in great distress but God had to write a song amen and and he allowed him to go through a lot of things that we would get the book of Psalms he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the Maori clay he set my feet upon the rock and established my Goings praise Lord he had put a new song in my mouth even praising to our god many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the Lord blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many O Lord my God are thy wonderful Works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us Lord they cannot be reckoned record up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered amens you just think about the wonderful Works which he has done and his thoughts to you amen basically saying there's just too many I would just run out of fingers and toes and everyone else's fingers are toes I'd run out of counting ability Hallelujah why because they're just so many of them and you begin to think about the Lord you say this is very Elementary now this is very powerful because if you really think about God has done God wants us to be happy he wants us to be rejoicing he wants to be at rest have us at peace he doesn't want us troubled and stressed and be full of anxiety anxieties of devil anxieties of the devil we don't have to put up with anxiety it's not our portion peace is our portion love is our portion Joys our portion rest in the Holy Ghost is our portion amen so we're gonna just take the word of God and say no devil anxiety is not mine depression is not mine that's your lot you go enjoy it somewhere else far away and don't tell me how it goes you just go over there get out of here amen so now Moses you talk about a Pentecostal meeting you know a Pentecostal meeting is nothing new amen we just read about the first one really uh you know upon the Earth that was thousands of years ago they got in the spirit begin to Rejoice because of Revelation because of what the enemy had been drowned and they were rejoicing and then even job was asked by God where were you when this morning star shouted for joy Hallelujah that's before there was anything in God's mind he saw job rejoicing and shouting and I think God's going to remind us where were you before there was an Adam moon or star or anything where were you with me and my thinking but now he's got to write a song so he's got to make someone material to write that song through so he thought of you he spoke because a word as a thought expressed so he thought of you and then he spoke you expressed you upon the Earth that because he wants to write a song Hallelujah I was judged today well we're all songwriters that's what I got done God wants to write a song through your life he wants to use every moment moment of your life for his glory Hallelujah hey the devil's got nothing on us the devil's got nothing on us he has no Victory he's got no claim he's got nothing you got to remember that Hallelujah see when you get in the spirit you begin to see things that's why it's so important to get in the spirit amen see Moses when he got in the spirit he began to see things see his song Turn from a rejoicing Praise of a testimony to a prophecy now let's go I said to keep uh Exodus 15 I believe yeah here we are let's just re you know I've either had to find a place to start and stop and I'm not just reading this to Phil time but you know this is awesome so you know I find hard Exodus 15 and 2 because we read um uh verse 1 8 yet when we open now so two the Lord is my strength in the song man this is the song of Moses the Lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation he is my God and I'll prepare him and habitation my father's God I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts have they cast into the sea has chosen captains also a drowned in the Red Sea The Depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone thy right hand O Lord has become glorious in power thy right hand O Lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine Excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sendeth forth thy wrath which consume them as stubble and with the blast of our nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as in Heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said I'll pursue I'll overtake I'll divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them I'll draw my sword my hand shall destroy them this is the devil's this is what he says he's going to do about you thou didst bloweth thy womb the sea covered them they sankers LED in the mighty Waters who was like under the O Lord among the gods who was like the Glorious and Holiness fearful and Praises doing wonders thou stretch forth thy right hand the the Earth swallowed them thou and thy mercy has led the people which thou has redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation now we just keep going here verse 14. now see now notice how it switches now into prophecy the people shall hear him be afraid sorrow shall take hold of the inhabitants of palestinia then the Dukes of Edom shall be amazed in the Mighty Men of Moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of Canaan shall Melt Away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over O Lord till the people pass over which thou has purchased so he's not just rejoicing about what's happened he's in the spirits who begins to see what's going to happen in the future that's why it's so important to get into the spirit you can see what God's about to do next amen where it doesn't give you a trim that gives you an expectation it gives you rejoice it gives you a you know a real peace amen a real excitement amen so so he's saying that the people's hearts are gonna melt and this is exactly what what rahab's testimony was when she hid the two spies in Jericho it should say and and Joshua two and nine you should say and and she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants of the earth faint because of you so so what Moses prophesied she was now living in hallelujah amen I was going to keep reading this for we have heard how the Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt so what the people shall hear and be afraid amen and what ye did unto the two kings the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan seahon and OG whom ye utterly destroyed and as soon as we we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and Earth beneath now notice that phrase uses twice is because of you well isn't it because of God well God was among them I remember as they were walking man because footsteps of possession so they were lame and claim on the promised land and everywhere they went the enemy the the fear of God fell upon them so they were terrified because of them Hallelujah now you think about it you roll out of bed in the morning you get all the stuff out of your eyes click your back think oh boy yo you pull a hamstring just getting out of bed yeah you think man how am I ever going to survive this day in an unseen realm there's a panic button goes off in hell I think how and and they begin to think how are we going to get through this day they're awake they're awake you know why because the courage of the devil is gone he's nothing but a bluff he has no more courage he his Hearts have melted why because of you because you are the Lord's redeemed ones and if he puts a hand against you he's got Jesus Christ on his hands amens I wouldn't you know if I was the devil I wouldn't touch any of God's children I would put no trouble upon them I put no but he just he's a creature of Heaven he can't help himself but also God allows it because God has to write a song Hallelujah and so he allows the devil to come against you because God has to write a song hallelujah praise the Lord why because he wants worship amen Hallelujah so so their hearts melted because of them amen now they would they would speak Moses would speak of well if I can just find this last here he would speak of the you know how the people had been purchased or redeemed which thou my Mercy has led the people which thou Hast redeemed thou has got them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation now if we jump forward I'm just going to jump forward way ahead it's you know it's very interesting when you when you search in the Bible you know the phrase new song or a new song it's in the Psalms it's here and it's here and um yeah it's in the Old Testament but but it's only twice in the Book of Revelation and to me this is uh quite astounding because you know a new song as a as a time when a new song is sung when God does something now this word new and you know we're going to come to Revelations 5 if we have I think we have time here because I want to go two ways but we'll just go one way maybe maybe let's just jump quickly first one way you know there is songwriters okay we'll come there I'll just touch this very quickly great songs are written in times of great hardship now as I said about John Newton different ones you know but it's amazing how the devil can put us in very hard situations but if God wants to write a song nothing can stop him writing that song now the Apostle Paul was an incredible man I was actually thanking God for him his life today as I was driving saying amen this man's incredible he did not sit in an ivory Tower when he wrote most of the New Testament he would write 52 of the New Testament I just Googled how much he wrote that's how much he wrote 14 books of the 27 books of the New Testament most of his writings were done in prison remember nothing can stop the music if God wants to write a song we're going to realize nothing can hinder if God wants to write a testimony in your life amen don't it don't let anything of the enemy or your external and you know I mean internal external hinder that Harry would be in prison he'd be Shipwrecked he'd be beaten he'd be stoned a few times he went through great trouble he had to run for his life more than once and he would he would write some of his greatest Epistles and it wasn't him writing it was God through him so he'd he'd received such powerful Revelation in the hardest of circumstances he would rock Colossians filamon Ephesians Philippians and second Timothy in prison in his play and he probably written other ones now when he wrote these things he was under house arrest by the Roman government and when he was under this house arrest he was chained to a soldier all day every day so here he was here he was a a a pagan unbelieving Soldier has chained to him and and maybe the devil thought this is going to stop him getting any kind of Revelation I'm going to stop his apostleship he ain't going to spread the gospel no more I've got him and that's how the devil tries to do you and I gets an ailment in our body we get trouble in our mind trouble in the home whatever more you know and it's all about it's all about how you look at it it's all about perspective right so so it could either hinder you or it can enable you can either drive you to God or it can drive you away from God but it's your decision how it does it amen to the Apostle Paul will be chained to a chained to a soldier no I don't think he changed his way of doing anything before or after that Soldier maybe you pray out loud shout and praise God and give him glory he was a man who was dead in religion up to his eyeballs and formalism it is learning in the Pharisee of the Pharisees but he met the god of the Bible and he set a soul of flame and it was never the same and he counted all but done that he'll win Christ that's incredible you think he was dead he thought he was serving God he thought I don't need a savior I don't need salvation I'm holy I keep all the laws the Commandments the Washings all the ordinances I'm fine but he found out he was he was actually working against the very God he was claiming to serve actively trying to destroy his work upon the Earth so there he was he met God hallelujah God wanted to write a song some of our songs are longer than the others but God will still write a song amen so so a song began to be written out of out of out of you know out of the Apostle Paul's life now you'd think so I'm just kind of maybe I feel like I'm going forward and backwards all the time but you think if God wanted to write a song Give a testimony here just here just type it out send a copy of the music how it sung and just send it to the Earth that's not how God works God puts us through great trials and tests for a song to Be Sung amidst the Apostle Paul was chained to a Roman soldier I believe he would have kept praying he would have kept doing exactly the same before and after his imprisonment so that Soldier was there he praised God see remember this Soldier you think about you're stuck to a person you don't even know who's working for a government that wants to kill you ultimately he's not your friend he's not your buddy he's not a prayer partner he's not even a believer and maybe he'll change every certain day I don't know how it worked but your chain to the sky but yet here you are the church age messenger and God wants to pour out a song through your life see God just I love testimonies of Believers you think man Lord if you can do that for the Apostle Paul he would receive the book of Ephesians when he's chained to a Roman soldier he would receive Philippians film on Colossians yeah I've got in my notes get powerful scriptures from his writings just read all those books you read about the book of Ephesians the incredible power even just in a phrase of that amen you know I don't have one on me but you know it's an incredible incredible he received all this Revelation chained to a soldier in prison and it goes to show he was still the Apostle he still was an apostle he still ministered to people he prayed he received Revelation he gave it out you know all while in this condition and he was singing his song to its fullness Hallelujah he was living exactly what God wanted him to be even in that hardship amen I think Lord if if he can do that you know we think man I yo I just can't talk to the Lord right now he can't talk to me because of XYZ in my life the Apostle Paul had a lot of XYZ it didn't stop him receiving that Revelation to give to the church amen and so so anything in life should not stop us receiving that same Revelation to our hearts and it living in our lives Hallelujah see the Apostle Paul did not wait to be free from his chain in order to continue to walk with the Lord to pray to him to receive Revelation or to do the working of apostle he just continued on Hallelujah to me that's very powerful amen you take you take Brothers like brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer nearly three years ago Hegel was given one month to live nearly three years ago he keeps preaching he keeps traveling he keeps God said if you if you trust me I'll use you like never before before that first struck him stage four cancer and he said that's not just for him but that's for everyone if you can trust me I'll use you like never before and he just continued on even with he had a lot of troubles you can hear him you know before he starts preaching somebody's got to steady himself on the pulp and he's going to fall over just dizziness all kinds of trouble sickness whatever more because of the he's on the highest dose of chemo there is he's been on that for years but he still powers on why because God has to write a song God has to write a song and to me that that gives me great courage if I can I think I think compared to that you know hey we're all good you know there's nothing wrong but you know if he can stand and you know he can continue to minister wood and be a Christian be a believer in spite of that I think that can give us great courage we can rally and do the same thing Hallelujah so God has to write a song now testimony I mean sorry prophecy has to become reality it can't just sit as prophecy it has to become manifested now as I was saying before I went down that uh Segway very quickly and we'll come back to this now the term a new song is only written twice in the New Testament both in the Book of Revelation it's in the Old Testament a few times but it's in the new uh twice and that word new is different to the one in the old whether one in the old just means a fresh song but the one in you it has many different meanings but says one that's recently made it's fresh it's recent it's unused it's it's of a new kind it's unprecedented it's novel it's uncommon it's unheard of so if we take that language back into Moses day it was unprecedented that our army had been drowned it had been unprecedented a pillow guide as a pillow fire came down to bring in Exodus it was it was unheard of for a people Millions strong have them all with their cattle and all that they were to walk through a sea that was parted on dry ground that was unheard of so the song he was singing singing was unique amen your other nations around saying well that's not our our worship band doesn't sing that song that means nothing to us I mean a lot to him it mean a lot to Israel I mean why because I was singing a new song about of what God was doing in their midst amen now we live in the Third Exodus we understand that don't we the first one was was was Egypt Israel from Egypt to the promised land the second excess was under the Lord Jesus from a from a formal cold religion into the living way of of the Holy Ghost now the Third Exodus is from being filled with the Holy Ghost here to going into heaven it's a Rapture Exodus right being transported from this world to the next world Amen to know so we're living in unprecedented times I'm sure you've heard that phrase a few times this is unprecedented at times this is all you know the buzzwords with covert and stuff sure it is unprecedented at times we're living in a resurrection hour this is unprecedented this is this has never happened before where a whole mess of people have come out of the Grave the dead in Christ have resurrected the only time this ever happened when when Jesus gave up the ghost amen you know cried out with a loud voice it says in Matthew he says that many of the Saints arose and were seen of many and went up with him in the Ascension Hallelujah so it's really unprecedented it's really unprecedented that that a people would walk with God a whole mess of people around the Earth and I would walk with God like Enoch did and walk with them and be not because God takes them amen that's a that's really an unprecedented sure for one or two see Enoch was one Elijah was one but now a whole group of people not just men but women not just men or women but children boys and girls young and old I mean before we realize our bodies will be changed will be made young or old again you know instead of William going daddy will be Daddy he'll pick me up and say I've got your attention now Hallelujah I'm expecting it the girls will be this big and young Hallelujah fully grown before we realize sweep will come over will be changed amen hallelujah are you believing for it are you believing for it because we're living in the season of it amen and this is not some enthusiasm of a man this is God's doing I think God said in the end time as you see the world as the Sodom and Gomorrah age and light just like Noah David Noah we're living in that time this is when it will happen he'll come like a thief in the night but a thief comes to get what he wants and then he leaves he I'm what he's he's gonna get come get me he's gonna come get me oh look I trust he's put in your heart when he comes to take his bride away I'm part of that number holy I can't be left behind hello I trust you do you have that kind of faith not a sure it brings a feeling command yeah does it excite you because remember the the Rapture is universal around the world by the way you know Jesus said they'll be two in the bed we'll be taking one will be left that's night time two in the field won't be taking one bit if that's daytime so around the world see we don't have to get up and say okay I'm ready I'm ready I can't go to sleep now because I'm ready and if I'm asleep well I won't be ready no you'll be ready you'll be ready if you've got the Holy Ghost you're ready that means you can be asleep you'll be having the greatest dream and then you wake up and say hallelujah it's not a dream Hallelujah sorry I get happy you know but it's gonna be it should be such an assurance in our hearts when this Holy Ghost leaves the Earth we're going with them because we're part of him part of the word amen unprecedented things now John would be John would be taken he was on the spirit of the Lord's day now who's transported in time we can see this even in chapter one where where we heard a voice like a trumpet behind him and he turned to see seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man walking among them now that's the seven Church ages so where he is in time he's already gone past the seven Church ages and he's in eternity that's where he's taken on the Lord's day today is not the day of the Lord It's the day of man that's why man has his governments has his ways that's why the world is in this condition because it's the day of man but there'll come a day where's the day of the Lord so so he's already been transported past these ages and in his in eternity and we and he hears the voice behind him so so he turns around now and God is going to show him what's been going on in these seven Church ages amen because we understand the Book of Revelations a book of Prophecy it's also a book of symbols what do you see right in a book and send to the seven churches those seven churches are not just to those churches in Asia Minor but it speaks of a condition of certain periods of time from Calvary to now we know we're living in the lady of sin Church age Rich increased with Goods have need of nothing all around the world that way I was shocked when I was in Papua New Guinea this is a few years ago and and I was in a Pentecostal Church here at a Bible study and they said look we're rich increased with Goods and this it's a developing country very poor people have generators not a lot of power you know the village Christian I went to the where the church became Believers there they had no power at that time they have to go down to the creek even now to get water when it's a drought you know very but they think they're rich to increase with Goods because relatively they are from where they were a few maybe half a century ago to where they are now they've got it all so it it applies all around the world amen so we're so so we're living in that last stage now John would be taking CeCe after after the scenes of the church ages now he sees a door up in heaven open and that same voice has come up hither so that shows now because John himself is a symbol in the book yes right one person in a vision represents a whole body of people and so John has transported up into eternity there into the throne room of God and when he comes to that scene in Revelations five we won't we won't touch Revelations 4 but it's a continuation five is a continuation of four he sees now the book and the right hand of the one on the throne and he and he weeps much because he finds that no one he looks around and finds no one is worthy to take the book and he went much there was a strong Angel crying out who's worthy to take the book and he went much because he's looking around because he realizes that book is a symbol remember that book is a symbol of you it's a symbol of this redeemed Earth everything Adam lost is actually that title D that's in the right hand of God and so he's weeping because he realized unless a man is found worthy to take that book all of the plan of redemptions and Jeopardy because remember Redemption is two parts it's a purchase than a claim right Jesus purchased our Salvation on Calvary but then he has to come claim what he bought right because remember his blood poured upon the Earth so he purchased the Earth but the devil still runs this world right so so his blood purchased the Earth but also purchase you and I amen so now so now the Lord that's why when the new Heavens a new new Earth come into being there's a holy fire that burns the whole world off and burns all the Devils off it takes all the Devils away all the trouble all the strife and sorrow and pain why because the Lord isn't going to live in a haunted house just like you and I God doesn't live in a haunted house you know of a Believer that's full of unbelief and sin no God lives in a purified vessel right so so God's not going to come back to the Earth and it's going to be a haunted place and the shingles have fallen off the roof graffiti is everywhere it's just a like a squatter Camp no he's going to chase all the squatters away and by that I mean he's going to chase all the devil where he's going to throw them in a lake of fire praise God I'm going to be happy they're not there aren't you amen I look forward to that day when when the devil's absent and I'm not going to go looking for him praise the Lord we'll see him throw him to like a fire with your shout hallelujah and then we'll just move on praise God Amen so but he's weeping much now because he sees it no man is found worthy sure the angels will work would have been worthy but but it had to be a man had to be a kinsman redeemer who had come and purchased that book had to be one of Adam's race and that's why the Lord Jesus he didn't come as an angel to purchase our Salvation you can turn me down a bit something's gone a bit funny up here maybe my ears just unblocked I don't know but you know um you know he didn't come as an angel had to become as a man that's why he was created in the womb of Mary he became our kinsman redeemer praise God and then now and then so now now he's weeping much but then one of the one of the elders said weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed Amen to to to to take the book and lose the seals thereof so now he couldn't see where the Lord is remember John is the Beloved disciple he loud in his bosom he was loved by the Lord he was with them everything he did but now he's looking he he couldn't see him there remember now this scene in Revelations 5 is all the redeemed of the ages of it symbolized in this thing so you and I are symbolized in the scene amen praise the Lord and then so he can't but then the Lord comes forth out of eternities because he's been the mediator upon the upon the throne and he still have mediator today but he steps forth now he's going to do something unprecedented it's unheard of it hasn't been you see the song has not been used yet because God has songs but in Seasons they come out that's why you see revivals down Through the Ages the hymnology changes because God is restoring different parts of his word praise God and then so now here he comes he steps forth and brothers the most Sublime act in scripture is the Lamb taking the book because here is a man without sin faultless perfect we're stood every test every trial he was tempted on All Points like we are but yet without sin he was he was tempted sexually with popularity everything kept it kept it on every hand but yet he did not follow that tint he stood the test Hallelujah and then when he came to Gethsemane he says not my will but thy will be done he surrendered his own own flesh to the to the word he had to fulfill and he went up there Victorious conquered hell death in the grave amen here he was Amen brother Brown says if we just lay aside our sinful thoughts long enough he'll Advance all the way to glory to you to you and I then so he takes the book and he loses the seals praise the Lord and it says in Revelations 5 and 7 and when he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden valves full of odors which are the prayers of saints and now comes the unprecedented season where all the prayers of the ages can now be released before God some some prayers could only be answered now like the Believers you know all the way through the ages Lord when is the rapture going to happen I want to see the resurrection Lord I want to be upon the Earth with you and they would pray that but it wasn't the season for that prayer to be answered right are we okay there amen and they sung a new song this is an unprecedented song this has been an unheard of song praise the Lord they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals they're off for thou was slaying and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation see you're you're in that verse you're on that verse can you see yourself in the Bible people say I can't see myself in the Bible you're there that's you because every every Kindred Nation tongue and people praise the Lord so there we are amen so now remember it has to go from a book of Prophecy to a reality amen so now when John sorry sorry we're just gonna we're just gonna go to um where are we verse 5 and 10 where's five oh yeah and it's made us Kings and Priests so so now notice this they are like Moses they're praising God for what he's done but their worship begins becomes a prophecy speaking of future events right because why when you get in the spirit you begin to see things I mean so they saw him take the book now now this this has happened in this day right by the revelation of it has to come and strike our hearts that the Lord is in the process now of winding up his Plan of Redemption that's why it's called you by his word to himself why because he's got to call his bride before he can make the new Heavens A New Earth and different things right praise the Lord amen so he says now and so thou has made us Kings and Priests this is verse 10. so just like Moses the new song declares What the Lord Has Done but also prophesies of where the redeemed are going and we shall reign upon the Earth amen amen so so what's that looking forward to when are we going to rain well there's two parts of it send the millennium we are going to see this look forward to the Millennium so when the seals come off the book there's a revelation strikes the Earth we know where we're going see we shall reign upon the Earth so in other words we're going to go through a Rapture cycle we're going to be taking up to the wedding supper then we're going to come back to the Earth and reign in the Millennium with the Lord praise the Lord so this is what happens when the when when prophecy becomes reality Hallelujah you know where you're going it's not well how am I going to be part of it well those redeemed us back to God by thy blood and this is where we're going to go praise the Lord hallelujah amen now I believe we also have dominion now we have been given dominion over the flesh I mean over sin and over the devil amen we have dominion over self amen with us own flesh man can be subjected to the word of God I believe with all my heart Hallelujah and then now John CC John begins to get excited too he says now and and and and I behold and heard the voice of many angels round about The Throne of beasts and the elders a number of them were Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands of thousands sang with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and glory and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such are under the sea and all in them heard I saying so now John is not just watching he's part of the great event so heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever so John got a little bit excited when Revelation Struck it made a worship work has gone God wanted to write a song he has to write a song remember John is one one man as a symbol represents a whole body of people so when you when it's revealed to you see you can hear Brother Brown preaching about the lamb taking the book He's opened the seals it can just be in here right but when it goes from symbols to the lamb stepping forth finishing his work of redemption see when I first heard the seals I saw horse riders I saw tribulation I saw the 144 000 but then when I heard it again I just saw him step forth take the book and Redeem Me Hallelujah becomes a personal thing it's more than just symbols in a book it becomes reality praise the Lord amen said John everything and under the Earth Hallelujah in the sea every creature in heaven on the earth under the Earth and in the sea heard him his CCC his song began to cry out why because there's a revelation to him amen I see John got happy enough Hallelujah old John have been standing there crying so he went from crying to praising why and what changes cry to a praise is the Lord the lamb himself amen that's the same thing same thing with you and I we can have a cry but it'll turn into a praise when he comes upon the scene it goes from a cry to a praise Amen to remember you may be crying but it'll turn to a praise amen your current state of how you feel is not how you'll end up I mean when the lamb intersects that problem it'll turn into a praise holy just like Moses the you know God asked him why are you crying unto me speak and go forward so it went from a cry to a praise Hallelujah and old John have been staying there our brother crying why everything in heaven everything in Earth everything in the sea heard it heard me holler amen amen blessings and honor and might and power be to him that liveth forever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's John hi Leah so when the seals come open you look past the curtain of time and see yourself already in glory glorified Hallelujah talk about a happy time I may talk about a happy time when that Revelation came of our lamb the Redeemer our Kinsmen had come back from the Throne of mitatory and walked out there to take his possession Hallelujah amen see that's immensely powerful to me why because God wants an unprecedented unheard-off song in this hour that's why we can sing worthy as the lamb that will slain why because we've seen him step forth in this day that's why brother bam when he's preaching the bridge he says he says let that strong Angel cried out who's worthy to take the book he says maybe I'm just feeling this way but let him come and open the word it's an event that's unfolded in this hour amen and we can look into the word and we can see our part in the book Hallelujah talk about her getting in the spirit amen we can look into the book and say it's not a book of symbols it's a reality we see our position in the book and our position the book takes us amen from seeing the Lamb step forth all the way into a new heavens and new earth and we don't get cars into a lake of fire no we continue on when the devil is no more we still shall be that's why we can Rejoice amen this comes a time of an End Amen where the devil has been defeated Hallelujah just like Moses Moses in Israel they could realize it's an end of Egypt right there in the Red Sea and we can rejoice as the end of the devil beating us down I mean causing trouble in our lives why because we've gone through the blood of Jesus Christ if you truly go through his blood the enemy is dead and all he can be haunted by is a memory but you've got to take the devil back there and say devil the last time I saw you the last time this thought was in my mind that was troubling me I saw it face down and the blood of Jesus Christ and there it remained so you get back to where you belong faced out in the blood of Jesus Christ drowned Hallelujah I mean talk about a happy time maybe we could get in the spirit you think about what God has done and he'll show you things to come Hallelujah for you and I amen let's stand this morning shall we Worthy is a lamb that was slain Hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah our god tremendous amen amen let's sing that song Hey when he opened his word grab the musicians please this morning praise the Lord what a happy time so I'm feeling down but you don't have to stay down all right man just turn your eyes heavenward turn your eyes to what he has already done for you say I'm not worthy of any of these things it doesn't matter about you and you're worthless how you feel about yourself it's what he has done that matters amen so take your eyes off yourself and look to your lamb Hallelujah praise God Amen when he opened his word the heavens heard me cry amen [Music] the word is open sin is broken you have won the victory the word is open sin is
