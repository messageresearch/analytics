Well, finally, I'm here. Was it like three times that I had to skip? But I'm here. Um I had um sermon that I prepare. But last night I I was just praying and it was like I have this ready. I can just go to sleep and just I have the message. But the Lord was like no. I I just couldn't settle. So I just had to change it. So it's going to be a little bit like me. Just mixed up just so Oh, I put it in Spanish. First Timothy 1 chapter 1:3 says, this is Paul, but this can be you too. who was before a blasphemer and me too and a persecutor and injurious. But I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. Verse 14 says, "And the grace of our Lord was exceeding exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." 17 Now unto the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have your seat. Let's let's talk a little bit of Jesus Christ, the King of Kings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We accept Jesus as our King. So, he can have full dominion of our lives. So, we just give everything to him. He rules our life. He's in control. Amen. &gt;&gt; And which ones are this? Kings. Revelations one says, "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the death, and the prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that love us, and washes from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests, unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. I'm just surrounded by royalty tonight. &gt;&gt; You are all kings, queens, beautiful people. Amen. &gt;&gt; But to be a king, we have to conduct ourselves as royalty. &gt;&gt; We have here the pyramid with the seven um the statue of the of a perfect man. Now I'm I'm going to do this uh parallelism between what God thinks about a king and what the world can offer you as a king. &gt;&gt; So we have virtue, faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love. That's what God thinks about the way that we should be. Amen. That's what we aiming for. Amen. I was thinking about just temperance, just being able to control your character in when the things get hot, you have to control yourself. That only can be done with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; As I work um as a trady, me and David, we have a joke about builders cuz some builders, they can lose the plots quite easily. just just the it's so much pressure that they always seems to be angry and just swearing. It's just they are just running big projects. It's just take from the Lord like we just do to the floor. So we that's what we do but they are doing so much stuff. So that always like doing something. So here we have a king Christian the 7th. He was a king in Denmark in Norway and a duke from one place that I wouldn't even pronounce. So this guy had the annoying habit of throwing food at his dinner guest. He also um used to be put some um what's that? Oh, he used to also like slap people in the face just because he used to put some pins into his um under the chair of her uh grandmother. And also he when he was introduced to people and when they bowed to him, you know, when you see a king, you're supposed to bow, he used to do like a lip frog over them as a way to amuse himself. So that's what he used to do when you used to bow him. He used to just jump you over. He had some mental issues. &gt;&gt; But he was a king. &gt;&gt; He was a king. But they they did like a coupe. They took him over. He was still the king, but he was not ruling cuz he man how there was another uh some more cases. I didn't just want to put them there. But yeah, that guy was a king from Denmark. And yeah, our Lord Jesus Christ is also a king. &gt;&gt; Full of virtue. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The the important thing about a king is that he has to have dominion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz how a king can be a king without a territory. He needs dominion. And that's where your heart comes. Yeah. You have to let Jesus rule your heart. You especially you. Jesus Christ is our king and we accept him. And that's a way that we can say that we want him to clean us from our sin. How many of you have you give your heart to Jesus? &gt;&gt; I hope that everyone. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the most beautiful thing that we can do. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says that if you don't serve Jesus, &gt;&gt; you are serving something else. &gt;&gt; You can't have two masters. There's only one that you can serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. But as Christians, sometimes you and even myself, I'm preaching to to me. This is for me. This is for brother Jimmy. You can be a Christian. You can come to church and still being do silly stuff. Amen. That's why the Bible talk to us about the new birth. You must to be born again. Otherwise, you cannot make it. You have to be born again. And if you have been at the hospital when a baby is getting born, man, what an experience. E there's blood, there's crying, there's you are worried, you don't know what's going to happen. I remember when Bella was born, no one told me that the babies hit. Sometimes I go in a funny way. hit was like an ig. And I was so worried. I was like, "Man, my poor daughter." Like, and I remember the the doctor, she was like, she was, "Oh, she's so beautiful." And I was like, "What?" I told somebody, "When are we going to talk about the elephant in the room?" Like, but now she's her head is all good. No one told me. I was just worried about my daughter. Amen. So when as you are growing you can see like you have to experience some stuff. You have to try to walk by yourself. You have to learn how to talk again. Things that you have you can do and you cannot do. &gt;&gt; If back in the world you used to grab a pen and scratch the walls and do drawing like Bella is doing now probably you are not supposed to do it. You know like just as a type here when you are um how you call it when when you are um you must to be born again when you are growing up. Amen. There's some things that you cannot do. That's why our character has to be changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Lord Jesus Christ is He make him sure. He does the job for us. &gt;&gt; We can just rest in him. &gt;&gt; We have um here David, which I call just royal holidays. This is when a king just decide to have holidays. He didn't go to the war. He just stay home. And one day he saw this girl, but she had a husband. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So we all know what happened. They had a son. The poor son died. Because for everything what you do, there are consequences. &gt;&gt; And this is for the young ones. And the world the only thing that wants you to do it's to get dirty and filthy. So then the devil has that leverage &gt;&gt; and it's tell you like how can you go back to church if you just did this thing and start just pulling you &gt;&gt; pulling you and as you keep doing more more bad stuff that leverage is more strong that's how that's what happened to me back in the world I mean like when when I was a young one I start doing silly stuff and the more silly stuff that you do is the more conscious that comes to you and you are like man I'm bad I'm bed and bed and the devil start to talk to you and telling you you should stop going to church. There's no way back for you. But I'm here tonight to tell you there's a way back. You can always turn around from your sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Was listening today the message um message of grace. &gt;&gt; Oh man, what a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because when David sinned in that way, God's grace for him was sending him a prophet &gt;&gt; and telling him that story about the ship. &gt;&gt; And when King David was like so fast and just said, "Yes, that man shall die." That prophet said to him, "That man is you." Yeah, &gt;&gt; but God's grace was with David. Not because David was something else. It's just because he showed mercy to whom he wants to show mercy. &gt;&gt; So David was in that state &gt;&gt; filthy and he thought that he was going to get away with it. He got married with Bashiba. He thought that everything was undercover. like everything is covered. I got married. The baby died. I can rest now. But God is never going to let you in that state. &gt;&gt; That sin has to come out cuz he has to clean you. He can't lose you. That's the thing. &gt;&gt; You are part of him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He can't lose you. He cannot do it because you are part of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The &gt;&gt; Bible said John 10 said, "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them give them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand. I and my father are one." So, I'm here tonight just to let you know that doesn't matter what you have done. There's a way back. You can always turn around. Doesn't matter what you have done. You can turn your heart to Christ. He's waiting for you. Amen. He's waiting for you. And I'm going to use this um opportunity that my wife is not here. She's in Tanga with the kids to talk a little bit what happened when I was when I was young. I felt from the Lord to do it. So I'm just going to do it. I was a young one probably when I was like 15 16. I had this girlfriend and you know when you have a girlfriend for a long time then you start doing really bad stuff that the Bible said that you should die. So the devil just had that leverage on me and I felt that I I that was it. You know the Bible said that you know who whoever does fornication just put to death. That's what I felt like man I'm a failure. I cannot turn back now. This this is it. Stop going to church getting back in the world drinking drugs and the thing just start like a snowball. You do something and then just get bigger and bigger and bigger and then you are like that ship completely filthy. And that's how the devil want to see you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Filthy. Thought to commit suicide. But man, there was grace. &gt;&gt; There was grace, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grace. I always thought in when I was a little kid that God had a favorite in the Bible and that was David. Cuz David, you know, David, he used to do bad stuff, repent, go back, do bad stuff, repent and the Lord was always there for him. And just today I was thinking and I was like, and what about you? What about me? Like I have done so much stuff and the Lord always has been there for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you have done anything that's really really bad, don't think that is the end. &gt;&gt; You can always turn around. &gt;&gt; There's hope. If you are alive tonight, &gt;&gt; you can fix anything. &gt;&gt; There's hope. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is hope and there is grace. So it's a prayer meeting. So even if I would want to be long, I can't. You know me. I have a quote here and I thought it was very beautiful. It says God's grace is like this. Let me tell you a story in ending. God's grace is like this. One time there was a mighty king and this mighty king had a son and it was his only son. And one day a murder killed that boy. And through that kingdom went the delegate hunting for that murder. They finally found that murder and when they found him they brought him him and imprisoned him and when they did when they did a trial was set a sentence was made or it was a terrible thing. He had murdered the king's son and he knew knew that was coming to him. They put him into the inner cells. They locked the doors. They put pet on it so no one the gods around it cuz we know what kind of a horrible punishment that boy was going to receive because he killed the king's son the royal king's son sons guts was placed all around the door he was put in inner cells stripped with nothing but a loin cloth on and there was he was s there in a in that condition starving wouldn't give him nothing to eat He was sitting in that condition. Then they brought him out to a trial. He was found guilty and proven guilty. A sentence was me. Yeah. To be executed under horrible capital punishment. He was to be killed by inches until his mortal life was gone. Sentenced by the judge. He was to and he was to die. And he begged and he cried and he said through I am guilty though I am guilty I'm sorry that I did that I wish I had never done it I'm sorry that I did it in a moment in a rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to do it in that way one day the king went down to the place to visit the the boy to tell him talk to him and tell him about the killing of his son the only son he had he had killed that boy he said I'm going down to talk to him And when he went down there, he looked back in that cage like a cage animal. He saw his little skinny body laying back there in a corner crying. His face all sunk in. His jaw sank back. His eyes way back. Matter was all in his eye and his mouth was all wide over. No water. Thirsty laying back. There was his face crying. The king said, "Stand up." He come to him and he looked at him. looked at him and said, "Why did you kill my son? Why did my what did my son to do to you?" Sorry, just English is not my first language as you can see. What did he do to merit such a death as you kill him, stabbing him and death with a spear? He said, "Nothing, my lord. Not one thing was just my own impendance, just my own ways. I kill him because I was jealous of him and I got in a temper fit and I kill him. Said now I am to I'm to die under your justice here. I realize that I deserve to do it. Only thing I'm crying for that I'm just sorry that I killed that royal man like that without a cause. The king turned on his heels and walked out, went out of the desk and said, "Destroy the records." You know, put him into the sea of forgiveness. Destroy all the records. Wash him up, clean him up, and send him down a robe for him. After a while, the great big limousine drove up to the door. When it did, a carpet was spread out of the prison cell. The king stood to the end at the end of the limousine and said come my son and ride home with me to the place put the king's robes around his shoulder he said from henceforth you are my son because he had pity that's grace that was me that was you killed the son of god with our sins we were alien dirty filthy laying in cells of our will God washed us by the blood of his own son and cleanse us. Put on a robe of the Holy Ghost. And now the great chariot of God will back up to the door someday and we'll go home to live with him. All records are destroyed. We can be judged no more. Bend them. Burn them up. He put them in the sea of forgiveness and remembrance about it no more. No wonder we can sing amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All the records have been destroyed. If you laid your sin, &gt;&gt; if you pray and if you pray for forgiveness, that sin that is there, it get destroyed and then you can worship God again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just have the musicians. There's no reason to keep living in that condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no reason to have a hidden sin &gt;&gt; because man, &gt;&gt; his nature, &gt;&gt; he's going to clean you. &gt;&gt; He has to. He promised and he's going to do it. Amen. You can't stay in that condition. Even if you try to hide it like David, &gt;&gt; he thought that everything was sweet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But man, God, he made him ensure that his son was clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing Amazing Grace and then we can call Ben our pastor. [Music] Let's start with my chain. um you said Josh are gone [Music] set free my savior has risen me [Music] rain on me. [Music] Amazing. Amazing gra.

Your call brings him on the scene. One last things, brother Jimmy said is you don't have to stay with unconfessed sin. You don't have to stay that way. Thank you so much, brother Jimmy. Appreciate it very much. Amen. Amen. You don't have to stay that way. Praise the Lord. You can have your seats tonight.
