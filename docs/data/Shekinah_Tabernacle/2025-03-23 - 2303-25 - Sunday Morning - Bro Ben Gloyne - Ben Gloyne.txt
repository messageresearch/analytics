welcome and we have uh a Mr and Mrs sster somewhere praise the Lord amen praise God it's a great to have you all amen trust you all feel relaxed all is well amen good praise the Lord let's go to Joshua um we're going to go Joshua chapter 3 this morning and we're going to read from here thank you brother Paul taking the service on Wednesday appreciate that Joshua 3 and soor we up here Joshua 3 and 9 and uh to to verse 11 then we're going to go to Mark 16 and Joshua said unto the children of Israel oh it's great to have Kiri here too God bless you Kiri God bless you bro welcome good to have you man amen praise the Lord good to see you bro good to see you amen uh Joshua 3 and9 and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God and Joshua said hereby you shall know that the Living God is among you that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites the hivites the pites the gites the amorites and the jebusites behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passeth over before you into Jordan praise God and we just go to Mark 16 and from verse 14 down and it um reads like this here says and afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen if you want to be remembered am we don't do it as a tradition but you want to remember just raise up your hand slip your hand up say Lord Remember Me this moment gracious father as we bow our heads Lord in your great divine presence Lord we're so thankful that we can call Upon Your Great Name because of your shed blood Lord God you broke down that middle wall of partition between us and you Lord that we can have fellowship with you Lord walk with you talk with you we so appreciate that Lord we love you through all our our hearts today Father we ask that your blood would cover us all this day Lord may you anoint speaker and hearer Lord may you be glorified in our midst father glorified in our lives father and you see the hands that have been raised the needs behind those hands Lord I pray you'd meet them for your great Lord glory and may you bless those who couldn't be here as well Lord those who are streaming be with them Father this day in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak about the True Church of the Living God this morning now I just want to get off the bat right away that the True Church of the Living God is made up of individuals it's not by going to a church building that you're saved it's that you know Christ you're under his shed blood His Holy Ghost is in you that's the True Church of the Living God Amen but I just want to come back here to this thought where where Joshua said that this is how you shall know that the Living God is among you now make this personal okay make the service personal don't make it as a collective amen because we're not here as a collective because when all is said and done it's it'll be you standing before the Lord right so take this as an individual thing right so this is how you shall know that the Living God is among you that he will without fail drive out every enemy in the land amen every enemy in your life will be cast out will be defeated this is how you shall know that the Lord is among you that you will go from Victory to victory that ultimately you will win the war okay this is this is how we know that God is with us because if we look back at our lives we can see what we were a year ago we're not now because God has taken us from Glory to glory amen sure we're been through trials and battles Joshua and the and the children of Israel went through some hard trials and hard battles but God was with them and they drove out the enemy without fail they won now we know and we um that that they had defeats along the way right so we take for example where where aen had where uh when they were getting all the spoils out of Jericho that he saw that golden wedge that um Babylonian garment and before they went in they were commanded not take anything for themselves but bring it to the Tabernacle of the Lord and so when they but but he did this in secret out of his own selfishness and what happened is when they went to fight AI they lost they lost I think 36 men and Joshua Joshua called a halt of the whole campaign because he knew something's wrong here they weren't meant to lose a man because God said without fail you're going to win every battle so they lost the battle so they said hey something's wrong right so they cast lots we know ultimately it came down to aen and Ain confessed and and and so so this was it seemed to be a defeat but you got to realize that I say that demon of AI sat there until Israel came and destroyed it right so the enemy you may you may lose a battle but you're going to win the war I mean just because you lose a battle doesn't mean the whole campaign's a failure it doesn't mean your Christian walks out of failure no God wants to teach you something in that failure but you've got to look for him to teach you in that moment right so it's like you know we've got to always realize that we've been predestinated to win amen we are Overcomers we are are not defeated we are victorious in Jesus Christ amen so here we are standing in this moment and but I'm so thankful that you know sure we're going to talk about casting out devils and all these things today and having having dominion over Satan but we got to realize that as Jesus would say to his disciples when they came back after um going on a healing campaign and they were rejoicing saying that even the devils are subject to us he said don't rejoice in those things but Rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen so there's a greater thing really Among Us it's not the fact that God lives and miracles are done those things are wonderful it's a proof that God's among us but it's not the proof I mean the proof is that God has lined us up with his word made us new creatures in him and the fact that he's done that because we can recognize our name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and this is why this message has come for to reveal the names in the book amen and that's why it's changed your life is because God gave you the Revelation your name was written before the foundation of the world by the blood of the lamb and nothing the devil can do can rub your name off his book amen so you can stand Victorious though you may feel defeated you're not defeated you will win the day amen so you got to realize that friends that this word has opened up and shown us into eternity that we came from God went back to God you didn't come here haphazardly you're not a Christian haply no God ordained you before the foundation of the world Amen you may have been raised in church but there was a day when the light went on and when the fire of God fell upon your life amen hallelujah and that's where we're going to realize that you were not an accident you were purposed here amen your purpose here is to overcome as brother Isaac preached about vengeance that there is a day now where every enemy will be under the feet of the children of God Amen we're not just waiting for victory in the Millennium it's now God wants to prove his blood now amen he wants to prove Calvary works now in face of every opposition every enemy God wants to prove his word today amen that when we walk out of here and we go up into Glory we're carrying spoils we're carrying testimonies of what God has done in our lives amen we're carrying trophies amen we're carrying victories amen and we when we get up there that day we'll lay lay them at his feet say Lord you actually won the victory but you Lord by your grace allowed me to stand there and watch you defeat my enemies Hallelujah CU you put something in my heart that I'm not willing that an enemy lives in my life I want them all gone I want them dead I want them defeated hallelujah hallelujah you put that in my life you put he put a grit in you that you didn't even realize you had hallelujah hallelujah friends we're living in a different season am mean we're not living in a season of just churchianity and Christianity no we're living in a season where God's word is put on flesh amen he's determined that he's going to have a people that that that people don't need to read this they read you and when they see you they see this amen every facet of your life they see this manifested I mean what the Apostle Paul described as a housewife as a husband as a child as a brother as a minister you're living it and it's not you living it it's he you allowed him to live amen maybe we just ditch this now but we're living in the season friends you got to realize oh had maybe had some bitter failures don't wallow in your failure don't wallow in the defeat and the all and the what could be of Life get up get up and keep walking get up and keep marching amen cuz it says in Proverbs here lay not wait a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place for a just man falleth seven times and Rises up again Hallelujah so just personal you you're the Devil May literally get your face in the mud and trot on you a while but you're not staying there amen you may feel convicted condemned lost whatever but you're not staying there cuz there's something in the believer that wants to get back into the presence of God Amen Peter felt absolutely defeated amen because remember he stood there and told the Lord Lord I'll not deny you remember we preached last last Sunday about being offended and the Lord said you're going to be offended because of because of me this night Peter looked at him and said I ain't I'm the special case Lord your word doesn't apply to me friends never get to the place where you think that you're the exception to the rule there are no sub Clauses in this word there are no sub Clauses in this word that that make you a special case no if you're in a walk with God you stay with his word the devil wants you to think that you're a special case and it doesn't apply to you I'm sorry the word applies to everyone that terms and conditions that change these things so but Peter thought he was a special case because he had the grit he was a Burly fisherman and he was rugged and he could do it and the Lord said no no before the crows you're going to deny me three times he did agree with the Lord he didn't say Lord spare me from this humiliation and this defeat no he disagreed with the word because of his own Pride because of who he was he was in the Inner Circle man he was one of the top three disciples he had the keys to the kingdom all these things and he thought he was something I tell you friends if God lifts his finger just a little bit off our lives we're done we need him to keep us in the palm of his hand remember we're engraved in his hands but we don't we never want to get to a point we say now I can do it I can walk this walk I've matured and I'm all these things we must never get to that place I mean I believe the more mature we get the more we realize we need him I mean the more we depend upon him to me that's a that's a great side of maturity Lord I need you more more than yesterday more than words can say Lord I need you more and then so Peter went through his great trial where he's warming himself by the fire as Jesus is on trial when Jesus needed him and and then a woman comes along down the days of Israel a witness of a woman was the lowest thing that stood in court and so here comes a woman aren't you one of them aren't you one of them and and he he denies no and then another one comes along and then the third one says but even your speech betrays that you're a Galilean he had that Galilean accent that twang or whatever was going on right and so but but then he even cursed denying the Lord the last time just to you know make a effect I don't even know this guy whatever he said at that moment he heard the Crow he knew he failed miserably his good intentions made him defeated we can't go by Good Intentions friends we got to go by the word of God you see and then so there he is defeated he's failed but then when the Lord rose he says go tell my disciples and Peter see there was something in Peter though he has fallen I'm going to get I'm going to rise but he didn't know if he would be received in the rising but you see at the rising of the sun when they're fishing and of course you know that was Peter's idea I go fishing the other said well we'll go with you failed miserably at their old profession and then one of them you know you they see a figure on the seashore have you caught any fish oh my you don't tell you you don't ask a frustrated fisherman if he's got anything that's right but then of course he says no and then John John with a eal vision going to look beyond what Peter can see says it's the Lord amen and I I probably missed out some details of the story but the M but the thing is when Peter realized it was the Lord he put on his fish's coat he jumped in the water and he started swimming he didn't wait for the boat and all these things he just said I've got to get into his presence I've got to I've got to get back to where I was that's right and he didn't know if he'd be received or not but there's something within the believer Lord you'll you'll take me back somehow Hall and you know the rest of the story he was restored in all these things but you see though though we fall we will not be cast down so don't wallow and defeat rise because even it would say in Hosea now now achen was achen was stoned in the valley of aor and so saying Hosea therefore behold I will Allure her and bring her into the Wilderness and speak comfortably unto her and I'll give her her Vineyards from th and the valley of aor for a door of hope so in this place where where where this sin was dwelt with this this this failure was was remedied it became a doorway into expectation that's the Bible word hope is an expectation and she shall sing there in the days of her youth in the days when she came out of the land of Egypt and it shall be at that day sayeth the Lord that thou shalt call me ishy and shall not call me no more B so isi is married I believe it is for I will take away the names of balam out of her mouth and they shall be no more um sorry and they shall no more be remembered by their name there's a Door of Hope and failure God wants to give you a Door of Hope because he doesn't want you he doesn't want you on the ground he wants you to rise so you may lose a battle you ain't going to lose the war right that's why I just want to get that out there right now we ain't going to lose the war you lost the battle you know I know I've said it before but Winston Churchill where where Nazis had basically Rampage through Europe they were they were the only reason that England was still standing was because of the channel but he said look we're going to look and church WIll knew they didn't have the equipment or even the manpower to to withstand a Nazi attack but did but did he show that he said no we'll fight them on the beaches we'll fight them in the HED RS I mean we'll fight them on the landing Landing zones we shall Never Surrender I because he had a grit we ain't quitting just because we our our backs are against the wall and things look dark we ain't quitting in these kind of circumstances and friends I you know if a man who's not even saved who's fighting a natural War can stand there and rally his Nation am mean though he knows the facts are he's in trouble amen but the truth he believes they can win ultimately I mean even though he says though though help help can come from across the oceans though it does not we will still stand so now now if he can stand there like that what about the Bride of Jesus Christ amen that we're not fighting a natural War we're fighting a spiritual war and Churchill did not know if they' ultimately win the war but we've read the back of the book am mean we've seen that we win in the end that the war has been won amen so so if he can stand there with that grit how much more you and I so the true church of living God doesn't quit it never it never it never calls peace terms with the devil we ain't peacekeepers here we're conquerors I mean we don't put up with him he's not welcome his little foot his little toe in our land is not welcome he's not welcome anywhere he has no part in you and you have no part in him amen so his works if you have that Revelation you realize any even even the thought of his work should abore you completely should frighten you should say no I want nothing he's got no pardon me so I've got no pardon him Amen brother R says let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus that means he doesn't change okay thus Satan knows ass surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all us is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen so Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts you got to realize now that if the Bible will still be written today if you're part of that true church that your acts would be written in the book of Acts it would be it would be the biggest volume that's in the Bible would you know this whole this whole room could not contain the book of Acts because for 2,000 years God has been writing a book of Acts amen and it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles amen so the true church is the the book of Acts being written continuing on Amen so you to realize when Jesus said if the you know he said that I am the vine you are the branches right so now if the first church put forth a branch where the power of God was on display the word had preeminence people sold out completely they were born again amen their old nature was dead God lived in power amen his word was manifested the signs were following amen they love the Lord more than anything even more than their own lives then would not the second Branch produce the same fruit would not the third branch produce the same fruit would not every branch that vine puts out would it not produce that same kind of Life of love and joy and peace amen goodness Faith being longsuffering would it not produce the one fruit of the spirit which is all those things amen but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukew formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast to the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater work she'll be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be defly thoughted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen just like Joshua was told without fail you're going to take every gate of every city you're going to take the Gate of AI you're going to take the Gate of Jericho you're going to take the Gate of uh gibian or wherever they are fighting you're going to take every single gate doesn't matter how big those gates are you're going to prevail against them amen because the True Church of the Living God is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is when when Jesus asked his disciples in Matthew 16 who do men say that I am they thought that he was some Prophet that would that had resurrected cuz they saw the part of God that was manifested in those prophets the fullness of God was in Jesus Christ right so they could see the characteristics of Jeremiah John the Baptist or one of the prophets but Jesus asked the question but who do you say that I am that's such an important question friends that that question comes to every one of us but who do you say the word is amen is it a nice book of Ethics even the message I yeah I include that in there is it a nice nice way to live nice way to raise your family whole bunch of incredible testimonies of God living a prophetic Ministry or is it to you Jesus Christ revealed amen because he asked who do you say that I who do you say that I am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said now notice the the the the whole framework of this um conversation is built around Revelation Jesus asked what's been revealed to the people well you're a prophet now what's been revealed to you who do you say that I am and Peter says you are the Christ son of the Living God and then of course Jesus says blessed are you Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven so it's Revelation now Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so if your life is built upon a church culture you ain't going to prevail against the gates of hell if it's if it's built upon tradition if it's built upon intellectual understanding you will not Prevail against the gates of hell but if your life is built upon the revelation of the word where Jesus Christ he his word becomes quickened into your heart and it changes your life there's no gate that can withstand you I it doesn't matter how big it is doesn't matter how big the reasoning is or the circumstances may be that's all Gates amen because remember reasoning well I'm sick I can't reasoning comes in well you can't get well or the medicine is not working that's a gate but the word says by his stripes we're healed right so now his word should Prevail against the symptoms against the reasoning amen you say well my family's falling apart reasoning says they can't get back but the word says amen that I will put my word and thy thy seed seed henceforth Forever This is my Covenant with them that's in Isaiah amen isn't that right that's what the promise is so don't let any gate try and stop you no we're going to storm them all God made you as a battering ram Hallelujah God made you as a battering ram doesn't matter what the devil puts in front of you it's going down your past that's going down complexes it's going down hurt it's going down situations going down what your five censes declare to you it's going down I'm going through because I know there's a promise over there and it's mine amen Jesus died that I'd receive it so where is it I want it now you want to see a kid who's very persistent tell them you're going to give them something that they like that's the faith of his little child and they'll keep going and they'll keep badgering and they'll keep asking and they'll keep seeking until they get it and we get annoyed at that but God's trying to show you through that child this is how you need to be don't quit do you think they quit everyone who's got everyone who's got children understand this right they don't quit man they're they're like wow you know if only I had that tenacity you do in the spiritual sense you should right God said it's mine all things are mine I possess all things the power of God Is Mine the reality of his word is mine the holy ghost moving in my life is mine am mean every promise is mine because he purchased it for me that day on Calvary it's all mine I want it I want to see it live amen L you say you don't have the faith well Lord increase my faith amen don't don't increase my feelings increase my faith Lord because the promise is mine Hallelujah amen our God is an inexhaustible Fountain of faith and Revelation but you see if we turn off to a stagnated stream we ain't going to overcome a stream of reasoning circumstance trouble what people say no go back to what the word says amen amen now if you're part of the true church of living God you are not your nationality I no longer glory to God I no longer have a new and spirit Hallelujah I ain't a kiwi no more I was born one I ain't one no more do you love this country sure but I own in New Zealander hallelujah hallelujah why because he's given me a new spirit amen he's given me a new spirit amen the the see let's just read this now what makes you see see what makes the woman never compow them the woman to do that never compow our men not to drink not to swear you just preach the gospel lay down the pattern of the Bible many men that comes to the Pentecostal faith and the Holiness faiths come in and profess to be when they're not in their heart many women does the same thing you don't tell them they have to do it you just give them the pattern tell them what the Bible says and if they're born of the Heavenly Spirit then their spirit is no more Americanized it's no more germanized it's heavenli ised am mean we're the kingdom of God because we're in another kingdom a kingdom of God where decency Holiness and power exists hallelujah amen so my spirit's been Heavenly ised amen cuz I belong to a different land praise God I'm I'm happy about that amen I'm happy about that amen because that means my spirit will cope with the word that means I love the Lord more than anything that means I'll put others before myself amen that means there's no selfish bone in my body amen why because my spirit has been Heavenly eyes amen praise the Lord why cuz I I belong to a kingdom where decency Holiness and power exist amen not a modesty filth and lukewarmness you belong all to the kingdom of God children amen this I'm pre yeah it's nice I get to preach to the choir all the time but you got to realize no I'm of a different spirit so when someone from your country comes along and tries to get you under their influence you got to realize no I can't ident sure I well it's nice being half South African I can identify with all the good food F it's a land of flavor I like food but when it comes to that Spirit of segregation that Spirit of aparte which I hate to say is still there I can't I can't identify with that because the spirit of God is all about a Oneness of the body one thing I hate in this life is racism I detest that spirit I hate that thing I want it to die and when it Surs a lake of fire I'm going to do a big dance cuz I hate that thing cuz it brings separation it brings Vision it brings distrust it brings everything that's not of God Amen but a Heavenly Spirit doesn't look at skin color because it's like when I go to Papa Guinea I'll just say it in English I say listen don't look at this we're all children of God there's no difference between us and it's the same here Glory Hallelujah I'm so thankful for that amen but see see now if our spirit's Heavenly then then we can't identify with our national Spirit we we can't identify with a tall poppy syndrome of a of a stabbing people in the back not saying things straight to their face and oh she'll be right kind of an attitude we can't identify with that sure it takes a while you know when the Holy Ghost comes in he's got to take dominion over those things but we're got to realize that being a being a former um I'll say transformed New Zealander I was going to say rehabilitator but we Ain re rehabilitated we're transformed by the Holy Ghost right but you see I can't identify with that anymore cuz that's not my spirit I have of the spirit of decency in an order where things are above board things aren't manipulated and great everything's black or white amen hallelujah amen we we live in a realm where power exists his power not National Power you know the greatest thing that brother Braham said that the greatest thing that a that a country can have that keeps off war and strife as Holy Ghost filed churches and camp meetings he says with more than hundreds of atomic bombs and silos am mean you got to realize the reason we have peace in this country is cuz God moves you are actually the biggest blessing to this nation and the nation doesn't even know it amen why cuz God is still here cuz you're here amen so we should never ever try and quench the spirit of God you know this kiwi Spirit quenches the spirit of God it doesn't want to talk about God it wants you to be happy about everything but God but the word says quench not the spirit so I think let's do the opposite let's just open the floodgates amen let's let them move in great power amen let's not try and St me it down and just cold formal you know I went to I went to you boarding school and it was an Anglican boarding school and do you know what the saddest thing was walking into a church where it's cold and formal you just repeat what the P this is Anglican Church I don't know why I'm going here but this is this is something a kiwi loves a formality even though we we appear to be informal okay you know but they you know they want to form even casual being casuals a form we ain't casual about the gospel we ain't casual about our Lord he wasn't casual about us he wasn't like yeah maybe I'll go die we'll see what happens whatever no he was determined amen he did not let anything stop him he didn't let the Pharisees stop him didn't let unbelief stop him didn't let the scribes stop him didn't even let his own disciples stop him when Satan got into Peter said you know no no Lord you can't go to Calvary you can't do this he said just get behind me Satan he identified anointing the inspiration on Peter you see he let nothing stop him cuz he had a greater thing he was looking at the joy that was set before him which was you redeemed that's why he went to Calvary amen for this cause I've come into the world praise the Lord now if he could look beyond the now and see the future cannot the true church of living God cannot cannot they look by faith and see the realities of his word greater than circumstance amen we can we're Heavenly eyes we can look Beyond amen let's try and get somewhere here now this we have one head this Kingdom has one king it ain't me it ain't a hierarchy of preachers it ain't the prophet it is the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen the one who governs this church is the Holy Ghost I actually said in SAR I said actually I'm the associate pastor here he's the main pastor and that's not passing the buck that's actually saying now what does the a pastor say what does he say about a situation and he's always his word right so the Holy Ghost he says the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost runs the church the prophet taught us am mean so in reality I say I am the associate because it's not my opinion that governs the church it's his word his word governing the church amen so now he is he has instructed us that we are to preach repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem this is the orders of this church this is your orders that you're here to live ye and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I S the promise of my father upon you but car you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen so this this gospel comes with power it comes with force it doesn't come with intellectual reasoning it comes with the power the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and so we have been instructed that we should preach repentance and remission of sins should begin pre being preached in his name from Jerusalem but it has to go to All Nations even to New Zealand to the end of the world this is the end of the Earth right here but we're but this is what we're instructed to do now this this began now you say this is the orders of the church to preach repentance and remission of sins in his name now this began in Jerusalem where Peter would preach on the day of Pentecost and he would you know you know he had preached and tell the people they have crucified the very Messiah and then and then they ask well then what shall we do men and Brethren what what shall we do and Peter said him repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so this is this is how um repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and we know as pet Jesus would say in Matthew 28 19 that that teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost one name and we from reading the scripture many people think that Peter either contradicts Jesus or Jesus's words of Matthew 28 are greater than Peter's words in Acts chapter 2 they aren't greater they ain't contradictory the one who Jesus that instructed his disciples to be B baptized people the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost was the same Jesus speaking through Peter in Acts chapter 2 there's no contradiction it's all see the Bible's all red letter it's all the words of God right so then then then then how does this reconcile well it's very very simple if you look at Matthew 28:19 it says name of father son Holy Ghost we understand that what is the name of them what is his name father's not a name I'm a father that's not my name I'm a son it's not my name I'm a person that's what I am like the Holy Ghost is what he is but none of those are titles they're just names so what is the name of the father son holy Holy Ghost well Jesus said I come in my father's name you receive me not what's the name of the father Jesus Jehovah's salvation he is the Lord Jesus Christ that is the one name of the father son Holy Ghost you say these things aren't very important well according to the king of this of this body of this people of the true church it's important amen now Church the word church actually means the called out ones where where in the um Israel was not called a church until it came out of Egypt So speaking of the called out ones so so we have been called out by this word amen to walk with him now we have access to our King see the true church of living God has access to to their King because he is the only mediator between God and man as the man Christ Jesus right so we have an interview with him uh whenever we want to call upon him we have no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but that one man Christ Jesus so we're living in a kingdom and we call it in the chronological um chronologically of the Bible the Messianic Messianic Kingdom in other words where the Messiah rules in every life in his domain ruling the Liv of his people are called out people from every Walk of Life Gathering them together in a group and calls it his church or his called out ones isn't that a beautiful thing now Israel was the people of God until we find in Acts 7:38 if you're putting it down that they were called The Church of God because they were called of God out of Egypt out of the world out away from other churches out away from other religions to walk with God Alone now we have an important role in this in this Kingdom because the Lord said we he's made us Kings and Priests to God so a king and a priest a king has Dominion right that's why we read Mark 16 it's amazing it's amazing with Mark 16 where many many new translations of the Bible they actually say that these scriptures are not actually in the original manuscripts that it's not the inspired word of God and you know I find it interesting because I've laid hands on the sick and they've recovered I've had warts you know when I was a young Christian I had a walk growing on my hand one and I just lay my hand upon it no was in to pray said Lord I ask you to take the life out of this thing and take it from me in the name of the Lord and it it went smaller and it shriveled up and left never came back and so you know and how many have been L hands have been laid upon them and been been healed or touched right so if God see see all the word's inspired but if people argue it's not inspired well you'd say well if God can do that with the uninspired what can he do with the inspired but we know it's all inspired but this is the principal works of the church to cast out the enemy amen wherever you find that evil one cast them out amen cast them out by the love of God cast him out by prayer cast him out by fasting but don't put up with him in your life amen we are called to lay hands on the sick speak with new tongues I don't know why people are afraid of the gifts we ain't afraid of the gifts that's part of God right but we should let God manifest Mark 16 in our lives this is the true church in action amen and God has restored all that back into the church in this day now I just want to make a bit of a segue here because as we read in the beginning that Joshua said that the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passeth over before you into Jordan so to make an entrance to cross into a new land and this is what the true church does its Works give an entrance that people can receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and become part of the body that's the true church in action are you following me right this is the true church in action and we all have a role to play in that amen we're not bystanders we are participators we're all part of the same body okay now David would pray in the um Psalms the psalm of David Lord I cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when I cry unto thee let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice this was this was David's prayer that his actions would be would be the same as as his prayers would be the same as the incense the altar of incense which is a sweet Savor to the Lord right so so God God when he hears our prayers it would be a sweet thing before him amen because we understand but by the shed blood of the Lamb that when we go to talking with God Amen if you're under the blood all of Heaven has to be quiet because God wants to hear your prayer but he says and the lifting up my hands as the evening sacrifice what is the evening sacrifice it's the time when the atonement is made time when reconciliation happens amen the evening sacrifice is is that sacrifice that Elijah gave on Mount Carmel to turn the hearts of the people back to worshiping God again amen so David's prayer is Lord may my life may My Worship to you bring reconciliation amen turn people's hearts back when I lift up my hand and sweet surrender with Thanksgiving Lord may you come down into my worship and touch someone's life amen that that that their heart is maybe their hearts been turned to the world been turned to Idols being turned to self being turned to Pride but may My Worship turn them amen you you got to realize we don't just sing for the sake of it we're not just Christians for the sake of it amen but God wants to use you as a Channel of his inspiration as his anointing am me because God wants to touch people Amen in this world through you yes so we're not just here to polish up things and make it sound good no we're here to worship amen that Lord when I pray may be a sweet selling sweet smelling incense before you Lord may be pleasing oh God but you as we were talking about it this week how brother Ram says that your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words amen so and and to me that that's such a blessed thing Lord may my may my thoughts of how great you are you're just walking through life Lord you're so awesome who knows what I'm talking about Lord you're so great Lord You Found Me Lord I'm so thankful Lord I was walking down this broad path of destruction and Lord you brought me on this narrow way and Lord you shed your blood for me and Lord You've redeemed me and Lord I knew what I was but thank God I'm not that person no more because of what you've done in my life Lord I'm so thankful Calvary became a reality to me Lord I'm so glad lord it's more than a story more than a nice idea more than a song but a reality that's gripped my life Lord I would love those thoughts just to reverberate Around Heaven hallelu that actually shakes Heaven amen cuz the sound like the Bas you you can feel the Bas so you sometimes it's so strong I pray our thoughts are like that through Heaven amen amen and and the Lord says I like that kind of thoughts glory amen now the priests had to stand in Jordan with the Ark in order to create a uh in order for Israel to cross over now this is very important they came to Jordan during the spring when it was flooding God orchestrated it that way because God wanted them to know the reason you're Crossing into your inheritance is not because of you but because you're following my word you're following the ark the Ark of all the Earth the Lord of all the Earth you're following me that's why I'm going to create a way for you to walk over a walk o walk through a river that actually becomes dry ground amen so those priests now they had to step into that water as soon as they did that water parted and however many million people whatever in all their o and you can see in the back of this picture they all can cross over cuz why the Ark of the Lord of all the Earth was being carried by the priesthood and they were commanded now if I can go back to this for the priests which bear the ark stood in the midst of Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua we ain't done God ain't done we got to stand in that Jordan represents death you got to stand in that death that that someone whosoever will can see you standing there carrying the word and they find an entrance into the Holy Ghost we have an important job you say I don't preach this is with all of us I don't sing this is with I don't play I don't I'm not some outward person in the church this is still you don't ever let the devil diminish what your position is your impact in life he makes us try and think we're useless helpless that we're ineffective he's lying to you he's lying to you why listen to his lies and say well I'm helpless if God be for you who can be against you amen no one can be against you nothing can Prevail if God before you amen but if you're not standing your position how can God be for you Hallelujah so they stood there until all was all was done I say friends there's still names in the book that have not crossed Jordan they have not died to S and be filled with the Holy Ghost they have not done that yet they've been on the journey they've come out of Egypt thank the Lord they've gone through the Wilderness God's cleansed their lives thank God God's got to do those things but they have not crossed Jordan yet they're not home safe that's why never be satisfied be thankful someone's on their way but don't be satisfied they're on their way only be satisfied when their home's safe because when the home safe is sealed to the day of their Redemption so we must never just be satisfied as someone just gets a touch from the Lord that's great but Lord may they get home safe amen so Lord May May Our Lives May our lifting of our hands be as that evening sacrifice till everyone is home safe under the blood Hallelujah but you see what happens is we've got to lay this to Heart we're actually going to take this on board lay it to heart and Jeremiah says many pastors have destroyed my Vineyard they have trotten my portion underf fooot they have made my Pleasant portion a Wilderness they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because no man layth it too heart we can't be like that friends we can't just go through the mo and now I'm not saying you are but never let the devil push you back and say well you just got to go through the motions of life no you've got a job you've got a calling and God's equipped you to live your calling out Amen to never become detached you got to realize we should have a burden for Humanity we should have a burden for our families now I'm not saying you don't but if you feel burdened that way God gave you that burden you should you should be bothered when people appear to be going sideways it should bother you not in a well they they know better and they deserve it what no no no it should bother you Lord get them back on the path something should cry out Lord bring them home bring them back lord they've being enticed and gone this way bring them back into that straight and narrow road Lord it should bother us if we love each other it should and you know when it says pastors here I know that's me but it's not you know mothers are pastors they've got a church Christine's got a Congregation of four She lays it to heart She lays it to her it's a good thing she cares I know you all do m and dads but you got to realize it's not it's not my job only to save your children I have my role but church starts at home right Fellowship starts at home am mean that when they when they see you they should see something they want they shouldn't see religion they should and irrespective of what condition our lives are you know what we're going through what do they see and I put that on me I remember when analis was born I I begin to think what will she see when when she grows up and sees me and then she gets to an age where she begins to compare and contrast with people and all these things what is she going to see a religious man God forbid someone who's just all rules and regulations God forbid will she see actually you know that that that when God begins to reveal himself to her you know will she be all confused cuz she thought God is like me cuz that's what happens us as fathers in print on our children a subconscious image of who God is so will she have this kind of confusion but God you say you're like this but I think you're like this cuz my father's like this you know or will she actually say oh yes that's the Lord because she doesn't have that confusion what about mom does she get this image how because really how mom is is how church should be the environment she creates remember we should this place should be a place of love and Care someone comes in something mortally wounded you know you like a hospital right what happens first so ambulance comes in someone with enough care gave their lives to serve their Community by being an ambulance driver they actually care they want to make a difference so a call comes out they go as fast as they can they get that person they're not indifferent they're like man you you've given me all this training all the training I I want to put into this person to get them to a place where they can get the proper help and shouldn't it be the same thing the Lord has given us training amen shouldn't I trust I'm not missing out parts of this that it doesn't impact you but you see you know the Lord has given us training that we should care when someone has been spiritually wounded even physically wounded amen that we now have a place a hospital a place of rest and healing that people can come and be refreshed and be renewed and be patched up and be sewn up and be fixed but it's the attitude of the staff that matter who's ever had a real caring nurse who's had a not caring nurse they do the same thing they do the same job but they're Polar Opposites we don't want to be the uncaring nurse we want to be the caring one right and so but then but then home should be like that too the environment because remember woman represents a church right so moms we should create an atmosphere at home that's like church where where kids when they come or people when they come they know what you're like at home the atmosphere you create the hospitality the love the care all those things the wisdom the guidance all those things that they have at home when they come to church they see this is just an extension of mom we got a job they all going to come home but remember it's whoo will will cross Jordan so don't beat yourself up it's whosoever will right they have to will but they're going to come I believe it amen but you see now the a big a big part of the church now is that we must never ever settle that our children have a different experience in Christ than us right the first generation comes in the fire is lit it happens all different ways but the fire falls they have a true Pentecostal experience where God comes and dwells in them I trust I'm not boring you with these things amen like like they on the day of Pentecost they are filled with the Holy Ghost and now the works of the church were that every generation would have the same experience that it wouldn't become anything different sure it may manifest in a different way amen but the life of God comes into that person and their life changes the word puts on flesh right and so as Joshua was commanded now before he crossed Jordan that the younger ones there's got to be another circumcision happened there's got to be a c you know a commandment went forth circumcised again that the same experience that the fathers had now the sons would have this is what we're got to we're always got to ensure that the god that saved you and I the god that lives in you and I will now live in our children this is the true church this is the work of the true church that the fire doesn't diminish amen that's it's not that well they're just racing church and now they're good people listen it's you know us that came out of the world God had to deliver us of many things but then the final thing he has to deliver us from is from ourselves there's got to be a death to self amen where it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and that's a thing that those who are raised in church they need that same experience when they come to a place Lord deliver me from my sin nature I'm born with Lord Lord take Save Me From Myself Lord that you can come and dwell in me and change my life praise God that's why we want to remember our CH I'm sure I said it on last Sunday but our children deserve a holy ghost Revival they deserve it they don't deserve churchianity and politics and fussing and fighting and chewing they deserve the power of God living in their lives amen that's what God gave us why should it be different for them you say well we're more a number and this and things have happened but he's still the same God he's still the same one he hasn't changed one bit amen praise the Lord now the now the Levites they had to carry the word over their hearts not in their head but their hearts this is why if you if you're carrying the word in your heart then you will you will give your life completely yeah and and the Lord will live sorry for this reading says my brother don't miss this my sisters you who want to be woman preacher so forth don't miss this no matter how much your anointing is you've got to get in God's provider um position David's anointing was all right but in doing what he did he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line that's when he put the Ark on a cart right a new cart that's what he's talking about here what did he do he stepped over the boundary line instead of putting the Ark in its original position he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulders of the Levites which is over the heart the word is not in the mind it's in the heart not on a new cart what was it some represented something new David did there spoke of every denomination ever be God's word is not carried by by state prors or Bishops and so forth of of denominations it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man and not in some ecclesiastical move the holy spirit is a treasure of God's love in the heart of man and woman to obey see amen so instructed to carry it carry it over our hearts why because we have to stand in Jordan that will create an entrance for the people I'm going to I'm going to wrap this up soon amen now what is this message of this church we said earlier about go preach in his name repentance remission of sin the message of the church is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen living in the church the king of the church raised from the dead the same yesterday today and forever performing the same Works doing the same things that Jesus did that's the message of the church if the church isn't teaching that it's teaching some false theology that's where Jesus commanded that's what Jesus commanded them to preach he's the same amen praise the Lord as Paul would Paul would say he all he determined to know anything among you speaking of the Corinthians it was save Jesus Christ and him crucified that's the message of the church all we should see is Jesus Christ and him crucified what happens when he got crucified his his Spirit got released right so when you only have Jesus Christ and him crucified in the people what he have the Holy Ghost on display Play Amen you have his word living amen that's no longer them but it's the the people become a living walking talking Bible amen you say that's impossible with you it is impossible but if you let God do it it's a guarantee more than just possible it's a guarantee amen so I'm just going to wrap this up with this brother ask a question you say Well I'm a Christian I'm glad but he asked a question don't he says always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform Miracles and we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge we have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take inventory of what kind of a fruit that your life you pre presently live now is bearing what is your life producing now is it a sweetness is it a love is it a joy is it a faith is it or is it stress and troubles and reasoning and complexes what is your life now currently presenting we got to take inventory I've got to take inventory we've got a job to do as the Church of the Living God now brother R would tell brother R would tell a story of a of a young boy that he had never seen a Mur before he lived out in the country he went into town he stayed with his auntie and one day this this boy he walked past this door that was closed and he looked and he saw a little boy and now this door had a ful length mirror on it so this boy looked at this boy and it looked a lot like him and he waved and the boy waved and he jumped and the boy jumped all at the same time perfectly synchronized and he walked up to the boy cuz he wanted to touch him to see if he was you know to see if he you know what he felt like and then he realized when he touched the mirror he looked back and said Mama that's me that's me now I want to ask you the question because we all have mirrors we look through or look into a lot of people have their own understanding as a mirror or their own reasoning mixed with scripture of course and quotes but is it the pure mirror of the word of God that your reasoning is gone your ideas are gone that it's just you say Lord I want to be a reflection of your word that when my life is held up to this mirror I can say mama it's me we must let ourselves be changed by the word we must do it cuz we don't not we don't want to get there on that day and realize we've been looking in a false mirror I'm sorry these things gone serious but we must be said Lord when I look into your word may I see my life not as a Pharisee or a sadducee or a make believer or an unbeliever but Lord what you describe a real believer to be may may I see my life now see see what fruit are we bearing I'm in the message that means nothing that really means nothing to God but are you under the blood as your life produces his word are you letting it if you're not letting it you're looking through a wrong mirror because Jesus nothing could stop him then nothing can stop you manifesting the word allotted to you for this age then you say well I don't know if my mirror is right I don't think that that sweetness is gone I just feel hard and callous and I just don't care and I want to do my own thing well I say sadly you say well then what what can I do to get that back you've got to go find him where you left him like Mary and Joseph remember they left Jesus at in Jerusalem they journeyed three days they presumed that Jesus was with them but they looked around they realized he wasn't there where did they find him where they left him I say friends if you want to be this for your family go find the we left him maybe it was an argument maybe it was in a fuss maybe it was in trouble I don't know but go back to that point because he's waiting for you there I'm just going to leave it there today maybe I haven't even touched my subject I don't know but friends let's have the musicians please you to come forward you'll find them where you left him don't just walk around presuming he's with you what's your life producing is it producing the fruits of the spirit oh you don't know my background you don't know where I've come from that's irrelevant God is greater than all those things there's no case in this building right now or those who are watching there's no case no background no circumstance that God says yeah you're right I can't do that no he can fix anyone he can change anything but we've got to be willing Lord change me to match your word Lord because I want to be a true represent ation of a Christian I want to be a real Christian Lord not a religious person amen let's stand shall we amen let's just raise our hands shall we let's sing that song Oh Lord You're
