[0:05] foreign
[0:22] good morning I'm Jehoshaphat king of
[0:25] Judah as you all know three enemy
[0:27] Nations the mobites amunites and the
[0:30] menu Knights recently joined forces to
[0:33] attack our nation and in response I
[0:35] commanded the army of Judah to confront
[0:38] their combined armies in the desert rule
[0:41] the reason I call this press conference
[0:43] is to announce the result of that
[0:45] confrontation two words we won
[0:48] your majesty do you have the casualty
[0:51] figures from both sides yes every single
[0:54] soldier from all three enemies died
[0:57] there was not one single Survivor and
[0:59] the casualties from the Emmy of Judah
[1:01] zero
[1:02] are you saying that none of us soldiers
[1:05] were killed not one how many wounded
[1:08] none
[1:10] are you saying that every one of our
[1:12] soldiers came out of the battle against
[1:14] three armies without a scratch well
[1:18] there are a few complaints about
[1:19] straight backs why the strained Backs
[1:22] from spending three days carrying out
[1:24] all the enemies weapons and supplies
[1:25] after the war was over
[1:27] it took your army three days to carry
[1:29] away all the spores of the war
[1:33] ning but it was three armies and they
[1:36] were all heavily armored your army
[1:38] Masters your army must have employed a
[1:40] secret weapon in this battle actually we
[1:43] had four secret weapons
[1:45] but one of those weapons include the new
[1:47] catapults invented by the Europeans I'm
[1:50] sorry I don't know what a catapult is
[1:53] it was an intercontinental ballistic
[1:55] missile that did it wasn't it never
[1:57] heard of it
[1:58] did you hire a Persian malicious destroy
[2:01] or people not one enemies not one
[2:04] Persian militia
[2:10] well what's he get weapons did you use
[2:12] first we fasted you say you fasted you
[2:16] stopped eating yes
[2:19] I will think that depriving your men of
[2:21] food will have the opposite effect we
[2:23] didn't fasten the day of battle we
[2:25] fasted before we win before the Lord got
[2:27] in prayer
[2:28] what good did that do
[2:31] by fasting we consecrated our bodies to
[2:34] the Lord and our minds became clear so
[2:36] we could hear the direction of God but
[2:38] these amazing attacks Judah before
[2:40] Israel had a confrontation with these
[2:42] same three nations joined the Exodus
[2:46] during the days of Moses
[2:48] let's get back to the secret weapons
[2:50] besides fasting what secret weapons did
[2:54] your army employ well of course we
[2:57] prayed and asked God for God for a
[3:00] victory
[3:01] no I'm talking about secret weapons make
[3:04] no mistake about it fasting a prayer are
[3:07] secret weapons okay let me put it in
[3:09] another way other than fasting and
[3:11] prayer what secret weapons that you use
[3:14] we humbled ourselves and magnified the
[3:16] Lord and he came down and spoke amongst
[3:18] us he spoke amongst you I will I will
[3:22] remind you that we are God's chosen
[3:23] people without side we don't stand a
[3:26] chance
[3:27] so without God bringing Vision through
[3:30] the word of his Prophet we were not a
[3:32] good chance we believed his profit and
[3:35] prospered because of it
[3:37] what was the word that God gave you
[3:39] jezeal the son of Zechariah the prophet
[3:42] told us that our prayers and repentance
[3:44] were received by the Lord and the battle
[3:46] against the three combined armies were
[3:48] now in God's own hand and we only need
[3:51] the standstill and see our salvation
[3:53] let's get back to the secret weapons
[3:55] besides fasting prayer and worshiping
[3:57] the Lord what secret weapons did your
[3:58] army employ we sang I'm sorry could you
[4:01] repeat that we sang
[4:04] well what kind of song did you sing give
[4:07] thanks unto Lord for his Mercy endures
[4:09] forever and as we sang God's ambushment
[4:12] against the enemy so all four of your
[4:15] secret weapons were not weapons at all I
[4:17] beg you pardon though all the weapons of
[4:20] the army that Judah needed to defeat
[4:22] these three armies can we talk about the
[4:24] weapons and tactics how did you kill all
[4:26] those soldiers we didn't
[4:28] you didn't not um as no we didn't
[4:33] but they are dead as did as Egyptian
[4:36] Army who drowned in the Red Sea
[4:38] but your army didn't kill any of them
[4:40] not one how did they die then
[4:43] he God did it he's our ultimate secret
[4:47] weapon do you have any idea how he
[4:49] killed all those soldiers
[4:51] he turned them against each other though
[4:53] they were all dead when we arrived all
[4:56] we had to do is collect The Spoils of
[4:57] War and you credit this the Lord listen
[5:00] I want you to write this down you're
[5:02] gonna hear this repeated over and over
[5:04] again for thousands of years in the
[5:07] future if God is for us who can be
[5:09] against us
