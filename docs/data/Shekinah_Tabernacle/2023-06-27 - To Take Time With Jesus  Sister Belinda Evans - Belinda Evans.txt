========================================

We'll just sing it. When the battle is raging and the pressure is strong, when all hell is against us and you feel we're not strong. We need to take time with Jesus. We need to worship him for he won the battle back at Calary. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. To think of his goodness, the way he sees us through. to s with him at his table and have a sweet fellowship. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. Every day we may worry about temporal things. how to dress and eat and how to make ends meet. But he said, "Do not worry about those temporal things. Let's take time with Jesus. Take time to worship him. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. To think of his goodness the way he sees us through. To stop with him at his table and have a sweet fellowship. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. He has given us talents to occupy till he comes to edify the body. For there are souls to be one. Let's possess our land and let us work in the field. Let's take time with Jesus. Let us fulfill his word. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. To think of his goodness, the way he sees us through. To suck with him at his table and have a sweet fellowship. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. To take time with Jesus is the best thing to do. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
