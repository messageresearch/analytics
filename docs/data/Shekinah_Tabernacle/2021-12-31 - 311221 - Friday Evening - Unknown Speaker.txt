there's a there's a few differences in the announcements and uh what time we were supposed to start or start um so a bit of confusion um apologies for that we we were told there was 8 30 but brother Isaac which is our master of cinnamonies uh had had the impression it was nine o'clock but it all works and this is exactly how um how the Lord wants it to work so um he's in control he's about five minutes away what we um suggest is I will open an in a word of prayer and then in your own start praying start meditating on um the gratefulness in your heart for another year that the laws LED you and um and the testimonies that will come so that the doors and the hearts be open for that as well if you can just buy your hearts Lord Jesus we are here at the end of of 2021 Lord the last day Lord almost now the last hour Lord that we as Saints as brothers and sisters Lord true connected in the spirit Lord can come together and and praise your Holy Name bring gratitude and a testimony and a song Lord to to glorify Your Name Lord to lift you up to to show an appreciation of what you've done for us for another year and the excitement that we have in ourselves for another year to come Lord until that day that you will come and take us away and take us through that Heavenly Feast Lord that winning table we cannot wait Lord but for now we are here we are here amongst Believers Lord we are here amongst people of like Precious Faith Lord Lord people that is pulling that is that is walking Lord that is uh grinding it out some days but for your will and your glory Lord thank you so much that we can dedicate this night to you we know there's a few people a second bodyman and body Lord I pray some of them are like like brother Ben that cannot be here Lord I pray that you heal him Lord I pray that you visit him and let uh touch him Lord in a special way he's he's a a huge special to us a a blessing Lord um to our lives Lord and such a Shepherd Lord looking after his flock be with him and his family as well everyone that's going to give us testimony tonight Lord everyone that's that's got a a bubble inside Lord bubbling over want to say or and and and and and Proclaim your

pray um in in in the authority that I have in Jesus Christ's name that every every spirit will be bind that is not of you that is not welcome in this sanctuary in this time lord um May you take full control as I said and and may this be a wonderful time a blessed time of testimonies and fellowship and song Lord um from our hearts from the depths of our hearts that will touch you as well and we pray this in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God to know Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] God [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign that's the last time I'll be late this year I promise you just got there brother adamant praise the lord it's um you always get a lot of mileage out of that joke for the when you get to the end of the year this is a very casual um event so it's not um not very really really formal so you can all just relax um yeah it's just um for yourself feel free it's not going to be all um I just dressed in my normal clothes too so but yeah it's good we're just going to have a good time and um just enjoy you know it's a time of reflection at the end of the year we can look back and um see where the Lord's taking us and I think I saw all of you here last year most of you so you're all better you're all you've all moved on and the Lord you're you're richer in Christ in some way I can guarantee it you're wealthier now than what you were last year more spiritually wealthier now and you know and it's the time we can just stop and look back on the year that has been and then also look forward to the year that that will be for some reason there seems to be a lot of um like pessimism about the last few years like oh I'm glad this year's over sort of thing I'm like man what are you talking about this is like being the best year of my life ever and next year is going to be even better you know I haven't found anything hard as a as a Christian we just every year is good you know it doesn't matter whether we have this covert this lockdown that that doesn't matter God's in control of it all and and through every situation we we are just walking with the Lord we are we're like a tree planted by the rivers of water and if there's a drought we don't feel it you know we just carry on we just go on and so I've had a fantastic year I don't know about you if you guys all had a good year it's it's been a fantastic year it's been the best year yet you know and and next year is going to be even better we're going to have a great year next year it's it's it doesn't matter what the world situation is or what the economic situation is or the medical situation is or anything like that because God has got such a great program for us next year it has he's got so many great things in store for us like that the windows of Heaven are opening up and pouring out upon us this is this is the season for for the the richness of God to come into each one of our lives and and the most powerful way that it ever has before that's that's where we're at that's that's the program that's what we've got looking to look forward to so we are the happiest people on the face of the Earth and we're content you know and and um yeah I'm just so glad to be a Christian I'm so glad that we can have hope imagine living a life with no hope they're hopeless you know you can apparently you can live without love you can live without a lot of things but you can't live without hope as soon as people lose hope they they die that's it like if they're under a heart at a under extreme hardship if they lose hope they die it's a it's actually proven you know you can live without love you can live without lots of things but you live without hope you're done but I'm glad that we have a blessed hope you know we we're always so positive because we know that all the scriptures we read in the Bible always when when Believers through all the ages trust in God God always delivers there's never a time where they do all the right things they trust in God and then it says and God didn't deliver him and then he just went off and failed and that was the end of that story and here's the next one you can't name me a scripture where that happened it's it's all positive like the promises of God are Yan amen so as a result we can look back and think look at our situation whenever we're going through and think well that's the same thing's going to happen to me if I approach God the same way that all these other people did and I approach the promises the same way then I'll receive the same thing that's the way that it's going to work you know we can have we can have so much hope so let's that's who we are so welcome to this um service tonight brother Ben did tell me it started at nine o'clock by the way he was like I'll get there at 8 30 and then people will just slowly turn up and then about nine o'clock make a start um but what we're going to do we've got um we're just gonna like I did want to like make it a bit more informal and push all the chairs out and stuff but apparently they were they were hard to move are they but we're strong bro look at these boys at the front here man they could love to cheer each look the night is young we've got the whole night ahead of us what we do now is the way it's going to stay for the rest of the night so if we want to sit like this we can if we want to move them around we can it's like we actually are we're sort of doing this here so it's up to us if we enjoy it like this we can do it like this if we want to move them around a bit we can it's up to us so we we don't have like a we don't have to talk to the um the head on how to say this like you know the denominations they have to sort of you know you've got to send you you gotta you gotta well if it's not in the program you can't do it you know um how do you feel you guys all do you feel all right like something like that or you feel are you all right yeah okay you're not going to be too like I don't want you all like you know hey yeah kind of I I like informal because it gets people just a bit more relaxed you know like when we sit like this we because we get conditioned like and I'm I'm like that in the church when I when I arrive in church and sit down I don't talk I'm not doing nothing I'm quiet apart from amen I won't like if someone talks about I'll talk quietly and that's just that's that's etiquette in a church you know because you don't want to disrupt other people's worship but man I find when we do this here like I find a hard to snap out of that mentality okay let's move the chairs and we're all going to be tied at 12 30 and move them all back [Laughter] uh let's make a circle like a yeah just just so there's enough room for everyone to sit in yeah the old timers will know how to do it all the old timers show them how it's done uh one one if possible and then we can have a few at the back of people who got children they can go at the back uh maybe leave that one not there because I'm thank you okay [Music] everything [Music] that's good it's like actually thank you [Music] okay without people oh yeah okay yeah now we're talking that's getting a bit more relaxed now I'm feeling quite I'm feeling at home now like I can settle in for the night have a good time shake hands with one another if you haven't if you haven't met each other look now you can do the circle if you want my brother info is we're all family here yep [Music] it's all right thank you [Music] I think when Jesus was with us disciples they were all pretty relaxed they're probably sitting around like this you know John was leaning on Jesus they were just all relaxed that's what we're going to be tonight okay now I'm feeling like we can praise the Lord let's um let's sing one or two songs and then we'll open up and pray after that let's sing um I feel like traveling on and then I've got our little man here has

prayer life amen if you if you bow your hearts again and close your eyes think upon the Lord Jesus Oh Lord what a wonderful time Lord your time is perfect you're always on time Lord you orchestrate

come in you are faithful you've never never failed us Lord and as we see tonight as well it was all in your hand Lord and as I prayed earlier Lord I really want everyone to open their hearts Lord if there's any testimony out there may we hear it Lord may it bless us and any songs that's pressing on the heart even if it's it's bubbling lord it's our theme song almost in this church Lord because it

barrier tonight amen if you're not through the sound barrier yet let tonight be a night where you go through the sound barrier amen hallelujah oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him Deuteronomy 30 16. and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God in to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it I was kind of thinking that with a lot of these promises it's like do this and then I'll bless you like I was kind of thinking that it does require bravery you know like to trust the Lord and actually go Lord I commit this to you I Surrender it to you it's like brave people get all the blessings of God because they give everything you know and I was just thinking about a song that blessed me this year a lot um and sister Belinda sent it through to me and it was called um be it unto me according to Thy word and I was thinking yeah like that's like a full surrender just be it unto me Lord like Mary said according to Thy word you know like Marius gave everything and then you know because it's a lot of sacrifice that she did but she her life was blessed and then we have what we have because of how the Lord sacrificed you know so it's like yeah if he gave it sometimes we can feel um like we don't necessarily deserve it quite undeserving of all these promises and blessings but it's so awesome that it's not conditional it's just a gift to us so sometimes when we don't know even how to we're going to say be it unto me according to that word and um maybe is there one more black mic can you give it to my friend over there please there's one right opposite that I'm looking at thank you I just think yeah which one aren't we so blessed we have so many friends straight away it's like it it could give it to anybody um sister but Lindy remind me um so we want to I know brother Anis loves learning new songs brother Anis so there's a new song a new part to this that I think only about a handful of us know it's a it's a Maori so I need sister Belinda to help me what key shall we start in it's just be done to me but we're going to sing the Maori version [Music] [Music] according to Thy word according to thy promises I can't stand secure [Music] now upon my heart your truth that sets me free according to your promises [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] another time in my eyes to me according to your world according to your promises [Music] the truth that sets me free according to your promises [Music] foreign [Music] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters okay I'll only share a small Testament I'll try and keep it small and like Isaac says this is the best year ever it's been a wonderful year of blessings amazing amazing blessings because God has been there so um I wanted to just say this because the girls sang that song um when um Dimitri had just started his I think I can't remember if he'd started the chemotherapy or he already had one round we he was we were at the Ronald McDonald House Down in Christchurch and so we had that we got one room to share and he was in the bed next to me and I woke up at one in the morning and for the first time it began to overwhelm me because God had promised right from the beginning he'd given me all these scriptures all these promises so I'd never been worried but um at one o'clock in the morning we can all get a little overwhelmed um and he just gave me one line from that song but it was niggling at me so I had to look it up on my phone and I had to play it with earphones in because Dimitri was asleep I'm wearing a house with a lot of other people but it was just such an amazing blessing that song during every time that anything becomes a little too much he just gives you something to be so joyful and praiseful about so that one o'clock in the morning I'm lying in bed screaming singing with all my strength silently because people are asleep with this with this song going on and it was the most amazing blessing now every time I hear that song I just remember that that moment where he was there Hallelujah [Applause] please send that which persecute you bless and curse not it has truly been such a blessed year and I can't um pass up an opportunity to say the Lord has been so good to me um I've actually been saying it a few times today he's been so good to me um the just keep thinking that's for me the song is Lord Lord surely you've been good to me and it's truly it's I've never felt it so much as this year he's my life is completely his and nothing can harm me nothing can touch me unless it's his perfect will and then it's the best thing ever for me it's such a wonderful Revelation to have just to know he's in control one scripture that's been very um much blessing to me is the one that's just the genie just read the Lord is my shepherd um since for a couple of months it's been my scripture so I don't think I could have even read it so thank you they're just so thankful that I'm just as sheep I don't have to figure anything out he he's my shepherd and he will take me all the way he's got his eye on me and I know he's it's all his ability and I'm so thankful God bless you um he that handled mathemata wisely she'll find good and who's so trusted in the Lord happy as he Proverbs 16 20. I was sitting here thinking I wonder which one I would get and that really makes me happy because um that couldn't be more perfect um I just have a thankful heart um yes this year has indeed be a really really blessed year um it's been a hard year it's been lots of Trials but one thing that I can say is that the Lord has definitely helped me handle a lot of matters very wisely um he's given me the ability and um to be able to trust in him completely even when I couldn't see anything I couldn't see um through the trials and the trials came thick and fast and hard and the more I trusted in the Lord the harder the trials came but then he just proved to me that all I needed to do was just trust in him completely um one thing I can say with an absolute thankful heart is um through it all he's never ever felt me yet and it didn't matter what the victory was that it didn't matter how big and I and and I have had some huge victories and I've had some little victories but they were victories anyway and through it all he never failed me and it's because I've trusted in him completely it didn't come easy trusting the Lord is not easy because a lot of the times I wanted my own will and I I wanted certain things um but the trust came in ways that I didn't expect in the outcome but I came through the trials and um I can't believe that it's the end of the year I said to Matt I can't believe that we on the last day of this year and it almost feels to me like we were sitting here a year ago already and it's a year later and I can't even feel like it's another whole year that's gone by um and it doesn't feel like a whole year to me but um I just want to thank the Lord um I don't think I mean I could sit here all night saying thank you to the Lord because I'm so thankful for everything that the Lord has done for me and my family this year um but um yeah not only not only for myself but also to every single one of you that's here tonight as well um whenever we've asked for prayer and through everything um I just want to thank every one of you as well for being there for us for us and Marlon family and for prayers and lifting us up before the Lord and um and most importantly thank you to the Lord for everything that he's done for us [Applause] oh how great is thy goodness which thou has laid up for them that fear thee which thou has wrought for them the trust in thee before the son of Sons of men um yes um my my favorite song is um goodness of God um God has just been so faithful this has been a awesome year again like brother Isaac said um we've got a huge privilege that we can look past all these little worldly circumstances and just see how how in in Fashion Nation how the Lord is is forming and and pushing us through this um The Squeeze um you know I've been recently listening to brother Donnie Regan's sermon on Enoch and the stonemason Mason and the the Capstone and we are pushing into that Capstone with this and it fits so nicely and with the prophet with the dream that he had with a Capstone and inside is is white it's nothing is for us it's meant for us and um good Testament in I was hoping my wife would be here it was our our six uh 17-year anniversary this year in April we had such a such a good time the Lord has been has been good in in our trials and our challenges uh especially with me um but on that day it was it was lovely because it was 17 years that we celebrate celebrated um the the temperature was 17 degrees everything everywhere I looked was just 17 everything was 17. um and as I mentioned it and in my in my uh in my morning drive to work with brother Armand uh I said yeah 17 years you know it's and he goes oh that's a good number the biblical number of 17 and I I actually didn't look it up and I went and and it was that whole new dispensation this whole uh Victory this overcoming power that it's a very very strong bold number and I thought wow in in our 17th year we um we we quickly snuck away uh probably now two three months ago to Queenstown me and her and our gate was gate 17 so they'll be rewarding again the Lord said no no I'm not done yet and um and I would say nanelle in the coffin the nail and the coffin for Satan is um um how old was David when he came back into the to your house 17. and when he said that the day before he I I thought Lord this this is the year this is the and uh

living in the same vessel for your children it has to be him alone so just live for him and let your life before his glory put him first you know we read in Matthew 6 put God first and he'll do all these things for you what it really boils down to is it's for his glory and you life you just lay everything and you just live for him to completely and utterly because I'm sure that everybody in here

time and he remains faithful and faithful all the time Hallelujah what a blessing God be sir [Applause] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit amen um yes I've been away again for another year at Uni I'm just very thankful that the Lord has been providing good word for every moment that I needed it and um I'm just thankful that he's been keeping the fellowship in Dunedin and the Saints there I'm just very thankful that he uses every single one I know we may be a small group but the law sees it and I remember brother said he weighs the hearts and I know that he does and I'm thankful that I guess it may get even tougher but we're just thankful that God's kept us this far and it doesn't mean that things will change with God because he never he always stays the same so I'm thankful that he has his word by his word we can overcome amen [Applause] not rendering evil for evil nor railing for ruling or all railing for railing but contrary wise policing knowing that ye are they aren't too cold that you should inherit a blessing first Peter 3 9. I just want to say um just thankful um to the Lord just for helping me throughout this year and I feel like every year there's going to be uncertainties a lot but I'm just thankful that the Lord has kept me and sometimes I'm really blessed by like the watch night services because it makes me realize how much God has done throughout the whole year I mean it's like oh you recognize wow God you've killed me so long and um yeah I just want to share like two things I really thankful for that the Lord has really um showed me is that like to really appreciate the small things in life and another thing is just to have good balance in life as well and different things and um I'm just so blessed by that and just to even though it may feel like it's just so hard sometimes I feel like God has taught me a lot of patience and to just um keep trusting in Him but I'm thankful and thank you I'm thankful that all of you are here as well but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness champions again such there is no law Galatians I'm just thankful that with this great trials these great blessings it doesn't matter my emotions when I'm up when I'm down this way that way emotions it doesn't matter I'm thankful that there's an income an anchor holds hey and the prophet said that every wave will crest and I believe that and I'm very thankful to the Lord it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hack and Dylan gently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the Earth amen there's the truth um and I believe in that Deuteronomy 28 actually there's about 12 verses after that that's blessings and all the other words after there's curses so I'm glad to be able to read the blessings one and that the Lord is faithful in that you know that's all we have to do is follow in what He commands us to do and he definitely blesses us so I praise the Lord for that [Applause] that looks like me [Laughter] is it my birthday again is it my blessed are they Rich through hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and I reckon that cake does it all amen read it properly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen Philippians 4 23. and I just want to say that um maybe uh me and my wife maybe maybe new we've we may be new to the the faith to some degree but it's it's been a complete Journey for us and it is so we're so blessed to have such a wonderful group of people here and and have such a wonderful Lord with us it's just unbelievable what we've come through I won't go into it but it's uh 2020 was a year that I'd rather forget 2021 is a year that I will always remember as a year coming back it's it's been it's been wonderful wonderful everything that the Lord and and and everyone here has been able to give us and I can't repay uh so thank you [Applause] maketh rich and he added to Sora with it proverbs 10 22.

Godly people and we love you very much praise God [Applause] beloved I wish above all things that thou May is prosper and be in health even as thy Soul prosperous through John 1 verse 2. um I just want to thank the Lord for just everything that he's done I feel like my whole life especially in the last three and a half years have been has just been one testimony after another and I just want to give God all the glory for it even though I can't say it all right now especially if I'm nervous um but yeah um yeah I was just thinking one thing that's really blessed me lately is um I think somebody had said to brother Brown I'm how she'd rather be in the word than in heaven okay I can't remember exactly but she said um I'd rather be found in the word than in than in heaven or Earth because heavens and earth shall pass away but my word will never pass away and I've just been pondering that quite a lot and um yeah I just I believe if we keep in the word then we can run our last mile home praise the Lord [Applause] bring you all the tiles into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now hereworth says the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that they shall not be room enough to receive it Malachi 3 10. and I'm just thankful to the Lord for this year it's been a year of Plenty and by that I mean plenty when it was blessings it was blessings and when it was trials it was trials you can understand Christine how she found me sitting on the bed couldn't move couldn't stand up yeah that was the climax of my trials for this year way after that I couldn't see it or do anything for about six weeks or so but our God Is A Healer here am I I was dancing here today I cannot thank him enough and for that I'm just gonna sing this little song I don't do keys so you'll just join me life is easy when you're up on the mountain you've got peace [Music] you know change and you're down in the valley

Jesus is glad tonight because you are late amen not that much of a speaker and I can't say much brother Isaac has already told me that is gonna squeeze me and I agree that we are living in the times of the squeeze this is the days of the squeeze and I accept it and I appreciate it because squeeze the more squeeze the more time to go home comes closer right I wonder if I can just borrow this little plate and I'm sorry that and we had to fellowship and enjoy and that's part of worship and that's part of that's part of that's part of the business of God amen amen you may despise us oh you made despise us we are in the business in the business you made these spices [Music] okay so I thought I can just give you a bit of a taste of 2022 how many are happy how many ones to worship and praise the Lord tonight brother Isaac was the time the time is now 11 23 amen just 30 minutes just over 30 minutes before we cross over 30 minutes so I would like everyone to be awake because as brother Isaac said this is going to be a sermonette sorry can I take this thing up this one [Music] amen so [Music] um just a bit you caught me off guard because I thought we were still going to read and then afterwards I come but let's read in the Book of Revelation let's just read in the Book of Revelation one verse and we read one verse and then um can you just open this one for me sorry oh yeah it's all right this is not mine I must confess I'm sure you're amazed ah 2022 is bringing new things holding a tablet so it's not mine do you want to open Gmail no no Gmail I've got a document here I'm not sure if it's connected to Internet or anything God bless you and we're going to read Revelation the last chapter there's no revelation 23. people wants to go to Revelation chapter 23. revelation 22. and then I like what you did Brother Isaac I love that very much when everyone participate when everyone reads a scripture then you personalize things that's the only place where you must take things personal is when you come to the word of God otherwise don't take things personal don't take things personal one day um I'll I'll find it now I just want to find it and then we read a scripture one day um my family wanted to take a walk to kaitoki and I didn't want to go and then something happened and then I said but you are leaving me alone here and everything and then they were going to work everybody was in the mood and my daughter said no dad you're missing the point this is not about you I said what a painful statement but it was the truth sometimes we think things are is about us when it's not about you but on the end he likes to say You must look at the bigger picture the bigger picture so revelation 22. sorry I left my glasses but I'll use this once and there's 20 there's 20. there's 20 are we there he which testifies he who he which testify it these things saying surely I come quickly do you see that one surely come quickly it's written in red that's the word of the Lord Jesus directly amen even so come Lord Jesus verse 21 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen Heavenly Father we thank you for your love for your grace Lord I pray that you receive all this worship and this testimonies that has gone out tonight because father you can see every heart you can hear every voice father you can listen to voices and hearts of billions and billions and trillions of people at the same time and you can hear each one individually and you can answer to each one individually Lord we are not even 100 in here now everyone has worshiped everyone is in your presence I pray father God that you just bless your weight may this word be a reality to our lives each and every heart each and every testimony each and every word that we read there may you make it practical in our lives father the time of Fury is over it's now the time of practical as we always say father we want the now God and as we cross over into 2022 my Lord I pray that you change our Focus Lord I can see even his brother Isaac zooming that video that big video focusing Lord on a small little tiny thing on the ground maybe and you zoom it and he focuses until the picture is so clear father God make us like that tonight Focus us right Lord bring us to the right Focus that Lord you can take us like you took Enoch we commit your word into your head into your hands that you will bless you to the heart of your children in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I'm so happy I wish I did I didn't wish to preach tonight like brother Isaac was told at 9am in the morning brother Ben told me around four around four and he said hey man I'm not well I'm home but I'm not well I said you are Thou Art well he said I am not well so you are going to preach I said no no no no no he said I spoke to Isaac he's going to preach you are just going to give just a dessert I said okay but just tell that Isaac he's the main speaker tonight because he got off on Wednesday and now I want just to come in the background now we come here Isaac makes me the main one and he just read scripture I think this yes must talk about this anyway I started to ponder and ask God what must I talk about Lord I don't want just to speak to the people the imagination of my of my mind and thoughts I want to speak your word and father God only you can speak to your people and the Lord said hey go and make a revision because I never change if if you don't pass a question paper for the Lord the Lord will give you the same question paper every time until you pass it and he will tell you you're going to write a test same one same time same examiner everything until you pass it and with the Lord pass Mark is hundred percent not 99 I love you for that so now we're just gonna do a revision just to catch up on what we spoke about this year and the sermons that I obviously I cannot speak about all of them but we're just gonna take those titles and I wonder I wonder how many on the floor can remember one title of the sermon that I preached or that we spoke about that I spoke about with you this year I wonder uh can I see any hints overcoming power amen another one more The Sixth Sense another one will you marry me that's that's my favorite one ah another one you forgot that's why we are doing revision that's why we are doing a summary what they call a synopsis that's what we'll do tonight but the Bible says you know even so come Lord Jesus because the one who said these things the one who says these things he really means is me it means business but the world can see you see the world can hear it but he's the one who said these things he says I come quickly now at my work you know every every morning we have a meeting and everyone must say how you feel out of five one to five how you feel then we've got a feeling of how everyone feels and we know how to approach you today and we talk about work and what is the plan and everything and then so the team leader likes to say hey and what is an engagement question what can we talk about just give us anything then she just chooses anyone what can we talk about what are you going to eat for Christmas what's the plan you know those can just to break their eyes so today she said um what are you going to do differently in 2022 you know she's asked through that question and everybody says Ah I'm going to exercise this I'm going to I'm going to try to be fit in 2022. another one said I'm gonna try to leave my smoking habit and then and she just called names names by and then another one say oh this is I'm going to to try to eat healthy and then a lot of people said I'm going to try to exercise and be fit and I said what am I going to say this is an opportunity for me to throw a bomb do you know a bomb I said to her you know seen that every one of you is concentrating on the physique me in 2022 I'm going to have a a closer relationship with God I almost cried when I I I had I had a deafening silence a different Silence from all the excitement and the laughing and the smiling I just saw the hidden the head the head and loading seriously I said my I said I said this year I want to focus on my relationship with God and I and I stopped there amen then for a second my team leader realized that everyone is quiet she just said oh that's nice that's nice then we said okay then then we move to the next next person said I I'm gonna be feed this year then the noise come back again yes yes or even me and then then I realize that oh Lord there's something here but thank you for allowing me to throw the bomb uh no no you are very very safe when you are in the middle of the storm have you heard this before because the pool that is coming the sister spoke about trials this year stationon spoke about it Elizabeth spoke about it you know there were testimonies you see let me tell you something let me guarantee you this is a guarantee let me give you a guarantee this is one thing for sure trials and temptations are going to be added more in 2022 that's what I want to just to make it clear before we can go further they are going to be more more are coming and brother Isaac said almost I almost put words in his mouth he he came to me as if he said you know bring them on why how can you say bring them on you are so insensitive brother Paul you're not careful you don't know what you're talking about no I know because you are me and you are very privileged to be in the middle of the tornado do you know a tornado if you are on the outskirts of the tornado you are in a very catastrophic spot you are in a very dangerous position because everything under periphery on the outside of the tornado it's squid I don't know I don't have a right weight but it dies it just disappears it breaks everything on the outside so but it was the storm we sing a song here we sing a song here in the middle of that storm Ah that's where he is and that's where the eagle is cruising in the middle of the storm so don't worry be in the middle be in the middle of that storm now don't don't be not the sermons that we spoke about this year was where do faith and love meet how many remembers that one well life well love and Faith meet what happens that was one of the questions we spoke about this year what happens in when they meet there in your soul what happens we said you'll find a soul mate what happens when When Love and Faith meet I won't be long another one that we spoke about this year I'm just gonna go through them what house will you build me remember that one what house will you build me huh because heaven is my and the egg is mine so what house are you going to build me what house the tallest building in Malaysia is it still Malaysia or Dubai now Dubai what what house can you build me what do they call it Mount Califa what is it the total one can you build me a house like that one what house are you going to build me he needs a house where he can dwell and that is in the middle of your heart in the soul that's where he that's the mansion which you can build him where he can sit don't be on the outer court on the middle be in the inner in the holy of that's the house that we can build for the Lord when you the queen and him are they that's the house we can build him are we together and then we spoke about transforming back to where you were before hey this one you know the word of God just excites me that's why I'm laughing like this we said you know God's power of transformation there was nothing sister Shannon there was absolutely nothing do you know to say nothing is an understatement we can't imagine what nothing was before the creation but the God's power to transform said let there be the Bible says the spirit of God was above the Deep what is the Deep what what it was where where but there was nothing it was Darkness and he said let there be light and the power of God are there to transform and the locals came running Maybe 300 and billion miles a second out of his mouth and the logos came and he said stop you know the prophet dramatize it and then there was light what was that it was the God's power to transform what makes a butterfly to break out of that cocoon is God's power of transformation because it is his word he said let there be and the Butterfly have you ever seen a little chick hatching you know don't help it you are not God's power to transport no your hands are not there God's power of transformation will help if you help it because there is a power there to help it to transform that's what we spoke about today so don't try to help God in your life all you need to do you allow God's power to transform to change you as we cross over in 2022 think about the Israelites when they were crossing when they were crossing into the promised land brother Isaac when they were crossing on on that night how did it feel what they oh we're crossing oh no they were not when the Midnight Cry came out and they say hello you know in Africa when there's a bride and the bread we don't say no no no we Shout because the bridegroom has arrived and the bride is coming out to meet him we say wow what do you say brother we say the bridegroom has arrived and everybody wakes up everybody wakes up in the Bible the Bible says they started to prepare their lamps because the bridegroom has arrived huh we are crossing over now physically we might be crossing over in 2022 yes we are closing but actually we are on the bridge of crossing over into heaven the sound has come out Reuben what did he say because you see when the bridegroom comes he's coming to fetch a bride he are very happy for the bride to be joined in with the bridegroom you're so happy when these young girls get married we get so happy you know there's nothing about God's power to transform to bring one and one to one you know the gods mathematics is not one plus one is two no no is Stephen and Tessa is one one equal to one of course mathematics Isaac Shannon you think he's two one so when when when that power to transform two into one come when it happens How can there be quietness how can you see it and say okay ah yeah the Lord the lord loves us huh the lord loves us yes he loves us therefore we must we must come here and jump in reality not to show off huh so that's what happens when God's power to transform takes place we we get so happy when a new baby come why who who can tell me here brothers and sisters have you ever seen I spoke about it before everything that is a baby that is born is so beautiful you can think of a puppy even a little snake poison us so nice the prophet says oh it's so beautiful when you look that little beautiful colorful snake that's the prophet it's not me he said that you know you you see a little cheek so fluffy my Guru so fluffy so soft and a puppy have you ever seen it a little baboon everything that is in you even in your car when you buy a new car have you ever smelled the smell of a new car inside you just go new everything that is new it's beautiful and a new life is beautiful that's how the Lord feel when your life transforms when your life is new Ah that's how that's excitement for the Lord he says Ah that the Lord does not know what to do with you he just want to Rapture you take you home you are not worthy to be here on this Earth well when when your life reaches that point when he saw remember there's someone from Isaac there was us in this ass but there is the real Earth is for the foundation he's got our picture like this and we are getting there the camel pulls back we get them you know we are getting closer very soon we sing a song here thank you for these songs brother I believe the songs of our brother Isaac we are going to sing them a lot in heaven I just enjoyed them you see you see I'm sorry the moment you get in the spirit of the composer the moment you if you can just switch in the spirit of the composer the one who wrote the song then you start to realize that is not Isaac who wrote that song there's somebody who wrote the song yeah you're going to realize that there is a as I was the writer but there was a writer within the writer remember remember I told you that you are so special you are actually a special of the special you you are not just special you are the special of the specials have you ever found especially the shop they said these things that Teresa is so special 50 off but you the manager says for you I give you the special within a special ten percent for you how would you feel is it a test how will you feel you say oh me why me no no don't ask why me I'm giving you 10 percent top of the special especially within your special you take it he's not asking you say take it will tell you the independent you know the Indian business people they're so business-minded when you buy they don't ask you no no no it's yours you just take it oh he's not asking you what I know it's yours take it yeah so there's no entrepreneurial so you are a special within a take it it's yours don't ask questions you have been transformed that's what we spoke about also this year and then we're just doing a revision am I right I can't really discourse all of them and then we spoke about uh this powerful sermon called uh religious spirits and holy spirit how many remembers how many remember that one we spoke about the religious spirits Spirit and Holy Spirit and we said hey be careful if you're a believer don't have a religious spirit to come to Chicago does not make me a Believer it is wonderful it's one step in the right direction but has helped that spirit not a religious one right how many remembers this one I was very dramatic when I preached this one because I wanted to warn you that hey brothers and sisters let us not be in a religious spirit but let's be in the Holy Spirit within our religion let's have the Holy Spirit then we spoke about the purchasing power of Faith oh brother and he jumped when I came with this one because he's a businessman you know that if they give him a precious in power that means his business is strong he can buy more huh he's kill Kitty so the patient faith has got such a powerful pictures in power you back again with anyone when you've got faith you you no one can beat you your patience in power is so strong you come in they sit down see I want that one because he's got such a strong purchase in power and we must use it we must not live like how I spoke to two Sundays ago or two Wednesdays when we said living below your privilege no no no we've got their patience in power we are not on credit we don't owe anyone the Lord has already paid it and the patience in power is so powerful so that's what we spoke about and the purchasing power we we spoke about the love of Abraham how he had faith and you know how Abraham could do anything anything literally how can you say your son Must Die what I mean because you know that the one who who who will take his life he will resurrect him instantly that's what we know that's how Peter zimba Faith does not work according to this world and then we spoke about um overcoming power part one how many remember this one we spoke about they were overcoming power we are still waiting for overcoming power part 100 but I think we went up to part three or four in part one we spoke about not not not by might huh no by power but by my spirit say the Lord and we said that's how they build the Temple of Jerusalem and them it was a hard time of Israel and it is a hard time now my sister my brother not by might no no but by the transforming power of God we are going here he will see us through amen and we spoke about overcoming power part two that's what it was a continuation we spoke about what does it take to have that overcoming power how many remembers that one and then we said we read Romans chapter three and we said we find that every time time there is a rebuilding or transformation or renewal or Revival of a temple or a person in person's life your Jerusalem there is a war he said today we are going to This Means War it's not a joke sometimes we think it's a it's a joke I'm I'm finishing brother Isaac and then my first sermon that I preached in New Zealand is the one that I pray to sister moodly and she asked for more but I didn't have more we spoke her I was still here I was so fascinated about the firstborn you remember my sister and I said the firstborn you know there's something it's not because I'm the firstborn no it's not about me it's not about me but you see you are the firstborns you are the tithing of the Lord you without you there's no Harvest without without who you there's no Harvest did you you remember the song for the Isaac that he wrote that song is so deep for me for me but as we are singing that song I can see them the Reapers I can see them moving in the field Winter's coming and they're reaping and there's a chili and you know the season is changing and they're eating and they're piling them in the in the in the in the storehouse there so you are the tithing of the Lord so the firstborn the Church of the firstborn is you so never under allow the devil to to trick you as we cross over make a shout in your heart for the Lord make a very loud noise to the Lord and say thank you Lord for we are crossing over we are crossing over into 2022 with a bang [Music] with you in this boat let the storm come and we must be ready we must be ready sometimes we say bring the storm on when it comes we cry it's nice to classify but we must take it by faith knowing that the one who we have whom we have he can say to the storm stop you can actually say Lord I saw you stopping this the storm the waves I want you to give me that opportunity my father because you said I will do greater things I want to stop that storm maybe you gave me this tire to test me to allow me to ask you to stop it and it comes you see you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you are going to stop because I saw my father doing this and I've asked you Lord is it your will I want to stop that thing I want to stop these thoughts that come to my mind and I know it's the devil I want Lord you to kill them 2022 let them come but I want them to die they are not going to have any effect on me amen so that is our attitude as we go in 2022 and then we spoke about the little negatives becoming the positives remember the little Shadows that I brought here and I said the New Testament is just a shadow here the body that we are wearing now is just a negative there is real reality when it is busy being developed is busy being processed and that process of cleaning is not an easy one I can tell you if we can put you with the clothes in the in the in the machine you will know that the process of washing is not an easy one you will know how much more percentification much more about baptism of the Holy Spirit that's fire your band and you become new out of that chaos a good chaos call it a good destruction that's what we call it amen so that's what we spoke about some of the sermons this year and I wanted to take this few Summoners that we spoke about this year just to reflect let to reflect on them just to let you think that Lord thank you so much for allowing us to see 2022 as we cross over I think of Joshua and Caleb I think of them and the Jews following them the young we call them in Africans the young Spanish the young people crossing because all the ones the old ones died you're going to cross and then you are going to cross bravely amen decide on Sunday we are going to sacrifice for the Lord and we are going to Cross by the grace of God that's what we are going to do tonight we are going to go into 2022 without fear without prejudice why because you've had testimonies what God has done this year it's not all what we do it's not all that brother there God healed him of cancer brother Bondo cancer that's why the prophet even preached a sermon do you fear cancer because God told me specifically about that demon he's not not even cancer will stand before you and brother Brahman is the way of shift you are the all the Harvest not cancer will stand before you that's the testimony there you can visit the brother he'll tell you everything he'll tell you about the day the little Dove came on the window just like when they prayed for Florence Nightingale in London the little window came in cool cool and then it left just a video for it did you showed to show the church those are the testimonies he said greater things shall you do so brother and sister what am I saying don't underestimate the power of God and that power of God is in your life is in my life young people Kira Jesse this is not a joke this is the year of change I always challenge the young people when they close school I say what is your purpose for these holidays what are you going to achieve in these eight weeks what are you going to achieve what is your plan by the time schools open you must say Lord I have achieved the Lord don't Idol because the idly mind is the devil's workshop don't allow go hunting do everything but make sure that you read at least a chapter a day one chapter start with the big ones or the small ones doesn't matter read one every day because you've got the whole day when you eat your lunch make sure you've read your Bible first that's my message for you into 2022 young people older people or adults you can also take there if you want but come 2022 you have been transformed cross over with confidence cross over with a joy challenges I guarantee you I'm giving you guarantee they're coming flat of them and we're waiting for them because he promised them he never promised us a role a walk in the park no no they are coming we want them want to get them we want to get into them strong by faith amen as we get into 2022. so may God bless you I believe that the Lord has given you victory [Applause] what's that song that I was singing I just have it in my heart man if I if I can sing that one just for a second that song that I was singing what did I say to someone oh yes which one
