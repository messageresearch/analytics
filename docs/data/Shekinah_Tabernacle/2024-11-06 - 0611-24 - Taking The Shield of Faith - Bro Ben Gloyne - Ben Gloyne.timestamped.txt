[17:06] hi okay
[17:08] sorry um let's turn to uh Ephesians
[17:11] chapter
[17:14] 6 and we're going to start reading from
[17:17] verse uh 11
[17:27] here says here
[17:30] maybe we'll start from verse 10 says
[17:32] finally my brethren be strong in the
[17:34] Lord in the power of His might put on
[17:36] the whole armor of God that you may be
[17:38] able to stand against the Ws of the
[17:39] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[17:42] and blood but against principalities
[17:44] against Powers against the rulers of the
[17:46] darkness of this world against spiritual
[17:48] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[17:51] unto you the whole armor of God that ye
[17:53] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[17:55] and having done all to stand stand
[17:57] therefore having your learn loins GT
[18:00] about with truth and having on the
[18:02] breastplate of righteousness and your
[18:03] feet shod with the preparation of the
[18:05] gospel of peace above all taking the
[18:07] shield of Faith wherein you shall be
[18:09] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[18:11] the wicked and take the helmet of
[18:13] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[18:15] which is the word of God praying always
[18:17] with all prayer and supplication in the
[18:19] spirit and watching there unto with all
[18:22] perseverance and supplication for All
[18:25] Saints amen let's bow heads in a word of
[18:28] prayer tonight
[18:29] almighty God truly Lord Jesus We Want To
[18:33] Praise You Lord give you praise du unto
[18:34] your name thank you we could gather this
[18:37] night here we thank you that we could
[18:39] read your word together and Lord we know
[18:41] as anyone can read it but it takes you
[18:43] the Great Divine author to step in Lord
[18:45] anoint your word not just to speaker but
[18:47] to hear us so may you anoint all of us
[18:49] father as we uh Lord sit at your table
[18:52] tonight may you feed us from that hidden
[18:53] manner of your word and may you Lord
[18:55] Jesus be with everyone who's streaming
[18:57] tonight as well we thank you father for
[18:59] this Grand opportunity we love you Lord
[19:01] we ask your blood would cover us and may
[19:02] you have preeminence in our lives For
[19:04] Your Glory take control now Lord in
[19:06] Jesus Christ's name amen amen friends
[19:09] you can you can have your seats tonight
[19:11] so I want to um I want to talk about now
[19:16] I'm probably going to start I know I've
[19:17] said this before but I want to go into a
[19:19] series if I may we'll see how this goes
[19:21] but I want to talk about the effect of
[19:24] spirits upon ourselves and the and
[19:26] Spirits upon one another upon on our
[19:29] families different things and
[19:30] particularly jealousy pride and
[19:32] unthankfulness so I'm going to maybe lay
[19:34] a bit of a foundation tonight and you
[19:36] see how we go and just want to speak
[19:38] about how they affect the individual the
[19:39] family and those that they are targeted
[19:42] against now we read in the scripture
[19:44] that we need to put on the whole armor
[19:46] of God right we we are standing in the
[19:48] evil day that we the Apostle Paul when
[19:50] he prophesied when he was writing this
[19:52] to the Ephesians he was he was inspired
[19:55] to write this but uh to them but to me
[19:57] it's to us in this day because this is a
[19:59] very evil day that we live in right so
[20:02] um as we read I just want to keep your
[20:04] attention to to verse 16 how it says
[20:07] above all taking the shield of Faith
[20:09] wherein you may be able to quench all
[20:11] the fiery darts of the wicked so uh as
[20:14] we read there it said take the helmet
[20:15] take the breastplate take all these
[20:16] things but then when the Apostle Paul
[20:18] comes down he's inspired to speak about
[20:20] the shield of Faith he says above all
[20:23] take that Shield of Faith because the
[20:25] shield of Faith or the shield if you
[20:26] look at that armor is the only thing
[20:28] that the actually the bearer either
[20:30] raises or lowers it's up to the
[20:33] individual how they use this right so we
[20:36] got so I want to speak about what the
[20:38] shield of faith is what the fiery darts
[20:41] of the enemy are which ties into spirits
[20:43] and then also how to quench every fiery
[20:46] Dart of the wicked because he said here
[20:48] that ye shall be able to quench all the
[20:51] fiery darts of the wicked okay so this
[20:53] is where we're just going to go a bit of
[20:55] a Sunday school lesson tonight because
[20:57] you know there's a lot of Spirits
[20:59] running rampant in this day but we have
[21:01] the power by the whole armor of God
[21:03] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:05] to quench all of them right they can't
[21:08] hit us so we can block them all okay
[21:11] doesn't mean we won't feel them but we
[21:13] well well okay let's just have the
[21:15] sermon then go home in two seconds right
[21:17] a thought will
[21:18] come a spirit is trying to take dominion
[21:21] over you okay you can either agree with
[21:24] it and let it hit you or you can by
[21:27] Revelation withstand take take the
[21:29] revelation of the word and disagree with
[21:32] that thing and then you block it right
[21:34] it's like fear I mean I got it way down
[21:36] on my notes but just just so know where
[21:38] I'm going tonight you this is not a
[21:39] mystery tour okay the words come open
[21:41] everything's made real today right see
[21:43] so it's like when chrisy and I were
[21:45] living in freckleton Grove here there
[21:46] was that evil spirit uh in the house
[21:48] right fell a real oppression and we were
[21:50] fighting and all these things and but
[21:52] you know we knew there was a spirit that
[21:53] Christian even saw the form of it and
[21:55] everything and one night we were praying
[21:57] against it and I felt this real fear
[21:59] come upon me now that's a fiery Dart
[22:02] okay so I could I so I was feeling fear
[22:05] it was a real fear now I had a choice I
[22:07] could either raise my shield of Faith
[22:09] because what is that Revelation that God
[22:11] has not given us a spirit of fear but
[22:13] Power love and a sound mind that I have
[22:15] dominion over that thing because
[22:16] remember the blood of Jesus Christ has
[22:17] loosed Adam's Fallen race to restore us
[22:20] back to dominion over every Spirit right
[22:23] we have dominion over every fiery doubt
[22:25] of the enemy so I could either accept
[22:27] that fear and let it rule me and say oh
[22:29] no you this is terrible this is scary
[22:32] this a you know I can't withstand this
[22:34] thing or I could of which I did rebuke
[22:37] that thing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:38] Christ and what quench that fiery D amen
[22:42] so so okay when you go home you're
[22:44] dismissed okay but that's basically what
[22:46] I'm going to it's very simple because
[22:48] the gospel is simple right but we just
[22:49] want to go into these things now we know
[22:51] that human uh uh that humans Are
[22:54] Spiritual Beings we're more we're more
[22:56] spiritual than I think we even realize
[22:58] and that's irrespective of a Believer or
[23:00] not we're all Spiritual Beings now the
[23:03] spirits we carry affect not just
[23:05] ourselves but also our family our
[23:08] workmates the colleagues classmates
[23:09] whoever is the spirit we carry affects
[23:11] people it either will will bring pain
[23:14] and hurt or it will bring love and joy
[23:16] and Reconciliation right so we got to be
[23:18] very careful that we when we realize
[23:20] when when a when a spirit is attacking
[23:23] you're dominating us it's hurting not
[23:25] just you but other people around us now
[23:28] and and so what happens is because
[23:30] spirits that people carry they want to
[23:32] dominate they want to project their
[23:34] influence onto others and we can see
[23:36] that in the political world there's a we
[23:38] know there's an election going on right
[23:39] now in America they're counting up the
[23:41] votes and we know whoever gets in red or
[23:43] blue God is allowed
[23:45] it amen God's plan will be fulfilled so
[23:48] don't get upset or if it's if it's Trump
[23:52] or Harris hey praise God whatever he
[23:54] wants he's going to get it in there but
[23:56] you see there but it's political you
[23:58] know it's it's spirit's projecting and
[24:01] you can see people who have strong
[24:02] personalities is actually that their
[24:04] human Spirit wanting to dominate
[24:07] others all right are you following me so
[24:09] far I hope this is okay so now like
[24:12] brother brah he'd be in a prayer line
[24:14] and and and he'd have someone come in
[24:15] front of um him I'll just read this
[24:17] shall I he says now you're conscious
[24:19] you're in the presence of something
[24:21] besides your brother a feeling of
[24:22] knowing that there's something near you
[24:24] you're a Christian I see you're a
[24:26] Christian it's turning real light around
[24:28] you that means that your spirit is
[24:30] welcoming me you're not a Critic you're
[24:33] here you you've come for help I don't
[24:36] know you but something is near you and
[24:38] that very thing you feel that real sweet
[24:40] humble like spirit is that true raise
[24:42] your hand to your friends if that's true
[24:44] can't you see that people between me and
[24:46] the woman that light moving whipping
[24:48] around that's the Holy Spirit see you
[24:50] don't see it perhaps yourself but your
[24:51] spirit lets you know that it's there now
[24:54] that's the thing that heals you not me
[24:56] it's your faith in him but you've to be
[24:58] pray prayed for and I don't know what
[25:00] your trouble is but he can tell me see
[25:02] and then he goes down how she's nervous
[25:04] she's got kidney trouble and all these
[25:05] different things but the point of it is
[25:07] that that she had a welcoming spirit and
[25:10] brother R would say in another place is
[25:12] a different message uh what is what here
[25:14] is there Elijah says the the woman is a
[25:16] Christian because from her comes a real
[25:19] a feeling of friendship her spirit
[25:21] that's in her is welcoming the spirit
[25:23] that's in me so now I doubt very much
[25:26] that these two sisters when they got up
[25:27] and they going to go to the meeting that
[25:29] they're going to that they woke up
[25:30] saying I'm going to be welcoming today
[25:32] you know that that they didn't
[25:34] consciously say I'm going to have a
[25:35] welcoming Spirit I'm going to you know
[25:37] but it was an atmosphere it was a life
[25:39] within them that made a welcoming
[25:41] atmosphere around them that when they
[25:43] stood before the prophet there wasn't a
[25:45] resistance there wasn't something
[25:46] pushing back against the Lord in him but
[25:49] there was a welcoming there was a
[25:50] drawing power going on Amen so like you
[25:53] can e so it's the atmosphere that They
[25:55] carried by the anointing within them
[25:57] caused that atmosph ere to to come out
[25:59] of them why because we're all Spiritual
[26:01] Beings what the atmosphere that we carry
[26:03] influences everyone around us you even
[26:06] like you take brother kin or brother ID
[26:08] you know I doubt very much I haven't
[26:09] asked brother ID about this but I doubt
[26:11] very much before they come to church
[26:13] that they look in the mirror saying be
[26:15] welcoming be welcoming to everyone you
[26:17] know shake their hand with a real love
[26:18] or a hug to the brothers you know no
[26:20] it's the atmosphere they carry just
[26:22] projects that now that's not shouldn't
[26:26] shock anyone you see but you see it's
[26:29] the anointing that makes gives that
[26:31] welcoming presence you know brother Bram
[26:34] would say that you know he says and
[26:35] people here tonight he says God is
[26:37] depending on you to project his love to
[26:39] The Sinner there's something about a man
[26:41] or a woman you're a miniature Creator
[26:43] have you ever seen people that you love
[26:45] to be
[26:46] around it's the see have you um it's the
[26:49] atmosphere they carry around them others
[26:51] nice people they but you just can't
[26:53] stand to be around them they create they
[26:55] create that by the way they live and the
[26:58] way they think it's the little
[26:59] atmosphere you live in so people create
[27:02] an atmosphere around them by the spirit
[27:04] that they're projecting and brother R
[27:06] says it's by the way they live and the
[27:08] way they think because what are thoughts
[27:09] thoughts are are
[27:11] inspiration right either from Satan or
[27:14] from God that's what thoughts are it
[27:15] depends what you agree with have you
[27:17] ever been some you know been around
[27:18] someone who's always negative always
[27:21] down never looks the glass is not even
[27:23] half full it's just empty there's a hole
[27:24] in it it's just draining out
[27:25] everything's wrong nothing goes right
[27:27] what that there's an atmosphere being
[27:29] projected from them I mean they may not
[27:32] ever say anything but you know they're
[27:34] under a
[27:35] thundercloud right why because there an
[27:37] atmosphere that's being projected from
[27:39] them and it wants to take influence Over
[27:42] You So by the so that's why we should
[27:44] always think positive we should always
[27:47] think positive if God is for me who can
[27:49] be against me no weapon formed against
[27:51] me shall prosper amen I Am Redeemed by
[27:53] the blood of Jesus Christ I am his child
[27:55] amen he has my best interest in mind
[27:58] amen I cannot lose because he's ordained
[28:00] I'm going to win amen you say well how
[28:02] you going to get out of this trial I
[28:03] don't know but he led me in it he's
[28:05] going to lead me through it I'm going to
[28:06] come out the other side packing the
[28:07] victory because he's my God you see you
[28:10] create that kind of atmosphere around
[28:11] you it's an atmosphere of faith it
[28:13] doesn't weaken Faith No it builds Faith
[28:16] amen but you see you see the worst thing
[28:18] brother Braham says here um he says the
[28:20] most horriblest thing is to see a man or
[28:23] a woman that's constantly complaining
[28:26] I've always thought God keep me from
[28:28] from that see that weakens Faith all the
[28:31] time we never want to get into that
[28:33] condition someone who's constantly
[28:36] complaining you see even he says this I
[28:39] always thought God keep me from it
[28:40] weakens Faith all the time you know I
[28:41] know as you get older each one of us
[28:43] we're going to uh we're going to get
[28:45] something happen and something happen
[28:47] and know those little things are going
[28:48] to keep accumulating that as you get
[28:50] older they just got to what is that
[28:52] experiences of life but they'll either
[28:54] make you better or bitter your choice
[28:57] your choice see two people can be in the
[28:59] same conditions raised in the same home
[29:01] go through the exactly the same things
[29:03] and one can be rejoicing happy praising
[29:05] God and the other one can be negative
[29:07] bitter against what happened they they
[29:08] experienced the same things right but
[29:10] one chose to say no God allowed that I
[29:13] saw God's hand in that God's always been
[29:15] with me the other one's like well where
[29:16] was God if he's real he should have been
[29:18] there and he was there the whole time
[29:20] you see so we should never we should
[29:21] never be complaining it weakens Faith
[29:25] right so and I'm not saying we're a
[29:27] bunch of complainers but you to see
[29:28] there's power in the atmosphere we
[29:31] project and we should never let those
[29:34] kind of atmospheres rule us we need to
[29:35] discern it and withstand it right if
[29:38] someone is always nagging and constantly
[29:40] complaining and down you realize it's
[29:42] not them it's the atmosphere they carry
[29:45] right if you could strip that away
[29:46] they'd be rejoicing you see so you got
[29:49] to you can't let those darts hit you now
[29:53] he says he says but I think one of the
[29:55] most horriblest things is for Satan to
[29:57] Crown some person's life a crabbit old
[29:59] man or an old woman you see I hope I
[30:01] don't get to that place I hope that I
[30:03] can bear up my burdens and get to a spot
[30:05] where I want my life to be crowned with
[30:06] the glory of God his longsuffering
[30:09] gentleness peace meekness and filled
[30:11] with the Holy Ghost amen you see so
[30:14] complaining is actually what is that
[30:16] it's actually unbelief because it
[30:17] weakens Faith that's that's an
[30:19] atmosphere of unbelief that that comes
[30:21] out of a person they're not even
[30:22] necessarily conscious that they have it
[30:24] they can be a believer they can be
[30:26] baptized right away they can you know a
[30:28] message believer but they can be such an
[30:29] atmosphere of unbelief permeating
[30:31] permeating from them and they but they
[30:34] think they're actually fine they think
[30:36] well I'm just being Discerning or I'm
[30:37] just you I can justify my actions no we
[30:40] can't
[30:41] complain Jesus went to hell for
[30:44] us our names are written on the Lamb's
[30:47] Book of Life nothing can take our names
[30:49] off his book amen God has restored his
[30:52] truth to us am mean God has done all
[30:55] things for us what do we got to complain
[30:57] about I've got eternal life that's end
[31:00] of complaints bad day good day who cares
[31:03] I know where I'm going really what does
[31:04] it matter you see so even even when you
[31:08] look at the word complaining it comes
[31:09] from the word murmuring where the
[31:11] children of
[31:13] Israel see it says in uh Exodus 16 we
[31:16] know that they murmured a lot they you
[31:17] know they became very used to murmuring
[31:20] and the whole Congregation of Israel
[31:21] murmured against Moses and Aaron in the
[31:23] wilderness now this murmuring would not
[31:26] have just started
[31:28] like like one hand it was never
[31:30] murmuring and then next minute
[31:32] everyone's murmuring it would have
[31:34] started from
[31:35] individuals maybe ones of influence
[31:38] because I doubt they murmuring when they
[31:40] walked out of Egypt under the blood of
[31:42] the Lamb I doubt they were murmuring
[31:44] when they crossed the Red Sea they sure
[31:46] were they they sure were not murmuring
[31:48] when they dancing on the other side of
[31:49] the Red Sea and their enemy was dead in
[31:51] the Red Sea right that there was no
[31:53] murmuring there but it started by
[31:55] individuals what happens is like brother
[31:57] Bram says you're big sweet group now but
[32:00] Satan won't let you stay this way he
[32:02] says he'll put someone among you and
[32:04] he'll use that person to to to to shoot
[32:06] poison into the rest of the group he
[32:08] says now don't take sides with it right
[32:11] what is that that's fiery darts of the
[32:13] enemy begin to be shot among Believers
[32:16] now we have a choice just like so so so
[32:18] the murmuring begin to spread and the
[32:20] reason that it hit everyone is because
[32:22] they did not raise their Shield of Faith
[32:24] Joshua and Caleb did Joshua and Caleb
[32:27] did amen because their Shield of Faith
[32:29] now Faith is a revelation right so they
[32:32] had a revelation I have a home Over
[32:33] Yonder over Jordan I've got a mountain
[32:36] I've got a place I've got an inheritance
[32:38] God have you seen it yet no but it's
[32:40] there why because the god that gave the
[32:42] promise is the god who's come down to
[32:44] fulfill that promise and he's carrying
[32:46] me there amen so they had a revelation
[32:48] so they would have felt the complaints
[32:50] hey they they're in the same desert they
[32:53] were thirsty they drank the same bitter
[32:56] Waters of Mara they went through all the
[32:58] same hardship the sand blew into the
[33:00] camp all the th all the trouble they had
[33:02] all those same things affect them but
[33:05] yet they did not let that murmuring
[33:06] Spirit come upon
[33:08] them amen the feelings were all the same
[33:11] the problems were all the same the sand
[33:12] was sure all the same you see but they
[33:15] raised up that Shield of faith that
[33:16] Revelation I'm going to the promised
[33:18] land and they did not let that fiery
[33:21] Dart hit
[33:23] them amen so so we must stop agreeing
[33:27] with the five cent
[33:28] our five senses are actually your
[33:30] enemy right it's your enemy because your
[33:33] five senses are not made to contact God
[33:35] they made to contact this world right
[33:37] faith is made to contact God Amen so we
[33:40] got to stop agreeing with what our five
[33:42] senses declare and start agreeing with
[33:44] the word of God Amen and this word
[33:48] murmured here it actually means to stop
[33:50] it means to Lodge this is in the this is
[33:52] in the Hebrew you it means to stop it
[33:54] means to Grumble complain to you know
[33:57] you know to to murmur so this murmuring
[34:00] caused them to stop in their
[34:02] walk we should always be positive if you
[34:05] want to move forward be positive in God
[34:08] Amen quote him at his word take him at
[34:10] his word don't don't complain about the
[34:12] situation don't stop keep moving forward
[34:15] amen so we shouldn't we shouldn't murmur
[34:19] and complain don't let that Spirit come
[34:21] like it did there
[34:23] and uh hit you now remember if if you've
[34:27] been hit by a firey Dart there's a bom
[34:29] and Gilead we have the best first aid we
[34:32] got the best emergency hospital we got
[34:33] the best specialist the great physician
[34:35] not just a physician the great physician
[34:37] now is here the sympathizing Jesus right
[34:39] so you say look I look like a porcupine
[34:42] I've been hit by so many darts that's
[34:43] fine God can heal them right God can
[34:46] heal them so just because one gets
[34:48] through doesn't mean you're done no we
[34:50] ain't toast we're getting up we're
[34:51] walking
[34:52] on Amen so you see you can either have a
[34:55] welcoming Spirit or you can have a
[34:57] unwelcoming Spirit now Jesus when he
[35:00] went to Nazareth he went to his own
[35:01] country it's says here in Matthew 13 and
[35:04] you know he taught them in their
[35:05] synagogue in so much that they are
[35:07] astonished and said whence hath this man
[35:09] this wisdom and these Mighty works is
[35:11] not this The Carpenter's son is not his
[35:14] mother called Mary and his Brethren
[35:15] James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and
[35:18] his sisters are they not with us whence
[35:20] then hath this man all these things so
[35:22] basically we know his family we know
[35:25] what he like when he was a little boy
[35:26] we've seen where he was raised how did
[35:28] he get all these
[35:30] things this and they were offended in
[35:33] him but Jesus said unto them a prophet
[35:35] is not without honor save in his own
[35:37] country and in his own house and he did
[35:40] not many mighty works there because of
[35:42] their unbelief so they didn't have a
[35:44] welcoming Spirit they had an unwelcoming
[35:46] spirit because that spirit will try and
[35:49] keep everything down will try and stop
[35:51] the spirit of God moving it'll try and
[35:53] keep joy out of the camp it'll take
[35:55] Victory away that's what an unwelcoming
[35:57] Spirit does but a welcoming Spirit does
[36:00] the opposite it brings the joy of God
[36:01] down it brings Victory into the camp
[36:03] amen it gives overcoming power
[36:05] Hallelujah you feel like everything's
[36:07] fine we're just going to sail right
[36:08] through this thing amen why because
[36:11] you're welcoming the Lord like brother
[36:13] Bram said if you want to see deity in
[36:15] your midst welcome and receive the word
[36:18] that's why he said if you want to see
[36:19] deity Jesus Christ himself in your midst
[36:22] then welcome and receive his word have a
[36:24] welcoming Spirit to his word it may it
[36:27] may that may thrash you tear you tear
[36:29] your hide off your back you say I
[36:30] welcome you Lord amen amen praise the
[36:34] Lord
[36:35] amen it it would even say when Jesus was
[36:39] standing in front of standing in front
[36:41] of um pilate I'm just giving you a few
[36:43] illustrations before we kind of break
[36:44] this down here you know Jesus was
[36:46] standing in front of pilate and um it
[36:49] says in Matthew 27 he said therefore
[36:52] when they were gathered gathered
[36:54] together pilot said unto them whom will
[36:56] will ye that I release unto you barabus
[36:59] or Jesus called Christ for he knew that
[37:02] for Envy which is jealousy they
[37:03] delivered him so they be they were
[37:06] jealous isn't this crazy but but this is
[37:08] this is what this is what these you know
[37:11] jealousy and and these things do it
[37:14] makes people reject the very Messiah
[37:15] that was sent to them you think they
[37:18] were je now to me this sounds crazy
[37:20] their King they were jealous of their
[37:22] own King think about it they were
[37:25] jealous of the one who who could come
[37:27] the only one who could come and redeem
[37:29] them to wash them of their sins the all
[37:32] the promises of the Old Testament that
[37:34] no doubt they sat around they learned
[37:35] they memorized they debated they
[37:37] discussed they knew all the prophecies
[37:39] concerning him but yet when he came when
[37:41] those prophecies became flesh they
[37:43] became jealous of the thing and they
[37:44] would rather have barabus a murderer but
[37:48] basically a jealous spirit will take
[37:50] anything just to destroy the truth
[37:52] doesn't matter how ridiculous it is how
[37:54] crazy it is they would rather they would
[37:57] rather take anything as long as it's not
[38:00] Jesus as long as he dies as long as the
[38:03] person that they're jealous against dies
[38:05] and and and we know it's not just to
[38:07] kill someone is not just to physically
[38:09] kill them you can kill their influence
[38:11] you can murder their influence that's
[38:13] that's the same as stabbing someone in
[38:14] the back brother Braham says right you
[38:16] see so a jealous person would rather no
[38:18] one gets anything than anyone get
[38:22] something now there was a case when King
[38:26] Solomon uh had before him of two women
[38:28] came before him they both had children
[38:30] one had died in the night and they were
[38:33] debating uh who was uh who was the
[38:35] mother of the living child now I'm sure
[38:37] you know the story well you know then so
[38:39] there they come before King Solomon they
[38:41] both give their testimony and then King
[38:43] Solomon says okay bring me a sword so
[38:46] God brings him a sword he says okay what
[38:48] we'll do because we can't come to an
[38:50] agreement whose baby is whose so I'm
[38:52] going to cut the baby in half and you
[38:54] can each have half so the one the one
[38:57] who was
[38:59] jealous would rather the baby be dead
[39:02] because she was jealous why did my child
[39:05] die this is not fair this is a this is
[39:07] not just we both had children in the
[39:09] same house why did mine have to die it's
[39:11] because she was jealous she wasn't happy
[39:13] sure she would have been heartbroken her
[39:15] baby died but could she not be happy at
[39:17] least the other woman's got a child you
[39:19] see so she would rather she would rather
[39:21] the baby be dead that the both babies
[39:24] are dead then then then there be one
[39:26] living child
[39:27] so we know that the one who who who um
[39:31] you know lost the baby so the baby that
[39:33] was dead she was not the mother of the
[39:35] baby that was there that's how Solomon
[39:37] because the one who um you know the one
[39:39] who had the baby that didn't die she
[39:41] said look just give her to the other
[39:42] woman because she wasn't jealous she
[39:44] look as long as life is preserved I'm
[39:47] willing to suffer great loss it's a son
[39:49] here this is a b there a child there a
[39:50] big deal I'd rather suffer this loss
[39:53] than than than we you know all the
[39:55] babies are dead
[39:58] you say well jealousy is an insane thing
[40:00] it's a
[40:01] spirit it's a real spirit so in Papa New
[40:05] Guinea it's probably the most jealous
[40:07] country I've ever seen in my life we
[40:09] know people I know people where they
[40:11] where they said to the Village they said
[40:12] look we're going to have a we're going
[40:14] to start a pig farm pigs are a big deal
[40:16] over there it's like currency you know
[40:18] it's a big deal he said we're going to
[40:19] start a pig farm and the whole village
[40:22] is going to benefit from this pig farm
[40:24] do you think do you think the family
[40:26] members and and now their Villages are
[40:27] all family right do you think the other
[40:31] parts of the village were happy that
[40:32] that that one of their own was going to
[40:35] make this pig farm that they're all
[40:36] going to benefit from no one night they
[40:39] burnt down the pig farm killed all the
[40:40] pigs people in his own village cuz they
[40:44] were jealous of of what their family
[40:46] member was doing but yet it was going to
[40:49] it was benefiting them but you see
[40:51] that's what jealousy does it would
[40:52] rather see everything in smok and Ashes
[40:54] than one person benefit
[40:58] and we're going to go into this and and
[40:59] and um further maybe Sunday we'll see
[41:02] but you see jealousy jealousy came comes
[41:04] from
[41:05] Satan it come it comes directly straight
[41:08] out of Satan he says now brother says in
[41:10] the mark of the beast and the Seal of
[41:12] God now we find out that because Cain
[41:14] listened to the enemy then what happened
[41:16] he became the first murderer he became
[41:18] the first one that had Jealousy on the
[41:20] earth tell me we in that Pure Line of
[41:22] God to Adam that's the only connection
[41:24] Adam was the Son of God the Bible said
[41:26] so then where did that Y come from where
[41:28] did that murderer come from where did
[41:30] all that kind of a Spirit come from out
[41:31] of Adam couldn't have came from Satan
[41:34] it's exactly where it come from now we
[41:36] find out he was the first murderer he
[41:38] was the first one to have jealousy as
[41:40] Lucifer got jealous of Michael brought
[41:42] it right down to earth and transferred
[41:44] it into man so you got to realize that
[41:46] atmospheres bad atmospheres that people
[41:48] carry they come from Satan they come
[41:50] from hell it's not a bad day it's not a
[41:52] oh I'm just feeling a no no bad
[41:54] atmospheres are not God sent
[41:58] amen and it's not our inheritance to
[42:00] carry a bad atmosphere jealousy you know
[42:03] you know um unthankfulness Pride
[42:05] whatever it is those things do not
[42:07] belong to any man woman or
[42:10] child but you see demons they've always
[42:13] wanted to
[42:14] dominate they've always wanted to
[42:16] dominate Satan and his demons have
[42:17] always wanted to dominate humanity and
[42:20] be worshiped as God so they want to rule
[42:22] the lives of people and cause them to
[42:24] surrender or bow down or let themselves
[42:26] be governed by them you got to realize
[42:28] there's a lot of churches walking around
[42:31] today people that worship Spirits they
[42:35] bow down they give obstinance they let
[42:37] that thing rule their lives the only
[42:39] Spirit that's to govern us is the Holy
[42:41] Ghost
[42:42] himself amen it's not jealousy it's not
[42:45] some something mind battles or some
[42:48] conflix something we're not ordained to
[42:49] carry those things we're not ordain to
[42:51] let those things rule us we're called to
[42:53] rule them amen that we don't bow down to
[42:56] them but they're under our feet that's
[42:57] where they belong to be amen that's
[42:59] where they should be but you see it's
[43:01] Spirits trying to project themselves
[43:03] onto others in order to rule I mean so
[43:07] for example you take a lust Spirit right
[43:10] what is that that Spirit wants to
[43:12] dominate right it wants to It Wants to
[43:14] Rule someone and that spirit will uh
[43:18] that is in a person will want to
[43:20] dominate someone else that's what it
[43:22] wants so what does it do it projects
[43:24] itself onto a potential victim right so
[43:27] so what happens now is the victim begins
[43:29] to get a Vibe that's difference between
[43:31] lust and liking so we understand but the
[43:33] devil always perverts what God has
[43:34] already given right attraction is God
[43:37] given lust is Hell given it's a
[43:40] perversion right but you see that lust
[43:43] Spirit tries to project itself on a
[43:45] potential victim by giving a Vibe so
[43:47] what is that that's a fiery doubt that's
[43:49] been fired at someone right see see
[43:52] quenching the fire darts the enemy we
[43:54] don't literally carry a shield around
[43:56] you don't literally see a with a bow and
[43:57] arrow pop out the bushes and say I'm
[43:59] going to get you no it comes out of
[44:01] other human
[44:03] beings right so now that Spirit projects
[44:06] itself now that victim has a
[44:08] choice they will feel that Vibe they'll
[44:11] feel that attraction now they can either
[44:14] agree with it and be hit by it or they
[44:18] can hold up their Shield of faith and
[44:20] say no this is not god-given I'm not
[44:23] going to emotionally be connected to
[44:24] this person right
[44:27] praise the
[44:28] Lord right so it's vital that we guard
[44:31] our hearts our emotions and we don't get
[44:33] emotionally entangled with someone when
[44:34] we're not cting or or not engaged right
[44:37] but you see those Spirits are rampant
[44:39] around the world yes I know this is
[44:41] nothing strange or new to anyone but you
[44:42] see the Apostle Paul told us we must
[44:45] above all pick up that pick up that
[44:47] Shield that Shield of of Faith now as I
[44:52] said in the very beginning I'm probably
[44:53] kind of coming around in a full circle
[44:55] right now but you see now that Shield is
[44:58] the only piece of armor that the bearer
[45:00] moves if you got the helmet on it's on
[45:03] you got the breastplate on it's on right
[45:05] you don't have to do anything you're
[45:07] wearing it right you good around the
[45:09] loins with truth it's on you your feet
[45:11] shod with the preparation your gospel of
[45:13] peace it's on right but the shield you
[45:16] either raise it or you lower it you got
[45:19] that choice see you know you see I don't
[45:21] know if you ever seen people who Reen
[45:22] medieval battles you know these people
[45:24] with firing arrows and stuff that you
[45:26] know you the foot or the knights they
[45:27] raise their Shields when they know
[45:29] arrows are coming right when arrows
[45:31] aren't coming they lower the shield when
[45:33] a sword's coming their way they raise
[45:35] their Shield up you know so so if
[45:37] someone if someone gets hit by an arrow
[45:40] because they got their shield down whose
[45:42] fault is the that's the person carrying
[45:45] the shield right there's nothing wrong
[45:47] with The Shield The Shield's perfectly
[45:49] fine it it's built to do what it does
[45:52] and it does what it's built to do right
[45:55] it works amen but if the Warrior puts it
[45:57] down and gets hit by an arrow it's not
[46:00] The Shield's fault it's the one bearing
[46:03] The Shield so we have a choice just like
[46:06] a just like a you know a soldier back in
[46:09] you know the Middle Ages or whenever you
[46:10] know back in even Jesus's day we have a
[46:13] choice whether to raise our Shield or to
[46:15] lower our Shield amen cuz just like in
[46:18] the natural the same thing happens in
[46:19] the Supernatural now we know that the
[46:21] whole armor of God is
[46:23] Supernatural right the whole armor of
[46:25] God is Supernatural the whole Armor of
[46:27] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:29] right it is the word of God made
[46:31] manifest that's what the armor of God is
[46:33] amen and every Christian that has the
[46:35] Holy Ghost is fully armored we're fully
[46:38] equipped for the battle we're fully
[46:40] equipped from from this day till the
[46:43] Rapture we're dressed to fight we're
[46:45] dressed to win amen we are dressed to
[46:48] overcome you don't need any more weapons
[46:50] he gave you the best weapons he gave you
[46:52] the best armor amen he gave you the best
[46:54] equipment that can ever be devised he's
[46:57] already given it to us amen so now the
[46:59] whole armor of God is Supernatural amen
[47:02] so how can people say they believe in a
[47:04] supernatural God and preach the gospel I
[47:07] mean you know but they say they don't
[47:08] believe in those things when the whole
[47:09] armor of God of full armor of
[47:11] Christianity is Supernatural he says
[47:13] what is the armor of Christianity love
[47:14] joy peace longsuffering goodness
[47:16] meekness gentleness Faith the holy
[47:18] spirit all these things are Supernatural
[47:20] what is love what is Joy go down to the
[47:22] drugstore buy me a quarter worth of it I
[47:24] need it right now see you can't buy love
[47:27] joy peace long suffering goodness
[47:28] patience Generous Faith you can't buy it
[47:30] it's supernatural and the whole armor of
[47:32] the Christian is Supernatural and we're
[47:34] bidden by the scriptures to put on the
[47:36] whole armor of God to be GED about the
[47:38] whole armor and we're equipped with it
[47:42] amen how's everyone tonight is everyone
[47:44] okay amen trust we're all good I I'm
[47:47] good okay we're all good praise the Lord
[47:49] so you say well how do you how do you
[47:52] how do you raise that Shield of Faith
[47:54] then well as I said in the very
[47:56] beginning what do you you agreeing with
[47:57] see you got to discern the thoughts and
[48:00] the feelings that come into your life
[48:03] see some people some people you know
[48:05] they've had such a feeling of offense
[48:06] against someone but yet they found out
[48:09] the truth of the matter is completely
[48:11] different to how they were feeling but
[48:13] when they were told the truth they say
[48:14] well the feeling was so real I'm going
[48:16] with the feeling that is a bad
[48:19] idea right we must always no matter how
[48:22] we feel if our feelings are contrary to
[48:24] the truth we discard our feelings we
[48:27] only we only agree with the five senses
[48:29] when the five senses agree with
[48:31] faith amen if it's contrary we put it
[48:35] aside if it's contrary to the word we
[48:37] put it all aside doesn't matter how we
[48:39] feel that's why we don't go by feeling
[48:41] see it's a fiery Dart the devil fires
[48:43] dart at you you're never going to
[48:45] overcome this thing's always going to
[48:46] plague you you're always going to have
[48:48] this problem now you can either raise
[48:50] that Shield of faith faith is a
[48:52] revelation see even the Revelation Jesus
[48:54] died for you that's a great Shield
[48:57] amen that the blood of Jesus Christ was
[48:58] shed for your soul amen and it's going
[49:00] to pack you to Glory that's a perfect
[49:02] Shield to raise up amen because he died
[49:05] for you because you're his child amen he
[49:07] cares for you with an unfailing love
[49:09] amen you are his and nothing can pluck
[49:11] you out of his hand amen cuz why God is
[49:14] jealous over his church amen you know we
[49:17] talk about Mama beers what about Papa
[49:18] beer a what about Papa Bear he's far
[49:21] more frightening than mama bear I mean
[49:23] cuz Papa Bear ceded the sun moon and
[49:24] stars and everything here amen and he's
[49:26] defeated the devil that down Calvary and
[49:29] if when the devil is turned tries to
[49:30] come against you he's got Jesus Christ
[49:33] on his hands hallelujah thank you Lord
[49:36] amen so now so always you see you got to
[49:39] think now what do you agree with if you
[49:43] agree with that thought youve put your
[49:44] shield down if you raise that shield and
[49:47] say no I'm not bowing to this you've
[49:50] raised your shield and your Shield will
[49:53] quench that fiery Dart amen see it's the
[49:56] revelation of the word is your Shield we
[50:00] must always agree with the word you may
[50:02] say well I don't know the scripture very
[50:04] well you don't have to quote scripture
[50:06] and verse
[50:07] perfectly amen as I said just it's just
[50:10] enough to realize Jesus Paid It All amen
[50:14] you're his child amen his blood is more
[50:17] than
[50:18] enough
[50:20] amen so for
[50:23] example someone is jealous we've all
[50:26] come across jealous
[50:28] people it's an atmosphere they carry I
[50:31] talked about those guys in Papa New
[50:32] Guinea They Carried an atmosphere very
[50:34] jealous T poppy syndrome here is child's
[50:36] PL caned there as I said right because
[50:39] it's a very jealous place and so
[50:42] jealousy is all over the world because
[50:45] what was in Satan is now upon the Earth
[50:48] right so someone who's jealous what
[50:51] happens it actually projects a force
[50:54] just like a welcoming Spirit what is
[50:55] that that's a love of God being
[50:57] projected right it's actually a force
[50:59] that comes out of people see that's why
[51:02] brother said I feel a welcoming Spirits
[51:04] there's a weling spirit in that person
[51:06] that was being projected to the prophet
[51:08] right like we read earlier in that quote
[51:10] God is relying on you to project his
[51:13] love to The Sinner right so there's a so
[51:16] the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that
[51:17] the believer carries has a force in it
[51:20] right it's not just some vacant nice
[51:22] idea but there's a power in it amen and
[51:25] and so the holy ghost has a supreme
[51:27] power so so evil spirits have power and
[51:32] jealousy is one that that that certainly
[51:34] has a power and it will fire a fiery
[51:37] Dart against you what does it try and
[51:40] make you feel guilty of what you have
[51:44] that's a fiery Dart of
[51:47] jealousy it can be it can be guilty over
[51:49] the car you drive anything cuz jealousy
[51:52] Compares and if it's not the same as you
[51:55] then it becomes angry and of wanting to
[51:57] destroy you trying to rob the joy of
[51:59] what you have you got a great family
[52:02] someone who's jealous will be angry at
[52:04] you you'll feel it from them it'll try
[52:06] and drag you down that you can't enjoy
[52:09] what God has given we just got to get it
[52:11] straight we all have a different Journey
[52:13] we all have a different allotment in
[52:15] life and God doesn't have have
[52:18] favorites God don't have a favorite
[52:21] child we are all the
[52:23] same you know I can say I have a
[52:25] favorite son because I've got
[52:27] one it's a it's very easy and I've got
[52:31] my favorite analy my favorite Lilia my
[52:33] favorite
[52:34] Gabriella what about my favorite
[52:36] daughter I don't have one I got a
[52:37] favorite analy a favorite Lily or a
[52:39] favorite
[52:39] Gabriela I got a favorite son though
[52:41] because I've got one of them you see but
[52:43] with God he's got many sons and
[52:45] daughters but we're all on the same
[52:46] level with him he don't have favorites
[52:49] right but jealousy is a fallen because
[52:52] it's a fallen angel it wants you to
[52:55] compare one to another and be angry and
[52:59] resentful of someone appears to be doing
[53:01] better than you if you're under the
[53:03] blood of Jesus Christ can I just can I
[53:05] just tell you a little secret if you
[53:07] know him you've won the game of
[53:09] Life You've Won You've Won okay honestly
[53:13] You've
[53:14] Won like brother BR said he could go
[53:16] hunting and fishing for every day for
[53:18] the rest of his life wouldn't wouldn't
[53:20] harm a Salvation
[53:21] none okay so if you really know him
[53:24] You've Won amen praise God okay you've
[53:28] won it's done you can just enjoy life
[53:30] just just go rejoice and walk in walk in
[53:33] his goodness walk in his word enjoy him
[53:35] until he takes you
[53:36] home good days bad days whatever days
[53:39] walk with him in those things see but
[53:41] jealousy will try and make you feel
[53:44] guilty and what is that that now that
[53:47] jealous spirit is trying to is not
[53:48] trying to make you jealous it's trying
[53:50] to make you feel guilty of what that
[53:53] spirit is jealous over okay so so so
[53:56] that that is it trying to have dominion
[53:59] trying to rule
[54:00] you you'll feel guilty you you actually
[54:04] feel the feeling right just because you
[54:06] feel the feeling doesn't mean it's that
[54:08] that D has hit you okay because it's
[54:11] always you know it's like the um
[54:12] Israelis with their Iron Dome and stuff
[54:14] right Hamas or whoever fires a rocket
[54:17] okay the fire dart's coming the senses
[54:20] and the radar and everything in the
[54:21] Israeli side will sense it that it's
[54:23] there right and they know it's really
[54:25] there it hasn't hit them yet this thing
[54:28] is going to detect this thing and it's
[54:30] going to fire a proper counter measure
[54:32] and it's going to blow up okay so the
[54:34] same thing jealousy is projected against
[54:37] you you feel guilty for whatever thing
[54:39] or you know there's Pride or anything
[54:41] tries to come and Rule your life from
[54:42] someone now that's like the Iron Dome
[54:45] detecting an enemy missile right now
[54:48] what are you going to see see sometimes
[54:50] we think oh I feel bad I feel guilty
[54:51] something must be wrong with me no you
[54:54] actually your your radar system of the
[54:56] whole Holy Ghost has detected incoming
[54:57] fiery darts right so now what you need
[55:00] to do is you like if you agree with that
[55:03] thing well yes I I guess I shouldn't be
[55:06] happy I have this I guess you know I
[55:08] should because because you know it's
[55:10] more spiritual to be you know lonely and
[55:12] you know Meek and you know not to get
[55:14] happy you know no but that's what a
[55:18] spirit wants to dominate it doesn't want
[55:20] you to be happy any spirit that doesn't
[55:23] want you to be happy is not the Holy
[55:24] Ghost brother I said God wants us to be
[55:27] happy he wants us to be at peace he
[55:29] wants us to enjoy life not talking about
[55:33] going to the world but like we got life
[55:35] more abundantly yes sir right so so
[55:37] these things want to want to want to
[55:39] make us feel that you know sorry for
[55:41] ourselves that we have what we have I
[55:44] don't feel sorry for what I have I've
[55:46] got eternal life I do not feel sorry I
[55:48] have eternal
[55:49] life not for a second I'm just happy GL
[55:52] amen but you see jealousy will try and
[55:55] make you feel guilty for whatever God
[55:56] has given you that's why I said if God
[55:58] made everyone a
[56:00] billionaire and in here and no one
[56:02] shared nothing with me I'd be happy for
[56:05] you amen if God just gave you the best
[56:08] whatever whatever I'd be happy for you
[56:10] would you be jealous no I'd just be
[56:11] happy for you enjoy that praise God show
[56:15] me what it can
[56:16] do you got the best hyper car in
[56:18] existence can I just sit can I just look
[56:20] at it whatever you know I won't be jeal
[56:21] oh that's not fair no praise God praise
[56:24] God God moved in your home praise praise
[56:26] God Amen God filled your children with
[56:28] the Holy Ghost praise God Amen God
[56:30] healed you praise God Amen God gave you
[56:33] answers to prayer praise God I just be
[56:35] happy for those things you don't get
[56:37] jealous oh what about me no praise God
[56:40] Amen if you want God to move in your
[56:42] life be happy when he moves in someone
[56:43] else's
[56:44] life amen let's not be now I'm not
[56:47] saying you're jealous people you know
[56:48] but we got to be
[56:50] Discerning because these things when you
[56:53] know when Paul was writing these things
[56:55] it wasn't some some vague thing it's a
[56:58] reality so so you feel guilty now you
[57:01] can either raise up the shield of Faith
[57:04] right and by Revelation quench that
[57:07] fiery
[57:09] Dart amen or you can agree with it so
[57:13] what happens like so for example you
[57:15] there's an enemy rocket coming the
[57:16] Israeli radar says there there's a
[57:18] rocket if the radar agrees with the
[57:20] rocket the Rocket's going to hit right
[57:23] it's the same thing with you if you
[57:24] agree with that thing well yeah actually
[57:26] I should feel guilty I should feel bad
[57:29] that I have this that's agreeing with
[57:31] that spirit that that spirit will
[57:33] actually take dominion over you are you
[57:36] with me class you see so you got to
[57:38] discern and withstand the spirit see if
[57:40] people are jealous over you say well no
[57:43] you raise a shield of Revelation this is
[57:45] the walk God has given me if he if he's
[57:48] given me the best family praise God we
[57:50] all have the best families we all have
[57:52] the best spouses for us
[57:56] amen that it should have been a lot
[57:58] harder than
[58:00] that because we're all individuals in
[58:02] God God is not a cookie cutter the Lord
[58:05] amen you like brother Ram said you know
[58:07] he used to think before he went past a
[58:09] CT in a time that you know when we died
[58:10] we' sit up there on the on the clouds
[58:12] and all play Harps he said then the MU
[58:14] musicians would all have it over us but
[58:17] God is not a cookie cutter we all have
[58:20] different you say well why do I have to
[58:22] have this kind of a father why I have
[58:23] this kind of mother why this kind of
[58:25] whatever God God pre-planned your life
[58:28] because there's a certain expression
[58:30] that he wanted out of your life am mean
[58:32] we can't all Express sure we're all the
[58:33] bride of Christ but there's different
[58:35] things we go through because God wants
[58:37] to prove through his body that it
[58:38] doesn't matter where he puts us we'll
[58:40] come out
[58:42] Victorious amen so your testimony will
[58:45] not be my testimony my testimony will
[58:46] not be your testimony but not one
[58:48] testimony is greater than the
[58:50] other amen cuz because the conclusion of
[58:53] all will be Lord it was all you it
[58:55] wasn't me how rich poor smart dumb fat
[58:58] thin tall short whatever it wasn't any
[59:00] of those things that got me here you got
[59:02] me here by your grace
[59:05] hallelujah amen so friends never ever
[59:09] agree never feel
[59:11] guilty because God has given you
[59:13] something that's a spirit trying to beat
[59:16] you down you got to raise that Shield of
[59:19] Revelation and quench that
[59:23] Dart praise the Lord you say well then
[59:27] how do I you say I know where the
[59:30] missiles are coming
[59:32] from what do I do do I take the word and
[59:35] cut that person's head off do I give
[59:37] them a real balling out put them under a
[59:39] a lamp and sit them down and say you
[59:41] listen here you and is that what you
[59:44] do no remember love love conquers all
[59:49] love conquers all brother I makes a
[59:51] statement here in um the Great
[59:53] Commission
[59:56] he says now he says let me give you if I
[59:59] found Grace in your sight through God
[1:00:01] you take my words for this Brethren if
[1:00:04] you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:00:06] blessing who wants a blessing yes sir I
[1:00:09] I do I'll be honest I want a blessing
[1:00:10] bless me Lord I I don't mean that as a
[1:00:12] joke we all want to be blessed right we
[1:00:14] don't want to be job on the ash Heep
[1:00:16] okay sure we want as Revelation but you
[1:00:19] know we want to be blessed amen when a
[1:00:22] man has done you wrong see so so you've
[1:00:24] identified the jealousy is coming from
[1:00:27] brother sister so and so not here right
[1:00:29] now whatever you know okay because
[1:00:32] you'll realize this thing's coming from
[1:00:34] someone amen now now this doesn't mean
[1:00:37] we we're like the what gapo or the
[1:00:39] secret police we're kind of you know not
[1:00:41] trusting anyone and know but you'll
[1:00:43] realize along your journey where these
[1:00:45] darts are being fired from and you may
[1:00:48] have to hold the shield up a lot against
[1:00:50] the same
[1:00:51] darts right cuz we'll quench them all
[1:00:56] amen but remember there's strength in
[1:00:58] your arm to hold it up why cuz you just
[1:01:01] stay in love with the Lord with the
[1:01:02] Revelation he's poured into your soul
[1:01:05] that will quench that
[1:01:07] D amen so he says
[1:01:09] now okay uh when a man has done you
[1:01:12] wrong and he has absolutely justly I
[1:01:14] mean he has done you wrong and you know
[1:01:16] he's done you wrong and he's done you
[1:01:19] evil don't mention that you take him to
[1:01:22] prayer before God and don't take it in a
[1:01:25] way of just a selfish and say well I'm
[1:01:27] supposed to pray for that person but
[1:01:30] stand with your shoulder to his shoulder
[1:01:33] that doesn't mean physically look we
[1:01:34] need a prayer meeting but stand like
[1:01:36] you're praying next to him or next to
[1:01:38] her okay and stand in the presence of
[1:01:41] God our Father um way of prayer should
[1:01:45] be made in the presence of God say
[1:01:46] father here's my brother he is justly he
[1:01:49] deserves punishment because he's done me
[1:01:51] evil and I don't see why he did it then
[1:01:54] let God go to talk to you and you'll see
[1:01:57] maybe what that man's been through the
[1:02:00] devil has Twisted him up somewhere and
[1:02:01] caused him to do that though he's
[1:02:04] absolutely wrong before you leave the
[1:02:06] Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry
[1:02:09] for that
[1:02:10] man amen you'll be sympathizing with
[1:02:13] that brother and when you get back to
[1:02:16] here to Earth again you'll go over to
[1:02:18] that brother shake his hand because you
[1:02:20] know what he's been through you can't
[1:02:21] stand with a mortal in the presence of
[1:02:24] God and condemn anybody I don't believe
[1:02:26] no sir even if he's a rank Sinner and
[1:02:29] what about a brother that's made a
[1:02:30] mistake though I say he's wrong
[1:02:33] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:02:35] not wrong but if he is wrong well if you
[1:02:37] take him to the throne of God stand
[1:02:39] shoulder to- shoulder with our brother
[1:02:40] knowing he's Immortal and maybe his
[1:02:43] destination rests upon our attitude
[1:02:46] towards him Lord give me the best
[1:02:49] attitude towards everybody doesn't
[1:02:51] matter what they've done said thought
[1:02:53] fight at me whatever may I have the best
[1:02:55] attitud ude towards them because we have
[1:02:58] great power to bless or to curse the
[1:03:01] devil wants to use you to curse
[1:03:04] people cuz he knows the power you have
[1:03:06] there's power there's great there's
[1:03:08] great power in the tongue of the Bride
[1:03:09] of Jesus Christ amen so we got to always
[1:03:12] speak good about people well don't you
[1:03:16] know what they did to me and keep doing
[1:03:17] to me speak good about that
[1:03:21] person because someone's got to break
[1:03:23] the cycle you see someone's got to break
[1:03:26] the cycle where it's tit fortat this
[1:03:28] person did this I'll do this and I say
[1:03:30] this cuz I'm Justified someone's got to
[1:03:32] break it and we live in that season of
[1:03:35] the breaking of
[1:03:36] Cycles amen
[1:03:39] so we and maybe his destination rests
[1:03:42] upon our our attitude towards him and
[1:03:44] when we come back from the Throne of God
[1:03:46] we'll realize that we're everyone guilty
[1:03:49] and we all need help one from the other
[1:03:51] and the best way to do is pray amen
[1:03:56] amen so I'm just going to summarize okay
[1:04:01] the shield of faith is revelation of the
[1:04:04] word okay to quench the fiery DTS of the
[1:04:07] enemy what are the fiery darts it's
[1:04:09] spirit's trying to take dominion over
[1:04:11] you there thoughts that come into your
[1:04:13] mind feelings that associate with those
[1:04:15] thoughts to to quench the fiery Dart is
[1:04:18] to agree with your
[1:04:20] Revelation compared to and disagree with
[1:04:23] the dart yes okay so so like I said for
[1:04:26] example you feel a fear come upon you
[1:04:29] that's a dart that's been fired at you
[1:04:30] you either agree with the fear and let
[1:04:32] it rule you or you rebuke it in the name
[1:04:34] of Jesus Christ because your Revelation
[1:04:36] says fear is under my feet God has not
[1:04:38] given this to me but the spirit of he's
[1:04:40] not given me the spirit of fear but
[1:04:41] Power Love In A sound mind right or
[1:04:44] someone's jealous so you feel guilty
[1:04:46] over something you can either agree with
[1:04:48] that guilt and that Dart will hit you or
[1:04:51] he can raise your Shield of Revelation
[1:04:52] and quench that fiery
[1:04:54] Dart okay so that's my summation can we
[1:04:57] have the musicians please
[1:05:00] tonight amen see these things are
[1:05:02] tangible right it's amazing you you
[1:05:04] think oh the Apostle Paul's just using
[1:05:06] flowery words no God inspired him
[1:05:08] directly to speak these things that we
[1:05:11] could walk in this evil age and quench
[1:05:13] all all I'm glad it says all cuz even
[1:05:16] the Iron Dome has a percentage of Misses
[1:05:19] right everything man is devised as even
[1:05:21] a shield you know it could be a perfect
[1:05:23] shield in whatever area you live in I me
[1:05:25] the time you live in and er could still
[1:05:27] get through it but the shield we
[1:05:30] carry Glory it can quench all of them
[1:05:33] but it's up to you do you agree with
[1:05:34] your Shield of Faith or do you agree
[1:05:36] with the
[1:05:37] dart amen praise the Lord let's stand
[1:05:41] tonight and
