what the seal mystery is now we get it the lamb remember has to open every seal and the second beast if you notice in the routine of where we just went through the church stages the same thing the second first was a line the next was a was a was like a calf or a ox or something you see and this beast said come see now and when the lamb opened the seal and then uh he went to see and when he walked in what happened let's see what he found come see there's a mystery sealed up here that's been here now for two thousand years now let's see what it is now we find you that he saw what uh red horse go forward now to my understanding this to my understanding this great sword that he had in his hand now we got about three things to look at now for about the next 15-20 minutes let's just read and see what he says here and there went out the fourth verse there went out another horse that was red the person's wife and power was given unto him that set their own to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given him a great sword now there's symbols here and we want to look at them real close but to my understanding the best that i know now you see jesus predicted the same thing in matthew 24. amen see he said now you're going to hear of wars and rumors of wars and this wars and rumors of wars and wars and that's what all these ain't yeah yeah they time it yet see they asked jesus three questions thing and he answered him in three questions that's where a lot of our brethren got hanged up trying to place um of the adventist brethren about those seventh day and so forth back there to wander her to give child gets something the gates will be closed on the sabbath day and things like that mine they don't even pertain to the question at all not at all he's answering what they asked but he didn't he didn't uh it didn't apply at all to the last days he said you'll hear now we're working on this one thing here we'll come to some more of it in a few nights look he said you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and so forth now all this is not see that and then they'll go back again and they'll deliver you up and so forth like this no oh that's not right yet but when he got to the time when he's going to talk to him about what they asked him about the end of the world when will all these things be when they're about to be once don't let that fall what will the sign be and we'll be coming to the end of the world see they asked him three things then when he got down to the end of the world he said when you see the fig tree putting forth his butt now you know all that the time is at the door and verily i say to you that this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled how they infidel without the interpretation likes to lay on to that he said this generation not the generation is talking to the generation that's seen the fig tree putting forth his foot [Music] i was going to ask you something just let's look at something right here in the face israel is now for the first time for 2500 years the nation the oldest flag in the world is flying over jerusalem tonight amen amen israel is in her homeland it was a brother here one time i want to be a missionary felt after go missionary to the jews i said you might get one now and then all people thinks the whole nation now sir israel is converted as a nation not as a person and they shall be born in a day amen that's israel all israel's sacred just remember that paul said so all israel satan now notice all israel that's exactly right now notice this but he said when you see the fig tree and all the other trees putting forth their buds allah there's never been a time for 2 500 years that israel has ever come to your homeland amen we got the little show three minutes to midnight there she is the nation the sixth port star of david flying all these things has there ever been a time that the denominations has had revivals like they had in the last few years i just study now we're at home when did the denominations ever bloom out our any man's ministry like as a billy graham methodist baptist and so forth amen when was there ever a man searching down your history that ever went forth to the church formal by the name ending with h.a.m before amen a-b-e-r-a-d-r-a-h-a-m hello abraham's name has seven letters a-b-r-a-h-a-m but our brother billy graham had g-r-a-h-a-m-6 not seven in the world that's where he's ministering to church natural church natural was locked and solid amen and when this fellow went down there and preached and blighted them by the gospel but there was one who stayed with abraham amen and abraham called him elohim lord now when abraham seen three coming he said my lord when lot seemed to come in he said my lord amen that's the difference see your truth jesus said as it was in the days of love you see that notice counted now there was one come to this church spiritual the bride abraham that wasn't in sodom to begin with amen watch what he did he never done no preaching like they did he taught them but then they got under sign before him he done the messiah sign he had his back turned to the tent and he said abraham and i remember his actual name a few days before that was abram but it says abraham where is your wife s-a-r-a-h a few days before that was called s-a-r-r-a amen abraham said she's in the tent behind you amen amen and he said abraham ah that was your personal pronoun i am going to visit you as part of the promise that i've made you see where it was a man with dust on his forearms eating the meat of a cat and drinking the milk from the cow and eating cornbread god elohim manifested in flesh [Music] promised in the last days to manifest himself and flesh again [Applause] [Music] notice abraham where is your wife sarah she's in the tent behind you said i'm going to visit you and the lady of course being 100 years old she kind of laughed up her sleeve back in the tent now behind the curtains and attention yeah she said me an old woman well it ceased to be of them to husband and wife for years you know because he was 100 years old and she was 90 said uh that will never happen and he said why did she laugh with his back turned to the tent why did she laugh saying how can these things be see amen he showed him a sign now he promises that this will repeat at the end time again the two men went down there and preached the word told them to get out of there the place is going to burn up and so forth and it did and lot started out the church natural down in sin in the mar but yet struggling along in their organizational programs but the bride that one man never went to them he went only and called the bride type amen now we're in the last days now notice you said their god manifested in the flesh jesus said himself how do you condemn me said is it written in your bible your laws that they the prophets who the word of god came to jesus said the word came to the prophets because he was scriptural and all things he said ah oh the word of god says that the word came to the prophets and you call them gods for the word of god came to him so then how are you going to condemn me when i say i'm the son of god amen there you are see now where are we at we're at the end time i listen real close now now we find out that there will be wars and rumors of wars and now we see that the fig trees put forth its buds and the other trees put forth their buds methodists baptists presbyterians and all put forth their buds a great revival going on now i believe that god's gathering the bride for that last hour the election oh my i notice let us now consider what john saw then if these things what he saw a red horse and his rider goes forth power given to him to slay with a great sword now here's my revelation of it this is satan again it's a devil again in another form now we know that that um seals pertained as it said the other night and trumpets pertain to civil wars you see amongst the people among nations but you find out here that this man has a sword so he pertains to church political war now you might not think that but just watch it a minute just a few minutes notice the change of color of these horses same rider change of color of horses and a horse is a beast and the beast in the bible and her symbol represents a power the same system riding on another color power from the innocent white to a bloody red see watch him now nice coming when he first started he was just uh well he's just a little doctrine in a in a much closer nicoladianism of course it wouldn't slay anything that's revelations 2 6 if you want to put it down he wouldn't slay anything it's just a doctrine it's a spirit amongst the people now he would say nothing oh he was so innocent right now this white horse well you know we could have a great worldwide church we could call it the universal church they still do all right see now we could have or it's perfectly innocent and um well it's so innocent it's just a group of man we'll all get together for fellowship see it's very innocence white the white horse was see now so the um uh dignitaries and the better dressed and the educated you know kind of like birds of a feather we'll kind of get things together and poor bunch why if they want to stumble along all right but we will get a better class coming to our church if we can just get ourselves pulled off right here we'll we'll be uh we'll be a bunch of masons or so forth you know we just have the things fixed up where our odd fellas are they are and so then not the odd fella lodge now but you know what i mean so um it's odd to the real believer now but otherwise we want a little group of little seneca we can call our own it's just a doctrine very innocent brother why we have nothing against you people certainly not you're all right but you know we feel that um if we have business and we'd be better off if we just had ourselves together see it finally went right on down to heaven yes sir get together but when this awful deceiving spirit oh man incarnated in incarnate spirit this doctrine spirit became incarnated to take the place of christ into a man it must be worship then turn to be a worship like christ in other words up over the vatican i've been right there it's wrote vicarius of phileodelia as wrote in roman numerals now you just draw a line at the bottom of those normal roman numerals and it means instead of son of god in other words he's a biker you know what a biker is just take the place of something he is the biker instead of the son of god and the bible said let him that has a gift of wisdom count the numbers of the beast for it's a number of a man and his number is 666. now you take bypass and draw a line or roman numbers or b for five nine for one and add it up and see if you haven't got 666 the bible said he would be sitting in the temple of god worship like god when that little doctrine become a incarnate it become a biker instead of the son of god see oh my that awful deceiving spirit if you want to read that read the second thessalonians 2 3 and you can see where it's at and of course you remember satan is the head of all political power of every nation how many knows that you want to put it down matthew 4 8 satan took jesus up to high mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world that ever was or ever would be amen in a moment of time amen talk about a person he said i'll give them to you if you worship me and jesus knew that he was going to fall air to him that's what they say were you a bunch of poor holy rollers well we get the world amen the meat shall inherit the earth that's what jesus said see see notice jesus noted fall heir to him so it said get thee in satan it's written right back with the scripture again you see i shall worship the lord and him only see now now when when he as his head demon incarnate in this super religious man as the bible predicts then he unites his church and state both of his own powers unite together see when the antichrist spirit went forth it was a spirit then it become one it become then i watched the seal when the spirit went for it it was antichrist against the teaching of christ all right the next thing did what christ set out for his church to do it was against saying i don't know it don't mean that it don't mean it that was for somebody else that that's back in it a hundred years ago back under that that ain't for us see that's the anti against then it become how the writer went out he didn't have a crown but he was given one that white horse he had a boat no arrows see so then when he went forth then after while he was given a crown because you can't put a crown on a spirit's head but when this spirit become incarnate the second work of his of his dispensation of his mystic the second work he become a crowned false prophet to the working of the antichrist spirit now we see him now now he becomes that when he takes that then he uh is already satan controls the political powers of the world now he gets into a place that is going to make a universal church power taking religious power and do you not understand my brothers that in when this nation appears in the 13th chapter of revelations this little animal raised up like a lamb and it's got two horns civil and ecclesiastical power but he done the same thing the beast did before him [Applause] it's strange america is number 13 and a woman estranged it appears even in the 13th chapter of revelation we start out with 13 stripes on the flag 13 stars everything's 13 13 13 13 all the way down and everything's woman woman all the way down and finally end up i predicted a woman will control her remember that's 30 years ago i said it and and the the seven things that i predicted five of them's done come to pass and they got the man right there now to bring her in and you voted into your politics uh all right so much to say you can't hardly get to where you want to get to notice now i won't keep you a little bit longer if i have to we'll carry over tomorrow night look notice when satan uh everybody that realizes that satan controls all political powers of the world he said so matthew the fourth chapter you get an eighth verse all the kingdoms belong to him amen that's reason they fight war kill i remember isn't that strange they was given this sword to kill one another notice now now when he did that he did not have the ecclesiastical power yet but he started him with a demon of a false teaching and that teaching become a doctrine that doctrine become incarnate in a false prophet and then he went just to the right place he never went to israel now he went to rome now i see a room the council was held and they elected a head bishop amen amen and then by doing this they united church and stayed together then he dropped his bowl he got off his white horse he got on his red horse or he can kill anybody that don't agree with him there's your seal yeah watch him right on into eternity honor with it see unites both his powers together the same thing they're trying to do right now same thing today and a strange thing maybe you don't understand it but the day from a baptist group in louisville you heard it on the radio a speaker raised up and you haven't heard it see all right here you are they want and asked in the church now that we don't really have to um or just kind of jar in the catholic church but we have to kind of fellowship with them get it and the same time they're going on in louisville over here god's unfolding the seals to his people are sure don't do it [Applause] see it both working together [Applause] remember the crow and dove set on the same just remember now we find out he unites his power then when he become both state and church ecclesiastical then what are you going to do he farms his own religion and now he can do whatever he wants to that he has the right to putt to death whosoever will not agree with him that's exactly what he did too amen and he did that just exactly and what he he did it to the true saints of the living god who kept the word and wouldn't agree with him on his documents he put him to death amen now brother lee daniel and your teacher sure of the nausea age of the early church i don't know what you read this or not if you want to read it you get in smokers glorious refre reformation and you find it that when saint augustine of hippo become a priest under the roman church had the opportunity to one time the holy spirit tried to come on and he rejected it how many knows that as a teacher so he rejected the holy spirit that's exactly what the type of the protestant church today that's rejected the holy ghost he went back down to hippo and he was the very one that signed that paper that had the revelation from god that it was all right and pleasing god to put every person to death that didn't believe with the roman catholic church now listen i'm quoting from the martyrology from the thymus of saint augustine of hippo until 15 and 86 on the roman mortarology the roman catholic church put 68 million protestants today [Music] was his sword red would you ride a red horse what was it the same power the same rider amen there's a seal they admit 68 million on the mortarology besides all those put to death outside of that oh mercy during the dark ages there were millions fed the lions and slaughtering that way because they wouldn't bow down to that catholic dogma you know that if we go to revelations chapter six there's the so in revelations four and five the lamb takes the book which is the title deed of redemption and he opens the book and he looses the seals and and so as the seals the move of the antichrist down through the ages and it all combinates in this age and so brother brown was talking about the white horse rider which is the uh antichrist spirit writing fourth in the form of a um you know a doctrine as an antichrist writing as john would say in the epistles he said the antichrist spirit has come already and it's working among the people um so we read here in in revelation six and one i just sort of just recapped this just to just to consolidate what we've heard and what we've heard a month ago uh two i just like to welcome all the visitors here tonight this is not a regular wednesday service for us no we have preaching and but once a month we're going through the seals because this book of revelation it reveals what the devil's doing it also reveals what jesus christ is doing in this day so it's a very powerful book we know it's a symbolic book it's but it's a book of prophecy it's a book of history that's why when we're hearing you can see from history how uh it has been proven that there is on the martyrology of of of the roman catholic church so in 68 million people put to death because they didn't agree with the church and and that is history i have read in other sources of saint augustine of hippo rejecting the holy ghost and then he signed that into basically catholic law it was able to kill people who didn't agree with the doctrine of the church so so it's an overlay of history as well so so revelation 6 and 1 and when i saw the lamb open one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and him that sat and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so we know that this this uh first horse rider is not christ because if you take this um symbolism here the symbolism revelations 19 it's it's two different writers this is an antichrist spirit writing forth and we know you can't crown a spirit you've got a crown of man so when that teaching you know when that doctrine we went from the deeds of the nicolaitans and we know that the word nicolaitan means to conquer the people how do you conquer the people by giving them a false teaching that takes the holy ghost anointing from them that's how you conquer them let's say conquer people in a religious way as you cut off the holy ghost working in their life and so so it was a deed in the first church age then it finally became adoption and became uh you know an official church and so so this is the anointing on the uh of the antichrist in the first first ages here so so it's a deception writing forth had a bow no arrows it's nothing but a bluff and as i said you can't crown a spirit you can only crown a person so when that teaching became embodied in a man it was crowned and then and it went forth conquering and to conquer and this is not christ if you read revelations 19 and then after the spirit was crowned at the council of nicaea then the church had the state backing to use phys to use physical force to basically destroy any any contrary christian belief and um and so this is why it went from a white horse rider the same antichrist spirit now on a red horse because as we know our horses of power in the scripture and when he had opened the second seal which is what we heard today i heard the second beast say come and see and they went out another horse that was red and power was given unto him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword you know i was thinking as i was listening to this uh tonight you know many people blame religion for the wars in the you know in history and to an extent that's true you take from the dark ages or the crusades or different things they are wars of religion so it was this antichrist spirit riding forth taking peace from the earth in the name of jesus christ in the name of christianity and um so it's an antichrist spirit writing forth and then you know maybe i guess a few months down the track because we're going to take a portion of these messages once one wednesday a month we'll come down to the fourth horse rider whose name is death and it's a mixture of all the other anointings mixed into one and that is writing in this end time today it's what the it's what the devil is doing but what i love about the seals is is there's an anointing god always sends the anointing of the holy ghost to combat whatever the devil's doing so just as just as when that white horse rider went forth the anointing that went forth was the anointing of a lion anointing we need to combat what the antichrist was doing by the word going forth in power and then and then when the antichrist changed his tactic to to now he could physically kill the believers then and then it was a it was a ox anointing of the holy ghost came on so the people were actually anointed like an oxy as an animal of sacrifice actually anointed to give their lives and that's why if you read like fox's book of martyrs different ones they they were actually anointed to go through that persecution so they gladly gave their lives to be terribly you know it's it's incredible how how demon powers anoint men to invent new ways to kill people you read fox's book of matters different things like that it's incredible the ways they thought of inventing how to kill people but the believer was anointed by the holy ghost to overcome that not to bow not to recant but they went through and they gave their lives gladly like a beast of sacrifice so you know it's the same thing in this day we're under a prophetic eagle anointing the lord lifts us up above what we see with our five senses we see from the beginning to the end and we can see what the devil's doing we can see what christ is doing and we can see our position in god's great program so it's actually a glorious it may have been a bit of a heavy service you know what he's talking about but it's actually a very important thing because as we read there and you read when you read the fourth seal all the powers of the first three combine in the last one because the pale is a mix so it's the mix of the white the black and the red and um so these things still ride on today amen so um we're going to have a time of prayer now but you know remember the lord the lord is always greater than what the devil's doing great is he that's in you that he that's in the world amen so it doesn't matter how dark this world gets amen the light of god shines ever brighter and remember remember he that you know our lord jesus overcame hell death in the grave then he comes and lives in you by the baptism the holy ghost and he is the overcomer in your life just like he is the christian and you're in you that's the only way we can live a christian life is when he comes in and beats a christian through you otherwise it's human effort and that's a total miserable failure i mean no matter how good the intentions they may be so i'm so glad that we can just give our lives say lord just come live through me have your way not my will but thy will be done manifest your word through me lord do what you want to do be the christian in me lord amen praise the lord so amen we've got a few uh prayer requests but i'm so thankful that we serve a god that you know when he died that day on calvary he didn't just purchase our salvation but our healing he purchased our deliverance yeah i mean any any any need we have he purchased it it's already been paid for and full he said this is on the whatsapp but i'll just read it out he says hey bro ben could i please request prayer for a client who i have known for over 10 years his name is mark amy's and is 50. he's just been diagnosed with rectal cancer and is in and it's in his liver and lymph nodes the medical profession has said there's no hope at all noah and i so
