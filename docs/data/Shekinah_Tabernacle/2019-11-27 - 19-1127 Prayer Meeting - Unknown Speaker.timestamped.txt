[0:55] the Bible says and behold there was a
[1:00] man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon
[1:04] and the same man was just and devout
[1:09] waiting for the consolidation of Israel
[1:12] and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it
[1:16] was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost
[1:20] that he should not see death before he
[1:24] had seen the Lord the Lord's Christ
[1:28] verse 27 and he came by the spirit into
[1:33] the temple and when the parents brought
[1:35] in the Child Jesus to do for him after
[1:38] the custom of the law then took him up
[1:42] in his arms and blessed God and said

[3:40] that the deep color to the deep end

[4:03] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen
[4:06] we can enjoy the comfort of our seats
[4:09] while I remain standing
[4:11] amen god bless you Caleb I trust this
[4:17] thing works
[4:17] that's right amen
[4:19] I am not a I'm not that much of a
[4:24] preacher myself as you all know so if
[4:28] you maybe hear something tonight that is
[4:31] not so agreeable with you and on the
[4:34] Prophet taught us that if you eating
[4:36] meat any fan that is a bone you don't
[4:39] throw the whole plate of meat isn't it
[4:41] you throw only the bones and you eat the
[4:44] meat isn't it so if you find that
[4:46] tonight that maybe there's a little bone
[4:48] that I say don't throw the whole plate
[4:53] just understand that as I told you I'm
[4:55] not a preacher I mean I want us to speak
[4:59] tonight for a short few minutes about
[5:01] the message called expectation I mean
[5:04] the Prophet taught that message about
[5:07] oh but over 10 times amen sometimes he
[5:10] was calling it expectancy sometimes was
[5:13] calling it expectation and something in
[5:16] the leading sometimes you just call it
[5:18] expectation amen
[5:19] so I trust that this evening you are
[5:21] under expectation because it's not broad
[5:25] impor and employs just like a cell phone
[5:28] that is being used tonight you are
[5:31] talking to somebody in Australia but
[5:33] that person is not inside your phone
[5:35] he's in Australia but you are using some
[5:38] form of a device to connect so that you
[5:41] can hear that person that's what I am
[5:43] tonight you see so it gets all the cell
[5:46] phone you buy a new one that's what is a
[5:52] freaking I don't know I've never seen it
[5:54] there is a spare wheel of a car that is
[5:58] that is not all like this you know they
[6:01] even right there that that spare wheel
[6:03] when you put it on don't drive more than
[6:06] 80 kilometers and now you drive only
[6:10] eight max so tonight just an eight with
[6:13] me because the main wheels at the big
[6:19] day and then what bless you richly amen
[6:22] let's come back to the service
[6:23] expectation is what we are going to
[6:25] speak about tonight but before we speak
[6:28] about expectation we have read the
[6:29] scripture now this scripture tells us
[6:31] about him
[6:32] main course immune this man called
[6:34] Simeon he lived in the temple the
[6:38] Prophet says amen and it has been many
[6:41] many if you take on my bed too old
[6:44] ancient Israel it has been many
[6:46] centuries they essentially hundred years
[6:49] I was asked if I thought my family on
[6:52] the road
[6:52] what is the century because I didn't
[6:54] want to confuse essentially and a decade
[6:59] millennium is a thousand years so it has
[7:01] been many many centuries that the nation
[7:04] of Israel has been waiting for the
[7:06] Messiah to come it has been many years
[7:09] and then this man called Simeon he was
[7:13] living at the time of the great
[7:15] expectation but the point with this man
[7:18] about him is that he was under great
[7:23] expectation the Bible says he had the
[7:29] baptism of the Holy Spirit amen he the
[7:32] Bible says that he was filled with the
[7:35] Holy Spirit right and then him the
[7:39] Spirit spoke to him and told him that or
[7:42] he will let me put it that way it
[7:44] revealed to him huh it revealed him is
[7:48] not an angel that came to you know not
[7:51] vision did he see the Bible says the
[7:53] Holy Spirit revealed to him that he's
[7:57] not going to die before he see the birth
[8:00] of the Messiah so that's what the
[8:03] revelation of the Holy Spirit told simu
[8:06] how he together and therefore therefore
[8:10] he was under great expectation you
[8:12] believed the Word of God he was under
[8:15] anticipation that is why if you go to
[8:19] we'll come back to this scripture but
[8:21] let me just show you something that the
[8:24] word s that expectation comes from the
[8:26] word expect expectation is a noun right
[8:29] for those who in Lisbon is there now
[8:31] expectation it comes from the word
[8:33] expect so to expect is to is an act or a
[8:37] state of Lu you forward towards
[8:39] something you see you you anticipate
[8:42] something to happen you are looking
[8:44] forward we
[8:46] anticipation that something is going to
[8:48] happen or you're going to get something
[8:50] is an act or a state of expecting in
[8:54] other words they say in I went to the
[8:56] dictionary and upon that it comes from
[8:58] the width called expect re at the bottom
[9:02] here can I point this yeah it comes from
[9:04] the expect re is the Latin word with
[9:08] rate of two ways this expectation X
[9:10] which means out state are a means to
[9:15] look so in foolish expected
[9:18] meaning look out for so expectation is
[9:23] that you are looking for what for
[9:25] something to happen or to get or
[9:29] whatever but there's an expectation we
[9:31] all together we understand the real
[9:32] expectation now we find that that the
[9:37] expectation goes hand-in-hand with faith
[9:41] the Prophet says expectation it usually
[9:45] works together with faith in other words
[9:48] you you is a process it's an action that
[9:51] happens as a result of your faith it's
[9:56] an action that happens whether visible
[9:59] or not visible
[10:00] we agree that subjects are not visible
[10:02] all right some actions are happening in
[10:06] your mind is an action it's an activity
[10:08] it's happening in your mind or in your
[10:10] heart you believe God by faith faith is
[10:13] a substance right so there's an activity
[10:15] there's an action there's something
[10:17] happening in the spiritual or physical
[10:19] you can see me I'm doing something right
[10:23] for something to happen so faith is
[10:26] something that happens inside you but
[10:29] there's an expectation for something to
[10:31] happen out of that faith I will together
[10:34] so I'm saying here that it can either be
[10:38] it can have the downside expectation can
[10:42] have the downside if you left the
[10:43] downside or the upside let me give an
[10:46] example you you you can expect someone
[10:49] to die huh you can expect something bad
[10:53] to happen you can you can you can expect
[10:56] not to find something face
[10:59] on your face right or based on one you
[11:02] know that this is effect so you you
[11:06] don't expect it to happen now I don't
[11:08] expect them to come because they were
[11:10] here last week
[11:11] can you see so that's not really
[11:12] positive but the point of the matter is
[11:15] that there is an expectation of
[11:17] something to happen it doesn't matter we
[11:19] site you are but you you you you you
[11:22] expect whether tonight they expect you
[11:25] to hear from God or you here only what
[11:28] is that you everybody expecting
[11:30] something to happen
[11:32] I meant sodium I sound like you teach
[11:34] yourself and so that's why when I said
[11:36] then I expected I expect a response
[11:38] event so I thought you expect something
[11:42] to happen or respect something not to
[11:44] happen but you are and the expectation
[11:46] believe it or not amen
[11:48] so now and if we just continue a little
[11:51] bit we go to the next slide so I never
[11:56] really priest with a slide we spoke
[11:59] about this man Simeon the Prophet says
[12:02] this man Simeon he was not afraid he was
[12:06] not afraid to express his expectation
[12:08] because the what is pretty revealed it
[12:10] to him he was not afraid to declare his
[12:13] expectation we sing a beautiful song I'm
[12:15] no longer the slave to feel we are not
[12:20] Simeon was not under fear he was
[12:23] declaring to the people what the Spirit
[12:27] has told him he was convinced he was
[12:30] fully 110 percent expectation that he is
[12:35] not going to die can you imagine let's
[12:38] just practical eyes it we hear of many
[12:42] miracles in the Bible and angel come we
[12:45] hear about things that happens we hear
[12:48] about miracles and things but if San
[12:50] Simeon was exactly like us today ask me
[12:54] how he was like us because he may never
[12:57] saw any angel he never saw a miracle the
[13:00] Holy Spirit was upon him and the Holy
[13:04] Spirit today is upon who you
[13:06] the volunteers upon you today that means
[13:10] that the expectation of Simeon must be
[13:13] on me in you this evening because Simeon
[13:16] only had the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[13:19] Spirit the Bible says it revealed to you
[13:22] you the word was revealed to you right
[13:26] in so many ways sometimes maybe even
[13:30] more than Simeon because we have seen
[13:32] miracles to consolidate but Simeon he
[13:36] only got the Holy Spirit anointing just
[13:39] like we have today do you believe me for
[13:41] the Holy Spirit so the Holy Spirit
[13:43] reveals to you that something is going
[13:45] to come Jesus Christ is going to come
[13:47] and fetch us so we must be under great
[13:50] expectation because Simeon was in the
[13:53] same boat with us amen
[13:55] Jonah he he was expecting to see a he
[13:59] was an old man the Bible says you see
[14:02] when you read the Bible slowly you pick
[14:04] up these things he says that he was not
[14:09] going to die before he sees that the
[14:11] Christ the bone crimes but he was an old
[14:13] man the Prophet says any for any reason
[14:19] or anyone will expect you to die anytime
[14:21] but the Holy Spirit said is not going to
[14:22] die so any he was he was sure that he's
[14:26] not going to die before you sees the
[14:28] Christ now when God says something it
[14:30] must happen
[14:31] that's effect so this is just to help
[14:34] you out in case expectation is on the
[14:36] low side god it's not a question of
[14:41] debate or anything god it's got no
[14:45] element of fail I need you the point
[14:49] about this is that why I'm saying this
[14:52] is just to help you and me and by the
[14:54] way everything that I say I'm also
[14:56] directing it to myself so I'm preaching
[14:59] to myself the God never fails everything
[15:03] that he says will happen so that is
[15:06] clear is like when you are paging a book
[15:07] yet we are done that chapter it's not
[15:10] whether God so we're gonna happen or
[15:12] he's at it
[15:13] that's the effect the issue that is
[15:16] remaining is between you and me about
[15:20] whether we believe what God said is
[15:23] going to happen or not because God does
[15:25] not lie so the Prophet says when God
[15:28] says something it must happen this need
[15:31] not raise I'm supposed to sorry when God
[15:37] says something it must happen this need
[15:39] to raise your positive attitude in us
[15:43] this needs to raise the positive
[15:45] attitude in us because when God said
[15:47] something we know we are sure that God
[15:50] is the one who created the heavens and
[15:52] the earth from his words we know that
[15:55] God we know those things so when we hear
[15:57] that God said something ours what is
[16:00] left it's just for us to to find a
[16:03] positive attitude towards what God said
[16:06] so that the promise of God can happen
[16:09] because God never fails what he said it
[16:12] will happen regardless whether we
[16:14] believe it or we don't
[16:15] so it is up to us now to fight to line
[16:18] up with what God had said you see
[16:20] because what he said it will come to
[16:22] happen isn't it analyst it's true my
[16:24] game so now now we find that there for
[16:28] example I say then let's just expand a
[16:32] little bit to this word expectation if
[16:34] you if you lose something in the house
[16:37] something very important something
[16:39] precious something that as they always
[16:42] say it means life or death huh and you
[16:46] lose that thing in the house you can't
[16:48] find it very serious commodity that you
[16:51] need to pass and you must find it within
[16:53] a specific time let's just say there's a
[16:56] deadline you know that this thing last
[16:59] week you have put it somewhere in the
[17:02] house but you can't find it you know
[17:06] what you think you you give me to bring
[17:07] a prayer request to change for the
[17:10] believers to pray with you because you
[17:12] are under expectation you believe that
[17:15] if we pray this item will be found right
[17:19] we believe that if you ask the brothers
[17:22] to group together with you in prayer and
[17:25] we put our faith to
[17:27] this item will be found right now you
[17:30] you look with a great expectation to
[17:32] find this item and I wrote there not to
[17:35] find remember I told you it just got
[17:37] some people when we done they loop or
[17:40] when they they find they want to find
[17:43] something they don't expect positive
[17:44] outcome it can happen like I've
[17:48] explained earlier on that but we are on
[17:51] the positive side the message that I
[17:53] want to bring to you on the positive
[17:54] side itself to show you that be careful
[17:56] of the negative side of them not find
[17:59] you because we are not there that's not
[18:00] for us now
[18:01] expectation you look by faith not by
[18:04] doubt right you you you go that because
[18:07] you know that this thing that I'm
[18:09] looking for it is there the existence of
[18:12] this thing that we are looking for is
[18:14] not questionable it's not whether it
[18:18] exists or not exist we know is day it's
[18:21] an item that you put it somewhere but
[18:23] you can't find it we are going to look
[18:25] for it with great great seriousness and
[18:29] persistence and you are going to be
[18:31] persevere and you are going to persist
[18:33] to look for it why are you doing that
[18:36] because you are and the expectation to
[18:39] find this item because you know that is
[18:42] there right
[18:43] your point to say no no come help me
[18:45] you're going to to talk to people in
[18:46] your house and then please help me find
[18:49] this item right let's say is your
[18:53] passport and you're going to check out
[18:55] and your body to book them flats sorry
[19:00] word for beat but the point that I want
[19:03] to illustrate is that coupe you can't
[19:05] find this Passport and you must travel
[19:07] so and you know that last week you've
[19:10] just put it here on your bedside but you
[19:12] can't find it now you're going to go
[19:15] with a great expectation with the old
[19:17] house will be 10 ups upside down yeah
[19:20] that's how we say don't look for that
[19:22] password because you know that it is day
[19:24] right now you you'll ask anyone in the
[19:28] house you talk to anyone and then ask
[19:30] people even from outside Lausanne you
[19:33] come in tell the believers I must find a
[19:35] passport yeah and you're looking for it
[19:37] why are you so persistent when you can't
[19:40] find it where you put it if you don't
[19:41] find it there where you put it
[19:42] why can't you just leave and say no well
[19:45] I put it is not this the children all of
[19:48] them no one said they saw it why can't
[19:50] you just give up because you are driven
[19:54] by your faith you are driven by your
[19:56] expectations so that is why you go all
[19:59] out to go look for the passport to find
[20:03] it because you know that you have put it
[20:05] some way I mean so now you you can't be
[20:08] under spectating and do nothing
[20:11] are we together the person who is under
[20:13] spectating tells the house upside down
[20:17] expectation EU works because he knows
[20:20] that there is a place called Stokes
[20:24] Valley let's say you're driving from
[20:26] Wellington and they say there's no more
[20:29] place there is not a place called Stokes
[20:30] baby but you know that you've checked it
[20:33] on the map you know that we have had
[20:36] your friends telling you that this
[20:38] Stokes very and you know driving day you
[20:40] not gonna listen to that person you are
[20:41] going to drive and once the way you're
[20:43] going to get maybe if you get lost
[20:45] you're going to ten and if anyone to get
[20:47] to Stokes baby because you are under
[20:49] expectation to arrive in Stokes baby
[20:52] because you know Stokes really exists so
[20:56] now you will use your you do something
[20:58] when you are unexpected you know you
[21:00] want you know and expect things to
[21:02] happen but yet you call yourself the
[21:05] person whose and expectation so that
[21:08] means that if you do that and you do
[21:11] nothing and you are telling me or us
[21:14] that your and expectation you are lying
[21:16] to us because you are not because the
[21:19] person who's unexpected you we seem by
[21:21] doing something we seem by acting to us
[21:26] getting what he wants if you do nothing
[21:29] you are demonstrating that you don't
[21:33] have expectation and by extension
[21:34] because we said is an act of faith the
[21:38] level of faith is questionable can you
[21:41] see what I'm trying to say so we must be
[21:43] under great expectation we in other ways
[21:45] we must pray to God to help us to give
[21:47] us faith so that our expectation can run
[21:50] because believe what
[21:52] the heart expectation the higher there
[21:55] is the reward that you receive amen the
[21:58] higher expectation the higher the reward
[22:00] so if we expect what God will give you
[22:02] what because your faith will be higher
[22:04] all right you get results wisely
[22:07] you know Gentiva results quickly not
[22:09] quickly all the time but you will get
[22:11] them for sure I mean so you expect but
[22:14] otherwise you are not under spectating
[22:16] if you don't act I mean so what what do
[22:23] you do you illustrate by doing something
[22:27] when your hand expectation you don't see
[22:30] it you look you check you look for that
[22:34] passport you look for that what you have
[22:35] your ask you going to give you a men so
[22:38] now if we can just continue the end now
[22:43] I want to read for you what the Prophet
[22:44] says this he says you had about the lady
[22:47] that played for the mountain to be moved
[22:50] and then when he played for the mountain
[22:53] to be moved wait am i you heard about
[22:57] the lady then pray for the mountain to
[23:00] be moved and got up the next morning and
[23:02] looked out of the window and said just
[23:05] as expected the mountain is still
[23:14] expected that's right now you want to
[23:18] have an expectation all the way from
[23:21] heart soul body and mind that God is
[23:25] going to give you to give us a great
[23:27] outpouring of the Holy Spirit you see
[23:29] this woman
[23:30] pray that God can move the mountain he
[23:33] the one who asked God no one else Hey
[23:36] but he didn't expect that the mountain
[23:39] that's the problem you see so when you
[23:42] pray for God to give you something when
[23:44] you ask for God to give you something
[23:46] you and me must be an expectation
[23:49] because it does not help what is not
[23:51] listening to your player from the mouth
[23:54] looking at the heart what do you say
[23:56] you're asking for something and yet you
[23:58] are not anything but if you're an
[24:00] expectation that's what God responds to
[24:02] because you I expect you've got to give
[24:04] you in fact in the morning you may not
[24:08] even wake up to go to the window because
[24:09] you know the mountain is gone you know
[24:16] God has moved the mountain your only one
[24:19] - yet you're done can you say mama I
[24:22] know I know the mountain is gone I know
[24:27] the one who prayed for it expectations
[24:32] that's what expectation talks about it
[24:34] talks about faith it is emanates from
[24:36] phases an activity is one of the actions
[24:39] that shows that you believe what you
[24:42] have requested that God will give you -
[24:44] the promises now you want to have
[24:46] expectation oh the way you want with you
[25:01] now you want to have an expectation of
[25:03] all the way and this is what excites me
[25:07] very much this red this red highlighted
[25:10] this one this one this one in this one
[25:12] you need to expect God that God will do
[25:16] something for you from your heart your
[25:18] soul is our body and your mind meaning
[25:21] that every fiber of your body you must
[25:29] be expecting that God is going to do
[25:31] something in other words you you know
[25:33] when when we baptize people who run
[25:35] baptize them and hand is left outside no
[25:39] we baptize them food if we mess them
[25:41] food way from top from top to head from
[25:45] head to toe
[25:46] Fuli so you must be believing God you
[25:51] must be under fixation from your heart
[25:53] your body your soul and your mind
[25:55] everything otherwise think about this
[25:59] think about if you have an expectation
[26:01] and then your only expectation with just
[26:05] your mind
[26:07] right what will happen oh I don't know
[26:13] if you can believe or expect just from
[26:15] your soul I don't know it is possible
[26:17] but the point I'm trying to show you is
[26:19] that Tecna bottom you only believe just
[26:21] with one part on the physical side
[26:25] that's what more normally we see on them
[26:27] on their own their own their own their
[26:30] spiritual on their own the spirit side
[26:32] you are just imagining you say I believe
[26:35] you know you've got what you call mental
[26:36] faith ah not from your heart so how is
[26:40] God going to help you because the
[26:42] Prophet here the men of God said all the
[26:45] way everything am i right so that's what
[26:50] we need to do we need to believe God all
[26:52] the way and then let's continue and see
[26:57] what I what I said here another
[26:59] quotation yes another quotation that I
[27:02] had there for you from 1950 April he
[27:06] says the Prophet that then we always get
[27:09] what we expect very fundamental that's
[27:14] very very important because what I'm
[27:16] saying is fundamental yes ABC of this
[27:19] distort do not go and extend or not
[27:26] expect but expect to get do you get my
[27:30] point
[27:30] don't go out an extent but not expecting
[27:37] anyone get what I'm trying to say so
[27:40] don't expect God to give you something
[27:42] but you're not really expecting you
[27:45] another was being in doubt not fully
[27:47] being a mess not billing you from your
[27:49] heart mind soul and body but confessing
[27:52] not oh I've got you who have to confess
[27:53] but that should filter through right
[27:55] through the whole system of your body
[27:58] amen you need to believe God we we
[28:02] always get what we expect when people
[28:04] expect anything well then they usually
[28:07] get what you look for it is it is a
[28:10] mental attitude that you have that the
[28:14] Prophet says that our mental attitude
[28:17] determines or is laid health
[28:19] to believe to get what we are expecting
[28:22] from God our mental setup remember
[28:24] remember that this and never forget it
[28:29] remember this and never forgetting the
[28:32] right mental attitude towards any
[28:34] promise of God will bring it to pass
[28:37] right the right mental attitude toward
[28:41] God's promise to bring it to pass
[28:43] so that's why you believe you you expect
[28:47] from your mind from your soul from your
[28:50] everything about you all right then you
[28:52] use your your positive to us what you
[28:55] are talking about towards what do you
[28:56] believe
[28:57] Amen you I'll be together so I'm trying
[29:00] to say to you that your level of
[29:02] expectation will determine you a way of
[29:05] your attitude will get your mind how
[29:07] you're going to believe God's will it's
[29:09] going to determine how your faith is
[29:11] going to be to as well as what respect
[29:13] you from God amen that is why Paul says
[29:16] that in the book of Romans that for I
[29:20] reckon that the sufferings of this
[29:22] present time are not worthy to be
[29:24] compared with the glory which shall be
[29:27] revealed in us for the ls expectation of
[29:30] the creature waiteth for the
[29:34] manifestation of the sons of God if you
[29:35] listen to the word expectation you will
[29:38] pick up that the word expectation inside
[29:40] it has got a weight that man called
[29:43] Simeon that we spoke about
[29:45] he was waiting he was under great
[29:47] expectation he was looking forward for
[29:49] something to happen Frank and then he
[29:52] was waiting for the Messiah to come and
[29:55] that is why here
[29:57] Paul contends that any sense that then
[29:59] the creature that for the manifestation
[30:02] of the sons of God this is a grace is an
[30:04] NS expectation and NS and it means that
[30:09] who can give me a simplistic explanation
[30:12] open-ended you know when we say
[30:14] something's and NS it means that it has
[30:16] been is that upfront deposit you see so
[30:21] our expectation because it emanates from
[30:24] faith right and paint is a substance and
[30:28] a substance is something
[30:29] is tangible in my life and substances
[30:32] are something that you can touch that
[30:33] you can move so the endless of hearts
[30:36] petition is that a deposit what is
[30:41] already being update upfront halfway
[30:44] through and then so that is what we
[30:47] polish talking about you also in the
[30:49] book of Philippians he he says for I
[30:53] know for I know that beasts shall tend
[30:57] to my salvation through your prayer and
[31:01] my son and the supply of the spirit of
[31:03] Jesus Christ
[31:04] I know but this is talking about
[31:07] expectation amen
[31:08] according to according to my expectation
[31:15] and my hope that in in nothing I shall
[31:18] be ashamed but that in all boldness in
[31:24] all boldness has always shown so now
[31:27] also the Christ shall be magnified in my
[31:31] body whether it be in life or by death
[31:38] so my phone is blow do certain things in
[31:41] yes I keep on looking them so Paul is
[31:44] trying to demonstrate our expectation in
[31:46] what is expecting is trying to show you
[31:48] to confirm what the Prophet says that
[31:50] our expectation is already an upfront
[31:53] payment there's already an upfront
[31:55] payment of our expectations so now we
[31:58] are we've got no reason not to expects
[32:01] that God will give us we've got no
[32:03] reason to not expect that God will come
[32:06] in for no reason at all with what no
[32:09] reason not to expect that when you come
[32:11] to change despite the path of who is
[32:13] preaching that God can talk to you man
[32:15] beyond expectation because you are not
[32:18] going to see a minister you're going to
[32:20] hear God and you pray that God can use
[32:23] the vessel for your benefit you receive
[32:31] what God what you are pray from what to
[32:34] give
[32:34] the Bible says God can raise stones to
[32:39] preach the gospel and a God can make a
[32:42] donkey to talk and you see the angel
[32:45] better than me and you so how much about
[32:47] you and daughter and the son of God a
[32:51] wife of God
[32:52] how much about you so the question is
[32:54] that it is not of God because God
[32:56] already said in his word that we're two
[32:58] or three I get that I will be in their
[33:01] Messiah that in my name he already said
[33:04] that and I will be in your midst he
[33:07] already said if you ask me I will give
[33:09] you the already that all those promises
[33:12] the issue is just for me and for you to
[33:15] pray that God please come and fulfill
[33:17] your weight I am ready
[33:19] so now you ain't got meat follow him
[33:22] from from Sunday's message in conclusion
[33:27] okay before we go there I picked up this
[33:31] Psalm 24 and the thought about the Sun
[33:34] Sun Sun body - sorry 742 is why it talks
[33:38] about the deep end the deep : today that
[33:41] means that what is trying to say is that
[33:44] as the Prophet was it that for a fish to
[33:48] exist there must be water for Ritu's to
[33:52] swim for a fish to have a fin before
[33:55] there could be a pin on a piece you know
[33:58] a pin of the fish before it can be there
[34:01] on the fish for it to swim there must be
[34:04] water somewhere there must be a
[34:06] corresponding environment or setting for
[34:09] a fish to be able to swim how is this
[34:12] relevant what we are talking about today
[34:14] if you can find that you've got a desire
[34:17] in your heart and you find out what they
[34:21] need or you find that you put your
[34:23] yearning for something which mister
[34:25] something somewhere that God wants to
[34:27] give you the only thing that is there
[34:30] for you to do is to believe God because
[34:33] that's already responding a response for
[34:37] you
[34:38] otherwise there was not going to be any
[34:40] desire from your heart
[34:42] why would God allow you
[34:43] desire why would the Holy Spirit promise
[34:46] you something why would God say I'll
[34:49] give it all in spirit and you feel I
[34:51] want this real feeling of this place
[34:53] you can feel it you can feel it better
[34:57] you can hate ah from yourself you can
[35:00] hate and now why would God put it there
[35:02] what is the reason for God to put things
[35:05] in your heart because there's already an
[35:08] answer I just provided for you there was
[35:13] a reason why God will create a fish
[35:15] because he already made no provision for
[35:18] the fish to swim
[35:19] I know I've God was not going to make
[35:21] the fish spin fish we're going to have
[35:23] Pete's walk because they couldn't assume
[35:25] can you understand what I'm practicing
[35:27] so now I'm sorry Caleb if you have a
[35:32] desire that's what I was trying to say
[35:34] now for something tonight
[35:36] there must be a fountain of that in some
[35:39] way otherwise there will be no desire in
[35:42] your heart right we know now that sorry
[35:46] to the Judah was again my brothers are
[35:48] going to fly and sisters to fly to
[35:50] Nigeria to go visit their families now
[35:52] they are under great expectation why
[35:54] because it's a pike waiting ha there's
[35:57] people waiting that side they also could
[35:59] have a cross posting desire to meet them
[36:01] their content is that so there's a dip
[36:04] college and to that tip so you can the
[36:07] carpool flies end up going to go but now
[36:09] they are just waiting and they're not
[36:11] excited that there's nothing good in the
[36:22] expectation they can tell him that no
[36:25] but flight is cancelled that flight that
[36:31] you couldn't fly god forbid is canceled
[36:33] telling me prathana and the family they
[36:35] are not going to put their base down I
[36:37] can assure you that won't were the
[36:39] airport is the one is gonna fly rota
[36:42] under a station
[36:47] [Music]
[37:07] this must raise our level of expectation
[37:10] tonight if God said something I mean
[37:16] what never lie if God's if we all agree
[37:19] with one point that when God says
[37:21] something it will happen then this
[37:25] master raise our level of expectation
[37:26] because it means that God said something
[37:31] I've got a desire for that to receive
[37:33] that thing so what is left what is left
[37:36] for me to receive what is left is that
[37:40] if I pilla I'm not getting to answer I
[37:42] must pray to God to give me more
[37:43] expectation dude I like what you said
[37:46] last week is that if you don't have that
[37:48] it then I've got to give you how many
[37:50] rating if you don't have because the
[37:53] Word of God said ask anything and
[37:56] sometimes the devil seeks us behind this
[38:00] with anything we think anything is not
[38:03] anything he is like an open check just
[38:22] the hacker I've gotten you that you want
[38:23] you didn't ask for something awkward
[38:25] because you've got the Spirit of God in
[38:27] you so God knows when he says to you ask
[38:29] anything that we are going to ask for
[38:31] anything within the bounds of the Holy
[38:34] Spirit with this the boundaries of
[38:36] heaven that's not of God won't ask that
[38:38] no God give me those what can I give an
[38:41] example and sound of God one asks for
[38:43] something evil he won't ask for
[38:46] something and scriptural you ask for
[38:48] something that we do according to your
[38:50] spirit is inside you
[38:51] so that is why is that ask for anything
[38:53] because he knows that you are going to
[38:55] ask for something within the
[38:57] and anything means anything prison for
[39:00] example and when I do get brother James
[39:06] I don't understand him you know
[39:20] sometimes the devil can make you just to
[39:23] forget then you can ask God that you
[39:26] don't have to join what are you waiting
[39:28] for
[39:28] because you're he already said to you
[39:30] ask anything you feel that you you
[39:33] anything you know anything anything
[39:35] simply means anything you you think that
[39:38] and God cannot give you anything as he
[39:41] said the problem we are going to end up
[39:44] limiting God we are going to end up
[39:48] taking anything and cut it and reduce it
[39:52] not to be anything because he said
[39:54] anything ask for it so you go before God
[39:58] and ask about anything
[39:59] and from there heaven expectation it
[40:03] doesn't matter how is going to take God
[40:06] is going to give it to you amen so that
[40:08] should raise our level of expectation
[40:10] amen on that think you know that of the
[40:17] Sunday sermon upon the been preached you
[40:19] see he I hate him this way maybe you
[40:22] hate him differently but what you are
[40:24] saying is that for God to help you you
[40:27] must do something for God to be able to
[40:30] raise Lazarus and call him Marian Martha
[40:34] had to roll a stone you need to rolled a
[40:37] stone right to show that you are an
[40:39] expectation otherwise time you would
[40:42] have said no no no no no everyone not
[40:44] everyone a second you yourself you know
[40:46] that resurrection is coming at the end I
[40:50] was going to prove that they are not and
[40:52] expectation even if he tells them I am
[40:55] the resurrection and life that would
[40:57] demonstrate to them the level of faith
[40:59] but they start remote we know
[41:03] resurrection is going to come at the end
[41:05] time he said to them I am the
[41:07] resurrection and
[41:08] meaning that I'll can deselect him now
[41:11] therefore on a stone what they did their
[41:15] openness to because they knew that what
[41:18] is this it must happen immediately when
[41:21] you said that I believe that their level
[41:24] of expectation winner immediately and
[41:30] the promises of God our level of
[41:32] expectation must shoot our anticipation
[41:36] is for our the moment you you you here
[41:40] you feel a desire for something in your
[41:43] heart don't suppress it instead have
[41:46] your expectation to go Aven may God
[41:51] bless us amen
[41:52] in conclusion as I've said that they our
[41:55] ultimate goal is to have the positive
[41:57] faith based positive what did I say our
[42:06] ultimate goal is to have a positive and
[42:09] a faith-based expectation that's what I
[42:12] wanted to see so we need the support
[42:17] that I have for you tonight the whole
[42:20] idea is that whenever we ask or
[42:24] something whatever God has promised in
[42:27] fact we must ask for God to raise needs
[42:29] for us in our hearts so that we can be
[42:32] able to ask him so that sometimes the
[42:35] devil hides your needs he hide the
[42:37] things that you need so that you cannot
[42:39] recognize because you know that this was
[42:41] if I show you he's going to ask good and
[42:45] God is going to give you so as forgot to
[42:47] expose them you know that I can
[42:55] ultimate goal to have a positive mental
[43:00] attitude mental way of looking at God's
[43:04] Way faith-based expectation that's what
[43:10] we need to have this evening now we we
[43:14] read that Scripture right any alone I
[43:17] said I'll come back to it so Matthew 22
[43:21] says Jesus said unto Him it was a loyal
[43:24] soldier suspicious it was a loyal asking
[43:27] sister ask him that the Lord Jesus
[43:29] Christ about tempting you about about
[43:34] the law because you see alone and he was
[43:38] asking you which one is the greatest law
[43:41] and the Lord gave me a direct answer but
[43:45] I pick up something in that answer and
[43:48] this links up with what the Prophet said
[43:50] in that message earlier on that I read
[43:51] for you remember when you said when you
[43:54] expect when you do something you must
[43:55] expect with your mind when you ask God
[43:58] some you must expect with your soul your
[43:59] mind everything about you amen
[44:02] he says to this man jesus said unto him
[44:06] thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[44:09] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[44:12] with all their mind now in closing this
[44:18] is very key for me I love this scripture
[44:21] my families is I'm sure they're getting
[44:23] annoyed with me because I always read
[44:24] this one most of the time lately because
[44:27] it has got key things for me we know how
[44:29] are you so treasures three circles that
[44:31] I like very much the soul the spirit and
[44:35] then let's just put it I know I know I
[44:38] know those are not directly those ones I
[44:40] know those are not direct to do this but
[44:43] just let's look at them heart soul and
[44:44] mind and think of them huh and think of
[44:48] these three circles that makes a human
[44:50] being so he says the key word here is
[44:53] this one this one love the Lord your God
[45:00] with your heart your soul and your mind
[45:04] with your soul with your spirit we
[45:07] your flesh everything of you love you
[45:11] why did you not say to them to that man
[45:14] why didn't the Lord when he gave Moses
[45:16] that lo why wasn't the best law about
[45:20] respecting the Lord your God with all
[45:22] your mind
[45:23] why love and can you see what I'm trying
[45:28] to get God is love the Bible says God is
[45:32] love God is divine love
[45:36] therefore to come to him you have to
[45:38] come through the way of love but it's
[45:41] why we are the bride of the Lord Jesus
[45:43] we come through the way of love and it
[45:45] you cannot love God halfway through
[45:50] whatever measurement you want to boot
[45:53] you have to love him with everything
[45:55] within you so that your expectation can
[45:58] rise so not everything that you as you
[46:01] can get you have to love you God
[46:04] couldn't say he didn't say but the
[46:07] greatest commandment is to love your God
[46:11] with all your heart could upset no
[46:20] worship the Lord your God that's the
[46:23] first commandment no I didn't say that
[46:25] the first law that he put not even a
[46:28] proposition
[46:29] not even a you may do it is a
[46:32] commandment it's like when we do put
[46:35] watching and communion that thing is an
[46:38] ordinance is something that we've got no
[46:40] choice we have to do it this we must
[46:44] baptize you you know certain things we
[46:46] can say it legal are that one get those
[46:48] check that check they do it this church
[46:50] will do it you know those are not things
[46:53] that God commanded is according to how
[46:55] the Lord has revealed it to you maybe
[46:57] how the Prophet set it and everything
[46:59] you know but this is hello with all you
[47:07] had your soul and your mind so I'm
[47:10] saying to you
[47:10] I'm putting the other wisdom with all
[47:13] your soul with all your spirit and with
[47:16] all your flesh outside face everything
[47:19] about you
[47:20] reflect must him about God must love lob
[47:24] amen
[47:25] so now you see but when you love you you
[47:28] are taking a different picture the
[47:30] expectation is not a problem to happen
[47:33] anything that you want is not difficult
[47:35] to happen because we are taking a
[47:37] different thing which is what I want to
[47:39] show you there
[47:40] how many recognize is that each other
[47:43] can you see the top the top part and in
[47:47] between and then from the bottom divine
[47:54] love the bright how many cognize is this
[47:57] bottom part which one is at the which
[48:01] one which one is the first virtue here I
[48:03] want a little challenge to tell me which
[48:06] one is there best at the bottom
[48:08] let me not call my challenge let me call
[48:11] someone which one is the first one in
[48:15] the bottom yeah on the pyramid if you
[48:18] remove this white corner here and we
[48:20] have the pyramid which one is the first
[48:22] one his face isn't it oh yeah sorry my
[48:26] boy didn't see you this way he's faced
[48:28] right fight is the best one and we sat
[48:31] down expectation he's an elemental face
[48:36] and then we say that and God is love and
[48:41] at the bride meaning the bride is love
[48:44] the price is part of that love of God
[48:47] that must come and meet up with God
[48:49] because he cannot come and meet
[48:51] something different if God is love and
[48:54] he's coming to meet his bride he must be
[48:58] meeting that is why the last veg day is
[49:04] one which one is it

[49:16] that you are my disciples if you love
[49:18] one another and then Paul said if you
[49:21] don't have love if you don't have
[49:23] charity yes you have the gifts yes you
[49:30] left everything but you thought love
[49:33] because God is love what is very very
[49:35] important for us to understand that God
[49:38] being Allah is expecting to come and
[49:41] meet his bride who is laughs then they
[49:44] are going to meet and go to the
[49:46] honeymoon and the marriage supper I mean
