[45:27] Jesus Christ amen amen god bless your
[45:30] friends you may have your seats this
[45:32] morning now I have another scripture to
[45:36] readin in the book of Galatians as well
[45:39] Galatians 4 and 21 to 24 just tell me ye
[45:45] that desire to be under the law do you
[45:48] not hear the law for it is written that
[45:50] Abraham had two sons the one was a
[45:53] bondmaid the other was a free woman but
[45:55] he who was of the bondwoman was born
[45:58] after the flesh but he of the freewoman
[45:59] was a by promise which things are an
[46:03] allegory for these are the two covenants
[46:05] the one was from Mount Sinai which is
[46:08] gendereth to bondage which is agar which
[46:11] is Hagar in the Old Testament for this
[46:13] agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and
[46:16] answereth to Jerusalem which now is and
[46:19] is in bondage with her children but
[46:21] Jerusalem witches of above is free which
[46:24] is the mother of us all for it is
[46:26] written rejoice thou barren that birth
[46:28] not break forth and cry
[46:30] now that travail if not for the desolate
[46:33] hath more children than she which as and
[46:36] a husband now ye brethren as Isaac was
[46:40] are the children of promise but as then
[46:43] he that was born after the flesh
[46:45] persecuted him that was born after the
[46:47] spirit even solders now nevertheless
[46:50] what saith the scripture cast out the
[46:53] bondwoman and her son for the bondwoman
[46:55] shall not be heir with the son of the
[46:57] freewoman so then brethren ye are not
[46:59] children of the bondwoman but of the
[47:02] free amen and I want to I want to
[47:05] continue from Wednesday we're talking
[47:07] about yeah being awakened to the day and
[47:09] hour in which we live and I want to talk
[47:11] about being free you know we read there
[47:15] and Deuteronomy as an eagle stirreth
[47:17] nice and and and and your bridge over
[47:21] her little ones and that says the Lord
[47:24] has done for but speaks of Jacob there
[47:26] in Deuteronomy we know that that speaks
[47:28] about us and a believer lives in a very
[47:30] different kind of atmosphere and place
[47:32] than people in the world and this is if
[47:35] I could say this you know where are you
[47:38] living today now yeah I'm going to show
[47:40] you two photos and this is basically my
[47:42] entire sermon right here now this is the
[47:45] children of the bondwoman now this is
[47:48] not a barnyard maybe you know you'd have
[47:50] a free-range chicken but a chicken is
[47:52] still stuck behind the fence
[47:53] it's not it's earthbound that's not free
[47:56] to soar in the heavenly Amen it's stuck
[47:59] in a man man-made device just as just as
[48:02] these chickens are here that's like a
[48:04] battery farm but they're but they're in
[48:05] a cage now a cage there's many different
[48:09] cages in the land today but legalism and
[48:13] liberalism are both cages I mean we want
[48:16] to go beyond just just being earthbound
[48:19] and stuck in some kind of cage God
[48:21] doesn't want us bound God wants a
[48:23] soaring in the heavenlies with heaven
[48:25] I mean that's what he wants he doesn't
[48:26] want us to be stuck in you know rats can
[48:29] go through their mice can go through
[48:30] their anything can go through those
[48:32] cages and the things trapped account it
[48:34] can overcome and it can't fly above it
[48:36] but that's not where we mean to be I
[48:38] mean this is what this this is not what
[48:41] this message is called us to become as
[48:43] we start to be an earthbound creature
[48:44] we're called to soar without with our
[48:46] Poppa God Alleluia so is that where
[48:50] you're living or is this where you're
[48:52] living
[48:53] Alleluia now this is the this is the
[48:55] question this is an eagle's nest high up
[48:57] in a harp and a mountain place amen you
[49:00] see it's not there's no cage around it
[49:02] there's just blue sky hallelujah is just
[49:04] up in the mountain they can see for
[49:06] miles around holily there's no rats or
[49:09] any things of any devils going to get
[49:11] into that kind of mess hallelujah that's
[49:14] where that's where God's free born
[49:15] children are meant to dwell that's where
[49:18] we're meant to dwell so where are you
[49:22] where are you going I mean where are you
[49:24] living because freedom you know people
[49:28] speak of being free in Christ and the
[49:29] whole pretty much the whole church will
[49:31] say we are free but what does it mean to
[49:34] be free because some people say well
[49:36] we're free that means they can do what
[49:38] they want but that's not real freedom
[49:40] real freedom is to fly with him I mean
[49:43] because people are still a lot of people
[49:45] say well Randa oh well just gonna I'll
[49:49] find it first I'm gonna jump around a
[49:51] bit but hey now here in Romans what are
[49:54] we free from we're free from sin Christ
[49:58] makes us free from sin and the
[50:00] attributes thereof he doesn't we don't
[50:03] just say we're free but we're still
[50:04] balland those chickens would say well
[50:06] you know look we're we're we've got a
[50:10] roof over our head we're being protected
[50:12] we're being fed you know we're we're not
[50:15] out you know being being under attacked
[50:17] by predators so we're kind of free in
[50:19] that way but they're bound a man they're
[50:22] still back we're not called to be bound
[50:24] when I could just a beast you know you
[50:26] know eat some little old you know stuff
[50:29] that man just puts out and stuck there
[50:30] in a cage and that's not what life is to
[50:32] be amen so now I'll come back to all
[50:36] that later but it says in Romans 6 it
[50:41] says now freedom real freedom us to be
[50:43] free from sin real freedom is to be free
[50:47] from the effects of sin that's real
[50:48] freedom amen and Christ died to give us
[50:51] that freedom he didn't die just for us
[50:54] to have some religion and talk about it
[50:55] he died that we would experience
[50:57] actually live out freedom hallelujah
[51:01] because man has always been bound since
[51:03] the fall in the garden man has been a
[51:05] slave I mean but our Lord Jesus came to
[51:08] die on Calvary arose again over hell
[51:11] death and the grave triumphant that you
[51:13] would be free as he is free amen and
[51:16] this message is come in this in time to
[51:18] show you this is what freedom really is
[51:20] I mean this is what freedom that's more
[51:22] than just talking about it
[51:24] I mean it's living it I mean like a
[51:26] prisoner a prisoner in a Cell they can
[51:28] sit there and they can talk about what
[51:30] it's like to be free but when the gate
[51:31] comes open hallelujah and then the
[51:34] warden or whatever says now you're free
[51:35] to go hallelujah Amen I bet you I don't
[51:39] think there'd be any real prisoner and
[51:41] their right mind that would be said to
[51:42] walk out of their cells
[51:44] matter how long they've been in there
[51:46] how much how nice it may have been you
[51:48] know anyone in their right mind would
[51:49] say now I'm free hallelujah and it's the
[51:53] same thing with you and I friends I
[51:54] trust you should I pray you know the
[51:56] freedom the real liberty that's in
[51:59] Christ Jesus our Lord
[52:00] that you can live and you do I pray by
[52:03] the power of his blood above sin above
[52:06] this flesh hallelujah this is what
[52:09] Christianity is about it's not just
[52:11] being bogged down by you know just a
[52:15] religion or whatever more he's a real
[52:16] Liberty it's a real Liberty so he sees
[52:20] he that is deed it's freed from sin now
[52:24] if we be dead with Christ we believe we
[52:27] shall also live with him now if you'll
[52:29] really did you're free from sin amen I'm
[52:33] nothing about you know if you've really
[52:34] died out to yourself really died out
[52:37] being born again a real birth a real new
[52:39] birth you're free from sin if you did
[52:42] you got to be dead I mean you got to
[52:46] really die out to everything you think
[52:47] everything you once loves all of your
[52:50] ambitions hopes and plans and your pride
[52:52] and everything you think you are yeah
[52:54] it's got to be dead it's going to be
[52:56] dead and done away with hallelujah and
[52:58] that's what's our glorious God is here
[53:00] to give us that it's not something we
[53:03] could never obtain - that's why he died
[53:05] that we could have it he died two places
[53:07] and man's hand again you can be free
[53:09] from the effects of the devil you can be
[53:11] free from this bondage you can be free
[53:13] from everything he tries to put down
[53:15] your throat you can be free and not just
[53:17] a part time freedom all the time free
[53:20] hallelujah Jesus himself said whom the
[53:22] son is set free is free indeed
[53:24] that's not partially free that's not
[53:27] well negotiate and you can have weekends
[53:29] and all over the week free and D
[53:31] hallelujah this is what the power of the
[53:33] Cross does and it's got to be more than
[53:35] a talking about it it's got to be a live
[53:37] it's going to be something we actually
[53:39] have and I and I believe with all my
[53:42] soul we have the the powers present in
[53:44] this word and this entire message to
[53:48] free people amen
[53:51] hey that is dead is freed from sin now
[53:54] if we be dead with Christ we believe we
[53:57] shall also live with him knowing that
[54:00] Christ being raised from the dead dies
[54:01] no more death hath no more dominion over
[54:04] him for in that he died he died under
[54:07] sin once but in that he liveth he liveth
[54:10] under God
[54:11] likewise Rick and he also yourselves to
[54:13] be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto
[54:16] God through Jesus Christ our Lord now
[54:18] that's not just mental gymnastics it's
[54:21] got to become a reality no we go again
[54:28] does this died on me yeah we know
[54:34] alright let not sin therefore reign over
[54:37] your mortal body that you should obey it
[54:41] in the lusts thereof neither yield ye
[54:43] your members as instruments of
[54:44] unrighteousness understand but yield
[54:47] yourselves unto God as those that are
[54:49] alive from the dead and your members as
[54:52] instruments of righteousness under God
[54:54] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[54:57] for ye are not under the law but under
[54:59] grace
[55:00] now this is the definition of grace
[55:03] straight from the Strong's Concordance
[55:04] of this this here grace under grace and
[55:09] you'll find this in the New Testament
[55:10] find this in the Old Testament see it's
[55:14] here
[55:14] I know I've showed this many times so I
[55:16] wonder they're really there now if
[55:17] you're under the law I mean if you're
[55:19] not under the law something's happened
[55:20] to you I mean something's happened to
[55:23] you as I said you can be liberal and be
[55:25] under the law you can be legal and be
[55:26] under the law but if you're really free
[55:28] from it
[55:29] something's happened to your soul
[55:31] something's happened to you
[55:33] so he said graciousness as gratifying of
[55:36] manner or act abstract or concrete
[55:38] literal figurative spiritual especially
[55:41] I love this word especially especially
[55:43] the divine influence upon the heart and
[55:46] it's reflection in the life this is what
[55:49] the definition of Grace's is a divine
[55:52] influence I mean has come upon the heart
[55:54] of the you know of the believer and it's
[55:57] reflected in the life so it's not just
[55:59] saying our grace grace God's grace
[56:01] there's a reflection
[56:03] I mean as a manifestation grace has come
[56:06] upon me God's grace is falling on me and
[56:09] my life is reflecting that Christ
[56:11] hallelujah amen
[56:13] that's like an eagle who's been in a
[56:15] chicken coop in the grace of the mother
[56:18] Eagle comes I mean she flies over there
[56:20] kept looking for a child
[56:22] I mean begins to scream out that Eagle
[56:24] begins to look up I mean there's a
[56:26] divine influence begins to move
[56:28] hallelujah and that chopping is to
[56:30] recognize I'm not meant to be down here
[56:32] can you imagine living in this kind of
[56:35] place and you're not even built to live
[56:36] in this place can you imagine living
[56:39] there and and and your body is not built
[56:41] to digest the food your body is not
[56:44] built to be in a cage like that
[56:46] hallelujah imagine living in that kind
[56:48] of place that's how every man woman and
[56:49] child is amen but in there yeah in among
[56:54] humanity it's not just all chickens
[56:57] you're an eagle and the chicken and the
[56:58] same kind of bird I mean I mean they are
[57:00] birds I mean they are the same kind of
[57:02] family tree or wolf whatever you want to
[57:05] call it but an eagle is different to a
[57:07] chicken I mean a chicken you know it
[57:10] just scavengers around and eat seeds and
[57:13] different things and eagles not built
[57:14] that way an eagle and a chicken is more
[57:17] of an earthbound kind of creature Eagles
[57:19] are not earthbound creatures they called
[57:21] the sore upon the heavenlies I mean I
[57:23] remember the first Eagle I ever saw some
[57:25] Papua New Guinea and it was high up and
[57:27] just had its wings fixed and was just I
[57:29] was just soaring straight across the
[57:31] across the sky as fast but it wasn't
[57:34] even flapping trying to mention a
[57:36] chicken trying to get up here flapping
[57:37] its little wings as high as it could go
[57:39] I think you're just sets of wings
[57:41] soils and heavily hallelujah and that's
[57:44] what we mean to be that's what God has
[57:46] called us to be God and God did not make
[57:48] us he did not design men to be in a
[57:51] battery farm like this of life amen
[57:54] imagine being an eagle stuck in that
[57:55] kind of place you'd get around you'd
[57:58] feel sick amen you know you you're
[58:00] trying to digest the food because it's
[58:02] all you have you're trying to find
[58:03] something to sustain you amen and you
[58:06] got these big wings you can't even move
[58:08] because you're stuck in this kind of
[58:09] cage but then one day mama comes
[58:13] amen and you begin to realize this is
[58:16] actually what I mean to be this is what
[58:18] I mean to be I'm not meant to be a
[58:20] chicken stuck there just to be you know
[58:23] a production-line kind of person I meant
[58:26] to soar in the heavenlies hallelujah but
[58:29] it's only when grace comes I just leave
[58:32] that up for maybe a few moment I want
[58:34] you I want everyone to read that again
[58:35] especially the divine influence upon the
[58:39] heart and its reflection in the life do
[58:42] you know grace do you know the grace of
[58:45] God God's grace is not oh I can do what
[58:48] I want and he'll forgive me later
[58:49] no it's a divine influence comes upon
[58:51] you I mean that whatever his word wants
[58:54] you to do you're yes Lord yes Lord your
[58:57] smallest your your smallest desire
[59:00] because my greatest command you're a
[59:02] greatest commandment to me because I
[59:03] love you I want to fulfill your word I
[59:06] don't just want to have a casual kind of
[59:08] relationship with you I want my whole
[59:10] life to manifest you I want my whole
[59:12] life to glorify you hallelujah
[59:15] but pride stops that many times self
[59:17] ability stops that many times what we
[59:19] think we are
[59:20] amen our stubbornness stops grace really
[59:22] manifesting in our lives and her and the
[59:25] only person we rub ourselves off as
[59:27] ourselves imagine imagine earth chicken
[59:30] I mean an eagle a proud eagle stuck in
[59:32] here mother comes flying over
[59:35] you mean to soar with me little child
[59:39] Eagle get sprout what do you mean I'm
[59:41] I'm the king of this place because all
[59:44] the chickens are scared of Eagles I'm
[59:45] the king of this place I have great
[59:47] influence down here what do you mean you
[59:49] I meant to soar with you I'm doing
[59:51] perfectly fine down here and the pride
[59:53] of that little Eagle will keep it
[59:54] earthbound don't let your pride keep you
[59:57] stuck earthbound you say Lord you want
[1:00:00] me I'm built this Saul with you I'm
[1:00:02] going to soar with you hallelujah
[1:00:05] I would not be stuck down here on the
[1:00:09] earth God has not made us to be
[1:00:11] earthbound creatures I mean when the
[1:00:14] devil just comes in rats come in mice
[1:00:16] come in Devils come in do whatever they
[1:00:19] want to our lives
[1:00:20] I mean that's not where I mean to be
[1:00:23] amen we're eager you know one of God's
[1:00:26] eat
[1:00:26] I mean the saw said why's he called you
[1:00:29] isn't cool you just refer you to look up
[1:00:31] and see him there I mean he called you
[1:00:32] that you would begin to flap some wings
[1:00:34] flap your wings your god-given winter
[1:00:37] faith
[1:00:37] I mean soar up into the heavenlies with
[1:00:39] them you say well is that there's the
[1:00:43] case let's go here amen
[1:00:46] divine influence upon the heart and its
[1:00:47] reflection in the life that's grace that
[1:00:50] is what grace means in the Greek and I
[1:00:53] say Amen I mean since God's grace has
[1:00:57] gotta fall upon you because if it's not
[1:00:59] reflected if this word if you're still
[1:01:01] fighting the scripture I mean grace is
[1:01:04] not fallen upon you because it's not our
[1:01:07] reflection of it in your life I mean
[1:01:09] when someone when the grace of God falls
[1:01:11] upon someone repented me baptized name
[1:01:13] of Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:15] partly that's reflected yes flood I
[1:01:17] wanna be buried with you I want to be
[1:01:19] identified with you
[1:01:20] Amen there's a life of holiness to live
[1:01:22] amen hallelujah I want to dress the way
[1:01:26] is pleasing to you don't act the way
[1:01:27] that's pleasing because it's a
[1:01:29] reflection and the life it's not because
[1:01:31] I've got to do this because there's no
[1:01:33] it's being reflected the grace of God is
[1:01:35] reflected in your life oh how glad I am
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen you take someone it
[1:01:43] depends what spirits in you you take

[1:06:06] well I'm identified Amen with Legion in
[1:06:09] the tombs
[1:06:10] I'm identified with a bunch of
[1:06:12] illiterate fisherman who became the
[1:06:14] apostles I'm identified with those in
[1:06:16] the apple room who bother approach
[1:06:18] hallelujah
[1:06:19] I identified with all the believers down
[1:06:21] through with all their glory
[1:06:24] everything that they did all their shame
[1:06:25] whatever people said about them I'd be
[1:06:27] proud to be there in the upper room I'd
[1:06:30] be proud to be identified with the
[1:06:31] apostles in the first age wouldn't you
[1:06:34] now here's a bit of a stinger you say
[1:06:38] yeah
[1:06:38] be proud but what about today because if
[1:06:41] you're not proud to be identified with
[1:06:42] the word in this day you wouldn't stand
[1:06:43] with it in that day it's that simple
[1:06:46] now Ephesians 1:24 and you had he
[1:06:51] quickened who once in the battery farm
[1:06:56] I'm just going to read it a bit
[1:06:57] differently just keep that picture of
[1:06:59] the chickens in there and you have a
[1:07:01] quick and maid of life who once in the
[1:07:03] battery farm dead in trespasses and sins
[1:07:06] where in times past you're stuck in a
[1:07:08] barnyard coop thinking this is what
[1:07:11] you'll mean to be amen
[1:07:14] thinking what you mean to be we're an
[1:07:17] entire space you walked according to the
[1:07:18] course of this world according to the
[1:07:20] farmer who just feed you all this old
[1:07:21] food all the time according to the
[1:07:23] Prince of the power of the year this is
[1:07:25] what we once were hallelujah the spirit
[1:07:28] that now worketh in the children of
[1:07:30] disobedience among whom also you all had
[1:07:34] your conversation in times past this is
[1:07:36] where you used to live and the chicken
[1:07:37] coop amen and times past in the lusts of
[1:07:42] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:07:45] flesh and of the mind now that's just
[1:07:48] more than going and committing adultery
[1:07:49] fornication whatever will that's
[1:07:51] pandering to the sky I don't feel like
[1:07:54] going I don't feel like doing this
[1:07:55] you're pandering to this I'll look like
[1:07:58] some old some old model somewhere who's
[1:08:00] who's out of date with clothing and
[1:08:02] fashion that's pandering to this amen
[1:08:06] fulfilling of the flesh and of the mind
[1:08:08] and we're by nature the children of
[1:08:10] Wrath even as even as others see you in
[1:08:13] the coop but God who's Richard mercy for
[1:08:17] his great love we're and he loved us
[1:08:18] came searching for you hallelujah
[1:08:22] even when you were dead in sins hath
[1:08:24] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:08:26] grace you're saved
[1:08:28] divine influence comes upon you o God
[1:08:30] forgive me of my sins amen the cross is
[1:08:33] not a story just a story it's a reality
[1:08:36] it's not just something of history
[1:08:39] hallelujah raises up together and made
[1:08:42] us sit together in heavenly places in
[1:08:44] Christ Jesus taking you from the
[1:08:46] barnyard up into the heavenlies because
[1:08:48] heavenly places the believers position
[1:08:50] in Christ this is where
[1:08:51] wants you to be that an ages to come he
[1:08:53] might show the exceeding riches of his
[1:08:55] grace and his kindness towards us
[1:08:57] through Christ Jesus for by grace you
[1:09:00] saved through faith and it's not of
[1:09:02] yourselves as a gift of God not of works
[1:09:04] lest any man should boast for we are his
[1:09:07] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:09:09] good works which God hath before
[1:09:11] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:09:14] that God has ordained that you would fly
[1:09:16] with him in the heavenlies and that's
[1:09:18] what he's ordained you to be so friends
[1:09:22] it's got to come a sanctification it's
[1:09:25] got to be a cleansing and a sitting
[1:09:26] apart you have to be cleanse from the
[1:09:28] world you can't you can't take the world
[1:09:31] and bring it into Christ I mean so he's
[1:09:33] got a change if there's something in
[1:09:35] your heart that is fighting against his
[1:09:37] word you have to say Lord change my
[1:09:39] heart that I will live your word
[1:09:41] I mean God just doesn't exclude some
[1:09:44] parts of a scripture not to you because
[1:09:46] you say I'm not ready to do it you have
[1:09:49] to say Lord take my heart cleanse it
[1:09:52] that there's nothing in me that fights
[1:09:54] you because if you fight us word you're
[1:09:56] fighting him
[1:09:58] amen and gods and Paul sit with the
[1:10:00] missile the Ministry of reconciliation I
[1:10:03] mean to be reconciled to God that's not
[1:10:06] God doesn't have to change it's us it
[1:10:09] has to change
[1:10:09] I mean if there's something in our
[1:10:11] hearts that says no I will not live your
[1:10:13] word God you have to say Lord take that
[1:10:15] out of me because all that is is the
[1:10:18] barnyard trying to pin you down on the
[1:10:20] earth that is not your portion friend
[1:10:23] you've got to say Lord take it out of me
[1:10:25] I want to fly with you amen it has to be
[1:10:29] that way it has to be a cleansing you
[1:10:31] may come out of Egypt but Egypt has got
[1:10:33] to come out of you and then you've got
[1:10:34] to cross Jordan to get the self and go
[1:10:36] into the Promised Land hallelujah that's
[1:10:39] what he wants us to do that's not as I
[1:10:42] said legalisms a cage liberalism's a
[1:10:44] cage walk out of the cage
[1:10:47] amen fly with him don't have anything
[1:10:51] against God's Word in your heart
[1:10:53] whatever you do kick it out because that
[1:10:56] is the devil robbing you of soaring in
[1:10:59] the heavenlies don't let the devil rob
[1:11:01] you don't let them rob you
[1:11:04] he wants her do you think he wants God's
[1:11:06] children to fly free what is his plan
[1:11:10] all of God's children I'm going to drag
[1:11:13] with me down to a lake of fire and they
[1:11:15] will not they will not be free sin since
[1:11:18] shackles will never be broken this is
[1:11:20] what he this is his purpose when he came
[1:11:23] against Eve and made man fall that was
[1:11:26] his best shot because he knew if I can
[1:11:28] get the whole of humanity board and said
[1:11:31] lost and undone separated from God then
[1:11:34] I've got them hallelujah this is what he
[1:11:37] wanted this is his purpose amen and the
[1:11:39] Lord knew that it would happen and your
[1:11:42] oughta happen he wasn't scared and
[1:11:43] wringing his hands when the fall
[1:11:45] happened in Eden he knew was going to
[1:11:46] happen they meant he and he had already
[1:11:49] provided a way of redemption back
[1:11:53] hallelujah and so now and so now that's
[1:11:56] why that's why that's the devil's
[1:11:58] purpose but what is God's purpose now I
[1:12:00] want my children by me I want my bride
[1:12:03] by me that where I am they will be also
[1:12:05] I mean I want them to soar with me I
[1:12:08] want to show my power you know a mother
[1:12:10] or a father Eagle they're in their nest
[1:12:12] they can't have a relationship with
[1:12:14] their child that's down in the boneyard
[1:12:15] I mean they've got to bring the child to
[1:12:17] where to where they are hallelujah
[1:12:20] because just like any parent they want
[1:12:22] to express themselves their children
[1:12:24] they want to make themselves known to
[1:12:25] their children I mean their character
[1:12:28] their nature everything they can do they
[1:12:30] want their children to look up and have
[1:12:32] confidence in them mommy and daddy know
[1:12:34] what your they've got it in control
[1:12:36] hallelujah Amy it's just like great
[1:12:39] great Jehovah regal Amy remember Jehovah
[1:12:42] the Old Testament Jesus Christ her than
[1:12:44] you I mean he wants to gather us lift us
[1:12:47] up hallelujah
[1:12:48] begin to show himself shows power amen
[1:12:52] yes what he wants to do now sinners
[1:12:58] unbelief it's that simple
[1:13:02] sinners unbelief does Jesus Christ the
[1:13:05] same in 1963 now we all know that
[1:13:08] sinners unbelief he that believeth not
[1:13:10] is condemned already now sin is the
[1:13:13] attribute of unbelief smoking cigarettes
[1:13:16] is not a sense
[1:13:17] is not a sin lying is not a sin commit
[1:13:20] committing adultery is not a sin what is
[1:13:22] it then you'd say it's the attributes of
[1:13:25] unbelief if you're a believer you could
[1:13:27] not do those things amen
[1:13:30] if you remember when grace comes in when
[1:13:34] grace fully comes in and it's manifested
[1:13:36] in the life your life is different
[1:13:38] there's got to be a difference amen and
[1:13:41] sin has to go hallelujah sin has to go
[1:13:44] if faith comes in unbelief goes out amen
[1:13:48] so if you are now filled with faith
[1:13:50] Amen then there's attributes of faith
[1:13:52] that are now manifested your life is
[1:13:54] different
[1:13:55] that's the attributes of unbelief if
[1:13:57] you're a believer you could not do those
[1:13:58] things the reason you do it proves
[1:14:00] you're an unbeliever now this may
[1:14:02] scratch it but but I just I just want
[1:14:03] you to you know you got to look at the
[1:14:05] devil will make you think you're a
[1:14:07] believer and everything's fine amen
[1:14:10] he will actually think make you think
[1:14:13] you're fine when you're still in the
[1:14:14] barnyard he will lie to you saying no
[1:14:17] everything's fine you don't want to be
[1:14:19] stuck in that category amen don't let
[1:14:23] him lie to you
[1:14:24] yeah we are call to fly with walk with
[1:14:27] God hallelujah are you following me
[1:14:31] now the reason you do it proves you're
[1:14:33] an unbeliever there's only two factions
[1:14:36] that's either you're a believer or not a
[1:14:38] believer and how it always possibly that
[1:14:40] a man could claim to have the Holy Ghost
[1:14:42] in them and deny the word being true
[1:14:45] amen hey you may stumble I'll just say
[1:14:47] this you may stumble and fall right but
[1:14:51] that's different then actually it's
[1:14:53] actually just having unbelief in your
[1:14:54] life working amen
[1:14:57] that's two different things so I want I
[1:14:59] want you to settle that in your mind but
[1:15:01] you say he says now it always puzzled me
[1:15:04] that a man could claim to have the Holy
[1:15:06] Ghost and deny the word of God being
[1:15:08] true now well how do people say what's
[1:15:11] not true they just don't throw it out
[1:15:13] they just say well that's just not for
[1:15:14] me and that is the same as saying it's
[1:15:17] not true amen
[1:15:19] it's just as the same as saying it's not
[1:15:21] true see now when the Holy Ghost itself
[1:15:27] wrote the word of God do you believe it
[1:15:29] do you believe all was poor
[1:15:31] and John and Moses and whoever more know
[1:15:33] God took people use their well I'm
[1:15:37] left-handed but maybe most yeah whatever
[1:15:39] but I pass this and begin to write that
[1:15:42] was God writing this is God riding
[1:15:44] through me he may have used men but this
[1:15:46] is God's words it's not Moses and Isaiah
[1:15:49] in different one this is God writing
[1:15:52] hallelujah so he wrote the scriptures
[1:15:54] and he stands by the scriptures and God
[1:15:56] watches over them to confirm them now
[1:16:02] this isn't why in 1963 I believe in this
[1:16:05] old-time Holy Ghost salvation oh brother
[1:16:08] sister it does something to you the same
[1:16:10] God loved one time still lives today
[1:16:13] his same his same doctrine of holiness
[1:16:15] just lives tonight is the same as it
[1:16:17] ever lived just the same thing yes sir
[1:16:19] notice the people has got away from the
[1:16:21] doctrine over that's all now now yes sir
[1:16:25] number our number one heart disease
[1:16:28] doesn't the main thing that kills people
[1:16:31] today it's number one is the sin disease
[1:16:33] and sin is unbelief I'm believing what
[1:16:35] the Bible that's right yes it's the
[1:16:37] number one sin disease that kills the
[1:16:40] people today both spiritually and
[1:16:41] they'll make them kill them physically
[1:16:43] of course cuz they already can prove
[1:16:46] that man that holds grudges and woman
[1:16:49] who fussing stew and fighting argue they
[1:16:51] die it'll cause cancer fungus everything
[1:16:55] else will sit and ulcers see you were
[1:16:57] made to be happy and free you were made
[1:17:02] to live like children before your father
[1:17:04] and know that he makes every day
[1:17:06] everything work out for you each day yes
[1:17:08] sir
[1:17:09] the people's just afraid of this new
[1:17:11] birth that's all they're afraid to come
[1:17:13] to it because it'll straighten them up
[1:17:17] amen
[1:17:19] that's what people are afraid of it you
[1:17:21] say well how could how could temper and
[1:17:24] fussing and grudges cause disease well a
[1:17:27] merry heart does good like a medicine
[1:17:30] but the other one drop the bones yeah it
[1:17:33] does bad you see people who are always
[1:17:35] always so tense and anger and different
[1:17:37] things it begins to manifest physically
[1:17:39] in their bodies amen so that's why of
[1:17:43] course and this sin causes this thing
[1:17:46] this is not where we call now whenever
[1:17:49] I'm just you're going down this line
[1:17:50] just think chicken coop okay just think
[1:17:53] chicken coop battery farm this is no way
[1:17:56] we're cool tool if we're not cool to
[1:17:59] live in those kind of places we have to
[1:18:02] we are called to live in the heavenlies
[1:18:04] with him amen
[1:18:07] this is where we're not called to be be
[1:18:09] dictated to by the spirit of this world
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:17] now you notice an eagle it lives
[1:18:22] wait where we will go back I think an
[1:18:26] eagle builds its nest high up off the
[1:18:28] ground high up off the ground it doesn't
[1:18:31] put its nest on the ground it puts it in
[1:18:34] a different atmosphere then then we're
[1:18:37] the chickens look they're both bullets
[1:18:39] but Eagles live in a totally different
[1:18:41] realm that a chicken knows nothing about
[1:18:43] now an eagle can think it's a chicken
[1:18:48] but a chicken can even become an eagle
[1:18:51] amen and it's like when we were born in
[1:18:53] this world we were chickens we thought
[1:18:57] we were chickens they meant we thought
[1:19:00] this was this is our lot in life and
[1:19:01] this is just the well we've got to get a
[1:19:03] good job and get the mortgage in the end
[1:19:06] and in the quarter acre section and all
[1:19:08] that you know living the family or
[1:19:10] whatever the American dream or the Kiwi
[1:19:11] dream or whatever you know it's it's
[1:19:14] this is this is what we've got to do but
[1:19:17] that's just that we're not cool to live
[1:19:19] like this we got the call to live in a
[1:19:22] different atmosphere and so we can we
[1:19:24] were born that way thinking this is our
[1:19:26] lot in life maybe join a church have
[1:19:28] some kind of religion but there's a big
[1:19:30] difference from having a religion than
[1:19:32] really walking with him it's a totally
[1:19:34] different thing hallelujah
[1:19:36] and we're not called just to just to
[1:19:38] have a religion he wants us to fly with
[1:19:40] him I remember now there comes a point
[1:19:43] now where we're like this little baby in
[1:19:46] the little baby in the in the nest here
[1:19:49] now this one I don't think and slide you
[1:19:51] see it
[1:19:51] but there comes a time with a little
[1:19:53] baby II who can actually fly that's got
[1:19:56] feathers now the nest
[1:19:58] Eagle's Nest a very big if you go google
[1:20:00] it they're actually very big very big
[1:20:02] places and there's and and the mother
[1:20:05] Eagle puts like rabbit skins and
[1:20:07] different things in it to keep it nice
[1:20:08] and soft but there comes a time where
[1:20:10] now baby Eagles gotta fly
[1:20:12] and then now mother you'll begin to stir
[1:20:15] up the nest and take out all the
[1:20:17] comforts you know when we started you
[1:20:18] know when you first had a walk with the
[1:20:20] Lord everything was glorious
[1:20:21] I pray it still is but it comes a time
[1:20:23] when the nest begins to be stood up
[1:20:25] because he doesn't want you to sit in
[1:20:27] the nest and I praise the Lord Here I am
[1:20:29] a my little list he wants you to fly he
[1:20:31] wants you to exercise your faith he
[1:20:34] wants you to really say do you trust me
[1:20:36] and when you imagine mother Eagle
[1:20:38] because you're about this big mother you
[1:20:39] will be massive to you flies them with
[1:20:41] these big wings lands and flaps and
[1:20:43] wings and you get kind of blown across
[1:20:44] than this and she begin to say I'm Your
[1:20:47] Mother you say men I'm all-powerful
[1:20:50] hallelujah amen amen I'm the same

[1:20:54] he's Jehovah regal he doesn't talk to
[1:20:57] you I mean I'm the same yesterday today
[1:20:59] and forever amen
[1:21:00] I took you out of the barnyard ain't in
[1:21:03] daddy hallelujah I've been lifted up in
[1:21:05] the cleft of the rock and the secret
[1:21:07] place how hiders were your dwelling amen

[1:21:11] I'm your provider Amen Lord yes you are
[1:21:14] hallelujah you are I'm looking after you
[1:21:17] I'm nourishing you in the face yes look
[1:21:19] I want you to be like me Amen but then
[1:21:23] now here comes the okay do what does
[1:21:25] that entail because mama or daddy flies
[1:21:28] and you're stuck in a nest
[1:21:31] and you may watch him go up and do
[1:21:34] everything but now I want you to be like
[1:21:36] me now here comes the nest during time
[1:21:41] the baby has a lot of loose feathers we
[1:21:45] don't want to have loose but the mother
[1:21:47] knows if that baby's got loose feathers
[1:21:50] and they begin to fly those feathers
[1:21:53] will come out and the baby won't be able
[1:21:54] to fly it will crash and die it's the
[1:21:57] same thing with us it comes a time when
[1:22:00] we have to fly where it's more than just
[1:22:02] argument and debate and as this Wright
[1:22:05] and his brother burn right here and
[1:22:07] right here now he wants us to fly to go
[1:22:09] beyond our human opinion
[1:22:11] of dismiss as you say this is you Lord

[1:22:16] is the Son of man being revealed this is
[1:22:19] Jesus Christ walking this generation I

[1:22:25] something else it's heaven amen
[1:22:28] so there comes a time when we're going
[1:22:30] to recognize this and then us now so now
[1:22:32] daddy's like okay now you're gonna fly
[1:22:34] but there has to be a nice during
[1:22:38] hallelujah there's got to be a lot of
[1:22:40] loose feathers they've got to be dug out
[1:22:43] of you now see if I can find this one I
[1:22:47] hope you don't mind the reading we we
[1:22:50] called the fly don't be earthbound he
[1:22:54] says now this live little eagle as she's
[1:22:57] done that purposely so this is to stir
[1:23:01] up the nest because God doesn't want to
[1:23:03] suggest it he doesn't want to suggest it
[1:23:05] to this world no matter how nice it may
[1:23:07] be going for you he doesn't want us to
[1:23:09] be adjusted here I mean he wants us to
[1:23:11] fly we're gonna the church is gonna take
[1:23:13] a flight one of these days and then the
[1:23:15] bride is gonna be lifted off this earth
[1:23:17] hallelujah and each one has to exercise
[1:23:19] how when's your faith
[1:23:21] Amen that an Irish or damn bobbed off
[1:23:22] but they're long and flowing and
[1:23:24] beautiful amen he got power and those
[1:23:26] wings to fly no it's just a little eagle
[1:23:30] she's done that purposely so he wouldn't
[1:23:32] get adjusted to that nest he's an eagle
[1:23:34] he's not a chicken she wanted him to get
[1:23:37] out of there so he can trust his own so
[1:23:39] after a while he just can't sit down
[1:23:41] it's at that time of life of this person
[1:23:44] saying this and this is going on here
[1:23:46] and and and you're jumping around the
[1:23:48] nest because there's no comfortable son
[1:23:49] and I thought this is the one and what's
[1:23:51] all going on what's happening the nest
[1:23:53] is being stood up and you're hopping
[1:23:54] around from from one stick to to another
[1:23:57] stick to another branch and huh and then
[1:23:59] well there's a purpose for at all he
[1:24:02] wants you to fly he doesn't want you in
[1:24:04] the nest the nest is not the end of it's
[1:24:07] not your destination just a sit cook
[1:24:10] there and not use your wings and let
[1:24:12] everyone else take care of it
[1:24:13] I mean there comes a time when everyone
[1:24:15] has to supply their their gift to the
[1:24:17] body and it's not what I can get
[1:24:19] what can I give I mean that's how it has
[1:24:22] to be
[1:24:22] you can't just sit back and say well
[1:24:24] this person doesn't do this and this
[1:24:25] doesn't know what can you give this is
[1:24:29] what the every gift in the body if one
[1:24:31] has a gift in the body and that gift is
[1:24:33] not for you it's for others and the gift
[1:24:36] of them is not for themselves as for
[1:24:37] others and you have to be God God
[1:24:40] doesn't want us to be a bunch of
[1:24:41] individuals he wants us to work together
[1:24:43] as a body but pride will keep us as an
[1:24:46] individual amen I prayed God just go
[1:24:50] down into every heart just now pride is

[1:26:26] you could say the the evolution of
[1:26:28] technology matches what God is doing in
[1:26:31] the spirit realm a seed it began just
[1:26:33] with the horse and buggy just with like
[1:26:36] now I may get this rhombus like Luther
[1:26:38] or Weasley horse-and-buggy age and then
[1:26:40] there was the auto mirror yeah that was
[1:26:42] Luther than the Ottoman order of mobile
[1:26:44] age with vo with cars and everything
[1:26:46] that was that was Wesley then the
[1:26:48] Pentecostals was now the airplane age
[1:26:50] where where people begin to fly but they
[1:26:54] were so so now they're off the ground
[1:26:56] hallelujah
[1:26:57] you're like manifesting and so the
[1:26:59] spreading poured out amen but they're
[1:27:01] still being dictated to by the
[1:27:03] atmosphere amen of Lee what's the
[1:27:06] weather conditions doing it's too windy
[1:27:08] I'll stay down here the head of my plane
[1:27:10] is going to crash amen
[1:27:12] but he said that's not the end of it now
[1:27:13] we're in the astronaut age I mean when
[1:27:15] we go above the effects of this world
[1:27:17] through the atmosphere of this world
[1:27:19] probably even to a place where all
[1:27:21] things are possible hallelujah that's
[1:27:23] where we're cool to be and man is trying
[1:27:26] to leave the planet I mean it's because
[1:27:28] there will be a people leaving the
[1:27:30] planet one of these days but they're not
[1:27:31] going to Mars they're going to heaven
[1:27:33] hallelujah so the technology is this to
[1:27:36] the murmur of what God is doing but
[1:27:37] we're not meant to imagine imagine
[1:27:39] someone pull up at a horse-and-buggy
[1:27:40] here you'd say buddy you back in the
[1:27:44] back in the whatever eh but they're like
[1:27:47] no I'm justified by faith
[1:27:49] hallelujah God's dealing with me but
[1:27:51] they just in a horse and buggy but
[1:27:52] you've been up in space and you just
[1:27:55] come back down here to say it's

[1:28:29] little sister flying around and they're
[1:28:32] having a glorious time up there and they
[1:28:34] begin to come back and say do you know

[1:29:03] filled the Holy Spirit hallelujah
[1:29:05] to become an astronaut hallelujah and

[1:29:17] fire but when it comes to being in space
[1:29:19] oh my good say yeah that wasn't you know
[1:29:24] you talk about all the geez you got to
[1:29:25] suffer and whatever you got and then you
[1:29:27] see that and you know the acceleration

[1:29:55] it's what he's looking for
[1:29:58] Alleluia now there comes a time but God
[1:30:02] has to stir up the nest and we get all
[1:30:07] upset things are going wrong and gods
[1:30:10] causing it gods causing it because he
[1:30:12] wants to see what you gonna do but
[1:30:14] there'll come a time and I pray it does
[1:30:16] come he's gonna push you out out of the
[1:30:19] nest
[1:30:20] out of your comfort zone this is how I
[1:30:22] am and this is always yeah
[1:30:24] a baby eagle all they knows the nest all
[1:30:28] they know they don't know what it's like
[1:30:29] to be up there just like a guy with BC
[1:30:31] the horse and buggy and you know
[1:30:32] whatever they all they know is that they
[1:30:34] don't know what it's like to be in space
[1:30:36] and but the thing is if there's
[1:30:39] something in them if there's something
[1:30:41] in that horse and buggy driver that's
[1:30:43] satisfied with the horse and buggy
[1:30:44] they'll stay there they may see how
[1:30:47] great it is and how wonderful it may be
[1:30:49] even see the rocket go up I mean you see
[1:30:51] the spirit fall on someone transform and
[1:30:53] make them into a new creature there's
[1:30:55] some
[1:30:55] going up into space hallelujah they may
[1:30:58] see that but they may say well it's not
[1:31:01] for me yeah that's a lie the devil
[1:31:03] that's a lie of the devil
[1:31:05] amen he doesn't want us to stay here
[1:31:07] with a horse and buggy he doesn't want
[1:31:09] us to stay in the nest he wants us to
[1:31:11] fly that's why we're made and Eagle is
[1:31:14] built to fly and Eagle is not built to
[1:31:16] hop around on a nest and Eagle is not a
[1:31:18] Kiwi bird hallelujah you know a New
[1:31:23] Zealand had the biggest eagle in the
[1:31:24] world had the biggest eagle in the world
[1:31:27] hallelujah
[1:31:28] we still have eagles amen but we're not
[1:31:31] meant to be used to catch more go
[1:31:33] looking deep opera it's got the talons
[1:31:34] and everything their massive thing oh
[1:31:36] yeah anyway um we but we're not mean to
[1:31:40] be like little Kiwis on the come out at
[1:31:42] night cause the sun's shining you know
[1:31:45] we want to be in the sunlight we want to
[1:31:47] be in the sunlight of God's Word
[1:31:49] hallelujah we don't want to be a little
[1:31:51] Kiwi but we're called to be Eagles so
[1:31:54] why stay in the knees then it comes a
[1:31:57] time now I just read this so now yep
[1:32:03] he's an eagle so he's ready to leave
[1:32:05] this leave the nest now he's
[1:32:07] dissatisfied with these old things of
[1:32:09] the world the first thing you know she
[1:32:11] said now if he's an eagle if he stays
[1:32:13] like that all the time he'll become a
[1:32:15] chicken because it's because it's like
[1:32:19] any muscles you know if you stop using
[1:32:22] it yeah if you don't use it you lose it
[1:32:25] amen and we won't go any further into
[1:32:29] that but anyway that's the same thing
[1:32:31] with like an eagle having big wings if
[1:32:34] they don't use those muscles they'll
[1:32:35] lose the ability it's in them to fly but
[1:32:38] they need to exercise their wings
[1:32:40] Alleluia so that's why he'll become like
[1:32:42] a chicken so I've got to get him out of
[1:32:44] here give him some experience then she
[1:32:47] comes over to the nest she spreads out
[1:32:48] of great big wings oh you ought to see
[1:32:51] it my some of them Eagles stretch 14
[1:32:53] feet from tip to tip she had throw them
[1:32:55] big wings out like the Sinhala what a
[1:32:58] big scream like that she had waved them
[1:33:00] big wings them little Eagles lay back
[1:33:02] like this that wind Fanning like that
[1:33:04] then she she's brush them big wings out
[1:33:06] like that he says that's what the matter
[1:33:09] is
[1:33:09] the church today it needs a goodness
[1:33:12] stirring to get some of these loose
[1:33:14] feathers out of it maybe we want to fly
[1:33:16] out of its wings packing a chip on your
[1:33:18] on your shoulders and grudges and things
[1:33:21] like that you'll die in the flight
[1:33:23] that's a loose feather
[1:33:24] what's a grudge just a bit of
[1:33:26] unforgiveness as I said before that
[1:33:28] person looked at me funny this person
[1:33:30] didn't say hello to me this person
[1:33:31] thinks this and you put them in a box
[1:33:33] and there they are they're in liberal
[1:33:35] they're legal there whatever more and
[1:33:36] you're actually just carrying a chip on
[1:33:38] your shoulder
[1:33:39] you'll die in the flight I want to fly
[1:33:42] in the flight don't you I don't want to
[1:33:44] die I wasn't built to crash and burn I
[1:33:46] was built to soar
[1:33:48] Alleluia how can God ever have a church
[1:33:51] with signs and wonders and miracles when
[1:33:53] they're fussing one another unless I'm
[1:33:55] there and grudges grudges and everything
[1:33:56] founded up the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:33:58] like a rushing Mighty Wind fan all the
[1:34:00] differences and denominationalism and
[1:34:03] all those little loose feathers I'm les
[1:34:05] and I met you're nothing that you ought
[1:34:07] to be what the scripture said found out
[1:34:09] all the loose feathers oh my get them
[1:34:11] all tighten up because she's going to
[1:34:13] take them on a real ride pretty soon a
[1:34:16] solo oh my that solo flight the first
[1:34:19] one then she fans out of fans all the
[1:34:22] feathers out and then this just boils
[1:34:23] like that the loose feathers are flying
[1:34:25] everywhere get all the feathers flying
[1:34:27] up so they get real tight ones in there
[1:34:30] and she examines them over to see if
[1:34:32] they're ready and now there comes a
[1:34:35] point now where the mother takes the
[1:34:37] babies and puts them on her back and
[1:34:39] because they've got a hook in their bill
[1:34:41] they can hook around the around where
[1:34:43] the feather attaches to the body of the
[1:34:45] mother eagle and she lifts them up on
[1:34:46] their great big wings that's what God
[1:34:48] wants to do he doesn't want you in a
[1:34:50] nest I didn't I didn't birth you into
[1:34:53] this kingdom to keep you in a nests I
[1:34:55] brought you into this kingdom that
[1:34:57] you'll fly with me and then so she picks
[1:34:59] them up she flies up into the heavenlies
[1:35:01] and we're at the right altitude she
[1:35:04] doesn't say now hold on tight
[1:35:05] she just flips around and then they lose
[1:35:07] their grip and then now they're flying
[1:35:10] and there comes a point where maybe the
[1:35:12] mother Eagle I remember the babies they
[1:35:14] have confidence in mama because they've
[1:35:16] seen mama how she can fly hallelujah but
[1:35:19] she she shakes them off because now
[1:35:21] they've got to really really use those
[1:35:23] wings and once upon time they are
[1:35:26] standing on this thing look at me I can
[1:35:27] fly they're just standing there not even
[1:35:29] moving but now they're up in the air
[1:35:31] hallelujah this is where some of you are
[1:35:33] this morning now you're up in the air
[1:35:35] and you're flopping your wings about you
[1:35:37] just got to sit them Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:40] same yesterday today and forever I'm the
[1:35:42] Lord other heels all my diseases
[1:35:44] I'm my comforter I am my peace trust in
[1:35:46] my word God I just believe my word
[1:35:49] have faith in my word hallelujah and and
[1:35:52] in the mother's circling around them
[1:35:55] just like the Holy Ghost is circling
[1:35:56] around us holy as we're trying to get
[1:35:58] our wings just right amen and then she
[1:36:01] sweeps under there and catches them up
[1:36:02] again holy and lifts them up into the
[1:36:04] cliff to the raft hallelujah
[1:36:07] this is what our God wants to do I mean
[1:36:09] we're not earthbound creatures don't be
[1:36:12] stuck gonna don't be stuck in a in a
[1:36:14] cage of a you know a cage of Lies cage
[1:36:17] of unbelief amen as he said you know
[1:36:20] unbelief as the son it just it just
[1:36:23] manifests in a different way I mean
[1:36:26] dressing ungodly it's not the sinister
[1:36:28] unbelief smoking drinking it's not the
[1:36:30] actus the unbelief that causes those
[1:36:32] things God doesn't want us down in a
[1:36:34] chicken coop he doesn't we're not built
[1:36:38] you say well I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[1:36:40] about to close his brother car Jerry
[1:36:42] would maybe say he doesn't want to stack
[1:36:44] down on the earth just walking around
[1:36:46] while I believe the message and this is
[1:36:48] wonderful God's in a Providence you know
[1:36:50] and I can quote it back the front he
[1:36:52] wants it to be lived he doesn't just
[1:36:55] want he does he just doesn't want the
[1:36:56] illegals and nesting
[1:36:57] oh yes I think they can fly and it looks
[1:36:59] like they can fly in here they can yeah
[1:37:01] Oh yep yep they're my children and they
[1:37:03] look like me and he says now I want to
[1:37:05] prove it now I want to prove it than
[1:37:08] they like me
[1:37:08] and so he takes you up takes you up into
[1:37:11] the heavenlies checks you off parlor it
[1:37:14] stirs up an inch
[1:37:15] amen that you'll begin to fly and you'll
[1:37:18] come a point where where where the wings
[1:37:20] will Isis maneuver now they get their
[1:37:22] coordinator
[1:37:23] I mean you get a real balance in the
[1:37:25] word Alan yeah
