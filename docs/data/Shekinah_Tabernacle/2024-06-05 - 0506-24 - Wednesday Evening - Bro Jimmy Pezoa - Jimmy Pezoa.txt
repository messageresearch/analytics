talk to your people thank you Lord for all your blessings Lord just be with us in the race of the meeting Lord we ask you this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen thank you amen God bless you Saints God bless you amen let's read um the scripture here in Ephesians 6 it's a scripture that everyone knows the armor of God verse 6 um no chapter 6 verse 12 it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand and now verse 16 above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery Dart of the wicked amen you can have your seat when so the Lord put this thought in my heart like when I was supposed to preach like I don't know like one month ago or something but I got caught up in the traffic for like two hours and we triy with Stephanie to meet in the middle but she got stuck in the traffic too and with the babies at the back so I just said to her just turn around and brother Ben took the meeting that night so that that's my excuse for last Mee so I want to talk to you tonight about constant battle as Christians we having a constant battle every single day and I would say like from the day that you get baptized you are choosing as side you are saying I'm standing on this side I believe Lord Jesus I'm in this Army so the devil look at you and says okay empo you are on the you're on the wrong team now for the devil but we know that we're in the right him amen amen so from that very moment you are like signing the declaration of war amen against Satan that's right and we know that we are going to win the battle because of our Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen but there's many many little battles that probably we're going to fail but we're we're going to stand and we're going to stand again and if we fall we're going to stand because we trust in the Lord amen so like a secondary subject I want to talk also about perception right because we have faith that's the sixth sense that the lord gave us but we also have five senses that help us to connect to this realm to this world yeah and um perception in Google says that is the ability to see hear or become aware of of something through the senses yeah amen so even though we know that these senses are like very very good they're like me top your eyes can see like I don't know in how many how how do you call that thing for the cameras megapixels or something pixels we can see like way better than the cameras we can hear so much with those senses they can trick us yeah yeah Hallelujah that's right so here we have two examples like if you put a pencil inside of glass with water it's going to look that it's bent because it's just the reflection of the light in the water yeah so your eye even though it's a very good eye it can get tricked yeah that's right also when you are driving oh sorry when you are driving and you can see like there is full with water and as you drive you see that the water is just moving and moving and there's actually no water yeah it's just um a mirage that thing thank you brother now here in India they have like a story about people being blind but they were all touching an elephant yeah the person that was touching the elephant by the tail probably he thought man this is a rope the other one that was touching the body man this is a wall yeah the other one that was touching the ear this is a fan the other one that was touching the leg this is a tree the other one touching the the Tusk that's you call this is a spear and the other one touching the trunk thought there was a snake but if you put everything together is that how you can get the reality of the thing yeah but if you just look under your own perception you can get trick that's why God giv us to us give to us faith which is this six sense amen Hebrews uh Hebrews 111 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen what a beautiful thing yeah so here we have shedrach Mish in aedo in the fiery fness what what they were able to see it was fire what they were able to smell like something burning while they were able to hear something crackling it was very hot that was the sensus but what face told them you can get out of here hallelujah I'm going to be with you and that's why they just jumped there they knew that was something else another example here says um Moses by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season steaming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward man I really wouldn't say that I can have the same Faith the Moses had in that moment reject everything Egypt was like the main country in the world and he reject everything what you just you reject your um let's say what's the coolest thing now like Xbox or something your fancy room all your lights and everything just to receive some whips right right what of you man that that's Faith he saw that the Lord was greater than that Hallelujah and all of this it was just going to get to an end now I wanted to put a picture of of me when I went to like to kindergarten and then to school and then to high school and then to the uni cuz I was surrounded by friends and I thought by the time man this these guys are I'm my friends yeah I haven't talked to any of them for years wow I haven't talked to my friends that they were in the high school but I thought back in the days their opinion about me was so important yeah yeah but now that I'm 30 years old that was just nothing was there for a couple of years and that's nothing y I haven't talked to friends from high school then I thought man now these guys they are very important another one from the school that kids but now these guys now we I have 15 something like that I haven't talked to them and from the uni there is only one guy that I still talked to only one out of all my friends all those opinions about me that I thought they were so important I just don't care anymore yeah so if you can take that kid so now we can see Moses and what what was Moses able to see the Red Sea and the Pharaoh approaching what he was able to listen the horses the sea but what fate told him yeah just speak and as I spoke we can see what happened amen because Faith was given to us to trust in the Lord amen amen another example here we have um Noah it says by faith Noah being warn of God of things not seen as yet move with fear prepare an ark to be saving of his house by the which he condemned the world his faith condemned the world Amen and became hair of the righteousness which is by faith amen that's also in um Hebrews 11 now can you imagine building something never seen before yeah for something that was never ever ever happened before rain wasn't a thing yeah what was he able to see well there's no rain but the Lord told me that was going to be a big big 40 days of rain so he prepared the ark not not like trusting in his senses just in his faith amen and I think that's a little bit of us yes sir I like to think that every time that's right I'm driving up the transmission G I'm like man I trust the Lord amen I trust the Lord by faith all these families that travel they're doing it by faith they're they fully trust that the Lord is going to bless them and he's going to take them out of here one day amen now let's go back here verse 16 of Hebrews 11 no um Ephesians 6 says above all that's very important because it's like saying take all these things but above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the Fier dots of the wicked yeah amen have a picture here of Israel now that Dome it's like a shell it act just like a shell they can send them Rockets missiles everything but there's another one that comes up and exploded in the air and there's not damage there's not damage for the people now this is a picture of T Aviv the capital of Israel is a capital I think it's a capital can you see how it looks like an awesome City all the buildings everything all good because there is a shield protecting that country this is Syria was in a war is just destroyed there was no shield now the end of the sermon is just to take the shield take the word of God because otherwise you can be like this or you can end it up like this like a totally destroyed City now how can we activate our system it's just easy it's just it is written this is all what we have this is our Shield this is how act I put a couple of examples here because this is um um prayer meeting so I won't be long even if I would have try to it says even if you have like a brotherly dispute amen because that can happen colossian if if the devil put that thing in your mind like ah this brother a doing something wrong to me I don't want to talk to him is not about you man I you you know that Colossians 3:13 you can hit that missile with this that's right for forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye amen if the devil put a thought in your mind about a brother hit him with that one Hallelujah and that thought can just get destroyed otherwise you're going to start taking damage and you something going to start growing inside of youj but this one for the kids because now we have heaps of kids when you start getting smart if uh Ephesians six says children obey your parent in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise amen that it may be well thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nature and admonition of the Lord amen so if you feel that you don't want to obey your parents if you feel that oh I'm smarter than this guy now I'm stronger than him remember that because otherwise you're going to get in trouble that's there's a no brainer just you're getting in trouble just don't let the devil put thoughts in your mind Hallelujah this wouldn't be fine if we wouldn't have like a shield but the Lord give us the best of the bestall even if you feel worthless what the Bible says about you yeah Romans 7 says um verse 37 say nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life No Angels no principalities no powers no things present no things to come no height no deep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen how can you feel worthless after that knowing that the Lord love you so much yeah now I have a picture but if you don't really like bloody things I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and then I'm going to ask you to open it again cuz this is the picture of my hand when I cut my fingers for the second time not the first one the first one wasn't that okay I'm going to put it if you want to close your eyes it's going to be in three two one you want to see it that was my fingers on a Wednesday and I see I'm I'm just going to swipe for for another one black and white so it's not that bad I was working with David on Wednesday oh Camp was on Friday so it wasn't the same week and I remember that day we were working in Le and and I was in my mind came this thought of like I need to be very very cautious with my hands cuz I'm going to be playing the entire weekend nothing can happen to me next minute I got three on my fingers really really bad if you think that David's white man that day he was pale just like a [Laughter] ghost so they took me to the hospital and everything I didn't feel that much there was no pain I don't know why the Lord is just great they took me to the hospital and then they um I had to drive with um Stephanie to the hospital here at the hat and when they were doing the the surgery and everything something came to me and I was like the N she was doing my fingers like stitches and everything and I said to her do you know that I'm going to be playing guitar the entire weekend and she said to me no you are not that's impossible look look like the state of the fingers she asked me to go and um wash them my fingers man they was just was just wide open just like a flower or something like that like a flower yeah but there was something there was Faith amen I that was just the Faith from the Lord and I remember that camp I was able to play and man the Lo I think man that camp was just awesome was just awesome was incredible because I was playing with those uh bandages in my fingers but anyways I did it the Lord did it for me I'm very happy for that am but when I was a kid about like 11 12 years or something the devil he up putting thoughts in my mind unbelief saying like the Lord doesn't exist and I start listening to him cuz in denom in the denomination they don't teach you these things how to fight the devil yeah but okay I'm going to car on with this story oh Uncle Pedro come here thank you so the devil start putting thoughts in my mind and he really tricked me and for many many years I didn't want to believe in the Lord as a young person I grew up look at my parents like oh you lame you believe in something that doesn't exist I was wrong but in that moment man I was so smart but anyways when I was playing in that camp I was hoping for a miracle I wanted to feel my my fingers growing back again every single night that we were playing I was like man the Lord I'm gonna be playing and bang my fingers are gonna grow and every single night the devil was there just like see it's not happening but he didn't know that in this house there was a strong man now living amen the spirit of the Lord was in me amen say just shut up Satan am amen I was I wanted to have like a miracle but it didn't happen in the way that I wanted to so Camp was over I went through n natural um feeling and um I was telling this to Noelia and she said to me man that was a miracle that you were able to play yeah and then B click on my head the miracle was that I was able to play with those fingers but I wanted to see another one but the Lord blessed me and I was able to play and that's something that I really really appreciate from the Lord amen cuz as a musician man if that's that's your everything Amen to being able to be there standing there or sitting how we play and see people getting healed see people receiving the Lord see people receiving the Holy Ghost Deliverance my Lord being a musician here it's like a it's like a coin his two sides cuz you would have really like to be on the other side worshiping but when you're worshipping you really wanted to be there playing so that's what happened to the musicians and and yeah now remember to always have this um system this shield on Amen because imagine if one day Israel didn't active The Shield they would have just take damage for no reason yeah cuz have the shield reason why they wouldn't have it why they wouldn't receive all the damage and damage can start for something really really small but then how do you think that this city started was an awesome City too with Syria and now look at it it's just ruins just destroyed no one can live it anymore everything just can collapse y so don't let the devil put thoughts in your mind and always trust the Lord let's just have the the musicians let's sing um Our Redeemer Lives amen [Applause] amen oh brother Marion I thought you were going to come here to the rescue is it in G right amen let's St we can sing this song and then pray who thought the S where to stand in the
