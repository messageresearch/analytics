[54:06] romans 8. it says accept
[54:10] the lord build the house so i see this
[54:13] working
[54:14] except the lord build the house they
[54:16] labor in vain that build it
[54:18] except the lord keep the city the
[54:19] watchman waketh but in vain
[54:22] it is vain for you to rise up early
[54:25] to sit up late to eat the bread of
[54:27] sorrows for so he giveth his beloved
[54:30] sleep
[54:31] so it's vain to get up early and start
[54:34] playing and eat the bread of sorrows
[54:35] you're nothing wrong with getting up
[54:36] early or even staying up late if you're
[54:37] a night owl but eat the bread of sorrows
[54:39] is the problem
[54:40] lo children are in heritage of the lord
[54:43] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[54:45] as arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[54:48] man so are
[54:48] children of the youth happy is the man
[54:51] that had this quiver full of them they
[54:52] shall not be ashamed
[54:54] but they shall speak with the enemies in
[54:56] the gate
[54:58] now we're going to go to uh romans
[55:01] 8 and um we're going to go to 18. this
[55:04] it's either child proof i know is it
[55:06] working okay good
[55:08] it's working uh romans 8 and 18 just a
[55:10] bit of a context
[55:12] um i trust this all comes together
[55:15] um romans 8 and 18 for i reckon that the
[55:18] suffering of this present time are not
[55:20] worthy to be compared with the glory
[55:21] which shall be revealed in us
[55:23] for the earnest expectation of the
[55:25] creature we know that word creature
[55:27] means the creation
[55:28] waiteth for the manifestation which is
[55:30] the revealing of the sons of god
[55:33] for the creature was made subject to
[55:35] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[55:37] him
[55:38] who has subjected the same in hope
[55:40] because the creature itself
[55:42] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[55:44] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[55:46] of the children of god for we know that
[55:48] the whole creation groaneth and
[55:50] travaileth and pained together until now
[55:52] and not only they but ourselves also
[55:55] which have the first fruits of the
[55:56] spirit even we ourselves grown within

[59:13] amen amen god bless you friends you may
[59:15] have your seats this morning
[59:17] i'd like to speak this morning on the
[59:19] revealing of suns
[59:21] now when i speak about sun's being
[59:23] revealed i'm talking about this is not
[59:25] just
[59:25] the male side of the you know this is
[59:27] sons and daughters but
[59:28] a sun is a position and so now we read
[59:31] here in
[59:32] in um in romans and and the scripture in
[59:35] uh psalms it will it will become more
[59:38] apparent
[59:39] uh later but you know we read in the
[59:41] scripture where the apostle paul was
[59:42] looking forward in time
[59:44] where there will come a time where there
[59:46] will be the manifestation of the sons of
[59:48] god where
[59:49] the whole of nature is groaning and
[59:52] travail
[59:53] until this happens and when the sons of
[59:54] god are revealed
[59:56] then then all of creation will be
[59:58] liberated under
[59:59] under the curse of sin because just as
[1:00:01] man fell under the curse of sin the
[1:00:03] whole of nature's fallen as well
[1:00:05] and we can see that this travail is
[1:00:07] going on now this is why nature is
[1:00:09] falling apart
[1:00:10] this earth is going through birth pains
[1:00:12] amen and so there's a struggle going on
[1:00:15] nature is groaning it's it's it's
[1:00:17] waiting for a people to come to their
[1:00:18] god-given position
[1:00:20] it's waiting for a people to be revealed
[1:00:22] in the end time now
[1:00:23] i just want to um start from the
[1:00:26] beginning you know
[1:00:29] we are already sons and daughters of god
[1:00:31] the scripture tells us and we'll get to
[1:00:33] it that we are now sons and daughters of
[1:00:34] god
[1:00:35] right but there has to be something on
[1:00:36] the inside inside of us that comes out
[1:00:39] now you know i have slides but i'm just
[1:00:42] i just feel bad at putting trying to put
[1:00:44] notes together but
[1:00:46] can we go back to the sorry yeah someone
[1:00:49] needs you lord come by here amen
[1:00:51] i need him this morning amen but we read
[1:00:54] here how
[1:00:55] how you know an arrow so i just put this
[1:00:58] here because many times we think of this
[1:01:00] as just as natural children
[1:01:01] but i want to take it a bit of a if you
[1:01:03] give me a liberty this morning i want to
[1:01:05] talk about god's children
[1:01:06] you take about arrows you know a weapon
[1:01:09] is the potency of a weapon
[1:01:11] is only manifested when it's put into
[1:01:13] use you can have the greatest gun in the
[1:01:15] world it can be it can be deadly
[1:01:16] accurate you know it can shoot a certain
[1:01:18] distance it can whatever more take out
[1:01:20] of whatever target but it's only when
[1:01:22] it's fired and the bullet hits the
[1:01:23] target you see
[1:01:24] that gun actually works otherwise it's
[1:01:25] just a piece of decoration just a
[1:01:28] showpiece you know you don't know the
[1:01:29] potency of it
[1:01:30] it can look all very dangerous and
[1:01:32] powerful but when it's put into use
[1:01:34] that's when you see its power now it's
[1:01:36] the same thing with the sons and
[1:01:37] daughters of god you know we were
[1:01:38] attributes in the mind of god before the
[1:01:40] foundation of the world
[1:01:41] god had attributes in himself that he
[1:01:43] wanted to express
[1:01:44] and the power of those attributes is
[1:01:46] only manifested when they're put in
[1:01:48] flesh
[1:01:49] amen where where god would god would
[1:01:51] prophesy of a people that would you know
[1:01:53] down through the ages his children have
[1:01:55] been upon the earth
[1:01:56] and when they have come into
[1:01:58] manifestation the power that's
[1:02:00] in them is revealed you take moses moses
[1:02:03] was
[1:02:03] moses was i'd say an arrow in the quiver
[1:02:06] you know god's quiver
[1:02:08] and god fired him into the earth and and
[1:02:11] there was a certain path his life had to
[1:02:13] take but it had to reach a target
[1:02:15] and that target was to manifest the
[1:02:17] prophecy that was allotted to him
[1:02:19] he was prophesied when abraham was told
[1:02:22] by god your seed is going to sojourn in
[1:02:24] a strange land 400 years
[1:02:25] but i'm going to bring them out with a
[1:02:27] mighty hand they're going to be
[1:02:28] afflicted i'm going to bring them out
[1:02:29] with a mighty hand
[1:02:30] when god was telling that to abraham god
[1:02:32] had had in his mind moses was going to
[1:02:34] be the one
[1:02:35] that god was going to use to bring them
[1:02:37] out with the mighty hand
[1:02:38] right so he was an attribute in god's
[1:02:40] mind but when he was put
[1:02:42] in flesh and time and he was
[1:02:44] commissioned he was anointed he was sent
[1:02:46] forth
[1:02:46] then the power that was in that prophet
[1:02:48] was manifested
[1:02:50] the power that was in that attribute of
[1:02:51] that son of god when he went to you know
[1:02:53] he said let flies come or let
[1:02:55] frogs come or you know raise his staff
[1:02:57] or aaron did a certain thing though now
[1:02:59] nile turned to blood plagues were poured
[1:03:01] out on egypt you know your deliverance
[1:03:03] came the red sea was parted mighty
[1:03:05] things happen
[1:03:06] that was the power of that attribute of
[1:03:08] that son of god amen
[1:03:09] right so you know it's more than just
[1:03:12] when i talk about arrows in the you know
[1:03:14] hand over as arrows are in the hand of a
[1:03:16] mighty man
[1:03:17] so are the children of the youth happy
[1:03:19] is the man that had the quiver full of
[1:03:20] them
[1:03:21] you know we're not we're not decoration
[1:03:25] because it's easy to talk about history
[1:03:26] but i want to talk about you right now
[1:03:27] we're not decoration
[1:03:28] we're not on a mantelpiece we don't have
[1:03:31] some plaque
[1:03:32] next to us explaining some historical
[1:03:33] event that we're in
[1:03:35] no but no but we are putting god's fired
[1:03:37] us into this age
[1:03:39] and we have a target we're going to hit
[1:03:41] hallelujah and we're built to hit that
[1:03:43] target
[1:03:44] we're built to pass through any obstacle
[1:03:46] where you know
[1:03:47] our our flight path may be a bit wavy
[1:03:50] but it will hit its target who's ever
[1:03:53] fired who's ever taken a coke bottle and
[1:03:55] made a
[1:03:55] made a water uh water rocket
[1:03:59] who's ever done that that's funny
[1:04:02] but what happens when you try and put
[1:04:03] fins on it who's tried to put fins on
[1:04:05] the rocket
[1:04:06] you know if those fins aren't balanced
[1:04:08] then you see the rocket will fly like
[1:04:10] this
[1:04:11] so it's yo yo it's trajectory will look
[1:04:13] all crazy
[1:04:14] now it's the same thing with you and i
[1:04:17] if our life is not balanced in the word
[1:04:19] of god
[1:04:20] if our emotions are not balanced then
[1:04:22] our flight path
[1:04:23] can be like this we're still on target
[1:04:27] we're gonna get there right but our life
[1:04:30] can be all like this
[1:04:31] you know but but but if our emotions our
[1:04:34] spirit is balanced
[1:04:36] what if our walk is balanced in the word
[1:04:38] doesn't matter what crosswind comes our
[1:04:40] way we're going to go through
[1:04:42] amen hallelujah so we are now
[1:04:48] see so here now jesus said
[1:04:52] all that the father has given me shall
[1:04:54] come so he had a certain number now
[1:04:56] if you see us staying on my back well
[1:04:58] william just left his calling card this
[1:05:00] morning so
[1:05:00] you know that's too hot to hold that
[1:05:02] carrot you know and so
[1:05:04] you know so he says all that the father
[1:05:06] has given me will come so he has a
[1:05:08] predestinated amount of people
[1:05:10] that has already been given to him and
[1:05:12] said they're going to come to me
[1:05:13] hallelujah so when jesus died on calvary
[1:05:16] he didn't die in a haphazard way
[1:05:18] thinking maybe someone will feel
[1:05:19] sympathy for me
[1:05:20] and they'll give their lives and follow
[1:05:21] me no when he was on the cross you're on
[1:05:23] his mind
[1:05:24] i mean he went with you on his mind he
[1:05:26] knew i've got attributes i must redeem
[1:05:28] i mean i've got to wash them in my blood
[1:05:30] hallelujah that that when they come to
[1:05:32] the earth now when i talk about arrows
[1:05:34] and
[1:05:34] the you know god's quiver i'm not
[1:05:36] talking about the outside appearance
[1:05:38] you can take missiles you know you take
[1:05:40] you take modern weapons
[1:05:41] they can look real small but they can
[1:05:43] blow up cities
[1:05:44] so they cannot look very intimidating
[1:05:46] but when they go boom it's the inside
[1:05:48] when it goes boom
[1:05:49] you know when the explosion happens the
[1:05:51] chain reaction happens that's when
[1:05:52] oh boy that's a potent thing you know so
[1:05:55] it's the same thing with you and i'm not
[1:05:56] talking about the flesh man
[1:05:58] this guy will disappoint us he will rob
[1:06:01] us of victory
[1:06:02] he will make all you know brother man
[1:06:03] says we have a sticky nature that we
[1:06:05] still have even after the new birth
[1:06:07] and so i'm not talking about this guy
[1:06:08] i'm talking about the gene seed of god
[1:06:10] on the inside of the inside of us i mean
[1:06:13] she says all that the father has given
[1:06:15] me
[1:06:15] shall come to me and all that and him
[1:06:17] that cometh to me i'll know why it's
[1:06:19] cast out
[1:06:20] how this is no excuse you say well i
[1:06:22] don't know if i'm one of his if you go
[1:06:24] to him he won't cast you out
[1:06:26] hallelujah for i come down from heaven
[1:06:28] not to do my own will but the will of
[1:06:29] him that sent me
[1:06:31] and this is the father's will which hath
[1:06:32] sent me that all
[1:06:35] which he hath given me i should i should
[1:06:37] lose nothing
[1:06:38] hallelujah he's talking about me in that
[1:06:40] verse
[1:06:42] he's not going to lose nothing and i'm
[1:06:43] part of nothing is something hallelujah
[1:06:46] you know he's not going to lose me amen
[1:06:48] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:06:50] day and this is the will of him that
[1:06:51] sent me that everyone that seeth the son
[1:06:53] and believeth on him
[1:06:54] may have everlasting life and i'll raise
[1:06:56] him up at the last day
[1:06:58] now when he says when he saith the son
[1:06:59] he's talking about present tense seeing
[1:07:01] he's the present god not just looking at
[1:07:03] a historical god but the present god
[1:07:05] when you see that god manifest himself
[1:07:07] see the sun manifested
[1:07:09] and believe on that what god is doing in
[1:07:10] your hour
[1:07:12] amen now we're we are seated if we just
[1:07:17] now the book of ephesians tells us our
[1:07:19] position in christ
[1:07:21] it's a very powerful book just as joshua
[1:07:24] placed the israelites in the land in the
[1:07:26] old testament so paul
[1:07:27] and the inspiration the holy ghost
[1:07:28] places this is the believer believe his
[1:07:30] position in christ
[1:07:32] and now notice this now it's not us
[1:07:34] trying to sit in heavenly places in our
[1:07:35] own ability
[1:07:36] he says and he hath raised us up
[1:07:38] together and made us sit together in
[1:07:40] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:07:42] this is god's doing he says i've got a
[1:07:43] position for you i'm going to make you
[1:07:45] sit there
[1:07:46] and that position is far above all devil
[1:07:48] demon power
[1:07:49] all unbelief trouble humanity whatever
[1:07:51] it may be
[1:07:52] that's we are seated in heavenly places
[1:07:54] in christ jesus
[1:07:55] he has made us has raised us up together
[1:07:58] so it's not in the future he says right
[1:08:00] now
[1:08:00] you say well i'm still on terra firma no
[1:08:02] this is your spiritual business
[1:08:04] position in christ but we're going to
[1:08:06] operate from that position
[1:08:07] we we're not here to operate from a
[1:08:09] position of carnality
[1:08:11] and reasoning and argument whatever more
[1:08:13] no we are ordained to sit in a position
[1:08:15] in heavenly place in christ jesus we're
[1:08:17] to operate in that position
[1:08:19] what is that walking according to the
[1:08:20] word that in the ages to come he might
[1:08:23] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[1:08:25] and his kindness towards us through
[1:08:27] christ jesus amen now
[1:08:31] john says very clearly here behold what
[1:08:33] manner of love the father has bestowed
[1:08:35] upon us
[1:08:36] that we should be called the chilled
[1:08:38] sons of god sorry therefore the world
[1:08:39] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[1:08:42] beloved now we are the sons of god so
[1:08:44] i'm not talking about a future event
[1:08:46] right now
[1:08:47] everyone say right now i'm a child of
[1:08:50] god
[1:08:51] hallelujah i mean so right now we are
[1:08:53] the sons of god
[1:08:54] and it doth not yet appear what we shall
[1:08:56] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:08:59] we shall be like him for he we shall see
[1:09:02] him as he is now
[1:09:03] we understand in this end time the
[1:09:05] prophet's ministry was to
[1:09:07] declare he is here right that's what he
[1:09:09] says my ministry brother braham said is
[1:09:11] to declare jesus christ is here
[1:09:13] that all he was in the days of his
[1:09:15] earthly ministry he is the same today
[1:09:17] but his corporal body is still up in
[1:09:19] glory but the same god is present upon
[1:09:21] the earth
[1:09:21] that's why you know we'll people didn't
[1:09:23] stand wheelchairs
[1:09:24] i mean cancers were healed you know
[1:09:26] demons were cast out people received the
[1:09:28] holy ghost revival fires
[1:09:29] were lit on every hill on every you know
[1:09:31] around the world people saw that jesus
[1:09:33] christ
[1:09:34] is not a man of history but he's alive
[1:09:36] today and his word came open the word
[1:09:38] came open in this hour to reveal who we
[1:09:40] are in the book
[1:09:42] hallelujah now if you know who you are
[1:09:43] in the book if god reveals if this word
[1:09:46] comes open you know
[1:09:47] we have a lot of catchphrases the seals
[1:09:49] have come open the books come open it
[1:09:51] can just become
[1:09:52] jargon but the whole purpose of god
[1:09:54] taking the book
[1:09:56] taking this and making it is no longer
[1:09:58] sealed
[1:09:59] that you can actually see clearly what
[1:10:02] it means and what it says that's the
[1:10:03] book coming open
[1:10:05] now there's a purpose of that coming
[1:10:07] open
[1:10:08] is that you will see where you're going
[1:10:10] to hit the target
[1:10:12] brother brown would dramatize when the
[1:10:14] lamb would take the book of revelations
[1:10:15] chapter
[1:10:16] five and we know john was caught up into
[1:10:17] the eternities
[1:10:19] and he saw that you know the book was
[1:10:21] sealed up on the right hand of the
[1:10:22] original owner
[1:10:23] you know and he whipped much because he
[1:10:24] saw no one was found worthy to take the
[1:10:26] book
[1:10:27] but then one of the elders came and said
[1:10:29] weep not john
[1:10:30] for the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:10:32] prevailed
[1:10:33] but when he looked he saw a lamb coming
[1:10:35] because you know the reason
[1:10:37] he is called a lion is because he's a
[1:10:39] judge he's a king
[1:10:40] he's going to rule the earth with a rod
[1:10:42] of iron that's one attribute he has but
[1:10:44] he's not just all
[1:10:45] all lion he's not all judgment he's also
[1:10:48] a lamb
[1:10:49] hallelujah so he's also he's a lamb he's
[1:10:51] a lion he's many different things but
[1:10:53] to john he was a lamb so he wasn't some
[1:10:56] angry god that's going to pour his wrath
[1:10:58] out upon john no that was not john's
[1:11:00] relationship with
[1:11:01] the lord jesus no his relationship was
[1:11:03] this is my sacrifice
[1:11:05] this is my husband this is my mediator
[1:11:07] this is my intercessor this is my
[1:11:09] this is my lamb this is my all in all
[1:11:11] and here he comes walking forth to claim
[1:11:13] the book and then brother brahm says now
[1:11:15] when the when the book came open and it
[1:11:17] says that all heaven
[1:11:19] yes so john went from weeping to
[1:11:20] rejoicing he said all
[1:11:22] all of heaven all in the earth under the
[1:11:24] earth heard me cry out glory
[1:11:26] blessings honor be to the lamb and
[1:11:28] strength and power and
[1:11:30] hallelujah and brother man said john got
[1:11:31] next to himself
[1:11:33] because john looked past the curtain of
[1:11:35] time and he saw john
[1:11:37] so when the seals came open to john he
[1:11:39] saw himself already in eternity
[1:11:42] even though he was upon the earth
[1:11:43] physically he saw he was already in
[1:11:45] eternity
[1:11:46] so he realized now that he's good at the
[1:11:48] target he's going to hit is he's going
[1:11:50] to end up in glory
[1:11:52] his his trajectory was going through
[1:11:54] life remember we come from god we go
[1:11:56] back to god
[1:11:57] right we don't remember coming from god
[1:11:58] but then god reveals
[1:12:00] to us who we are and him when we realize
[1:12:02] i came from him
[1:12:03] that's why i've given my life to him
[1:12:05] i've become a believer
[1:12:06] and now i'm going to go back to him i
[1:12:08] mean so the seals came off the book john
[1:12:10] got real happy
[1:12:11] because he saw john on the other he saw
[1:12:13] himself already overcome
[1:12:15] already already overcome the devil hell
[1:12:17] all all trials and trouble
[1:12:19] you think about where john was standing
[1:12:21] right there on the earth he was in
[1:12:22] prison on the isle of patmos
[1:12:25] right so that he was a man in prison
[1:12:27] going through hardship
[1:12:29] but yet he could rejoice because he saw
[1:12:32] himself over the curtain of time
[1:12:33] he saw he had overcome any pressure the
[1:12:35] devil could put upon him the religious
[1:12:37] systems
[1:12:38] whatever government whatever systems
[1:12:40] would try and push him down
[1:12:41] he could rejoice saying no no if i i've
[1:12:43] seen i've made it
[1:12:45] i'm going to make it hallelujah and that
[1:12:47] should be the same thing with you and i
[1:12:49] when this word comes open to you when
[1:12:50] the book comes open
[1:12:52] i trust i'm not talking i it's an
[1:12:55] experience
[1:12:56] when the word comes open to you
[1:12:59] hallelujah that should cause you to say
[1:13:00] i see myself
[1:13:02] over there hallelujah so now
[1:13:05] we have our destination assured
[1:13:08] hallelujah
[1:13:09] hallelujah amen but he says when he
[1:13:13] shall appear
[1:13:15] uh when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:13:17] him for we shall see him as he is now
[1:13:19] brother braham says very clearly
[1:13:20] he has appeared in these last days his
[1:13:22] spirit working among us
[1:13:24] is part of his appearing and we know the
[1:13:26] appearing merges into the coming of god
[1:13:28] right but now that's why the holy spirit
[1:13:30] moves is that that's his appearing
[1:13:34] hallelujah so the same one you think
[1:13:36] about brother man said yo that's why we
[1:13:37] have the photograph there on the front
[1:13:39] not because the prophet because the
[1:13:40] pillar of fire over his head
[1:13:41] and that's more than just a photograph
[1:13:43] god proved himself that that was him
[1:13:44] there
[1:13:45] right but that same god is still present
[1:13:47] with us today he's not a historical one
[1:13:49] he's the same jesus
[1:13:50] the same one that met paul on the road
[1:13:52] to damascus the same one that met moses
[1:13:54] should meet you right because he's the
[1:13:56] same god and so now here he is appearing
[1:13:58] among us we may not
[1:14:00] see him but we feel his presence just
[1:14:02] like a blind man who had never seen the
[1:14:04] sun he can go out there
[1:14:05] he can feel the sun rays on his skin and
[1:14:08] he can say what is that
[1:14:09] feeling what is causing this feeling on
[1:14:11] my body and someone who has eyes can
[1:14:13] look up and say blind man that's the sun
[1:14:16] that's the sunrise striking you that's
[1:14:17] why you feel this way and that's why
[1:14:19] we had a prophet come in this end time
[1:14:21] who said can't you see that light can
[1:14:22] you see he's here now
[1:14:23] everyone felt his presence but many
[1:14:25] didn't see the pillar of fire
[1:14:26] but he's declaring he but he has given
[1:14:28] prophetic eyesight to say no he's the
[1:14:30] one doing that
[1:14:31] he's the one speaking to you he's the
[1:14:33] one that's just anointed you
[1:14:34] whose hair has healed you right that's
[1:14:37] the same thing here we may never see
[1:14:39] the pillar of fire visibly but we feel
[1:14:41] his presence
[1:14:42] oh church can't we just rejoice i mean
[1:14:44] to know the one that's appearing among
[1:14:46] us
[1:14:46] amen is to change our mortal bodies it
[1:14:49] means he's appearing among us that where
[1:14:51] we shall see him we shall be like him
[1:14:53] now
[1:14:54] in order you think about our god he's a
[1:14:56] mighty conqueror
[1:14:57] that same pillar of fire cast the devil
[1:14:59] out of heaven in the beginning
[1:15:01] revelations 12 right and then now the
[1:15:04] the devil is cast out into the earth
[1:15:06] god actually pursued his enemy down to
[1:15:08] the earth hallelujah
[1:15:10] sometimes we think well the devil's just
[1:15:11] got free reign no no god's here
[1:15:14] god has been chasing his devil all the
[1:15:16] way down through time
[1:15:18] and now the devil's roaring like a like
[1:15:21] a lion or whatever because he knows he
[1:15:23] has but a short time
[1:15:25] hallelujah but the lord is appearing
[1:15:27] among us and we sh when we shall
[1:15:29] see him i mean we shall be like him if
[1:15:32] we shall see him as he is now if he's a
[1:15:34] conqueror
[1:15:34] we'll be conquerors right that same
[1:15:37] attributes in him will be in you and i
[1:15:39] so if he was an overcomer we'll overcome
[1:15:43] if uh you know you know we're built
[1:15:46] to turn down the devil's lie
[1:15:49] you know we were actually predestined to
[1:15:51] turn down the devil's life
[1:15:53] hallelujah there's a spirit that came
[1:15:54] off of god amen that was on the angels
[1:15:57] you know in heaven and they turned down
[1:15:59] the devil's line that same anointing is
[1:16:01] on you and i
[1:16:02] we're actually built to turn down this
[1:16:03] lion this time
[1:16:05] hallelujah
[1:16:08] amen that's why now we are seated
[1:16:12] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:16:14] jesus the position that christ was
[1:16:15] in and he cast out devils he is led by
[1:16:18] the holy ghost to do exactly
[1:16:20] what he said i can do nothing till the
[1:16:21] father shows me what the father shows me
[1:16:23] that i do likewise
[1:16:25] right so there's a position the
[1:16:26] believers in now this position
[1:16:28] god has put us in are we all together on
[1:16:31] this
[1:16:32] hallelujah so now if i've been put in a
[1:16:34] god ordained position i should use that
[1:16:36] position
[1:16:37] you know what would the use of it
[1:16:38] becoming the president of the united
[1:16:40] states if you're not going to use that
[1:16:41] office
[1:16:42] or any any any position in leadership
[1:16:45] because there's certain
[1:16:47] perks of the job responsibilities that
[1:16:50] come with it right
[1:16:52] so that's the same thing now this is not
[1:16:54] a job
[1:16:55] this is who we are right so
[1:16:58] you know we're actually built you know
[1:16:59] you're built to be the bride of christ
[1:17:01] you actually built no i'm not talking
[1:17:03] about your natural flesh i'm talking
[1:17:04] about
[1:17:04] the inside of the inside of you the real
[1:17:06] you hallelujah
[1:17:09] now brother and says and god of this
[1:17:10] evil age and when the entire word of god
[1:17:12] is
[1:17:13] incomplete was headed up in a body human
[1:17:15] body called jesus christ and their god
[1:17:17] made me pay for my sins in him there
[1:17:19] then he rose me raised me up with him in
[1:17:21] the resurrection
[1:17:22] and now we are seated with him with
[1:17:24] power and authority over every devil
[1:17:27] i mean so whatever is fighting you right
[1:17:29] now you actually have been given power
[1:17:30] and authority over it
[1:17:33] every means every that doesn't mean
[1:17:35] there's a group that's not included
[1:17:36] that's every devil
[1:17:37] oh if you could only believe what god
[1:17:40] has given but if you're not seated there
[1:17:41] you don't have it
[1:17:43] and if you're seated there and don't
[1:17:44] believe it and afraid to move you'll
[1:17:46] never use it
[1:17:47] but if you're seated there you will use
[1:17:49] it for your ordained to do
[1:17:51] what you do hallelujah so you're
[1:17:54] actually ordained our life's trajectory

[1:17:58] this is just you know give me a bit of
[1:18:00] liberty you can say you know you just go
[1:18:02] off on things but you know
[1:18:03] you know the trajectory of our life is
[1:18:05] all different
[1:18:07] and we all have a different job we're
[1:18:10] not god doesn't make cookie cutter
[1:18:12] christians he doesn't make us all the
[1:18:13] same we have different callings and
[1:18:16] different
[1:18:16] you know things we meant to do right
[1:18:18] within the body of christ
[1:18:20] so now if we're ordained to do what
[1:18:22] we'll do then that means we're
[1:18:24] we will do what we're ordained to do
[1:18:27] right whatever that may be in life
[1:18:29] are you following me right remember
[1:18:31] we're you know we're not here
[1:18:32] haphazardly
[1:18:33] this is not like pumping up a you know a
[1:18:35] water rocket and seeing where it's going
[1:18:37] to go god knows exactly where we're
[1:18:38] going to go
[1:18:40] hallelujah so we're ordained
[1:18:44] for you for your ordained to do what you
[1:18:46] do so if you're seated there you'll use
[1:18:48] it
[1:18:49] hello hello people seated together in

[1:19:40] shalom you say this world is a is full
[1:19:43] of trouble it was prophesied to be full
[1:19:45] of trouble
[1:19:46] in the days of trouble you know king
[1:19:49] david would prophesy that in psalms 27
[1:19:52] right this is an hour of trouble but to
[1:19:54] the bride it's peace
[1:19:56] shalom hallelujah
[1:20:01] now in ephesians 3 he says that he would
[1:20:04] grant you according to the riches of his
[1:20:06] glory
[1:20:06] to be strengthened with might by his
[1:20:08] spirit in the inner man
[1:20:10] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:20:12] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:20:14] in love
[1:20:15] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:20:17] saints which is the breadth
[1:20:19] and the length and the depth and the
[1:20:20] height so what he's saying is this is
[1:20:22] not just a two-dimensional kind of a
[1:20:24] walk
[1:20:25] there's a depth to it there's a breath
[1:20:26] to it there's a height you know
[1:20:28] you know there's a length you know
[1:20:30] there's a fullness of god there's a
[1:20:31] depth in the word
[1:20:33] there's a depth in our position there's
[1:20:34] a greater you know it's more than just
[1:20:35] coming in
[1:20:36] and sure we have to repent and be
[1:20:38] baptized name the lord jesus christ for
[1:20:40] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:20:41] the gift of the holy ghost then after
[1:20:43] your birth into the kingdom
[1:20:44] is now now what am i what am i made to
[1:20:46] be and then god as you walk with him he
[1:20:49] unveils who you are in the scripture
[1:20:51] saying no no you're a conqueror you're
[1:20:52] not mean to be defeated
[1:20:54] no that complex has been through your
[1:20:56] family no it's going to come to an end
[1:20:57] now
[1:20:58] that generational problem whatever that
[1:21:00] spirit of lust or whatever has come down
[1:21:02] through your family lying or
[1:21:03] stubbornness or
[1:21:04] unforgiveness it's going to come to an
[1:21:06] end hallelujah because you're ordained
[1:21:09] to overcome this thing
[1:21:10] amen oh that devil is roaring around no
[1:21:13] no he's the tail you're the head
[1:21:15] amen you have power to bind them power
[1:21:17] to lose them hallelujah i didn't save
[1:21:19] you to lose you i saved you to keep you
[1:21:20] amen you're one of my attributes here it
[1:21:22] just expands out
[1:21:24] and that and to know the love of christ
[1:21:26] which passeth knowledge that ye might be
[1:21:28] filled with all the fullness
[1:21:31] of god he says now unto him that's able
[1:21:35] to do exceeding abundantly above all
[1:21:37] that we ask or think according to the
[1:21:38] power that worketh in us
[1:21:40] and to him be glory in the church by
[1:21:42] christ jesus throughout all ages world
[1:21:44] without end
[1:21:46] amen hallelujah so there's a lot more to
[1:21:50] the christian walk than
[1:21:52] you know many people realize
[1:21:55] and so now if we're ordained if there's
[1:21:58] if this is the hour of the revealing of
[1:22:00] sons
[1:22:01] then what god is going to do is he's
[1:22:03] going to show the true potential of his
[1:22:05] children
[1:22:06] right he's not just it's not going to be
[1:22:08] theory
[1:22:09] it's going to be it's going to be
[1:22:11] practical it's going to be manifested
[1:22:14] right it's not just going to be an idea
[1:22:16] or a doctrine it's going to be
[1:22:17] it's going to put on flesh hallelujah
[1:22:21] now
[1:22:22] we'll go back to here
[1:22:26] he says here except the lord build the
[1:22:28] house they labor in vain that build it
[1:22:30] except the lord keep the city the
[1:22:31] watchman waketh but in vain
[1:22:34] it is it is vain for you to rise up
[1:22:36] early to sit up late to eat the bread of
[1:22:38] sorrows
[1:22:39] for so he giveth his beloved sleep now
[1:22:43] the reason i was talking about a water
[1:22:45] rocket i want to go build one again
[1:22:47] but you know the reason i was talking
[1:22:49] about a water rocket
[1:22:51] is that this bread of sorrow this word
[1:22:54] sorrow means
[1:22:55] a a sudden it means a pang
[1:22:58] a sudden sharp pain or painful emotion
[1:23:01] it means something grievous it means an
[1:23:04] idol or a labor or a sorrow now
[1:23:07] if something is a bread it means it you
[1:23:09] eat it
[1:23:10] food it becomes a diet so he's actually
[1:23:13] so the lord is saying it's vain it's
[1:23:14] actually a desolate empty thing
[1:23:17] for us to eat the bread of sorrow now
[1:23:20] this does not mean that we will not have
[1:23:22] sorrowful times in our life
[1:23:23] but it's what becomes your diet in your
[1:23:26] head
[1:23:27] what do you feed upon well you know he
[1:23:30] says it's actually a vain thing
[1:23:33] to eat the bread of sorrow so it's so
[1:23:35] it's
[1:23:36] you know bad things happen to us we're
[1:23:38] not exempt from any trial
[1:23:40] we're people too okay there's a part
[1:23:43] angel
[1:23:43] group here there's some people here
[1:23:45] there's a person here but you know
[1:23:46] so maybe i'll just talk to us but yeah
[1:23:49] um
[1:23:50] you know but we're all people the same
[1:23:52] the same troubles that happen to the
[1:23:53] world
[1:23:54] people who don't even know the law those
[1:23:55] same troubles were not exempt from it we
[1:23:57] don't get any free pass from it
[1:23:59] but it's what we do with it is is what
[1:24:02] matters
[1:24:03] and i'll say the bride of christ has the
[1:24:05] ability to overcome it
[1:24:07] not suppress it but to overcome it
[1:24:10] because remember you think about a trial
[1:24:13] or a temptation
[1:24:14] to remove the temptation out of your
[1:24:16] life does not give you overcoming power
[1:24:18] it just means you remove it but the but
[1:24:21] the bride of christ by the spirit of god
[1:24:23] has the ability
[1:24:24] to actually overcome that thing that is
[1:24:27] no longer a problem
[1:24:29] but it's a trophy in the cabinet
[1:24:31] hallelujah
[1:24:34] amen now to worship something
[1:24:37] in the bible it means to prostrate
[1:24:39] yourself to bow down or do reverence
[1:24:42] and if some if someone worships anything
[1:24:45] when they're around that object their
[1:24:47] body language will change
[1:24:49] their posture will change they'll either
[1:24:51] fall you know they will they will become
[1:24:53] very attentive
[1:24:54] right because they're around their idol
[1:24:58] you know how they talk when they you
[1:24:59] know where you know when they come to
[1:25:01] the presence of it
[1:25:02] their whole dementia will change and
[1:25:04] that's because they worship that thing
[1:25:07] now you can you can people can worship
[1:25:11] their pain of their past painful
[1:25:14] memories
[1:25:15] you know bad experiences bad
[1:25:18] conversations
[1:25:19] they can actually worship those things
[1:25:21] and now their whole demeanor will change
[1:25:23] why because they're eating those
[1:25:24] memories again
[1:25:26] we're not meant to do that friend you
[1:25:28] know an idol can appear to be a very
[1:25:30] small thing
[1:25:31] there's a temple in south america i
[1:25:33] can't remember which one i think is in
[1:25:35] the incas or one of those but the temple
[1:25:36] itself is massive
[1:25:38] but right the top of that temple is just
[1:25:39] a small wooden idol
[1:25:41] so it was actually a very small idol but
[1:25:43] they put in this very big temple there
[1:25:45] was you know as one of their gods
[1:25:46] and something can can be very small in
[1:25:48] our lives it doesn't matter how big
[1:25:51] but it can be a very big thing to us
[1:25:55] but we're not called to prostrate
[1:25:56] ourselves down to any complex
[1:25:59] or our past we're not built that way
[1:26:02] amen the devil will try and make us
[1:26:04] worship you know the devil wants to
[1:26:06] always serve us up the bread of sorrows
[1:26:09] amen he's he's a baker he wants to he
[1:26:12] wants to he wants to
[1:26:13] cook up your your past maybe put a lever
[1:26:16] in there make it make it grow look
[1:26:18] bigger than what it was turner turn a
[1:26:20] molehill into a mountain
[1:26:23] who's with me right now yeah you know he
[1:26:25] wants to take something just
[1:26:26] you know blow it up into proportions you
[1:26:29] know i mean out of proportions rather
[1:26:31] so but we're not ordained to prostrate
[1:26:34] or bow down ourselves to our past or to
[1:26:36] any complex never let those things rule
[1:26:38] you
[1:26:39] it's not our past that rules us it's our
[1:26:41] future that rules us
[1:26:43] right it's where we're going that rules
[1:26:44] us that should be our defining part of
[1:26:46] our identity
[1:26:47] i'm going to heaven where are you going
[1:26:49] i'm going up there
[1:26:50] why because the lord called me to go
[1:26:52] he's fired me from his bow and he
[1:26:54] and this is just the path i find myself
[1:26:56] in amen never let unforgiveness or
[1:26:59] resentment rule you never let that
[1:27:00] become the bread of sorrows free why
[1:27:02] because
[1:27:03] it's a vain thing has worry ever helped
[1:27:06] anyone
[1:27:09] right well what what can faith do
[1:27:12] brother
[1:27:12] i'm asked what's the point of you know
[1:27:14] believing he said well faith may deliver
[1:27:15] me
[1:27:16] but why he never helped anyone
[1:27:20] amen that's why we're instructed by the
[1:27:22] apostle paul he says though we walk in
[1:27:24] the flesh you do not war after the flesh
[1:27:27] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:27:29] carnal but mighty through god to the
[1:27:30] pulling down of strongholds
[1:27:32] casting down imaginations now this is
[1:27:34] this is actually this is something we're
[1:27:36] actually responsible for
[1:27:37] casting down imaginations and every high
[1:27:39] thing that exalted itself above the
[1:27:41] knowledge of god
[1:27:42] and bringing into captivity every
[1:27:44] thought to the obedience of christ this
[1:27:46] is this is your daily job
[1:27:48] what are you doing today i'm bringing
[1:27:50] every i'm casting down imaginations
[1:27:53] every imagination that is that is that
[1:27:55] is contrary to the word of god
[1:27:56] is being cast down amen and every high
[1:27:59] thing that exalts itself
[1:28:01] against the knowledge of god you think
[1:28:02] the devil wants us do you think he would
[1:28:04] fill our minds with imaginations of the
[1:28:06] holy ghost falling in church
[1:28:08] do you think he would fill our
[1:28:09] imaginations with supernatural healings
[1:28:11] that could take place in prophecy and
[1:28:13] people coming to the lord and he doesn't
[1:28:15] he doesn't fill our minds with those
[1:28:16] things he never will
[1:28:18] i mean he will fill our minds with
[1:28:19] negative things
[1:28:21] things that have no value that cannot
[1:28:23] help yourself or or
[1:28:24] anyone else amen so we're but you know
[1:28:27] so we're ordained
[1:28:29] to cast down imaginations you know never
[1:28:32] ever
[1:28:33] you know when it comes to thoughts we
[1:28:35] can't stop thoughts coming into our head
[1:28:37] but it's what we do with them that
[1:28:38] matters
[1:28:40] right so we must never let negative
[1:28:42] thoughts land in our
[1:28:43] in our spirits because a thought
[1:28:47] a a spirit is attached to a thought
[1:28:50] right there's always a spirit behind a
[1:28:52] thought or behind a word
[1:28:54] and so if we let negative thoughts land
[1:28:57] then a negative spirit will come in
[1:28:58] behind it
[1:28:59] it'll begin to fill our mind our
[1:29:01] imagination our reasoning our conscience
[1:29:03] our imagination our affections
[1:29:05] you know you know this you know the day
[1:29:07] we live in i was doing a
[1:29:08] um a little bit of research so your
[1:29:10] headline um
[1:29:12] caught my attention you know the use of
[1:29:14] of of you know this world we say we're
[1:29:16] so connected in this day
[1:29:18] but to connect over over social media or
[1:29:21] text or whatsapp or instagram whatever
[1:29:23] it is
[1:29:24] do you know it's actually lowers empathy
[1:29:26] in people
[1:29:27] people actually have lower levels of
[1:29:29] empathy in this day because of them
[1:29:31] of the devices they use you know
[1:29:34] there's a you know christine had a dream
[1:29:36] and i didn't ask her the details of it
[1:29:37] so i'll probably get it wrong but
[1:29:39] you know she had a she had a dream a
[1:29:40] while ago where where she saw this
[1:29:42] i think man or a girl and they were they
[1:29:44] were walking around by this big pit
[1:29:47] and this being came out of the pit and
[1:29:49] and tried to get this person's attention
[1:29:52] just like the devil right and then and
[1:29:54] when when this person walked over to
[1:29:55] talk to it
[1:29:56] this devil grabbed her and threw her
[1:29:59] into the pit
[1:30:00] and then she began to be tossed to and
[1:30:02] fro from from different devils
[1:30:05] so yeah because the devil always wants
[1:30:06] to get our ear
[1:30:08] what happens you know it begins maybe
[1:30:10] well i just feel lonely
[1:30:12] but that can take you down a very bad
[1:30:14] track
[1:30:15] and then that goes to loneliness to
[1:30:17] depression there may be suicide there
[1:30:19] may be hatred strife
[1:30:21] and then this person is being tossed to
[1:30:23] and fro from demon to demon
[1:30:24] then they tried to climb out of the pit
[1:30:26] and they thought they were there then
[1:30:28] they got dragged down again
[1:30:29] you know we need someone stronger but
[1:30:32] you see that's the problem with this
[1:30:34] world that we live in it's so easy the
[1:30:36] devil
[1:30:36] you know he's so available right
[1:30:39] unfortunately but we have one greater
[1:30:42] than him
[1:30:43] we can turn down the devil's lie
[1:30:46] hallelujah
[1:30:46] that we're not you know i was thinking
[1:30:48] if i if if a negative thought or
[1:30:50] something negative on the internet
[1:30:51] whatever catches someone's attention and
[1:30:53] a demon spirit begins to drag them down
[1:30:55] different places
[1:30:56] how much more if we really listen to
[1:30:58] god's word and instead of being dragged
[1:31:00] and tormented down into a pit we get
[1:31:02] lifted higher and higher into the
[1:31:04] heavenlies
[1:31:05] however there's not being dragged down
[1:31:06] told me there's more joy more peace more
[1:31:08] love
[1:31:09] going higher and higher in the spirit
[1:31:11] all the time
[1:31:12] hallelujah you say well does that kind
[1:31:16] of thing happen well
[1:31:17] i'll um yes but i'll yeah i'll share
[1:31:20] this so this is physical healing this is
[1:31:21] quite a few years ago this is from papua
[1:31:23] new guinea there's a sister there sarah
[1:31:25] sarah madam
[1:31:26] and she had um cervical cancer now up
[1:31:29] there the medical system is shot
[1:31:31] you don't go to a hospital to get well
[1:31:33] sadly anyway
[1:31:34] so she was she was there in the ward
[1:31:37] there was no treatment for her there she
[1:31:38] had cervical cancer she was diagnosed
[1:31:40] and then she began to have a series of
[1:31:42] dreams and the first dream was that she
[1:31:44] was
[1:31:45] um dragged down into this pit and then
[1:31:48] and then the next dream was that there
[1:31:49] are all these big powerful animals
[1:31:51] around here like the demons got worse
[1:31:53] and they tried to get into her body but
[1:31:55] she said because she was properly
[1:31:56] dressed
[1:31:57] they couldn't get in and the next dream
[1:31:59] she had she raised her hand up and a
[1:32:00] light came down
[1:32:02] took her by the hand and lifted her up
[1:32:04] out of the pit that's why we need
[1:32:05] someone stronger to come and get us
[1:32:07] it's not us trying to climb out it's god
[1:32:09] reaching down
[1:32:10] hallelujah further than we think he can
[1:32:12] reach down he lifts us up takes us up
[1:32:14] out of the pit
[1:32:15] and then the last stream she had is
[1:32:16] actually brother brown came along and
[1:32:18] prayed for her
[1:32:19] and after that she was healed she had no
[1:32:21] cancer
[1:32:22] now you work that one out i don't know
[1:32:23] but i know she doesn't have cervical
[1:32:25] cancer
[1:32:26] anymore that was about five six years
[1:32:27] ago that happened
[1:32:29] amen so you know if that can happen in
[1:32:31] natural things how much more mental
[1:32:32] oppression
[1:32:34] hallelujah but our god is able amen to
[1:32:37] deliver
[1:32:39] but we have to recognize now if our
[1:32:40] position is in heavenly places in christ
[1:32:43] jesus
[1:32:43] we don't have to tolerate the devil's
[1:32:45] nonsense
[1:32:46] we don't have to put up with him i have
[1:32:49] no time for satan
[1:32:50] that's how we should be you know there's
[1:32:52] a problem sometimes we invite him to you
[1:32:54] know he'll take
[1:32:54] pain that's real pain real hurt in our
[1:32:56] lives and he'll manipulate that and then
[1:32:58] just
[1:32:59] open a door and just like you know he
[1:33:01] just takes advantage of it you know we
[1:33:02] should never give him a second
[1:33:04] hallelujah you know i think i've said it
[1:33:06] here before but you know i love how the
[1:33:08] millennium is actually the devil is
[1:33:10] bound by a chain of circumstance he has
[1:33:12] no one to work through
[1:33:14] not a single being upon the earth he can
[1:33:16] he there's no one to work through there
[1:33:18] no he say well in the millennium we'll
[1:33:20] have peace we can have that peace now
[1:33:22] i mean when he comes knocking on the
[1:33:24] door he's like a salesperson just shut
[1:33:27] the door in his face
[1:33:28] some negative thought came along to shut
[1:33:30] the doors now i've got no time for your
[1:33:32] negative thinking
[1:33:33] i mean it will not build my faith it
[1:33:34] doesn't make me love my brother or
[1:33:36] sister doesn't help nobody
[1:33:37] and just shut the door to him that he
[1:33:39] has no place to work through
[1:33:41] imagine if he had no place to work
[1:33:42] through this morning i mean there was no
[1:33:45] unbelief there was no trouble that
[1:33:46] people's minds weren't somewhere else
[1:33:47] but his faith just being built
[1:33:49] yes lord yes you're the same lord amen
[1:33:53] lord i believe your word
[1:33:54] and god begins to draw closer and closer
[1:33:56] all the time
[1:33:58] hallelujah amen but wouldn't that be
[1:34:00] called
[1:34:01] the devil comes along says no i just
[1:34:03] can't get in there
[1:34:04] that person yeah it's easy i tell you
[1:34:06] what the door i mean the whole wall has
[1:34:08] been ripped off it's real easy to get in
[1:34:09] there
[1:34:10] you know it's like uh yo says in
[1:34:11] proverbs i believe it is that a person
[1:34:13] who has no rule over their own spirit
[1:34:16] is like a city without walls so if you
[1:34:19] don't have any rule over your own spirit
[1:34:21] you have no defense
[1:34:23] hallelujah but you say well i don't have
[1:34:27] any walls i'm just tossed to and fro by
[1:34:28] emotion
[1:34:29] god can start building he's very good at
[1:34:32] construction
[1:34:34] amen and and he does all the compliance
[1:34:36] and stuff there's no leaky homes with
[1:34:38] god
[1:34:39] hallelujah amen so
[1:34:43] you take loneliness for example
[1:34:44] loneliness lonely feelings are not from
[1:34:46] god
[1:34:48] they are not from god they are safe from
[1:34:50] hell
[1:34:51] when when when people when when people
[1:34:53] are going to think no one understands me
[1:34:55] no one knows my
[1:34:56] struggles no one cares i'm all alone
[1:34:59] that anointing comes from the pit of
[1:35:01] hell
[1:35:02] because when when when lazarus when
[1:35:04] jesus would tell the story
[1:35:06] of lazarus um and the rich man
[1:35:10] you know lazarus went to abraham's bosom
[1:35:12] after he died
[1:35:14] and so abraham was with him there in
[1:35:16] abraham's bosom he had fellowship he
[1:35:18] wasn't alone
[1:35:19] but the rich man it doesn't record
[1:35:21] anyone around him in hell
[1:35:23] it'll be the most lonely place in the
[1:35:25] world some people say well i'm going to
[1:35:27] go to hell because all my friends will
[1:35:28] be there
[1:35:29] that may be the case but you won't have
[1:35:30] any friendship there
[1:35:32] because there's no friendship there's
[1:35:33] nothing even positive down there
[1:35:35] everyone will feel
[1:35:36] alone so never ever get that in your
[1:35:39] mind
[1:35:39] because that is the devil trying to dag
[1:35:41] you drag you into a dark place
[1:35:44] brother bram says i'm blind bartimaeus
[1:35:46] sorry i don't have it up here but
[1:35:47] um he says now he says
[1:35:51] just around no well the scripture says
[1:35:53] that god is a very prison help in time
[1:35:55] of trouble
[1:35:56] right so what you say well i feel alone
[1:35:59] but he's a prison help in time of
[1:36:01] trouble
[1:36:02] amen he says i'll never leave you nor
[1:36:03] forsake me that means wherever you go
[1:36:05] you're never alone
[1:36:06] god's there you're brushing your teeth
[1:36:09] god say you're at school
[1:36:10] god say you're at work god say you're in
[1:36:12] the car god's there with your family
[1:36:14] god's there
[1:36:14] you're a church god's there you may be
[1:36:16] alone somewhere on a desert island god
[1:36:18] will be there
[1:36:20] hallelujah amen brother brahm says just
[1:36:24] around the corner when you get to
[1:36:25] thinking about divine healing you get to
[1:36:27] think about christ
[1:36:28] keep him on your mind if there be any
[1:36:31] praise if there be any virtue the bible
[1:36:33] said think on these things
[1:36:35] if any thought comes by um it says well
[1:36:38] maybe it couldn't be so maybe it
[1:36:41] get that off your mind right quick think
[1:36:43] on things that's positive never
[1:36:45] let a negative thought pass through
[1:36:48] or just don't let it stop i'm not a bus
[1:36:51] stop for the devil
[1:36:53] i'm not a stop it's got to keep going
[1:36:56] anyhow if it starts through just keep
[1:36:58] your thoughts positive about jesus
[1:37:00] don't think sitting there here in a
[1:37:03] wheelchair that you're in a hopeless
[1:37:04] you're helpless you're not
[1:37:06] don't let that negative thought ever
[1:37:08] pass through or don't let it anchor
[1:37:10] you can't help it going through your
[1:37:12] mind but don't let it stop
[1:37:15] like the old farmer said i can't keep
[1:37:17] the birds from flying over my place but
[1:37:19] he had a double barrel shotgun
[1:37:21] i can sure keep them from roosting so
[1:37:23] you can do the same thing you two see
[1:37:25] don't let them roost let them pass
[1:37:27] right on through and here's a double
[1:37:29] barrel shotgun to use both old and new
[1:37:31] testament
[1:37:32] amen it's double barrel it's barrel
[1:37:34] straight it'll hit the target
[1:37:36] holy i say even the shots that fire are
[1:37:39] more than laser-guided
[1:37:41] hallelujah they'll go to the killing
[1:37:42] place right away i mean if it's yielded
[1:37:45] with a hand of faith
[1:37:47] you'll yield down the devil i mean but
[1:37:50] if the devil thinks that
[1:37:52] his weapon is equivalent to yours he's
[1:37:54] got you
[1:37:56] but he doesn't have a weapon he's
[1:37:58] stripped
[1:37:59] he stripped that down calvary he's
[1:38:01] nothing but a bluff
[1:38:04] amen he says i tell you it keeps them
[1:38:06] all
[1:38:07] away hallelujah
[1:38:11] now we're back here low children are in
[1:38:13] heritage of the lord
[1:38:14] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[1:38:17] now it doesn't say it's the parent's
[1:38:18] reward
[1:38:19] it's his reward why because his children
[1:38:24] are his inheritance that's why word
[1:38:26] heritage you know that is that is then
[1:38:28] from the word inheritance
[1:38:29] and he fell heir to all things
[1:38:32] amen so it's also
[1:38:36] that his reward happy is the man that
[1:38:37] hath a as arrows are in the hand of a
[1:38:40] mighty man
[1:38:41] so are children of the youth now you
[1:38:44] think about
[1:38:45] a mighty man someone who's a mighty man
[1:38:47] that word also means a warrior
[1:38:48] a man of war someone that's valiant so
[1:38:50] it's not some rookie that's just been
[1:38:52] marching up and down the parade ground
[1:38:54] he's been in battle he's a mighty man
[1:38:56] he's proven himself
[1:38:57] now you think about our lord jesus he's
[1:39:00] the mightiest of the mighty man
[1:39:01] he doesn't have an equal he doesn't have
[1:39:03] a peer amen he conquered hell death in
[1:39:06] the grave i mean napoleon has nothing on
[1:39:08] him alexander the greatest not so great
[1:39:10] compared to our lord amen they went as
[1:39:12] far as they could they were defeated
[1:39:13] they lost
[1:39:14] but our lord jesus didn't just conquer
[1:39:16] on earth he cast out every devil
[1:39:18] that is led to cast out he had dominion
[1:39:20] over nature dominion over death
[1:39:22] i mean lazarus wasn't too far rotten
[1:39:24] from to come back alive again
[1:39:26] hallelujah sickness sickness had to bow
[1:39:28] to the name of jesus christ he conquered
[1:39:31] and he didn't just conquer here but he
[1:39:33] went down into hell and conquered hell
[1:39:35] death and the grave hallelujah so he is
[1:39:38] the mightiest one that's ever been in
[1:39:39] flesh
[1:39:40] is our lord jesus christ amen he is a
[1:39:43] mighty man
[1:39:44] and the bible says he's a mighty man of
[1:39:46] war
[1:39:47] we think sometimes jesus is some hippie
[1:39:49] jesus just walks around saying peace and
[1:39:50] you know chill out man and
[1:39:52] everything's not you know you take the
[1:39:54] bible the other cartoon bible
[1:39:55] things that girls watch sometimes just
[1:39:57] hippie jesus everything's all nice and
[1:40:00] flowers and but he's a man of war
[1:40:03] he's not afraid when the devil makes a
[1:40:05] challenge he's not afraid to accept that
[1:40:06] challenge hallelujah he is
[1:40:09] he is more than able to meet every
[1:40:10] challenge amen but he will use you and i
[1:40:13] he'll use his arrows
[1:40:16] to meet the challenge hallelujah you
[1:40:19] take david david was in the quiver of
[1:40:20] the lord
[1:40:21] he was fired into the earth and goliath
[1:40:23] made his boast
[1:40:24] hallelujah but this arrow was going to
[1:40:26] prove what it was built on
[1:40:28] amen david had a revelation that goliath
[1:40:30] was going down
[1:40:32] he says today i'll cut your head off
[1:40:33] didn't even have his own sword
[1:40:35] hallelujah but he had a revelation
[1:40:37] brother ram said that
[1:40:38] the rest of israel knew it could be done
[1:40:40] but it was revealed to david that
[1:40:42] goliath was going to die
[1:40:44] and that he was going to do it so here
[1:40:46] was he was an arrow now and he was going
[1:40:48] to show this is what i'm built i'm built
[1:40:50] up i'm built on revelation hallelujah
[1:40:54] and we know what happened goliath became
[1:40:57] two pieces
[1:40:58] david was still alive hallelujah
[1:41:02] amen now an arrow has an intended
[1:41:05] purpose it's not just for decoration
[1:41:08] but you only know the potential and the
[1:41:11] potency of a weapon when it's put in use
[1:41:14] i mean god's attributes which are his
[1:41:16] children are incredibly
[1:41:18] powerful you know you you're the most
[1:41:19] powerful people in the world
[1:41:21] you are the most powerful people in the
[1:41:22] world you are
[1:41:24] not the u.n not the us military chinese
[1:41:27] russian whatever all their bombs you're
[1:41:28] the most powerful people in all the
[1:41:30] world
[1:41:30] hallelujah you have a weapon they know
[1:41:32] nothing about
[1:41:34] amen we are built to turn down the
[1:41:36] devil's lie
[1:41:37] and not only to to discern his
[1:41:40] antichrist spirit but discern
[1:41:42] and withstand it hallelujah so it's not
[1:41:45] just identifying there's the devil on
[1:41:47] the radar no we can withstand him
[1:41:50] amen when he comes to try and come in
[1:41:52] and make us formal lukewarm and
[1:41:53] powerless
[1:41:54] i mean the bride of christ is able to
[1:41:56] discern that and withstand it
[1:41:58] amen we we are not here to become formal
[1:42:01] lukewarm and powerless
[1:42:04] god bless you brother indeed i'm glad
[1:42:05] someone's agreeing with me hallelujah
[1:42:08] amen we are not here to be just just
[1:42:10] just have a form of religion just go
[1:42:12] through the motions well it's sunday i
[1:42:14] guess i'll go to church it's what i do
[1:42:15] that's not what we're here for i mean
[1:42:17] we're not here just to have a form of
[1:42:18] godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:42:21] we're not here just to be lukewarm which
[1:42:23] is a
[1:42:24] lacking conviction just well i guess i
[1:42:26] should i don't know and this and this no
[1:42:28] we're not we're called to be on fire
[1:42:31] amen and not powerless but powerful
[1:42:34] amen because remember if god if jesus
[1:42:36] conquered hell death in the grave
[1:42:38] and that same anointing's in you well
[1:42:40] what's gonna what's gonna happen in your
[1:42:41] life
[1:42:42] you'll overcome all things the bible
[1:42:44] says that we are more than conquerors
[1:42:47] so not just conquerors more than
[1:42:49] conquerors
[1:42:50] hallelujah you talk about a one-sided
[1:42:53] battle
[1:42:55] hallelujah because we're more than
[1:42:56] conquerors it's not going to be a close
[1:42:58] run thing we're going to walk out of
[1:42:59] this world as an overcomer
[1:43:02] hallelujah now arrows or any weapons
[1:43:05] they must be designed and constructed a
[1:43:08] certain way
[1:43:10] and from a certain material not only to
[1:43:13] fly
[1:43:14] in a certain path but to but to hit the
[1:43:17] target
[1:43:18] and to pass through that target what
[1:43:20] good would an arrow be
[1:43:22] just like we go back in the dark ages
[1:43:24] and and we're a bunch of archers
[1:43:26] right and i know we're fighting
[1:43:29] whoever's doesn't matter because
[1:43:30] everyone fought everyone eventually you
[1:43:31] know
[1:43:31] you know so we're there and we've got
[1:43:33] these arrows and they look real good
[1:43:34] but we've got to fire at the enemy and
[1:43:37] it flies like this all crazy and then
[1:43:39] when it hits the enemy it just
[1:43:40] disintegrates
[1:43:42] that ain't gonna work but if it was
[1:43:45] built from the right material
[1:43:47] it will pierce the enemy's armor and it
[1:43:49] will go to the killing place it will
[1:43:50] kill the thing
[1:43:51] right so it has to be built a certain
[1:43:54] way now
[1:43:55] just as an arrow must be built out of a
[1:43:57] certain material
[1:43:59] to to not only hit the target and pierce
[1:44:02] that target it's the same
[1:44:03] thing with god's children
[1:44:06] amen we are here we have been built out
[1:44:10] of a material which is indestructible
[1:44:14] which is the word of god amen if he is
[1:44:16] the word and the bride is part of the
[1:44:18] bridegroom so she is the word also
[1:44:20] as you receive the word you become the
[1:44:22] words it's less of your humanity and
[1:44:24] more of his deity in you
[1:44:26] i mean so we are actually built of a
[1:44:28] material that is indestructible
[1:44:31] i'm not talking about your flesh and
[1:44:32] bones because we all are very aware of
[1:44:34] those limitations i'm talking about the
[1:44:35] seed that's within you
[1:44:37] hallelujah that we are built with a
[1:44:39] material that will pass through all
[1:44:41] trouble it will pass through all
[1:44:43] unbelief
[1:44:44] what's good having a perfect arrow that
[1:44:46] will fly straight but the arrowhead's
[1:44:47] made of wood
[1:44:49] and you and you have to pass through
[1:44:50] something that's metal that ain't going
[1:44:52] to work
[1:44:53] right your arrowhead's got to be sharper
[1:44:55] or stronger whatever they can actually
[1:44:56] pass through the target
[1:44:58] amen so we are built of the revelation
[1:45:01] of the word of god
[1:45:03] we are not built on a knowledge of the
[1:45:05] word of god we're built on revelation
[1:45:08] that's the material that the church has
[1:45:09] built
[1:45:11] from is the revelation of the word of
[1:45:13] god where it goes from a memory verse to
[1:45:15] a reality
[1:45:16] we all need the memory verse but it's
[1:45:18] going to drop down to reality
[1:45:20] because we're not built by a mental
[1:45:21] understanding of the word but when it's
[1:45:23] revealed to you
[1:45:24] just like i said about john it was
[1:45:26] revealed to him he was beyond the
[1:45:27] curtain of time
[1:45:28] hallelujah amen
[1:45:33] amen so that we are designed now a child
[1:45:36] here in the scripture
[1:45:37] it means a son or a as a builder of the
[1:45:41] family name
[1:45:42] that's what it means to be a child
[1:45:44] you're actually building the family
[1:45:45] names you're constructing something
[1:45:47] maybe it was just blueprints but yes
[1:45:49] like a house or this building it was
[1:45:50] once blueprints now it became material
[1:45:53] however as children of god we are not
[1:45:55] here to build a church
[1:45:58] brand right this is not about church
[1:46:01] brands and i go to this church i go
[1:46:03] that's that's actually irrelevant no but
[1:46:06] we are part of the body of christ
[1:46:08] and we're all part of the construction i
[1:46:11] mean that the family name would be built
[1:46:13] it would be established it would
[1:46:14] you know it would be erected it would be
[1:46:16] built up i mean just like jesus told his
[1:46:18] disciples
[1:46:19] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:46:21] that believe he's going to show this is
[1:46:23] how you're going to build the family
[1:46:24] name
[1:46:24] and we know the family name is the name
[1:46:26] of jesus christ
[1:46:27] all in heaven and earth are named by his
[1:46:30] after his own name we're called by that
[1:46:32] name
[1:46:33] hallelujah that's why we're baptized in
[1:46:35] his name not in the titles of god
[1:46:38] amen so he said these signs shall fire
[1:46:41] them to believe in my name thou shall
[1:46:42] cast out devils why you got to get rid
[1:46:44] of a squatter to build
[1:46:46] right just like with healing there's a
[1:46:48] squatter on the land you got to cast it
[1:46:49] out speak in new tongues
[1:46:51] i mean god takes over any if you drink
[1:46:53] any deadly thing it shall not harm you
[1:46:54] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:46:56] that's the instructions of every
[1:46:58] believer this is how you're going to
[1:47:00] build the family name
[1:47:02] hallelujah amen
[1:47:08] amen as i said now a while back
[1:47:13] if you're if your rocket is balanced it
[1:47:15] will fly in a straight path
[1:47:18] now james i would say in james be
[1:47:20] patient therefore brethren unto the
[1:47:21] coming of the lord
[1:47:23] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[1:47:25] precious fruit of the earth
[1:47:26] and hath long patience for it until he
[1:47:28] received the early
[1:47:30] and latter rain be also patient
[1:47:33] establish your heart for the coming of
[1:47:35] the lord draweth nigh
[1:47:36] grudge not one against another brother
[1:47:38] unless you be condemned behold the judge
[1:47:40] standeth before the door
[1:47:42] so saying here to establish your heart
[1:47:44] now this means
[1:47:45] to establish means to sit fast to turn
[1:47:48] resolutely in a certain direction
[1:47:50] hallelujah so if you make up your mind
[1:47:53] jesus
[1:47:54] jesus forgave me a great big debt
[1:47:59] amen i had a debt i couldn't pay he had
[1:48:02] a debt he did not owe
[1:48:03] but yet he freely forgave me without
[1:48:05] money or price
[1:48:06] he didn't hold it against me his blood
[1:48:08] was attributed to me
[1:48:09] i mean he paid my debt now if he forgave
[1:48:12] me all things cannot we forgive each
[1:48:14] other
[1:48:15] little things amen we should establish
[1:48:17] our hearts which is our emotion it
[1:48:18] should be fixed in a certain direction
[1:48:20] i'm going to serve the lord i've i've
[1:48:22] gone beyond the point of no return
[1:48:25] it doesn't matter what comes or goes i'm
[1:48:27] going to walk with god
[1:48:29] hallelujah amen because you think about
[1:48:31] our emotional realm or no rather the
[1:48:33] fruits of the spirit
[1:48:34] they are all supernatural take one for
[1:48:38] example joy
[1:48:40] joy is not joy is the fruit of the
[1:48:42] spirit is not a human joy
[1:48:44] it's just not based upon circumstance
[1:48:46] it's not based upon how big your back
[1:48:47] balance is or how good your holidays are
[1:48:49] or
[1:48:50] you know your new car or or a job
[1:48:52] promotion or how your family's going
[1:48:54] that is not that is not joy of the fruit
[1:48:56] of the spirit
[1:48:57] i mean but the joy that's in the fruit
[1:49:00] of the spirit is the joy of the lord
[1:49:02] amen and the joy of the lord is actually
[1:49:04] god's own joy
[1:49:05] put into you amen as david would pray
[1:49:08] lord restore unto me the joy
[1:49:10] of thy salvation not my salvation but
[1:49:13] thy salvation so lord restore that
[1:49:16] joy amen the joy that your salvation has
[1:49:18] fallen upon me
[1:49:20] and i'm saved by your salvation how this
[1:49:22] it's a supernatural joy where we can
[1:49:24] rejoice in even the greatest trouble
[1:49:26] why do you think the apostle paul and
[1:49:28] silas could sit in a prison
[1:49:30] you know and they weren't looked after
[1:49:32] you know they had just been beaten
[1:49:34] maybe just thrown into the inner cell in
[1:49:36] stocks you know maybe in the worst spot
[1:49:38] they didn't just they didn't begin to
[1:49:40] eat the bread of sorrows
[1:49:42] oh but the lord called us and you know
[1:49:44] he's the greater mighty god and why do
[1:49:46] we have this trouble and look at what
[1:49:47] this person did
[1:49:48] no they begin to sing i've got a home in
[1:49:52] glory land that outshines the sun
[1:49:55] i know what songs they sung but you know
[1:49:57] they begin to rejoice why because the
[1:49:59] joy the lord was bubbling up
[1:50:01] hallelujah and god came down and shook
[1:50:02] the place and set them free
[1:50:05] hallelujah so now so just take that one
[1:50:07] see
[1:50:08] joy is a supernatural fruit just like
[1:50:11] all of them are
[1:50:13] hallelujah amen so now the believer as i
[1:50:17] said is built
[1:50:18] of the revelation of the word and they
[1:50:21] are part of the lord jesus who is the
[1:50:23] word
[1:50:24] the believer is that manifestation of
[1:50:26] the word
[1:50:27] that's no longer just ink on paper but
[1:50:29] it's put on flesh in them
[1:50:31] hallelujah remember we have we have a
[1:50:35] we have a word to fulfill brotherhood
[1:50:38] says in the rapture god allotted his
[1:50:39] word out to each age
[1:50:41] and each one of those ages has to
[1:50:42] manifest that and he also for ordained
[1:50:45] men for that age to fulfill that word
[1:50:47] every time he allotted his word he
[1:50:49] allotted a man for it when he allotted
[1:50:51] moses time he allotted moses to it
[1:50:53] when he loaded a lot of the time of the
[1:50:55] son of god to be born he allotted him to
[1:50:57] it every age he's allotted as man four
[1:50:59] ordained as the bible said
[1:51:00] so even in this age you know we are
[1:51:02] fulfilling scripture
[1:51:04] we are fulfilling revelations 10 8-11 to
[1:51:07] take the book
[1:51:08] to eat the book to prophesy again that's
[1:51:10] actually our part of the scripture
[1:51:12] i mean to actually speak out the context
[1:51:14] of the word
[1:51:15] hallelujah amen that a life would be
[1:51:17] lived amen of the word amen when the
[1:51:19] word talks about liberty that liberty
[1:51:21] should be manifested
[1:51:22] when the word talks about a divine love
[1:51:24] the capstone coming upon a bride
[1:51:26] i mean that should be manifested in a
[1:51:27] people i mean overcoming power i mean
[1:51:30] forgiveness of sins whatever it is
[1:51:31] that's in the word there's a liberty in
[1:51:33] the church today
[1:51:34] how that we are actually in the
[1:51:36] liberation of the sons of god and where
[1:51:38] people's eyes have come open to realize
[1:51:40] we do not belong to the
[1:51:41] to the devil hallelujah
[1:51:45] amen amen says according as he has
[1:51:48] chosen us in him before
[1:51:49] the foundation of the world i'm going to
[1:51:51] wind this up soon that we should be holy
[1:51:53] and without blame before him in love now
[1:51:55] this is the flight path we're to go
[1:51:57] through
[1:51:58] having predestined us into the adoption
[1:52:00] of children by jesus christ
[1:52:02] to himself according to the good
[1:52:04] pleasure of his will
[1:52:06] so he's predestinated us unto the
[1:52:08] adoption of children
[1:52:10] now we know in the scripture that
[1:52:12] adoption in the scripture is different
[1:52:13] to adoption today
[1:52:15] and in adoption today i could take a
[1:52:17] child who is not
[1:52:18] born it's not part of my family it's not
[1:52:21] my child
[1:52:22] and i would sign some papers i'd legally
[1:52:24] become my child
[1:52:25] that's adoption right but that's not
[1:52:26] bible adoption bible adoption is the
[1:52:29] placing of a son or daughter
[1:52:30] in a position of power authority within
[1:52:33] the family
[1:52:33] so they're already born into the family
[1:52:35] now there's going to be a place in where
[1:52:37] there'll be place and power and
[1:52:38] authority
[1:52:39] hallelujah so we have been pre-dis this
[1:52:41] is your this is your flight path who's
[1:52:44] ever flown overseas and you got on the
[1:52:45] map and it shows you where you're going
[1:52:47] and time to destination
[1:52:48] and you and you and you're in your mind
[1:52:50] you're thinking this is going way too
[1:52:51] slow and
[1:52:52] but but there's a flight path that
[1:52:54] planes fly
[1:52:55] they don't just say well australia's
[1:52:57] this way and they turn and there they go
[1:52:58] no they've got a they've got a flight
[1:53:00] path
[1:53:01] and but it's a it's a pre the flight
[1:53:03] path has been predetermined
[1:53:05] it's already been set hallelujah and the
[1:53:08] pilot
[1:53:08] yields to that flight path and flies
[1:53:10] that flight path it's just like
[1:53:12] our walk has been predestined by god
[1:53:15] amen it's already been set
[1:53:17] we just have to yield but yeah yo the
[1:53:20] apostle paul said whatever state you
[1:53:22] find yourself in right now be content
[1:53:26] hallelujah rich paul whatever whatever
[1:53:27] just be content and where you are right
[1:53:29] now
[1:53:30] because this is the will of god
[1:53:31] concerning you
[1:53:33] hallelujah so now our our path has been
[1:53:37] ordained that we would come to an
[1:53:39] adoption
[1:53:40] of children so if you've been born into
[1:53:42] the family of god
[1:53:44] you will come to your position because
[1:53:46] it's been predestinated
[1:53:48] hallelujah and we know
[1:53:52] that even even many people think they
[1:53:54] are not in their position but god has
[1:53:56] already put them in that position
[1:53:58] if you've got the baptism of the holy
[1:54:00] ghost actually i see god saying
[1:54:01] you're in your place hallelujah so don't
[1:54:04] wait for some future event just use what
[1:54:06] you got right now
[1:54:09] amen and and we know the fullness of
[1:54:11] adoption is actually the change of our
[1:54:12] body
[1:54:14] how this is not just to be filled with
[1:54:16] the holy ghost and place into the body
[1:54:17] of christ
[1:54:18] but the fullness of adoption is the
[1:54:20] change of this body
[1:54:22] where we read there in romans 8 for we
[1:54:24] know that the whole creation groaneth
[1:54:26] and travails and pain together until now
[1:54:28] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:54:31] which have the first fruits of the
[1:54:32] spirit even we
[1:54:34] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:54:36] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:54:39] of our body so our flight path
[1:54:42] has been set hallelujah
[1:54:46] now it may appear very bumpy you can
[1:54:49] look into all the believers lives
[1:54:50] through the ages
[1:54:51] joseph had a dream he's gonna his family
[1:54:53] was gonna bow to him he had no idea the
[1:54:55] turbulence that he would go through to
[1:54:56] get there
[1:54:58] amen david was was anointed by samuel
[1:55:00] you were gonna be king
[1:55:01] he had no idea the turbulence he had to
[1:55:03] go through to get to the throne
[1:55:05] right samuel did not sit him down okay
[1:55:07] he said listen you're going to be an
[1:55:08] outcast
[1:55:09] you're going to act crazy before the
[1:55:11] king of the philistines just to save
[1:55:12] your own skin
[1:55:13] you're going to do this and you're going
[1:55:15] to take bathsheba and this is going to
[1:55:16] happen you're going to number the p
[1:55:17] no none of that was was was told
[1:55:21] right but his flight path was set
[1:55:26] now how can we be arrows in the lord's
[1:55:29] hand well i'll just take this brother
[1:55:32] braham says in paradox about
[1:55:33] samson picking up the jawbone of the of
[1:55:35] the donkey
[1:55:37] he says that he you know he downed a
[1:55:39] thousand philistines with that jawbone
[1:55:41] and then the prophet says if we could
[1:55:43] only just be jaw bones in the hand of
[1:55:45] god
[1:55:46] there'd be another paradox he says yes
[1:55:48] it was he said well we can't be arrows
[1:55:50] in his hand yeah we can but if we're
[1:55:51] just a yielded instrument
[1:55:53] god can use this as he wants now i'll
[1:55:55] just finish with this quote because i
[1:55:57] feel time has escaped
[1:55:58] now jesus christ he says no matter if he
[1:56:00] was in a storm and a gale is knocking
[1:56:02] uh as knocking the boat from one side to
[1:56:05] another
[1:56:06] or he was standing in a uh in a face a
[1:56:09] mess of demons if he was hanging
[1:56:10] anywhere it never moved him
[1:56:12] he walked right on just as calm and
[1:56:14] quiet as he could be why
[1:56:15] he was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:56:18] anything around him that's right
[1:56:19] whether it was going to happen or
[1:56:21] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[1:56:23] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:56:24] god
[1:56:25] said so he didn't say oh have i prayed
[1:56:27] through wonder if i fasted long enough
[1:56:29] wonder if i did this
[1:56:30] he just walked right on unconscious that
[1:56:33] that's right he believed that god
[1:56:35] what god said was truth the words must
[1:56:38] be fulfilled and he knowed
[1:56:40] what his life was to fulfill them that's
[1:56:42] right do you know your life is to
[1:56:44] for to fulfill a rapture do you know
[1:56:47] that we
[1:56:48] that's our prophecy they which are alive
[1:56:50] and remain will not
[1:56:51] you know hinder those are asleep but the
[1:56:53] dead in christ will rise first
[1:56:55] and then we which are alive man we
[1:56:56] caught up to meet them together in the
[1:56:58] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[1:57:00] you know we are part of that rapture
[1:57:01] cycle the lord the sitting with a shout
[1:57:03] the voice of the
[1:57:04] archangel then the trump of god you know
[1:57:06] we're part of that prophecy
[1:57:08] when the you know when god inspired the
[1:57:10] apostle paul to write that he had you
[1:57:12] on his mind god did because there's got
[1:57:15] to be someone to fulfill that word
[1:57:17] that's allotted to this age
[1:57:19] right so he so jesus could walk on no
[1:57:21] matter if the devil was there no devil
[1:57:23] trouble no trouble storm no storm
[1:57:25] because he knew what god said was right
[1:57:27] and he knew
[1:57:28] that he was there to fulfill that word
[1:57:32] and you're here to fulfill it too
[1:57:35] just walk unconscious affair walk
[1:57:39] unconscious of criticism
[1:57:41] walk unconscious enter the world now
[1:57:42] remember he's not saying
[1:57:44] uh you can only walk this way if these
[1:57:46] things are not there no just walk
[1:57:47] unconscious of it don't let it grip you
[1:57:50] don't let it trouble you amen walk as
[1:57:53] you walk in christ
[1:57:54] walk with him not paying any attention

[1:57:58] left hand just keep moving on if
[1:58:00] something comes up in the church walk

[1:58:29] leave you nor forsake you
[1:58:31] i'll be with you to the end of the world
[1:58:33] and he took an oath by that covenant
[1:58:34] that he'd give you
[1:58:35] that he would confirm it just walk with
[1:58:38] god you'll have your ups and downs don't
[1:58:41] worry you've got to go through briar

[1:58:47] mountains over waters just walk with god
[1:58:50] yes sir there's so many hills to climb
[1:58:52] upward you've heard the old song but

[1:59:12] very much
[1:59:14] hallelujah why because we've got to the
[1:59:16] end of the way
[1:59:17] i'll say this if the lord has opened
[1:59:19] this to you if the message has gone from
[1:59:21] doctrine to a person
[1:59:23] it's become a reality what's the lord
[1:59:26] telling you
[1:59:27] you're over that you've got a a
[1:59:29] theophany over there
[1:59:31] you actually have a target i fired you
[1:59:33] into this world not for you to stay in
[1:59:35] this world but to go from this world
[1:59:36] into eternity

[2:15:32] in the body so members of the same body
[2:15:36] so the mouth will speak
[2:15:39] you hear the mouth but the eyes doesn't
[2:15:42] speak
[2:15:43] he sees the ear hears
[2:15:46] so you don't even see the intestine
[2:15:50] but it's working very hard 24 7.

[2:16:12] and we remember it too and together
[2:16:15] we'll
[2:16:16] make it to glory so just to be very
[2:16:18] brief i'm going to leave
[2:16:20] a word with you
[2:16:24] that is keep pressing the battle
[2:16:29] amen because we are actually in a very
[2:16:32] very fierce
[2:16:34] world war you don't see these devils
[2:16:38] but they're there so um
[2:16:42] on tuesday jesus testimony before i read
[2:16:44] the quote
[2:16:46] about 7 15 i was driving on the
[2:16:49] on the city in in the town wakatani
[2:16:53] um so it was like a quiet evening i was
[2:16:56] driving
[2:16:58] 50 kilometers per hour and then um
[2:17:01] i had a noise a noise like a bang
[2:17:06] so before i could say what's happening
[2:17:08] as a dog flew
[2:17:09] right into my front and i hit that dog
[2:17:13] and
[2:17:14] um the car was you can imagine
[2:17:18] was a you know damaged so it's actually
[2:17:20] with
[2:17:22] with the um car repair so we
[2:17:25] we don't know um
[2:17:30] what tomorrow holds but one thing is
[2:17:32] sure we'll know him that host tomorrow
[2:17:34] and we have that confidence so president
[2:17:37] battle
[2:17:40] rob said the other morning i was laying
[2:17:42] on my bed and
[2:17:43] i had just walked i walked from the
[2:17:45] sleep and i placed my hands behind my
[2:17:47] head and relaxed
[2:17:48] my my head on the pillow then i began to
[2:17:51] wonder
[2:17:52] what it would be like
[2:17:56] on the other side hallelujah
[2:17:59] so when you're thinking about the other
[2:18:00] side you have no time to hit anybody
[2:18:04] you can only forgive 24 7.
[2:18:07] amen praise the lord i mean you love
[2:18:10] everybody man
[2:18:11] so i realized that i i have lived more
[2:18:13] than half my life and i live
[2:18:15] to be as old as my people and i wanted
[2:18:18] to to do more for the lord
[2:18:20] before i left this life and i had a
[2:18:23] voice
[2:18:24] saying you are just starting
[2:18:27] press the battle keep pressing
[2:18:32] and i i lay there pondering the words i
[2:18:35] thought
[2:18:36] that i just imagined that i had heard a
[2:18:38] voice and again the voice said
[2:18:40] press the battle keep
[2:18:43] going keep going still
[2:18:47] i was still on believing i thought that
[2:18:48] probably was possibly i spoke
[2:18:50] there was myself i placed my lips
[2:18:53] between my teeth
[2:18:54] and i held and held my hand over my
[2:18:57] mouth
[2:18:58] and listened the voice spoke again
[2:19:01] just keep pressing if you
[2:19:04] only know what is at the end of the road
[2:19:09] like god spoke to us today your life
[2:19:11] shall be planned
[2:19:13] and we see the end from beginning god
[2:19:16] said malachi 4 go
[2:19:17] when before the the world began
[2:19:20] brought on mystery i said this is who
[2:19:22] you are amen
[2:19:24] this is your destiny okay so um
[2:19:27] so you know the story about that the
[2:19:30] testimony about be
[2:19:31] beyond the curtains i'm not going to go
[2:19:32] to that but um
[2:19:35] after i told this story so
[2:19:38] um and he said the the voice spoke to me
[2:19:43] this experience um
[2:19:46] that's what you preach that the holy
[2:19:49] ghost is
[2:19:50] perfect love nothing can enter there
[2:19:55] without it
[2:19:59] praise the lord and
[2:20:03] in conclusion i am more convinced than
[2:20:07] ever
[2:20:08] in my life that it will take perfect
[2:20:11] love
[2:20:12] to enter that place there was no
[2:20:16] jealousy
[2:20:18] no tiredness no sickness
[2:20:22] no old age no death only supreme beauty
[2:20:26] and joy whatever you do
[2:20:29] lay aside everything else until you get
[2:20:32] perfect love get to where you can love
[2:20:36] everybody
[2:20:38] even every enemy
[2:20:42] no matter if the plane is rocking
[2:20:47] the lightning is flashing or the guns of
[2:20:49] the enemy are upon you
[2:20:52] these things do not matter
[2:20:55] get perfect love
[2:20:58] god bless you thank you

[2:22:59] welcoming and he was looking forward to
[2:23:01] seeing us
[2:23:03] so i went back and then it was
[2:23:06] in taranaki it was me and the kids
[2:23:10] so i went back and told them about this
[2:23:12] brother this pastor that just emailed us
[2:23:14] that we are going to the service
[2:23:16] and um jeremy and pal weren't too sure
[2:23:23] but peter dave is the bravest he will
[2:23:24] always get it
[2:23:28] so granny said let's go mom let's go
[2:23:30] let's go check it out
[2:23:32] so we came to church for the first time
[2:23:34] on that date
[2:23:36] we sat here and robin preached such a
[2:23:39] wonderful message
[2:23:41] and it was a bit different from
[2:23:45] what you know i've been in the message
[2:23:48] since i was a child
[2:23:50] but um when i had brother ben preach
[2:23:53] brother ben i'm sorry you don't like
[2:23:56] people saying thank you to you but i
[2:23:58] take a different view
[2:24:00] i like to give honor to her no it's due
[2:24:03] and i like to say thank you
[2:24:04] you know and appreciate people you know
[2:24:07] so
[2:24:09] after that message it was wonderful we
[2:24:11] took the testimony back to
[2:24:14] the two other people that weren't too
[2:24:15] sure and then they said oh we're going
[2:24:18] we're going to go
[2:24:19] so we went and jeremy was still growing
[2:24:21] in the lord at the time
[2:24:23] you know so we came
[2:24:28] jeremy i'm sorry i'm going to give that
[2:24:31] testimony about you
[2:24:33] jeremy comes to church and one hour's
[2:24:35] service is too long for you
[2:24:38] so what he does is he goes to drink
[2:24:40] water he comes back and he sits
[2:24:42] not one hour we have more than one hour
[2:24:44] maybe two where we came from
[2:24:46] [Laughter]
[2:24:49] sometimes six hours sometimes okay
[2:24:53] so he's often you know but the first
[2:24:56] time we came here he was sitting there
[2:24:59] and he did not move
[2:25:03] like throughout the service he did not
[2:25:05] move he was an hour long
[2:25:06] and he did not move and he was whipping
[2:25:09] and that was because he saw the message
[2:25:12] in simplicity
[2:25:13] you know so that was that was wonderful
[2:25:18] and immediately after the service people
[2:25:20] that did not know you before
[2:25:22] were so loving so welcoming so
[2:25:26] i did not i could not believe it you
[2:25:28] know everybody wanted to invite us over
[2:25:31] and it was simply amazing and i saw the
[2:25:34] love of god among the brethren
[2:25:37] and that was what kept us through the
[2:25:40] years
[2:25:41] so brother ben i want to say thank you
[2:25:45] so much
[2:25:46] for giving to the lord so that the lord
[2:25:48] can use you to bless us
[2:25:49] thank you and sister christine such a

[2:39:54] you know he just blessed me so much when
[2:39:56] i saw him this morning and
[2:39:58] i didn't know what to say so i just
[2:39:59] asked him to pray
[2:40:02] because he had such an atmosphere i
[2:40:04] think amen
[2:40:06] but the blessed the eyes that can see
[2:40:08] the spirit of god you know when it works
[2:40:10] in a child

[2:40:21] and between the three of songs
[2:40:25] then the lord just led this one to us we
[2:40:28] thought we could just
[2:40:29] mix a bit of english and
[2:40:33] and um house is it hausa and one of the
[2:40:36] languages in nigeria is not igbo
[2:40:38] i think it's in her house so it's
[2:40:41] in-house it's a nigerian language
[2:40:43] so we thought we can combine english and
[2:40:46] africa
[2:40:47] for a bit just to sing to our brother
[2:40:51] and sister in the family
[2:40:53] so if you hear us missing
