Make This Tri of bling I actually it ago of the My Life um that was when my daughter Abigail Gottis came close to death and then the months and years that followed were not easy as she recovered and I really wanted to sing the song again but I wanted I felt like it wasn't hadn't become a blessing the trial um but in just in recent times you know the Lord has been so good and I really feel now I can

make your child a blessing and the whole wide world will see [Applause] that was a beautiful special by the way um so I'm going to sing a song which was written by a friend who lives in the states um the inspiration for the song comes from when Jesus is preaching um about unless you eat my flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me and most of his disciples from that time went back and they walked no more with him and then Jesus said unto the 12 will you also go away and then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God from John 6 um I'm trying to work on when things seem impossible to just just keep trusting in the word of God to whom shall we go if you have the words of life and where can I run [Music] there's nowhere to run to whom shall we go if you have the words of life and where can I run there's nowhere to run I could run to my own understanding I could trust what I feel or what I see but my heart fails me my heart fails me I could run to my own understanding I could trust what I feel or what what I see but my heart fails me my heart fails me so are unto the rock of the ages I will stand on the word The Original Seed cuz that won't fail me see God can't fail me so are unto the rock of the ages and I will stand on the word The Original Seed cuz that won't fail me see God can't fail me with a resurrection power peace in my darkest d a strong and mighty tower and his words Speak Life to me with resurrection power peace in my darkest star a

and Jess God bless you amen great to have you amen amen praise the Lord amen Let's uh go to the scripture uh uh this morning we're going to go to first uh Corinthians chapter 10: 13 amen so praise the Lord amen let's just read this here just one um we got two two verses to read one here and then ver and then John 10 and10 so it's interesting how the songs will line up I like how God orchestrates things don't you I'm because I'm going to talk about way of Escape today there's always a way of Escape if that's all you get out of the service that's all you need to get out there's always a way out of Escape of out of every Temptation every trial every trap of the devil there's always a way of Escape amen amen so let's read this together there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of escape to escape that ye may be able to bear it so remember if there's Temptation there's a way of Escape they always go together there's never the Temptation without a way of Escape okay amen then um John 10 and 10 in a a familiar uh scripture here the Lord Jesus speaking says um the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy that's what he comes to do trap you think there's no way out it's hopeless but I am come that you may have life and you may have it more abundantly amen praise the Lord so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning if you have a need just want to raise your hand to the Lord say Lord come by my way today amen let's pray amen almighty God we thank you so much we can bow our heads and hearts in your presence Lord we're so thankful that Lord there's nothing Lord formed that can prosper against us Lord you're the greatest one Lord you conquered how death in the grave we're so thankful we Face a conquered into me this morning Lord CU you are still Victorious this day and I pray father as we've read your word I ask Lord you anointed to speaker and hearer Lord may you take control Lord I want to get myself out of the way that you can do what you want to do so Lord may you have your free course this day father may you be lifted up and glorified in our midst father we love you Lord we ask your blood would cover us all Lord Jesus may protect us Lord may you have preeminence in our lives those who aren't here today dear God be their abundant portion as well Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats um this morning so I want to talk about God or always has a way of Escape amen so we live in a day where the devil is uh has many traps and tricks and everything and and we know the devil's uh uh scheme or plan is always is always to make us think that there's never a way out amen but but it doesn't matter what comes your way what Temptation comes your way there is always a way of Escape amen because we know hopelessness doesn't come from God that's from Satan he wants you to feel hopeless he wants you to feel that life is too overwhelming you can't get through this no answer there's always an answer amen and our Lord Jesus Christ is that answer so as as the Lord has come to give a way of Escape so the devil we know his job is to steal kill and to destroy he wants to take your life captive amen but our God is here to deliver amen set us free to walk with him in his word now brother BR makes a statement he says and make your way he says sickness pins you into a corner Satan pins you down to a place where you um after you become a Christian maybe you've been a gambler you see it the cards are on the table come on John you know it's in you Satan's there to tempt you but God is in every time we'll make a way of Escape if you'll just accept it so there's a principle God always makes a way of Escape but you've got to choose to walk out of it like so for example if there's a fire in this building there's a fire exit it's you know they've been labeled you know which way of escape to take you've got to get out of your seat and go out right if you don't well there's no there wasn't anything wrong with the way of Escape you just got to walk through it amen so you've got to choose to to to walk out of these things you've youve got to accept that way of Escape maybe you've been a drunker of glasses under your nose now come on John now if you want to heed to that voice you'll go right uh right out to your wallow again but God is always there turn your minds towards heaven and look towards Calvary and say blessed Holy Spirit come to me I'm a need watch what takes place God Will Make A Way of Escape every time for he will God has always did it amen so and every time there's always been a way of Escape I'm going to repeat this cuz I pray this would just anchor into our hearts because we got to realize through life's journey the devil's going to try and pin us on something he'll put us into some secret addiction where on the outside we look fine but on the inside what's going on I mean we're we're we're out outwardly we look like like Believers but inwardly we're entertaining his Spirit maybe pornography lust or whatever it is hatred malice Strife Envy whatever it is you know and and and but there's a way of Escape out of that and many times we think you know the devil wants us to say well you've gone too far you've been too long you've come back to it again there's no way out this time he's lying to you the devil's lying to you amen there's always a way of Escape amen if but you got to take it amen amen praise the Lord now we're going to realize our way of Escape isn't just an exit uh just an exit but but that exit has power in it to Deliver Us from these things so Moses Moses was commanded you know we know that when um um you know they came to the Red Sea they didn't come there haphazardly if you read the account God directed them right there and they come up to the Red Sea the um pharaoh and his armies behind and you know all of the all of the Israelites are panicking you know you you've brought us out here to die and this is the first thing that the devil wants to do is put fear Upon Our Lives who being trapped in this place or in trouble but they were walking right in the pathway that God had led them to walk and because you got to realize that God doesn't just want to deliver us he wants us to know that our enemy that's come against us is dead that it can't come and get you no more I mean so there one thing for Israel to come out of Egypt but it was another thing for them to come out and their pursuers that that they couldn't pursue them no more that their enemy was was dead that's why they came to the Red Sea cuz if you think about it if Israel just walked out of um um walked out of Egypt but the Egyptians weren't taken care of there would have been a fear they could come get us again they're still the superpower of the age sure God's done all these things but they could come and get us so God wants to eliminate that fear out of our Lives amen that he wants to kill that fear that that thing that once beat you and tore you down and made you a slave and that your cruel Taskmaster he wants you know that thing won't bother you no more amen so before the Red Sea ever parted before God ever gave the way of Escape we know Moses was looking for it because Moses was anointed not just to take them to the Red Sea not just to take them to SI but to take them into the promised land so he realized Lord my journey isn't done am mean my commission isn't completely fulfilled sure you've brought Israel out with a mighty hand but you're going to take them in am mean so he realized this obstacle had to move because this wasn't his End Amen and you got to realize friends we're got a Rapture to enjoy I we got a body change to happen to us amen this message came to transform your life amen that the Fulfillment the promise of all the ages the dead in Christ raising and the Believers being changed to meet the Lord in the air you're here to fulfill that that's your end destination so no that God will give a way of Escape that whatever's holding you won't hold you because that's your destination Hallelujah so so remember Moses prophesied to Israel before this ever happened these Egyptians you see today you'll see them no more forever this is the last time you see your oppressor this is the last time you see your accuser this is the last time you see your slave master he's going to drown Hallelujah we know the rest of the story God part of the Red Sea Hallelujah they walk through on dry ground the enemy tried to pursue see a way of Escape is Deliverance to you it's a trap for your devil a trap for the devil trying to destroy you amen so was a trap for pharaoh and his armies it was Deliverance for for for Israel amen and we know you know after crossed the Red Sea amen Moses raised his staff again and the waters came down and they drowned all the you know drowned all their um oppressors their slave masters were dead I mean that's why Miriam picked up a tambourine cuz she realized her way of Escape I mean it wasn't just for her to get out of Egypt was here to destroy her oppressor am mean they had a Pentecostal meeting on the bank there Hallelujah cuz they looked back and they saw their enemies amen drowned amen maybe Levi said to um B whoever they called you know look Simeon remember that guy that beat you the other day he's dead there amen that spirit that tormented you that family curse that was coming down is being drowned Hallelujah they could Rejoice amen it's the same thing brother Ram said that we can look into the blood of Jesus Christ after we've gone through the blood of Jesus Christ and those Spirits are dead amen those things are dead in the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so it's a Deliverance to one it's a destruction for another we're not here to drown friends we're here to be delivered we're here to walk free amen because God has given us a way of Escape amen you know we often think of Daniel in the Lion's Den just as Daniel going in the den but the the Lion's Den was Daniel's way of escape from his from his work colleagues we know there are people in the court there cuz Daniel was the principal you could say the prime minister or whatever he was called in that day there were other men in the in the cabinet that wanted him dead they hated him Without a Cause Daniel was just doing his job serving God serving the kingdom it was prospering all these things but these others were jealous these jealous Spirits wanted to kill Daniel so they had the king to make that law that no one could pray uh you know to to any other man or God but to the king because they used Daniel's Faith against himself but but the but that whole pressure came on it was actually a way of Escape many times we think just a trial is something we just got to endure and nothing's really going to come out of it apart from ourselves but but it's actually a way of Escape where things that once bothered and hounded you actually are done away with cuz can you imagine he had to every day he would go to work he had to be very careful how he spoke around these guys cuz they were looking for a way to get him they were looking for a way to get him they hated Daniel so much and he knew it right then they write this law Daniel prays as he always does open up his you know bedroom windows and cries out to Jehovah God and praise God and you know and then and then of course he gets arrested he gets thrown in the a lion's den many times we find ourselves we can find ourselves in a lion's den who's been in a kind of a kind of a trial you think this is it it's over I'm done I don't know how I'm going to get out of this thing I'm I'm trapped this is it but you see it wasn't over for Daniel cuz the angel of the Lord came down into the pit am mean came down into the trial and God had Fellowship amen God had fellowship with his prophet and those Lions amen were just his pillows to have a good night's sleep amen but that that's not the end of the story amen that's not the end of the story because when Daniel got lifted out his accusers got thrown in Hallelujah so the liines then amen was a way of Escape that when Daniel went to work the next day those hindering problems in his life were gone and they could never ever come back Hallelujah so don't you say I'm going through a trial it's a way of Escape it's a way of Deliverance it's for your good God wants to get some monkeys off your back and get some trouble out of your life he wants to take that NE negativity and that you know cynical sarcastic attitude he wants to take those things away amen that we can walk and say God is able amen God is the same yesterday today and forever this message Works hallelujah amen but you see many times we we look at life and we just say well it just gets too complex and it puts a Temptation upon us just to hide away when uh when when the midianites and the children of the East they came and basically just just took over Israel this in the days of Gideon here you know Israel Israel saw this and the and and they gave way to the temptation just to quit we're just going to make dens we're going to make strongholds we're just going to go live in some caves maybe the day before they're living on a nice big plane and big farmland and all these things but when this enemy came in it was just too big they just they did not look for the way of Escape there's always a temptation to Shell up or go to God remember here's the way of Escape there's always a Temptation life just gets too complex what's going to happen financially in the future what about my children you know all these things that you just don't seem to find the way out of it but if you seek the Lord he will point you to the exit sign he will point you to the way out amen because remember with every Temptation with every trial there is a way of Escape amen but they decided well we're just going to we're just going to hide away and just try to ride this thing out we're not called to ride things out friends no when trouble comes in we're called to that's a time where we really go to the Lord Lord You're In My Time of trouble am mean Lord You're present here in this in this trial Lord and he'll show you a way of Escape see life gets too difficult people hide their hide from their problems because they don't look for a way of Escape how many people are have have have hidden into an online world to escape life's problems they can't seem to navigate way through they just you know you the problem you know the pressure just gets too much and what does it do it just caus them to escape into a wrong place of Escape Doom scrolling is not going to deliver you streaming binge binge watching some series that ain't going to help you that's hiding in a cave that's hiding in a stronghold but it doesn't deal with the problem they were hidden in caves but the midianites were still there it took God to come down and speak to Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor and Gideon was threshing weed in secret trying to just survive cuz the problem seemed too great and God threw him brought a great Deliverance amen God showed him the way of Escape praise the Lord so we never want to get to a place we just Escape into a fantasy world brother bam tells a story of a of a woman uh you know young lady and she had she had a a heart trouble she had a broken heart because her because her lover or her boyfriend ran off and married someone else and um and and now she had formed this world I was read this but you know she was still in love with this man and this boy was telling her she was in love yet with her but his father had caused it I said that's nonsense he didn't have to marry the other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you that's exactly but see being wound up into that the girl just sit there in like a stoop she said oh I know Johnny loves me I know see that's all she could see she lived in that little world by herself she formed herself in there and sadly many people today they form theirselves their own little world maybe it's just a negative mindset it can be a world that's not a real world we should be positive we have the good news our God is able amen there's nothing too hard for the Lord there's nothing there's no pit too deep there's no struggle too great there's no problem too complex that he can't solve that he can't ride in and bring the victory there's nothing too hard for the Lord you're not a unique case God has delivered if we had testimony time you could take the testimonies of Believers you'd realize there's been many people have walked through your your trial your mind battle your depression your struggle whatever it is God's already brought many through and they would say God I realize God revealed to me there's a way of Escape out of this problem amen and they got out of it you see but she had built this little world that all she could see was that Johnny still loved her but Johnny didn't love her at all didn't have the right kind of love just a just a selfish love what what could he get out of her and then he was done and married someone else but you see now brother Brown would say that he he would took her by the hand said listen to me and the Lord showed her vision you see and she show and she know I know nothing about that something had taken place that transaction between them and when that was said then that snapped her right quick so when the Lord speaks to you when you realize someone's preaching and you're and it's and it's basically a conversation you had driving to church or it's thoughts you've been having or a meditation in the word and it comes over the pulpit maybe it's been in Sunday school now it's being preached on God's trying to get your attention he's trying to snap you out of a little world that you have formed am me to realize look this is you're not meant to live in this kind of a condition you know mean to live addicted to social media and just caught up in your own little world and negative and depressed and cynical or sarcastic because of maybe what's happened in the past no God wants to snap you out of it amen but the main thing is when you realize God's here God's speaking that's when you look for his Mercy that's when you look for his Deliverance that's when you look for his way of Escape I mean more than just oh that's neat he's done it before no don't look at it like that you say God you're speaking to my life you're interested in my condition Lord and you're showing me a way of Escape that's why brother B said you know look to Calvary that's the only way back you see you just get uh ourselves Focus till whether we live or die sinkle dry it's Calvary Christ that's the thing that God wants us to come back to I mean you focus on his Mercy like brother Ram says the blood of Jesus Christ has never given anyone a complex has never done anything negative to any person ever it's only done positive it's only delivered saved redeemed healed amen so just look to that there's still Power in the Blood hallelujah amen we'll come to David a bit more you know even negative thinking is a false world how often can people get into a negative train of thought brother would say in what is the Holy Ghost I don't have the quote here but you know he said him and his wife open their Bibles they had a time of rededication to the Lord and and and he said Lord we want to consecrate ourselves in new to God for a complete service that we would surrender our own wills and everything and every negative thought and to serve the Lord Jesus so if he had to come to a place Lord I Surrender every negative thought I think we need to do that from time to time I mean we don't want to form ourselves in a world where everything's wrong everything is actually good God's plan is is is fulfilling itself God's right on time he's never out of control doesn't matter what H what you see out there God God's in control right we shouldn't be negative about life the devil because the reason we get Negative is the devil sells us a lie this is just how it is cu he doesn't want you to see a way of Escape he wants you to be trapped just just like that girl all she could see was that was that Johnny Johnny love her but of course he didn't have the right kind of a love formed herself into that little thing but you see now David David had a revelation God always gives a way of Escape when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock that's higher than I so he realized Lord when I get when I can't cope in life lead me to the Revelation that's higher than I lead me to the revelation of who you are and who I am in you so he's saying Lord lead me to that way of Escape amen do you do that I trust you do that amen you feel like you can't get out of something God is here to deliver now we know the devil's a trickster we we battle a very he may be a defeated enemy but he's a very shrewd enemy he's not a dummy right and he knows that human he knows the human condition he knows how you're built and he knows how to use it against you now there's a trap that uh people used to trap monkeys it's called a well I just called it a monkey trap and um what it is is is that they hollow out a coconut and and and they put something in it that a monkey likes to eat now that hole in the Coconut is just wide enough for the for the monkey to get his hand in when it's got nothing in it who's ever reached it and got something but as soon as you grab it you can't pull it out who's ever had that experience right so so that's the size they make the hole in the Coconut now the purpose of this is that the is that the Trappers want to want to catch the monkey to sell the monkey to maybe end up in a zoo or somewhere and this is what the devil wants to do many many times he doesn't want to name us but he wants to put us in a cage he wants to put us in a cage for his own Amusement that's why you look at the zoo what's the zoo really sure does n you know nature stuff and whatever and you know endangered species but really ultimately it's Amusement let's go see the sunbe let's go see the Lions and what oh that's neat you know but the devil wants to take a zoo make us into a human Zoo where we're just his Amusement oh look what I got them trapped in look what I've got this false little they think they're living it up like a you a poor lion that's in the zoo here he ain't he ain't in the Krueger no more he ain't he ain't running the savanas of Africa Wild and Free anymore he's in a fake he's in a fake little world just for people to come look at him and this is what the devil does he puts us into a fake little world where we think it's so important oh I can't miss the next series and I can't miss this and I got to watch you know you know the world will continue on if you don't go on on Instagram Tik Tok is going to well it's going to get banned in the states I think praise God ban Crazy Town you don't need it you don't need that it's a monkey trap why because all those things the reason they're addictive is because they've tapped into and they've actually called it brain hacking they know how to manipulate this to keep you engaged hey because if it wasn't addictive who would be on it no one that's who maybe a bunch of bots and you know all those things but you see it's it's engineered just like this is engineered to catch the monkey why because the Trapper knows the condition of the he knows the he he knows how a monkey Works wants a certain little thing he's got to put his hand now this monkey can be free anytime it just has to let go the way of Escape for the monkey is to let go but you see the problem is the monkey likes to hold on to what it's got It's wanted this thing it's had it before Oh this is Yum you see and and this is what the devil does with Human Condition people actually like they know there's a way of Escape they know that God can deliver but all the they need to do but they like holding on to what they've got in their hand it's a trap it's a trap we got to realize that and but people are afraid to say hey I'm actually trapped by the spirit I'm actually troubled in My Mind by this thing I can't you know be because there's always the devil puts shame in his traps he puts a shame in there that you feel like I can't I can't confess this thing I can't expose them and but the thing is we've got to be willing remember you're actually exposing the devil to get rid of him out of your life it's worth it every time there's no point keeping your hand trapped in a like a monkey trap why don't you just walk free says monkey just all he need to do is let go but he wanted what was in the Trap he he wanted it now brother Ram says now uh all that just depends on what you want to see you're a free moral agent you act on uh whatever you desire to act upon right God has put before you like the Garden of Eden the tree of life or the tree of death you make your choice see whatever your soul is Charmed for that's what you'll eat so what is the desire in your life what do you you know because we know we live in a busy age right we live in the hustle and bustle of life it's busy man 24/7 life is busy but the things you really enjoy you will make time for you'll make time for it if you really enjoy it you'll really you know make the time you will lose sleep you'll do whatever you need to do I've got to do this thing now how much more now now are we Charmed by the world or we Charmed by the word of God what's Charming us what's really captivated us what are we what are we a prisoner to amen are we a prisoner to God's word are we a prisoner to to the devil cuz everything the devil just gives cheap counterfeits there's no value in what he has it's just a copy of what God does you know know I've shared this before but you know as you all know I was a you I was a lost University student made home brew and you know did all those things but God found me in that condition then I remember after the Lord met me changed my life and I was at a youth camp and you know the spirit of God was poured out and I felt drunk I was drunk in the spirit like the Apostle Paul says about and I felt drunk like I was back in the world but there's nothing perverse about it and I realize true everything the devil has made is a cheap copy to what God has to give you I mean so why why keep your hand in a trap and say oh this is great when you could actually enjoy the original what what the devil's copied off and amen and walk free and really have a good timeall praise the Lord so I pray that whatever is charming our souls will not be will not be a Temptation Of The Devil but you got to remember there's a way of Escape there's always a way of Escape amen now Samson's monkey trap was Delilah God knew I mean sorry the devil knew how to trap him and it wasn't by cords it was n by Philistine worries it was by the love of fake love of a woman and so remember any time he could have he could have taken his hand out of the Trap right he could have if he wanted to but because he enjoyed his hand on what he had he was just willing to let it keep going and he and you know he's just so engrossed in it but you see he had to get to a condition where he became physically blind he was a prisoner there to the Philistines for him to wake up and realize there's a way of Escape amen cuz there's a way of Escape for everyone in every condition never think that there's no way out there's always a way out amen so so Samson Samson realized amen at the at the end of his life he says once more Lord I want to step out of I want to take your way of Escape I'm willing to die with this monkey trap that I can be free amen and we know he killed more in his death than he did in his life he got free amen how do you know the cause what does a CA what does a trap cause you to do well it takes your joy away in the Lord you don't pray like you used to you don't read like you used to you don't you're not happy like you used to be amen I remember when I first met the Lord you know I was changed the condition of the world and the Troubles of the world were still the same but I was happy I was rejoicing it was all good you see so God God will change you maybe he'll leave the conditions they your whole outlook will be different but what you've received eternal life amen God's transformed your soul it's a great thing amen praise the Lord amen now you say you know because the devil wants us to think there's no way out now I don't know if any of us have ever had ever had uh what do you call it symptoms like Jonah the Book of Jonah says he ran from the presence of the Lord he willingly chose I'm going to escape what God wants me to do and he found himself in a in a whales belly none of us have been in that kind of a condition but Jonah Jonah knew that if he looked towards Solomon's Temple that was dedicated and when Solomon prayed he said God if anyone looks towards your Holy Temple you'll hear them from heaven now I don't know how Jonah was by faith he looked and he and he looked by faith towards the temple he is surrounded by whales belly no doubt the devil was was condemnation was just gripping him you know before that happened where where the devil's telling him this is you there's no way out you can't get out of this fish you're stuck has the devil told you that right but you see don't let condemnation hold you see the devil condemns in a way that there's no way out God convicts CU he wants to show you the way of Escape amen he wants you to be free he doesn't want you to be trapped in whatever you're trapped in amen so so Daniel I mean sorry Jonah Jonah the reason he had the faith that he had wrapped up in seaweed and vomiting everything around him I mean is because it was a revelation to him Lord if I look to your temple amen you'll hear me from heaven and then what he did is so so in that moment when he looked and prayed and repented and gave his life to the Lord like that amen God made him a way of Escape amen he made a way of Escape for Jonah I mean he did it how he did it well nobody knows but it's God's own secret but no matter whether it was impossible God can alter circumstances he can make the impossible become a probable and not only probable he can make it a reality when God when men take God at his word and accept the provided way that God has for him he me you got to realize that if you're trapped in anything it's lying vanities it's lying vanities it'll come it'll go it's not even you know and if You observe like like the monkey let's go back to this CU I like the picture but he all he does is study I can't get it out I want this thing all he's looking at is is is the lying vanities of you know the Trap cuz in reality he could just let it go and he could be free but by doing that he's forsaking his own mercies he's forsaking his way of Escape amen but aren't you glad that God's given us a big Open Door amen he's given us a way of Escape praise the Lord now there comes Temptation from time to time because of circumstances that we want to quit who's ever been there let's be honest yeah you come to a point life just gets too much it gets you know it's like you're trying to walk through some big fog and you don't know the way out or anything you just want to quit now David got to points of life where he you know says here when he came back to Zig the place is burnt their families are gone I mean Saul's just um you know he's dying in battle and there's a time when he's about to you know David's very close to being being placed on the throne like he was ordained to be placed on the throne but then when they came back to Zig and their families were gone the place was burnt down it says and David was greatly distressed this is where this is where our hearts can get very overwhelmed and where where he could look at this and maybe he got to you so distressed because remember there always comes a moment there's always a before and an after there's the initial shock what's happened now you got to realize and and I'm just going to quote Shannon Lee here with teenagers don't overact cuz they always do crazy things and the reason you can say that is because there's always a way of Escape right out of out of whatever people do there's a way of Escape amen so David he would have had the before of the shock and you know his men you know his men that forsook all and followed him and believed he was going to become king they were they were speaking of stoning him so this is the lowest moment really of his life but then so so he had a Temptation come in but then he thought no God you're going to make a way of Escape out of this he didn't know the answer at that very moment but then but then he begin to encourage himself in the Lord his God because when you begin to encourage yourself in the Lord am mean God then opens a way of Escape he gives the way out of the situation Hallelujah because you got to realize that you know many times we you know we read the Psalms and we draw strength out of those Revelations but they were given to David for a reason God God poured Revelation into him I mean of those psalms because God knew David would need those in times of his life where he was more than just looking back and reflecting and writing those things but he would draw strength from that Revelation in times of great need and this was definitely one of them amen where where where here's um here's David and he begin to encourage himself in the Lord has gone now let's just read some of these things I don't have it up here but you know maybe he would have begin to play the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he's lost everything right at this moment the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake ye though I walk through the valley the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointeth my head with oil my cup runthe goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever he's playing this in the in the ruins of zigg he's encouraging ing himself in the Lord cuz he's saying Lord where is the way of Escape but Lord you've been my shepherd am mean you've Lead Me beside Still Waters you've lead me through the valley of the shadow of death Lord You've lead me through many things Lord now what is the way of Escape out of this Hallelujah that was a revelation to David he began to draw strength from Revelation what do we draw strength from today I trust it's the revelation of the word amen David David would write in Psalms 27 now I'm WR I'm I'm quoting these because they're very particular to us as well the Lord is my light in my salvation Psalm 27 the Rapture message the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell th H should encamp against me my my heart shall not fear th War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock hallelujah so you know and no doubt when he's there you know going into ziggle the the Devil comes with condemnation you shouldn't have been in philistia you led your men here the reason all your families are gone is because of your leadership trying to trap him into these things but when he begin to draw strength from the Revelation in his soul amen he he be he he encouraged himself in the Lord and then God begin to God be to show him the way out he began to inquire of God and God showed him what to do now God hasn't just didn't just give David Revelation he's given you Revelation I mean he's quickened his word into your soul that in times of need you can draw strength out of that for God to bring you into a spiritual condition where you're not looking with your five senses of what you see what the Temptation is what you're feeling in your body we know temptation's a real thing right you we you genuinely feel it that's right if you don't are you human right but you genuinely feel it but but in that Temptation there's a way of Escape so what do you do you draw strength from the Revelation God's placed in your soul amen where you can look at what do you think about Colossians 2 I just got a few right I'm just going to read some scripture to you you draw strength from these things he says and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh had he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses I mean blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it he says in Isaiah 40 uh uh 54 behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the wasted to destroy no weapon that is formed against the shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgement Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayth the Lord amen who's ever had weapons formed against you Spirits have come against you troubles remember we're going to be tested by every spirit in this age we're going to be tested by every single one jealousy hatred malice Strife lust whatever it is pride arrogancy melancholic whatever Spirit it is will come against lukewarmness but God will bring us through them all amen so those weapons were formed against you because you got to realize you know in Hell your Public Enemy Number One as the Bride of Jesus Christ carrying the revelation of the word amen the devil hates you we hate him too you're allowed to hate someone that's the devil not your brother or sister not person on the street but the devil you're allowed to hate right you see so so the devil tries to devise how can I take these people down what weapon can I form against them but you see before we ever came upon the planet before the devil ever devised that weapon against you God God gave a revelation to Isaiah no weapon formed against the shall prosper amen it'll be formed but it's not going to win amen it's not going to take you out you're going to take it out by the revelation of the word hallelujah amen what is it God's going to give a way of Escape amen praise the Lord let's read another one having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by the by by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he hath made us accept in the Beloved the devil wants to pin you down saying you're not accepted God doesn't love you you're trapped in this trap look what you've done no the word says I'm accepted in the Beloved I'm predestinate unto the adoption or the placing of a child amen praise the Lord amen yo the enemy wants us to think that there's there's no way out we're not going to make it I say if you've received the Holy Ghost you've already made it you're sealed to the day of your Redemption you've already made it amen Jesus would say let not your heart be troubled I'm just sharing you scriptures that encourage me okay these things encourage me Amen Let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house and many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also that receiving is the message being received by you that's God coming in word form to receive you unto himself that where he is in glory you will be taken also amen the Apostle Paul said we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens amen a theophany Eternal Body already waiting for us Amen brother BR says when you recognize that this message am me this word is Eagle food amen and and you've left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany hallelujah amen what so we got to realize this is not our end destination we're going into Glory right so that means there's a way of Escape out of every trial out of every Temptation praise the Lord and then David now he said to Aba the priest after he had read these scriptures because it was a revelation to him and he began to rejoice and he wasn't looking at zigg burnt anymore in the situation of his life he you know he he asked for ABA the priest you know to bring the epod inquired of the Lord what shall I do shall I pursue this Troop I overtake them and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all so what happens is when you're looking for a way of Escape you should be praying Lord help me to put show me how to put my faith into action right this is what David's asking here Lord show me what should I do in this state now what is the way of Escape that I can recover everything the devil's taken amen this is why I always we're not here to be passive we ain't passive Believers no we we let God put the faith that's in our lives into action show us what I should do Lord how can I how can I get through this way of Escape that Deliverance comes to my house Deliverance comes to my family Deliverance comes here just like going through the Red Sea amen and God will show you what to do praise the Lord now we know the Rapture itself is a way of Escape glory and God in his infinite grace has given you a ticket out of here amen he's given you the ultimate Way of escape the consolation of the ages that every believer down Through the Ages was looking for amen is upon us right now praise the Lord and so so just like when Jesus said because many people they look at the condition of the world I said the world's falling apart that's only half the picture when you see these things don't get burdened by them don't be trapped in them and you know form political viewpoints and let this world polarize you against another group no lift up your heads for you know that when you see these things you know Redemption is drawing nigh amen that the Lord is here to take us away Hallelujah I'm so glad for that aren't you amen praise the Lord but you see the devil will try and trap us to think that we can't get out brother BR was in a meeting he called out a soldier boy in the back of the meeting brother Ed Bisal shares this testimony and and and and and the soldier boy he was trying to commit suicide because he was secretly so he's married he had children but he was he was committing homosexual acts in secret on the army base and and of course the devil said well you're trapped in this thing there's no way out and so the devil but the devil just lying to him you know the Lord spoke out what's the matter soldier boy you're not going to commit suicide that's a devil lying to you that's the devil lying to you that there's no way out and if you think there's no way out I I know I've repeated this but I I I feel I need to if you feel there's no way out that's a lie you're being bound by a lie that's not even real I mean there is a way out there is a way out but what you got to do you got to be willing to expose to stop being a human shield for that trap and let the let God destroy it out of your life because it says in Proverbs he that coverthe and forsaketh them Shall Have Mercy amen so they shall have their way of Escape am mean so never even think well what do people think of me well I think honestly if you confess it out of a genuine heart they'll respect you for that that's a real man he's been pushed down but he wants to get back up amen he wants to keep walking with God he's not letting this thing Define him anymore but he wants to walk with God to me that's a real Christian that's a real believer that's an overcomer amen be willing to confess and forsake like the monkey man I'm in a trap how's he how's he forsake it just let It Go Don't Let It control his mind anymore amen there is a way of Escape praise the Lord I'm just I'm just going to bring this to a close real soon he says now brother says this in the Red Sea he showed that he would make a way for those who are trying to do do right and follow his Commandments no matter what cuts it off God proved at the Red Sea and gave a sign that he would open up the sea in every Temptation he'll make a way of Escape say well mother don't believe it Daddy don't believe it the church don't believe it I don't care who don't believe it if you believe it God Will Make A Way of Escape he gave a sign that he would they were on their way straight to the promised land where God promised them and the Red Sea shut them off and they got in trouble they didn't know what to do God showed that he would make a way of Escape in every Temptation every trial if you can't quit smoking take God one time if you can't quit lying can't quit stealing can't quit having temper take god with you one time if you don't feel like going to church and you can't get anywhere take god with you once take his promise he proved at the Red Sea that he will make a way of Escape God gave many signs that's why I think if you're if the devil's lied to you so much you want to end it all take God first take life and and yeah yeah I was going to say try life now you don't try him you just take God at his word but you see but but many people say well I've tried I've tried I've tried to let go but I just can't you know what that is is just human ability you got to go beyond human ability right because many because we all want to serve God here right that's why we're here this morning right and the devil trap us into things use our own human nature against us and we think man there's no way out of this thing I've tried I've tried to forsake it I've tried to put it on you I've tried to get rid of but it just comes back and like it haunts me there's a way of escap Escape there have a way there's a way of Escape it's called a genuine breakthrough with God right Amen brother now I'm just going to close with this I'm just going to close with a sorry for all the reading today but I want you to see these things now brother R went into an emergency place in an insanity institution and he's and he's there and he's seeing people in straight jackets cursing all these things filled with demon power and he looked to one girl and said you know um it's kind of hard to tell where to start praying now he's actually talking to a patient and she said if you don't mind I wish you'd start with with me okay and and I said with you yes sir but you're not a patient she said yes I am he said well what's wrong with you she said I'm suppose I'm insane she and brother BR said I don't uh I'm sure you sure don't look it uh she said would you listen to my story I said certainly she said well when I was a younger girl brother Braham I was raised in a real Christian home and I started going with a boy that smoked and said first thing you know I was smoking so what's happened she's been trapped into something she's been trapped the devil's trapped because naturally she wants a she wants a boyfriend one day to get married all these things the devil's used that it's a Temptation entered into her life with the wrong guy and now she's trapped by this thing and then one night he he he spiked a coat with whiskey that started me drinking I started from that to prostitution and she said I've lived in the very gutters of the blackest hell but she wants to get out of it she said I I've served four years in the Catholic institution good Shepherd's home said in there I turned a new page I said when I get out of here I'm going to go straight many times that's where as far as people go they think that's it but that's just the beginning right I said I meant it but as soon as I got with the crowd again it was all over then I said I did two years in a woman's State Penitentiary here in this state I said there I thought truly I was reformed I come home and join another church I told the pastor we went down to the Altar and talked it over but she said I just can't keep from it she said it started one night I said lady don't you want to be a real lady and have a hubby and babies and like a real woman would so he's putting out a picture don't you really want this and she's like yes but she's been trapped in the cycle and she's turned Pages joined churches in prison she thought well I'm truly reformed why cuz the Temptation wasn't there in prison removing temptation is not sure shown the very appearance of evil but you know to overcome something is when it's not in here anymore right like I said about drinking I could live in Brewery I'd be the most soberest guy life there's nothing in here that wants it anymore it's gone God took it from me I don't have to keep myself from those things it's gone praise the Lord amen so she said with all my heart she said but look at me now so basically she's saying I'm trapped I can't get out of this the devil said I I can't I've tried and I've tried I said but you haven't tried my Lord yet she said yes I have two brother bam I've signed pledges and vows and made promises to God I said that's not what I'm talking about see but that's you're someone trying to find the way of Escape humanly trying to no that's just a human effort trying to escape but I'm talking about a different way of Escape yes sir I'm talking about a total Deliverance way of escape and I said that that's not what I'm talking about I said as as oldfashioned as it may seem to be it's a devil she said I've always believe that he said he drives you to do things that you don't want to do she said I believe that she said would there be any hope for me I said certainly and we knelt down to pray and after a while she raised up beautiful woman great soft looking eyes she looked up and tears running down her cheeks she said now brother Bram I believe I'm going to go out and make a new life how many times do people just get there it's good to get emotional it's good to because remember this is her heart she wanted out of this trap you know she wasn't being halfed about this this was this thing she wanted the way of Escape she was looking for it and many times we just get to an emotion state which is good and we think we're free but brother Bram said sister dear you simply turning a page it wouldn't do any good I said you've done that so many times I said just stay there until God speaks back to you we got down there together and prayed and I left her praying went on pray with with with the other people and after a while she rosed up from there looked around the room those big eyes look at me she said something happened to me I said now you've got it now you've got it you don't have to turn new pages now it's happened you've got it and from that time she was a change person she's married she had a lovely home two children now she can point her finger to a time that something happened to her that was Immortal am mean things change life change but there's something that can change to a person that won't change you cannot be the same after this happens that's when man meets God he's changed Something's Happened to him he's never the same after he once meets God face to face where he has to come to the fact to either receive him or walk away from him he'll go away well a worse person or go away a new person but when you meet God something happens is immortality see that is the way of Escape more than an emotional thing I remember when I was trapped in the world parties drinking gaming all those kind of things but when I heard the message and brother R preaching on the Seal of God you must receive the Holy Ghost I'm like Lord I want to receive the Holy Ghost I didn't know what to do I didn't know what would happen but I knew I could meet him I knew here's my way of escape and and then so but I came to a place in my life where God brought me to a full surrender Hallelujah I was studying organic chemistry in the library there in Christ Church University and a conviction Came Upon me if you died right now where would you go and I went home because before that I meant business but I was just humanly meaning business but then God comes on the scene that's why if you draw n to him there's a way of Escape trust me there's a way of Escape I've experienced it that door is a wonderful thing to walk through Hallelujah and he changed my life he filled my heart with his love I've never been the same person why because it wasn't me trying to turn a new I tried to turn pages I tried to you know turn leaves like this woman did but then he came and changed me Hallelujah he is the way of escape and not just there but in every Temptation Of Life friends if you just look to him doesn't matter what you think the devil's trapped you in the our God your God will set you free give your way of Escape that you can walk through the devil's lying to if you think you can never overcome these problems whatever's going I don't know what's going on in your life many of you but I say this God is able to give you a way of Escape if you just look for it he will he will lead you through it Hallelujah I don't think I can stand here much longer let's have the musicians please this morning amen there is a way of Escape Hallelujah open door we can walk through we can be like this woman here something happened to me it was different to whatever had happened to her in the past just being emotional but she went beyond that and God changed her life amen so remember with the Temptation there's also he'll make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it amen let's look for that amen praise the Lord so I encourage you whatever's going on in here many times it's internal things we've been trapped internally we all look fine on the outside but what about the inside what about really what's going on in our secret life if there's a trap if there's something you're caught up into there's a way of Escape out of it just confess it and forsake it you'll have mercy you'll get out
