in this building Lord father you see the needs and the situations and the circumstances but Lord we know there is not one too great for you we know that you're still a Healer of the sick Lord you're

flow through this building tonight and father I pray that you would drive out every Spirit of unbelief dear God if there would be one demon that would try to torment the people or would try to hinder this meeting in any way father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you would drive it out of this building Lord and may the Sons and Daughters of God rise to their positions tonight Lord and see

brother Al send their greetings to you so it's just it's just an honor to be here and to be fellowshipping with the Believers amen of like Precious faith I trust you've come tonight to receive from the Lord amen I believe the Lord has something special for us tonight amen here in the book of Philippians chapter number two and verse number 12 I would like to read if it would be okay down through verse number 18 the Bible here says wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in as in my presence only but now much more in my absence Paul says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do his good pleasure now do all things without murmurings and disputings that you be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke now notice here what what Paul is saying he's asking them to be blameless and to be harmless to be the sons of God without rebuke and notice the condition that they're going to be this in in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the Word of Life yeah that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain and yay and if I be offered up on the sacrifice and service of your faith I joy and rejoice with you all for the same calls also do you Joy and rejoice with me we just ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats for just a few moments I I I understand it's a midweek service but I am so thankful that the Lord meets with us on midweek Services amen I tell you sometimes it's a midweek service that gets us through the week amen amen I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to here for just a few moments upon a thought and if I would title it I would like to speak to you on holding forth the word of life amen amen holding forth the word of life and I'll tell you tonight I am thankful and I am thankful to God that we have a Bible aren't you I'm thankful that we've got a Bible but I'm not just thankful that we've got a Bible but I'm thankful that we've got a Divine commentary on the Bible that we have I'm thankful to know tonight that the Bible amen is not just a history book the Bible is not just a a newspaper article it's not it's not something that's just a myth but the Bible amen is the word of God and brother tells us that for many years they've had this Bible and they've tried to understand this Bible he said but it is a Divine promise that in the last days there will come a perfect understanding of the Bible that we have so aren't you thankful to be a people tonight who is not looking at the Bible amen Through The Eyes of denomination you're not looking through the Bible Through The Eyes of some man's understanding but you're looking at the Bible Through The Eyes of the pillar of fire said see he said I might pass this on to you young people do you know that Abraham Lincoln never owned a book in his life until he was 21 years old he said the only book that he owned was the Bible and Fox's book of the Martyr see what you read molds the character that you are so when brother is telling us this he's telling us this for a purpose that what you're reading is what you are becoming he said see no wonder that we've got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines and vulgar and nonsense is placed up on our new stands he said see he only owned the Bible and the the foxes books the martyrs and look what it made him so actually what he's declaring here amen is the book that Abraham lincol is what made him the man that he was and I I'll tell you if Abraham Lincoln amen could read the Bible amen and could become one of the greatest presidents to ever go down in history he can become one of the greatest politicians Amen to ever stand and and to declare the things of a country I think if there's a bride on the earth tonight and then I think if we're reading this same then there is more potential in this building Amen to become more than just a politician amen there is potential to become more than just a church member but there is a potential here Amen to become the very Seed of Abraham and the Bible says the Seed of Abraham shall possess the gate amen of every enemy brother ran was praying in a message and getting in the spirit he said Heavenly Father we are in a perishing land we are in a perishing Nation he said we're in a perishing world and we're preaching to perishing people he said but I'm just a man and these other preachers are just men but you are an imperishable God what a what a reality that is to know that we're living Amen in a generation where the nation that we're living in is perishing amen the country we're living in is perishing amen the people around us are perishing religion is perishing but we have got a God here tonight amen and he's not a perishing God but he's an eternal God and he's got eternal power I to think tonight that that imperishable God Is Not A Million Miles Away he's not a million planets away but he's right here in this building tonight to declare himself amen the same yesterday today and forever he said I pray thee tonight Lord that this message I have spoken my nerve is six months of going around and being wound up he said I might have not said it just right Lord brother's preaching a message on getting in the spirit now what a great important thing he was preaching because the greatest thing the church needs is not to get into education it's not to get into the Realms of formality but the greatest thing that the Church of the Living God needs is to move beyond the Realms of just human intellectualism move beyond the Realms of just church ideas and move into the reals where there's a supernatural God and he's got Supernatural power I to think tonight that a prophet said I may have made a mess out of this but there's going to be a church who is going to move into the spirit of almighty God he said the holy spirit is here and said let that Spirit just smooth it out amen and take all the wrinkles out God just like you did to Abraham and said we know he had his frustration so we understand here amen that the Bible is a book that is full amen of people who made mistakes the Bible is full of people amen who was constantly falling short of the glory of God and a prophet picked that up and Christ revealed in his own word and he said see if this was a book of a man he said they would have not allowed their mistakes Amen to be put in a book and to think that this book has been around the world Amen this book has been on conents this book has been in King's offices this book has been all over the world and it's full amen of people who made mistakes amen but it did not stop there it is full of people who did not let their mistakes overcome them but they took the faith of Jesus Christ that was on the inside of their hearts amen and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony brother if you're looking for a perfect Church look no further she's here tonight you say how can you say that because we may be humans and we may have frustrations amen but we've got a perfect atonement tonight and that atonement declares that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and if God be for us then who can be against us now to think tonight just like Abraham we've had frustrations the Bible says that Abraham was a man and he was full of frustrations anybody ever get mad anybody ever get upset anybody ever go through something and you feel like you're the furthest thing from a Christian amen but can I tell you tonight the thing you're going through has not got the power to take your identity away from you see your identity is not coming from the atmosphere you're living in your identity is coming from a seed that was placed on the inside of your heart and it wasn't placed there yesterday it wasn't placed there at an altar it was placed there from before the foundation of the world my to think tonight that Abraham the Bible says that Abraham's tiggered amen you go back and read it the Bible says that Abraham doubted amen but when the New Covenant came amen Abraham's frustration amen could not come in that new my God Abraham's frustrations and Abraham's failures amen could not come into the Divine commentary and a prophet of God said a man who had one time staggered at the promise of God the faith of Jesus Christ overcame the things of Abraham and it's not even recorded the Bible says Abraham grew stronger as he fed upon the promise he said so Lord God my little styring and my little misspelled words and my little mispronounced and so forth let the Holy Spirit just smooth it out and put a real Divine commentary in every heart of this message tonight he said and let him see that there's still a God who is alive and he's well tonight do you see what the the power of the word can do the power of the word can smooth out amen it can erase the things of Our Lives by to think tonight there still remains of people in spite of failures who loves God and there still remains of people tonight in spite of all the things you've been through you still love God and there is still a God who is interested in you there is a savior that was smitten some 2,000 years ago he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity it and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes amen we are healed see this is not something coming in the future this is something that's already been done it's just waiting for the faith amen of a son or daughter of God Amen to rise to a level amen I'll tell you what tonight church it's not time to sit there it's time to move it's not time to be bound it's time to move into the liberty of Jesus Christ we are not a bunch of defeated people we are not a bunch of defeated Christians we have got a perfect lamb who has produced a perfect blood and it's going to produce a Perfect Bride and there ain't enough devils and all of hell that is going to stop this church amen from rising in the power of the Holy Ghost I tell you tonight in Hebrews chapter 8 the Bible says for finding fault with him he saith behold the days cometh sayith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant amen with the house of Israel and with the house Judah what is that word Judah the word Judah means praise huh I ain't even got time to preach there amen the word Judah means praise do you realize the Bible tells us that there was a man by the name of Daniel Amen who was thrown in the Lion's Den that man Daniel was put in that L's den and the Bible says in that L's Den he praised God my God in the lies then he was still praising God you say how could a man who was sweat surround amen by hungry lines praise God because the lines then did not change the line of the tribe that he came out of see before he went in there he come from the line of Praise while he was in there he was still in the line of Praise And when he come out of there he was still a part of the tribe of Judah which was the tribe of Praise my God I feel like preaching and here tonight is a group of people who has been through trouble and trouble couldn't stop you amen you've been through the fire and the fire couldn't destroy you youve been through the flood but the flood couldn't round you because there was a praise on the inside of your heart and that praise had to come forth brother cancer can't kill that praise depression can't kill that praise family trouble can't kill that praise that's an eternal praise amen that came from an eternal God and it's got to declare itself M to think tonight that there ain't enough things we've been through that's going to destroy amen the that's on the inside of our hearts this is not according to the Covenant that I made with her fathers in the day when I took them by the hand Amen to lead them out of the land of Egypt this is not that Covenant he said because they continue not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayith the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and will write them into their hearts see this is moving beyond your head it's moving beyond the Realms of your intellectual capabilities it's moving into the depths of your hearts where Peter would say Amen that we have come or rather Paul would say we have come to Mount Zion now think of this tonight church that we have come Amen to a place where God is still God and nothing can change our God he said and notice I will put it in the Hearts I will write it in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people isn't that beautiful to know that it's not just a God who is an Overlord but he's actually con he's actually connected himself to you amen not through a feeling amen not through a sensation but he has connected himself to you by divine revelation see and they shall teach not every man is neighbor and every man is brother saying know the Lord for All Shall know me from the least to the greatest isn't this beautiful amen that in this day he is not starting a new creation amen based upon the natural seed line but he is starting a new creation based upon the spiritual creation amen it was not to start with a man It Started With Jesus Christ and to think tonight that what he's speaking of Amen is there's going to come a people who is not going to die immature anden they're not going to sit in the nest and rot away but there's going to be a quickening power that's going to come for from the presence of God and it's not going to bring them amen back to being a bunch of babies but it's going to bring them into being mature Sons and Daughters of God oh we don't know what we shall be but we know when we shall see him amen we shall have a body amen lock into his own glorious body brother I'll tell you what it's time to do it's time to kick every devil out of your way and realize that there is a promised seed only in inside of your soul and nothing hey nothing is going to stop that seed amen from coming into full maturity he said for I will be merciful to the unrighteous and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more isn't that beautiful he's telling them I'm going to start a new covenant with you it's not going to be after the order of the old it's going to be after the order not of the natural priesthood it's going to be after the order of MDC see it's going to come after the order of MDC brother if you can keep that air conditioner off of me I'd appreciate it thank you it'll take my voice out the door with it you love the Lord tonight for I will be merciful to their unrighteous notices and their sins how many can say thank God that your sins are no longer remembered see a prophet did not come and announce you as just a forgiving bride he did not announce you just as somebody but he traced you all the way back to the beginning and said Justified it's not as forgiven it's as though you never even done it my God it's as though you've never even done it in the first place and in that he saith a New Covenant he has made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away see so tonight amen you are not a part of something that's got the ability Decay you are not a part of something tonight that's got the ability to pass away you are a part of the word and the word says Heaven and Earth shall pass away amen but my word shall never pass away and to think tonight church that there's an eternal seed on the inside of your soul when this Earth has passed away you'll still be standing when this world is atomic Potter you'll still be standing amen because we have not come Amen to mount defeat but we have come to mount Victory we have not come under a partial gospel we have been called Amen to stand under a Full Gospel friends we've not just been called to be associated with the Full Gospel we have been called Amen to preach the full word with full power amen with full assurance that the god that wrote the Bible is still here among us tonight and he's just as able tonight amen to fulfill the promise that he already made you my God have mercy Hallelujah we we have come to the Full Gospel can you say Amen we we are determined Amen to preach the Full Gospel and to stay with it for it is the light of the day now watch the full gospel is the Holy Ghost Gospel can you agree and that Full Gospel is the Holy Ghost Gospel and a prophet would say that Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood what is the gospel well the gospel means the good news can you say Amen see what the gospel is is the gospel is the living reality of Jesus Christ see it's not just a letter amen it's not just a historical standpoint but the gospel is the living reality my to think that a prophet would pick up a sermon and would call it living dying buried rising and coming I'll tell you what it's beautiful there I I don't have time to get into it but it's a beautiful study when a prophet takes that and says watch it's the gospel unfolding see the gospel is unfolding for the purpose of the one that's coming to what was the living living he loved me amen what was the dying dying he saved me what was the Buried buried he carried my sins far away what was the rising the rising was the justification and what was the coming oh some glorious day he's not coming for a sinful bride he's coming for a sinless bride amen and she's not going to have a spot and she's not going to have have Rinko my to think tonight church that the Full Gospel is not just for your soul but it's also for your body see the gospel did not come just to change your soul amen but the power that changed your soul is going to change your body my God I feel like preaching the power that changed your soul is going to change your body you say what are you talking about you say brother and I got an eternal Soul you're exactly right you've got an eternal Soul that's been changed by the power of an eternal God but right here tonight we're living in a crooked and a perverse nation and we're battling this flesh but we got a promise that there is a power in this gospel that cannot just change our soul amen but it'll change our bodies in the moment in the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah see said what is Divine Healing he said Divine Healing is for the body what is forgiveness is for forgiveness of sin and for the cleansing of the Soul now in First Corinthians 15:3 Paul says for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died amen for our sins now watch what Paul puts in here it's beautiful according to the scriptures see Christ did not die according to anything else but the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures let's let's say that together according to the scriptures See's going to pick it up and say now he could do something apart from his word but he sticks with his word my and to think tonight church that someone told brother Brandon brother brandham you preached too much on the resurrection he said every message you preach has something to do with the resurrection he said the resurrection is a powerful promise aren't you thankful tonight for the promise of a resurrection in in a message Mother's Day watch sure it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did if he did not rise again from the dead then all of it was in vain it to me proves that he was God it proves every claim he made the resurrection and it is also the place of the resting of the Soul see where your soul is resting tonight it's not resting upon the works of a man it's not resting upon the ability of a church but your soul is resting upon the promise of a resurrection see it's the it's the starting point it's the crowning of our consolation and when we see that he rose from the dead it places us with the gospel armor woo brother when we see that he rose from the dead amen it places us with the gospel armor armor and it doesn't put us at the backfront it puts us at the Battlefront he said to take the place and to fight for we know he said he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it again and I think it's the great coronation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection Direction and its Divine promises and the consolation that it gives those who are trusted in it for it promises that the great Union of our uniting together again now watch it's promises and the fading away of sin it's promises and notice this the fading away of all deformities and the Fai in the way of all sicknesses and sufferings what we have did in this how to go through this life is promises see and Vanishing of it all it's promises that even death will lose its whole see and will rise in the likeness of Jesus so to my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises in the things of the scripture see brother manah did not leave the scripture he pointed the church back to the scripture because everything that's going to be done is going to be done according to the scripture my Amen to think tonight that the message of the hour has not come amen according to the idea of William brandom this message has come according to the scripture for Jesus said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me see he was not out of the scripture he was in the scripture oh my feel like preaching right here Jesus was not coming away from the scripture he was in the scripture in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh see Jesus was in the Bible and in symbolic form but what brought him to reality was quickening power amen brought it from word form into reality form and if that same spirit amen that raised up Jesus from the dead shall dwell in you then it shall Quicken your mortal body brother sister I tell you what amen you didn't get put in this word by a prophet you was already in this word oh do you see when the body of Jesus Amen was laying in the grave what was laying there it was a body it was a powerless lifeless body but quickening Power amen didn't go in there and put the word in the grave quicken in power amen brought the word body out of the Grave church and here we are we was buried under our sin we was buried under trespasses we was buried under iniquities we was buried under the sins of our family but the quicking power amen walked into the graveyard and said Lazarus come forth and we might have been dead for 4 years or for 40 years but there was a seed on the inside of our soul and that seed amen had to give way to the pulsation of God brother I feel that same quickening power anden roaring through this building right now what is it church it's a reality amen there's going to be a body change I believe that it's a reality amen somebody is not going to Bow but somebody is going to stand amen somebody is going to hold this word until the power amen that lifted Enoch off the Earth drops down on this body amen and lifts this body off the earth oh you can't tell me this message is a lie you've come too late you can't tell me William Brandon was a prophet you've come too late you can't tell me there's not going to be a bride she's already here hallelujah oh Hallelujah you cannot make the scriptures lie come on Church you can't make these scriptures lie amen the light is only going to strike what's in the atmosphere come on Church why we got a picture of a pillar of fire above a prophet's head declaring it was there my to thank that God Amen testifies of his gifts how does he testify according to the scriptures see the Miracles are done according to the scriptures Divine Healing came according to the scripture see the devil is not afraid of a scripture laying in word form that don't scare the devil but what scares the devil is when the spirit of inspiration amen moves upon that scripture and somebody amen can turn the pages of the scripture and look right there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled brother I'll tell you what I can't help but thank the same spirit amen that Roar through the brandom Tabernacle in in February of 65 when a prophet preached this day their scripture fulfill I can't help but think that that same spirit amen is flowing through this building tonight amen declaring that if a prophets has fulfilled the scriptures that was written of him and there's going to be a bride amen there's going to be a bride who is going to fulfill every word that is written of her brother I'm not a crazy man I'm believer I'm not a fanatic I'm a Believer this is not the day that God is riding the Bible this is a day that God is fulfilling a Bible that's already been written in that day ye shall know that I am in the father and the father is in me and I in you see that was prophecy but a prophet picked it up in uniting time and sign and said that day is this day Oh Brother y'all just forgive me that means we've turned the corner that means this is no longer just a book it's a new book that means we don't have to turn and read something Dr doson said we can read what Paul said and the same spirit that was upon Paul is going to fall upon the church oh somebody give him a hand clap of praise it's the scripture hallah it's the scripture becoming more than just a Bible Lesson becoming more than just a bedtime story becoming more than just a morning devotion becoming a reality that if Jesus was in there that I've got to be in there hallelujah oh behold I amen will send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord thank Lord you realize some people just see brother brandom in that but there's three parts there amen come on Church there's three parts there there was a three-fold purpose in Christ the mystery there was a three-fold purpose to the seven seal there's a three-fold purpose in Malachi 4 behold I which is God will send unto you which is you Elijah which was we and random and a prophet put his finger on that scripture and said this day this scripture is fulfilled brother I want to tell you tonight how many could say I need a healing in my body oh my how many could say you need the Holy Ghost amen how many could say you need Joy amen how many could say you need peace amen here I go if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and you shall have it this day this scripture is fulfilled in this church brother Ander I need Joy you shall have joy unspeakable and full of Glory anybody got some Joy anybody got some Joy then I say this day this scripture is fulfilled my God get out of here devil get out of here devil this is not a bunch of heathens this is not a bunch of infidels this is some circumcised Holy Ghost Fields fire baptized je seed born Children of the Living God hallelujah my to think tonight which is not another but this is the same gospel that Paul preached has returned in this generation not just to be preached but to be fulfilled sir see and Paul was even so sure of this gospel he was so sure of this blessed book that he said if an angel come from heaven and preach one thing different than what I've already preached you let that angel be a curse see because brother Bram said I cannot be a Catholic now watch he said I cannot be a Catholic because they believe the word is inspired but they believe that the church is over the word he said I can't go that way he said I can't be a Protestant because they only take as much of the word as they want and what they don't want they leave he said so I can't be you ever notice that he said the Protestants only take what they think is inspired yeah yeah why did that Prophet tell the story of the man that came back to his mama who was dying with cancer said Mom I thought you was dying she said well son I was she said but then some of them Full Gospel hallelujah holy ghost faled people come down here and took the Bible and they read Mark 16 over me and said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover she said brother and they anointed we with whole and she said son I don't know I was eat up with cancer but they laid their hand on me and she said I'm completely whole and her son stopped and he said what book did you read mom she said they read the Bible he said what did they read she said well they read Mark 16 he said okay do you realiz from Mark 16th uh 16th chapter and the 9th verse on is not even inspired now I heard brother say that one day so brother man I went read Mark 16:9 you know what verse 9 says and he appeared and he appeared unto them see so even back then they was already rejecting his appearing come on even back then they was already rejecting his appearing and here we are some 2,000 years later and a prophet is standing on a platform and he's calling things identically and accurately and they're they're they're rejecting that he has appeared oh but may I say tonight we are not a Matthew 21 Church who is sitting here saying who is this but we are screaming this is Jesus Christ this is the king of kings this is the appearing of the son of man this is the promised word for this day being fulfilled right before our very eyes my we are either going to accept it or we're going to reject it but is there anybody here that's going to accept it is there anybody here that's going to accept it I'm not talking about part of it I'm talking about line upon line and precept upon precept and here a little and there a little until we don't come Amen to a defeated church but we come to the stature of a perfect man at the headship of Jesus Christ the Capstone can sit down on a perfect body my ain't God good I said ain't God good brother you say brother Andrew what's a god a hold of you I'll tell you what God a hold of me the same thing that God a hold of Paul got a hold of me what about you what about you the same thing that changed Peter is what changed me the same God Amen that saved Rahab it's the same God that saved me and I'm not ashamed to stand and say I'm a word believer I believe in the signs I believe in the Wonders I believe in the Miracles I believe it all oh brother they're going to call you Pentecostal well go ahead they already do Hallelujah said brother you better be careful they're going to call you a Holy Roller well you know what I come to conclusion if they're going to call me a Holy Roller I'm going to give them something to work with they ain't going to call me a holy sitter they ain't going to call me a holy looker if I'm going to be called a Holy Roller then I'm going to be full of the Holy Ghost and Fire and I'm going to go rolling right in the portals of Glory where there'll be no devil where there'll be no sin where there'll be no sickness where there'll be no tormenting spirits but there'll be peace and there'll be a king of peace and that King will be the same King amen that met Abraham returning from the stter is going to meet this bride who is it church it's King theophany Hall oh hallelujah hallelujah there's love for this Bible come back in the heart of a people if there's not a love in there it'll be just another book if there's Not A Love For Truth it'll be just another church service if there's not a love for worship it'll just be going through the motions but if there's ever a love come in there my to think that we're preaching tonight from the only book that is positive truth yeah Hallelujah oh it's the only book that is positively the truth that's right that's right I feel good the devil don't like it but I don't care the devil don't want you to feel this good in the house of God and you know what I say I say the devil's a liar I say the devil is a liar because you know what the devil's tried to do he's tried to fill the church with a bunch of forms and a bunch of Fashions and a bunch of Creeds and a bunch of cow worship and he's tried to shut everybody up but I heard a scripture say in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your old men shall see visions and your young men shall dream dreams brother I'll tell you what we're feeling tonight we're feeling the same thing that poured out in the upper room it's poured out across this building and the windows of Heaven are open and the blessings are falling tonight brother if I was you I wouldn't say God fill my cup I'd say Lord fill every fiber of my being tonight ye are all the children of light listen what Paul said amen ye are all the children of light and the children of day and we are not of the night notice nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep amen amen amen amen amen Paul preach to get sleeping in church yes sir let us not sleep notice look what this word sleep means it means to yield to sloth and sin it means to be indifference and to be indifferent about one's salvation come on see that's the Warfare out there is right here tonight the devil's doing everything he can while I'm preaching to get you to believe that you're not even saved come on Church let's just face the devil will do everything he can amen while the word's going forth to convince you that you've crossed the line between mercy and judgment am I preaching now he'll do everything he can to convince you that God said healing is true but it's not for you but here's my thing if there's a group of people who can cross the line amen between mercy and judgment and cross into judgment never to return to Mercy again then I believe I believe that there's a people who can cross the line into the mercy of God never [Applause] Hallelujah never to return to sin again never to return to the devil again my God have mercy what is it church it's your Shalom hour it's your blessing hour it's not been announced by me it's been announced by word Prophet Shalom little bride what was he announcing it's going to be a dark day can I can I read this again it's going to be a day that's going to be a crooked and a perverse day it's going to be a perverse perverse Nation among whom he shall shine as lights in the world if there's going to be shining lights then there's got to be Darkness somewhere right and a prophet announced what is it oh my how much time have I got here we we know we would ask Lord that you'd forgive us of any mistake any sin of trespass or Omission transgression that any of evil fault is pierced the Soul by the fiery darts of the devil that you would drive away this evil enemy of thine and of thy people and we would ask that you would send the Holy Spirit to take a hold of the word at this time as we yield ourselves as instruments do you see what you are you are an instrument in the hand of God look at this here there there's an instrument right there there's an instrument right there there's an instrument right there do you realize that the music is already in the instrument the music is already in the instrument see brother if I which I can't but if I picked up this guitar and begin to play you know what I'm not putting music in there the music is already in there but the hand that's holding it my God is revealing what is already in there oh Church don't you see why Prophet would say there was a seed on the inside of your soul from before the foundation of the don't you see what he was showing he was showing that this message was not putting the music in you this message was only revealing what was already laying there from a former civilization and that civilization was God now I'll tell you what's the truth tonight I don't know about you but I say Lord pick me up I say Lord pick me up pick me up tonight God take me in your hands and begin to tune Me Up Lord amen amen oh because it's the hour of visitation when we feel this feeling and we're getting readjusted to the cause of Christ now I'm coming to a close here but I want to ask you something just a second you know what a chiropractor is yeah let me see your hands you know what a chiropractor is so you know what you do you go to a chiropractor to get adjusted yeah you know why because something has slipped out of place right something has come out of line and you got to go get readjusted amen so you can walk walk right so you can feel right I remember the first time I went to a chiropractor man that was an experience I tell you what I went in there and he said lay down I thought oh Lord so I laid down and he took this arm and crack and that arm and crack and before long everything was cracking oh my Lord I got to pay for this too I mean everything then he said now be real calm you know they grab your head and say be real calm and how can you be calm and still be real calm and relax and think good so I'm laying there and the guy says you know what sir normally it takes me a long time on people now no offense here he said because most of the people I see is older people he said now their bones are a lot stiffer and their muscles are a lot tighter and it takes some time to loosen up it takes some he said now somebody young can just come in and lay down and crack and they're gone but see that body's been through something yeah now now can you fellowship with me here for a second remember when you first got saved and you come to church and it was so easy to raise your hand man you come to the door raising your hand remember when somebody asked you how you was doing and all you could say was too blessed to be stressed and too anointed to be disappointed and too elected to be defeat remember those days amen you know what you was young amen but then that body started going through some stuff and you know what before long you come in church and because the trials and the tribulations and the pressures and the strains and the circumstances it wasn't so easy to lift that hand no more amen clapping wasn't that easy no more come on church amen before long when somebody asked you how you was doing you didn't have time to tell him how bad things was going you know why because that body started going through something and then that preacher would get up and man you remember when you first got saved man brother Ben would get behind the pull pit and everything he said my it was like the fresh Angel bread dropped down from the corridors of Heaven come off of the Heavenly stove itself and drop right down in your soul and it was like honey and then you get through a few trials and through few tests and a few situations and before long the preachers got to preach for 10 minutes before you could even say Amen a you know what because he's got to lay you down sometimes and he's got to take this word and he's got to line you back up to this word you say brother Andrew that's a sign I'm not saved no that's a sign that there's a new spirit amen that's come on the inside of your heart when that old man was there that old man thought with every word that was preached that old man said well it's too hot and that old man said well I don't like the music and the old man said well he didn't sing my favorite song Amen but once the old man died and the new man come on he did not come forth holding a critical spirit he did not come forth holding a judgmental Spirit but he came forth holding forth the word of life my to than tonight church that we are not a bunch of church members but we are delegates of the Messiah Kingdom which means we are holding forth amen the word of this Kingdom and my Bible says that we come from the same line This Bible says they were stoned they were sown aunder they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wondered about in sheep skin they wondered about in goat skin being destitute and Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not even worthy amen they wandered in deserts and mountains and in dens and caves said what did they do they walk through the darkest places holding forth the brightest light Hallelujah can have minutes here and I'll quit soon they walk through the darkest places holding forth the brightest light church I want to tell you tonight no matter how hard it gets you just remember that the sun is still shining on the other side of those clouds brother and you know what it's just a it's just a quick trip through the clouds and you'll be back in the presence of the sun oh to think tonight that we have been called to live not by one word but by by every word to think tonight that we are a word bride living a life by the word and we are expressing amen the very thoughts of God therefore the word of life is not laying in a dormant Soul it's laying in a quickening spirit amen I'm trying to I'm trying to land here okay amen I got out I got out of the airport the other day over there in Auckland man I told brother Ben there is this big old Singapore Airline sitting out there man double had about six had about six wheels on each side man that thing moved real slow you know I thought my Lord I bet they got about three or 400 people on there and about 50 or 60 hundred or not that much about 50 or 60 some bags underneath each part of that plane and then you got all the other stuff in there I thought how in the world are they going to get it off the ground you know what the problem ain't so much getting it off the problem is getting it down and that's the same way it is when inspiration comes it may take a while to get off but when the of God start soaring friends aren't you thankful tonight that you ain't just soaring in justification you ain't just soaring in sanctification you ain't even soaring under a Pentecostal anointing but you are soaring amen under an eagle anointing and that eagle anointing is an adoption anointing it's a placing anointing it's a choosing anointing that is that is told you you was not born Amen to be chickened you was born to be transformal lied ah the spirit of God is truth and where the spirit of God is there is Liberty then therefore what does Paul mean when he says we are holding forth the word of life he is telling us to give our attention to this word he's telling us to apply ourselves to this word he is telling us to find our place in the word and there fulfill the place that was written of us amen you see here now if he could do that sir says if he could do that now how many believes that if you give your attention this message you're going to get a blessing he said now if he could do that sir you know it had to come from a supernatural resource he's talking to a man he just called out so with the audience see but it'll be up to them but what what if you think it's of the devil right then you get a devil's reward right but if you think it's God Amen catching a second wind if you think it's God then you get a god reward is't that beautiful you say what are you talking about Peter and John told a crippled man look on us but said those three words were three words to catch that man's attention and they said Silver and Gold Have we none but such as we have give we unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the Bible says immediately the spirit went through his body and a man that had been laying in church I mean had been laying all right had been laying by the gate for some hundreds or for some years how many years was that promise laying in the scripture that the sick shall be healed and the lame shall leap and the crippled shall walk and the Death Shall hear but in just a few minutes time in the presence of the God who wrote The Promise fulfilling the promise a man who had been sitting there crippled rose up on his feet and begin to walk brother how many can agree with me for a few minutes that you remember being there you was sitting in that church pew and you was crippled you was crippled with your past amen you was crippled with your mistakes you was crippled with all the troubles in your family you couldn't walk on the Promises of God for being crippled but then you heard a prophet say good evening friends you heard a man of God raise up and say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee and you look away to Jesus and that man of God by the preaching of the word of life amen got your eyes off of your problem and got your eyes on the answer to every problem of your life and he you set tonight amen with your family in the house of God here you set tonight in your right mind what done it Church there was a power word there was a word of life that was laying on the inside of your soul that was just waiting for the moment it wouldn't fall under denomination light but it would fall under the rising of the [Applause] sun god I close with this meditate upon these things and give thyself holy to them amen that thy profiting may appear yes to all amen I love this next verse and take heed unto thyself now people can take heed to everybody else in the church right right well it's so and so's fault and it's sister so and so's fault and it's just but he's saying take heed to th to thy own self yeah true and unto the doctrine and continue in them notice this for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee yeah so you've got the potential yeah to help the person you're criticizing amen amen amen amen amen that's Hallelujah that's right hey okay it's safe give thyself holy which means speak of coming to a fixed position and not just weighing in the balance being tossed to and fro come to a place that the prophet of God would say oh what a glorious thing it is for this church after 19900 years almost 2,000 years ago to know that he lives amen that we meet him on every Bend of the road at every turn at every place we go we see Jesus Hallelujah yes Lord see I love this his living presence flowing like radiant light from his glorious Church of the Living God how thankful we should be for that amen that the message was given at the Tomb come see go tell first thing come be convinced nowadays people don't want to come to see those who do come can't sit 10 minutes five minutes sometimes if you cross up their path they're gone come see don't just peep in right stand and look it over see don't look at this message yeah as just another idea amen yeah on this Bible yeah amen don't look at church as just another service yeah amen amen don't look at worship as just a song amen amen look at it as according to to the scriptures amen amen search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify me you said brother Ander how am I going to get a god reward I'll tell you said there was a woman laying on her bed one time she was sickly eat up with cancer he said there was a preacher a Baptist preacher who had a lot of theology he said that man knew the Bible and scriptures and all that he said but that man took one look at the picture of the pillar of fire hanging over brother said you've seen that yeah took one look at it and laughed and said oh that ain't nothing said that man laughed and instantly blasphemed wow sealed his Doom never to be forgiven again wow laugh at God he said now that man had a lot of theology yeah and he had a lot of understanding so-called understanding about the scripture he said but then there was a lady laying there all right yeah oh my who was eat up with cancer remember when you was eat up with sin amen remember when we was eat up with depression yeah remember when we didn't have no joy she was laying there dying remember when we was laying there dying I Can Am Without a revelation of who God is yeah but she saw that picture on the wall brother she couldn't explain it she couldn't put all the things together about it but she looked at it and she judged it as being God and he said that man judged it as being the devil and got a devil's reward which was a blasphemy and sealed out but she looked at it and judged it as God and she got a god reward and but said the cancer left her body and she stood up on her feet and she was healed brother do you see what she had to do no doubt there was a lot of unbelievers around her no doubt there was a lot of critics around her but there was something on the inside of her amen that was greater than what was around her therefore her atmosphere she was in could not stop her from judging God faithful and I tell you tonight Church no matter how dark it gets no matter how cold the world gets no matter how formal the churches gets no matter how how how controlling religion becomes there will be a bride who will live right here in the middle of a perverse and crooked nation and she will be harmless and she will be blameless and she will be him am stand our feet tonight as the musicians come see Jesus alone has the words of eternal life from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him and then said Jesus un the 12 will ye also go away but I love this then Simon Peter answered and said Lord to whom shall we go yeah for Lord if we leave you yeah then where are we going yeah amen for thou Hast the words of eternal life amen and we believe how many believes here tonight amen and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered them and said have not I chosen you 12 yeah and one of you is a devil he spoke of judas's scariot the son of Simon for he it was it should betray him being one of the 12 you see what he's showing you the word on the inside of you has greater power yeah than the spirit of unbelief amen amen around you Amen brother Ben they were all gathered there yeah yeah they were all gathered there and Jesus said will you go also yeah notice Judas is standing right there amongst them but the unbelieving spirit of Judas could not stop Peter from saying to whom shall we go amen for thou Hast the words of eternal life and I say tonight Church we're surrounded by a perverse Nation yeah we're surrounded by a crooked Society we're surrounded by a crooked government we're surrounded by all kinds of politics and that atmosphere cannot stop us amen from declaring Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God brother I'll tell you tonight there's something pulsating in my heart it's not just me holding forth the word of life it's the Word of Life holding me amen what will we do tonight friends on will we let this just be another message yeah that we put up on the archives in the shelf and another midweek or will we say Lord I'm tired of just hearing these things I'm ready to move amen into the Fulfillment of what I'm here amen I'm ready for this to become more yeah than just a book amen yes Lord I'm ready for this message to become more than just a picture Hallelujah to become more than
