[Music] [Music] amen God wash you this morning we are truly thankful to be gathered in this wonderful fashion you might take your seats for a moment now we appreciate the Lord and his kindness this morning and I greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ bring greetings from the church the Saints back home and they have been praying for us and we believe that God is in control of every situation I'm thankful to have my precious wife sister user with me here today and good to travel with your wife [Music] [Music] [Laughter] you on man God stays God he sovereign and that's why we love and appreciate him this morning that is is in control and we really thank you for your kindness and taking care of us while we here this weekend we'll be leaving tomorrow morning by God's grace going back to Auckland why we are here because my son has decided that he wants to move got an opportunity in Auckland and God opened some doors and they came and me and sister came with the grandchildren last week or before last week just to travel with them and make sure that they are fine and you have a beautiful country it's lovely and the people are lovely the Saints are lovely you know wherever you go the Saints are the same it's an amazing fact I always say you know what people try and create the denominations or any religious system they try and create people to be the same wherever they are they are established and they battle because they've got men in charge and they make rules and they send out they don't have a headquarters on earth our headquarters is in heaven therefore the Holy Ghost is in charge and what you see around you is really a miracle and I prove that the message is from God because even men trying to do their own thing they can't do it but God in his own sovereign right keep this bride under the word and she's fed she's growing and I always say to the people I don't care if your church is under the tree in Botswana or in a place called Wellington in New Zealand God will feed you he's not a respecter of person he looks at us all the same and that's what we believe in a fivefold ministry we believe in the restored Word and I'm not my heart and I trust it will be a blessing to you all and truly God has been gracious unto us and I'm really thankful to be here by invitation and I believe by God's will God knows what we need and I just pray that God will give us grace and unction this morning and really appreciate the church your pasta and all that God has done for us amen let stand as we turn in our Bibles the Judt chapter 1 verse 3 Jude chapter 1 in verse 3 amen Jude chapter 1 in verse 3 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful of for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints amen let's pray father as we appreciate you this morning the songs of Zion has been sung the atmosphere has been created of God and not as we come now to this part of father of this service where you need to speak to our hearts I pray Lord that you will take me O God and use me for your benefit for your people's benefit for the kingdom and the glory of the Aisne and know Jesus I pray the words of God that we have read that you will inspire it that you will bring life to they've got because your word says O God that letter will kill us but the Spirit will give us life so this morning Lord I healed myself in the congregation to the asking Lord that you will take full control that you will bless us now God and you will help us and that you will keep us O garden that your you will speak to every heart that we will say wasn't it good to be in the house of the Lord then in the hearts burn as he spoke to us along this wonderful way father we healed ourselves to be asking thy blessings now in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may take your seats I just want to take a little subject this morning of your faith and your position in Christ you know what God is a God whenever God says something there's a purpose behind it everything that God gives us there's a reason the Bible that he sends us the word that is that it is not just to make a book full of stories but everything he does there's a purpose and a reason behind it amen now the Prophet says you cannot act with faith until first you know what you're doing you've got to first know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it I mean that's why God sends a revelation that's why God opens the book and give us the revelation because imagine if you had no idea what to do how to receive salvation how will you receive it if somebody if you know in your heart you are lost and you need God how will you find the perfect way to get there that's why the Bible says you know how will they come all that will call upon me will be saved but how will they how will they be able to call if they don't know how to call and how will they know if I don't send somebody to tell them how to call it now how will they not know if I don't send a ministers unto them so God has got a set and pattern in a certain way to do things it will never send an angel from heaven to give you a uie message because he's got a certain pattern of doing things and that pattern can never change and therefore he God is not the author of con God wants you to settle you he wants to from were you going and that is the principle that's why a true son and daughter of God find stability upon the Word of God it's like a solid ground a solid place where you stand that when the wings of doctrine starts to blow around you you know where you're standing and you know where you're going and you know what to believe in because it's revealed to you and God gives you that grace now he says when God's people gets into trouble God always sends him a prophet is the pattern when you're in trouble God sends a profit and that profit comes to deliver aid the message of deliverance a message to the true were to bring them out it's never a time that Scots people ever gets in trouble unless God sends his words and his word as we had this morning came to the prophets and how do you test it to find out whether it's according to the word if it's according to the word then God's Word becomes alive now many might say this is the prophet of our church this is the prophet of our church and two of them contrary one to the other something's got to be wrong that's why God will never send two major prophets at the same time because that will cause major confusion when God sends a prophet it's one prophet and finish amen and that's why we believe our prophet now we must all speak the same thing then we must speak not contrary but count exactly what the word says that's how a true prophet is tested whether he's got the word the Bible says if their testimony is not according to the law and the prophets there's no light in them that's right it's got to be according to the word now in every case God sends a servant a prophet to bring the true word to them and the Word of God is what delivers the people always your deliverance always come from one source only and that is the Word of God no other gimmick no other thing that somebody can work up no emotion nothing else but the true Word of God is always what brings you deliverance and it's stable it's true it's a never it's an ever-changing is this word that is stable now when Gideon's time when he was in trouble the Midianites and the hammerites they came and they they they take took over the land and the enemy put out a challenge and every time the enemy puts out the challenge that challenge must be met so whatever happened if a coronavirus gets placed out there that challenge must be met there will be God's people and God will always meet the challenge of the hour amen in the prophecies the enemy speaks today and tries to say that the days of miracles is past that there is no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit and this is only emotion it's only woke up so the enemy has placed a challenge and when he places a challenge God will always meet that challenge he's never at time where there's a challenge placement God doesn't meet the challenge and God allows the challenge to be placed to show us the power the majesty and his greatness because if there's no challenge there is no battle there is no victory but with every challenge it's a golden opportunity to say Lord let me see your power and the greater the enemy rises up the greater God meets that challenge so doesn't matter what happened the worse that comes he [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you he cannot overstep the boundaries if he needs to change it he needs to go back to the owner and say Lord I you know I need to change it like well Toby went he could not go why doesn't he when he came to job overstep the boundaries God says you can do this that's why Satan has got no power the only power he has is the power that God allows him to do and if the purpose of that is to show you the greatness of God so he has to come and he came to job and he tried him he tested him and each failed and he had to come back to the one who gave the authority he could not overstep Satan is this lines drawn and that lies is the purpose is to protect you because God knows what you can endure God will never taste you above what you can endure God's purpose is not to destroy you God's purpose is to show you the strength the character and the beauty that's inside of you that's why God says I will never taste you about what you can endure never so if anything happens to you God will give you power and grace to endure you might think it's too much for me you might think I can never handle this you might you might in your flesh you might feel it too much but God's Word can never lie he will never test you above what you can endure and it's not easy tests and trials is not easy it's never easy but there's a reason and a purpose behind it because he says in the day when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up the standard of the world weighs that standard that standards inside of you because remember if you look at pressure pressure is something that is exerted on something from the outside so the pressure gets placed upon us as believers as the Bride of Christ and the pressure increases every day because we live in such a evil time for the world and it's Satan's Eden but the pressure increases but if if there's a one ton pressure placed upon your life what does God do he increases that same pressure inside of you also of one ton and it equals which makes this zero pressure on a believer that's why a believer can endure any trial any test any temptation because God is the equalizing factor you can never overcome in your own power in your might you need the grace of God if you don't have God's grace inside of you in deep trouble but God made a made a promise that he says I will equip you I will give you the grace that you need in this time to living so when the enemy places his challenge God meets the challenge and Gideon's time there was a challenge they took over and God met the challenge by sending the word and the Prophet says you know what every time he sends the word after the Prophet leaves the scene the word remains behind because it's the word that keeps it's the word that is that that that saving grace just we're living in a grand time that's why we live a wonderful time a grand time for the world it's chaos for us it's a grand time for a child of God it's a wonderful time a grand time immediately when the provident of the scene what happened the Lord came on the scene as soon as John went off the scene the Lord came on the scene very strange our God works but it does it it works in mysterious ways therefore you need the mind of Christ in your own mind you can never work out these things in your own mind you want a perfect world in your own mind when I become a Christian you know everything must be perfect but the reality is when you became a Christian chaos breaks out around you remember that amen it's no guarantee that when you become a Christian you won't have problems but there's one guarantee that you will overcome every one of them you will have an anchor you will have an hope you will have a desire you will have a vision and God will make sure that he will keep you and bless you Jeremiah 29:11 amen so we have to understand what's God's purpose because Satan will tell us God frustrates you he will come and he will show you to disappointments he will show you things that went wrong along this journey I can tell you many things that went wrong along this life's journey many people that failed me many people that disappointed me but we don't dwell on those things because there's better things to travel the grace of God the beauty of his character you know what he's doing in our lives it's much better to dwell on those things because those are everlasting things that we look at amen so all right can I read it Jeremiah 29:11 I know the plans that I have for you to prosper you not to harm you to give you hope and an expected end so God has got plans for you he says I know the thoughts that I think toward you so God knows it I mean he's got thoughts about you you know that the God that you serve he's got thoughts about you you personally not not as a church but you as an individual he thinks about you like you think about an individual he says I know the thoughts that I have towards you which means these thoughts that are projected towards you thoughts that what does God think about you this morning if you think carefully say I wonder and the Bible says it's thoughts of what of peace' thoughts of grace thoughts of of protection and then he says to bring you to an expected end your end is not unexpected your head is not uncertain your end is and that if the Lord comes you gonna go in the rapture if you die before that he's still gonna call you out of the ground you've got a certain end this cannot end you but you have a certain in its thoughts that God have about you I know the plans that I have for you the thoughts that I have for you and those thoughts of God can never change it does not matter what happened it does not matter where you go God's thoughts stays the same because those thoughts is what influence influence our love and remember God is never surprised you go out here you make an accident or something happen you are shocked and surprised oh god how did this happen to me you are shocked God already knew yesterday what's gonna happen to you today in fact you only knew that they you upon what's gonna happen the rest of your life so how can he be shocked and if he's not shocked how can you be shocked you should trust him to say Lord I depend upon you I believe you my faith my future is in your hands Lord I am NOT gonna listen to myself but I believe in this Heavenly Father which is a good father which is a beautiful wonderful father Exodus 34 24 well for I will cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders neither shall any man desire your land when you shall go up to appear before the Lord your God rise in the year so what is he telling them here he said to them I will cast out the nations before you didn't I say you will cast it out he says I will do it I will cast them out before you and wherever you go that will be yours and when you come to worship me don't worry about your land staying there unprotected no man will be able to take the land that I have given you and let me tell you clearly this morning no enemy will take what God has given you every promise in the Bible is yours and no enemy will be able to take it from you never ever again ever doesn't matter what happened because remember Satan is a squatter by as you get squatters I don't know if you get them yet but the about how they work is they look for vacant land with the owner lesion or close that right brother on poor a man and they walk and the next morning when the owner walks past it there's a little shack little little building they can build it in one day and the law is like such once they put up the roof you can't remove them so the target is when they move in get the roof up is that right so so they move with speed and they once the roof is up then you have to go to the courts you have to get an eviction order and then they must come then you must try and find other accommodation and it becomes an absolute nightmare but the trick was if you find him there when he moves in you have to move quickly you have to tell him or just remove him before he has done anything and that's the same of second don't linger when he moves in you have to move quickly and tell him you are a squatter you are out yet this is my position this is my land I'm not gonna allow you but we said that we entertain you we wonder what I'm gonna do next huh no you walk by Authority and you walk in there and you say this is my land you are out of here he jesus name take your key things on gold that's how we should treat Satan he's a squatter and the promises that God has given you you should not allow him entertain him or consider him you stand there by Victorine by faith to say you are out of you in Jesus name this is mine God has given it to me amen that's what God expect of us don't entertain him because the longer you entertain him the more you're gonna battle to get him out of your life it starts of a small thing coming small you said mind that's not so harmless and you start to entertain him and look at him what should I do you know and no the longer you wait the more troubles you will have because it becomes a stronghold and the longer you allow him to become stronger on your land more problems you'll have to get him out the key is when you see him and identify him move quickly move Authority and evict him a man don't feel sorry for him don't feel sorry or pity for him just kick him out and tell him go find another dwelling place this is not for sale that is not for rent nothing amen so in large what he says I will cast up the nations and I'll enlarge your borders so remember that is the attribute that God has given us is there to enlarge your faith you should never be content with your current status you should never be content to say this is all of it no there's plenty more to be had and therefore you should always strive to say Lord I need more of you I need more faith I need more grace I need more faith I know the victory Lord Jesus because you said you will enlarge whatever I have today I want more tomorrow whatever I have of God today I need more tomorrow because I am here to enlarge my camp I'm here to enlarge my faith I'm here to enlarge my victory amen we're not going backwards we're going forward we're not going down we're going up and therefore we have to enlarge everyday our desire should be Lord it's wonderful what I see today but wait till tomorrow I am expecting more I'm expecting to see God I'm expecting victory amen but Satan wants us to just be happy of the status quo but we should never be properties you know men always strives to be better that's why you always find better cars if you look at fifty years back the cars that they made you know if you look at them today it's like nobody wants it maybe if you're a collector you'll put it in the garage for memories and whatever but you compare those cars 50 years back to today's cars it's a it's a it's two worlds apart where does that come from it comes from men's desire to better himself he says and that attribute comes from God because God is perfect we come from perfection and we going back to perfection he says that's why men will never stop to better themselves it's an attribute that God gave them but we as Christians we have that attribute in the right way you say my perfection is in Jesus Christ I am looking to be perfect like he's perfect I'll be perfect it is his perfection a man you can be perfect because he's perfect but we have to desire that expansion it must be a need in your heart it must be something to say but I I want it I desire it I need it I I i I long for that expansion and it comes that's how change comes by a burning desire that all I need more of you I need a got you to help me you need to come to a point where you know I need more than I have today amen and then when the desire is there then you have to act upon the desire you have to get up and walk you have to get up and do something you know we should not be just stagnant we should rise and say Lord I need more I've got a desire for more so I'm gonna start acting that I'm gonna receive more I'm gonna start walking because the promise is wherever the soles of your feet goes that belongs to you you cannot stand stagnant I need more you should say Lord I need more I'm gonna take it by faith and then you start to walk into every promise that God has given you it needs action action remember we should not be lazy we should not be content in that matter we are content with God's grace and what is done but we should not be lazy we should always strive to say Lord give me more of that grace make me a better Christian make me a better husband make me a better wife make me a better child make me a better preacher make me put ever lot better in every sense for your glory and for your honor amen it's like j-job is his prayer in 1 chronicles 4:10 he cried unto God he says o God of Israel that you would bless me and enlarge my coasts that your hand might be with me and that you would keep me from evil and that it may not grieve me why did job has do that he was the son of God he was the son of God he was blessed but he wanted more you wanted more of God increase me give me more grace give me more of thyself give me our God and don't let it grieve me but then it's satisfy me let it make me stronger amen because your enlargement is in God's hands God says I will enlarge your territory God wants to do it God God wants it's part of his plan for us but that's why I said in the beginning we have to understand what's God's plan you have to know what God wants for you to have faith in it and for you to walk in it that gives you that gives you an unction to know that I'm in the will of God when I ask for more I mean the will of God when I ask him to bless me more I'm in the will of God 1 chronicles 19 verse 13 1 chronicles 19 verse 13 be of good courage and let us behave yourself valiantly for our people and for the cities of our God and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight so yea the army comes in of the enemy lot of them gathered together against God's people go read the whole passage at home and show up so the battle was against him and he started to encourage the people he tells them be of good courage he tells them let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people for the cities of God and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight so why does he say that because your behavior has got an influence on the people around you your behavior as a Christian has got a profound influence on your family and then the believers are on their church what happens if we are in battle I believe we are in battle you know you're in a battle surely we are in a battle the battle is heavy it's raging some of us are bleeding but we are still in the battle so imagine we standing in the frontline and we the enemy we are fighting the enemy and we have got a line here and all of us together all of us here this morning of front-line battle soldiers every one of you yeah you are a frontline soldier so we are standing shoulder to shoulder because we need to show the enemy unity because the enemy's tactic is to fight and conquer that's why he likes to isolate you pull you from the church or pull you separate or put you some on some by the big thing or whatever he wants to but these purposes once he can separate you he's got you because the enemy always focus on those that are separated and alone and so on and then he attacks onto them but as if you stand shoulder to shoulder he knows you're a united front and he knows that you understand where your strength comes from so you stand there and we stand out we say today's gonna be a wonderful battle and I can't wait for the first verse first shots to be fired and you're already all briefing line up and the next moment that the the soldier next you start to cry oh my and he's weeping bitterly and you ask him but what's wrong and he says today we're gonna die there's enemies to pick and he cries terribly and he scream more god help me I'm too weak and I am listen that and he's crying bitterly not long the person's next to him will also cry because that influences we asking but why is he crying he knows something that I don't know what couldn't it today's trouble and so that that influence split down the line and before long the whole church is in panic that's why he says you have to behave with courage even if you think you know I don't know how we gonna do it but by the grace of God you have to stand with courage to say you know what I can't do it but my God says he will never leave me no forsake me he will be with me even in me I take courage from my god and your courage encourage two 1x2 you put your arms around that brother or sister and say brother don't worry this battle is not yours its gods he will fight for you he will take control he will fight it for you and that encouragement when will foot so don't wait and see who's crying or not if somebody is crying immediately in college if somebody is weak immediately in college because that weak one will cost you the battle so you must understand my role is to identify to help sometimes maybe somebody is weak then you must intercede help make him strong being of good courage and behaving ourselves valiantly so the word courage means to be alert physically and mentally to be agile to be quick to be energetic Amen so if you want to encourage somebody show him that you believe in this God show him that you believe the word to him that you believe the message by friends a brother don't worry out stand in front of you I'll take the bullet for you brother I believe that my God can do it it becomes then that college Dean rubs off on him then he was start using my that's a wonderful attitude I'm gonna have the same attitude and imagine a Church of God having an attitude of courage that I don't care I'll preakness enemies I've got courage to face him it gives us grace prophecies in the message witnesses he says it's like old buddy Robertson said Lord give me the backbone like a saw log that's the kind of witnesses to be kind God likes us to be courageous it's an attribute that God loves when his children becomes courageous not in their own ability to know that you know I am actually weak but he is strong since when I am weak he is strong so that gives me courage to go and stand right in the front line right in the front line I don't want to be the pack I want to be right in the front line anyway you can smell the back where you can feel the heat we went to the museum yeah yesterday what do they call the museum the Papa and they had a display there of the soldiers the big statues and how they the battle was going in white was so real those statues those men they made there was so soul of you you feel like they're gonna stand up any moment and talk to you but you can see the agony you can see they were experienced how they experienced that frontline battle but that God wants us to be good rageous to stand him to know because remember where the enemy looks at you he examines the wall front line he's looking for the weak one looking for the weak spot that's why the Church of God should be all courageous and stand there even if you are the weakest one in the church your courage come from God you have to stand there and trust and depend that's why you know in our days when I was a young boy my dad and then his brothers and though they used to look what I like to watch the boxing you know so and they would be interested who's gonna win and whose car what but the whole city but there's all preparation before the fight even starts you know they get into the ring these two guys and they've got the trainer's then the trainer psyches them up and you know tell him how good he is and not wonderfully isn't this is that and then he comes and the next moment what do they do they come to the middle of the ring and they go and stand in front of one another but face to face like that and he looks if you look him in the eye you don't blink why because you want to show him I'm not scared imagine you hiding in the corner there and you're already showing him my goodness I don't know what you're gonna do to me but I'm already shaking that man oh the battle is over before it even started but if you walk in there like the Prophet Calise victory walk and you're walking there and you come and stand right in front of Satan you tell him today I am here in the name of the Lord I'm in business today he knows he's in for a fight he knows that you know who you are it gives us and that's why God loves us the Prophet says to be courageous to know you know if you're in a battle then you have to have the attributes of a soldier which is courage it taught you sure before he crossed over he says be thou very not just courageous but for this battle you need to be very courageous and for this end time living battle you need to be very courageous you need to trust in this Living God well you will say if God will tell me like he did Joshua I would have some courage too he says he has told every believer the same thing God has told you to be very courageous so if God told you that you can believe him but then you have to act on it and become courageous become courageous and stand there amen because remember courage means the ability to face and deal with dangerous or difficult situations so if there's no dangerous situations you can never be courageous you don't need courage when there is no problem if everything is fine and the bank is full of money the cars full of petrol you know everybody's healthy you know everything is just bites like heaven on earth but you need courage that's why problems come in in different forms all of a sudden somebody will become sick all of a sudden somebody will lose their job all of a sudden God allows those things because if God hasn't allow it we will have heaven on earth because we will no need courage if it will be everything will be perfect but God allows those things to come for that courageous attribute to come out of you that you can say my now I need to have courage because I'm facing a dangerous situation I'm facing a problem and that brings out courage that's why if that never happens you will never know who you are the things that happen to us is there to identify him to bring out the characters the things that God wants us to see so there's two parts to this he says the first part is to face the dangerous situation and the neck of the next part is to deal with it you know we we our people are funny amen when we we we we don't like to face difficult situations we run away and we rather ignore it hope it's gonna go away but he says the the victory lies in to face it and deal with it if you've got a problem in your life face it and deal with it if you have an issue face it and deal with it that's part of the victory you're gonna run for a long time that thing will follow you wherever you go but facing it and dealing with it there is the courageous victory that God wants us to do amen mark chapter 11 verse let's take it from verse 12 macht checked eleven was 12 now Jesus is speaking here or there relating the Bible says mark 1112 says and on the morning when they will come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man each fruit of the hereafter forever and his disciples heard it now he comes he knows it's not trick time he's like by a certain time of the others lemons there's oranges if you go in the middle of summer you don't find it because it's not the season so here it comes to a tree he's grown up there he knows exactly they won't be any fruit day but he's expecting fruit and that's a God is he's expecting fruit in season and out of season you can't say I live in Lodi sure it's impossible to bear fruit God knows he's impossible but he knows he's given you the ability by His grace to bear fruit well it's impossible he will want fruit from your life even in a desert he wants fruit from your life because your roots should go into the stream of life your energy should not come from this it should come from him so when you are tapped into God you can bear fruit in a desert it doesn't matter how tried is around here you'll be like a green tree you'll be like an oasis verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots you see where they cursed it from from the roots it started to dry up and Beach according to remembrance said and we master behold the fig tree which thou cursive is worth that away and jesus answered and said unto him have faith in God so now the he says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen whatsoever thou shall say unto this mountain so I want you to carefully understand yet God is specific it doesn't say what you ever you shall say unto a mountain this mountain which means it's it's identified God is very specific always you will find him now you see you have to believe he says whatsoever you a mountain visa is a symbol of anything in your life any problem any situation anything that's there is a mountain that you have to overcome so the prod that the thing is you have to identify it you have to know so what we do normally we don't speak to the mountain we spit out the mountain oh my I have got so much problems we speak about our problems day in and day out I tell every all goodness and we speak about the mountain let me say if you will speak about the mountain he will cast himself into the sea he doesn't say if you speak to somebody else about the mountain it will disappear he say if you will speak to this mountain he will have results that's why we fail many times because we we don't take God's program you have to say where's my mountain identified and give it a name and say I'm speaking to this mountain amen specific because you can speak generally about Satan he won't he won't even blink an eye you will speak about about your problem Satan won't move but when you call his name that's why I mean in the discernment when the Prophet was doing the sermon he will pray for somebody with heart trouble what are you identified he starts to identify that demon and he starts to address that demon he speaks to this mountain and in this mountain calls on another one for help and so they start to communicate but you have to address that one and then when you address that one the others start to get fearful and then he address one by one says that one has got heart trouble that one has got heart trouble that one has got out trouble and they are all healed because he's starting to address them and that's what Satan doesn't like it when you identify that mountain and you start to come to that mountain and you take that script you say the Lord says if I shall say to this mountain then Satan start to fear he says if you shall say to now think about an example David David a young man anointed king he knew who he was after he was anointed you believe me he had faith in the Prophet that the Prophet didn't make a mistake when he anointed him King so after the Prophet anointed him what does David do he carries on with his normal day-to-day life he doesn't come to the palace and say here's my office trying to put himself into the office he know if God called me God will place me and God will move me and God will use me and God will do all these things so easy relaxed man and he's just going about his business and his father says listen take the Russians take the food to your brothers and he's happily going taking the food he since the carrier and when he comes the egg out comes Goliath and Goliath stands Denny boasts anyone of you fight me if they weren't will serve you if I went you'll serve us and you know he's just posting and making a video girl of them and where do you find God's people no courage that's why David was a man after God's own heart he had courage he had that understanding God loved him he had many mistakes he had plenty that you can put God loved him because he had courage he had a love for God he knew his own position so he stands there and he's explaining excited because he's gonna see a battle and he's trust him who's gonna fight him and I say God you just yet to make trouble because he's excitement was a condemnation to them and don't let you know sometimes when believers get too excited others get upset because it's maybe a condemnation to them just know that God loves it when you are encouraged and when you are when you are as somebody that stands for the word don't let somebody push you down just raise up above it and say father by your grace and David says who's gonna fight him and they make skews they try to send him away but he refuses because he's there to see the battle because the enemy has made the challenge remember what I read in the beginning prophet says when the enemy makes a challenge God will always meet the challenge so whenever he challenges you earth God will meet that challenge that is a fact you can believe it and he says no if you won't go I'll go and it comes to the king there's a young man he's ready to go and the King calls him he says my that's wonderful news but you don't have armor you don't have been take my homage the best that the military military can produce and he puts it on and we know how he just said but I can't go with his in I'm uncomfortable so when you go and fight this enemy do try new gimmicks don't try new things that you can buy only water on the internet or do this or do that just take it in the in the way that has never failed the Word of God before you and that's it plain and simple he says no remove this from me I know the God that saved my ship from the bear that saved him from the lion that used me that's the God I trust and as he comes now you you must carefully notice he comes through he picks up the five stones his God ease his slingshot and as he comes he starts to apply that if you will say to this mountain he starts to call gloves name because he want Goliath to understand that I'm talking to you not to the whole army not to I'm talking to you he said to him he said to him when Goliath so he says I'm coming to you to you Goliath he identifies him and he tells him in no uncertain terms you your name is my list and he says I'm coming to you in the name of the Lord and then he goes further he starts to tell him what is he gonna do with him that's what God you want to tell your enemy I'm coming to you in the name of the Lord and I'm gonna do this to you I'm gonna cost you out I'm gonna remove you from this place I'm gonna do this he says I am gonna kill you to take it doesn't save God give me clay so I hope I'm gonna kill you oh my if I fight he just come and he stood firm courageous because remember God will pack you up if you come by faith God will never never never leave you he will back you all the way from your right to the battle is I come to you in the name of the road and today I'm gonna kill you and in fact today I'm gonna cut off your head and I'm gonna lift it for the nations to see so what is he doing he's pronouncing the battle before it happens and those words then become effective those words are out in the air and now God knew this is what David's health the battle was clear the outcome was to find everything was there and Goliath is upset says is this the best you can produce a young man if he felt insulted he felt there was no match that's why God will never use your ability God will strip you of every ability that you think you have that when you stand in front of him that day you will know it's only the grace of God but I'm ready to be courageous and he comes any any and Goliath curses him and us but David has pronounced the battle he identified the enemy he told him he's gonna kill him and he told him how he's gonna kill him I'm gonna cut off your head I'm gonna lift it up now remember how do you I mean how you cannot cut his head off if he's still alive because David is small this man was huge a giant but if a giant flesh flat on the floor it's easy to step on him you know so the purpose is to first get him in the right position so they were try the slingshot and I believe that it wasn't David's ability in the slingshot because remember that giant skull was so thick you can throw that stone at any speed it can never penetrate a skull like that it might give him a little red dot but that's it but he had confidence in God and he starts to wind up the slingshot and I believe even if he let it go backwards the Holy Spirit would have turned that stone and given it supernatural power and it penetrated his head and the only comes and David now doesn't start to rejoice because remember he knows what is expected here pronounced what he's gonna do it doesn't stop halfway and that's the thing many times we stop too early many times we are so excited that the giant went down we stopped off with God don't want you to stop halfway he wants you to complete the task I mean he wants you to be dedicated he want you to understand I am here to destroy this enemy I am here to take him out not just to wound him I'm here to take his head off that is the purpose of the bride is to take his head under your feet completely defeated everything now I'm sure the the the soldiers behind him was ready shouting and screaming but he knew he went forward he took showed them he had to complete the task like when Elijah was there and he was busy dying and his last days he was sick and the king came to him he says you know what what is gonna happen to us the enemy is fighting us tell us tell me what what what what is the future and the Prophet says take the bow and arrow and shoot it through the window and he said to him King take the arrow and hit the ground the King took the arrow neat which one two three and he stopped and the Prophet was upset is why did you stop at number three why don't just continue to hit the ground five six seven times because he then you would have destroyed the enemy completely now you'll only have three victories and they will be G God don't give us beforehand everything you want you to act by inspiration he want you to be courageous you want you to stand there as a son of God and he looks at your action and he's pleased when you start to act like your David and David took his head off and it was a glorious victory so how do we do the same thing the first thing you have to identify that mountain identify the problem in your life and give it a name if it's lust if it's you know stealing if it's anything give it the lightning because once you have the name you can focus on it yes don't say the devil is a problem in my life which one that's plenty if you speak to this one the other one said no he's not speaking to me speaking to you but when you call his name he can't run he can't hide your coming to him and that's why we have to be specific and identify him identifying then he knows his pattern is pushed you coming he can't run he can't hide I can't do anything and that's why if you have a problem that's the way to deal with it come and say I have a problem and the problem is this then everybody know okay we are dealing with this problem not just general I have all of us has got problems but specific give him that name that you get that when you speak you speak tree then you must be very clear on what you want come and beat Lord I need this devil ripped from my life I need this out of my family I need it not to hinder I need it you must be clear like a David he was clear I need to cut his head off and so you must be I'm gonna I'm here to kill him be clear what you want and be clear on the result you want David was clear and what he wants and the result he wants to achieve because remember there is power in your words the prophecies there's a power inside of you that can create another by faith you can do so you understand that if I speak if I can speak those things there's a power behind what I've said and then if I've done it under inspiration and done it according to the Word of God God will back it up and so the enemy also knows that so he's scared when you start to go down this line then you have to go and place yourself positionally David wasn't sitting in the tent throwing the rock from the tent many times we want to sit in the tent wait for the battle to finish don't call me when it's over after the prayer meeting call me after this call me but he wants you to be right in front of the enemy positionally because since this battle is not yours but then he tells them tomorrow morning early gold place yourself in front of the enemy you'll see me in battle but you have to be a witness that God is a mighty battle if you're always in the tent you have no witness you never seen God in battle you have never seen the victory the power when that giant falls and the dust Rises that is good to see good to be but you can only see it in the frontline right there so position is important identify be specific and tell him what you want and also place yourself in front of that enemy because God God is a God that likes to show his power that's why he says to them this battle is not yours I'll go and fight for you tomorrow so we would expect fine I'll just sit at home and wait till the battle is over but then God says to him tomorrow morning early go and place yourself in front of the enemy you need faith to do that because you know if God doesn't back me up I'm dead because the enemy is outnumbered me but they go the early morning and they go and stand in front of enemy and they start to worship God God wants you to worship Him in this battle your purpose and your reason is to worship Him and tell him how great he is how wonderfully is how precious is O'Reilly and one we start to worship the enemy will start to fall one by one by one amen and that says that's the right sequence many times we come into God and we open the door says Lord I need the BMW I need the job I need the money barging into the house of all your needs God knows you need he knows it better than yourself but he says first come and worship me first come and tell me first come and express your love that's every in every battle it starts of worship if you want to overcome this enemy it starts with worshiping him telling him what you are great you are wonderful you are kind you are the mighty God then God gets presence comes down in fact we should leave our problems by the door when you come to church on a Sunday whenever you come leave your problems out like you come to worship God knows you're Pro hue if you want you worship you'll take care of all your problems but Satan tells us no you're sitting here you thinking about tomorrow but the job and the money or the problem at work or the issue or this and Satan keeps your mind busy so you're in church but you India your body is here but your Nadya God don't want your body here he wants you yeah he wants you to be active involved English we want you to leave those problems behind when you come to the door physically drop them tell the devil I'm dropping those big bags of problems at the door I am free to worship my god and express my love to him amen then you have to be patient God well God doesn't always move in me be patient with him he says you have to be patient with God because otherwise you know God creates spoiled children God every time the levers you ask you know what happens to your children when they ask and you give you asking you give they ask you give you create a perception so the next moment they're asked and you say no what happens big tantrum hitting the floor I've got a two and a half year old grandson Molly I tell you that man keeps us busy you can't negotiate over two year old he's got his own mind and when we walk in the streets of Oakland he walks like this oh if you're picking up his things he wants to do his own thing and you just have to be patient but God don't create spoiled children that's why it says pray lord I need this in your time if it's your will Lord not my will but your will be done I'm content Lord you know the best for me I am happy Lord to trust you and believe you Lord I not just do as you please to me I am your child Lord amen Joshua chapter 14 verse 10 Joshua chapter 14 and verse states and now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as he have said these forty and five years even since the Lord speak this word unto Moses while the children of is I wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old a man who's speaking there it's Caleb now Caleb is a type of the bride so yeah he's Joshua is Caleb we know how they came and the mournful testimony they had but he comes to a point where they after the 40 years that they've traveled in the world as they come back again to enter the Promised Land now he's got a testimony next verse 11 as yet I am a strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come eat that is a true believer a true believer doesn't become weaker and weaker he becomes stronger and stronger as the journey goes on he knows his position Caleb knew his position he could have been a better man because he was walking 40 years in the desert because of other people's unbelief if you have that attitude you will hate everybody in the church I'm only here because your unbelief I'm ready for the rapture so you're keeping me back sure anything but Caleb had a good attitude he walked 40 years without complaining without murmuring he was a man of courage and he courage those around him to tell him I've seen the land is a land of milk and honey we gonna make it no complaining I'm walking with you that's why we must be willing to walk with one another some are strong some are weak but we have to walk together and be an encouragement to say brother don't worry we gonna make it I tell you there is a land amen if you're the bride you should be like Caleb be encouragement don't murmur and complain we can be here for another 40 years I hope not but no there's no guarantee I remember when we came into the message watch 25 or 27 years ago I thought I just made it really I was so happy I said god I think it you waited for me let's go but today I'm thankful that he waited because many came after me so God knows the last one and I always say you must love every day as if it's today but you plant your potatoes as if you're gonna be here for another 10 years that's the balance that God gives a Christian to know and that's why I thank God for a prophet that told us these things imagine if I can tell you by absolute vindication that the rapture is tomorrow morning 10 o'clock all right so if a school if you will go to work tomorrow right what do you mean work I'm gonna go out I'm gonna draw my last money we're gonna go for a big meal I'm gonna spend everything I have because I you know I don't need it anymore but the Prophet says if you know the rapture is ten o'clock nine o'clock you'll report for duty because that is our duty to carry on until the Lord comes and takes us doesn't matter when it doesn't matter how we are planting your potatoes we are here as an example we let our light shine amen so we have to find that fine balance what's the next verse there was a 12 Joshua 14 we just read let's go to 12 he says now therefore now listen to this it is I'm ready I'm stronger now I haven't lost my faith I'm ready now he says now therefore give me what mountain was that when he went over and he spied the land he looked for the spot when the Giants was too that's why he knew I was born to be a giant killer no one of the others can take that portion because they're gonna fail but I know why God has called me to be a giant slayer and therefore he says give me first Mountain he was specific he was clear don't give me the portion next to the river don't give me the easy life give me the purpose why I'm here so don't pray for an easy life say lord give me the giant that I must slay give me the problems that I can handle to show that there's a god that is alive to show there is a victory to be had give me this mountain where of the Lord speak in that day for thou hurt us in that day how the Anakin's were there and that the city were great and frenched if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be also to drive the able to drive them out as the Lord said so he's going for the most difficult spot if God can losing say my what do you want a little bit easier medium or hot amen most of us will most probably say easy easy one Lord you know I had I've walked 40 years already in the message so I think the last few years give me just the retire me Lord but not you Caleb not the bride the Lord I cannot do anything else I am a giant killer I am here to take down French cities I am here to take down straw walls I am here to be victorious another matter how old are all I mean the message I am poor I can't do anything else amen that's who we are so College is doing what you are afraid to do amen courage is because where there's no of that fear there's no college now remember there's two kinds of fears there's a godly fear and there's an ungodly fear the godly fear pushes you closer to God it gives you respect to the word it gives you respect to God gives you respect to believers it gives you respect to the offices it helps you because you understand your position now imagine the woman she has got a great need she comes to the Lord and the Lord is busy in a very important meeting with his disciples and they are talking and he comes and she comes from the side and she says master I haven't eat my daughter is sick to death now the first thing he does he ignores her now none of us like to be ignored we are human we like to be acknowledged we like to be talk nicely too because we are human there's no human that I've met that likes when somebody did accuse him scolds him calls him names we would like to be respected honored treated with dignity because we are made that way that's the way we should be now we geek no sir no that's the first remember when you when when God God loves to test your testimony test your faith test if you say I'm a believer it must be tested if you say I want victory it will be tested anything that you do will be tested so if you raise your hand ursa I need her like we sang this morning oh god take me closer to thee when you raise your hand you're putting a Lord Saint tests and trials that's in fact in plain language what you saying so don't cry Monday morning when the first test comes you must know I've applied for it yesterday Lord now give me the ability to pass this test because if you fail a test God is not like we do but where I come from you can't pass you can't fail any more is that right brother Paul don't want to tell too much where we come from but in school they there's a principle that when you fail they can tell you you failed anymore they just say you're not competent yet but they move you to the next level so you move of this not competent yet all the way through maybe I don't know how far they will take it but God is not like that if you fail God says just do it over you're gonna make it one day because God has got patience he's got time so he his purpose is for you to become an overcomer he's purposely used to be strong a solid son and daughter of God now this woman standing there's now the first the dist sir and he ignores her flatly and she continues and she continues until the point whether the disciples his Lord said that away she's disturbing the meeting so now there's a dialogue about this woman now Jesus goes to the next level because the first one she she passed the first test which was he's ignoring her many of us will fail that one miserably somebody ignores you you upset somebody does this you know yeah we are upset that we don't like but Jesus stayed she knew why she came she had a need and she knew where the need was and she came and she made a decision by faith that I'm not gonna leave until I get what I came for now God Tesla Eve no sir no the next thing the disciple says man she's making a big noise saying they're away because the disciple ready saw that the Lord is not going to do anything for her so now he's going to deny he's helping the Lord now to to get rid of her saying that her way Lord she's making a noise here I can tell you then he says yeah sure I'm actually not even for race she's a dog now that would check it all of us you'll take your Bible your message book and say I'm finished you won't see me again but she had a different attitude she had an understanding whatever he says I'm saying amen and she says Amen Lord but the talks can look from the counts when she says that she pulls his attention he turns her he says my greatest I faith woman go home that totally as well without prayer without anything cheap poot healing right from Haven Heights threw him right to our house without anything he says go home you're totally as well your attitude will produce results your attitude towards the word will produce mighty mighty miracles your attitude towards cards will produce things which you have never seen before so that's why God always disses us yeah don't think is his you know we as humans once it's easy we wants it so you know if God can just come down and give me the full program and tell me what's gonna happen the week and Monday and Tuesday until the day of the rapture then I'll be so happy but God will never do it because along this road he's gonna test you he's gonna try you he's gonna come like Elijah and Elijah when he came and he called him and Elijah was trying to make excuses the Prophet never begged him God will never beg you God gives you your own decision you are a free moral agent you are a free moral agent but remember God doesn't make all your decisions for you he allows you to make decisions it's a gift of God because he will commonly present the gospel to you say come give your life to me he will call you he will call you he will call you because remember you have power of decision until you make the decision once you make the decision the power is taken away let's say God calls you and he's saying come to me give your life to me in your leisure and you give your life to Him he takes you and it takes that they see the power of the decision away and now you become a prisoner you can never escape again he froze the key away in you a yeast forever that's what God does but the same principle comes to a negative site if you are a young man or woman stands then somebody presents you that first drink or that first smoke you have got power of decision until you take that drink until you take that drug once you do that the power is taken away you become a slave of that very demon that's why it's so important to play and to say Lord before I make a decision let me make the right decision because I've got power until I say yes or no therefore you have to understand it's a great opportunity and responsibility decisions that God gives us to make but this woman was what's dedicated she knew that I'm not going to go until he helps me because Timothy says for God did not give us a spirit of Timothy but a spirit of power and of love and of self discipline and perfect love drives out fear [Music] another thing that we must help us remember your position if you don't know who you are you'll be in trouble but you must know your position in Christ you have to understand he has made me strong he has redeemed me he has washed me of his blood he has given me a save me as he has completely forgiven me he has helped me we have to confront our fears amen we have to understand remember what the Prophet says he had a dream about a man being like his father and a woman being like his mother and she was there and this man was an evil man and this woman when she rises up he's got a a a big club in his hand with three knocks on it and when she tries to rise up he beats her down and he was scared of the man it was a big man he was he's a small guy he was big small and now he beats and beats and he he doesn't know what to do and he says at one point he just walked up to the man now you can see again he has to face he has to face the problem he stood in the corner for a long time scared nothing happened God will not do anything until you move you have to move and place yourself positionally understand who you are where you come from where you going and as he comes to the man and he takes him by the collar this when I took him I looked and all of a sudden my muscles which was so small became strong it grew fight he call it faith muscles I become so strong he says that that man looked at me and he became scared of me and I told him if you hit her again you're gonna deal with me and he took control of the situation he says that's what God wants of us to be courageous taking control of the situation to say Satan is not gonna control my life I am a creator by Jesus Christ grace and therefore I can control I can do things that I that I'm not even aware of so you will never win until you rise up and face your responsibilities because there's no value in worry you can worry the whole day it's not gonna change anything and we all worry we worry over this we worry with that we are cut there's no value in worry but faith can unlock the door faith can bring the promised faith can do things that we have a need of because God has given sound mind and it's not your mind it's the mind of Christ to understand these things you have to have the mind of Christ because your own mind will say man that can never work but Christ's mind says you are more than able from Christ Jesus our Lord guy's mind says you can do it because you're more than able another thing you must remember you must censor your inputs amen what that means is don't listen to people that are negative because they will have a terrible effect upon you because they are feeding your fears you have to listen to what God says surround yourself with people of faith that can talk the faith language if you surround yourself of people that talk fear and those things they will feed that fear before long you will be fearful you will be scared you will not be able to do anything amen you have to surround because remember when Joshua came up and the ten spies went over they went over and as they came back they brought evidence of a good land they were excited they were happy Caleb and Joshua was ready to move over into the land but the ten spies says we can't do it and the Bible says they said listen let me tell you what I saw there I was walking and I saw a man I look like a grasshopper next to him and when the nation's start to hear that what happened they fear God feeding and the Bible says they all became scared and they all said we're not gonna do it Joshua and Caleb says we can do it here's the proof we can do it but the tenth of their report faded the fear of the people and of all people pulled back and say we're not gonna do it so fear that feeding of the fears a dangerous thing you have to surround yourself with people that feed your faith be an encouragement be an encouragement to one another amen be an encouragement to be able to stand and to be able to know so why don't we fear the devil amen because he's a liar you can't fear a liar because he's a deceiver if he tells you you not gonna make it you must know it's a lie so the opposite must be true if he tells me this then I must take the opposite then I know I'm gonna make it because he can never tell the truth and because God is with us we can never fear the devil because God is the creator of the devil the devil never created himself God created him and that Creator is my god so he says you have to be strong and courageous be strong and courageous do not fear or be in dread of them for it is the Lord your God who goes with you you will not leave you nor forsake you so the battle is not yours but it's God and the footsteps of the righteous are foreordained my is the time up can I get five more minutes I'm almost halfway but I'll finish now then he says be be courageous and then he says be valiant a man be valiant valiant in the Old Testament is for the most part the translation of power or might it is applied to the courageous and to men of war so with this courageous courage that you must have you must be valiant which means it gives you power courageousness comes and then the valiant nurse brings the power now if you think of Amanda let's let's take an example shammgod he's now yeah he's a faithful believer he's working hard in his garden and frying food supply for his family and he plants and he does but there's a problem because every year when harvest time is ready here comes the enemy drums beating boom boom boom boom 600 soldiers come over the hill and when he hears the drums he said Oh ik said to his wife oh my they're here again I hope I wish they never came this year and they come up to him there and the greeting morning Shamgar the office is looking nice this year thank you man you are a good worker and they take the soldiers they collect everything and there they go Tom Garland's family going through the house they cry say Lord how is it why how can you allow this Lord we work our heart we are faithful we are true and there they come and they pray Lord please next year Lord keep him away and the next year Havas is ready and he starts to hear the faithful drums doo doo doo doo comes the same enemy and so it repeats and they even more impresses and might this year's a record like old men it's wonderful yo you're a good man chamku and they collect an egg on sham bark rice and the next year they come up with a heel again but now there's a difference it's not the same soldiers same field same house the same man everything is the same but there's one thing that has changed he has now become a man of Valor he has now taken a decision last night that the player at the table he told his wife Mircea is a different year this year's the year of Jubilee this year is my year same man same good his same rain same Sun same everything and he comes and as they come down they come too and he comes and he stands in the middle of the road they get him good morning and he was maybe polite good morning my the harvest is nice thank you just step aside we're here to collect and he had now a different attitude he said man if you want this is that's behind me you have to come through me what do you mean you are one man we are 600 don't moisture don't waste your time and he says no I've drawn the line I've made a decision I have taken my decision and I am standing by what I want and what happens they said to the first line take him and remember only either stick with him a wooden stick that you prop the the kettle with and the the the Spirit of God came on him not before after he took the stand after he made the testimony after he said no more this is the end of it then the Spirit of God came on him God comes on the last minute he won't that's if he had that spirit last night and so it would have been but it wasn't an easy decision he had to make the decision from himself he had to trust God by faith from himself because that's real faith and when they came in the Spirit of God came in that stick and it started to move and the Bible says he killed all 600 that was the end of his problem the end of the enemy because he made a decision amen same conditions everything the only thing that changed was his decision his attitude towards the problem became a different attitude and it resulted in a different result before it they came in their problem but when he said this is mine you must know what is yours your family is yours the promises is yours no enemy can take it from you you are God's people but we have to accept it and act upon it in closing when Jesus preached one day a mighty sermon and he was in the boat got into the boat he said take me over to the other side and he went and he slept in the back of the boat and that mighty testimony service and how he did miracles and talking about it and the devil came and he started to bring a tempest and the winds start to blow and the waves start to gather momentum and it became a massive storm and they were fighting it because they were fishermen they knew the sea and they were draining the boat and they they they they they had first thought they gonna they gonna win this one but as time went this the the storm became a supernatural storm and they realized we're gonna die today and they kept looking at Jesus and they couldn't understand how can he sleep we are dying in his sleeping we are perishing and he's not he's not there for me how many times we go through things and we feel like God has forgotten me goddess he's not interested in me he has not thought about my needs and at that point they couldn't keep any more they wake him they shook him and they said master what was their first words don't you care that's what the devil will tell us God don't care let me tell you God kids God cares because He loves you he knows about you he knows your situation and he woke up he was in a deep sleep now my question to you is he was not in a different storm he was not in another realm he was in the same storm in the same boat that they will how could he sleep and they were fighting for their lives because he knew who he was he knew he was the son of God this son of God he knew that nothing can take his life before the time he knew all these things he was certain to him the prophecies he knew what the word says about him was true he says what gave Jesus faith was what the Bible says about him he believed it maybe many times think that you know he had something different he had faith in the word that's it that's why he never used any other power but the word he never used anything else but the word and when he woke up he said in the world you have little faith rebuking them and he spoke to the storm and the waves and everything just came down now if they would have just looked at him and realized but he's he's calm he's relaxed they could also relax they could just sit back and fold their arms and say let's see if this ship ship is gonna see because if this ship goes down he goes down and he can never go down therefore they could have just relaxed and looked upon him steadfast as long as I see him I am confident as long as I see the word I am at peace and that should be our attitude as long as you see the word moving in your life be at peace as long as the word is leading you be at peace because the word can never fail you know who you are accepted act upon it aim a let's bow heads if you want to raise your hand to heaven say Lord remember me this morning I need my courage to increase I need to be a man woman of Valor I need to be able o God to apply these few words this day in my life to overcome
