[38:37] Your comfort, Lord, your care, your
[38:38] guidance, Father. Your word is still the
[38:40] same. And because you are your word, and
[38:42] we're just praying as we open the pages
[38:44] of your scripture, oh God. We, Lord, the
[38:47] prophet said many times that any mortal
[38:49] could open the pages of your Bible, but
[38:51] we need the immortal one. We need the
[38:54] author of the book, Lord. We need you to
[38:55] come down and speak to us out of your
[38:57] word this morning. And Lord, that's what
[39:00] we have come Lord that you would come
[39:01] and mold us and shape us more and more
[39:03] into your image. Oh Lord Jesus. Father
[39:05] may you grant it for your glory. May we
[39:07] leave this place changed.
[39:09] Lord may we leave this place washed.
[39:12] Father may those who are still not
[39:14] believing, may they become believers,
[39:16] Lord.
[39:17] Those who are still battling, may they
[39:19] have the victory.
[39:20] Lord, may those who are not filled with
[39:22] you be filled with you, oh God. and all
[39:24] of us who have been filled with you. May
[39:26] you refill us with your Holy Spirit.
[39:28] Lord, as your prophet said, one baptism
[39:30] but many fillings. Lord, may you grant
[39:32] it for your glory. Lord, we just want to
[39:34] commit the service into your hands. Be
[39:37] with those who are streaming. Lord,
[39:39] those who are sick, who those who are
[39:41] away, Father, be their portion. Father,
[39:44] go into where the room where they are.
[39:45] Lord, you're a God everywhere. Father,
[39:47] you said you never leave us nor forsake
[39:49] us. Whoever your children are, there you
[39:51] are, oh God. So may that you feel be
[39:53] very real where they are, Lord Jesus.
[39:55] And Lord, we just want to pray that the
[39:57] service would leave human control.
[40:00] Father, we we commit the service into
[40:02] your hands. Do what you need to do among
[40:04] us, Lord. May grant it for your glory.
[40:06] We humbly ask these things, Lord. In
[40:09] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[40:12] Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends.
[40:15] Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. It's
[40:18] great to have all the visitors here. God
[40:19] bless you. Trust you feel at home and
[40:21] welcome. Amen. Praise the Lord. God
[40:24] bless you all. Amen. Thank you, brother
[40:27] John.
[40:37] God bless you, friends.
[40:40] Um, if you got your Bibles handy, we're
[40:42] just going to turn straight to the
[40:44] scripture.
[40:47] Just going to go to
[40:50] I want to read a couple of places.
[40:55] I want to start in 1 Corinthians chapter
[40:57] 10.
[41:05] We're going to
[41:08] read verses 12- 14.
[41:14] Amen. Who's happy to be in the house of
[41:15] the Lord this morning?
[41:19] Amen.
[41:22] So 1 Corinthians 10
[41:26] read from verse 12
[41:30] says, "Wherefore let him that thinkketh
[41:32] he standeth take heed lest he fall.
[41:35] There is there hath no temptation taken
[41:38] you. But such is common to man. But God
[41:41] is faithful."
[41:42] Amen.
[41:42] Who will not suffer you to be tempted
[41:43] above that uh you are able? but will
[41:47] with the temptation also make a way of
[41:50] escape that ye may be able to bear it.
[41:53] Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from
[41:57] idolatry.
[41:59] And we're going to go to Luke chapter 6.
[42:19] And verse 44
[42:25] he says, "For every tree is known by his
[42:27] own fruit.
[42:30] For of thorns men do not gather figs,
[42:32] nor of a bramble bush gather they
[42:34] grapes. A good man out of a a good man
[42:38] out of the good treasure of his heart
[42:39] bringeth forth that which is good. And
[42:42] an evil man out of the evil treasure of
[42:44] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[42:46] evil. For for of the abundance of the
[42:49] heart his mouth speaketh. And then he
[42:52] poses a question. Why do you call me why
[42:55] call ye me Lord? Lord and do not do the
[42:58] things which I say. Amen. May the Lord
[43:00] bless his word. You may have your seats
[43:03] now.
[43:06] I want to I want to pose a question and
[43:09] and this this came to me during the
[43:12] week.
[43:14] Where is your heart?
[43:17] Now, it's very interesting when we read
[43:19] there in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 where
[43:21] where Paul is writing to the Corinthians
[43:23] and he begins to talk about, you know,
[43:25] there's no temptation given to you but
[43:27] you're able to bear it and God will make
[43:29] a way of escape. But then he but then he
[43:31] quickly uh it seems like he's changing
[43:34] the subject but he says brethren flee
[43:36] from idolatry. Now idolatry we we think
[43:40] of many times as we think of someone who
[43:42] who has a shrine or they go to a temple
[43:44] and they have something made of wood or
[43:46] gold or you know something that's been
[43:48] fashioned and it's been there and they
[43:50] they bow down and they worship those
[43:52] things. But idols are actually it's in
[43:55] reality what they place before them is
[43:58] actually in their heart already.
[44:00] And it's just a physical manifestation
[44:02] of what's already in them.
[44:04] And we can see this. We just I trust you
[44:06] have your Bibles handy, but I just want
[44:08] to go to uh Leviticus.
[44:11] I wonder if I can find it.
[44:16] I want to go to Exodus chapter 32. In
[44:19] Exodus chapter 32,
[44:22] uh we have the scene of of Israel made
[44:24] the golden calf. And we understand that
[44:26] that image they actually beheld in Egypt
[44:28] because one of the Egyptian gods was a
[44:30] bull. And they wanted something
[44:34] fashioned that was material that was
[44:36] their god. And it's incredible that when
[44:39] the very god that brought them out of
[44:40] Egypt is speaking to his prophet on the
[44:43] mountain, here they are at the bottom of
[44:44] the mountain making a god. But yet their
[44:46] god is declaring himself to their
[44:48] prophet on the mountain. But they could
[44:50] not wait for the correct revelation of
[44:52] the of the word to come to them. So they
[44:54] tell mo uh tell Aaron make us a god that
[44:58] we can worship you know a real something
[45:00] physical. And it's amazing because now
[45:03] in in Exodus 32 and 19 and 20 we have
[45:06] Moses comes down and he sees the scene
[45:08] that's going on and he and he uh well
[45:12] let's just read it. And it says here,
[45:14] "And it came to pass as soon as he came
[45:16] nigh to the camp that he saw the calf
[45:17] and and dancing and Moses anger waxed
[45:20] hot and he cast the tables out of his
[45:22] hand and break them beneath the mount
[45:24] and he took the calf which they had made
[45:26] and burnt it in the fire and ground it
[45:28] to powder and straw it upon the water
[45:31] and made the children of Israel drink of
[45:33] it." And I think this is very
[45:35] interesting because really in reality
[45:37] Moses is really identifying where the
[45:39] calf came from because it came out of
[45:41] the hearts of the people. We want a we
[45:43] want a god that we can worship. It
[45:45] became material. God's prophet came
[45:47] down. He broke the thing, burnt it up,
[45:49] and then he made the people drink it. So
[45:51] the so the idolatry that came out of the
[45:53] people went back into the people.
[45:55] Amen. Cuz that gold, you know, Amen.
[45:56] what was made of made, you know, what
[45:59] was in their hearts became material.
[46:00] That that same material came back into
[46:02] the people
[46:03] because the idolatry because he knew
[46:06] that the blood of bulls and goats could
[46:07] not break idolatry out of a people.
[46:10] Amen. We're still there among Israel and
[46:13] we see it where after Solomon is dead
[46:15] and we have you know the king after him
[46:17] yeah Jeroboam or Riaboam you know
[46:19] there's there's there's a division in
[46:21] the kingdom while yeah a prophet of God
[46:23] comes to this man and says I give you
[46:25] the 10 tribes but in his political
[46:28] understanding he says how can I keep
[46:30] this keep these people from going to
[46:32] Jerusalem to worship and then he devises
[46:34] in his mind because he's been down in
[46:36] Egypt because he fled down there when
[46:38] when Solomon was still king and he and
[46:41] he saw the gods of Egypt. He says, "I'll
[46:43] make two golden calves."
[46:45] And he placed one in Bethl and one in
[46:48] Dan. Now, you may think you're talking
[46:50] about this doesn't apply to us. Oh, yes,
[46:52] it does, friends.
[46:54] Because you must understand that the
[46:56] promised land to us is the word of God.
[46:58] I mean, it's our inheritance in the
[47:00] word. And so, what we have had happen in
[47:03] the past is that there's been people
[47:05] have come and an idol is something
[47:07] that's been fashioned by man's mind.
[47:09] Yeah.
[47:09] Amen. It's it's the imagination of man's
[47:12] heart and it's been fashioned into
[47:13] something material. And you see people
[47:16] in history, they have taken the word and
[47:18] they fashioned it. And it's very easy to
[47:20] say, "Oh, that's that's a Catholic idol
[47:23] or that's a Methodist idol or that's a
[47:25] Baptist idol." But it's all the it
[47:28] started with the word and they fashioned
[47:30] it and they molded it and said, "Here's
[47:32] your God.
[47:33] Here's your Lord Jesus."
[47:35] Now, Friday, you remember how I was a
[47:37] bit what was wrong with me?
[47:39] Yeah, when we had when we had a
[47:40] wonderful time, brother Kenz, this came
[47:42] to me on Thursday. So, I've been
[47:44] pondering these things and maybe you
[47:45] understand how I was. But so people they
[47:50] they they fashion bits of the word and
[47:51] says, "Here's your God." And then you
[47:54] have now he places a golden calf in
[47:57] Bethl and in Dan because one of the one
[48:00] of the insignas of those two tribes,
[48:02] one's the man and one's the eagle.
[48:05] So what people have done is they've
[48:07] taken the word and they've put a golden
[48:09] calf down in the manage part of the word
[48:13] where we have to go back to Isusa
[48:14] street. I'm just going to drop a few
[48:17] bombs if you don't mind me. Amen. So so
[48:19] then people say we have to go back. This
[48:21] is in the ranks of the believers. We
[48:22] have to go back to a former thing and
[48:24] they put an idol there. Then there's
[48:26] other people have come along and they
[48:28] and they've taken the revelation of the
[48:29] word and they fashioned an idol. And I
[48:32] can say that because you look at the
[48:34] result. What's the result of your
[48:36] worship?
[48:37] Is it Jesus Christ coming into you and
[48:39] transforming you or is it just a
[48:40] religion?
[48:41] Because if it's just a religion, you
[48:43] fashion an idol.
[48:44] You fashion an idol out of your religion
[48:46] and it doesn't do you any good. But if
[48:48] you worship the true and living word of
[48:50] God, it'll produce Jesus Christ in you.
[48:52] Amen. So you can see now if this is a
[48:54] bit heavy, I'm sorry. I'm just going to
[48:55] offload and then I'll be happy cuz the
[48:57] burden of my heart's been delivered.
[48:59] Lord.
[49:00] Amen. So now, so people have taken, you
[49:02] know, people have taken truth and
[49:04] they've ran with it and they fashioned
[49:06] idols out of it and people have, you
[49:08] know, following some other ministry,
[49:10] some other man after the prophet. And
[49:12] then then they become disappointed.
[49:14] What's happened? An idol was fashioned
[49:16] in the word.
[49:18] Amen. An idol was fashioned.
[49:20] But thanks be to God, those things have
[49:21] come to an end.
[49:22] Amen.
[49:23] Amen. Because remember, true worship is
[49:25] in one place. God said, "I'll put my
[49:28] name in a in a gate and you'll worship
[49:30] me there."
[49:31] Amen. And that's when you really get
[49:32] into Christ.
[49:33] Yes.
[49:33] That is the true place to worship. Just
[49:35] like Jerusalem in the Old Testament.
[49:37] Amen.
[49:38] Amen.
[49:38] Amen. So now an idol,
[49:42] an idol, if I want to find the
[49:45] definition because it's quite a
[49:47] very interesting thing because
[49:52] the word idol actually means a vain
[49:54] thing.
[49:56] It means good for nothing.
[49:59] The word idols good for nothing by
[50:02] analogy vain or vanity.
[50:05] So it's a thing of not of no value. And
[50:08] people will take something. Now I'm just
[50:11] going to go from religion. I'm going to
[50:12] all because we're going to read
[50:12] something in Ezekiel and it so struck me
[50:15] when God put this on my heart because
[50:17] people will take something of no value
[50:20] and they'll worship it.
[50:22] Yeah. And we know in the Old Testament
[50:24] they had groves, they had idols. And a
[50:27] grove is an established thing. You know,
[50:30] there's, you know, there's trees have
[50:31] been planted. You know, it's been
[50:32] arranged. It's been there for some time.
[50:34] You know, the high places in Israel and
[50:36] all these things. And so, people can
[50:38] take something, it's not just a
[50:40] religion. It could be something that
[50:42] happens to you,
[50:43] something that happens to you in your
[50:45] life. And people can make that an idol
[50:48] and they can worship God or their whole
[50:51] life can be dictated to by one event in
[50:54] their life,
[50:55] but they're not willing to hew that idol
[50:57] down
[50:58] and walk with God.
[51:00] Christine knew a man when she was
[51:01] growing up, he was going to church. And
[51:04] he was so bitter against his especially
[51:06] his mom. So bitter against his mom. He
[51:09] said, "I'll never get married and have
[51:11] children because it'll make her happy."
[51:13] And the Lord spoke through Christine's
[51:15] mom to this man and says, "You you got
[51:17] to you cannot worship the idol of a
[51:19] broken heart."
[51:20] So his whole life, this is where this is
[51:23] basically the end of my sermon. I'm just
[51:24] going to drop it to you now till you
[51:25] know where I'm going. But his whole life
[51:27] was dictated to because he was
[51:29] worshiping whatever happened between him
[51:32] and his mom.
[51:34] That became an idol.
[51:36] Cuz his whole life, you see people, you
[51:38] know, Catholic, whatever religion, they
[51:41] have idols. They have, you know, they go
[51:43] on pilgrimages. They can live any kind
[51:45] of way. Then they come into the presence
[51:46] of their idol. They go into their
[51:48] church. They go and do whatever they do.
[51:50] Very reverent. Their whole demeanor and
[51:52] everything changes.
[51:54] Amen. Because their life is being
[51:56] dictated to by a piece of wood or a
[51:59] piece of stone or a piece of gold.
[52:00] That's just a vanity.
[52:02] And it's the same thing with you and I,
[52:04] friends. You don't want to make things
[52:05] that happen. Remember, everything in
[52:07] life will make you better or bitter. it.
[52:10] But it's up to you what you want it to
[52:12] do to you.
[52:13] Hallelujah.
[52:14] Amen. That man unfortunately made it
[52:16] bitter.
[52:17] And he robbed himself of really what
[52:19] life wanted to give him.
[52:21] And after that, he didn't he he after a
[52:24] few while he stopped coming to church.
[52:26] Never saw him again
[52:28] in church. Is that right?
[52:30] Yeah. Why? Because he wasn't willing.
[52:32] God put his finger on it.
[52:34] You cannot worship the idol of a broken
[52:37] heart.
[52:38] That was God speaking to that man.
[52:41] But then he but then it's up to us. Can
[52:44] we are we willing to let God destroy it?
[52:48] Amen.
[52:51] Now, so an idol is a vain thing.
[52:56] The prophet tells us, "And be certain of
[52:58] God,
[53:00] but all that you put before God is an
[53:02] idol.
[53:04] Let it be whatever it may be. Even so,
[53:06] Satan, our great adversary, is such a
[53:09] smart one until he even puts sometimes
[53:12] the church before God. You might have a
[53:15] great church, you might have a great
[53:16] building, or it might be a great
[53:18] denomination. And again, it might be a
[53:20] great congregation, but let nothing come
[53:23] before God in your heart.
[53:27] Anything before God is an idol. And
[53:29] these people knew that they wasn't
[53:32] spiritual like they used to be under the
[53:34] reigns of the other kings. They thought
[53:37] uh just because they was a religious
[53:38] nation that everything would be all
[53:42] right.
[53:44] And many times we say, you know, you
[53:45] hear the prophet say, "Israel says, I'm
[53:47] a circumcised Jew. I'm in the promised
[53:49] land. God's a good God. He'll never
[53:51] drive us out of the land." And you know,
[53:53] you see Jeremiah the weeping prophet
[53:55] trying to swing the people back to God.
[53:57] All the prophets saying, "Turn from your
[54:00] idols. Turn from your worship of of vain
[54:02] things." And he would, you know, they
[54:04] would blast these things out because
[54:05] this is the heart of God coming to the
[54:07] people. I want to walk with you. I want
[54:09] to have fellowship with you. I gathered
[54:11] you out of Egypt so I could be your God
[54:13] and you'd be my people.
[54:15] But the people were, you know, they
[54:16] weren't they weren't too interested in
[54:18] those things, you know. Oh, we don't
[54:20] need to change cuz God is a good God.
[54:22] God is a God of love and he is a God of
[54:24] love.
[54:25] God, you know, he looks after us. We're
[54:27] in the promised land. We're his promised
[54:29] people. But they weren't. They took
[54:32] those things for granted.
[54:34] They took it for granted and they
[54:36] weren't willing to actually turn from
[54:38] their wickedness and turn back to the
[54:39] living God. And God told them through
[54:42] Moses, you know, if you do these things,
[54:45] if you worship the gods of the other
[54:46] nations, you'll be scattered out of this
[54:48] land. And God is a God of his word.
[54:51] And the reason they were scattered out
[54:53] of the land is because they had not just
[54:55] idols there in the hills and the high
[54:56] places. There was idols in their hearts.
[54:59] Yes,
[54:59] they had fashioned a form of worship
[55:01] after their own device and they made
[55:03] that an idol.
[55:04] And so because their heart was turned
[55:06] away from God to an idol, that what
[55:09] that's what caused them to leave the
[55:10] land.
[55:11] Amen.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:13] We're here. Oh, we're believers.
[55:16] We're going in a rapture. We're God's
[55:18] chosen people. Amen.
[55:20] Absolutely. God called you under this
[55:22] message because you're the bride of
[55:24] Christ. But friends, don't take it for
[55:26] granted because if you if you fashion
[55:29] this word after your own device, you're
[55:31] not worshiping the God of the Bible
[55:33] anymore. You're worshiping your own
[55:35] Jesus.
[55:36] Amen. And he'll cause you to go into
[55:38] Babylon.
[55:39] Amen. I'm just going to deliver what's
[55:41] on my heart. Forgive me. You say, "Oh,
[55:43] is it normally this way?" No, it's not
[55:44] always this way. But you got to we got
[55:46] to take it for don't take it for
[55:48] granted. God called me.
[55:50] God brought me to a new land.
[55:52] Amen. Baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[55:54] Hallelujah.
[55:55] God met me and transformed my life. But
[55:57] yet, the enemy will always try and come
[55:58] in. We're in a battle, friends.
[56:00] Hallelujah. But the captain of the host
[56:02] is Jesus.
[56:03] Amen. So, we have nothing to fear in
[56:05] this world in this world above or
[56:07] beneath or any part of a realm. Amen. If
[56:09] you walk with him, remember brother Kyre
[56:12] said in one of his sermons at camp, it
[56:13] so struck with me. If you dedicate your
[56:15] life to God, he'll dedicate his life to
[56:17] you.
[56:18] Amen.
[56:18] Hallelujah.
[56:20] Amen. And God never comes up. I can't
[56:22] help you. I'm sorry. Yeah. I just can't
[56:24] do it. He always backs up his people if
[56:26] they stand upon his word.
[56:28] Amen.
[56:29] Hallelujah.
[56:30] That's why we have such a great I'm so
[56:32] thankful we have a true and living God.
[56:35] Amen.
[56:35] Amen.
[56:37] Now,
[56:40] so they took it for granted. We can take
[56:42] it for granted.
[56:44] We don't want to take it for granted.
[56:45] Remember, we're not living in fear. Oh,
[56:48] help me, Lord. I'm in this world. I'm in
[56:49] Satan's Eden. He knew you'd be in
[56:51] Satan's Eden.
[56:52] Amen. But remember Adam and Eve, they
[56:54] failed in Satan's Eden. But the prophet
[56:56] said, "This bride is ordained not to
[56:58] fall."
[56:59] Amen. So we can be in the wickedest age,
[57:01] in the darkest of times. But because God
[57:03] is among us, God is in us, we can walk
[57:05] victorious through this world.
[57:07] Amen.
[57:07] Hallelujah. We have a power. There's a
[57:10] power that's been released into his
[57:11] bride that'll overcome all things.
[57:13] Amen.
[57:14] Amen. We have that power. We're not
[57:16] looking for it to come. It's already
[57:17] here. God's opened his word. You know,
[57:20] people look at you and say, "Why are you
[57:21] so different? It's not rules and
[57:23] regulations and conformity or culture or
[57:26] none of that kind of stuff. It's God.
[57:28] Hallelujah. It's not within man to seek
[57:31] after God. But yet God put something in
[57:33] you before the foundation of the world
[57:35] and you heard his word one day and you
[57:36] said, "Yes, Lord. I don't care if my
[57:38] family doesn't go. I don't care if my
[57:40] country doesn't go. I don't care
[57:42] wherever anyone goes. I'm walking with
[57:44] you."
[57:45] Hallelujah. So, we have a power. It's
[57:47] not your humanity. It's the deity in
[57:48] you.
[57:49] I trust he's in you. That overcoming
[57:51] power. Amen.
[57:52] Amen. If he's not in you by the yo now
[57:54] you say fill me Lord
[57:56] lay it all down at his feet. It just
[57:58] takes a total surrender.
[58:00] Amen. Doesn't take a bunch of hours and
[58:02] weeping and crying though that is good.
[58:04] It just takes a surrender.
[58:05] Say God bring me to that place
[58:08] if you're not at that place
[58:11] now. So
[58:15] the idea, Satan's agenda,
[58:19] and I'm kind of going over things from
[58:21] camp, but I just want to put it a
[58:22] different kind of way. Satan's agenda is
[58:25] to take you, take your heart and remove
[58:29] it from where it's meant to be.
[58:31] And number one, that is from God.
[58:34] That is his agenda. That's why this
[58:36] world is built the way it is. That's why
[58:38] society is made the way it is because he
[58:41] wants to take your heart and he wants to
[58:43] have you chasing other things.
[58:44] He wants to anoint your imagination. And
[58:47] then if you agree with that imagination,
[58:49] you'll see your heart begin to drift.
[58:51] True.
[58:52] All right. And we can see this in
[58:54] Genesis chapter 3 when the serpent comes
[58:56] to Eve where the serpent begins to paint
[59:00] a picture to Eve and says of you for one
[59:04] he says God he says you won't surely
[59:07] die. God's a good God. You won't be
[59:10] punished. Nothing will go wrong. You
[59:13] can't die. And then then then the
[59:16] serpent paints a picture in front of Eve
[59:18] and says, "For God doth know that in the
[59:21] day you eat thereof, then your eyes
[59:23] shall be opened and you shall be as
[59:25] gods, knowing good and evil." So go into
[59:29] your imagination, you'll be like this.
[59:32] It'll be better if you do this. Just try
[59:35] this. God's don't worry about whatever
[59:37] consequences God told you. He didn't
[59:39] really mean those things. Just have
[59:41] this. And then her imagine and then her
[59:44] heart be to drift from where it was. And
[59:46] then she began to desire. Amen. And then
[59:49] here we are in this condition
[59:52] because Satan worked on her heart to get
[59:54] her heart away from where it should have
[59:55] been
[59:56] by using her imagination.
[59:58] Yes.
[59:59] Amen. You following me? And that is the
[1:00:02] same thing that is the same thing the
[1:00:06] devil will do to us today. And he'll
[1:00:10] take
[1:00:11] he will anoint your imagination. Just
[1:00:13] you take husband and wife. God ordained
[1:00:16] that we'd be one.
[1:00:18] Amen. You and your spouse are one.
[1:00:21] But if he will try and come in and you
[1:00:23] can be living in the same home, you can
[1:00:25] be sleeping in the same bed. You can be
[1:00:27] living the same kind of life. But if he
[1:00:29] can get your heart to drift,
[1:00:32] remember because where your heart is,
[1:00:34] you know, that's where your treasures
[1:00:35] are.
[1:00:37] Amen. Remember, he tries to make
[1:00:38] something an idol. So, he can make
[1:00:41] someone he can take someone of the
[1:00:43] opposite sex and make them an idol to
[1:00:45] you.
[1:00:46] You can just It's going to start with
[1:00:47] just a little infactuation.
[1:00:50] Amen.
[1:00:51] And then what happens? You're still
[1:00:52] living in the same house. But when you
[1:00:54] see that person, oh, remember when the
[1:00:58] people saw their idols, they act
[1:00:59] different.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:02] And now here I am. Here we are. How are
[1:01:03] you today?
[1:01:04] Amen. This is like your address. I trust
[1:01:06] cuz we're all flesh and blood.
[1:01:09] Amen. So he'll take he'll take someone
[1:01:11] and it could be someone in church. So
[1:01:12] wherever it doesn't matter. And if he
[1:01:15] can get you infactuated with that
[1:01:16] person, where's your heart gone?
[1:01:20] Where's your heart gone?
[1:01:22] It's not with your spouse where it
[1:01:24] should be.
[1:01:25] It's now chasing something that you know
[1:01:28] you cannot have and you know you should
[1:01:30] not have. But yet, you know, many times
[1:01:34] in
[1:01:36] there's such a thing as as actually
[1:01:38] living in adultery, but it's an
[1:01:40] emotional thing.
[1:01:42] Amen.
[1:01:43] There's such a thing as that you can be
[1:01:45] married, you say, "I've never done
[1:01:46] anything against my spouse, but
[1:01:47] emotionally you can be connected to
[1:01:49] someone else."
[1:01:50] And in reality, you're really more
[1:01:52] united with them than you are with your
[1:01:54] spouse.
[1:01:54] What's happened? Your heart has
[1:01:56] wandered.
[1:01:57] Why is that? An idol.
[1:02:00] Amen. An idol is there.
[1:02:03] And I promise you one thing. If you're
[1:02:06] willing to continue to go down that
[1:02:07] road, just like just like Israel, you
[1:02:11] you'll end up in the world.
[1:02:13] Amen.
[1:02:15] And it's actually not God's doing, it's
[1:02:18] your doing.
[1:02:20] Amen. Because it there's always
[1:02:21] temptation in things, but it's it's what
[1:02:25] are you willing to what are you willing
[1:02:28] to actually you let God destroy it
[1:02:30] or you just or you just oh let's make it
[1:02:32] a grove. It's really not that bad.
[1:02:34] They're a Christian as well. We connect
[1:02:36] on such a great level.
[1:02:38] Amen. Hey, friendship is there. But you
[1:02:41] understand?
[1:02:42] You should be best friends with your
[1:02:43] spouse.
[1:02:45] Amen. You should be best friends with
[1:02:47] your spouse. If they're not your best
[1:02:48] friend, you need to work on something.
[1:02:50] You say, "Lord, where's my heart gone?"
[1:02:58] Now,
[1:03:01] let's go to
[1:03:04] let's go to Ezekiel chapter 14.
[1:03:10] This is really where this stemmed from.
[1:03:16] It's amazing.
[1:03:29] Ezekiel 14 verse1.
[1:03:37] Now the chapter before this,
[1:03:40] the Lord speaks through Ezekiel and
[1:03:41] speaks against false prophets.
[1:03:46] And so now
[1:03:48] there's people that are gathering to the
[1:03:51] true prophet in the land.
[1:03:56] Now the the prophet represents the word
[1:03:59] for the age.
[1:04:01] Yeah.
[1:04:02] Paul said a dispensation of the gospel
[1:04:04] has been given to me. And so his life so
[1:04:08] the the vast majority of the New
[1:04:10] Testament that dispensation was
[1:04:11] committed to him. And so he was the word
[1:04:14] of word of the god, word of the lord to
[1:04:16] the people.
[1:04:17] And so when you read this about these
[1:04:19] men coming to Ezekiel, they're coming to
[1:04:21] the word which is Christ. They're not
[1:04:23] coming to the man. Amen. They're coming
[1:04:25] to the office
[1:04:27] in the man. And so now here's people and
[1:04:30] they're coming to the they're rallying
[1:04:32] around the true prophet of the day. But
[1:04:35] let's see what happens. Then came
[1:04:38] certain of the elders of Israel unto me
[1:04:40] and sat before me. And the word of the
[1:04:43] Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
[1:04:46] these men have set up their idols in
[1:04:48] their heart, and put the stumbling block
[1:04:51] of their iniquity before their face.
[1:04:53] Should I be inquired of at all by them?
[1:04:57] Therefore speak unto them and say unto
[1:05:00] them, thus sayeth the Lord God, every
[1:05:02] man of the house of Israel that setth up
[1:05:05] his idols in his heart, and putteth the
[1:05:07] stumbling block of his iniquity before
[1:05:09] his face, and cometh to the prophet, I
[1:05:12] the Lord will answer him that cometh
[1:05:14] cons according to the multitude of his
[1:05:17] idols.
[1:05:19] Amen. So here's people, here's
[1:05:20] believers. They're coming to the word.
[1:05:23] They're looking for an answer. They're
[1:05:25] looking for something in the word, but
[1:05:27] because of the idols in their heart and
[1:05:28] the iniquity that remember iniquity is
[1:05:31] to know better but do the wrong.
[1:05:34] That's what iniquity is. So you know
[1:05:36] better but you do the wrong anyway.
[1:05:37] That's iniquity.
[1:05:40] And Jesus spake in this day that many
[1:05:42] will come to me in this day and say,
[1:05:43] "Lord, Lord, have we not cast out
[1:05:45] devils, healed the sick, raised the
[1:05:46] dead, done many mighty things, and say,
[1:05:48] depart from me, ye that workketh
[1:05:50] iniquity. I never knew you." There's
[1:05:53] people that are going to fulfill that
[1:05:54] scripture whether we like it or not.
[1:05:56] So there is possible because I know I'm
[1:05:59] reading a lot of Old Testament, but you
[1:06:01] got to understand this is the same in
[1:06:02] the New Testament because man man in the
[1:06:04] Old Testament is the same man in the New
[1:06:06] Testament.
[1:06:07] Amen. It's just that God has released a
[1:06:09] power through the blood
[1:06:10] through his word that we can live above
[1:06:12] sin and live above these things.
[1:06:15] Now,
[1:06:18] so
[1:06:19] where were we? Verse five. that I may
[1:06:22] take the house of Israel in their in
[1:06:24] their own heart because they are all
[1:06:27] estranged estranged from me through
[1:06:30] their idols. Now this word estrained it
[1:06:33] means to turn aside
[1:06:36] especially for lodging. So it's to turn
[1:06:38] aside to find a place to live or stay.
[1:06:41] Hence to be a foreigner to be profane
[1:06:45] and it actually means to commit
[1:06:47] adultery.
[1:06:51] And that is the meaning of this word
[1:06:53] estrained.
[1:06:54] So because the idols that they had
[1:06:56] formed, they had formed them. They had
[1:06:59] formed them. Now I know this is awful
[1:07:01] heavy, but just bear with me because I
[1:07:02] really want this to sink deep.
[1:07:05] Okay? Now because they had formed these
[1:07:08] idols in their hearts, it had caused
[1:07:10] them to be their heart to go from where
[1:07:12] God wanted them to be. And it had caused
[1:07:15] them to look see where your heart is,
[1:07:18] that's where your treasure is. That's
[1:07:20] where your comfort will be. That's
[1:07:22] that's really your religion.
[1:07:25] Amen.
[1:07:26] What your your core being is wherever
[1:07:28] your comfort is.
[1:07:30] That's right.
[1:07:30] Amen. And it doesn't matter if it's, oh,
[1:07:32] you say, well, I believe the message and
[1:07:34] praise the Lord, God sent a prophet and
[1:07:36] the seals are open and God is, you know,
[1:07:38] the thunders have been revealed and, you
[1:07:40] know, we're going in a rapture and we're
[1:07:42] at, you know, on the cusp of the body
[1:07:43] changed and all these things, but
[1:07:45] where's your comfort?
[1:07:47] Amen. Where's your comfort?
[1:07:49] Amen.
[1:07:49] Is it in the word of God? Is it in
[1:07:52] Christ?
[1:07:53] Who is it? Who is his word? Or is it in
[1:07:55] something else?
[1:07:57] Amen.
[1:07:58] I just want you to think about these
[1:07:59] things.
[1:08:01] Because
[1:08:03] if if you have an idol, if there's
[1:08:06] something in your heart like this, it
[1:08:08] will cause you to be estra from God,
[1:08:12] cause you to wander,
[1:08:14] and God will answer you according to the
[1:08:18] idol in your heart.
[1:08:20] That's what we just read. He will answer
[1:08:21] you. So you see people just say someone
[1:08:24] is has been a woman beater, a husband
[1:08:26] that has been real real real real hard
[1:08:29] on his hard on his wife and then because
[1:08:32] that is in him and then he hears and
[1:08:34] then when he hears the prophet he'll
[1:08:36] hear you know woman should be in their
[1:08:38] place the man's the head of the home and
[1:08:39] all these different things and he'll say
[1:08:41] amen.
[1:08:42] Remember God remember God has positions
[1:08:44] in the family
[1:08:46] but because of that idol he'll just hear
[1:08:48] that
[1:08:49] and he won't hear really what the man
[1:08:51] should be that the man is meant to be
[1:08:54] Christ in flesh to his family and the
[1:08:56] plan of redemption as Christ lifted us
[1:08:58] out of the world. Amen. To be coairs
[1:09:00] with him the husband should be his whole
[1:09:03] being should be I want to lift my family
[1:09:04] up.
[1:09:05] Amen. That the plan of redemption will
[1:09:07] be lived out through me to my family.
[1:09:09] Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] That is what the message produces. Amen.
[1:09:12] Amen. But if they have that idol,
[1:09:14] they'll they'll they'll put more
[1:09:15] pressure on their family and woman, you
[1:09:16] better line up and you know, this is
[1:09:18] what the prophet said. We're believers.
[1:09:20] Believers accept the word.
[1:09:24] But all they hear is through that idol.
[1:09:28] Amen. And you can take it through, oh,
[1:09:29] God is love and grace. That can become
[1:09:32] an idol because he's not just love and
[1:09:34] grace. Now, when I first heard this
[1:09:36] message, that's all I heard was divine
[1:09:37] love.
[1:09:38] I wasn't at a church. I just had the
[1:09:40] tapes. And God took me from being a
[1:09:42] drunk home brerew making university
[1:09:44] student that wore shorts and did all
[1:09:46] kinds of things that loved the world and
[1:09:48] partied whatever more. And he
[1:09:49] transformed me by his grace. And he led
[1:09:52] me through those things. No one said now
[1:09:54] you got to do this and this and this and
[1:09:55] this and stop doing that. It was God.
[1:09:58] When the spirit of truth has come, he'll
[1:09:59] lead you and guide you into all truth.
[1:10:02] Amen. And and from that day till now,
[1:10:04] that's how I see this world.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] Amen. So, but then if but you can make
[1:10:11] and and and and the church world has
[1:10:14] made God is love and God loves you as an
[1:10:17] idol
[1:10:18] because they taken part of the word and
[1:10:20] they're fashioned into their the image
[1:10:21] of their liking and they prostrate
[1:10:23] themselves in front of it.
[1:10:25] I trust this doesn't offend anyone but
[1:10:28] it's true.
[1:10:29] And so now God is love, but he's also a
[1:10:32] father.
[1:10:34] And if a father loves his kids, he'll
[1:10:35] correct them. And the correction is not
[1:10:38] just to punish them, but he has their
[1:10:40] best interest in mind. Don't go this
[1:10:42] way, honey. Go this way. This is the way
[1:10:44] you should walk.
[1:10:46] Amen. So
[1:10:48] if people have that in their heart when
[1:10:51] they hear brother Brown, that's all
[1:10:52] they'll hear. Well, how can that be?
[1:10:54] Because there's an idol. There's an
[1:10:56] iniquity in them. And they hear the word
[1:10:59] through only that channel.
[1:11:02] See, it takes the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:04] Amen. God has to get rid of those things
[1:11:07] that you hear the message in the spirit
[1:11:09] it's given.
[1:11:11] Amen. It's not just all pet doctrine and
[1:11:13] different kinds of things and you know
[1:11:15] but you hear it in it how it's in its
[1:11:17] purity.
[1:11:18] That's right.
[1:11:20] Because God will answer you. I've met
[1:11:22] people brother said this and this is how
[1:11:24] it should be and this is how it should
[1:11:26] be and they're hard starchy no love you
[1:11:31] know indifferent really. All they want
[1:11:32] to prove is they're right and you're
[1:11:34] wrong. Yes.
[1:11:35] And they have all the quotes to support
[1:11:36] what they're saying.
[1:11:38] I'll say this. There's an idol in there.
[1:11:41] And when they're looking for what they
[1:11:43] want to hear and then now here it is.
[1:11:47] God help us.
[1:11:49] Because without God, without a real
[1:11:52] surrender,
[1:11:53] I mean, without really giving your all.
[1:11:56] That's why people, they can walk with
[1:11:57] God, but because they have some kind of
[1:11:59] reputation and I've been in the message
[1:12:01] this long and this is what I've done and
[1:12:02] maybe, oh, I'm a pastor. or I'm a song
[1:12:05] leader or I'm a I'm a minister or you
[1:12:07] know whatever part of the church.
[1:12:09] They're not willing to be put on the
[1:12:10] wheel
[1:12:11] cuz what will people think of me?
[1:12:15] Hello.
[1:12:16] What will people think of me? Who cares
[1:12:18] what people think?
[1:12:20] What does God say?
[1:12:21] Who's going to say well done to my good
[1:12:23] and faithful servant? It's not me.
[1:12:25] It'll be the almighty God.
[1:12:28] Hallelujah. I'm so glad he's going to
[1:12:29] we're going to hear those words one of
[1:12:30] these days. My good and faithful
[1:12:32] servant, enter into the joys of the
[1:12:34] Lord.
[1:12:36] You say, "Well, how do you know I'm
[1:12:38] going to hear those words?" If God's
[1:12:40] word has spoken to your heart,
[1:12:42] and he's changed you, you can look back.
[1:12:44] I'm no longer the person I once was. And
[1:12:46] God has transformed me into the person I
[1:12:48] am, and he's still molding. If he has
[1:12:50] received you in this world, he's going
[1:12:52] to receive you in the next world.
[1:12:53] Hallelujah. We have that assurance. It's
[1:12:55] not, oh, is he going to say it to me? Of
[1:12:57] course, he's going to say it to you. If
[1:12:59] you fully surrendered to him now, he's
[1:13:01] not going to say, "Who are you?"
[1:13:02] He's not going to say, "You worker of
[1:13:04] iniquity."
[1:13:05] He can't say that to if you've
[1:13:06] surrendered your all and say, "Lord, not
[1:13:08] my will, but thy will be done."
[1:13:10] Hallelujah.
[1:13:11] Glor.
[1:13:14] Now
[1:13:16] verse six. Therefore say unto the house
[1:13:19] of Israel, thus sayith the Lord God,
[1:13:22] repent and turn yourselves from your
[1:13:23] idols, and turn away your faces from
[1:13:26] your all your abominations. For every
[1:13:28] one of the house of Israel, or the
[1:13:30] stranger that sojurnneth in Israel,
[1:13:33] which separateth himself from me, and
[1:13:35] setth up his idols in his heart, and
[1:13:37] putth the stumbling blockers of iniquity
[1:13:39] before his face, and cometh to a and
[1:13:42] cometh to a prophet to inquire of him
[1:13:44] concerning me. I the Lord will answer
[1:13:47] him by myself and I'll set my face
[1:13:49] against that man and will make him a
[1:13:51] sign and a proverb and I'll cut him off
[1:13:53] from the midst of my people and ye shall
[1:13:56] know that I am the Lord.
[1:13:59] Amen.
[1:14:01] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:14:03] today and forever.
[1:14:04] Amen.
[1:14:05] Man is still the same as well.
[1:14:08] Amen. So
[1:14:10] that is you cannot just like that man I
[1:14:13] said he let his relationship with his
[1:14:17] mom stop his whole life and he was
[1:14:20] worshiping that broken heart that he
[1:14:21] had.
[1:14:23] Amen. You cannot you cannot let anything
[1:14:27] hinder your walk with God.
[1:14:29] Why does God put a finger on things?
[1:14:31] Because he wants you to be free.
[1:14:33] Amen. Why does God say cut down the
[1:14:35] idols?
[1:14:37] because he wants you to be free.
[1:14:39] And it's actually him that actually hues
[1:14:41] down things.
[1:14:42] It's not your own ability to say, "I'm
[1:14:44] going to turn a new leaf and I'm going
[1:14:45] to Why do New Year's resolutions fail?"
[1:14:47] Because it's man says, "I'm going to I'm
[1:14:49] going to I'm going to I'm going to" And
[1:14:50] it's and then it's like, "I need to do
[1:14:52] it again the next year." And it becomes
[1:14:53] a tradition.
[1:14:55] Oh, what are you going to What's your
[1:14:56] New Year's resolution this year? Oh, I'm
[1:14:59] probably this I'm going to do such and
[1:15:01] such. You said that 10 years ago. Well,
[1:15:04] I'm still working on it. What's the
[1:15:06] problem? There's the eye in the picture.
[1:15:09] Amen. There's not God.
[1:15:11] Amen. Brother Bram says in doors and a
[1:15:13] door. He says, "Open the door
[1:15:15] of the heart. Let him come in and he'll
[1:15:17] do it."
[1:15:18] That is the only way it can be done.
[1:15:22] Now you say, "Well, this is awfully kind
[1:15:24] of negative today." It's not.
[1:15:27] Amen.
[1:15:28] Because you must understand.
[1:15:31] Now, I just want to read one scripture
[1:15:32] first in Isaiah 29:13. And I'll read it
[1:15:34] quickly for you. He says, "Wherefore the
[1:15:36] Lord saith, for as much as this people
[1:15:38] draw near me with their mouth, and with
[1:15:41] their lips do honor me, but have removed
[1:15:43] their heart far from me, and their fear
[1:15:46] towards me is taught by the precept of
[1:15:49] men." So it's just it became because
[1:15:53] their heart they said, "Yes, we believe.
[1:15:55] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. We, you
[1:15:56] know, we love it. We love you, Lord."
[1:15:58] But their heart has become restrained.
[1:16:01] They're strained by idols.
[1:16:04] And the fear now remember fear in the
[1:16:06] Bible is not always a terror. It's a
[1:16:08] it's a reverential fear.
[1:16:10] It's a respect.
[1:16:12] Amen. That's what a lot fear is many
[1:16:14] times. But he says that because their
[1:16:17] hearts are far from me, the fear of the
[1:16:19] Lord is just a precept of men. So it's
[1:16:21] just taught mentally.
[1:16:24] Amen. There's no reality because you got
[1:16:26] to understand when many times we we pray
[1:16:28] or we have church and you just feel such
[1:16:30] a great blessed atmosphere and it's so
[1:16:33] wonderful and the prophet says many
[1:16:35] times that's just the blessings of God.
[1:16:37] But to come into the presence real
[1:16:39] prince of God it's a fearful thing.
[1:16:41] That's why every time an angel comes to
[1:16:43] someone in the Bible says fear not. And
[1:16:45] when the angel of the Lord came down to
[1:16:46] brother Bram he said many times fear
[1:16:48] not. And he said to brother Biscll there
[1:16:50] in the car when the angel lord came into
[1:16:52] the car and and then and then brother
[1:16:54] Bisll looked at brother Baram and his
[1:16:55] cuz they had been hunting for over a
[1:16:57] week and his and his hadn't shaved and
[1:16:59] his bed was sticking out and then
[1:17:00] brother Bisll said he looked like he was
[1:17:02] nearly going to die
[1:17:05] and and then brother said 10,000 times
[1:17:07] 10,000 he's come to me it's always the
[1:17:09] same like I could just die
[1:17:12] and he was a man who lived in that
[1:17:13] presence and it was a fearful thing.
[1:17:17] Amen. And that is the God that is the
[1:17:19] God we serve.
[1:17:21] Amen. So for him, it wasn't a precept of
[1:17:23] men to fear the Lord. It was a reality.
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:26] Amen. And I trust if your heart is close
[1:17:29] to God, you'll have a real godly fear.
[1:17:32] Amen. Not a terror now, but you'll have
[1:17:34] a real reverence and love for him.
[1:17:36] Amen.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah.
[1:17:40] You say, "Well, this is awfully
[1:17:42] negative."
[1:17:43] But I want you to understand
[1:17:46] we have a promise.
[1:17:49] That's the book of Malachi.
[1:17:52] Now if your heart is weward,
[1:17:56] we have a promise.
[1:17:58] Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:18:00] before the coming of the great dutiful
[1:18:01] day of the Lord. It's happened.
[1:18:04] And he shall turn the heart of the
[1:18:06] fathers to the children and the heart of
[1:18:08] the children to their fathers. Last I
[1:18:10] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[1:18:13] the the purpose of God sending Elijah is
[1:18:16] to always turn the hearts of the people.
[1:18:18] He says it now in first kings when
[1:18:21] they're on Mount Carmel and Elijah's,
[1:18:24] you know, it's amazing because Ba, you
[1:18:26] know, the prophets of Baal, they built
[1:18:28] their altar, they put their sacrifice
[1:18:30] on, then they have their church service
[1:18:33] around and they dance and they sing and
[1:18:34] they cut themselves and you know, and
[1:18:37] then it says that Elijah rebuilt or
[1:18:40] repaired the altar of the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:42] So the altar was there.
[1:18:44] It was there but it had fallen down.
[1:18:47] Yes.
[1:18:47] And through Christianity, what's
[1:18:49] happened? The real altar, you see, you
[1:18:52] know, people failed to understand
[1:18:54] there's been a restoration.
[1:18:56] The the reason that it was called the
[1:18:57] dark ages wasn't because there's all the
[1:18:59] black death and all the killing and
[1:19:00] stuff. Is because the light of the word
[1:19:04] was blackened out.
[1:19:05] That's why it was called the dark ages.
[1:19:07] And so, but it had to go from dark ages
[1:19:10] back into a full restoration. But during
[1:19:12] the dark ages, the altar of the Lord
[1:19:14] fell down. It fell into disrepair
[1:19:18] because they made man-made altars.
[1:19:20] Amen. They made man way man-made
[1:19:22] approach to God. Just like building an
[1:19:24] idol because people who go to idols,
[1:19:26] they believe their God is going to speak
[1:19:28] to them out of that idol. And when they
[1:19:31] and and when they, you know, give an
[1:19:33] offering to that idol, they're not
[1:19:34] giving it to the literal statue. you to
[1:19:36] give it to the God that that idol
[1:19:37] represents.
[1:19:38] Yes.
[1:19:38] Amen. So, it was a time of dark ages and
[1:19:42] the altar of the Lord fell down.
[1:19:45] And so, God had to send an Elijah at the
[1:19:47] end time
[1:19:48] because an altar, remember an altar is
[1:19:50] now your you place your sacrifice upon
[1:19:52] the altar and then God receives the
[1:19:55] sacrifice.
[1:19:56] So, you need to have the right kind of
[1:19:58] approach.
[1:19:59] Are you following me?
[1:20:01] Amen. You've got to have an approach
[1:20:03] according to the word. Yes.
[1:20:05] If it's not according to the word, you
[1:20:07] made the wrong approach.
[1:20:09] That's why, you know, you see, like
[1:20:12] Jesus said, enter in at the straight
[1:20:14] gate. Matthew chapter 7, that word is s
[1:20:16] t r a i t.
[1:20:18] Not straight as in straight line, but a
[1:20:20] straight as in a narrow passage of water
[1:20:22] like the cook straight or the fobbo
[1:20:24] straight or to straight or wherever. And
[1:20:26] so he's saying, "Enter ye in at the
[1:20:28] straight gate." And the water is the
[1:20:31] gate. Repent and be baptized name of the
[1:20:33] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:34] Amen. for the remission s you shall
[1:20:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:20:37] baptism is the gate. That is the
[1:20:39] approach to repent, turn, follow God,
[1:20:42] and you go in the gate.
[1:20:44] Amen.
[1:20:45] And so, but then people say, "No, that's
[1:20:47] rubbish." You know, we baptize in the
[1:20:50] titles, you know, Matthew 28:19, that's
[1:20:52] the that's that's Jesus' literal word,
[1:20:54] and we'll take it above Peter's word.
[1:20:56] Well, there's no revelation. Who was
[1:20:58] speaking through Peter on the day of
[1:20:59] Pentecost?
[1:21:00] Who was speaking? What is the name? What
[1:21:03] is the name of the father and the son,
[1:21:04] the holy ghost? One name, the lord Jesus
[1:21:06] Christ.
[1:21:07] Amen. Peter wasn't contradicting. He
[1:21:09] just had the interpretation of what
[1:21:11] Jesus said.
[1:21:12] Amen. But then people say, "No, you
[1:21:14] don't need to be baptized that way. You
[1:21:16] don't need to do those things." What's
[1:21:17] happened?
[1:21:18] They've gone, they're trying to build
[1:21:20] another altar.
[1:21:22] Amen. They're trying to approach God a
[1:21:24] different way.
[1:21:26] And once upon a time, that was okay cuz
[1:21:28] God winked at the ignorance of the
[1:21:29] people. But now the light has come. Now,
[1:21:31] the truth of the scriptur is here.
[1:21:33] And so, it took Elijah now to rebuild
[1:21:36] the altar.
[1:21:37] There was a lot of idols. There was
[1:21:38] Baal.
[1:21:40] There's a lot of idols. You say, "I'm in
[1:21:41] a bad condition.
[1:21:43] The spirit of Elijah has come.
[1:21:46] The word of the Lord is here."
[1:21:48] Amen. But the altar has to be rebuilt.
[1:21:52] Amen. And then the sacrifice goes on the
[1:21:54] altar.
[1:21:55] Amen. There's the wood and the yolk.
[1:21:57] Everything's got to be into place. And
[1:21:58] then so when all that was done and the
[1:22:00] water was poured on the altar, you go
[1:22:02] read you go read Elijah's prayers. Hear
[1:22:04] me, oh Lord. Hear me
[1:22:05] that thou art God. I've done all these
[1:22:07] things according to your word and you
[1:22:08] have turned the hearts of the people
[1:22:10] back again.
[1:22:12] Then the fire fell.
[1:22:13] The fire fell upon the sacrifice, burnt
[1:22:16] up the whole thing. And then what
[1:22:17] happened? The people said, "The Lord, he
[1:22:19] is God."
[1:22:20] Amen. What happened? Their hearts were
[1:22:22] being turned.
[1:22:23] They were estrained in all different
[1:22:24] kind of places and separated from God.
[1:22:26] But then the sacrifice was placed, the
[1:22:28] fire fell, and their hearts were turned
[1:22:30] back.
[1:22:31] And that's the purpose of God sending
[1:22:33] the spirit of Elijah.
[1:22:34] Amen.
[1:22:35] Amen. To turn your heart.
[1:22:37] Hallelujah. To turn the hearts of the
[1:22:39] people back.
[1:22:41] Amen. To a real walk with God. That's
[1:22:43] why that's why John the Baptist came in
[1:22:45] the spirit of Elijah. He wanted to God
[1:22:47] wanted to turn the people from the faith
[1:22:49] of the, you know, Moses and things. He
[1:22:51] turned the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:22:52] children. So turning them from the law
[1:22:54] of Moses and the traditions to receive
[1:22:57] the Messiah.
[1:22:59] And his ministry did it.
[1:23:01] His preaching, the anointing that came
[1:23:03] through the word he was speaking
[1:23:04] literally turn people's hearts,
[1:23:07] turn their affections because the heart
[1:23:08] is the seed of the affection in a
[1:23:10] person. Turn their whole ways to serve
[1:23:12] the living God.
[1:23:14] Amen. And that's why I said I'll send
[1:23:15] you Elijah in the end time to turn your
[1:23:18] hearts
[1:23:19] of the children back to the fathers to
[1:23:21] the turn your heart back to the faith of
[1:23:23] the original fathers.
[1:23:25] Hallelujah. Faith of the fathers living
[1:23:27] still.
[1:23:28] Amen. And it sure is living still.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah. So it takes and that's why
[1:23:33] it's so important. Just take the word as
[1:23:36] it is.
[1:23:37] Amen. Take it in the spirit it's given.
[1:23:40] And it's the spirit of Christ in that
[1:23:42] word which will literally turn your
[1:23:44] heart.
[1:23:45] Amen. If you're a strange, you know, if
[1:23:47] you're if you feel separated, you may be
[1:23:49] living in a house, but you feel like
[1:23:51] you're living in a different kind of
[1:23:52] country, let the spirit of God get your
[1:23:55] heart back to where it should be.
[1:23:57] Amen. Let this message turn your heart.
[1:24:00] Hallelujah. That's why God, that's why
[1:24:02] it's so amazing. You know, oh, you say
[1:24:04] all so negative things, your heart will
[1:24:05] go astray. Your heart will go this way.
[1:24:07] But there's a power upon the earth.
[1:24:10] Amen. There's a power upon the earth to
[1:24:12] get a person's heart and place it where
[1:24:14] it should be.
[1:24:15] Hallelujah.
[1:24:17] Amen. That's why it's so glorious. God
[1:24:19] comes in, takes out all the idols.
[1:24:21] Remember,
[1:24:22] we live in an hour. Daniel saw a vision
[1:24:26] and he saw a statue. You know, the
[1:24:27] statue of gold and it goes down to the
[1:24:29] feet of iron and clay. But then a stone
[1:24:31] was cut. It came out of the mountain
[1:24:32] with cut without hands. Came down and
[1:24:35] smoked the image in the feet.
[1:24:37] Hallelujah. And then that and then that
[1:24:39] stone became a you know then the then
[1:24:41] the image that was broken you know was
[1:24:44] just blown away as dust in the wind and
[1:24:46] then that stone became a great big
[1:24:47] mountain that filled the whole earth
[1:24:49] which is the kingdom of God.
[1:24:52] Now that has to happen in you.
[1:24:55] Amen. Because we were born under the
[1:24:57] anointing of of wherever we are from.
[1:25:01] What's the culture? The culture is the
[1:25:03] spirit of the nation that you're in.
[1:25:05] That dictates your culture. Amen. And
[1:25:08] there's good and there's bad in every
[1:25:09] culture. But we are not called to live
[1:25:12] according to a national culture or a
[1:25:14] color or a language. Amen. We're all one
[1:25:16] people by one spirit. We're baptized
[1:25:18] into one body.
[1:25:20] Hallelujah. That's why it doesn't
[1:25:21] matter. I can go to Papa New Guinea and
[1:25:23] I feel at home just like I'm at here. Go
[1:25:25] to Vanuatu. I'm at home here. Go see
[1:25:28] everyone here. I just feel at home.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah. I know this will go on the
[1:25:31] internet, but but we had a Christmas
[1:25:33] dinner at home. People from church and
[1:25:35] visitors and things. Amen.
[1:25:36] I thought this is family round the
[1:25:38] table.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah.
[1:25:40] Cuz we're all bloodwashed, redeemed.
[1:25:42] Hallelujah.
[1:25:43] Hallelujah.
[1:25:44] And so we're called to live above.
[1:25:46] That's why I think many times you see,
[1:25:48] you know, even among believers there's
[1:25:51] there's oh there South African, we're
[1:25:55] Kiwi or whatever whatever nationality.
[1:25:58] That's still a national spirit
[1:26:00] operating.
[1:26:01] Amen. Those people are still living
[1:26:03] under their national spirit.
[1:26:05] But yet worth, oh, I believe the
[1:26:07] message.
[1:26:08] But has the message come into them?
[1:26:11] Because if if God comes in, you don't
[1:26:12] care where the person's from. Are you
[1:26:15] bride? Yes. There's there's a there's a
[1:26:17] witness. The same spirit and God that's
[1:26:19] in me is in you.
[1:26:20] Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] And that's how it should be.
[1:26:24] That's exactly how it should be.
[1:26:26] Hallelujah. So now this stone
[1:26:30] this is why we live in this such a
[1:26:31] tremendous hour because that is that
[1:26:34] stone is Christ
[1:26:35] and we know very well that the part of
[1:26:38] the prophet's ministry is to what that
[1:26:40] stone is to come
[1:26:42] and that stone is here.
[1:26:44] Amen. Because even now why is this world
[1:26:46] falling apart? Why is the world falling
[1:26:49] apart? It's not economics and war and oh
[1:26:51] and the environment all these things.
[1:26:53] The reason it's falling apart is because
[1:26:55] the bride is coming into her position
[1:26:57] because the kingdoms of the world must
[1:27:00] fall.
[1:27:00] And they are falling.
[1:27:02] And no amount of any human ability is
[1:27:05] going to be able to resurrect this world
[1:27:06] to make it live again. It takes the
[1:27:09] coming of our Lord Jesus.
[1:27:10] Amen. To fix this world.
[1:27:13] And the reason that is crumbling is
[1:27:15] because that stone now that Christ has
[1:27:17] come into the bride and it's and it's
[1:27:20] growing. The kingdom is is expanding. I
[1:27:24] trust you can see it in your own life
[1:27:25] that the Christian you once were, you no
[1:27:28] longer because you got a closer walk
[1:27:29] with God. You're more mature. You know
[1:27:31] who you are in him. You know who who he
[1:27:34] is. You have confidence in him. You're
[1:27:36] not blown around by every wind of
[1:27:37] doctrine anymore.
[1:27:39] Hallelujah. You're no longer just
[1:27:40] drinking the milk of the word, but now
[1:27:42] you're having the meat cuz you've grown
[1:27:44] up.
[1:27:45] Hallelujah. And things that once really
[1:27:48] put you in a head spin, now you just
[1:27:49] walk on.
[1:27:50] L. Amen. Because you have confidence.
[1:27:52] I've been this way before, but now God
[1:27:55] is with me and I just trust him through
[1:27:57] the trial.
[1:27:57] Amen.
[1:27:58] Hallelujah.
[1:27:59] Amen.
[1:28:00] Why? What's happening? The kingdom is
[1:28:02] expanding.
[1:28:03] Amen. And as the kingdom expands in the
[1:28:05] bride, this world is falling apart.
[1:28:08] It's your fault basically. That's all
[1:28:09] I'm going to say.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] Glory.
[1:28:14] So, you have to let You say, "Well, I
[1:28:16] don't feel that kind of way." Let the
[1:28:18] stone come.
[1:28:19] Yes. Yes.
[1:28:20] Amen. Let the stone come into your
[1:28:22] heart. Let Christ come in and smash down
[1:28:24] all the idols of this world.
[1:28:27] Amen. Because without that, God will
[1:28:29] answer you according to the idol in your
[1:28:31] heart.
[1:28:33] Amen. But the Lord is here.
[1:28:36] Amen.
[1:28:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:37] To set at liberty them that are, you
[1:28:40] know, captive in all these things. We be
[1:28:42] captive by things in our own heart.
[1:28:44] Things that have happened in our life if
[1:28:46] we're not willing to to to actually give
[1:28:49] it over.
[1:28:50] Yes.
[1:28:51] Just like the man I told about people
[1:28:53] their whole life can be dictated to by
[1:28:54] one event.
[1:28:55] Yes.
[1:28:56] And then it can actually become
[1:28:58] something that they worship.
[1:29:00] Don't let that happen.
[1:29:02] Don't let it happen. You say it was
[1:29:04] terrible. I'm not I'm not downgrading
[1:29:06] anything.
[1:29:08] People go through terrible things that
[1:29:10] people should never have to experience,
[1:29:12] but don't let it become an idol.
[1:29:16] Amen.
[1:29:17] Amen. You say, "But I've been holding on
[1:29:20] to something for many, many years."
[1:29:22] Don't become a creature of habit.
[1:29:25] God is here that you can live above all
[1:29:27] things.
[1:29:27] Amen.
[1:29:28] If you want to
[1:29:30] if you want to.
[1:29:32] Hallelujah.
[1:29:35] Amen. Glory to it.
[1:29:37] We live in a time of full restoration.
[1:29:39] Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:40] Amen. The stone is here.
[1:29:42] Amen. The seal Christ has descended.
[1:29:46] Amen. The remember the end of his coming
[1:29:48] is we'll meet him in the air.
[1:29:49] But that same mighty angel is present.
[1:29:52] He didn't die in 1965.
[1:29:54] That's right.
[1:29:54] Amen. We don't live under some tradition
[1:29:56] of man. That's right.
[1:29:57] Amen. We don't live and just try and
[1:29:59] reform and all these things. But that
[1:30:00] very God is among us.
[1:30:03] Amen. And that very God wants to do
[1:30:06] change you. If you're holding on to
[1:30:07] things, you say, "Well, my situation is
[1:30:09] terrible. Jesus,
[1:30:12] I just I just think about it quite
[1:30:13] often. Here he is on the cross. Father,
[1:30:16] forgive them. They don't know what
[1:30:18] they're doing.
[1:30:20] And it says in the scripture,
[1:30:22] they had councils. They had meetings.
[1:30:26] They planned it. How are we going to
[1:30:28] destroy him?
[1:30:29] We can't just take him because people
[1:30:31] think he's a prophet. and we can't do
[1:30:32] this cuz you know jeopardize our
[1:30:33] position. And they planned it. H
[1:30:36] you know humanly
[1:30:37] we think they knew exactly what they
[1:30:39] were doing.
[1:30:39] They were angry at him. They wanted to
[1:30:41] destroy him.
[1:30:43] Amen.
[1:30:44] But yet he said and people come against
[1:30:47] us sometimes
[1:30:49] and it's calculated and it's planned
[1:30:51] and they wait for the right moment and
[1:30:53] there you are. Here's the assassin's
[1:30:56] knife in your back.
[1:30:57] Right.
[1:30:58] Amen. Many times it's in the four walls
[1:31:00] of a church.
[1:31:02] Amen.
[1:31:04] But you got to understand Jesus, he when
[1:31:08] he said those words, they weren't just
[1:31:10] idol words.
[1:31:11] Yes.
[1:31:12] He actually genuinely he could go to
[1:31:14] Calvary, not a bitter man.
[1:31:17] He was a man acquainted with sorrows and
[1:31:19] grief. It says in Isaiah 53, to be
[1:31:21] acquainted, you you know that really
[1:31:23] well,
[1:31:24] right?
[1:31:24] Amen. They were good friends.
[1:31:27] My goodness.
[1:31:27] Oh my. I'm so glad he he went through
[1:31:30] all those things. He can understand what
[1:31:31] we're going through.
[1:31:32] Thank you.
[1:31:33] But he went because remember he was
[1:31:34] fully God, but he was fully man.
[1:31:36] He had to be fully God because no other
[1:31:38] man could come and redeem us.
[1:31:40] But he had to be fully man as well to
[1:31:42] understand you.
[1:31:44] Understand me.
[1:31:45] So here he was
[1:31:47] and he could have been a very bitter. He
[1:31:48] came to his own but his own received him
[1:31:51] not.
[1:31:52] Here I am.
[1:31:54] These you're the most holy nation. the
[1:31:56] mo yo yo brother I'm preaching the
[1:31:58] indictment but he say the most holy
[1:32:00] people the most holy city the most holy
[1:32:03] place and there they crucified him
[1:32:06] amen and he says it's all being repeated
[1:32:08] again the meant to be Christian world
[1:32:11] holy people holy places churches amen
[1:32:15] the most holy God is here but then they
[1:32:17] crucify him again
[1:32:19] amen that's right
[1:32:20] so here he came to his own now don't
[1:32:23] don't don't reject what I'm Okay.
[1:32:27] But here he was. He came to his own. The
[1:32:29] God that was over them in Moses was all
[1:32:31] the way down through the prophets had
[1:32:33] led them all the way. He had led them.
[1:32:35] And now here he was. You think he wasn't
[1:32:37] looking forward to that moment? I'm not
[1:32:40] just going to be above them.
[1:32:42] I'm going to be with them.
[1:32:43] But not just that I want to be in them.
[1:32:46] Amen. Cuz they are the place of my rest.
[1:32:48] Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] Amen. And here he was. Yeah. He said he
[1:32:50] said about the temple. He says he says
[1:32:53] destroy this temple. I'll raise it up
[1:32:55] again in three days. That word destroy
[1:32:56] means loose. In other words, loose me
[1:32:58] from this prison. Loose me from this
[1:33:00] temple. I don't just want to be in one
[1:33:02] person. I want to be in all my children.
[1:33:04] Amen. Here he was with this great burden
[1:33:06] of his heart. Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] And they rejected him.
[1:33:10] And they said, "Crucify him." They
[1:33:12] received Barabbus instead of him.
[1:33:15] It was a good day for Barabus, but it
[1:33:16] wasn't a good day for the for the
[1:33:18] nation.
[1:33:19] And he prophesied their destruction. and
[1:33:21] and he saw what Titus would do, you
[1:33:24] know, you know, destroying Jerusalem. He
[1:33:25] saw all those things. He prophesied it
[1:33:27] would happen and he wept over the city.
[1:33:30] But yet in all those things, he was not
[1:33:31] a bitter man.
[1:33:34] All those things did not hinder his what
[1:33:37] he knew he had to do in the scripture.
[1:33:40] He says, "For this cause I've come into
[1:33:42] the world." Amen. for this cause. And he
[1:33:46] did not let any of those things
[1:33:49] hinder or stop his walk of what he had
[1:33:51] to fulfill in the scripture.
[1:33:53] Amen.
[1:33:54] And here you are to finish the work that
[1:33:56] he started.
[1:33:58] Amen. Because we are living out the
[1:34:00] second part of redemption.
[1:34:02] Amen.
[1:34:02] Amen. Remember, there's one part to
[1:34:04] redeem is to purchase the thing you want
[1:34:05] to redeem. And the second part is to
[1:34:07] lift it up to its original position.
[1:34:10] Amen. And as the ministry of the bride
[1:34:12] of Christ is to fulfill that great
[1:34:14] commission.
[1:34:15] Amen. We have we have word to fulfill.
[1:34:18] We're not just here spectators idly
[1:34:20] going through a religious life. We have
[1:34:22] scripture to fulfill.
[1:34:24] Amen. We have it's not just to take a
[1:34:26] rapture. That's the end of the
[1:34:27] scripture. But it's it's being prepared
[1:34:29] for that rapture. It's to find every
[1:34:31] lost one. Everyone that can be saved. We
[1:34:33] must gather them in.
[1:34:35] Amen. The ark door is open. We want to
[1:34:37] get everyone in. We can. That's part of
[1:34:39] our and to live it be a living witness
[1:34:41] to this dying generation.
[1:34:43] That's our scripture we're called to
[1:34:45] fulfill.
[1:34:46] Now, but the question is now, are you
[1:34:48] going to let disappointments and
[1:34:49] hardship and misunderstanding and and
[1:34:52] you know, terrible even things from your
[1:34:54] childhood, whatever it is, are you going
[1:34:55] to let that hinder that?
[1:34:57] No.
[1:34:58] Amen.
[1:34:59] Oh, God.
[1:35:00] Now, I I hope you're not saying down
[1:35:02] here, but it wrecked my life. It might
[1:35:05] have, but Jesus is here to heal the
[1:35:08] brokenhearted.
[1:35:09] Amen.
[1:35:11] So, it's really up to you.
[1:35:14] What do you want?
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:17] Cuz if it didn't stop him and the same
[1:35:19] spirit that was in him is in the bride.
[1:35:22] Amen.
[1:35:24] So, if he was able, remember Jesus, the
[1:35:26] reason he lived the way he lived was to
[1:35:28] be a living example.
[1:35:30] But he didn't live it in such a way to
[1:35:31] make you say you can never obtain this.
[1:35:33] Amen.
[1:35:34] Amen. Cuz he came down to become you
[1:35:37] that you would become him by grace.
[1:35:40] Is that right? So the very life just
[1:35:41] like the life of the prophet. You see
[1:35:43] Christ in mature form there in the life
[1:35:45] of the prophet that wasn't now we know
[1:35:47] we there's no one man ministry scripture
[1:35:50] anymore. It's a many you know many
[1:35:51] membered body and all these things now.
[1:35:53] But the life he lived you can live.
[1:35:58] Amen. He comes into his home.
[1:36:00] Visitors are all in the place. His
[1:36:02] wife's all upset. The children are
[1:36:04] hungry and fussing on the, you know,
[1:36:05] just great turmoil. And he comes in.
[1:36:08] He's praying in his heart. Lord, just
[1:36:11] send your Holy Spirit down to my wife.
[1:36:13] Quiet the kids. What does he do now?
[1:36:16] What did what's he doing? He's taking
[1:36:18] dominion over the atmosphere.
[1:36:21] Amen. Now, this this was demonstrated
[1:36:23] and put on tape to show you this. The
[1:36:25] same God in him is in you.
[1:36:27] Amen. So, he comes into his home. He
[1:36:29] take and he and he's putting on an
[1:36:30] apron. honey, you know, let me and and
[1:36:33] and his wife's all, you know, surprised.
[1:36:35] What are you doing? I'm just going to
[1:36:36] cook and I'm going to do this. And you
[1:36:38] know, what's he doing? Taking dominion.
[1:36:41] And then he begins to talk to her about
[1:36:43] some other thing. And the next thing you
[1:36:44] know, the kids are settled.
[1:36:46] She's all she's all relaxed now.
[1:36:48] Everything's fine.
[1:36:50] Amen. Oh. Oh. But that's just every day.
[1:36:53] Yeah.
[1:36:54] Amen. That is Christianity is every day.
[1:36:57] Yeah.
[1:36:57] And so all that was demonstrated to show
[1:36:59] now this is the life we're called to
[1:37:01] live.
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:05] But if we're just living according to
[1:37:07] culture or this is how my parents did it
[1:37:10] and this is how you know this, you know,
[1:37:12] they did it so I'm going to do it this
[1:37:13] way and this is how it should be and
[1:37:14] I've got quotes to support my stand.
[1:37:16] You'll never be able to do it.
[1:37:19] Amen. But if you just walk and have that
[1:37:23] have that understanding, God, you did it
[1:37:25] in the prophet.
[1:37:26] Yes. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:27] That same you, you're the same God in
[1:37:29] me.
[1:37:29] That's right.
[1:37:30] I can live the same kind of life.
[1:37:32] Yes, Lord.
[1:37:33] Amen.
[1:37:35] Then he did that to show you a living
[1:37:37] example.
[1:37:38] And brother Bram could have died a
[1:37:40] bitter man.
[1:37:41] Amen. He could have died a bitter man.
[1:37:44] But remember, even when he lost his love
[1:37:46] for the people after the opening of the
[1:37:48] seals, God brought him back again.
[1:37:52] Amen. because he showed him if you keep
[1:37:54] you know because he wanted to go be a
[1:37:56] hunter in north northern British
[1:37:57] Columbia I want to be a trapper. I've
[1:37:58] always wanted to be a trapper. I take my
[1:38:00] family, go up there. When God gives me a
[1:38:02] word, I'll come out of the wilderness
[1:38:03] like an Old Testament prophet. Thus say
[1:38:05] the Lord, blast it out, I'll go back up
[1:38:07] again. But then God showed him, if you
[1:38:09] continue this way, your your wife will
[1:38:11] leave you.
[1:38:12] You'll end up a bum on the street.
[1:38:14] Amen. And God and he and he God put his
[1:38:17] finger on it because he says, "I've lost
[1:38:19] my love for the people
[1:38:21] because of the rejection the message has
[1:38:24] received."
[1:38:25] Amen. So God brought him back again.
[1:38:29] These are all to show. Was the prophet
[1:38:32] redeemed? Yes. Was he in Was he adopted
[1:38:35] son? Yes.
[1:38:37] Amen. Was he was he fulfilling the
[1:38:39] scripture allotted to him? Yes.
[1:38:40] Amen.
[1:38:41] But these things begin to make him try
[1:38:43] and go sideways. And he could have made
[1:38:46] that
[1:38:47] he could have made that an idol.
[1:38:50] Amen. The people, you know, but he
[1:38:52] didn't. when the Lord came down and
[1:38:55] showed him,
[1:38:56] he repented of it and he continued on.
[1:39:00] Amen. Now, I'm using that example
[1:39:02] because you say, "Well, I've never had a
[1:39:04] spouse die and I've never lost a child,
[1:39:06] you know, like he lost his first wife
[1:39:08] and you know, little Sharon Rose." So
[1:39:10] many people can't relate to those
[1:39:12] things, but there always comes a time
[1:39:14] where we lose our love for one another
[1:39:18] because of how brother or sister treats
[1:39:20] us. That's right.
[1:39:21] But now the challenge is now do you want
[1:39:23] the rest of your Christian walk to be
[1:39:25] dictated to because of that?
[1:39:28] Oh, brother brother so and so, sister so
[1:39:30] and so is here. I I I I just you know
[1:39:33] and your whole remember as I said in the
[1:39:35] start an idol when the people come into
[1:39:38] the presence of their idol their whole
[1:39:40] attitude demeanor changes.
[1:39:43] Amen. So you can have something ought
[1:39:45] against someone and they can actually
[1:39:47] become an idol even if you don't
[1:39:50] actually adore that person because when
[1:39:52] you come into their into their presence
[1:39:54] now you change.
[1:39:57] Amen.
[1:40:00] Are you going to let those things stop
[1:40:01] you?
[1:40:04] Let's just bow our heads, shall we?
[1:40:08] If anyone wants to be remembered in
[1:40:09] prayer, just want to raise your hand.
[1:40:12] Gracious heavenly father, I have both
[1:40:14] hands up.
[1:40:16] Dear Lord, I've delivered what you put
[1:40:18] on my heart.
[1:40:20] I just pray now, oh God, that Lord,
[1:40:22] Lord, we know the things even now things
[1:40:24] come on our hearts.
[1:40:26] Father, a complex can become an idol.
[1:40:28] Lord,
[1:40:29] Father, bad situations in life can
[1:40:31] become an idol.
[1:40:33] But Father, we don't want those things
[1:40:34] to dictate to us.
[1:40:36] And Father, I pray for everyone here.
[1:40:37] Lord, you know the road they've walked.
[1:40:40] Some have walked very hard roads. Some
