[8:10] and
[8:13] [Music]
[10:48] everyone welcome to church this morning
[10:52] Amen it's good to be here it's good to
[10:55] be able to worship the Lord and to
[10:59] keep our minds focused on things eternal
[11:02] and to keep sober to keep keep our
[11:07] direction and life correct it's very
[11:10] very easy to get distracted into other
[11:12] directions now sometimes you can go for
[11:14] weeks and realize I'm actually going in
[11:16] slightly the wrong direction here we get
[11:18] caught up in our projects or just our
[11:21] natural things and and the the things of
[11:25] God we still we're still a Christian but
[11:27] the things of God just get left aside a
[11:31] wee bit because our focus is on sort of
[11:33] a project we're doing or an ambition we
[11:35] might have or something like that we're
[11:38] just just on just natural things which
[11:41] is alright but we've got to always keep
[11:43] keep their balance in favor of the Lord
[11:46] keep the scales tipped it's the
[11:48] Christian walk is not really a a walk of
[11:50] balance it's not like I do this much of
[11:51] the Lord and I balance that out
[11:52] perfectly with all the rest of the
[11:54] things I do it's actually supposed to be
[11:56] always balanced than the Lord's favor
[11:57] and these other things just kind of take
[12:00] this spot and that's where we have a
[12:02] successful Christian life and the more
[12:06] of the Lord we have they actually the
[12:08] more balanced we actually become so
[12:11] that's what we want let's um let's stand
[12:13] this morning air let's dedicate this
[12:15] service to the Lord and it start with
[12:18] only half a band
[12:22] I mean let's and let's pray Heavenly
[12:24] Father we think we can be gathered in
[12:26] your house this morning to worship You
[12:29] Lord to acknowledge you the king of
[12:31] kings and Lord of lords to acknowledge
[12:33] you Lord that you're the king of our
[12:34] life and to Lord just make sure that our
[12:38] minds are always focused upon the things
[12:41] of you Lord that our life would bring
[12:42] forth fruit the Lord that it wouldn't be
[12:46] the the seed that you've that's growing
[12:49] in us wouldn't be choked by the cares of
[12:52] this life or the deceitfulness of riches
[12:53] are all those things Lord that can
[12:55] easily choke us out Lord but that our
[12:58] the the the Word of God that's dwelling
[13:01] in our heart Lord would have space to be
[13:04] able to bear fruit Lord as your word
[13:06] since some 20 some 30 some 100 may each
[13:09] one of us bear the fruit that you would
[13:11] have desired for us to bear Lord as your
[13:14] the great gardener Lord and that we'll
[13:18] be diligent to take heed of the things
[13:20] which we've heard from you Lord and
[13:23] apply them to our lives and and
[13:25] completely apply them to our hearts will
[13:29] me bless brother benasi ministers this
[13:31] morning may we may we receive him as the
[13:34] voice of God this morning Lord know that
[13:37] we don't come here just to play a game
[13:38] Lord but we we come here recognizing
[13:41] Lord that you're doing a mighty work and
[13:43] this time and this day in this place
[13:45] you're doing a mighty work Lord we want
[13:48] to accept it as that because when we
[13:50] receive it as that then it will be there
[13:52] Lord but if we if we don't receive it as
[13:54] that Lord then we will just receive it
[13:56] as manner will do us no good Lord but we
[13:58] we dwell in a supernatural realm it's
[14:01] not just a natural thing if you guys
[14:03] have decided to enter building in and
[14:05] you know get together and sing a few
[14:08] songs and do a bit of speaking it's not
[14:10] a natural club Lord but it's a
[14:12] supernatural event Lord that we're
[14:13] partakers of this morning so we want to
[14:16] make sure our minds are always focused
[14:18] on that Lord to receive these things as
[14:20] from the hand of God and from the mouth
[14:22] of God Lord and that we would continue
[14:25] to walk day by day growing and our
[14:28] spiritual walk getting stronger and
[14:30] stronger every trial of our faith would
[14:32] overcome the Lord
[14:33] faith would grow stronger Lord we don't
[14:36] ask for more faith you never see it
[14:37] you'd give us more faith law but you
[14:39] said you'd try the faith that we had and
[14:41] that the faith that we had would grow
[14:43] Lord so we just pray for a trial of our
[14:45] faith each week that we would we would
[14:47] our faith would increase the Lord that
[14:50] would become more and more like you Lord
[14:52] when you were here on earth you were
[14:53] 100% faith 0% doubt and Lord that's what
[14:57] we desire in our life Lord that we would
[14:59] be 100% faith and zero force in doubt
[15:01] just like you we Lord so we just want to
[15:03] come at the service to your hands this
[15:05] morning and just pray a blessing upon it
[15:07] in Jesus name Amen amen
[15:10] I had an well let's start with them let
[15:12] me walk blessed Lord in the way thou has
[15:13] gone it's a bit of a mix around but just
[15:17] in that praying that prayer you know
[15:18] that's actually what we want to do is
[15:21] walk like the way the Lord walked and
[15:23] they keep and we can if Christ is in us
[15:27] then that's very quite simple we just
[15:29] let that grow more than what our natural
[15:31] man let let let Christ let us have more
[15:34] control than the natural man does each
[15:36] day and will actually walk like him it's
[15:39] really not that complicated you know you
[15:41] don't have to be overly intelligent to
[15:43] be a Christian
[15:44] you know now I'm happy for that
[15:48] it means like you didn't you know but
[15:51] Peter was just an unknown fisherman but
[15:55] it's not about our intellect it's about
[15:57] our faith and how much we're willing to
[15:58] lace up what we know to make Christ
[16:00] living us amen let me walk blessed Lord
[16:04] let me

[49:16] Alleluia amen if you've got your Bibles
[49:18] handy let's go to seeking Corinthians -
[49:21] I'll see if I can drive this thing there
[49:25] we go and then we're gonna go to Psalms
[49:27] 120 for a male just you'll love the Lord
[49:31] this morning I mean I trust you've all
[49:34] had a good week even if you've had a
[49:36] tough week it's still a good week
[49:37] because you still walk in faith that's a
[49:40] good week amen so let's go to sing
[49:43] Corinthians 2 and verses 9 to 11 it says
[49:49] for to this end also did I write that I
[49:53] might know the proof of you whether ye
[49:55] be obedient and all things to whom ye
[49:58] forgive anything
[50:00] I forgive also for if I forgave anything
[50:03] to whom I forgave it for your for your
[50:07] sakes for gay bi and the person of
[50:09] Christ lease Satan should have an
[50:11] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[50:14] of his devices and that's really what I
[50:16] want to speak on this morning but let's
[50:18] just go to Psalms 124 and I'm not sure
[50:22] who read this or where I heard this but
[50:23] I just love the scripture I mean and I
[50:27] just want to tie this into for a bit of
[50:29] a context
[50:33] Psalm 124 and and we're gonna read the
[50:36] whole Psalm I mean so he's here samms
[50:44] 124 and verse 1 if had if it had not
[50:47] been the Lord who was on our side now
[50:50] may Israel say now may the bride say
[50:53] because we're spiritual Israel if it had
[50:55] not been the Lord who was on our side
[50:57] when men rose up against us then they
[51:00] had swallowed us up quick there are when
[51:03] their wrath was kindled against us then
[51:06] the waters had overwhelmed us the stream
[51:10] had gone over our soul then the proud
[51:12] waters had gone over our soul blessed be
[51:14] the Lord who had
[51:16] not given us as a prey to their teeth
[51:18] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[51:21] snare of the Fowler the snare is broken
[51:24] and we are escaped our helpers in the
[51:27] name of the Lord who made heaven and
[51:29] earth
[51:30] hallelujah may may the Lord bless the
[51:32] reading of his word you may have your
[51:33] seats this morning I want to speak about
[51:36] we're not ignorant to the devil's
[51:38] devices I was I was going through this
[51:42] week about you know looking where we're
[51:45] all the believers failed you know it's a
[51:48] good big you know it's a good thing to
[51:49] actually look into because we should we
[51:51] need to study our enemy brother BAM says
[51:52] you've got to study your opponent we
[51:54] have a real opponent and and he's a
[51:56] slicker you can't you can't outwit him
[51:59] you can't you know out outthink him
[52:02] you know you can't defeat him and your
[52:03] own self he's a slicker brother bream
[52:05] says so so you need the Holy Ghost to
[52:08] defeat him right so but if Paul says
[52:12] were not ignorant of his devices then
[52:14] therefore we should study his devices
[52:16] and see how he works because if we don't
[52:18] if you don't study your enemy he'll just
[52:20] come in and just annihilate you and
[52:22] you'll be wondering how did I get to
[52:24] this place and you'll be his captive
[52:26] you'll be a you'll be a prisoner of war
[52:28] and but the thing is you will be
[52:30] actually willingly be a prisoner of war
[52:32] that's how that's how deceptive he is
[52:35] now so we are not but we're so we're not
[52:38] to be ignorant of his devices so we need
[52:42] to know then how he operates how he
[52:45] works and we need to know what his
[52:47] objective is so you must know your
[52:50] enemies if you know your enemy you will
[52:52] not be defeated you'll not fall into his
[52:53] traps and you won't be caught in his
[52:56] snare now we read there that the that
[52:59] the our souls are escaped as a bird out
[53:01] of the snare of the Fowler now if you
[53:04] look at trapping of any animal the
[53:06] animal has to agree to take the bait it
[53:10] has to agree to take the bait if it
[53:12] doesn't agree to take the bait it'll
[53:13] never be trapped so the devil his
[53:17] objective is to get you to agree with
[53:19] him and when you agree with him you take
[53:22] the bait and he never shows you the hook
[53:25] that's in the bait right so you have to
[53:28] agree with him
[53:29] and then he can take you now I want to
[53:31] show you this I'm gonna read it quote as
[53:32] we have this this is this is no man's
[53:34] land this is from World War one now
[53:37] we're just gonna leave it up there this
[53:39] is this is now this is no man's land
[53:41] this isn't a battlefield now brother
[53:43] perhaps isn't the greatest battle ever
[53:45] fought he says like when Israel went
[53:47] toward the Philistines now these I was
[53:50] comparing this with God and Satan
[53:51] fighting there was the hill on each side
[53:53] where they gathered and there that's
[53:56] where Goliath came out and called the
[53:57] called to the armies of Israel that's
[53:59] where David met him in the valley when
[54:01] he passed over the little creek that run
[54:03] between the two hills he picked up the
[54:05] rocks there has to be a place selected
[54:07] and Ernest it's a mutual ground
[54:10] it's called no-man's land right they
[54:12] fight here at this place
[54:14] they don't just they they just don't one
[54:18] fight over here and one over here and
[54:20] one over there there's a battlefront
[54:21] where they will meet and test their
[54:23] powers where each army test its strength
[54:26] against the other army a mutual meeting
[54:28] place he says now don't miss us now when
[54:31] the prophecies don't miss us you don't
[54:33] want to mess it right so don't miss this
[54:35] when this great battle started on earth
[54:37] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[54:39] there had to be a place selected for the
[54:42] battle to begin and for the battle to
[54:44] rage of the place to be and for the
[54:46] battle to rage and the battle grounds
[54:48] begins in the human mind right that's
[54:52] where the battle starts the human mind
[54:54] was chosen for the place of the battle
[54:56] where it was to begin and that is
[54:58] because that's decisions are made in the
[55:00] mind the head now they never started
[55:03] from some organization they never
[55:04] started from some mechanical affair the
[55:07] grounds never started there therefore
[55:09] the organization can never do the work
[55:10] of God because the battle grounds where
[55:13] you've got to meet your enemies in the
[55:14] mind you've got to make your choices it
[55:17] meets you
[55:18] I want any any any any any year so he
[55:22] says it meets you now this is no-man's
[55:24] land
[55:25] now that pay is not very clear here but
[55:28] this was a building of some type these
[55:32] this is destruction this barbed wire
[55:34] there's you know there's many other
[55:35] photos you'll often see these dead
[55:37] bodies all kinds of things it's craters
[55:39] there's bomb holes it's just death it's
[55:42] just it ever this
[55:43] no man's land now I trust none of our
[55:47] minds are in this condition because the
[55:49] devil bombards through through a medium
[55:52] just like he used the serpent the
[55:55] serpent was Satan's medium to get to Eve
[55:57] the world the world uses the internet
[56:00] social media entertainment sport puts an
[56:04] image in front of you and it's trying to
[56:07] get you to agree with it and I'll bring
[56:09] it right down right now if the devil
[56:12] just gets you to agree with him that you
[56:14] know just come to church and be a good
[56:16] message believer without the reality of
[56:18] God in your life without knowing him
[56:20] then he's got you right you can be the
[56:23] best message believer there is no the
[56:25] quotes from from you know from the
[56:27] beginning to communion right to the end
[56:29] you can know the Bible to get him
[56:31] without the life and the word he's got
[56:33] you right so you got to go and beyond
[56:36] just being a good a good believer I mean
[56:38] but God has to come in you and manifest
[56:40] he's going to take the battlefield over
[56:43] hallelujah because in our minds it
[56:45] shouldn't be this kind of way it should
[56:47] be a manuals ground should be God living
[56:49] there with his life and peace not
[56:52] bloodshed and war and barbed wire and
[56:54] concrete and bunkers and death and you
[56:57] know that's not how it should be but if
[57:00] you this is not how our mind should be
[57:03] right a lot of death now don't know if I
[57:09] have this up here yes I do
[57:10] he says humble yourselves therefore
[57:13] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[57:16] exalt you in due time casting your care
[57:18] upon him for he careth for you be sober
[57:20] be village vigilant because your
[57:22] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[57:25] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[57:28] whom resist steadfast in the faith
[57:30] knowing that the same afflictions are
[57:33] accomplished in your brethren that are
[57:36] in the world so now you know I read this
[57:39] I was thinking so the devil walks around
[57:42] like a roaring lion seeking whom a he
[57:43] devour have you ever seen him walking
[57:45] around have you ever seen him pretending
[57:47] to be a lion walking down the street
[57:49] have you ever seen him pretending to
[57:51] roar I'm a light I'm going to come to
[57:53] our people he never comes that way
[57:57] in it that's too obvious if you saw if
[58:00] you really saw demon power that's what
[58:03] they really look like if one would flee
[58:06] if they really saw lost spirits and you
[58:09] know demon that hatred and death and
[58:11] malice and strife and that means the
[58:13] other spreads behind worldly music and
[58:15] all the Oh murder and death no one would
[58:17] go near it they would flee as fast as
[58:20] they could but he never comes that way
[58:21] he comes nicely he comes he appeals to
[58:25] us sinners appealing whether you like it
[58:27] or not sinners appealing and God doesn't
[58:30] make us robots amen even with the Holy
[58:33] Ghost we still suffer temptation but
[58:36] there is a strong man in the house that
[58:39] overcomes that temptation hallelujah so
[58:42] you would have the strong man in the
[58:43] house now ooh
[58:45] before we go there so how does he devour
[58:51] comes across very innocently now the
[58:53] devil only depends perverts what God has
[58:56] done he is not original in anything he
[58:59] is the original copycat the devil is the
[59:02] greatest copycat there is right he so he
[59:06] does what God tries to do I mean no he
[59:09] tries to do what God is worried and he
[59:10] just perverts it he put something out
[59:12] there that's appealing now a sneer as I
[59:16] see it so one of our opening scriptures
[59:18] was our souls have escaped as a bird has
[59:21] escaped the snare of the Fowler now a
[59:24] snare is placed in an innocent-looking
[59:27] place and it's where the prey the thing
[59:32] you're trying to capture would would be
[59:34] so I'm not going to put a pig trap in
[59:37] the ocean to catch a pig a pig will
[59:40] never be in the ocean right
[59:43] it'll be where pigs go amen if I want to
[59:46] catch a you know I helped make a
[59:48] crocodile cake a cage and Papua New
[59:50] Guinea it was like as long about from
[59:52] here to the wall the saltwater crocodile
[59:54] would you know because it was eating
[59:55] people
[59:56] so this person's trying to make this
[59:57] cage to get it now if I put that on the
[59:59] road
[1:00:00] I won't catch the crocodile you got to
[1:00:02] be in its habitat the devil studies
[1:00:05] human beings
[1:00:06] he's very refined he knows you know he's
[1:00:10] not
[1:00:10] he's very targeted he's very smart
[1:00:14] God smarter though our God is far
[1:00:17] greater than him right but you know we
[1:00:20] can't underestimate our enemy so a sneer
[1:00:25] is placing it in its place an
[1:00:27] innocent-looking place where the prey
[1:00:29] words would frequent and there is
[1:00:32] something there that attracts them and
[1:00:34] in order to trap something you've got to
[1:00:37] get your prey to agree to take the bait
[1:00:39] without knowing what that is a hook or a
[1:00:41] catch that they can't escape now both
[1:00:44] the Lord Jesus and Satan are trying to
[1:00:46] make prisoners today Paul said I'm a
[1:00:49] prisoner of Jesus Christ he yo and we
[1:00:51] God is looking for love prisoners when
[1:00:54] you fall in love with him even become a
[1:00:56] prisoner to his word because you love
[1:00:58] him
[1:00:58] rights are both Satan and God are trying
[1:01:01] to get prisoners you'll be a prisoner to
[1:01:03] one you'll be a prisoner to Satan you
[1:01:06] can be very religious you're still a
[1:01:07] prisoner to Satan or you'll be a love
[1:01:09] president Jesus Christ this word you'll
[1:01:12] be bound by the change of his word and
[1:01:13] you won't do your own will he will only
[1:01:15] do the will of his word right so there's
[1:01:18] only two but you have to it depends who
[1:01:21] you agree with that is the one that will
[1:01:23] get you right he says and so in John one
[1:01:28] he came to his own and his own received
[1:01:31] him not but as any is received him to
[1:01:34] them gave he power to become the sons of
[1:01:37] God even to them that believe on his
[1:01:39] name which are born not of blood nor of
[1:01:41] the will of the flesh nor the will of
[1:01:43] man but of God and the Word was made
[1:01:45] flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his
[1:01:47] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:01:49] of the Father full of grace and truth
[1:01:51] so he had to he came but they didn't
[1:01:54] receive him many sympathized with them
[1:01:59] Nicodemus sympathized we know that our
[1:02:02] teacher come from God
[1:02:03] many sympathized with them but you can't
[1:02:06] just sympathize with the word you can't
[1:02:08] say well it makes good people they're
[1:02:10] nice this is wonderful yes it makes
[1:02:12] sense you can't you sympathize with the
[1:02:14] word or just say you believe it but have
[1:02:17] some reservations in your mind that's
[1:02:20] not receiving him if you've still got a
[1:02:22] bit of doubt in your mind of it's true
[1:02:24] or not
[1:02:24] you haven't received Christ and Christ
[1:02:26] is the word right you have to receive
[1:02:30] you can't just sympathize with the wood
[1:02:32] you've got to fully receive it fully
[1:02:35] agree with it see God is trying to get
[1:02:37] you to agree with his word and when you
[1:02:39] really really agree with him then you
[1:02:41] receive him right so you've got to fully
[1:02:45] agree with it and you do that and faith
[1:02:47] in begins to grow but if you have always
[1:02:50] this doubt in your mind and the devil
[1:02:53] always tries to put a question mark on
[1:02:54] the word what did he did to Eve we're
[1:02:57] going to go into even a little bit Sumba
[1:02:58] says yay hath God said he's a big giant
[1:03:01] question mark I'm going to put on your
[1:03:02] faith even a he's saying and that's what
[1:03:05] the devil wants to do you gotta kick it
[1:03:06] out you got to kick it out don't even
[1:03:09] stop and talk to the devil what even got
[1:03:11] to give to me oh hell well no I'm not
[1:03:13] gonna listen to you my lord jesus
[1:03:16] promised me a rapture and a spirit has
[1:03:18] quickened me to vindicate that I'm going
[1:03:20] in that rapture that is words alive
[1:03:22] so just listen to him it's worked so far
[1:03:25] I'm just going to continue hallelujah
[1:03:28] jesus said if you continue in my word
[1:03:30] than you're my disciples indeed and ye
[1:03:32] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:03:34] make you free there's a power and the
[1:03:36] truth to free anyone if they continue in
[1:03:39] the word hallelujah so now for the Bram
[1:03:42] says now it's always fundamentally the
[1:03:45] quick word of God the Bible every bit of
[1:03:47] its inspired and it's all God's Word and
[1:03:50] God is as in his word for so if God is
[1:03:53] in his word than if you received the
[1:03:55] word you receive God Amen now brother
[1:03:59] Brant sees in Pergamon church age he
[1:04:01] said he knew the only way man originally
[1:04:03] got away from God was by first leaving
[1:04:05] the word I know I've said this before
[1:04:07] but just put it down to my age I'm
[1:04:10] getting older hallelujah if you leave
[1:04:12] that word you've left God that's how
[1:04:14] important just stay with the word that's
[1:04:16] why when brother Graham saw the preview
[1:04:19] of the bride and those ones were looking
[1:04:20] up on the wrong thing now looking at the
[1:04:22] sneers of the Fowler he screamed out
[1:04:24] stay in line stay in line with the word
[1:04:27] dismiss its work friends in a word I've
[1:04:30] seen it work in multiple countries it
[1:04:32] works it lives it delivers it heals and
[1:04:36] redeems and transforms
[1:04:38] we knew just stay with the word it's
[1:04:41] been vindicated
[1:04:42] God has identified himself with this
[1:04:44] word and he still identifies himself
[1:04:46] with this word so I say our God where do
[1:04:49] you put your seal of approval this
[1:04:50] message okay I'll stay with this
[1:04:53] hallelujah that's what we should do
[1:04:55] but the problem is influence of man
[1:04:57] comes in like Korah Dathan and Moses
[1:04:59] says to them well we'll see who's gods
[1:05:01] and who's not gods if the earth opens up
[1:05:05] if God does a new thing and the earth
[1:05:07] swallows you up then we'll see who is
[1:05:09] gods or not and God told them separate
[1:05:11] yourself from them the u.s. swallows
[1:05:13] them up you think that'd be good enough
[1:05:15] then shortly after that the people of
[1:05:18] Israel they get angry at Moses and Aaron
[1:05:20] and they say you have killed the people
[1:05:22] of God speaking of Korah Dathan you got
[1:05:25] read it in numbers that's how strong the
[1:05:27] influence was they actually thought that
[1:05:29] Moses and Aaron killed them but God was
[1:05:31] saying I identify myself with a group
[1:05:33] and it's not the ones that got swallowed
[1:05:35] by the world cause I got swallowed by
[1:05:38] the earth by the world
[1:05:39] God doesn't identify with those being
[1:05:41] swallowed by the world he identifies
[1:05:43] with those who stay with us saith the
[1:05:45] Lord
[1:05:46] so we want to stay with the word amen
[1:05:50] hallelujah if you want he says now thus
[1:05:54] he is presenting himself to the church
[1:05:56] at Pergamos and indeed to all churches
[1:05:58] of all ages I am the word if you want
[1:06:01] deity in your midst then welcome and
[1:06:03] receive the word don't ever let anyone
[1:06:05] or anything get between you and that
[1:06:07] word anyone or anything right that which
[1:06:11] I'm giving you the word as a revelation
[1:06:13] of myself I am the word remember that I
[1:06:15] wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:06:17] with the word now much I wonder if we're
[1:06:20] sufficiently impressed with with the
[1:06:22] soldier on the battlefield which is the
[1:06:24] Holy Ghost in you I mean sometimes
[1:06:26] you're in battle they're you know
[1:06:27] they're pinned down they say we need
[1:06:28] reinforcements then the tanks come in
[1:06:31] the jet fighters come in and the enemy
[1:06:33] just gets blitzkrieg hallelujah the Holy
[1:06:35] Ghost is the ultimate one that you know
[1:06:37] a blitzkrieg is lightning war you know
[1:06:39] the enemy just yo comes in like the
[1:06:41] Nazis did in Europe they they just
[1:06:43] bombarded and pushed through and they
[1:06:45] conquered that is just a not even a it's
[1:06:49] just a small shadow of what God does
[1:06:52] he's the ultimate lightning war warrior
[1:06:55] hallelujah be got to agree with him you
[1:06:58] know we always have you know we'll
[1:06:59] always have mind battles whether you
[1:07:01] like it or not but it depends who you
[1:07:03] agree with do you agree with the doubt
[1:07:05] that makes you feel heavy I'm not
[1:07:07] talking about it's very different you
[1:07:09] know we can be convinced of sin
[1:07:10] convicted there's that kind of heaviness
[1:07:12] but then there's a heaviness of doubt
[1:07:14] coming it's two very different things
[1:07:16] and when the devil comes along has a
[1:07:18] mate doesn't make you rejoice does it
[1:07:20] stabilize your walk now destabilizes
[1:07:22] your walk well then you know well that's
[1:07:23] the serpent talking to you God doesn't
[1:07:26] destabilize he stabilizes he reinforced
[1:07:29] he increases faith he doesn't belittle
[1:07:32] faith he doesn't belittle his word he
[1:07:33] doesn't contradict his own word God
[1:07:35] can't contradict his own words I mean so
[1:07:38] he's the ultimate soldier on the
[1:07:39] battlefield we have to paint upon him in
[1:07:42] the battle in our mind amen now how do
[1:07:47] we pray cease let me give you a thought
[1:07:49] here how do we pray we pray in Jesus
[1:07:51] name don't we
[1:07:52] every prayers and his name or there
[1:07:53] isn't any answer yet in 1st John 5:14
[1:07:56] we're told this is the confidence we
[1:07:57] have in him that if we ask anything
[1:07:59] according to US will he heareth us and
[1:08:02] we know that he hears us whatever we ask
[1:08:04] we know that we have petitions that we
[1:08:07] desire from now we now we ask what is
[1:08:10] the will of God there's only one way to
[1:08:11] know his will that is by the Word of God
[1:08:14] lamentations 337 who is he that saith
[1:08:17] and it come to pass when the law
[1:08:19] commanded is not there it is if it isn't
[1:08:21] in the word you can't have it so we
[1:08:24] can't ask unless it's in the word and we
[1:08:26] can't petition or ask anything unless
[1:08:28] it's in his name there it is again Jesus
[1:08:31] the word SAR Jesus the name is the word
[1:08:34] or the will you can't separate God in
[1:08:36] the word they are one now then this word
[1:08:39] he has left behind on printed page as a
[1:08:41] part of whom when you accept it by faith
[1:08:44] into a spirit-filled life he says that
[1:08:47] his word was life John 6:63 the B part
[1:08:50] but is exactly what he is John 14:6 I am
[1:08:55] the way the truth and the life Romans
[1:08:57] 8:9 is the B part of verse of any man
[1:09:00] have not the Spirit of Christ he is none
[1:09:01] of his
[1:09:02] there it is he is spirit and his life
[1:09:05] that is
[1:09:05] exactly what the word is there's exactly
[1:09:08] what Jesus is he is the word and when a
[1:09:10] spirit born spirit filled man and faith
[1:09:13] takes the word into his heart and place
[1:09:14] it upon his lips why is the same as
[1:09:16] deity speaking every mountain has to go
[1:09:18] Satan cannot stand before that man if
[1:09:22] the church way back there in that Third
[1:09:24] Age had only held on to the revelation
[1:09:26] of the Living Word and there metz the
[1:09:28] power of God would not have faded as it
[1:09:30] did in those dark ages and right today
[1:09:32] when the church returns to the word and
[1:09:34] faith and here we are we can say without
[1:09:37] doubt that the glory of God and the
[1:09:39] wonderful acts of God will be in hermits
[1:09:41] again and it is hallelujah so that's how
[1:09:46] important it is you got to really
[1:09:47] receive the word amen you ought to agree
[1:09:51] with it now the serpent comes to Eve
[1:09:57] this is really what it all boils down to
[1:10:00] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:10:03] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:10:04] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[1:10:06] hath God said yea if God said you shall
[1:10:08] not eat of every tree of the garden
[1:10:10] questioned and the woman said unto the
[1:10:12] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:10:15] trees of the garden but the fruit of the
[1:10:17] tree which is in the midst the garden
[1:10:19] God has said you shall not eat of it
[1:10:21] neither touch it lest you die and the
[1:10:23] serpent said unto the woman ye shall not
[1:10:25] surely die for God doth know in the day
[1:10:30] to eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:10:33] opened and ye shall be as God's knowing
[1:10:34] good and evil and when the woman saw
[1:10:36] that the tree was good for food it was
[1:10:38] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:10:40] desired to make one wise she took of the
[1:10:42] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[1:10:43] unto her husband with her and he didn't
[1:10:46] eat now I know brother Isaac went
[1:10:48] through this in great detail but it's
[1:10:50] just because it's part of it that's why
[1:10:51] it's here ok so Satan used use the
[1:10:55] serpent as a channel to get to Eve and
[1:10:58] it says in 2nd Corinthians 11:14 and no
[1:11:01] Marvel for Satan himself is transformed
[1:11:03] into an angel of light
[1:11:04] so Satan always uses a medium to get to
[1:11:08] you and the first thing he did is he put
[1:11:11] a question mark on the word and he
[1:11:14] reasoned with her and he got her to
[1:11:17] agree with what he was tell
[1:11:20] so the devil just wants you to agree
[1:11:21] with him this is where the battle comes
[1:11:24] it's in here he wants you to agree if
[1:11:26] you you know so for example you've been
[1:11:30] having a tough walk with God recently
[1:11:33] it's thinking you got to look at what
[1:11:35] what is your thought pattern because if
[1:11:38] it's in your mind well I'm never going
[1:11:40] to overcome this I'm never victorious
[1:11:42] these people just don't like me I don't
[1:11:45] know if I'm even going to make it where
[1:11:46] did that thought come from you've got to
[1:11:49] really stop and you think we did that
[1:11:51] thinking where did that line of thought
[1:11:53] come from because it didn't come from
[1:11:55] here there's anyone found a scripture in
[1:12:00] here where where where that is no I'm
[1:12:03] more than an over and we are more than
[1:12:05] conquerors through Christ Jesus we're
[1:12:08] more than overcomers he paid it all
[1:12:10] we're victorious amen you know we've
[1:12:13] been redeemed we're being washed in the
[1:12:15] blood holy you know this Bible to the
[1:12:18] believer it's a it's a lovely - telling
[1:12:20] you you're gonna make it you've been
[1:12:22] redeemed I paid it all just give
[1:12:25] yourself to me and I'll do the work I've
[1:12:27] already done it just walking what I've
[1:12:29] done hallelujah that's that's what it
[1:12:32] says to me so you've got to think now
[1:12:35] well we did the line of thought coming
[1:12:36] saying well I'm never going to make it
[1:12:38] I'm not like this person how can I ever
[1:12:39] take a rapture that's the devil's
[1:12:41] thinking that's the devil trying to
[1:12:43] plant a seed in your mind that it will
[1:12:45] grow because you know brother bran was
[1:12:49] asked well how do I know if I'm thinking
[1:12:50] God's thoughts well God's thoughts or
[1:12:52] his word God that's it's really that
[1:12:55] simple is it God's Word or is it not
[1:12:57] God's Word but if you agree with that
[1:13:01] car thinking then you will become what
[1:13:04] you think you become I know brother
[1:13:07] David Silas said and he said you are
[1:13:09] your ambition so what you at what your
[1:13:12] ambition is to be is that that's what
[1:13:14] you'll become if you're a bum if you
[1:13:16] think well I just have no ambition in
[1:13:18] life I'm just floating through you know
[1:13:20] what will be what will be and Here I am
[1:13:22] and you know there's no point you'll
[1:13:23] become that but that thinking came from
[1:13:26] somewhere right and so but then if you
[1:13:30] have an ambition Lord I love you you've
[1:13:32] redeemed me
[1:13:33] I want to serve you with all my heart
[1:13:34] mind soul and strength because you're
[1:13:36] worthy not that I learn I'm not looking
[1:13:38] to earn anything but because I love you
[1:13:40] I want to serve you I want to be a real
[1:13:41] believer then you'll become that because
[1:13:43] that's your ambition in life right so
[1:13:46] you've got to it depends what you agree
[1:13:49] with if one if one with me you got to
[1:13:52] watch you know because many times it's
[1:13:54] our our voice in our heads because the
[1:13:57] devil gives you you know he gives you
[1:13:59] thoughts and he makes you on them and
[1:14:01] then he condemns you for having them
[1:14:04] amen Hey
[1:14:06] everyone has who's ever had a mind
[1:14:09] battle before if you're honest you'll
[1:14:11] put both hands up right everyone has
[1:14:14] them I mean the believers down through
[1:14:17] the ages just because you got a mind
[1:14:19] battle doesn't mean you're not a
[1:14:20] believer that's irrelevant
[1:14:23] The Devil's guns are on you you know
[1:14:25] that's just how does he bombard you he
[1:14:28] wants you to derail your faith but who
[1:14:31] are you accepting what he what are you
[1:14:34] accepting are you accepting God's Word
[1:14:36] or you're accepting hallelujah the
[1:14:39] devil's lie now but every man is tempted
[1:14:42] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[1:14:44] and enticed then when lust has conceived
[1:14:48] it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's
[1:14:50] finished it bringeth forth death the
[1:14:52] fall in the garden happened in the mind
[1:14:55] Eve had to agree with the Serpent's lie
[1:14:58] it was conceived in here then it was
[1:15:00] manifested just like everything every
[1:15:03] sin upon the earth it starts in here
[1:15:06] right and the thing is the problem is we
[1:15:10] are born wrong we are born with a sinful
[1:15:12] nature we are born agreeing with Satan
[1:15:15] whether we like it or not that's how
[1:15:17] we're born that's why you're going to be
[1:15:18] born again you got to be renewed your
[1:15:21] spirit your human spirits got to be
[1:15:22] cleansed it's got to be changed the Lord
[1:15:24] Himself has got to descend and come into
[1:15:26] your soul and take over amen I'm glad he
[1:15:30] does
[1:15:31] hallelujah so it all starts in the mind
[1:15:36] now they should be as I see it I think I
[1:15:41] seen it before the believer will still
[1:15:43] be tempted you know sometimes we think
[1:15:45] well when we really meet him
[1:15:47] in the battles over now the battle
[1:15:48] really just begins the battle really
[1:15:51] just begins when you meet him you take
[1:15:53] Israel the Bell will really started when
[1:15:55] they cross Jordan wasn't in the
[1:15:57] wilderness they had some battles they
[1:15:58] overcame whatever happened but it's
[1:16:01] Whitney cross Jordan then the fighting
[1:16:02] really began but when they walked the
[1:16:05] courting met Joshua was told to meditate
[1:16:07] upon the whole Word of God that was
[1:16:09] given and he quoted Moses to the people
[1:16:12] and he meditated upon it and God said if
[1:16:14] you do this then you'll be successful
[1:16:16] who wants to be successful in their
[1:16:18] Christian walk Lord I want your victory
[1:16:20] to be manifested in my life meditate
[1:16:22] upon his word he say well then and
[1:16:25] that's the problem these days this world
[1:16:29] is full of information we live in a
[1:16:31] hyper Information Age you know we're
[1:16:34] bombarded continually I've got
[1:16:37] notifications and junk email and this
[1:16:39] social media and the news and all these
[1:16:42] things you know we I have the same I
[1:16:46] don't know who the richest man in the
[1:16:47] world is these days I think the guy who
[1:16:48] owns Amazon doesn't matter I have the
[1:16:50] same 24 hours he does right he doesn't
[1:16:53] have more or less time we have the same
[1:16:55] amount of time but it's how we use our
[1:16:57] time right what are you giving yourself
[1:16:59] to whatever you give yourself to you'll
[1:17:02] become that people give themselves you
[1:17:05] know to all kind of demon spirits they
[1:17:07] manifest that spirit right but you got
[1:17:12] to look at now what are you giving
[1:17:13] yourself to but as I say that we are
[1:17:17] still the believer is still tempted even
[1:17:20] with the Holy Ghost in their lives
[1:17:22] because we're still living in these
[1:17:24] bodies that's why we need a body change
[1:17:26] and that's why we're all going to
[1:17:27] rejoice when these bodies have changed
[1:17:29] thank God I'm not in this pest house
[1:17:31] anymore
[1:17:32] thank God has been transformed
[1:17:34] hallelujah amen through it so you know
[1:17:39] so we still be tempted cuz we're in this
[1:17:42] we're still living in these bodies but
[1:17:45] the Holy Ghost should be in us that when
[1:17:48] the enemy comes in like a flood he'll
[1:17:50] raise up a standard and there'll be
[1:17:52] alarm bells begin to set off there
[1:17:55] should be alarm bells you know I you
[1:17:58] know there's this very old
[1:18:00] we used to watch called lost in space
[1:18:02] there was a family that was stuck on
[1:18:05] some planet and there was a robot that
[1:18:07] like protected and then whenever there
[1:18:09] is danger this robot will go danger Will
[1:18:11] Robinson is like this root yo he's one
[1:18:13] of the characters you know hit hit be
[1:18:14] the alarm bell going off this danger
[1:18:16] Will Robinson it's like the hologram so
[1:18:19] it's a very crude illustration but
[1:18:21] that's like God you begin to walk
[1:18:23] because he's your shepherd the shepherd
[1:18:25] sees and understands and knows way more
[1:18:27] than sheep and so when the enemy comes
[1:18:29] around the Shepherd should begin to say
[1:18:31] unto you be careful the devil's nearby
[1:18:34] stop looking at that stop feeding on
[1:18:37] that thing
[1:18:38] stop letting it consume your mind hey
[1:18:40] there should be a warning bell going off
[1:18:42] that is wrong that is Satan's I mean
[1:18:45] that's why you know people look at stuff
[1:18:47] yo even even just the news you know we
[1:18:50] you know we saw or Hollywood's evil of
[1:18:52] course it's evil but then you go read
[1:18:53] the news and this person killed this
[1:18:55] person this person murdered these people
[1:18:57] this person mutilated this and you're
[1:18:59] like why did I just fill my head with
[1:19:01] all that you know you think about it
[1:19:04] does it really did I really need to know
[1:19:07] that no is it good you know nothing but
[1:19:13] the Word of God for this day will give
[1:19:16] you rapturing faith rap stirring faith
[1:19:18] is in the Word of God and has endless
[1:19:20] messages rapturing faith faith cometh by
[1:19:22] hearing and hearing the Word of God so
[1:19:24] God is giving us rapturing faith through
[1:19:26] his word I mean the news does not have
[1:19:29] rapturing faith right anything outside
[1:19:32] the Word of God has no rapturing faith
[1:19:35] amen so we're going to think about what
[1:19:37] am i filling myself with hallelujah I
[1:19:40] want to give God something to work with
[1:19:42] don't you yes a lord I want to take your
[1:19:45] word in and you can ignite it with your
[1:19:47] Holy Spirit and it'll live hallelujah
[1:19:49] see you got to look at what do you want
[1:19:51] I want to see God live I want to see you
[1:19:54] manifest himself I want to see him do
[1:19:56] things that you know no one's ever
[1:19:58] really seen before don't we want them to
[1:20:01] live there's another the greatest joy
[1:20:03] that believer Lord you live today not
[1:20:06] that you're going by you know the true
[1:20:09] believer doesn't you know the true
[1:20:10] believer doesn't care if their name is
[1:20:12] mentioned the Apostle Paul was taken up
[1:20:14] into the
[1:20:14] third heaven he said on your men and it
[1:20:18] was him but he didn't want to be all
[1:20:20] look at the Apostle Paul no he want to
[1:20:22] give glory to God
[1:20:23] that's how we and and when you hear
[1:20:25] brother Bram talk about the account of
[1:20:26] going to South Africa and what happened
[1:20:28] at Durban racetrack and the supernatural
[1:20:30] you hear his account you hear Sidney
[1:20:32] Jackson's account and when I heard the
[1:20:34] two I thought that sounds like they're
[1:20:35] talking about two different events
[1:20:36] they're talking about the same event but
[1:20:38] brother bang cuz it was him he kind of
[1:20:41] downplayed it a little bit cuz he wasn't
[1:20:44] he didn't want to draw attention to
[1:20:45] himself Oh hasten the day where we just
[1:20:47] want to wrap a curtain around ourselves
[1:20:48] the world doesn't see us right they
[1:20:51] should go cuz we you know we know that
[1:20:53] we don't want to be lifted up that's the
[1:20:55] man yeah that's man's doings I want to
[1:20:57] become something though I want him to
[1:20:59] become something I want him to live
[1:21:01] that's the main thing it doesn't matter
[1:21:03] if we're not even a footnote in history
[1:21:05] who cares as long as he lives that's the
[1:21:09] most important thing so the Holy Ghost
[1:21:12] should come and he should set off alarm
[1:21:14] bells when there's something not right
[1:21:17] he sees in John 16:8 and when he has
[1:21:20] come speaking of the Spirit of Truth he
[1:21:22] will reprove which means to convict
[1:21:25] convince telephone rebuke the world and
[1:21:27] of righteousness and of judgment so the
[1:21:30] Holy Ghost should be in your life
[1:21:31] telling you when you're stepping out of
[1:21:32] line amen we're led by ya my sheep know
[1:21:36] my voice I mean so there should be
[1:21:39] something in you which should tell you
[1:21:41] something is not quite right right and
[1:21:44] it should come down into religion
[1:21:45] especially you know I saw a I saw a clip
[1:21:49] on Facebook a short two minute clip over
[1:21:51] there was a convention in Switzerland
[1:21:53] very recently this last month and the
[1:21:55] people are rejoicing
[1:21:57] they look like believers they were
[1:21:58] singing but something in me didn't feel
[1:22:01] quite right and in the worship leader
[1:22:03] whoever was here begin to say you are
[1:22:05] the holy ghost you are charity and house
[1:22:08] although there it is we are not the holy
[1:22:10] ghost he is the holy ghost than us
[1:22:13] you're right but there should be an
[1:22:15] alarm bell because it's always the 30
[1:22:17] inch thin edge of the wedge I mean where
[1:22:20] it comes down but there should be a
[1:22:21] voice in you saying no or yes Amen don't
[1:22:27] you try
[1:22:28] in God's leadership Jesus says in John
[1:22:34] 16:13 and lead us not into it this is
[1:22:36] from a model prayer lead us not into
[1:22:39] temptation but deliver us from evil
[1:22:42] Luke 4 1 and 2 I'm just using these to
[1:22:44] show that we're still tempted Jesus when
[1:22:48] did his temptation come look for verses
[1:22:51] 1 and 2 and Jesus being full of the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost returned from Jordan he just got
[1:22:54] baptized and was led by the spirit into
[1:22:57] the wilderness being forty days tempted
[1:22:58] of the devil and in those days he didn't
[1:23:01] eat nothing and when they were ended he
[1:23:03] afterward hungered in down in verse 13
[1:23:05] of Luke 4 and when the devil had entered
[1:23:08] all the temptation he departed from him
[1:23:10] for a season so it's amazing the
[1:23:12] spirital you know the Holy Ghost fills
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ the fullness of the Godhead
[1:23:17] bodies in a man where does that spirit
[1:23:19] lead him into temptation I mean I mean
[1:23:21] in sorry into the world miss to be
[1:23:23] tempted of the devil isn't that
[1:23:25] interesting
[1:23:25] that's the same thing with you and I you
[1:23:27] know God wants to prove his salvation
[1:23:29] God wants to prove his protection
[1:23:31] God wants to prove his deliverance I
[1:23:33] mean that we are not just free we're
[1:23:35] always free amen that's what he wants to
[1:23:37] prove he wants to prove that no spirit
[1:23:40] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:23:42] prosper there's a lot of weapons he
[1:23:44] forms but they shall not prosper
[1:23:46] hallelujah you know for the devil to
[1:23:48] have devices he must have multiple
[1:23:51] devices he's not a one-trick pony he's
[1:23:54] not a one-trick pony he's got a
[1:23:56] multitude of weapons in his arsenal but
[1:23:58] they all boil down the unbelief of the
[1:24:00] Word of God however it comes amen so now
[1:24:06] it's just oK we've got this ice Tollison
[1:24:11] brother on moliro site now this is a
[1:24:13] diagram of of you so we have here this
[1:24:18] is your body the outer ring is the body
[1:24:20] this is the this is how your body
[1:24:22] contacts the world feel taste here smell
[1:24:25] and see that's the five senses yeah and
[1:24:29] then your spirit now an it but then you
[1:24:32] have a spirit realm and that's contact
[1:24:35] by reasoning conscious imagination of
[1:24:37] fiction and memory yes none
[1:24:40] those contact God you don't contact God
[1:24:45] by feeling you don't I'm just you may
[1:24:48] say well this is very elementary but I
[1:24:50] want you to think about it you don't
[1:24:51] contact God by taste or by here only
[1:24:56] right smell or see remember the
[1:24:59] Pharisees heard the same word jesus said
[1:25:01] as the disciples did it didn't give them
[1:25:03] faith and then the memory reasoning
[1:25:06] conscious those things it's faith God
[1:25:09] gave you faith to contact God faith now
[1:25:14] and these are all the outside influences
[1:25:18] of the world now I want to deal with
[1:25:21] memory I want to deal with three memory
[1:25:24] a fiction and imagination because or
[1:25:28] really all these things but mainly these
[1:25:30] three feed off each other very well they
[1:25:34] feed each other very well now your
[1:25:37] memory and I've gone to later but what
[1:25:41] you remember
[1:25:42] you gotta think now you've got to be
[1:25:43] real careful this way you've got to be a
[1:25:44] steward of you steward of your mind
[1:25:47] right you don't just let anything walk
[1:25:49] in and walk out a man who has no control
[1:25:52] over a spirit is like a castle without
[1:25:55] walls or sitting without walls season
[1:25:57] proverbs so if you have no control over
[1:25:59] this you have no defense now your memory
[1:26:04] what memories are coming up in your mind
[1:26:06] are they good memories or bad memories
[1:26:08] we all have both some of us have very
[1:26:11] traumatic memories right some of us do
[1:26:14] some of us but we all have some good
[1:26:16] memory somewhere but if you are feeding
[1:26:21] off bad memories then your imagination
[1:26:25] will start running wild and then what
[1:26:29] your affections are resting upon if
[1:26:31] you're feeding off bad memories then
[1:26:34] your affections will be set on those bad
[1:26:37] memories right are you following me and
[1:26:41] your imagination will be caught up with
[1:26:44] those so what are you thinking on you
[1:26:49] know you know what we should think on
[1:26:51] the day Jesus found you
[1:26:54] that's a good memory that's the best one
[1:26:57] the day Jesus found you is the best one
[1:26:59] the day Jesus redeemed you reveal
[1:27:02] himself to you that was the best day
[1:27:04] hallelujah
[1:27:06] whatever your newborn when you were born
[1:27:08] the second time that birthday is the
[1:27:10] best birthday you should remember that
[1:27:12] one whenever we are all this happened to
[1:27:15] me this happened to me because remember
[1:27:16] this how you feed how these things feed
[1:27:20] you feed on them will actually control
[1:27:22] how you speak to people how you deal
[1:27:24] with people how you are in your life
[1:27:28] depression starts from bad memories
[1:27:31] right and then that spirit comes in and
[1:27:35] then your affections imaginations are
[1:27:37] feeding on that depression amen
[1:27:41] I'm just taking the negative because but
[1:27:43] then we go to the positive
[1:27:45] Allu you 10 years ago in September I met
[1:27:48] him he washed all my sins away I knew
[1:27:51] that I knew that I knew I became a new
[1:27:53] creature holy and he saved me and he
[1:27:56] began to work the work he started he'll
[1:27:59] perfect
[1:28:00] that means I'm silted at the end and
[1:28:02] then makalah receive His Holy Spirit of
[1:28:05] my soul
[1:28:05] I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption
[1:28:07] I'm going in a rapture I wonder what the
[1:28:10] rapture is going to be like it's gonna
[1:28:11] be a sweep and we're gone holy the
[1:28:13] Prophet said that the life and you of
[1:28:15] God will is the powder rapture your soul
[1:28:18] the believer already has the power to go
[1:28:21] glory hallelujah so we're going to
[1:28:24] disappear and then I'm going to be
[1:28:26] dancing on streets of gold I don't I
[1:28:28] wonder what that's gonna be like it's
[1:28:30] gonna be glorious hallelujah I'll be in
[1:28:33] time I'll ever in them holy holy it's
[1:28:36] gonna be wonderful and then he's going
[1:28:37] to come out we should imagine these
[1:28:39] things because one day it won't be an
[1:28:42] imagination we'll be a reality
[1:28:44] hallelujah and it's so glorious because
[1:28:46] you begin to think now I wonder what it
[1:28:48] was like on the day of Pentecost where
[1:28:50] God came down and filled them but then
[1:28:52] you go back to your memory I remember
[1:28:53] being felt so I know what that presence
[1:28:56] was like I know what that experience was
[1:28:57] like because I was there hallelujah I
[1:29:00] wonder was like when Moses parted the
[1:29:02] Red Sea I know what he's patted my Red
[1:29:04] Sea and he and he brought me through in
[1:29:06] the enemy was drowning I danced
[1:29:08] yeah I mean that's why it's so glorious
[1:29:10] this is why this becomes a personal love
[1:29:12] letter because you can identify with the
[1:29:14] acts of God from Genesis to Revelation
[1:29:18] lujah and then and then what does that
[1:29:21] do with your affection Oh Lord you're so
[1:29:22] glorious I love you so much
[1:29:24] your see your fictions are seat on the
[1:29:26] things above hallelujah but then these
[1:29:34] things now this world feeds on
[1:29:37] imagination and affection the world is
[1:29:40] actually very aggressive it bombards us
[1:29:43] whether we like it or not we're

[1:29:58] something wrong with you and the
[1:30:00] pressure comes on I don't fit in no the
[1:30:02] believers never fit in when if they ever

[1:30:56] and their bodies would change young
[1:30:58] again hallelujah and they received the
[1:31:01] promised son hallelujah glory to God so
[1:31:05] now we're all you know we're a we're a
[1:31:07] oddball brother MCS that we're an
[1:31:09] oddball to the world or but in the world
[1:31:12] as an oddball to us I mean they think
[1:31:15] well that well you think we're we're
[1:31:17] weird the world is strange to us why
[1:31:19] can't they just receive it and rejoice
[1:31:21] and shout and be
[1:31:22] believers that hallelujah and why do
[1:31:23] they be steered by all these things just
[1:31:26] walk with God it's way better so we
[1:31:29] think they're on don't you hell yeah
[1:31:33] so now those two feet off each other now
[1:31:37] he says so this isn't the greatest bear
[1:31:40] liver Ford he says what was the matter
[1:31:42] you had to open the channel first the
[1:31:45] devil wants to get in in some way it's
[1:31:49] just like you know before you get
[1:31:52] married you will always still be times
[1:31:55] you always like someone who's with me
[1:31:58] now we're gone quiet liking the opposite
[1:32:02] sex is natural right it's normal you
[1:32:05] built that way we're not robots you
[1:32:08] don't suddenly become a robot in
[1:32:09] something I do and then you get feelings
[1:32:11] then you love no you get them before you
[1:32:14] say I do
[1:32:14] there's got to be have a bit of a spark
[1:32:17] abut a chemistry
[1:32:19] amen amen
[1:32:21] if you don't feel love but you say you
[1:32:24] love you don't love it's just lip
[1:32:26] service something you've learned you got
[1:32:28] to feel it
[1:32:29] love is a feeling hallelujah glory but
[1:32:33] so it's normal to like boys to like
[1:32:36] girls girls like boys it's normal right
[1:32:39] it's normal but then the devil will take
[1:32:42] that and bind you to someone if you open
[1:32:46] yourselves completely to them right
[1:32:49] he'll try and sneer you in with that so
[1:32:52] you've got to guard your heart but it's
[1:32:55] normal to like someone oh but I like
[1:32:57] them you like someone else maybe a
[1:32:58] couple of days later and you won't like
[1:33:00] that person I like this one that's why
[1:33:02] and that's normal but that's why you've
[1:33:06] got to pray a bit when the Lord is that
[1:33:10] one that's a different story
[1:33:12] hallelujah we're here to God amen
[1:33:16] is that okay yep so it's normal to like
[1:33:19] the opposite sex but just because you
[1:33:22] like them doesn't mean they're there
[1:33:23] they're your soul mate and you've just
[1:33:26] got to be careful because then your
[1:33:28] imagination of fishing can begin to run
[1:33:30] wall or you get some attention from
[1:33:31] someone you feel special of course you
[1:33:33] do
[1:33:35] but the devil will take that he comes a
[1:33:39] sucker punch and you find yourself doing
[1:33:42] things work you know that that you'll
[1:33:43] regret later so you gotta be careful but
[1:33:47] the world trying to put it down your
[1:33:49] throat because the world does not show
[1:33:51] people the emotional damage the
[1:33:54] spiritual damage that happens when
[1:33:56] relationships happen outside of marriage
[1:33:59] it doesn't show it doesn't show the
[1:34:01] scars you know I know I've said it
[1:34:03] before but you take Hollywood it just
[1:34:05] shows you this much of the picture
[1:34:07] and this much of the pictures glamor and
[1:34:10] success and money and fame and pleasure
[1:34:12] and things but then if you just pan the
[1:34:14] picture this way there's death drugs
[1:34:18] suicide depression emptiness broken
[1:34:22] marriages all those things but he
[1:34:25] doesn't want you to he never see but
[1:34:27] that see there's the bait you can be
[1:34:29] like this person I don't want to be like
[1:34:31] those people they can do that they could
[1:34:35] have that I've got Jesus I'm a lot
[1:34:37] happier with him because he doesn't
[1:34:39] because with the Christian life see the
[1:34:42] devil wants to show all this person to
[1:34:43] this and this happened this happened but
[1:34:45] then you just got a pen his camera
[1:34:46] eternal life hallelujah streets of gold
[1:34:50] no like a fire Amen so we want to be
[1:34:56] that you know don't you got to guard
[1:35:00] these things now he says what's the
[1:35:05] matter you've got to you had to open the
[1:35:08] channel first so you've got are these
[1:35:09] are gateways and the devil wants to take
[1:35:12] up residence the devil thinks that you
[1:35:14] are his house when a evil spirits cast
[1:35:18] out of a man right if one doesn't drive
[1:35:20] places then it comes back and brings
[1:35:23] seven of its friends finds the place
[1:35:25] swept says I'm gonna return to my abode
[1:35:27] devil thinks that he actually you are
[1:35:30] his dwelling place that's what the devil
[1:35:31] thinks but you're not the dwelling place
[1:35:33] of the devil you are in the place of
[1:35:35] God's rest you're the place of his abaya
[1:35:38] a boat hallelujah so now but he wants to
[1:35:41] get you he wants to get you in he wants
[1:35:44] to let you in I mean he wants you to let
[1:35:46] Herman just like it
[1:35:48] sneer you got to agree with the snare I
[1:35:49] was watching a video of of a bird snare
[1:35:53] and there's these birds and and maybe I
[1:35:56] should have shown it but you know
[1:35:57] there's these birds is the steer on the
[1:35:59] ground look so innocent there's all this
[1:36:01] feed around and they're there they're
[1:36:02] eating this walking around and then some
[1:36:05] of them try to fly away and they're
[1:36:06] caught they can't get out what happened
[1:36:09] they opened they agreed with the bait
[1:36:10] and they got Snead and he wants the
[1:36:13] devil wants you to agree with his bait
[1:36:15] that he will take up residence or he
[1:36:17] will oppress you because if you open a
[1:36:19] door then he's got access and he can he
[1:36:22] can take your memory and beat you down
[1:36:24] it can take your affections your
[1:36:26] imagination your conscious your
[1:36:28] reasoning and beat you down with it
[1:36:29] but then when you let the Lord in he's
[1:36:32] got to be the soldier on the battlefield
[1:36:34] and he's never lost a battle Amen see he
[1:36:39] had to open the channel first one of
[1:36:42] these channels you've got to get the
[1:36:45] soldier the Holy Spirit place at the
[1:36:47] battle front to take God's Word he is
[1:36:49] the word and he stands there and there's
[1:36:51] nothing going to stop him there's
[1:36:53] nothing can every one of the other
[1:36:55] channels is cleared out just like the
[1:36:57] old boiler with the flue stopped up you
[1:36:59] put a fire it'll blow a blow your thing
[1:37:01] up that's what's the matter of so many
[1:37:03] blowed up Christians is because they
[1:37:05] don't clean the channels out they don't
[1:37:07] get down to the inside you've got to
[1:37:09] clean it conscious memory thoughts
[1:37:11] laying aside everything and coming from
[1:37:14] inside out with that unadulterated Word
[1:37:16] of God that it's the truth no matter if
[1:37:19] 10,000 died on this side today
[1:37:24] trusting 10,000 on that side tomorrow
[1:37:26] trusting that has nothing to do with me
[1:37:29] I'm an individual I'm the one that's
[1:37:31] trusting I'm the one that believes it so
[1:37:33] it doesn't matter what happens anyone
[1:37:35] else
[1:37:35] I'm the individual I'm the one believing
[1:37:37] I'm the one trusting right and you see
[1:37:40] back yonder if you want to open up our
[1:37:43] channels then if we can and see and find
[1:37:46] this one in that one and this one and
[1:37:48] that one thousands of them testifying
[1:37:49] but the devil will try and come right
[1:37:52] back
[1:37:53] Olu he's not a gentleman you show him
[1:37:56] the door he doesn't walk out nicely he
[1:37:59] goes out kicking and screaming
[1:38:01] amen but the Holy Ghost binds them up
[1:38:04] kicks them out I mean that's why you
[1:38:07] never say now mr. devil can you leave my
[1:38:09] family alone oh you got to stand on your
[1:38:10] god-given rights you would have
[1:38:12] prevailed in prayer you were talking
[1:38:15] about Wednesday with the errors of
[1:38:16] deliverance keep striking he said I
[1:38:18] don't know how many times our strike you
[1:38:20] say God you strike the arrows threw me
[1:38:22] on the ground until it's done because
[1:38:24] the Lord will say the other battles won
[1:38:26] it's done you know that peace that comes
[1:38:30] when you pray through you understand I
[1:38:31] trust you do amen now he's the one yeah
[1:38:37] but the devil try and come back see if
[1:38:39] he could get in there at all he's got
[1:38:42] your army routed then if he's got your
[1:38:44] census see taste feel smell in here
[1:38:46] they're all right but don't trust in
[1:38:48] them unless they agree with the word
[1:38:50] that's all right but if they agree with
[1:38:52] the word I mean but if they disagree
[1:38:54] with the word rather don't you listen to
[1:38:57] them now imaginations conscious memories
[1:38:59] reasonings affection they're alright if
[1:39:01] they agree with the word that's our
[1:39:04] thing about you know about your your
[1:39:08] thinking being well you're just never
[1:39:09] going to make it that's not agreeing
[1:39:11] with the word Amen but if your but if
[1:39:15] your affection doesn't agree with the
[1:39:16] word get rid of it you blow a flue right
[1:39:19] quick if your reasoning disagrees with
[1:39:21] the would get away from it that's right
[1:39:23] I mean the memory if your imaginations
[1:39:26] if you're conscious anything disagrees
[1:39:28] with that what's on the inside get rid
[1:39:30] of it what you got then you've got a
[1:39:33] solar system hallelujah God set the
[1:39:35] Stars in order and said hang there till
[1:39:37] I call you you they stay there nothing's
[1:39:39] going to move them when God can get a
[1:39:41] man in his hands till he can get his
[1:39:43] senses as conscious everything cleaned
[1:39:45] out until it stands with God behind in
[1:39:48] the in the soul there's not a devil in
[1:39:51] the world can poke a doubt in there
[1:39:53] that's right if he can come round say
[1:39:55] you don't feel any better your
[1:39:56] conscience has even gone to that your
[1:39:58] flus are so cleared out it shouts
[1:40:00] hallelujah the old Liat blows a whistle
[1:40:02] glory to God it sounds out certainly
[1:40:04] it's just as clean and clear for the
[1:40:06] Word of God to work through the power of
[1:40:08] God see it's the main thing there's your
[1:40:10] battle ground your battle ground is back
[1:40:12] here at the beginning back here and the
[1:40:14] spirit back in your
[1:40:15] mind that opens I mean I mean the mind
[1:40:18] is the is the gate to the spirit your
[1:40:20] mind opens up and accepts the spirit or
[1:40:22] rejects the spirit you can't have little
[1:40:25] consciences and little feelings little
[1:40:27] sensations all these things that has
[1:40:29] nothing to do with it it's just a scent
[1:40:31] little sensation and thinks but when it
[1:40:33] really when your mind really opens up
[1:40:35] your mind either accepts it or rejects
[1:40:37] it see the mind of people here either
[1:40:39] accepting what I'm saying or rejecting
[1:40:41] it and one part of ridiculous you're
[1:40:43] thinking about something else because
[1:40:45] the devil comes in I remember when I was
[1:40:47] in a Pentecostal church I never had my
[1:40:48] metal sitting in service but then I went
[1:40:51] to the mrs. Church there's all kind of
[1:40:52] mind bells going on give was trying to
[1:40:54] Oh next weekend tomorrow and you've got
[1:40:56] to do this and what about this and this
[1:40:57] person did this and you're just going to
[1:40:59] say shut up I'm listening be quiet
[1:41:03] quiet in the cheap seats I'm listening
[1:41:06] that's what you got to do you don't get
[1:41:08] a silence that voice
[1:41:09] be quiet devil I'm listening to the Word
[1:41:12] of God because it's got rap string faith
[1:41:14] for me it's not for you
[1:41:16] maybe if you listened to it in the
[1:41:17] beginning you would have stayed where
[1:41:18] you should have been right so of course
[1:41:22] you live mind battles but just just come
[1:41:26] don't worry about tomorrow and what
[1:41:29] about this at all your imagination is
[1:41:30] running wild don't pull it down pull it
[1:41:33] down because this way you come in those
[1:41:36] doors start swirling hundred miles an
[1:41:38] hour then you leave the doors now it
[1:41:39] goes back to normal
[1:41:40] and it happens next Sunday and next
[1:41:42] Wednesday it just repeats and you've
[1:41:45] just really found yourself I've been
[1:41:47] sitting in here but never been here you
[1:41:49] don't just want to be present and body
[1:41:51] you want to be present and spirit and
[1:41:52] body amen
[1:41:54] that's what I'd do if I was you amen
[1:41:58] because it's your soul ultimately what
[1:42:00] do you want to get out of God what do
[1:42:02] you want amen I want him I want
[1:42:06] everything he has for me I want to see
[1:42:08] it live I don't just want to talk about
[1:42:10] it I don't just want to stand over
[1:42:11] Jordan shouting saying the land is there
[1:42:13] I want every part of the land I want to
[1:42:15] take not just take Jericho the seals
[1:42:17] opened up the lands oh but I'll take
[1:42:19] every part of the promised land
[1:42:20] I want all the joy there is all the
[1:42:22] peace all the long-suffering on the
[1:42:24] character of Christ I want his divine
[1:42:25] nature in me I want
[1:42:27] caps I want the cap said of divine love
[1:42:29] upon my life with faith faith and virtue
[1:42:31] of patience meekness brotherly Titus all
[1:42:33] those things I want that manifested in
[1:42:35] me that's what I want I want the Holy
[1:42:37] Spirit to come and manifest those
[1:42:39] virtues in my life don't you want to be
[1:42:41] made in His image to be like Jesus
[1:42:44] oh all I want to be is be like him who
[1:42:48] wants to be like Jesus who wants to be
[1:42:51] made in His image look that's why he
[1:42:52] died on Calvary - making people in His
[1:42:54] image
[1:42:55] that's why seeing a transforming word
[1:42:57] the power of transformations and this
[1:42:58] message that you'll be transformed made
[1:43:00] into his image I want to be like that
[1:43:02] oh if he's done that why say well I'll
[1:43:04] just do it what you're why not why not
[1:43:07] become like him I'd rather become like
[1:43:10] him than become like the devil because
[1:43:12] the devil has nothing to give to me Allu
[1:43:15] you he's on the ever had brokenness and
[1:43:19] disappointment heartache sorrow and pain
[1:43:22] and regret that's all he's given his
[1:43:24] people and he uses them and he just
[1:43:27] throws them to one side and then he and
[1:43:30] he passes anointing down to someone else
[1:43:32] that's not how God works God takes his
[1:43:35] bride fills her with his love redeems
[1:43:40] her and then once they're done once he's
[1:43:43] used her on the earth to manifest
[1:43:45] himself she goes up into glory
[1:43:47] hallelujah and then now she's waiting
[1:43:50] for the rest of the bride to come to her
[1:43:51] their position and then we're all going
[1:43:53] to be there
[1:43:54] hallelujah so we're not just at all like
[1:43:57] the devil uses people he just throws
[1:43:59] them in the trash no we're not that kind
[1:44:01] of people your your God's joy your God's
[1:44:05] purchased position you're his treasure
[1:44:07] you're his jewel in his crown hallelujah
[1:44:10] that's what you are to God amen
[1:44:14] no it was I so now he says see you
[1:44:22] either accept your mind or either
[1:44:23] accepts it or a jig so that's it friends
[1:44:25] God let none of them miss it see it's
[1:44:28] your mind that opens up the door closes
[1:44:30] the door and listens to your conscious
[1:44:32] listens to your memory listens to your
[1:44:33] affections but when your mind closes
[1:44:35] itself to these things and let God the
[1:44:38] spirit of us would come in it blows the
[1:44:40] rest
[1:44:41] to the stuff out hallelujah every doubt
[1:44:44] has gone every fear is gone every
[1:44:45] sensation of doubt is gone every feeling
[1:44:48] is gone there's nothing standing there
[1:44:49] but the Word of God and Satan cannot
[1:44:52] battle against that no sir
[1:44:53] he cannot battle against it now we know
[1:44:56] its truth these battles have raged since
[1:44:59] the days of the Garden of Eden the
[1:45:00] battles and the my human mind Satan
[1:45:02] started it what did he do when he met
[1:45:04] Eve he didn't deny God's Word but he
[1:45:07] whitewashed it amen and he's whitewashed
[1:45:11] it in this day God's a good God it's all
[1:45:14] grace grace is a divine nature a divine
[1:45:17] of influence upon the heart and its
[1:45:18] reflection in the life go look at the
[1:45:20] Bible definition of New Testament grace
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:25] I'm glad we found grace in his sight
[1:45:28] Evan say think and and we know through
[1:45:33] these battles of rage buddies
[1:45:35] whitewashed it
[1:45:36] he stopped up some little channels here
[1:45:39] some day said surely God surely you
[1:45:41] won't die but he knowed the wood was
[1:45:44] right but he but he knowed he couldn't
[1:45:46] just come right out and blast it away so
[1:45:48] he sugar-coated it that's what he does
[1:45:51] now the first time I just hurry through
[1:45:55] this let's go let's just jump forward a
[1:45:58] bit now in Psalms 26 now no I want to
[1:46:02] leave this up here
[1:46:02] Sam's 26 1 2 3 says judge me O Lord for
[1:46:08] I've walked in mine integrity I have
[1:46:10] trusted also in the Lord therefore I
[1:46:11] shall not slide examine me O Lord and
[1:46:14] prove me try the reins of my heart for
[1:46:18] thy loving-kindness is before my eyes
[1:46:20] and I have walked in my truth now the
[1:46:23] reins when he talks about the reins and
[1:46:25] our brother and he brought this out in
[1:46:26] the subconscious serious that he did but
[1:46:28] the reins drive just like you know
[1:46:31] there's a rider on a horse they have the
[1:46:33] reins of the horse and they drive where
[1:46:36] the horse should go amen
[1:46:39] so now the reins of your heart is what
[1:46:42] whatever takes the reins of your heart
[1:46:44] is where you're going to go so if the
[1:46:46] Holy Ghost is in you and he's taking
[1:46:49] control of your life he's got his hands
[1:46:52] on the reins and
[1:46:54] now driving you I'm glad to be his his
[1:46:57] noble steed if I look like a donkey but
[1:47:00] his noble steed I mean you know but but
[1:47:03] but he takes a hole but then the thing
[1:47:05] is you have to agree with him to take
[1:47:08] the reins you've got a surrender the
[1:47:10] reins over to him and then he takes them
[1:47:12] but then if you begin to agree with the
[1:47:14] devil just like I said about depression
[1:47:16] bad memories feeding into depression and
[1:47:19] those things what's happened that's
[1:47:21] taking the reins of your life and you
[1:47:23] begin to be something that you weren't
[1:47:25] before that happened to you amen so now
[1:47:29] you don't want to so you got to see what
[1:47:31] takes what takes the reins of your heart
[1:47:34] now this this world as man's imagination
[1:47:38] is running wild
[1:47:39] today this day's full of superheroes
[1:47:43] cosplay Hollywood works on captivating
[1:47:46] the imagination of the people this is
[1:47:49] what the devil tries to work through
[1:47:51] through the eyes to capture your
[1:47:53] imagination that's what he's trying to
[1:47:55] do and then so if we can do that then
[1:47:57] he'll steer you the way he wants you to
[1:48:00] be steered and it's never a good place
[1:48:02] the world has become a fantasy world no
[1:48:07] one wants to live in this reality very
[1:48:09] few are happy with just living in this
[1:48:12] rally they all have an escape right it's
[1:48:15] either because they cannot handle
[1:48:17] everyday life that's why people bury
[1:48:20] themselves and pleasures and drugs and
[1:48:22] entertainment or a hobby because they're
[1:48:25] trying to escape this present world amen
[1:48:30] that's why people bury themselves on the
[1:48:32] internet it's called the World Wide Web
[1:48:35] it's a snare it's sent to steer people
[1:48:39] the World Wide Web right and you have
[1:48:43] you ever watched something land on a
[1:48:45] spider's web and the more it moves the
[1:48:49] more it attracts the attention of the
[1:48:50] spider and so what happens is you know
[1:48:54] the problem is we have this I can be in
[1:48:57] heavenly places or I can be in the very
[1:49:00] depths of Satan's Eden and he'll just
[1:49:03] with a swipe it's very easy to do and
[1:49:07] I'll be and that
[1:49:08] affect me you saw all those things don't
[1:49:10] affect me well you're a robot you're in
[1:49:13] self-denial oh I can look at Hollywood
[1:49:16] and all the violence and all the sex and
[1:49:17] all those things that are wrong it
[1:49:19] doesn't I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:49:20] no it'll affect you it sure will be
[1:49:24] searing your conscience and it will
[1:49:26] prevent your imagination you can't
[1:49:29] because we're all human the only
[1:49:31] difference between you and the guy on
[1:49:33] the street is the Holy Ghost in your
[1:49:34] life when you're both we all have the
[1:49:37] same five senses we all have the same
[1:49:39] gate yo gates into the spirit realm but
[1:49:42] the difference is the Lord has taken up
[1:49:44] residence and he's made you a new
[1:49:46] creature right so you you got to be
[1:49:50] looking at qibla what you look at
[1:49:52] because this whole world you know we are
[1:49:56] the most drugged up society has ever
[1:49:58] been you say well I've never taken any
[1:50:01] illegal drug I've never even taken a
[1:50:03] drink or smoked a cigarette social media
[1:50:07] in this world is the same effects
[1:50:09] because it fills you with dopamine it's
[1:50:12] instant pleasure who's ever looked into
[1:50:15] it it's an instant pleasure because
[1:50:17] that's why people feed off it so much is
[1:50:19] because it produces the chemical
[1:50:20] dopamine in your body which makes you
[1:50:22] feel happy and you become addicted to it
[1:50:25] and that's why people get Internet
[1:50:27] addiction right because they're feeding
[1:50:30] off that thing they're an addict that's
[1:50:32] why I think it's what should be in this
[1:50:34] country too but overseas they have rehab
[1:50:36] centers four four four internet gamers
[1:50:39] because they get so addicted their whole
[1:50:41] life is caught up in the thing they need
[1:50:43] to actually go cold turkey they need a
[1:50:46] rehabilitation program to get off that
[1:50:48] screen get off that game and become a
[1:50:50] normal person again it's a drug
[1:50:55] same with movies music whatever it may
[1:50:59] be there's a spirit behind it many
[1:51:02] people do not see this they don't see
[1:51:03] the sneer those just see the bird feed
[1:51:05] and their body craves it because Satan
[1:51:09] knows how you're built I mean God knows
[1:51:11] how you built - and his spirit is far
[1:51:14] more powerful than any work of the enemy
[1:51:16] right you may be caught in a snare today
[1:51:18] he can break the snare he
[1:51:20] and set you free right so I don't want
[1:51:22] you to sit there saying well I'm stuck
[1:51:24] I'm stuck now you don't have the me
[1:51:25] start call upon the name of the Lord you
[1:51:27] shall be save you show me deliver it
[1:51:29] hallelujah don't have the Sydney with us
[1:51:31] there you've seen a you know you don't
[1:51:33] have to just sit back and say well I've
[1:51:35] been trapped we've all been trapped by
[1:51:37] something even pride and your walk with
[1:51:40] God can be a snare where self probably
[1:51:43] well I'm just the best message person
[1:51:45] who's ever been in the face of the earth
[1:51:47] you know that's pride you're actually
[1:51:49] you worshiping yourself
[1:51:51] that's a snare God can you someone who's
[1:51:54] proud and they walk with God it should
[1:51:56] make us more humble Oh Lord you would
[1:51:59] reveal yourself to me of all people
[1:52:01] you'd come down and say Here I am I'm
[1:52:04] your Redeemer hello you're part of me
[1:52:06] that should make you so humble I'm going
[1:52:09] to tell God comes down since I'm going
[1:52:10] to tell you secrets their prophets
[1:52:12] looked into you you know I think I read
[1:52:15] it last Sunday or whenever it was Daniel
[1:52:17] was praying when are these things gonna
[1:52:19] be I don't think it was just a just a
[1:52:23] Lord Jesus Oh almighty Almighty God
[1:52:26] Jehovah can you tell me when these
[1:52:28] visions are gonna be fulfilled amen
[1:52:29] and walk on he would have earnestly been
[1:52:32] pray I want to know when is this going
[1:52:34] to happen he just saw the vision from
[1:52:36] the time to the end when's it gonna
[1:52:38] happen he would have been earnestly
[1:52:39] seeking God Lord I want to know and God
[1:52:42] says no it's not for you to know and
[1:52:44] then God comes to you the things he
[1:52:47] wanted to see and all the prophets I'll
[1:52:49] tell you well the RAM comes across a
[1:52:51] mystery God revealed I'm gonna tell you
[1:52:53] what was in the back parts of God's mind
[1:52:54] before the from the foundation of the
[1:52:56] world that many who had a longing to
[1:52:59] know and here he comes he says I'm going
[1:53:01] to tell you it because God gives it to
[1:53:02] him and then you just press play and it
[1:53:05] becomes more than a sermon it quickens
[1:53:07] to you becomes alive though I was
[1:53:09] revealing what he sang to you you hear
[1:53:11] what he's actually saying in your soul
[1:53:12] he quickens it to you and many people
[1:53:14] wanted to see it and they weren't privy
[1:53:15] to it hallelujah isn't that wonderful
[1:53:18] for you say it's not fair God's
[1:53:21] sovereign people actually do not
[1:53:22] understand God is sovereign
[1:53:24] no one is his adviser he redeems too he
[1:53:29] will he quickens who he will he saves
[1:53:31] her he will he raptures who he will it's
[1:53:34] his prerogative and no one can say why
[1:53:36] did you do that he says because I said
[1:53:38] so
[1:53:39] I'm the final court of law I'm the
[1:53:41] supreme judge I do what I want
[1:53:43] Oh Luke and that's why I'm so glad he
[1:53:46] found me because he chose me there's a
[1:53:49] reason he saved you
[1:53:50] you have a purpose upon the earth amen
[1:53:53] No
[1:53:53] so people who get hooked up on things
[1:53:56] because they're trying to escape this
[1:53:58] present world see it all feeds on these
[1:54:00] imagination affection and memory
[1:54:02] don't be an addict whatever you do be an
[1:54:04] addict of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:54:07] whatever you do you say well I'm not
[1:54:11] hooked up on some drug but then what
[1:54:13] about yuning to go back to a simpler
[1:54:15] time of life that's why the devil can
[1:54:18] use our memory and I know this is very
[1:54:19] true
[1:54:20] I've battled through this you yearn for
[1:54:23] a simpler time of life is it either just
[1:54:27] me now some of you look at me like what
[1:54:31] are you talking about no we all yearn
[1:54:33] don't you and then you see people who
[1:54:35] like you know they live off the land
[1:54:37] they go off the grid and they grow all
[1:54:39] this stuff and they have and and
[1:54:40] something in you says wouldn't that be
[1:54:42] nice because it's simpler but the only
[1:54:44] reason you yearn for it is because you
[1:54:45] want a simpler time of life then what
[1:54:48] happens now as you begin living and not
[1:54:51] reality because your yearning for
[1:54:54] something that's not where you are right
[1:54:56] now
[1:54:56] oh yeah isn't that right so we so we
[1:55:00] don't want to be caught up in something
[1:55:01] that we do not have well you know in the
[1:55:06] world people chase money they chase all
[1:55:07] kinds of things and I think when they
[1:55:09] get that then know that they've arrived
[1:55:11] and they find they're still in the same
[1:55:12] place who has ever climbed a mountain
[1:55:14] and you climb a root you see a ridge you
[1:55:17] think that's the summit and you get to
[1:55:18] that Ridge and then it's like five more
[1:55:20] ridges pass there who's ever who's ever
[1:55:22] did that this is that's how the world is
[1:55:26] they say I just need to get here and
[1:55:28] they get there and they realize no they
[1:55:31] haven't really got anywhere because this
[1:55:36] has been anointed see it's your imagined
[1:55:41] so and then what happens if people so if
[1:55:44] they if they have you ever longed for a
[1:55:46] simpler way of life or they want
[1:55:48] to escape into a hobby or go live on a
[1:55:50] desert island or something that becomes
[1:55:53] the center of their lives and they
[1:55:55] become living they may be president body
[1:55:57] but they're not president spirit because
[1:56:00] their mind is often in another place and
[1:56:02] they actually neglect what's actually
[1:56:04] there in front of them today is the best
[1:56:07] day of my life
[1:56:10] hallelu cos God all day this is a day
[1:56:12] the Lord has made I will rejoice and be
[1:56:14] glad in it
[1:56:15] this is whatever conditioner and it's
[1:56:17] the best day of your life because this
[1:56:19] is where God wants you to be now just
[1:56:21] like Israel they came out of Egypt that
[1:56:23] was a great day that's not the day but
[1:56:25] then they went through a whole bunch of
[1:56:27] stuff every day was better than the
[1:56:29] previous day because if God wanted to
[1:56:31] keep them on the one side the Red Sea
[1:56:33] they would have stayed there but they to
[1:56:35] continue in their journey same thing
[1:56:38] with us so don't let your imagination so
[1:56:41] that that thing that people so if you're
[1:56:43] caught up in something that becomes the
[1:56:45] center of your life and that's your
[1:56:47] imagination leading you brother branham
[1:56:49] after the opening of the word opening of
[1:56:51] the seals because of the rejection and
[1:56:53] the strain and the hurt that it caused
[1:56:56] he wanted to move his family up to
[1:56:58] northern British Columbia become a guide
[1:57:00] and whenever God would tell him to tell
[1:57:02] him something he'd just stomp out the
[1:57:03] world and say thus saith the Lord then
[1:57:04] go back cuz he always wanted to be a
[1:57:07] hunter so now in his mind this is what
[1:57:11] he wanted to be because of hurt now I'm
[1:57:14] gonna hurry through this last bit but
[1:57:15] it's because of hurt those things begin
[1:57:18] to happen because he was rejected Christ
[1:57:21] himself was made known mysteries of the
[1:57:24] word had become open and he said and
[1:57:27] even see what he's preaching it
[1:57:28] thousands of my friends will leave me
[1:57:30] because of this and they did and it hurt
[1:57:33] him cuz he's a man he's an adopted son
[1:57:35] of God he received God molded him
[1:57:37] through many things to receive the word
[1:57:40] in his hand to preach the dispensation
[1:57:43] of gospel for the end time so he's an
[1:57:45] adopted son of God but yet things that
[1:57:48] happened to him affected him and he lost
[1:57:51] his love for the people because of it so
[1:57:52] I'm saying just because we have the Holy
[1:57:54] Ghost we may be adopted in our place in
[1:57:56] the body doesn't mean we're not immune
[1:57:58] to these things amen
[1:58:01] but then the Lord dealt with him and
[1:58:04] then you know he went back on the field
[1:58:07] he got his love back for the people no
[1:58:12] see it's here and Luke for how he how
[1:58:16] was everyone how are you because you
[1:58:20] can't talk for the person x3 how are you
[1:58:21] guys doing you good how are you can I
[1:58:23] continue do you mind do you yourself
[1:58:25] mind because I want to bring this to the
[1:58:27] end now Luke 4 it says and there were
[1:58:29] delivered unto Him the book of the
[1:58:31] prophet Isaiah
[1:58:32] so remember the wounding listen the
[1:58:34] wounding in the spirit is far worse than
[1:58:36] the wounding in the body right because
[1:58:39] you can you can be a but yet
[1:58:41] rejoice right but if you're a in
[1:58:44] your spirit that's a lot worse you can
[1:58:46] have full function of your body but if
[1:58:47] you're hurt and wounded in your spirit
[1:58:49] then you won't be able to rejoice and
[1:58:51] serve the kingdom serve the Lord like
[1:58:53] you could do so the wounding in here is
[1:58:56] where we need the Lord Jesus really to
[1:58:59] come right and so he says now this and
[1:59:03] there was delivered unto him the book of
[1:59:04] the prophet Isaiah and when he had
[1:59:06] opened the book he found the place where
[1:59:07] it was written the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:59:09] upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:59:12] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:59:14] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:59:15] preach deliverance to the captives and
[1:59:17] the recovering of the sites of the blind
[1:59:19] and to sit at liberty them that are
[1:59:21] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[1:59:24] the Lord and he closed the book and gave
[1:59:26] it again to the minister and sat down in
[1:59:28] the eyes of all that are in the
[1:59:29] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[1:59:31] began to say unto them this day this day
[1:59:33] as the scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:59:36] so when the Son of Man Jesus Christ the
[1:59:38] Son of man when he came into his
[1:59:40] ministry this was his ministry to to
[1:59:44] heal the brokenhearted preach at liberty
[1:59:46] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:59:48] and their covering at a sight to the
[1:59:50] blind to see it at liberty them that are
[1:59:52] bruised this is the ministry of the son
[1:59:54] of man right
[1:59:56] and that same ministry has repeated in
[1:59:58] the same time I mean this day the
[2:00:00] scripture is fulfilled
[2:00:01] hallelujah where God would come again
[2:00:03] with the same Ministry of the anointing
[2:00:06] would come hallelujah that people would
[2:00:09] be sit at Liberty that are bruised their
[2:00:12] site would be recovered they would be
[2:00:14] delivered that a captive
[2:00:15] he'd heal the brokenhearted that's what
[2:00:17] the message does that's what the message
[2:00:20] does hallelujah we have the medicine
[2:00:23] hallelujah hallelujah Amen we have where
[2:00:27] dr. Moses's medicine kit I'm the law of
[2:00:30] the hills all thy diseases amen
[2:00:32] so now so I'll just leave it up there
[2:00:35] not to be broken the wood so
[2:00:37] brokenhearted so to heal the
[2:00:39] brokenhearted so broken it means to
[2:00:44] crush completely that is to shatter to
[2:00:47] break in pieces broken to shivers to
[2:00:50] bruise and the heart is the thoughts or
[2:00:54] the feelings it's the mind so this can
[2:00:57] be broken this can be shattered right
[2:01:00] there can be shattered this can be
[2:01:03] broken to a million pieces but the Lord
[2:01:07] said I'm here to heal the brokenhearted
[2:01:09] that if your memories broken it's fixed
[2:01:14] on one thing he can healed it your
[2:01:16] affections are on the world on not him
[2:01:18] he can healed it your imaginations
[2:01:20] always negative against people different
[2:01:22] things negative about yourself brother
[2:01:25] and when he came to a time when he's
[2:01:27] dedicating himself again to the Lord he
[2:01:29] sees a Lord I surrender my negative
[2:01:31] thoughts amen
[2:01:33] the Lord can heal that your conscience
[2:01:36] is gone you have no alarm bell your
[2:01:39] reasoning is gone your reasoning has
[2:01:41] walked he can put that back together oh
[2:01:45] I'm glad he meant deliverance to the
[2:01:49] captives is more than just being captive
[2:01:52] to sin he says this in God's provided
[2:01:56] way 1953 and he sit and he sit down like
[2:02:00] that his weary eyes rolled over looked
[2:02:02] around and I thought oh god that's a
[2:02:04] heavenly Birds he's talking about an
[2:02:05] eagle and a cage though I thought oh god
[2:02:07] that's a heavenly birdie soars in the
[2:02:09] heavens above
[2:02:10] here he is court he fell into a trap
[2:02:12] he's absolutely helpless he can't
[2:02:14] deliver himself his weary eyes rolling
[2:02:16] around I felt so sorry for him he can't
[2:02:19] help himself and every man that's fell
[2:02:21] into the snare of the devil is worse off
[2:02:23] than him you're a heavenly being you're
[2:02:26] supposed to be a son of God you're free
[2:02:28] brother
[2:02:29] got liberty in Christ Jesus believing
[2:02:31] God loving God living free from sin free
[2:02:34] living free from death that's right
[2:02:37] but how the devil has caught you and
[2:02:39] catch you up with smoking now listen to
[2:02:42] this list because the first part we
[2:02:43] think well that's that's obvious it's a
[2:02:45] cage case you're above smoking drinking
[2:02:48] all kinds of immoral living and thinking
[2:02:51] you're popular thinking you're doing
[2:02:53] something so we can be thinking we're
[2:02:57] doing something and we're actually just
[2:02:59] on a hamster treadmill trying to be
[2:03:03] thinking you're popular thinking you're
[2:03:05] doing something that can be a snare or a
[2:03:09] cage you're following me when you think
[2:03:12] about it because we can be led this is
[2:03:17] the deception comes in the devil used
[2:03:20] scripture in the beginning that was
[2:03:22] perverted but he used 99% of a verse and
[2:03:26] it brought death now we can be caught up
[2:03:29] in things that appear to be the truth
[2:03:32] appear to be the Word of God and our
[2:03:36] fictions are set upon it because we want
[2:03:38] to serve Him but actually it's a cage I
[2:03:41] want you to think about it
[2:03:43] now the Lord is the soldier on the
[2:03:47] battlefield there's nothing wrong and I
[2:03:50] think it's very good from time to time
[2:03:51] say search me O Lord try my ways examine
[2:03:55] my goings right am i busy serving you or
[2:04:00] am i busy serving myself or something
[2:04:02] I've formed that has nothing and the
[2:04:05] devil's got me on some Segway someplace
[2:04:10] amen
[2:04:11] because that's a cage God doesn't want
[2:04:14] us in no cage friends the cage is not
[2:04:16] our place of residence hallelujah the
[2:04:19] heavens are our place of residence I
[2:04:22] mean that's the great thing horrible
[2:04:24] sight to see that poor Eagle beating his
[2:04:26] brains out nearly against the cage
[2:04:28] trying to get free in your helpless just
[2:04:30] as helpless as you can be and this
[2:04:31] somebody puts forth his hands and opens
[2:04:34] the cage and I'll tell you tonight Jesus
[2:04:37] Christ has done that and calling you
[2:04:38] that's right open the cage to let you
[2:04:40] out hallelujah so
[2:04:42] we can we can be captive and trying to
[2:04:45] prove that God is leading us yep
[2:04:49] we don't need to prove anything I have
[2:04:52] nothing to prove God does the proving
[2:04:55] right the devil comes all you really
[2:04:57] think you're the bride you really
[2:04:58] thinking what we intruder I'll just put
[2:05:02] you through to the right caller you're
[2:05:04] you've got the wrong office
[2:05:06] I'll put you through to my my god my
[2:05:09] husband you talk to him about it because
[2:05:12] I'm not here to prove anything he does
[2:05:13] the proving he doesn't living
[2:05:15] he's the Christian hallelujah isn't that
[2:05:18] right so we don't have to be captive to
[2:05:20] try and prove that God is leading us God
[2:05:22] does the prove it right we can be kept
[2:05:25] of trying to prove someone else is
[2:05:26] either right or wrong but don't build
[2:05:29] your life around an opinion of somebody
[2:05:32] build your life around the Lord Jesus
[2:05:34] Christ his word because at the end of
[2:05:36] the day what is it to thee this happened
[2:05:39] this this this this is this today on the
[2:05:41] news what about it how does this am I
[2:05:45] going to stand your think am I gonna
[2:05:47] stand on the day of judgment with all
[2:05:48] this stuff right no it's gonna be me I'm
[2:05:53] not gonna stand with all these people
[2:05:54] did all these things supposedly or or
[2:05:56] really that's irrelevant to me right
[2:06:00] it's just asking God now this is in life
[2:06:04] as the healer I just got a little bit
[2:06:05] more brother Brown here so so in this
[2:06:07] quote to see it at liberty them that are
[2:06:09] bruised it's not just a it's a bruise in
[2:06:12] your spirit that can't hold us captive
[2:06:15] right because of wounding where did
[2:06:18] Jesus get his wounds in the house of his
[2:06:20] friends this is the house of our friends
[2:06:25] right the world can do bad things just
[2:06:27] as we say well Lord Father forgive them
[2:06:29] they don't know what they do but then
[2:06:30] when it comes to the realms of believers
[2:06:32] that's where it cuts the deepest amen so
[2:06:37] and then and and we can receive a
[2:06:40] wounding and or a bruise rather in our
[2:06:42] spirit and then now what happens is just
[2:06:45] like in a natural and a natural Bruce
[2:06:47] brother brain speaks about this now no
[2:06:50] he's talking about cancer coming in but
[2:06:51] take it to the spiritual because if
[2:06:53] there's a if there's a wounding in here
[2:06:56] and the devil can come in and then he
[2:06:58] can begin to grow
[2:06:59] now then unnatural things on the earth
[2:07:02] types of spiritual or cancer would be a
[2:07:05] scavenger like the buzz that eats dead
[2:07:07] things cancer usually comes from a Bruce
[2:07:09] the Bruce first is bruised and you're
[2:07:12] full of little cells and one of those
[2:07:14] little cells get smashed in at
[2:07:15] backslides
[2:07:16] then the first there's a life not the
[2:07:18] life that there that was there another
[2:07:20] life comes in where did he come from
[2:07:22] think of it it's not complicated where'd
[2:07:24] he come from the devil and he takes into
[2:07:26] that the devil cannot create nothing the
[2:07:28] devil only perverts he can't create he
[2:07:31] prevents in the first he has to have a
[2:07:33] way you ask the doctor if your body was
[2:07:36] perfect and like God made in the
[2:07:38] beginning it would be impossible to get
[2:07:39] sick but the God I mean sorry but the
[2:07:42] devil has to find a weakness somewhere
[2:07:44] to pervert a weakness we all have a
[2:07:49] weakness right and the devil's looking
[2:07:53] for the weakness God knows where your
[2:07:55] weaknesses right he doesn't make us
[2:07:59] super people out of weakness were made
[2:08:02] strong because we are sheep sheep always
[2:08:06] need a shepherd you can be a just a born
[2:08:09] lamb or you can be the most mature Ram
[2:08:11] of the flock or you or whatever it is
[2:08:12] you still need the shepherd we will
[2:08:15] never come to a day where we don't need
[2:08:16] him amen and the more you mature I trust
[2:08:20] the more you've come to an understanding
[2:08:21] I need you more more than yesterday
[2:08:24] right so we always because we all have a
[2:08:27] weakness we'll have a weak spot in our
[2:08:29] in our character our nature and the
[2:08:32] devil's looking for it but by prayer and
[2:08:35] being surrendered to the Lord that
[2:08:37] week's book can be covered our God is
[2:08:40] greater than the I know I'm talking
[2:08:41] about the devil a lot but I want you
[2:08:42] understand there's nothing the devil can
[2:08:44] do against you I mean that can be
[2:08:46] victorious there's nothing that God
[2:08:48] cannot conquer because he's already
[2:08:49] conquered at all oh so now so the first
[2:08:54] thing there's a life of a siege but the
[2:08:57] devil has to find a weakness some way to
[2:08:59] pervert that's the same thing with your
[2:09:01] sole reason you don't believe in divine
[2:09:03] healing the devil's found a weak spot in
[2:09:05] you and he perverted it God is the
[2:09:07] healer and what offsprings of God's sons
[2:09:09] and daughters have
[2:09:09] believing it's like our Father believe
[2:09:12] notice this little cell it was a Bruce
[2:09:14] and then a life come into that little
[2:09:16] Bruce the cell backs slid
[2:09:18] he says that's a big word for a back for
[2:09:21] a Baptist to say but it did anyhow and
[2:09:23] it back slid and the devil put a German
[2:09:26] there called cancer a tumor whatever it
[2:09:27] may be and they begin to develop cells
[2:09:29] and he begins to suck on your blood and
[2:09:32] what's that he does he eats you up by
[2:09:35] pulling your blood and what does the
[2:09:38] doctor - the doctor cuts that out if
[2:09:40] there's one little speck left it'll live
[2:09:42] on now divine healing doesn't so much as
[2:09:45] take away that growth divine healing
[2:09:46] deals with the devil that's inside of us
[2:09:49] the germinal life now you know where you
[2:09:51] come from through a holy wedlock by the
[2:09:54] will of God which God promised but the
[2:09:56] German there that's in you it doesn't
[2:09:57] belong in you your germ your germs our
[2:10:00] life germs that's a germ of death which
[2:10:03] would be country to life but how could
[2:10:06] it be a blessing how could God take the
[2:10:08] devil to be a blessing to you how could
[2:10:10] God show his love to you if people say
[2:10:13] he he does it through strike you down
[2:10:14] with disease let the devil do it and we
[2:10:17] know that sickness is an attribute of
[2:10:19] sin before you have we had any sickness
[2:10:22] or sin we had no sickness how can a man
[2:10:24] preach salvation how can you deal with
[2:10:27] sin in any manner without dealing with
[2:10:29] sickness you cannot do it we always
[2:10:31] preach on sin and call it sin just like
[2:10:34] a big animal had me with us poor in my
[2:10:36] side pulling my ribs out there is no
[2:10:38] need of cutting his poor off just hit
[2:10:40] him in the head it kills the whole body
[2:10:42] and when Jesus had sin he killed every
[2:10:45] attribute that sin ever produced so you
[2:10:47] can't deal without sin without dealing
[2:10:49] without sickness notice this German
[2:10:52] start developing cells where did it come
[2:10:53] from a life in there
[2:10:54] developing itself going on grow and grow
[2:10:57] and growing the back of it is a life the
[2:11:00] life is not God there is only two soft
[2:11:03] resources of life can come it's either
[2:11:05] God or from the devil right the and
[2:11:08] there's only two major spirits God in
[2:11:10] the devil and God gave you life here on
[2:11:12] earth and the devil comes and takes it
[2:11:13] away from you and the cancer is a devil
[2:11:16] the life and there is the devil and what
[2:11:18] Jesus said in my name they shall cast
[2:11:19] out devils what does that take the life
[2:11:21] out now here's where the
[2:11:23] this of so-called Christianity fails to
[2:11:25] receive the healing today they're
[2:11:27] looking at the lump instead of looking
[2:11:29] at what God said
[2:11:30] could you imagine a farmer planting his
[2:11:32] corn and going out every day digs it up
[2:11:34] see to see if it will grow or not he'll
[2:11:36] never have a crop he commits it to the
[2:11:38] earth under this that God promised and
[2:11:40] that settles it that's the way we
[2:11:42] receive every word of God because it's
[2:11:43] the seed and we receive it in our heart
[2:11:45] and commit it to God and forget about it
[2:11:47] God does the rest of it because he
[2:11:48] promised he would gods would in every
[2:11:51] word will produce just exactly what it
[2:11:52] is for the words a seed hallelujah so
[2:11:57] the devil begins to cover he comes in
[2:11:59] here he's like a cancer and he grows but
[2:12:02] the Lord is the great physician
[2:12:04] hallelujah he's here he's here to heal
[2:12:07] of us
[2:12:08] anything that's why the anointing is
[2:12:10] here the spoon Lord is in this place to
[2:12:12] sit at liberty them that are bruised
[2:12:14] recover the sight to the blind bind up
[2:12:16] the brokenhearted sit at liberty them
[2:12:18] that are bruised those that are captive
[2:12:20] those that are bound hallelujah that we
[2:12:23] don't need we don't need to have the
[2:12:25] devil in our spirit realm hallelujah but
[2:12:29] there I trust is that soldier on the
[2:12:31] battlefield that whenever the enemy
[2:12:33] comes in like a flood the water God
[2:12:35] raises a standard Amen comes on your
[2:12:37] mind it's who you give yourself to
[2:12:38] that's the one that will have victory
[2:12:41] hallelujah Amen shall we stay in this
[2:12:45] morning

[2:12:49] leave with that I trust your mind
[2:12:54] doesn't look like this today but it
[2:12:57] looks like a place that's full of green
[2:12:58] pastures still waters and his life amen

[2:13:07] snare of the Fowler the snare is broken

[2:30:33] from You Lord father

[2:31:11] [Music]
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:34:07] the cross of Calvary
[2:34:11] yes
[2:34:14] is wrong
[2:34:17] in the sea of God's forgetful
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:34:31] your brother Isaac um so you know we all
[2:34:36] doing the play and we had a bit of a
[2:34:37] meeting halfway through and we we kind
[2:34:40] of need some help to get this play all
[2:34:42] done it was started officer as a Sunday
[2:34:45] school play and it now involved into a
[2:34:48] play that we're doing at Christmastime
[2:34:50] for people of the public as well they
[2:34:52] can come in and have a look at the play
[2:34:54] at the st. that way we usually go to
[2:34:57] Stokes Valley community center so
[2:35:00] there's a couple of things when we kind
[2:35:01] of reassess the whole thing as we we're
[2:35:03] gonna need a fair level of commitment
[2:35:04] commitment here to everybody that
[2:35:06] putting names up and and so this is
[2:35:09] basically just to to ask you all as a
[2:35:12] church to really join in now because now
[2:35:16] not just for a fact that's a
[2:35:17] sunday-school thing but now we're going
[2:35:19] out there and we're giving their message
[2:35:21] to people about our Lord and our Jesus
[2:35:23] and our Savior that's been born so we
[2:35:26] kind of have to try the bass we can you
[2:35:28] know and did God do the race but it's
[2:35:30] gonna be have to make a big team effort
[2:35:32] from all of us so this is a couple of
[2:35:34] things I want to ask because the Sunday
[2:35:37] School of the youth are going up to the
[2:35:39] Oakland camp that cuts our practice
[2:35:43] sessions from five to four so we leave
[2:35:46] and we lose a whole day in practice
[2:35:48] session basically just by the youth
[2:35:51] going up so we wanted to do a Saturday
[2:35:53] Sunday maybe that weekend but now
[2:35:55] there's no you so we really can't do it
[2:35:57] so what sister sheriff has done she has
[2:36:00] put the final practices on a calendar
[2:36:02] which we're going to put up and how many
[2:36:04] did you make copies of that sister
[2:36:05] cheering so every family has a copy
[2:36:08] that's got the dedicated times for us to
[2:36:10] to practice this display and and we just
[2:36:13] need you to commit to that date so if we
[2:36:15] have a play it's hard you know I know
[2:36:17] sometimes you seek and and things happen
[2:36:19] but just really just try to get you
[2:36:22] because without the character you can't
[2:36:24] really know with your position and stuff
[2:36:26] so we really want to get everybody just
[2:36:27] committed to the to practice dates if
[2:36:29] that's alright so that's the that's the
[2:36:31] biggest thing we ask and then there's a
[2:36:34] couple of things like we need to have a
[2:36:37] backdrop for the play so anybody that
[2:36:41] wants to do the backdrop it we only have
[2:36:44] month so we can't wait till the last day
[2:36:46] before we do it to do this backdrop can
[2:36:48] we get someone maybe if they're willing
[2:36:50] to do it to paint the backdrop it
[2:36:52] doesn't have to be something fancy it's
[2:36:54] just we've got a manger and we've got
[2:36:57] the field you know because the angel
[2:36:58] spoke to the wise men so if we can split
[2:37:00] this thing maybe in two I mean you can
[2:37:02] speak to sister sheriff and get an idea
[2:37:04] what you what she's got in a head and
[2:37:05] then just commit to doing the backdrop
[2:37:07] but if you said I'm doing it then we we
[2:37:10] have to get it done and I maybe call
[2:37:12] upon Isaac and and Andy just if we can
[2:37:15] get maybe a frame that we can put it up
[2:37:17] because it's gonna be at the community
[2:37:18] center just to dot in a frame which it
[2:37:21] can be in if you guys would maybe help
[2:37:23] us with that and cuz you've got the
[2:37:25] skill you've both this wonderful world I
[2:37:28] think you can that will be easy so if
[2:37:31] you wanna that's up to you but you if
[2:37:33] you commit it we put a date on it we're
[2:37:35] gonna put a date on everything because
[2:37:37] the winds stay after the youth comes
[2:37:39] back from the camp will be a food race
[2:37:41] really so so we're gonna have everybody
[2:37:43] doing the play are never seen like it's
[2:37:46] gonna be on that that Saturday so we
[2:37:48] know we got it all sussed
[2:37:49] okay so then costumes we're gonna give
[2:37:53] to the families to do so your children
[2:37:55] if they ship it we give the moment
[2:37:58] there's the costume to do and we'll give
[2:38:00] you a picture of how a ship it looks and
[2:38:01] we can just all do it if somebody wants
[2:38:04] to help someone else with it this is the
[2:38:06] thing we we just call communication say
[2:38:09] listen I cannot make a halo to save
[2:38:11] myself we don't have a loosely but I'm
[2:38:13] just saying then at least say can
[2:38:16] somebody help me with it I don't know
[2:38:17] how to cut a hole in a sheet
[2:38:19] we've got people like sister Robin that
[2:38:21] would definitely give you some tips on
[2:38:23] how to do it you know like so we're here
[2:38:26] to get this thing through the door we've
[2:38:28] got four practices that means we're
[2:38:29] gonna only have four hours maybe eight
[2:38:32] hours of practice before we're gonna we
[2:38:36] gonna do this play and then the
[2:38:38] musicians we also asked brother brother
[2:38:42] either one if he would get the musicians
[2:38:44] in so we can record the songs that we
[2:38:45] want to sing in the play and so that we
[2:38:48] in between the week of the play we can
[2:38:50] sing the songs and practice them so when
[2:38:52] it comes to the play we can do the words
[2:38:54] and we we all sit in the show so that
[2:38:56] the music
[2:38:57] it would help we're all ready now to
[2:38:59] sing it so when we say youth using this
[2:39:00] song and class using this on they
[2:39:02] already have the songs and the teachers
[2:39:04] if you maybe in your Sunday school just
[2:39:06] just before you start your Sunday school
[2:39:08] age and just run over your song if you
[2:39:09] can and then you go into your Sunday
[2:39:11] School lesson that would be awesome so
[2:39:13] then at least the kids know where to
[2:39:14] sing so there's just a bit of
[2:39:16] organization but we're gonna need a
[2:39:18] commitment from everyone and and
[2:39:20] everyone that's here is involved so if
[2:39:23] you want to get involved even if you
[2:39:25] don't put your name on the list let's do
[2:39:27] it we're gonna need your help please so
[2:39:29] and that's pretty much sister cheer is
[2:39:31] there anything else you sort of okay and
[2:39:38] if there's any questions just just ask
[2:39:40] tutorials to ask me then then we'll just
[2:39:42] guide you through it but we're gonna
[2:39:44] need everyone's help but can we just at
[2:39:46] least get to the practices that's the
[2:39:47] major one if it's alright and then
[2:39:50] that's all for me so thank you and we're
[2:39:52] gonna go into the play right now so just
[2:39:54] to do the music sister chair if it's
