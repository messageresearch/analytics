be gathered together in this place to thank you lord to praise you to worship you lord to recognize your awesome power lord and your drawing power and each one of our lives that we're here lord we believe that it's not an accident that we're here it's not just a coincidence or random set of circumstances lord god but we believe it's your mighty hand lord that's directed us all here today it's your mighty power lord that's called us it's your word lord that's drawn us in this late dark hour lord and we just thank you so much for that lord jesus so we just want to pray that you would continue to have full control of the service lord we want to we want you to be glorified this morning lord you said if i've lifted up or draw all men unto me lord say we just desire to lift you up this morning lord jesus we acknowledge lord that you're the great god you're the king either you're almighty one the great conqueror lord say we just want to um pray and have your way in the service this morning bless brother ben lord maybe he's ministering as we speak we just pray you'd anoint him or if he's not the other ministers that are ministering at the camp and just bless those who couldn't be here this morning too we just pray and just commit the service to you in jesus name amen amen praise the lord okay um god bless you you can actually have your seats this morning i have got an opening scripture but my opinion scriptures kind of all coincide with my um slide and then i kind of just carry on from there so it's a little bit unorthodox how are you all this morning good very good who said very good brother ed i like that when you're a christian you're always good regardless of what the circumstance might be we are always good when we're a christian amen amen i just um yeah thanks dennis i leave it there um i've got a i've got to go quite fast this morning but i don't like to go fast straight away because i kind of like to get to know you you get to know me a little bit i settle in then we make a start so that's kind of how i do it so um i was thinking i was saying to shannon the other day actually i was like this is an odd sort of set of circumstances that i find myself in or like i i end up for the last sort of six weeks i've been up the front for with all sorts of stuff doing stuff now you all know me right i'm like a shy introvert loner that's true that's true that's what that's my natural man you know i'd rather be i was going to be a farmer that was what i was going to be and like go up in the bush and just farm and come down to church on sunday and go back up to the bush come down on wednesday maybe if we didn't live too far away that that's my ideal scenario you know but it didn't quite happen that way but i'm sure it felt like only six weeks ago i was up here preaching and then i think the next week i had to come up in song lead then i think the next week i think i had to run my grandmother's funeral then i think us then i think i had to do a wednesday night ministry thing then i had to song lead then i had to do the best man speech at my other brother's wedding essentially yeah then i'm up here this morning again and it's not really my style and if i suppose if people say you know not that i've got any critics but if critics were like oh why does he always go at the front i'll be like well i'm asking the same question you know i don't i don't know but anyway if you're called to do something though you've got to do it well that's in anything that we do we should do it well that's the way that a christian should be and especially for the lord if we're going to do something put effort in yes do it well don't don't do things half-heartedly do it well or don't do it at all you know and so regardless of all these thoughts that i think i think will have if i've been asked i want to put effort in to try and do it well you know i want to i want to do my best for the lord so so when i you know when i lay down and take my last breath i can think i did my best you know hey sometimes we try our best and we fail miserably who cares we tried our best that's all that we can do is try our best sometimes we try best and we succeed so now you all look like very intelligent people to me so i'm when i start this i'm going to go very fast is that okay i'm going to go fast all right because i have to go fast to get through this i said to brother andy last night where buddies you know so i can say this i said oh can you keep the song service not don't do it really short but don't do it long you know i was getting worried because it was like quarter past 10 and i'm thinking you haven't started the first sort of song yet you know but nonetheless we're here now so i'm going to go fast i'm starting okay this that my sermons often i just get one word then i have to try and think about trying to try and push something out of that one word and the one word that i got this time was surveillance surveillance and when you first thought you think how am i going to get five minutes out of the word surveillance you know but lord help me we we somehow figure it out and then now i'm thinking how am i going to get surveillance out in this short amount of time my scripture that i've got is proverbs 15 3 says the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good the eyes of the lord are in every place every place beholding the evil and the good now i've broken this down into a few different portions i've got the world under surveillance the church under surveillance and the bride under surveillance i've kind of broken it down so the first one i'm going to talk about is the world under surveillance and there's a trend at the moment that everything is now surveillance surveillance surveillance we are all under surveillance now this is now naturally speaking right we're all under surveillance that's just that's the modern world that we live in we're under surveillance and get used to it it's coming to a city near you more and more and more it's probably coming to the country near you more and more and more that's the way that this whole thing's going we're under surveillance and i'm just going to take you through a few natural things to sort of get our minds realizing that we actually live in an unusual time a strange time it's a time where human beings maybe pre-flood they may have had this sort of scenario but post flood because we don't know the technology they had there but post flood we haven't had this scenario before like what we are under now as human beings surveillance we're under we're under constant surveillance i'm just going to take you through a few of these more intense scenarios but we are this is all coming to a city near you so don't don't fret you'll have your turn to be under this sort of surveillance you know we must be special to be watched so china has a very good surveillance program they've got it's like a so they've got cctv cameras all over the place 250 million of these things that's a lot of cameras and they they and and they've got this awesome technology very good technology it's called facial recognition technology and they can process faces very very fast with these cameras so they're finding like people try and escape and they do test it within a couple of minutes they give someone 10 minutes to run away in a city and within you know within 10 minutes they found the person by us you know they recognize his face in one of these cameras and track him down so it's just there's a lot of surveillance very good surveillance going on they they keep a good watch on their citizens over there and everyone is tracked and everyone has now a number when you go there too there's not much cash in when we were there about two years ago it was all everything is qr code and whatsapp and alipay and everything it's all it's all going to digital currency because that's the for the surveillance um it's that's more the preferred method of um operating you know you have everything because then you have a digital id and then you're you they know who you are and now you pay with things with your face you know you just go and it scans your face and that's how you pay because your face is linked to your account and your account has got money in it and so it's so things like jaywalking you know you can't jaywalk a guy there said he he um he jaywalked and within about eight seconds of getting of jaywalking he'd got a notification on his i think it was whatsapp or alipay that he'd been caught jaywalking he had been fined and money had been taken out of his account that's done and dusted you know so that's very very good technology very good surveillance and now the police have there see google the west is a bit more against this stuff but it'll slowly come in it's just the way it's going to work but but the chinese just get it done you know and they have so so they have their sort of like google glasses but all this information is now so they can look at people and you know you'll come up who you are that's so and so this is their record and it's down to things like credit score and that so you you if you're a good or bad person you get rated you get a credit score and then if you're bad you kind of have bad things happen to you if you're good then you're okay that's that's there was a russian app it's not just in in china there was a there was a russian out years ago called find face and they would scan all sorts of faces and if you feel someone you're a bit shy to go and talk to you want to know who they were you could just use this app and you could take a photo of that person it would scan their face and then tell you who that person is and it would search for the whole database quite accurate it was very common in sort of the like 2015 and that it was called fine face i don't know if we like it was very big overseas but it sort of slowly went away somewhere but then the guys that developed it emerged with the russian government and and now they've been working on their own um facial recognition technology and that with the russian government so they they um one of one of the methods they you like for for when it was covered for the lockdown you know they they used a lot of this technology to they saw someone walking around oh that's johnny walking down on the street there you know get hold of johnny because it recognized his face but here they were so they for that for that sort of surveillance they were going to use um cc our mobile apps that track users locations cctv cameras qr codes mobile phone data and credit card records that's to just track if anyone is out and about when they shouldn't be we don't have the luxury of doing that here i was listening to something on the radio and they said overseas they just kind of get it whatever information they want private information but we are slightly more restricted here you can't just go and get that information publicly well how would i say this you can't tell people you just get the information they probably do get the information but you publicly can't say you get the information in these countries they just get the information and what are you going to do about it that's the way it works this is the amount of cameras you probably can't see there but the united united states actually has a lot they have a lot of the stuff as well it's not just these countries it's um the bigger countries are doing and everyone's trying to follow suit with this stuff china's got they they're about 250 million now um america's got a hundred and oh no no sorry they've only got they've got 50 million but it's per capita because america's got less people but they got more cam um more cameras per capita but russia has got a lot of people so they're going to have a lot of cameras as well so they're that's proportionate this is just interesting technology that is changing the way that the world operates um starlink is a very interesting development um matt would know about this it's it's um the guy that did telstra what's his name he's elon musk he's doing this it's quite an awesome program when you think about it he's sending thousands of satellites into low earth orbit and they are they are picking up um internet and they are beaming internet down to the whole world this is what this program is about thousands and thousands of these things they're already up there you can already parts of the states you can log into um skynet and it's very fast very fast um um internet speed and it comes it being it's beamed down from all these satellites but there people are complaining because they they've got all these lights now beaming through the sky and it's kind of astronomers are complaining that you know these things are going to fill up the sky because they're low earth orbit so they are trying to do things but that's how many they want to have up there the whole place they want the globe covered because space is like the wild west still you know it's just no one really is in charge of it it's like it is the wild west at the moment and and i think all the rich guys are realizing this is our latest um you know it's like like this is the colonial style but into space you know cloning colonial era going into space and sending up these satellites and you you can um why did that was because they've already done deals with the military and things these these these satellites will have cameras on them as well to do their own little bit of surveillance at the same time as beaming down you know so everything is going to be you can't get away anywhere everything is watched all the time you can even now it's gotten to the point now if you want to watch something you can there are companies now that have satellites that you can just go and spy on things and i want to keep an eye on this particular area you start your account and pay them your monthly fee and you can watch any area in the world that you want to all the time you know that's that's this we live in a surveillance state everything can be under surveillance even things like your cell phone you know you're you can be you you're tracked all the time by your phone like your phone is always it's always sending out a little um i am here here here i am here i am all the time it's like it's walking around yelling out this little i am here and you know you've got all these cell towers and they're like oh who who's around me and they're they're listening for the i am here i'm here i'm here and and there's you know if you're further away your your shout is quieter if you're closer your shout is louder i'm here i'm here and then they get that data and it's like okay that phone with the unique every every phone and the phone itself and the sim card have a unique number worldwide so that's why you can ring a number and it will go where is that phone and it will say oh i just heard that phone yell at me over here it's over here okay we'll connect it to that number there it's all and you can ring someone now and they'll answer around the world anywhere because they're always yelling out to the cellphone towers i'm here but that information tells where you are all the time it's always saying i'm here i'm here you walk away i'm here now i'm in the middle of these two towers i'm here and it's and all this data gets kept and this data often gets used to track oh where it was so and so he was there okay because we it's called metadata and so we we we get tracked or we are under constant surveillance all the time we almost can't get away everything we do like we're like who's got email you'll probably have you know you start these free email accounts all your emails get read that's how these people make their money because then they they scan it and then keywords you know if you talk about things then they can do advertising this is now for money to make money out of you if you're typing in certain things now we're not so important that i want to read your emails because i want to know what you're up to we're not that important don't think we are very important it's but that being said if you want to be if anyone if the authorities want to they can get access to all of our stuff it's not yeah that's just this is the way that it works if you want to do digital stuff it's all there someone's got access to it even some of the encrypted stuff you're still people still have access to the actual the program itself you know the developers have a back door and it's just so all these programs they all get read one guy wanted to get some information out there i forget what it was about so he thought i'll send an email using this and this email he was exposing a it may have been something to do with the government it may have been elections i'm not sure what it was but he thought if i if i write in these keywords in my email i know this news company gets all that they get sent all the stuff and they any any kind of important stuff they look at it so um yeah and there was a follow-up the next down email had sent privately to a friend about oh we heard you're doing something but it was his email is being read and keywords being scanned and stuff that's the world we live in that's that's the way that it works we we get all these apps apps are even worse you know they you put on you put on um location like locations that is like yes activate my where i am so this that that app knows where you are all the time you activate um access my photos it can access all your photos all the time any of your photos on your phone it's accessible through this you sort of open the door and let the stuff in i put this one of tick tock up there because um tic dock is like essentially a chinese company you know and so all the americans are all upset they're trying to close this company down because you know oh it's it's bad but it's it's more the point of you know we can spy on our own citizens but you're not allowed to come and cut our grass you know because they're coming in and all the american data now they can track all these americans through their app you know so they're like this is not fair you know you're you're cutting out grass here that's the only reason why they didn't want them to they wanted to get rid of the app because it was you know they they wanted to do their surveillance i found this photo interesting this is this is our friend and he um so you see and people people i guess they weren't surprised but you know he had his he did this little photo but they looked in the background and he had her he'd had his camera with a um put a tape over his camera so that you know because he knows you always get hacked and people look at your camera your camera's probably like this camera here someone may be looking at me right now it's not it's just you're on your phone your phone's everywhere you pic like you could people can listen to what you say when your phone's not on everything it's not it's just we're under surveillance all the time we're not important that they look at us all the time people look at us but if we were we could be looked at very easily and i thought new zealand's not really like that you know we don't have all this facial recognition technology and we're all you know we're good old new zealand just kiwi blokes and girls you know relaxing out in the back and i saw these cameras come up by our road i was i thought they were speed cameras for a while but then i then i um last year an article came up on the news and it was this was um this information came out because i think radio new zealand had had asked for um professional information act like requested can you show us this information because this was essentially it was private because the police said it's not really irrelevant the public don't really need to know this but police have been this is august last year police have been setting up a nine million in the facial recognition system they can take a live feed from cctv cameras and identify people from it this will push new zealand into new territory for attracting citizens it will be run by a non-police contract the u.s firm data works plus and collect 15 000 facial images a year without expected to expand up to tenfold so here you go we're welcome to the party folks we've arrived you know we're here we we don't miss out on the fun i'm saying this lightly because you ain't going to stop it you know some people are out there trying to stop this and that it's it's just going to happen this is where it's going to be you're not going to stop but the christians aren't going to stop it it's just going to this is the way that it's going to happen but i want to say this is old technology it's old technology god's been doing surveillance for a long long time far before this stuff he's he's been doing his surveillances these guys are starting to read your mind in the sense of like in china they're now they are now taking images of your your face and your different moods and so they can tell what sort of mood you're in by your facial expressions and your body language now this person's in that sort of mood or that mood based on the data about you as it so it's building that now but the lord knows far more than that about us i want to read you the scripture here from genesis and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto men that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives all of which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also has flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of when the sons came and unto the lords of men they bear children to them the same became mighty mighty men which were of old men of renown and it says and god saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth god did a surveillance and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually so god's hearing all the stuff he's hearing all every thought imagine imagine god's thought when he looks when he when he listens in and he hears that the thought of every person's heart on the earth is evil continually all of their thoughts are just evilness that was what god what he heard when he did his surveillance the thought of their hearts were evil there was only one man and maybe his family that had nicer thoughts which was noah and he repented the lord they obeyed man on the earth and grieved him in his heart and the lord said i'll destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for repenteth me that i've made them but no i found grace in the eyes of the lord he would have been the only thing that wasn't like that i've got a quote from brother branham here and everything that there is today that is had today had that has had its beginning and everything that and everything that there is begun in genesis remember life began in genesis death began in genesis this is brother brown's going to talk about noah in this day death began in genesis and all thoughts began in genesis right and wrong all began in genesis if you study the scriptures real closely you'll find that even the isms and the cults of today had the beginning of genesis if you've just watched nimrod in the different ones in the scripture all the isms that we have today began in genesis now today they polish it up make it look like something else but it's still the old evil spirit if you watch the nature of it the way it acts we've still got the same thing going on today you know a few years ago when i was just a little boy i lived in the time of prohibition that's when they banned alcohol and they had old charlie barley corn they called him many of you can remember that hideous looking person his hat all caved in and his his shoulders stooped over in such a horrible looking critter he was that was charlie barleycorn but you know today he's become a polished up man he ain't no more the little brown juggernaut and and out on the corner where the red light district is he lives in a bumper and everybody's icebox but he's still charlie barleycorn just the same same old evil one me being my mind i was like who's charlie balikorn so he's actually i think he's actually john barley corn but charlie would have been you know just a name but it was a silly silly poem that this goes back like hundreds of years um robert burns actually tweaked the poem a little bit but it's actually john barley corn but they would have called him charlie tonight this fictional character about he's like a piece of barley and they they come and they slay john barley corn and then but john balicorn rises back up when they plant him and then he then he comes and they they do all these things to him it's it's making alcohol and then then they drink it and it's like john barley corn is this awesome guy after that you know it's just about getting drunk that's all it is like there i'll read you this these are just there's a lot of verses in the middle there were three kings in the east three kings both great and high and they had sworn a solemn oath john paligorn should die that's when they're going to harvest it they took a plough and plowed him down plod put clods upon his head and when they had sworn a solemn oath john barleycorn was dead and they say all the stuff it was very morbid it's all sort of evil about his blood drained and all these things it's very and then the last verse is where john barleycorn was a hero bold of noble enterprise for if you too but taste is blood which is the beer to make your courage rise to make a man forget his woe to heighten all his joy to make the widow's heart to sing though tear were in her eye nonsense but that's obviously a celebration of this you know so so that was what um this is the so in brother brown's time this john barley called charlie barleycorn was this awesome cool character you know that was but it looked like he was that guy in there looks pretty but brother brahms saying and now they're just now this guy's this awesome guy again john barleycorn is now he's not just this critter okay everyone and the bible said to god in the bible my spirit will not always strive with man and jesus said in matthew 26 as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man did you notice the spirit of god was striving with men not striving to know not men striving to know the spirit of god but it was the spirit of god striving to get to men and oh how paralyzed today the spirit of god is striving with man and i wonder if god doesn't think just about like he did in those times it grieved him that he even made man to see how rebellious man can be against his spirit and his program and his way of life for man men and women the way that god thought i think when he looked down at noah and that time is is he's getting to be the same way today as when he when his surveillance goes out he hears what's happening and he hears the thoughts of people's hearts evil continually i want to just i want to bring this up because this just shows the way mankind is like when covert started around the world alcohol sales in whatever region lockdown started went through the roof what did we all do when covert started we thought praise the lord we can have time to fellowship and read the word of god and study that's what the believers did what did the rest of the world do get drunk it's time to drink we can and alcohol's online alcohol sales just went up this is another graph going up this is this is online pornography as soon as there was a lock down in the country this pornography spiked in that country because that's just the thoughts of man and woman are evil continually god's privy to all this data he's got all this data he's got his own surveillance that surveils surveys everything now i want to carry on here and as it was in days of noah so she'll always be in the days of of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given a marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all eventually god's surveillance just said i've had enough of this another scripture hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering there's no hiding from the surveillance of god there's no hiding i want to talk about sodom for a minute because there was surveillance that happened in sodom like i was also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they brought they sold they planted their builder but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed this day it's going to be like that day and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which has come unto me i'll go down to do my own surveillance to see exactly what's going on down here i've heard all the sinful things coming back to me but i want to go down and do some surveillance myself that's what god is saying and if not i will know and the men turned their faces from thence and went towards sodom and abraham stood yet before the lord now i'm going to segue just here a little bit just bear with me and two of them went into sodom and cried out this is brother branham against the sins of the city and it was just before the burning of the gentile world at that time just before the burning of the gentile world which is now all sodom parish right then just a few was pulled out lot and his two daughters his wife never made it she turned back how could i just like to have time to show that right now where the church is standing at that position i want you to notice now the church is in exactly the same position so what happened there was there was all this evil happening in the world and god sent three three angels firstly to abraham and then he sent three he sent and then two angels went down to sodom to do some surveillance to find out what's going on in sodom what's happening there we're gonna we're gonna see what's really happening in and that was that was in an in the actual type there but but in this day here i want to say this because this makes you realize this is an interesting time that we live in and the two angels that went down to sodom were billy graham and oral roberts that they went down to to the world to the world and to find out what's going on and to preach to do some investigation god sent these people there and they were good friends oral roberts and billy graham got some quotes here billy was the most generous man in the ministry ever met he accepted me as a brother he said he fell in love with my ministry i counted him the number one evangelist in the world we became very close friends and this is um billy graham by old roberts upon hearing oral robots passing in december 2009 reverend graham said in part oh roberts was a man of god and a great friend in the ministry i loved him as a brother we had many quiet conversations over the years now these guys were very big in the 60s but billy graham was very big all the way through until he passed away but but this happened like these were big events there were massive crowds they they came down to say repent the same is what the angels said repent you know repent i just like this because i think it's good you know so but abraham there was a group that didn't hear that message they heard a different message and that was and that was abraham and his his his name is a-b-r-a-h-a-m how many is that one two three four five six seven i just like this so i thought i'll put it in here and so you know to the world church they get at graham g-r-a-h-a-m but we get a b-r-a-n-h-a we we it always works you know god's stuff always works william out w-i-l-l-i-a-m m-a-r-r-i-o-n 7-7-7 god slings just always work it's not it's it's like like like in the book of acts none of this was done in a corner this wasn't just secretly hidden away this was all out in the open this has all happened you know and now that's what's going on in that day just to show the last sign that abraham saw the elected group pulled out from sodom now don't miss this parable whatever you do the group that had been pulled out that wasn't in sodom to begin with but the two angels went down into sodom and when they got there we find lot and he found him in a bachelor in condition all homosexuals and perversions you know the story but there's one to stay with abraham that was elohim they preached the word down there they is down in sodom preaching the word smite then blind and they couldn't find the door that's what it is today there's so much confusion in the christian world today it's just no one knows where to turn i just put this on here there's a lot of these grasps but this just to reiterate this is what's happening in the world this is now this is only legalizing same-sex marriages but this is when you legalize it it just it attitudes change towards it and when attitudes change it's accepted and it just comes in and and in 2000 2000 not very long ago right 2000 even no places now it's just like it's the the race to the bottom you know who can who's le you know no one wants to be left carrying the can i was like we were the last person to legalize it you know it's just this there's a momentum but it's just it shows that mankind are going a certain way and that's that the world has been on surveillance and they've been found they've been found wanting for the ways of man are before the lord and he pondereth all his goings all of these ways of man no matter who you are i see these these great men think that they they and the great men in the earth and they're signing all these bills to legalize all these things into all this stuff and they think they're patting each other on the back and clapping and i think you're under surveillance your heart's going to be tried you know what you're thinking and you're you're you you won't this won't carry on that this moment won't go away for you this moment will stay forever it'll stay forever it's like all this data we've got everything's been recorded i'm going to get to that soon i'm going to move on to something else right you see these little pockets going through there they're called sources so forth people say that people so that well we better leave them alone he starts talking about flying saucers he says we better leave them alone hear all these people come up missing you say you don't hear from them they're standing there and then they're not there that's the way the rapture is going to be one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and they'll be hiding like here or boat there'll be neither hide here or bones left it'll be transformed in the moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that we see all this going on now and the pentagon wandering painting are wondering about these lights in the mystic light and everything that they're seeing in the sky you've seen they had one here in the paper at jeffersonville this week and so forth the mystic light so oh they don't know what it is but listen little children is going to pick you up one of these days see don't worry remember jesus said as it was in the days of sodom what happened just before sodom god came down with some angels and they had an investigation judgment he said i've heard the cry that's that is so sinful so great i've come down to find out whether it's all together the truth or not that's right watch that main one that stayed with abraham could discern the thoughts was in his heart behind him that's that's us that's our group now when you look around just a little bit of notice see watch what it's doing it's the same thing today it's an investigation judgment i've always found it very interesting and me being me i like to look into it right this now this was last week i'm not going to play this audio but this was two weeks ago so american airlines pilots flying along and i think a news company intercepts their radio communication so this this was this was heard by an uh reporter and then he requested that he get the the recordings of it and then once they get the recordings they follow up and the airline says yes okay that happened we didn't know what it was but so this this pilot's going along he says do you have any targets up here we just said something go right over the top of us i hate to say it but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing moving really fast over the top of us that this happens all the time but i'll show you a few things the pentagon has officially released three short videos showing unidentified aerial phenomenon that had been previously released by a private company the video shows what appeared to be unidentified flying objects rapidly moving while recorded by infrared cameras two of the in two of the videos contained service members reacting and already how quickly their objects are moving so these guys are saying i've just got the photos but these guys are saying wow these things are moving very fast they they have trouble tracking them on the infrared devices and then they track this thing they're like what is this thing it's moving moving really fast you know they're these are so i put this stuff up because you know anyone can have a video of like a make it up but when it comes from official sources and recordings from aeroplanes and stuff and it's that it's released by official information act being released it's you know a bit more interesting than these other ones here but i want to bring it on to something because in the 60s about that time when brother branham was hearing all that stuff was happening was when the nuclear the activity around the nuclear um like the cold war was starting and it was a very active time in global politics and and and the development of these evil weapons that were going to destroy us and these these weapons were massive like what was being tested in the 60s 40s 50s 60s was game-changing like don't just think i was just they did some tests this is massive in the course of mankind we haven't been here before we have actually in noah's time because they blew themselves up there but 100 years ago we weren't here in this position that we're in now but we're in the world is in a very different place now these bombs are massive massive huge like they were a man started figuring out how to break the atom and make these massive bombs that were just the only purpose was destruction you know just huge things they test them in the desert they tested them in the pacific and then the russians started making them in the chinese everyone was making them and but in the the in the in the 40s you'll know this that obviously the americans dropped some on two cities um hiroshima and nagasaki but just awful like bomber whole city like just annihilated city and this is this was this is the bomb in its infancy you know a small bomb blow up a whole city this is just murder that's all it is these men women are children everyone was just i got some numbers i think they were actually about casualties were about two hundred thousand just drop fl fly there and drop this bomb you know and then and then there'll be the radiation fought out for years afterwards but i just want to point this out now i say this as a servant of the lord i believe that it could happen any time total annihilation it could start any time look as the days of noah that's how they throw the world out of its bounds in the days of noah you know it was atomic bombs we think oh we're the smartest guys in the room you know but you imagine if you erase all our history and it raise us and we've got to start a game from zero and you know then that that's essentially at the end of an hour's time the world was erased and it started from zero in terms of in terms of the knowledge they had but they had as according to brother around they had far more knowledge than what we have you know and people live for 900 years you can accumulate a lot of knowledge and pass on a lot of stuff so he was saying when they built the pyramids of springs and so forth we couldn't build it today if we had to gasoline power electric power won't build it but atomic power will so he's saying they actually had atomic bombs and that's what caused this i think they tried to send something out into the firmament because there was a firmament above the heavens that had water there and that's that's why the earth could grow oh that's another subject i want to i want to labor on this for a bit though because this is hope this doesn't scare the children don't be scared by this it's not really scary people if you're in the world you don't know what it is but we know that it's just it's god investigating because brother brown said people are seeing these lights around everywhere but he's saying they're just investigating judgment angels finding out what's going on in the world this guy robert hastings he he was he actually was in um his father worked at some of these camps so he was privy to some of the um when he was a boy he would go in there and help clean and things and he would see the data and when he was a young younger fellow he saw these some of these lights on the radar so he was that got him interested so he spent his life trying to figure out what are these things and why are we seeing them specifically around nuclear development camps you know and and because in the 40s and 50s and 60s when they started having all these facilities that made that were developing nuclear bombs it became commonplace that there were always these unexplained lights hovering around the place and just all the time there are hundreds of testimonies of these vehicles things lights coming in and they're saying these things aren't they're not human they they move really quick they drive around they do these things it's not normal stuff you know and so all of the sites actually had these reported and it was this was only like five years ago these guys managed to this guy he only went on data from people that worked in these institutions when they were younger and and that they could verify with official information release act so they could find out yeah this stuff this happened you know it wasn't just someone saying oh that's what i saw it was actually this is official stuff you know they saw something well i guess what i'm saying is these guys saw something and these are reports they they they say they were there they were at this camp they saw a light come over you know one guy they said it hovered over th this guy here i think he said he said a lot of the lights were red some of them were white some but this guy said they saw a red light it came it hovered over the camp it came down to the front gate hung over the front gate they didn't know what it was and i think this was the one he said at that time 10 of their missiles were disabled so they couldn't launch 10 of them they went into this is official stuff once it happened they the missiles turned off they and they so they're saying if if we wanted to if the if the if the president at the time said launch the missiles 10 of these things wouldn't launch they just got switched off and this guy here his testimony was this big long type thing went and it hovered over the camp and then it sort of just flew away down the drive you know just hanging around looking what this guy here is saying same thing he's here to hover over the silo pit that's where that that opens up and the missile comes out and he said it was bright enough the official thing was it was bright enough to light the solar cap you know they could it was light this light hanging around this guy here this guy here said they saw about seven of these lights just coming over and hanging over the fence all the time they were seeing this stuff that they they and they so much so they start an investigation official investigation what's all this because it was sort of more of a defense issue you know we've got things hanging around our this is our main form of attack we've got things hanging around what's going on when you think about it it's a massive event for mankind this stuff is being made it's huge it's not just oh they're just making a new car this this is preparing for the destruction of mankind happening in a few little camps you know this is massive stuff this is not just a small deal there was investigating judgement angels what what just just to show this i'm gonna this this is a big deal that's going on that this was a big deal for mankind well this was another one actually received a call from the they said this official one was a large red and orange light that's hanging around and it looks like a long tubular shape and it's flying over the camp official stuff and that was this one here this big i found interesting they were kind of red a lot of them i always thought they were white and sources but oftentimes they just describe light they don't describe i saw the shiny saucer they say i saw light and if there were openings in it they said i saw a light more light on the inside coming out of these it was just light because and and they just moved funny in the sky this guy here actually said he said that after one had all of it over he said one of their nuclear warheads went into launch mode he said as a object passed over the missile site we would start getting erratic indications on that missile the bad thing was we also got a launch indicator does that mean the launching integrator has been triggered he said yes that means that the launch that missile has received a launch signal now launch signals come from the they need codes from the president and that to come in but he said this thing the russians had the same thing the russians that their one was on launch signal for 15 seconds before they could stop it and they they report seeing the same thing these these lights coming over because they were developing at the same time china reported the same thing they were investigated there was an investigation going on and this was their official this was their um investigation not demanded right sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major us defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributed to natural phenomena or non-types of aerial vehicles they're saying something's going on here we don't know what it is but it's an investigation because man is about to blow themselves up and destroy mankind see now we are post that we are now in a world this has all happened this is where we sit this is phenomenal when you think about what's happened and where we are at as a world back in those days it was in the 50s and 60s the plan was if one launched a nuclear weapon then say russia did then or vice versa then the americans and the russians they all had a way of getting them they had planes and so they would have these lightweight bombs on the planes and so so they would the plan was okay if you launch one and it blows some us up somewhere we've got all these planes at airports ready to go and we can we'll we'll fly these things out it takes a couple of hours we'll reach russia and we'll bomb you and then at the same time the russians will be sending their planes across the states and over into europe you know to to bomb that and and this was a couple of hour you know so okay let's do this and a few hours later you're sort of dropping these bombs a couple of hours that was so it was a couple of hours then everything would be blown up and then they made this thing called an intercontinental ballistic missile basically a space rocket with a bomb on it this can get around the world around the other side of the world in 30 minutes so it went from a couple of hours to 30 minutes you can annihilate countries off the map and now it even progressed further than that because now there's nuclear submarines that are out off the coast of both countries like the russians have theirs off the coast of america america has theirs off the coast of everywhere and these things are 10 minutes 10 minutes or so in the country this country's done 10 minutes that's how far we are from destruction 10 minutes we're 10 minutes like 100 years ago we weren't 10 minutes from destruction now we're 10 minutes that's the world that we live in today pinch yourselves we've arrived that's why these things were hovering around what's go you know what are you guys making and i just want to talk about this for a minute there's the two babylonians because we know this is going to get used to blow up the vatican this and and and la's going to go down in the in the and the kings of the earth who have committed a fornication lived deliciously with her shall be well here and lament her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar off for the fear of returning and saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city from one hour is our judgment come it can be fulfilled now one hour your judgment has come i just want to read this just because it's like where we are this is the second babylon going well i say this before this book happening here in california you people here in los angeles every year when i come back here there's more bob-type woman a cessified man than it was in the first place more preachers going on into organization you're not without excuse if the mighty works that have been done and sodom and gomorrah was done and you are to be standing today oh capernaum now who call us yourself by the name of the angels los angeles see what's going to happen she's going to go to the bottom of the sea when i don't know when it's going to happen but it's going you young people if i don't see it in my day you watch out she's gone it's on the program this is the actual prophecy which i just want to read because it's all part and parcel of the same things that are going on that is a solemn warning we don't know what time this is from choosing a bride and you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of the ocean oh capernaum said jesus thou who exulted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty works that have been done in sodom and gomorrah were done here would have been standing to this day and sodom and gomorrah lays in the bottom of the dead sea and capernaum is in the bottom of the sea their city who claims to be the city of the angels who has exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of fashion and things to live in the foreign countries come here to pick up your filth and send it away to your fine churches and your steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be lying in the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of god is belching right beneath you how much longer he will hold the samba hanging out over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there plumb back to the salt and see it'll be worse than the last day of pompeii repent los angeles repent the rest of you turn to god the hour of his wrath is upon the earth as it was in the days of noah flee well there's time to flee and come to christ let us pray dear god whenever my spirit is shaking my heart is dropping tear drops of of warning granted a god that men and women will not think of what i've said as a joke and that the church people will not think of it as something that was prejudiced or against them may they see lord it's in love thou embarrassed me record almighty god that up and down this coast i've went year after year proclaiming your word bear me record oh god if it would happen tonight i've told the truth thou knowest this vision of the bride is the truth i've took your name by it lord and said it was thus saith the lord and i feel that i am conscious lord of what i'm doing so i pray the lord in jesus name let the people shake themselves tonight and flee from the wrath that is to come for ichigo has rode over the doors and over the nations of black checkmark has come across it after his investigation the spirit of god is grieved away from it and awaiting the balances and found wanting the feast of king nebuchadnezzar has repeated the game with drunken parties and half dressed woman calling himself christians oh god of heaven have mercy upon a sinful world and a sinful people lord as we are tonight god i'm trying to stand in the breach and ask for divine mercy that you'll speak into this crowd tonight and call your bride to attention lord to march not by the sign of any creed but by the sound of the gospel of the lord jesus christ granted oh god let it be known this night that thou art god and thy word is truth while solemnly in the face of this people we call them to attention of thy word that was an amazing meeting and an amazing time and that was an amazing prophecy it was a it was a game changer it was now around the same time i'm going to move to this one now the church was now under surveillance that not only was the world on surveillance but the church the churches are under surveillance by the word of god the word of god is sharper than any two-edged sword and the word of god has got a way to go down into someone's heart and see what's in there and and and at the same time when all this is happening the the the church now has having its own surveillance by by the the word of god that's going down and speaking and it's and it's it's directed at people's hearts and the way people respond is what they are to the word of god it was surveying people's hearts and before that we had excuse the world had excuse because this surveillance down into the heart hadn't happened so the world the church had an excuse to be doing what they're doing but there's no excuse anymore because the word has come and it's it's surveyed the hearts i want to read this then the orthodox standing around the church remembers they said this man is beelzebub speaking of jesus well he's the chief of fortune tellers that's what biased was the chief of devils they thought it was a telepathy of some sort and jesus said you speak that word against the son of man it shall be forgiven you but when the holy ghost has come and you speak a word against it it will never be forgiven you neither in this world or in the world that is to come do you get that church it will never be forgiven thee in a a word against it do you do you interpret it when the holy ghost has come it shall do the same things there was an excuse then because jesus had not been glorified neither had the blood been shed but after that blood had been shed and sin was paid for man was left without an excuse god once winked the ignorance of men but in this day he has called all men to repent one word against it is unpardonable it will never be forgiven you in this world neither in the world to come to sin against the holy spirit and that's saying calling it that's turning down the holy ghost calling it an unclean thing and i want to just go into this and whoever speaks the word against the son of man that shall be forgiven them but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost that shall not be forgiven them neither in this world neither in the world to come now there's an unforgivable sin but but i want to put it like this the word of god is a divider we think oh the word of god is this you know that's this great thing that brings everyone together it doesn't it's a divider it separates the sheep from the goats it divides and god has got a way of going to somebody's heart with his word and discerning what they are and and dividing them out if you're if you and they make their choice right but but it divides and i just want to read the scripture think not that i'm come to send peace on earth i'm not come to send peace but a sword for i am come to see the man at variance against his father and the daughter against his mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foe shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of men here that love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose and he that loses loseth his life for my sake shall find it now the word of god you you accept the word of god your life doesn't go rosy and suddenly everyone loves you probably half your family will turn against you that's the way that's what this word does that how it works friends turn against you it's it jesus he and he warned us that's going to happen i'm not going to make it all work out for you this is the way that it's going to happen for some of you now that's i'm just saying what the word of god says i want to show you when it divided and and it it separated and when jesus was here he said after he preached about you know if you drink my blood and that he started preaching these things many of his disciples when they heard of this they said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew himself that the disciples mermaid he said unto them doeth us offend you what and if you shall see the son of man ascending up to where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you their spirit and their life and then i just come down a few verses and it says but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except they were given him of my father and then from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more the word of god is a when it comes down it separates who is who because it has to be a way of separating who is who now we know the scripture here for it is impossible for those that are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted of the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall again fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put them to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off the upon it bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is received with blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and brides is rejected and is knight into cursing whose end is to be burned now we think oh if i if i don't do one thing i'm out it's not really like that if i can just make it because this the scripture is not although it is and it isn't it depends what seed is in you because that word has come to water the seed of god in people right so so that word will come now if what grows out of people is is that word then that's going to stay but if what comes up is a thorn or brian here that's not destined for the kingdom of god so that will actually that will enjoy the spirit of god enjoy all those things but the because the the thistle needs water as well it needs things that but it will not accept that word because it's not part of it and and when the word of god comes down it will it separates out the tears from the wheat it separates out these things and that's why this one says not everyone that comes unto me and says lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me that thy lord lord have not been prophesied in their name and the no name of cast that devils in my name have done many wonderful works and then i was professed unto them i never knew you depart from a year that work iniquity that's the word of god separates out who's who the and the investigation has come down and it's it's separated and you can see the results of the separation the church is just going into darkness it's just and and some of the things every now and then to keep my i shouldn't say but to keep my blood boiling i just watch sort of all sorts of churches different things and just see what's going on to kind of keep a gage on i often say to shannon i'm going to do some research just to make sure the world's still falling apart yep that's still still on track i don't i don't want to make light of it but we have to sometimes yeah otherwise we go you know if my mind gets too intense and i go insane you know i've just got to i know it's happening for the eyes of the lord i want to move on for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong on the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him now i'm going to move on a bit now the bride unsurveillance then i've got one more then we're done the bright under surveillance i couldn't for the for the lack of finding something better i just want to read this one because this was this was going to describe what i'm trying to say in a better context okay because the church has been under surveillance and they've you know it's happened that way but i just want to read you this and maybe some of the i also love these little tracks when i was a kid this is from jack chick he's just passed away he was in his 90s but he used to make these tracks and these outreach tricks and it's this guy he lived and then he died and then we pick him up here and it says now look i've lived a real good life i was no different than anyone else and the angel says everything's been recorded says next and then then it shows that is depiction of the now it's not exactly like this but his depiction of the great white throne judgment you know where they all stand and then and then this voice comes down says review his life yes lord and then this big screen comes up and it says this was your life now this will happen see this technology exists we we have all the cctv stuff you want to get someone in trouble oh we caught you on camera doing this you know was that you yeah so the police often use it or there is there did this do that one day everything is going to be played back everything and so this this this man's life began to get played back and he says look that's me as a baby does that mean everything i've ever done will be recorded there's me it's all been recorded it's all been under surveillance every single person's life and their thoughts and their motives and everything i'm looking forward to it actually because i've got a lot of questions about what happened in certain things i want to want to make light of it but each person is going to face this and then the screen starts playing and then he and then he sees stories and there there is a teenager and he's saying ha ha he's about to tell a dirty joke and this guy's thinking no don't say that joke here you know that was in the presence of god and then it and then it shows another one of him you know looking at a girl and thinking in his heart what he's thinking now his thoughts are being spoken it's even if his mouth was quiet his thoughts being spoken in this episode here and this is what will happen he says i remember that but no one saw me do it and as this played back every thing that he did in life is all played back and all his thoughts all his motives all of their intentions are played back there's surveillance and then he says well look there's me in church see i wasn't so bad and then the preacher's preaching and said for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the host we have believed on him should not be here but heavy everlasting life and in his mind he's thinking i wonder who's winning the ball game or i wonder who's winning the rugby you know i wonder what i'm going to do later on and then the the preacher is still preaching and he's saying that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe thine heart that god who throws him from the dead thou shalt be saved and in his mind he's thinking i couldn't care less what time is it you know this is this is all going to play back and then he says jesus sat unto him i'm the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me and he's walking away saying i don't need christ there's nothing wrong with me i'll make it my way and he's there thinking i must have been insane to turn that down but unfortunately this is going to be the journey the journey of many people but and the tracker says this can be your life and here here is this man as he's receiving the word of god and it says of course i believe the bible and i'm convinced that i'm lost i'm going to hell but what must i do to be saved repent surrender your life to christ acknowledge die for your sins and receive him as your savior and there's this man you know lord i am a sinner i repent of my sins and i will acknowledge it jesus i acknowledge jesus christ as my personal savior so he's he's accepting the lord and then it shows him of course his life is not always going to show like the bride will actually be judging the world but this is just for the purposes of this you know and showing him all the different things he did because he was a believer the reason why i'm saying this to you is because we are under a different administration in terms of surveillance and judgment right there are there are men and women out there that have rejected god whether in the christian circles or the non-christian circles and and they they essentially they can go through life sometimes seemingly not paying for any of the sins that they commit and you think wow this these guys just do anything they want to and they seem to just their life just goes a certain way and it gets blessed and everything happens and they seem to do anything that they want to they can't and it's not happening that way although it might seem like it but all of their sins are being stored up against the day of wrath there's a record of everything and it's just being saved up there's no there's no judgment here for it it's just saved up saved up against the day of judgment that's what's happening with them right but but we get the same surveillance our surveillance upon us is exactly the same but because we have surrendered our life to christ we get judged here on a regular basis we we we say we the lord pricks our heart hey you did that lord i was wrong we get we we get chastised we get that we we're under constant surveillance but my record of my life is not going to be played back or at least not the bad parts they've all been deleted see like like brother brown calls the justification it's justified never did it in the first place i can't explain how it works but i just want to say that the lord knows when i sin but he doesn't know when i sin if you know what i mean like like it's not going to be played back here as a record of me sinning but i can't just go through life and commit something yeah the lord's just forgiven me well well he saw me do it and he knows maybe i've got to change and say so i'm gonna it's a personal thing i have with the lord you know that's why this scripture here says for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world so the bride gets surveillance every day you're being watched your every motive your thoughts everything is being watched is being listened to and you're being judged and the lord is the the lord is as as then he comes and tells you it's like it's like david you know david is a type of this sort of way you know david david was with beersheba thought he did this thing then he had and then when she was pregnant he thought i know what am i going to do so he tried he tries to do this big cover-up scheme and get you rider come and get him drunk go back to his house call him back from the army go back to your house and then that he would be with his wife and then send him back to the field so then his wife could say oh this uriah was the father of the child but he said no i'm not going to go in there i'm going to my men are out in the field i'm going to sleep on the front porch who do you think told him to do that god he said no no you're not i'm going to make the circumstances so you can't cover this one up so god uriah probably always went inside but he's like you know what i just something about what happened last week and those guys out there i just can't do it i'm going to sleep on the porch and he tried to do it again get him drunk and he just he slipped on the porch then he went back and then so then david had him killed but you speak of surveillance then then the prophet nathan came back to him essentially play back the tape from god hey we've been watching you david this is what's happened yes here's your his and they played the tape we caught you but you know as a christian we just say caught me like david lord i repent i'm wrong it was me i repent it was me yeah do what you got to do i'm not running i'm not hiding i've surrendered i surrender them all that's it i repent but that's mercy see that the quote we read this morning i think on the word for the day that's actually mercy to be in that position as grace because could you many people did this many people did what david did god didn't go and see them about it because they didn't want them to they they but they will pay for it on the day of judgment they'll pay for all their sins but god has taken all our sins now he just deals with us personally his surveillance is just with us personally but it's grace it's grace for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are opened unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them to do evil now i'm closing with this one i want to take this now to a slightly different surveillance because it's not all like it's not all in a negative context of surveillance for thus saith the lord of hosts after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye now i want to say that we are under surveillance from god in a good way to look after us and and amen i like a picture like this you know here's this see you are that person sitting in the carriage to god you're important you know important people who's got who here has bodyguards no well okay naturally speaking that you know we're not really it shows i'm not that important i don't have a bodyguard but the more important i get if i get to a certain level of importance i'll end up with a bodyguard because i'm important you know you've got to look after this guy we don't we can't let anything happen to this guy he's important i want to let you know that we're like that man or woman sitting in the carriage there to god we are important we are important and he's got we've got our bodyguards all the time all the time watching over us watching every move when we wake up in the morning we're being watched we're being protected we're under constant surveillance these men and women these great men and great women are under constant surveillance so that they stay alive nothing happens to them we've got far better surveillance than we're gonna we got a far better security team than these guys do way way better than this i'm just gonna do this and i'm gonna go back to that right because i just want to talk about this there is no temptation taking you but such is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able but what was the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it satan's people just go through hard things and they get ruined and the end is destruction and doom there's no out there's no it will get better it's just destruction and doom although we go through things god's intention for us is not destruction and doom so god's always watching us doesn't matter what trial you're going through what's happening he's always watching us he's always watching us and if it gets too hard you know that they have some spy going in and doing some sort of deal with somebody you know and like they're saying they're doing and then they say look we're watching you if it all gets a bit heavy we're going to come get you out of there you know we'll if the if the situation doesn't go as we plan and the baddies start to get you i'll you know you don't worry we'll take them all out we'll pull you out so you can just go in there and do your thing that's what it's like for us you know there's not a trial that we're going to go through that we're going to end up being annihilated and we cannot go through it and we're going to come out the other end just broken god as god is watching over us in every trial that if it gets to a certain point he's going to pull us out it's all right i'm going to make a way there's going to be an escape for you it's not going to ruin you none of your trials that you go through you think lord this is so hard it's not going to ruin you it's going to build you up the angel of the lord encamps around about them that fear him and delivereth them every single day we've got angels surveying we're under surveillance we're being watched not not to see what bad we do but to protect us to care for us god's watching our every move every single day well he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their heads lest thou dash life foot against the stone satan tried to twist that around but that's our scripture he's going to protect us in all our ways everywhere you go you go to work you've been watched watched over you go you're driving a car you're being watched over you go to you go to bed you're being watched everywhere you've been you you're being watched over so that god can look after us the lord bless thee you like this one and keep thee the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace that's this that's we want the surveillance of god his face to be shining upon us and and to be smiling and that's you know when we surrender our life to god and we just walk in his ways we've actually got the favor of god smiling upon us and and looking upon us with happiness my earliest memory when i was a little i think i was six months old my mother used to put me in a she had an old clothesline and she would hang the sheets on the clothesline and peg the sheets in and she would put me inside the sheet so imagine i was only a little guy six months old and i would lay in the sheet on the clothesline as she was pegging up the clothes i was six months old i remember this i remember looking up and seeing my mother smiling down at me looking at me in the sheet and i think i was six months old because she wouldn't be smiling at a three-year-old in there but you know but you know a little baby but i remember that and i i remember feeling so good at the time like man i'm well looked after i'm just life is awesome but i just remember thinking that i'm so safe i'm so happy because i saw my mother's smiling face looking down at me that's what it is like with god his face is looking down on us in love it's smiling upon us he's not out to do us harm he's actually smiling upon us to to look after us watch out for us and keep us in all our ways he's not out to do us wrong or to make our life bad he's out to look after us that's the that's and he's he's just watching us all the time i tell you what there's nothing like the favor of god and his blessing upon your life when you just when you know that he's looking at you and he loves you i've got two more stories that i'm closing there was a man praying and he wanted someone to come visit him and he this is a true story but i couldn't find it but i know it's a true story but i just couldn't find the actual information about it but i'll retell it to you the way that i heard it i think he was asking a man was going around and back in the olden times when men would walk around and he was going around ministering to people and maybe taking bibles and preaching to different areas remote areas and so he was walking down this big hill to go to this this man so so he got down to the bottom there and and the man at the bottom would have seen him far off and walking down and the man said oh where's the other you know where's your friend and this man says what no i'm by myself he says what no there was a they'll tell you when you were walking down the hill down the down there very bad rocky face there tell you there where's the other guy but it was the angel of the lord just walking with him the whole way he was by himself i just want to tell you this story i don't know why i want to share this but it's the story of my father and he was he was um we lived in the country growing up country roads like this you know and he had this old holden hq station wagon and his wife was stopped working so it got all the dusty road got dust on the windshield and he couldn't wipe it so when he was driving to work he drove up this road and the dust that was on the windshield when the sun came over the hill and shone on the windshield he couldn't see anything winding up this road and he thought i know the road well enough i'm just going to drive around and i know that this corner is here and that corner is there and this is how we you know we just drive up there and and then i think he may be whistling a song or something like that and he was driving up this hill i would have been about five at the time i suppose and he said as he was driving you heard a voice yell out in the car stop turn right so he jammed on his brake and spun his car right as soon as he heard that voice yell out and he and he and he did a skid like that and came across and he and he was unknowingly just about to go straight off this bank and this is a big kill like we're talking i'm not exaggerating the story you go down the bank you die sort of thing but you know angels were watching over him to keep him in all his ways who yelled out to him you know this guy's about to go off the bank tell him to stop you know he his time's not done yet tell him to stop we have that same thing one is satan doesn't do that for his people he doesn't do that the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto the cry this is my last scripture i'm going to read and then we're going to sing a song this is from psalms and i just want you to bear in mind everything that we've said oh lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and my uprising thou understandeth my thought afar off thou compasseth my path am i lying down and are acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but o lord thou knowest it altogether thou has beset me behind and before and laid thy hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is too high i cannot attain unto it whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed and how behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth is the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou hast possessed my reigns thou hast covered me in thy mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous otherwise and that my soul not write well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious are they thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i'm still with thee surveillance david knew that this almighty god knew everything about him and he felt safe lord all your thoughts towards me are good and i want to proclaim to each one of you never mind all this nonsense surveillance going on we're under surveillance from almighty god we're under his protection nothing we don't have to worry about this what's going to happen in the future in that we've got a better almighty god watching over us and almighty king let's just stand this morning
