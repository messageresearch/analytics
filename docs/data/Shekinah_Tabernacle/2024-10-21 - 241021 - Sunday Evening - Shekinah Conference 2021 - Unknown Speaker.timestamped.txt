[1:50:45] I'd rather pick to two people
[1:50:48] I would rather preach to two people that
[1:50:52] are full of the Holy Ghost rather than
[1:50:54] preaching to a bunch of people full of
[1:50:57] the spirit of the devil
[1:51:01] Hallelujah
[1:51:03] oh man
[1:51:06] praise the Lord Brother you know your
[1:51:08] life
[1:51:09] the prophet says everyone should take
[1:51:11] stock of his own life
[1:51:13] every day in the morning
[1:51:15] Lord
[1:51:17] since when I woke up in the morning did
[1:51:19] was I saying the right things
[1:51:22] was I walking with the right friends
[1:51:24] did I did I do everything right every
[1:51:27] single day take stock of your life I I
[1:51:31] admire this man job brother the Bible
[1:51:33] says job used to offer a sacrifice every
[1:51:37] single night
[1:51:39] he would go before the Lord with an
[1:51:42] offering and say Lord bear Adventure my
[1:51:46] kids and they were moving around the
[1:51:49] streets they might have offended you I
[1:51:51] offered them
[1:51:56] Hallelujah but you don't have time with
[1:51:59] your kids
[1:52:00] you don't have time even of reading the
[1:52:02] Bible
[1:52:03] how can you overcome the politics of
[1:52:05] this world
[1:52:06] how can you overcome the internet of
[1:52:08] this world
[1:52:10] brother when it comes to reading the
[1:52:11] phone you are always 24 7.
[1:52:15] but when it comes to a Bible brother you
[1:52:18] read one verse then proof
[1:52:24] praise the Lord
[1:52:30] conversation anything that's not right
[1:52:32] reveal it now
[1:52:34] we will walk straight and do it
[1:52:43] the prophecy is in one of the spoken
[1:52:45] ways God doesn't doesn't take you
[1:52:47] responsible of you being a sinner
[1:52:50] but he takes you responsible of you
[1:52:52] remaining
[1:52:54] a sinner
[1:52:55] because he has made a way for you to
[1:52:59] move far away from being a sinner into a
[1:53:02] saint
[1:53:03] now the prophet is saying Lord reveal it
[1:53:06] to us once you show us we will do it
[1:53:12] we need to give sleepless nights to the
[1:53:15] pastor knocking at the pastors though

[1:53:44] just easy as if you are sitting on a cup
[1:53:46] of coffee drinking or on a couch
[1:53:48] drinking cup of coffee there's a lot of
[1:53:50] cleaning that needs to be done
[1:53:52] that is why Peter said repent first
[1:53:55] thing one repent
[1:53:57] and be baptized in the name of Jesus but
[1:54:00] we just want to be baptized then we jump
[1:54:03] step number one we are baptized this try

[1:55:12] cry out
[1:55:14] and say Lord I'm just like Jacob here
[1:55:17] I'm holding to an old time I ordered an
[1:55:20] angel until you change my life oh God
[1:55:24] change my life
[1:55:26] that I'm tired of being a hypocrite oh
[1:55:29] God I'm tired of being a hypocrite
[1:55:36] praise the Lord
[1:55:43] we will walk straight and do it
[1:55:46] for we realize we are living in the
[1:55:47] shadows of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:50] oh God come into the into the Shadows
[1:55:54] thy Justice tonight we pleading for a
[1:55:57] new dedication

[1:56:01] dedication
[1:56:03] a concentration
[1:56:05] and a feeling of the holy spirit in our
[1:56:08] lives

[1:56:12] that's what we need a new consecration
[1:56:15] brother I don't mind to be to be to be
[1:56:19] made humble I will confess all my life
[1:56:21] I will send the devil away
[1:56:23] but I'll receive the Holy Ghost
[1:56:26] that I lose all the pride let I lose all
[1:56:30] the status that you give me but I lose
[1:56:33] everything but I save my soul
[1:56:37] hallelujah what does it tell me for me
[1:56:40] to be walking around as a as a nice
[1:56:43] brother but living like something else
[1:56:45] in the inside
[1:56:48] white outside but dead rot on inside
[1:56:52] oh man may the Lord help us
[1:56:58] to this little technical
[1:57:00] I believe the
[1:57:03] word that are on earth goes to this
[1:57:05] Tabernacle this is the prophet talking
[1:57:07] to you Saints
[1:57:08] now I never said all of the finest
[1:57:11] people
[1:57:13] do you get the prophet
[1:57:14] the prophet preached three kinds of
[1:57:17] believers on every Gathering there is
[1:57:21] three kinds of Believers you like it or
[1:57:24] not
[1:57:25] is just like that that is why sometimes
[1:57:28] the way it becomes so hard
[1:57:30] because it's too fetching for those
[1:57:32] three kinds of believers
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:37] I say some of the finest people on Earth
[1:57:39] go to this Tabernacle
[1:57:41] but
[1:57:42] day by day
[1:57:44] entering
[1:57:46] from meeting to meeting
[1:57:48] I see a great need in the Tabernacle
[1:57:52] this is
[1:57:54] a prophet King now
[1:58:02] a grade in it that's for a Feeling
[1:58:08] for a consecration
[1:58:11] we need a consecration my brother you
[1:58:15] need to concentrate your life once again
[1:58:17] before the Lord that is why he's saying
[1:58:20] come let us reason together my child I
[1:58:25] know you have sinned brother he knows he
[1:58:28] knows that we have sinned he's saying
[1:58:30] come now I know it I know whatever you

[1:58:54] need for this Tabernacle
[1:58:56] a consecration a Deeper Life
[1:59:01] a closer walk with God
[1:59:04] that's our desire
[1:59:06] that's my desire
[1:59:07] to have that deeper walk with God
[1:59:10] a close walk with God
[1:59:13] brother you know what what takes away
[1:59:15] the move the presence of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:17] it sins the prophet the Bible says
[1:59:21] if an evil spirit if a spirit comes upon
[1:59:23] you the Holy Ghost is so timid once you
[1:59:27] do yes in the Holy Ghost moves away
[1:59:29] sit on a branch somewhere waiting for
[1:59:32] you to converse once you confess that
[1:59:34] thing

[2:05:34] brother when we come we lay hands on you
[2:05:37] you surely gonna get the Holy Ghost
[2:05:40] some they don't need even the lying of
[2:05:42] the hands brother

[2:06:19] faith
[2:06:21] I don't want to take much of the time
[2:06:23] but praise the Lord
[2:06:25] just want to see where we can cut off
[2:06:27] from here praise the Lord some few calls
[2:06:30] to read
[2:06:31] I think any man or woman that's the
[2:06:34] prophet reading from the spoken radar by
[2:06:36] Christ speak again
[2:06:39] I think any man with a woman boy or girl
[2:06:42] I think in an intellectual conception of
[2:06:45] what they think uh the word is and so
[2:06:48] forth
[2:06:49] never can have a full Foundation stand
[2:06:52] until they have met the light that
[2:06:55] brings the world to reality
[2:06:57] praise the Lord
[2:06:59] I think no church in this practice
[2:07:02] no matter how intellectual
[2:07:05] fundamental it might be that church
[2:07:08] cannot thrive
[2:07:10] until the Supernatural is made known
[2:07:14] brother sister the prophet is saying no
[2:07:16] matter if you do everything right
[2:07:18] put on your long hair put along your
[2:07:20] long dresses do everything right but
[2:07:23] without that supernatural being no man
[2:07:25] known to you you cannot make it that's
[2:07:28] why we need the Holy Ghost in our lives
[2:07:30] that's why we need the power of God
[2:07:32] that's why we need our own Pentecostal
[2:07:35] experiences with God
[2:07:38] Hallelujah
[2:07:39] I need a Pentecostal experience tonight
[2:07:42] I need a visitation tonight

[2:08:08] I don't want to leave this horrible life
[2:08:10] anymore I'm dropping everything further
[2:08:13] only so that I can receive the power of
[2:08:15] the Holy Ghost

[2:11:50] into a red world can I have another
[2:11:53] slide my brother

[2:12:36] go straight to where I want then I begin
[2:12:38] to see something moving in front of me
[2:12:41] it looked like a little while a well
[2:12:44] going around like this
[2:12:46] I kept watching I saw the world turning
[2:12:49] around
[2:12:51] I washed it wait was spraying something
[2:12:54] off
[2:12:56] Hallelujah the world was being painted
[2:12:58] now being sprayed
[2:13:00] Hallelujah
[2:13:01] looked it was sprayed of red
[2:13:05] Crimson blood
[2:13:07] crawls around the world
[2:13:10] just like a world going around like a
[2:13:14] comet it had a world around us
[2:13:18] I looked at this world just above it I
[2:13:21] saw I saw Jesus in The Vision he was
[2:13:24] looking down
[2:13:26] I see my soul standing down here on
[2:13:28] Earth
[2:13:29] doing the things that I shouldn't do
[2:13:33] and every time that I sit I sinned God
[2:13:36] would have killed me
[2:13:40] because the day you eat of of it
[2:13:43] dare you die

[2:14:02] I kept watching as I stood behind the
[2:14:05] door I seen my own sins come up
[2:14:09] every time

[2:14:14] his his blood acts like a bumper on a
[2:14:18] car

[2:14:23] run around his face

[2:14:45] God would have killed me right then
[2:14:47] but his blood
[2:14:49] was watching me
