[1:31] [Music]
[4:37] for
[4:45] [Music]
[5:04] good
[5:05] morning how are you all this
[5:08] morning ready to praise the
[5:11] Lord
[5:13] amen amen the first song that um I am
[5:17] going to do I'm just going to change the
[5:19] order slightly but I'm going to take one
[5:20] out is um a song called my beloved I
[5:22] always used to wonder why Shannon
[5:24] enjoyed this song A few years back every
[5:27] time we do it she would um enjoy it
[5:30] and kind of enter into it
[5:33] and um I I you know I I just didn't
[5:37] think much of it I thought I was just a
[5:39] song it's kind of some songs you like
[5:41] some songs you don't they just it was
[5:43] just one of those ones that didn't
[5:44] really strike me much but it wasn't
[5:46] until years later that she said the
[5:48] reason why she liked it at a certain
[5:50] point in time because the don't
[5:53] embarrass David but David's uh David
[5:55] means my beloved and this is when Dave
[5:57] was going through his thing he was going
[5:59] through and you know Shannon was you
[6:01] know trusting in the Lord and when every
[6:03] time we would sing that song it was my
[6:04] beloved so that was I don't there I
[6:07] don't know why I said that
[6:09] [Music]
[6:09] [Laughter]
[6:11] but yeah but let's stand this morning
[6:15] and um but you know it's so we're not
[6:16] singing about David my beloved we're
[6:18] singing about the Lord so so
[6:21] just we don't worship for
[6:24] men what we do actually just not as a
[6:28] supernatural men a God man and you know
[6:31] that's why that's why that's why people
[6:33] couldn't receive Jesus because he was
[6:35] just a man like oh that's just Jesus
[6:38] From Galilee you know when I was family
[6:40] and you know he he they had to look
[6:42] Beyond the Veil of his flesh and realize
[6:44] that that was almighty God and if I
[6:46] would make it spiritual this morning we
[6:48] have to do the same with each other too
[6:50] and with the with say with the minister
[6:52] this morning we look past the Flesh and
[6:54] we we look and realize that the same God
[6:58] that was in Christ is the same God
[7:00] that's in the minister this morning and
[7:01] is going to speak to us it's a
[7:04] supernatural thing and and and the same
[7:07] with brother Ben and anyone that
[7:08] ministers and and but but also each
[7:10] person you know that's how I deal with
[7:12] each person I I see the Christ in each
[7:15] one of you and I don't care about any of
[7:17] the other stuff you know I don't care
[7:19] about any human stuff it's irrelevant
[7:22] there's a Christ in each one and that's
[7:23] who I always look to in each one you
[7:26] know that and it's the same God that was
[7:28] in Christ it's the same God that's in
[7:30] all of you and that's that's that's who
[7:33] God's people are they are Supernatural
[7:34] people and and that's why we you know we
[7:37] yeah we just deal very carefully with
[7:39] God's people we deal carefully with
[7:40] everybody but God's people we're dealing
[7:42] with
[7:43] God you know and and that's why Jesus
[7:46] when he stopped Paul on the road to aass
[7:48] he said us yeah when he stopped Saul he
[7:51] said Saul Saul why are you persecuting
[7:53] me and we know that it's because it was
[7:55] Christ that was in each one of the
[7:56] people he was persecuting that was what
[7:58] he was doing
[8:00] so I don't want to end up in a
[8:02] predicament where I'm doing harm to the
[8:04] Lord by how I deal with other people
[8:07] with other especially other believers
[8:09] Lord help me let's um pray this morning
[8:11] and just Commit This Time To The Lord I
[8:12] feel a nice atmosphere I think this
[8:14] going to be a powerful service this
[8:16] morning I think the Lord's really going
[8:17] to speak to us we need to put our
[8:18] spiritual thinking caps on and just
[8:20] receive what he has for us this morning
[8:22] Heavenly Father we come with reverence
[8:24] before you Lord knowing that that Lord
[8:27] you paid such a great price to redeem us
[8:30] Lord and and and we just have such a
[8:33] love and respect for you Lord and and
[8:36] and for your people Lord and for the the
[8:39] the ones that you dwell in here this
[8:41] morning we have such a love and respect
[8:43] for each other Lord and may we may we
[8:47] always have that esteem and that respect
[8:48] for each one Lord may may we look past
[8:50] the flesh Lord and and our our human
[8:52] fraes which we all have our human
[8:54] weaknesses our human failings Lord we we
[8:56] as men and women fail on a daily basis
[8:59] Lord we we're frail we we say the wrong
[9:02] things we do the wrong things Lord but
[9:04] we're so grateful that in US is the
[9:05] unfailing god Lord and each one here
[9:07] this morning is the the unfailing but
[9:09] also the perfect Christ dwells in each
[9:11] one Lord and that's what I see in my
[9:13] brethren this morning is perfection Lord
[9:15] because you dwell in them Lord and and
[9:18] we we we lord you blot out all these
[9:20] other things Lord when we put them under
[9:22] the blood all these failings we have
[9:23] Lord and there's just perfection Lord so
[9:25] that's what we look at by faith in each
[9:26] believer this morning Lord I see
[9:27] Perfection Lord because I I see Christ
[9:29] dwelling in us I see a redeemed a
[9:31] forgiven people this morning Lord and
[9:33] may just minister to us this morning
[9:35] bless the word Lord bless the songs and
[9:37] we just invite you here Lord to have
[9:39] have your free will Lord to to just work
[9:42] in our midst may we surrender to your
[9:45] spirit this morning Lord that you could
[9:46] move in a powerful way Lord we just

[46:38] purpose a purpose in life a purpose
[46:42] where there is no purpose job 7:1
[46:47] 17-18 the word says what is
[46:49] man that thou should us Magnify Him and
[46:53] that thou should us set thine heart upon
[46:55] him that thou should us visit him every
[46:58] morning and try him every moment amen a
[47:03] beautiful question we always like to
[47:05] refer to what is a man that thou should
[47:07] us Magnify Him thou should set thine
[47:10] heart upon him and that thou should
[47:11] visit him every morning and try him
[47:14] every moment let's just bow heads again
[47:18] father as we pray oh Father this
[47:20] morning bowing our hearts and our heads
[47:23] before thy throne of
[47:25] grace Lord we want to commit ourselves
[47:27] into thy hands this morning to say Lord
[47:30] may you take these words and thoughts
[47:33] and just direct It For Your Glory for
[47:34] your kingdom may it help somebody here
[47:37] Lord and may it direct our course in
[47:39] life may thy visitation give us a
[47:42] purpose this morning oh father that when
[47:45] we walk out of this building oh God that
[47:46] we will know Lord that we are happy and
[47:49] that we are thankful to be thy children
[47:51] to be called by thy Grace of Father Lord
[47:54] I commit myself to thee and commit the
[47:56] order AI to thee everyone that is
[47:58] listening oh Father God may your grace
[48:00] be extended oh God and may we say it was
[48:03] good to be in the house of the Lord and
[48:04] our hearts burned within us as he spoke
[48:07] to us along this way we pray oh God thy
[48:10] blessings in Jesus Christ name amen amen
[48:14] you may take your seats this morning Al
[48:17] Matthew
[48:22] 24:28 Matthew 24:28
[48:31] for wheresoever the carcass is there
[48:33] will the Eagles be gathered together
[48:36] amen so we understand that when we come
[48:39] together like this this morning there's
[48:40] a purpose and a reason for it we didn't
[48:43] just come to church to see one another
[48:45] we didn't just come to church to talk
[48:47] about other things but our main goal and
[48:50] purpose on a Sunday morning to gather
[48:52] would be to hear from Heaven would be to
[48:54] hear from our Lord Jesus Christ and
[48:56] would be to be directed in life to have
[48:59] our questions answered to have our sick
[49:00] bodies healed to have a visitation from
[49:03] the Lord and that he can direct us and
[49:05] guide us and that we can find
[49:06] inspiration for life because without
[49:09] God's inspiration your life has got no
[49:11] meaning it's got no Direction he got no
[49:13] purpose but God gives us purpose you
[49:16] know when we were lost in the world we
[49:18] lived a certain kind of a life and um
[49:21] God came our way and he gave our life
[49:23] purpose and Direction a meaning a
[49:25] certain attribute that you you walked
[49:27] from there and you knew that you know
[49:28] what I I I know where I'm going I know
[49:30] where I come from I also know where I'm
[49:32] going and God has given us Grace job
[49:35] chap
[49:36] 10:12 job chap
[49:38] 10:12 amen thou has granted me Life in
[49:42] favor amen and thy visitation has
[49:45] preserved my spirit so you know without
[49:49] God's visitation there is no
[49:51] preservation of your spirit because as
[49:53] We Gather here from different walks of
[49:56] life we need a visitation from God to
[49:59] preserve our Spirits because if you just
[50:01] gather and there's no visitation from
[50:03] God there is no preservation of spirit
[50:06] then you become feeble you become
[50:08] nothing you cannot carry on this race
[50:10] because you need Supernatural vitamins
[50:13] to walk in the race of the end time to
[50:15] walk every day of your life and to say
[50:17] Lord God this is a difficult calling
[50:19] this is a deep calling this is a a
[50:22] calling that I don't have the strength
[50:24] for but if your visitation can come
[50:27] regularly I know that you will encourage
[50:29] me and give me the capability to walk
[50:32] this life that you have called me for
[50:35] because I cannot walk this life alone I
[50:38] don't have the power the ability to
[50:40] stand there and to know that I can make
[50:42] it because in your own strength you can
[50:45] never do it never ever I don't care how
[50:48] long you follow the lord I don't care
[50:50] how deep you into Revelation in your own
[50:52] strength you can never never never walk
[50:55] this walk that the Lord has called us to
[50:57] walk so we know that that visitation is
[51:00] there to revive us to Quicken us to give
[51:02] us inspiration and to activate me into
[51:05] my position because you are not just a
[51:07] church member Hallelujah and let me just
[51:12] from the beginning tell you that the
[51:13] church cannot save
[51:16] you amen a building can never save you a
[51:20] pastor can never save you a prophet can
[51:22] never save you there's only one Savior
[51:25] and that's the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ
[51:27] he is the one and the only one without
[51:29] him there's no Saving Grace so we
[51:32] understand that the church plays such an
[51:34] important role in our lives because you
[51:36] are the Church of the Living God not the
[51:38] building but you as you sit here this
[51:40] morning as an individual you are the
[51:43] Church of the Living God and then we
[51:45] start to understand that the building is
[51:47] just the place to keep us out of the
[51:49] rain a place dedicated for worshiping
[51:52] God a place where you bring and you come
[51:55] together and you you you know they
[51:56] create an atmosphere and do certain
[51:59] things so we come to church to be to to
[52:02] understand where we come from and where
[52:03] we going we come here to hear from
[52:05] Heaven that God can anoint a gift and
[52:08] and speak to me words of life and
[52:10] encourage me along this way and that's
[52:12] the reason for us coming together not to
[52:14] be not to be you know broken down but to
[52:17] be buil up in the Statue of a perfect
[52:20] man now the prophet says in the message
[52:23] to unite un Unity of God of one God in
[52:26] one church he says God does not force
[52:28] man to do
[52:32] anything God has never forced any of you
[52:35] to do anything yeah amen God is not in
[52:38] the business of forcing you yeah God
[52:41] calls you and he says follow me and I
[52:45] lead you to the Still Waters follow me
[52:47] I'll lead you to the pastures where you
[52:49] can feed follow me and I'll carry the
[52:51] burden with you but you are the
[52:54] individual that makes the decision God
[52:56] if you say no God will never Force you
[53:00] because God wants you to make up your
[53:01] own decision to say I'm going to accept
[53:03] Jesus Christ as my savior and then
[53:06] things changes so we would call it the
[53:09] power of
[53:11] decision you have power until you make
[53:14] the
[53:15] decision as a young person you've got
[53:18] power until you make the decision
[53:20] remember when the enemy comes and he
[53:22] tempts you to to go down the wrong road
[53:25] and to start to smoke or drink or to do
[53:27] evil things you have the power until you
[53:30] say yes I'm going to do it the moment
[53:33] you say yes an evil spirit takes a hold
[53:35] of you and you lose all power then you
[53:38] become an addicted alcoholic or a smoker
[53:42] or somebody that does things which
[53:44] should never be done because then you
[53:45] want to get delivered and now all of a
[53:47] sudden you realize I've got no more
[53:49] power now I decide I'm going to stop it
[53:52] that's right and the devil says no
[53:55] there's no stopping here that's right I
[53:57] am now in charge yeah that's you had
[54:00] power until you said yes that's right
[54:03] now you've handed power to
[54:06] me and now you said oh you know I I
[54:09] don't want to do this thing anymore and
[54:11] guess what tomorrow you're doing it
[54:12] again and the next day you're doing it
[54:15] again because you have handed power over
[54:18] and it's the same with Jesus Christ when
[54:19] you hand power to him to say Lord I
[54:21] accept you yes he takes all power from
[54:24] you and now you are a prison of love
[54:27] divine and it's no more your choosing
[54:29] and I thank God for that that once he
[54:32] chose me I can never go
[54:34] lost never he's remove power from me I
[54:37] can decide tomorrow you know I'm
[54:39] finished with God God says no it's no
[54:41] more your decision you handed power to
[54:44] me the day you were born
[54:46] again that's why we love God so much so
[54:50] if the enemy has trapped you and you're
[54:52] in the wrong position the wrong way
[54:53] there is only one way out to repent and
[54:56] accept Jesus Christ that he can break
[54:58] the power of the enemy that he can set
[55:00] you free and that you hand power to him
[55:03] to say Lord I'll rather have you as my
[55:05] master than the
[55:07] devil because the devil's purpose is to
[55:10] destroy you God's purpose is to build
[55:13] you up in the Statue of a perfect man so
[55:15] you have to treat that power of decision
[55:18] with with with care yeah with respect
[55:22] don't make a decision Hasty think about
[55:25] it pray about it and say Lord
[55:27] what should I do here how is the
[55:29] situation because Jeremiah said for I
[55:31] know the thoughts that I think towards
[55:33] you thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[55:36] give you an expected end so God is
[55:38] always in control and God's purpose is
[55:40] always to bring you to an expected end
[55:42] remember nothing is a surprise to God
[55:45] that's right you might go on your road
[55:47] back home and something happens the car
[55:49] can break down or something can happen
[55:50] tomorrow you come to work your boss
[55:52] fires
[55:54] you God's not shocked because he before
[55:56] the foundation of the world you're going
[55:57] to get fired
[55:59] tomorrow or promoted that's right
[56:03] anything is possible so God is never
[56:05] shocked God is in control of your life
[56:07] and because God is in control of your
[56:09] life it should relieve a certain
[56:10] pressure from us to say Lord I trust you
[56:13] explicitly that the footsteps of the
[56:16] righteous are for ordained and therefore
[56:18] Lord I'm not going to worry about
[56:20] tomorrow but I know that you are already
[56:22] in
[56:23] tomorrow amen because remember you have
[56:27] a purpose and the word gives us purpose
[56:30] the word helps us the word gives us
[56:33] Grace thank you my brother God bless you
[56:36] so without purpose there is emotion
[56:39] without motion there is activity without
[56:43] accomplishments so we can come together
[56:45] we can sing songs which is an
[56:47] activity we can do many things and and
[56:50] and preach sermons and do things but
[56:52] without God and the inspiration of God
[56:54] and without God's presence here it's
[56:56] it's worthless we are wasting time we
[56:59] are wasting one another's time but when
[57:01] God is present then there's a purpose
[57:03] there there is a reason there is a
[57:05] direction because he now takes a full
[57:07] control of us and we need to understand
[57:10] that God wants us to be focused amen
[57:14] amen to be focused that we can look at
[57:16] it and say Lord let me look upon you and
[57:18] live because if you're not focused you
[57:21] know what the devil will just pull you
[57:23] everywhere he will do things with your
[57:25] mind as we come to that you don't want
[57:28] to do we need to be one mind and one
[57:30] purpose
[57:32] now the prophet say we are not a divided
[57:35] people we've got to be in unity amen
[57:38] there's a purpose for that as a church
[57:41] we need to be in unity to love one
[57:43] another respect one another pray for one
[57:46] another serve one another in love
[57:49] because each one of us is holding a part
[57:52] of
[57:53] God that's the key amen that's right
[57:56] so when I look at you what do I
[57:58] see some of you are black some of you
[58:00] are white some of you are brown some of
[58:03] you are different colors but what do we
[58:06] see when we look at one
[58:08] another you know we are diverse some are
[58:11] tall some are short some are beautiful
[58:14] some are not so beautiful like me
[58:18] nothing to look at but you look at one
[58:20] another you say my goodness you know
[58:22] what where are we standing so the key
[58:24] and the secret has always been as the
[58:26] prophet teaches us that we should look
[58:28] at one another and look beyond the flesh
[58:31] because the flesh is just the badger
[58:33] skins the Tabernacle with Moses built
[58:36] you know God placed the most beautiful
[58:38] instruments in there behind Badger skins
[58:42] when you look from the outside you will
[58:43] say I wonder what's in this building
[58:46] because the badger skin is nothing to
[58:48] desire why didn't God put it like like
[58:51] curtains of
[58:53] gold because God says no I hide in
[58:56] Badger skins Badger skins you look at
[58:58] you say man there's nothing to that
[59:00] thing it's ugly it's no thing to desire
[59:02] but what's behind the badger skin your
[59:05] flesh is only the badg of skins I have
[59:08] to have the ability to look Beyond you
[59:11] look behind your color look beond your
[59:13] statue and look and say inside there is
[59:16] a flame of God inside there is the germ
[59:19] of God I love what I
[59:21] see so we should look at one another not
[59:24] at the outward but look inside and say
[59:26] my you know what we might disagree about
[59:28] this a little bit here little bit here
[59:30] we might not see everything eye to eye
[59:32] but I look beyond your flesh and I see
[59:35] God and because I see God I love
[59:38] you I appreciate you that's why God put
[59:42] PE different people in One Church
[59:45] yes different people because it brings
[59:48] diversity it it it learns us to
[59:51] appreciate one another Hallelujah you
[59:54] know when we grew up as as where we come
[59:56] from we are very
[59:59] stiff you know you're born
[1:00:02] stiff if you say Amen you do like
[1:00:05] this and then you grow up you meet other
[1:00:08] people which are born
[1:00:10] loose they've got gifts you know they
[1:00:12] just just when they come in front
[1:00:15] there's a swing they start
[1:00:17] to we'll stand like this and sing you
[1:00:19] know but they are different and we start
[1:00:22] to appreciate and adapt and and and say
[1:00:24] you know what Lord we are so wonderfully
[1:00:26] made that when I look at that I
[1:00:28] appreciate Lord Jesus that you place us
[1:00:31] together to worship you in spirit and in
[1:00:33] truth and that relieves pressure because
[1:00:36] we are not we are not in competition
[1:00:38] with one
[1:00:40] another amen remember it's not a
[1:00:43] competition now listen to this we are
[1:00:45] each holding a part of God and we must
[1:00:47] come together and then the pillar of
[1:00:50] fire is manifested in the wholeness in
[1:00:52] the fullness of it yeah so when we as a
[1:00:56] the church come together you bring a
[1:00:57] part I bring a part every one of us
[1:00:59] bring a small part he says then the
[1:01:01] pillar of fire is present here this
[1:01:03] morning that's right Hallelujah you
[1:01:05] coming to church brings the pillar of
[1:01:07] fire not from another place but from
[1:01:09] your heart sitting here and combined
[1:01:11] together in worship we become then again
[1:01:14] the people that can say you know what we
[1:01:16] know that the pillar of fire is
[1:01:19] here not by a picture but by looking at
[1:01:22] your brother or sister's face next to
[1:01:25] you you know that God is here because
[1:01:28] they carry
[1:01:30] God and then the pillar of fire is
[1:01:32] manifested in the wholeness in the
[1:01:33] fullness of it when the church sits
[1:01:36] together in Heavenly places then the
[1:01:37] fullness of the power of God is in his
[1:01:39] church each one of us holding spiritual
[1:01:42] gifts spiritual offices coming together
[1:01:44] brings the pillar of fire back
[1:01:47] again so the key is every Sunday or
[1:01:51] every meeting we have the PO ofier is
[1:01:53] there because you are there yeah that's
[1:01:56] right you are you are you are actually
[1:01:58] walking in with it in your heart yes sir
[1:02:00] and when we come together each one with
[1:02:02] their part coming together we uniting
[1:02:05] and that completes that Pillar of Fire
[1:02:07] again back into the fullness that we
[1:02:10] want amen so we bring our light together
[1:02:14] and each one bring it brings a
[1:02:16] concentration of the presence of the
[1:02:18] Holy Spirit that's why we are sitting in
[1:02:20] Heavenly places this morning we have
[1:02:22] left the New Zealand half an hour ago
[1:02:25] ready and we in
[1:02:27] heaven Hallelujah yes some of you are in
[1:02:30] the mall some of you are somewhere else
[1:02:32] but most of us are in
[1:02:34] heaven that's why when the enemy wants
[1:02:37] to attack you and pull your attention
[1:02:38] away and and put you into shopping mall
[1:02:40] and where you know you can be here and
[1:02:42] shopping that's right that price is
[1:02:44] $9.99 but that one is $8.99 I'm going to

[1:02:50] you
[1:02:51] shopping online shopping maybe on the
[1:02:53] phone even in church you don't have to
[1:02:55] use it but you can use it here so that's
[1:02:58] why you going understand I'm here to
[1:03:00] worship I'm here to bring a presence of
[1:03:01] God I'm here to help my brother and
[1:03:03] sister I'm here to bring the presence of
[1:03:06] God and that's why I I'm not going to be
[1:03:10] distracted I need to
[1:03:12] concentrate ecclesiastics 4:
[1:03:15] 9-12 I need to concentrate why because
[1:03:19] without you I'm not complete without you
[1:03:22] there is no
[1:03:23] Rapture without you we are Stu
[1:03:26] here can you
[1:03:29] imagine I believe I'm part of the bride
[1:03:31] of Christ so I've got the conviction and
[1:03:34] Revelation that without me you're going
[1:03:36] nowhere sir I'm not from New Zealand I'm
[1:03:39] from Africa but without me you're going
[1:03:41] nowhere that's
[1:03:44] right so you should look at my interest
[1:03:47] that's right if you really want to
[1:03:49] Rapture to happen start to look at
[1:03:51] somebody else's interest to say who can
[1:03:53] I help who can I encourage who can I who
[1:03:56] can I be of service
[1:03:58] to but you all look at ourselves say
[1:04:01] Lord I'm ready let's
[1:04:03] go when me and sister Ila got saved 32
[1:04:07] years back I said Lord I just made
[1:04:10] it about two weeks the Rapture will be
[1:04:13] gone because I could read it in the
[1:04:15] prophet's message I can read it in the
[1:04:17] Bible every sermon was the Rapture is
[1:04:19] here and I just we said to one another
[1:04:22] you know what I God just waited for us
[1:04:24] can you imagine
[1:04:27] yeah and we were so happy and thankful
[1:04:29] to Lord thank you that you didn't do the
[1:04:31] Rapture and 32 years later we still
[1:04:33] here and God is still
[1:04:36] adding so what does it mean it means
[1:04:38] that we should look at one another and
[1:04:40] say Lord let me become a servant to know
[1:04:42] that I without you lord Jes without that
[1:04:45] person Lord I can go nowhere but I need
[1:04:47] Lord to become a
[1:04:49] servant ecclesiastics 4:9 says two are
[1:04:52] better than one because they have a good
[1:04:54] reward for their labor
[1:04:57] you can never be a church on your own
[1:04:58] amen that's amen sir you can never be a
[1:05:02] single bride the bride is not a single
[1:05:05] member it's a many membered bride
[1:05:09] Hallelujah many members and we forget
[1:05:12] that regularly because we look at
[1:05:13] ourselves you know and and we start to
[1:05:15] identify ourselves more sometimes
[1:05:17] Superior sometimes this way or that way
[1:05:19] but we are a many member verse 10 for if
[1:05:22] they fall the one will lift up his
[1:05:24] fellow but woe to him that he's alone
[1:05:27] when he follow for he have no other one
[1:05:29] to help him up this race this Walk of
[1:05:33] Life you will fall you will stumble
[1:05:36] there is no one of you
[1:05:38] perfect no one just has not made one
[1:05:41] mistake this week we all make mistakes
[1:05:44] daily but when you stumble and when you
[1:05:46] struggle then there is somebody around
[1:05:49] you that can help to lift you up and
[1:05:51] carry with you and say Lord help this my
[1:05:53] brother help my sister amen huj verse 11
[1:05:57] again if two lie together then they have
[1:05:59] heat but how can one be warm
[1:06:01] alone just imagine it was me and brother
[1:06:04] and Po in the church this
[1:06:06] morning what a
[1:06:10] disaster I'll say something he say amen
[1:06:13] he say something I shout amen but
[1:06:16] without without that physical body next
[1:06:20] to you it becomes
[1:06:22] lonely it's not about numbers you can be
[1:06:24] five you can be 10 you can be 12
[1:06:26] whatever God has allowed but let there
[1:06:28] be somebody next to you that you can
[1:06:30] feel the warmth of the spirit and to
[1:06:33] draw from that spirit because sometime
[1:06:35] you come in from the weak and you have
[1:06:37] been frozen up Satan has attempted you
[1:06:41] has attacked you he has tried you and
[1:06:43] now you need some
[1:06:45] warmth you know when I feel sad and
[1:06:47] lonely and my wife Embraces me I pull
[1:06:50] from her energy and strength and I feel
[1:06:52] better already and it's the same as Bel
[1:06:55] Bel when you come to church you can draw
[1:06:58] Warth you can draw energy you can get
[1:07:00] unfrozen and all of a sudden you start
[1:07:03] to feel my I want to worship God I want
[1:07:05] to thank him I want to praise
[1:07:09] him but if you're alone you go in and
[1:07:11] you go out that's why if you feel cold
[1:07:14] just move a little closer to the one
[1:07:15] next to you and pull amen say Lord let
[1:07:19] the warmth of my brother my sister let
[1:07:21] it let it engulf me let it let it warm
[1:07:24] me
[1:07:26] amen and if one Prevail against him two
[1:07:28] shall withstand him and the three-fold
[1:07:30] court is not quickly
[1:07:31] broken amen so the battle is the enemy
[1:07:34] that's why when Jesus sent out his
[1:07:36] disciples why did he send them two by
[1:07:39] two why do you think because you think
[1:07:42] Satan left them alone oh imagine the
[1:07:46] first town they come in and the people
[1:07:47] says
[1:07:48] out out your hypocrit you devil
[1:07:53] worshippers you follow Jes Jesus the
[1:07:56] chief of B
[1:07:58] out and how to you know let's say it was
[1:08:01] your turn to preach and they shout you
[1:08:03] out of the
[1:08:04] church man you walk like this say Lord
[1:08:07] why do they reject me but then your
[1:08:10] brother is there don't worry brother
[1:08:12] Peter don't worry John I am with you
[1:08:14] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:08:16] you it picks you up to say let's go to
[1:08:18] the next town and then I'll take the
[1:08:20] turn you know maybe God can help us and
[1:08:23] we support one another that's why God
[1:08:26] knows we need one another to encourage
[1:08:28] to love to embrace to say Lord I cannot
[1:08:31] do it on my own I'm not willing it's a
[1:08:34] lonely walk but with my with my people
[1:08:37] around me with your people around me
[1:08:38] Lord it gives me
[1:08:41] courage to just move a little bit
[1:08:44] further for where two or three are
[1:08:46] gathered together in my name there I'm
[1:08:48] in the midst of
[1:08:50] them and the psalmist says the Proverbs
[1:08:53] says the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:08:54] tower the right rightous run into it and
[1:08:56] they are safe so there's a principle
[1:08:59] that we run into the name of the Lord
[1:09:01] like a tower and it's a hiding place
[1:09:05] remember God hides you in his word god
[1:09:08] hides you in front of the enemy that's
[1:09:11] why David says he will set the table in
[1:09:14] front of my enemy and I want you to
[1:09:17] understand one thing this don't think
[1:09:19] that the devil does not walk through the
[1:09:21] door this morning he already started
[1:09:24] with the with the with the
[1:09:27] equipment yes when I see that I know man
[1:09:29] God is going to be good
[1:09:30] today I thank God already for problems
[1:09:33] in the sound I say Lord we know if he
[1:09:36] you know if if the devil starts to move
[1:09:38] around and trying to disrupt there must
[1:09:40] be something that you're going to do
[1:09:41] today and he's trying to get our mind
[1:09:44] off the matter so he comes and he comes
[1:09:47] in and we understand that the Tower of
[1:09:49] the Lord the name of the Lord is a tower
[1:09:51] and he will said I will set your table
[1:09:55] yeah
[1:09:55] not in secret yeah but in front of your
[1:09:59] enemy actually God wants Satan to be
[1:10:02] present that's right every time he deals
[1:10:05] with these people that's right he wants
[1:10:07] him there that's right so sometimes we
[1:10:10] think you know what we it's a church is
[1:10:11] a place where Satan is not allowed no
[1:10:13] he's
[1:10:14] invited every
[1:10:16] meeting it's true right invited to come
[1:10:20] and look to come and try and disrupt to
[1:10:24] come and try and get you to do something
[1:10:26] else that's how God conquers him God's
[1:10:29] not scared of the devil God is not here
[1:10:31] to say you know what let's keep him away
[1:10:33] from you God says you will overcome the
[1:10:36] enemy in Satan's
[1:10:38] Eden sir so how can God restrict him God
[1:10:41] doesn't restrict him in that way he said
[1:10:43] to him have you considered my bride in
[1:10:46] 2024 she will never leave my word she
[1:10:49] will never go away from it she will be
[1:10:54] true so how can God make those
[1:10:56] statements If he if he hinders
[1:10:58] him that's why when the sound comes like
[1:11:00] that you must already get excited and my
[1:11:03] this morning is going to be good
[1:11:05] Hallelujah and it happens like that in
[1:11:07] every Church the sound can be perfect
[1:11:09] before the service but wait till it
[1:11:12] starts man oh man then everything fails
[1:11:16] then you must already get excited start
[1:11:17] to thank God so we know why do we come
[1:11:21] to church to prophesy the seat is not
[1:11:23] air with the Chuck he says may there not
[1:11:25] be any feeble Among Us after the service
[1:11:27] tonight and above all things may there
[1:11:29] not be one unbeliever left may they all
[1:11:33] believe to eternal life for that's our
[1:11:35] purpose of gathering here that's may we
[1:11:38] all believe unto eternal life that's our
[1:11:42] purpose of gathering to increase Faith
[1:11:44] to get a better picture of God to get a
[1:11:47] picture of me and to walk out of here a
[1:11:50] conqueror like the man that had a sick
[1:11:52] child that is for many many years at
[1:11:54] that foreign sickness and after the
[1:11:57] Mount of transfiguration Jesus come down
[1:11:59] from the mountain and here he founds the
[1:12:00] scribes and the people the the the the
[1:12:03] the disciples this man with his child in
[1:12:05] a big
[1:12:07] commotion that's and he comes he says
[1:12:09] what's the problem the man comes to me
[1:12:12] he says I've asked your disciples to
[1:12:14] heal my son but they cannot do it he
[1:12:17] says oh your faithless generation how
[1:12:19] long will I suffer you and he talks with
[1:12:21] them and he ask how long has the child
[1:12:23] be like that he says from his birth he's
[1:12:24] like this and he's like that you know
[1:12:26] and the Lord said to him if you can
[1:12:29] believe all things are
[1:12:32] possible and the man immediately caught
[1:12:34] the Revelation he says Lord I believe
[1:12:37] but help my
[1:12:39] unbelief what is that it's it's a
[1:12:41] paradox that you know what there's a
[1:12:43] faith but there's also a battle that
[1:12:45] wants to hinder our faith and that is my
[1:12:47] prayer every day Lord I'm a Believer but
[1:12:50] help my unbelief remove it from me oh
[1:12:52] God which is the flesh
[1:12:55] amen your flesh can never be a
[1:12:59] believer you have to understand the
[1:13:02] concept you can be in the message
[1:13:04] baptized with the Holy Spirit for 100
[1:13:06] years the flesh does not
[1:13:08] change you cannot make him a Believer
[1:13:12] you cannot that's why some people say
[1:13:14] okay I'm going to teach the flesh a
[1:13:15] lesson I used to work with somebody and
[1:13:19] this person you know it was just shortly
[1:13:21] after I got saved and then you start to
[1:13:23] talk about the Lord and then you start
[1:13:25] to discover there's other believers
[1:13:27] around and so on people with different
[1:13:29] opinions different visions and different
[1:13:30] things and I could see that my one
[1:13:33] colleague he was very uncomfortable he
[1:13:35] walked very strange when he walks and I
[1:13:38] said what's wrong says no I'm busy
[1:13:41] putting the Flesh in
[1:13:42] subjection so wow how do you do that he
[1:13:46] says no I've got a a band that I put
[1:13:48] around my waist a rough cloth every time
[1:13:53] I W I move it P it it it it scratches me
[1:13:57] and it makes the flesh to
[1:13:59] pain and that's the way I'm going to
[1:14:00] teach the flesh to be subject and I
[1:14:03] thought my how can it be that that that
[1:14:06] that man will go to such depths to try
[1:14:09] and place the Flesh in
[1:14:11] subjection where the word says you can
[1:14:13] never you can never make him a Believer
[1:14:17] the only thing that can place the flesh
[1:14:19] subject is the holy spirit if you get
[1:14:21] the Holy Spirit then the flesh becomes
[1:14:23] subject to the Holy Spirit and then you
[1:14:25] can control it because the flesh is a
[1:14:28] powerful
[1:14:29] entity powerful you cannot control it
[1:14:34] how many New Year's resolutions did you
[1:14:37] do every year I'm going to stop this I'm
[1:14:41] going to start doing this and it lasts
[1:14:42] maybe one two three if you're good four
[1:14:44] weeks four weeks then then you finish to
[1:14:46] you know I'm going to lose weight this
[1:14:48] year flesh is oh that's good to
[1:14:52] you and every time you walk past the
[1:14:54] McDonald's you smell those chips and you
[1:14:57] you know and you're looking for an
[1:14:58] excuse you know my blood sugar is low I
[1:15:00] need some something
[1:15:02] now and before you know it that
[1:15:04] resolution is out of the
[1:15:06] window that's how powerful it is you
[1:15:09] know even with the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:15:11] why it's so important to understand with
[1:15:13] spiritual matters you only go to the
[1:15:16] word and to what has been revealed and
[1:15:17] what you hear you don't dictate to the
[1:15:20] flesh because the flesh can never
[1:15:22] understand God it can never worship God
[1:15:26] you worship from the inner man then you
[1:15:28] tell your flesh you're going to raise
[1:15:29] your hands this morning and you're going
[1:15:30] to clap it and you tell your voice I'm
[1:15:32] going to say amen and you take control
[1:15:34] of the Flesh and then it becomes a
[1:15:36] vessel worthy to praise God in the way
[1:15:39] that he wants us to
[1:15:41] do and God healed that man's sick child
[1:15:45] but he says Lord I believe but help my
[1:15:47] unbelief a paradx statement that we can
[1:15:51] understand Philippians 2:3 the word says
[1:15:54] do nothing from selfish or empty
[1:15:57] conceit but with
[1:16:00] humility being neither arrogant nor
[1:16:03] self-righteous regarding others as more
[1:16:05] important than
[1:16:07] yourself it's a it's it's a
[1:16:10] key to look at everybody around you and
[1:16:13] and and and and say to yourself this
[1:16:15] person is more important than
[1:16:19] me even the lowest in the church is more
[1:16:22] important than me
[1:16:25] that's how he describes how we should
[1:16:27] look at one another and how we should
[1:16:29] you know uh interact with one another to
[1:16:32] know that you know what I I I I am the
[1:16:34] lowest I'm the servant of all because
[1:16:37] Paul says don't look out for your own
[1:16:39] interest but look out for the interest
[1:16:40] of others as
[1:16:42] well now the mind of God is different
[1:16:45] than your mind yeah that's right and
[1:16:48] that's where most of our troubles come
[1:16:49] from we examine life from this
[1:16:52] perspective here not from here you
[1:16:54] should learn to look from here yeah like
[1:16:57] I said if you look from here you see
[1:16:59] flesh if you look from here I see God if
[1:17:01] I look from here I see different things
[1:17:04] I see your shortcomings I see your
[1:17:05] failings but if I look from here I see
[1:17:07] the grace of God so we must always learn
[1:17:10] to if if if you look at somebody from
[1:17:12] here and you you feel you feel
[1:17:13] antagonistic you feel I can't just
[1:17:15] change your looking say Lord let me look
[1:17:17] like you look look through the blood
[1:17:20] look through the grace look through
[1:17:22] God's perspective and you will see a
[1:17:23] different picture you'll see a
[1:17:25] completely different picture that's the
[1:17:28] way God wants us to look at this now if
[1:17:31] you think about it um the Bible in Acts
[1:17:34] 12 speaks about uh James and Peter is
[1:17:38] that right the Bible says that Herod
[1:17:40] came and he killed James with the SW
[1:17:43] sword all right he killed him with the
[1:17:47] sword that's how he starts he killed him
[1:17:50] with the
[1:17:51] sword like like it's easy Bible says he
[1:17:55] just started to Vex the church and he
[1:17:58] called James in and he took the sword
[1:17:59] and he killed
[1:18:01] him and the crowd
[1:18:03] roared they were
[1:18:05] excited and he says oh this is good they
[1:18:08] love what I'm doing he says bring Peter
[1:18:10] lock him up because it's Passover we'll
[1:18:13] deal with him next week we can't kill a
[1:18:16] believer in
[1:18:17] church like many times we rage battles
[1:18:21] we'll fight until we come to church and
[1:18:22] church we worship together oh thank you
[1:18:25] Jesus God bless you brother God bless
[1:18:27] you Sister Monday the whatsapp's or what
[1:18:29] is
[1:18:30] Flowing battle is
[1:18:32] Raging but we shouldn't do that we
[1:18:35] should walk from here free at Liberty to
[1:18:39] say Lord I am free and I'm free indeed
[1:18:42] so he takes James he kills him he locks
[1:18:44] up Peter and he says I'll deal with him
[1:18:45] when Passover is finished and Peter is
[1:18:48] locked up in prison he's there in the
[1:18:50] inner prison around 16 gods and you know
[1:18:53] how it goes and the the Bible says he is
[1:18:56] sleeping all right he is
[1:19:00] sleeping acts
[1:19:02] 12:6 and when Herod would have brought
[1:19:05] him forth the same night Peter was
[1:19:07] sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with
[1:19:09] two chains and the keepers before the
[1:19:11] door kept the prison now notice how how
[1:19:14] can you sleep when you're locked up like
[1:19:15] that knowing tomorrow I'm
[1:19:18] dead but he's
[1:19:21] sleeping why because there's a church
[1:19:23] that's praying for him
[1:19:26] there's a church that's in the gap for
[1:19:27] him that's how we should our life should
[1:19:30] be when you're in trouble you should be
[1:19:32] so at peace because you know the church
[1:19:34] is praying for me there is people that's
[1:19:36] lifting up my hands I'm not alone in
[1:19:38] this battle there is people that really
[1:19:41] intercedes for me and he's sleeping and
[1:19:43] in verse 7 and behold the angel of the
[1:19:44] Lord came upon him the light shined in
[1:19:47] the prison and he smoked Peter on the
[1:19:49] side raised him up saying arise up
[1:19:52] quickly and he CH and the chain fell up
[1:19:54] from his hands
[1:19:55] the angel said unto him G thyself and
[1:19:57] bind on thy
[1:19:59] sandals and so he did and he said unto
[1:20:02] him cast thy garments about there and
[1:20:03] follow
[1:20:04] me now you can imagine that the angel
[1:20:07] had to kick Peter in the side such a
[1:20:10] deep
[1:20:11] sleep kicking him wake up Peter and when
[1:20:14] Peter woke up the change W he jumped up
[1:20:17] and he was ready to run for the door
[1:20:19] then youel say
[1:20:21] stop sandals clothes take make it easy
[1:20:25] Peter you're running and you're getting
[1:20:28] excited is not going to help anybody
[1:20:30] when I'm here I'm in control when God is
[1:20:33] in your life he is in control don't get
[1:20:35] over excited don't run this way that way
[1:20:38] say Lord I'm following you carefully
[1:20:40] every day Lord I'm following in the
[1:20:43] footsteps of the Lamb amen and Peter was
[1:20:46] excited and the angel says whoa no no no
[1:20:48] your sandals put it on how long does it
[1:20:51] take on to put sandals and clothes and
[1:20:54] jacket he says you leave nothing behind
[1:20:56] Hallelujah the angel didn't run out of
[1:20:58] prison he
[1:21:00] walked because that's the key when God
[1:21:03] is in your life he is in control no
[1:21:06] worry no no no Panic no nothing is going
[1:21:09] to change the situation trust the Lord
[1:21:12] to say Lord Jesus I'm not going to
[1:21:15] panic I'm trusting you and the Bible
[1:21:19] says as they walked out every door
[1:21:21] opened and closed behind them as the
[1:21:24] angel come that that iron door just
[1:21:25] Swang open and Peter only to follow the
[1:21:28] angel he had nothing to do but to
[1:21:32] follow nothing and he followed him and
[1:21:35] when outside the angel
[1:21:37] disappeared now the question is always
[1:21:40] in our minds that when we come up to
[1:21:42] this point is why did God kill James and
[1:21:44] save
[1:21:45] Peter both
[1:21:47] Apostles both the
[1:21:49] elite both of the three were always
[1:21:52] together when there was a resurrection
[1:21:54] faith hope and love was called in yeah
[1:21:57] that's right and when we look at these
[1:21:59] things we start to compare we can ask
[1:22:01] but Lord why was Peter more special than
[1:22:05] James but it's not like that God says
[1:22:09] James I'm going to make you a
[1:22:10] Marty that's the end of it God allowed
[1:22:15] for his life to end in that way and God
[1:22:18] don't write a long story about it God
[1:22:20] just says Herod took the sword and he
[1:22:21] killed him because God doesn't think
[1:22:24] like us but Peter he saves him because
[1:22:27] he still has got a work for Peter to do
[1:22:30] yeah nothing can take your life before
[1:22:32] God is finished with you I don't care
[1:22:35] what it is God is in
[1:22:37] control nothing can disrupt God's plan
[1:22:41] but we human reasoning would ask certain
[1:22:43] things how do you know God loves
[1:22:46] you not because you've got a good job
[1:22:50] not because you were born in New Zealand
[1:22:52] my thank God I wasn't born in Africa
[1:22:55] you know we think like that thank the
[1:22:58] Lord for this and this no you only know
[1:23:00] God loves you one one way and one way
[1:23:03] only that's why by election
[1:23:06] amen he might never give you money
[1:23:10] that's right he loves me amen am he
[1:23:13] might never heal your body he still
[1:23:15] loves me amen that's he might never
[1:23:18] answer one
[1:23:20] prayer he still loves me amen because he
[1:23:23] called me open my eyes I saw my name
[1:23:26] written in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:23:28] therefore I know he loves me it's not
[1:23:30] based on what he gives me or what he
[1:23:32] doesn't give me it's based on elective
[1:23:35] love that's why a Son of God can pray
[1:23:38] Lord not my will but let thy will be
[1:23:40] done because I know father God you've
[1:23:43] got the best interest for me at heart I
[1:23:45] don't want anything that you don't want
[1:23:47] to give
[1:23:48] me because sometimes God says no
[1:23:52] amen too many times we hear you know God
[1:23:54] will give you every no he won't yeah
[1:23:57] even if it's in his word he
[1:24:00] won't if it's his will he
[1:24:02] will he can heal your sick body right
[1:24:06] now but we need to learn to trust him
[1:24:09] amen we need to believe like I'm a
[1:24:11] believer of Divine Healing
[1:24:14] 100% but sometimes I walk for years with
[1:24:16] something that I'm battling with the
[1:24:19] prophet he made a mistake and he
[1:24:20] suffered for two years in his body you
[1:24:24] know things happen God allows things
[1:24:26] there's there's certain things happen we
[1:24:28] must learn to know that God is in
[1:24:31] control check your life and make sure
[1:24:33] all your sin is under the blood and you
[1:24:35] walk forward every day and say Lord the
[1:24:37] footsteps of the righteous are for
[1:24:39] ordained I trust you
[1:24:41] explicitly that's the thing we need to
[1:24:43] do because God's love is only proven by
[1:24:46] election so we as I said in the
[1:24:49] beginning remember we are not in a
[1:24:51] spiritual competition amen
[1:24:55] is that
[1:24:57] true you are not in a spiritual
[1:24:59] competition that's right do you see how
[1:25:02] many who read the most message books
[1:25:04] this
[1:25:05] week who fasted who fasted for three
[1:25:08] days this
[1:25:09] week nobody two
[1:25:12] days one day thank you sister one
[1:25:16] day 1 hour
[1:25:20] yes you know so what are we doing we're
[1:25:22] not in a competition you do is God leads
[1:25:25] you and it's between you and God and we
[1:25:29] are at Liberty we are free to worship
[1:25:31] God the the way that he made us to be an
[1:25:33] expression but we are not interested to
[1:25:35] see who's the most spiritual who is the
[1:25:37] most knowledgeable who is the best
[1:25:39] because we are all saved by
[1:25:42] grace we are all under the same Grace
[1:25:46] and that's a very key and important
[1:25:48] point to understand that by grace and by
[1:25:51] grace alone so what should we do we
[1:25:54] should rather support one another
[1:25:57] support gifts that God placed in the
[1:25:58] church to be able to get strength from
[1:26:01] one another if God starts to use
[1:26:03] somebody in the church rally behind that
[1:26:05] gift and lift it up don't say Lord it
[1:26:08] should have been
[1:26:09] me I think I I deserve no you know God
[1:26:13] is God he's in control everything is
[1:26:15] under his mighty name amen Luke chapter
[1:26:18] 22: 40 Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:26:22] now remember the prophet says the
[1:26:24] victory was not one in Calvary the
[1:26:27] victory was one in
[1:26:29] Gethsemane when Jesus Took the decision
[1:26:32] he's going to die for the church the
[1:26:34] victory was done from there he is a lamb
[1:26:37] to the slaughter he never spoke he never
[1:26:39] just followed them as they led him as
[1:26:41] they beat him and everything but the
[1:26:42] decision was done in Gethsemane but
[1:26:44] listen to this and when he was at that
[1:26:46] place he said unto them pray that you
[1:26:48] enter not into temptation and he was
[1:26:51] withdrawn from them about a stone cast
[1:26:54] and kneel down and prayed saying father
[1:26:56] if thou be willing remove this cup from
[1:26:58] me nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:27:00] done there appeared an angel unto him
[1:27:03] from Heaven strengthening him that's
[1:27:06] right now the word in flesh that's right
[1:27:10] needed a
[1:27:12] visitation to strengthen him at his
[1:27:15] greatest
[1:27:16] test greatest trial there comes a point
[1:27:20] in time where you need a visitation from
[1:27:22] God that's why when you come to church
[1:27:24] and you under great test and trials you
[1:27:26] say Lord today is my visitation speak to
[1:27:29] me Lord and give me the energy to
[1:27:31] continue another
[1:27:33] week like Jesus he was absolutely
[1:27:36] depleted and an angel was dispatched to
[1:27:38] strengthen him for the journey ahead
[1:27:41] like an Elijah who could kill 400
[1:27:43] prophets but the next day run and clam
[1:27:46] under the juniper tree to say Lord let
[1:27:47] me
[1:27:48] die let me die Lord how can you move
[1:27:52] from poar of fire 400 Kil killed Prophet
[1:27:55] to under a juniper tree in one
[1:27:58] day you remember your life is ups and
[1:28:01] it's it's it's the the mountains and The
[1:28:03] Valleys we are moving it's a journey
[1:28:05] you're not stagnant you cannot be on the
[1:28:08] mountain 24 hours a day then you are in
[1:28:12] trouble but after every Mountain
[1:28:14] experience you start to go down into the
[1:28:16] valley and you start to doubt your own
[1:28:18] testimony because the devil tells you
[1:28:20] man you have never been saved you are a
[1:28:22] liar you are a cheat and you go down
[1:28:25] there and you start to feel the
[1:28:26] loneliness but guess what very soon as
[1:28:29] the visitations of God start to come he
[1:28:32] energizes you again and you come up on
[1:28:34] the next Mountain you say Lord I am the
[1:28:36] redeemed I am a son of the Living God
[1:28:39] and so life Carries
[1:28:41] On You are never never 100% On Top of
[1:28:45] the World constantly you need to learn
[1:28:47] to trust and that's why God allows
[1:28:49] it he exposes us to many things that we
[1:28:53] learn that character is formed that we
[1:28:55] are that we are molded in the stature of
[1:28:57] a perfect man because the Bible says
[1:28:59] Jesus learned obedience by the things he
[1:29:03] suffered how are you going to learn
[1:29:05] obedience by the things you suffered
[1:29:08] people will neglect you people will
[1:29:10] leave you people will talk about you all
[1:29:12] those things God will allow it but we
[1:29:15] look at it and we
[1:29:16] cry Lord nobody loves me when God allows
[1:29:21] something you should have a different
[1:29:22] attitude you should say Lord thank you
[1:29:24] for working on my character thank you
[1:29:27] that I love that brother or sister so
[1:29:29] much I love my boss so much who's hating
[1:29:31] me I love him Lord because he's in your
[1:29:33] hand he's a tool that works on me you
[1:29:37] love me so much that you changed the
[1:29:39] boss that loves me and give me one that
[1:29:40] hates
[1:29:42] me that's how much you love me
[1:29:45] Lord we don't play like that because we
[1:29:47] don't see it like that we come to church
[1:29:49] oh pray for my boss he's going to kill
[1:29:50] me you should say pray that God will
[1:29:53] bless my boss because he's the right one
[1:29:55] he's mouring my character he's pulling
[1:29:57] things out of me which I know that
[1:29:58] wasn't
[1:29:59] there all of a sudden I want to strangle
[1:30:03] him wonder where does that come from oh
[1:30:06] my I'm a Believer but now I've got
[1:30:09] thoughts of I take I'll take mat in my
[1:30:12] own hands that's God's grace to show you
[1:30:15] that you need to work on that character
[1:30:17] to say Lord just make me more like you
[1:30:20] let me die
[1:30:22] more and that's the way we as Believers
[1:30:24] that's why God allows it that's why it
[1:30:26] works in our lives so angels will come
[1:30:30] Elijah God sends an angel to make him
[1:30:32] food wake him up
[1:30:35] eat he sleeps again he wakes him up
[1:30:37] again he says eat the journey is hot
[1:30:40] this food is going to sustain you the
[1:30:42] word so remember Jesus Christ at at
[1:30:47] appointments he had his whole life from
[1:30:50] the day he was born till the day he died
[1:30:53] was filled with
[1:30:55] appointments at certain times certain
[1:30:57] dates he meet certain people it was
[1:30:59] prescheduled no no accidental meetings
[1:31:02] no accidental appointments it was all
[1:31:05] pre-planned and prescheduled like the
[1:31:07] woman at the well he met her he had an
[1:31:11] appointment with her so that morning he
[1:31:13] woke up and he knew this is the day for
[1:31:16] her and all of a sudden he says to the
[1:31:18] disciples go and buy
[1:31:20] food like I always say brother PA you
[1:31:23] will know
[1:31:24] when I tell the brothers we work at
[1:31:25] church I say go and buy us
[1:31:27] food they want to go five or six
[1:31:30] together cuz they talk a lot and they
[1:31:32] say stay away for 3 hours so I've
[1:31:34] learned I said no only one you choose
[1:31:36] which one but one only because he'll
[1:31:37] come back
[1:31:39] quickly but how many brothers do you
[1:31:41] need to carry food for 12
[1:31:43] people not a lot but he sends all of
[1:31:46] them as you all go buy
[1:31:48] food and he sits there on the wall he
[1:31:50] waits for
[1:31:51] her because this is a private
[1:31:54] meeting with a woman that is so deep in
[1:31:57] sin and
[1:31:58] shame that he knew if the things I'm
[1:32:00] going to say to her is going to
[1:32:01] embarrass her and God's not in the
[1:32:04] business of embarrassing us God's not in
[1:32:06] the business of exposing your sin to
[1:32:08] embarrass you God's in the business to
[1:32:10] convict you of your sin that you can
[1:32:12] repent but God will always treat you and
[1:32:14] protect you because he's not there to
[1:32:16] shame you he's not there to humiliate
[1:32:19] you he's there to bring you to the Cross
[1:32:21] to say you are mine and I bought you
[1:32:23] with the PR that's why since the day I
[1:32:25] met Jesus Christ I have never been
[1:32:28] humiliated I have never felt that he
[1:32:30] hates me I have never felt that he I I
[1:32:34] serve him because I'm going to go to
[1:32:36] hell I have never felt that because he
[1:32:38] called me and he says you follow me I'll
[1:32:41] bless you I'll help you you'll be and I
[1:32:43] love to follow him freely you know what
[1:32:46] I love that that's right nobody forces
[1:32:49] you nobody puts a guns against your head
[1:32:51] to say you know I'm going to kill you if
[1:32:52] you don't follow Jesus
[1:32:54] you made that decision yourself that's
[1:32:57] right and you've never went back on that
[1:32:59] decision because he doesn't force you to
[1:33:02] do
[1:33:03] anything he calls you and he says follow
[1:33:05] me my sheep he my voice stranger they
[1:33:08] won't follow and so that's why the
[1:33:10] message is not a lot of rules and
[1:33:12] regulations dos and don'ts it's about
[1:33:15] the love of God being exposed to you and
[1:33:18] once you see the love of God you start
[1:33:19] to realize the mind of God and you lay
[1:33:22] down your own ideas and you know this
[1:33:23] this is how God's mind work and I'll
[1:33:26] gladly follow him because he is the one
[1:33:29] it is the way to get into the mind of
[1:33:31] God is to have a prophet reveal the word
[1:33:34] to us and it gives us a deeper
[1:33:36] understanding of what does this God want
[1:33:38] like an Esther all the king's wife has
[1:33:42] humiliated him he puts away a feros and
[1:33:44] he says I need a new wife and they
[1:33:46] gather all the virgins and as they
[1:33:49] prepare to meet the king everyone gets
[1:33:51] rejected
[1:33:54] one after the other one but Esther she
[1:33:57] goes to the king's chamber the one who
[1:33:59] looking after them she knows there's
[1:34:01] somebody here that knows the king he ask
[1:34:04] him how is the king how does he look no
[1:34:07] he's tall he's blunt he's this he's that
[1:34:09] what does he
[1:34:11] like what is his food
[1:34:14] taste you know all that every little
[1:34:17] detail she could get from him and she
[1:34:19] start to get the mind of the king
[1:34:21] through that interpreter and and he
[1:34:23] tells her all these things and she takes
[1:34:25] it she takes it she applies it she
[1:34:27] applies it she applies it and the night
[1:34:29] when she needs to go when she walks into
[1:34:31] the king's chamber he looks at her he
[1:34:33] was
[1:34:35] shocked to see himself in the famin
[1:34:39] spot he was absolutely blown away
[1:34:43] because no man can hate himself and
[1:34:45] that's how when I stand before Jesus
[1:34:47] Christ I want to stand that he can see
[1:34:49] the feminine part of himself in me
[1:34:51] because he will never reject you if you
[1:34:53] stand there clothed by the word he can
[1:34:56] never leave you behind he will take you
[1:34:58] that's but don't come with your own
[1:35:00] ideas and your own issues and your eoms
[1:35:02] and think he's going to accept you he
[1:35:03] can never that's why God sends us a
[1:35:06] prophet to reveal the word so that we
[1:35:08] know the mind of God not that we can
[1:35:11] worship the prophet but that we can get
[1:35:13] the mind of God to turn back to God to
[1:35:15] say Lord this is
[1:35:17] true
[1:35:18] amen so the woman comes to the
[1:35:21] well Jesus looks at her he says
[1:35:24] say get me some water please now this
[1:35:27] woman wasn't very quiet
[1:35:31] type she spoke up very
[1:35:33] well she was very feisty we would call
[1:35:36] it when he spoke to her she immediately
[1:35:39] you're not allowed to speak to me you
[1:35:41] are a
[1:35:42] Jew you know and he says if you knew
[1:35:46] who's speaking to you you'll ask me for
[1:35:47] water he says why are you how are you
[1:35:49] going to get what you don't even have a
[1:35:51] bucket so you can see the conversation
[1:35:53] was
[1:35:54] going God wants you to be real don't be
[1:35:58] something that you're not don't try and
[1:36:01] be something that you're not don't try
[1:36:02] and be somebody else be what God made
[1:36:05] you to be to say Lord this is the way
[1:36:07] you made me and this is the way I'm
[1:36:09] going to Worship You Preach the way that
[1:36:12] God made you serve him that God the way
[1:36:14] made you bless him the way God Made You
[1:36:17] Right some of us can shout amen glory
[1:36:21] the other one can say amen glory it's
[1:36:23] the same thing to
[1:36:25] God don't measure to other
[1:36:27] people you express and you express from
[1:36:31] your heart and don't compare don't say
[1:36:34] but she told him you don't even have a
[1:36:36] bucket why are you going to get me water
[1:36:38] says go get your husband she says I have
[1:36:41] no husband and he says to her yes you
[1:36:44] had five and the one you're living with
[1:36:45] now is not your
[1:36:47] husband what does he do she says wow
[1:36:51] when the Messiah come we know he will do
[1:36:53] these things that's right says it's me
[1:36:55] speaking to you and she dropped
[1:36:57] everything run into a city and converted
[1:36:59] a whole little town by the testimony by
[1:37:02] come see who I found and that woman
[1:37:05] you're going to find in heaven she had a
[1:37:08] predestinated appointment with the Lord
[1:37:10] Jesus Christ it was a private meeting
[1:37:12] there there was no Witnesses but herself
[1:37:15] and Jesus Christ because the things he's
[1:37:17] going to tell her would make me make
[1:37:19] people blush around her but when he
[1:37:21] tells her she repents that's right she
[1:37:23] stops living in sin and her whole life
[1:37:26] is completely turned around that's how
[1:37:29] God does things that's why when the
[1:37:31] prophet calls up people in the prayer
[1:37:32] line he says confess your sin before you
[1:37:34] come here because God will reveal it why
[1:37:37] did he warn them because God doesn't
[1:37:38] want to humiliate them God is there but
[1:37:42] Satan will humiliate you he will gossip
[1:37:43] about you have you heard sister so and
[1:37:47] so
[1:37:49] wow I never knew that have you heard
[1:37:52] brothers so and so the devil is the
[1:37:55] gossiper the devil is the one trying to
[1:37:58] break the influence the devil is the one
[1:37:59] who causes the problem God never gossips
[1:38:02] that's right God never tells stories
[1:38:06] he's not in that business but the devil
[1:38:08] is the one who does these things so you
[1:38:11] must be careful when one starts to ask
[1:38:13] what's your motive and objective why do
[1:38:15] I need to tell the story what is the or
[1:38:17] can I rather go and pray or talk to the
[1:38:19] person or can I encourage them what can
[1:38:21] I do differently than to gossip or do
[1:38:24] things that's not supposed to happen
[1:38:27] that's Job 1 verse
[1:38:30] 6 Job chapter 1:
[1:38:34] 6 now there was a day when the sons of
[1:38:36] God came to present themselves before
[1:38:38] the Lord and Satan came also among
[1:38:41] them so we spoke about it
[1:38:45] earlier Satan was found among them in
[1:38:47] verse 7 and the Lord said unto Satan
[1:38:49] when where comest thou and Satan
[1:38:50] answered the Lord and said from going to
[1:38:52] and fr the Earth and from walking up and
[1:38:54] down in it he never said to him what are
[1:38:57] you doing here Satan
[1:38:58] out who was presenting themselves The
[1:39:00] Sons and Daughters of God and Satan
[1:39:04] among
[1:39:06] them so when we come to
[1:39:10] church Satan Among
[1:39:12] Us I'll read you the quote just now but
[1:39:16] he comes why does he come he comes you
[1:39:18] to put you in the mall while you're in
[1:39:20] church to put you somewhere else because
[1:39:22] your mind can drift in a second you can
[1:39:25] fall asleep in two seconds I mean you
[1:39:28] walk in here you had such a good night's
[1:39:29] rest you're so fresh when you sit
[1:39:32] down if you my what happened to me
[1:39:35] that's Satan's work but we should be
[1:39:38] vigilant when you know that Satan is
[1:39:40] also here you look at it differently
[1:39:42] when your mind start to drift you must
[1:39:44] know that's the enemy bring it back and
[1:39:46] say amen glory to God thank you brother
[1:39:49] for saying that you know be engaged in
[1:39:52] the meeting when you feel tired engage
[1:39:55] in the meeting by just saying an amen or
[1:39:57] raising your hands or clapping or do
[1:39:59] something but engage because the enemy
[1:40:02] is here to rob you of a blessing that's
[1:40:05] right so once you understand that when
[1:40:07] the sons of God were coming before God
[1:40:09] Satan was among
[1:40:10] them and he's just there to accuse he's
[1:40:14] not there to worship he's not there to
[1:40:15] do anything but to accuse and who who
[1:40:18] who engaged him God himself yeah God
[1:40:22] says well
[1:40:24] welcome where have you been you know we
[1:40:27] think God God's not scared of Satan God
[1:40:30] created him he's got a role to play in
[1:40:34] your life he's got a role to play he's
[1:40:36] there to hone you to to rub you he's
[1:40:38] there he's playing that role and when we
[1:40:40] come to church he's playing another role
[1:40:42] so God says Where Have You Been he says
[1:40:44] up and down the Earth then God says have
[1:40:46] you seen my little bride there in New
[1:40:49] Zealand or wherever you are you know and
[1:40:52] God entices
[1:40:53] him that's right God pulls him into the
[1:40:57] conversation God engages him and directs
[1:41:00] his attention to
[1:41:01] somebody have you considered my servant
[1:41:04] job while you were walking up and down
[1:41:05] the Earth he says yes I've looked at him
[1:41:08] but you have protected him you have kept
[1:41:11] a hedge around him a big fence give just
[1:41:13] open the fence and he'll curse you in
[1:41:15] your face God says go take him but don't
[1:41:18] take his life he's in your power
[1:41:21] remember Satan has got limited power
[1:41:23] amen the power he has got is what God
[1:41:25] allows him to have he's not the Creator
[1:41:28] he cannot create he cannot do anything
[1:41:31] he is subject to the authority and Rule
[1:41:34] of the Living
[1:41:36] God and so it goes on and Satan leaves
[1:41:40] there and he went from the presence of
[1:41:42] the Lord and he starts to attack job is
[1:41:46] that true now in the testimony on the
[1:41:48] sea the prophet says that's the way it
[1:41:50] is it's always a mixed crowd believers
[1:41:53] make Believers and unbelievers always
[1:41:54] conglomerate
[1:41:56] together there they are even when the
[1:41:58] sons of God came up before God in the
[1:42:00] Book of Job he said Satan was sitting
[1:42:02] among them so he ties that down what's
[1:42:05] happening in church he says it's
[1:42:06] happened in heaven because we are a
[1:42:09] type so if Satan is there he says
[1:42:12] presenting him there he also comes here
[1:42:14] to disrupt to get your mind off the word
[1:42:17] to to rob you to tell you it's not for
[1:42:19] you many things he can do and you should
[1:42:22] realize and you start to discerned to to
[1:42:24] push him away to say Lord take this fog
[1:42:27] away from my mind let me focus on you
[1:42:29] Lord Jesus let me break through and let
[1:42:31] me understand now remember even in the
[1:42:33] prophet's message Satan was there
[1:42:37] yeah the Lord comes to him one day he
[1:42:39] says there's a trap set for you the Lord
[1:42:42] doesn't tell him what's the
[1:42:43] Trap you know if if if if if if the Lord
[1:42:47] tells me something I want him to tell me
[1:42:48] the the the the details there's a trap
[1:42:51] set for you tomorrow when you fly back
[1:42:52] the plane is going going to fall from
[1:42:53] the sky and you're going to be dead or
[1:42:55] something you wanted the specifics but
[1:42:58] all the Lord says is there's a trap set
[1:43:00] for you now he's watching doesn't know
[1:43:04] where doesn't know how he doesn't know
[1:43:05] when he doesn't know who's going to do
[1:43:06] it he's got no idea but he's now
[1:43:08] Vigilant he's now he's now he's now
[1:43:10] aware that there's a trap and every time
[1:43:13] you come to church you must know there's
[1:43:15] a trap set for me somebody's going to
[1:43:17] sit at my
[1:43:20] seat man for a Believer that's a big
[1:43:22] trap
[1:43:23] cuz I've sat there for 5 Years everybody
[1:43:25] know it's my
[1:43:28] seat so traps when you see that you
[1:43:31] should realize oh devil I've seen you
[1:43:34] and you bless God bless you brother
[1:43:35] thank you for keeping my seat warm I'll
[1:43:37] sit at the back may you have a good time
[1:43:39] amen you know so we engage but we must
[1:43:41] be vigilant we must be there we must be
[1:43:44] we are believers we think it's just just
[1:43:47] no there is spiritual things happening
[1:43:50] around us so the prophet comes to the
[1:43:52] meeting one one day and then uh I think
[1:43:55] it was 2 or 3 days later he says I'm in
[1:43:57] the meeting I'm
[1:43:59] preaching and the next moment a young
[1:44:01] boy and a young woman in the front start
[1:44:03] to kiss one
[1:44:04] another who's
[1:44:06] that Satan present he doesn't care if
[1:44:10] the pillar of fire is there or not
[1:44:12] remember that's that's the
[1:44:15] key and he he tells them stop and he
[1:44:19] continue preaching and they don't stop
[1:44:21] they go on further
[1:44:24] and as he preached they they he says at
[1:44:26] some point the young boy almost start to
[1:44:27] climb on top of the young girl in
[1:44:31] church in front of Malachi 4 the
[1:44:34] Vindicated prophet of
[1:44:37] God Satan doesn't care who you are where
[1:44:39] you come from it doesn't care if you've
[1:44:42] got the holy ghost or not he's there to
[1:44:44] trick you to to to to to to put a trap
[1:44:46] for you and he says I looked at them and
[1:44:50] all of a sudden the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:44:52] me me and says to me they in your hands
[1:44:55] whatever you do now say it's going to
[1:44:57] happen now how that's a trap because
[1:45:01] they've Disturbed the meeting they have
[1:45:03] done things which should not be happen
[1:45:05] in church and now in his mind he's got a
[1:45:08] battle so what should I do next I can
[1:45:10] kill them because they disregarded God
[1:45:14] they disrespected me I can do many
[1:45:16] things he says and then it comes over me
[1:45:19] and I say to them I forgive you so when
[1:45:22] I said I forgive you he says the Holy
[1:45:26] Ghost fell like a blanket on that church
[1:45:28] and it was just like a haze and people
[1:45:30] got healed and the the spirit was so
[1:45:33] pleased with him identifying the Trap
[1:45:36] and overcoming it that it overruled
[1:45:38] Satan and that then became nothing am
[1:45:42] the people then forgot about that they
[1:45:43] raised up in the presence and they said
[1:45:45] I am healed and everybody got delived
[1:45:47] and there was a mighty outpouring and
[1:45:49] the devil lost
[1:45:51] face don't give the devil Glory don't
[1:45:53] give him the point overcome him every
[1:45:56] time you come and I promise you God will
[1:45:58] bless
[1:46:00] you but be vigilant look at the Trap
[1:46:04] don't let him deceive you but we walk
[1:46:07] out of your dis you know dishearted I
[1:46:10] was disappointed today I was this
[1:46:12] happened or that or that didn't you know
[1:46:14] many things can happen we must learn to
[1:46:16] be vigilant to know I am here with the
[1:46:18] pillar of fire you are here we are
[1:46:20] bringing the presence of God and
[1:46:21] anything can happen
[1:46:23] but we need to overcome that trap
[1:46:26] because remember there is spirits and
[1:46:28] they they they come and they do certain
[1:46:31] things remember when when when aab and
[1:46:34] uh was it josephat wanted to go for War
[1:46:37] and the 400 prophets came and they
[1:46:39] prophesies go you're going to
[1:46:43] conquer and josephat says isn't there
[1:46:45] one more they said AB says yes there's
[1:46:48] one more but he always speaks against me
[1:46:50] says bring him so when they collect him
[1:46:54] the collector said to him just Just for
[1:46:56] information sake 400 prophets already
[1:46:59] said the battle is going to be
[1:47:01] won putting him under pressure yeah
[1:47:04] because if 400 preacher says it this way
[1:47:06] and you you're going to come and preach
[1:47:08] something else you're under
[1:47:10] pressure and he says I can only say what
[1:47:12] God tells me to say I'm not willing to
[1:47:15] do anything but what God tells me verse
[1:47:19] 14 1 Kings chapter 22:14
[1:47:23] Micah said as the Lord liveth what the
[1:47:25] Lord saith unto me that will I speak
[1:47:28] verse 15 so he came to the king and the
[1:47:30] King said unto him Micah shall we go
[1:47:32] against R of Gilead or to battle or
[1:47:34] shall we
[1:47:35] forbear it's a
[1:47:37] question now listen to his
[1:47:40] answer and he answered to him
[1:47:45] go and
[1:47:47] prosper for the Lord shall deliver it
[1:47:49] into the hand of the king
[1:47:54] now was that truth or a
[1:47:59] lie because we know that was not what
[1:48:03] God
[1:48:04] Said and that's where the people that
[1:48:07] start to examine the message and pull it
[1:48:10] apart that's where they lose
[1:48:12] it because sometimes God allows a man to
[1:48:15] say things to stumble those that need to
[1:48:17] be
[1:48:18] stumbled if you believe this message
[1:48:20] believe it don't look for faults don't
[1:48:22] look for errors don't go and Google why
[1:48:25] is the prophet wrong Hallelujah yes sir
[1:48:28] you will always find the answers there
[1:48:29] because if you start your search like
[1:48:31] that you can pack your Bible and go home
[1:48:33] you are not for the
[1:48:34] message we want Believers in the church
[1:48:37] not people who doubt it I want my church
[1:48:39] full of Believers that come to church
[1:48:42] regardless of what they read regardless
[1:48:44] of what anybody they can write a 100
[1:48:47] books with facts that's right proving
[1:48:52] here is a fact that this Prophet
[1:48:57] lied who's going to argue with me I can
[1:49:00] point you to the
[1:49:02] scripture that's why the prophet says
[1:49:04] never
[1:49:05] dislocate never misquote never misplace
[1:49:09] amen because you'll come up the wrong
[1:49:11] way a type starts somewhere and it stops
[1:49:14] somewhere that's why our Prophet was
[1:49:16] such a god-given gift that he would know
[1:49:18] where to start the type and stop it very
[1:49:21] few men can do that
[1:49:23] because if you run the type too long you
[1:49:24] end up wrong you know that's why you
[1:49:27] need God's
[1:49:28] inspiration even as a minister you need
[1:49:30] God's inspiration to know how to draw
[1:49:32] from that inspiration from the prophet
[1:49:34] and bring it forth otherwise you end up
[1:49:36] wrong but here he tells him go God is
[1:49:39] going to prosper you you're going to win
[1:49:41] oh let's give the Lord a hand aab is
[1:49:43] going to
[1:49:46] win that's what he said to
[1:49:49] him
[1:49:50] yes now listen to
[1:49:53] his reaction verse 16 and the King said
[1:49:56] unto him how many times shall I adure
[1:49:59] Thee that thou tell me nothing but that
[1:50:02] which is true in the name of the
[1:50:04] Lord he had enough
[1:50:06] sense you know if that Prophet doesn't
[1:50:09] add thus say of the Lord he's playing
[1:50:11] with
[1:50:13] me that's why when you have thus say of
[1:50:15] the Lord you can lay your hand on and
[1:50:17] say Lord I believe it it is true it is
[1:50:20] mine it is mine to believe
[1:50:23] Hallelujah so the king rebuked him he
[1:50:25] says stop
[1:50:26] it I caught you out you didn't add th
[1:50:29] save the
[1:50:30] Lord then he says I
[1:50:33] see the counsel of God I see God calling
[1:50:37] all his men together I see God is asking
[1:50:41] them how are we going to get Elijah's
[1:50:42] prophecy fulfilled that aab should
[1:50:45] die how are we going to do it he says
[1:50:48] and the Bible says one says this and the
[1:50:49] other one says this and the other one
[1:50:51] says this a discussion
[1:50:54] and a lying Spirit came from Hell
[1:50:56] presenting him Before the Throne of God
[1:50:58] they are not scared to present thems
[1:51:02] there a lying spirit in the throne room
[1:51:06] that's why a lying Spirit can come
[1:51:08] behind the poopet and he can lie to you
[1:51:11] he can excite you if it's not thus
[1:51:13] sayith the Lord I don't want it it's not
[1:51:16] for me thank you very much I have thus
[1:51:19] say of the Lord I
[1:51:21] happy amen
[1:51:23] so we can see how dangerous it becomes
[1:51:25] the Lord doesn't say to the lying Spirit
[1:51:27] Get Out
[1:51:29] Satan he comes up and he says I'll
[1:51:32] go and look at the Lord he ask him how
[1:51:35] will you go doesn't this say go yeah the
[1:51:38] Lord is very very specific when he comes
[1:51:40] to Satan because he knows he's fly he
[1:51:44] knows he will give him the P this finger
[1:51:47] and he grabbed the whole hand how will
[1:51:49] you go he says I will anoint 400
[1:51:52] prophets to
[1:51:53] lie and the Lord says that's a good idea
[1:51:56] you will be successful
[1:51:58] go and he comes down he anoints 400
[1:52:01] prophets they all tell aab and them go
[1:52:03] you're going to prosper go you're going
[1:52:04] to win and here comes Micah the
[1:52:07] one and when he comes to that point
[1:52:10] telling them that high priest or the the
[1:52:12] main Prophet walks up to him hit him in
[1:52:14] the
[1:52:15] face where did the spirit of God go and
[1:52:17] it left me into you and there a big
[1:52:20] commotion and the King says look up the
[1:52:22] this man feed him the bread of misery
[1:52:24] till I come
[1:52:26] back he says if you come back God never
[1:52:28] spoke to me I see Israel scattered like
[1:52:31] sheep without a Shepherd because he knew
[1:52:34] like a prophet in our day which I met
[1:52:37] that said if I have this doesn't come to
[1:52:39] pass put a badge on my back I'm a false
[1:52:41] prophet and March me through the street
[1:52:44] that's how certain a prophet of God is
[1:52:46] because God spoke to him Hallelujah yes
[1:52:49] sir for a man to make that statement he
[1:52:51] must have heard Direct directly from God
[1:52:53] and that's how our Prophet could many
[1:52:54] times say this is going to happen and it
[1:52:56] happens exactly that
[1:52:58] way Hallelujah is that
[1:53:01] true so it happens they lock him up they
[1:53:04] go aab is killed and we know the history
[1:53:08] why he got killed because Elijah made a
[1:53:10] prophecy but we don't want to go there
[1:53:12] Zechariah 3 from verse
[1:53:18] one then the guiding Angel showed me
[1:53:21] Joshua the high priest
[1:53:24] in the Amplified I'm going to read from
[1:53:26] the Amplified as well Zechariah
[1:53:29] 3:1 then the guiding Angel showed me
[1:53:32] Joshua the high
[1:53:33] priest representing disobedient sinful
[1:53:36] Israel standing before the angel of the
[1:53:39] Lord and Satan standing at Joshua's
[1:53:40] right hand to be his adversary and to
[1:53:43] accuse
[1:53:44] him so Joshua the high priest standing
[1:53:48] with his Priestly garments and the devil
[1:53:50] there to accuse him the Lord said to
[1:53:53] Satan in verse two the Lord rebuke you
[1:53:55] Satan even the Lord who now and ever has
[1:53:58] chosen Jerusalem rebuke you is this not
[1:54:00] a lock snatch and rescued from the
[1:54:02] fire now Joshua was clothed with ffy
[1:54:05] nauseating vile garments and was
[1:54:08] standing before the angel of the
[1:54:11] Lord and the Lord spoke to those who
[1:54:13] stood before him saying remove the
[1:54:14] filthy garment from him and he said to
[1:54:16] Joshua see I've caused your wickedness
[1:54:19] to be taken away from you and I will
[1:54:20] clothe you and beautify you with Rich
[1:54:22] Robes of
[1:54:24] forgiveness so it's a type of Our Lives
[1:54:28] the visitation of God the word of God is
[1:54:30] always there to show us the grace of God
[1:54:33] you are only here by the grace of God
[1:54:35] you are saved by the grace of God now
[1:54:38] Joshua stood there with his
[1:54:41] finest your finest behavior is filthy
[1:54:44] rags before
[1:54:46] God that's right your best
[1:54:49] behavior that's what he's saying here
[1:54:51] yeah Joshua the high priest standing
[1:54:55] with his Priestly garments in front of
[1:54:57] God it looked it stank it was dirty it
[1:54:59] was ffy that God said to the angel take
[1:55:02] off the
[1:55:04] garments now I want you to notice he
[1:55:07] didn't say to Joshua out of my presence
[1:55:10] go and fix yourself up and then you come
[1:55:12] back your your unworthy yeah no he knows
[1:55:16] when you come to him you need his grace
[1:55:19] you cannot dress yourself you cannot
[1:55:21] clean your you cannot save yourself you
[1:55:24] can do nothing for
[1:55:26] yourself he said to the angel strip him
[1:55:30] that's right and dress him with my
[1:55:34] robes so that's where we
[1:55:36] are so we compare ourselves with others
[1:55:39] to make ourselves feel
[1:55:40] better so that's why we don't compare to
[1:55:43] one another cuz if if if I can find
[1:55:46] somebody in church that's a little bit
[1:55:47] lower than me then I feel more righteous
[1:55:51] we've got a a man-made righteousness
[1:55:53] that comes into the message ranks that
[1:55:56] people look at themselves say I'm not as
[1:55:58] bad as that one or our church is not as
[1:56:00] bad as that
[1:56:02] church you know it's it creeps and easy
[1:56:06] that's right but you must leave that
[1:56:08] alone to say Lord God this church is
[1:56:11] here by God's grace I am here by your
[1:56:14] grace I have got no righteousness of my
[1:56:17] own Lord I don't want to hang on to my
[1:56:18] righteousness Lord leave it oh God I
[1:56:20] need your grace
[1:56:22] I'm just thankful to have a church to
[1:56:24] Fellowship I'm thankful for my brothers
[1:56:26] and sisters Lord I'm not going to
[1:56:27] compare to them because if a person that
[1:56:29] compares he's got problems in his life a
[1:56:33] secret sinner loves to
[1:56:34] compare because he looks at it and say
[1:56:37] Lord at least like a Pharisee I'm not as
[1:56:39] that
[1:56:40] one I've got problems Lord but at
[1:56:43] least that brother you know he steals
[1:56:45] money and he smokes I only steal
[1:56:48] money so Lord at least
[1:56:51] [Laughter]
[1:56:54] but we compare yeah you know I pray 5
[1:56:57] hours he prays one
[1:56:59] minute we
[1:57:01] compare to make us feel
[1:57:03] righteous you must realize this morning
[1:57:05] that you have got no righteousness of
[1:57:07] yourself every righteous every righteous
[1:57:10] fiber you've got comes from God he has
[1:57:13] made me righteous I have tried many
[1:57:15] years I've given up and he is doing the
[1:57:17] work and I thank him for that amen so
[1:57:21] our most righteous Deeds is still FY
[1:57:23] rags in his
[1:57:24] sight because we want to be good enough
[1:57:27] in God's
[1:57:28] eyes you know when I come that day in
[1:57:31] front of God I need to be good enough
[1:57:34] you will never be good enough for God am
[1:57:38] if he doesn't see the blood you're in
[1:57:40] trouble you will never never be good
[1:57:43] enough for God that's right you must
[1:57:45] look to what he has done for you to say
[1:57:46] I'm good enough for God by the grace and
[1:57:48] the blood that protects me he doesn't
[1:57:50] even see me he only hears my voice
[1:57:53] you can never be you know it's like what
[1:57:55] we do when you make a
[1:57:57] mistake you want to correct it with
[1:57:59] something good let's say I stole money
[1:58:03] this
[1:58:04] week the till was open I walked into
[1:58:06] Hallmark there and the till was open I
[1:58:08] took
[1:58:10] $1,000 and I walked out and the Holy
[1:58:12] Ghost convicts me and I said okay I'm
[1:58:13] going to give 2,000 to the
[1:58:16] poor so I'm
[1:58:18] okay that's how we work as humans we try
[1:58:21] and balance our wrong Deeds with good
[1:58:24] deeds so if I Wrong somebody I'll be
[1:58:26] kind to somebody else and I feel okay
[1:58:27] I've I've balanced the scales I've
[1:58:30] wronged one person I'll be good to
[1:58:32] two I've stolen a th000 I give 2,000
[1:58:35] back you feel the scales has been
[1:58:37] balanced I've wronged my wife now I
[1:58:39] bring a little Bush of
[1:58:41] flowers you know I slammed the door I
[1:58:43] went to work I come back tonight I feel
[1:58:45] sorry I bring flowers I say honey here
[1:58:47] has flowers for you I love you that
[1:58:50] doesn't balance the scales
[1:58:53] only thing that balance the scales is on
[1:58:54] your knees to say Lord forgive
[1:58:57] me no money you're going to pay back no
[1:58:59] nothing is going to balance the scales
[1:59:01] the only thing that balance the scales
[1:59:02] is say Lord I Repent wash me with your
[1:59:05] blood let your righteousness be mind I'm
[1:59:08] sorry
[1:59:09] Lord No Good Deed can ever cancel a bad
[1:59:14] deed so we have to have the right
[1:59:16] mindset to know that when the Lord visit
[1:59:18] us with his word he puts us in the right
[1:59:19] frame of mind for an opportunity to say
[1:59:22] Lord forgive me I have wronged Lord
[1:59:24] forgive me Father wash me with your
[1:59:26] blood because Lord I am dependent upon
[1:59:30] your grace and dependent on what you do
[1:59:33] now remember Joshua never argued with
[1:59:35] the Lord says but Lord I've I've been
[1:59:38] high preach for for so many years Lord
[1:59:40] I've tried my best Lord he just kept
[1:59:42] quiet because in the presence of God you
[1:59:44] know I'm in trouble I can just stand
[1:59:47] there and depend upon his grace and his
[1:59:49] grace was extended to Joshua not by
[1:59:52] Joshua himself but by an Angel standing
[1:59:54] there and that's why I thank God for the
[1:59:56] grace that is extended To Us by an Angel
[1:59:59] from Revelations 107 and I saw another
[2:00:01] Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud coming
[2:00:03] down God coming down and he is dressing
[2:00:07] us with his word that's right that's the
[2:00:09] grace of the Lord if it wasn't for that
[2:00:12] we would be in deep trouble that's right
[2:00:14] we have to understand that now the
[2:00:15] prophet says in the Easter seal he
[2:00:19] says I don't have any righteousness
[2:00:22] that's right that's your
[2:00:24] Prophet Malachi 4 that's right spoken
[2:00:28] word dead back to
[2:00:30] life all those things he says I don't
[2:00:33] have any
[2:00:35] righteousness not in my
[2:00:37] own I don't have any mine is fthy dirty
[2:00:41] rags that's right amen I hate to try to
[2:00:45] go to heaven on my preaching yeah amen
[2:00:48] you are not going to heaven because you
[2:00:50] come to church amen I'm not going to
[2:00:52] heaven because I stand behind the
[2:00:54] pulpit I'm not going to heaven that's
[2:00:56] not what he says I'm not going to heaven
[2:00:58] because I'm preaching he says and I'll
[2:01:01] hate to try to go to heaven on my
[2:01:02] preaching that's right because if I said
[2:01:05] one word wrong it is
[2:01:09] wrong I'd hate to try to go to heaven to
[2:01:12] on my
[2:01:14] Visions I'm going to heaven because I
[2:01:16] hold to his grace in my
[2:01:18] heart you only going to heaven because
[2:01:21] he has given given you grace and grace
[2:01:24] in abundance his grace that's why I'm
[2:01:27] going that's how we go by his grace and
[2:01:30] by his grace alone and that's what we
[2:01:33] want to believe now let's go back to
[2:01:37] Joshua the high
[2:01:38] priest uh Zechariah 3 verse 7 and we
[2:01:43] close with this Zechariah 3 ver7 now
[2:01:47] he's dressed Joshua he's taken off the
[2:01:49] FY garments he's given improper garments
[2:01:51] he's own right is gone he knows I'm I'm
[2:01:53] I'm a sinner to begin
[2:01:56] with and now he comes at the end he says
[2:01:59] thus sayth the Lord of host if you will
[2:02:02] walk in my ways that is remain faithful
[2:02:06] and perform my service then you will
[2:02:08] also govern my house and have a charge
[2:02:10] of my court and I will give you free
[2:02:13] access to my presence among these who
[2:02:15] are standing
[2:02:17] here that's the Amplified version which
[2:02:20] just gives us the context
[2:02:22] to say if you follow this word I'll give
[2:02:26] you free access to what to my
[2:02:31] presence to my throne
[2:02:34] room just like the devil can walk in any
[2:02:37] time you can also walk in
[2:02:40] anytime if he can do it how much more a
[2:02:42] son and daughter of God representing the
[2:02:45] blood come you think God is going to
[2:02:47] refuse you you think God is going to
[2:02:48] kick you out he can never refuse you
[2:02:51] when you come like this and he has
[2:02:52] dressed you in his righteousness when
[2:02:54] you come there he'll say come my child
[2:02:56] what can I do for you even the half of
[2:02:58] my kingdom that's
[2:03:00] right like an Esther after she became
[2:03:04] Queen the king is busy he doesn't see a
[2:03:07] evil man come on the scene he accuses
[2:03:09] her people of being evil and the decrees
[2:03:11] made that they must all die on a certain
[2:03:13] date and the word comes back to her to
[2:03:16] say you better now intercede for us she
[2:03:17] says I can't go because if I go unold
[2:03:20] I'm dead
[2:03:22] and they say if you don't go you're
[2:03:23] going to die
[2:03:25] anyway she says okay 3 days fasting I'm
[2:03:27] going to go and as she enter that throne
[2:03:30] room and the the doors open and the King
[2:03:33] sees her and her name is announced
[2:03:35] people were frozen because they know
[2:03:37] there's a
[2:03:38] law that says if you're not called and
[2:03:41] you enter that room you are
[2:03:43] dead but when the king sees her he sees
[2:03:46] himself no man wants to kill himself he
[2:03:49] sees the love of his life and he points
[2:03:51] the gold and
[2:03:52] he says oh Esther what can I do for you
[2:03:54] even the half of my
[2:03:57] kingdom but she was not interested in
[2:03:59] the half of his
[2:04:00] kingdom I'm not interested in half of
[2:04:02] God's kingdom if I've got God if I've
[2:04:05] got Jesus I've got everything Hallelujah
[2:04:07] she knew she said no oh great king if it
[2:04:11] pleases you if I found favor just come
[2:04:13] and dine with me
[2:04:14] tonight just come and talk to me she had
[2:04:18] wisdom a type of the Bride just come
[2:04:21] Lord I Want To Worship you I want to
[2:04:22] talk to you and that's how the thing
[2:04:24] unfolds and it's the same with the bride
[2:04:26] so you have got an access to God's
[2:04:28] Throne an access to his table that he
[2:04:32] has opened up for you by his grace that
[2:04:35] can never be taken from you now what
[2:04:38] does the devil
[2:04:40] do he keeps you
[2:04:43] hostage with your
[2:04:46] past as soon as you start to to to feel
[2:04:49] the freedom and the liberty of worship
[2:04:51] and want to do something for the Lord he
[2:04:53] puts a gun against your head and says
[2:04:55] remember what you've
[2:04:57] done how do you how do you think you can
[2:05:01] do now these things who gave you the
[2:05:04] right you know you cannot do
[2:05:08] that remember all the evil things you've
[2:05:10] done when you in the world remember all
[2:05:13] he he keeps you hostage and he keeps you
[2:05:16] back he hinders you and he's trying to
[2:05:18] destroy your your relationship and
[2:05:20] worship and fellowship with God in such
[2:05:23] a way that he will do anything to remind
[2:05:26] you even what you've done this last week
[2:05:27] anything he will to hinder you he keeps
[2:05:29] you a
[2:05:31] hostage but I want to tell you this
[2:05:33] morning that you are no longer a
[2:05:35] hostage the devil has got no right to
[2:05:38] remind you of your past because God says
[2:05:41] when you repent it is Forgiven it is in
[2:05:43] the sea of God's forgetfulness and God
[2:05:46] himself don't remember it that's how I
[2:05:49] want to look at my life to say Lord I've
[2:05:51] repented I don't know the Satan can
[2:05:54] never forget it but I'm not going to let
[2:05:56] him dictate to me I cannot worship you I
[2:05:59] cannot do things for you because of my
[2:06:01] past my past is in the
[2:06:03] past the past can never help you the
[2:06:07] past you can never relive that life you
[2:06:09] can never go back and fix
[2:06:11] it I mean how many of us would love to
[2:06:14] go back and change certain things
[2:06:16] certain decisions you've made certain
[2:06:19] things you you know man I was so foolish
[2:06:21] I wish I can reverse time and I'll do it
[2:06:24] different but there's nothing like that
[2:06:27] what's done is done but I thank the Lord
[2:06:30] Jesus Christ I thank the Lord for his
[2:06:32] capability that when I say Lord I am
[2:06:35] sorry I have asked forgiveness it is
[2:06:38] wiped out of the mind of God that even
[2:06:40] if Satan stands there next to me and
[2:06:43] accuses me day after day the Lord turned
[2:06:46] to him that's the first time the Lord
[2:06:48] turned to him when he accused Joshua the
[2:06:50] first time the Lord said to Satan I
[2:06:52] rebuke you that's when Satan accused the
[2:06:56] bride the Lord says I rebuke you Satan
[2:06:59] she's virtuous she's sinless she is the
[2:07:02] white wife my wife she is dressed by the
[2:07:05] word she has got nothing that hinders
[2:07:08] her Hallelujah so even God himself now
[2:07:11] start to speak for the bride Amen to say
[2:07:15] to say didn't stop it I had enough amen
[2:07:17] I had enough of your stories I had
[2:07:19] enough of your lies this woman woman is
[2:07:21] pure this woman is washed in the blood
[2:07:25] this woman is dressed by my
[2:07:26] righteousness she stands in her position
[2:07:29] she knows where she come from she knows
[2:07:31] where she's going she's not resting on
[2:07:33] her own
[2:07:34] ability you cannot work yourself into
[2:07:38] heaven
[2:07:39] Never No Good Deed will put you in
[2:07:42] heaven no amount of preaching will put
[2:07:44] you into heaven no amount of coming to
[2:07:47] church will put you into heaven but
[2:07:49] accepting Jesus Christ your savior your
[2:07:52] God your guide the word being manifested
[2:07:56] and you in tune with that channel to
[2:07:58] know that I have
[2:08:00] received and being born again a new
[2:08:04] creation what You' have done is gone
[2:08:08] even what your father has done is gone
[2:08:10] what your grandfather has done is gone
[2:08:13] it's all cut off by the blood and you
[2:08:15] stand there
[2:08:17] virtuous sinless that's why the Lord
[2:08:19] could tend to Satan say I rebuke you s
[2:08:22] keep your mouth shut I'm busy dealing
[2:08:25] with this bride I'm dressing her in my
[2:08:29] righteousness she has not said
[2:08:31] once that she's righteous she has not
[2:08:35] said once she deserve anything she has
[2:08:37] not claimed anything once she just stood
[2:08:41] there in absolute silence looking to him
[2:08:45] for
[2:08:46] Grace can you imagine just looking me in
[2:08:48] the eye say Lord I'm here not not even
[2:08:51] speak speaking and the Lord
[2:08:53] speaks says Angel
[2:08:57] messenger take off those filthy
[2:09:01] garments and then he says put on
[2:09:04] righteous
[2:09:05] garments while Satan is he says I rebuke
[2:09:08] you Satan and Satan kept quiet from
[2:09:11] there on that's right and the Lord at
[2:09:13] the end comes and he says now you have
[2:09:16] an open access to my table Hallelujah
[2:09:19] whenever you have a need of me just walk
[2:09:21] in amen when you come Sunday to church
[2:09:24] just pull into a Heavenly places just
[2:09:26] reach and Touch the Hem of my garment
[2:09:28] and I promise you you've got a legal
[2:09:30] ticket to pull from God anything you
[2:09:32] need any desire you can present to him
[2:09:35] to say Lord I need you oh God hallelujah
[2:09:39] and it's an open
[2:09:41] ticket that can never never expire that
[2:09:44] can never never be taken from
[2:09:46] you not your righteousness you have none
[2:09:50] not your ability you have none but what
[2:09:53] he has done for us his grace his love
[2:09:56] his kindness his goodness his Mercy that
[2:09:59] we can stand that's why I could never
[2:10:01] understand how the prophet could say
[2:10:03] even if he sends me to hell i'll worship
[2:10:07] Him in
[2:10:08] hell it's a man that
[2:10:11] understood that I'm not serving God to
[2:10:13] go to heaven I'm serving God because I
[2:10:16] love
[2:10:17] him I'm not serving him to give me a
[2:10:19] good job I'm serving him because I love
[2:10:22] him amen I'm not serving him to to heal
[2:10:24] my body I know he can do it but I'm
[2:10:27] serving him because I love him amen
[2:10:29] that's the first basis and that's always
[2:10:31] been the basis and it must every
[2:10:32] believer's basis be I love him and I
[2:10:35] serve him because I love him and I love
[2:10:38] him because he first loved me when I was
[2:10:41] unlovable in the world when I was dirty
[2:10:44] FY he loved me when nobody saw any good
[2:10:47] in me he loved me am when there was
[2:10:49] something you know it's it's so it's so
[2:10:52] profound that when you come in from the
[2:10:55] world some of us are born in the message
[2:10:56] is different you know you grow up in the
[2:10:58] message and you're born in the message
[2:11:00] and and and and and God Saves You by
[2:11:02] grace and you carry on you serve him but
[2:11:04] if you come from the world it's a
[2:11:05] different perspective even if you're
[2:11:08] born in the message you must be born
[2:11:09] again yes sir that's it's no guarantee
[2:11:12] that because your father and mother is
[2:11:13] believer that you will become a Believer
[2:11:15] it's the grace of God extended to you as
[2:11:17] an individual amen everyone must have
[2:11:20] his day at
[2:11:23] and I remember when me and sister IL got
[2:11:26] saved the first day we walked into a
[2:11:28] message church it was
[2:11:32] profound it was it was so so
[2:11:36] huge we sat at the back we looked at the
[2:11:38] people the sisters looked like
[2:11:40] Angels you thought is it
[2:11:43] possible we will never fit in here we
[2:11:46] can never be like this people they they
[2:11:49] are changed they are different kind of
[2:11:51] people people you know you come with the
[2:11:53] marks of the world your your your hair
[2:11:54] is short you you you you just you come
[2:11:57] with all those things but guess what a
[2:11:59] few months
[2:12:00] later we looked exactly like they look
[2:12:03] because that same spirit of God started
[2:12:06] to wash you and clean you and now when
[2:12:08] you tell somebody where you come from
[2:12:10] they say are you lying you never that's
[2:12:14] the power of God that's why when we look
[2:12:16] at one another all I see is Grace that's
[2:12:19] why I don't care the color of your skin
[2:12:20] I don't care where you come from when I
[2:12:22] see the blood when I see the Holy Ghost
[2:12:25] I am happy to fellowship with you and to
[2:12:28] raise my hands with you to say Lord the
[2:12:30] pillar of fire is
[2:12:32] here because your people is here and
[2:12:35] they represent it so it's the grace of
[2:12:39] God that we can live this life never
[2:12:42] lift yourself up but become humble never
[2:12:45] think it's your own ability but trust
[2:12:46] God because the moment you lift yourself
[2:12:48] up you're going to
[2:12:50] fall just trust the Lord be humble be
[2:12:54] saturated with his love and just look up
[2:12:56] to him and say Lord let your love be
[2:12:59] effective in my life I know I've
[2:13:01] disappointed you so but Lord I found
[2:13:04] Grace some of us are saved at the young
[2:13:06] age some of us are older but God's
[2:13:08] timing is perfect God's timing is
[2:13:11] absolutely perfect at the right and and
[2:13:14] for for most of us the timing in our own
[2:13:16] mind was wrong but God's timing is never
[2:13:18] wrong when God saved me it was the wrong
[2:13:20] time
[2:13:21] for me but the right time for God and I
[2:13:25] thank him for that trust him believe him
