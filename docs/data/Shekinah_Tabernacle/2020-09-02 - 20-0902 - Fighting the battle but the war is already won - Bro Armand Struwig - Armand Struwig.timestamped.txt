[20:33] and everywhere i look i
[20:37] see no rain
[20:42] it's the sound i hear in the stillness
[20:46] when the answers just won't come
[20:50] and darkness closes in
[20:53] and comes around
[20:57] i hear the sound of deliverance
[21:03] when i bow down my head lift up

[23:18] amen amen
[23:26] deliverance will always come when i need
[23:30] jesus
[23:32] thank you brother isaac thank you joshua
[23:34] thank you brother phil
[23:37] we all can stand so we can just open up
[23:40] tonight in a word of prayer
[23:41] just open up the scriptures as well and
[23:44] invite jesus
[23:45] in he's the one that delivers so it's
[23:48] worthwhile inviting him into the meeting
[23:52] nothing that man can do can deliver
[23:55] himself
[23:57] amen amen so we're going to go to the
[24:00] book of hebrews
[24:02] and we're going to read chapter 4
[24:05] and we're going to read there from verse
[24:07] 11.
[24:09] amen um so this thought has been just
[24:13] give a bit of background on it this
[24:14] thought has been coming a while and
[24:17] and every time i get a little bit of a
[24:19] thought and brother ben asked if i would
[24:20] share a thought everybody else seems to
[24:22] preach what i was thinking you know
[24:24] and i got a bit disheartened at a stage
[24:26] because i thought man
[24:28] i just want to deliver what the god
[24:29] gives me you know and when it bubbles it
[24:31] must
[24:32] bubble out you know because it just must
[24:33] come out so i'm just going to preach it
[24:35] anyway so
[24:36] so brother ben and brother um james
[24:39] you've you've already done all the work
[24:41] i'm just going to
[24:41] do it from another angle so it's all
[24:43] been said it's just
[24:45] maybe my words you know so um but
[24:48] my words fell but let god's word always
[24:50] be the truth they
[24:51] amen so we start there at verse 11
[24:54] and um we can maybe start that verse 11
[24:58] and it says here
[25:00] let us labor therefore to enter into
[25:03] that rest
[25:04] least any mean man fall after the same
[25:07] example of unbelief
[25:09] now the thing we want to address tonight
[25:11] that the title of the sermon is finding
[25:13] fighting the battle
[25:15] but winning the war the war's already
[25:17] won okay so just keep in mind if the
[25:20] whole thought goes about there's a
[25:21] battle
[25:22] and it and we have to fight some battles
[25:24] but the war is already won
[25:26] okay so just keep that thought and and
[25:28] hopefully it will all come out all right
[25:30] so verse 12 says for the word of god is
[25:33] quick
[25:34] and powerful and sharper than any to
[25:36] each sword
[25:37] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[25:40] the soul
[25:41] and spirit of the joints and the marrow
[25:44] goes very very deep and very sensitive
[25:47] when it cuts
[25:49] and it is a discerner and this is where
[25:51] i want to base my most of my thought on
[25:53] of the thoughts
[25:55] and intent of the heart amen so let us
[25:58] just pray
[25:59] our gracious heavenly father lord i can
[26:02] i can read this bible and i can open the
[26:04] pages of it lord but only you can open
[26:06] your word father
[26:08] you have done it already through a
[26:09] prophet lord and you
[26:11] all we come is just to come and say lord
[26:13] we need more
[26:15] we always need more lord you're not just
[26:17] a god that stands still
[26:18] but you're a god that keeps on moving in
[26:20] our hearts moving upon our hearts lord
[26:22] and you always teach us something new
[26:24] lord jesus to help us to further the
[26:26] kingdom of god so we just come tonight
[26:28] lord and ask help us
[26:30] lord may you just come down tonight and
[26:32] you speak to us may it not be man's word
[26:34] because man's will will fail lord may be
[26:37] your word and a word in season may
[26:39] help us with our daily struggles lord
[26:40] may it help us to overcome
[26:42] might help us just get us closer to you
[26:44] lord because that's the reason why we
[26:46] preach this gospel
[26:47] lord is not because we think we have it
[26:49] all because we know we need it all lord
[26:51] jesus and we just come to you and say
[26:53] lord we need you more
[26:55] and i need you more as well lord and may
[26:57] if there's any distractions or anything
[26:58] there lord i please pray
[27:00] may you intercede tonight lord may this
[27:03] fault anchor into our hearts lord jesus
[27:05] and lord help us lord as we walk in this
[27:08] walk lord we know
[27:09] that we cannot do it on our own we need
[27:11] that captain lord jesus so tonight lord
[27:14] would you just step in the gap
[27:15] would you just fold this place up with
[27:17] your presence father
[27:19] and lord may we all just get a blessing
[27:21] and it can help us in our fight
[27:23] fighting this enemy lord i pray this in
[27:26] the wonderful name of our lord jesus
[27:27] christ anyone that's not your lord
[27:30] be with them father be with them as what
[27:32] you are with us now
[27:34] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[27:37] amen you can take your seats
[27:42] amen i'm going to try to take it just a
[27:44] little bit slow
[27:47] but i'm gonna eat the highlight and
[27:49] hopefully we will finish
[27:51] within time so we can go into a prayer
[27:53] meeting so when we
[27:54] when we read the verse 12 and it says in
[27:58] verse 12 that it's a discerner of the
[28:00] thoughts and the tense
[28:02] of the heart so no i've i've been
[28:05] listening to the greatest battle ever
[28:06] fought
[28:07] and if you ever want to go listen to a
[28:09] sermon that would get you on your feet
[28:11] again punching the devil back that's
[28:13] that sermon
[28:13] that's right okay it's that sermon
[28:16] because there's a line in the sand
[28:18] and that's basically where a christian
[28:19] can go i stand here and there's no
[28:22] further
[28:23] amen okay devil you cannot come past
[28:25] here because there is a place where you
[28:26] need to draw that line and say
[28:28] you ain't going to go past this anymore
[28:30] i'm not going to be beaten
[28:31] i'm not going to be trolling upon i'm
[28:33] not going to be said what i need to do
[28:35] i'm going to draw the sand now this my
[28:37] line is now drawn
[28:39] so what i want to do is i want to give
[28:40] glory to god and i want to give the
[28:42] glory in such a way to say that there's
[28:44] been a message
[28:45] and this message works okay
[28:48] it works and if you're feeling you're
[28:51] struggling and the battles are real and
[28:52] you're feeling like
[28:53] you're getting beaten down just go back
[28:56] take your bible
[28:58] read okay listen to the message
[29:01] get on your knees pray and god will show
[29:04] you that
[29:05] you actually haven't lost the war you
[29:07] just lost a battle
[29:10] because you will lose battles let us be
[29:12] honest you're never going to win you're
[29:14] never going to get to a fight if you
[29:15] look at a war
[29:16] you're never going to win every battle
[29:18] you win a bit here you lose a bit yeah
[29:20] you win a big year you get
[29:22] reinforcements you both push on you win
[29:23] here there's always
[29:25] things happening around but so you might
[29:27] lose this one
[29:28] you might get it wrong but the war is
[29:31] not over
[29:32] okay so let's fight each battle as it
[29:34] comes and that that came from
[29:37] from um brother james god bless you
[29:39] brother james
[29:40] he says here in 1962 he sees in the
[29:42] greatest battle ever fought and all my
[29:44] notes is from that because
[29:46] i thought i'll just stay with what god
[29:47] showed me he says now do you know
[29:50] we have wars and rumors of wars if this
[29:54] earth stands we'll have plenty more wars
[29:57] but do you realize there's only two
[29:59] powers in all the universe
[30:02] of all our differences between nations
[30:04] so all our different
[30:05] differences between each other and
[30:07] everything else
[30:08] mounts up to only two powers only two
[30:12] powers there's only two kingdoms
[30:14] two powers two kingdoms all the rest is
[30:18] little minor things
[30:19] they are all connected either the one
[30:22] power
[30:22] or the other and those power is god's
[30:26] power
[30:26] and satan's power he goes on to say this
[30:30] says
[30:30] and every war every disorder everything
[30:33] that comes along it is either either
[30:35] controlled by god's power or satan's
[30:38] power
[30:38] because that's the only two powers there
[30:41] is
[30:42] and that's the only power and then he
[30:44] goes on to make a statement and he says
[30:47] and this is the power of life
[30:50] and the power of death so that means
[30:54] when we
[30:54] we going up against our enemy every time
[30:57] we go up against him it's actually a
[30:59] fight for life and death
[31:01] it's not just faith and doubt and and
[31:03] belief and unbelief it's
[31:05] life and death and it's not to say that
[31:08] that because i'm saved i've got my
[31:10] salvation my helmet of salvation is on i
[31:12] know i'm saved i know where i'm going
[31:13] the lord has changed me he's working in
[31:15] me
[31:15] that doesn't mean all of a sudden i'm
[31:17] just going to go by the wayside and fall
[31:18] off and die
[31:20] that just means life is in the tongue so
[31:23] what we speak what we confess what we
[31:25] say can bring life or it can be death
[31:28] so you can be in the very same situation
[31:30] and you can speak life into that
[31:32] situation and turn the battle or you can
[31:34] speak negativity into the situation and
[31:36] turn the battle
[31:37] but it's still life and death because
[31:39] the choice you make still has two
[31:40] outcomes it's either going to glorify
[31:42] satan
[31:43] or it's going to glorify god but which
[31:45] one do we choose
[31:46] and see this is where the battlefield
[31:48] lies now the battlefield don't lie
[31:50] anymore
[31:51] in heaven with the angels where michael
[31:53] kicked satan out and threw him all on
[31:55] the ground and now the battles here on
[31:56] earth no no it
[31:58] changed i'm not going to jump ahead but
[31:59] the tactics changed
[32:01] and there's a battlefield which god and
[32:03] satan both agreed
[32:05] and it's called the middle ground and
[32:07] and brother isaac touched it on on one
[32:09] day in one of his songs and it and it's
[32:10] stuck and i'm going to read it
[32:12] but i don't want to get ahead i just
[32:14] need to go a little bit back
[32:16] so these two powers fighting and those
[32:18] powers actually is fighting for you
[32:23] and for me you know so when we walk into
[32:26] this door
[32:28] satan didn't stay at the door he didn't
[32:30] decide i'm going to stay at the door and
[32:32] i'm going to leave the christians to
[32:33] come and sit and have a very
[32:34] nice time nah nah nah he sat here
[32:37] waiting for you
[32:38] because every distraction he can give
[32:40] you he's going to give you every reason
[32:42] that you want
[32:42] he's going to give you it's it's two
[32:45] battles can you take it or can you leave
[32:47] it can you discern it
[32:49] and can you cast it away that that's the
[32:51] battle that's the very real battle we
[32:54] face
[32:56] so he says the greatest battle ever
[32:58] fought is going on right now
[33:00] yes sir it's between life and death it's
[33:03] between sickness and health
[33:04] it's between faith and doubt it's
[33:06] between liberty and bondage
[33:08] the battle is on shine your spear
[33:11] soldiers
[33:12] polish your armor and get ready for god
[33:15] is getting ready
[33:16] soldiers amen god anoints his army
[33:19] okay so he's now he's now taking the
[33:21] battle and he's actually pointing it to
[33:23] who's directing the battle
[33:25] so we're the foot soldiers we're on the
[33:27] plane we're fighting but he's now
[33:28] turning your view and saying listen this
[33:30] is not you
[33:31] there's someone in charge so we'll
[33:34] follow that thought
[33:36] so here was one
[33:39] where he says god dresses his army
[33:41] hallelujah
[33:42] what kind of equipment do we use we use
[33:46] the spirit of the sword
[33:47] the word of god amen the word of god is
[33:50] sharper than a two-edged sword
[33:51] hebrews 4 piercing even and to the
[33:54] ascender
[33:55] the bone and even the marrow of the bone
[33:58] even a discerner of the thoughts of the
[34:01] mind
[34:02] the word of god to believe his word
[34:05] and that is the way god armors but now
[34:08] he speaks about eve and what happened in
[34:10] the
[34:10] in the in genesis 3 and he says
[34:15] that's what he gave eve to arm herself
[34:17] with was the word of god because he said
[34:19] you shall not eat from that fruit
[34:22] he says and she broke down her armor
[34:25] how did she do it by opening up a mind
[34:28] to reason
[34:29] you don't reason with god's word
[34:33] that's right amen i just need to do
[34:34] something or else i'm going to really
[34:36] lose the track of my thought please
[34:38] excuse me
[34:39] i had little footnotes and they trigger
[34:41] thoughts
[34:42] amen
[34:46] there we go praise the lord
[34:50] so now he says if we look at if we go to
[34:54] to genesis chapter three
[34:57] and we just read there and i'll just
[34:59] read this verse one two three and he
[35:00] says
[35:02] now the serpent was the most subtle than
[35:05] any beast of the field
[35:07] which the lord had made and he said unto
[35:09] the woman yea
[35:10] hath god said see he came with the word
[35:13] and we all know this we've listened to
[35:14] the message so many times but just catch
[35:16] this
[35:17] just catch this he says ye shall not eat
[35:20] of
[35:20] every tree of the garden so he's asking
[35:23] her is that not what god said
[35:25] so he comes with the word of god he's
[35:26] going to help her now
[35:28] and he says and the woman said unto the
[35:30] serpent we may eat
[35:32] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[35:34] but of the fruit
[35:36] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[35:37] god and god says
[35:39] you shall not eat neither shall ye touch
[35:41] it least ye
[35:42] die so she fortified her behind the word
[35:45] of god
[35:46] but see satan is not going to leave it
[35:48] there so he said okay
[35:50] i got you here and he says and the
[35:52] serpent said unto the woman
[35:54] ye shall not surely die
[35:58] it says because for god does know that
[36:01] the day you eat thereof your eyes shall
[36:03] open and you shall be as god's knowing
[36:05] good from evil so he's even telling the
[36:07] truth he's saying you'll know once you
[36:08] eat the fruit you'll know what's right
[36:10] and wrong
[36:10] okay but see now here i want to say the
[36:14] battle is between life
[36:16] and death and god said if you remove
[36:18] yourself from
[36:19] out my word you will die now he
[36:22] physically did not die the curse started
[36:25] that day but she didn't die god made a
[36:26] way for us
[36:27] the lamb sheep blood of the lamb so that
[36:30] we can have a chance to come back
[36:32] and worship him because that's where he
[36:33] made us to fellowship
[36:35] but eve she fell because she left
[36:38] that armor she left that word she
[36:41] started
[36:42] she started listening she started
[36:44] reasoning because
[36:45] with what's the difference between any
[36:48] any denomination
[36:49] and the message is the nominations is
[36:51] words of man let's say it as it is
[36:54] it's opinions it's doctrines it's and
[36:56] and
[36:57] and the doctrines and man's word makes
[36:59] the word of god to no effect
[37:01] because it has to come back to a source
[37:03] of truth
[37:04] and if you look at the message not once
[37:06] his brother branham ever pointed us to a
[37:08] doctrine
[37:09] he pointed us back to the word and he
[37:11] says yes
[37:12] fortify yourself behind the word
[37:16] and so now if we can do a bit more of a
[37:18] reading so we don't have the training
[37:20] because what happens is now okay we're
[37:22] going to go to ephesians 6 who knows
[37:24] ephesians 6
[37:25] the armor of god who knows that amen so
[37:28] i've got ephesians 6 and i'm going to
[37:30] read and i'm going to show you a couple
[37:31] of things in there
[37:32] so i'm just going to put on the armor of
[37:33] god and i'm going to defeat the
[37:35] the devil be careful because you still
[37:38] need training
[37:39] it's no point having a sword and
[37:41] wielding it left to front and hurting
[37:43] and killing as far as you go if you
[37:44] don't know how to use it
[37:46] so there's an element of training
[37:48] there's an element of surrender there's
[37:50] an element where you still have to show
[37:51] up to that battle
[37:53] and each battle is different so don't
[37:55] forget your training because
[37:56] if you don't pray if you don't read your
[37:58] bible if you don't spend time with god
[38:01] you're not training
[38:05] you know if you don't listen to the
[38:07] message if you don't sharpen that blade
[38:09] you're going to get sucker punched you
[38:11] need your training it's it's
[38:12] important it's your life that's right
[38:15] you know it's no point you say of all
[38:16] the armor and you go standing at the bed
[38:18] and you go oh
[38:19] what does this do again and how do i use
[38:21] this and oh i've got the truth i'm
[38:23] telling the truth am i is it really the
[38:25] truth and
[38:26] because i've got my goods lined with the
[38:27] truth you know i know it's the truth but
[38:29] but it really isn't the truth because
[38:30] you're not training you're feeding the
[38:31] black
[38:32] dog so that's the only thing that's
[38:34] going to happen is you're going to get
[38:35] bad technique you're not going to fight
[38:37] the
[38:37] the devil and he will come with a little
[38:39] bit of truth
[38:40] and then bend it and because you lost
[38:42] your training he sucker punch you
[38:44] and you're left with a question why
[38:46] would god do this and why is this
[38:48] happening and
[38:48] because i'm now i'm struggling it's now
[38:50] a very real bad and why would that
[38:51] brother say that to me why would he want
[38:53] to hurt me
[38:54] and now what he does is he starts
[38:56] working on your reasoning
[38:58] so now i'm going to bring the armor of
[38:59] god in because that armor is very
[39:01] important that shield of faith
[39:03] is so important it's just as important
[39:05] as this word
[39:06] it's just as important as the helmet of
[39:08] salvation knowing where you belong it's
[39:10] all important you can't throw any of
[39:12] your ammo away you can't throw your
[39:13] stuff away
[39:14] you can't leave your training you cannot
[39:16] leave your shield you cannot leave your
[39:18] sword you need it all for each battle
[39:21] each battle not the war each battle
[39:24] because the ones you lose is the ones
[39:26] when you get out of training
[39:28] it's when you slack yeah you know and
[39:30] you go like oh what did i do again with
[39:32] my
[39:32] with my sword you know and you go to mom
[39:35] and go hey mom did you see my bible
[39:37] it's sunday school today and i don't
[39:39] have my bible and and what am i
[39:41] to do mom did you see my bible and you
[39:42] walk into the sunday school class
[39:44] i can speak about this i've got
[39:45] first-hand experience i used to do it
[39:47] myself
[39:47] and you get there and the sunday school
[39:49] teacher goes where's your bible
[39:51] oh you know um yeah no
[39:54] my mom didn't bring my bible sorry so
[39:57] you're going to give your mom a sword
[39:59] right so when you go to bed you're going
[40:01] to leave your sword there at the moment
[40:02] say mom i'm going to go defend the
[40:03] country
[40:04] with
[40:08] nothing oh that's great so how's that
[40:11] battle gonna go for you because it's
[40:12] still a battle you're gonna lose that
[40:13] battle
[40:14] because your enemy he studies you
[40:17] he watches you he can't wait for you to
[40:19] slip up
[40:20] because he's keen he's in the battle
[40:22] because his
[40:23] life is at stake because the book says
[40:26] you're going to burn in the lake of fire
[40:28] and he goes
[40:28] i don't believe it because he's an
[40:30] unbeliever to begin with
[40:32] he's not a believer he's an unbeliever
[40:34] so even the very word that's
[40:36] attributed to him he doesn't believe it
[40:38] because he actually thinks he's going to
[40:40] win this thing
[40:41] but see he's showed up for the battle
[40:43] and when you walk through this store on
[40:45] a sunday
[40:46] he showed up for the battle he ain't
[40:48] going to scour away
[40:49] he ain't going to go oh here comes the
[40:50] sons and daughters of god oh i might
[40:52] just go here and say yeah
[40:53] sorry guys i don't want to bother you
[40:55] and please sit stolen
[40:57] and listen to ben because he knows it
[40:59] all and no no no no
[41:00] no he waited for you at that door he
[41:02] waited for you next to your seat
[41:04] and all he's going to do you is going to
[41:05] fire his dots and go oh you want to
[41:07] think about
[41:08] football and you want to think about
[41:10] music lessons oh
[41:11] that girl you like thee and ooh who's
[41:13] that boy and i said football jessie
[41:15] ain't no soccer
[41:16] and oh you want to throw that rugby ball
[41:18] in so he'll shoot you everything to keep
[41:21] your mind busy so that you miss what you
[41:23] need for the next battle
[41:25] you know he didn't come to play he come
[41:28] to destroy
[41:30] he says this as a roaring lion seeking
[41:32] them that he wants to destroy he doesn't
[41:34] come to say oh
[41:35] you know i just want to be your buddy
[41:36] and your friend and i really like you
[41:38] and you're a cool personality
[41:39] he wants to kill you that's it it's life
[41:43] or death and why you fight it's life
[41:46] and death it doesn't change never not
[41:49] one thought that you get into your head
[41:51] is life or death every time yeah
[41:54] so i'm gonna go to that sorry i get very
[41:55] passionate about this but this has been
[41:57] cooking so much i
[41:58] oh amen um so let's go to ephesians 6
[42:03] and this is where i want to touch
[42:05] because now he says we don't
[42:07] wrestle against flesh and blood our
[42:09] fight is not between brothers and
[42:11] sisters
[42:12] people out there unbelievers no
[42:14] believers make believers real believers
[42:16] fake believers whatever you want to it's
[42:19] not it's
[42:19] see this is not a human affair brother
[42:21] isaac preached it so well we're not part
[42:23] of this fight
[42:24] and if there's an unbeliever that walks
[42:26] past you and he kicks your bucket and
[42:28] says
[42:28] i don't believe in god you shouldn't get
[42:30] upset about it
[42:32] he's an unbeliever to begin with he he
[42:35] doesn't believe what ground do you have
[42:37] on to say
[42:38] you must believe in jesus christ and be
[42:39] saved or you're going to go to hell what
[42:41] ground do you have to stand on
[42:42] we know this but he's an unbeliever so
[42:45] for him
[42:45] even if you said that or gave him the
[42:47] whole bible to read if he doesn't
[42:49] believe it he doesn't believe it
[42:51] so don't try to change people pray for
[42:53] those people but
[42:54] but see the fight now because he's put
[42:56] forth the challenge
[42:57] god doesn't exist doesn't exist god is
[43:00] not real
[43:01] but what are you going to do are you
[43:02] going to go back to your training don't
[43:04] hit him with the sword
[43:05] just first get that shield up and say
[43:07] lord i'm not fighting a brother
[43:09] i'm not fighting a person i'm fighting a
[43:11] spirit
[43:12] amen it's a spiritual warfare it's got
[43:15] nothing to do with men and
[43:17] it's just a manifestation it's where it
[43:19] comes out it just manifests in near this
[43:21] realm
[43:21] but it's a spiritual warfare we were
[43:23] created in the image of god
[43:25] not in the image of man so let's go to
[43:28] ephesians 6
[43:30] amen and i need my phone for that one
[43:35] so ephesians 6 and we'll start there at
[43:36] verse 12 and it says
[43:38] for you wrestle not against flesh and
[43:40] blood or against principalities against
[43:42] powers against rulers of the darkness of
[43:45] this world
[43:46] against spiritual wickedness in high
[43:48] places now he says this is not your
[43:50] fight
[43:51] but let me just tell you what you need
[43:52] to do this fight take you there for the
[43:54] whole armor of god
[43:56] that you may be able to withstand the
[43:58] evil day and having done
[44:00] all to stand so basically show up to the
[44:03] battle yeah
[44:04] god say i'm losing a battle but but
[44:06] you're standing there and i'm going on
[44:08] i'm fine tonight i might not just go to
[44:10] church tonight and i just don't feel
[44:12] really nice
[44:13] satan don't want you here yeah you
[44:15] rather want you lying on your bed
[44:17] watching a story or reading your
[44:19] favorite book or taking a time out he
[44:21] doesn't want you here because he is
[44:22] where the war really happens
[44:24] here's where god gives you something
[44:25] that hits you here in your soul and you
[44:27] go
[44:27] that's that's a bit hard i don't know if
[44:29] i can eat that but because i'm a real
[44:31] christian
[44:32] i'll take it back to him say okay lord
[44:34] lord they said no brother months it not
[44:36] tonight i should bring my bible and
[44:38] i think he aimed it a bit against me and
[44:40] and you know why would he say that
[44:41] but take it back to him because if you
[44:43] take it back to him your answer is going
[44:45] to come
[44:45] but it will come because he's not a god
[44:47] of confusion
[44:49] he says the um to withstand the emotion
[44:52] having all done all to stand and here
[44:55] we go is he stand there for having your
[44:58] loins
[44:59] girted with the truth and having the
[45:02] brace braid of righteousness
[45:04] and here's where i made a little
[45:05] footnote he says and your feet
[45:07] shot with the preparation of the gospel
[45:11] of peace so preparation is to make one
[45:14] ready for a sermon is to make you ready
[45:18] to receive something you're preparing
[45:20] before you come here
[45:21] you don't stroll in the door here and
[45:23] come and sit down and just receive
[45:25] because then if you look at the the
[45:27] parable with jesus speak about the sower
[45:29] your the seat that is sowed it either
[45:31] falls in prepared ground
[45:33] or hard ground and the birds will eat it
[45:36] up
[45:37] so it's no point coming to church and
[45:39] you're not prepared to receive something
[45:40] brother isaac said something tonight
[45:42] he says i'm ready to receive something
[45:46] and it's not me because he comes with
[45:49] the expectation and he wants that
[45:51] expectation to be made
[45:53] so if you don't come prepared you will
[45:55] not receive anything because no pastor
[45:57] can preach you into heaven
[45:59] god can get you there if you want to
[46:01] really surrender it is a
[46:03] it's a take and give hey it's a it's a
[46:06] deal purpose it's a two
[46:07] two way it's not a one way okay we
[46:09] respond to god god responds back to us
[46:12] or god responds to us we respond back
[46:14] to him it's not god tells us what he's
[46:15] doing
[46:17] yes lord god bless you sister here we go
[46:20] i have to act this way
[46:21] god bless your sister you see it's not
[46:23] that way god doesn't make robots he's
[46:25] persons we're persons
[46:26] man with people with affections
[46:31] i'll get back on my thoughts sorry
[46:34] but remember the preparation because
[46:36] when you pray up
[46:38] and you come prepared and you really
[46:40] want to get your blessing
[46:41] no matter what comes over this pulpit
[46:43] you'll get your blessing
[46:44] you will not leave here until he blesses
[46:46] you
[46:48] he says and in fear and and your feet
[46:51] short with the preparation of the gospel
[46:52] of peace and above
[46:54] all things take the shield of faith
[46:57] where you shall withstand and be able to
[46:59] quench all
[47:02] all the fiery darts of the wicked amen
[47:05] not some all the fiery darts
[47:10] that means you don't need to take one
[47:12] thought the devil gives you
[47:13] that means you have a choice to take or
[47:16] to let go
[47:17] it lies with you so i'm going to come
[47:20] back i'll come back to that and then he
[47:22] says
[47:22] all the thoughts the the all the dots of
[47:25] the
[47:25] the wicked you can call them farts if
[47:27] you want to as well because there's
[47:29] nothing there
[47:29] he's just a bluff he's just it's just a
[47:32] thought
[47:32] you can take it you can do whatever you
[47:34] want it's just a thought he's already
[47:36] been defeated there's nothing of
[47:38] substance that can hurt you there no
[47:39] matter what he sees
[47:41] it's a thought don't see it for anything
[47:43] more than a thought that comes into your
[47:45] head
[47:46] he says and take the helmet of salvation
[47:49] and the sword of the spirit
[47:51] which is the word of god and in verse 18
[47:54] praying always and with all prayer and
[47:58] supplication in the spirit
[47:59] and watching there unto for all
[48:03] perseverance he says and that
[48:05] perseverance
[48:07] it says perseverance is doing something
[48:10] despite the difficulty
[48:12] or delay in achieving success
[48:15] resolve remember that we just spoke
[48:17] about it
[48:18] is when you say in your heart i will
[48:20] push this battle
[48:22] even if it costs my life not against
[48:25] someone but against one person
[48:27] wins one fallen angel which is created
[48:30] held on earth and is actually thinking
[48:32] he's going to achieve a victory he
[48:34] will not because he's already been
[48:35] defeated just put him in his place
[48:38] just put him in his place he is a
[48:39] defeated being that's that's how it is
[48:42] he says and this is where brother ben
[48:44] said something he says and for me
[48:47] that utterance may be given unto me and
[48:49] that i might open my mouth boldly to
[48:52] make known the mystery of the gospel
[48:53] the mystery of the gospel which is not a
[48:55] mystery anymore for which i
[48:57] am an ambassador in bonds brother ben
[49:02] we're ambassadors that means when god
[49:05] sent you to this earth
[49:06] he put all authority from heaven and
[49:08] earth behind you and you preached that
[49:10] and i thought
[49:11] wow how did you just get that from
[49:14] yeah i started that one i'm just saying
[49:17] because you represent the kingdom of
[49:19] heaven now how's satan gonna let you
[49:21] just stand yeah because you're his enemy
[49:24] because basically you said i'm gonna
[49:26] follow jesus that right yeah and he's
[49:28] gonna go oh yeah
[49:31] yeah you say say me
[49:34] okay but i'm going to show you because
[49:36] now when you didn't follow
[49:38] um who came out of the world brother
[49:40] james when you didn't fall
[49:42] follow jesus how easy was it
[49:46] it's easy life's easy man i can do what
[49:49] i want
[49:50] sister jenny we can do what we want we
[49:52] can we can we adults we can do whatever
[49:54] we want come on man i'll come out of the
[49:56] world i know
[49:57] it took a lot to get me a praise the
[49:59] lord but we're going
[50:00] but i could do anything and nothing was
[50:03] a limitation
[50:04] nothing nothing could stop me i was
[50:06] unstoppable i was
[50:08] i was just young and vibrant and i could
[50:10] do whatever i wanted to do
[50:12] but the day when i chose jesus christ
[50:15] three days later they broke into my
[50:16] house i'm like hey
[50:19] what's this luckily they stole my tv
[50:21] they stole my playstation
[50:23] they saw all the things that was
[50:25] distracting me from the gospel praise
[50:26] the lord
[50:29] they had to he had to because he had to
[50:31] clean everything out
[50:33] okay so praise the lord he's good
[50:36] but now i want to speak about the part
[50:38] of the sermon and and i'm almost i'm
[50:40] well i'm not about to close but we're
[50:41] going to try to close this one
[50:44] so you got the part of the sermon i said
[50:46] it in the sunday school meeting
[50:48] so we have a choice so here's our pot i
[50:50] don't have a pot i usually like props
[50:52] but okay you've got a part of the sermon
[50:53] so there's a big pot cooking
[50:55] one of brother andy's big curry pots
[50:57] okay
[50:59] so now the thought comes in momo doesn't
[51:02] like you
[51:03] he looks strangely at you sorry mom i'm
[51:06] like your dad i like using examples he's
[51:08] god bless you brother and now you think
[51:11] whoa
[51:13] you know maybe he doesn't like me stop
[51:15] right there
[51:17] why don't you just first catch that
[51:18] thought because the bible says you
[51:19] should take
[51:20] every thought into captivity every
[51:23] thought
[51:23] catch it and now before you put it in
[51:26] here
[51:27] just catch it and go let's put it in the
[51:30] pot
[51:31] and boil it a bit yeah don't entertain
[51:33] it boil it
[51:34] okay because satan is going to boil it's
[51:36] going to burn in like a fire so boiler
[51:37] boil it and go
[51:38] okay is it adding to my faith
[51:42] is it bringing me closer to momo is it
[51:45] bring giving me love
[51:46] is it making me feel alright okay is it
[51:50] is it
[51:50] actually helping me in my walk with the
[51:52] lord no leave it in the pot
[51:54] okay just leave it let it boil okay now
[51:57] you walk in
[51:58] and god says he says to you i want you
[52:02] to talk to that person about jesus
[52:03] christ and you get to the person you say
[52:05] i love jesus christ the guy goes i don't
[52:07] believe you
[52:08] quit grab the fort it's okay throw it in
[52:11] the pot
[52:11] okay i really want to slap that guy
[52:13] because he named you used the name of
[52:15] the lord in vain
[52:16] i do not like that i honestly don't like
[52:18] it why don't they use muhammad and all
[52:20] those other names why always jesus
[52:22] christ
[52:23] so now i get angry now now it plays in
[52:25] my emotional realm now i'm actually
[52:27] starting to manifest something in you
[52:29] it's boiling in me don't let it boil in
[52:31] you
[52:32] take the thought out throw it in the pot
[52:35] say okay
[52:36] this guy doesn't like jesus is that
[52:38] adding to my faith no it's not
[52:40] is it helping me to get closer to god no
[52:42] it's not is it helping him to get closer
[52:43] to god no it's not i'll pray for you
[52:46] yeah there we go so you left that you
[52:48] left the emotion you left the heat you
[52:50] left everything in the pot
[52:52] so when i buy a new game and i can
[52:54] preach games because i played games
[52:56] and you open the cover and it's death
[52:58] and murder and shooting and screaming
[53:00] and
[53:01] take the game and throw it in the pot
[53:04] and then you say
[53:05] does this honor god does it honor god
[53:09] is it bringing me closer to god is it
[53:11] adding to my faith
[53:12] is it helping my faith is it bringing me
[53:15] closer to my brother and sister no
[53:17] leave it in the pot don't entertain it
[53:22] don't take it it's not for you it's just
[53:25] a trick of the devil
[53:27] anything that you get in your head put
[53:29] it in the pot
[53:31] and let it boil because what happens is
[53:34] when we start reasoning and this is what
[53:36] eve done and i'm gonna go into that now
[53:40] and i'm sorry i get very emotional when
[53:42] i think about this thing it says but god
[53:44] gave his word the first place a man
[53:47] can't even come to
[53:49] he can't sin hallelujah now this is here
[53:52] this is the word of god when you hit
[53:54] behind it he said here it is this is
[53:56] coming fresh
[53:57] oh man a man cannot sin
[54:00] first unless he casts aside the word of
[54:03] god
[54:04] he cannot even sin and he has no uh
[54:07] and or disbelieve it he has to first
[54:10] disbelieve the word of god he has to get
[54:12] rid of
[54:12] that um and then and then the praise and
[54:16] of the presence of god and then sorry i
[54:18] messed that up i said he can't even sin
[54:20] that's disbelief until he first gets rid
[54:23] of the word of god
[54:25] the presence of god he cannot sin so
[54:28] when you're behind the word of god
[54:29] you're in the presence of god it's
[54:31] impossible for you to sin
[54:34] impossible and now he brings it into
[54:36] even he says eve could not
[54:38] sin until she laid aside the word of god
[54:42] and she opened up the channels of
[54:44] reasoning
[54:45] through her soul and she became to
[54:47] reason he began to reason
[54:49] why certainly my husband never told me
[54:52] these things
[54:53] i believe you he told it to me and he
[54:56] said i shouldn't do this
[54:57] but you know it makes real good
[55:00] sense explain so of course what she said
[55:04] is when he said surely
[55:06] and then he said because you'll be as
[55:08] gods now it's starting to reason but she
[55:10] didn't grab that thought
[55:11] and just go throw it in the pot and goes
[55:13] okay
[55:15] hold on okay
[55:19] just give me a sec god said if i eat
[55:22] from that tree
[55:23] that's me this guy says surely i'll be
[55:26] like a god
[55:27] i don't want to be like a god i just
[55:29] want to worship him i just want to stay
[55:31] behind this word you know what
[55:32] it's not for me that was god's provided
[55:34] way but that
[55:36] portion is not for me and she moved on
[55:38] and left it in the pot but she didn't
[55:40] and that had to happen for a reason
[55:44] he says there has to be a place selected
[55:47] and this is where our battle belongs
[55:48] this is brother branham saying the
[55:50] battle
[55:50] is the mind he says it's a mutual ground
[55:53] and no man's land
[55:55] and they fight here at this place
[55:58] they don't they just don't fight over
[56:00] here or down
[56:02] there or run to here or over there this
[56:05] is the this is the battlefront where men
[56:08] meet to our regard me to meet the uh
[56:11] test their powers
[56:12] where each enemy tested strength against
[56:15] the other enemy
[56:16] a mutual meeting place now don't miss
[56:19] this
[56:20] when this great battle started on earth
[56:23] it had to have a mutual meeting place
[56:27] and there had to be a place selected for
[56:30] this battle to begin
[56:31] and for this battle to rage and the
[56:34] battlegrounds begin
[56:35] in the human mind that is where the
[56:38] battle starts
[56:39] the human mind was chosen for that place
[56:42] of that battle where it is to begin
[56:46] and that is because that the senior
[56:47] decision was already made
[56:49] from the mind and the head
[56:52] and now i'll finish up with this thought
[56:57] so here here we've got the battle
[57:00] the battlefield is the mine now i'm
[57:03] going to use the example
[57:05] so if we go to the book of joshua you
[57:07] don't need to go there i just need to go
[57:09] there quickly
[57:12] joshua and i think it was chapter 5.
[57:18] joshua is standing here yeah verse 13.
[57:21] he's standing here and he's looking at
[57:24] jericho
[57:26] okay now remember in the first chapter
[57:28] of the book of joshua god says wherever
[57:31] your
[57:31] souls of your feet goes that's yours
[57:34] yours it's a promise it's yours healing
[57:38] yours overcoming power is yours holy
[57:41] ghost is yours
[57:42] all those promises is yours but i need
[57:45] you to do something
[57:47] i need you to show up for the battle so
[57:49] here goes joshua he wakes up the morning
[57:51] and he walks and and i'm just going to
[57:53] dramatize it a bit so please bear with
[57:54] me i don't
[57:55] know the chapter that well but i i know
[57:57] the story because i love it
[58:00] and he comes and he stands and he looks
[58:02] at the walls of jericho
[58:04] and he goes oh dear now i know god's
[58:08] promise
[58:09] i know god can't lie well
[58:13] those walls are pretty big
[58:16] and now satan comes satan goes see
[58:20] those walls are pretty big you know it
[58:23] took me 150 years to build those walls
[58:27] i knew you were coming yeah i prepared
[58:30] those walls
[58:31] those walls are just for you and i know
[58:34] that you
[58:35] you cannot go past those walls
[58:38] it's impossible for you to go past those
[58:40] walls see he's not talking about what
[58:42] god can do
[58:43] he's telling what joshua can't do yes
[58:46] joshua cannot
[58:47] human break those walls down
[58:50] his army isn't even an army that has the
[58:53] right equipment to break the walls down
[58:56] and joshua stands he goes yep
[59:00] sounds about right he says and those
[59:02] walls are thick they can run chariots on
[59:05] those walls
[59:06] yep sounds about right
[59:09] cool and he says so i'm just going to
[59:11] say your campaign is going to stop here
[59:13] what god said in the beginning is just
[59:15] not going to be fulfilled
[59:17] and he goes okay takes the thought
[59:19] throws it in the pot
[59:20] and he starts walking and he goes lord
[59:25] it's true devil says it's impossible but
[59:28] with you nothing's impossible
[59:30] and he keeps wondering he's keeping
[59:32] thinking about the lord and what the
[59:34] lord has done and lord
[59:35] we have crossed the jordan lord it was
[59:38] dry
[59:39] ground lord every step i take
[59:42] i've conquered the enemy where's the
[59:44] difference he started having a testimony
[59:46] service
[59:47] to himself saying what lord has done in
[59:49] his life so now he's taking that very
[59:51] thought
[59:52] and he's discerning it and he's saying
[59:54] but wait this is not adding to my faith
[59:56] so i let her tell you what is adding to
[59:58] my faith
[59:59] what adds to my faith is god has
[1:00:01] delivered me
[1:00:02] god has gotten me this far he will take
[1:00:05] me the rest of the way
[1:00:07] and all of a sudden he looks in front of
[1:00:08] him and there's a
[1:00:10] man and he stands with a sword in his
[1:00:12] hand
[1:00:13] amen and joshua looks at him because
[1:00:16] remember he's having this battle and he
[1:00:18] goes
[1:00:18] are you for us or against us
[1:00:22] that's right and he says no
[1:00:25] the place you're standing on is holy
[1:00:27] ground amen he says and now i'm going to
[1:00:29] remind you of something
[1:00:30] i made a promise amen i keep my promise
[1:00:33] i came to take over
[1:00:36] see he had to discern that thought
[1:00:40] so now the devil comes to you and says
[1:00:41] you can't have your healing
[1:00:45] you can't win this battle
[1:00:48] your family is not yours they're not
[1:00:52] safe where they are
[1:00:55] i got their lives in my hand what are
[1:00:58] you doing with a sword
[1:01:01] you got now two choices you can give it
[1:01:03] life
[1:01:04] or you can kill it right there
[1:01:08] so isn't that where we should be as
[1:01:09] christians
[1:01:11] is when everything hits our head to this
[1:01:13] first throw in the pot and say lord
[1:01:15] i don't understand your word i don't
[1:01:17] know everything
[1:01:18] i'm worried about my mom and dad but you
[1:01:20] know what you got the battle
[1:01:22] you already won the war so i'll just
[1:01:25] come and stand in your camp for a while
[1:01:27] i'll show up for the battle i'll fight
[1:01:29] the devil
[1:01:30] but i need you to do the campaign i need
[1:01:33] you to win the war
[1:01:34] oh lord amen amen
[1:01:37] and he says here he says and the captain
[1:01:39] of the host seek to him
[1:01:40] unto joshua loose thy shoe for the of
[1:01:43] thy foot
[1:01:44] the place where you stand is holy and
[1:01:47] joshua did so
[1:01:50] and he says and the lord said unto
[1:01:52] joshua see
[1:01:53] i have given it into thine hand
[1:01:57] jericho and the king thereof and the
[1:01:59] mighty men of valor
[1:02:03] joshua just had to show up for the
[1:02:05] battle amen
[1:02:06] always belong to the lord and i'll
[1:02:10] finish with this
[1:02:14] the brains of the army lies in its
[1:02:16] captains
[1:02:18] the intelligence he says rommel in
[1:02:21] germany was the brains behind germany
[1:02:23] not hitler rommel
[1:02:24] that's right eisenhower military man
[1:02:27] those men were on the front line
[1:02:30] and the men that were on the front line
[1:02:32] depended on which way
[1:02:34] they gave the order you follow the
[1:02:37] captain
[1:02:38] if he is that right kind of general if
[1:02:40] he's the right kind if he's a four-star
[1:02:42] general
[1:02:43] if he's proved and he's been proven to
[1:02:46] be right
[1:02:47] follow him though it might seem wrong
[1:02:51] it might seem wrong to you go to the
[1:02:54] front
[1:02:54] do as you're told he says hallelujah
[1:02:57] we've got a five-star
[1:02:59] general spell j-e-s-u-s
[1:03:03] place five stars on him
[1:03:06] faith f-a-i-t-h
[1:03:09] he never lost a battle and he will never
[1:03:12] lose a battle
[1:03:14] so whatever the devil tells you let the
[1:03:17] five-star general have the final say
[1:03:21] okay amen so i think after that we can
[1:03:24] go into a word of prayer
[1:03:26] because there's many things that happens
[1:03:28] brother ben i don't know if you want to
[1:03:29] have some announcements or anything
[1:03:36] if there's any pre-requests don't you
[1:03:38] don't need to tell me
[1:03:40] the lord sees your battle rebecca he
[1:03:43] sees it
[1:03:45] it's real yep
[1:03:53] emily glenn and maya
[1:03:57] we've got a five-star general there's a
[1:03:59] brother that's got cancer or kidney
[1:04:01] failure
[1:04:02] brother cyril doctor says he's got a
[1:04:06] week
[1:04:07] what does the physician say look
[1:04:10] in this sermon or maybe just bring the
[1:04:12] scene in the sermon brother
[1:04:14] branham opens and he needs a a woman a
[1:04:17] sister
[1:04:18] bell and he and and she comes
[1:04:21] and they come with a prerequisite for
[1:04:23] this sister bell and he says there's
[1:04:24] another sister and the sister's name was
[1:04:27] um oh give me a sec i need to catch that
[1:04:30] give me i need to put this this is gonna
[1:04:32] just
[1:04:34] and he says i need to pray for the
[1:04:38] sister
[1:04:41] give me a sec i want to get it right
[1:04:52] amen
[1:05:02] it's a sister belle
[1:05:11] and a sister shepherd so the prayer
[1:05:14] request comes in
[1:05:15] he has to pray for sister shepherd now
[1:05:17] don't lose the thought
[1:05:19] remember god is doing the work and he
[1:05:22] says he climbs out of his bed
[1:05:24] and he says the message came from sister
[1:05:26] bell i have to pray for sister shepherd
[1:05:28] she's very sick and we have to intercede
[1:05:30] so he goes on his knees
[1:05:32] and he prays for sister shepherd and the
[1:05:34] next morning the news comes
[1:05:36] back sister bellas passed away and the
[1:05:39] message got to him wrong
[1:05:41] it was supposed to sister shepard said
[1:05:43] he has to pray for sister bell
[1:05:46] and he says this he says to this morning
[1:05:49] we are one
[1:05:50] soldier laced fighting the army we are
[1:05:53] one less
[1:05:54] one weaker finding the army
[1:05:58] one weaker he says she's a believer she
[1:06:01] went into glory
[1:06:02] and she will get a reward but we're one
[1:06:05] weaker
[1:06:07] so souls matter in this fight
[1:06:11] and see your prayers matter so even if
[1:06:14] brother cyril
[1:06:15] is having kidney failure and the doctor
[1:06:17] sees this out we can intercede
[1:06:20] we've got a living god he healed back
[1:06:23] then he heals back now he does not
[1:06:25] change
[1:06:26] don't let doubt come in your head now
[1:06:28] you've got two choices
[1:06:29] you can believe that word or you can put
[1:06:32] the rest of it in the thing
[1:06:33] and the pot and let it burn but don't
[1:06:37] doubt because the moment you doubt you
[1:06:40] have no foundation
[1:06:41] i'm not saying work yourself up just
[1:06:43] trust god can do it
[1:06:46] because he is there the sword's drawn he
[1:06:48] showed up it's holy ground
[1:06:50] he's here he says with two or more
[1:06:51] gathering my name i'm there he's here
[1:06:54] ask what you want ask what you want
[1:06:59] don't smoke small things ask big things
[1:07:02] are things with eternal value
[1:07:04] are things that matter my family's in
[1:07:06] south africa they're going through
[1:07:07] turmoil
[1:07:08] america is burning this whole world's
[1:07:11] falling apart
[1:07:12] ask and step in so if you have a burner
[1:07:15] for someone tonight
[1:07:16] pray for them pray for them and ask god
[1:07:19] to intercede because it's only him that
[1:07:21] can take the fight it's not
[1:07:22] us we're just ambassadors we've sent the
[1:07:25] word back to the king saying we need
[1:07:26] reinforcements let him send it
[1:07:29] but just hold your ground hold your
[1:07:32] ground
[1:07:32] no matter what you do tonight hold your
[1:07:35] ground
[1:07:36] drive that that land draw it in the sand
[1:07:39] draw that line in the sand and take your
[1:07:42] stance
[1:07:43] because your enemy can't go past that
[1:07:45] night amen
[1:07:47] conquer past that night amen so let's
[1:07:49] all stand up
[1:07:53] and let's address the king tonight and
[1:07:55] if it's for yourself pray
[1:07:57] don't be ashamed you children never be
[1:08:00] ashamed from praying out loud amen
[1:08:02] because i'll tell you something the
[1:08:04] devil can't hear in your heart
[1:08:06] he can't discern the intent of the heart
[1:08:09] he doesn't have that sword
[1:08:11] he can't he can't listen richie in your
[1:08:13] heart he doesn't know so if you pray
[1:08:15] very softly
[1:08:16] the lord can hear you it's fine but your
[1:08:19] enemy is not getting addressed
[1:08:21] brother andy said i was brushing my
[1:08:22] teeth and then he starts
[1:08:24] throwing dots at me why why
[1:08:28] because i can't speak i can't tell him
[1:08:30] where he belongs
[1:08:32] so he'll come to you every time you have
[1:08:34] yourself busy
[1:08:35] but don't think you can think him out of
[1:08:37] your head
[1:08:38] it's impossible you have to address him
[1:08:40] with your words
[1:08:42] the word of god speak it and he'll flee
[1:08:44] he can't
[1:08:45] he'll come back he'll try you again
[1:08:48] so look at the war this is the war
[1:08:52] this is the battle you might have many
[1:08:54] little battles
[1:08:56] but this is one this is done eh
[1:09:00] so don't don't concentrate on this yes
[1:09:02] show up for this
[1:09:04] but let him do this say amen at least
[1:09:07] just close our eyes
