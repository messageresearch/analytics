[26:58] great
[26:59] all good i can see everyone's already
[27:01] and and and waiting so he says here

[27:10] all ye that labor
[27:12] and a heavy laden
[27:14] and i will give you rest
[27:17] take my yoke
[27:19] upon you
[27:21] and learn of me
[27:23] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[27:26] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[27:30] for my yoke is easy
[27:32] and my burden is light
[27:35] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[27:38] prayer
[27:38] lord jesus father this is your word
[27:41] father and
[27:42] we believe father that that invitation
[27:44] is just as real now
[27:46] lord jesus as it was father when you
[27:49] spoke it
[27:50] and father it is an invitation
[27:53] for humanity
[27:54] to to to to find rest
[27:58] to find peace
[28:00] to find calm in the storm to find an
[28:03] anchor
[28:04] to build their lives on a rock
[28:06] of revelation
[28:08] lord to to to be rescued father from
[28:11] turmoil and storms and and unstability
[28:15] lord and and to find rest and to be
[28:18] lord
[28:19] settled at heart
[28:21] and lord i pray that tonight lord jesus
[28:24] that but what you've placed on my heart
[28:26] lord would be revealed and it would just
[28:28] be expressed lord i yield myself to you
[28:31] and just pray that you would utilize
[28:33] lips and ears and hearts this morning of
[28:36] this evening lord and may we just have
[28:38] fellowship lord around the the shed
[28:41] blood of our great king's sacrifice
[28:44] and lord we we just believe tonight lord
[28:47] that it is a finished work and we can
[28:49] enter in lord you've made a way lord you
[28:52] paid the penalty of sin you paid it in
[28:55] full and now lord you're saying come to
[28:57] me for i'll give you rest and i'll give
[29:00] you peace and i'll change your situation
[29:02] and i'll oh i'll arrange it all you just
[29:04] just trust in me
[29:06] oh lord we trusting in you tonight we're
[29:08] looking unto you jesus and we're saying
[29:10] we trust you and and we're looking to
[29:13] you lord for our rest and we're looking
[29:16] lord to maintain rest as we walk this
[29:20] earth and as we father
[29:22] lord carry the spirit and flesh
[29:25] lord jesus that's subject to all sorts
[29:27] of variables and situations and our past
[29:31] and and all of these things that come
[29:33] against us lord and the enemy and how he
[29:36] would seek to pull us down and and
[29:38] destroy our lives and destroy our
[29:40] experience lord but he cannot take our
[29:42] soul he cannot get into that anchor and
[29:45] take us out of our rest but lord truly
[29:47] father lord there is an element of a
[29:50] fight that we must fight lord as we're
[29:53] resting in you
[29:54] and father we believe that you've got
[29:56] the sword you've got this covered you've
[29:58] finished the work and you fight our
[30:00] battles this is how we fight our battles
[30:02] lord and father i just pray lord tonight
[30:04] lord you would speak to our hearts in
[30:06] the name of jesus christ bless your word
[30:08] lord amen
[30:10] hallelujah god bless you saints if
[30:12] you're standing you may be seated
[30:14] hallelujah
[30:16] is there anybody here that has an amen
[30:19] amen do i hear i hear rustling going on
[30:23] somewhere in there i'm sure there's
[30:24] somebody that's got a microphone amen
[30:27] hallelujah
[30:29] amen
[30:30] oh i can hear somebody amen hallelujah
[30:33] so
[30:34] tonight i just have a little thought
[30:36] here it's called staying in god's rest
[30:39] and hallelujah it just came to me about
[30:41] two weeks ago
[30:43] um
[30:44] and i just want to read now the same
[30:46] verse um
[30:48] from
[30:49] it's matthew 11 29 but it's actually out
[30:51] of the
[30:52] um the
[30:54] the apostolic
[30:56] um
[30:57] polyglot
[30:58] which is the literal
[31:00] formation of it without you know
[31:03] changing anything for english purposes
[31:05] and so it says here and it just will
[31:07] illuminate
[31:08] a little thought here um that's very
[31:11] important
[31:12] um for
[31:13] entering into rest amen i want to just
[31:15] go through a bit of entering into god's
[31:17] rest and and the benefits of god's rest
[31:20] and then i want to talk about uh as the
[31:22] lord leads um
[31:24] how you know there is an element where
[31:27] the devil will use our past against us
[31:29] and will use our weaknesses and things
[31:32] that are in our life that against us to
[31:35] pull us out
[31:36] of
[31:38] the experience of what our rest the
[31:40] fullness of it and all of its benefits
[31:43] to try and bring us out of that and he
[31:46] cannot take us out of our soul but he
[31:48] can certainly trouble us in our spirit
[31:50] and trouble us and our mind and trouble
[31:52] us in our flesh
[31:54] because those parts are subject to the
[31:56] fall amen so in this verse it says here
[32:00] now it's this is
[32:02] 11 29 so
[32:04] it says here
[32:05] lift
[32:06] my yoke upon you
[32:11] and not just take my yoke see taking is
[32:14] a verb it's a doing word it's an action
[32:16] but here it actually refines it slightly
[32:19] to say lift my yoke upon you
[32:22] you see many times in the in the altar
[32:25] call in the prophet's message he would
[32:28] he would he would say
[32:31] you know
[32:32] raise your hand if you want to give your
[32:34] life to god
[32:37] lift your hand
[32:38] stand up
[32:40] there needs to be an action and he says
[32:42] there's some spirit that's driving you
[32:44] to do that because gravity will hold
[32:46] your hand on the floor but something's
[32:49] causing you to lift your hand and you're
[32:51] making an action towards
[32:54] something and in this case an action
[32:58] towards giving your life to god and here
[33:01] jesus is saying you need to take action
[33:04] you need to take action towards this
[33:07] promise that i've
[33:09] made for you and i say this to you all
[33:12] and to anyone that would hear this that
[33:14] there is a definite action
[33:17] that you need to and put in place and to
[33:20] act upon the promises of god we are to
[33:23] act upon this call of jesus christ
[33:26] saying come to me
[33:28] all that you labor in a heavy laden
[33:31] who's burdened who's just
[33:33] troubled in their heart and troubled in
[33:35] their mind and tossed to and fro and and
[33:39] struggling in many different fronts
[33:42] lift my yoke upon you he says
[33:44] lift it raise your hands stand up get
[33:47] out of your situation come towards the
[33:49] promise make an action towards
[33:52] the promise that i am going to give you
[33:55] rest i want to enter into your life deep
[33:58] into your life and change the things
[34:00] about you so that you can reflect me
[34:03] amen amen
[34:05] amen
[34:07] lift my yoke upon you
[34:09] and learn of me
[34:11] for i am gentle
[34:13] and humble in the heart
[34:15] and you shall find rest for your soul
[34:18] you see now the lord is dealing with the
[34:20] very heart of the believer
[34:23] he's saying i will give you an anchor of
[34:26] rest in your soul
[34:29] you come to me and find rest you cease
[34:31] from your works as god ceased from his
[34:34] and we'll get into that a little bit
[34:35] later you enter into this rest and you
[34:38] take a step back from the leadership of
[34:40] your own life
[34:42] and stop yielding to your own will and
[34:44] your own ambitions and your own dreams
[34:46] and and and surrender them and let and
[34:49] let me lead you
[34:52] you will then find rest to your soul
[34:54] because the headship you see now this
[34:58] there's a beautiful picture of lifting
[35:01] his yoke upon you
[35:03] amen it says that the government is upon
[35:05] his shoulders and you see the yoke is a
[35:08] two
[35:08] two part thing it's him and you
[35:12] and you come into it
[35:14] he becomes your head and you come under
[35:17] his yoke you lift his yoke upon you and
[35:19] you come under the covenant of his
[35:21] leadership of his government of his
[35:24] husbandry you see he wants you to yoke
[35:27] up with him he wants to be your leader
[35:30] he wants to be the strong one in the
[35:32] yolk you see in a yoke of ops and they
[35:35] have a bar or however it looks and if i
[35:38] was brother isaac i'd probably have a
[35:40] good old picture up there but you know
[35:42] it didn't quite happen this time but um
[35:44] you see in in a yoke you have um in a
[35:47] typical yoke you have two um
[35:50] option per row and so the lord is saying
[35:54] come and join my row
[35:56] come and lift my yoke upon you my
[35:58] burden's not going to overbear you my
[36:01] yoke is easy
[36:02] hallelujah
[36:05] and he's saying
[36:06] let my headship come upon you the
[36:08] government's on my shoulders so why
[36:10] don't you just now enter and take this
[36:12] promise and and find rest for your soul
[36:16] now the soul when it finds rest and he
[36:20] comes to live inside you through the
[36:22] baptism of the holy ghost and you see
[36:24] you completely yielding to him now and
[36:27] the government and the care is upon his
[36:30] shoulders and god becomes totally
[36:33] sovereign in your life
[36:38] who knows what it's like to have god
[36:40] sovereign in their life
[36:43] if you don't know what it's like to have
[36:45] god sovereign in your life you have
[36:48] never really had joy
[36:51] you've never really had peace you've
[36:54] never really tasted truly tasted and
[36:57] experienced heaven in your soul
[37:00] you might have had anointings you might
[37:02] have had wonderful experiences you might
[37:04] have had thrill rides and fizziness and
[37:06] all sorts of different ideas and things
[37:08] and great things but
[37:10] unless he's become sovereign
[37:13] unless he's become the king unless his
[37:15] government is upon his shoulders and
[37:17] you've taken that yoke upon you
[37:20] they tasted nothing yet and it's beyond
[37:22] anything you could ever dream anything
[37:24] you could ever imagine it's the greatest
[37:27] and you see even as we read through the
[37:30] message and we and we and we and we go
[37:32] through the church age book and we we
[37:34] talk about and we read about who's read
[37:36] about the key of david
[37:37] yeah
[37:39] see the key of david and i think this is
[37:41] a very beautiful picture because the key
[37:43] of david if you look at what god
[37:45] promised david
[37:46] in david is the promise of heaven and
[37:49] david is the promise of
[37:51] of of of of the throne
[37:54] and david the davidic covenant and if
[37:55] you go read that you'll enjoy it and
[37:57] you'll have a good time
[37:59] regarding the access and he promises
[38:01] david that your son shall sit on my
[38:03] throne forever and and and the
[38:05] millennium is under the throne of david
[38:08] and and there's an access
[38:10] granted you know you go out to a high
[38:13] security gate and you you've got the key
[38:16] and you and you click the key
[38:18] amen and and it says and it goes green
[38:21] and it says you can enter and something
[38:23] goes click
[38:24] hallelujah you get the door you get a
[38:27] revelation hallelujah and the key to the
[38:29] door is open and all of a sudden you get
[38:32] access to everything that is inside
[38:35] amen and so the key of david is divine
[38:38] access into heaven and not just when you
[38:41] get a body change but now
[38:46] now
[38:47] it's an access that as god becomes
[38:49] sovereign in your life as you truly deny
[38:53] yourself and enter into this rest
[38:56] and he becomes the headship and the
[38:58] government comes over your life that you
[39:00] are willing as the bride who knows the
[39:03] picture of the jewish wedding and and
[39:05] she takes the veil and she places it on
[39:08] his shoulders and it shows that he now
[39:10] they're shutting together in the secret
[39:12] place and and and he becomes the
[39:14] headship and it's a great beautiful love
[39:17] relationship and it's and and and it's
[39:20] completely his sovereignty and his
[39:23] leadership and the son of god
[39:27] becomes the very keeper of your life
[39:31] and
[39:32] and the son of god
[39:33] the second adam
[39:35] is now coming into your garden
[39:38] and he finds the garden a terrible mess
[39:43] you see but when he comes in it's a
[39:45] terrible mess
[39:47] and if you haven't had him come in you
[39:49] may think that your life is all good but
[39:51] inside it's a terrible mess
[39:53] because you see the only way for your
[39:56] garden the only way for your land for
[39:59] your life to be cleaned up and to be
[40:02] worked by the true husbandman is when
[40:04] you truly find rest is when you cease
[40:07] from your works so that god
[40:10] can come in and be sovereign and he
[40:12] wants sovereignty he doesn't want 99
[40:15] percent he wants 100
[40:17] sovereignty in your life and he's
[40:19] calling you and he will never force you
[40:22] you see if you think about it he says
[40:24] lift my yoke upon you he says it doesn't
[40:27] say i'm gonna place my yoke on you it
[40:30] doesn't say i'm gonna lift it for you
[40:32] it's saying lift my yoke upon you raise
[40:35] your hand defy gravity stand up enter in
[40:40] come across come out go be on the camp
[40:42] and enter into the fellowship come
[40:45] there's a promise that's hanging over
[40:47] your life
[40:48] there's a promise to enter in there's a
[40:50] promise of life for you right now to
[40:53] come and have stability and come and
[40:55] have life under the baptism of the holy
[40:57] ghost
[40:59] to truly find rest
[41:01] so the son of god can come into you and
[41:03] begin to work your life begin to create
[41:07] an edenic condition within you
[41:09] because this is the prerogative this is
[41:11] the will of god that he would take a
[41:14] vile old sinning heart and he would turn
[41:16] it into something beautiful he would
[41:18] turn to something that's worth living in
[41:21] he would give it a heavenly atmosphere
[41:23] in the soul
[41:25] hallelujah
[41:28] now
[41:29] when there is an identity condition
[41:32] within you because you have finally
[41:34] entered into rest and i want to speak to
[41:36] spirit-filled believers
[41:38] not just i'm not just dealing now
[41:41] with
[41:42] people that need to enter into that rest
[41:44] of their soul
[41:45] but i'm also want to speak to the people
[41:47] that have entered into the rest in their
[41:50] soul
[41:50] and and and yet they still have trouble
[41:54] and i saw a great picture about an hour
[41:56] ago
[41:58] as i was studying and praying and
[42:00] and and i believe the lord just showed
[42:03] me a beautiful picture
[42:04] that
[42:05] you see right at the beginning
[42:08] we have god and we have him rooted over
[42:11] the earth and he put the son of god the
[42:13] first adam he put him on the earth to
[42:15] till the soil now
[42:17] this was while god was resting
[42:20] and you see
[42:21] amen i want you to realize that you're
[42:24] called to enter into rest as and cease
[42:26] from your works
[42:28] as god ceased from his works
[42:30] and so i was taste tracing this back and
[42:32] i was like what happened after god
[42:34] ceased from his works in god's eden that
[42:37] he created for the first adam for the
[42:40] son of god
[42:41] under the adamic covenant what happened
[42:44] and
[42:44] and what happened and what what came
[42:46] about in this garden that was perfect
[42:49] and these people were perfect and yet
[42:51] there was an ability to sin
[42:55] and under that adamic covenant if there
[42:57] wasn't the grace to to to bring you back
[43:01] instantly like there is now and we'll
[43:03] get into that a little bit later because
[43:05] you see the first adam was god's son and
[43:08] yet this adam it says in the bible that
[43:11] through the first adam all were lost
[43:15] hallelujah but through the second adam
[43:17] all was given life hallelujah who loves
[43:20] the second adam tonight
[43:22] amen who's who's all for jesus tonight
[43:25] amen hallelujah this this jesus is a
[43:28] different son of god and he's living in
[43:30] your eden but back in the other eden
[43:32] back in the first eden we have now god
[43:35] resting and god plants his garden and he
[43:38] begins to have a family resting just
[43:40] like you you're resting and you've got a
[43:43] family and you've got a home and you're
[43:44] planting your garden and you're doing
[43:46] these things resting and the son of
[43:48] god's in your life and he's got it
[43:50] sorted and he wants to keep you sorted
[43:52] he wants to keep your home identic he
[43:54] wants to keep the atmosphere in your
[43:56] house real good
[43:58] providing you cease from your works
[44:00] providing you stop doing it in your own
[44:02] strength providing you stop using your
[44:04] own intellectual ability to to harness
[44:07] your family to to run the show
[44:10] but let god let the son of god the one
[44:12] that's gracious the one that can redeem
[44:14] you the one that can keep you let him
[44:18] be the keeper let him be the husbandman
[44:21] in your soul in your garden to hold you
[44:25] because i'm going to promise you
[44:27] something there is trouble
[44:30] coming and if it's not coming it's here
[44:33] amen
[44:34] real trouble but your soul is anchored
[44:38] don't be discouraged when you fail
[44:40] because your soul is anchored
[44:42] spirit-filled believer
[44:44] yeah hallelujah
[44:46] resting his god on the seventh day and
[44:49] he's planted a garden he's a husbandman
[44:52] he wants a family and he begins to start
[44:54] a family in this edenic condition that
[44:56] he made and it didn't start like that he
[44:59] made it like that just like you didn't
[45:01] start like that but he made you like
[45:03] that he gave you life he gave you
[45:05] endemic conditions his grace has brought
[45:08] you here
[45:09] oh yeah
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] this grace is what's raised the standard
[45:13] in your life against all the floods of
[45:15] the enemy
[45:16] i don't even know there's trouble
[45:18] even though there's hardship even though
[45:21] you fail
[45:22] his grace the son of god is different
[45:24] from the first adam
[45:27] who's glad for that
[45:29] who's glad that the second adam in you
[45:32] is far greater covenant than the one
[45:34] under adam the first adam
[45:37] but you see god in his rest on the earth
[45:40] and the land edenic
[45:43] he has trouble coming
[45:45] the the sun that he placed in there
[45:48] see god now in his rest and in his time
[45:51] now has to come down to the earth and
[45:54] begin to sort out the trouble
[45:56] that has been created and through the
[45:58] fall and he begin to redeem man and so
[46:01] this is as far as we go
[46:03] this particular picture because i want
[46:06] to show you a picture that yes
[46:08] even though you're resting and your soul
[46:11] is anchored in a haven of rest and
[46:13] you're completely sealed until the day
[46:15] of your redemption and your spirit
[46:17] filled but then there will be times
[46:19] where just by some temptation or by some
[46:23] failure or some past experience there
[46:25] becomes a trouble in your eden
[46:29] a trouble
[46:30] that begins to pull you down it begins
[46:32] to break you down it begins to make you
[46:34] nervous it begins to tear you apart
[46:36] until you're
[46:38] struggling with all sorts of things and
[46:40] and and the devil comes to you and says
[46:42] oh you're not even a believer or you're
[46:44] not even filled but actually even
[46:47] it says there
[46:49] just cease from your works
[46:51] as god did from his
[46:53] see god knew that the first adam had it
[46:56] sorted in the garden
[47:00] god knew that the first adam he was
[47:02] keeping the earth he named the animals
[47:04] he moves the trees he had his title deed
[47:07] and he could do that
[47:09] and so god rested and he enjoyed his
[47:11] family hallelujah every night he'd come
[47:14] down and have fellowship with his son
[47:16] and with eve and his daughter and and
[47:18] just have a good time
[47:20] but
[47:21] you see when the trouble began to happen
[47:24] in the land god had to administer
[47:27] redemption
[47:29] through that trouble through in that
[47:31] idiotic condition to show us a beautiful
[47:34] picture i believe which just came to me
[47:36] about an hour ago that
[47:39] that even though your soul is anchored
[47:42] and there is an identity condition in
[47:44] your life
[47:45] there is still going to be trouble and
[47:47] there are going to be times where you
[47:49] need to just step back and say god
[47:53] i don't have the first adam in me this
[47:54] time he's the one that's caused all the
[47:56] trouble actually i do he's in my flesh
[47:58] and he's like that part of that old
[48:00] nature he's that tree of knowledge but
[48:02] let me declare something to you saint
[48:05] spirit-filled believer the tree of life
[48:08] is blooming in you
[48:10] oh louie i'm going to read a quote
[48:12] in a second
[48:13] and in your eden
[48:15] in that paradise that you have inside
[48:17] you regardless of how you feel right now
[48:20] regardless of your condition if you're
[48:22] filled with the spirit there is an
[48:24] identity condition birth blooming within
[48:27] your life because the second adam the
[48:30] one that can't fail the one that can
[48:33] bring you back the one that can pardon
[48:35] your transgressions hallelujah that one
[48:38] is inside you that's the one that can
[48:40] change the situation hallelujah so cease
[48:43] from your works as god did from his
[48:46] hallelujah because the difference is now
[48:48] god in his full measure has come down
[48:52] into his bride and it's that god the
[48:54] same god is the one that's not ceased
[48:57] from his works anymore god is working
[49:00] hallelujah he's working in your life
[49:03] he's working in your soul
[49:05] glory to god
[49:07] amen
[49:10] amen no matter where you're at
[49:13] you come god's provided way and you lift
[49:15] his yoke upon you and you say lord jesus
[49:19] and you mean it with all your heart oh
[49:21] god be sovereign in my life i want to
[49:24] have your yoke upon me i'm going to lift
[49:26] it up i'm going to put it on me and i'm
[49:28] going to put my veil on your shoulders
[49:30] lord i trust you lord jesus
[49:33] i'm trusting you lord hallelujah you see
[49:36] what happens you will enter into rest
[49:38] and you'll let the real true son of god
[49:41] begin to work in your heart begin to
[49:43] work in your life and then when trouble
[49:46] does come and when the i will call it
[49:49] for this case trouble in the land
[49:52] trouble in your promised land
[49:55] hallelujah because you see when you
[49:57] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:59] and you enter into rest you see it is
[50:02] not the end of your troubles
[50:04] it's not the end of your your failures
[50:08] it's the end
[50:10] uh what's the word now
[50:13] i have to read this quote because
[50:14] i i love the word that the prophet use
[50:17] amen
[50:18] it's the end of you
[50:21] going astray under your own leadership
[50:24] hallelujah the prophet says it's the he
[50:27] says that
[50:29] they which have entered into his rest
[50:31] has ceased from their going astray
[50:34] hallelujah
[50:36] like that i'm going to claim that who
[50:38] claims that tonight
[50:40] they that have entered into his rest
[50:42] have ceased from going astray
[50:44] because you see you've been tied to your
[50:46] absolute
[50:48] you've been tied to the holiest of
[50:49] holies your soul has been entered into
[50:51] that rest
[50:52] but you still have a spirit
[50:55] and you still have a flesh and you still
[50:57] have a past and you still have these
[50:59] things that the devil will try against
[51:01] you all the time
[51:03] and it's those troubles it's those
[51:05] temptations it's the tree of knowledge
[51:08] and when you begin to yield to that tree
[51:10] and you begin to bear fruit for the tree
[51:12] of knowledge and and you you become very
[51:14] fruitful in in this kingdom of knowledge
[51:17] and education
[51:18] you are
[51:20] becoming more susceptible to the
[51:22] troubles and the temptations because you
[51:24] can only do so much this human being has
[51:27] only got so much capacity to to yield
[51:30] some dead members to so the so paul in
[51:33] the bible in romans 6 and i he says
[51:36] in this subject around there who you
[51:39] yield your members your arms and your
[51:41] mouth and your ears and your eyes and
[51:43] your legs
[51:44] your members too is to whom you obey and
[51:47] to whom you obey
[51:49] that's this is who you're yielding to
[51:51] what is the spirit
[51:53] what is it and how is it pulling you
[51:57] and what is the influence of it amen
[52:00] amen
[52:01] laurie
[52:04] so i asked this question
[52:06] do you really trust him
[52:09] amen
[52:10] do you totally trust him
[52:13] because it's very easy to trust god for
[52:15] most things and then hold back some
[52:17] things and you begin to worry about your
[52:19] outcome you begin to worry about your
[52:21] finances you begin to worry about your
[52:23] friendships or worry about whatever's
[52:26] going on in the world worrying about the
[52:28] unsettled times in the war
[52:30] but do you totally trust him
[52:32] have you found rest for your soul and
[52:35] let me tell you this the rest is not
[52:38] just for your soul
[52:39] the rest is for your spirit and your
[52:40] flesh the rest is a total deliverance
[52:44] the rest is a total healing it's a total
[52:47] all-encumbersome
[52:49] reality for you to be at complete rest
[52:52] and to be completely healed and to be
[52:54] completely free from your past and free
[52:56] from all the memories and free from all
[52:58] the troubles and the depression and the
[53:00] and the anxieties free
[53:03] completely free and you see when there's
[53:05] trouble god went down to eden and you
[53:08] begin to sort it out and he sorted out
[53:10] so much that now we have a redeemer
[53:12] living inside of us amen so how if there
[53:15] is a redeemer living inside of us when
[53:17] there's trouble in your eden when
[53:18] there's trouble in your home when
[53:20] there's trouble knocking at your door
[53:22] there is a son of god that is ready and
[53:25] waiting to raise a standard against it
[53:28] but the trouble and the challenge of the
[53:30] whole thing is are you going to do it or
[53:33] are you going to let him do it
[53:35] all right
[53:38] because we can figure things out and you
[53:40] may have a good idea
[53:42] but
[53:43] most of the time it's not the way that
[53:45] the lord wants to do it
[53:46] and i can i can put my hand up twice for
[53:48] that
[53:49] although i'm sure anyone that's honest
[53:51] with himself can say yep i know what
[53:53] that's like oh man
[53:55] you know because sometimes you you we
[53:57] have and actually there's a quote later
[54:00] on that says we're too
[54:01] we're too strong in the head
[54:04] oh my help me lord
[54:07] oh my oh
[54:09] let's read this quote here actually this
[54:10] is the quote here
[54:11] it says the cases with us that
[54:14] not that we are too weak
[54:16] the case is we're too strong
[54:21] we're just too strong he says that's all
[54:24] the thing of it is we're too
[54:26] strong-headed
[54:27] that's right
[54:29] we're too strong in our head
[54:31] we know too much
[54:33] god wants to get that out of us
[54:35] yeah take it out
[54:38] help me jesus that's right we're too
[54:40] strong we're too strong to yield to him
[54:43] i thought well that's
[54:45] this is this is coming right home to me
[54:48] we got he says we yield to ourselves
[54:58] now paul says this and he's speaking to
[55:00] spiritual believers
[55:02] who are struggling and getting pulled
[55:03] and tempted because of the their past
[55:06] and the religion the religious past of
[55:09] jew of judaism and the mosaic covenant
[55:12] and the law and obviously all of the um
[55:15] pharisaic and rabbinical
[55:19] uh attributes of judaism that had crept
[55:22] in that jesus rebuked the pharisees for
[55:23] he said that how bad in vain do you
[55:26] worship me because you're teaching the
[55:27] doctrine the commandments of man and
[55:29] they raised up the commandments of the
[55:30] rabbis and all of that
[55:32] over the word of god and
[55:34] and they they missed the word and so
[55:36] jesus rebuked them for that
[55:38] and yet these people true believers now
[55:41] paul speaking to the galatians in
[55:43] galatians 3 1
[55:44] he he he's now addressing the galatians
[55:47] and he's he's basically got to rescue
[55:50] these people because they've allowed
[55:52] their past to come into the to the
[55:55] present and it's an old covenant it's in
[55:57] its and it's in it and it won't work you
[56:00] see because the covenant that we're
[56:02] under is not by works
[56:04] it is not by what we can do to enter in
[56:08] it's by what he's done and by us
[56:11] surrendering
[56:13] there's nothing else you can do other
[56:15] than and believe and say here i am lord
[56:17] i surrender all it just come a total
[56:21] absolute trust in him and surrender and
[56:24] faith in the finished work of the cross
[56:26] and what he did that he promised and is
[56:29] willing to give you the holy ghost
[56:31] amen you come as provided way you come
[56:34] according to his word and you find rest
[56:36] for your soul and you see the galatians
[56:38] had found rest and they had come as
[56:40] provided way and these are spirit-filled
[56:42] men and women that paul now god has sent
[56:45] paul with a burden to rescue them from
[56:48] coming out of god's rest in their mind
[56:51] and the beginning to teach the people
[56:54] unrestful things
[56:56] beginning to bring the law back in and
[56:58] beginning to bring works back in and and
[57:00] the studies of all different things and
[57:02] so just read this here because why i
[57:04] want to read this is to show you that it
[57:06] is possible for spirit-filled people to
[57:09] to
[57:11] not lose their salvation to not lose
[57:13] their souls rest but to come under a
[57:16] guise or a cunning craftiness or some
[57:19] ideology that can pull them out of
[57:22] actually living in their rest and and
[57:25] and i i'm gonna call this trouble in
[57:27] your land
[57:29] and if the devil's tempted you to go
[57:31] into a legalistic
[57:33] ideology or to begin to try and do it
[57:35] yourself or to introduce your own ideas
[57:38] or to introduce your own ability
[57:40] your own intellectualism
[57:42] your own understanding and knowledge to
[57:45] try and figure it out
[57:46] then you come to fall in this category
[57:49] even as a spiritual believer in the mind
[57:51] realm
[57:52] and this is the time like god when he
[57:55] ceased from his works he still went down
[57:57] and rescued his son
[58:00] he still went down and caused the
[58:02] reverse
[58:03] of the destruction of human beings
[58:06] he he changed the situation and and you
[58:09] see now the beautiful picture that we
[58:11] have here is that we have the son of god
[58:15] living in us right now and he's the one
[58:18] that when we cease from our works and
[58:20] maybe we get to go into something that
[58:22] is a little bit off or a little bit
[58:24] funky or we begin to get torn down in
[58:26] our mind about something and here is the
[58:29] son of god just waiting
[58:31] for you to say oh god here i am come
[58:34] back he says i'm not going to destroy
[58:36] you i'm not going to judge you i'm going
[58:37] to bring you back you see he's always
[58:40] willing and waiting for you to come back
[58:42] he's always waiting for you to make it
[58:44] right and just get back down and let him
[58:46] be the king let him be sovereign again
[58:49] and when he's sovereign you will taste
[58:52] your heavenly inheritance again
[58:55] you will come back into your heavenly
[58:57] atmosphere again
[58:59] and it's you don't have to earn it back
[59:01] you just need to make it right
[59:03] you don't have to try and work anything
[59:04] up you don't have to grovel you don't
[59:06] have to spend 10 hours crying and you
[59:09] can if you like i'm not saying you're
[59:11] not allowed but
[59:14] the moment that confession leaves your
[59:16] lips the moment you make it right the
[59:19] son of god is ready to restore heavenly
[59:21] access to you ready to restore that
[59:24] beautiful fellowship with you ready to
[59:26] give you all the access back to you all
[59:28] of the things and the first love that
[59:30] you had when you first got saved and you
[59:32] were so happy and you know that who
[59:34] remembers that who has that you see it's
[59:37] already yours it's already yours to walk
[59:39] it hallelujah it's just sometimes you
[59:42] begin to do it in your own strength
[59:44] sometimes you begin to figure it all out
[59:46] yourself and all of a sudden you find
[59:48] yourself out of the atmosphere
[59:51] and you're and there's a bit of a
[59:52] wilderness going on in your life
[59:54] but thank god for the wilderness that
[59:56] can teach you not to do that again
[59:59] not to yield to your own self again
[1:00:01] and so paul says here he says o foolish
[1:00:04] galatians who has bewitched you that you
[1:00:07] should not obey the truth
[1:00:09] before whose eyes jesus christ has been
[1:00:12] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:00:15] it's finished hallelujah you don't have
[1:00:17] to earn anything you don't have to be
[1:00:20] anything to be accepted you are accepted
[1:00:23] you're completely accepted you're not
[1:00:25] just accepted in christ you're accepted
[1:00:27] in the beloved hallelujah you're
[1:00:29] accepted in the family of god hallelujah
[1:00:32] you young children if there's any young
[1:00:33] children listening to this you don't
[1:00:35] have to earn your place in the circle
[1:00:37] you don't have to be something to be
[1:00:39] accepted you are accepted amongst your
[1:00:42] brothers and sisters you just accept
[1:00:44] that hallelujah
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:47] why are you accepted because of what he
[1:00:49] did
[1:00:51] we're preaching christ crucified among
[1:00:53] you
[1:00:54] he's the one that was accepted he's the
[1:00:56] one that had to earn it he's the one
[1:00:58] that did it who believes he did it
[1:01:00] tonight who believes that our champion
[1:01:02] conquered death hell in the grave took
[1:01:04] the keys of satan raised the people out
[1:01:06] and gave us access back
[1:01:08] and that's the one that's living in you
[1:01:10] that's the one that's so concerned about
[1:01:12] everything in your life he's the one
[1:01:14] that's saying let me be sovereign he's
[1:01:16] the one that's saying come to me if
[1:01:18] you're laboring a heavy laden i'll take
[1:01:21] that off your shoulders i'll give you my
[1:01:23] yoke and you can just follow my leading
[1:01:26] you can learn of me and let my mind be
[1:01:28] in you and you can understand what it's
[1:01:31] like to be loved to be accepted to be
[1:01:34] under grace and not under the law
[1:01:37] hallelujah
[1:01:39] lord
[1:01:41] hallelujah this only what i learn of you
[1:01:44] paul says to the galatians
[1:01:46] receive ye the spirit by the works of
[1:01:49] the law or by the hearing of faith
[1:01:52] and i ask you shekinah tabernacle and
[1:01:54] whoever's listening received you the
[1:01:56] holy ghost
[1:01:58] by the works of the lord by the hearing
[1:02:00] of faith
[1:02:05] the hallelujah to the son of god living
[1:02:07] inside you to create your edenic
[1:02:09] condition
[1:02:11] to give you a paradise inside to give
[1:02:13] you a ticket a token
[1:02:16] a sure token of your rapture
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:21] are you so foolish paul says to the
[1:02:23] galatians having begun in the spirit are
[1:02:26] you now made perfect by the flesh
[1:02:30] you know there is nothing you can do i
[1:02:32] can do none of us can do
[1:02:34] that will give us any cubit on our
[1:02:36] stature that will give us any um
[1:02:40] you know benefit
[1:02:42] in eternal things of the kingdom
[1:02:44] hallelujah
[1:02:45] all he's asking is that you take his
[1:02:47] yoke lift his yoke upon you
[1:02:49] and let him lead you in his purpose for
[1:02:52] your life so that you can walk in that
[1:02:54] purpose because that's the very essence
[1:02:57] that's the very thing
[1:02:58] that he has called you to do
[1:03:01] and the only way that you can truly
[1:03:03] discover
[1:03:04] that is by being yoked together with him
[1:03:09] amen
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:12] joshua 1 13 it says remember the word
[1:03:14] which moses the servant of the lord
[1:03:16] commanded you saying the lord your god
[1:03:19] has given you rest
[1:03:21] and has given you this land
[1:03:23] you see the believer's rest is tied into
[1:03:25] the promised land israel's rest was
[1:03:27] entering into the land entering into the
[1:03:30] promise and as they entered in here
[1:03:32] comes the captain of the host down into
[1:03:34] the land to take over the battle to lead
[1:03:37] them in the wars and to give them
[1:03:39] everything that was promised by moses
[1:03:41] and joshua and everything that god
[1:03:43] promised abraham that god was there
[1:03:46] the land received god himself under the
[1:03:50] captain of the host to baptize them to
[1:03:53] baptize the land and to bring the land
[1:03:56] into rest
[1:03:57] amen hallelujah
[1:04:02] brother branham says this in adoption
[1:04:05] number two he says god by his election
[1:04:08] grace called you
[1:04:10] god by his election grace sanctified you
[1:04:13] god by his election grace and his power
[1:04:16] i like that
[1:04:18] baptize you and put you into this land
[1:04:20] of rest
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:23] they which they which have entered into
[1:04:25] this rest has ceased from their dying
[1:04:27] astray
[1:04:28] they cease from their works like god did
[1:04:30] from his
[1:04:32] they have
[1:04:33] can you just say they have
[1:04:38] joy unspeakable
[1:04:42] and full of glory
[1:04:44] and full of glory
[1:04:46] now i want you to say
[1:04:48] i have
[1:04:49] i
[1:04:50] am
[1:04:51] joy unspeakable
[1:05:00] hallelujah
[1:05:01] this is what the prophet's saying now i
[1:05:03] want you to own this for yourself he's
[1:05:05] saying that they which have entered into
[1:05:07] this rest
[1:05:08] has ceased from their going astray which
[1:05:11] we read before
[1:05:12] they cease from their works like god did
[1:05:15] from his
[1:05:16] and both times when god ceased there was
[1:05:19] the first adam keeping the garden doing
[1:05:22] the natural things and doing the
[1:05:23] physical stuff on the earth keeping it
[1:05:25] nice keeping it under control and here
[1:05:28] we're called to cease from our works as
[1:05:31] god did from his so that god in the sun
[1:05:34] can come and live inside of us under the
[1:05:37] second adam and under that covenant of
[1:05:39] grace hallelujah
[1:05:42] hallelujah
[1:05:44] he says here so and and here i want you
[1:05:46] to think now
[1:05:48] have i got this and is this me
[1:05:52] have i got this rest that he's talking
[1:05:54] about
[1:05:55] have i got this joy unspeakable that
[1:05:57] he's talking about
[1:05:58] and am i living in this as a consistent
[1:06:01] thing
[1:06:02] i'll have my ups and downs i'll have my
[1:06:03] days
[1:06:04] but as a general in my life if i look at
[1:06:07] my life
[1:06:08] is this a reality and is this a constant
[1:06:11] thing that's going on is this a trend
[1:06:15] for
[1:06:15] for the this is like a layered descend
[1:06:17] word now is the trend of joy in your
[1:06:20] life
[1:06:22] has your life got a trend is it trending
[1:06:24] in you has your land got joy unspeakable
[1:06:27] are you full of glory
[1:06:29] are you having supernatural moments of
[1:06:31] pleasure with the lord
[1:06:35] he said he will give to those that fear
[1:06:36] him a river of joy and pleasure
[1:06:39] this is something that happens when he's
[1:06:41] sovereign
[1:06:42] and i want you to realize that the key
[1:06:44] of david unlocks that privilege for you
[1:06:47] and and it's the government the key
[1:06:50] brother branham says in the church age
[1:06:51] book go read it
[1:06:53] just search key of david and you'll just
[1:06:55] have a glorious time
[1:06:56] to understand the key of david and how
[1:06:59] it's upon his shoulders and the
[1:07:01] government is upon his shoulders and he
[1:07:02] shall be called the prince of peace
[1:07:04] because when you're resting you have
[1:07:06] peace
[1:07:07] hallelujah when you're resting you have
[1:07:09] a wonderful counsellor to cancel all
[1:07:12] your mental troubles
[1:07:13] so you don't have to go and manifest the
[1:07:15] things that's the battles that's going
[1:07:17] on in your mind he begins to work
[1:07:19] through them with you hallelujah you
[1:07:21] begin to get stabilized
[1:07:24] thank you
[1:07:25] mate
[1:07:26] i'm telling you now and we need that
[1:07:30] you can't go without that we're not
[1:07:31] exempt from it we're not exempt from any
[1:07:34] of these battles but i tell you what we
[1:07:36] have diplomatic immunity hallelujah amen
[1:07:39] we have diplomatic immunity we are um
[1:07:42] we're above now don't get me wrong i'm
[1:07:45] not trying to say we're going to be
[1:07:46] anarchists but we are really spiritually
[1:07:49] above the laws of physics and the laws
[1:07:52] of the land and the laws of all these
[1:07:54] things
[1:07:55] because what
[1:07:56] if pharaoh tries to put us under slavery
[1:07:59] by making us bondage to money and
[1:08:02] because we can't afford to live you
[1:08:03] don't have to live like that
[1:08:05] you don't have to have financial
[1:08:06] pressure you can just believe and god
[1:08:09] will provide
[1:08:10] you just work his system
[1:08:13] hallelujah
[1:08:14] and you can't cheat a system you can't
[1:08:16] fraud a system but you can certainly
[1:08:19] work it
[1:08:20] you can certainly be a giving person a
[1:08:22] cheerful giver god loves a cheerful
[1:08:24] giver amen
[1:08:26] and when he begins to see a cheerful
[1:08:28] giver in your life in you
[1:08:30] he begins to bless your life because
[1:08:33] this is the economy of god that that the
[1:08:36] people would give that have and that
[1:08:38] they that have would give and it would
[1:08:41] just begin to
[1:08:42] cycle around and there wouldn't be a in
[1:08:44] inequality it would just be all things
[1:08:47] to all men hallelujah
[1:08:51] that's the kingdom of god
[1:08:53] hallelujah i don't know how i went there
[1:08:55] but there you go
[1:08:57] amen they have
[1:08:59] joy unspeakable
[1:09:02] and full of glory amen
[1:09:04] and if i'm not there now i need to go
[1:09:06] lord
[1:09:07] why am i not there
[1:09:09] why is that i'm down
[1:09:11] why am i flat i've been flat for so long
[1:09:14] what is it
[1:09:15] don't lie to yourself and think don't
[1:09:17] let the devil lie to you
[1:09:19] and say oh that's just you that's just
[1:09:21] your makeup no no your makeup is joy
[1:09:23] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:09:26] hallelujah
[1:09:27] amen you just say that tonight my makeup
[1:09:30] is joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:09:36] that's me
[1:09:37] hallelujah
[1:09:39] i'm not going to settle for anything
[1:09:41] less and if there's something going on
[1:09:43] i'm going to get the mind of christ in
[1:09:45] me and i'm going to go down to the eden
[1:09:47] in my life and i'm gonna meet with the
[1:09:48] son of god inside me and we're gonna
[1:09:50] have fellowship and we're gonna find out
[1:09:52] what's wrong because i've got the
[1:09:53] counsellor inside me i've got the prince
[1:09:56] of peace inside me i've got the
[1:09:57] everlasting father inside me oh
[1:10:00] hallelujah if i need to know how to be a
[1:10:02] daddy i've got the everlasting father to
[1:10:04] do to work in my life to make an e din
[1:10:07] in my life
[1:10:08] hallelujah
[1:10:10] says the lord oh do you know who's
[1:10:12] inside you saints
[1:10:14] hallelujah i just want to remind you
[1:10:17] who's inside you i want to remind you
[1:10:19] what he's able to do amen all he says is
[1:10:22] cease from your works
[1:10:25] cease from your labors
[1:10:27] cease from your own intelligence stop
[1:10:30] yielding to your own ideas and yield to
[1:10:33] me
[1:10:34] because when god came down he dealt with
[1:10:37] the first adam and he had to deal with
[1:10:39] it all but when you come down to your
[1:10:41] troubles in your own heart
[1:10:43] you've got the second adam and he's got
[1:10:45] it all under control and he just wants
[1:10:47] to tell you what to do amen and lead you
[1:10:50] through it
[1:10:51] hallelujah
[1:10:53] and he will use whatever means necessary
[1:10:55] to bring clarity for you that's why it's
[1:10:58] so important that when you're at church
[1:11:00] you're open to the lord to speak
[1:11:02] personally to you
[1:11:04] and never close or put a full stop on
[1:11:07] your troubles
[1:11:08] never put a full stop on your
[1:11:10] personality flaws never put a full stop
[1:11:13] because the wonderful delivering
[1:11:15] counsellor is inside you and he wants to
[1:11:18] change your situation he you see i want
[1:11:21] to talk about trouble in the land for a
[1:11:23] little bit you see here in the promised
[1:11:25] land
[1:11:26] just a little time after they the the
[1:11:29] land had received the captain and here's
[1:11:31] the promised people and they're in the
[1:11:33] land and the land had the the ark of the
[1:11:35] covenant in its position the captain
[1:11:38] leading the way but all of a sudden
[1:11:40] after a bit of time there was a bit of
[1:11:42] trouble in the land just like there's a
[1:11:44] bit of trouble in your land sometimes
[1:11:46] and it came to a point now in the time
[1:11:48] of eli and huffny and finney harrison
[1:11:51] here they had the ark and and they were
[1:11:53] in the land had the captain but they had
[1:11:56] lost access there was trouble in the
[1:11:58] land and they begin to go the wrong way
[1:12:01] and it was time for somebody to come
[1:12:04] down you see what can happen in the land
[1:12:07] is that even though in your own life you
[1:12:10] can be filled with the holy ghost the
[1:12:11] ark of the covenant the baptism of the
[1:12:13] holy ghost in your life and yet there
[1:12:16] can be trouble so much
[1:12:18] that you can
[1:12:19] lose that experience and and begin to
[1:12:21] get down and begin to
[1:12:24] to listen to the wrong voices until
[1:12:26] finally your experience has changed and
[1:12:29] you're going down the wrong path but you
[1:12:31] see now it didn't stay that way let me
[1:12:34] tell you tonight that not long after
[1:12:37] they had lost their experience not long
[1:12:39] after it you see god had made a way back
[1:12:42] he started to trouble the enemy's camp
[1:12:45] he started to cause all those false gods
[1:12:47] and the things that was going on dagon
[1:12:49] broke and he fell down all those idols
[1:12:52] of your past will fall down and worship
[1:12:54] they will have to they will be made to
[1:12:57] break in the presence of god even if
[1:13:00] you're in a bad condition because of the
[1:13:02] ideals of your past
[1:13:04] because of the idols of your here in the
[1:13:07] heritage that has troubled you and has
[1:13:09] brought you now trying to ruin your life
[1:13:11] and trying to tear you down tearing them
[1:13:14] from them you see the lord will cause
[1:13:17] those idols to bow before him
[1:13:19] hallelujah the lord will cause dagon as
[1:13:22] you know in the story when the ark went
[1:13:24] to the philistine camp you see now they
[1:13:27] put it into the temple of dagon and and
[1:13:29] they came in the morning and dagon this
[1:13:32] big concrete flush god was broken and
[1:13:34] bowing before the ark so they were like
[1:13:37] oh what's going on here so they put it
[1:13:39] back up and they were like oh dagon
[1:13:41] we're so sorry and then the next day it
[1:13:43] was even worse for dagon hallelujah so

[1:13:47] some hard times your past may be just
[1:13:50] troubling you so much sometimes let me

[1:13:58] feet he will do it
[1:14:01] you less than that let me tell you rest
[1:14:04] little bride

[1:14:09] you and he will cause those things of
[1:14:12] your past to full breakdown until the
[1:14:15] point where they have to purge it out
[1:14:18] they cannot stand it no longer because
[1:14:20] the presence of god begins to manifest
[1:14:23] in your life and let me tell you that
[1:14:25] not long after this a man a type of
[1:14:28] christ
[1:14:29] in the land david the king begin to
[1:14:32] bring it all back see god is a god of
[1:14:34] restoration and god does a proper
[1:14:37] restoration he doesn't just do a partial
[1:14:40] restoration he does a full restoration
[1:14:42] of body spirit and soul so that you can
[1:14:46] be whole so that you can worship
[1:14:48] according to the dictates of the heart

[1:15:01] only as brother cadre preached to be
[1:15:03] continued amen see god is able to do it
[1:15:07] and all he's saying is cease from your
[1:15:09] works
[1:15:10] hallelujah
[1:15:12] amen rest
[1:15:14] because inside you
[1:15:15] is the son of god and he's the wonderful
[1:15:18] counselor he's the one the mighty
[1:15:21] deliverer
[1:15:22] hallelujah
[1:15:24] i feel like i've run across country
[1:15:28] oh man i haven't had that feeling for a
[1:15:29] while
[1:15:33] i don't know if anyone's ever had a
[1:15:34] stitch from preaching but
[1:15:36] i got one of those
[1:15:39] i guess i'm not moving you know
[1:15:41] i can't move
[1:15:43] i think i move around usually amen
[1:15:46] let me just say that yes israel had a
[1:15:49] hard time
[1:15:50] and and and yes
[1:15:52] if you look at it in the type the
[1:15:54] captain was there he'd been ushered away
[1:15:57] had been pushed out because of their
[1:15:59] behaviors and the way they were but he
[1:16:01] was still dealing he still had samuel
[1:16:03] building up he still had vision it might
[1:16:05] have been not huge in the land at that
[1:16:07] stage but it was there see god cares
[1:16:10] he's not going to let you fall away he's
[1:16:12] not sometimes you get brought right down
[1:16:14] to the very stump
[1:16:16] and and you strip down to nothing
[1:16:20] and you think everything's going wrong
[1:16:22] just like israel they had the captain
[1:16:24] they had the arkhan chalo
[1:16:27] and they had all of the the idea all of
[1:16:30] the things that moses and joshua and yet
[1:16:33] they were brought down to a stump
[1:16:36] they were brought down to nothing and
[1:16:38] this was the land of rest
[1:16:40] and god in his grace even under the
[1:16:43] blood of bulls and goats
[1:16:44] he was not going to leave that land in
[1:16:47] that condition
[1:16:48] he was not going to leave his people
[1:16:50] like that and he's not going to leave
[1:16:52] you in any
[1:16:54] inferior condition or under any complex
[1:16:57] or have the devil have anything over you
[1:17:00] because he's called you to be the head
[1:17:02] and not the tail
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:05] he's called you to be above the devil
[1:17:08] actually he's got the devil to be under
[1:17:10] your feet and that's where he belongs
[1:17:16] they have joy unspeakable and full of
[1:17:19] glory
[1:17:21] says here
[1:17:22] the tree of life
[1:17:24] is blooming in them
[1:17:26] hallelujah praise the lord amen
[1:17:30] that you know i was
[1:17:32] i was just sitting there thinking about
[1:17:34] god resting
[1:17:35] when that whole edenic thing opened up
[1:17:38] to me
[1:17:39] about god's rest and how he had to come
[1:17:41] down and rescue the land
[1:17:43] and cause bring redemption to adam
[1:17:46] and as i was reading i was like wow
[1:17:48] that's amazing because you know we've
[1:17:49] got this eden in our life and then my my
[1:17:52] eyes went straight to that
[1:17:54] the tree of life is blooming in them it
[1:17:56] was just like a confirmation to show
[1:17:58] that there is a blooming tree of life
[1:18:02] within you
[1:18:03] and even
[1:18:04] though it's blooming
[1:18:06] there is still going to be trouble in
[1:18:08] your spirit and trouble in your flesh
[1:18:10] amen but
[1:18:12] the right person is living inside you
[1:18:15] just remember that so rest and as the
[1:18:18] days come on
[1:18:20] god knows what's going to happen and we
[1:18:22] got a a little idea of how things are
[1:18:24] going to pan out right and it's not
[1:18:27] going to be physically speaking very um
[1:18:30] assuring or these the situations are
[1:18:33] going to be very diabolical is the right
[1:18:36] word because the devil is finally
[1:18:38] getting his way he's going to just go
[1:18:40] completely crazy on the earth and it's
[1:18:42] just going to turn different
[1:18:43] but rest
[1:18:45] because he that is in you is greater
[1:18:47] than he that it's in the world amen
[1:18:50] the tree of life is blooming in them
[1:18:52] they have long suffering gentle goodness
[1:18:54] patience
[1:18:56] made of made faith
[1:18:58] meekness gentleness and so forth the
[1:19:01] tree of life is blooming in them because
[1:19:03] their hope is anchored in christ jesus
[1:19:06] the witness of the holy ghost bearing
[1:19:08] record with signs and wonders following
[1:19:11] the believers amen
[1:19:13] now if you find that there is a bit of a
[1:19:16] stop going on then there is a reason
[1:19:19] it's time to just go
[1:19:21] i'm going to punch the screen
[1:19:23] where am i tampering with the evidence
[1:19:26] what have i am i am i trying to inject
[1:19:29] my own ideas into this or
[1:19:31] and have i taken my own family or my own
[1:19:34] life down a certain path that is just
[1:19:36] off from the will of god
[1:19:39] have i reacted in a knee-jerk reaction
[1:19:41] to a situation in an emotional condition
[1:19:44] and i've caused destruction in my family
[1:19:46] or in my life where am i how lord
[1:19:50] remember who's in you remember the
[1:19:52] solution to your troubles right now the
[1:19:54] solution is within you
[1:19:56] the solution is in your heart and there
[1:19:59] is an identity condition in there and
[1:20:00] it's tied to the absolute you cannot be
[1:20:03] broken from that nothing can separate
[1:20:05] you from that love nothing can separate
[1:20:07] you from him
[1:20:10] he's the one that's just waiting for you
[1:20:12] to take the step back and go okay where
[1:20:14] are we at
[1:20:16] lord if i you know it's time to have a
[1:20:18] conference it's time to recalibrate it's
[1:20:20] time to come back to the son of god
[1:20:22] within you and find that grace to bring
[1:20:25] you back in into that step to bring you
[1:20:27] back into harmony with his purpose for
[1:20:29] you
[1:20:30] to bring you back to restore to redeem
[1:20:33] you because he's he cares about you he's
[1:20:35] mindful of you he understands you he
[1:20:38] understands the the weaknesses in you
[1:20:40] that the devil uses against you
[1:20:43] to try and bring you down to try and
[1:20:44] tear you but you see he's the wonderful
[1:20:47] counselor that can heal you and close
[1:20:50] that door so the devil can never touch
[1:20:53] it again
[1:20:56] hey man
[1:20:58] man
[1:20:58] i'm just being real plain
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:02] the holy ghost bearing record with signs
[1:21:04] and wonders following the believers
[1:21:08] hebrews 4 9 and 10 it says there
[1:21:10] remaineth therefore a rest to the people
[1:21:13] of god for he that has entered into his
[1:21:15] rest he also has ceased from his own
[1:21:18] works as god did from his
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:23] hallelujah
[1:21:24] there's a few things that the devil can
[1:21:26] use against us in our humanity
[1:21:29] to pull us
[1:21:30] and to bring us into the flesh bring us
[1:21:33] into a carnal condition and one of those
[1:21:35] things
[1:21:36] is vengefulness
[1:21:41] you see if somebody pushes the right
[1:21:43] button in your life
[1:21:45] and you you get offended in a deep way
[1:21:49] then
[1:21:49] avengefulness will if you don't you know
[1:21:52] you have to be careful this is why the
[1:21:54] spirit of god is truly meek see meekness
[1:21:58] is not letting people get away with sin
[1:22:00] and injustice it's simply not meddling
[1:22:02] with god's divine system
[1:22:06] vengeance is his
[1:22:08] timing is perfected in him
[1:22:11] so why do we need to fight in our own
[1:22:12] strength to resolve a situation like
[1:22:15] that
[1:22:16] when within him as vengeance within him
[1:22:19] and true meekness understands that yes
[1:22:22] there needs to be something done about
[1:22:23] these things but let god do it
[1:22:26] let god unfold the very solution you may
[1:22:29] be part of that solution but it'll be
[1:22:31] the spirit of god leading you through it
[1:22:34] it'll be the inspiration of god's love
[1:22:36] that will push and will do guide you
[1:22:39] and and it will bring fruit for
[1:22:41] repentance it will bring restoration it
[1:22:44] will restore relationships or will
[1:22:46] resolve things in a likely manner
[1:22:48] hallelujah
[1:22:51] amen
[1:22:55] hallelujah
[1:22:56] what's the time now
[1:22:58] i've got just a couple more remarks and
[1:23:00] then we'll close
[1:23:01] a man
[1:23:04] who loves the lord
[1:23:06] hallelujah
[1:23:10] you know in the land
[1:23:12] when there's trouble in the land
[1:23:14] and there is an attribute
[1:23:17] when you read in the old testament and
[1:23:19] you read about the promised land and you
[1:23:20] read about certain stories in that land
[1:23:22] and you can relate to those stories i
[1:23:24] was reading about joab and how joab you
[1:23:28] know he had done a lot of bad things in
[1:23:30] the past who knows who joab is can
[1:23:33] everyone tell me you children does any
[1:23:35] of these young children know who joab is
[1:23:38] hallelujah does anyone know who joab is
[1:23:40] joab is the man
[1:23:43] who
[1:23:44] was the captain of david's host and you
[1:23:46] see he was a man of bravery and he was a
[1:23:48] man that could do great things but in
[1:23:51] that ambition and in joab was also
[1:23:54] a downside to that was that he always
[1:23:56] got himself in trouble and he went and
[1:23:58] did things um that he shouldn't have
[1:24:00] done and you know there was a judgments
[1:24:02] for those things under the blood of
[1:24:04] bulls and goats there was judgments for
[1:24:07] the things that joab had done and so
[1:24:09] um this was joao's past you know he was
[1:24:12] the man that when david was taking
[1:24:14] jerusalem and he was about to be you
[1:24:16] know come into his full kingship and be
[1:24:18] crowned king by all the tribes he'd just
[1:24:20] been crowned and there was unity in
[1:24:22] israel and
[1:24:23] david says whoever goes up to these
[1:24:26] gutters and um let's opens the gates for
[1:24:29] jerusalem
[1:24:31] will be captain
[1:24:32] of the lord of the host you know he'll
[1:24:34] be the captain of the army and and so
[1:24:36] this was joab he was a mighty man of
[1:24:38] valor and yet now here's this man
[1:24:41] under the blood of bulls and goats now i
[1:24:42] just want you to think about that
[1:24:44] under this covenant under this covenant
[1:24:47] of judgment for sin and there wasn't
[1:24:49] grace like there is grace now here he is
[1:24:52] now after all he had done and he had
[1:24:54] killed abner and he had killed other men
[1:24:56] that was not he shouldn't have done
[1:24:58] god's anointed people and and and done
[1:25:01] it unjustly murderous type of things and
[1:25:04] now it came to where he was being
[1:25:07] recompensed for that and you could say
[1:25:09] that we can find ourselves things that
[1:25:12] we've done in the past that we've been
[1:25:14] forgiven for and they're in the sea of
[1:25:16] forgetfulness and yet in the flesh
[1:25:19] yet in the land there's trouble and it's
[1:25:22] chasing you down and it's trying to
[1:25:24] bring you back into something that
[1:25:26] you've been delivered from that's not
[1:25:28] even in the memory of god and yet the
[1:25:30] devil tries it anyway and that's like
[1:25:32] joao he was running when solomon had
[1:25:35] become king and now all the judgments of
[1:25:37] david was being issued unto the son of
[1:25:40] david and here he is now joab he had
[1:25:43] done the wrong thing again and he had
[1:25:45] tried to get one of the other guys to be
[1:25:47] king out of niger and here he is running
[1:25:49] for his life you see his past
[1:25:52] his past was chasing him
[1:25:55] his past was about to destroy him and
[1:25:58] sometimes we find ourselves where our
[1:26:00] past or something from our heritage is
[1:26:03] trying to destroy us but it doesn't have
[1:26:05] a right under the blood of jesus
[1:26:07] hallelujah you have the blood of jesus
[1:26:10] and you you don't have to let your past
[1:26:12] destroy you you there is deliverance for
[1:26:14] you there is healing for you but you see
[1:26:16] job he's running there's trouble in the
[1:26:18] land
[1:26:19] and there's trouble and all of a sudden
[1:26:22] here he's crying on the altar of god and
[1:26:25] he's screaming for mercy or he just
[1:26:28] doesn't want to die and his past caught
[1:26:31] up with him and under that covenant he
[1:26:33] lost his life
[1:26:37] under that covenant he was destroyed but
[1:26:40] let me tell you about another covenant
[1:26:42] that you're under and no matter what the
[1:26:44] devil tries to chase you down with no
[1:26:46] matter what condemnation it will not
[1:26:49] destroy you it will not because there is
[1:26:52] a remedy there is a vaccine a real
[1:26:55] vaccine for you amen there's an
[1:26:58] inoculation amen that will bring you
[1:27:01] back there is a bomb in your billiard

[1:27:07] and there's bomb for you amen there if
[1:27:10] you're blind there's an anointing oil
[1:27:12] for you amen if you can't see if you've
[1:27:15] been clouded over by something of your
[1:27:18] past been chasing you down and it's
[1:27:20] trying to bring you down it's trying to
[1:27:22] tempt you and it's doing all sorts of
[1:27:24] things just remember there's i said for
[1:27:26] you to see there's bomb for you to heal
[1:27:29] hallelujah just take it
[1:27:31] take it i want everyone to say i'm
[1:27:33] taking it
[1:27:34] amen i'm taking it it's mine hallelujah

[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:42] i just think
[1:27:44] under the law job had to die under
[1:27:45] judgment because of his past but under
[1:27:48] grace your judgment has been taken by
[1:27:51] the son of god because i'm preaching him
[1:27:53] crucified among you i'm preaching a
[1:27:55] crucified sacrifice among you who finish
[1:27:58] the work who's who's broken the power of
[1:28:01] sin who's broken the power of your past
[1:28:03] who's broken all the trouble that could
[1:28:06] ever raise up in your land in your home
[1:28:08] in your family in your spirit and in
[1:28:11] your flesh all that has been conquered
[1:28:14] it has been completely and you are
[1:28:17] healed
[1:28:19] and hallelujah all you need to do is say
[1:28:20] it's mine all you need to do is raise up
[1:28:23] defy gravity lift his yoke upon you and
[1:28:25] let him be sovereign let him trust in
[1:28:29] him for your outcome
[1:28:31] trust in him
[1:28:33] to navigate you
[1:28:34] through the uncertain times that we live
[1:28:37] in
[1:28:39] who thinks that god knows what's going
[1:28:40] to happen amen
[1:28:43] god knows what's going to happen
[1:28:45] amen and he's inside you so if the one
[1:28:48] that knows what's going to happen is
[1:28:49] living inside you i feel like you're in
[1:28:51] a really good place
[1:28:53] i believe you're in a real good position
[1:28:56] amen you have the advantage
[1:28:58] we've got the advantage saints
[1:29:00] amen it's unfair hey man you like that
[1:29:04] it's unfair
[1:29:05] we have the unfair advantage in our
[1:29:08] favor
[1:29:09] oh yeah because we've got the one that
[1:29:11] knows everything that's going to happen
[1:29:12] has already healed us from everything
[1:29:14] and has defeated the enemy on every
[1:29:16] front
[1:29:17] oh my i like that that's good odds to me
[1:29:19] who believes that's good odds
[1:29:22] i like that it's rigged it's rigged and
[1:29:25] you've already won oh there even though
[1:29:28] you're called now
[1:29:30] for a character development session
[1:29:32] oh my
[1:29:34] hallelujah
[1:29:35] it's all just for your character or just
[1:29:38] for you to appreciate how much you love
[1:29:40] him amen
[1:29:42] who loves the lord
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:47] glory to his name
[1:29:49] amen final scripture and then we'll
[1:29:52] close
[1:29:53] just uh i just want to tie in
[1:29:56] that when you're when he's sovereign now
[1:29:58] if you if you take one thing from this
[1:30:01] whole thing you've lifted the yoke on
[1:30:04] your on you his yoke
[1:30:06] and you're connected with him by
[1:30:08] marriage and he's leading you and he's
[1:30:10] sovereign and you're completely totally
[1:30:12] trusting him
[1:30:13] and now you've got the key of david
[1:30:15] open heaven to you so you're fully in
[1:30:18] his joy
[1:30:19] um and and this is the access through
[1:30:22] his sovereignty
[1:30:24] this is where full and free access lies
[1:30:27] is when the god that lives in you
[1:30:30] that's not in the question right now for
[1:30:32] the spirit-filled believer it's are you
[1:30:35] completely letting him be sovereign
[1:30:38] and completely submitting to that
[1:30:40] sovereignty and trusting in them
[1:30:42] regardless of what's happening
[1:30:44] completely totally trusting and resting
[1:30:48] in his promise
[1:30:49] resting in his ability
[1:30:52] in his management in his governing he's
[1:30:55] the greatest king he's the greatest
[1:30:57] governor there is no one like him and he
[1:31:00] has got it all under control
[1:31:02] and you see this is where you you
[1:31:05] completely trust in
[1:31:07] no matter what and here you have this
[1:31:10] beautiful
[1:31:11] situation where even though it's crazy
[1:31:15] unvariable and dark all around you have
[1:31:17] a beautiful edenic condition within you
[1:31:21] and it's your inheritance amen and you
[1:31:23] and that there is is what i'm meaning
[1:31:26] here now as we read this
[1:31:29] john 15 7 to 11.
[1:31:34] it says if you abide in me
[1:31:36] and my words abide in you
[1:31:38] you shall ask what you will
[1:31:40] and it shall be done unto you
[1:31:43] herein is my father glorified that you
[1:31:45] bear much fruit
[1:31:48] so shall you be to my disciples as the
[1:31:50] father has loved me so have i loved you
[1:31:54] continue ye in my love
[1:31:57] if you keep my commandments you shall
[1:31:58] abide in my love even as i have kept my
[1:32:01] father's commandments and abide in his
[1:32:03] love
[1:32:04] these things everyone say these things
[1:32:08] have i spoken unto you that my joy
[1:32:12] might remain in you
[1:32:15] and that your joy might be full
[1:32:20] see it's tying together your experience
[1:32:23] of joy in amongst storms and amongst
[1:32:26] everything that's going on
[1:32:29] because believe me right now this is not
[1:32:32] work as bad as it's going to get for
[1:32:34] society for the world and you know
[1:32:37] before we get taken off the earth there
[1:32:39] is going the need for you to rest
[1:32:42] because right now you know you you work
[1:32:44] and you go and you rely on monetary
[1:32:46] system and you've got all these comforts
[1:32:48] of this
[1:32:49] you ain't gonna have that soon
[1:32:51] let me just tell you now it's gonna be
[1:32:52] stripped away and the tree of knowledge
[1:32:55] is going to be stripped away
[1:32:57] and you're going to have no access to it
[1:32:58] for a season before the rapture and it's
[1:33:02] going to be like it was for the church
[1:33:03] when they were hunted down and they were
[1:33:06] under the the full leadership of the
[1:33:08] angel of the lord and they were
[1:33:09] traveling by thought and and they were
[1:33:11] in divine love and then all of a sudden
[1:33:13] the saints of all the past will begin to
[1:33:15] raise up and you'll see them and you'll
[1:33:17] be caught up hallelujah there it's going
[1:33:19] to change and so leading to that is
[1:33:22] going to be a tough time physically
[1:33:24] speaking it's going to be a time where
[1:33:26] you're ready for it because you see the
[1:33:29] one that's living in you it will make
[1:33:30] you ready it actually says that she made
[1:33:33] herself ready how did she do it there
[1:33:35] was trouble in her land and she came
[1:33:37] down to the eden in her own life and had
[1:33:39] fellowship with the son of god that is
[1:33:42] the gardener of her own heart that is
[1:33:44] the one that's keeping her the one
[1:33:46] that's tilling your soil right now
[1:33:48] saints the one that is the husbandman
[1:33:50] that turned a filthy
[1:33:53] dark earth without form and void into a
[1:33:55] beautiful garden
[1:33:56] inside you
[1:33:58] amen
[1:33:59] oh yeah
[1:34:03] that's it god bless you brother ed
