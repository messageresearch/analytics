TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen I trust tonight your eyes have been turned towards the Lord amen and you know as a Christian we believe that you know the Lord is maturing us to a place on him and our our focus is always on him and there's nothing that can steer us from him no circumstances that can take us out of his atmosphere amen and to me that is the the attributes of a mature Christian as someone that can in an atmosphere of perfect love regardless of circumstances amen and this series will actually deal with a lot with why we get taken out of those circumstances and why the things that the devil can use against us to pull us out of the secret place because you see in Psalm 91 the Lord has actually spoken to us that uh promise that he that dwells in the secret place of the most high dwell is to abide to stay to remain in that secret place shall have a multitude of blessing amen hallelujah we'll get into that soon I'll just um just pray Lord Jesus father we just thank you Father we can come before you this evening Lord and and and Lord I just praise you for the opportunity here Lord Jesus to minister about these things father and I believe you've given these things to us Lord Jesus father for

a a life-changing experience for each one of us Lord I'm dependent on you this evening Lord and we're all dependent on you have your way in this place Lord take control of every spirit and father may we receive from your hand this heaving Lord Lord because we're hungry and we're thirsty and we're needy people father and these things is shining a light on our lives Lord and I pray that you would Shine Your Light oh ever so bright shine it upon our lives and let no part of our life remain untouched from the warm embrace of your love oh God order these words father as they come forth I submit

and Lord that you would heal our hearts and that you would shine your light upon every area of our life and live no stone unturned that's what we need father take control of thine unprofitable servant now Lord I yield myself to you in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah thank you musicians amen who's thankful for the musicians amen look at this crew we've got the the master crew on tonight amen a man can you please turn down the there's like a echo on here like um like a Reverb or something it's kind of a little bit funny amen so tonight we're going to just go straight to the scriptures it's a good opportunity here to just open our hearts and let the Lord speak and you know if he if he deals in anything in your life or speaks anything lay it down right where you're at lay it down don't hold on to it cuz the word of God is a light unto our feet a lamp unto our paths we're all on a path tonight and the word is going forth and it can and maybe it will shine some light on something personal I don't know I haven't planned it but the Lord plans it so you know we can just just um be a faithful mailman to the message that the Lord has for his bride well we'll turn to Ephesians 4 verse 21-23 if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind let's just pray one more time lord Jesus add your blessing to the reading of your word and father may this this Vision that you want for us be reality to us Lord may we receive that pearl of great price tonight and may it become so personal to us renovate our spirit of our mind Lord Jesus I commit the service to you Lord in Jesus name amen you may be seated you put off the old man and actually it goes further on in this Ephesians we putting on the new man so these things these these action there's there's Commandments there's application in our lives that the Lord's given to us now how do we do that you know and there's a balance between what God does for us and what his grace does and what his word does and the power that's behind the word that's going to come through every channel in our life and change things but there's an application that God has given us to make to make these things happen because what he wants here he wants to us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind not just the physical mind now the brain but he wants us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind he wants us to be renewed in our subconscious mind he wants our conscious our whole conscious mind and our subconscious mind to be renewed now that word renew for the renewed is it is to renovate to reform you see the spirit need you you you receive a new spirit you receive a new mind and now through the able to fellowship with God and walking with a new spirit and a and a new and a new mind the mind of Christ now he wants to work down deep in your subconscious to renovate the spirit of your mind he wants to to to to take out some of the old things and and and you know maybe a bit tired it's been it's been run down a little bit and things have happened in your life that have caused it to get a bit derilict and maybe you walk in and it's had a it's had some people in there renting it out that weren't very wholesome people or wholesome things going on inside there and not very good music going on inside there and not very good movies going on inside there sitcoms and whatever you you know that sort of stuff you could say some pisky teenagers in a flat you know after they've been in the flat and you own that that flat if you're the landlord and they move out you're going to have to do some renovating because things are going to be a bit there's going to be holes in the walls the the plaster might be falling off in places there's stains all over the carpet it's time to pull all that stuff out and renovate and make it nice again and restore it back to the way it was now that's exactly what God wants to do in your heart that's what God wants to do in your subconscious that's what God wants to do right down deep amen a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks and now down in that heart and this is what gets us into trouble sometimes is if the abundance of your heart which is something that can speak before you can even realize and you'll find yourself and none of us are exempt because we've all got subconscious that need work on and there's things going on inside there that we don't want there and they've been placed there by things that have been outside of our control actually one of the main things that's placed it there is the way we were brought up it's the way our parents brought us up no matter how good their intentions were it was a repeat of the way they were brought up and all the way back and it changes a little bit from parent to parent because they obviously pick up more things as they go along and you picked up more things as you walked along in your life and more things stuck inside there it's a sticky Nature has been spoke about on Sunday it's things stick in there and the way they stick in there is through practice it's through something that causes a big emotion in your life or a trauma in your life and it and and and and and the subconscious it sticks in there and it writes a little program and it will and it's the feelings you were going through at that very moment at that time and it stores them in there and it keeps them there and then when you then sometime down the track when when when when you're going through an experience and the same thing is repeated that same emotions well up it's a sticky nature and the thing is your parents had that sticky nature in them and their subconscious had also an abundance in their heart was was was was all sorts of things that maybe weren't quite good and they brought you up the best that they knew how but the habits and the way that they connected with each other and the way they connected with you and the the way they punish you the way they treated you the way that they spent time with you all those things you were taking note of that on a subconscious level you were actually taking note of all those things and that formed from a very young age in your life formed the very person that you would be and and and and then following from that after that phase of your life closes off because I know what's going on here okay after closes off when you turn about 7 to 8 years old and you start maturing and you start becoming a more of a person and and that that childish toddler phase closes off what happens is your subconscious becomes less sticky but there are still things that are going to stick to you but they're not going to stick to you like they did when you were a child because God's created you in such a way that from the age of 0 to 6 give or take you were a recorder of every human interaction and everything because your subconscious was actually drawing it all in to learn how to be a human to learn how to react to learn how to act so you can imagine an UNH wholesome house that's like completely bad what those children you wonder why their children are so bad out there and it gets worse and worse and worse and worse and until God can get a hold of a generation and bring a generation under a better influence and then the parents correct a little bit but the problem is when Satan has reign in his own Eden and these generation after generation of poor parenting the people the way they are and now unfortunately as we become Christians we have come out of that and and maybe our parents were the ones that became the Christians and they came out of that but traits of that was the way you were brought up and and therefore in your heart is things that make you do things that you get in trouble for or say things that you don't want to say because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and so when you first become a Christian little did we understand or know and we'll get this we're going to go right into this tonight that yes God came in when you got born again God came in but just a little white button size and still there's an abundance of things in there that need to be dealt with there's an abundance of and things in there that as soon as one little thing triggers spews out of your mouth and you don't even recognize and you're like man and you you and your Consciousness oh I better go along with this other I'm going to look real stupid and you do you kind of bat yourself up and then you get yourself further in a hole or you end up in China or whatever you know and we all know about that some of us have got different different temperaments as well so and it depends it's it's all we're all a mixed bag we're a complete mixed bag and so you cannot generalize well we can generalize but we cannot make everyone the same cuz we're all different we've all got different levels of different things but the main thing that we all have is a subconscious and and and out of the abundance of that the mouth will speak and it is a lot faster than your conscious mind a lot faster and it's going to react faster actually when you pick up a newspaper you pick up a newspaper this how fast your subconscious mind is the whole page every little word whatever type six font or whatever it may be your subconscious has read that the moment the light of that Paper Strikes your eyes the whole page everything all the information all the the ideologies everything your subconscious mind knew the whole thing comprehended everything and you didn't even see it but because your subconscious mind did that in a split second that's how fast it is how powerful it is because it did that it might something might have jumped out at you and you're like where was that I saw that word down there it popped into your mind into your mind's eye didn't you didn't physically see it your subconscious saw it and you look through the page oh there and then you're like oh true that's a good story because your subconscious said yes that I can relate to that that's something to do with my life I'm interested in that that's how fast it is but now because that's fast it reacts faster than you and another thing that it does as well to show you what I mean is when there's debris coming at you your eyes 80 90% of of the time close before the debris goes in your eyes because your subconscious mind actually sees it faster a third of a second faster than your conscious mind it's just faster it it functions in a higher um speed so much higher like um you know if anything if you know about computers and I think I mentioned it last week the conscious mind is about 40 bits per second of data but the subconscious mind is about 40 million so it's a super computer like Beyond any supercomputer that man can even dream of making that controls all your bodily functions that controls all the mitosis of all your cells and everything all all going on inside it's doing all of that and it's also processing everything around you and it's creating a three-dimensional image and all the sounds that's processing it all so that you can experience life that's what it's doing and at the same now now why I'm going through the what inspired me to go through the series is and I I don't want to get ahead of myself it was that this is the thing that brother brandom identified that's our biggest enemy not our soul our soul is perfect our soul is sealed if we're sealed our soul is in Dominion but now it's going to have a a hard time being in Dominion if the subconscious is so down and is so tormented by things that haven't been dealt with but I can tell you now God is ready to take over and God God's going to deal with you he's going to deal with that subconscious going to heal everything the light that's shining right now is going to shine and it's going to shine all those things and no stone will be left untuned let me continue on eat thou not the bread of him that has an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty Meats for as he thinks in his heart so is he eat and drink drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee so you see here we talk the the the vision to renovate that heart and to bring you into alignment so that God in your life his influence can come down and it can influence your soul and your soul can actually now take the reins and steer you without going in other directions and all this over the place when something comes in front of you you speaking it bringing you to perfect Faith you have to come to perfect Faith have to and you will it's an inevitable thing that's happening how is that going to [Music] happen by the ministry and of an entrance into the kingdom of God it'll come through the ministry and you will take that word and then you will eat that word and it will become part of your life and you'll apply those things and you will into you'll move into this you will move into perfect Faith by the grace of God and it's not the minister it's the ministry when I say that it's not any man it's God but he takes a gift and when I say Ministry I don't just mean behind the pulpit too because there is a Ministry in every life and each Ministry is going to work together to to to bring that entrance to bring the people above where they're at to lead you to the rock that is higher than you right now next Rock next Rock speak to that rock he's listening he's waiting amen Allelujah as a man thinks in his heart so is he it's the essence of your being session one we're going to deal with diagnosing and placing our subconscious mind Proverbs 4:23 to 27 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the is issues of life out of your heart are the issues of life it's it's where everything comes forth and out of the abundance of that what's coming forth or what's going on inside there are you wanting to go a certain direction and that's taking you another direction are you sitting in a room and you're feeling uneasy and and yet you know you're saved you know that Christ has become king You' you Something's Happened to you but yet there's a turmoil going on or there's something happening that that that frustrates you out of it are the issues of life out of that heart put away from you a frowed mouth and perverse lips put far from you let your eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder the path of your feet let all all your ways be established turn not to the right hand or to the left remove your foot from Evil now these are very simple things in this may be Elementary as Ben says you know it may be very Elementary but just Ponder your path of your feet consider what you're where you in your conscious mind are you allowing God to lead you or are you being led by your flesh or are you being led by your subconscious if you're being led by your subconscious you're in big trouble big trouble if you're being led by your emotions you're in big trouble do not be led by those things that's a feminine Spirit leading you that's a female Spirit leading you it's important to know who's leading you it's important to to to to be very serious about this walk what's going in these eyes of yours is it all the word of God or is there liven going in there is there liven in your homes is there things in your life that are going to continue to hold you down in prison what he's saying here Solomon he's giving instruction a very clear instruction he's saying now look your heart is made a certain way and if continue to allow things into your life and turn this way and be be wishy-washy and be and be tossed this way and tossed that way and all your affections are just mixed up with all this and that and then some of God and then some of this and then some dark movie here and what is going in your eyes what light is going in there how dark is that light that's very serious it's very serious because what goes in must come out and Satan will find any little legal ground to take to stay in your life anything anything doesn't matter he'll find it and if you're if you consent to anything that is not the word of God if that if Satan can use that in any way he will put you back into hell on Earth he can't take your soul but he will make your life a living misery and you'll never have you'll never have success as a Christian you'll just mope around and you'll have highs and lows and you might go to a convention and be all happy and then you leave that convention and because those things you're you're turning to the left here and dabbling here and your affections are all mixed you're going to have problems in your heart and out of your heart those issues of life you going have issues but you see now the light of God is shining on those issues the light of God is shining and bringing conviction and that conviction when it comes don't hold on to those things just let them go seriously because you see when this heart Gets In Tune and in harmony with your soul and with and with in alignment with who you are with who God is and you become a clear conduit of his love a clear conduit of his light you contain God in your affections what you love and what you like what makes you happy what what you what you enjoy is sit on things above because we're leaving this Earth why hold to any uh what are those ball and chain that would keep you on the earth my for out of it are the issues of Life remove your foot from Evil because if you don't remove your foot from Evil how are you going to stand on the serpent if the serpent you're in it and you're doing the things that he's made you know it's not going to be long before we're completely ostracized from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you might as well take your hands off his entertainment now who keeps your heart I just asked that question I won't answer enough now brother brandham he mentions here now it's choosing thoughts to roost and this is quite a cool little um analogy so he says now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then never never ever say that and and and really never think that because you're just if you're not when you say it you're letting the de devil know where you're at he doesn't know he doesn't know where you're at he'll just fire all the stuff at you and make you feel down and all the stuff you just speak positively because he doesn't know that it's affecting you it may be you might be feeling low down rotten as anything but never ever voice that you're you're you're you're you're you're you're taking away your testimony you're speaking his language now the next step is to stop thinking that because you might not testify it out but there's an internal testimony and the more you think those thoughts about yourself the more you speak down about yourself there's somebody downstairs there called the subconscious that eventually goes right that is me and you you just get yourself sunken down lower and lower and lower and lower because you are preaching to yourself when you share a testimony it's mainly for you it's not it's only a little bit for the others and some for the devil but it's mainly for you because that's a power of your testimony you're testifying what the word says about you and what God is doing in your life and what that is doing is something down here which learns by repetition and practice the old subconscious learns by repetition and practice as you share those testimonies over and over and as your thoughts become positive down here starts to become positive it doesn't happen overnight it doesn't happen in one session it doesn't happen in one church service though God can bypass all those things and change something when he really sees that you need that because you're in such a place you can't get out he'll do it but in the general he wants you he's written in his Bible the whole practice of a Christian the out working life of a Christian is a positive Christian is positivity it's never letting corrupt things things come out of your mouth about others and especially about yourself because the more corrupt things you say and think about yourself you start to believe that and it's a lie an absolute lie of the devil and it's speaking his language and you might as well be swearing and cursing because that's exactly what it is you're cursing yourself and the subconscious has got no logical thinking it doesn't figure out stuff it just listens to what you say it listens to the thoughts that go down down and all time change that way of thinking that's a complete next part of the series but it's good to put that there because it's so important so important when the Lord show me those things I was amazed that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking the devil's language right n see you mustn't never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time now that doesn't mean okay now we want to balance this that doesn't mean that if you're sick you pretend you're not sick and say no I'm not sick I don't have this you do it's a it's a fact that whatever you've got you've got but your testimony isn't that your testimony is I may be this but God has done this for me in God's word he's healed Me by his stripes I am healed and maybe you're feeling down and someone ask you how you feeling and they're close to you and say I'm not feeling very well but God is my joy and his strength his Joy is my strength and I'm going to praise Him amen that's your testimony you don't have to lie and pretend that you're not something if you are that David didn't lie man you should see the start of a many of a some oh I'm so broken and I'm crushed down like a rose all those things but he doesn't stop there he doesn't leave it in the negative he says but God rich in Mercy amen he's my buckler my shield my strong and mighty tower he he rescues me he makes a a table in the presence of my enemies always be clear on what your testimony is hallelujah it's a positive life I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it sometimes the Lord can allow a great trial to come and don't beat yourself up if you find yourself in a great trial there's something happening God has allowed that there's something going on it needs to be there may be something hiding down deep and it might take a big Valley in your life to to find it might be buried down right down down down and some of those things it takes some pain it takes some failure to crush some pride or to root out something that's causing you to want to watch those things or listen to those things or practice those things or not practice you know restrictions so never in a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that will be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you that's powerful God can only bless you as you confess as it comes out of your mouth from the abundance of your heart coming out not just an empty thought but you it's reality you're confessing that why because there the very Dove is living in your heart so if the Dove's living in your heart and he's growing every day and he's pushing all that stuff away and he's and he and he's busting the Shu and all the old Shu and husks and things are going because there's a power there's a resurrection inside you amen confess that you're not confessing some external thing from around you you're confessing something that's already in you all of of it it's all there God can only bless you as he confess that as he had done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he said he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it amen that's right okay this is a medical View and this is just going to this is like a a general overview of the subconscious and this is amazing because these guys are only really recently discovering this stuff and I said that last time as well but and this is different as well but it's not I'm not reading the same thing brother brandham everything you read here brother brandham just speaks it out in the 50s you know he's more advanced you know like we we we have a message that's more advanced than all the medical stuff but I'm only s I'm only reading this to you because I want to show you that I want to show you that the the tool the the the the the message you have in your heart and in your hand hands that sword is an advanced weapon that sword that came out of a prophet's mouth spread out over all the messages and gathered together under inspiration and ministered and you having your Bible studies and things it's more advanced and the news in there is more later than the news and the papers but it takes Eagles to gather the fresh meat and take that meat and chew it up and live it become one with that amen that's all in there that's all in there in order to understand how the subconscious and conscious minds work together as a team to create your reality remember this is medical too so they don't understand spiritual stuff and the soul and everything so just bear with me let me again use an analogy your subconscious mind is like a deep fertile soil that accepts any seed that you plant within it I repeat that any seed and I'm only I I read through this it is all right you know that you plant within it you decide what seed's going to land right it's going to fly over and you're going to plant something and you better make sure you don't plant all those negative things but you tell that devil where to go amen you resist the devil he will flee from you and submit to God it's like deep fertile soil that accepts any seed you plant within it your habitual thoughts and beliefs other seeds habitual thoughts now you might think a couple of things and then let it fly but you keep thinking along a certain line you just keep doing that eventually it's be it's going to get ingrained in you eventually down here is going to register it yes actually he's thought this enough she's thought this enough I'm going to make this a value in my life I'm going to make this a belief it's going to Anchor something and it's going to become and it's going to go through your brain and it's going to create neural Pathways in your brain and it's going to be very easy to think that it's it's going to be very hard to stop that but God's given us a way out of all of these things he said you can tear down strongholds he's given you a power a dunamis mighty through God pulling down strongholds and casting down imaginations and all those things that would exalt itself against Jesus Christ so it's time now to be a diligent Gardener of your mind that are constantly beliefs are the seeds that are being constantly swn within and they produce in your life what is swn just as surely as corn kernels produce corn and wheat seeds produce wheat your thoughts will have an effect in your life you will reap what you sow this is a law the conscious mind is like the gardener so up here the gardener now remember we as a Christian we take it even further now there's something above the conscious mind that's you your soul and God above that and we're going to get into this in it's might be a good Revelation for some maybe some probably already know but you're going to like it or I did anyway so the conscious mind is like the gardener it is your responsibility to be aware of how this process works and to Choose Wisely what reaches the inner Garden unfortunately for most of us our role as Gardener has never been explained to us now we as Christians know better than that don't we we know that we have a role you know don't let these thoughts come in and we we manage the garden and you see a weed growing and you see something it'll start to make you bitter if it's a negative weed it'll start to bring you down if it's a negative weed it it'll start to affect you negatively as soon as you recognize that there's something taking root now it's time to deal with that it's time to sit before the Lord it's time to get into fellowship with someone you love and trust and I'm thankful that we have a church where we all love and trust each other amen we can just share these things and talk to each other sometimes it's too hard to do it by yourself even though your relationship with God might be awesome it's always good to talk and confess your faults one to another and sit and fellowship and talk about it because they God might speak through them just and and something might happen and you might get free from whatever that is that's hiding down in there that's taking root and causing bitterness or whatever it may be causing it's just he's a troubl maker those weeds grow like you know they're just so easy to grow you don't have to do anything they just grow in the garden you know but those good plants you got to nurture them you know and it's it's just the law you know that's cursed Earth and this Earth here you know it just seems to like weeds a lot and it and and they grow very easy like it said in there there's a very rich fertile soil this mind and and and you we all know the greatest battle ever fought is in the mine and that's the Battleground that Satan and God have both chosen as a place to Warfare rage War unfortunately for for most of us as our Roller Garden has never been explained to us and in misunderstanding this role we have allowed seeds of all types both good and bad to enter the inner Garden of our subconscious the subconscious will not discriminate judge or censor that's very important there and that's why it get that's why it's it becomes a very big problem in our lives is because of whatever you up here yes you can judge and censor and discern yet that's why you should because if you keep thinking negative thoughts that subconscious mind ain't going to go oh stop thinking that it just starts to believe it's like a servant to you and it'll if you keep thinking those things it'll just it'll actually won't censor it it'll just go down there and it'll form a negative opposition it'll form like an opposite political party inside you and and then really you know with a ship analogy that crew cuz up here the captain of the boat you know the conscious mind stearing it in a certain way and you get excited in the church service you get excited by the preaching or you get excited by something then you're like yes I'm going to apply that I'm going to do it but downstairs there a different story the old crew there has been poorly trained for so many years that it says no I'm not doing that that's scary I'm not going to go out there you know what happened last time you did that you know what happened when when you went out there and they looked at you like this and no way you're not going up the front you wouldn't get down on your knees no way and you get all of these feelings like oh I couldn't do that or something you know there's all sorts of we all go through these things it will manif so the subconscious will not discriminate judge or sensor it will manifest success abundance and health just as easy as failure ill health and Misfortune it works to reproduce in our life according to the seeds we have nurtured within your subconscious accepts what is impressed upon it with feeling and repetition whether these thoughts are positive or negative it does not evaluate things like your conscious mind does and I recalling the analogy before because I was going to talk about the ship that crew needs to be retrained the crew down in the bows that actually controlling this that's doing all of these things and making you feel a certain way it needs to be retrained amen the subconscious mind does not discriminate when it comes to thoughts and feelings it responds to fearful thoughts as well as Loving Thoughts the subconscious response to every desire and imaginative thought we choose to entertain now this is now going back to what brother brandham was talking about so you can see that the message we've received is is is 50 years more advanced than what they're just discovering because these things is new to psychology they didn't teach these things they just used to electrocute people and give people pills and they still give people pills and probably do that as well but they've discovered a lot of things here and they're discovering that you don't just use 10% of your brain you there's a whole lot more you know it's like when when when Evolution was concocted In Darwin's books he thought that the cell was just a round thing or soup inside it but there was an advancement of technology and they realize that there's a whole ecosystem of like all these things inside the cell it's like a it's like a it's like a city it's seriously it's like a city inside each cell and every cell contains the very information of Who You Are oh my but the subconscious now recreates that and divides that that's amazing the subconscious responds to every desire and imaginative thought okay so achieving and maintaining some degree of awareness of our thoughts since the subconscious hears every thought and responds accordingly is a certainly a skill worth having and honing our subconscious mind is our friend and is always there for us and never judges any of our thoughts feelings or actions remember our subconscious is the non-critical non-analytical iCal aspect of our mind though we often judge ourselves with our conscious mind according to the belief systems we have created for ourselves as our good friend and Ally our subconscious mind is also extraordinarily protective of us it will repress painful memories until we are ready and willing to heal them and I'm sure that each one of us have been through Council sessions and being through times in church and being through times in our prayer life where God has brought things to the surface and it's been painful and you've felt the very feelings and pain that you felt at the time where you went through a traumatic experience or whatever happened to you and it's down there and you don't even know it's there until finally God just shines his light on it and maybe God shines his light on things in your life and he can deal with them tonight he can deal with them now he can deal with them right in your seat by one simple prayer he can whether he chooses to or whether that's the way it's going to happen for you it's up to you and the Lord and your faith in his promises because no matter who you are bride of Christ you still have to have faith in the word of God you still have to have faith in the word you cannot expect God to just do all these things for you without you believing it without you taking his word seriously and acting upon his word and believing his word and living his word there's he doesn't just want you to live his word so you're just the correct person There's an actual change that happens because it's a practice that's going to retrain the crew downstairs it's going to retrain those people that are driving your ship and and eventually by the practice and by you getting excited in the service and not just sitting like a cardboard cut out but actually being having feelings towards God and maybe there's something that's stopping the feelings towards God and maybe he wants to shine his light upon those things so that you can have a clear channel of relationship with him amen oh there's so many things and it goes beyond and I'm not even going to start to think that I have every answer to all these things because I don't and I'm not even there yet but I'm on my way amen hallelujah we're all on a journey it just happens to be that the Lord allowed me to access these things a little bit but I I'm not preaching from a point where I've completely ought all this stuff I'm just on my journey just like you and everyone else amen hallelujah right so I've drawn some diagrams and these took a lot of thought uh trust me a lot it's it's not you get something in your mind and and to get it out it can be a different story but it's out thank the Lord so here is a diagram right now this is the flesh obviously now this re please don't think that this is just exactly perfect or whatever or what it's meant to look like I don't know but this is how the the Revelation that the Lord's given me on this this is just how I've drawn it so I don't know exactly how this is the best way to draw it but I couldn't think of anything better so here and and your subconscious mind is not a triangle by the way I don't know what shape it is it probably doesn't have a shape because it's a spirit but I've just given it a shape because I just wanted to place it so that we could have some teaching so here we got the heart and I want to start with the this is a child of God before Christ I'm not going to deal with people that aren't children of God or whatever but I'm dealing with two this is a child of God BC and AD because this is what I'm talking to or who I'm talking to so here we have the heart now the heart the Bible says the heart is deep beyond all things and who can know it you know it's just it's be it's beyond comprehension because now the reason why is because here your your heart is comprised of your subconscious mind which as we already have gone through it does a lot of things but it's also home to your soul and your heart and within your soul before Christ is a little predestinated seed but you see there's a snake inside here too now this is that old nature this is that old God of this world that is is born you're born in sin shaped in iniquity and you come to this world speaking lies you come in this world and you're born and there brother brandom said there's a snake inside your heart and that snake is what makes you snaky and makes you who why you went and did all those things and whatever that happened but and and but inside there is also a predestined seed it was was waiting for the day of its new birth and it's a seed laying under muck and dirt like Reverend Mr Lily are down in the muck of the pond and there's a bit of toiling that happens before he comes up to show right but I'm so thankful that the light of God to Quicken that seed can shine down through the water and down through the mck and mire all this this is the mukan mire the clay and penetrate the soil and it can also this is the Glorious thing cuz God starts to work within right he can penetrate Roman tombstones and walls of Jericho and all those things that can concrete over the believer and he can penetrate it all to get to that seed because he's going to start from within the Enemy Lines amen and what he does is he comes in and he kicks that snake out the conscious mind I've got the conscious mind here represented as a tri the red part here now think of the subconscious and the conscious mind as like an iceberg the conscious mind is about 5% of your spirit 5% of you of your of your of who you are 5% and that's the bit that's that's like the the um the interface of you that's what people know you is it's what people see you as and it's influenced by a few different things it's you you you as a conscious person the thing when you're speaking when you're doing stuff the captain of the ship is influenced it's influenced by a whole it's influenced by a myriad of things it's influenced by if you're not born again by this snake it's influenced by this flesh and what comes in from all of the senses and it's definitely influenced by this subconscious and you can see I've got it wrapped around there just a little bit and there's a purpose for that I'm going to talk about it soon why that subconscious is wrapped around and this poor conscious mine here is basically your interface it's 5% so day-to-day life you doing this and doing that and everything like that you is only 5% there's 95% of your daily activities and things that's happening around you that's run by your subconscious and if that's got problems and issues then you've got problems and issues and you got troubles and and God's got a he's going to be busy and is busy on all of us thank the Lord that he's busy amen he's got nail scarred hands he's so busy hallelujah amen he's made provision for everything am to free us from all these things so don't be overbear and overburdened by it all because you are inevitably getting healed and all you need to do is ask that's all you need to do it's not this big complicated thing it's just simple but it's you've got to be willing to let God deal with these things you've got got to be willing to go come to counsel and I don't mean I'm not like saying go and see Ben and counsel and whatever if you feel on your heart to do that do that you know sometimes you need to do that or you need to confide in somebody sister brother whatever and have fellowship and talk about these things because you see as you talk about these things the inspiration and iron sharpeneth iron and and and and and things can happen and God can deal amen hallelujah don't hold on to things the conscious mind the Reigns of the person in the hands of the snake filled heart and influenced by the human flesh and the sick subconscious so I've got this as a sick subconscious because it is sick and was sick it's not won't remain sick but it's getting healed it's getting renovated like we read in the beginning it says to be renovated in the spirit of your mind amen now and and I please just don't be overburdened by all of this information you can watch this again and study it I I I I do encourage you to get this and look it over and pray about it and ask God to show you because I'm just going to preach it out but please listen to it again because there is a lot of information here and it's taken me a long time to bring it all into a simple format then you got the flesh the flesh itself this is influenced by the sick subconscious because remember the subconscious has all it produces all the feelings and so this flesh is if your subconscious is sick and it's not in a good shape then and you're going to have physical emotions arai you're going to have emotions that happen and depressions and and overe excitement about things that you shouldn't maybe lustful stuff that that that something's been down in you or affections and you like something that God doesn't like it's going to affect this flesh you're going to physically feel like taking that thing or having that or consuming this that you don't meant to because down in that subconscious there is a it's drawing comfort from whatever those things are because there needs to be a renovation because there's a crew down there in the ship that is a little bit not compliant but you see he will be compliant but you need to retrain them by your thoughts by your confession by what you're saying and by what you're doing because you have a choice you choose what you expose yourself to amen and if you find it's too hard to stop something or or or you know you find it too hard what the reason that is is because the black dog's stronger there's two dogs inside every person no matter what their condition is now you can choose which one you feed and the more you feed the black one he's going to get stronger the more you feed the white one he's going to get stronger so maybe you're struggling with certain things and you want to get Deliverance but you're finding it too hard what you need to do is make a conscious decision by the captain here to start feeding more on the word and maybe you find it hard to read the word listen put it on during the day maybe you need to listen to more sermons just put them on your I phone or iPod get it in your sensors get it in your ears and get it in your eyes you can make that decision and it can feed that white dog and maybe you might not be able to stop feeding the black dog but at least you're feeding the white dog and as you're feeding the white dog he's going to come and eat that guy amen and and things are going to change and you'll start to find it easier now this is a very practical application because I myself had this very similar situation I was stuck on all sorts of substances and everything and I something the Lord just reminded me of that very thing about feeding the white dog and so I was still doing those things but I started listening to sermons and I only listened to it quietly because I just couldn't bear to hear what he was saying but it actually fed my subconscious it started feeding my spirit and that white dog got strong enough till I could actually became an overthrow of government there became an overthrow and the the balance of power was tipped and then it became easier to throw those things off because my mind started becoming clearer so maybe you're in a situation where you're struggling to give something up or whatever it may be but it's time to just make that conscious decision from the captain's Bridge or whatever you call it to start feeding the white dog and and and provide make provision for the Lord make provision and give him something to work with amen and then you'll be able to give that thing up because there will be an overthrow and the balance of power will be tipped so the flesh itself is influenced by the Sick subconscious and the negative neural Pathways sorry this is a lot of information but please the flesh leading most unconverted humans today so most unconverted humans are led by this they're led by this Hollywood Babylonian television God of Satan that's not the god of Satan but anyway you know what I mean so and and all that stuff is going in and they're led by feelings and then it's just this big cycle cuz the subconscious is so filthy and so hurt and so pain and so they just take all these things and do all these things to make themselves comfortable because they don't have the comforter but a born again person hello everybody is actually got a comforter and he wants to be your comforter of every area of your life and it's time you started confessing that it's time you started confessing that he is the source of all your comfort it's time to start singing thou the spring of all my comfort more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee whom in heaven but thee that's a confession that confess it untils down here the crew believes it and starts going maybe Jesus is my comforter maybe he is and because upstairs they keep talking about it the captain's orders keep coming down all the time he is our comforter he's the source of all my comfort my affections are set on things above amen man we're never going to get through this I'm going to be very well behaved now please please be only 8:20 oh man oh dear okay I'm going to go about 9:15 is that is that okay okay cool sorry I know it's going to run a little bit later but I have to get through this otherwise we ain't going to we have to CU there's a conclusion but I I promise I'll just read I'll only preach a little bit the physical mind now so now you've got the conscious mind now this is the spirit of your mind right this is not a physical part of you but it controls a lot of you and it's a spiritual part of your mind but there is a physical mind now this is your brain and it's it's a very powerful instrument and it's so amazing and it's part of you now the physical mind under the leadership of evil remember before Christ under the leadership of evil thousands of rutted neural Pathways the thoughts that go through your mind all the time it starts to forge physical Pathways in your mind and it becomes very easy it's like going down a bush track and there's ruts in the road and the car just goes that way right it just goes in there it falls in there you got to if you if you got to fight to stay out of them you know if you want to get traction on the dry stuff well that's like that kind of in your mind the more you think a certain thing the more you testify a certain thing it starts to form a plasticity that's called neuroplasticity and it's actually a medical term that the more you think a certain way that starts to form and Forge these physical Pathways or electrical Pathways in your mind and it starts to bridge these things together and you it becomes a belief it becomes a value and it becomes an efficient way of thinking for you whether positive or negative now unfortunately because of people in the world and the whole influence of everything you know these neural pathways are detrimental habits and complexes which govern the human mind the subconscious mind now this guy here this forms about 95% of the human spirit and it's generally laying sick the the unconverted soul laying under the rule of the sick human Spirit and the flesh what a place to be in trampled down that soul and Satan he somehow he I'm sure and I it's just me I'm sure he knows the ones that have the seed because I I just I just have this it's an inference from an inference from that lady that knew brother Bram was had a gift right they could see and if she just a human with a demon spirit in her I'm sure the devil sees gifts in our life I'm sure the devil knows that there's something special about you before you were and so what did he do and I know he did it to me and allly can also Express he tries to destroy and he tries to take you down a life that you that you shouldn't go down and and I I had many times where I could have died many times and I'm sure you could all testify of times where you thought the devil's tried to destroy me many many times and but he couldn't because there was that inside me the predestined seed but it was that the soul of mine was laying under the was being crushed under the flesh crushed under the human spirit all the feelings and emotions and all of the the things of this world and and all of the the waves and of fessions and lust and all these things going on just a complete unstable thing but the soul was being crushed underfoot but that wasn't the end of the story because when a child of God is born again that predestined seed becomes quickened and that the dove flies into the heart and God takes up a bod in you and quickens that light penetrated the soil and Quicken that seed and that seed starts to grow grow as you feed at the word of God as you walk in the light and as you as the rain and the light comes upon it it starts to grow and the headship of God takes place and that Soul takes Dominion Hallelujah takes complete Dominion in your life and it starts now I've got this drawn as in a utopic condition because this is where we're heading this is where we're going see there's no blackness in there there's no darkness in there because this is the when God takes headship when the soul gets Dominion Hallelujah and the word of God takes the place in your life Hallelujah and the the captain now gets a you know he becomes an ambassador for the dove comes becomes an ambassador for heaven now he's got power behind him now that captain in the ship's got power behind him and he's being influenced by a greater power because this power has come into your life to give you dominion over your spirit to give you dominion over your conscious mind and over your subconscious and definitely over your flesh until finally as it says he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal body so this physical mortal body that's cursed can actually be completely quickened by the glory that excelth that comes out and it starts to expand in your life and starts to drive out every little trait and heal your heart from within now it's time you started testifying of that it's time you started speaking of that and thinking of that and making positive testimony of these things in your life and what the word says about you you just say that you're not lying you're not lying it's the truth even though you might not feel like it's the truth even though it might seem absolutely unlogical there's a different logic that's come down from heaven and that's Heavenly logic that's Bible logic that logic is more logic than the logic you learn in the school that's Satan's logic in there that says this and then this and cause and effect they're only basing that on their limited P brain experience man it's all wrong well some of it's right because it's basic but a lot of it just wrong and you know it's been so ingrained in US Satan used us because used that because he got us in school and he taught us all these things for so many years and you start to think and then because it just starts to you you cast down reasoning you cast down those things all those thoughts and logicos logic because you see there's a Heavenly logic coming in here and he's now taken your soul into dominion and placed you above your spirit and your flesh to make a happy home this happy home and so now here this subconscious here becomes a happy spirit that can keep the house tidy can put a good atmosphere in the house can clean the house can can produce good chemicals in every circumstance so that you can sit in any situation and you're content you have peace your body feels happy because your spirit's happy and she is ordained to keep your house amen she is the wife in your life whether you're male or female you have a keeper of your house and she's keeping that body amen the flesh body I'm going to just read these things now the flesh body is now governed by the positive subconscious which is undergoing complete renovation remember being renewed so here has come the new management and he's now quickened your soul and now he's starting to clean all the stuff out out and throw all these things back into balance over time it won't happen all at once but little by little will I deliver your out your enemies into your hands and I will drive out the jebusites and the Hittites and the habites and the ibites and the cadit I'll drive them all out little by little turn not to the left or to the right just keep walking with me and confessing the word acting upon the truth confessing the truth that is already with in you because he's already within you he's not somewhere far off he's right here and he's speaking out and that becomes the abundance of your heart which is undergoing complete renovation now coming into chemical balance your body now your body why is your body coming into chemical balance why is it producing the right hormones all the time and the right things at the right time because you've got a healthy Spirit the one that does all the chemical stuff and and all of the everything inside you physically she's happy because there's better Management in there amen your Soul's meant to be at headship in the home but always under the headship of Christ it's like a normal house and we' got some diagrams coming I'm really looking forward to those diagrams and I put them last because I know that after all of this you get tired and it's a visual stuff's easier so so it says here now coming into chemical balance and being well-kept by The Keeper of the house the Healthy Mind and Spirit the physical mind under the leadership of God who is renovating the neural Pathways in your mind the intellect that influences the Mind through feelings and habits the subconscious mind comes under the training of God conscious leadership because now this conscious mind up here has got a bitter influence she he's influenced by the the Dove and now the chemicals are right so you're feeling good the conscious mind is the the emotions are coming into balance and now that you it becomes a a god conscious leadership the captain of the ship's got better navigation control better navigation systems better Radars in the in the bridge and all those things I'm sure we could get brother Chris here to give some analogies of those things or but I don't know but there's a lot of things that's in the ship you know and and and it's better to have an upgrade you know back before the Lord comes in and before he started renovating you know maybe it was just one of those Wheels with all the things on it the old pirate wheels and they flick them and it just turns and that's about it in the ship but now you know the Lord's coming and he's put an advancement so you can see further and you can produce better and you can have a better godc conscious leadership in your life the converted Soul placed in dominion over the spirit and flesh under the headship of God and the dove symbolizes God Of Heaven which flew into our heart when we were sealed in aren't you so glad he flew into your heart aren't you so glad that he's performing a great renovation in your spirit amen aren't you so glad he gave your soul put it into its position and placed it in the shakina glory presence so that you so that that you know when Aaron's Rod was placed into the shikina glory you know it turned from a dry dead old stick and overnight it became a fruitful tree that had armonds on it amen so now your soul is living in that presence Hallelujah but you see now it's not enough it wants there has to be a an overthrow now and a renovation of the spirit and the quickening of the flesh this Mortal body Mortal Mortal now not Immortal body the quickening of the Mortal body it's got to come into a place where it's completely subject and the glory that is the shakina that's already your soul is in comes out and it becomes you and you start to dwell in a realm of perfect faith and you become a Mystic to people around you you become fearless and unconscious of all circumstances and you not moved one bit one slight iot Hallelujah by anything that happens only what the captain gives you directions for I want to ask you something how many in here ever you know you got a subconscious don't you we are conscious of that that's the fellow that subconscious causing you all the trouble tonight it don't agree with this one out here the conscious mind it's scared and backs up but when it becomes in harmony with this one and this one becomes in harmony with God's word you're going then you're moving in a Direction that's under that the dove Direction the dove leading the eagle I don't know if you've heard brother Brown talk about that but the dove the Heavenly Dove leading the eagle you're an eaglet amen the dove led the eagle brother brandom now the dove is leading you Hallelujah as it all comes into harmony so where the dove leads you will go but if the if there's a if there's a realm in your life that's not in harmony the dove leads and then it's got to battle again and then the dove leades that way and it's got to battle again and you so he what he does is he just deals with those things deals with everything in your life just ask him Lord deal with this deal with me heal my heart let no stone be unturned I lay it all out to you heal me take away the desire for to the things of this world it I after through the oh no I'm just going to go past this the murmurs in the wilderness man I just don't have time to preach any of day no I think I'll pick this up next time but basically fear cripples Faith so in your subconscious is all these different things and memories and stuff so what Satan does when a promise comes your way God wants to give you something something Satan will come around behind and give you fear and make you feel like you can't have it because you're not good enough or you've not performed enough or you've you've done all the sin and you've done wrong but God's not looking at those things God God wants you to take him at his word and enter your land and go forward and claim it regardless of circumstances regardless of how you feel regardless of your performance claim the word speak the word live the word act it out and see it become flesh in your life amen don't let fear because the moment fear comes into your life it cripples your faith and then the Devil comes in and he starts to twist you around in thoughts and make you think all of these things and by the time you've just completely lost the vision and you know worry causes Amnesia and you forget who you are and you spend two or three weeks in a in a clouded State and you don't even know who you are but recognize who you are speak the word because it's the truth and it's within you we'll go through that later man this is real good but I'm going to do it next time I was so looking forward to this but I'll go straight are you really leading your spirit or is your spirit leading you Romans 6 likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin let not sin you have a choice because you've got Dominion you have a choice let not sin unbelief all those thoughts everything all the stuff that comes and makes you feel like you've you lost your faith and lost identity and all those things let it not rain in your mortal body it will try there will be an uprising there will be many uprisings there will be many coups that happen to try and overthrow the the power in your life let it not you've got authority over it you just be led by the dove amen I'm so thankful for this cold air man it's good I'm sorry if you guys are hot but I'd be more hot if I didn't have this neither yield your members oh let not sin therefore reain in your mortal body to that you should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace Hallelujah the grace of God the enabling power of God to come behind every testimony that you testify and every thought of the word that you think to to blast the devil out to take whatever right hand that he's got in your life and give him God's right hand Amen to punch him down and kick him down and stomp on him amen because you've got to stomp on the neck of your enemy amen that is by faith now don't let those things and now we're going to go right into those things next time about fear because that will Faith it's a it's a very basic thing but fear cripples Faith you've got to overcome the things in your life well God will do it for you and help you that are causing fear and fear is you could someone could tell you a promise healing right there's something that you got a sickness and it could be bad and then and when healing and then the promise of healing comes and then there's a thought down deep maybe it's not for me that's fear you're feared because something's crippled the faith you might not know what it is but God knows and he can put the light on it you've just got to let him and you've got to have that Fellowship you've got to come under his shakina and his light The Keeper of the house I I won't go into this I'll go straight to so this is a Biblical household I won't read that because you guys know that so well but it's Ephesians 5:22 to2 just read it when you're when you're at home if you can um it's about why it's the it's the relationship in the home but here you have the thoughts of God and the flow of God's love and many other things I just chose those to for the purpose of this and you've got your home right uh a normal house with a with Jesus as the head of the home and and now funneling through Jesus comes the very love of God comes the thoughts of God the word of God the will of God the purpose of God the plan the power and it comes into the husband and he's a funnel and he funnels that you know and his channels become clean and he starts to submit to God and he becomes um um a benevolent leader and he becomes transparent and sincere he starts to represent his origin Hallelujah and that origin is God's love and his thoughts and it comes through there and it comes down into the wife and she becomes happy because you see this is the flow this is the way God's designed it and it comes down and it flows into the home and the home is clean sincere it's got a good atmosphere it's healthy it's balanced it's Godly and the children are affected by this amen there is a clear representation of above now when these things in problems in this and this you know it's it becomes what comes out of here can be slightly different than what's up here and unfortunately for us that has happened many times and hopefully and I'm so thankful that we don't have to repeat that because we're hearing it now let's change let's let God deal with it and let's not administer this message like our parents brought us up okay let's administer this message by the way God the love of God and the thoughts of God amen God's come to take over amen what was preached about for so many years has become flesh the very mind of Christ is here why because he's come to take over he's taken over this place amen I love that it's powerful I won't preach now I'm likingness to the body biblical leadership in the body which is also a house that doesn't need need to have that house on there this is your house and it's exactly the same true identity the thoughts of God healing the flow of God's love Revelation coming through Jesus Christ into the soul to the spirit when I say through it it's from Jesus Christ okay so don't think that there's something more or it's just that I've drawn it this way because it's like you know the Eternal God and all of who he is is pour into Christ and everything that was pour into Christ is pour into the church CH so that's why I've drawn it like that but he is the source as well of course so and then through Jesus Christ into the soul you that's you you've been given Dominion in your home you've been raised to the head of your home he's the head over you but you become the head and now your spirit comes under benevolent leadership real leadership you become really sincere lay your life what is sincerity sincerity isn't just just acting good being like serious sincerity is representing your origin a true representation of who you are how do you get there death to self die to yourself and all your opinions and all the opinions of everyone else that's contrary and just be a clear representation of your origin of your father and then what will happen you know you just become you lay it all out and then the very flow of God comes into your spirit and she starts to get dealt with and she starts to produce healthy emotions become a clean body a sincere body Atmos a good atmosphere in the body produced by chemicals produced by good emotions and good chemicals and it's all balanced because the creator of the body is living in the body amen the creator of the body is here you know the Creator and now he can come down and he can cause this and flow right in and you have a healthy balanced Godly influence in your life unbiblical leadership in the body I mean these things are sermons in themselves please I'm going to go into it more trust me uh this is just now it's kind of like a bit of an overview as well I want to break this down as well so just bear with me but now this is laying a good foundation unbiblical leadership in the body this so here you have the same thing the flow of God's love and the thoughts of God coming in but you see now what has happened what if the spirit is leading the body if your spirit if you're run by your feelings and your emotions youve broken the word of God because you have now and something has happened in your life and it's caused your spirit to be so unruly and so scarred and so hurt and broken that it's leading your life and that's causing you to do all these things all the time and you don't want to do them but it's because that and Jesus Christ is pouring his stuff in cuz he loves you and he wants to change you but you see there needs to be a shift there needs to be a turning around that because the soul has been given Dominion the soul has and unfortunately some people don't recognize their position that they've been placed in and it's getting Trampled Under The Feminine spirit it's getting crushed down by that female your spirit and she's ruling that emotional part of you the help meat of your life is ruling here and the funnel is turned upside down and of course it's not working because you see uh he that has no rule over his own Spirit he the soul that has no rule over his own mind and spirit and subconscious and conscious is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls what does that mean this house here is breached in its walls and the Very Hollywood and fear and Satan's evil thought and Fox News and negativity from Hollywood and all these ideologies that are not from above have come in and they're coming into that body and that soul and that spirit is getting funneled into it and it's just it just becomes a cycle now it's time to recognize your Dominion it's time to recognize that you have been placed over those things and to take dominion over it you have to if you don't you will stay the way you are for the rest of your life and you might not be lost but you've got to recognize that worry and fear and all of these negative thoughts is making you forget who you are and that's what Satan wants to do is to forget who's in the boat with you and then you get amnesia and you live torment because your soul has been quickened it has if you've got the Holy Ghost but you just don't don't ever get past that first part of your land you've you cross over Jordan and you're stuck and you never conquer Jericho because you see you've got to take the minion you've got to recognize who you are you got to start training those people down in the ship by confession by singing songs and by actually enjoying the things of God and setting your affections on things above if your affections aren't ask him say Lord please help me set my affections on you help me you just have to ask if you can diagnose your situation ask the antidote and he will lead you down a path don't just sit there and defeat you can just ask unbalanced feelings carnal thoughts and then here this is the unbiblical Family household and I just put this in here just because it's it's the same analogy so there you've got a house and you got Jesus Christ and then you've got this Mo modern feminist spirit in the house and the the wife is leading and the husband's gone under here but he in the house should be up here and if he's not here she doesn't go there Jesus Christ does not recognize the wife as the head of the home if the husband is a Christian and and he's meant to be leading the home there's obviously there's many different circumstances there's people without husbands and vice versa and you know obviously this is a generalization but in a in a in this situation that I'm talking about here the if the husband isn't here and he should be and he's not taking that position she cannot just put in here what's going to happen is this feminine spirit is going to lead and this house is going to have a problem because it has to be he has to take his position he has to be the leader and it's like your soul he has to be the leader he or she the soul you has to recognize your position recognize what God has made you confess it sing it act it live it amen um musicians please and we'll pray as the musicians come Lord Jesus father these things Lord is a real Enlightenment to me and I thank you for how it's come across um Lord it's it really is a privilege father that you could come on the scene
