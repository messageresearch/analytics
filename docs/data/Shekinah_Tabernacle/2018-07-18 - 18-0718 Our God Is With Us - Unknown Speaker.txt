Christ's name have full Liberty Lord father we've come to see you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you musicians thank you I mean thinking is evening hey man it's good to see everyone here hallelujah amen let's turn now if you got your scriptures handy we're going to we're gonna go to first John chapter 3 and then we're gonna go to Luke 17 I mean this is the last service that Jim will be with us so god bless you where's she gone Amen god bless us been great having you here amen first John three and one first John 3:1 it says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world North us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear now let's just repeat that next but but we know but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and he's appearing among us right now and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure I mean let's go to the Gospel of Luke and chapter 17 we're gonna read verse 30 they will read from verse 26 just as a bit of a background it says Jesus saying as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even those shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats tonight amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord night I want to speak on how God is with us now we read there in first John 3 because you know and I wanted to read I wanted us to read it together because it says that we are the sons of God it does not appear yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear when he is among us I mean that we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now brother Brahim says and convinced and concerned this is before the seals open he says now John was so sure that he was going to see the Messiah till he said he's in our midst now that's John the Baptist right now watch notice there's a big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming it's two different words means two different things the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord now the appearing of the Lord is now when he's appearing in his people I want to emphasize the in his people he's appearing in his people he's appearing in his bride he's manifesting himself through his bride he's manifesting herself through his people brother Graham says in the sermon I've heard of thee but now I see thee he says when you see the manifestation of God you've seen God I mean so you should be able to look at one another and see Jesus Christ in flesh and you should be able to say I have seen God today because I've seen God and the people hallelujah when you see the bride manifested you've seen God hallelujah amen I'm so thankful that that you know we do not serve our idea it's a reality I think of the last Wednesday our God is a God of reality he's not a God of ideas or arguments or debate he's a God of reality and if this Bible is true and his promise that he would manifest every promise of his word in the stay of his people I mean that it will happen and I believe it is happening I mean I believe his life was now in a people I mean we're not looking for him to appear he's appearing he's appeared I mean he's manifesting himself and a people in this hour hallelujah and that's more than just a nice thing to say it's a reality it is happening right now amen his Spirit working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the rapture for the coming of the law to catch away his bride the appearing and the coming all right now now the thing is we have to do if we can believe it and be concerned about it first we've got to be convinced that it is God then when we're convinced then we are concerned I like that he says all right amen so he speaks about the appearing and that's why we read that he's appearing among us though when we speak about the coming of the Lord now we understand that we are living in a time of the coming of the Lord so the Lord has come but he's also coming I mean when the seals are opened the mighty angel descent it was an open book that was a coming amen when when when Jesus came on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came into the Upper Room that was a coming right but when we talk about the coming of the Lord we're talking about when he descends and we are our bodies are changed we got to meet him with the dead in Christ in the air that's the end of the coming right but he's already working among his children all over the world to prepare a people to go out and meet him hallelujah so now he is working among us now I read there Luke 17 now many times we will read Luke 17 in the 30th verse and we will think well the Son of Man being revealed and we will put that off in a prophets ministry but the Prophet tells us it's not just a one man ministry but the Son of Man is revealed in the church I mean the son of man is Jesus Christ so he's not just putting it to his own ministry he's saying now the Son of Man is revealed in a multi member boddyhm I mean so the Ministry of the Bride of Christ revealing or the making nine of Jesus Christ I mean when you should see you know when you should see the bride you should see him just like Jesus was with his disciples and one of them said to him show us the father and it also faces us and Jesus says have I been so long with you Philip and you haven't known me if you've seen me you've seen the father here's a little man he's from galleys and you know up in yo ye yo you know he said you know in his early 30s he looks like any other kind of man I mean but he was through him now the father was revealing himself it says if you've seen if you've really seen me not just thing not just the veil not just the flesh he looked like any other common man but the God himself the Messiah being revealed yeah he says if you've seen him you've seen the father right he looked like any other man you know it many many were stirred up in those days and they and they you know they enjoyed his ministry for a season but then they turned away and they said let's crucify him so they didn't really see him I mean the woman at the well and many others you know the Pharisee stood the same preaching Peter James and John hood amen it changed some of them amen in one way and it changed the others a different way one way it said Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and the other said this is Beelzebub and then Jesus just asked the question if your children cast out the devil amen if they cast out the devil and then I cast out the devil it says basically what spirits doing it and then you'll be the judge because they're saying you because they said to him you cast out the devil by by the power of Beelzebub he says if the you're a house divided cannot stand this is if I cast out the devil by the power of the devil in in the devil's house is divided it cannot stand but if I cast by the finger of God now you judge it was God among them right and it's the same thing you got to look now you say well who is producing the life that's in the people amen we talked about the Bride of Christ what's producing the life in you amen I pray it's him I pray it's him you know you gotta take a real good look at it beyond a beyond a mental debate and say well what life is living what life is living I'm contending as Jesus Christ the Word made flesh amen know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is no the bride has seen him in this hour the elect of every age sees the Messiah and and whatever form he manifests when he when he came down into Egypt in the days of Moses I'm just going to do a real Brooks scatter through the scripture God came down spoke to Moses the mighty deliverer I've come to give you the land take you out of slavery you're gonna go into your inheritance those who really saw him beyond the miracles right beyond them beyond the miracles those who really saw him Caleb and Joshua said we're more than able to take the land that's going to take the land so the same anointing that was on Moses now came on them Moses even said that these God said that these tour of a different spirit than the other spice collie because they had real faith in the promise God is going to give us the land I minced that mighty Conqueror that came down to deliver his people now anointed them Caleb 84 years old I'm as strong today as I wasn't hair came out of Egypt I mean give me my mountain hallelujah he got his position amen and we're living in a we're living in a day now where we're the people of God are receiving their inheritance receiving their promise what God is light up in the scripture for you as a now when we receive that inheritance I mean so we must be people says God give me my inheritance I want to live according to my privilege I mean that I have in Christ Jesus my Lord I don't want to live below my privilege I'm in being beaten down by the enemy I'm an overcomer I made to be an overcomer hallelujah so they overcame in their day then you jump forward now you jump forward to the woman at the well she saw him she saw him he's a man sitting by well she went to that well everyday maybe to get water with him very frequently she knew the well she maybe knew how many steps it was to that well but this day was different here was a man sitting but as well he was a Jew she was a Samaritan she's the first thing basically she said to us we have no dealings you know and then and then he says for first he says first give me a drink and then the conversation moves on and he says to her if you knew the water I'd give you that you'd never thirst hallelujah and then begin to say well I mean these years well our fathers worship here and our fathers worship here that you say we should worship in Jerusalem they've got a bit religious about it but it went beyond that go get your husband go get your husband she's about to see him we know where Messiah cometh he'll do these things see it has to go beyond as I showed the photo on I mean the photo of the replica of the tabernacle on Sunday just a tint nothing for all that pretty about it really nothing but in there was God God was veiled but you had to go through the veil you couldn't be on the outside or just look at it admire even know everything about it how was built yet to go into the inner veil getting onto the prints of God yet the go beyond the veil I mean God has always veiled right I want to go into that on Sunday maybe the Lord willing God's always veiled you got to look beyond the veil Peter James and John looked beyond the veil and they saw Messiah I mean the woman of the well says we know when Messiah come he'll do these things she just he just said he that speaks theum he a man as she believed it her whole life was changed hallelujah the scribes and Pharisees heard I mean saw the same veil and they see it away with such a fellow you gotta look beyond the veil right you gotta look beyond the veil we shall be like him when we see him she could not now we living in an hour maybe a we're living in an hour where the Seventh Seal is manifesting the Seventh Seal is the coming of the Lord right brother Branham says it's the end of all things he says in the seventh seal message we must remember that the Seventh Seal is the end of time time of all things that's right the things written in the seventh seal book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world at it at every but ends it is the end it's the end of the straggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything and there's the end of the trumpets as the end of the vials it's the end of the earth that's even the end of time time runs out season revelations ten and seven ten and six the time will be no more that went in the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the time the end of the seventh seal notice the end of the church age at the end of the seventh seal the end of the trumpets that's the end of the vials it's the end of the ushering of the Millennium it's on the seventh seal is just like a rocket firing a rocket into the locker you're like Guy Fawkes you know uh amen and that rocket explodes up there and it goes up and then it explodes again and then and then our out 5 stars and where those stars explodes and blows under 5 more stars and exploits but on and on on then it fades out since the end of time it's the end of it'll be the end of sin the end of the devil the end of all things hallelujah now we are under that's Christ coming to the earth as part of that we're under that dispensation amen you know you you take the seven seals I heard at the sway no you know and I liked it when I heard it I said now the first four seals is the Antichrist moving I'm not in there right I'm not anointed by the power horse rider in this day they meant the fifth seal the fifth seals them you know the martyrdom of the Jews I'm not under there the sixth seal is a Great Tribulation that's not for me so I got to be somewhere I got to be under the seventh and that's Christ a mighty angel coming down amen to anointest people to live on as people now if it's the end of all things now then there comes a time where every cycle not bicycle cycle must be broken right so just like the woman at the well when she looked beyond the veil and said though out them we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and saw the Messiah then her cycle of her life changed it was broken her old life was broken right she never had the man problem again she was looking for love in all the wrong places I mean she was broken she you know hurt people hurt people end up hurting themselves more as well and she was looking for love and so she got married a few times this it was no point getting married him I'll just live with this one and that's was the current state right but then now her Messiah came her real husband came and spoke some words to her they just had a brief conversation that's all it takes Jesus speak a few words speak a few words to you you got to be looking for him to speak hallelujah and it changed her life brother Ram says of that light struck that seed a man she was redeemed because she received that word and believed that there was the Messiah and a whole life change I mean she was an outcast in her village that's why she went to the well of that particular time not with the other young ladies and the same ones that thrust her out of her society she went running back in to come see a man that's told me everything I've done is not the very Messiah hallelujah broke that complex amen our God is a cycle breaker hallelujah he's a complex breaker amen he'll heal your pain he'll heal up your wounds the anointing Jesus when he went to the synagogue it's amazing how people get angry when when when we read about the scripture being fulfilled he takes thee he takes you know he goes into the synagogue of Nazareth finds the place to read of Isaiah says the spread of laws upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering the sites of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he stopped right there in the middle of that scripture left the other partner and the a vengeance of our God for a second coming I mean because that part was fulfilled the first coming the others the second coming hallelujah he split a scripture and two and said this day he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears hallelujah so what was laying there on paper now was living now become manifested it was a prophecy no about no doubt it brought me debate on ideas and blogs and websites about it but then finally a man stood up and read it I mean he found his place in the scripture saying this is me this date of the Scriptures fulfilled a mere - no doubt the woman of the well if she was sitting there after the well experience she would say yes because that happened to me hallelujah I've been set at liberty Amen he's healed me hallelujah I received sight yo I was brokenhearted I been healed right I've been seen at Liberty I was Bruce hallelujah I've been set free of these things she'd saying this has happened to me hallelujah that's amazing the people didn't stand up and say hallelujah Hosanna glory to God here comes his our Messiah and he's showing he's identifying his own ministry in the scripture that is sin for us they didn't rejoice they got mad they got mad interesting isn't it you know how people will contend about the scripture that's being fulfilled in this day but you got to find your place in the scripture you to find your ministry hallelujah now we have to understand of the Spirit of the Lord did not just rest upon the Messiah he says I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world wait in Jerusalem T renewed with power from on high I am in and they tarried there 10 days then that same spirit came in and filled them hallelujah amen we don't need to tarry anymore we don't need to tear anymore it takes a fully repentant heart I mean that you give yourself fully surrender everything that you are and he'll fill you hallelujah this is more than excitement friends I know what I'm talking about hallelujah amen my friends we're going to understand how God lives I mean he's here who's been set free of something broken a cycle in your life hallelujah put two hands and if I could put the feet up I put my feet up as well hallelujah because his anointing came upon me and broke cycles Amen my own life I'm not my own I'm not the old person I used to be are you being this thing forever I just turned up the other day Oh amen you would never have wanted to have me as a friend you'd say that poor soul Lord save him he did she doesn't and symfony saved me hallelujah you'd never think that I'd be here and I'd ever think I'd be in this kind of place I mean but God Richard mercy God Richard mercy can take the one who is in the last of the last of the last of the last of the lone reach down his hand lift them up lift her up place them heavenly places in Christ Jesus you've got to know what it's like to be lost and be saved doesn't matter where you're from and how holy you think you are every one must be found you've got to be saved hallelujah well what you say well I don't know what I need to be safe wrong how about your first birth how about your first nature you know the older you get the more failures you see in your own character God can take those from you Duncan purify some of those things hallelujah amen now he is appearing among us the devil doesn't want the Spirit of God to move amen Carolee move them there Pentecost one heart one mind one Accord when they got all their pride out you know you know before Jesus was going to Calvary their striving among themselves would be the greatest am I the greatest I'm going to be the grouse now I'm going to be the greatest why is that I can run faster you I'm taller than you I've got a lot of voice and y'all be the greatest I look like the head minister and they're first thing about those things all that had to go all those things had to go I mean when you we have to get to a place where we're happy to see God use someone else you're going to be happy if you don't happy to see God use someone else you're in a wrong spot you'd be happy to see God anoints someone and and whatever God will do you say thank you Lord you would take someone and anoint them and live through them hallelujah then they died out then God came one mind you think about it here we are at the end of the Gentile dispensation I mean we know Grace is winding up but we know we're found grace hallelujah we know that he's been merciful to us I mean he found us reverie were you may have been raised up from a you know on a Pew he still had to find you hallelujah and here we are and we know where we're going and we know where we came from and we know who we are on him hallelujah amen and then so you know we should be so much for one Accord come move you know what happens you know what people do in the world if they can't cook they go get a drink cuz I can't handle the reality of life thank you drunk they do drugs now I've got something better if you can't handle life I've got something for you to treat I've got something for you to drink hallelujah that you can be drunk every day of your life until you leave this world I mean that's what brother Graham told us is it a man can be drunk on the Spirit of God Paul says be filled not just a little tiful here in a little tipple whatever you gods have a sample sample it gives about the sample take the bottle drink the whole thing hallelujah he saw I just can't handle I get drunk on the spirt get drunk on him hallelujah and you'll find yourself doing things Amen that you would never imagine you're doing hello Lou you can hang people who are very reserved and very quiet you just get a couple of beers of them and they're dancing off the sky dancing off the chairs they're your kinds of things and that way Celtic now I can't believe I did that oh I've got it on camera I saw you do that hallelujah and you take it when God comes into your life here not sharing your cup runneth over for joy hallelujah and you'll find yourself doing things you've never imagined hallelujah brother thing is you won't have any regrets you want to feel bad you don't wake up with a hangover oh I'm never gonna do that again it's me yes I want to be an addict hallelujah I'm gonna have more of this hallelujah what's my tolerance I don't know let's find out hallelujah hallelujah shouldn't we be that way I'm here to get drunk hallelujah I'm here to enjoy my lord imagine going to a feast you spent a whole under how many months planning this feast and you got all the day core just right you see out the invitation just like a wedding sounds like a winning you know and you've you've stretched you know finally everything's there though finally the day is come you want your guests to enjoy themselves and they come in and they don't look very happy to to be there you know you know just walking along you know they're sitting in the corner like this and there's the best food there's the best food you can imagine and that's what they like it's what they like it's right there and their best drink and the best musical whatever's there and they're texting someone on the other side the room you think what is wrong with that person they do not appreciate they're missing the feast amen but you see someone who's excited you see people you know

about a bug nothing wrong with liking bugs bugs are fine right but if someone can be that excited about a bug how much more eternal life how much more a word that can rapture people how much more than living God among us hallelujah amen looking for the feasts they come in they they feel they played up for dicks to plates they sit down they get comfortable they get room and they eat hallelujah and they're enjoying all is wonderful I can't fit it all I can't fit this anymore oh but I have another stomach for dessert I love dessert if I see someone like that and then when they're done I got a digest but they've had a good time and the pressure is put on the banquet is happy to see someone like that they have enjoyed the fullness of my banquet hallelujah amen and they'll tell them they'll so good I enjoyed the food so wonderful is my favorite how did you know I like those kind of things it's so wonderful that's the person you really want to invite to a banquet now how much more us how much more us you know what we have you know what this message is it's God revealed Jesus Christ revealed amen brother Bram says this now I'm gonna read this from the rapture message I just want you to think about this now the the rapture in 1st Thessalonians 4 the Lord descends with a shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God right he does these three things as he is descending now he sees this in the rapture message for the Lord Himself the sixteenth bertha's from first Thessalonians shall descend from him with a shout with the voice of the Archangel in the Trump of God three things happen a voice a shout a voice a trumpet as there before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all them when he's descending the shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride now God has a way of doing things he never changes his policy he never changes he's the unchanging God and Amos 3:7 he said he'd do nothing on earth until he first reveals it to servants the prophets just as certain as he promised it he'll do it and we have a principle in Romans 10 faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God but how can you hear only someone has sent and how come in your and you can only hear them if they've been commissioned and sent and then you hear the word of God this is whom sort of called on the name of the Lord shall be saved so in the servant is sent and he's anointed a commission he preaches the gospel and the people hear that word they can call upon the name of the Lord and be saved right so faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God hallelujah that's why there has to be a messenger come at the end of the age winds up all the loose ends reveals Christ to the people and that word produces a braid amen Joshua was told meditate on the whole Word of God you'll be successful so that word that he was feeding on gave him success gave him the inheritance for the people hallelujah how much more us don't you want your inheritance across Jordan and in sand and make a beach house on the other side I don't know how big the river is but you know what I mean I made a boat house you just in the Jordan what's it's nice it's River and go fishing yeah but what about that mountain there don't you want your mountain what tribe you from I just want the boathouse what's wrong with you that's how some people are they live below they're privileged I'm just going to stay in death stay in the Jordan you had across Jordan the word has come the Ark has come as part of death that you can walk through I mean that's why we have real births in this place wherever the messages is real births because a way through a death the self has been opened by the word and you can cross through how lujah well I'm on the other side you're gonna take Jericho but I've got the beach house real estates expensive on the water I'm thinking of my future children no go take your land go take your land I don't want to just ought to be in wherever I'm called to be I want to possess that land amen now they seize now and I won this up but when we shall see him we shall be weightless I just let's just read that again first John three you know what I mean about the feast on we've got you say no one can be drunk on the spirit every day hey sure have you seen anyone who's ever left oh I've never seen it done before no I had never seen it rain before either but he knew it was gonna rain amen Joshua had never seen people might surround a fortified city and watch it fall down flat but it did Joshua had never seen the Sun and the moon stand still it did he's under inspiration a dead amen had they ever seen the Red Sea part before they parted the Red Sea no but it did Shamgar had an ox code he didn't go on Wikipedia can a man farmer with an ox go defeat six hundred I'm Philistines wait honey did you pray the board broadband this is going slow oh he didn't do that did he he knew he is a circumcised Israelite he was living into his inheritance he didn't say can't it be done something moved in him it is gonna be done and he took the off scot and killed every one of them hallelujah all things are possible to them that believe he ever thought about that all all things are possible to him to believe three of believers three have believers I mean brother arm says even the weakest of Christians when they get that on their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes hallelujah I think we should spend more time on our knees why are you praying I hear an earthquake hallelujah and yet the devil never built his buildings properly I've been glory to God now sorry first John three it says now at verse 2 think about it I'm not I'm not telling jokes you got to think about all things are possible all things we don't live in the Lutheran age all they could live as high as the just shall live by faith that's what God poured out and then the Westlands it was the just shall live by faith and then sanctification okay they couldn't go any higher than that that's what got it restored and they're Pentecostals the restoration of the gifts right and that's as far as they could go but then when the Son of Man is revealed Jesus Christ the fullness all that God poured into Christ he poured into where the church you hallelujah so we're not called the plateau oh I've never had a time like that time what about now oh I remember being full of joy what about now all that piece of puzzle understanding back there what about now hallelujah what about oh I surround and felt so free we should be free Oh hallelujah now but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now we shall be like him now whoa what's he like he's the mighty God amen he conquered hell death in the grave he will stood the devil's temptations he overcame a meant popularity didn't get him money didn't get him woman didn't get him the devil's lies didn't get him and he was tempted at all points but you without sin and he was a man of flesh and blood he was tempted on all points or Jesus doesn't understand what I'm going through yeah he does he was tempted it's just been rebranded because the devil try yo he's got to keep marketing same old thing just like spark it's still Telecom same old thing you logo new name whatever whatever company you want to think of it's still the same old company right it's just got a new logo just like I worked for ESR we had a new logo recently you know still still the same company we've been the same company for 25 years and then before that when it was all one big scientific group with me were in different ones but we now we've been the same company for 25 years we do the same kind of things technology may have improve but we do the same kind of things the devil has the same old things maybe the technology will be improved your the methods but when you boil it down it's the same old thing I mean same old yo whatever devil it is same old devil just rebranded new and shiny latest model same old devil right so he was tempted in all points yet without sin see he understands the things we face amen so now he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered religion he calmed the dead formal religion right he conquered culture he conquered society nothing was he bound by anything was anything held him back was he bowed in any way no he knew who he was he he raised the dead it's amazing you read the account of Lazarus being raised from the dead he's a man four days in the grave rotting comes back to life amazing not just freshly dead he's he's right he stinks you know one of the sisters Miriam Arthur said don't you know he's thinkers by now that's why yeah you know I don't want to put forth yeah yeah I don't put words in his mouth but maybe he could have said well that's why I actually waited to actually show you I am the resurrection and the life believeth Elvis amen so he did this and then some Pharisees and stuff they get mad now we're gonna have counsels and we're gonna kill him and they wanted to kill Lazarus the devil gets matter the greater God moves have you ever thought the greater God moves the devil just gets matter right let him get mad why is he why is he roaring around in this day because he's been exposed you ever seen a conqueror yo cockroach or anything you know you expose the thing it just starts running or flying depends what country you're in but it's running cuz it's got exposed it's hiding they're doing its cockroach things and then you pull the power off it oh the lights on me brother Bram says you just see the look on people's faces when the devil's about to get exposed in their life amen and why do people people get angry and their tempers fly cuz that's the devil knows he's exposed but people's pride holds on to Satan amen he conquered everything amen now if he is if that is how he is he was the Word made flesh right he did all that to please the father I do only that to please the father he knew why he was here on earth this is who he was he was God the heart of God expressed like brother Bram said he said I used to think that the father hated me but Jesus the son loved me I come to find out they one and the same in Jesus the heart of God right and so he's the heart of God expressed now if that is him then if we when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is so if that's the case and I believe he is appearing among us I believe this is more than enthusiasm it's been six odd years it hasn't burned out for me personally it's been ten plus years and it hasn't burned out hallelujah amen it gets more glorious it gets more wonderful are you to ascribe on emotion anything without emotion is dead and we do not this is one thing we do not believe in did religion I do not believe in dead religion amen if you wanna dance cry shout boohoo whatever more I mean brother Brown someone complained I cannot listen to a Mentalist that crying all the stuff and brother says you know if they weren't a meaning I would think something's wrong because he said eight minutes like you get a dog chases are you know and and and and sometimes you get to skunk and they're scared of skunks the skanks spray their stinky smell on them and hear more about East Coaster doc I'm sick of sick him get him get him get him that's like saying Amen from the heart of faith that same Sikkim tree that devil get that devil cold and tie whatever formal what's going on you know have you seen has anyone seen now I'm not doing a plug for anything but France won the World Cup how will they when they won has anyone seen has anyone seen now rather had he come here just come here now this is the World Cup this is the best I have your okay so just sound the captain of France you're presenting me the World Cup I mean you're you actually Vladimir Putin I think he did it but you know do you think I just you know thanks but you know do you think you know did you see them everything one game and they gave the whole energy and in that one day the cup and they were addressing and they were dancing and they were going round for days and days and days amen it's just soccer I'm sorry to deflate some people but it's just a game right but even the fans it was riding in France with River guns exactly yeah vive la France we won haha you know they're all they're all excited generally excited think about it you know and they're probably still celebrating now here we are you say well that's just sport David when he saw the Ark come back into his City he had been fighting for years and he was on the run and he fought many perils and dangers finally he came down I have my capital and the priests of bringing the Ark is fitting and he begun to done so I don't know how it here comes a presence of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know what this is the first five books I'll just show you something just think about this Deuteronomy now of course it wasn't in this form because that was on rolls whatever more but that doesn't matter he stopped the Sun stands to walk those Kings you know in the cave and they dragged them out after the battle he told us captain's the younger generation all with just fire book - the Bible under the blood of bulls and goats that word became a living reality in his life and he took everything how much more we don't just have five books you take this now all tests with blood of bulls and goats people are moved by the Spirit of God they did it they did exploits in their name I think God now releases more word and then the wood Himself becomes flesh yeah the blood of bulls of guts now God comes and dwells into people oh this is a nine thumpeka because enthroned said they've released his full power more power and John's only all of Patmos he sing the whole plan of redemption he's seen the book of Revelation he sees the mighty angel voice of seven thunders uttered their voices he's about to write it down to release that word to the church to seal it up John it'll be released the time of the end and then and then here we go I'll choose a prophet to the land I mean and those seven thunders are no longer a mystery they've been revealed and it's all the Bible's not adding to the Bible at all in the scripture and a releases of power was called the walk on the water what do you think what do you think Jesus wanted him to do just to say I walked on water he wanted to know now the first Adam controlled nature right the second Adam is now controlling nature he's walking on water now let's see the wind was blowing it wasn't cow they meant trials in the midst of the trial I'll put it that way and Peter is walking on top of the trial see sometimes the trial goes away or the devil goes away sometimes you're still fighting him but you go to the victory I mean he doesn't just give us this you know flowery beard of ease it's a rugged walk God wants it to be a record walk but he wants to reveal himself on you we would never have had the Book of Psalms if David just went straight from the anointing by Samuel to the throne he had to be on the run from Saul he had to take Bathsheba all those things had to happen for him to write we would never had the psalm created me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me we would never had that that's a son that's after he's been Nathan's coming the prophet two years after he took Bathsheba killed us killed her husband tells the parable of the man with many sheep and there's the poor man with one sheep angry anger is he hears it and then the King says that man must die and then the Prophet just points them in the poison spring otherwise you're that man two years later after it was done since still sits around yes amen and if your gods God will come and put his finger on it hallelujah but if it does it's a glorious thing amen we would never had the Book of Psalms without those trials and hardship hallelujah and God wants this word to be manifested in your life and he will course allow trials to come and hardship amen in your everyday life hallelujah because he wants to express himself out of you using that trial I'm so glad that's why I don't work together for good this person's on my case on the job it's working for your good because God wants to express himself and you yeah amen now so let's just wind up let's have the musicians please Peter's walking on the water even in this storm you're in control you're not sinking if you look at me but he begin to look at the trial and forget the one who called them now the Lord is my shepherd he leadeth me beside still waters shepherds in the Bible lead they don't chase with dogs they lead right so if you're you may be walking through a dark place on a mountain God lead you there God led you there Haylee job puts the heat our footsteps to order those him so if that is the case he called you there I walk through the briar patch Here I am he looked at the wind and waves it begin to sink this is engulfing me I can't handle this he called out to the Lord of meeting the Lord picked him up and then he walked on the water again and that's the main thing you may find yourself sinking just call that to him he'll grab you and then you can walk out on the walk out on the water you love him tonight hallelujah let's down to
