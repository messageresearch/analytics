[31:52] much
[31:54] amen Amen brother Donnie
[31:58] would you mind comeing
[32:26] share
[32:40] I'll just read a scripture um first in
[32:43] the book of in the book of
[32:46] heg
[32:50] amen the Bible says the glory of the L
[32:54] house shall be greater than of the
[32:56] former
[32:57] say the Lord of hosts and in this place
[33:01] will I give peace say the Lord of hosts
[33:05] the glory of this L house shall be
[33:07] greater than of the former say the Lord
[33:10] of hosts
[33:11] so um just the Lord is just pressed on
[33:17] my heart so heavy to just
[33:20] um say something that we've picked up
[33:23] and um maybe somebody's going through a
[33:25] tough time a trial
[33:27] the glory of the lat house is greater
[33:30] than that of the
[33:31] former
[33:34] um uh the flesh brother brenon refers to
[33:37] that as the former house and God is
[33:40] building a spiritual house so um I'll
[33:42] just read something that um brother Bram
[33:45] speaks of in the Hebrew series we've
[33:48] listened to it on um
[33:51] Wednesday and um during the week I've
[33:53] said it with a few people and um last
[33:56] night I just said it with a brother also
[33:58] and um uh you know it was just such an
[34:01] anointing uh that was after we've been
[34:04] having a lovely time at brother Isaac's
[34:05] place so it was really good and I just
[34:08] um you know the Lord has just pressed in
[34:10] my heart to just share it with u with
[34:12] the church this morning as well he's
[34:15] speaking speaking of this lady Rosella
[34:18] and he says and when Rosella was quoting
[34:20] the story to me so brother brandham I'm
[34:22] not going to relate everything but
[34:23] brother brandham was just before the
[34:25] pray the preaching some sometimes he
[34:27] would have he would have private
[34:29] interviews so brother Brandon would
[34:31] arrive early to church and people would
[34:33] come early and certain things were very
[34:36] sensitive um and brother brandham um
[34:39] over the years we've learned a lot of
[34:41] things in the message so some things you
[34:42] you you you don't come to the pulpit
[34:45] here in front and testify about it and
[34:47] say I need a pray the prayer for it it's
[34:49] private so um you have to see the
[34:51] deacons at the back you see the pastor
[34:53] it's very sensitive so you you shouldn't
[34:55] say that so so brother Bram has given us
[34:59] an order of how to do things so some
[35:01] things could be in your house could be
[35:02] in your family between you and your wife
[35:04] stuff that you've that you've carried
[35:06] over from a former day and the message
[35:08] is a complete new day you can't carry
[35:10] you can't carry anything over and when
[35:13] we were listening to the sermon brother
[35:15] brandham was referring to Paul so Paul
[35:17] was um trained by gel and then brother
[35:21] Bram said that God had to take him away
[35:23] for three years in the in the desert of
[35:25] Arabia to knock all the things that was
[35:28] not there were certain things that you
[35:30] that God want you to pull through from
[35:32] your former life there's things that he
[35:34] wants you to pull through but there's
[35:35] certain things he doesn't want you to
[35:36] pull through he doesn't want you to
[35:38] carry over into the message so so there
[35:40] were certain things that God had to hit
[35:41] out of out of Paul um same thing with
[35:44] Moses um for 40 Years brother brandham
[35:47] said he had to keep him in the desert
[35:48] and brother brandham says um God sand
[35:51] blasted Moses out of Moses so um Moses
[35:54] had a certain idea of how he could
[35:57] deliver the people of Israel because he
[35:59] heard a lot of of his mother saying that
[36:01] your birth was special you are special
[36:03] so we in the message you come here you
[36:06] you you you hear this you you realize
[36:08] you're a special people and we were we
[36:11] were relating it with Brother Andy
[36:12] yesterday and I also sent last night
[36:15] while I was just in prayer and um we
[36:18] were busy talking yesterday about where
[36:21] brother brandham says and brother Bram
[36:22] speaks a lot about it in Paul where Paul
[36:25] says um God has given me a Thorn In the
[36:27] Flesh lest I be exalted above the
[36:30] abundance of that Revelation so so this
[36:33] message it's an abundance of Revelation
[36:35] and and you you might be exalting
[36:38] yourself higher than what God want you
[36:40] to be and and Paul says in that
[36:43] scripture that God has given me a thorn
[36:46] in the flesh lest I be exalted above the
[36:50] measure of the abundance of the
[36:52] Revelation so we might not realize what
[36:55] we have um the message of the hour is
[36:58] something completely different I just
[37:00] want to read about Rosella so brother
[37:02] brand is relating to this so this was in
[37:04] a private interview but somehow brother
[37:06] brand comes out of the private interview
[37:08] and he relates this so certain things he
[37:10] never related but he relates about
[37:11] Rosella and rosala was quoting the story
[37:14] to me in the room a while ago I was just
[37:18] thinking that on that night she said
[37:21] something happened and how that said all
[37:26] down through her life when she be just a
[37:30] wholey alcoholic couldn't he says here
[37:33] couldn't know nothing no Alcoholic
[37:36] Anonymous whatever couldn't do anything
[37:39] four doctors give her up nothing could
[37:42] be done he says and how from that very
[37:45] moment when when she heard the word from
[37:48] that moment something taken place now
[37:52] she is not that batty eyed she says
[37:55] she's a lovely beautiful young woman of
[37:58] 33 years old and who pass for about
[38:03] 22 just how that God did for her what he
[38:08] did and how she looks he says different
[38:13] but I said
[38:14] Rosella before the foundation of the
[38:17] world Amen God ordained that moment so
[38:22] before the foundation of the world her
[38:25] Deliverance was ordained
[38:27] amen but but the message is that brother
[38:31] preach a sermon called Paradox so if if
[38:34] her Deliverance was for ordained that
[38:38] means the trial was also for ordained
[38:41] it's quite quite a a paradox so so you
[38:44] go through something and then he
[38:46] delivers
[38:47] you but for him to have been able to
[38:50] deliver you he would have had to
[38:53] predestinate or allow that that you're
[38:56] going through to happen before listen
[38:58] the quote says he told Rosella in the
[39:01] room when see and on another place
[39:03] brother BR first with how she was a dope
[39:05] adct she was heavy into dope drugs and
[39:07] stuff so he speaks of alcohol as well
[39:09] here and on the next page I just want to
[39:11] save time and he says this woman was a
[39:14] dope
[39:15] addict and God delivered her and he says
[39:17] I told her that your deliverance was for
[39:21] ordained by God before the foundation of
[39:23] the world so so and when and when
[39:26] brother the brandham says something he's
[39:28] a prophet he doesn't say it like you and
[39:30] me just because I read it somewhere he
[39:33] sees he goes he goes beyond time he's a
[39:36] prophet he travels Beyond time he stands
[39:39] right there when God made a decision I
[39:41] will give rosela this trial so he's
[39:43] different so by the grace of God we we
[39:46] are happy we are glad I just want to
[39:48] close with this um we were talking about
[39:51] something yesterday about the Rada in
[39:53] and this is just the minister will be
[39:55] preaching the pastor it's just something
[39:57] that God has placed on my heart which I
[39:59] just want to share with the
[40:01] church so the Rada in is a very
[40:05] prominent place a lot of things happen
[40:07] in the Rada in I'm going to read
[40:13] something so in a sermon titled the
[40:18] Rapture preach on December 4
[40:22] 1965 in Yuma
[40:24] Arizona this is brother brandham
[40:26] reminded the people of the prophecy for
[40:29] the West Coast now this is just a
[40:31] narrator this is a brother they just
[40:33] typed us up he says I remember just my
[40:37] last message now brother brandham is is
[40:38] is quoting from Brother bram's sermon I
[40:40] remember just my last message in
[40:42] California where I would I thought i'
[40:46] I'd given I'd never go back again he
[40:49] says sorry I'm just skipping here I
[40:52] thought I'd never go back
[40:55] again when I predicted Los Angeles will
[40:59] go beneath the ocean and thus sayeth the
[41:01] Lord it will she's she's done she's
[41:05] washed she's finished what an hour he
[41:08] says I don't know when but it will be
[41:10] sunk on December the 6
[41:14] 1965 in San Bernardino California as he
[41:18] preached the sermon modern evain events
[41:21] made clear by prophecy brother brandham
[41:23] made a statement as he was singing this
[41:26] song So under the anointing brother
[41:30] Brandon was singing the song so we were
[41:31] in a sermon once where a brother that
[41:34] was in that service and I'll tell you
[41:36] what happened under that anointing so a
[41:38] brother that was in the service when
[41:40] brother brandham said this made a
[41:41] statement while he's singing a Brother
[41:43] related it to another brother and that
[41:45] Brother related it to us once what
[41:47] happened under the anointing with
[41:48] brother Brenham so I'll I'll relate to
[41:51] you now what happened in the service
[41:52] there was a brother there and this
[41:54] brother went over to America to go
[41:55] preach and that brother told him what
[41:56] happened when brother brandham so I'll
[41:58] relate to you what happened here modern
[42:01] events are made clear by prophecy
[42:02] brother brandham made a statement as he
[42:04] sang the song so he's in the anointing
[42:06] he's singing the song nations are
[42:08] breaking israels are waking the signs
[42:11] that the prophets foretold the Gentile
[42:13] days numbered what Horus
[42:16] encumbered he says here what Horus
[42:18] encumbered and then in between the
[42:21] brother quotes now on the sermon the rep
[42:24] they do exactly the same thing so he's
[42:25] putting this on this so brother brandham
[42:28] is's singing the song and then he says
[42:29] the following words under the anointing
[42:32] what's her slide into the sea and he
[42:34] carries on sing return oh dispose to
[42:37] your own he says the day of redemption
[42:40] is near men's hearts are failing for
[42:43] fear Redemption is near then I'll read
[42:45] further brother brother sister it's a
[42:48] scary time this is Brother Bram still
[42:49] speaking in the sermon what's the things
[42:52] prophesied what's the things what's all
[42:54] the prophecies being fulfilled
[42:57] then we see he says here then we see
[43:00] what all this is about it's not a bun a
[43:04] streak of
[43:05] fanaticism he says God's confirming his
[43:08] words exactly exactly the rock he's
[43:12] smitten friends flee to it as quickly as
[43:16] you can he says you flee to it he says
[43:20] prophets is vindicating the day prophecy
[43:22] is vindicating the day that we are
[43:24] living in brother
[43:26] brandom was
[43:29] approached by various brothers who lived
[43:32] in California asking him what they
[43:34] should do so this brother takes that and
[43:36] he continues further so now after
[43:38] brother brandham preached the
[43:41] sermon so while brother Brandon was
[43:43] preaching the
[43:45] sermon the brother said that related to
[43:48] another brother he said he was in the
[43:50] sermon and brother brandham under the
[43:51] anointing when he was singing the song
[43:53] and while that that happened brother
[43:55] brandham became lame and then he and
[43:57] then he that's when he said that words
[43:59] when he said I see a sliding in the sea
[44:02] and they could see and brother bham came
[44:03] back again and then they said brother
[44:05] brandham did a profound thing that he's
[44:08] never done before he says they said
[44:09] brother brandham has never done it ever
[44:11] he said he was in the service brother
[44:13] Brenham under the anointing walked off
[44:15] after the
[44:16] service and then brother Brenham came
[44:18] back with his hat on his head and he
[44:20] walked out and he said and he waved yeah
[44:24] and he walked back and they said brother
[44:26] brandham never ever went back to Los
[44:28] Angeles he's never done it he came back
[44:31] and he it's finished and he walk back so
[44:35] this Brothers asked brother brandom what
[44:37] to do so that's why
[44:40] um it is a very sincere thing you know
[44:43] the message is something very sincere
[44:44] brother brandom what should we
[44:47] do while on a hunting trip he said to
[44:50] the group so they ask him privately on a
[44:52] hunting trip you've preached this what
[44:54] should we
[44:54] do
[44:57] he says
[44:58] here people this is what brother Brenham
[45:01] responded to
[45:04] them people will make fun of the
[45:08] destruction of the earthquake that will
[45:11] strike the West
[45:13] Coast they will make fun of what I said
[45:16] would happen all the movies all the
[45:19] jokes if you follow the things on on on
[45:22] the internet does this happen it's just
[45:24] another thing there's so many Earth
[45:26] Quakes what is why do you make this man
[45:27] something special there's nothing
[45:29] special because it's happening such a
[45:30] lot there's a lot of Earth You Know
[45:32] listen under this anointing brother
[45:34] brandham says so he saw 2014 2015 he saw
[45:38] that time Facebook wasn't there and he
[45:40] sees what's happening on Facebook he
[45:41] says people will make fun of what I said
[45:45] would happen thus sayth the Lord on the
[45:48] west coast of America but I want your
[45:51] brothers to know this that if you have
[45:55] any friends or relation in Los Angeles
[45:59] if I were you I'd get them out as
[46:02] quickly as possible as possible he says
[46:05] then he
[46:07] told then he told the story of how the
[46:10] angel of the Lord had told him that his
[46:13] wife sister maida would give birth to a
[46:16] little boy and that he would name him
[46:18] Joseph he said the same Angel of the
[46:22] Lord that told me that I would have a
[46:24] boy Joseph of Byer told me that Los
[46:28] Angeles would sink and slide into the
[46:31] Pacific Ocean as the result of an
[46:37] earthquake so something else
[46:39] happened just something else I want to
[46:41] read in this this brother is saying
[46:44] let's turn now to the state of unrest in
[46:48] which brother Billy Paul found himself
[46:51] concerning the conflicting prophecy over
[46:53] sister Florence Saran
[46:56] when the message in tongues had gone
[46:58] forth on April 2965 so what happened and
[47:02] we were speaking about it yesterday
[47:04] Brother
[47:05] Andy um was relating to some brothers
[47:08] yesterday the
[47:09] different camps that we have experience
[47:12] in the message what Brother David said
[47:13] on Sunday evening brother David um uh
[47:16] Dominic we've experienced that I've
[47:18] related a little bit to Brother Andy
[47:20] added a bit of
[47:21] humor so you'll experience so brother
[47:23] brandham made a prophecy
[47:26] about what will happen to sister
[47:28] sakaran in the service somebody comes
[47:32] under the anointing and speaks in
[47:34] tongues and somebody else interprets
[47:37] that is the order of scripture somebody
[47:39] else now look at this so buly Paul after
[47:43] the service two things happen brother
[47:45] bramman
[47:46] prophesy this later on happened in the
[47:48] service brother B Paul brother Billy
[47:50] Paul in his testimony he's walking so
[47:53] now right according to B Paul's
[47:56] testimony as brother bham and Bully were
[47:58] walking back to their hotel brother
[48:01] brandham perceived that something was
[48:03] troubling bully and he asked bully
[48:06] what's
[48:08] wrong oh nothing there bully replied
[48:12] after a few steps after a few steps
[48:15] brother Brenham asked again what's
[48:18] trouble you
[48:20] Paul well Daddy said bully you heard
[48:24] that message of
[48:26] and interpretation there so bully
[48:28] realized it followed scripture it was a
[48:33] a and so it's nothing wrong with it it
[48:36] followed
[48:37] scripture well Daddy said bully you
[48:41] heard that message of tongue and
[48:42] interpretation there so what replied
[48:46] brother
[48:47] Brenham but Dad you know you said that
[48:52] the angel of the Lord told you that see
[48:55] would die between 2 and 3 in the
[49:00] morning notice brother brenham's reply
[49:04] so typical of brother brandham he
[49:06] answered he answers and yet does not
[49:10] speak against the tongues and
[49:12] interpretation so he's very clever he's
[49:14] very wise wise as a serpent when we when
[49:17] you get a friend at work you do you
[49:20] always use a bit of wisdom you know so
[49:22] look at brother Brenham didn't want to
[49:23] pull them off and say they what
[49:26] well all I can say is Paul all I can say
[49:31] that the Lord has not told me any
[49:33] different from thus sayth the Lord that
[49:35] he will die between two and three so I I
[49:38] don't know obviously he knew but you
[49:44] know the morning of September 11 911
[49:49] 1965 brother brandham was at the Remada
[49:52] in in phix Phoenix Arizona right about
[49:56] to preach a sermon entitled God's power
[49:58] to transform it was at this time that I
[50:02] witnessed the answer to the question
[50:04] troubling brother Billy Paul so it took
[50:07] a while it just didn't come
[50:09] immediately it was at this time that I
[50:11] saw
[50:12] this right they answered it I was doing
[50:16] oh he says I was on the telephone hookup
[50:19] doing the telephone hookup brother Carl
[50:21] Williams and brother brandham were
[50:23] sitting in the head of the table when I
[50:25] received a phone call from Brother
[50:27] Richard Saran who informed me that his
[50:30] aunt sister Florence had died during the
[50:33] night I walked over and told Brother
[50:36] Brenham and brother
[50:38] call and brother
[50:41] call and brother brandham asked me to
[50:43] find out when she died so I went back
[50:47] and found Brother richen Richard who
[50:49] told me that she had died at 2:45 that
[50:52] morning I went back and told brother
[50:55] Brenham who replied that's exactly what
[50:58] the vision
[51:00] said amen
[51:02] so he he refers he refers let me just
[51:06] read this and then I'll close I will
[51:07] leave it up to you to decide whether the
[51:10] tongues and interpretations were of God
[51:13] or whether it was from someone's
[51:15] zealousness of an anointing that was not
[51:18] thus say the Lord the angel of God had
[51:22] told the prophet of God that she would
[51:25] die between 2: and 3: in the morning she
[51:27] died at 2:45 that morning obviously not
[51:30] that morning but sometime later the
[51:32] message in tongues and interpretation
[51:34] said so when the message of tongues and
[51:36] interpretation in the church came out it
[51:39] said that she would not die and then
[51:42] that's what troubled Billy and then
[51:44] that's obviously a lot of people were
[51:46] now is this a real
[51:48] Prophet you see so so in the message a
[51:51] lot of things will test your faith and
[51:55] why I think God just pressed it on my
[51:57] heart because um I was just talking to a
[52:00] brother during the night and it's our
[52:02] time but it was um was in South Africa
[52:04] and he was relating to me um just some
[52:08] testimonies of what I told him years
[52:12] back he's in the message now for 10
[52:14] years and God guided me in a certain way
[52:17] to meet this person and then I said them
[52:19] word with him and he was baptized and he
[52:21] said to me brother Donnie I can just
[52:23] relate something to you that I'm doing
[52:24] with a lot of people people and I'm
[52:26] telling them that they should read the
[52:29] spoken word they should stick only with
[52:31] brother brandham because in the church
[52:35] under brother brenham's preaching
[52:37] somebody gets an anointing to speak in
[52:39] tongues and somebody interprets and sist
[52:41] he will not die it's while brother
[52:44] brandham is there brother brandham is
[52:45] not here so how much more can Satan use
[52:48] any person to deceive you so so
[52:53] so I think the safe thing for us is just
[52:56] to stick with brother brandham you know
[52:59] just just stick with brother brandham
[53:00] you'll be very safe that way um um we've
[53:03] seen a lot of things I don't want to
[53:05] mention it from here um I'm just glad
[53:07] that now the burden is a little bit off
[53:09] my heart it was quite heavy um just to
[53:12] maybe tell you that you know uh
[53:16] because brother brandham it's it's it's
[53:19] it's it's it's it's we we're not dealing
[53:21] with we say brother brandham but it's
[53:23] not brother brandham it's just the piece
[53:25] you know so it's actually God it was
[53:27] actually God so so I I can say a few
[53:30] things and read a few quotes and have an
[53:32] interpretation but brother bronnie
[53:34] brother Donnie he didn't say in the days
[53:36] of the voice of brother Donnie he said
[53:37] in the days of the voice of the seven
[53:39] Angel no matter how long I've been in a
[53:41] message no matter how or whatever no
[53:43] matter how much I know I know nothing
[53:46] you go back and you read brother
[53:48] brandham brother Donnie knows nothing I
[53:50] I know absolutely nothing a little few
[53:52] things we do we say the pastor is going
[53:54] to come up is preaching somebody says
[53:56] something we just we're just echoing and
[53:58] saying something and repeating a quote
[54:01] but tomorrow I can
[54:03] fall I was relating to my wife early
[54:06] this morning this can happen there was a
[54:08] trap set I was telling brother
[54:11] yesterday I was telling Brother Andy
[54:13] yesterday about this man zimi Sager that
[54:15] how he was sitting in front of a piano
[54:18] and the anointing dropped on him and
[54:19] he's never played piano before and he
[54:22] started playing the piano and his
[54:24] ministry of song Led many people to
[54:27] Jesus Christ and I watched the FBI
[54:30] documentary because they trapped him
[54:33] with a with a human it's three things
[54:35] brother Brenham says You must watch out
[54:36] for money human and popularity watch out
[54:39] for those three things more so if you're
[54:41] a minister and they trapped him with a
[54:44] middle one he was quite Rich millions
[54:47] and millions of songs all around the
[54:49] world Jimmy swager I watched the video
[54:51] of of of of the of the documentary when
[54:53] they trapped him with a female a
[54:55] prostitute Jimmy swager and the FBI in
[54:58] that documentary said this man was
[55:00] trapped it was before the time that we
[55:02] had close circuit TV cameras cctvs but
[55:05] they had a camera installed at a
[55:06] particular hotel to see him getting out
[55:08] of the car with this woman and that's
[55:10] how and it was set up the FBI when they
[55:13] did the investigation they found out he
[55:15] was set up by Christian
[55:17] people what does what happened so I said
[55:19] to my wife P um Jimmy swager did not
[55:24] have an angel
[55:26] but didn't they set the trap for brother
[55:28] Bram and when the two men walked in
[55:31] before they walked in the angel said to
[55:33] him they've got a trap set for you I
[55:35] don't have an angel so don't follow me
[55:39] tomorrow brother Donnie is going to fall
[55:42] then you go gone I don't have an angel a
[55:45] trap said and I will fall in the Trap
[55:47] before the trap came the angel walked
[55:48] into the room and said to brother R
[55:50] that's a trap so Jimmy swag F all I want
[55:53] to say we don't have Angels there was an
[55:56] angel that came and told Brother
[55:58] brandham there's a trap set for you they
[55:59] walked in brother brandham is calm he
[56:01] said the angel just visited me now and
[56:03] he said this and that people you know
[56:05] they repented and they came into the
[56:07] message those two people they said who
[56:09] brother he told us he said to us we're
[56:11] not going to have see I don't have we
[56:14] don't have Angels there's a trap set for
[56:16] you by the grace of God we stay humble
[56:19] we pray we ask the Lord but all I can
[56:21] say brothers and sisters the safest
[56:23] place for all of us is the message of
[56:26] the hour you know so just just to
[56:28] encourage you we are we are a young
[56:30] Church you're growing uh it's very safe
[56:33] for you to to to to to to hold on to
[56:35] everything that brother Bram says this
[56:37] brother in his testimony last night to
[56:39] me he said to me brother Donnie you know
[56:43] how many things I've gone through in
[56:44] this 10 years in the
[56:46] message you know how many things and
[56:48] every time when I came to you for an
[56:51] answer you said to me you never have an
[56:53] answer I you just told me go read the
[56:56] spoken word go read the spoken word
[56:58] that's all you told me he said to me
[56:59] brother Donnie that was the best advice
[57:02] you have ever given me you know so all I
[57:05] can tell people uh uh you know just by
[57:08] the grace of God this morning I've seen
[57:10] we've seen many things we've seen
[57:12] pastors I was relating I don't want to
[57:14] say those things many things happening
[57:16] and the safest thing is stick with
[57:20] brother brandham that's all I can tell
[57:22] you stick with him read the spoken words
[57:25] listen to the sermons read the spoken
[57:26] word that's all I can say you you you'll
[57:28] find later on why why it is very safe to
[57:32] do that and um I trust that it's it's
[57:34] just it's just um something on your
[57:36] heart and and I was praying this morning
[57:38] after the testimony and and I couldn't
[57:39] go to sleep and I I had to pray in my in
[57:42] my lounge there and and and the Lord
[57:44] just just just pressed very hard on me
[57:46] to share it with you so I trust that you
[57:48] you still love me but um you know it's
[57:50] just that um you know by the grace of
[57:52] God we we've had we've got the greatest
[57:54] thing here we've got that Mighty stone
[57:57] that came out of the mountains shouting
[57:59] Grace Grace that crush the image you
[58:01] know we have we have we have zabel's
[58:03] Vision we have all those great we've got
[58:05] the wheel in the middle of the wheel we
[58:08] you if I mean this two weeks I was just
[58:10] reading the small books um the prophets
[58:13] hegi zaniah all those prophets those
[58:16] prophecies it's all brother brandham
[58:17] it's all brother brandham it's all that
[58:19] they all speaking of this so just before
[58:21] the minister
[58:22] comes um I trust you you you you just go
[58:26] back to brother Bram it's the safest
[58:28] place you know our trials everything
[58:30] that we go through as he said to Rosella
[58:32] in the Hebrews book it's all
[58:34] predestinated you know it's all
[58:36] predestinated and when you then go back
[58:39] and you read brother bram's sermons you
[58:42] climb in to the unknown and you go back
[58:45] in past time and you get your strength
[58:49] while you're in that trial because you
[58:50] you are under that anointing that same
[58:52] anointing of the one that can transcend
[58:54] in time and walk back and he moves back
[58:56] in time he moves forward in time there
[58:58] is there's even a
[59:00] prophecy of this creature in the Book of
[59:03] Revelations and John spoke about this
[59:07] creature and he says this creature had
[59:09] eyes in the front of him he had eyes
[59:12] inside of him and he had eyes at the
[59:14] back of him and John saw this creature
[59:16] John saw this this this great anointing
[59:19] on this creature and John wanted to fall
[59:21] in front of this creature so the Bible
[59:22] speaks of creature but it symbols
[59:25] and this creature told him don't worship
[59:27] me I'm one of your fellow brothers I
[59:30] won't you know obviously who I'm talking
[59:32] about that creature was brother Brenham
[59:35] he could transcend move Beyond before
[59:37] time then he can speak of what's
[59:39] happening and he can move back you can
[59:41] move forward that was that creature so
[59:43] so brothers and sisters um I always tell
[59:47] people if you do not know who brother
[59:49] brandham is you don't know anything
[59:52] about a message you need to know who
[59:54] Moses is otherwise you will contest
[59:56] Moses the whole time you will find fault
[59:59] with Moses you will say you are you
[1:00:00] you're not the only one that's what will
[1:00:02] happen so so just just stick with
[1:00:05] brother brandham you know he's that he's
[1:00:07] that you there's hundreds and thousands
[1:00:10] of Prophecies of creatures and those
[1:00:12] those prophets they were under the
[1:00:13] anointing but but there's lots of things
[1:00:16] that we think will happen the Lord will
[1:00:19] make it happen it's already happened
[1:00:21] brother brandom was the veil that God
[1:00:23] used
[1:00:25] a lot of things happen under BR bram's
[1:00:27] Veil that people think is still going to
[1:00:28] happen so so um you know I just I just
[1:00:32] pray for me um you know um you know that
[1:00:36] I just be more
[1:00:37] sincere uh you know uh we just be more

[1:04:22] his wife and some of the family have
[1:04:24] come down uh they don't know I haven't

[1:04:28] remember our brother you know pastors
[1:04:31] the church up there in Alam you know and
[1:04:33] there's always a lot of uncertainty at
[1:04:35] times like this where one day someone's

[1:06:54] hands in Jesus Christ's name
[1:06:58] amen amen I just like to read one
[1:07:00] scripture from uh from the book of uh St
[1:07:03] John in chapter
[1:07:05] 7 and I just want
[1:07:07] to I want to just go into a a a just a
[1:07:10] bit of a subject you know on it a a few
[1:07:14] times
[1:07:16] in and in some areas he he preached uh
[1:07:19] so so I want to preach on thirst thirst
[1:07:22] today and we know you you you the
[1:07:24] prophet preached thirsting for life he
[1:07:26] preached thirst I just want to take a
[1:07:27] few quotes from there as well but I just
[1:07:29] want to read some scriptures here so
[1:07:31] John chapter 7 and and ver
[1:07:35] 37-39 and it says in the last day that
[1:07:40] great day of the feast Jesus stood and
[1:07:42] cried saying if any man thirst let him
[1:07:44] come unto me and drink he that believeth
[1:07:46] on me as the scriptures hath said out of
[1:07:49] his belly shall flow rivers of Living
[1:07:52] Water but this spake key of the spirit
[1:07:56] that they that believe which they that
[1:07:58] believe on him should receive for the
[1:08:00] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[1:08:02] Jesus was not yet glorified amen may the
[1:08:05] Lord bless his word you may you may have
[1:08:07] your seats so now I want to I want to
[1:08:10] speak on this and and and brother
[1:08:12] Brandon would pick up this one word
[1:08:14] thirst because we understand this the
[1:08:17] Christian life is all about meeting
[1:08:19] meeting a desire a thirst you know and
[1:08:22] you know in every soul and I was
[1:08:24] thinking especially as brother Dominic
[1:08:26] he was he was preaching there sharing
[1:08:28] the burdens of his of his heart and his
[1:08:31] experiences I I I begin to think and
[1:08:33] Ponder why do why do people begin off on
[1:08:37] the way and then they go off the way
[1:08:39] into things that are very very different
[1:08:41] to what the prophet laid out because we
[1:08:44] see that people may you know as brother
[1:08:46] Donnie said people may quote brother
[1:08:47] Bram they may put scriptures and quotes
[1:08:50] together but they end up with a picture
[1:08:52] that is very different to the picture
[1:08:54] that's been originally laid out by the
[1:08:56] prophet and I was wondering why this
[1:08:58] would be because for me when I heard
[1:09:00] this message The Thirst in my soul was
[1:09:03] quenched I became satisfied with the
[1:09:06] drink that I was drinking the fountain
[1:09:08] that I was drinking from and nothing
[1:09:10] else could satisfy that thirst but
[1:09:12] drinking from the fountain that's been
[1:09:14] opened up in this day so I was thinking
[1:09:16] why would people drink from this
[1:09:19] Fountain and then turn to another
[1:09:20] Fountain you know as Jeremiah he laid
[1:09:23] the complt in front of you know in front
[1:09:25] of Israel you know brother B would take
[1:09:27] that scripture and he' preach a sermon
[1:09:29] called broken system and God told
[1:09:31] Jeremiah that the people instead of
[1:09:34] drinking from this artisian well they
[1:09:36] had formed themselves systems and they
[1:09:39] were drinking from aist and aist is a
[1:09:42] man-made tank it's not it's not a nature
[1:09:45] you know it's not a nature but man has
[1:09:47] to physically build a tank and they
[1:09:50] drinking from that tank and so you know
[1:09:53] both hold water you know an artisian
[1:09:55] well has water in it so does a system
[1:09:58] but one is god-given one is man-made and
[1:10:01] so there's a very difference you know
[1:10:03] brother bam would say like a assist you
[1:10:04] can get bugs in there you get wiggle
[1:10:06] tails and all the stuff that's washed
[1:10:08] off the roof comes into the system you
[1:10:11] know there's still water in there but
[1:10:12] it's mixed with all this other
[1:10:15] stuff and so you know that was that was
[1:10:19] Israel's problem they had fashioned
[1:10:21] themselves systems to drink from and
[1:10:23] drinking from the pure word of God and
[1:10:26] living by the pure word of God and so I
[1:10:28] was wondering now why on Earth would
[1:10:32] people do that why would people make
[1:10:34] their own denominational system and I
[1:10:36] can say that even even when people you
[1:10:39] know put you know they they take this
[1:10:42] quote and they take this quote they take
[1:10:43] this scripture they take this scripture
[1:10:45] and I said the picture they end up with
[1:10:47] the conclusion is miles away from the
[1:10:50] from the conclusion that brother Brandon
[1:10:52] bought and the life that is produced is
[1:10:54] very different to the life that was on
[1:10:55] display in the prophet and it's because
[1:10:58] their thirst hasn't truly been
[1:11:01] quenched amen and I'll show this in the
[1:11:03] scripture if you like to turn with me to
[1:11:06] Revelations chapter
[1:11:08] 7 because there's two classes of people
[1:11:11] upon the Earth those that their thirst
[1:11:14] has been quenched and those that their
[1:11:16] thirst has not been quenched there's two
[1:11:20] groups and we see here
[1:11:24] Revelations chapter 7 John in this
[1:11:26] chapter he sees the 144,000 he sees the
[1:11:30] you know he sees the fullest virgin you
[1:11:32] know he sees the church that have come
[1:11:34] out of tribulation he doesn't the bride
[1:11:36] is not in this
[1:11:37] picture Okay so he so he's seeing two
[1:11:41] glasses of people and I'm not going to
[1:11:42] read the whole chapter but you see as as
[1:11:45] John he sees he sees the 144,000 and
[1:11:49] because he's a Jew he can identify them
[1:11:50] in their tribes so he knows these ones
[1:11:53] but then he comes down if we go to verse
[1:11:55] 12 he says so this is
[1:11:58] just um I'm just I'm just coming into
[1:12:00] the halfway through the chapter but but
[1:12:02] you go away and read it it says saying
[1:12:05] amen blessing and glory and wisdom and
[1:12:08] Thanksgiving and honor and power and
[1:12:10] might be unto our God forever and ever
[1:12:12] amen and one of the elders answered
[1:12:14] saying unto me what are th these which
[1:12:18] arrayed in white robes and whence came
[1:12:20] they and I said unto them sir thou
[1:12:22] knowest said John didn't understand who
[1:12:24] these were and he said to me these are
[1:12:27] they which came out of Great Tribulation
[1:12:29] and have washed their robes and made
[1:12:32] them white in the blood of the Lamb
[1:12:34] therefore are they Before the Throne of
[1:12:36] God and serve him day and night in his
[1:12:38] Temple and they that sth on the throne
[1:12:40] shall dwell among them they shall hunger
[1:12:43] no more neither shall they thirst no
[1:12:45] more neither shall the sun light on them
[1:12:47] nor any heat for the lamb which is in
[1:12:50] the midst of the throne shall feed them
[1:12:52] and shall live lead them unto living
[1:12:55] Fountains of waters and God shall wipe
[1:12:58] wipe away all tears from their eyes so
[1:13:01] he read there in John chapter 7 he says
[1:13:03] come unto me ye that thirst and I will
[1:13:05] give I'll give you I'll give you a drink
[1:13:08] I'll give you something that can satisfy
[1:13:09] this thirst but then these people had
[1:13:12] not their thirst had not been quenched
[1:13:14] until after the white Throne judgment
[1:13:16] when they received eternal life so
[1:13:19] there's a group upon the Earth and you
[1:13:20] can see the apostles you see all the
[1:13:22] True Believer us down they had they had
[1:13:25] come to the fountain or the fountain had
[1:13:26] come to them they had drunken from that
[1:13:29] Fountain and their thirst had been
[1:13:31] quenched their thirst had been satisfied
[1:13:33] but there's another group here that
[1:13:35] believed in Jesus they preached the
[1:13:38] gospel I'd say some of them even quoted
[1:13:40] the message but their thirst had not
[1:13:42] truly been quenched in this life I tell
[1:13:46] there's a there's a fountain open where
[1:13:48] the thirst of Every Soul can be quenched
[1:13:50] in this life amen so
[1:13:55] there's two classes here and we see in
[1:13:58] Revelation so notice also in this
[1:14:00] chapter these are they which came out of
[1:14:02] Great Tribulation and washed their robes
[1:14:05] and made them white in the blood of the
[1:14:07] Lamb so they had to they had to
[1:14:08] physically go and do it they had to give
[1:14:11] their lives in order to receive eternal
[1:14:13] life they had to do it you understand
[1:14:16] but then in Revelations 19 speaking of
[1:14:19] the Bride let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:14:21] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:14:23] of the Lamb has come and his wife has
[1:14:25] made herself ready and we're living in
[1:14:26] that season and to her was granted that
[1:14:29] she should be a Raiden fine linen clean
[1:14:31] and white for the fine linen is the
[1:14:34] righteousness of saints it's just
[1:14:35] granted to the bride am mean here was
[1:14:38] here was a prophet saying I just want to
[1:14:40] dress if this if the bride would just
[1:14:42] stand still enough I want to dress her
[1:14:43] in the word I want to dress her in the
[1:14:45] righteousness of saints so here was a
[1:14:47] man that was fully equipped amen the
[1:14:50] prophet was fully equipped to dress a
[1:14:51] people amen that they could go into the
[1:14:54] presence of God no condemnation no worry
[1:14:57] am I going to make it amen have I met
[1:15:00] the requirements God gave the
[1:15:01] requirements everything we have need of
[1:15:03] has been given in the message of the
[1:15:05] hour to dress us hallelujah that's why
[1:15:07] we can go on a Rapture into the presence
[1:15:10] of God because sin can't go into the
[1:15:12] presence of God condemnation can't go
[1:15:14] into the presence of God Amen only a
[1:15:17] sinless perfect people can go on a
[1:15:20] Rapture and God before he puts something
[1:15:23] honor people he gives them what they
[1:15:25] need to meet the requirement amen and
[1:15:28] that's why he sent he sent Malachi 4
[1:15:30] upon the Earth he preached a pure word
[1:15:33] there's no man-made things mixed in that
[1:15:34] word the Revelation is perfect in that
[1:15:36] message and by receiving that a purifies
[1:15:39] everything out of us hallelujah that we
[1:15:41] can stand as pure as God is pure as
[1:15:45] sinless as God is sinless hallelujah
[1:15:47] that's what this message produces amen
[1:15:50] there's therefore no condemnation that
[1:15:52] them which are INR Christ and walk after
[1:15:54] the spirit Paul says there's no
[1:15:55] condemnation we can say we are one of
[1:15:57] them Hallelujah I trust you can say
[1:16:00] you're one of them amen so it's just
[1:16:02] granted to her that she should be ER
[1:16:04] raid in fine linen and you come a point
[1:16:07] in life I trust you've experienced where
[1:16:09] you say this message just fits me
[1:16:12] Hallelujah this word just fits me just
[1:16:14] right amen no doubt it's like you know
[1:16:18] Elisha with
[1:16:21] Elijah Elijah put his mantle upon Elisha
[1:16:24] but there was a bit of time where where
[1:16:27] Elisha had to be molded to fit the
[1:16:29] mantle it wasn't the mantle had to be re
[1:16:32] readjusted and changed it was the Elisha
[1:16:35] had to be adjusted that the mantle
[1:16:36] fitted him perfectly that the ministry
[1:16:38] of Elijah could continue and it's the
[1:16:41] same thing with us you know God doesn't
[1:16:43] change when there's a disaster comes
[1:16:45] along people say where is God why has he
[1:16:48] left us God didn't leave no one man
[1:16:51] leaves God Amen amen so they say oh this
[1:16:54] is God's fault no it's man's fault why
[1:16:57] cuz man chose to go in a certain
[1:16:58] direction because God built us with a
[1:17:01] thirst every every person has a
[1:17:06] thirst but there are people in this day
[1:17:11] that have that thirst
[1:17:13] quenched Hallelujah now he says this he
[1:17:16] says many times this is from the message
[1:17:18] thirst in 1965 and Tucson he says many
[1:17:21] times God gets us and tight Corners
[1:17:24] where we have to look up sometimes we
[1:17:27] even have to get on our back in the
[1:17:29] hospital or bed somewhere so we can look
[1:17:31] up to see where the great blessings of
[1:17:33] God comes from now the word I want to
[1:17:36] speak from tonight one word out of the
[1:17:38] Bible that is found in the second verse
[1:17:40] thirst the word of thirst I was looking
[1:17:42] in the dictionary when I was looking up
[1:17:45] this word I was I was thinking about a
[1:17:47] sermon one time pardon me I preached on
[1:17:50] thirsting
[1:17:51] afterlife and I took it out of the
[1:17:53] Psalms 2 when David said thy statutes I
[1:17:56] believe are more precious to me than
[1:17:57] life when I was looking and thinking
[1:18:00] about that word thirst so I looked up in
[1:18:03] the dictionary to see what it means and
[1:18:05] here's what Webster says it's a painful
[1:18:07] desire a painful when you want something
[1:18:10] so bad until it becomes painful to you
[1:18:13] now it's not an unusual thing to thirst
[1:18:17] It's Not Unusual to have a painful
[1:18:18] desire for something thirst is a natural
[1:18:21] thing it's just simply something that
[1:18:24] God has given us that we could to give
[1:18:27] us a desire for something sometimes God
[1:18:30] has also has to um sometimes God has
[1:18:34] also has given you a control tower
[1:18:36] something that sits inside of you that
[1:18:39] controls these different desires and
[1:18:41] this thirst this control tower that sits
[1:18:45] in a man's heart is something that God
[1:18:48] give him to warn him of desires that's
[1:18:50] needful for him now there's two two
[1:18:53] different types of thirst there's a
[1:18:55] thirst physically and there is a thirst
[1:18:58] Also
[1:19:00] spiritually amen so there's two
[1:19:02] different types of
[1:19:04] thirst
[1:19:06] and but the thing is now with a thirst
[1:19:10] and I just I I also Googled what a
[1:19:13] thirst means and and this I'm not sure
[1:19:14] what dictionary but it says so so so so
[1:19:18] brother say so it's a painful desire
[1:19:20] it's a feeling of needing or wanting to
[1:19:23] drink something and it's due to a lack
[1:19:26] of liquid needed to sustain life this is
[1:19:29] what a thirst is what a thirst produces
[1:19:32] and so a thirst now we all have a thirst
[1:19:36] there's a spiritual thirst so I'm
[1:19:38] probably just going to spend time
[1:19:39] drinking
[1:19:42] this so there's a thirst that we have
[1:19:45] and now brother baram he he says in many
[1:19:48] places he says how dare someone take
[1:19:50] that thirst that God has given them and
[1:19:53] try to quench it with something else and
[1:19:55] so a thirst it's like a if you have a
[1:19:58] desire for a nice cool glass of water
[1:20:02] but then all all you have is a nice warm
[1:20:04] glass of Coke you will still drink the
[1:20:07] coke to try and quench The Thirst but it
[1:20:09] won't satisfy like the water amen and if
[1:20:13] you can't get to the water if your
[1:20:15] thirst is bad enough you'll take
[1:20:16] whatever you can to try and satisfy that
[1:20:19] thirst and people brother BR I I I'm not
[1:20:22] sure if it's quite or from a testimony
[1:20:25] maybe a qu he might said it somewhere he
[1:20:27] said now if someone's hungry enough
[1:20:29] they'll feed from the garbage Camp if
[1:20:32] they can't find real food and you and
[1:20:34] you'll find that with people they go to
[1:20:36] church they have a desire they have a
[1:20:38] thirst and they know that God is real
[1:20:40] and they'll go to a denomination because
[1:20:43] the Bible says there'd be a famine in
[1:20:44] this land and also says that young men
[1:20:47] and young women will not find the result
[1:20:50] not find the uh will not find what is
[1:20:52] needed
[1:20:53] I'll read it to you if we go to Amos
[1:20:59] 8
[1:21:01] see this message is
[1:21:04] God and if you if you thirsted and you
[1:21:08] found and God found you and you've and
[1:21:10] and you've heard this message it
[1:21:12] satisfied you amen this message was made
[1:21:15] to satisfy your thirst you were made to
[1:21:18] receive this word amen and I'll
[1:21:20] guarantee you nothing else will satisfy
[1:21:23] you amen you can go feed you can go try
[1:21:26] some charismatic thing some Pentecostal
[1:21:28] thing you can go to some camp in the
[1:21:30] message even and it won't satisfy you
[1:21:32] until you come back to the Fountain amen
[1:21:35] you know people like the suiz me
[1:21:37] documentary look what happened to the
[1:21:39] guy eating the
[1:21:41] McDonald's amen and but when he went
[1:21:44] back to a healthy diet that his body was
[1:21:45] really crying for he became healthy
[1:21:48] again you take that into the spiritual
[1:21:51] side of things you say well I'm just
[1:21:53] looking for something new I say have you
[1:21:55] really drunk from the
[1:21:57] fountain amen have you really drunk from
[1:22:00] the fountain because if you've drunken
[1:22:02] from the fountain you say well this is
[1:22:04] the best thing ever and it is why would
[1:22:06] I look for something else amen if
[1:22:09] something's anchored in your soul this
[1:22:10] message came from Heaven it's not
[1:22:12] brother Brandon speaking but God
[1:22:14] speaking Amen brother Bram said in one
[1:22:16] place early on he says he says when the
[1:22:18] anointing comes I'm the voice of God to
[1:22:20] you and then he repeats he says this
[1:22:22] second time was under
[1:22:24] inspiration amen so so it wasn't him
[1:22:26] really saying that but was God actually
[1:22:28] saying tell the people that amen cuz he
[1:22:31] was said if you can get the people to
[1:22:32] believe
[1:22:33] you amen Moses you go read early in
[1:22:36] Exodus Moses had to get the people to
[1:22:38] believe him
[1:22:40] amen Amos
[1:22:42] 81 behold the day come sayith the Lord
[1:22:49] God that I will send a famine in the
[1:22:51] land not a Famine of bread nor a thirst
[1:22:54] for
[1:22:56] water but of the hearing of the words of
[1:22:58] the Lord and they shall Wander from sea
[1:23:01] to
[1:23:02] Sea and from the north even to the East
[1:23:05] and they shall run to and fro to seek
[1:23:07] the word of the Lord and shall not find
[1:23:11] it in that day shall the fair virgins
[1:23:14] and young men faint for
[1:23:17] thirst amen he didn't say there'll be a
[1:23:21] famine for Bibles or famine for
[1:23:25] Christianity or teaching but hearing the
[1:23:28] word of God there'll be a famine amen
[1:23:32] and I can say by the authority of God's
[1:23:35] word we are living in that hour there is
[1:23:37] a famine but brother Brown preached a
[1:23:39] sermon spiritual food and du season and
[1:23:42] he went to Elijah when Elijah was taken
[1:23:44] there was a famine in the land but he
[1:23:46] was fed in a secret place and he's
[1:23:48] saying that is you he's saying we have
[1:23:51] spiritual food
[1:23:53] but there's a famine in the land that's
[1:23:55] why God told him stay at the Tabernacle
[1:23:57] and store up food store up food tap load
[1:24:00] after tape load store up food because he
[1:24:03] was looking now there's going to come a
[1:24:05] famine in lady OA but there's a source
[1:24:07] of strength there's a there's a fountain
[1:24:09] amen that's being established upon the
[1:24:11] Earth amen it's not the physical tape
[1:24:14] it's the voice behind the voice amen the
[1:24:17] voice behind the voice that we feed upon
[1:24:20] Hallelujah so now he's saying he's
[1:24:21] saying there's a famine but I'm going to
[1:24:23] store food up this is why when I think
[1:24:26] upon these things I treasure this word
[1:24:27] so much more cuz he says young men you
[1:24:30] think people who are the people most
[1:24:32] suited to travel not the young not the
[1:24:35] old it's the young men and the fair
[1:24:39] virgins that's the that's the people in
[1:24:40] the prime of their physical youth he's
[1:24:43] saying people who are built to travel
[1:24:45] will not find it amen that's why I say
[1:24:48] thank God it found me thank God this
[1:24:51] fitted me it was made for was sent for
[1:24:53] me Hallelujah I heard I heard over the
[1:24:55] convention I think brother Marcus maybe
[1:24:57] he said it even here our name is in the
[1:24:59] Bible Well you was in the Bible behold I
[1:25:02] send you Elijah the prophet I send you
[1:25:04] you're going to say well who's the you
[1:25:05] it's me Hallelujah and he sent him that
[1:25:09] I wouldn't perish in this in this desert
[1:25:11] this spiritual Wasteland that we find
[1:25:13] ourselves living in amen but you can
[1:25:16] only have that realization if you've
[1:25:18] really
[1:25:19] drunk if you spiritually really you say
[1:25:23] well I've heard the sermons and I've
[1:25:24] I've read the books just drink from
[1:25:27] it and and that's why I was mentioning
[1:25:29] the super siiz me
[1:25:31] documentary look at the effect it
[1:25:34] has the McDonald's had a bad effect on
[1:25:36] him good food would have a good effect
[1:25:39] on him you take that spiritually look at
[1:25:42] the effect that this message spiritually
[1:25:45] has upon you amen what one day I was
[1:25:48] walking in darkness amen I knew there
[1:25:50] was some Jesus somewhere in here as real
[1:25:52] but I had no idea where we were or no
[1:25:55] idea who I was just just oh born in New
[1:25:58] Zealand this is what new zealanders do
[1:25:59] you just go and do what you know but
[1:26:01] then one day the fountain found me and
[1:26:04] once I was spiritually dead but now I'm
[1:26:06] alive Hallelujah that's the best kind of
[1:26:09] diet Amen to actually make someone to
[1:26:11] pass from Death to life that's why look
[1:26:14] at and look what it does in our
[1:26:16] families
[1:26:18] amen you won't find I tell you what real
[1:26:21] believers
[1:26:22] you see real message homes where there
[1:26:25] love and husband knows his position wife
[1:26:29] knows her position the children come
[1:26:30] under that atmosphere of Love there in
[1:26:33] the home you won't find it anywhere else
[1:26:36] psychology can't can't give it to you
[1:26:38] Joel oin will sure not give it to you Dr
[1:26:40] Dobson sure can't give it to you amen
[1:26:43] any cares man a bookstore won't give it
[1:26:46] to you amen if you read those things
[1:26:50] filter it through the word for this hour
[1:26:52] whatever you do don't just swallow it up
[1:26:54] because there's they say Jesus in there
[1:26:56] you fil it through the message of the
[1:26:58] hour whatever you do amen but that minor
[1:27:01] book still won't give it to you this
[1:27:04] Fountain this fountain that quenches The
[1:27:06] Thirst of every man and woman and child
[1:27:08] who want to drink that is the only
[1:27:11] thing I've been I haven't been too many
[1:27:14] places but I've been to Papa New Guinea
[1:27:15] I've been to vanu I've seen churches
[1:27:17] around here in New Zealand different
[1:27:19] denominations I've been to Australia
[1:27:21] I've been into South African when I was
[1:27:24] young but to come and see Believers and
[1:27:27] it doesn't matter if they're from vanu
[1:27:29] or they're from Pap New Guinea or from
[1:27:31] South Africa or from going I went to
[1:27:33] Vancouver went to you know Cloverdale
[1:27:35] you know all any believers I found that
[1:27:38] produces the same quality hallu the same
[1:27:42] character Hallelujah the same and
[1:27:44] normally you see someone who's real trim
[1:27:46] and buff and all these things people say
[1:27:48] what are they taking what are they
[1:27:49] feeding on physically
[1:27:52] sometimes we should look at each other
[1:27:53] and say what are they feeding on what is
[1:27:56] this person eating spiritually I want
[1:27:58] what they're
[1:27:59] eating amen it goes beyond oh this
[1:28:02] Doctrine this Doctrine see what the word
[1:28:04] is
[1:28:05] producing amen the doctrine is just the
[1:28:08] bark on the tree to protect the life but
[1:28:11] if the tree is not drawing water out
[1:28:14] amen and expressing itself back to God
[1:28:17] that's just a dead
[1:28:19] tree amen hallelujah
[1:28:22] just
[1:28:23] drink
[1:28:26] amen so a thirst now a thirst is what
[1:28:30] everyone
[1:28:31] has now but you notice he says this and
[1:28:35] he careth for you in 1960 why do people
[1:28:39] do the things they do in the world why
[1:28:40] are they try why are they thirsting and
[1:28:42] trying to you know drink certain things
[1:28:46] it's because what people feed on or what
[1:28:50] people drink from it's they they go to
[1:28:53] that Source it's because they find
[1:28:55] comfort in that Source amen they find
[1:28:58] comfort and what they just like a cool
[1:29:00] cool glass of water when you drink it
[1:29:02] you actually are receiving this is
[1:29:04] comforting
[1:29:05] me
[1:29:09] amen he says this here he says and when
[1:29:12] they drink they try to drink it away
[1:29:14] just a few drinks and then it brings
[1:29:16] some more drinks and after a while they
[1:29:18] end up an alcoholic and sometimes to be
[1:29:21] popular they watch television and on the
[1:29:23] street and smoking the last thing a
[1:29:25] woman has done in the 20th century is
[1:29:27] when women started smoking cigarettes
[1:29:29] that's the greatest fifth columnist this
[1:29:31] nation's ever seen it breaks morals it's
[1:29:35] it sends these institutions out here
[1:29:37] full of insanity people it sends
[1:29:40] hospitals full of tubercular cancer
[1:29:41] cases and everything developing from it
[1:29:45] and yet they do it to get
[1:29:47] Comfort God gave us something to comfort
[1:29:51] us the holy Spirit God's comforter these
[1:29:54] things are only a substitute that'll
[1:29:57] finally lead to a place of rioting and
[1:29:59] cheating and stealing and doing things
[1:30:01] wrong so when you see someone in a
[1:30:04] condition that they shouldn't be in they
[1:30:06] are trying to find comfort in the things
[1:30:10] that they are doing so don't condemn
[1:30:12] them for what they're doing just tell
[1:30:14] them there's a better Fountain amen that
[1:30:17] won't lead you down that road there's a
[1:30:19] better way of living there's something
[1:30:21] that TR meets the
[1:30:23] satisfaction that you can drink from
[1:30:26] amen that you can truly draw comfort
[1:30:28] from the right thing not from the wrong
[1:30:29] thing and you see you see it in New
[1:30:31] Zealand here the World Cup the whole
[1:30:33] nation Drew Comfort because they were
[1:30:36] feeding you know you know Steiner had
[1:30:38] the slogan We
[1:30:40] believe We Believe oh what's happened
[1:30:43] now it's turned into a religion we
[1:30:44] believe and they lift up their their
[1:30:47] heroes in prayer
[1:30:49] basically amen and because they're
[1:30:52] feeding on that thing and because we won
[1:30:55] it it gave the whole nation
[1:30:57] Comfort the nation can rest easy because
[1:31:00] our our their Gods Not My Gods the only
[1:31:03] game I ever watched was in was in Fox no
[1:31:07] uh Levin McDonald's waiting to get food
[1:31:09] on there that's that's all I saw I can't
[1:31:12] remember even who was playing but
[1:31:16] anyway those people are drawing comfort
[1:31:19] from that thing you know I remember one
[1:31:22] of the last World Cups the the the the
[1:31:25] semifinal you know when we lost to
[1:31:27] France I was working in a kitchen at Uni
[1:31:31] and as we were you know and and the
[1:31:33] commentary was on the radio and as the
[1:31:36] final moment of drawing to a close you
[1:31:40] just feel like anger just come down on
[1:31:43] everyone and when we lost everyone was
[1:31:46] angry I never experienced it before in
[1:31:48] my
[1:31:49] life the whole nation became angry
[1:31:52] because they're trying to draw comfort
[1:31:54] from a victory and the Victory wasn't
[1:31:57] given
[1:32:00] amen but the thing is you can still hey
[1:32:03] I got nothing against sport but if it
[1:32:05] really affects you in that greater way
[1:32:08] you to look at what does it produce in
[1:32:11] me because if it produces a great thing
[1:32:13] in you that means you are feeding off it
[1:32:16] amen you're try to draw comfort from it
[1:32:19] but if you watch to say we won we lose a
[1:32:21] good game whatever more you move on then
[1:32:24] you're not drawing comfort from it you
[1:32:27] understand so
[1:32:30] people people are trying to draw they
[1:32:33] have a
[1:32:34] thirst and they're trying to draw it
[1:32:37] from all kinds of
[1:32:39] things but we
[1:32:41] understand that now when when Jesus
[1:32:45] Jesus in John chapter
[1:32:47] 14 he begins to you know you know those
[1:32:50] those those chapters there where where
[1:32:52] he begins to just speak to his disciples
[1:32:54] and speaks about his going away but he
[1:32:56] won't leave them comfortless I'll come
[1:32:57] to you and and this word
[1:33:01] now this word
[1:33:03] comfortless he says I'll not leave you
[1:33:05] comfortless but I will come to you
[1:33:08] because remember with a thirst when a
[1:33:10] thirst is quenched by something people
[1:33:12] identify with what they're feeding upon
[1:33:14] and they become they become
[1:33:17] identified amen you see people in All
[1:33:19] Black's jerseys and they and they watch
[1:33:21] game and every Super whatever you know
[1:33:24] they are drawing and they become
[1:33:26] identified well I have the shirt nothing
[1:33:28] wrong with the shirt I have the banner
[1:33:30] nothing wrong with the banner you know
[1:33:33] there's nothing wrong with rugby but
[1:33:35] people are are feeding upon it such a
[1:33:37] way that that the spirit that's in the
[1:33:39] game comes on them and they begin to
[1:33:42] feed off that thing and they're
[1:33:43] identified they're identified with
[1:33:45] Richie mcor and all these ones and
[1:33:48] that's why the whole nation you know you
[1:33:49] they had the celebration uh parades
[1:33:52] nothing wrong with the celebration
[1:33:53] parade hey there's a great achievement
[1:33:55] to win nothing I'm not taking away from
[1:33:57] them whatsoever but people were so
[1:33:59] caught up this one little girl was in
[1:34:02] the paper that she lost some signed uh
[1:34:05] shirt or something and she was
[1:34:06] inconsolable but then they found the
[1:34:08] shirt and they gave it back to she was
[1:34:09] so happy why because she was Iden I want
[1:34:13] I want those names written that I can
[1:34:15] identify myself with this you see
[1:34:19] because what you draw your what what
[1:34:21] your is satisfied with you become
[1:34:23] identified you see I used to love rock
[1:34:26] and roll
[1:34:27] music I became that was my
[1:34:30] identification I love computer games
[1:34:32] that became my identification I used to
[1:34:34] play all kinds of sports that became my
[1:34:37] identification you see Hollywood all
[1:34:39] these things because I was something in
[1:34:41] in me was feeding was feeding off these
[1:34:44] things you know when David said the Deep
[1:34:45] calls to the deep and brother baram you
[1:34:48] know that that hole that hole just that
[1:34:51] half of a um scripture in there the Deep
[1:34:54] gos to the deep that is this message in
[1:34:56] a nutshell amen that there's a deep
[1:34:59] calling but he says before there can be
[1:35:01] a deep in here there has to be a deep to
[1:35:03] respond there and if there's a longing
[1:35:05] for more of God there's more of God to
[1:35:07] have and if there's a Jesus Christ to
[1:35:09] know that means there has to be a Jesus
[1:35:11] Christ that's real in order to meet that
[1:35:13] desire hallelujah amen so if there's a
[1:35:17] longing in
[1:35:18] you I want to go you know I want to see
[1:35:21] Jesus not because I want to leave this
[1:35:23] world CU evil I just want to see him I
[1:35:25] want to see him as he is that means
[1:35:27] there's a there's a great white you know
[1:35:29] there's a great Throne from to be on
[1:35:31] Amen there's a Jesus to meet
[1:35:34] amen I want to go to the wedding supper
[1:35:37] I want to meet Paul and all these
[1:35:38] different ones and lift up Jesus Christ
[1:35:40] and worship with them it's because
[1:35:42] they're there waiting if there's a
[1:35:44] groaning you see this world's falling
[1:35:46] apart you want to go to be with him it's
[1:35:48] because there's a Paul said if this
[1:35:51] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there's
[1:35:53] one Eternal in the heavens waiting for
[1:35:55] you you already have an eternal
[1:35:57] theophany body waiting for you and
[1:36:00] that's the reason that there's a there's
[1:36:01] a thirst there's a thirst in the in The
[1:36:04] Believer is because there's an eternal
[1:36:07] body to step into should this one be
[1:36:10] dissolved and that's the reason it's not
[1:36:12] you know you brother B says you know one
[1:36:14] place you know sometimes people think
[1:36:16] they just stumble into a meeting they
[1:36:17] get gloriously saved and and it looks
[1:36:20] like it's just all Happ has it oh God
[1:36:21] planned it that way God God knew you
[1:36:24] know you know he says in one place you
[1:36:26] know there's like a whole big convention
[1:36:28] thousands of people only maybe one or
[1:36:30] two
[1:36:31] saved amen and God placed a burden on
[1:36:34] someone's heart and you know you know to
[1:36:36] to arrange the whole thing and put a
[1:36:38] burden on maybe the speaker to come and
[1:36:40] speak and you know he'd be there in
[1:36:42] prayer and you know all these things as
[1:36:45] just for a few
[1:36:47] Souls but it's because there's a deep
[1:36:50] that is calling to deep and that deep is
[1:36:53] dictating this is what I want achieved
[1:36:56] in time amen and that's the reason you
[1:37:00] you say well how am I going to make a
[1:37:02] Rapture if there's a
[1:37:04] deep if there's a deep
[1:37:06] call amen he says about brother and
[1:37:09] sister kid they were in their 80s when
[1:37:10] brother BR was talking about them you
[1:37:12] know and he said what would be their
[1:37:16] desire if we asked them and that's say
[1:37:19] be closer to God because there was a
[1:37:22] deep in them they wanted more of
[1:37:25] him and that transcends to me if if you
[1:37:28] really have a longing don't let the
[1:37:30] devil try and hush that longing whatever
[1:37:32] you do don't let him tell you well it's
[1:37:34] just CU your family does it or just
[1:37:36] because you know everyone's nice and
[1:37:38] this is why I come and all these things
[1:37:40] forget about that if there's something
[1:37:43] in you that wants God as because God is
[1:37:46] calling you and the reason he's calling
[1:37:48] you is because you have a body in the
[1:37:49] heavens that you must step into one of
[1:37:52] these days see Jesus said all that the
[1:37:55] father has given me will come why cuz
[1:37:57] there's the bodies there H Eternal in
[1:37:59] the heavens out of time already present
[1:38:02] amen all we have to do is hear the word
[1:38:04] and it just adds word upon word upon
[1:38:06] word like a baby being formed and
[1:38:08] eventually it comes into its M the
[1:38:10] inside you comes into its maturity and
[1:38:12] it matches what that body looks like the
[1:38:14] two line and you're out of here
[1:38:17] hallelujah that's why that's why we
[1:38:19] should you know he the word listen to
[1:38:22] the message I've only got 10 minutes in
[1:38:24] the car put it on for 10 minutes say
[1:38:26] Lord let me absorb it not in my head but
[1:38:29] in my heart let me absorb this word amen
[1:38:32] just relax and listen say Lord I'm going
[1:38:33] to enjoy hearing the prophet today and
[1:38:36] just enjoy it you say I didn't get too
[1:38:39] much out of it if you enjoy it'll come
[1:38:40] into your subconscious and that's where
[1:38:42] you want it you want it down here you
[1:38:44] don't want it up here because of it's up
[1:38:46] here it'll affect your life even in ways
[1:38:48] you can't imagine Hallelujah this word
[1:38:51] has transforming power in it and that's
[1:38:54] more than just a catchphrase that's a
[1:38:56] reality Hallelujah never forget remember
[1:38:59] this Fountain will produce what is meant
[1:39:02] to produce end time message the prophet
[1:39:05] says meets end time conditions all this
[1:39:08] what 50 years ago end time message meets
[1:39:10] end time conditions amen when brother
[1:39:13] Bram saw it a prophet sees things in its
[1:39:16] maturity but when it's there in time
[1:39:18] it's in its
[1:39:19] infancy amen that's why we you can see
[1:39:21] what you know what the world is doing
[1:39:24] the prophet spoke about it amen we're
[1:39:27] not staggering in
[1:39:28] darkness Hallelujah you even read first
[1:39:31] Thessalonians chapter 5 it's a
[1:39:32] continuation of 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:39:35] 4 he says but children we're not of
[1:39:37] Darkness but we're of the light that
[1:39:39] that day should overcome us as a thief
[1:39:41] so Paul's saying you know perfectly well
[1:39:43] you're not going to be overcome you're
[1:39:46] not going to be Jesus is hey sure he's
[1:39:48] coming as a thief of the night remember
[1:39:50] that but he's coming for you and those
[1:39:53] that are looking for him he will come
[1:39:54] and take amen so so Paul you got to read
[1:39:58] it because the chapter and verse people
[1:40:00] put in after Paul wrote the letters amen
[1:40:03] so sometimes we read chapters we think
[1:40:05] now the thought's changing but many
[1:40:07] times it's a continuation of the same
[1:40:09] thing and so Paul he lays out the
[1:40:11] Rapture the divine order of the Rapture
[1:40:14] the prophet tells us and brother brah
[1:40:16] says that the shout is the message so
[1:40:18] the prophet's placing Us in the word
[1:40:20] this is where you are
[1:40:22] amen and now we become one with that
[1:40:24] word and now we're a living
[1:40:27] voice and then and then he after this he
[1:40:29] says but children you're not of
[1:40:32] Darkness amen Don't Be Afraid
[1:40:36] children don't if there's a
[1:40:38] deep in here there's a deep to
[1:40:43] respond amen if there's a longing you
[1:40:46] say Lord I want to I want to walk I want
[1:40:48] to really walk with you I want to
[1:40:51] sincerely walk with you all the days of
[1:40:52] my life is because there's a deep
[1:40:54] calling to a
[1:40:55] deep in the Scripture it says uh Paul
[1:40:58] says in Romans not one seeks after God
[1:41:01] not one is righteous you read early in
[1:41:03] Romans so there's not anything in our
[1:41:06] Humanity that wants God but there's a
[1:41:09] deep a gene seed of God he put in us
[1:41:11] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:41:13] that is calling for expression brother
[1:41:16] SS crying out for expression and then
[1:41:18] before God found us we try and express
[1:41:20] ourselves and different things because
[1:41:22] there's a longing but then when the
[1:41:25] fountain came I trust when it came your
[1:41:27] way when this word came your way that
[1:41:29] was it amen I found I found my maker I
[1:41:32] found my God he found me
[1:41:37] Hallelujah sure sometimes there's a lot
[1:41:39] of wrestling we got to do amen you got
[1:41:42] to cast you got to this man must die
[1:41:44] Byam said the greatest enemy I have is
[1:41:46] William brandham the devil's already
[1:41:48] been
[1:41:49] defeated amen amen we have to we have to
[1:41:52] die too he says the greatest enemy I
[1:41:55] have is William brandham and he was a
[1:41:58] man he was a man who cast out thousands
[1:42:01] of devils and many times what would
[1:42:03] happen is those Devils he cast out in
[1:42:05] the meeting they would come to his hotel
[1:42:07] room and they would try and have a goard
[1:42:10] him amen he said the greatest enemy I
[1:42:14] have is William brandham that's why Paul
[1:42:17] said We Must Die
[1:42:19] daily amen We Must Die daily you got to
[1:42:22] lay yourself down because in our
[1:42:25] Humanity this flesh was not made to
[1:42:27] serve God this flesh was just made to
[1:42:29] contact God but it's through faith we
[1:42:32] worship God through revelation we
[1:42:34] worship God and this man sometimes I
[1:42:38] don't want to get up in the
[1:42:39] morning I don't feel like reading my
[1:42:42] Bible the flesh man I'm tired I'm busy I
[1:42:46] don't want to hear the message I'm busy
[1:42:48] I got to concentrate on something that's
[1:42:51] this man oh wasn't it always rejoicing
[1:42:54] on the mountain top not all the
[1:42:56] time you see you see the faith chapter
[1:42:59] they were destitute these are these are
[1:43:02] the Saints of the ages that will Marvel
[1:43:04] at them they were destitute they were in
[1:43:07] sheep skins and caves you're hungry
[1:43:09] Afflicted tormented of whom the world is
[1:43:12] not
[1:43:13] worthy and that is the Christian
[1:43:16] life
[1:43:18] but if there's a deep calling to the
[1:43:20] Deep
[1:43:21] you'll see this life is just a
[1:43:24] vapor amen and you'll recognize that
[1:43:27] this word is the only thing that can
[1:43:31] that can satisfy The
[1:43:33] Thirst
[1:43:35] amen now he says this word sorry
[1:43:39] comfortless as I was saying before what
[1:43:41] you feed on uh you become identified
[1:43:45] with he says I'll not leave you
[1:43:47] comfortless I will come to you now this
[1:43:49] word comfortless in the Greek he said it
[1:43:52] means it means bereaved that is
[1:43:56] parentless comfortless or fatherless so
[1:43:59] he's saying I will not leave you as an
[1:44:01] orphan I'll not leave you fatherless
[1:44:04] I'll not leave you comfortless amen I
[1:44:07] won't leave you parentless but I will
[1:44:09] come to you see I'm not going to leave
[1:44:11] you as an orphan child with no
[1:44:13] identification amen but I'll be your
[1:44:15] father I'll be your family I'll be your
[1:44:18] I'll be I'll be the one who walks with
[1:44:20] you I'll be your
[1:44:22] identification that's what he's saying
[1:44:24] I'll not leave you comfortless
[1:44:26] Hallelujah you see my little girls every
[1:44:28] game they play this is the mommy this is
[1:44:30] the daddy and you're the baby why that
[1:44:32] because that's their family
[1:44:34] identification people find their you
[1:44:36] know so I'm identified with this family
[1:44:38] therefore I have
[1:44:39] stability you see that's why he saying I
[1:44:41] won't leave you comfortless I won't
[1:44:44] leave you fatherless I'll give you
[1:44:46] stability I'll give you
[1:44:49] identification amen so then we can see
[1:44:51] now when God God is saying here that he
[1:44:54] will not leave us see if we know and if
[1:44:58] I had a message book I'd hold it because
[1:45:00] to me remember the message reveals
[1:45:01] Christ in here that's what it doesn't
[1:45:04] it's not another testimony of Jesus
[1:45:06] Christ it reveals Jesus in here amen and
[1:45:10] that's why you say well all I need is
[1:45:12] the Bible no I'll just say it the Bible
[1:45:17] without the Bible I mean without the
[1:45:19] message how can you understand
[1:45:20] understand the
[1:45:21] word because then it comes down to well
[1:45:24] this is my opinion this is someone on
[1:45:25] the internet's opinion and all they are
[1:45:27] using is their mind amen but so that's
[1:45:32] why God sent a prophet to open the Bible
[1:45:34] to us that we could understand who Jesus
[1:45:36] is we could understand you know who else
[1:45:39] you know we can understand who we are in
[1:45:41] him we can understand the power of the
[1:45:43] blood we can understand where we are in
[1:45:46] history we can understand truly how the
[1:45:49] should be amen truly how you know truly
[1:45:53] how children should be in all these
[1:45:54] things and how church should
[1:45:57] be you know I heard I heard for some
[1:46:00] reason I found myself this is a long
[1:46:02] time ago I found myself on YouTube and a
[1:46:03] man was teaching from the Bible about
[1:46:05] the Book of Revelation and he saying
[1:46:07] that the two witnesses in Revelations
[1:46:09] chap 11 was the Old and New
[1:46:12] Testament and there were people just
[1:46:14] nodding saying well that's incredible
[1:46:16] and it is incredible because how did he
[1:46:18] get
[1:46:19] that but this these are sincere people
[1:46:21] I'm not taking away from their sincerity
[1:46:23] they want to know what does this say
[1:46:25] this word is for me I want to know and
[1:46:28] this is what they remember if there's a
[1:46:29] garbage can they'll feed from a garbage
[1:46:32] can nothing against the brother
[1:46:34] ministering what he's so you know you
[1:46:37] spend so how could how could people work
[1:46:40] out what this is without God sending a
[1:46:43] prophet upon the Earth to say this is
[1:46:46] what it all means and it's not just an
[1:46:49] intellectual understanding but our eyes
[1:46:51] you know Luke Luke chap 24 and their
[1:46:53] eyes became open amen that they
[1:46:55] understood that Jesus was walking with
[1:46:57] them along the way and that's why that's
[1:46:59] why now you know the word has come open
[1:47:02] that our eyes would become open that we
[1:47:05] understand where we're from and who we
[1:47:07] are
[1:47:08] amen what else this message you say well
[1:47:11] what else can tell you truly who you are
[1:47:14] and where you're going amen they might
[1:47:17] have different just just jigsaw pieces
[1:47:20] but it takes a prophet that Divine
[1:47:22] intelligence of God to put it all
[1:47:24] together I'm still talking about the
[1:47:27] fountain because if you recognize what
[1:47:29] you're feeding from you will get what
[1:47:32] it's sent to
[1:47:33] do because now if you say well it's just
[1:47:36] his opinion on things I'd rather take a
[1:47:38] man's opinion if you just think it's his
[1:47:40] opinion where when he said to brother
[1:47:42] bisc in the car the testimony of God
[1:47:44] coming down to the car and brother Bisal
[1:47:47] looked at him and and he said when that
[1:47:49] presence came into the G said he said it
[1:47:51] felt like my next breath would take me
[1:47:52] into eternity he looked at brother Bram
[1:47:55] he said it look and his bed was sticking
[1:47:56] out cuz they just been 10 odd days
[1:47:58] hunting had been shaving he looked at
[1:48:00] him and looked like a man that was near
[1:48:02] death and brother Brown said to him said
[1:48:04] 10,000 times 10,000 he has come to me
[1:48:07] it's always the same like I could die
[1:48:10] that's why when an angel came in the
[1:48:12] Bible says fear not and then they would
[1:48:14] they would give a they would they would
[1:48:17] quote in the word what was where the
[1:48:20] person was what they commissioned to do
[1:48:22] and what is about to happen so here was
[1:48:25] a man who had thousands times when the
[1:48:26] angel of the Lord was present will come
[1:48:28] and speak to his Prophet I'd rather take
[1:48:31] that man's opinion if you think it's
[1:48:33] just an opinion I'd take what he says
[1:48:36] very very
[1:48:37] seriously
[1:48:39] amen then just my
[1:48:42] opinion amen and
[1:48:46] so the reason now the reason all that
[1:48:50] was was done is that God was proving
[1:48:53] this is me speaking this is me doing
[1:48:56] these things that people could say you
[1:48:58] know people say this message is
[1:49:00] Vindicated I'd say it's over
[1:49:03] Vindicated Moses Moses went down into
[1:49:06] Egypt he did the uh you know he spoke to
[1:49:09] the elders he did the sign I think maybe
[1:49:10] once they said this is him we're we're
[1:49:12] out of here father Braham spent moses'
[1:49:15] Ministry saying the angel met me in the
[1:49:17] cave I was commissioned with two SS and
[1:49:18] he tried to explain it to all the people
[1:49:20] you know thousands of times he tried to
[1:49:22] explain it over and over again says look
[1:49:24] can't you you know early in the early in
[1:49:26] the ministry you can hear it he says he
[1:49:29] takes remember the first side he takes
[1:49:30] on by the hand and and there would
[1:49:36] be and there would be a certain pattern
[1:49:38] of dots or whatever on his hand and he
[1:49:40] could discern what the what the disease
[1:49:42] was and he say who can see that some
[1:49:46] people saw it he was trying to explain
[1:49:48] it over and over again
[1:49:51] and this was done because he God because
[1:49:54] the people in this in this in this world
[1:49:57] we live in are so slow to
[1:49:59] believe he he could have just done it
[1:50:01] like with Moses just
[1:50:03] once the pillar of fire could have just
[1:50:05] come down on the o High River as John
[1:50:07] the Baptist was sent to for run so your
[1:50:09] message will for run the second coming
[1:50:10] and that that really all was needed oh
[1:50:13] here he is he's been Vindicated here we
[1:50:15] go the Rapture is going to take place
[1:50:17] soon but God proved it over again
[1:50:21] around the world people didn't even
[1:50:23] speak English accurate down to the
[1:50:27] everything was correct he did it over
[1:50:29] and over again because God was saying
[1:50:32] this is me speaking this man cannot do
[1:50:35] no man can do these things over and over
[1:50:38] again and it never failed
[1:50:40] once and see he's saying this is the
[1:50:43] fountain amen these words coming out of
[1:50:46] his mouth this is the fountain
[1:50:49] speaking
[1:50:51] amen Jesus said You shall know the truth
[1:50:53] and the truth shall set you
[1:50:56] free many people that when I was at
[1:51:00] University I went around the different
[1:51:02] Christian groups and the sincere these
[1:51:05] are sincere young people and virtually
[1:51:08] whenever truth came up people would say
[1:51:10] well you can't really know truth
[1:51:13] today and and it and it broke my heart
[1:51:16] cuz here's young sincere people all they
[1:51:18] know is whatever Church they came out of
[1:51:20] but they want to serve God they say well
[1:51:22] you can't really know truth but Jesus
[1:51:25] said You shall know the truth and the
[1:51:28] truth shall set you free so God is
[1:51:30] obligated now to show where the truth is
[1:51:34] Amen to prove it and that's why the
[1:51:37] Vindication is so it's a scriptural
[1:51:39] Vindication and it's so important
[1:51:41] because you can say this man what he is
[1:51:44] speaking is the truth and you hear many
[1:51:46] times in the prayer line he say this is
[1:51:48] your name this is it true yeah it's true
[1:51:49] you can hear it on tape over and over
[1:51:51] again is it true it's true and then he
[1:51:54] came and preached a sermon the spirit of
[1:51:56] Truth and he relays most of that sermon
[1:51:59] is just hunting
[1:52:01] testimonies and then he says now that
[1:52:04] Spirit of Truth is here not saying it
[1:52:06] for batim but it's basically what he
[1:52:07] says then God comes down and
[1:52:09] proves what he is relating he says this
[1:52:12] is the spirit of Truth
[1:52:14] speaking amen see if you really you know
[1:52:21] some people with food they love to know
[1:52:23] how many calories there are how many you
[1:52:26] know they love to know all the more than
[1:52:28] the flavor but they love to know what
[1:52:30] it's made of the protein amount the
[1:52:32] calorie amount how it all comes together
[1:52:35] how long it takes to digest in the body
[1:52:37] they love to and then they appreciate
[1:52:39] what they eat
[1:52:40] more they say this is what this produces
[1:52:42] in my body wow yeah they get all excited
[1:52:45] about it you know if that is just in the
[1:52:48] natural what about about in the
[1:52:51] spiritual amen we say this this word
[1:52:55] this is what it produces this is what it
[1:52:59] contains
[1:53:03] amen he says now and I'm just going to
[1:53:06] wind down a bit he says but there's no
[1:53:09] scripture for that but when it comes to
[1:53:12] genuine unadulterated word of God
[1:53:14] confirmed by God it seems to even
[1:53:16] embarrass the other group on the radical
[1:53:18] side see there's an embarrassment about
[1:53:20] it but it's a reality to a man or woman
[1:53:23] boy or girl who really is genuine
[1:53:25] Christian when God makes the promise of
[1:53:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:53:29] receive it there's something that
[1:53:31] settles within you that there's nothing
[1:53:34] takes its place when a man ever meets
[1:53:37] God not in some emotional workup some
[1:53:41] enthusiasm or some religious Doctrine
[1:53:43] some catechism or Creed or Dogma that he
[1:53:46] has accepted for a comfort for himself
[1:53:49] he's saying people use religion as a
[1:53:51] comfort but when he really comes to a
[1:53:54] place like Moses did on the back side of
[1:53:56] the desert walk up face to face with
[1:53:58] almighty God and you see the voice
[1:54:00] speaking to you exactly with the word
[1:54:02] and the promise of the hour there's
[1:54:03] something it does to you see you're not
[1:54:06] ashamed of it it does something to you
[1:54:09] what happens that thirst has been
[1:54:12] quenched amen you say well you say I'm
[1:54:15] still hungering for God there Comes A
[1:54:17] Time in life where The Thirst is
[1:54:19] quenched out all you want is
[1:54:21] more you understand that was me in my
[1:54:23] life when I when this fountain found me
[1:54:25] and I really surrendered all and I drank
[1:54:27] from this Fountain then that thirst was
[1:54:29] quenched but I wanted more of what I was
[1:54:31] drinking
[1:54:34] amen and so God is God is the same sorry
[1:54:38] I got to read this God is the same way
[1:54:41] Amen brother Bram says it's like a tree
[1:54:43] they drink water they just push out
[1:54:45] limbs but you got to drink more if you
[1:54:48] want to push out more you got to drink
[1:54:50] more than what you need amen because if
[1:54:53] you just eat or drink the same amount as
[1:54:55] what you need you don't
[1:54:57] grow so just drink and push
[1:54:59] out amen draw draw from the
[1:55:04] fountain I tell you friends there's
[1:55:06] people in this room that have been
[1:55:08] drinking from this fountain that if they
[1:55:10] did not drink from the fountain they
[1:55:11] would never be
[1:55:13] standing I guarantee I guarantee every
[1:55:15] one of you you walk with God long enough
[1:55:19] even even in my little seven eight years
[1:55:22] that if I did not drink from this
[1:55:24] Fountain I would never be standing here
[1:55:27] today amen I'd never be a Christian to
[1:55:30] if I wasn't drinking from this Fountain
[1:55:32] because there's a strength in the word
[1:55:34] that when we cannot go any further that
[1:55:37] strength will carry you through am mean
[1:55:39] when your Humanity fails that's when God
[1:55:42] steps in and and it's like training for
[1:55:45] battle you know soldiers they you know
[1:55:48] there's live fire exercises they're
[1:55:49] going to carry all the packs and do all
[1:55:51] these different things put on a grenade
[1:55:53] and a shovel and all these big packs and
[1:55:56] you know and they do that because they
[1:55:57] might need that In the Heat of battle
[1:56:00] they may need that training amen they
[1:56:02] may need that shovel to dig a dig a
[1:56:04] foxhole or whatever what whatever
[1:56:06] they're carrying you say why do I have
[1:56:08] to listen what's so important you might
[1:56:10] need it one day amen you might need it
[1:56:13] one day and there's a saying and I don't
[1:56:15] know who said it but there's a saying in
[1:56:16] times of peace prepare for war amen amen
[1:56:20] if you're having a time of peace prepare
[1:56:22] for war Hallelujah that when the Devil
[1:56:24] comes and comes on your case cuz he will
[1:56:28] amen you have the strength to withstand
[1:56:31] him
[1:56:35] amen amen now and let me tell you friend
[1:56:40] this is in thirst 65 I don't care how
[1:56:42] many churches you join how many names
[1:56:44] you put on which way you go or whether
[1:56:46] you're sprinkled baptized or what you
[1:56:48] are and until you meet that person Jesus
[1:56:51] Christ that's the only thing that'll
[1:56:53] really satisfy emotion won't do it you
[1:56:56] might jump up and down and shout as long
[1:56:59] as you want to or might run up and down
[1:57:01] the floor and you might speak in tongues
[1:57:02] as much as you want to and Them Things
[1:57:05] Are Holy and good I don't say I'm not
[1:57:07] saying anything against it but until you
[1:57:09] meet that person that satisfying portion
[1:57:13] amen that's something that takes every
[1:57:16] fiber in your body not by emotion but by
[1:57:18] satisfaction
[1:57:20] used to see a little sign if you're
[1:57:23] thirsty say PA this is advertising they
[1:57:27] used to be a little drink when I was uh
[1:57:29] when I was a boy called paff I remember
[1:57:32] coming down the road over from fishing
[1:57:34] I've been up on the pond old stagnant
[1:57:36] Waters and I was about starve to
[1:57:40] death and I seen a sign say if you're
[1:57:43] thirsty just say PA I started saying pa
[1:57:46] pa I got thirst here all the time
[1:57:50] see I just
[1:57:53] got I just got so I couldn't even spit
[1:57:56] after a while I was so thirsty well you
[1:57:58] see that won't do it there's nothing
[1:58:00] will satisfy it I don't care if you
[1:58:02] drink Cokes you can drink anything you
[1:58:05] want to with them sweetened bicarbonated
[1:58:07] Waters and so forth there's nothing that
[1:58:09] will satisfy The Thirst like a good cool
[1:58:12] cold stream of water that'll quench that
[1:58:14] thirst all these other sub things are
[1:58:17] substitutes and why would you want to
[1:58:20] take a substitute when there's a genuine
[1:58:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies
[1:58:26] every fiber and longing in the human
[1:58:28] soul can stand right in the face of
[1:58:32] death excuse me like the great Apostle
[1:58:35] Paul said oh death where is your sting
[1:58:38] grave where is your Victory but thanks
[1:58:40] be to God who gives us the victory
[1:58:42] through our Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[1:58:45] experience brother that satisfies that
[1:58:47] Holy hush or that Holy thirst that's in
[1:58:49] you it satisfies it you don't have to do
[1:58:51] anything else about it it cleanses the
[1:58:54] lips and there's also just people who
[1:58:56] live upon emotion some people say well
[1:58:58] we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal
[1:59:00] movement and they'll go in which is fine
[1:59:03] they'll pat their hands and play the
[1:59:05] music the music stops oh a bucket of
[1:59:08] water went over everything see now we do
[1:59:11] that we got in a habit of doing that uh
[1:59:14] it's become one of our customs let me
[1:59:16] tell you something when you're
[1:59:17] worshiping God in the spirit and the
[1:59:18] truth
[1:59:19] when it becomes accustom for you to do
[1:59:21] it because you think you ought to do it
[1:59:24] because you think that if you don't
[1:59:25] shout or jump up and down or dance with
[1:59:28] the music your neighbor might think
[1:59:30] you're backslid you're drinking from a
[1:59:32] stagnated stream right until it fills
[1:59:35] every fiber until the Holy Spirit
[1:59:37] itself's bubbling in you I don't care
[1:59:40] whether the music's playing whether
[1:59:42] they're playing Nearer My God to thee or
[1:59:43] whatever it is the holy spirit still
[1:59:45] ringing the glory bells in your heart it
[1:59:51] satisfies amen he says he says later in
[1:59:54] the Ser he says if you've got that
[1:59:55] thirst tonight to know more about God
[1:59:58] and to come closer to him if you'll just
[2:00:00] raise up your hand now while everyone's
[2:00:02] head's bowed that's what to come down he
[2:00:04] says pray for me oh God look at the
[2:00:05] hands out into the land where the
[2:00:07] broadcast is going now east north west
[2:00:10] and south and them in the rooms raise up
[2:00:12] your hands to the pastors wherever
[2:00:14] whatever is there that you desire
[2:00:16] something in you thirsting that Holy
[2:00:18] thirst don't set safy it oh you say
[2:00:20] brother BR my shout once I dance in the
[2:00:22] spirit don't don't take that wait till
[2:00:25] that satisfaction
[2:00:31] comes the satisfaction portion of the
[2:00:34] fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in
[2:00:36] then these Joy bells of shouting and
[2:00:38] speaking in tongues and dancing the
[2:00:40] spirit will come you won't have to do it
[2:00:43] by music you'll do it when you're going
[2:00:46] down the car I mean going down the road
[2:00:48] in your car you'll do it when you're
[2:00:50] sleeping uh sweeping the floor you'll do
[2:00:53] it when you're driving nails in the wall
[2:00:55] with your carpenter work where wherever
[2:00:57] you are that's joy unspeakable and full
[2:01:00] of glory amen
[2:01:05] hallelujah
[2:01:07] amen we have the
[2:01:09] fountain I'm just going to I'm just
[2:01:11] going to wind down but friends that's
[2:01:14] the reason people they go off to
[2:01:17] different things and because they've
[2:01:19] experienced maybe the supernatural power
[2:01:21] of God but they their thirst and their
[2:01:25] soul hasn't been quenched that's why he
[2:01:28] says all those things are good but don't
[2:01:31] put it on that wait till that full
[2:01:33] satisfaction comes in amen and then the
[2:01:36] joy Bells will ring wherever you are in
[2:01:38] life
[2:01:40] Hallelujah because he says it's that
[2:01:42] person you got to meet Jesus Christ and
[2:01:44] he's the satisfying portion amen when
[2:01:47] Ruth met Boaz uh I know I mentioned
[2:01:49] these things last Sunday but I just want
[2:01:50] to maybe expand it but when Ruth met
[2:01:53] Boaz and Boaz said stay in the field she
[2:01:57] knew exactly who he was amen she knew
[2:02:00] that he was the Mighty Man of wealth she
[2:02:03] knew that he was a near Kinsman to
[2:02:05] Naomi amen so she knew who was speaking
[2:02:10] to her if she just thought this is just
[2:02:13] a man who's got a field he wouldn't have
[2:02:15] really obeyed what he told her amen but
[2:02:20] because she knew who he was she obeyed
[2:02:22] what he said said stay in this field and
[2:02:26] the reason the reason that she had to
[2:02:29] stay in the field is that Boz told her
[2:02:31] my young men won't harm you you know
[2:02:33] you're not going to be abused in this
[2:02:35] place you're not going to find harm in
[2:02:36] this place so it was a protection for
[2:02:39] Ruth to stay in the
[2:02:40] field amen there's a reason it's not
[2:02:43] just it's not just to say well you're
[2:02:45] narrow-minded and keep people narrow
[2:02:47] minded there's a protection of staying
[2:02:49] in the word staying in the Vindicated
[2:02:52] word amen cuz one hey out of that field
[2:02:55] she receive life the staff of life was
[2:02:58] growing in that field during The Barley
[2:03:00] Harvest so she was living off what that
[2:03:02] field that she was in amen you make it
[2:03:06] spiritual friends the lord of the
[2:03:08] Harvest has
[2:03:10] come and you have found Grace in his
[2:03:12] sight remember unto her it was granted
[2:03:15] she didn't have to go through a
[2:03:16] tribulation and give her life I'm too
[2:03:18] I'm speak of the Bride andto her it was
[2:03:20] granted that she'd be a raid in fine
[2:03:22] linen it's just given Ruth just found
[2:03:24] herself in his good
[2:03:26] graces amen she just this is just how
[2:03:29] life seemed you know what a what a
[2:03:32] terrible life to go through the the
[2:03:34] first the first part of her life but
[2:03:36] that was ordained by God to get her into
[2:03:38] that field amen it's the same thing with
[2:03:41] you friends God has caus you to move to
[2:03:43] certain places and things to happen and
[2:03:46] that was all done that you had come to
[2:03:48] the fountain amen
[2:03:50] hallelujah and so Ruth knew this is Boaz
[2:03:54] speaking he's a man of great wealth and
[2:03:57] influence here and he's he's related to
[2:04:00] my
[2:04:01] mother-in-law family
[2:04:03] relation and she was the and he didn't
[2:04:06] maybe she didn't really understand at
[2:04:08] that time but she she be to realize
[2:04:13] later in the story that her being taken
[2:04:16] out of widowhood the only one that could
[2:04:18] undo her shame was that very
[2:04:21] man amen and that's why she stayed she
[2:04:25] stayed in the
[2:04:26] field Hallelujah she had a revelation
[2:04:29] you know you've seen a cow you've seen
[2:04:31] cows put their head through a fence and
[2:04:34] and and eat the grass all these things
[2:04:37] friends the grass is not always greener
[2:04:40] on the other
[2:04:41] side sometimes the cow gets stuck in the
[2:04:43] fence sometimes they eat something that
[2:04:46] they shouldn't be eating and they get
[2:04:47] sick and die
[2:04:50] amen
[2:04:52] and well you know in the you're in the
[2:04:56] sermon uh Serv this the time of the end
[2:04:59] one of the brothers had a vision of of
[2:05:01] him and brother bam hurting cattle and
[2:05:03] he said he said the cattle's actually
[2:05:05] the church they always try to go the
[2:05:06] easy way we got to get them out onto
[2:05:08] this harder way which is the right way
[2:05:11] so you if I say analogies like cows
[2:05:13] don't be offended but you see God God
[2:05:16] has ordained it such a way that's why
[2:05:18] Vindicated so strongly he says this is
[2:05:20] the field this is the field if I had a
[2:05:24] message book I hold it the same hand
[2:05:25] this is the field stay in the field stay
[2:05:28] in what God has

[2:05:32] thirst and it will continue to satisfy

[2:07:56] then you cast that will down when you
[2:07:58] die your own will is dead you don't have
[2:08:00] a desire your will was changed that you
[2:08:03] will to let God in remember God is a
[2:08:05] gentleman and your own selfish will was
[2:08:08] changed that you could open really open
[2:08:10] yourself and he can come and dwell in
[2:08:12] you then after that you don't want your

[2:08:17] don't want your own will anymore how do

[2:09:27] his will we don't want our own things
