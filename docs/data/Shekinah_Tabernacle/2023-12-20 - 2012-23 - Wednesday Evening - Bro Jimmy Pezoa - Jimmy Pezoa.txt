I can accept Lord that without you I'm nothing Lord and I need you to talk through me bless your people thank you Lord for everything in Jesus Christ's name we ask you this amen amen thank you mici thank you George amen well God bless you Saints God bless you I know it's weird I'm here on Wednesday Stephanie said like uh it was like my graduation because I'm here on Wednesday not on Sunday so are being promoted amen hallelujah so um prise the Lord amen it working oh boy amen so we're going to read a episode in the Bible in Exodus chapter 32 amen the Bible says um and when the people saw that Moses is laid to come down out of the mount the people gathered them himself together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us God which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt we would not what is become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives and your son Sons and your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break the break off the Golden Earrings which were in the ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their head and fishen it with a graving tool after he had made made it a molten cuff and they said this be thy God or Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt what a moment you can have you se you see sa so I was um trying to find some U information on the internet and for the Hebrews for the for the Jewish people this and they still remember this moment and they pray for this CU there was a big moment for them idolatry after being saved by God they they shap their own God they wanted to create their own God what a moment but I want to talk to you about this God is not done with you amen after that such a dark moment God he wasn't done with with the people of Israel yes sir amen that's right let me find my notes was it's going to be way too short amen so um I want to show you through the Bible like a a couple of cases when people did horrible things really horrible things but God wasn't done with them even when they thought that they were unworthy God he was still with them Hallelujah and um yeah so we know that Moses went up the mountain to talk to God and God he was going to give him like um all the information that he was going to need the plans of everything how they were had to conduct in this world the clothes that they were had to wear the Ten Commandments everything he was receiving all the information for the people of Israel but because he delayed to come down the people they just start doing whatever they wanted um and if you read like two chapters before you can see that God is telling Moses that they are going to have to build the arc of the Covenant and that they are going to need some gold but the these people they decide to make a golden calf with that gold That was supposed to build chin they decide to make a cow but God wasn't done with them amen amen thank you Lord and um I want to talk to you also about um Aaron because Aaron is the is one of the hero here but no one really talk about her cuz Moses is it's like his big shade Moses is just way too big but Aaron he he was quite important in exod the seven we can read it says and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet Thou shalt speak all that I commanded thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh that he sent the children of Israel out of his land and chapter 10 I mean verse 10 says and Moses and Aaron went into unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord had commanded and Aaron cast down his Rod before pharaoh and before his servant and it became a a serpent yeah so God he was really using a even if you ask someone I was going to do like a the trick question here but no because it's Wednesday stepan told me not today and that was going to be one of the questions because if you ask which whose Ro became into a serpent everyone's going to say Moses but actually it was Aaron and we can see here that God was dealing with this brothers and I don't know why it remind me uh um jono and um and Malachi Jonah and Malachi because they all the sister was Rebecca I mean uh Miriam so it's like the same thing I don't know why quite nice and here we can find more um information about Aon cuz all the people just think that um Moses was doing all the Miracles but God was actually using Aaron and he says Exodus 7 chap um verse 19 and the Lord spoke unto Moses say unto Aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt upon the streams upon the rivers and upon the ponds and upon all the pools of water that they may become blood blood sorry and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessel of stones another verse says six and Aaron stretched out his hand hand over the Waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt just Aaron again yeah chap uh verse 17 and they did so for Aaron stretched out of his hand hand with his rod and smart the dust out of the earth and it became how do you pronounce this word LI or Li lies in man and it be all the dust of the land became lies throughout all the land of Egypt so we can see them God he was really using Aaron let's go back to this moment so Moses he had to go up and talk to God and Aaron was in charge yeah now we know that God was really using Aaron and Aaron he was a really nice man but he was caught up in this and um they decided to make this a golden cuff and a golden cuff can be anything in your life that it's taking the place of God in your heart can be anything your your talent can be your work can be whatever whatever that you are deciding to put first yeah the the first things always should be God Amen but I don't want to talk much about the golden CS I want to talk about the God wasn't done with any of them I mean with Aaron yeah Aaron I want to talk about Aaron today amen amen and here we can find Exodus 32 verse 21 it's when Moses went down the mountain and he saw all this big party but the funny thing is like they knew that they were doing wrong because they stopped as soon as I saw the I saw Mo they saw Moses they were like oh okay the part is over we were doing wrong and I'm pretty sure like if you're doing something wrong in any little small thing that you're doing something wrong there's always a small voice there for you it's telling you you what are you doing but it's right you you have to really fit that little voice and it's going to grow and grow it's not going to be a small voice anymore hallelujah it's going to be really present for you praise the Lord amen so here in Exodus 32 verse 24 says and Moses said unto Aaron what did these people unto thee thou that thou Hast brought so great a sin upon them and Aaron said let not be anger of my Lord WX heart thou knowest the people that they are set on Mischief for they said unto me make us a god which shall be before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt we would not what has become of him and I said unto them whatsoever have any gold let them break it off so they gave it to me then I cast it into the fire and there came out of this calf I think that the last verse is quite funny because he's saying I just throw this all this go into the fire and this is what came out but you can see that he used a carving tool and he did it but of course he was scared that a couple of days ago that mountain was shaking and there was thunders in with everything was very scary for them so he was just I would say that he was very scared do you remember when they like um when they were around Jericho and this man decided to take a little treasure for him and all his family would kill that's that's the same God but God wasn't done with Aon amen Aon Aaron he was predestinated to be a priest a high priest the first high priest he was oh man he was predestinated to be that Exodus 30 the the golden cuff is in chapter 32 but in Exodus 30 this is God talking and said to Moses and thou shalt anoint Aaron for his and his sons and cons consecrate them and they may Minister unto me in the priest office God he knew what everyone was going to do yeah but he choose him anyways it doesn't matter what are you going to do in your life cuz no human mistake can take the calling of the Lord in your life doesn't matter where you and it can be like a past mistake something in your life that is stopping you or it can be something that you can do in the future I'm not telling you to go and do something silly but he chose you that's right and he's not done with you amen amen so now we can see Aaron as a high priest wearing his spectrol and everything he looks he looks nice yeah and I'm pretty sure that when he was being a priest every time that he was going to offer a sacrifice to the Lord he he was not going to be a really proud man he were going to be so humble because he he did something very wrong but the Lord forgive him and I think that's the way that we should be like all the time yeah to be proud of ourselves it's it's a we it's a really horrible things yeah amen but that's what I like about the story of Aaron that the Lord really loved him and so he's a he couldn't see over his mistake and he decid to use him anyways amen so we also have David that he he also did something wrong something very wrong he slept with another man wife and he killed a man but God wasn't done with him he he he forgive him because in his heart he was so sorry and that's the way that we should be always like if we made a mistake don't we don't have to think that the Lord is done with us hallelujah he chose us and he's always going to be with us amen than you father another character in The Bible here is Simpson he was a very strong man physically he was so strong but he weakness uh and I wanted to say this uh the last time that I that I was here but the weakness of Samson was the ladies you know it was like no Christian ladies and he was a very strong man and there was was the same weakness of Solomon and for this young boys it's like I don't want to be mean but you're not strong as Samson and you're not as smart as Solomon so be careful with non-Christian ladies they can really give you hard time but the Lord had something for him when he thought that he was done the Lord was going to use him one more time the Lord he wasn't done with him Amen in that um jail where he was also Peter he was the Lord I will say the best friend he was a really friend of the Lord he really loved him but when he was scared he denied him three times he was just so scared and he run away and he wanted to do what he he wanted to go back to his old life he want to be a fisherman again but the Lord h a a high call for Peter too and those three um when he denied the Lord three times it BEC his three confirmations when the Lord asked him Peter do you love me and he said yes Lord I love you Peter do you love me yes Lord and the third time I think it's so powerful because Peter he says to the Lord Lord you know all the things yeah you you know what's in my heart yeah I love you and that's what I really love about Peter so when Jesus resurrect here in Mark 16 the angel said to them and he said unto them Be not Afraid ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they led him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he go before you into Galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you I think that verse is so powerful because he saying tell all of them but don't forget Peter the Lord he really wanted to see Peter and that's so powerful cuz Peter he was feeling terrible because he denied the Lord but he wasn't done with with him amen thank you Lord as as he is not done with you either doesn't matter what you have done you have something to do here he's not done with you amen amen in Roman I'm going to give you some the last verses sorry I was only able to do 30 minutes so far we were aiming for 20 but no Romans 8 uh verse 30 says moreover whom he did predestinate them also he called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them also glorified I really love that verse cuz it's in past sentence for him it's done for him you are already up in heaven you made it for him you made it that's why he sees you perfect yeah thank you Lord amen Philip Philippians um 1 verse 6 says being confident of this very thing that he which had began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he will finish the work in you he's still working in you amen and I have a last quote here says he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you if you wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows what you are there are traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say I didn't mean to to do that God you know it you are still perfect because there is a perfect blood offered to you offer for you amen every day in a beding sacrifice hanging Before the Throne of the almighty God that's right amen thank you Lord amen he cannot make any mistake and if he called you he's going to finish the work in you if you think that the Lord is not with you no he's with you amen amen and God is not done with you amen well I was only able to speak for 15 minutes but let's have the musicians amen this is a prayer meeting I was told it was only 20 minutes amen amen hallelujah and actually I can I can share with you a little testimony just do going for the the time again so I remember when when I was like 18 or 19 I wanted to be a detective in in Chile that uh that career is called um investig and I wanted to be one of them man I my entire life I wanted to be a detective and even when I was like 18 there were some people saying Oh you talked like that detective you look like a detective and I was like yeah I'm going to be a detective so I applied to became a detective and I there was three test I passed number one number two and they didn't call me I I mean I did the number three like test but they didn't call me back and man I was destroying cuz I really wanted to be a detective so I I I aim for my second dream that I was become like a professional guitarist and I went to study music and I was caught up on drugs on every on all that the world can offer to you and I couldn't make like two two of my dreams like it was just something that that I couldn't make and for for like a couple of years I was really really like on drugs and drinking like heavily like every single day I was just trying to block myself out of out of that thing that I was not able to do to you know to become real any of my dreams right but the Lord he wasn't done with me he he wanted me to come here cuz if I could have become like a detective I would I wouldn't be here today that's right and probably I wouldn't even be serving the lord cuz when you have money and when you have all what you want you don't need the Lord there's so many people out of there that they don't need the Lord they feel that they don't need the Lord but when you are hanging oh yes on a little string man thank you Jesus you really feel
