um we can do some more worship after this praise the Lord and since we did I think since the Brahmins got one choice [Music] as a song working I never came cool all our hopes renewed the last words and I think that's how I pretty much felt just um I had such a good time at camp and you think you know you're gonna go and cook for 80 people you're thinking okay cool you got to have all the three meals ready and everything and yeah you think it's probably going to be not much time for listening in to the services and entering in but yeah I'm so thankful to the Lord far exceeded my expectations so thank you all for your prayers for camp everybody was very happy with the natural food and the spiritual food that was there by God's grace and it just seemed like every meal you could just see the hand of a thought everything just moved out just perfectly but even from the first opening Scripture at camp I think it was from memory Genesis 22 and he preached on the eye of God and he talked about how it was like hey go beyond a high ROI and thou God seest me and that's spoken to Indy and I a lot over the last little while when our testimony and a couple of years and man just all our hopes renewed you know when you just know man this is the Lord he's just wronged me he sees us he knows the situation I guess this camp for me it was just like that deep trust and the Lord just renewed again it was really cool tiny bit of a funny testimony the brother that was ministering was from the other side of the world in America so he was on a different jet-lagged timetable so and he said I'll make you coffee in the morning brother what time would you like it and when he said 2 nd 6:00 a.m. he was like whoa ok that's he said yet brother will be there and so we're going to be a nicety you're really going to get up caught in a sex he said yeah yeah that'll be fun you just have to show me how to use that coffee machine so it was awesome so we actually was so blessed we only went to bed after 1:00 and we were getting up early and he said ok this is a good time for us to pray and I thought man this is cool I can with stillness of the morning and just to see the Bliss just like we had supernatural times of prayer and there was just odd ones that came in into the kitchen and set with us and prayed in the mornings and one time that really stood out to me was on the last morning the Monday morning of camp I had a really heavy burden on my heart just to pray and I just prayed through a vision of the Lord coming down for the people and anchoring the revelation like that from this time on whatever it was that they needed it would be like an anchor going down into the solid rock and to the word and then they could always bring it back to a tie post and that will be the anchor and it was like when I was praying I saw their anchor so clearly and the rock and it was like this is it you know and and it was interesting because during the service we were just quickly trying to prepare lunch and it was a blessing because the kitchens right next to the sanctuary so we could shut the glass and still kind of hear and prepare at the same time and I was just crying through a service and you versus the Lord just speaking to me and through the whole service just and anyway cutting a long story short I decided at the end of it I just want to go out for prayer you know because he talked about like Abraham and Sierra and there's a vision you have the vision but sometimes in the in-between times you can like like the songs he'd be in disappointment often a disappointment or you know you have an expectation and that's not fulfilled and so sometimes you can get it for discouraged so I just I just mean I thought I'm going to go forward to a prayer just for faith and that the Lord will just help me to hold on then keep for leaving and and as soon as I got up I was the only one that went up first just for prayer and he just took a hold of my wrist and he said to me and I knew it was just the Lord you know when you know the Lord's been - and he said there's a chain and it ties you and this is the anchor and it goes down and there's a solid rock and that's the word and he said you are actually tied to that word and the anchor just holds you and I was like well the exact thing that the Lord had had me so burdened and I was crying when I was praying so good and to Frazer that was for me thank you lord so you know it was the supernatural the whole weekend that's just a small one but I just thought I should have a testimony so yes thank you all for your prayers [Applause] [Music] exactly the same for me the Lord really just blessed me so amazing that before we went to camp I see to the Lord because it's been like as you we've always a church been through quite an emotionally trying time and it's taken its toll and when you didn't even really realize but it's just it's been hard and so I said to the Lord I want to be restore completely back to every single joy have you ever had and you and freedom I've had in you plus greater heights and I've ever had in you before so that's what I want out of camp and I absolutely haven't without a doubt in my mind that's what I'm going to get and Saturday morning I just had to cry through the whole service because it was like it's speaking straight to my heart and then Saturday night oh yeah I went out but PA I don't think they've been able to call but I knew it's for me and that's exactly just everything that he prayed I just felt the Holy Spirit right there and the Lord just spoke to my heart really cleese did you are a believer and it made me think because often have heard in prayer lines brother venom so I can see you're a Christian you're a believer and I always thought be so lovely to hear the prophets say that I can see you're a believer but their sayings God that was in the prophets heed it to me you ever believer and it just boost me so much [Applause] [Music] amen God is so good you know I actually have so many testimonies it was just such a wonderful time and the Lord has undertook for everything and all the cooking everything just went smoothly everything just happened I mean you know we pushed and we worked hard and did all those things too but Allah blistered and you know they were we had such a supernatural time in that kitchen I don't know I'm sure that you guys remember we were just singing in the whole kitchen was in this light stiffened part harmony of these songs and we were just like it was just good it was so nice I think we shaved the video that was only a little tiny snippet but it was like there for about what man this is like such a cool kitchen team when we had alpha on the bass baritone man he was gone for him it was real good he had that bass going right happens with the ceilings and it was just nice but you know I had such I just want to concur with the two sisters with the exact same testimony you know I had a burden on my heart for the people and for myself for all of us because we're all together we're all one and the Lord met those needs and the Lord came on the scene and just just broke all sorts of bondages and just he just loosed his sword and just cut down every devil in it was just amazing such a powerful time and all the prayers that were prayed that the the ministry was just fulfilling those things and just it was it went beyond our expectation and then on a little testimony that blessed my heart it was we were serving I think I told Ben my Top Ramen I told somebody that we were serving and brother Craig came through and I said to him cuz I just I just I knew that the service that morning are serving him dinner at least the service that morning I just I just knew so clear on my heart the word that was being ministered was Hebrews 4:12 and it was discerning the thoughts and intents of my heart and just undoing everything and I just knew you know the same word the the gift of the Messiah that was in brother branham's ministry that discerned all those hats all the time that same word was on the scene and it was just undoing things deep life long complexes and all the stuff was just being dealt with and all the pews was going over like this and it was just in it and it didn't pass me by I was sitting there and it I reached out and touched the Lord Amen as he passed by and he handed in his brother Craig we passed I seen brother Craig Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God I just recited the whole scripture I felt and he goes like this he goes not like as definitive but it he was taken aback I was at all I wanted to say something wrong and then he kept going and then that night it was his opening scripture whoa man that was differently like a moment you know so yeah the Lord just it was a supernatural time [Applause] praise the Lord there was a worthwhile stop amen I mean later I'm just continuing the atmosphere of the Lord will stand and we'll just sing some worship songs before brother Ben comes up to minister down this evening well singing I'm let the weak say I am strong I [Music] I let the vines [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this

it was the camp was for me everyone else was there was nice but it was really my camp every service is like he's just talking to me and and even afterwards you know we had a bit of time with brother Craig before we left and he's just it's like he was been in our house seen our lives the past few years it's amazing just as brother Andy said the Word of God is a discerner of thoughts intents of the heart it was incredible and and Sunday night I went up for prayer had a burn I had to go for prayer and I just ask the Lord for a few things and one of them was a revival and the and you know not just for myself but for us and and brother Craig said after you pray see don't go receive your revival and I walked out of there and I said I receive it and the Spirit of God fell upon me and I was that I was rejoicing hallelujah so here I am to receive my revival hallelujah amen so I believe we're in for a great season hallelujah amen it was a glorious as a glorious camp wonderful camp the Lord was very present was just incredible to be there and the Lord knows everything about us hallelujah I'd like to I'd like to read a quote just before we kind of I did write it down with my handwriting scary so I want to I want to read this this is from what shall I do with Jesus called Christ in 1963 it says the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have work that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise and the beauty of us holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the Holy Spirit and I was marveling when I read there because this is it's been in yo it's worked in a small measure and you think what an incredible you know you hear the you know you hear the ministry hear God moving into turning thoughts and teens in the hearts and eyes being formed in sockets and God doing incredible things he's just saying it's just a small measure but it says that's while the head stones coming down we went now we know the heads donors Christ right so while he's coming down to unite with the body but when the head and the body you know it's together the full power of the Holy Ghost amen we'll race her up just exactly like that now I wanted to clear to you I don't know if you've realized it but we're not looking for a uniting the bride is early United right Authority we're not looking for the future event I meant when the when the message came your way and faith rose and you gave yourself to him and you met the Lord Jesus Christ but where he's working small measure but in full measure now I'd like to speak tonight on identification it's got a hebrews chapter 2 it's gonna read a bit of scripture now we read there and I'm Luke 6 um or maybe I mean we will come back to that dear but I just like to read from Hebrews 2 7 to 18 because now you know identification you become what you're identified with I just say that servant you become what you identified with so if you're identified with just religion you become religious if you're identified with the world you become like the world if you identify with Jesus Christ and living word you'll become like him right so now Paul says in Hebrews 2 from verse 7 thou made us some speaking of the Lord Jesus thou made us some a little lower than the Angels thou Kronus him with glory and honor and did a set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that before in there he put all in subjection under him he left nothing there does not put under him but now we see not yet all things under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified to all of one for which course he is not ashamed to call them brethren so he's identifying himself with the people saying I'll declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church while I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God have given me for as much sin as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels be took on him the seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people and that he himself having suffered being tempted he is able to secure which means help them that attempted so now we God identifies himself with his bride God has invested himself in you he's identified himself in a you know not just with the people but in a people so we read there he's not ashamed to call the church his brethren he's not ashamed to call us his family holy he's not ashamed to say this is mine i redeemed me my birth them into the earth I made them born again by my spirit they're part of me he's not ashamed to say that now identification this is from this is just from a dictionary it's the action or process of identifying something so it's the action or process of identifying something and so when the Holy Ghost comes upon you the Bible says he sent forth the spirit of adoption where we cry Abba Father or my father my father so in the spirit of the Holy Ghost comes upon you you respond back god you're my father I'm identified with you you're my father I'm your child I'm your bride we're the same family I mean we're not wandering separate kind of you know but we're one amen and it's also a person's sense of identity now we won't read it but in mark 16 Jesus Jesus gives his last commission to the church and he tells them to go into all the world and to preach the gospel and these signs shall follow in the belief so it's not just not just the ministry but them that believed these signs shall follow and then after he lists down about speaking tongues and casting out Devils and you know you know treat it you know you pick up serpents and they will not harm you and different things he says and he went working with them confirming the word so God was in the apostles our Lord Jesus was in the apostles identify himself with that what the world would call a bunch of ragtag people amen but he identified himself with them saying these are mine this is my body upon the earth this is my word made flesh I'm proud to be identified with them hallelujah so God is God is not ashamed to be identified with you I mean many times - oh Lord I want to you know sometimes we think how could God be want to be identified with me he wasn't be identified with you that's why he went to Calvary took your sins upon himself to bridge the gulf break down the middle wall of partition that he can come and dwell in you hallelujah so I'm glad our God wants to identify himself on us now we have come to a time where God through the church ages has been revealing himself in part but as he was the son of man in the beginning he's the son of man in the end and the son of man has manifested through a multi-member body right so what he wasn't parked down the church ages this is fullness manifesting now see everything he was in the beginning he is in the end everything he was and the bridegroom he is in the bride hallelujah so it's not a we we have not been you know we are be restored to the original right so the original God came down and well to this church God called ministry and sent them forth God commissioned them to gun to all the world preach the gospel and they were led by the Spirit of God right and they cast out the devil wherever he was found hallelujah you know I want her life I want a life that stirs them up hey we must give them a good [Music] hallelujah you know really we want the devil to breathe a sigh of relief I'm glad those people are out of here I'm I'm go ahead Oh amen so he mustn't plow through shouldn't we you see the Apostles that that Pentecost Peter didn't bring out some scholarly sermon the first first church service you know when he said this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel holier they had zeal they had a real gumption about them they had a fire they knew who they were you know God God fills you with the Holy Spirit exclaiming part of himself right he's laying claim on you he says this bit belongs to me I mean not just a potential well maybe we'll see how they go on there you know I will just let them go to your performance-based your probation period noises this is mine pearly this is mine this pit belongs to me I mean to win you realize that he is your father your as child that should make us invincible doesn't matter what the devil throws that you should be something in your heart I'm going to serve God no matter what I can be on my deathbed I could be destitute I could be whatever I'm going to serve God holy I'm going to rejoice in the God of my salvation that's how we should be haloo you you know we're here to praise the Lord we must praise Him hallelujah what's your job I'm here to praise God I'm not gonna let rocks cry out in my place they marvelous sing better than me but I'm gonna cry out hallelujah you know we are the last well for the Gentiles we are the last manifestation of a Gentile bride we've been this living God is coming to us it's been he's been passed down through the ages I use just the Shannons Sunday School thing with the boys at camp about passing the bed and let us run and you know it's been handed to us you may not be looking for the bed and but the bed and found you this word found you hallelujah we don't just carry the word we become the word hallelujah so we mustn't run we mustn't live this life you say well I'm not ordained to preach you can live a sermon you can live Redemption howl ooh you why not let's do a good job hallelujah well I know this why not push the battle why not press it why not run hallelujah it's all about the you know we don't want to put God in a box Abraham Otis was 80 years old that's a long time but then finally God found him and the last 40 years of his life was very different to the first 80 right the first 80 he was he was Prince of Egypt then he is a shepherd on the backside of the desert and then God met him he knew he was called to be the deliverer but then God met him and he did God did thinks through him now I don't even know if he imagined it cuz he had in his mind when he hit 40 he says now I'm gonna you know you know he killed the one Egyptian he once he uses military might his own ability to deliver Israel it failed miserably but that's that's that's what his imagination was we're gonna kill this one though rally to me we're going to storm the garrison we'll get the arms maybe you know but then when God came to him in the burning bush is very different so we don't want to put God in a box hallelujah God can do anything now God identifies himself with his children we read in in in Abraham we know Abraham became bkm became Abraham Sarah I became Sarah and God identified himself by adding an H into their names and that speaks of God's breath so he breathed on them just like Adam was made out of formed out the dusty earth that God breathed into him the breath of life he became a living soul and then now has his Abraham and Sarah [Music] part of God's name is in mine so he is Aerith he is joining himself with the promise for that hour hallelujah so he breathed on them hey you could say by adding that H there means speaks of the Hebrew for the breath of God just like he breathed on Adam and then Jesus now before he but you know before he ascends up after the resurrection he breathed on his disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and they went to Pentecost and they received the Holy Ghost see his breathing on them just like when he made the first man and he put the H into Abraham and Sarah's baby so I'm going to put my my breath in you that you will fulfill the promise of the day and I'm sure you can agree they did fulfill the promise of the day hallelujah they had the promise and it's incredible where God the spirit of God blows where it will you cannot see where it comes from you cannot see where it goes you know just like the wind so as everyone that's born of the Spirit of God so the Spirit of God blows into a place people are birthed hallelujah and then now there's a people and now here we are amen here we are and now we're not called to sit idle you know New Zealand punches above its weight in a lot of ways I think we should do the same thing hallelujah amen we have a responsibility to get this word out amen we have a responsibility to find the last one wouldn't that be cool if we found the last one we did we found them we did wouldn't that be wonderful hallelujah amen so what you know why not us why not here this is a country of immigrants Amen I mean I'm a son of an immigrant a lot of us are Amen so why not now now as I said we are now living in the time of the full measure where the Holy Spirit we've been united with the head the headstone is here the capstone is here right we have the devil's answer brother Brown is encrusted mr. Gaad reveal he says we have the living resurrected Jesus Christ that kept stone us here because the Devils out you know yeah because it did last the question if they'll be are you really a believer I said yeah I've been identified with the headship the heat chip is here over the body I mean the life of God and a people answers all the devil's questions right because he asked well are you really are you really Bluff said the life in me proves I am cuz yet God has identified himself with me hallelujah so Abraham and Sarah they went through great adversity Abraham waited 25 years but he was patient looking for the promise to be fulfilled and it's the same thing with us though them though the promise may tarry right God is willing to teach us patience just because it doesn't happen straight away doesn't mean your faith has not been received it does not mean your prayer has not been I'm heard the answer is on its way amen Daniel was praying for about 20 odd days I may get the figure wrong but the angel was trying to get to him to give him the answer but Satan was blocking the visitation of the angel but he stayed in prayer right it should be the same thing with us though the enemy may try and block the answer right we should stay in prayer getting ahold of God hallelujah I'm glad that that's the case we should keep pressing on Abraham was 25 you know he was a hundred years old when he had Isaac amen and he was strong giving faith to God fully persuaded he was able to do that which he is promised I mean so we should be the same way so don't be don't be downcast if it's one day and then it's two days and then three I'm not gonna do that for 25 years old Lewis County but don't don't become downcast you should be it's even more impossible now than it was the first day hallelujah just just be strong giving God praise God has identified himself through seven Church eight down through seven Church changes and his people he identified himself with Luther he identified himself with Wesley he identified himself with the Azusa Street movement and he identified himself with the Prophet messenger brother ham said that on their high river hee hee just have to beat it when he turned up right it wasn't brother Brandon during it was God doing it why was God coming to the earth and a greater far greater ministry than any other contemporary of the Prophet because God was trying to get your attention Here I am I'm looking for my bride Here I am I'm looking for my body I'm come to get her and take her away holy that's wise put on tape because is because spirits travel on words write the words I speak to you Jesus in that spirit of my life I mean so it just wasn't your this this spirits travel on words that's why it's recorded on tape because there's a life that travels on that word and when that word has received in faith thus the Holy Spirit comes I mean it quickens that word to our souls hallelujah he says at the end of his ministry modern events made clear by prophecy he speaks about many times speaks about the body of Christ being built through seven Church ages he says now we're not in the feet we're not in the arms right we're up now in the head and he says it's fixing to go he says and now it's in the head fixing to go manifesting and full measure the bride the same as from the beginning hallelujah have you looked at yourself in the mirror have you well actually boy every day I normally brush my teeth whatever but we have you have you have you looked at yourself in this mirror hallelujah because you should be able to look at this and say this has become flesh right well everything that God has prophesied of the Bible of a bride has become flesh in us how did how did Jesus come here by the words of the Prophet says in Matthew let's go to Matthew 1 and verse 20 Matthew 1 and 20 now this is this is Joseph here Mary has told him that that she's with child he's wondering how this can be he's thinking of putting away privately bases but while he thought on these things behold the angel Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now this was all done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child shall bring forth a son they shall call his name Emmanuel which is which being interpreted is God with us so the body of Christ came to the earth through them through the words of the Prophet right the words of the Prophet brought the body to the earth as that Oh keV I say it that way because here was the fulfillment of the prophecy now we've had now you know this entire scripture actually speaks of you Ruth was a prophecy of you Rahab is a prophecy of you hallelujah Bathsheba is a prophecy of you I mean Tama is a prophecy of you right and then Paul's writings their prophecy of you the bride as Christ fulfilled the Old Testament brother brems is the bride will fulfill the New Testament hallelujah so now there's all this prophecy sitting around but you know it's like when when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that word circled the earth for about 800 years waiting for the right time for the right womb hallelujah Mary you know God just doesn't like you know what God is not a lottery let's do a school raffle did you get the ticket I you won congratulations yeren that's not how it works with God he knows who's gonna fulfill the word amen he knows so so when when Isaiah spoke a virgin shall conceive in God's mind and that word was married right so that was circling the earth and finally Mary was born and in the right season an angel goes to her and speaks to her and something in her says I believe what this man is telling me let it be unto me according to thy word and she found herself pregnant with the baby hallelujah that's the same thing as the church has been built that way so the bride has been built that way right and so now here we are and this is why you know never let the valley of the spoken word never let it be diminished never let it be diminished you have a man stand in 1933 Adolf Hitler will you know will will risin you know there'll be a world war then he'll come to mysterious end Mussolini will rise up and vaidhi Theo Pia fall his feet and then he'll come to a shameful end just a few phrases and but you know the manpower and the lives and the energy of Nations and the war effort wasn't a small thing to fight World War two there's a super powers rising whole whole nations were now were geared into total war factories were turned into making elements and planes and training people and people moved all the way around the earth you're fighting on distant lands just because of a phrase hallelujah amen Moses just is a phrase you worship God you worship the gods of your neighbors then the Lord will take you out of this land in you and you've gone to distant lands just a phrase you see what happens in Israel they begin to worship idols then he comes back on down Babylon rises up amen have you ever looked at the magnitude of this you know sometimes we just skip over things you know Daniel sees a vision of the Gentile kingdoms to the you know frog from near bikinis that down to the time of the end how long does it take to read that just just a few moments and hears people God allows them to come to the earth they have ambition and they gather knowledge and they have different technologies different battle tactics whole whole people's lives are given we want to see our Empire rise will it defeat our enemies great effort is put in and then when the next Kingdom comes in the former Kingdom can't stop them just like you look at it has anyone ever looked at Alexander the Great anyone done any study of Alexander the Great the Persians could not defeat him they had far greater manpower far greater Empire but they couldn't defeat him you know what it is because the Word of God said they would not and the Grecians would and waving would invade and conquer them didn't matter how much they tried to stop it and how much they you know planned and they would yeah there would have been a lot of generals in the Persian army stressing because if they've got defeated pulling air he'd would have been taken off by the king there'd been a lot of people stressing how can we defeat this man from Greece is like lightning on his horses and all these different things they couldn't defeat him I'm laboring this for a reason they couldn't defeat him no matter how hard they tried because the Bible prophesied they'd never do it and then the Romans came upon the scene the Greece could stop them I mean the Greece couldn't stop them all of the Jews and the Promised Land couldn't stop the Romans come in and invade they couldn't stop us prophesied they had to be there didn't matter how much people tried now you come down to the end and now we're living the time of the feet of the image of the iron and clay mixed together that Catholic spirit has gone through the whole world and it's partially strong partially weak but what happens after that is a stone cut out of the mountain made without hands it rolls down smites the image and the feet that that image now is breaking into dust and scared to the four winds and that stone becomes a great mountain that fills the whole earth that is the kingdom of God do you think Satan can stop that happening just like the just like the Persians can stop the Greeks and the Greeks can stop the Romans you know the devil can't stop the kingdom of God being established upon the earth doesn't matter how much he tries all the unbelief he pumps through the internet and the movies of the music and the whatever he can't stop it he can't stop this bride he can't stop you hallelujah he can't stop you coming to your position doesn't matter if he fights you and withstands you hey this is a contest there's a contest between God and Satan depends who you yield to the pinch is going to get the victory in your life hallelujah but we have the power in the name of Jesus amen the devil can't stop the Bride of Christ coming to her position was saying to be happy about they think you say well I've been fought brother Brown say the other day you know we're so carefree sometimes and then we become a believer and then the battles really come again we get all tense and you know cuz they want to you know that's when the battle really happens that's when the criticism really happens when you begin to put on the word when you become one with him that's when the battles really happened you say I being fought every day of my life that's good that means you're not his prisoner that means you know the devil's prisoner he's trying to defeat you but you've got to stand flat-footed in the trial stand on the Word of God stand on who you are don't back down for nothing we're not called to retreat we're call to advance amen that every promise that belongs to us don't be discouraged don't be discouraged you're I wasn't Isaac or or Jacob I might be wrong he dug some wells he came in and stopped it up the sick and well enemy came and stopped that third well I think it was then the fourth well there's enough for everyone hallelujah he kept digging and and he finally kept what what was there and sometimes the enemy you know we begin to because the devil you know we're in a battle who knows we're in a battle I thought this is a sunday-school picnic yeah you ever listed in the wrong place I'm glad I mean but the bright you know Jesus was tempted with on every point yet without sin he was tempted by every point imaginable he was tempted by every spirit every spirit amen make it well if you want to ho make a list if you want everything that we are tempted by he was tempted by because he was tempted on all points yet without certain now if he was tempted on all points I'll actually tell you this you'll be tempted on all points every spirit in this world will try and get you because the devil changes his tactic he wrote on a white horse in the beginning and then he changed and jumped on a red horse and killed the hot you're killed with the sword and then he and then when he realized relax this is just making the Christians stronger holy tribulations good trials are good that's good just like whoa brother Craig was telling us he preached his sermon on the eagle stirreth the nest well the last ones he did with his pastoring and and he said God doesn't stir the nest just the trouble the eagle he wants to show the eagle the potential in it that's why the eagle nests get stirred there and one and the mother Eagle wants the Eagle to fly it's because if the mother wants the baby to know what's in it amen it's the same thing trials come and the devil tries to come against you God wants to prove to you what's in you hallelujah job didn't know what was in until the trial you following me and then he but then God said he's a perfect man I don't know if job 40 as a perfect man yeah well I'm just job but God wanted to show them the potential in him amen and God wants to show us the potential in us a meant of his salvation and who you are in him so now nothing can stop us coming to our position so and then the devil changes tactic he's on the black horse and then it all mix together in the pale horse he just changes his ways amen and it's the same thing we may be tried but you say well I'm sick of fighting just keep tapped into your strength source we have the victory we have the victory I mean it'll be worth it all I mean it'll be worth it or when we see Jesus Amen when we keep pushing through you know the devil's defeated we're victorious amen outlawed brokers back at Calvary he doesn't have the keys to his own house he's nothing but a bluff hallelujah and he wants to identify himself with you he'll be in the trial we all know the story of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego God comes at the last moment right they're just about to be thrown in the fire maybe ask this being thrown in there is hallelujah do you think Daniel would have traded the lion's den after that experience he said the angel of the Lord when the King comes the King comes the next morning all all distress because I was running of it you know Daniels God delivered him he says Daniel II you okay and here's a voice I am O king for the angel of the Lord came stood with me this night clothed the mouths of lions do you think he would have traded that for anything hallelujah but you know sometimes you look like a hood you know the prophets say one time he saw a trial coming and God said do you really want to bypass this he said no Lord because he knew it was molding and shaping his character amen but we have mountain tops too you know you know we'll be going through some hot places women going through some glories and we should just rejoice you mean all this in heaven tune hallelujah the devil's defeated you're the devil's defeated amen if God has come to identify you've got a look and you know go look through the Old Testament who was victorious through the Old Testament God was God was victorious with Moses God was victorious with Joshua God was victorious with David God was victorious with Elijah God was victorious with Elijah God was victorious with all the prophets God was victorious and John the Baptist God was victorious in Jesus Christ when he himself came joy God was victorious and the apostles I meant and God has been victorious all the way down through the church ages because God has been manifested in every age amen God was victorious in brother parents ministry amen I don't know if he never would have heard of it but it was an evangelist in America called Billy Andrews and and he was a contemporary brother branham's and he used to see like demons like black shadows when he was preaching and then brother Branham was having a meeting in the same place he was and he said well I'm Oz we'll go along and he got put up in a balcony he never heard of brother Brown before he's sitting up in the balcony and he sees his a and he's looking towards the woman there's a door on the side the platform and the door comes open and a man comes up with a hat and as soon as this man took off his hat he's all these black streaks flee the building all these demons flee away and and and Billy Andrew said that's Elijah but as soon as the Prophet came onto the platform I mean I think we should just rejoice now we are identified with the Son of Man as we read in the beginning I meant that blessed are thee let's go back there and then we'll close I'm sorry after a camp your rejoicing so much you can't just do a bit of a shotgun machine-gun service after us cuz you're so full lesson a ye when men shall hate you see sometimes we take it the wrong way oh they hate me we should be sad no you're blessed I mean blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company we just can't be friends anymore and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil saying bad things about you blessed hallelujah for the son of man's sake no no it doesn't say that God's sake or Jesus sake the son of man's sake it's always when God manifests himself as the son of man that's where the controversy comes as to whether approach comes that's when they you know the questions come because how God manifests himself was always different to what man thinks he should be doing I mean and the son of man has been revealed in this day this messages son of man Jesus Christ revealed right so when they shall reproach you cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake amen I'm blessed every day I'm blessed rejoicing in that day hallelujah rejoice ye in that day for behold your reward is great in heaven for an alike manner did their fathers unto the prophets he's saying in this day when they cast your name out of evil as evil and they reproach you and they hate you for the son of man say you're to rejoice and leap for joy don't just be a little bit happy be happy hallelujah leap for joy what but but then why shall we leap for joy because your reward is great in heaven as brother Ram was told when he preached a meeting and a and a man Karthik Danny Henry came up said brother Bram I don't want to sound sacrilegious but that could be the another chapter on the book of Revelation he spoke in French he spoke in tongues he didn't know French there's a French interpreter for the UN a speaking lady from Louisiana was here and then another man and they and they wrote down the interpretation it is because thou has chosen the harder way which is my way this is your choosing right blessed are you in this decision for a great portion of heaven awaits you there's a tremendous victory in the love divine this is because you've chosen the harder way you chose it and it's my way a great portion of heaven awaits you a great portion of the word awaits you and this will bring for the great victory in love divine hallelujah so so so what is what is it then that your reward is great in heaven it's because if you stand with him and [Music] amen it was worth it it was worth it it'll be worth it all and it's worth it now I would rather at peace with God ow I mean there's nothing between my soul with my savior I don't have to make anything right he made it right hallelujah I don't have to worry about whatever men will say about me what does he say about me hallelujah so it'll be worth it there's a great reward in heaven I mean that's why we should leap for joy hallelujah I'll finish what this is from the masterpiece God's making your masterpiece do you know how Lou you should put yourself in a frame as do you look at yourself as a masterpiece of his word you should do he should do because the devil wants to beat us down you know oh we just sit has saved by grace we asked in a saved by grace but we're not just sinners saved by grace right we are the Bride of Christ called where are the elected ones we are the cold ones where the justified ones with the glorified ones with the redeemed ones we're maintenance image we are the feminists part of him right we were sinners one time but now I'm not that person I'm not her I don't know who that that God died and I'm not resuscitating and I'm not I'm not harvesting organs either he can stay as he was right but I'm not that person one day the old being Lord died holy the new one lives it's not me it's Christ that liveth in me hallelujah so one time we were sinner and we're still saved by grace I'm not diminishing that but some people they just kind of beaten down I'm just a sinner saved by grace you just stand on your feet God doesn't want these jellyfish floating through where's the battle this person you gotta overcome something amen and so we're here to be overcomers right now we're over comers he said I feel like an overcomer do you still believe he's still walking with the Lord are your eyes fixed on him all you want to do is live for him that's overcoming you know that's overcoming because there's a multitude of voices saying don't go that way there's nothing to it it's just a bunch of excitement it'll burn out one day how do you know it's real question question question question and you say well I met him I met the Lord Jesus Christ he's called me I responded to that call hallelujah I know it's real I know he is real and it take him four thousand years to make this masterpieces speaking of the Lord Jesus now he's been for nearly two thousand years making another masterpiece a bride for Christ another masterpiece and so doing he does it by his never-changing method the same way he made the masterpieces word that's the way he makes his masterpiece because he can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's a perfect word so he's been making a perfect masterpiece as he said the only way he can do make a perfect one is by a perfect word well had he knows a perfect word we hear these words if I've told the truth and I'd be a servant of God let him come down and prove that it's true and it happened to multiple times in front of multiple thousands of people God came down the platform to say I'm identified with this messenger I am not ashamed to say he is preaching my work and he came down and he vindicated it and he vindicated it and Eve indicated saying this is me this is not her who's who's heard the last part of looking to the unseen in 1959 brother Browns making an altar call and then yes it's come down when he come down he says don't you feel impulse 18q and his voice changes he says I'm the Lord God that raised Christ from the grave you know william branham has nothing to do with this he's just treated his life to me that I'm just using his lips it's me I'm the Lord and it comes back in brother Brent speaks come down come down so he God is saying the man has nothing to do with it bro Graham said I wanted to be a trapper I never wanted to be like this God but God took him and he gave him his life and God stepped into that vessel to speak to you to speak to I he says this wasn't my idea comes to the seals he said I had one idea about it then he came down to the room and showed me what the seals were night after night he showed me what it was you know cuz God is saying this is me hallelujah and that's how you know it's a perfect word is because the perfect one comes in behind us and says this is me and then also you be able to say this is molding me this is changing me from glory to glory hallelujah I'm not going down with the world I'm going up hallelujah I'm ascending you know we are ascending I mean you know we're not descending I mean we're i sending we're going higher we're not falling with the world this world is falling we'll continue to fall but the bride is not falling with the world that's why there's such a gulf he says the years grab by the world goes this way and we're looking at we say how can this happen and we're going up there's a gulf you know brother M sees a vision of the preview of the bride he sees them at the end they look like the first bride and they walk in saw me amen so the son of man is not ashamed to call to be identified with you hallelujah we shouldn't be ashamed to be identified with him amen we have the musicians please are you glad to be a believer hallelujah glory to God I'm in let's dance shall we I mean they sing that song from glory to glory he's changing me it's likeness and image to perfect me the love of God shown to the world lujah Amy I'm so glad
