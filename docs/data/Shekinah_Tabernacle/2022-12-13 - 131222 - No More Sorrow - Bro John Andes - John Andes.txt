I want to thank you for your love for my wife and us to be able to join with you and I'm looking forward to that amen our little church is in Washington Ferndale Washington and um we don't own this building we just rent it it's like a community center but uh it's um it meets our needs and we have some of the saints that gather there with us and that's in Ferndale Washington and we bring in all the sound equipment and take it down and clean every service and and so you all pray that we can get a nice little building like like you all have that'd be really wonderful amen we'll take it amen so if you are unhappy well we'll take it amen but I think y'all are happy to have a building and happy to have a place and this is a picture just out near where we live near Mount Baker there I think you all live in a place where there's earthquakes and things well this is an active volcano and they say one day you know it's part of that ring of fire it'll it'll probably go off one day and we need to make sure we're safe In the Arms of Jesus whether it's earthquakes or dangers or harms we just want to be ready to meet the Lord thank you for moving your service I think you normally have it on a Wednesday don't you well what are y'all doing here tonight amen yeah amen well I think we're just family and the family of God and you're looking to the Lord to just lead you to what to minister eat service and that it would be personal for each congregation and so the Lord laid this on our heart to speak so if you like to stand no more sorrow I'd like to just speak on that together and we'll take our Bibles and turn to Isaiah chapter 35 don't you love the word and love the presence of the Lord Shekinah Tabernacle and Wellington praise the Lord we were here I was here one time before way back 31 years ago when we got married we we got married 30 coming on 31 years ago and we came to uh New Zealand for our honeymoon and went to Lake taupo and came down to Wellington and so I guess we're coming back home you know if y'all if y'all cut the tires that we were driving on we'll have to stay around a little bit but well the weather today was really good your pastor took us through the town he said normally it's just windy and blowy there was no wind it was nice and quiet and sunny it's like these people live in the millennium and then brother Ben showed me a photo of Sister Christine in Africa with a cheetah with her just sitting there right by a cheetah I'm like maybe we are in the Millennium amen y'all pet lines and everything around here either that or your pastor's wife is fearless and so I think it's both amen maybe we'll come into the Millennium and your pastor's wife is fear let's say amen hallelujah I was at the same place and I get all nervous around lions and tanks and she looked fine she looked like she was just fine so maybe the line is laying down with a lamb again and amen I know you love the word so let's turn to Isaiah 35 verse 10 no more sorrow this will mean maybe more to the middle aged than older ones but the young people just to put something in your heart Isaiah 35 verse 10. let's read it out loud and The Ransom of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting Joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee did your bible say that sorrow and sighing how many know what a sigheth sign because of life because of troubles sorrow and sign shall flee away can you turn to Isaiah 51 verse 11. another place where this is mentioned in the Bible about sorrow and mourning m-o-u-r-n-i-n-g morning shall flee away let's read this verse out loud you sounded so good earlier therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing unto Zion and everlasting Joy shall be upon their head there and sorrow and mourning shall flee away praise the Lord have you ever had sorrow have you ever been sad we're speaking tonight about a place where sorrow and mourning are going to flee away one last place is the Book of Revelation excuse me for keeping you standing but what are y'all normally do on a Tuesday night y'all usually home or something right we got this is a special meeting so I pray the Lord or just maybe maybe he arranged this whole evening just for you to let you know that he cares and he's mindful of your life whether you're young or old he's mindful of your sorrow he's mindful of your mourning and your sign and he wants you to be encouraged that there's coming a day when all that's going to flee away I like this these verses here in Revelations 21 verse 3. and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God I'm sorry but verse 1 and 2 talked about the new Heaven and the new Earth and verse 2 John was speaking about the holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so it wasn't just talking about a city like Jerusalem or Wellington or Auckland but he was talking about a people he was speaking about a people and the atmosphere that's going to be around that place would you like to know what it's going to be like there's not going to be sorrow there is not going to be mourning and a lot of sign going on in heaven because the Tabernacle of God is with men verse 3 and we we read that already the Tabernacle of God is with men verse 4 and God shall wipe away some of the tears from their eyes they're going to weep some tears and then and he's just going to wipe you know one out of ten up no the Bible says he's going to wipe all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away he's talking about the things we're going through now the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful when we look at verse 4 about God wiping all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain that's not just physical pain it's also emotional pain it's also pains that come from your memory of things that have happened in your past God bless you tonight as you have your seats what was the same word tonight in all three of these verses what is the emphasis why would the Lord lay this on brother John's heart to come all the way from America and speak in this little church tonight on Shekinah Tabernacle of all the hundreds or thousands of sermons that would we could have spoke that he would emphasize this word sorrow then it must be for someone tonight I believe he's a personal God and he'll do that for you I want to announce tonight a great announcement tonight we are going to a land where there is no more sorrow I'll just announce it again amen we're going to a land where there is no more sorrow if you look back maybe in the past week of your life maybe even the past month or the months or years of your life there's been sorrow for you maybe you've heard stories about other people's lives that cause a sorrow maybe it's not personal to you but you hear about others that's lost a loved one or someone's passed away and it causes sorrow you hear on the news things going on in Ukraine and you know hospitals being hit or you know things being people suffering with no electricity or innocent children women being hurt or raped or murdered young people children families being broken and it causes sorrow clashes in China with the police and covid restrictions and all these things people all over the world I think you went through some months of covet and things here in New Zealand and it causes pain it causes suffering it causes isolation and a person wondering why and why is all this happening maybe why did it happen to me so what is sorrow tonight are you all doing okay I I know your pastor and brother brother Andy are gone but y'all can still be alive and or or maybe I just came down so close to home I'm touching a nerve maybe I'm doing that tonight is that right so no more sorrow so what is sorrow if it's actually so great of us something that it's not going to be there in heaven then what it is what is it sorrow is pain that comes from a past event in your life that triggers in the inside of a person certain responses it triggers things and almost always it's negative sorrow is negative and sorrow what is sorrow is we speak of Sorrow it is sadness it is a Mourning as we read in the scriptures there'll be no more sorrow or Mourning that could be inward mourning or sadness but it could be something that's just on the outside like it's just so great of a sorrow in your heart it just comes through your eyes and it causes tears sorrow can be caused by disappointments that happen in your life it can come from challenging events that you're going through and you know God Made You human how many know that tonight I I think most of you are human that I'm speaking to We're Not Angels we're not seraphims you know God Made You human and it's not immoral to be human it's not immoral to have sadness you're not an evil person because you have sorrow that's something that God Made You in response to things that you're going through sometimes it can be emotional hurt it can be a loss of something it can be loss of someone in your life when I say a loss of something it could be a loss of virtue or a loss of of something that was given to you and it was taken away I you all sang the song tonight we have a father who will never leave you and he'll never leave you and brother John has dealt with a lot of young people and children in my life and there's nothing that is more harder for a young person to go through than the loss of a father or the loss of a mother and divorce or in separation and to have a father walk out on a young lady or to have a young lady deal with the loss of a father or the rejection of a father or maybe he's present but he's absent in spirit and he doesn't give her the emotional strength the worst thing that can happen for a young man is a rebuke of his father and to sell for a young man to hear from a father that he's no good well he'll never amount to nothing it causes sorrow it causes pain it's nothing like to have a father walk out on a family and it just the rejection in the morning even with the Holy Ghost you can see there's a lot of weight and sorrow on people how many know what I'm talking about it but to hear those songs he'll never leave you and he'll never forsake you or he'll never leave you alone ought to give you a lot of confidence tonight that no matter what you're going through that the Lord Jesus is with you sorrow is something where you've lost something in your life and all of us were born with our old natures and we were bent negative we were bit negative you know there's natural things that happen and people can tell us just the world would tell us that we can do better when we have sorrow they to alleviate the effects of Sorrow this isn't just from the scripture or the word but it can be the world tells you you know that you can speak to a close friend about your sorrow they say you can you know avoid whatever factors causing you to be in sorrow have a balanced diet you know exercise more regularly get more adequate sleep and things or occupy your life with more positive things that's just what the world would say if you're full of Sorrow tonight but I believe for the Believers there should be more of a spiritual response I believe for us there can be more of an eternal response that is not just short term but it's more long-term that we can be touched by the master that the Lord Jesus can actually tell us who we are and that we're Sons and Daughters of his and that there's a long-term Vision there's a long-range plan for us that's beyond the pain I think you're hearing that tonight I I think you're hearing the words even the few scriptures that we read that we are going to a place maybe I'll just go back and show you where there is no more sorrow and a place where I'll sign shall flee away I'm in how many's ever lost your joy or lost your peace well I'm we just read a scripture where sorrow and sighing are going to be fleeing away you're not going to lose your joy you're not going to lose your happiness you're not going to lose your strength but but you're actually going to lose your sorrow and your days of Sorrow could be a mother that just signed just because of the burdens of having a family or a brother that that is trying to make ends meet or make a living and you're you feel rejected even in the country of New Zealand you can feel rejected well we're going to a place where sorrow and mourning shall flee away when you don't feel like a failure I mean even the best among us we feel like failures oftentimes but we're going to a place that's already been paid for and I don't want to just speaking all about in the future I believe there's Heavenly places that we can come into with Christ that he will he can wipe away all tears from our eyes and let us know that even when we're though we're going through a time of sorrow and pain that he can wipe away those tears but we are going to a place where there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away brother John was just in the eastern part of Canada a few weeks ago and I took this photo right by the ocean and I I just wanted to share it with you along with the the things that we're speaking about tonight and things that are to be just notice the the date there in December I see some of you writing notes tonight that's very good this is one of brother branham's last messages on things that are to be he says we build a hospital ever so good and practice with the best medicine that we got and thousands die in it daily but oh my in the kingdom of God there is no death there is no sorrow amen there's no need of these things of the world but we've passed from this thing let's say this thing into the realities of God where we struggle so hard to try to find through science and the more scientific we get the more death we bring on ourselves we're fighting a losing battle there so turn loose of it turn loose of it and by faith believe Jesus Christ the son of God tonight and accept him he is the one somebody say praise the Lord [Music] you're full of Sorrow when you lose something you're full of Sorrow when something is opposite then the way you think it ought to be it just is not happening right you feel sorrow when there's a memory of your past and it's just like a Pang of something comes through your heart that's called sorrow I trust this is helping somebody tonight something happened to you someone said something and that could have been days ago or weeks or years ago but it stays in your memory it stays in your heart Satan uses those things to make you feel unworthy and make you feel dirty even if it wasn't your fault even if it was your fault I'm I'm going I'm going there tonight if it wasn't your fault and somebody took advantage of you and you just feel dirty you feel full of Sorrow God's here tonight to let you know he cares about you I feel uh Pastor Freddie that's why God would bring a brother from America all the way to New Zealand on a Tuesday night meeting is to tell one of his sheep that that I care for you and I love you heaven and the minister isn't here to take away your past he's here to give you uh the the word and God's presence and for the Lord to come into these meetings to be able to deal with your past and I can't take away your past but we can certainly allow the Lord Jesus to deal with what someone said about you it was so negative and it was wrong and may I'm sorry that you even feel the way that you do to bring sorrow I think sometimes we need to have that in our services where we say I'm sorry more instead of thinking like we got it all together and we're so strong and and we're so great Christians and we got a deep Revelation well maybe we need to be more honest and say I'm sorry I'm really sorry that you were hurt today I'm really sorry that you went to work today and felt that that trouble I'm sorry that what happened in that school room or in that locker room that somebody said something that hurt you I'm really sorry now you say oh preacher you know oh you don't even know what you're talking about I feel like the Lord's talking to somebody tonight whatever happened to you maybe it was in a church somewhere maybe it was an uncle somewhere I just prayed for a young lady this week that was afraid and something was going on in her family and she was all alone and her uncle was doing inappropriate things to with her and I just say God help that person and strengthen them because it brings a lot of Sorrow life is full of Sorrow and we have to have a place of release I'm not speaking tonight about just some land beyond the river I I don't believe all of it should be over there I believe while we're here and while we're while we're in this pail of Sorrow while we're going through the valley while we're trying to turn the corner on this journey of life and on your tracks and on your journey that the Lord Jesus can can give you strength it can speak a word to you our lives are full of Sorrow I want to ask you a question tonight do you think there will be sorrow in heaven do you think that there'll be sorrow in heaven the answer is no there won't be no sorrow in heaven God knows about what we are going through in this life and not not all of our life are we going to be strong now all of our life are we going to feel like we've got it all together God comes to us at Seasons in our lives to let us know in the things of God and I really believe the words of God and our camp meetings and our midweek services our Sunday services our home lives should be opportunities to Bear ye one another's burdens do you all believe that let's read sometimes we kind of brush over these things what brother Branham said before this quote of in the kingdom of God There Is No Death there is no sorrow what did he say before that and what did he say after that can I preach to you tonight our schools and things are a blow up as God never said go forth and make schools or even have Bible schools you know that it's kind of amazing brother Bradham would speak negatively about Bible schools yet he sent his son to one did you all know that Billy Paul was a in the prophet's home and he was smoking cigarettes 14 years old and 15 years old brother Billy Paul was smoking cigarettes in a prophet's home and when brother brownham heard about that and when the angel of the Lord revealed it to him he sent him down to Waxahachie Texas which was about 16 hours away down from Jeffersonville to Texas to go to a Bible school that's where we met brother Perry green and other people that knew brother Billy Paul or brother Branham he would speak about Bible schools maybe you would say that's negative but he actually sent his own son there and he wanted his daughter sister Rebecca to go to a Bible School Ashbury College in in Kentucky but brother Branham said uh he never said to have Bible schools and things but he said preach the word that's what I'm doing tonight amen that's exactly right our educational system's taking us farther away from God than anything I know of that's right further away from God not build schools and hospitals and so forth that's for the world and for that group I ain't got nothing against them but they play their parts that still is not that yeah we built a hospital ever so good in practice with the best medicine we got and thousands die in it daily but oh my in the kingdom of God there is no death there is no sorrow is brother Branham saying if you're in the kingdom of God you won't have sorrow is he saying if you're a believer that you won't have sorrow that's not what he's saying he's talking about the kingdom of God which I believe we're a part of so spiritually but also the kingdom of God that we're going to There Is No Death it's even implying that if you're a believer that you won't die or there's no death or no sorrow no that's not what he's saying we we call it going to sleep but in the kingdom of God there is no death there is no sorrow what is he talking about Brother John when he says in the kingdom of God There Is No Death there is no sorrow there's no need of these things of the world we passed him this thing into the realities of God where we struggle so hard to try to find through science and the more scientific we get the more death we bring on ourselves we're fighting a losing battle there so turn loose of it and by faith believe Jesus Christ the son of God tonight and accept him he is the one now friends we need to be more sensitive with one another sometimes we need more than just a Band-Aid in our church services we're coming into some camp meetings thank you brother Cuban is that how you say it Cuban did I say it okay I'll talk South African hey man I'll get bad by the end of this week I'll talk Afrikaans and when we get together like this we need to realize that it's more than just a little Band-Aid what people need sometimes you might be sitting on a row with someone or a person might be in the room or come to the camp that really needs a heart surgery they need a heart transplant it might take more than just an evening service or a morning service it might take a few services and we need to be sensitive about that we we need to be sensitive about the waiting room be sensitive that we need to wait on one another that's part of communion Paul taught the Believers to wait on one another and we need to realize people are going through issues there's things that people go through in life and I'm not talking about just young people you say oh that's a young people's issue no we got old people that that have issues we got ministers wives that need help we got deacons and trustees and and helpers that need the Lord We're All in This Together like we're a bunch of people from a lot of different countries it's all been thrown in this together we're making Heaven our home but we need to be really serious sometimes and realize that we got to give each other room to to grow through this and break through some of these things come on tonight friends we got to be willing to wait in the waiting room and not just but like learn to get in the waiting room and like get desperate and get in prayer and hold up one another and bear you one another's burdens and we need the Lord Jesus to move greater than ever before in fact I'll just say it the way it is you know I think you'd agree that we need the Lord Jesus at this Family Camp more than ever before we we don't want to just be having meetings we want the Lord to come down so what is science preparing for you more death but yet most of us are going to drive cars to the camp we flew on an airplane today it's a lot quicker I was telling brother Freddie it's a lot quicker than riding a mule down here from Auckland to Wellington we got here in an hour it's a lot quicker than a mule or a donkey or a camel or riding a bicycle I'm glad for that and tomorrow we're going to fly back and be preaching in another place tomorrow night I'm glad for these airplanes but it's not going to be an airplane that gets us in the rapture it's not your jeans or your shirt or your nice dress or your hair that's going to get you over this pain and sorrow you can be looking the part and yet there be something going on we need the Lord we we need his hand we need his foot his Footprints to walk by your way and his fingerprint on your life I want it Lord Jesus all these sputniks and everything going up in all these things to scatter death and everything across the Earth don't look to that can I be honest with y'all I think there's a World Cup going on football foot soccer whatever we need to don't look to those things Sports and Hollywood and whatever your job and your salaries and we look to how we dress or you know how we live and what kind of shoes we wear don't look to that turn your head higher than that towards heaven look to where Jesus sits on the right hand of God tonight every living to make intercessions on our confession oh of what we believe his word to believe the truth to be the truth how many believe his word is the truth tonight the atmosphere that we choose to live in the positive music and the things the people that were around how we treat one another is very important what goes on in our life and what what is plugged into your life is going to come out of your life so we need to be plugged into Christ plugged into his word because it will come out of his friends whatever we're plugged into and we have a responsibility even tonight we have a sacred responsibility to Christ we have a sacred responsibility to respond to the Holy Spirit and brother Branham talked about this as one of his last messages there in Shreveport Louisiana the invisible union he talked about these things what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman we see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman as a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer let's all say prayer to the word and to Christ none of that has anything to do with the preacher or what church you go to or the instrument sir the song leader we have a sacred responsibility to prayer how you doing tonight in there to the word Antichrist we need to look to him turn away from your sorrow turn away from your pain we all have pain we all have suffering we all have things that have happened that we regret or we wish would have never happened we wish we could take it away and put an eraser on and I'm not belittling your issue I'm not I'm not speaking about it um lightly to mean that we're not bearing bearing it with you but I'm here to encourage you to may God give you the strength to look Beyond those things and you have a responsibility your whole life from now to the Future to prayer and to the word and to Christ we have a responsibility for those things when there's a loss can I go on just a few more minutes maybe this is helping somebody tonight there we have a loss of a family member and death it causes sorrow maybe you lose a friend somebody that's been a friend to you in a relationship you know guys and girls girls and guys and you can get rejected by someone or something it can be a very hurtful thing it can be a very traumatic thing in relationships well y'all are really quiet right there amen there can be situations that's going on in Old Wounds and failures and misunderstandings that have happened and it really hurts you and causes you sorrow you can put a smile on and kind of look the part but when you turn away your heart is just like a dagger's there I'm putting a word on it tonight for you it's called sorrow and you're not weird and you're not an odd person and you're not strange because you bear that it's called sorrow humans have sorrow but aren't you thankful tonight at the scriptures that we read and what we're hearing that we're going to a land where there is no more sorrow all that's going to be taken away all the sign all the crying all the pain all the Death all the separation there's no job there's no time clock there there's no you know there's no Dole there there's no you know weekly rent due there's no monthly rent due I mean how much you're going to pay for your future home have you ever thought about that hmm it's like those guys that showed up to the Pearly Gates and they had a bunch of block bars in their backpacks and they're carrying all these burdens of of gold and everything and they're gold and they wanted to bring their gold to heaven and the angels kind of laughing and chuckling a little bit look at those guys you know they'll say what are you talking about it well the angel said what are you bringing these blocks of gold here for and all these things you got in your backpack you don't need that what are you talking about that you know the streets are paved with that stuff here streets are paying for the golden people's always working for money and working for gold and working for trophies and and the angels they're just kind of looking and saying what are you doing that for the streets are paved with gold up here that's what we drive around on up here if they I don't know driving around in heaven but I'm just saying the streets are paved with gold all the diamonds and things people want to flash their Rings you know and show how rich they are well you know all the jewels and all those things you know I mean your future home is it worth 20 000 a month in heaven you'll never be able to afford that some of you just need to learn to accept gifts when God gives it to you and just say Lord I know I'm not worthy I'm not going to try to live the rest of my life in some Works program I just receive it Lord I receive you Jesus sometimes it can go from feeling on top of the world just on top of it and in a matter of seconds you just feel like you're at the bottom you can just feel like so fantastic and euphoric so wonderful and then within the matter of seconds be like on the bottom that doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean you're a bad person but you cannot live your life in constant sorrow I'm going to say some things to help you you cannot let sorrow destroy your life you can't let sorrow continue make you miserable all the time and you need to stop living fake all the time say well then I'm going to be miserable in front of everybody and I'm going to let my depression rule my linear that's not right either you're talking the devil's language you can't live your life in constant sorrow pain can't be your leader the Lord Jesus is your leader but brokenheartedness is a real thing you that no medical fields that you can actually die of a broken heart they say Jesus died of a broken heart it's actually a medical term how many know that you can die of a broken heart I just heard of it in the last few days uh someone's spouse passed away and within months the sister passed away and what it was you know they just had lived their whole lives together and they're just mold they just can't they just can't hardly do anything without their spouse some of us need to do that spiritually so I can't even live a day without you I mean Lord where are you in my life I need you Lord where'd you go God maybe there's camp meetings whether Esau will be a moment that we can cry out to God and that God can restore back to people and give back to them that all the years that can that it can come from a verse in the Bible in Joel I will restore all the years that God could take years of sorrow and pour back in joy and pour back in peace somebody would receive that in the name of the Lord stop putting it as a verse in the Bible or something in your house a little slogan you know something on your refrigerator say God put it in my Heart Lord God I'm sitting there with my hearts broken I'm full of Sorrow why why did this happen in my life and you sometimes God doesn't answer our questions the way that we feel yada but he just does something for you and as you mature in Christ you look back and you see it's not always that he's taken the burden away he's given me strength to Bear the burden have you learned that sometimes he doesn't take away the storm he gives you strength to go through the storm how many know that a hurricane a hurricane can be so destructive but right in the middle of A hurricane's the eye how many know that there's the eye of a hurricane it's just calm there it's peace actually the sun can shine right down through the middle of a hurricane it's called the eye of the hurricane and right around it within feet it can just be shaking and violent violent violent emotions and feelings are like this and that and then just come into a place of peace and they have airplanes the Navy has airplanes that fly into those how many know what I'm talking about and they they actually fly right into hurricanes and they're shaking and moving and you can see this and why and you can see pilot and they're all strapped in the things are going everywhere you wouldn't want to have your coffee sitting over there be all over the place and then it'll be just shaking and like every every boat on this thing is just shaking and rivets just my if you're loose You're Gonna Go Crazy or maybe you ever felt like you're going crazy oh God I feel like I'm going crazy and then all of a sudden it'll come and it's just peace peace I could show you pictures tonight and they the Sun's shining right down in the middle of this eye of the storm it's like the lovely Lord Jesus he gives you he gives you peace in the midst of the storm you've heard that before peace in the midst of the stormy say I want this storm to leave in the name of Jesus I want this storm and God says nope I'm going to give you peace in the middle of the storm it's not you holding on he's holding on to you and you realize the scripture is more than a verse when he says I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'm with you in the storm I I sense his presence even when I don't know what to do and I cry out to you he's right there so I encourage you to rise above these things as you allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you set your wings on the wings of Faith do you all sing that song here do you all know that the man that wrote that song goes to our church brother Mark aho he's right there in our community he lives right in the town where our churches set your wings to the Wings of Faith you can fly to a higher place do not struggle it's by grace set your wings I think he wrote it on a napkin if I remember right he wrote this on a napkin and now it's it's sung all over the world when brother John travels all over the world in foreign countries and foreign languages set your wings to the Wings of Faith it came from a brother it's right in our church just like you set your wings so don't let sorrow be the sled that Satan tries to push you downhill it's time to get off his sled it's summertime here in New Zealand right summertime y'all thankful for the Sun but where brother John lives sister Sharon it's winter time and in the mountains and places there's snow that comes down and the other day it snowed snow snowed and while I was studying for a message I think it was I was going to be speaking on sorrow and I got I saw these pictures and videos coming through of Believers and they were going down the hill you know dads and moms you know dads do things like that with their kids and they go down the hill and they they jumped on the hill and went on down wow that's amazing doubt sledding on down the hill in the snow but some of us are going down the hill on a sled the devil's got you on a sled of Sorrow and you know what some of you need to do you need to get off that sled and you see someone that's going down and their foot's dragging off or their hand or they wow and they put out their hand and put out their food and they go crashing and get off that sled they don't want to crash into a a a wall or a tree or something where some of you need to get off that sled of Sorrow the devil's pushed you downhill you need to get off his sled tonight you need to say you know what I'm going down I'm going down I'm getting off your sled devil you're pushing me down you're doing a well if you you might hurt yourself you get off this sled I'm getting off this lid Satan You Don't Own Me God owns you God's way is the right way tonight in the name of the Lord I'm preaching to you tonight I'm preaching against devils and demons in darkness that might be trying to flood somebody's mind don't put it all on the preacher one can send a thousand two ten thousand we ought to be set in a ray an army said we're here to defeat the Devil there's no sickness there's no demon there's no devil there there's no attemptation that's going to destroy our young people our children or or our family members or our loved ones how many's ever heard of people putting someone else out from under the blood or churches putting people out from under the blood well I think we need to put them under the blood before we try to take them out from under the blood we need to have our services and the power of God strike our meetings and be able to have talk to people in a way that can be so Direct in the Holy Ghost deal in a situation that's the blood's crying out that's the blood screaming out bleeding the word bled for that person that's what's happening tonight the word is bleeding for you do you understand what I'm talking about say is that possible that the word would bleed yes that's Christ bleeding for you every time you do something bad or wrong it's like punching him it's like that blood around the earth saying she didn't mean that he didn't mean that we have a high priest tonight that's groaning out and saying God you died on the cross so that sister don't have to bear that pain that shame that sorrow that teenager isn't made to bear that he's going to go crazy she's gonna go crazy if she keeps trying to bear that sorrow I'm here to take that sorrow off your shoulder to to let you know that we're in this together you're not some weird person and strange odd person we're all trying to find ourselves can I say something you say oh that's just young people that are trying to find themselves no there's a lot of you adults that are trying to find yourself what job should I take where should I live should we move here God help me with my attitude toward my husband my wife and come on friends I mean well our children really need the Lord where some of you older ones have just learned to cover it up a lot better than they do you say well that person's really hanging their emotions on their on their shoulder they just wear it around well all you are is just you've you've learned to cover it up better maybe you are stronger maybe you are able to not let it show out there and somebody else comes in and they just show it all over their place for their face their they're weak in that way we're supposed to Bear one another's burdens aren't we a body around here I mean we don't want Hypocrites to feel comfortable we want them to feel like cast your burdens unto Jesus Caster burden unto Jesus [Applause] [Music] I mean you can you can sing it but do you do it yep you ought to be saying I'm holding my burdens unto myself I'm not a songwriter amen I'm holding my burdens unto myself that's why you have sorrow we will all have sorrows help me close tonight amen we're all going to have sorrows we're all gonna have pain you will have sufferings as a Christian I'm not here to paint some false conception that if you give your heart to the Lord that you're not going to have suffering I think that's wrong I think it's a false facade we put out there I'll just come to the Lord just come to the Lord and all your troubles are gonna be gone brother bless God yeah bless God you're preaching a lie that's when your troubles start that's when your burdens really start that's when the devil's gonna fight you greater than ever before brother Carey he's gonna fight you more than ever you rise up in the name of the Lord be a strong Christian Hallelujah we have these things with us we through our whole life we have things that we carry and things that we are burdened about there's always going to be families in the church that are broken or there's always going to be relationships that struggle there's always going to be brothers that can't hardly keep a job I'm talking your language there's always sisters that are just always [Music] and down inside they're like being all tore up and if you really saw the real them oh we just want a perfect church and everything to be perfect I don't know where you're living at but perfect is not a sinless Perfection it's mature that means we've learned to to Bear the infirmities of the week with the poor you have with you always that's what Jesus said poor financially poor in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit I think I'm going to speak a whole message at the camp I'm blessed are the poor because we all we all want to think that oh a certain status is a certain thing and it's not that blessed are the poor you're blessed if you're poor oh wow I've never done it up before I never heard nobody preach on that before well maybe that's why people aren't happy that's poor you gotta say I'm blessed because I'm poor most of God's people are poor I better move along amen well that's what Jesus said maybe you you're not understanding it right there will be sicknesses there will be reversals but our anchor is not in those things it's in the Lord Jesus our identity is not in what others did to you or what others think of you or your failures or your faults or your weaknesses that's the outer man we're not identified by those things our hope is in the Lord from this time on forevermore say what am I supposed to do brother John I'm going to keep pressing on I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other and the Lord Jesus is going to give me strength tonight I'm interceding with you I'm groaning for your good I'm groaning all creation is groaning for you to come to your perfection in spite of the sorrow God's heart still beats inside of you and what happens in many people's lives brother Branham said it like this I saw it the other day he's talking about the way people dress and things and women and all these things he said the love of God has leaked out of your heart that's incredible the love of God has leaked out of your heart there's been a crack in your life somewhere and the oil is just sapping out all over the waters the water's flowing brother it's flowing by the meetings we've had in my the music and my the preaching I just but then it just leaks right out and by Tuesday and by Wednesday by the next Friday and it just happens over and over and people just gets full of Sorrow it's just the love of God I pray that God would put honey into your box so that that water don't go everywhere and you and you can become a vessel that can hold that and you can give oil and wine to somebody else I think this week we ought to be a less selfish than we've ever been in our whole life thinking that it all revolves around me and my health you know and camp food and oh I hope I don't get sick and I don't get sick at all got sick no no say you know what whether I'm sick or whether I'm well I'm going to have a wonderful time if I'm throwing up if my stomach hurts stop sitting around there oh my family cares [Music] you can have people sitting right in the church pew and their shoulder pain and their knees are just struggling but yet they're just spiritual they've learned to press through those things I'm not here for my knee I'm not here in my dumb man yeah we're not here for the food we're not here for the benches or the chairs or the air conditioning it might get 45 degrees down I don't know what degrees it's going to be we got to press through we got I mean on Sunday on Sunday they're at rapturing Faith RBF we had a service on the whole screen Just Came Crashing Down in the service balloons started floating across while I'm preaching you know brothers are grabbing those balloons we got to get

[Music] [Music] [Applause] how many believe the word tonight amen I believe the Lord started a good word for the last two and a half years we have been in a certain relationship and Cove had brought it about it was something that happened and then we were able to meet some of you and know some of you online and on zoom and YouTube and I was able to see hundreds and thousands of people in the last two and a half years face to face it was just through a screen a lot of times I would be all alone with just a few Brothers in the room and I was able to minister to you and many others and I looked into your faces and I could see throughout all these months and I could see the Holy Spirit working and even tonight you know when you're looking at someone's face and I just want you to know that the Lord Jesus is mindful of you tonight we came a little early and was in the fellowship meal and our brother what's your name brother Matthew was given me the testimony further Brother David because I was streaming his testimony at the youth services and I could see the Lord had really done a work in David's life and and our brother was giving expression of because he knew our brother before and he saw him during and he sees him now and I want you to know that the work of the Lord he just keeps his hand on you and we never want to just give up on God but we don't want him to give up on us and that situation and then we started to stream your services and stream your meetings and now I know you and now Brother David and I was I was connected to that service and then our brother comes and says he saw that in his life and the change well I want to see that in others and this week I believe the Lord's going to keep working and he's going to keep delivering and he just puts his arm around people and people that were backslidden and people that can be far away from God and doing doing horrible things but they can come into an atmosphere of the word and come into a servicer come into a Tuesday night meeting or come into a family camp or coming to your living room into your bedroom my son-in-law that you saw the photo of he gave his heart to the Lord when he was all alone wasn't out of service it wasn't at a meeting it wasn't a camp service or a youth meeting I'm going to give you more testimonies this week of other young people and people that the Lord filled them with the Holy Ghost in an after service how many know what an after service is that's when we've shut down the service and people are leaving and going and you know and someone was filled with the Holy Ghost a young lady was filled with the Holy Ghost in an after service and now she's married and has children and [Music] just feel like we're walking in sacred Sands together and I I want you to be real sensitive and I want you to come ready and prepared and I believe the Lord's going to do great things and I can see it on some of you tonight the Lord is just softened in your heart and he's working and he he he's trying to take away your sorrow he's trying to take away and deal with matters much deeper than the surface and he'll bring someone from a whole nother country and put him on an airplane and make him fly for hours and hours and hours till they feel like they're going crazy to just be dropped right down and just say a word right for you you say that person don't know me they don't know my life they don't know my situation and what they said was exactly what I needed to hear and you say give God praise and we give God glory and that's how it all works so can we do that
