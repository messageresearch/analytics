[Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign welcome to the house of God this morning amen who's feeling good amen have a good sleep you're refreshed ready to go ready to praise the Lord I thought John over there yawning but you know when the power of God comes you'll be wide awake and rejoicing lay that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strengths amen these bodies are sometimes a bit of a drag you know they try and hold us back but we're not going to let them this weekend um well um as brother info said we'll sleep at school or sleep at work next week [Music] he said one of the ministers will be preaching and seeing a young fellow start to fall asleep he said hey stay awake you can sleep at school tomorrow you know we prioritize things and I believe we have to keep balance but you know the Lord comes first you can never fail when you put the Lord first you'll never never fail we've just got a few little uh housekeeping things because some people weren't here yesterday a few uh that there are toilets here but they are for the ladies and the children under five so if you're a man and you're over five you have to go over that way over there but just hold on laughs um if you

also it's Marion's birthday today where's Marion OH there he is amen [Applause] [Music] he thinks he's old now because he said he's a quarter of a century old man [Music] so he thinks he's quarter of

this morning and we're going to have a great time in the Lord I really enjoyed last night we're going to have a great time this morning just worshiping the Lord and receiving his word into our hearts I believe we're receiving Rich word what we heard last night wasn't just someone in five minutes it's just thought of a few things that's a lifetime of the Lord bringing someone through things and and gathering information and trials and testings along the way and speaking to us we can just sit back and receive it without having to go through a lot of the things that you can tell that our brother went through to get what he spoke to us so let's let's receive it in appreciation and appreciate what the Lord's done that that men will surrender themselves to the Lord and go through these things and Garner things to give to Us Praise the Lord um so I've got your blessing for you this morning because the lord always wants to bless you that's what he desires for you and your All Sons and Daughters of God and he loves his children we all love our natural children don't we think about how much God loves us and so this one is actually from Ephesians uh one four to seven but I I've switched it around so I'm as though the Lord is speaking to you you might think that's pretty heavy but you know what we are we are God and flesh and there are times where we speak and it's God that's who we are this and if and and that's just that's just who we are and remember that your words have power too you're very very powerful don't be careful what you say always speak positive never speak

little devotion time we ask that you would just be here with us in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen if you'll turn with me in your Bible this morning and speak on a subject today uh the bear season you know back home we're coming into hunting season and and the brothers are getting their tags and you know because they have a certain uh intent to have a purpose in getting a bear tag and so you know they they want to go hunt some bear you know and this morning we we are we're in bear season but God has given us a tag amen he's given us he's given us uh uh the right to go after that bear and he's told us where to find those bears and you know he's told us it's it's seasoned it's open season I'm bear amen so we want to look at this just by way of an encouragement today and uh trust it'll just bless you this morning if we turn our Bibles to the book of First Samuel 17 32. you know the prophet told us to watch Russia the bearer of the North you know it's bare season out there and we see how that that bear has flexed its muscles you know it's it's he's uh he's he's awakened you know even the news headlines declared back in in in like 2014 and 15 it started to declare things like you know the bearer of the north is waking up amen that's exciting to the believer you know because we see that and we say wow didn't the prophet say something about those things amen so we were told to watch Russia and the things and these are the signs that that Redemption draws nigh amen that we are to look up amen it's Eagle time it's time to spread our wings because we're leaving amen but you know so we can look at the bear of the north and we see what it's doing up there and and Putin and and the nation there and but you know we forget sometimes that the Bears of the bears that are right in our very own lives you know we got to watch that bear also and he has certain characteristics he has certain traits and and we can pick up on those things in the word of God today you know but we want to watch that bear that can be right in our very midst and you know if you look at Russia and what is he doing you know you see how it's changing the whole economics of the world and it has brought another fear onto the world you know if covet wasn't bad enough we have Russia now to contend with and all of its influences and what it's doing and people are are greatly feared you know they're they're afraid of what's going on they don't know if they're going to have a job next year you know people are just really nervous a real anxiety has come on upon the people and man for the believer though it's different you know it's a rejoicing time amen because our King is Coming amen so we want to just look at this a little bit it's a bear season and that you have the right to hunt bears we have the right to hunt them amen you've been given the the tools to hunt bear you know we don't have to fear it you know though it's lurking out there in the darkness and you know it's a it's a great animal big animal but you know my brother and sister you have the right gun you have the right ammunition and we have the tag to have the right to to hunt that bear this morning first Samuel 17 and 32 says and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with his Philistine do we have some Young Warriors here today huh and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and then went after him I hope you're listening this morning and I went after him and smote him almost like he's a person huh and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and I smote him Hallelujah and flew him and then verse 36 says thy servants slew both the bear lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he has defy the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee you may have receipts this morning amen I feel just a little encouraged this morning I feel like we have marching orders this morning amen go and let the Lord be with you amen we see how that David had come on the scene of a great trying time and a testing time for Israel and you know there was a giant there in the land you know we've seen some Giants in our lands you know but this giant had made his boast against the armies of Israel and we see the the enemy making all kinds of boats this morning you know and it can be cancer it can be it can be Instagram it can be whatever it may be this morning or unbelief and doubt but the enemy is making his boast and he may seem like a giant you know he's big this guy's big hey man he's he's he is bigger than you he's huge you know I don't know how many of you have played rugby but maybe you can relate to this a little bit being in New Zealand you know you you have different players on the field and you know some guys are bigger than other guys and I remember I was just a little wingman you know I was the little guy on the field but you know they always had that eighth man break loose and he's coming around because he knows that wingman is just a little guy you know and it's like why pick on the little guy right but he's a big man and it's just like why him right why did he have to be built such a way why has he made a certain way you know he's he's built bigger he's stronger and and so they teach you how to deal with that oversized threat right they tell you to take him out at the legs right you got to take him right out take out his foundation right so that there's a way to deal with the oversized problem so we see how that David he looks at this Philistine and he's watching this guy and you know and he goes to Saul and and he says you know hey let me go and fight this man now my brother and sister that that is something we have a right as a Believer because Jesus Christ said whatsoever you say amen if you speak to this mountain God God has confidence in you this morning because you are strong enough because of Jesus Christ who lives in you amen so we need to recognize our position God has placed us here for a reason it's bear season it's hunting season amen we're not a we're not a suppressed group we're not a group that has been pushed aside my brother sister we are the light of the world and you turn the light on the darkness please amen the power that this world is looking for is laying inside the Believers amen love that that the world is looking for is inside the Believers so I want to encourage you when you go to your schools and things remember it's be bear season yeah man you have a right to hunt bear amen praise the Lord so thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine he knew something about what God was doing in his life he was living under an anointing he has been called To Rule and Reign amen we've been made Kings and Priests amen this man was he was he was called To Rule and Reign I want to just say that you know he wasn't king just yet at this time but he was anointed to be king see he was living under a promise of of reigning in a certain position amen we have also been like like the sons of God being adopted amen we're coming into the fullness of our adoption amen but you can see how that David he knew the anointing that was upon his life he knew his destination but he didn't have to wait until that day amen because God was going to watch over him through his journey and even though the the Lions would rise up and the Bears would rise up and the Giants would come on the scene he was still and even at that time because of the anointing that was on him he was able to withstand those things to conquer amen and so Saul we see how that Saul tries to tries to dissuade him you know this Philistine he's been training for this his whole life you know he's been trained in The Art of War you know he's got a shield Bearer you know an armor Bearer and you know he he knows about tactics of war and all these things and he's got the right kind of armor and the right kind of sword and Spear and you know he's he's a he's a fearful sight I want you to remember my brother and sister the whole Army of Israel was was at a halt it had become crippled because of this one man you know it's incredible how the one little thing can can stand out in our life like that and can our walk and and the whole armies of Israel standing there and and wondering what are we going to do when God had commissioned them when he said I'm with you I am the Lord your God Hallelujah and David sent unto the soul thy servant kept his father's Sheep amen he had an experience oh my God gives us experiences so that we can know what who we are in his kingdom so we can know who we are to our Lord and Jesus Christ what a relationship we have with him huh God allows things to come in our life why because he knows we can handle them he does not let something come in our lives that we cannot handle amen he built us a certain way until he allows those little things to come up and he knows that we're more than able to meet those things thy servant has kept his father's sheep and there came a lion I don't know how many of you have stood in front of a lion but I mean those things are big those things are big you know that thing Roars I mean your whole body shakes I mean I see some South Africans here this morning know what I'm talking about I mean your whole body shakes every bone comes disjointed you don't know what to think or say it I mean you just can't move you know like the prophet said when that lion speaks the whole jungle goes quiet I've experienced that amen you think of this little Shepherd boy I think it's amazing that we're talking about lions from South Africa today and and bears from Canada and sheep from New Zealand praise the Lord [Applause] that one was free but there was a Shepherd boy huh a Shepherd you know and I think of our our great Shepherd this morning you know a little sheep had maybe gone astray and this Shepherd went after that sheep oh my brother and sister that's our Lord and savior this morning but what is he showing us here look at this here he's showing an experience that David had because David was going to be a king one day but he needed to understand who was walking with him and look at how he how he has this experience and he says and there came a lion you know a lion would have been a bad situation do you show up there and you know he didn't have a gun and he didn't have you know grenades and all kinds of things to defend himself with a bear spray and you know he had a little sling a little slingshot that does not it's not very comforting you know you're out there in the woods and and walking around with a little slingshot let's just be honest this morning let's put ourselves right in the scene he did not have much but it didn't matter what he had it it mattered who was with him it mattered who called him it mattered that he had an anointing that was upon his life you see it didn't matter that there was a bear it could have been Ten Bears it could have been ten Lions it didn't matter my brother's sister he had an anointing upon his life thank you Hallelujah and you as the bride of Christ you live with an anointing upon your life an eagle anointing thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion and a bear you know a line would have been bad enough but how do you put a line in a bear together huh a lion and a bear come on somebody listening this morning a lion and a bear man I would say you're in a bad kettle of fish I mean this is bad a lion and a bear hmm how many has been in a situation like that you know it's bad enough that this happens and then this happens also you know both of these things have cloth and they just seem to have a way to sink their claws into your your life to take control I mean it's just oh my and I went out after him what made David think he could do that see his he wasn't worried about the threat he was looking at the Sheep in other words he was looking at the position he was in see the position is important when the bride recognizes her position amen the Rapture will take place so you see David what does David do he he recognizes his position I'm called to be king one day amen and I here I am I'm in the position of a shepherd in my father's house and there's a sheep gone missing I mean I'm in the line of duty amen he wasn't looking at the threats he wasn't looking at his slingshot he was looking at the position that he was in he had confidence in who he was amen and so he just says and I went after him amen so this morning if there's a bear in your life or there's a lion in your life there's there's something that seems to be suffocating your life my brother sister go after him amen go after him you may have a little slingshot you might have a Jawbone but I'm saying this morning you have a right to go after him it's bear season amen he went after and smote him delivered him out of his mouth when he arose against my caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine I want you to notice he first deals with a a lion and then a bear together and then this man rises on the scene it's very important because you'll see the parallels in the message this man rises on the scene great man big man great threat big boast defying the armies of the Living God this is the kind of man that he is and this man rises on the scene who is this uncircumcised philistine foreign he says this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them David said more over the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the line in other words look at how he says this here out of the Paw of the line which is out of the grip of that threat out of the control or out of the power out of you know because that's what a hand means right it means to control or the Deeds of so you see how that even David here saying that God that has delivered me out of the pile of this line out of the Paul the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this man this Philistine and Saul said go and the Lord be with thee so we see how that the The Lion and the Barrack is the type of the enemy in these scriptures a type of a threat that can come against a Believer and we see how that the lion can also be a good thing because we know that that there will be a line from the tribe of Judah amen but here we see that Satan always copies God he's trying to copy him you know he doesn't come up with anything original but here we want to just see here what what this is all about this this lion that we face in our lives in First Peter five and eight it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour our enemy is as a roaring lion a man just seems to shake us sometimes to our very core right our enemy is as a roaring lion the lion and the Bear in scripture so it's typed as animals or beasts that can destroy men we know that they are used many times as the types and powers that the prophet talks about and they're used by Satan we see here even in in Daniel 7 and and Revelation 13 we find the image unto the Beast see we're talking about spiritual things here this morning that image that is erected unto the the image unto the Beast having those same characteristics of those animals in it and this is very interesting now because we start to see the traits and characteristics and we see how that God used a little Shepherd Boy show us how he was going to defeat those things amen and how that there was going to be a King David rule one day amen and so we see how that even we are coming into the same motions the same process how that that same line and bear will be destroyed coming into a King David ring you believe that is that not the Millennium Reign is the King David reign is it kind of interesting how that the lion you know will be a passive animal in the Millennium reign but we see here this this Lion and the bear being used as types or traits or characteristics parallel so that we can identify the nature of that Beast system Revelations 13 and 2 says this and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him power and his seat and great Authority but notice how that that all sums up into one man at the end time the end the Antichrist huh the Beast made up of all the powers coming up into one form this Beast would be accomplished of all those powers and Daniel they represented the Gentile kingdoms we saw them in the medes and Persians and Greece Babylon all coming into one image and remember how that that stone came out of the mountain amen made with without made without hands and it's smoked the feet it smote the the image in the feet amen right in the foundation it came crumbling down but I don't want to focus so much on on the Beast system and all those things I want to focus on our own lives but it's the same characteristics same traits all the way through you'll find many times in the Bible The Lion and the bear are used together they come together to attack like I said it'd be one thing if a lion came it'd be another thing if a bear came but oh my goodness both of them together what a scene what a time but God's got Shepherds on the scene God's got David's Amen on the scene as if I won here here look at this here all uses different types of dangers also for the believer in in Lamentations we find this three and ten it says it like this here he was unto me as a bear lying in weight and as a lion in secret places again both of them together you know the more you start looking into this in the scriptures the bigger this picture becomes it's very interesting the the use of the bear and the line throughout the scriptures and he said unto me a bear lying in other words he sets a trap he sets snares a lion setting snares and traps it's like a person but he's got a certain nature and when he comes out of his hiding place he he Roars and he tries to scare you and tries to overwhelm you right so showing here that the bear and the lion sets traps and and is hiding is very deceptive you know I was walking through the the bush felt and and and and Brian Jones was talking and saying how that you know there's a lion on the left here and and then as you're walking along you'll see another line on the right hand side and and you know you hear the stories of how they they set traps you know up ahead they're they're waiting for you but they're just boxing you in like this you know it's a great feeling amen you know we walk like that in our spiritual walk also there's a trap being set you know and here we go on to Proverbs 28 and 15. as a roaring lion and a ranging bear not a raging bear arranging that's interesting what does that mean to be arranging bear so is the wicked ruler over the poor people that ranging bear is a hungry bear that has gone outside of its normal territory to hunt food isn't that exactly what Russia is doing right amen they're out of their normal territory we gotta watch Russia he's on the move and that Wicked ruler and amen look at all these beautiful types and parallels but that is the devil my brother and sister in our lives he goes outside of his normal places to rule we sing that in Canada right now how the grizzly bears are moving down from the north and coming down into places that haven't been before because it's being overrun by grizzly bear but see it's a ranging bear and it brings fear upon the people it changes the the ecosystems and and there's not as many moose as there used to be because of this right so it changes things you know he's on the move talks about a nickel Aid and some type spirit that is controlling and suppressive because who can withstand a grizzly bear who can withstand the lion Amos 5 and 18 says woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord to what end is it for you the day of the Lord is Darkness not light as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him this is very interesting analogy being used here it's actually a type of the first and the second death being able to escape the first one but yet the second one catching up to you you know this is very important because this is the type of analogies that are used to show us the fierceness of these things we battle lions and bears but it's hunting season amen praise the Lord see there's a great fear that comes along with these things but you're holding the rifle amen you're holding the Bear Tag this morning so like David as Christians we have to face them and as we Face the Lions and the Bears then one day we Face the great Giant but we were made for these things I want to encourage you young men sharpen your source amen it's not a time to to get lazy it's not a time to give up it's a time to sharpen the source check the ammunition amen check the caliber check your tickets amen we were made for this season let us be more like David amen be bold and brave in the presence of the Lord see God trains us and he prepares us for these kinds of things in our lives and he places Us in the right locations you know even as brother Ben has been placed here as a pastor as a Shepherd over the Sheep here God knew exactly what this area would have made of but already there in taranaki God knows exactly where to place his men amen and you as as Housewives and and brothers that are doing electrical or Plumbing or whatever it may be God has placed you there for a reason Amen to combat The Works of the enemy David was anointed and positionally placed in the Kingdom long before he actually ruled over Israel and see we also likewise are positionally placed in Christ Jesus by the adoption and the filling of the Holy Spirit but see that is just your placing your place for a reason see now you must undergo training and proving you're going to find out what kind of material you're made of amen so when you see that bear come around the corner next time don't be afraid God's trying to show you what you're made of just have confidence in what the Lord has done for you he's the one that anointed you he's the one that called you amen oh my I'm sure David would have liked to skip over some of the training huh Lord can I just I just I get it I I know I I get it Lord I I've learned lesson I'm just gonna I just want to bypass this one you know this one's just a little overwhelming for me oh my you know we can face some things in life that just takes this skin right off you it tears the heart right out of you you know you go through loss or you go through pain amen it seems like a big bear has gotten a hold of you and it's over top of you he's digging his claws into your very very life into your lungs and suffocating you but my brother and sister all you have to do is speak the name of Jesus oh my because God is giving you strength over that bear strength over that lion let's not bypass our training but rather let us recognize greater is he that is in US amen you are more than capable his grace is sufficient oh my you see God had something in his mind God was Raising and teaching a man to become something that he could use in his hands God called him to be a king God called him to rule it was also God who fought his battles for him and and brought him to the very promise that was declared unto him praise the Lord there are a number of stages that stick out in David's training a man he had to defeat The Lion and the bear together then he had to defeat Goliath the Giant and then he had to cast out Devils through worship very interesting stages in David's life all before becoming the king you know we're going to rule and Reign One Day but see we have to go through training the only thing we're going to take with us is our character so that we can be fit to rule amen so see everything we're going through here is training it's training and that God knows how to bring us through it amen then he faced rejection not just from his own people from his very own son so you know it's all training God's showing us what he went through amen but by the same spirit that went through those things we will also overcome see so most people would avoid a bear or a lion you know if he were hunting and you knew there was grizzly bears we were hunting a few years ago and and the ranger told us this area is totally out of bounds because there's grizzly bears it's overrun with grizzly bears well I mean you're not voluntarily going to go walking in there after a warning like that it's just you know if you know that there's a grizzly bear in an area or a lion in a certain area you don't go looking for it I mean is it just me or you know if you did that he would be seen as crazy but see God he asks us sometimes to go back into the storm see God isn't afraid just like when the devil came to him and said have you considered job you know we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death but God is with us his rod and his staff his word amen is changing me it it's holding us it's keeping us so we would like to avoid some of these things the hardest things to overcome in life are those things that are stronger than us that have control over us and when they control us they dictate how we walk suddenly you walk very quietly because there's a bear right you crouched down and you get your gun out and right Bear Country see the those situations they dictate how you walk they control how you talk or how you act you become skittish around the Believers huh those things are like the Paw of The Lion and the Bear in our lives see there are many things that can control us we can inherit things from our families good and bad trades traits and also illnesses or they can control Our Lives they have a grip on us because of our bloodline but remember my brother and sister it's not an excuse this morning because we are a new creature in Christ Jesus see we are connected to a different bloodline so I just want to say this morning you see we we it's bear season we can get rid of all those things we can annihilate all those things in our lives this morning because God has given us a new and a living way A Better Way amen we come in contact with things that end up controlling our lives and you can talk about habits and all kinds of things but we have a right to resist those things this morning as we said last night these things are like the bear and the lion in a believer's life once they have a grip on you once they are they have you in their graphs it's very hard to get away and then finally the Giant the giant is a man you might be thinking of all kinds of things out there but just take a good look at your yourself this morning the giant is the man your greatest enemy The Prophet said is this guy right here not this guy maybe but for each and every one of you you yourself right are your worst enemy the man so another lion rose up on the scene my brother and sister even though these things were were there and we say how that God used David to show us the types of what God was going to do and not another line Rises on the scene his name is Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ paid for your freedom and from those things and defeated that lion he made that lion quiet amen took the teeth out of him amen and then the lion of the tribe of Judah who takes the book and opens the seals in our day exposing the enemy and giving you power to overcome amen David says that the Lord delivered me out of the Paw the grip of the lion out of the Paw the grip of the bear the Lord did that amen the Lord does that the Lord is the one who delivers the Lord is the one who won won the victory over the enemy see all David had to do was stay in the line of the father's business amen all he had to do was exercise faith in what God has done for him Lord you called me Lord you anointed me Lord you defeat the enemy [Applause] what did David have he didn't have bear spray no he had simple faith in the god of Israel and I thought that was amazing that sister singing that song in Hebrew Hebrew this morning had simple faith in the god of Israel that say that he was saved by grace and the Lord God was the power that would overcome the threats in his life remember we want to fight the Giants in our lives also but first we must Conquer The Lion and the Bear we cannot defeat the giant in our own life until we have destroyed the lion and the bear those things that control us or dictate our walk we cannot defeat The Lion and the Bear if we worship them right those things that control Our Lives we want to fight the Giants in our lives but we must conquer that lion and Bear now let's just turn a little bit here brother Branham was an avid Hunter I'm so glad that God sent us a messenger in our day that was a good Hunter he knew how to hunt bear I'm so thankful for that amen because it's bear season watch Russia amen so here we have we have brother Branham comes on the scene and he's a hunter and so he understands these things so we're going to just draw a few lessons from him this morning from a couple of his stories see we are called to be Overcomers we have been called to hunt bears and lions and defeat them and sometimes we do not destroy them because we become distracted and we put others in danger so remember here's just a few stories just here from The Prophet's life and I I like to glean from those things because I believe the Lord allowed him to go through things in his life amen so that we can draw from his life just like how the Old Testament Saints God allowed them to go through things like David and he said that they were for our example amen but remember what happened in brother branham's life he was the first fruits of the ministry that would follow amen he's showing us what's in the scene he's showing us what's going to come up in the Harvest amen so God's showing through a prophet you know that he wasn't afraid of the bear he wasn't afraid of lions and all those things he was an avid Hunter amen praise the Lord that's what's in the seed amen that's what's coming up in the Harvest this morning praise the Lord so let's look at this little story remember when he went hunting on his honeymoon I see we have a couple here that's been engaged God bless you brother amen this is not good advice maybe for you too but you know he goes hunting on his honeymoon so he was going to meet Amanda that was going to go hunt bear with that is why he went up there he was hunting bear in the message curtain of time he says this he was building a little fire and so and he says and so I told her I'd be back at noon and I went across the hill to do some tracking come back along the Ridge and I've seen a bobcat Crossing and I couldn't get close enough to it to shoot it so I went up over the hill and I trained up along a trail dump along the side went into a great big bear Den it's interesting how the God allows him to go through very similar things that David went through there's so many parallels and there wasn't nothing in there I came back and went down towards the Giants there's your three things right away and this just caught my attention it's just you know just bear with me it's not the Lord's speaks to me I see the parallels and then and then I see the the story behind it and and see the encouragement that God's trying to bring but right away we see a bobcat we see a bear and we see Giants in his story so God's trying to say hey there's something about this journey there's something about his experience here that will relate you'll find this all the way through the scriptures amen he says what they call the Giants it's a great massive forest in there for miles after miles all flat Woods like in there and tar in the message the mighty conqueror he relates to this again he says I was waiting for the ranger to come up remember he is waiting for this guy he says and said I believe I'll go out and get some venison I said you wait if the ranger comes up we're going to hunt bear on up on the Hurricane Mountain she was supposed to wait for this Ranger the ranger knew the territory the ranger knows the the ins and outs of the terrain and brother Branham was supposed to wait for this Ranger we'll wait for this Ranger because we're going to go hunt bear it's bear season we're hunting bear but we gotta wait for this Ranger he says I heard oh sorry and I went up over a few Hills and down and I noticed a big bobcat and I was trailing him because he was catching Grouse I thought if I could get a shot at him I could get him but I couldn't catch him then I thought I scented a bear so he's talking about the same story every time but every time he tells the story he gives a little bit more insight so he smells this bear another place he sees the bear den and it's not where it's supposed to be it's ranging okay so it's out and about and in the year this story we find he's sensed the bear he knows it's around amen it's lurking well I don't know if you've ever smelled bear before oh my it changes the whole scene and there he tried to get a shot at that Bobcat but couldn't get close enough to it he says I hit a little ditch and went down this way and towards the Giants it's cold every time he brings his three things into the story and then message the seven compound names of Jehovah he says this well I thought I was too good of a Woodsman to ever get lost I'd been in the woods all my life I heard something moving in the bushes I listened close and I heard it had four feet moving but it wasn't a hoof it was a padded foot I thought wonder what that could be it was pretty dark right in a bunch of Evergreens and I happened to look at a lion cross the path like that and he was too quick I didn't get a shot at him I thought well I'll just slip up on up this way and come down the other side and I'll be in below Hurricane Mountain it was such a perfect name the mountain of storms huh all the time he says and I said then I can always look back to the tower because look like it might come a storm pretty soon oh it's such a perfect scene huh there he is he's without the Ranger he left the ranger the guy that knows the terrain because he thought he was a good Woodsman you know he thought he he could he could navigate his way through this but as he gets into this Hurricane Mountain as he as he sees the storm coming in he at least had the had the sense to find the the view of the tower again you know he's looking for that place of safety right because here the lion has crossed his path but that line was too quick you know brother Brandon was a good shot but that line I mean he could shoot squirrels right this line was too quick comes across this path like that and then he smells bare and you know and and he knows the storm's coming man it's Brewing out there now the devil's he's moving in you know he's but there's there's one man there and there you've got your bear you've got your line you've got the storms praise the Lord my brother and sister amen it's good to be a Son of God I just want to tell you don't fear the storms when you fear the when do you feel the storms and you get that bare scent and you see the Line run across the the path just gets still because God wants to show you something oh it's a good place to be when God can ever meet you in those storms and you can stand there and say I know a living God that protected me there the god that watched over me here the god that healed me at this place oh my my brother sister he knows how to lead his believers oh my God sorry I just this is personal to me this morning so I went on and on and on this way I thought I kept whiffing a bear somewhere and I kept smelling for him I thought he's near here somewhere he's probably staying ahead of me so I kept walking on like that watching the ground walking what was the problem in his story he didn't wait for the one that would help him hunt the bear see sometimes we can run ahead in life thinking we're going to carve our own way I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this my brother's sister I'm gonna encourage you ask the Lord ask the Lord what he wants you to do Lord what do you want me to do for school Lord what kind of a career do you want me to have Lord because there's going to be bearish that's going to come off there's going to be they're lions and there's going to be Giants in my life oh God I I just want to know I'm walking with you I don't want to go into this Hurricane Mountain I don't want to go into this Hillside this dark place where the Giants are Lord without knowing that you're walking I want the ranger right next to me because he'll be able to spot that bear yeah he'll know the terrain don't walk alone take the Ranger with you [Music] see also knew it was risky going down there down where he found himself in the territory of The Lion and the bear he needed a guide to get himself out Hallelujah he thought he had all the knowledge he thought he had all he thought he was a great Woodsman my brother and sister he thought all those things but he needed help in the time of trouble and he became separated from his family oh there's so many things we could draw from the story he becomes separated from his family thank God he never leaves us nor forsakes us amen because we think we can handle those trials and tests on our own but we must be sure to wait on the Lord be sure to wait on the Ranger the Holy Ghost will give us power to destroy the enemy in our lives guide us through our storms let's look at another story here we must remember that God sends Messengers and angels and sometimes he comes himself to destroy the bear we sometimes travel through Bear Country without the protection we need we venture off into bare territory without the hunter by her side sometimes we don't recognize that he is right here in our midst in this story he is in Colorado I believe it is and he's on an elk Trail hunting elk and when he came across this infidelity you'll find the story kind of progresses along with this man here this man asks him what he's doing and brother Branham says I'm on an elk Trail I'm hunting elk and the man said you're wrong those are cow prints brother Branham said I've been a hunter long long enough to know that those are elk tracks and so the man examined it closer and he noticed that they were in fact elk tracks now just see how the story evolves here so he comes brother Brandon's hunting elk he's hunting for for meat and here he comes across this man he's an Infidel and and right away this man starts to question the prophet okay and so the prophet says I'm hunting out I'm following this Trail those are elk uh uh Trail that's an out Trail and and this man says this Infidel says no that's not help that's that's cow arguing with a prophet you know what you're seeing that's not what you're seeing right and that's just how it goes sometimes but you know the prophet says no I've been a hunter long enough I know this Trail I've seen this before right he's following this Trail brother Brandon was skilled he knew what to look for he had experience in his field see the Man became curious about who he was then and starts to ask him questions brother Brandon says I'm a game warden from Indiana and the man told him that he was not even welcome in this country this is interesting the one that is sent to hunt the bear is not welcome in his own country let me I'll give you the quote he said you're not even welcome in the country real rough hard-boiled I said well I'm here anyhow I said Bob Steele sent me back in here which is the interstate Game Commission I'm back here to hunt a grizzly bear he said there's no Grizzlies back there oh that's good huh no I'm okay there's no trouble I can go down this certain direction there's no Grizzlies down there oh my but I've been commissioned by God now the prophet in laodicea came and laodicea said we have need of nothing we have everything we have need of there's no grizzly bear back here remember grizzly bear is the one with the ill temper oh don't get him riled up don't rub him the wrong way right what a scary thing can you imagine walking into a dark room I don't mean to scare any kids here this morning or older once but you know walking into a dark room and not realizing you've walked into a room or a cave where there's a grizzly bear and he's hungry oh my I'm so thankful that someone could turn on the lights huh hey there's the grizzly bear in the country I've been commissioned by another commission another country from another place to come here and hunt a grizzly bear that's in your territory I love these stories amen so I'm back here to hunt grizzly bear he said there's no Grizzlies back here he said there was I'll take his word for it The Man became uncomfortable because he was in violation of the law see so this Infidel was in violation of the law oh it's so good so here this man comes from another country across the state line so to speak moves into this country uh just using the words of prophet used right and so he moves across the state line and there's a man there who's breaking the law he was living in sin there's grizzly bear in his country oh but there's a prophet on the scene that he's there to hunt the grizzly bear you know the prophet is there as a courtesy huh and this man now he's getting uncomfortable because this is a game warden oh man I'm in trouble you know because I've breaking the law here on this side but brother Branham reassures him by telling him I'm not here I'm not from here I'm from another country your laws are different than my laws from where I am from oh that's good oh that's good okay I'm We're not gonna have time to get into all that but think about that for a second he's under another Covenant yeah okay [Applause] he says here you have you would be a criminal he says but where I'm from there is a pardon for you oh he's hunting bear it's bear season amen he says I said I have got nothing to do with your laws here I'm just back here as I courtesy I'm hunting this bear that man didn't even know the trouble that was coming but God sent a prophet who could see huh and he said well I don't believe that bear is back there see that's the trouble with many Believers today we live in a bear in Bear Country and don't realize it you see that's the real danger out there in this world all around us and yet we think that danger does not exist thank God for sending a game warden amen a bear hunter see but he's here as a courtesy he's here as a courtesy God is a gentleman but he's he's ready he's guns loaded he's on the trail my brother and sister all you have to do this morning you say Lord I surrendered to you I accept your pardon and Lord whatever threats are coming up in my life I'm gonna need you I don't want to leave the ranger behind amen Lord will you walk in this country with me okay Allelujah see that man started to see that this man could read signs he could read the signs of the trail he could pick up the scent he knew what was going on you know and it's amazing how brother Branham eventually leads this man to the Lord the man started to recognize not only what brother Brandon was saying but he started to see God all around him in everything brother Brandon was sent to hunt bear in the natural and in the spiritual Amen in the spiritual he destroyed the Bear in that man's life also his bear was a doubting spirit foreign just like brother Brandon was sent to rescue that man so David was sent to rescue sheep from The Lion and the Bear delivered him out of the Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of the bear the two having a grip over the believer's life amen I'm just going to be a few more minutes David wasn't afraid of the bear in The Line so don't fear the bear David wasn't bluffing he meant it when he said he went after that sheep he wasn't hoping it was going to work out he trusted in the power of God see you can't Bluff the devil he knows when you are sincere or not he knows just like the bear knows when you are bluffing brother Brown says I'm a Hunter and I know animal life they say brother Branham aren't you afraid to walk up to them bear and and things with just a knife in your hand certainly not I know that if you're afraid of that animal he knows it you you can't Bluff him he knows it but if you're not afraid he knows it too see and if an animal by Instinct knows knows that what about a man what does a man so you cannot fear the enemy don't fear [Music] they questioned whether brother Branham had a big enough gun kind of like David I think it's so perfect all the parallels David had a slingshot well brother Branham only had a 270. it's a small little gun you know in Canada if you ask any of the hunters there they'll tell you no he needed 300 Winchester magnum right big gun right because you're going to need all the stopping power you can get brother Brandon went hunting with a 270. it's a small little gun but see like David they questioned him whether a slingshot would work brother Branham and David both had something bigger than the weapon they held in their hands see they are they had the word of God backing them up they had Visions they had anointing amen what do you have it's not too small [Music] and the message have become with us to fulfill all righteousness prophets says this now that's the famous bear there's four in the grizzly family one is the silver silver tip which is the famous one next is called the native name kadish I think that's interesting like kadish barnea which is a black with a round ear the second he says third is the regular Grizzly which is between black and brown a huge bear and the next is the Kodiak which is only found on Kodiak Island in Western Alaska he's a great Mammoth biggest of all the bears but he's a grizzly excuse me but the Silver Tip is black and and the white the silver is on the end of the tip of the hair he is the famous one very high strung ill-tempered bear he says and I shot the bear with a heart shot and killed him I just I just want you to maybe put that on your fridge just put that little line on your fridge [Applause] he says I was questioned the little rifle I had about getting it and I told the Brethren how many here has heard me tell about that before it happened yeah he was walking in the vision praise the Lord my grandson we are also walking in the vision every enemy who's under our feet oh my so many beautiful things brother Branham comes back to British Columbia to hunt bear the message Israel and and the church he says it like this because remember he saw the effects of what a bear does in the country it brings fear it brings doubt and so he'll be invited to go places to go hunt bear to to deal with a certain threat or so forth spiritually and naturally speaking and here we see in this message he says oh when I begin to see them see the way they were doing it reminds me here not long ago I was on a little vacation after I come back from Africa I was up here in the Northwoods way up here in the Alaskan border a thousand miles from hardtop Road went back six days perfect number here again right after six Church ages or six is the number of men again he says went back Six Days on Horseback getting Plum away from everything and as I went back through there I was riding along On My Horse one day and it just got scared his horse in other words the power he was riding right it got nervous it got scared a grizzly bear just raised up and he got scared this isn't I was going down through he started running and we got down through there and there had been an old burn over and there was great big bunch of old tall trees that stood there and they were white there in the Moonlight evening time white there in the Moonlight oh just as stately and strong as they could look look could be all the life was gone out of them and I listened at the winds howling and the winds come down through there just moaning you know all them old trees all would do is just squeak and squawk and squeak and squawk what is he in he's in Bear Country what a scene again huh over in Joel he says what the Palmer worm left the cattle pillar eaten what the caterpillar had left the earthworm eaten them churches he says oh no doubt just like them trees they once were great living statues the methodists the Baptists the Presbyterian the Pentecostals he says but I tell you the fires and scorches of this world has scorched all the bark off of them they were standing like a big bunch of tombstones now just erected up there no life in them at all amen that's right and when the rushing Mighty Wind comes from Heaven down the only thing they do is just squeak and squawk and moan and talk against it Hallelujah but what we need is somebody to accept it foreign country he says and I noticed oh praise the Lord for this and I noticed down over there them young trees that was coming up we see some young trees this morning [Applause] Hallelujah they were flexible they just give With the Wind frolicking back and forth like this having a good old time amen I I was thinking that when I was sitting in the study this morning hearing you praise and worship amen just having a good time in his presence I said that puts me in the mind of a good old-fashioned God sent Holy Ghost Revival Hallelujah thank you he says when signs and wonders begin to come into the church the big old churches moan I don't believe in them things that's fanaticism the days of Miracles has passed and the wind whistling through the through down there he says in the same ones that made them moan give the others Frolic he says oh Hallelujah when you shook that tree he says every time he gets a shaking it loosens up the roots so that it can grow down and get a better hold Hallelujah that's what we need tonight he says it's good old time Holy Ghost shaking that goes down inside of you he says he loosens up all the dirt around the roots Hallelujah so he can dig down and get a better hold oh my so we can grow down and get a better hold on life it says better rooted and grounded in Christ Jesus he says them experiences the experiences of healing experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost experiences of the gifts of the Spirit Hallelujah he says it's just anchoring you in Christ and the harder that wind blows the better it is for you [Music] he goes on he says Let the church squeak and moan if she wants to let her say the days of Miracles has passed if they want to it's dead anyhow and they said we're a church so was them trees but look at them no bark on them just blistered all the bark done burnt off they couldn't pack the life up anymore that's all the bark they've done went out there and made their rituals and so forth so that they can't even have any bark on them anymore which is the word which is your protection nothing but just a squeak and squawk when the winds are blowing but God sent the wind just the sand so this little bitty church is coming up this little handful oh my my brother and sister but I want you to notice the scene that this is all happening in it's in a dark forest with trees in the Moonlight showing the evidence of the wars and things that have gone on has ripped off its bark and there's no life in them trees and he's hunting bear in that country but my brother and sister there's young trees growing up it's got some life in it we may just be a handful my brother and sister he says they were just having a big time with it while the rest of them was carrying on about it he says oh my we need God's power back in the church [Applause] amen praise the Lord you know they um they'll tell you when you're hunting bear and bear attacks you or you know or maybe let's say you're you're just being attacked by a bear they they give you advice for that they tell you to play dead play dead you know there's some truth to that because we are dead in Christ you know but my brother and sister let's just look at what the prophet said here about destroying the Bear in our lives and I'm closing with a few of these quotes here amen he says for instance I've often said if there's a big animal here on the platform a big bear or a lion and he had his claw in my side and was tearing my side out it would wouldn't be necessary for me to try to find some kind of a knife that would cut his claw off if I just knock the thing in the head it would kill the claw and all and it would take care of the whole thing as long as I killed the animal killed its head you see that's exactly what David showed us he went up to Goliath he took the sword and he chopped his head off amen [Applause] he says while the head of every one of every one of the attributes of Sin is Sin and when Jesus come dealing with sin at Calvary he killed sin he killed every attribute that goes with it amen completely redeemed us back to God and today we are Sons and Daughters of God perfectly Redeemed by A Perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh that makes me glad to think about that see but David knew that it's not going to matter my brother and sister and this morning we know that this morning and let's not waste our time trying to pull out this little claw and trying to pull this little thing out let's get him right at the head foreign by the way he killed Goliath sever the head that's the same way we will overcome he has put every enemy under our feet I've got three more quotes the musicians can come praise the Lord he says but we still have a God who can live deliver the sheep from the lion can deliver the sheep from the bear but I know one thing there was a bear a cancer a tumor a blindness and even death grabbed some of God's shape one day and I went forced with the power of God and I slew him and brought that sheep back that's right and we go forth today we go forth today not with any great something so and so I go forth with a plain little slingshot of prayer oh Hallelujah it'll bring her back every time do you believe that don't you sister you believe it too don't you sister [Applause] he says the god of Heaven has let me deliver a lamb out of the mouth of the Lion out of the mouth of a bear he knew it wasn't a slingshot it was the power of God that went with him the anointing that he had on his life you see he was the one that brought that lamb back [Music] and that's the way we say today God's God David sticking around oh yes sir we have some Davids this morning that's feeding father sheep and once in a while the tumor will come or a cancer will come or something and jump Plum out of the hands of the doctor he says that won't stop that David he'll go right on out there after that little fellow with a little slingshot off ask anything in my name and it shall be given I don't care the doctors can laugh and everybody else can make fun of him he'll go after him anyhow bring that sheep back to the fold yes sir it's God's child take your hands off of him knock this lion down then the lion rose up and he grabbed him by the beard and he killed him a little bitty ready boy probably weigh just 80 or 90 pounds oh my brother and sister we're under an anointing this morning we had a sister in our
