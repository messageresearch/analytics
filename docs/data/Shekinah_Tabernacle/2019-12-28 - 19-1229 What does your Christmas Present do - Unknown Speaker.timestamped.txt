[28:34] Matthew chapter 2 you're gonna read read
[28:38] a portion of Matthew to them also going
[28:40] to go to revelations chapter 1 I'm in
[28:47] Matthew 2 and verse 1 now when Jesus was
[28:55] born and in Bethlehem of Judea in the
[28:58] days of Herod the King behold there came
[29:01] wise men from the east to Jerusalem
[29:03] saying where is he that is born King of
[29:05] the Jews if we have seen his star in the
[29:08] east and we have come to worship Him
[29:10] when Herod the King Herod heard these
[29:12] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[29:14] with him and when he had gathered all
[29:16] the chief priests and scribes to the
[29:18] people together he demanded of them
[29:20] where Christ should be born and they
[29:22] said unto him in bethlehem of judea for
[29:24] thus it is written by the prophet
[29:26] now Bethlehem in the land of juda not
[29:29] the least among the princes of Judah for
[29:31] out of thee shall come a governor that
[29:33] shall rule my people Israel they inherit
[29:36] when he privily called the wise men and
[29:39] quiet of them diligently what time the
[29:41] star appeared and he sent them to
[29:43] Bethlehem said go and search diligently
[29:45] for the young child and when you have
[29:47] found him bring me word again that I may
[29:49] come and worship Him also when they had
[29:52] heard the King they departed lo the star
[29:55] which they saw in the East went before
[29:57] them till they came and stood over where
[29:59] the young child to say till it came and
[30:02] stood over where the young child was
[30:04] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[30:06] with exceeding great joy when they came
[30:09] into the house they saw the young child
[30:10] with Mary his mother and fell down and
[30:13] worshiped him and when they had opened
[30:15] their treasures they presented unto Him
[30:17] gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh
[30:19] and being warned of God and a dream they
[30:22] should not return to Herod they departed
[30:24] into their own country another way I
[30:27] mean let's go to revelations chapter 1
[30:30] and we're gonna read verses four five
[30:32] and six of Revelations one
[30:43] see see John to the seven churches which
[30:47] are in Asia grace be unto you and peace
[30:49] from hemorrhages which was and which is
[30:52] to come and from the seven spirits which
[30:56] are before his throne and from Jesus
[30:58] Christ was a faithful witness and the
[31:00] first begotten of the Dead and the
[31:01] Prince of the kings of the earth and to
[31:03] him that loved us and washed us from our
[31:06] sins in his own blood and has made us
[31:09] notice present tense and has made us
[31:11] kings and priests unto God and his
[31:13] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[31:16] ever and ever amen
[31:18] I mean this just bow our heads in a word
[31:20] of Prayer Oh Lord Jesus father we just
[31:23] want to come into your presence Lord and
[31:25] we want to Lord as as look we didn't
[31:28] read it here in John chapter one but it
[31:30] sees that John was in the spirit on the
[31:32] Lord's Day dear God he was in the spirit
[31:33] dear Lord then you showed him things
[31:36] which were to come dear God so long as
[31:38] you Lord and as your prophet said Lord
[31:40] if we want to do anything for you we've
[31:42] got to get into the spirit first dear
[31:43] God Father not in our own carnal ability
[31:46] but law that we get into your spirit
[31:47] dear God so I asked father may we be
[31:50] under the spirit Lord of your great holy
[31:52] presence dear God may we be in the

[32:08] pray you'll once more step to the pulpit
[32:11] Lord open your word to our hearts dear
[32:13] God or may we walk out of here renewed
[32:15] and strengthened and established Lord
[32:18] and settled and rejoicing and at peace

[32:22] your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[32:24] bless bless the service now Lord we

[32:34] you that we love you we thank you Lord
[32:36] that we can rejoice in the god of our
[32:38] salvation Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[32:41] Amen amen god bless you friends you may
[32:43] have your seats
[32:44] I'm sorry I have I have two titles this
[32:46] morning and as I was kind of joking with
[32:48] brother Armand and brother Andy before
[32:49] it depends how spiritual you are which
[32:52] one you want to take so the first one is
[32:54] do you know what your Christmas present
[32:56] do you know what your Christmas present
[32:58] does and and and if that doesn't sound
[33:02] I'm spiritual enough for you being
[33:04] perfectly loosed by the perfect blood
[33:06] but you know do you know what your
[33:08] Christmas present does you know cuz if
[33:09] you get a Christmas present and you
[33:11] don't know what it does you'll never get
[33:13] the magnitude of what it is you know
[33:14] even if you get something simple like
[33:16] some socks if you don't know what sucks
[33:18] - they're not going to help you I mean
[33:20] or you get something very fancy that's
[33:21] got all the bells and the whistles and
[33:23] the Wi-Fi and the yo if you don't know
[33:25] what it does you're just gonna you're
[33:28] not going to get the point of why it's
[33:29] being sent to you so you've really got
[33:31] to know what your Christmas present does
[33:33] to get the full benefit from it amen and
[33:36] and if you don't know what it really
[33:38] does you won't treasure it you know just
[33:40] imagine if you got some big fancy drone
[33:42] and you didn't even know how to turn
[33:43] this thing on so that's cool but you
[33:46] wouldn't know what it can do so you need
[33:48] to know what it can do so do you know
[33:49] what your Christmas reason does I mean I
[33:52] trust you know that we we know that the
[33:54] true Christmas person that God gave us
[33:56] is eternal life hallelujah so you know
[33:59] we water we we really want to know what
[34:01] it does because you know having eternal
[34:03] life is more than just an abstract idea
[34:05] it's a reality and so brother Brown
[34:08] would say and we have seen in a star in
[34:10] the Eastern have come to worship Him
[34:11] he says vindicated in your own flesh
[34:14] that you are the person that's born of
[34:16] the Holy Spirit wouldn't you love to
[34:18] have that when you love to have that
[34:21] assurance I mean that's been vindicates
[34:23] been proven in your own flesh that
[34:25] you're born of the Holy Ghost wouldn't
[34:27] that be the greatest Christmas present
[34:29] that anybody could get the gift of
[34:32] eternal life God so loved the world that
[34:34] He gave His only begotten Son that
[34:36] whosoever believeth in him should not
[34:38] perish but have everlasting life I mean
[34:43] you see here and if he really Fe really
[34:45] grafts grass that the Messiah was
[34:48] potentially upon the earth he would have
[34:49] been the first one out the gate of
[34:50] Jerusalem to go to Bethlehem but he's
[34:52] like I'll just go find him tell me if
[34:55] he's there and then I'll go worship Him
[34:56] but you know he didn't grasp what was
[34:58] the Christmas prison that was given you
[35:01] know and and we don't want to fall under
[35:02] the under the under their category now
[35:06] the greatest gift that that we can
[35:08] receive is eternal life and
[35:10] without money or price I mean but it
[35:13] never comes the way man wants it to come
[35:15] when Jesus came the first time they all
[35:18] wanted a messiah the Jews wanted to some
[35:20] great king to rise up and drive the
[35:21] Romans away and should I just go to this
[35:24] thing because it's making noise yep
[35:26] here we are again you know sorry they
[35:32] wanted some great general to to drive
[35:34] the Romans out they wanted some you know
[35:36] master you know there's a lot now you
[35:44] know they wanted some great King to rise
[35:46] up some great military man to to to rise
[35:49] and drive the Romans out of there out of
[35:51] their country that they could be a free
[35:53] people again you know or you know the
[35:56] and and everyone expected him to come a
[35:59] certain way you know the scribes and
[36:00] Pharisees they had it all sorted out in
[36:02] their mind this is how the Messiah will
[36:04] come that's how the forerunner will come
[36:05] and you know you know the had it all
[36:07] planned out but but when Jesus came he
[36:10] came in a totally different way to how
[36:12] they thought yet he came according to
[36:14] the word you know he would be born in
[36:16] Bethlehem as the word said you know so
[36:18] you know he he came exactly as was
[36:21] prophesied but the people had in their
[36:23] mind how he would come and in how he did
[36:26] come was totally different to what they
[36:28] were expecting so they missed it you
[36:32] know so they were wanting some great
[36:34] military genius or some great scholar
[36:36] but God gave them what they needed not
[36:38] what they wanted and what they needed
[36:40] was a babe in a manger that's what they
[36:42] needed they didn't need a great military
[36:44] man they needed a babe in a manger and
[36:46] God always gives us what we need not
[36:48] what we want
[36:50] hallelujah how many times we have a lot
[36:52] of once but the scripture says he'll
[36:54] supply our needs
[36:56] hallelujah I'm glad he knows what we
[36:58] need more than what what we think we
[37:00] know what we need so they didn't know
[37:03] what the Christmas present could do they
[37:06] didn't see the value of the babe in a
[37:07] manger so they didn't receive it or
[37:09] appreciate it that it was eternal life
[37:12] manifested in the flesh I mean so so
[37:15] they didn't receive it or appreciate
[37:17] that it was eternal life offered to them
[37:19] when the word became flesh such the same
[37:23] as people today
[37:24] they don't receive Christ today and
[37:26] appreciate and receive eternal life when
[37:29] the word has become flesh again I mean
[37:32] because the word became flesh and dwelt
[37:33] among us and the word has again became
[37:35] flesh and dwelt in us hallelujah in our
[37:38] own flesh now I want to maybe kind of
[37:43] start a kind of a series and this may I
[37:46] don't know where we'll go but I want to
[37:49] basically essentially take how the devil
[37:52] works from Genesis to Revelation and
[37:55] I'll show how God works from Genesis to
[37:57] Revelation now I'm not going to do this
[37:58] all today we'll be here for a while okay
[37:59] so I'm just giving you like a you know
[38:02] but because we need to know his tactics
[38:05] and we need to know how he works and
[38:08] because if we can identify how he works
[38:11] in every age we can see how he works in
[38:13] this age because we know the devil as a
[38:15] creature of habit so what he did in
[38:18] Genesis he will do today what he did in
[38:20] Moses day he'll do today what he did a
[38:22] near Meyers day he'll do today what he
[38:24] did in David's day he'll do today you
[38:26] know all the way down through and what
[38:28] he did in the book of Acts he'll do
[38:29] today he's the same devil you know
[38:31] brother Bram says that you know men may
[38:35] die but the spirit upon him doesn't die
[38:38] it just comes anoint someone else so so
[38:40] brother Bram sitting here because we got
[38:42] to see what does this Christmas gift do
[38:44] this Christmas gift eternal life has
[38:47] caused us to overcome every work of the
[38:49] devil right to recognize him at his
[38:52] tricks and withstand him and overcome
[38:54] him I mean so so so brother Brahim says
[38:58] in the church age book this is from this
[39:00] is from chapter 1 he says now I see that
[39:02] this book of Revelation is the
[39:04] revelation of Jesus and what he is doing
[39:07] in the churches for those seven ages it
[39:10] is a revelation because the disciples
[39:12] themselves didn't know these recorded
[39:15] truths it had not been previously
[39:18] revealed to them now we know that most
[39:20] of the disciples had been martyred by
[39:22] the time by the time John received the
[39:24] revelation on the Isle of Patmos right
[39:26] so they did not receive it you remember
[39:29] that they came to Jesus in the book of
[39:31] Acts they are some ie not at this time
[39:33] going to restore the kingdom of Israel
[39:36] he said us not for you to know
[39:38] the time or the seasons those men were
[39:41] still thinking of Jesus as having an
[39:43] earthly Kingdom but it was not us but it
[39:46] was a spiritual Kingdom he was going to
[39:48] build member he has made us kings and
[39:50] priests as a spiritual Kingdom even he
[39:52] could not tell them about his place in
[39:54] it for the father had not revealed it
[39:56] unto them but now after his death and
[39:58] resurrection and at this particular time
[40:00] in his me to tour ministry he was able
[40:03] to set forth here and this revelation of
[40:06] himself to John what has glory and
[40:09] presence and the church would mean and
[40:11] do and this revelation he tells us what
[40:14] the end of the devil is he tells how
[40:16] he's going to deal with the devil and
[40:18] cast them into the lake of fire he
[40:20] reveals the end of the wicked ones who
[40:22] follow Satan and Satan hates that have
[40:24] you ever noticed how Satan hates two
[40:27] books of the Bible more than all others
[40:29] through liberal theologians and
[40:31] pseudo-scientists he's always attacking
[40:33] the book of Genesis and the book of
[40:34] Revelation and both of these books we
[40:37] find Satan's origin has awful ways and
[40:39] his destruction that's why he attacks
[40:42] them he hates to be exposed and in those
[40:44] books he is exposed for exactly what he
[40:46] is jesus said about Satan he has no part
[40:49] in me and I have no part in him and you
[40:51] can say the same thing he has no part of
[40:53] me I have no part in him why because the
[40:55] perfect blood is perfectly Lewis from
[40:57] all of his all of his plans his devices
[41:00] his shackles the devil would would like
[41:03] to prove that different but he cannot so
[41:05] he does all he can to destroy notice
[41:07] what he does he does all he can to
[41:09] destroy the confidence in the word but
[41:12] when the church disbelief Satan and
[41:14] believes the spirits revelation of the
[41:17] word the gates of hell could not prevail
[41:19] against her so when you disbelieve Satan
[41:23] and believe the spirits revelation of
[41:25] the word the gates of Hell cannot
[41:27] prevail against you amen now let me know
[41:31] because we have to understand we face a
[41:32] real foe and and he is here to withstand
[41:34] us but greater is in you then he is in
[41:37] the world a means we've got to recognize
[41:39] that we're going to see what this
[41:41] Christmas gift does I mean cuz this
[41:44] Christmas gift is given eternal life and
[41:46] has conquered the devil everyplace
[41:48] anytime anywhere
[41:50] it has subdued the devil it has
[41:51] conquered him bound him up you know
[41:53] defeated him taking the keys of his own
[41:55] house off him I mean and we need to see
[41:57] this live in our life hallelujah and I
[42:00] believe he's among us I mean so I'm not
[42:02] saying if something we need to get we've
[42:03] already got it I mean but you got to
[42:05] recognize what you have I mean now let
[42:07] me because remember it's always your
[42:08] place in the word the devil will fight
[42:10] against he doesn't want you to recognize
[42:12] who you are and because if you recognize
[42:14] who you are what gaited God has made you
[42:16] to be
[42:17] you recognize that then you will
[42:18] exercise the the the office at your in I
[42:22] mean you know imagine if you know
[42:24] President Trump didn't recognize he is
[42:26] president but yet he's president he
[42:28] wouldn't do what he does because he cuz
[42:31] he doesn't believe he's president but
[42:32] the people made him president so
[42:34] therefore he exercises the office of a
[42:36] president he conducts himself well as a
[42:41] president you know he he but but
[42:43] basically he says I'll do what I want a
[42:45] president so so he knows what he's been
[42:48] made and he pushes the boundaries of it
[42:50] as much as he can but thing is if he was
[42:52] afraid to exercise the office of a
[42:54] prison and he wouldn't do the things he
[42:55] does it's the same thing with us we need
[42:57] to recognize what God has made us to be
[42:59] what does what our Christmas gift does a
[43:03] mean is caused us to recognize who we
[43:05] are in Christ hallelujah this is the
[43:07] best this is the best Christmas gift
[43:09] ever its warranty has never voided you
[43:13] don't need new batteries you don't need
[43:15] software updates firmware updates you
[43:17] don't need no kind of updates you can't
[43:18] break it you can't smash it
[43:20] you can't crash it hallelujah it never
[43:22] runs out I met at is perfect in every
[43:25] way I mean but you've got a really
[43:27] treasure what you have hallelujah notice
[43:30] I said what you have you got to know
[43:32] what you have I mean let me so there
[43:35] brother brain continues he says now let
[43:38] me put in a word here from my own
[43:40] ministry if you don't mind we all know
[43:42] that this gift in my life is
[43:44] supernatural
[43:44] it's a gift really spirit is able to
[43:47] discern with a discerning diseases and
[43:49] the thoughts of men's hearts other
[43:51] hidden things that only God could know
[43:53] and then reveal to me I was stand with
[43:56] me and see the faces of people when
[43:58] Satan knows he's going to be exposed now
[44:01] doesn't the people I'm talking about
[44:02] it's that Satan
[44:03] is gonna hold in their lives through sin
[44:06] indifference and disease we don't want
[44:09] any of those three things I mean but
[44:12] Mima but the devil will try and get in
[44:14] get a hold of our life through sin and
[44:16] difference in disease but it depends
[44:18] what you do with it stomp on box return
[44:20] to sender right that's the best policy
[44:24] that's probably a few years ago now but
[44:27] but but so when I was up in Papua New
[44:29] Guinea
[44:29] I received the courier box that I see it
[44:31] through of all these books and stuff and
[44:33] it was mangled it was still intact but
[44:35] it looked like someone had literally
[44:36] stomped on it and when I when I saw this
[44:38] box I thought that's exactly what we
[44:40] should do with Satan's stuff stop on box
[44:42] we turned this into her you know don't
[44:44] accept anything he sends you it was
[44:46] trash man I mean I mean but the boxes
[44:48] because I'd literally taped it up and up
[44:50] and around and around and the tape hold
[44:52] the box together but it was mangled but
[44:53] anyway that's why I say stop on box
[44:56] return to sender now so see it isn't the
[44:59] people so you but you should see their
[45:01] faces Satan knows he's going to be
[45:03] exposed to the most peculiar changes
[45:05] come over as the people's countenance
[45:07] Satan is afraid he knows that the Spirit
[45:10] of God is about to let the people know
[45:11] of his works that's why he hates these
[45:14] meetings so much when pitting wins names
[45:16] are called and diseases revealed Satan
[45:18] hates it now what is this it's not the
[45:20] mind-reading it's not telepathy it's not
[45:22] witchcraft it's a revelation by the Holy
[45:25] Ghost that is the only way I can know it
[45:27] of course the carnal mind will call it
[45:29] anything but the Holy Ghost let me show
[45:32] you know but that's also the the Word of
[45:34] God as a discerner of the thoughts and
[45:36] teams of the hearts Hebrews 4:12 so the
[45:38] same word as in our myths discerning the
[45:41] thoughts intents of the heart so we know
[45:42] the devil hates to be exposed because as
[45:45] soon as you can see him for what he is
[45:46] then you can get rid of them but as soon
[45:49] as you begin to think it's part of you
[45:50] you hold on to it you say well I have
[45:53] this grudge I have this Unforgiven it to
[45:55] have this and listen this if you own the
[45:56] thing you'll never get rid of it but if
[45:58] you recognize it's not me it's actually
[45:59] the work of the devil then you'll expose
[46:01] him and he's gone and then then you can
[46:05] actually cast it out but let me show you
[46:06] another reason why Satan hates the book
[46:08] of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[46:10] church so so in you he knows that Jesus
[46:13] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[46:15] forever and changes not he know
[46:17] a whole lot more than do 90% of the
[46:20] theologians he knows that since God is
[46:22] immutable in his nature then he's just
[46:24] as immutable in his ways that means he
[46:26] doesn't change the Satan knows assuredly
[46:28] that the original Church of Pentecost
[46:30] with the power of God marked 16 in
[46:32] action is the true church that Jesus
[46:34] claims as a zone all houses false it has
[46:37] to be now remember this Christ and the
[46:39] true church is a continuation of the
[46:41] book of Acts but the book of Revelation
[46:44] shows that the Antichrist spirit will
[46:47] come into the church and defile it
[46:48] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[46:50] and exposes Satan revealing his works
[46:53] now his works are the attempted
[46:55] destruction of God's people and the
[46:57] discrediting of God's Word this is what
[47:00] we have in this day the devil's tried to
[47:03] destroy you but he's also tried to
[47:04] discredit God's Word to you
[47:06] amen right down to the time he's cast
[47:08] into the lake of fire he fights that he
[47:10] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[47:12] people get the true revelation of the
[47:14] true church and what she is and what she
[47:16] stands for and that she can do the
[47:18] greater works she will be an invincible
[47:21] army so he tries to fight you stop you
[47:23] getting the true revelation of the true
[47:25] church and what she stands for I mean so
[47:28] therefore we should look into how he how
[47:30] he does that amen but also we should
[47:33] look into the true revelation of the
[47:34] true church I mean because you should be
[47:37] able to see the more that the word is
[47:38] preached faith is ministered and you see
[47:40] Bella see this is who I am
[47:42] hallelujah isn't that right you know
[47:44] when when when the people of Israel came
[47:46] out of Egypt to go into the promised
[47:48] land those that receive the word in
[47:49] faith they recognized there were sons of
[47:51] God they had inheritance in the land
[47:53] they already had the adherence they just
[47:55] had to go get it
[47:56] hallelujah so it's the same thing with
[47:57] us we have to recognize who we are now
[47:59] not who we become in but we are sons and
[48:03] daughters of God amen
[48:04] before the world began we were sons and
[48:06] daughters have gone I mean he told
[48:08] Jeremiah before you and your mother's
[48:10] womb I ordained you to be a prophet to
[48:11] the nation's holy so we don't become
[48:13] something were er but then we realized
[48:15] what we are amen so Lord yo I made the
[48:19] Lord show us what we are
[48:21] helllooo because I tell you what if you
[48:23] recognize all of heavens behind you Amen
[48:25] you'll be fearless I mean that you know
[48:27] that you know that your life is in God's
[48:29] hand doesn't
[48:29] what comes of ghosts everything is for a
[48:32] purpose I mean even even even everyday
[48:34] it seems like everyday things is
[48:36] actually God fulfilling his word you
[48:38] know we take when you know why did Mary
[48:41] and Joseph go to Bethlehem for Jesus to
[48:43] be born in the natural it was just the
[48:45] emperor of Rome saying I want to tax
[48:47] everyone so look just like a natural
[48:49] thing but it was actually prophecy being
[48:51] fulfilled God used that to cause them to
[48:54] go to Bethlehem because they would never
[48:55] have traveled in that season Amen Mary
[48:58] was about to give birth they wouldn't
[49:00] have traveled down to Bethlehem if it
[49:01] wasn't for the Emperor taxing the people
[49:05] he say was just a natural thing that
[49:08] moved them they know is actually God
[49:09] insuring his word was fulfilled so
[49:12] you're gonna look at everything
[49:13] things didn't see like everyday things
[49:15] natural things are happening but God's
[49:16] great cogs of the Wills of his prophecy
[49:19] are turning to get you to where you need
[49:21] to be oh yeah so we out there
[49:24] yeah we're I'm sure we have such
[49:25] confidence God everything that happens
[49:27] in my life it's your word being
[49:28] fulfilled hallelujah now he knows so
[49:35] amen so let me show you another reason
[49:38] why Satan hates this book of revelation
[49:40] of Jesus Christ of the church I mean he
[49:42] knows that Jesus Christ I'm just going
[49:44] to repeat this because I like it he
[49:46] knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[49:47] yesterday today and forever and changes
[49:49] not see the devil knows this he knows
[49:51] that a whole lot more than who 90% of
[49:52] the theologians he knows that since God
[49:54] is immutable in his nature he's just as
[49:57] immutable in his ways the Satan knows us
[49:59] surely that the original church at
[50:00] Pentecost were the power of God mark 16
[50:03] in action as the true church that Jesus
[50:05] claims as a zone all houses false and it
[50:07] has to be so with a dynamic power of the
[50:10] Holy Ghost as manifested that's the true
[50:11] Church of God now remember this but be
[50:14] Christ in the true church is a
[50:15] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[50:18] but the book of Revelation shows that
[50:21] the Antichrist spirit will come into the
[50:22] church and to file up making it lukewarm
[50:24] formal and powerless and exposes Satan
[50:26] the revealing of his works the attempted
[50:28] destruction of God's people and the
[50:30] discrediting of God's Word that's why
[50:32] the message is trying to be discredited
[50:33] the Word of God that's why the Bible's
[50:35] try to be discredited you can go through
[50:36] you know there's multiple websites they
[50:38] basically say the Bible's made-up
[50:40] it's not real it's just man's ideas
[50:42] man's true
[50:42] but but we know it's not I mean it's God
[50:45] is to finally reveal to you that this is
[50:47] the Word of God I mean that's you know
[50:49] then you can stand upon it I mean I
[50:51] don't believe the Bible because of
[50:52] tradition I believe it because the God
[50:55] of the Bible became real to me and
[50:56] vindicated this is his word amen and
[50:59] that that has to be to all of us we need
[51:01] to pray God make it reveal it to my soul
[51:04] that this is your word because if I know
[51:06] this is your word it's not man's ideas I
[51:08] can stand upon it holy because if we
[51:10] know this is God's Word and he is
[51:12] eternal we won't change our thinking
[51:14] based on society will keep our will keep
[51:17] exactly as what God says we'll keep that
[51:20] amen no sorry amen write down the time
[51:24] he's casted like a fire here out
[51:26] standard he knows that if the people get
[51:27] a true revelation of the true church and
[51:29] what she is what she stands for and that
[51:31] she can do the greater work she'll be an
[51:33] invincible army if see that's what the
[51:35] devil fights us he doesn't want us to
[51:38] get that true revelation of the true
[51:39] church and what she is the Word made
[51:42] flesh in this hour amen if they get a
[51:45] true revelation of the two spirits and
[51:47] this is why I want a beginner and and I
[51:49] won't start it now but I but I want to
[51:51] start a just a journey from Genesis or
[51:53] even before Genesis there's a war in
[51:55] heaven he brings Satan and you know that
[51:57] you're the two vines brother Aaron
[51:59] preached came out of Eden and now
[52:01] they're here and but it's not just it's
[52:04] not just when we look at it I won't just
[52:05] be on a national level or a church level
[52:08] it's an individual level and a family
[52:10] level I mean because the devil fights
[52:12] every layer you know he fights the
[52:15] church he fights the church age he
[52:17] fights a church he fights a family he
[52:19] fights an individual so we need to know
[52:23] so if they get a true revelation of the
[52:25] two spirits within the framework of the
[52:27] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[52:28] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[52:30] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[52:33] her who once Satan to be powerless
[52:34] before you he will be definitely thought
[52:37] at today as when Christ was stood as
[52:39] every effort to gain power over him in
[52:41] the desert yes Satan hates revelation
[52:43] but we love it worth true revelation in
[52:47] our lives the gates of Hell cannot
[52:48] prevail against us but we will prevail
[52:51] over them so we need to pray and lord
[52:53] give me prevailing revelation give me a
[52:55] revelation
[52:56] of your word hallelujah though that
[52:57] because it's by revelation we will
[52:59] overcome you will recall that I
[53:02] mentioned at the beginning of this
[53:03] message that this book that we are
[53:05] studying as an actual as the actual
[53:07] revelation of Jesus Amen himself in the
[53:10] church and his works in future ages then
[53:12] I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[53:13] Spirit to give us revelation or we'll
[53:15] fail to get it bringing these two
[53:17] thoughts together you will see that it
[53:19] won't just take ordinary study and
[53:21] thinking to make this book real and it's
[53:25] going to take an operation of the Holy
[53:27] Ghost that means this book can't be
[53:29] revealed to anyone but a special class
[53:31] of people so you saying because the book
[53:34] of Revelation is the bride's book amen
[53:36] that's why you know it takes more than
[53:37] just a natural study takes the author to
[53:39] come and reveal it to us I mean it will
[53:42] take one with prophetic insight I'll say
[53:44] actually the bride has prophetic insight
[53:46] it will require the ability to hear from
[53:48] God the bride can hear from God it will
[53:51] require supernatural instruction we have
[53:53] received supernatural instruction in
[53:54] this hour not just a student comparing
[53:57] verse with verse though that is good but
[53:59] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[54:01] Spirit or never becomes clear how we
[54:05] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[54:07] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[54:10] hear and know as I have already said
[54:12] this book revelation is the consummation
[54:14] of the scriptures that is it that is
[54:16] even placed exactly right and the Canon
[54:19] of Scripture at the end now we can know
[54:22] now you can know sorry why it says that
[54:25] anyone who reads or hears it is blessed
[54:27] and is the revelation of God that will
[54:30] give you authority over the devil quite
[54:32] a statement and you can see why why they
[54:36] who add or take from it will be cursed
[54:39] it would be so for who can add or take
[54:41] away from the perfect revelation of God
[54:43] and overcome the enemy as that simple
[54:45] there is nothing as such prevailing
[54:48] power as the revelation of the word
[54:51] that's the most powerful thing the
[54:53] prevailing power as the revelation of
[54:56] the word why is it prevailing because it
[54:57] shows you who you are
[54:58] and if you realize who you are then you
[55:01] will stand the devil you won't be swayed
[55:03] by him because you know who God has made
[55:05] you to be
[55:06] amen now even you know so we want the
[55:09] prevail
[55:10] power of Revelation in our lives that's
[55:12] why brother Aaron said pray for
[55:13] revelation more than anything Lord
[55:15] reveal your word to me make it plain
[55:16] make it make it true make it alive
[55:19] hallelujah you know that's that's how we
[55:21] need to be now he says in crisis Amisha
[55:25] God reveal this is the new birth as
[55:27] Christ as a revelation God has revealed
[55:30] to you this great mystery and that's a
[55:32] new birth now what are you going to do
[55:34] when you get all that group together
[55:35] with a revelation is perfect in harmony
[55:37] and God expressing it through his word
[55:40] by the same actions the same things that
[55:42] he did making the word manifest he says
[55:45] oh if the church only knew its position
[55:47] at will one day then the rapture will go
[55:50] when it knows what it is that's why we
[55:52] need to say Lord show me what I am and
[55:55] you reveal to me Who I am in you more
[55:58] than hid knowledge but revelation of my
[56:00] soul that I will know my position see so
[56:04] so so brother Branham is saying that the
[56:06] church doesn't need to get it to a
[56:08] position based on this quote but it
[56:09] needs to know its position so we need to
[56:11] know who we are in him I mean already
[56:14] right so you know see see see it's see
[56:18] it's when God reveals you that he's your
[56:21] father I mean more than a preacher
[56:22] telling you more than more than more
[56:24] than even even the mission when God
[56:27] comes in behind it and says that you're
[56:29] my child I mean that's God revealing to
[56:31] you hallelujah that is the revelation of
[56:34] the new birth cause you because we are
[56:36] born from above where we cry Abba Father
[56:38] my father my father
[56:40] hallelujah I mean so it's the same thing
[56:43] as when when Adam came to Eve and yo
[56:47] soso Eve was just taken out of Adam and
[56:49] then Adam said to Eve you are now bone
[56:52] of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall
[56:55] be called woman because she was taken
[56:56] out of man so it was Adam telling Eve
[56:59] this is who you are your bone of my bone
[57:01] flesh of my flesh life of my life you're
[57:03] part of me you came out of me it's the
[57:05] same thing with the word in this day it
[57:07] comes you this message come students is
[57:09] God's issue your bone of my bone flesh
[57:11] of my flesh life of my life power my
[57:13] power you are you came out of me just
[57:17] like as Jesus is I came from God and I
[57:19] go back to God now the bride can say I
[57:21] can
[57:21] from God and I'd go back from God and I
[57:23] was in the mind of God I manifested upon
[57:25] the earth and then I'm gonna go back to
[57:27] God
[57:27] hallelujah and and if you have that
[57:29] revelation in your soul I mean it
[57:31] doesn't matter what the devil tries to
[57:32] do against you you'll be able to
[57:34] withstand it because you recognize that
[57:36] this life this is not the end this is
[57:39] just a small brother man calls that a
[57:41] hickey on eternity a little bump you
[57:44] know this is what this is what this time
[57:45] is but in eternity is gonna roll on and
[57:47] I'll roll on with it hallelujah amen so
[57:51] yo who wants the rapture to go with in
[57:54] Lord show us who we are on you I mean
[57:57] but that's the thing that's why there's
[57:58] so many voices in this day to get our
[58:00] attention because the devil is trying to
[58:02] distract us I mean with everything but
[58:05] hearing God's voice that we know who we
[58:09] are in him because when the church knows
[58:11] its position in the rapture we'll go
[58:13] when she knows what she is we said Lord
[58:16] cleanse our mind cleanse our thinking
[58:18] that we know who we are anew I mean this
[58:21] is not some concept I'm talking about
[58:23] this is reality amen see so he said if
[58:27] they get a true revelation and of the
[58:31] two spirits within the framework of the
[58:33] Christian Church and by God's bro
[58:34] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[58:36] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[58:39] her Amy I just took that out of what we
[58:41] just read so it once Satan to be
[58:43] powerless before us doesn't mean he'll
[58:45] try yo that doesn't mean he'll quit but
[58:48] he needs to be powerless before us that
[58:50] we will never be overcome by him but
[58:51] he'll be overcome by us I mean so these
[58:54] two spirits have been at work since
[58:57] before before time began I mean when
[59:01] when when when Satan and Nikoli I mean I
[59:04] mean iniquity was found in his heart he
[59:06] says I'll be like the Most High I mean
[59:09] so and there was war in heaven amen and
[59:13] Michael and his angels fought those now
[59:15] Revelation chapter 12 there's war in
[59:17] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[59:19] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[59:21] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[59:23] was their place found any more in heaven
[59:25] so there was a war and the devil lost in
[59:28] heaven hallelujah and then now this ant
[59:30] this battle has now come down upon the
[59:32] earth now every now we know God
[59:35] changes his form right so the outward
[59:38] appearance of God changes so in the
[59:41] beginning he was the logos I mean you
[59:43] know he appeared to Abraham as as
[59:46] Melchizedek right Amen theophany form is
[59:49] a pillow fight of Moses here's a cloud
[59:51] by day pillar of fire by night I mean he
[59:53] was veiled in the prophets then he
[59:55] became the fullness of Godhead bodily
[59:56] and his son he went back to pillar of
[59:58] fire again and now he's failed in his
[1:00:00] people and the fellow fire has appeared
[1:00:02] again in this last day verse the same
[1:00:04] God all the way down through now so the
[1:00:07] same God that defeated Satan in heaven I
[1:00:10] mean has actually come down to the earth
[1:00:12] to pursue his enemy to the earth I mean
[1:00:15] so now up in heaven this is Michael and
[1:00:17] his angels fought this was Christ in
[1:00:19] angelic form and and and when when the
[1:00:22] devil and his angels were were fighting
[1:00:24] against them no doubt he saw a certain
[1:00:27] look in Michaels eyes Amen when he
[1:00:29] fought him because you know when you see
[1:00:30] someone's eyes you see their life Amen
[1:00:33] you see you see you know if someone's
[1:00:34] glazed over or someone's like this you
[1:00:36] know their eyes change but when they're
[1:00:38] focused you see a certain fire a certain
[1:00:40] zeal a certain you know is that love
[1:00:42] will hate you whatever it you see a life
[1:00:43] so that same life now so God cast as
[1:00:47] devil you know cast the devil down to
[1:00:49] the earth and we read in revelations
[1:00:51] chapter 9 that that angel fell that star
[1:00:54] fell so Satan fell to the earth he he
[1:00:57] didn't come down to the earth he fell
[1:00:59] why because he was he was defeated in
[1:01:02] heaven and then he was cast down to the
[1:01:04] earth even Jesus said I beheld Satan
[1:01:06] falling like lightning to the earth so
[1:01:08] he fell I mean but then when we come to
[1:01:10] revelations chapter 10 it says that
[1:01:12] mighty angel came down and when someone
[1:01:14] comes down they actually choose now I'm
[1:01:16] coming I'm not pushed I'm not falling
[1:01:18] I've come down why has he come down to
[1:01:21] pursuers enemy hallelujah true together
[1:01:23] his bride to himself at the same time
[1:01:25] continue the war that he won in heaven
[1:01:28] now he's going to win upon the earth I
[1:01:30] mean so now every time you know when we
[1:01:32] go through the scripture now there's
[1:01:34] always a clash between God and Satan now
[1:01:36] when we come to Moses and Pharaoh
[1:01:38] brother Ram says in the contest I
[1:01:40] believe it was he said that God was in
[1:01:42] Moses because he said to Moses and
[1:01:45] and xs3 and voices i've heard the cries
[1:01:47] of my people I have come down to deliver
[1:01:49] them and I'm sending you well it's
[1:01:52] happening now God was veiled and Moses
[1:01:53] but then now Satan was veiled in Pharoah
[1:01:56] so now when Pharaoh and Moses met
[1:01:59] together no doubt when the devil looked
[1:02:02] out of pharaoh's eyes and looked into
[1:02:03] Moses eyes he says I've seen this look
[1:02:05] before I've seen this look before when
[1:02:08] Moses came into the throne room and said
[1:02:11] let my people go
[1:02:13] they weren't Moses people they were
[1:02:15] God's people God was speaking first
[1:02:17] person through a man it was God using
[1:02:20] human lips saying let my people go and
[1:02:23] so Satan said I have seen this look
[1:02:27] before and then he tried to destroy
[1:02:29] Moses even before he came because he
[1:02:31] knew that the seed of the woman was
[1:02:32] going to bruise the head of the seed of
[1:02:34] the serpent deal it's going to come a
[1:02:35] serpent bruza I mean so that's why
[1:02:38] before Moses came he tried to kill all
[1:02:40] the boy babies in the Nile this is what
[1:02:42] our Christmas prison does amen I'm just
[1:02:45] going through a quick overview of the
[1:02:47] scripture to say this is what our
[1:02:49] Christmas prison has done to those who
[1:02:51] have received it in their day hallelujah
[1:02:53] if it did that in that day it'll do it
[1:02:55] in this day I mean you gonna see what
[1:02:57] you have I mean so so he tried to
[1:03:00] destroy he tried to destroy that serpent
[1:03:03] bruised it coming I mean but he he ended
[1:03:05] up raising that serpent brucer in his
[1:03:07] palace Moses was raised up in Pharaoh's
[1:03:09] Palace hallelujah
[1:03:11] and then so finally finally Moses comes
[1:03:13] to age he realizes who he is you know
[1:03:15] sure he has that you know he tries to do
[1:03:17] it on his own strength he fails
[1:03:19] miserably kills one Egyptian but then he
[1:03:21] meets the pillow fire in the burning
[1:03:23] bush and now God has veiled and the
[1:03:25] prophet he comes down into comes down
[1:03:27] into Egypt and now the serpent bruiser
[1:03:29] is going to say well if you will not let
[1:03:31] my people go I'm going to plague your
[1:03:33] kingdom until you have to let them go
[1:03:35] hallelujah so the plagues came death
[1:03:37] came and then finally Pharaoh said get
[1:03:39] your people and get out hallelujah
[1:03:42] why because the devil when he looked
[1:03:44] into Moses I said I've seen this person
[1:03:46] before and then he tried to now and then
[1:03:49] now when every prophet when they came to
[1:03:51] the earth God was veiled in that prophet
[1:03:53] in their day and there's always a clash
[1:03:55] between their Antichrist spirit and God
[1:03:57] spurn
[1:03:58] amen and then no doubt you know the
[1:04:00] devil you know when he looked in
[1:04:01] Elijah's eyes he says I've seen this
[1:04:03] look before and an Ezekiel and Isaiah
[1:04:06] and Jeremiah and yo and then it went
[1:04:08] from even Moses to Joshua that same one
[1:04:11] that was with Moses was with Joshua
[1:04:13] hallelujah but the devil couldn't stop
[1:04:15] nothing I mean they took their land how
[1:04:18] their God conquered I mean God conquered
[1:04:20] he says you go I'll fight the battle but
[1:04:23] you've got to go but so God gave him the
[1:04:25] land supernaturally that was God's
[1:04:27] Christmas present conquering hallelujah
[1:04:29] and then there was the forerunner you
[1:04:32] know about Lord the first time and in
[1:04:33] that same God and the fullness not just
[1:04:36] in part in the prophets but the fullness
[1:04:37] of God had Bodley came into a man Christ
[1:04:39] Jesus amen and then the devil tried to
[1:04:42] tempt him in the wilderness and he
[1:04:43] looked in his eyes he says I've seen
[1:04:46] I've seen this look before not in part
[1:04:49] now this isn't fullness oh my I've seen
[1:04:51] this look the same one that kicked me
[1:04:52] out of heaven and I've fallen down the
[1:04:54] same one has pursued me to the earth so
[1:04:57] he says now I'm just gonna try and kill
[1:04:58] him so you know they they they planned
[1:05:01] all their strategies how they're going
[1:05:02] to take take Jesus and crucify him but
[1:05:05] they couldn't do it in their own ability
[1:05:07] they needed someone of the inner circle
[1:05:09] to actually cause Jesus to be betrayed
[1:05:12] you know the devil only does us a what
[1:05:16] if he only just helps us you maybe never
[1:05:18] thought about this before you take Adam
[1:05:20] and Eve in the garden before there was
[1:05:23] sin and God has all these attributes in
[1:05:26] him to be a deliverer a savior a healer
[1:05:30] a redeemer a guide a comforter a
[1:05:33] sacrifice a high priest and advocate you
[1:05:36] know all those things are in him but he
[1:05:38] can't express the fullness of himself to
[1:05:40] Adam and Eve without suddenly being
[1:05:43] there because they never they don't need
[1:05:45] a Savior they don't need a healer they
[1:05:46] don't need a redeemer they don't need a
[1:05:48] comforter they don't need a guide
[1:05:49] they've never been lost you've never
[1:05:50] being sick they've never been you know
[1:05:52] they don't need an advocate why all as
[1:05:54] well right they don't need a sacrifice
[1:05:56] why they sacrifice for so there's a big
[1:05:58] part of God he could express to his
[1:06:00] children and then so what happened he
[1:06:03] had an agent there that actually
[1:06:04] unleashed the fullness of God upon Adam
[1:06:06] and Eve which was the serpent so the
[1:06:09] devil doesn't get no credit he actually
[1:06:11] is
[1:06:11] just a tool in God's hand I'm it's
[1:06:13] enough because if you think about it we
[1:06:15] can worship God in a far greater measure
[1:06:17] today then Adam and Eve could do before
[1:06:20] the fall because we know him as Savior
[1:06:22] we know him as Redeemer he's been my
[1:06:25] comforter he's been my guide he's my
[1:06:26] advocate he's on my side I mean he's my
[1:06:29] high priest he's my blood he's Mike he's
[1:06:31] my he's my peace he's my all and all
[1:06:33] they did enormous that but I know I'm
[1:06:34] like that and every time God reveals
[1:06:37] himself to us we can worship Him and
[1:06:39] Agreda way what do you mean by that
[1:06:41] who's so if you've never been sick you
[1:06:43] can't worship God as your healer you can
[1:06:46] know he's a healer but when he heals you
[1:06:47] then you can worship saying lord you're
[1:06:49] my healer you're wonderful if you've
[1:06:50] never been saved before you can never
[1:06:52] worship Him as Savior yet you may know
[1:06:55] in your mind he is a savior but when he
[1:06:56] saves you then you can worship Him and a
[1:06:59] far greater way than before
[1:07:00] hallelujah if you've never been lost in
[1:07:03] a trial and it comes and as your guide
[1:07:05] takes you to the trial then you can
[1:07:07] worship Him as your guide if you've
[1:07:09] never been troubled before you can't
[1:07:11] worship Him as confident cuz you'd never
[1:07:13] need it comforting hallelujah so we can
[1:07:16] worship God at now now this is just me
[1:07:18] and fellowship but we can worship God in
[1:07:19] a far greater way now than they could
[1:07:21] because we know all all the goddess oh
[1:07:24] yeah I mean so so judas iscariot so well
[1:07:30] I've already just given the answer but
[1:07:32] Judas caused the resurrection it was
[1:07:36] Judas it wasn't Jesus it wasn't the
[1:07:39] disciples it wasn't even the high priest
[1:07:42] it was Judas that actually gave them the
[1:07:44] ability he went to them said I know
[1:07:46] where you can get him with us not a big
[1:07:48] crowd you just took quietly you know
[1:07:50] bringing a few people you know he's a
[1:07:51] little guy anyway you know his his other
[1:07:54] disciples they're not fighters you know
[1:07:55] you know you just come him by night I
[1:07:57] know where he goes in secret I can show
[1:07:59] you where you can get him won't be a big
[1:08:01] scene just do it huh shush you know it
[1:08:04] was Judas that caused the resurrection
[1:08:06] it was Judas that actually caused the
[1:08:08] blood of God to be shed so it was
[1:08:10] actually Judas that actually caused me
[1:08:12] to receive eternal life if I can go to
[1:08:14] that extreme
[1:08:15] it was Judas they did it so the devil
[1:08:17] gets no credit I mean here's the son of
[1:08:21] perdition right but it was actually
[1:08:22] Judas so you can actually say thank you
[1:08:24] Judas
[1:08:25] for doing what you did because without
[1:08:26] you doing what you did I wouldn't have
[1:08:28] eternal life amen
[1:08:31] so the devil gets no credit so we think
[1:08:32] that you know people your spirits are
[1:08:34] against us and things are happening
[1:08:35] actually no God allows it that he wants
[1:08:38] to reveal more of himself to us
[1:08:40] hallelujah so it's actually you know the
[1:08:42] devil thinks he's got us in a corner no
[1:08:44] that's when God comes on the scene holy
[1:08:46] so he sees now and then he thinks
[1:08:48] finally the devil thinks finally you
[1:08:50] know because Jesus is on the cross and
[1:08:51] he thinks finally that one that I've
[1:08:55] seen before
[1:08:56] I've got him and he goes down to his
[1:08:58] lazy boy or whatever he sits down in
[1:09:00] hell he thinks finally all is done but
[1:09:04] he's wrong because in an unseen realm in
[1:09:09] paradise one just went into the door
[1:09:11] that was just before just before Jesus
[1:09:14] came in there's a knock on the door ones
[1:09:16] under expectation Adams been waiting
[1:09:18] Abel's been waiting all the believers
[1:09:20] down through the ages been waiting in
[1:09:21] Paradise under the blood of a lamb I
[1:09:23] mean waiting for the perfect lamb to
[1:09:25] come then finally one steps in the door
[1:09:27] who are you your prophet did you do this
[1:09:29] so that no what's your name
[1:09:31] thief on the cross thief on the cross
[1:09:33] what did you do well and he begins to
[1:09:37] tell his testimony of his life and you
[1:09:39] know you know it's amazing how the thief
[1:09:41] had to end up as the thief on the cross
[1:09:43] so God actually allowed him to have a
[1:09:46] broken life and and whatever crime he
[1:09:50] did whatever made him that way to end up
[1:09:54] on the cross God allowed it God allowed
[1:09:57] that I mean we think things are going
[1:09:59] sideways God's allowed it so here he was
[1:10:02] he says you know I was going to be
[1:10:04] crucified there was me and this other
[1:10:05] thief and and and and but it was a
[1:10:08] different kind of day there's such a
[1:10:10] howling mob and that crying for this
[1:10:12] blood of this Jesus of Nazareth and and
[1:10:14] he didn't he didn't even answer his
[1:10:16] accusers they put a crown of thorns on
[1:10:18] his head he was marred more than any
[1:10:19] other man and we followed him that day
[1:10:21] up Calvary up the hill we'll be
[1:10:22] crucified we're terrified they finally
[1:10:25] they pinned us to the cross with nails
[1:10:27] and we're hanging there and we both made
[1:10:29] fun of them we both said if you really
[1:10:31] be the Christ get us and you off the
[1:10:33] cross but then I had another look
[1:10:36] and I looked into someone's eyes that
[1:10:38] I'd never seen
[1:10:39] look like that before I said Lord
[1:10:41] remember me when you come into your
[1:10:43] kingdom and he said these words today
[1:10:45] you'll be with me in paradise now I'm in
[1:10:49] paradise but where is he
[1:10:50] and then there's another knock on the
[1:10:52] door hallelujah and then he steps in and
[1:10:56] then Adam leaves they look at the seed
[1:10:58] of the woman Daniel says yo that was yet
[1:11:00] this is the Ancient of Days Ezekiel says
[1:11:02] this is the wheel within the wheel Moses
[1:11:03] see there's the yo you're the one I saw
[1:11:05] Joseph sees is the captain of the hosts
[1:11:07] of the Lord hallelujah John the Baptist
[1:11:09] says this is him I baptized them here he
[1:11:12] is holy
[1:11:12] and that Jesus is okay children let's
[1:11:15] ascend up high Holly now on his side is
[1:11:19] the keys of hell death and the grave and
[1:11:21] before he even beat out paradise he's
[1:11:23] the devil sitting in his lazyboy you
[1:11:25] know down and down in hell thinking
[1:11:27] finally it's done i've got rid of him
[1:11:29] done I finally got him and then the door
[1:11:33] swings open and he comes the one he saw
[1:11:35] on the earth he says finally I've got
[1:11:37] you you know the devil sees the saint oh
[1:11:40] I thought I had you when I had Abel I
[1:11:41] thought I had you when I had Moses but
[1:11:43] finally you're here and Jesus says Satan
[1:11:46] shut up I'm me I'm the you know I'm the
[1:11:49] Almighty conquering son of God my blood
[1:11:51] is on the cross I purchased though there
[1:11:53] are depths of the whole world I'm in
[1:11:55] charge now boy give me those keys yes he
[1:11:57] took the keys of Hell death and the
[1:11:59] grave off him kick them back into hell
[1:12:00] then ascend it up and then maybe the
[1:12:03] devil thought finally it's done maybe I
[1:12:07] could just yo finally it's over now he's
[1:12:09] gone I'm glad that's over
[1:12:12] but there but God hasn't done God's not
[1:12:16] done you know I see this in South Africa
[1:12:19] I hope it doesn't come out the wrong way
[1:12:20] but you know devil means it tormentor
[1:12:23] devil means tormentor
[1:12:25] now the believer is the devil's
[1:12:28] tormentor so we are a devil - the devil
[1:12:32] you with me we are the devil's devil
[1:12:35] because because if God has a people upon
[1:12:38] the earth that actually has claims to
[1:12:40] the earth and the devil can't take fully
[1:12:42] over he can't yo-yo you know if there's
[1:12:44] a dispute and and and who this earth
[1:12:46] belongs to I mean it can only be dispute
[1:12:48] if there's a living witness upon the
[1:12:50] earth this is actually God has given
[1:12:51] this to us
[1:12:52] so so the devil knows he's got to wipe
[1:12:55] out the seat of God and if he can
[1:12:56] achieve that then it's rightfully his
[1:12:59] but here we are here we are upon the
[1:13:02] earth now the devil thought that that
[1:13:04] finally has his tormentor was dead on
[1:13:06] Calvary and then he had gone but then
[1:13:09] they came the day of Pentecost amen when
[1:13:11] when that same God now came in 12th and
[1:13:14] a hundred and twenty and brother Bram
[1:13:16] said that when when when when Peter and
[1:13:18] John were walking by the gate beautiful
[1:13:20] there was that lame man and then they
[1:13:22] and then they picked him up and he
[1:13:23] received strength and went walking
[1:13:25] leaping into the church amen
[1:13:26] he said that's what actually rap full up
[1:13:29] saying now I've got trouble why because
[1:13:32] that same one was now in 120 anymore
[1:13:34] after that and then so now the devil
[1:13:36] comes down and he anoints thee you know
[1:13:39] you know the high priest and the
[1:13:40] Sanhedrin had time to try and put
[1:13:42] pressure upon them do not preach in his
[1:13:44] name anymore but then he looked into
[1:13:46] their eyes and he recognizes I've seen
[1:13:49] this look before now these people did
[1:13:51] not have this look a few days before
[1:13:53] this I mean Peter James and John they
[1:13:56] didn't have this look because God wasn't
[1:13:57] veiled in them
[1:13:58] I mean before the day of Pentecost and
[1:14:00] so because you know you got to look at
[1:14:02] where wherever the life of God is that's
[1:14:05] where the devil fights you you go
[1:14:07] through the Gospels it says that they
[1:14:09] wanted to stone Jesus they were to throw
[1:14:11] him down a cliff and no they wanted to
[1:14:13] kill him why didn't that say they wanted
[1:14:15] to throw the disciples down the cliff or
[1:14:17] stone them they were there with him it's
[1:14:19] because the devil was trying to destroy
[1:14:22] the life of God that was there but then
[1:14:24] when that same life came into the
[1:14:26] disciples then the devil turned his guns
[1:14:29] against the disciples right so now so so
[1:14:32] Peter who is accounted neither the Lord
[1:14:33] three times cursed during it now he had
[1:14:36] received that overcoming power in his
[1:14:38] life and then when the devil looked into
[1:14:40] us his eyes he says now I've got trouble
[1:14:43] because I've seen this look before
[1:14:45] hallelujah hallelujah amen and then we
[1:14:49] can bring it all the way down to this
[1:14:51] day because I'm gonna I'm just gonna
[1:14:52] skip seven Church ages but that same God
[1:14:55] has fully restored his bride and then
[1:14:58] when the devil looks into your eyes he
[1:15:00] says now I've really got trouble because
[1:15:02] I've seen this look before and here we
[1:15:04] are at the
[1:15:05] if we live as a tormentor Satan I mean
[1:15:09] because there's a people upon the earth
[1:15:10] that don't want his tricks they don't
[1:15:12] want his devices they won't be a slave I
[1:15:14] mean to - to anything he has they're not
[1:15:17] interested in them not because they're
[1:15:19] taught that but only but because there's
[1:15:22] a there's not a thirst a desire for any
[1:15:24] of us things hallelujah now the reason
[1:15:27] that is so is because as we read in in
[1:15:30] Revelations 1 he has made us kings and
[1:15:33] priests to God now if he has made us
[1:15:35] kings and priests and we have been
[1:15:37] lifted up into a Dominion right a king
[1:15:40] has a Dominion now now so God's plan so
[1:15:45] God's plan is to open the spiritual eyes
[1:15:49] of people that his word is true that is
[1:15:50] the same today to quicken them to the
[1:15:53] promise of their age to reveal to them
[1:15:55] their position in Christ and for them to
[1:15:57] exercise their god-given Authority amen
[1:16:01] so so even Hebrews 11:6 ears for heat so
[1:16:04] there's the second part of verse 4 he
[1:16:05] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:16:07] is and as a reward of them that
[1:16:09] diligently seek Him I mean so we are
[1:16:13] called though if God has quickened us to
[1:16:16] the promise of the age and he has then
[1:16:18] we have to hold on to every promise and
[1:16:21] buck and back up from none of it I mean
[1:16:23] to every promise in the scripture every
[1:16:25] promise in the message we have to lay
[1:16:27] claim on it and don't back up
[1:16:29] irrespective of conditioner respective
[1:16:32] what's going on
[1:16:33] never ever back up for a promise of God
[1:16:35] never ever compromised on a promise of
[1:16:37] God never ever try to make peace with
[1:16:39] the devil say no God this is my word
[1:16:41] this is my promise I'm going to take it
[1:16:43] I mean just as just as the Philippian
[1:16:46] jailer was told he says believe he was
[1:16:49] told believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:50] and thou shalt be saved and thy house so
[1:16:54] he is told now if you believe on the
[1:16:56] Lord Jesus Christ the same faith that
[1:16:57] saved you will actually cause your
[1:17:00] family to be safe hallelujah so that so
[1:17:02] as brother Graham sees in the tocut
[1:17:04] message believe all the loot Lord Jesus
[1:17:06] Christ for your house
[1:17:07] amen so don't don't back up on it I mean
[1:17:10] if the flippy and jailer can believe on
[1:17:11] the Lord Jesus Christ for his own
[1:17:13] salvation and as house of salvation then
[1:17:15] we have the same faith we had the same
[1:17:17] god-given right
[1:17:18] holy soso if that is the case we should
[1:17:21] never back up on it one iota I mean so
[1:17:24] in other words jail of the faith you
[1:17:26] have to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:27] to be saved will save you and will also
[1:17:31] save your house so the same faith you
[1:17:34] have to receive salvation for yourself
[1:17:37] use that same faith on your household
[1:17:39] that they'll get saved as well now there
[1:17:42] has to come a time in our walk when we
[1:17:44] thank God for our salvation I mean we're
[1:17:47] going to say thank you lord thank you
[1:17:48] Lord Jesus that you saved me thank you
[1:17:51] you've healed me thank you have cleansed
[1:17:52] me thank youvery thank you've made me a
[1:17:54] new creature you go to thanking him
[1:17:56] right because remember it's already done
[1:17:58] right Jesus has already shed his blood
[1:18:01] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:18:03] of the world
[1:18:03] so it's already a finished work so what
[1:18:06] we need to do is start thanking God and
[1:18:08] faith for the salvation of your family
[1:18:11] thank God thank the Lord that the same
[1:18:14] blood he shed on the cross for you is
[1:18:16] for them as well it's the same sacrifice
[1:18:18] that worked on you it'll work on them so
[1:18:20] if that's the case then we should not
[1:18:22] never ever back up on any promise of God
[1:18:24] but we have a god-given Authority and we
[1:18:27] need to exercise that authority I mean
[1:18:29] and that's a respective of what you see
[1:18:31] how long time has nothing that God is
[1:18:33] eternal I mean we need to stand on God
[1:18:36] God's Word hallelujah told me in the day
[1:18:40] remember our life torments them you
[1:18:43] don't have to go and attack them you
[1:18:44] just you just live a consecrated life to
[1:18:47] God that is a torment brother Bram says
[1:18:50] when the weakest of Christians on the
[1:18:52] east in the kingdom of Hell shakes
[1:18:55] hallelujah
[1:18:56] earthquakes are fun when it's not when
[1:18:59] it's not on you
[1:19:00] only I mean so we should you know we're
[1:19:02] going to realize the power we have God
[1:19:04] has given us a meant so jesus said to to
[1:19:09] Pilate in John chapter 18 member we've
[1:19:12] been we've been made kings and priests
[1:19:14] to God now we know Jesus was born to be
[1:19:16] a king but it was not first over an
[1:19:19] earthly earthly Kingdom but it was our
[1:19:23] spiritual Kingdom now he will be king in
[1:19:27] the Millenium physically but right now
[1:19:30] it's over a spiritual Kingdom
[1:19:32] he says in John 18:36 jesus answered my
[1:19:35] kingdom is not of this world if my
[1:19:37] kingdom were of this world then would my
[1:19:39] servants fight then I should not be
[1:19:41] delivered to the Jews but now is my
[1:19:43] kingdom not from hence
[1:19:45] so saying my kingdom isn't as in a
[1:19:47] physical Kingdom it's a spiritual
[1:19:49] Kingdom and then Pilate therefore said
[1:19:51] unto Him art thou a king then and jesus
[1:19:53] answered thou sayest I am to this end
[1:19:56] was I born and for this cause came I
[1:19:58] into the world that I should bear
[1:19:59] witness unto the truth every one that is
[1:20:01] of the truth heareth my voice who showed
[1:20:03] his voice on this day amen
[1:20:05] Jesus sososo Jesus saying my kingdom is
[1:20:09] not earthly but it's spiritual now so if
[1:20:13] his kingdom is spiritual and the
[1:20:16] scripture of cities made us kings and
[1:20:18] priests as well in his kingdom then we
[1:20:20] then we are spiritual kings over a
[1:20:23] spiritual Kingdom amen so so he has
[1:20:26] taken us and he says he has made us
[1:20:32] kings and priests unto God and his
[1:20:33] father I mean so so I want to just focus
[1:20:36] on that he has made us kings now if we
[1:20:38] are kings then we have Dominion we have
[1:20:41] a rulership I mean I just want to sow so
[1:20:44] that and it's exactly the same Dominion
[1:20:47] he has we have he said and so those in
[1:20:51] the church age book in he has made us oh
[1:20:53] there are certain truths we need to
[1:20:55] emphasizes one of them he hath made us
[1:20:58] he has made me to be a spiritual King
[1:21:02] amen salvation is his doing salvation is
[1:21:05] of the Lord all of grace he redeemed us
[1:21:07] for a purpose he brought us for a
[1:21:09] purpose we are kings spiritual kings if
[1:21:12] we are going to be kings upon the earth
[1:21:14] with him when we sit when he sits on his
[1:21:17] throne but now we are spiritual kings
[1:21:20] and we reign over a spiritual Kingdom it
[1:21:22] says in Romans 5:17 for if by one man's
[1:21:25] offense death reigned by one much more
[1:21:28] they which receive abundance of grace
[1:21:29] and the gift of righteousness shall
[1:21:32] reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in
[1:21:35] Colossians 1:13 who have delivered us
[1:21:37] from the power of darkness and hath
[1:21:39] translated us enter into the kingdom
[1:21:42] into the
[1:21:42] dear son right now we reign with Christ
[1:21:45] having dominion over sin the world the
[1:21:48] flesh and the devil this is what our
[1:21:49] Christmas present does I mean showing
[1:21:51] forth his praise and glory showing forth
[1:21:54] himself for it as Christ and us willing
[1:21:57] and doing of his good pleasure yes
[1:21:59] indeed even now we are seated in
[1:22:01] heavenly places in Christ Jesus Amen so
[1:22:05] season Romans 8 he says that for we have
[1:22:08] not received a spirit of bondage again
[1:22:09] to fear that's not the spirit we have
[1:22:11] received but we have received the spirit
[1:22:13] of adoption and that word adoption and
[1:22:15] the Greek means the placing as a son
[1:22:17] whereby we cry Abba Father so my father
[1:22:20] my father I'm in the spirit itself
[1:22:22] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:22:24] are the children of God and if children
[1:22:26] then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs
[1:22:28] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[1:22:31] them that we may be also be glorified
[1:22:33] together so we are we are now joint
[1:22:36] heirs with Christ you say this may be
[1:22:38] very elementary this is very essential
[1:22:40] we need to recognize who we are I mean
[1:22:42] and it's all in our position so if we
[1:22:45] are joint heirs with Christ everything
[1:22:47] he has dominion over we have the same
[1:22:48] Dominion because we joint heirs with him
[1:22:51] now I was having fellowship with brother
[1:22:53] nd knee and he told me to read
[1:22:54] Colossians 2 so I did what I was told
[1:22:56] and says and ye he says and ye have
[1:22:59] therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:23:02] so walk ye in him rooted and built up in
[1:23:05] him and and established in the faith as
[1:23:08] ye have been taught abounding therein
[1:23:11] with Thanksgiving but where at least any
[1:23:14] man sport a spore spoiled you and that
[1:23:18] would spoil means to lead your way as
[1:23:20] booty so like a prisoner of war don't
[1:23:22] let any man take you as a prisoner of
[1:23:24] war I mean through philosophy and vain
[1:23:27] deceit after the tradition of men after
[1:23:30] the rudiments of the world and not after
[1:23:32] Christ in Christ as the word for in him
[1:23:35] dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
[1:23:36] bodily and ye are complete in him which
[1:23:39] is the head of all principality and
[1:23:41] power and whom also ye are circumcised
[1:23:44] with the circumcision made without hands
[1:23:46] and putting off of the body of the sins
[1:23:48] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[1:23:50] Christ that's why the things we wants to
[1:23:51] do we can't do because being cut away I
[1:23:53] mean the Spirit of God has circumcised
[1:23:55] those things from our
[1:23:56] I buried with him in Baptism wherein ye
[1:23:59] also risen with him through the faith of
[1:24:01] the operation now that word operation
[1:24:04] means the efficiency the energy the
[1:24:07] strong effectual working of God I mean
[1:24:10] who has race and from the dead so so we
[1:24:12] have been risen through the faith of the
[1:24:14] operation or the strong effectual
[1:24:16] working of God hallelujah who hath
[1:24:18] raised him from the dead and you being
[1:24:21] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[1:24:22] of your flesh hath hath he quickened
[1:24:26] together with him having forgiven you
[1:24:29] all trespasses just say that say that
[1:24:32] all trespasses he has forgiven all
[1:24:35] trespasses hallelujah oh yeah
[1:24:38] what does all mean that that's the
[1:24:40] entirety that's not a section that's not
[1:24:42] that's not God does never leave a part
[1:24:44] of our trespasses just for later to use
[1:24:47] as leverage against you that's not how
[1:24:49] God works amen he's cleansed it all from
[1:24:51] us blotting out I love this blotting out
[1:24:53] the handwriting of Ordinances that was
[1:24:56] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:24:58] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[1:25:01] cross and having spoiled principalities
[1:25:02] and powers he made a show of them openly
[1:25:08] openly triumphant triumphing over them
[1:25:11] in it hallelujah so he's saying that
[1:25:14] we're risen we're joint is I mean that
[1:25:16] he is the head over all principality and
[1:25:18] power and we're risen with them to that
[1:25:20] person see we need to recognize see
[1:25:22] we're not on our way to that position
[1:25:24] but the bride is in that position I mean
[1:25:27] it's already now we're in that position
[1:25:29] doesn't matter how you feel about it see
[1:25:31] the devil will always try and make you
[1:25:32] think you're a servant he'll always try
[1:25:35] and make you think you're seeing class
[1:25:36] citizen that you're not worthy I mean
[1:25:38] just like the prodigal son he he came to
[1:25:41] himself in the Pigpen the angel the Lord
[1:25:43] came and actually brought him back to
[1:25:45] his right mind after he selfishly said I
[1:25:47] want to do my things my way and spoiled
[1:25:49] his inheritance but then when he came to
[1:25:51] himself he realized that his father's
[1:25:54] servants loved better than then how he
[1:25:56] was but then he said I'm not worried
[1:25:58] that we call the Sun no more I'll just
[1:26:00] be a servant why because his own past
[1:26:03] was condemning him what he came from was
[1:26:05] condemning him in his mind so he thought
[1:26:07] because I've done it
[1:26:09] and zero I can even be restored to full
[1:26:11] sonship again but the father never had
[1:26:13] in his mind that he's going to keep his
[1:26:15] son a servant he wandered his son
[1:26:18] restored back to his rightful position
[1:26:20] in the family and it's that's why when
[1:26:23] the father saw the Sun coming afar off
[1:26:25] he rejoiced
[1:26:26] he didn't say now where have you been he
[1:26:28] wasn't it shouldn't that he was just
[1:26:30] happy his son had returned to him I was
[1:26:32] the same thing with you and I God just
[1:26:34] wants us to come back Amen he's not
[1:26:36] doesn't worry where we've been the blood
[1:26:38] takes care of that I mean his perfect
[1:26:40] blood is perfectly loose to us I mean
[1:26:42] from everything we've ever done
[1:26:44] hallelujah and then so and then so now
[1:26:46] the father did not interrogate the son
[1:26:48] he just said to a servant get the best
[1:26:50] robe get the ring put it on kill the
[1:26:52] fatted calf my son has returned worry I
[1:26:55] meant see see that was the father's mind
[1:26:58] I want my son restored to where he
[1:27:00] should be but the son thought I could
[1:27:02] never be a son again because I have
[1:27:04] wasted my life it's the same thing with
[1:27:07] us we always think there's no way I can
[1:27:09] be the Bride of Christ I can be where he
[1:27:11] is because of what I have done no we our
[1:27:14] thinking needs to change to match God's
[1:27:16] thinking if God's thinking is she's
[1:27:19] going to be restored made in my image
[1:27:21] send the spotless nothing held against
[1:27:23] her
[1:27:24] you never did in the first place you're
[1:27:25] justified then if that's how God is
[1:27:27] thought of me I mean that's how I'm
[1:27:29] going to believe that's what I am and if
[1:27:32] I believe that then therefore I can
[1:27:33] exercise my god-given office hallelujah
[1:27:37] so amen so so we need to recognize and I
[1:27:43] trust that we do that he has placed us
[1:27:47] in heavenly places now in the book of
[1:27:49] Ephesians when yo the book of Ephesians
[1:27:53] speaks much of of our position in Christ
[1:27:56] Christ's position and God you know
[1:27:58] Christ's position and then also our
[1:28:00] position in Christ and then because of
[1:28:02] our position we can withstand the devil
[1:28:04] because the God has fully equipped us to
[1:28:06] stand in this evil day now he says in
[1:28:09] Ephesians 1 in 19 he says and what is
[1:28:11] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:28:13] us would who believe according to the
[1:28:15] working of his mighty power which he
[1:28:18] wrought in Christ which when he raised
[1:28:20] him up from the dead and set him at
[1:28:23] zone right hand in the heavenly places
[1:28:25] so Christ was wrestled from the dead and
[1:28:28] he was placed at the right hand of God
[1:28:29] which is the which is the power your
[1:28:32] place of power and authority as the
[1:28:34] right hand in heavenly places and then
[1:28:37] now the Apostle Paul says where this is
[1:28:39] far above all principality and power and
[1:28:42] might and Dominion and every name that
[1:28:44] is named not only in this world but also
[1:28:47] that which is to come so Christ is sit
[1:28:49] at the right hand of God
[1:28:51] far above everything that can be named
[1:28:54] amen every sickness every disease every
[1:28:58] spirit every temptation whatever you can
[1:29:01] name
[1:29:02] he's far above that Amen it has put all
[1:29:06] things under his feet and gave him to be
[1:29:08] the head over all all things to the
[1:29:10] church which is his body the fullness of
[1:29:13] him that filleth all in all now we know
[1:29:16] that the body of Christ is not a
[1:29:18] headless body right if a body is alive
[1:29:21] and functioning where the head as the
[1:29:23] body is also you don't see my head
[1:29:25] floating here say hello and then walk in
[1:29:27] it and then float out know where my head
[1:29:29] goes my body goes with because it's
[1:29:31] attached right and we know that the
[1:29:34] blood of Jesus Christ has attached the
[1:29:36] head to the body I mean the word has
[1:29:38] attached the head to the body so we are
[1:29:40] no longer a headless church I mean but
[1:29:43] brother and says in Christ the mystery
[1:29:45] of God revealed the hid chippers here
[1:29:46] Christ the revealed Word is here
[1:29:48] hallelujah the headship over the body so
[1:29:50] now if the head has seated far above all
[1:29:53] principality and power and Dominion and
[1:29:54] every name that can be named then the
[1:29:56] body is there also amen
[1:29:58] so and and he says as an Ephesians two
[1:30:02] and four but God who is rich in mercy
[1:30:04] for his great lover and he loved us even
[1:30:07] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[1:30:09] us together with Christ by grace ye are
[1:30:12] saved and has raised us up together and
[1:30:15] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:30:17] in Christ Jesus so so because of what
[1:30:20] the Lord has done for us he has caused
[1:30:22] the bride because we've been quickened
[1:30:23] by the word of the state where was dead
[1:30:25] in trespasses and sins but we are now
[1:30:27] quickened by the word by the Spirit of
[1:30:29] God then he has caused us to be risen up
[1:30:31] to sit with him in heavenly places in
[1:30:34] Christ Jesus so that's why I said with
[1:30:36] as the body is also so now if Christ is
[1:30:39] far above all Dominion principality
[1:30:41] power everything that can be named we
[1:30:43] have to you are seated far above
[1:30:47] whatever the enemy is trying to against
[1:30:49] you I mean above this world system above
[1:30:51] every spirit of the devil above the
[1:30:53] devil himself held into the great you're
[1:30:55] seated far above I'm in all the works of
[1:30:59] the devil
[1:30:59] you are hallelu you are you are not
[1:31:03] under the devils feet you're far above
[1:31:05] and he's under your feet hallelujah
[1:31:08] that's what God has made you to be see
[1:31:10] see you got to recognize know the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost stood means the boss he's in
[1:31:15] charge
[1:31:16] he conquered hell death and the grave
[1:31:18] member the Holy Ghost and you has
[1:31:20] already overcome every spirit that can
[1:31:23] be named he conquered hell death and the
[1:31:25] grave as I said you know that same one
[1:31:27] that that bet took the keys off Satan
[1:31:30] inside that day is now in his people so
[1:31:33] the Holy Ghost in you has already
[1:31:34] overcome every temptation already
[1:31:37] overcome every spirit every doubt every
[1:31:39] worry or frustrations the Holy Ghost in
[1:31:42] you has already overcome it Amen
[1:31:45] hallelujah so now we are now far above
[1:31:49] all principality and power and might and
[1:31:52] Dominion and every name that is named
[1:31:54] not only in this world but also in which
[1:31:56] is to come I'm showing you what your
[1:31:58] Christmas present does because it's more
[1:32:00] than just eternal life but it's gotten
[1:32:03] out what is the power of eternal life
[1:32:04] there would be seated in heavenly places
[1:32:06] in Christ Jesus that all the works the
[1:32:08] devil would be under our feet even our
[1:32:10] own humanity Amy it would be subject to
[1:32:12] the Holy Ghost within us to the Word of
[1:32:14] God he says an expectation he says he
[1:32:17] says now you say just wait till some
[1:32:21] well it could be the millennium where we
[1:32:22] don't need any healings and things
[1:32:24] that's the next age to be issued in but
[1:32:26] now we're in the Holy Ghost age now we
[1:32:28] are the sons of God now we're seated
[1:32:30] together in heavenly places not we will
[1:32:33] be we are now this afternoon I'll say
[1:32:35] this morning right here now sons and
[1:32:37] daughters of God seated together in
[1:32:39] heavenly places in Christ Jesus there we
[1:32:41] are all things are possible then because
[1:32:44] of where God has placed us now Amen sir
[1:32:47] now also I do
[1:32:50] finished with this thought from from
[1:32:51] revelations one and five you know we
[1:32:54] need to recognize that when when when
[1:32:56] the Lord lays claim on us the devil has
[1:32:59] no part in the conversation no more
[1:33:01] right we have no relationship with Satan
[1:33:03] we don't need to fear him we don't need
[1:33:06] to fear any of his works
[1:33:07] you know nothing he can do against us
[1:33:10] can actually harm us because we are not
[1:33:13] under his Dominion no more men we're not
[1:33:16] partly under God's Dominion then Satan's
[1:33:18] Dominion oh when the Lord you know when
[1:33:21] when the book came open on this day it
[1:33:24] showed us with you know when the seals
[1:33:26] came off the book the lamb stepped forth
[1:33:28] that is to show us our inheritance right
[1:33:30] and our inheritance brother Brahim said
[1:33:33] now i'm not going to call you church no
[1:33:34] more I'm gonna call you bride now a
[1:33:36] bride does not belong to two heads right
[1:33:39] a bride has one husband Amen the Lambs
[1:33:42] wife only has one husband which is the
[1:33:44] word right so therefore we're under one
[1:33:47] hitch if were not under - I mean so now
[1:33:49] the devil has to recognize now if we're
[1:33:52] under the headship of the word then the
[1:33:54] devil has to you know he's got to mind
[1:33:57] what we say he's gonna listen to what we
[1:33:59] say and he has no right to dictate to us
[1:34:01] what we do because he's not in charge of
[1:34:04] me the Lord is in charge of me I mean so
[1:34:09] now the only way the devil can ever have
[1:34:12] had you're being charging us in any way
[1:34:15] as if he has claims on us right by our
[1:34:18] past things we do right but the blood
[1:34:21] has perfectly loosed us from everything
[1:34:25] the devil could try and claim upon us
[1:34:27] we've been washed of it so I'm just
[1:34:31] gonna go through this a bit and then we
[1:34:32] can look at our Christmas prison a bit
[1:34:35] more approve you know yeah with a lot
[1:34:38] more appreciation so so revelations one
[1:34:40] in five he says and from Jesus Christ is
[1:34:44] the faithful witness the first / God of
[1:34:46] the Dead and the Prince of the kings of
[1:34:47] the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:34:49] washed us from our own sins in his own
[1:34:52] blood now he says in Hebrews two and
[1:34:56] nine I'm just gonna read this he says he
[1:34:58] says but we see Jesus who has made a
[1:35:00] little lower than the Angels for the
[1:35:01] suffering of death crowned with glory
[1:35:04] honor that he by the grace of God should
[1:35:06] taste death for every man for became him
[1:35:08] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:35:11] all things and bringing many sons unto
[1:35:13] glory to make the captain of their
[1:35:15] salvation perfect through sufferings for
[1:35:19] both he that sanctifies and they who are
[1:35:21] sanctified are all of one for this cause
[1:35:23] he's not ashamed to call them brethren
[1:35:25] see he's not ashamed to call you
[1:35:27] brethren family God's not ashamed of you
[1:35:30] he doesn't you know you know whenever
[1:35:33] someone's you know he's not afraid to
[1:35:35] off you know if someone's coming up here
[1:35:37] to put you away in the corner so no one
[1:35:38] sees who you are
[1:35:39] no God chose you off he showed off job
[1:35:42] to Satan have you considered my servant
[1:35:43] job he's perfect there's none like him
[1:35:45] in all the earth and job and Joe Bull he
[1:35:48] had was the blood of the Lamb he didn't
[1:35:50] know anything about life hereafter you
[1:35:51] know anything he said your tree you know
[1:35:54] yeah you know a plant dies comes back to
[1:35:56] life again tree the same he saw death
[1:35:58] barrel resurrection of nature bee sees a
[1:35:59] man dies where does he go see all he had
[1:36:02] was the blood of the Lamb but God said
[1:36:03] he's perfect because he takes me at my
[1:36:05] word that's why he's perfect amen and
[1:36:08] and he's obedient to the word that
[1:36:10] that's been given and so God actually
[1:36:11] pointed out job to Satan Satan didn't
[1:36:15] didn't consider him a perfect man until
[1:36:17] God said look he's a perfect man
[1:36:18] and so now God has a test
[1:36:21] testimony service with the devil from
[1:36:24] time to time and he points you out have
[1:36:26] you considered my bride hey yeah he's
[1:36:28] proud he's proud of you they're perfect
[1:36:31] made in my image this is the apex of my
[1:36:35] creation this is the new creation upon
[1:36:37] the earth not a patched up creation but
[1:36:39] a new creation how they there's none
[1:36:41] like them in all the earth
[1:36:43] hallelujah see God was proud of you
[1:36:49] amen isn't he wonderful
[1:36:51] now hallelujah so so he's not a shame as
[1:36:57] this one hello thank you
[1:37:02] so I didn't turn that off Ruben need
[1:37:04] like a million microphones around here
[1:37:06] and obviously by the end of the service
[1:37:08] wine he'll still be going so he's not
[1:37:11] ashamed to call us brother but praise
[1:37:13] the Lord for the sound team Amy and
[1:37:15] again I'll put my trust in him again I
[1:37:17] behold I am the children which God hath
[1:37:19] given me for as much sin as the children
[1:37:21] are partakers of flesh and blood he also
[1:37:23] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:37:26] that through death he might destroy him
[1:37:29] that had the power of death that is the
[1:37:31] devil and deliver them who through fear
[1:37:33] of death were all their lifetime subject
[1:37:35] to bondage so he says I'm going to
[1:37:38] deliver them who through the fear of
[1:37:40] death were all their lifetime subject to
[1:37:43] bondage so now the Lord came that we
[1:37:45] don't need to fear nothing
[1:37:47] maybe because why do people you know
[1:37:49] people carry on a word because they have
[1:37:51] a fear when I die what's going to happen
[1:37:54] is everything fine am I going to be okay
[1:37:56] at the river but this misses the book
[1:37:58] came open to show us if we came from God
[1:38:01] we're going back to God also the shah's
[1:38:03] salvation is not the blood plus right
[1:38:07] it's not it's not Calvary plus it's
[1:38:10] blood alone I mean so we have a perfect
[1:38:13] lamb we have a perfect Christmas present
[1:38:15] amen and it's perfectly taking care of
[1:38:18] everything that we do not have when we
[1:38:21] go to cross that veil and go to the
[1:38:23] Eternity I mean some now but but the
[1:38:26] Lord has to reveal that to you that now
[1:38:29] you know that all fear is taken away
[1:38:31] well what if what if no no that's why
[1:38:34] you know nothing to my hands I bring
[1:38:36] simply to the cross I cling there's
[1:38:38] nothing we have to present us Lord just
[1:38:40] now be covered in your blood
[1:38:42] hallelujah that that would I come up
[1:38:45] into glory it won't be me it'll be your
[1:38:48] sacrifice Amen so now we had no longer
[1:38:53] need to be in fear were being delivered
[1:38:54] from fear and because it be yeah because
[1:38:58] he sees here because of fear they were
[1:39:00] subject to bondage all their lifetime
[1:39:03] they're in slavery because of fear of
[1:39:05] death but the Lord has taken all fear
[1:39:07] away because the blood has taken it away
[1:39:09] I mean so now we're no longer in bondage
[1:39:11] but we're free men and woman I mean
[1:39:14] we're are free people today
[1:39:15] hallelujah soso if we were free people
[1:39:18] were no longer under the bondage of the
[1:39:20] devil Orson he has no claim over us
[1:39:22] whatsoever
[1:39:23] we're free hallelujah amen
[1:39:28] now he sees in the church age book again
[1:39:32] you can see where I've been look it's
[1:39:34] wonderful
[1:39:35] revelations 105 unto him that loved us
[1:39:38] and washed us from our sins in his own
[1:39:40] blood he says the word washed is
[1:39:42] actually loose loosed us from our sins
[1:39:44] in his own blood isn't that wonderful
[1:39:45] but are you spiritually minded did you
[1:39:47] catch it it's his own blood that loosed
[1:39:49] us completely from our sins it is not
[1:39:51] human blood it was the blood of God amen
[1:39:54] Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul
[1:39:56] called the blood of the Lord and the
[1:39:58] blood of Christ not three persons but
[1:40:00] one person there is that revelation
[1:40:02] again one god the omnipotent Jehovah God
[1:40:05] came down and made himself a body by
[1:40:07] means of the virgin birth and wealth and
[1:40:10] and wealth at that it might be the blood
[1:40:12] of God that could free us loose us
[1:40:14] entirely from our sins and presenta
[1:40:17] spotless before himself with exceeding
[1:40:19] great joy
[1:40:20] would you like an Old Testament Tyrese's
[1:40:22] look let's go back to the Garden of Eden
[1:40:24] when the first news came to glory that
[1:40:27] the son Adam had been lost at God send
[1:40:29] an angel
[1:40:30] did he send a son that he sent another
[1:40:32] one like unto us no he came himself to
[1:40:35] redeem his lost son hallelujah God did
[1:40:38] not entrust his plan of salvation to
[1:40:40] another he trusted only himself God was
[1:40:43] made flesh and dwelt among us and
[1:40:45] redeemed us unto himself we were saved
[1:40:47] by the blood of God the eternal God and
[1:40:50] dwelt a mortal body in order to take
[1:40:52] away sin he became the lamb in order to
[1:40:55] shed his blood and enter into the Vail
[1:40:57] with it consider this sense it is the
[1:40:59] blood of God it is a perfect blood and
[1:41:01] if the perfect blood is loosing us from
[1:41:04] the power of bondage and the defilement
[1:41:06] of sin then the loosing is perfect and
[1:41:09] complete hallelujah
[1:41:11] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:41:13] who can layer saw lay anything to the
[1:41:15] charge of God's elect this God that
[1:41:17] justifies us which declares us righteous
[1:41:19] who is he that condemneth that us Christ
[1:41:22] that died Romans 8:33 34 there it is his
[1:41:25] death gave us the blood the blood has
[1:41:27] loosed
[1:41:28] there's now no condemnation how can
[1:41:30] there be there is nothing to be
[1:41:32] condemned for because the blood has
[1:41:34] loosed us from sin we are free guiltless
[1:41:36] don't listen to men listen to the word
[1:41:39] you are loosed by the blood now don't
[1:41:41] get tied down by traditions and creeds
[1:41:43] and organisations don't get led astray
[1:41:45] by listening to those that deny the
[1:41:47] power of the word and deny that Jesus
[1:41:49] Saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:52] and power you are God's free men loose
[1:41:54] by his own blood if you still hold your
[1:41:57] faith to creeds and denominations that
[1:41:59] certainly by the evidence that you've
[1:42:00] lost your faith in the word so he says
[1:42:03] that we are completely loosed from all
[1:42:09] sin and condemnation and guilt
[1:42:12] hallelujah now the scripture and and I'm
[1:42:16] just gonna finish with this that you
[1:42:18] know Hebrews 12 that that yeah now come
[1:42:23] on to Mountain Zion into the city of the
[1:42:25] Living God the heavenly Jerusalem into
[1:42:27] the and to an innumerable company of
[1:42:29] angels to the General Assembly in Church
[1:42:32] of the firstborn which are written in
[1:42:34] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[1:42:36] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[1:42:38] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[1:42:41] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:42:42] are you going to give me that or no okay
[1:42:45] that speakers better things than that of
[1:42:48] angel I'm sorry than that of Abel so we
[1:42:52] have come to this position now to that
[1:42:54] now I'm not going to go through all the
[1:42:57] now we've come to the General Assembly
[1:42:59] and the Church of the firstborn now we
[1:43:02] know God has no grandchildren
[1:43:04] all of us all of us sons and daughters
[1:43:06] he considers firstborn sons and sons and
[1:43:09] daughters now in the law everything
[1:43:12] that's firstborn had to be redeemed he
[1:43:15] was actually in the law it didn't matter
[1:43:17] if you're a donkey didn't matter if
[1:43:19] you're a sheep whatever it was but you
[1:43:21] actually there was a there was in the
[1:43:23] law the firstborn had to be redeemed by
[1:43:25] sacrifice so even now ourselves when we
[1:43:28] are here upon the earth God had to make
[1:43:31] a sacrifice in order that we would be
[1:43:33] redeemed because he cannot break his own
[1:43:36] law hallelujah so now thanks be to God
[1:43:39] now because of who we are
[1:43:41] had to make a sacrifice why I'm saying
[1:43:43] this is that God is already taking care
[1:43:45] of everything I mean there's no
[1:43:47] loopholes is no there's no wriggle room
[1:43:49] for the devil to get in God has taken
[1:43:52] care of everything for your earthly
[1:43:53] journey I mean and for you to recognize
[1:43:56] who you were that you exercise your
[1:43:59] god-given Authority in your possession
[1:44:01] Amy because remember if you're afraid
[1:44:03] people are afraid to god-given rights
[1:44:06] because they are worried that that that
[1:44:08] the devil can get ahold of them because
[1:44:09] of through through something right thing
[1:44:13] we get worried because of what the deal
[1:44:14] will may try and do but we're gonna have
[1:44:16] to have confidence no the blood has
[1:44:17] loosed me I'm free the devil has no
[1:44:20] claims on me no more has no gods bride
[1:44:23] errs without spot or wrinkle amen and
[1:44:26] and it's it's how God looks at you what
[1:44:29] matters you know there was a time when
[1:44:31] when when when when Israel was
[1:44:33] journeying to the promised land and they
[1:44:34] going through my web and Moab knew they
[1:44:36] couldn't fight Israel with natural
[1:44:38] armies they hired a prophet called
[1:44:40] Balaam and that tried to get Balaam to
[1:44:42] get in touch with God to curse Israel
[1:44:44] they knew this is how they're gonna win
[1:44:45] and then so they got Balaam and Balaam
[1:44:47] Balaam he was a he he had a gift of a
[1:44:52] prophet right here's a true you know the
[1:44:55] VESA was false but the gift was true
[1:44:56] actually says that the Spirit of God
[1:44:58] came upon him and he prophesied and he
[1:45:01] did it three times and then one of the
[1:45:02] times I'm the king of Moab see to see to
[1:45:06] Balaam I'll come take you around the
[1:45:08] back parts of Israel so all the week but
[1:45:11] although we're all the sinners all the
[1:45:12] terrible things happening because the
[1:45:14] king of Moab said surely if the Prophet
[1:45:17] sees everything everything that Israel's
[1:45:19] doing then God will curse them and
[1:45:21] ensure it so he shows in the back parts
[1:45:23] of of Israel and then and then the
[1:45:27] Spirit of God comes upon Balaam and what
[1:45:30] does God say I see no iniquity in Jacob
[1:45:33] this is God's testimony of Israel sure
[1:45:37] they had their sin they had their
[1:45:38] trouble they had their worries and all
[1:45:40] these things but because they are
[1:45:41] walking by the blood of the Lamb
[1:45:43] I mean when God looked down upon them he
[1:45:45] didn't see their sin and iniquity he saw
[1:45:47] that there was no iniquity in them
[1:45:49] because of the blood hallelujah so sure
[1:45:52] we have our problems and whatever is
[1:45:54] going on
[1:45:54] because the blood is applied we have a
[1:45:56] pure word which gives us the access to
[1:45:58] the fullness of the blood I mean when
[1:46:00] God looks down he says I see no iniquity
[1:46:02] in them amen so if God does not see
[1:46:06] iniquity in us then we have confidence
[1:46:08] with God we can go before them and get
[1:46:10] what we have need off amen
[1:46:14] so what is your Christmas present dude
[1:46:18] that's what my Christmas that's a part
[1:46:20] of what my Christmas present does amen
[1:46:24] so I trust that something else it would
[1:46:27] be a blessing but you know we need to we
[1:46:30] need just have confidence Lord you
[1:46:32] taking care of it all
[1:46:34] engines lose you we're saved by grace
[1:46:38] our walkers by grace
[1:46:40] let's divine a divine influence upon the
[1:46:43] heart and it's reflection the life he if
[1:46:44] he moved up I call you remember this
[1:46:46] message is a bridegroom call it's not
[1:46:49] just a general book call groom call it's
[1:46:51] a marriage call right if something in
[1:46:53] your soul has responded to it
[1:46:55] Amy what's happening God's become one
[1:46:57] with you how lujah and we know the very
[1:47:01] reason that this word this eternal word
[1:47:03] has got ahold of us as because we have a
[1:47:06] theophany in heaven waiting for us I
[1:47:09] meant this Christmas prisoners to align
[1:47:12] us with our theophany I mean so it's not
[1:47:15] a haphazard am I going to make it no if
[1:47:17] you got representation in heaven I mean
[1:47:19] then you're gonna make it cuz you've got
[1:47:20] a body to step into and the reason that
[1:47:22] you've been called upon the earth is
[1:47:23] because you have that body hallelujah so
[1:47:28] God's taking care whoa but but this
[1:47:29] thing you know there's so many things
[1:47:31] going on spirits fighting and all these
[1:47:32] things don't worry about it keeping them
[1:47:35] pray amen take your god-given Authority
[1:47:38] take your god-given rights exercise it
[1:47:41] don't be afraid of nothing the host
[1:47:44] should encamp against me in this thing
[1:47:45] I'll be confident the one thing I've
[1:47:47] decided the Lord roll by Biden is
[1:47:49] Tabernacle in the house of Lord forever
[1:47:50] though war should rise against me
[1:47:53] whatever it is don't worry about it
[1:47:54] stand on God's given word he'll see you
[1:47:57] through remember he knows what you have
[1:47:59] need of he knows how to get you to where
[1:48:01] you need to be remember Esther was a
[1:48:03] dainty queen God knew how she was she
[1:48:06] was never gonna be there
[1:48:08] being in Israel with appearance living
[1:48:12] in the promised land God allowed the
[1:48:15] nation to be carried off into idolatry
[1:48:16] God allowed her parents to die God
[1:48:19] allowed them to be carried and her to
[1:48:23] become the queen many times you say why
[1:48:27] is my life come out this way God knows
[1:48:29] why God knows why the path you've you've
[1:48:33] you've taken and many times we think
[1:48:34] we're just stumbling along but our whole
[1:48:36] life has been guided we have to have
[1:48:39] confidence Lord you got me here you'll
[1:48:41] see me through this is what my Christmas
[1:48:43] prison does
[1:48:44] it's my guide I mean this bow he's a
[1:48:48] word of prayer shawl we do know the
[1:48:50] musicians can come gracious Father
[1:48:52] Oh Lord this gift of eternal life you've
[1:48:55] given us Lord Lord without money or
[1:48:57] price Lord the greatest thing that
[1:48:59] anyone could ever receive is eternal
[1:49:01] life Lord Jesus Lord we know life does
[1:49:04] not consist of the things we own but
[1:49:06] lord life consists of knowing you I want
[1:49:09] to thank you dear God that no we don't
[1:49:12] worship a church law we don't worship a
[1:49:14] system of religion law but we worship
[1:49:16] the true and living God the Word made
[1:49:18] manifest Lord you Lord Jesus Lord were
[1:49:21] so thankful that we don't have a Lord
[1:49:23] it's just us and you walking together us
[1:49:25] in your word and I pray father Lord that
[1:49:27] each one here Lord may day maybe some of
[1:49:30] us Lord have not valued this Christmas
[1:49:33] gift well unlike Herod didn't value the
[1:49:36] Messiah coming he had his own ambition
[1:49:37] of wanting to remain king and all these
[1:49:39] selfish motives that he had he wanted to
[1:49:42] destroy you but Lord if he only really
[1:49:44] looked into the scripture and saw it was
[1:49:47] a manual being born it was you coming to
[1:49:49] the earth Lord to wash all our sins away
[1:49:51] Lord if he really saw the Christmas
[1:49:54] present Lord that you wanted to give it
[1:49:56] Oh Lord I believe the scripture would
[1:49:58] have ended up very different but father
[1:50:00] lord I want to thank you Lord that sure
[1:50:03] we can look back in his life but now now
[1:50:05] we have an opportunity dear God now we

[1:50:10] your Christmas gift and not just the
[1:50:12] wrapping not just maybe the surface of
[1:50:14] it but Lord Jesus the reality the
[1:50:16] reality a lord of eternal life and not
[1:50:19] just eternal life but law being seated
[1:50:21] heavenly
[1:50:21] places in Christ Jesus far above all
