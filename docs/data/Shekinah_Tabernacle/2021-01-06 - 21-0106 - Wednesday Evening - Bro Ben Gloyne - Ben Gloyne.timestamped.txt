[30:30] preach among the Gentiles The
[30:31] unsearchable Riches of Christ and to
[30:34] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[30:36] of the mystery which from the beginning
[30:38] of the world hath been hidden God who
[30:40] have created All Things by Jesus Christ
[30:43] to the intent that now unto the
[30:45] principalities and powers and Heavenly
[30:47] places might be known by the church the
[30:49] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[30:52] Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[30:55] Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have
[30:57] bold and access with confidence by the
[31:00] faith of him wherefore I desire that ye
[31:03] faint not at my tribulations for you
[31:05] which is your glory for this cause I bow
[31:08] my knees unto the father of our Lord
[31:10] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[31:13] Heaven and Earth is named that he would
[31:15] Grant you according to the riches of his
[31:17] glory to be strengthened with might by
[31:19] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[31:22] May dwell in your hearts by faith that
[31:24] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[31:26] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[31:28] what is the dep uh breadth and the
[31:30] length and the depth and height and to
[31:33] know the love of Christ which passes
[31:36] knowledge that ye may might be filled
[31:38] with all fullness of God now unto him
[31:40] that is able to do exceedingly
[31:41] abundantly above all that we we ask or
[31:44] think according to the power that
[31:46] worketh in US unto him be glory in the

[31:51] ages World Without End amen amen amen

[32:05] prayer so 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and 9
[32:08] 9-14 and
[32:11] um me go
[32:13] there so who's 1 Corinthians 2
[32:24] and9 says but as is it but as it is
[32:27] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[32:29] neither have entered into the heart of
[32:31] man the things which God hath prepared
[32:34] for them that love him but God hath
[32:36] revealed them unto us by his spirit for
[32:39] the spirit searches all things yay the
[32:41] Deep things of God yes sir for what man
[32:44] knoweth the things of uh for what man
[32:46] knoweth the things of a man save the
[32:48] spirit of man which is in him even so
[32:50] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[32:52] spirit of God now we have received not
[32:55] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[32:57] which is of god God that we might know
[32:59] the things that are freely given to us
[33:01] of God which things also we speak not in
[33:04] The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[33:07] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[33:08] comparing spiritual things with
[33:10] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[33:12] not the things of the spirit of God for
[33:14] they are foolish unto him neither can he
[33:17] know them because they are spiritually
[33:20] discerned amen let's bow heads in a word
[33:22] of prayer tonight Lord Jesus how
[33:25] thankful we are Lord Lord that it's by

[34:52] got no claim he's got no right right and
[34:55] you've got nothing to do with him either
[34:57] that's right so there's actually a
[34:58] demarcation between the believer and the
[35:00] devil the devil wants us to make think
[35:02] there's actually no separation between
[35:03] us and you I mean us and him but in
[35:05] reality there's a gulf aiming by the
[35:07] blood of Jesus Christ now we read here
[35:10] in Ephesians that you know there would
[35:12] come a time where this mystery of the
[35:15] you know the principalities and powers
[35:17] and Heavenly places might be made known
[35:19] by uh by the church the manifold uh
[35:22] wisdom of God so there's a time where
[35:24] these things had to become known of our
[35:26] position in Christ
[35:28] the power the and the authority that the
[35:30] believer has and the Apostle Paul would
[35:32] would unfold this to us and um you know
[35:36] I'm so thankful that there you know this
[35:39] is not just a uh you know the gospel or
[35:41] knowing the Lord is not just a you know
[35:45] a just a there's no depth to it or
[35:47] there's no reality to it it's not just a
[35:49] casual relationship but it gets deeper
[35:51] it gets richer it gets greater you know
[35:54] as as he walks with you and I and and he
[35:56] reveals himself with in the scripture
[35:58] you know we begin to you know we get to
[36:00] see his character more we begin to love
[36:02] him more we see who we are in him more
[36:04] and you know that you Paul was Paul was
[36:06] you know his his his purpose and really
[36:09] God's purpose was that Christ would
[36:11] dwell in our hearts by faith that You'
[36:14] be rooted and grounded in love and you
[36:16] may be able to comprehend with All
[36:18] Saints what is the breadth and the
[36:20] length and the depth and the height and
[36:22] to know the love of Christ which passeth
[36:24] knowledge that you might be filled with
[36:26] all the fullness of God so so Paul is
[36:28] saying this is not a onedimensional 1D
[36:30] kind of relationship you know God is not
[36:32] just one facet there's many facets to
[36:34] God and and and he was he was praying
[36:36] that we would we would comprehend
[36:38] everything that God is you know cuz
[36:40] people make an excuse well God is so
[36:42] great and he transcends time and how can
[36:44] he you how can man ever being a finite
[36:47] being know an infinite god well God can
[36:49] reveal himself to you amen right he can
[36:51] come down and show who he is to you and
[36:53] who you are in him am mean now this this
[36:56] word comprehend in the English it just
[36:58] means to mentally grasp something to
[37:01] understand something so you can be
[37:02] sitting in class and I you know sat
[37:04] maybe in class for 2 many years I've
[37:06] been to University for far too long but
[37:08] I had to grasp a lot of things I had to
[37:10] comprehend far too much but you know
[37:12] that's just a mental uh comprehension
[37:15] but the Greek word for this here to
[37:17] comprehend is actually deeper than just
[37:19] a to to grasp something mentally or to
[37:22] understand but it means to eagerly seize
[37:26] to possess the literally or figuratively
[37:28] to apprehend to attain to come upon to
[37:31] comprehend to find to obtain or to
[37:34] perceive so when the Apostle Paul is
[37:36] saying that we would that we would
[37:38] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[37:40] breadth the length and the depth and the
[37:41] height he's saying that we would cease
[37:43] upon it we would obtain it amen we would
[37:46] we would actually you know eagerly
[37:47] possess it amen hallelujah that we would
[37:49] we would uh we would obtain we'd
[37:51] perceive it we would apprehend it so
[37:53] we'd actually understand it so it goes
[37:55] beyond a you know when you apprehend
[37:56] something it's not just in your mind
[37:58] like if I got a hold of this I've
[38:00] apprehended my phone Hallelujah I I
[38:03] possess my phone now maybe before
[38:05] where's it gone you know you know too
[38:07] often I've lost my phone why do they
[38:09] make it black you know why I make a
[38:10] highlight of pink it'll stand out
[38:12] anywhere you you know but sometimes it's
[38:15] like where's it gone I know mentally
[38:16] it's mine but where is it but then I
[38:18] apprehend it oh hallelujah it's the same
[38:21] thing when it comes to the revelation of
[38:22] God and God wants to apprehend us he
[38:24] wants to seize our lives he wants us to
[38:26] really for us to recog you belong to me
[38:29] I bought you with a price which is the
[38:30] my own blood that I shed upon the Earth
[38:33] Hallelujah and he wants us to realize
[38:34] the devil has no relationship with us
[38:37] apart from he's our enemy but you know
[38:39] you know nothing he can do is for our
[38:41] good you know he you know it's kind of
[38:43] like a uh abusive relationship man and
[38:45] man and the devil you know the Devil
[38:48] comes along and tries to be all nice and
[38:49] loving but then he beats and gets angry
[38:51] and abuses and you know destroys and
[38:53] then comes the next day and tries to be
[38:55] nice again and Patch it up it's just a
[38:57] cycle of abuse but then the Lord comes
[38:59] in and he breaks that cycle Hallelujah
[39:02] and he begins to show no you were never
[39:04] meant to be in a relationship with the
[39:05] devil but you meant to be in Union with
[39:07] me Hallelujah and when you realize that
[39:10] you're in Union with Christ and the
[39:11] devil's been kicked out and the devil
[39:13] tries to come back and you say hold on
[39:15] devil you have no place huj I have no
[39:17] relationship I have no dealings with you
[39:19] I don't belong to you you're no part of
[39:21] me and that's how we should be
[39:23] Hallelujah so I'm glad that there is
[39:27] there is come a time and now is that we
[39:29] would comprehend the depth of
[39:32] God
[39:34] hallelujah
[39:36] now when we read there in Corinthians
[39:39] and I will get to my thought I just want
[39:40] to lay this background because you know
[39:42] the reality of being free in the
[39:44] lord it's such a it's such an easy
[39:46] phrase to say I'm free I'm free indeed
[39:50] but the magnitude of that the reality of
[39:52] the freedom we have is an incredible
[39:54] thing and to me when when the Apostle
[39:57] Paul Paul is is is speaking of the
[39:59] depths you know you know the Deep things
[40:00] of God the spirit searches out all
[40:02] things yeah the Deep things of God now
[40:04] I'm in First Corinthians 9 and 10 here
[40:07] you know he's not to me he's not talking
[40:09] about abstract ideas he's not talking
[40:12] about you know just just Concepts he's
[40:14] talking about reality he's talking about
[40:16] something you know the Deep things you
[40:17] know when we when we think about the and
[40:20] this is not just one of them but but you
[40:22] know a deep this word deep things in the
[40:24] Greek it means a of I've never heard of
[40:27] this word before but
[40:29] profundity which is the quality or the
[40:32] state of being profound that's what it
[40:34] means it's something that's profound
[40:35] it's it's got a quality to it it's not
[40:37] just a empty phrase you know there's a
[40:39] depth to it there's a meaning there's a
[40:41] profoundness to it Hallelujah and by
[40:44] implication the extent of it so when he
[40:46] talks about this the spirit would search
[40:48] out all the you know the Deep things of
[40:51] God it would search out the extent of
[40:54] God the depths of him you know the
[40:56] richness of his character the richness
[40:58] of his being the richness of his word
[41:01] hallelujah that's right am amen so
[41:03] there's a spirit within the believer
[41:05] that they want more of God Amen they've
[41:08] had it all but they want more Hallelujah
[41:10] you know we're not satisfied with just
[41:12] living off memories of what he did in
[41:14] the past we want more Hallelujah we've
[41:17] seen him do incredible things but we
[41:19] want to see more see him do more
[41:20] incredible things he's opened his word
[41:22] to us so much we want more you know
[41:25] Jesus said when the spirit of Truth
[41:27] shall come he will lead us and guide us
[41:29] into all truth he'll Lead You Lead you
[41:31] and guide you into all truth well people
[41:32] say well this is the complete revelation
[41:35] of Jesus Christ and it is but is it is
[41:37] it revealed to you see it was revealed
[41:40] to Paul but it had to be revealed to the
[41:42] Saints so the spirit of Truth had to
[41:45] come and actually make this live and a
[41:47] reality to the Saints the same thing
[41:49] with you and I you know you first get
[41:51] saved you first meet the Lord there's a
[41:53] lot of things that haven't become
[41:54] reality to you and you may have read it
[41:56] many times but when it strikes home
[41:59] Hallelujah then what what's that the
[42:00] spirit of Truth is leading and guiding
[42:02] you showing you your position in Christ
[42:05] so maybe you know you first meet the
[42:07] Lord but there's still a lot of uh bad
[42:09] habits in your life you know the devil's
[42:11] lust the devil's perversion hatred
[42:13] malice Strife those are things the devil
[42:15] tries to keep in our lives for him to
[42:17] make us think we have a part in him or
[42:19] he has a part in us but then the Lord as
[42:22] as we walk with him he casts those
[42:25] things out he sanctifies us us takes
[42:28] those things from us and but but how
[42:29] does he do it he gives us Revelation in
[42:31] the scripture you don't have to have
[42:33] those things you don't have to keep with
[42:35] that lust or that problem that hatred
[42:37] that unforgiveness that buness whatever
[42:38] it may be you don't have to live with
[42:40] that you say well my father was like
[42:42] this my grandfather my great great great
[42:44] great grandfather but no there but there
[42:46] comes a time when your eyes come open
[42:49] when you realize this is not my portion
[42:51] amen this shouldn't belong to me it
[42:53] never was meant to belong to me so you
[42:54] kick it out Hallelujah and that's what
[42:56] that's what the spirit of Truth does he
[42:59] leads you and guides you into all truth
[43:01] that you would recognize that you're a
[43:02] Son of God more than just a mental idea
[43:05] yes I'm a son or a daughter of God but
[43:06] the Lord shows you actually you are
[43:08] joint air with Christ hallah you are a
[43:11] son or a daughter of God therefore you
[43:12] have certain rights over the devil and
[43:15] those rights are for him to be under
[43:16] your feet Hallelujah and remember if the
[43:19] devil's not under your feet he's out of
[43:20] his position but this is the season
[43:23] where everyone comes to their position
[43:26] Hallelujah yeah the devil thinks he's
[43:28] going to be the head but he's actually
[43:29] the tail Hallelujah he thinks he's in
[43:31] charge but no no no he's under the feet
[43:33] of the body of Christ and I can't
[43:36] remember who said it but I like the
[43:37] saying you know you may be the skin on
[43:40] the bottom of the little toe of the body
[43:42] you're still on top of the head of the
[43:43] devil amen hallelujah you may be the
[43:46] most bottom point of the body it doesn't
[43:47] matter the devil's still under you
[43:50] Hallelujah so we need to recognize that
[43:52] he has no part in us we have no part in
[43:55] him Hallelujah because that's what the
[43:57] blood does the blood cleanses Us in such
[43:59] a way that there's actually the devil
[44:02] can have no claims on the bride of
[44:03] Christ anymore the believer the devil
[44:06] cannot accuse them anymore cu the blood
[44:09] covers them sure we you know we have
[44:12] memories of things we did in this body
[44:14] and things that we well and truly regret
[44:16] but in God's books are you know as I've
[44:19] said there's a blank page
[44:22] Hallelujah I'm glad there's a blank page
[44:25] now Jesus would would would um would
[44:28] tell his disciples as he's sitting there
[44:30] in the Last Supper they're about to go
[44:31] to the Garden of Gethsemane and um you
[44:34] know he's speaking to them and he says
[44:36] in John 14 and and and verse 30
[44:39] Hereafter I'll not talk much with you
[44:41] for the prince of this world cometh and
[44:43] hath nothing in me but that the world
[44:46] may know that I love the father and and
[44:48] as the father gave me commandment even
[44:50] so do I do arise let us go
[44:53] hence now when when Jesus says that the
[44:56] so the prin this world we know is the
[44:58] devil right it's not pilate it wasn't
[45:01] the high priest it was the Devil Himself
[45:03] but Jesus is saying that he has nothing
[45:05] in me he has no part in me now other
[45:08] translations would say he has nothing
[45:10] over me he has no power over me he has
[45:14] no claim on me this is what Jesus is
[45:15] saying about the Devil he's got no claim
[45:17] over me he's got nothing over me he's
[45:19] got no power over me remember Jesus
[45:21] recognized who he was Hallelujah and he
[45:24] wants us to recognize Who We Are
[45:27] amen that we have been raised up in this
[45:29] generation to conquer the devil amen we
[45:32] have the overcoming power in us already
[45:34] our faith gives us a victory how do you
[45:36] say well I'm weak in faith that faith is
[45:38] enough to conquer every devil am mean
[45:40] that that faith is enough to cast him
[45:41] out of your life Hallelujah so Jesus
[45:45] saying this this guy has nothing over me
[45:48] he's got no leverage against me he's got
[45:50] no power over me and he has no claim on
[45:53] me and this is the same this is what the
[45:56] Lord wants us to realize that the devil
[45:59] has no nothing over me he has no power
[46:02] over me he has no claim on me Hallelujah
[46:06] Church says I trust you say Amen the
[46:08] devil has no claim over me he has no
[46:11] power over me he has nothing over me why
[46:14] because the blood of Jesus Christ has
[46:15] cleansed me from all sin Hallelujah he
[46:18] has taken my past away I mean he has
[46:20] broken that First Union and now I'm
[46:22] being united with another amen which is
[46:24] Christ himself so because of the blood
[46:26] ofes Jesus Christ now the devil has
[46:28] nothing over me he has no claim on me
[46:31] but the devil would like me to think
[46:32] that he does I mean but he doesn't
[46:36] amen hallelujah and so we need to
[46:40] recognize that we're free the remember
[46:44] we want to we want to recognize the
[46:45] depth of this Freedom now the depth of
[46:47] this freedom is not a part-time
[46:50] Freedom it's not when you're just
[46:51] feeling good kind of Freedom it's not
[46:53] just kind of I'm at camping everything's
[46:55] wonderful kind of Freedom this is fre
[46:57] day Freedom Jesus would say whom the son
[46:59] has set free is free indeed and you
[47:01] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[47:03] make you free amen so there's a force in
[47:05] the truth that will make a person free
[47:08] hallelujah amen amen so there's now
[47:10] there's a force that is driving the
[47:12] believer to be free it makes us free so
[47:15] the truth itself because many you know
[47:18] many times you think how can I get out
[47:19] of this well you shall know the truth
[47:22] and we know the truth of the scripture
[47:25] and that truth will make us free there's
[47:27] a force in it to actually cast The Devil
[47:29] out of our Lives there's a force in it
[47:31] to take sickness out of our Lives
[47:33] there's a force in it to take bad habits
[47:35] out of our Lives unforgiveness
[47:36] resentment whatever Spirit may be upon
[47:38] us that's trying to afflict us there's a
[47:40] force in the truth that will make us
[47:42] free of it Lord hallelujah remember
[47:45] because we you know man was never built
[47:47] to be a slave to the devil man was never
[47:50] made to serve the devil man was made to
[47:54] have dominion upon the Earth that's what
[47:56] man was built for that was his original
[47:58] purpose was to God told Adam Adam and
[48:01] Eve subdue you know have
[48:04] dominion yes we're in Genesis now so
[48:07] that was the original plan for man was
[48:10] to have dominion but then the devil came
[48:12] in dethrown man off being you know being
[48:15] being in charge of this world and from
[48:17] that time on man has been a slave where
[48:20] where Jesus would well yeah Jesus would
[48:22] say in Ephesians chapter 2 where we once
[48:24] walked according to the spirit of the
[48:26] world the prince of the power of the air
[48:28] we once did so man was actually born
[48:31] walking according to the prince of the
[48:33] power of the air but there comes a time
[48:35] where that devil gets dethroned
[48:38] hallelujah amen but down through the Old
[48:40] Testament even though the blood of bulls
[48:42] and goats would cover the sins of the
[48:43] people it could never change the nature
[48:45] of the people even Moses with an
[48:47] incredible Ministry that he had he still
[48:49] had that Fallen nature and we can go all
[48:52] the way through but now one man had to
[48:54] come to undo what the devil did in the
[48:56] beginning we know that was God became
[48:58] flesh Hallelujah God became a man to
[49:01] reconcile the world to himself and so
[49:03] now when Jesus came he knew who he was
[49:07] he knew that he was the second Adam he
[49:09] knew the devil had no claim on him he
[49:12] knew he had authority over the devil I
[49:14] mean when he was asleep tied after a
[49:16] very very busy meeting in the back of a
[49:18] boat and they're sailing across the
[49:20] other side and all the Devils got into
[49:22] the wind and to the waves and you know
[49:23] cuz we know the devil causes storms and
[49:25] now B basically it becomes a battle who
[49:28] really is the master of the wind and and
[49:31] and and the disciples were panicking
[49:33] they wake up Jesus yo don't you care
[49:35] master we're going to perish and the
[49:36] Creator himself stood up because the
[49:39] devil S I have Master over this nature I
[49:41] have Master over the elements but the
[49:43] one who made them stood up and said
[49:44] peace be still and the world had to obey
[49:47] amen the voice of the Creator and that
[49:49] proved that Jesus has the power to
[49:52] control any
[49:53] situation Hallelujah doesn't matter if
[49:55] it's Lazarus and the grave it's a storm
[49:57] whatever it may be amen he has power
[50:00] amen over every situation in life yes
[50:02] sir that's right hallelujah amen so
[50:05] there he was now he knew he had power
[50:07] over the devil he defeated he defeated
[50:10] Satan in the wilderness by just quoting
[50:12] the
[50:12] scripture and he knew that he did not
[50:15] have to serve the devil the devil tried
[50:17] to make him serve him well how did that
[50:19] work well if you be the Son of God turn
[50:21] these stones into bread you you need
[50:22] bread so the devil was trying to lead
[50:24] the Son of God but then Jesus said get
[50:27] behind me Satan man shall not live by
[50:29] bread alone but by every word that
[50:31] proceeds out of the mouth of God and
[50:32] then he tried to get him to jump off the
[50:34] temple and fall down worship receive all
[50:36] the kingdoms of the world so the
[50:38] anointing that was upon the Lord with
[50:41] stod and he said no I'm not going to
[50:44] obey you devil yeah now it should be the
[50:46] same thing with you and I if we have the
[50:48] Holy Ghost In Our Lives it gives a power
[50:50] in our lives to withstand the devil
[50:52] trying to lead usall Hallelujah it gives
[50:55] us a power now you say well I fall many
[50:57] times there's blood hallelujah amen we
[51:00] you remember because we are growing into
[51:01] maturity Jesus knew who he was but when
[51:04] we're born into this world we have no
[51:05] idea who we are we think we're from this
[51:08] country with this nationality these kind
[51:09] of family traits but then the Lord comes
[51:12] because we are Sons and Daughters of God
[51:14] and the spirit of God comes upon us and
[51:16] we realize who our real father is and
[51:18] then we begin to grow in Grace and
[51:20] mature Hallelujah so at the start of our
[51:23] Christian walk or even even today you
[51:26] know we can trip and you know the devil
[51:27] can get us by some slight of hand but
[51:30] there'll come a time where those things
[51:33] no longer bother us I mean some things
[51:35] maybe you you it's like a little kid
[51:37] learning to walk he can put your foot
[51:39] out and over he goes but there comes a
[51:41] time where he'll sight step that trip
[51:44] Hallelujah and then you got to get more
[51:45] inventive maybe you know to try and trip
[51:47] him up but then eventually he'll
[51:48] outsmart you H are the devil he oh I've
[51:51] got to really work how to trip these
[51:53] people up but eventually Hallelujah
[51:56] because we don't want to walk you know
[51:58] obstructed we don't want to walk with
[52:00] God and you know trip up by the devil so
[52:02] we want to keep walking So eventually
[52:04] doesn't matter what the trial will be
[52:05] remember there's victory in it there'll
[52:07] be victory over that thing amen
[52:10] hallelujah amen Lord amen that's right
[52:13] it's not him that falls him that gets
[52:15] back up Lord try me one more
[52:17] time
[52:20] Hallelujah now in the in the message of
[52:23] the future home brother Brown speaking
[52:25] of when Jesus was back baptized by by by
[52:28] John the
[52:29] Baptist he says
[52:31] here Jesus speaking to John suff uh
[52:34] suffer it to be so for thus it is
[52:36] becoming to us we know the message to
[52:38] fulfill all righteousness I am the
[52:40] sacrifice that must be washed he
[52:42] suffered him when he went up out of the
[52:44] water he said I saw Heavens open pardon
[52:46] me the prophet saw it he saw the heavens
[52:48] open and here come to sending out of
[52:50] Heaven a form of a dove and a voice
[52:52] saying this is this is my part of the
[52:55] earth that I have redeemed
[52:56] and from this part of the earth I will
[52:58] redeem the rest of it for he is my word
[53:01] made manifest in the whole world I spoke
[53:04] it into existence by my word Hebrews 11
[53:06] and Satan has held it all this time but
[53:09] I've come to redeem it so much of it has
[53:12] has made his body and I'm coming to
[53:14] dwell in it because remember Jesus was
[53:15] was part of the earth his body was part
[53:18] of the earth the things he ate was from
[53:20] the earth so so God is saying I'm going
[53:22] to use this part of the earth to redeem
[53:24] the rest of the earth Hallelujah so what
[53:26] is he declaring I've redeemed this part
[53:28] I'm going to use it to redeem you and I
[53:30] because remember eventually you look at
[53:32] the Earth itself eventually the devil
[53:33] won't be here he's going to be burned up
[53:36] he's going to be gone he's got an expiry
[53:39] date and he's already gone off we know
[53:41] that but you know there's going to be a
[53:42] time when he's going to be thrown in the
[53:43] dumpster and it's going to be an
[53:44] incinerator and he's going to be chucked
[53:45] in there Hallelujah so this Earth is not
[53:48] going to have the devil on it Hallelujah
[53:51] so so we know the Earth is redeemed in
[53:53] the same stages that we're redeemed
[53:55] Justified sanctified baptism of the Holy
[53:57] Ghost Hallelujah so now just as just as
[54:00] the whole earth will be redeemed and
[54:02] then the glory of the Lord will you know
[54:03] fill the place and we will dwell upon it
[54:05] in new heavens and a new Earth so we are
[54:09] redeemed in the same process but just as
[54:11] the Earth comes to a state where there's
[54:13] no devil there we are in that same state
[54:16] but we have to get to that state before
[54:19] the Earth does and we're in that state
[54:21] before we get a new body cuz remember it
[54:24] doesn't matter how many mind battles
[54:25] comeing
[54:27] the number of Mind battles does not
[54:29] reflect on your salvation or your
[54:32] Victory right because remember this is
[54:34] no man's land and the devil has a right
[54:37] to fire thoughts and cause trouble but
[54:40] it doesn't reflect on your soul because
[54:41] of your soul is sealed in by the Holy
[54:43] Ghost the devil may get into your mind
[54:46] or he may get into your body and make
[54:47] you sick but he can't touch your soulen
[54:50] huah and that's the main thing you can
[54:51] be you you can be a nervous wreck you
[54:53] can be sick as a dog but if you're
[54:55] sealed into the kingdom all
[54:58] well Hallelujah yes sir now I love it in
[55:01] Revelations 12 it says there was war in
[55:03] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[55:05] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[55:07] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[55:10] was their place found anymore in heaven
[55:12] so there came a point where you know the
[55:14] devil was doing this thing in heaven and
[55:15] you know Gathering all the other angels
[55:17] and you know making a coup and trying to
[55:19] take over but there came a time where he
[55:21] was cast out and there's no place for
[55:22] him anymore so there's a vacancy in
[55:25] heaven where he used to occupy he fell
[55:28] from it and their place wasn't found
[55:29] anymore now we know that that battle
[55:31] fell upon human beings Hallelujah but
[55:34] then there came a time where he wasn't
[55:36] found there was no place for him anymore
[55:37] in
[55:39] me Hallelujah cuz once he led me once he
[55:41] was my king by default but then another
[55:44] king came along the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:46] and kicked him out Hallelujah so he has
[55:48] no place in me anymore but I've got to
[55:49] realize okay so if I'm God's why should
[55:52] I allow the devil to come in and try and
[55:54] take
[55:55] over why should I listen to his thoughts
[55:58] why should I obey
[56:00] him think about it he has no place in me
[56:03] I have no place in him there's a
[56:04] demarcation line that's right Hallelujah
[56:07] so so if that's the case now why should
[56:09] I listen to him the blood has CLE yeah
[56:12] we're not our own we're bought with a
[56:13] price which is the precious blood of
[56:15] Jesus Christ so we are actually a
[56:16] purchased possession Hallelujah so we
[56:19] are if we are Gods then we're not the
[56:22] devils and remember we we we were never
[56:25] actually meant to be the devils in the
[56:26] beginning we never actually belonged to
[56:27] him right we always were
[56:29] Gods he just came to find and seek and
[56:32] save those which were lost in order for
[56:34] something to be lost it had to be found
[56:37] but then it had to be in possession but
[56:38] then lost and then found again just like
[56:41] my phone as I said it's mine but then I
[56:43] lose it so I seek it and say this is
[56:46] mine
[56:48] Hallelujah Glory I'm glad the Lord found
[56:52] me you know shamgar there's only one one
[56:56] scripture written about Shamar brother B
[56:59] says but that's all that matters you
[57:01] know I don't know how many Harvest
[57:03] Seasons the Philistines were part of his
[57:06] life every every harvest season maybe
[57:09] just cut down all the wheat and the
[57:10] barley and whatever you know picked all
[57:12] of his fruit whatever more and he put it
[57:14] into the storehouse and things and then
[57:16] maybe he thinking maybe maybe this
[57:18] season they won't come again but then he
[57:20] hears the stomp stomp stomp of the
[57:22] Philistine soldiers coming up and
[57:23] they're saying oh Shamar what he got for
[57:25] us this year and you know you had a real
[57:27] good crop last year I hope you've been
[57:28] working hard and you know and and the
[57:31] Philistines were part of his life but he
[57:34] had to realize they weren't meant to be
[57:36] part of his life am they were actually
[57:38] not their their place wasn't actually on
[57:41] his ground that wasn't their right there
[57:43] the same thing with the devil devil he
[57:45] can be a part of our life but you got to
[57:47] recognize he was never meant to be part
[57:48] of my life it was meant to be me and God
[57:51] alone remember our our relationship with
[57:53] the Lord is not us the devil and God
[57:56] it's us and God the you the devil just
[57:59] tries to cut in but you going to say no
[58:00] devil I'm sorry I'm married Hallelujah
[58:04] and I'm not flirting with you hallelujah
[58:07] amen then then the Devil comes along you
[58:09] say you you just call your husband on
[58:11] the scene and he's going to kick him out
[58:13] Hallelujah so Shema had to come to the
[58:16] realization this has to come to an end
[58:18] these people aren't meant to be here and
[58:20] and when I talk about Philistines I'm
[58:22] talk about demon Spirits you know they
[58:23] can be gone and come and go just like
[58:25] these philes but he had to realize they
[58:28] weren't meant to be part of his life
[58:30] remember they were the ones that invaded
[58:32] on his land he didn't invite them to
[58:34] come and live where he was or come and
[58:36] invite and take his crop they just
[58:37] turned up it's like the devil he turns
[58:39] up to steal kill and destroy but you got
[58:41] to realize actually they're not meant to
[58:44] be part of this scene they're not
[58:45] they're not meant to be part of my life
[58:47] so he realized remember it wasn't he
[58:49] didn't suddenly become an
[58:51] overcoming son of Abraham when he picked
[58:54] up the ox goat and went after them he
[58:56] already was but he had to realize who he
[58:58] was he had to realize that this was
[59:00] actually his position and Hallelujah and
[59:04] he came to a realization this don't have
[59:06] to end up the same way I can put an end
[59:08] to this right now by Who I Am Not Who
[59:11] I'll become who I am right now and the
[59:13] scripture says today we're the Sons and
[59:15] Daughters of God not we will be one day
[59:17] we are right now Hallelujah and he took
[59:19] us o go 600 blows to the Head later you
[59:23] know the end of the story Hallelujah
[59:25] shot was on they
[59:27] died amen so we can live with things and
[59:31] we can actually realize we can actually
[59:33] fail to realize it's the devil troubling
[59:35] us now brother brah talks quite a lot
[59:38] about nervous conditions whoever you
[59:41] just search nervous condition through
[59:42] the message it's prevalent and it's
[59:44] still prevalent today but many times we
[59:48] don't understand well people no doubt
[59:51] didn't understand what was causing the
[59:53] nervous condition they maybe thought
[59:55] well they just just going through a
[59:56] stressful time of life maybe the kids
[59:58] are a certain age there's pressure at
[1:00:00] the job there's pressure at home
[1:00:02] pressure in church lot of trouble things
[1:00:04] going on and it made them that
[1:00:06] way but we know a nervous condition is
[1:00:09] not actually just a natural thing that's
[1:00:12] a demon power yeah brother would say
[1:00:15] this now something happened in the
[1:00:17] audience now just keep
[1:00:19] believing there was a woman that was
[1:00:21] praying it's a much older woman than
[1:00:24] this and she appeared here before me
[1:00:26] praying someone's praying for a trouble
[1:00:28] in here that's the that's touch the high
[1:00:30] priest let us talk again I can only go
[1:00:34] as the spirit leads me oh you're not
[1:00:35] here for yourself you're here for
[1:00:37] someone else see see brother seeing a
[1:00:39] vision now that's a man it's your
[1:00:41] husband and he suffering with you call
[1:00:43] it a demon depression it's a nervous
[1:00:47] condition that's broke his nerves down
[1:00:50] so it is actually a demon depression but
[1:00:54] people would call it just a nervous
[1:00:55] condition
[1:00:56] so it's actually the devil trying to
[1:00:58] break someone down it's a demon power
[1:01:01] coming against them but if but if we
[1:01:03] don't realize that it's that we'll just
[1:01:05] well I'm just a bit nervous cuz I got
[1:01:06] this trouble in my life but it's
[1:01:08] actually the devil trying to destroy
[1:01:11] someone thank you Lord It's a nervous
[1:01:14] condition that broke his nerves down
[1:01:15] that's thus sayith the lord it's true
[1:01:17] isn't it if it is wave your hands do you
[1:01:19] believe me to be his Prophet take that
[1:01:21] handkerchief that you wiped your tears
[1:01:22] with and lay it on him and he will be
[1:01:24] made well thus sayith the Lord if thou
[1:01:26] can us believe have faith in God don't
[1:01:27] doubt now have faith in God be real
[1:01:29] reverent be real reverent now so you
[1:01:32] know we have to realize when you know we
[1:01:34] know we all have different
[1:01:36] Natures right some are very flagma some
[1:01:39] are very dogmatic or you know whatever
[1:01:41] the different labels are for all those
[1:01:43] things but you know there comes a time
[1:01:45] where you know our nerves can get real
[1:01:47] on edge but it's not a natural reason
[1:01:50] it's actually a devil trying to get us
[1:01:53] or you know maybe just real you know
[1:01:54] short fuses and high temper and trouble
[1:01:56] you know what what it's the devil trying
[1:01:58] to get us but we need to realize that
[1:02:00] it's the devil trying to get us we need
[1:02:02] to realize that it's not a natural well
[1:02:04] I just don't have much sleep or
[1:02:06] something like that no it's not that but
[1:02:07] it's the devil trying to afflict us but
[1:02:09] you know we have to realize you know
[1:02:11] when you know the devil tries to hand us
[1:02:13] a lot of things brother Ram says it's
[1:02:15] like you know he gives us a box of
[1:02:17] rattlesnakes and he can even say you
[1:02:20] know your name's on it but we have the
[1:02:23] power Just say if I'm the I'm the here
[1:02:26] there's a box R next see K andu this is
[1:02:29] for you now yeah good man but you see no
[1:02:34] no it's really for you you have to take
[1:02:35] it look sign for it see someone spent
[1:02:37] it's very heavy someone spent a lot of
[1:02:39] money see he has the power to receive it
[1:02:43] or to reject it and the more we
[1:02:45] entertain a spirit it's actually us
[1:02:48] receiving it now now that doesn't mean
[1:02:50] you go on denial about symptoms if you
[1:02:52] got cancer you got cancer sure but you
[1:02:54] know you actually have to realize this
[1:02:55] is never meant to be part of me or this
[1:02:58] unforgiveness this bitterness this
[1:02:59] nervous condition whatever may be going
[1:03:01] on this is never actually meant to be
[1:03:03] mine remember we meant the Christians
[1:03:05] are meant to be happy hallah meant to
[1:03:08] have joy unspeakable full of Glory
[1:03:10] irrespective of can you know what's
[1:03:12] going on in life you know we're not
[1:03:13] meant to be all sad and down and super
[1:03:16] serious and you know can't laugh and
[1:03:18] stuff we're not meant to be that way
[1:03:20] we're meant to be happy we have eternal
[1:03:22] life that should make us real happy
[1:03:24] right on our way to heaven shouting
[1:03:26] we're not going to see the Great
[1:03:27] Tribulation Isn't that cool that's real
[1:03:30] cool Hallelujah hey the world's falling
[1:03:32] apart well that's all right I've Got My
[1:03:34] Ticket out of here hallelujah when's he
[1:03:36] turning up well maybe tomorrow maybe
[1:03:38] right now that's fine Hallelujah do you
[1:03:40] have to get to a euphoric State no no no
[1:03:42] no I just believe the word hallelujah
[1:03:44] remember it's not a state of euphoria
[1:03:46] that we'll be in to get us out of here
[1:03:47] no it's a revelation of the word that
[1:03:49] will get us out of here
[1:03:52] hallelujah
[1:03:54] amen Hal Hallelujah so we have a right
[1:03:57] we can either sign for
[1:03:58] it or we can be a believer like brother
[1:04:01] ker and turn it
[1:04:03] down hallelujah it's up to
[1:04:07] us now we don't order these things
[1:04:10] sometimes they just turn up sometimes
[1:04:13] there's a real battle on you know God
[1:04:15] God heals in different ways does he not
[1:04:17] he's not not a cookie cutter like you
[1:04:19] take the life of David he killed he used
[1:04:21] a sling to Kill The Lion and the Bear in
[1:04:23] Goliath but he never uses a sling again
[1:04:26] sometimes God tells him go into battle
[1:04:28] other times he says wait till you hear
[1:04:30] the you know the rushing of the Wind
[1:04:31] Through the mury Trees the sound of it
[1:04:32] going then rise up and he own kill so so
[1:04:35] God is not a cookie cutter so sometimes
[1:04:37] he'll just heal supernaturally instantly
[1:04:40] sometimes it'll be a you know it'll take
[1:04:43] time sometimes he uses
[1:04:45] medicine sometimes you got to carry it
[1:04:47] to
[1:04:49] death amen sometimes it's that way but
[1:04:53] you know so God God does different
[1:04:55] things sometimes it can just be a simple
[1:04:57] change of diet or are you getting enough
[1:04:58] sleep I'm just so worn down all the time
[1:05:01] I'm like this well have you had a have
[1:05:03] you had a
[1:05:04] break
[1:05:06] amen how's your diet going what are you
[1:05:08] feeding on sometimes you used get prayed
[1:05:11] for and it's just gone instantly other
[1:05:13] times lay hands on the sick and they
[1:05:14] shall
[1:05:15] recover right other times you know we'll
[1:05:19] carry it to the Grave it's actually our
[1:05:20] ticket out of here now that that one's
[1:05:22] not really the rejoicing one but you
[1:05:24] know
[1:05:26] but God is not a cookie cutter sometimes
[1:05:28] he uses medicine sometimes he doesn't
[1:05:30] use medicine we're going to be open for
[1:05:32] all opportunities I mean all all all
[1:05:36] avenues but we got to realize that just
[1:05:38] because we get sick or just because we
[1:05:40] have trouble in our mind it doesn't mean
[1:05:41] we're not Believers because the Devil
[1:05:43] comes along as soon as they're trouble
[1:05:45] remember I think it was brother Ryan hay
[1:05:46] said when he when he when he gave the
[1:05:48] testimony of that song that sister Jenny
[1:05:49] s you know he says we should um um he
[1:05:53] said rather we should many times we are
[1:05:55] defined by by our trials and by our
[1:05:58] circumstances but those things shouldn't
[1:06:00] Define us what should Define us is our
[1:06:03] identity in the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:06:06] should be what really defines us sure
[1:06:07] we'll have trials we'll have struggles
[1:06:09] we'll have circumstances we'll have
[1:06:10] battles but those things should never
[1:06:12] Define us who we are in the Lord should
[1:06:14] be our defining Mark
[1:06:18] hallelujah
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:23] now we have Colossians uh 3 and and one
[1:06:26] if ye then be risen with Christ seek
[1:06:29] those things which are above where
[1:06:30] Christ sth on the right hand of God set
[1:06:32] your affection on things above not on
[1:06:34] things of the Earth for ye are dead and
[1:06:36] your life is head with Christ and God so
[1:06:39] so as as Jesus says that the devil has
[1:06:42] no claim on me he has no pardon me you
[1:06:44] know he has no uh um power over me if
[1:06:47] our lives if we are dead and our lives
[1:06:49] are hidden God I mean hidden Christ with
[1:06:51] God then we can say the same thing I
[1:06:54] remember we're God's children am we're
[1:06:56] not the devil's children we don't belong
[1:06:58] to him we never did
[1:07:02] hallelujah amen so when Christ who is
[1:07:05] our life shall appear then shall ye also
[1:07:09] appear with him in glory mortify
[1:07:11] Therefore your members which are upon
[1:07:13] the Earth of fornication uncleanness
[1:07:15] inordinate affection evil concent and
[1:07:18] covetousness which is idolatry for which
[1:07:21] thing sake the wrath of God cometh on
[1:07:23] the children of Disobedience and which
[1:07:25] you also W walked sometime when you
[1:07:28] lived in them but now ye also put off
[1:07:31] all these anger wrath malice blasphemy
[1:07:34] filthy communication out of your mouth
[1:07:36] lie not one to another seeing that ye
[1:07:38] have put off the old man with his deeds
[1:07:42] I put him off took off the old man do
[1:07:45] not resuscitate amen got he died that
[1:07:48] guy so so so if that life is dead he's
[1:07:51] been drowned he's gone why why would I
[1:07:54] want to live in that way I'm walking in
[1:07:55] of life amen I mean remember it was
[1:07:58] never it was never our uh God never
[1:08:01] intended
[1:08:02] us to live a fallen way in terms of
[1:08:07] being full of anger wrath blasphemy
[1:08:09] malice filthy communication over our
[1:08:11] mouth lying you know all those things
[1:08:14] that wasn't meant to be our portion
[1:08:16] we're meant to be Overcomers when he
[1:08:18] thought of us he saw us as an
[1:08:20] overcomer Hallelujah before the
[1:08:22] foundation of the world you know many
[1:08:23] times it's name occupation date of birth
[1:08:26] whatever you know name balore and

[1:08:46] we need to realize sure we're in this
[1:08:48] flesh this guy there's going to be a
[1:08:50] body change and maybe the older we get
[1:08:52] the more we're going to rejoice in that
[1:08:53] not necessarily because we age but
[1:08:55] because we realize this guy gets us into
[1:08:57] a lot of trouble but we need to realize
[1:09:00] actually I'm not meant to be following
[1:09:02] this guy I'm going to drag this guy to
[1:09:06] Heaven he doesn't want to go he wants to
[1:09:08] be lazy he doesn't want to come to
[1:09:09] church he doesn't want to pray he wasn't
[1:09:11] to read the Bible but I'm going to make
[1:09:13] him do it he didn't want to get baptized
[1:09:15] he got baptized H he didn't want to come
[1:09:17] to the altar he came to the altar he
[1:09:19] didn't want to receive the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:20] got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and he'll
[1:09:22] take a Rapture too one day your body
[1:09:24] will thank you for it
[1:09:28] amen and have put on the new man which
[1:09:30] is renewed in knowledge after the image
[1:09:32] of him that created him where there is
[1:09:35] neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor
[1:09:37] uncircumcision Barbarian cynthian Bond
[1:09:39] or free but Christ is all and in all put
[1:09:43] on therefore is the elect of God holy
[1:09:45] and beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[1:09:47] humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:09:49] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[1:09:52] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:09:54] quarrel against any even so Christ
[1:09:56] forgave you so also do ye amen and above
[1:10:00] all these things put on charity which is
[1:10:02] the bond of perfectness and let the
[1:10:04] peace of God rule in your hearts to
[1:10:06] which also ye are called in one body and
[1:10:10] be ye thankful let the word of Christ
[1:10:12] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:10:14] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:10:16] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:10:19] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[1:10:21] Lord and whatsoever you do in word or
[1:10:23] deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:25] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:10:28] him prise the Lord hallelujah so this is
[1:10:30] what we should do because you know if
[1:10:32] you think about
[1:10:33] it to to be holy well that's an
[1:10:36] attribute of God remember the devil
[1:10:37] wants his attributes to be displayed in
[1:10:39] our lives he wants unbelief malice
[1:10:42] Strife hatred variance bitterness
[1:10:45] whatever it may be gossip all those
[1:10:47] things he wants those things to be
[1:10:51] manifested and he and and he tries to
[1:10:53] allow them you know he tries to put them
[1:10:54] in US
[1:10:55] and then he says well you have pardoned
[1:10:57] me because I can see myself in you you
[1:11:01] know you look at your kids and you can
[1:11:02] see there like a
[1:11:04] stamp amen so the devil tries to make
[1:11:07] his character expressed in us and he's
[1:11:09] trying to say actually there's a we got
[1:11:10] a connection going
[1:11:12] on but then really you got to realize no
[1:11:15] no no no that connection got severed the
[1:11:17] blood of Jesus Christ broke that broke
[1:11:19] that connection so now we're connected
[1:11:22] with another which is Christ himself so
[1:11:24] you look at all these attributes that I
[1:11:26] just read out or or way your character
[1:11:29] that I just read out this is all the
[1:11:31] that's all God's character to be holy
[1:11:35] bows of mercies God is rich in Mercy
[1:11:37] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:11:39] longsuffering bear forbearing one
[1:11:41] another and forgiving one another all
[1:11:44] those things are are the character of
[1:11:45] Christ being being being displayed
[1:11:48] Hallelujah so so whenever God sees his
[1:11:50] word manifested so you you you see that
[1:11:53] manifested you know you in our lives God
[1:11:55] looks down and says I see myself in that
[1:11:58] person Hallelujah you know he says we we
[1:12:01] got we got something going on Hallelujah
[1:12:03] there's a Divine
[1:12:05] connection
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:11] hallelujah
[1:12:13] amen so I I trust in these little
[1:12:17] chopped up words we're got to realize we
[1:12:19] have no part with the devil we have no
[1:12:22] agreement we have no working
[1:12:24] relationship we know you know we have no
[1:12:27] whatever you want to Define it in any
[1:12:28] other way we don't have no part with him
[1:12:31] there's nothing that we have to do with
[1:12:33] the devil only to cast him out kick him
[1:12:35] out wherever you find him that's the
[1:12:36] only dealing we have with him so we need
[1:12:40] to realize when he when when he comes
[1:12:42] along and he tries to say no no no
[1:12:44] there's a part of me still in you you
[1:12:47] have to tell him devil the baptism of
[1:12:50] the Holy Ghost has burned you out of my
[1:12:52] life brother and says there was a snake
[1:12:54] either in our Spirit of our soul he use
[1:12:56] it two different ways but the Holy Ghost
[1:12:57] comes in and burns out that snake nature
[1:12:59] destroys that snake nature then the
[1:13:01] nature of the dove comes in and Christ
[1:13:02] lives himself out of the believer
[1:13:04] Hallelujah so you say well I'm just and
[1:13:08] I'll say it this way if that snake
[1:13:10] nature hasn't been burnt out you get it
[1:13:12] burnt out the Holy Ghost will burn him
[1:13:14] out our God is a consuming fire
[1:13:17] Hallelujah and and he'll burn it out of
[1:13:19] your life if you give it over to him but
[1:13:21] if you justify yourself just like the
[1:13:23] man who had the nervous condition there
[1:13:25] you know what if he just said no no I've
[1:13:26] just got a nervous condition see see
[1:13:29] look that you know his his wife or
[1:13:31] whoever that woman was in that quote no
[1:13:33] doubt she was praying for him because
[1:13:35] she didn't understand what was going on
[1:13:37] and the Lord revealed to her through the
[1:13:39] prophet actually it's a demon it's demon
[1:13:41] depression is causing that nervous
[1:13:43] condition but if he just took own of
[1:13:45] that and said you I mean I mean
[1:13:46] ownership of that said well my father
[1:13:48] was nervous and my mother was nervous
[1:13:50] and you know there's a family trade in
[1:13:51] that he would have kept it
[1:13:55] just because our parent you know we can
[1:13:57] see a family trait you know that's been
[1:13:58] passed down we don't have to live with
[1:14:00] that no that's not our inheritance our
[1:14:04] inheritance is the C nature of Christ in
[1:14:06] us hallelujah amen where we bear the
[1:14:10] image of the Heavenly not just the
[1:14:12] Earthly amen but the thing is if we just
[1:14:15] say well I was born this way I'll die
[1:14:17] this way this is just how I'm going to
[1:14:19] be well that's the devil saying we got
[1:14:21] something going
[1:14:22] on and we should keep this going cuz it
[1:14:24] work out real well for who for him not
[1:14:27] for you but if God comes in and takes
[1:14:29] rid of that you know gets rid of that
[1:14:31] thing because you want it gone and then
[1:14:33] the devil tries to come back and say no
[1:14:35] no hold on hold on
[1:14:37] devil we have we have no
[1:14:40] Fellowship you're following me I'm just
[1:14:42] maybe repeating myself but we need to
[1:14:43] realize
[1:14:45] actually the Fallen nature of man is not
[1:14:50] my
[1:14:51] portion it's not my portion it's not my
[1:14:53] family's portion it's not our portion is
[1:14:55] you know as a Christian it's not our
[1:14:57] portion they backbite they lie they
[1:14:59] cheat they steal they you know to every
[1:15:02] man for himself every dog you know dog
[1:15:04] eat dog kind of what can I get out of
[1:15:05] people use and abuse all those things
[1:15:07] that's the Fallen nature of man
[1:15:09] manipulate you know you know lies and
[1:15:12] slander and political Maneuvers to try
[1:15:14] and you know get one up over people
[1:15:16] that's Fallen man that's not the nature
[1:15:19] of Christ the nature of Christ is not
[1:15:21] what I can get but what can I give how
[1:15:24] can I empower someone else how can I
[1:15:25] edify the body how can I lift someone up
[1:15:28] how can I speak the truth in love how
[1:15:29] can I you know because God gives he
[1:15:32] pours himself out for others he poured
[1:15:34] himself out for me he poured himself out
[1:15:36] for you and I so it's not what I can get
[1:15:38] what can I give to others you're
[1:15:40] following me you know Lord there's no
[1:15:42] lies in him there's no malice in
[1:15:45] him there's no backstabbing in him
[1:15:49] there's no political agenda try and
[1:15:50] twist in you know character
[1:15:51] assassination or gossip that's not God
[1:15:55] that's the devil I mean there's no lies
[1:15:57] there's no slander there's no hatred
[1:15:59] There's No Malice there's no Strife
[1:16:01] there's just peace and joy and love and
[1:16:04] acceptance and forgiveness that's what's
[1:16:06] in God amen amen so shouldn't that be in
[1:16:09] us well if that stake nature is still
[1:16:12] wriggling around in your life it will
[1:16:15] be the negative side but if that's burnt
[1:16:18] out by the Holy Ghost you'll just see
[1:16:20] the Lord
[1:16:21] living Hallelujah so we have no part in
[1:16:24] the the devil you could have summ that
[1:16:26] up in that words well maybe I could have
[1:16:28] just said that for 45 minutes but we
[1:16:30] have no part in the devil you got to

[1:16:58] if we if our identity is in our past
[1:17:00] then our past will drag us back into it
