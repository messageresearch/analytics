[48:30] smile
[48:32] outside that's your business
[48:35] but in the house of god
[48:36] [Music]
[48:37] don't let the devil see you without a
[48:39] smile on your face
[48:41] because the moment you move out there it
[48:43] says this one here
[48:44] attack this one wasn't happy
[48:47] go for that one
[48:50] that's how the animal is in the jungle
[48:52] if a lion is looking
[48:55] they're looking at the head of buffalo
[48:58] right rambo
[48:59] the lions are hunting they are hungry
[49:02] they are looking for food
[49:04] so they are not just going to attack
[49:06] they look oh you can't attack that bull
[49:08] there he's too strong he'll kill you
[49:11] but which are the weak ones here
[49:13] oh those ones there
[49:15] so the others are going this way this
[49:17] one is just behind you know then they
[49:20] attack that one
[49:21] so in the house of god
[49:23] we are an army of god
[49:25] we smile all the time
[49:27] even when you don't have money in your
[49:29] pocket smile
[49:31] smile then the devil will think maybe
[49:33] he's got he's got a secret account we
[49:35] don't know about
[49:36] an overseas account somewhere that we
[49:39] don't know about why is he smiling i
[49:41] thought this guy doesn't have a job but
[49:44] he's smiling i think there's no food in
[49:46] the house why is he smiling
[49:48] so keep smiling
[49:50] keep smiling the house of god
[49:53] then the devil will say i don't know
[49:54] what to do with this one who might as
[49:56] well let him go so we don't believe in
[49:59] sad christians
[50:00] [Music]
[50:02] that one i don't know about
[50:04] i'm trying to figure that one out in the
[50:06] house of god we are happy
[50:09] we smile in the house of god
[50:11] why because jesus
[50:13] set us
[50:15] absolutely free
[50:17] sister when you are in the kitchen
[50:19] there is no food in the house the
[50:20] husband is not working

[55:18] have a power point there um
[55:22] i mean i want to
[55:24] here we go so let's just see if i can
[55:25] drive okay i can drive so we're gonna go
[55:27] first thessalonians 5 and 1. now this
[55:29] scripture is directly after first
[55:31] thessalonians 4 which is the the rapture
[55:35] scripture you know the lord himself
[55:36] shall descend with a shout the voice the
[55:38] archangel the trump of god
[55:39] and uh we know that when the apostle
[55:41] paul wrote the gospels or i mean the
[55:44] epistles rather he didn't put chapter
[55:46] and verse in
[55:47] so
[55:48] so first thessalonians 5 is a
[55:50] continuation of first thessalonians 4.
[55:53] right so
[55:55] so the apostle paul is saying here but
[55:56] of the times and seasons brethren you
[55:59] have no need that i write unto you for
[56:02] yourselves know perfectly that that day
[56:04] of the lord so cometh as a thief in the
[56:06] night so when they shall say peace and
[56:09] safety
[56:10] then sudden destruction cometh upon him
[56:13] as travail upon a woman with child and
[56:15] they shall not escape but ye brethren
[56:18] are not in darkness
[56:21] he's talking about you
[56:22] right that that day should overtake you
[56:25] as a thief
[56:26] ye are all the children of light and the
[56:29] children of the day yeah not of the
[56:32] night nor of darkness amen therefore let
[56:36] us not sleep as do others but let us
[56:38] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[56:41] sleep in the night and they that be
[56:43] drunken are drunken in the night but let
[56:45] us who are of the day
[56:47] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[56:49] faith and love and for at helmet the
[56:51] hope of salvation for god hath not
[56:54] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[56:56] salvation by our lord jesus christ
[57:00] amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[57:02] prayer this morning if you have a knee
[57:03] just want to raise your hands to the
[57:04] lord
[57:05] amen gracious heavenly father once again
[57:08] we just want to praise your mighty name
[57:10] lord we can truly sing with such a
[57:12] thanksgiving our hearts jesus has set me
[57:14] absolutely free lord we want to thank
[57:17] you for that dear god thank you that we
[57:18] have a real liberty in you lord jesus
[57:21] there's no sin nothing that the devil
[57:22] can tack upon us because your blood has
[57:24] loosed us from all those things
[57:26] father we praise your mighty name dear
[57:28] god i just want to ask lord as we have
[57:30] read your word your sacred holy word i
[57:32] pray you'd anoint it dear god to speaker
[57:34] and hear our lord may you just come and
[57:36] live among us oh god lord may yours may
[57:39] the spirit of revelation which you are
[57:40] lord illuminate our souls lord may you
[57:43] raise our faith oh god lord may you cast
[57:45] down every evil imagination lord every
[57:47] work of darkness father we thank you
[57:50] lord that they do not belong to us but
[57:51] there but they belong to the devil so by
[57:53] the blood of jesus christ we send back
[57:55] his works and all of his unbelief back
[57:57] to him in the name of jesus christ and
[57:59] father i pray lord you just lord just
[58:01] encourage us along the way father may
[58:03] our hearts burn within us lord may we
[58:05] walk out of these doors change and
[58:06] renewed and transformed made more like
[58:09] you grant it for your glory we ask in
[58:11] jesus christ's name amen
[58:14] amen god bless you friends you may have
[58:15] your seats this morning um
[58:18] so
[58:19] i want to actually talk about the seal
[58:20] of god and the mark of the beast today
[58:23] because i've received a lot of videos
[58:26] and emails and people asking questions
[58:28] is it the vaccine what is it that all
[58:30] these questions and and it's it's family
[58:33] not family believer not believer so you
[58:35] know there's a lot of
[58:37] there's a lot of voices in this end time
[58:39] but we received a vindicated message in
[58:42] this end time through a vindicated
[58:44] prophet god over vindicated his ministry
[58:47] amen the son of man was revealed and so
[58:49] we've heard the voice of god in this day
[58:52] and so it really uh you know it behooves
[58:54] us to stay in line with the word of god
[58:57] i mean so we've read here that you know
[58:59] we are not the children of darkness
[59:01] right we're not the children of darkness
[59:02] it's very dark in the world
[59:04] but in the bride it's very light right
[59:07] it's very light we're living in a very
[59:08] bright place
[59:09] hallelujah our spiritual condition is
[59:11] very bright i mean so we are not wait
[59:14] did i do that no here we go you know so
[59:17] so this day with the you know
[59:19] so the translation of the dead and
[59:21] living saints to be with the lord is not
[59:23] going to overtake the bride as a thief
[59:25] in the night the lord will come as like
[59:26] a thief in the night but it's not going
[59:28] to come and pass us by and we're going
[59:29] to miss it right if you have the seal of
[59:31] god
[59:32] hallelujah you should be the most
[59:34] happiest person in all the world
[59:36] irrespective of your of of of trials
[59:40] struggles questions hardship financial
[59:42] spiritual whatever it may be that's
[59:44] going on mind battles whatever it is if
[59:46] you're really sealed in by the baptism
[59:48] the holy ghost that you just make you
[59:49] shout
[59:50] i'm irrespective of what's going on in
[59:52] here what's going on around you family
[59:55] work whatever it may be amen we can
[59:57] rejoice because we've been sealed in
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:01] hallelujah so we are not the children of
[1:00:03] darkness i mean they either are
[1:00:05] you know in the night they're drunk and
[1:00:07] they sleep you know this world is drunk
[1:00:09] it's staggering it's staggering to and
[1:00:11] fro opinion and things going on spirits
[1:00:13] moving and everything that's happening
[1:00:15] in the world today is god fulfilling his
[1:00:18] word and we may see it as very natural
[1:00:20] things but it's god fulfilling his word
[1:00:22] you know it's the same when you know you
[1:00:25] think naturally how unfair it was for
[1:00:27] joseph to have to take mary she's about
[1:00:29] to give birth to jesus but because of a
[1:00:31] decree of a of a of an ungodly emperor
[1:00:34] that everyone had to return to the place
[1:00:35] without born to be taxed i mean he had
[1:00:38] to put mary on the on on the donkey and
[1:00:40] had to take her to bethlehem
[1:00:42] now naturally you think that's just the
[1:00:44] oppressive government and everything's
[1:00:45] going wrong no it's not it's god
[1:00:47] fulfilling his word i mean because he
[1:00:49] had to be born in bethlehem right he was
[1:00:52] going to be born in nazareth but the
[1:00:54] scripture could not be broken so god
[1:00:56] allowed that to happen for her for them
[1:00:58] to move to bethlehem for jesus to be
[1:01:01] born to fulfill scripture see everything
[1:01:02] we see around us is fulfillment of
[1:01:04] scripture but if you see it through the
[1:01:06] eyes of our absolute
[1:01:08] right you will see it for what it is but
[1:01:10] if you see it through human
[1:01:11] understanding well you just be
[1:01:13] staggering around
[1:01:14] but we are not drunk like the world
[1:01:18] hallelujah we are spiritually sober and
[1:01:21] alert
[1:01:22] and we have a clear head
[1:01:24] hallelujah for god has not appointed us
[1:01:26] to wrath i like to say god has not
[1:01:27] appointed me to wrath make it personal
[1:01:29] now but to obtain salvation by our lord
[1:01:32] jesus christ
[1:01:33] hallelujah now a couple of uh sundays
[1:01:35] ago i was i was preaching and then part
[1:01:37] of it was from the script from the
[1:01:39] message modern events are made clear by
[1:01:41] prophecy and uh part of that where
[1:01:44] brother braham goes and he speaks about
[1:01:46] micah standing before king ahab king
[1:01:48] jehoshaphat before they go to the battle
[1:01:50] and now the thing is so so here's here's
[1:01:53] micro in this picture i just thought for
[1:01:55] the children you know picture tells a
[1:01:56] thousand words you know and so so here
[1:01:59] is here is zedekiah who's the head of
[1:02:00] the ministerial association remember
[1:02:02] those 400 hebrew prophets were
[1:02:04] prophesying that that ahab and
[1:02:07] jehoshaphat should go and fight take
[1:02:09] ramath gilead they're all enthused
[1:02:10] they're all excited i mean the head of
[1:02:12] the ministerial association the head of
[1:02:14] the council of churches made some iron
[1:02:16] horns and you said by this you'll push
[1:02:17] out the syrians you'll take the land and
[1:02:20] you know jehoshaphat here he's thinking
[1:02:22] because he's a godly king he's thinking
[1:02:24] but but ahab do you not have one more
[1:02:26] prophet you know you think 400 is enough
[1:02:28] but 401 seems to be better because
[1:02:30] there's enough of god in him to say well
[1:02:32] you know the scripture says something
[1:02:34] but you're saying something else and
[1:02:36] how's this all working out and and then
[1:02:38] so michael here he wasn't part of the
[1:02:40] council he wasn't in this denominational
[1:02:42] grouping here and you know they went and
[1:02:44] got him and you know ahab didn't want to
[1:02:46] get him to begin with because he said
[1:02:47] well there's one other but he hates me
[1:02:48] he prophesies against me and but how
[1:02:51] could he say anything but because he had
[1:02:53] received a vindicated amen prophecy from
[1:02:56] elijah that ahab was going to die
[1:02:58] jezebel was going to die and so all the
[1:03:00] events had to fulfill that everything
[1:03:03] had to come together for the fulfillment
[1:03:05] of his destruction
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:08] so so he you know he was told before he
[1:03:11] came to this great big meeting say what
[1:03:13] everyone else is saying we're having a
[1:03:14] great you know great great convention
[1:03:16] everyone's shouting and enthused and
[1:03:17] yeah we really feel the anointing yeah
[1:03:19] they are anointed but it was by a lying
[1:03:21] spirit but because they didn't take the
[1:03:23] inspiration back into the scripture i
[1:03:25] mean the devil could just have his free
[1:03:27] reign
[1:03:28] and then so he came before the king and
[1:03:30] he said yo go up you're the lord's with
[1:03:31] you and he was being a bit sarcastic
[1:03:33] about it because the king said didn't he
[1:03:35] say didn't i tell you why he's
[1:03:36] prophesized you're evil against me and
[1:03:38] he said you know i saw israel scattered
[1:03:41] like sheep without a shepherd you know
[1:03:42] and then zedekiah got you know gets all
[1:03:45] offended so when did the spirit of god
[1:03:46] leave me and go to you you know slaps
[1:03:48] him in the face and you know and then
[1:03:50] and then and then makai yeah micah says
[1:03:52] you know i i was praying about this last
[1:03:55] night and i saw a vision of heaven
[1:03:57] and there was a god was having a meeting
[1:03:59] up in heaven saying what could how can i
[1:04:01] get ahab to fall in battle to fulfill
[1:04:04] the words of elijah my prophet
[1:04:06] hallelujah and then a lying spirit came
[1:04:08] up from hell and said i'll get into
[1:04:10] those prophets because they're not
[1:04:11] standing on my word they're standing on
[1:04:13] public opinion they're standing on
[1:04:15] social trends and what's trending in
[1:04:16] social media and different opinions and
[1:04:18] you know videos and stuff i'll get into
[1:04:21] them and i'll make him fulfill
[1:04:22] the words of elijah
[1:04:25] if you go read this go read the story
[1:04:28] it's actually ahab has the idea to take
[1:04:30] remote gilead so he brings himself to
[1:04:33] his own destruction
[1:04:34] man always destroys himself this is very
[1:04:37] important principle
[1:04:38] i mean but but mikey here
[1:04:40] he couldn't say anything about what the
[1:04:42] scripture said and this is and to me
[1:04:44] brother brahma is saying this is this is
[1:04:46] the believer in the end time this is the
[1:04:48] bride of christ in the end time she will
[1:04:50] stay with us saith the lord
[1:04:52] she won't move from that thus saith the
[1:04:54] lord it doesn't matter you know i've had
[1:04:56] i had an email from a brother in india
[1:04:57] and he sent me this
[1:04:59] big long email some other people wrote
[1:05:00] meant to be believers and they take
[1:05:03] quotes
[1:05:04] and they and they by conjecture they
[1:05:06] string them together and they say look
[1:05:08] brother brahm said the vaccine's the
[1:05:09] mark of the beast he doesn't say it at
[1:05:11] all but it's by conjecture you know
[1:05:13] people take things and they try and
[1:05:15] extrapolate it's oh it must be in this
[1:05:17] and this is going to happen but it's not
[1:05:18] even in the word it's not even in the
[1:05:20] message and if they were only spiritual
[1:05:22] minded they say no no this is a lying
[1:05:24] spirit
[1:05:25] this is to get people's attention off
[1:05:27] really what's important and what is
[1:05:29] important in this hour is the going home
[1:05:31] of the bride
[1:05:32] that is the next big event on the
[1:05:34] calendar is us the dead in christ rising
[1:05:37] you know there's going to be a time when
[1:05:38] the dead in christ going to walk through
[1:05:39] these doors or they'll walk into your
[1:05:40] house hallelujah you may be driving in
[1:05:42] the car they'll sit in the passenger
[1:05:44] seat next you start talking to you holly
[1:05:46] and you'll realize who they are amen
[1:05:48] hallelujah you know there's going to be
[1:05:50] about 40 days where we're going to
[1:05:51] gather what kind of church services will
[1:05:53] be like that hallelujah when the dead
[1:05:55] and christ are rising and we're shouting
[1:05:57] and rejoicing because we're knowing
[1:05:59] we're going to
[1:06:00] hallelujah we've actually amen all the
[1:06:02] trials of life are over cause
[1:06:05] it's done
[1:06:06] it could be this morning
[1:06:08] why not amen it's in an hour that the
[1:06:10] world doesn't look for
[1:06:12] he steps in and takes her away
[1:06:14] holly but we're looking for that hour
[1:06:16] away because we're being sealed by the
[1:06:18] spirit of god i mean there's an
[1:06:19] expectation in our souls come quickly
[1:06:22] lord
[1:06:23] hallelujah
[1:06:24] amen so i want to be a micah
[1:06:27] i want to stick with a vindicated
[1:06:29] message
[1:06:30] hallelujah that's what we've got to do
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] now brother ram says here here we are in
[1:06:36] time red light down flashing coming of
[1:06:39] the lord is at hand yes sir listen
[1:06:41] entire message should meet end time
[1:06:43] conditions where where where they've got
[1:06:45] off
[1:06:46] where they've got off i haven't got off
[1:06:48] i've stayed on
[1:06:49] right i've stayed on with the word some
[1:06:51] people get off i'm not getting off this
[1:06:53] boat
[1:06:54] hallelujah the message ought to bring it
[1:06:56] back always end time message meets end
[1:06:58] time conditions so the end time message
[1:07:01] meets to 2021
[1:07:03] right brother brown knew exactly what he
[1:07:04] was saying it didn't you know he didn't
[1:07:07] re you know
[1:07:08] he knew exactly what we'd be facing
[1:07:10] today
[1:07:11] right end time message meets end time
[1:07:14] always it meets end time conditions
[1:07:17] right so the word of god we have
[1:07:18] received meets the condition of the end
[1:07:20] time
[1:07:22] amen now he says in the last days what's
[1:07:24] going to take to stand as a scriptural
[1:07:26] trained church on the line
[1:07:29] that's what we need to be a scripturally
[1:07:32] trained church because if we're
[1:07:33] scripturally trained we won't get off
[1:07:35] the line
[1:07:36] right we won't get caught up in every
[1:07:38] wind of doctrine and conjecture of man
[1:07:41] right and so that's why if we can see
[1:07:43] what the mark of the beast is in the
[1:07:44] scripture
[1:07:46] right then we won't be deceived by
[1:07:48] anything that's going on
[1:07:50] right for there's going to be carnal
[1:07:52] impersonations rise the bible said as
[1:07:54] janice and james generous withstood
[1:07:55] moses
[1:07:56] so will these men have reprobate mind
[1:07:58] concerning the truth and jesus was the
[1:08:00] truth thy word is the truth because in
[1:08:02] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:08:04] was with god and the word was made flesh
[1:08:06] and dwelt among us and the word of god
[1:08:08] is more powerful than a two-edged sword
[1:08:10] cutting to asunder of the bone and a
[1:08:12] discern of the thoughts of the heart we
[1:08:13] realize that we're in that day to where
[1:08:16] anything can look so real but yet if
[1:08:18] it's off the scripture leave it alone it
[1:08:20] could look so real why do you think
[1:08:22] people fall for things because it looks
[1:08:24] so real but if it's off the scripture
[1:08:26] leave it alone
[1:08:28] right so it can look so real but leave
[1:08:29] it alone no matter what kind of a
[1:08:31] sensation what results you find out of
[1:08:33] it if it isn't scripture stay away from
[1:08:36] it stay right with the word yeah
[1:08:40] amen amen
[1:08:42] now
[1:08:43] here we have in genesis 4
[1:08:45] we have the first account
[1:08:48] of the mark of the beast
[1:08:50] because the mark of the beast has been
[1:08:52] here since time began
[1:08:54] it's always been here it's a spiritual
[1:08:56] mark right people say oh there's going
[1:08:58] to be a physical
[1:08:59] mark as well no
[1:09:02] it's already manifesting
[1:09:04] i'll show you what it is it's not a
[1:09:06] tattoo it's not a microchip it's not a
[1:09:08] vaccine it's already here and the
[1:09:10] physical manifestation is already here
[1:09:12] brother brahmary told us what the
[1:09:13] physical manifestation is
[1:09:15] okay so genesis 4 and 1 and adam knew
[1:09:18] his wife
[1:09:21] and she conceived and bear cane and said
[1:09:23] i have gotten a man from the lord and
[1:09:24] she again bear his brother abel and abel
[1:09:27] was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a
[1:09:29] tiller of the ground and in process of
[1:09:30] time it came to pass it came brought of
[1:09:32] the fruit of the grounded offering unto
[1:09:34] the lord
[1:09:36] and abel he also brought her the first
[1:09:38] things of his flock and of the fat
[1:09:39] thereof and the lord had respect under
[1:09:42] abel and to his offering but unto cain
[1:09:44] and to his offering he had not respect
[1:09:46] and cain was very roth and his
[1:09:48] countenance fell so here's the first
[1:09:50] worship that's recorded in scripture
[1:09:52] they're both believers cain was not an
[1:09:54] unbeliever he was a real believer he
[1:09:56] knew you know he knew that there was a
[1:09:58] fall he knew that there was a gulf
[1:10:00] between god and man he knew there was a
[1:10:02] sacrifice that needed to be given but we
[1:10:04] know that it was by intellectual
[1:10:06] understanding he he presented fruit but
[1:10:09] but but abel by revelation knew it was
[1:10:11] blood
[1:10:13] so they're both they're both religious
[1:10:15] they're both worshiping one is accepted
[1:10:18] and one is rejected and cain was mad
[1:10:21] about it
[1:10:23] what did we read that last and the lord
[1:10:25] said unto cain why art thou wrath and
[1:10:27] why is thou countenance fallen
[1:10:29] if thou doest well thou shalt thou not
[1:10:31] be accepted and if thou doest not well
[1:10:34] sin lies at the door and unto thee shall
[1:10:36] be his desire and thou shall rule over
[1:10:38] him and cain so he said just do like
[1:10:41] your your brother did and you'll be
[1:10:42] accepted you saw your brother was
[1:10:44] accepted just do what he did and you'll
[1:10:46] be accepted
[1:10:47] but now and cain talked with us talked
[1:10:50] with abel his brother and it came to
[1:10:52] pass that when they were in the field
[1:10:53] that cain rose up against abel his
[1:10:55] brother and slew him
[1:10:56] so god god presented the truth
[1:11:00] to cain
[1:11:01] and cain rejected it
[1:11:03] and in that rejection he murdered the
[1:11:05] true believer
[1:11:06] and we know on this day murder is not
[1:11:08] just physical murder you can kill
[1:11:10] someone's um you know you can kill them
[1:11:12] by by slander lies malice whatever it
[1:11:14] may be false you can murder someone's
[1:11:16] reputation that was the word i was
[1:11:17] looking for i mean so
[1:11:20] and the lord said unto cain where's abel
[1:11:21] thy brother and he said i know not am i
[1:11:24] my brother's keeper and he said what
[1:11:25] hast thou done the voice of thy
[1:11:27] brother's blood crieth unto me from the
[1:11:29] ground and now thou art cursed from the
[1:11:31] earth which hath opened her mouth to
[1:11:33] receive thy brother's blood from thy
[1:11:34] hand when thou tilt us to ground it
[1:11:36] shall not henceforth yield unto her unto
[1:11:39] thee her strength a fugitive and a
[1:11:41] vagabond shall there be in the earth and
[1:11:43] cain said unto the lord my punishment is
[1:11:45] greater than i can bear behold thou has
[1:11:47] driven me out this day from the face of
[1:11:49] the earth and from my face shall i be
[1:11:50] hid and i shall be a fugitive and a
[1:11:53] vagabond in the earth and it shall come
[1:11:54] to pass that everyone that findeth me
[1:11:56] shall slay me and the lord said unto him
[1:11:59] therefore whosoever slayeth cain
[1:12:01] vengeance shall be taken on him
[1:12:03] sevenfold and the lord said a mark upon
[1:12:05] cain lest any finding him should kill
[1:12:07] him and cain went out from the presence
[1:12:10] of the lord and dwelt in the land of not
[1:12:12] on the east of eden
[1:12:14] so here's the here's the process
[1:12:17] truth is presented
[1:12:19] but then truth is rejected
[1:12:21] and then
[1:12:23] and then what happens is cain is marked
[1:12:25] by god and then he leaves the presence
[1:12:28] of god
[1:12:29] and this is the effect of the mark of
[1:12:31] the beast
[1:12:32] truth is turned down for the last time
[1:12:35] murder takes place of the true believer
[1:12:38] right then god marks the person and the
[1:12:41] evidence of him being marked as they go
[1:12:42] out of the presence of the lord they can
[1:12:45] be religious cain's line was very
[1:12:46] religious
[1:12:48] but this is the first time when
[1:12:50] someone's marked and left out
[1:12:52] we're now the prince of god because they
[1:12:54] turned down the truth
[1:12:56] this is the pattern
[1:12:58] right
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:06] now
[1:13:06] if we jump all the way back to
[1:13:08] revelations 13 well all the way forward
[1:13:10] to revelations 13
[1:13:11] it says and he causeth all both small
[1:13:14] and great rich and poor free and bond to
[1:13:16] receive a mark on their right hand or in
[1:13:18] their foreheads that no man might buy or
[1:13:20] sell save he that had the mark or the
[1:13:22] name of the beast or the number of his
[1:13:23] name here is wisdom let him that hath
[1:13:26] understanding count the number of the
[1:13:27] beast for it is the number of a man and
[1:13:29] his number is 603 score and 6. now
[1:13:32] if we go back to here to kane cain was
[1:13:35] not willing to surrender to the word
[1:13:38] right so it's an apostate mark
[1:13:40] right it's those who are not willing to
[1:13:42] subject themselves to the word of god
[1:13:44] receive the mark of the beast there's
[1:13:46] only two groups brother braham says in
[1:13:47] the end time those that have the seal of
[1:13:49] god and those that have the mark of the
[1:13:50] beast
[1:13:51] two groups
[1:13:52] right so cain was not willing to
[1:13:55] surrender himself to the word because
[1:13:56] the lord himself spoke to him
[1:13:58] just do like your brother did you'll be
[1:14:00] accepted it's not hard
[1:14:02] you don't even really need to understand
[1:14:03] what you're doing just take me at my
[1:14:04] word you saw what happened with abel he
[1:14:07] was accepted you ought to be accepted do
[1:14:08] what he did but he wasn't willing to
[1:14:10] surrender himself to the word
[1:14:12] so it's in a mark of apostasy
[1:14:16] and so now
[1:14:17] this word beast here
[1:14:19] in that's that's used here in
[1:14:21] revelations this is the strong
[1:14:23] concordance it means a dangerous animal
[1:14:25] a venomous
[1:14:26] wild beast so it's something that is
[1:14:29] untameable something's wild
[1:14:31] and it's actually a manifestation
[1:14:34] right what you see people that's why i
[1:14:35] say well there's got to be a physical
[1:14:37] uh mark
[1:14:39] well you see how people are and you'll
[1:14:41] see a physical manifestation of a mark
[1:14:44] untameable to the scripture untamable to
[1:14:46] the word religious as you're following
[1:14:49] me religious as can be but actually
[1:14:51] their life is manifesting if they've
[1:14:53] been marked or seek because we're
[1:14:55] reflecting either one
[1:14:57] and you either take one or the other you
[1:14:59] can't have both you can't have the seal
[1:15:01] of god then take the mark of the beast
[1:15:03] and you can't have the mark of the beast
[1:15:04] and take the seal of god
[1:15:06] right we all want the seal of god
[1:15:08] amen so it's something that's untamable
[1:15:11] untenable to what the word
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:17] he says don't you see now we know the
[1:15:19] devil's religious right that was his
[1:15:21] ambition in isaiah says i'll be like the
[1:15:23] i'll be like the most high i want to
[1:15:25] exalt myself by the stars of god yeah
[1:15:27] i'm going to be like the most high what
[1:15:29] is the most high he's god he's an object
[1:15:31] of worship satan wanted to be an object
[1:15:33] of worship too and in this evil age he
[1:15:35] is
[1:15:36] he says don't you see how religious the
[1:15:37] devil is the the devil is not he's not
[1:15:40] anti great big thing like communism all
[1:15:42] against christianity that's not oh well
[1:15:44] sure i mean uh that's of oh well of the
[1:15:47] devil's sure but it's not the antichrist
[1:15:49] so communism is against god sure it's
[1:15:51] the devil doing but it's not it's not
[1:15:53] the antichrist
[1:15:55] right the antichrist is very religious
[1:15:57] very religious it was a religious spirit
[1:15:59] that crucified jesus it wasn't the
[1:16:01] prostitute it wasn't the drunkard it
[1:16:04] wasn't the indifferent it was the
[1:16:06] religious spirits that crucified our
[1:16:08] lord see it's it was a very it was a
[1:16:10] religious spirit that crucified jesus
[1:16:12] it's always been a religious world a
[1:16:14] religious people that crucifies it's the
[1:16:16] religious people that was against the
[1:16:18] true christ it was the religious
[1:16:20] prophets that was against micaiah it's
[1:16:22] the religious people of the day that's
[1:16:24] against the message of god
[1:16:28] and there are and and so this is going
[1:16:30] back to revelation 13 and this is the
[1:16:33] greek word then the strongs and and and
[1:16:36] therion is wild untamed savages in other
[1:16:38] words if you watch the 11th chapter the
[1:16:40] beast of rome the uh the 13th chapter
[1:16:43] the the united states the 17th chapter
[1:16:46] both united states and rome of the
[1:16:49] denominational churches cons cons
[1:16:52] consolidated thank you
[1:16:54] with catholicism makes them an
[1:16:56] unconverted untamed to the gospel
[1:16:59] he says untamed bless god we come from
[1:17:02] the big methodist church the baptist the
[1:17:04] presbyterian the pentecostal
[1:17:05] denominations we know what we're talking
[1:17:07] about nobody leads is going to tell us
[1:17:10] no one's going to tell us they always
[1:17:11] say we're not led by a man we're not
[1:17:13] following a man i'm not following a man
[1:17:15] either well actually i am the man christ
[1:17:17] jesus his word
[1:17:19] right brother ram says that the bride is
[1:17:21] following jesus christ the word
[1:17:24] i remember they say on no one's no man's
[1:17:26] leading us and they have their councils
[1:17:28] they have their assemblies they have
[1:17:29] their bishop they have their pope they
[1:17:30] have their presbyter they have the one
[1:17:32] they have their headquarters and they
[1:17:34] say they're not following anyone
[1:17:36] uh no they are
[1:17:38] right
[1:17:39] but it's so it makes an unconverted
[1:17:42] untamed to the gospel untamed bless god
[1:17:44] we come from the big methodist church
[1:17:46] the baptist of presbyterian the
[1:17:47] pentecostal denomination we know what
[1:17:50] we're what we're talking nobody leads is
[1:17:52] going to tell us there you are untamed
[1:17:54] unconverted without natural affection
[1:17:56] truth breakers false accusers
[1:17:58] incontinent and despisers of those that
[1:18:00] are good
[1:18:01] what is that that's a physical
[1:18:02] manifestation of the mark of the beast
[1:18:06] not a microchip
[1:18:08] not a tattoo
[1:18:09] not a vaccine vaccine it is a spiritual
[1:18:12] mark
[1:18:14] are we all together
[1:18:17] you say what about the people there's
[1:18:18] good people in there i pray they come
[1:18:20] out there's been a cry in this end time
[1:18:22] come out of her my people which is not
[1:18:24] just catholicism it's all of
[1:18:25] denomination because she is the mother
[1:18:27] of harlots why does she birth harlot
[1:18:29] denominational systems
[1:18:31] so it's not just it's not just
[1:18:33] catholicism it's all of organized
[1:18:34] christianity you know when i first read
[1:18:37] the church age book i thought why is
[1:18:38] brother bram so against organized
[1:18:40] religion because i thought that's the
[1:18:41] only one there is and the reason is it's
[1:18:43] man controlled it's demon inspired why
[1:18:46] because it holds people back from the
[1:18:48] full word of god that holds them back
[1:18:50] from a true walks brother brahm said one
[1:18:53] thing that i want to see established and
[1:18:55] i'll be satisfied this is what he wanted
[1:18:57] a true spiritual relationship between
[1:18:59] god and man he did not say a true
[1:19:01] spiritual relationship between me god
[1:19:03] and people as me's in between no he
[1:19:05] wanted a true spiritual relationship
[1:19:06] between god and man that's what he
[1:19:08] wanted to see established and this is
[1:19:10] what this church stands for as this is
[1:19:12] what i want to see is a true spiritual
[1:19:14] relationship between god and man that
[1:19:16] none of us serve god through someone
[1:19:18] else
[1:19:19] we don't serve god because of our
[1:19:20] parents we don't serve god through our
[1:19:22] parents or our brother our sister
[1:19:24] through the preacher through the past
[1:19:25] that god forbid i mean but we serve god
[1:19:27] because it's us and him walking together
[1:19:30] amen that's how it's got to be
[1:19:35] so amen
[1:19:37] untamed to the gospel
[1:19:41] so when you see people who are not
[1:19:42] willing
[1:19:43] now it could be them under conviction
[1:19:45] whatever but you know we can't put
[1:19:46] people in a box but to me this is the
[1:19:48] manifestation of the mark of the beast
[1:19:50] they will keep their church their church
[1:19:52] says i stick with my church that's it
[1:19:57] now in
[1:19:59] exodus 21 now these are the judgments
[1:20:01] which thou shall set before them if thou
[1:20:04] by a hebrew servant six years he shall
[1:20:06] serve and in the seventh he shall go out
[1:20:09] free for nothing
[1:20:10] and if he come in by himself he shall go
[1:20:12] out by himself if he were married then
[1:20:14] his wife shall go out with him if his
[1:20:16] master has given him a wife and she has
[1:20:18] borne him sons or daughters the wife and
[1:20:20] the children shall be her masters and he
[1:20:22] shall go out by himself and if the
[1:20:24] servant shall plainly say i love my
[1:20:26] master
[1:20:28] my wife my children i will no go um i
[1:20:30] will not go out free then his master
[1:20:32] shall bring him into unto the judges and
[1:20:35] he shall also bring him to the door or
[1:20:37] unto the doorpost and his master shall
[1:20:40] bore his air through with an all and he
[1:20:42] shall serve him forever
[1:20:45] so there's a every sin you know the
[1:20:46] jubilee year
[1:20:48] and and and this slave hebrew slave
[1:20:50] could decide i'm going to go free
[1:20:52] and if they're if they decide to go free
[1:20:54] they could go free but if they decided
[1:20:56] no i love my master
[1:20:58] you know i'm not you know
[1:21:00] i want to stay like this then they were
[1:21:02] born through with an all through the air
[1:21:04] and that signified they could never go
[1:21:06] free and what does the air signify
[1:21:08] hearing
[1:21:09] so they could it didn't matter how long
[1:21:10] they lived after this they could never
[1:21:12] go through they could hear the jubilee
[1:21:14] trumpet they could hear it time and time
[1:21:16] again but because they are bored through
[1:21:18] with with an all through the air they
[1:21:19] could never ever go free was that
[1:21:21] there's a mark of the beast they can't
[1:21:22] hear the gospel no more thus they
[1:21:24] exactly in the same condition they're in
[1:21:27] lord help this world
[1:21:31] and then it's the same thing there but
[1:21:33] we know that in in
[1:21:34] ezekiel
[1:21:37] uh in ezekiel 9 there's the seal of god
[1:21:40] is shown as a mark as well i don't have
[1:21:42] it on here but
[1:21:44] before the great slaughtering in
[1:21:45] jerusalem would happen he says that a
[1:21:47] young angel with an incorn would go
[1:21:48] through the city and and and mark those
[1:21:51] who would sigh and cry for the
[1:21:52] abominations done in the city and that
[1:21:54] yeah the prophet says we should sign cry
[1:21:56] for the abomination has done all the sin
[1:21:58] and everything that's done but at the
[1:21:59] same time we should have such joy
[1:22:01] and praise god so much hallelujah
[1:22:03] because he set us absolutely free
[1:22:06] amen so there's a marking as well
[1:22:09] amen by by the holy ghost himself
[1:22:14] and we're living in an hour
[1:22:16] where there's not going to be
[1:22:18] destruction of a city but a world
[1:22:21] right a great tribulation is coming
[1:22:23] brother am said that the world war ii
[1:22:24] was an amateur tribulation
[1:22:26] and you go and look at what happened
[1:22:29] you just go look in europe you know
[1:22:31] go look
[1:22:33] just go look around the world where that
[1:22:34] conflict happened
[1:22:36] i don't want to be stuck here when
[1:22:37] that's going on and that's amateur
[1:22:40] that's just amateur what about when it's
[1:22:41] for real life
[1:22:44] if i can put it that way
[1:22:46] but god has given us the ability to
[1:22:48] receive the seal of god the holy ghost
[1:22:50] that we don't have to go there
[1:22:53] hallelujah i'm so glad about that
[1:22:56] hallelujah
[1:22:58] now
[1:22:59] some and so
[1:23:01] what what does allow me about all these
[1:23:03] things is people say
[1:23:05] you know that that the vaccine is a step
[1:23:07] towards the mark of the beast so i'm
[1:23:08] showing you from the scripture we want
[1:23:10] to be scriptural trained
[1:23:11] that is not a step and it's not it
[1:23:14] right the step is this
[1:23:17] and now we know what withholders that he
[1:23:19] might be revealed in his time for the
[1:23:21] mystery of iniquity to authority work
[1:23:23] only he who now letteth will let till he
[1:23:25] be taken out of the way so the mystery
[1:23:27] of iniquity is working but he who now
[1:23:29] letteth will let that's the holy ghost
[1:23:30] is actually keeping keeping things down
[1:23:33] i mean just like the anointing the
[1:23:34] mighty angel descends puts his foot on
[1:23:36] the land and the sea his pillars of fire
[1:23:38] keeps keeps the powers of darkness down
[1:23:41] why until the bride is gathered to
[1:23:43] himself and then when he lifts off i
[1:23:45] mean when the when the holy ghost leaves
[1:23:46] the gentiles we're going with because
[1:23:48] we're part of him we're part of the word
[1:23:50] right so that's when hell will be fully
[1:23:52] we know hell's unleashed but that's
[1:23:53] supposed to be totally unleashed
[1:23:55] now don't despair in these things
[1:23:57] because we have a way of escape and we
[1:23:59] have something to give people we have
[1:24:01] the true living god that we can give
[1:24:03] people that's why i should pray god give
[1:24:05] us wisdom help us lord that we could
[1:24:07] speak a word in season amen that
[1:24:09] people's hearts would be soft and you
[1:24:11] would be sensitive that we could just
[1:24:12] just even a phrase
[1:24:14] amen you know we want everyone to come
[1:24:17] in
[1:24:18] i don't want to see you anyone left
[1:24:20] behind
[1:24:21] even your worst enemy would you like
[1:24:23] your worst enemy stuck here
[1:24:25] if you do there's something wrong with
[1:24:26] you you need to come here and pray
[1:24:28] amen now
[1:24:31] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[1:24:32] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:24:34] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:24:35] with the brightness of his coming even
[1:24:37] him whose coming is after the working of
[1:24:39] satan with all power and signs and lying
[1:24:41] wonders and with all deceive
[1:24:43] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:24:45] them that perish because they received
[1:24:48] not the love of the truth see this is
[1:24:50] actually this is this is actually the
[1:24:52] stepping stone to be
[1:24:53] marked with the mark of the beast is
[1:24:55] because people do not receive a love of
[1:24:57] the truth it doesn't say they don't
[1:24:59] receive pardon me the truth they don't
[1:25:01] receive a love for it
[1:25:03] that's why
[1:25:04] it's got to be in our hearts may we love
[1:25:06] the truth
[1:25:08] may we love this word may we love him
[1:25:10] because he is the way the truth it
[1:25:12] doesn't say a truth the truth the truth
[1:25:14] is jesus christ the resurrected lord of
[1:25:17] glory
[1:25:18] so it's not they didn't receive i i
[1:25:20] received him as my personal savior but
[1:25:22] did they receive a love for the truth
[1:25:23] because if they really did that i'd go
[1:25:25] all the way into the baptism of the holy
[1:25:26] ghost
[1:25:27] that they might be saved
[1:25:30] and for this cause god shall send them
[1:25:31] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:25:33] a lie and that they all might be damned
[1:25:36] who believe not the truth but have
[1:25:37] pleasure in unrighteousness this is the
[1:25:39] apostle paul
[1:25:41] this is speaking of today
[1:25:43] we want to receive a love for the truth
[1:25:46] and we don't want to be a stumbling
[1:25:47] block to others
[1:25:49] we want to be salty
[1:25:51] amen but you see because they don't
[1:25:52] receive a love for the truth
[1:25:54] then god sends a strong delusion that
[1:25:56] they should believe a lie so what
[1:25:58] happens people rarely begin to rally
[1:26:00] around the wrong thing
[1:26:02] there is one thing to write there's one
[1:26:04] person to rally around
[1:26:06] it's not biden it's not trump it's not
[1:26:08] vaccines or no vaccine it's not
[1:26:11] conspiracy theory it's not youtube it's
[1:26:13] not instagram it's not tick-tock it's
[1:26:15] not facebook it's not your phone it's
[1:26:17] not the news it's not public opinion
[1:26:20] that is we're not called to rally around
[1:26:22] those things but we're called a rally
[1:26:24] around the lord jesus christ amen the
[1:26:26] living word of the you know the prophet
[1:26:28] said if america just received the gift
[1:26:30] that was in her midst which was the
[1:26:32] baptism of the holy ghost the genuine
[1:26:34] one they would have they'd have like a
[1:26:36] millennium condition
[1:26:37] i mean all their enemies would have
[1:26:38] feared them
[1:26:40] he said that that that one holy ghost
[1:26:42] filled camp meeting is worth more to a
[1:26:44] country than than like a hundred atomic
[1:26:46] bombs
[1:26:48] why because of god's moving in a people
[1:26:50] it actually pushes the powers of
[1:26:51] darkness back i mean that the enemy
[1:26:53] can't do what he wants to do
[1:26:56] i mean that's why we cannot let down the
[1:26:57] buzz just conform to a word and not have
[1:27:00] the spark the dynamics living in our
[1:27:02] lives we must have god manifesting this
[1:27:05] word in us
[1:27:06] hallelujah
[1:27:07] amen we can't just let religious spirits
[1:27:10] infiltrate and make us lukewarm formal
[1:27:11] and powerless no but we're here that god
[1:27:14] would come in and not just infiltrate
[1:27:16] but we let we open the door say come and
[1:27:18] lord jesus take over my life amen
[1:27:20] hallelujah transforms us and makes us
[1:27:22] like him
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:24] so we can just turn this around because
[1:27:27] they receive the love for the truth they
[1:27:29] are saved and for this cause god took
[1:27:31] them into rapture
[1:27:34] amen
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:38] hallelujah hey isn't the lord good
[1:27:41] remember we're not the children of
[1:27:42] darkness we're children of the light we
[1:27:44] can see where we're going we see where
[1:27:46] we came from we're going from eternity
[1:27:48] we're going back to eternity amen we see
[1:27:50] what the devil's doing that's why you
[1:27:53] know if you really want to just pour
[1:27:55] unbelief in your life sit on social
[1:27:56] media
[1:27:58] if you want to have a double-minded way
[1:28:00] just sit on social media it's guaranteed
[1:28:02] if you want faith to come and put the
[1:28:04] message on amen read your bible pray
[1:28:06] every day as brother edward saying to
[1:28:08] the young people
[1:28:09] hallelujah
[1:28:11] amen and make sure that your
[1:28:13] relationship is between you and god
[1:28:15] amen hallelujah
[1:28:18] it's just the devil that makes makes you
[1:28:20] think the word is boring
[1:28:23] amen and if you feel that way you say
[1:28:25] lord put a love put a fire put a passion
[1:28:28] end me for your word
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:31] now jesus would say in a parable we
[1:28:33] won't read the whole parable but he says
[1:28:35] in luke 19 11
[1:28:37] and as they heard these things he added
[1:28:39] and spake a parable because he was nigh
[1:28:41] to jerusalem and because they thought
[1:28:44] that the kingdom of god should
[1:28:45] immediately appear
[1:28:47] and he said therefore a certain nobleman
[1:28:49] went into a far country to receive for
[1:28:50] himself a kingdom and to return
[1:28:52] and he called his ten servants and
[1:28:54] delivered them ten pounds and said unto
[1:28:57] them occupy till i come
[1:28:59] but this but his citizens hated him
[1:29:02] and sent a message after him saying we
[1:29:04] will not have this man to reign over us
[1:29:08] now that he
[1:29:09] he's laying out this parable
[1:29:11] he's actually prophesying
[1:29:12] he's saying this is what's going to
[1:29:14] happen
[1:29:15] they're going to hate me because i'm the
[1:29:17] king
[1:29:18] right i'm the king in this parable i'm
[1:29:20] going to give my servants
[1:29:22] talents i'm going to give them gifts
[1:29:25] it can be preaching it can be
[1:29:27] exhortation it can be singing it can be
[1:29:29] song writing can be prayer helps
[1:29:32] governments teaching evangelism whatever
[1:29:35] it is you know but everyone has a gift
[1:29:38] hallelujah i'm actually looking i
[1:29:40] believe at the most gifted people
[1:29:43] on the face of the earth the bride of
[1:29:44] jesus christ amen and we want to take
[1:29:47] our talents which is our gifts he's when
[1:29:49] he talks about talents he's not talking
[1:29:50] about stewardship of money
[1:29:52] he's talking about stewardship of gifts
[1:29:54] that god's given you
[1:29:56] right people say oh no you're gonna be
[1:29:57] financially accountable sure you should
[1:29:58] be but this is not what this is talking
[1:29:59] about this is talking about the gift in
[1:30:02] your life are you putting it into use
[1:30:04] amen right but the one no we don't um i
[1:30:06] don't have it here but the one who just
[1:30:07] buried his talent he was afraid that the
[1:30:10] king would get mad at him if he made a
[1:30:12] mistake
[1:30:14] no no step out in faith
[1:30:16] our god our god has given us a talent
[1:30:18] each
[1:30:19] it can be five ten one hey even if i've
[1:30:22] i've got one i want to put it into
[1:30:23] action
[1:30:24] highly i'm gonna put it into action for
[1:30:26] his glory
[1:30:27] amen because he's coming back for me
[1:30:30] hallelujah but so he's saying that these
[1:30:32] so the citizens are saying we will not
[1:30:35] have this man
[1:30:36] to reign over us and who is this man the
[1:30:38] word
[1:30:40] why do they say when he's standing
[1:30:41] before pilate
[1:30:43] pilate asks him should we lease should i
[1:30:44] release barabbas or this jesus of
[1:30:46] nazareth and they said give us barabbas
[1:30:49] imagine what just went through us
[1:30:51] you'd be shocked wouldn't you brabus is
[1:30:53] a murderer horrible man come on he's
[1:30:56] condemned to die because of what he did
[1:30:58] here's jesus of nazareth just being
[1:30:59] scourged crown of thorns on his head
[1:31:01] standing there never did anything wrong
[1:31:03] in his life and he's expecting that
[1:31:05] jesus will be released because that
[1:31:06] makes sense
[1:31:08] one hand a murderer the other one raised
[1:31:09] the dead
[1:31:10] he did every funeral he went to it
[1:31:13] didn't stay a funeral
[1:31:14] healed the sick raise the dead cast out
[1:31:16] devils he's the same jesus today
[1:31:19] gave eternal life but they say give us
[1:31:21] barabbas basically they're saying we
[1:31:22] will not have this man reign over us
[1:31:26] now as i said in the beginning about
[1:31:29] ahab ahab if you read that account
[1:31:31] brought
[1:31:32] destruction upon himself
[1:31:34] and christ rejecting men or christ
[1:31:37] rejecting nation or a christ-rejecting
[1:31:39] world brings judgment upon itself
[1:31:44] i want just keep that in mind very i say
[1:31:46] unto you
[1:31:48] all these things shall come upon this
[1:31:50] generation o jerusalem jerusalem thou
[1:31:52] that kill us the prophets and stone of
[1:31:54] them which are sent unto thee how often
[1:31:56] would i have gathered thy children
[1:31:58] together even as a hen gathereth her
[1:32:00] chickens under her wings but ye would
[1:32:02] not behold your house is left unto you
[1:32:05] desolate for i sent you ye shall not see
[1:32:08] me henceforth till he shall say blessed
[1:32:11] is he that cometh in the name of the
[1:32:13] lord
[1:32:14] and jesus went out and departed from the
[1:32:16] temple and his disciples came to him
[1:32:20] came to him for to show him the
[1:32:22] buildings of the temple and jesus said
[1:32:24] unto them see ye not all these things
[1:32:26] verily i say unto you there shall not be
[1:32:29] left here one stone upon another that
[1:32:32] shall not be thrown down
[1:32:35] this was prophesied to happen
[1:32:37] and remember jesus
[1:32:38] was led by vision so maybe he saw the
[1:32:40] destruction when he's looking at the
[1:32:42] temple and things
[1:32:43] now this all happened
[1:32:45] because of christ rejecting men we will
[1:32:48] not have this man rule over us what they
[1:32:49] do truth was presented
[1:32:52] but they turned down truth and they
[1:32:54] crucified truth what happens a mark of
[1:32:56] the beast falls now
[1:32:58] now this is just a painting of the
[1:33:00] destruction of of jerusalem
[1:33:03] when jesus said that not one stone will
[1:33:05] be left upon another
[1:33:08] nothing could stop this from happening
[1:33:11] ahab
[1:33:12] the prophecy of elijah said ahab was
[1:33:14] going to die
[1:33:15] nothing could stop it from happening
[1:33:18] because ahab didn't fully
[1:33:20] repent he was a bit tender and soft and
[1:33:23] careful for a bit but then he just went
[1:33:25] back into his old ways
[1:33:28] and it had to be fulfilled so everything
[1:33:30] all the events of those days was
[1:33:32] bringing ahab's destruction all the
[1:33:34] events that led to this was bringing its
[1:33:36] destruction
[1:33:37] all the you know the zealots rising up
[1:33:39] and they you know hated the romans they
[1:33:41] wanted to cast them off and political
[1:33:42] factions and all these things going on
[1:33:45] it was all because of christ rejecting
[1:33:47] men were stirred up
[1:33:49] to destroy
[1:33:51] now if you were a believer in that day
[1:33:54] there would have been a lot of pressure
[1:33:56] are you for us are you against the
[1:33:57] romans
[1:33:59] what side are you on you're a jew
[1:34:02] make a step we're jews too don't you
[1:34:04] want the don't you want
[1:34:06] jerusalem to be free again don't you
[1:34:08] want the romans to be kicked out look at
[1:34:09] all the pressure they put on us reading
[1:34:11] the news all these things going on
[1:34:13] taxation and hardship and things and you
[1:34:15] know there'd be a lot of pressure but a
[1:34:16] real believer would say no hold on
[1:34:19] my god told me this is going to be
[1:34:20] destroyed
[1:34:22] and when and and he said pray that your
[1:34:25] your flight when this happened when when
[1:34:27] jerusalem's um compassed about with
[1:34:29] armies pray that your flight is not on
[1:34:31] the sabbath day why because the gates
[1:34:33] were shut on the sabbath day you know
[1:34:34] titus besieged jerusalem three times
[1:34:37] on the third time he took it and
[1:34:38] destroyed it the first two times he had
[1:34:40] to withdraw to take care of other
[1:34:42] enemies
[1:34:43] so no doubt when when when titus came
[1:34:45] the first time then he left all the real
[1:34:47] believers will say hey
[1:34:49] the lord said about this let's get out
[1:34:52] holy they would have fled for their
[1:34:53] lives and they weren't caught in the
[1:34:55] destruction because they obeyed the
[1:34:56] voice of god i mean they the seal of god
[1:34:59] i mean that quickened that word to their
[1:35:01] souls that when prophecy was being
[1:35:03] fulfilled they ran for their lives and
[1:35:05] they weren't caught in the destruction
[1:35:06] it's the same thing today friends if you
[1:35:08] have the seal of god the baptism of the
[1:35:10] holy ghost you won't be caught in the
[1:35:12] destruction of the world you won't be
[1:35:13] here for the great tribulation you'll be
[1:35:15] on streets of gold amen you'll be down
[1:35:17] around the wedding supper table i've
[1:35:19] been having the feast
[1:35:21] hallelujah
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:25] why are you talking about the
[1:35:26] destruction of jerusalem and the mark of
[1:35:28] the beast and so on because there's a
[1:35:30] lot of events taking place
[1:35:32] and they are sad events they are tragic
[1:35:34] events but we can't get caught up in
[1:35:36] them
[1:35:39] brother bam said this
[1:35:40] the last and seventh vision was there
[1:35:43] and i heard a most terrible explosion
[1:35:45] and as i turned to look i saw nothing
[1:35:48] but deborah's and craters and smoke all
[1:35:50] over the land of america
[1:35:52] how many of these visions have been
[1:35:53] fulfilled
[1:35:55] quite a lot
[1:35:57] i mean they've been fulfilled exactly as
[1:35:59] he saw them now unfortunately this has
[1:36:02] to happen
[1:36:04] we don't like it i don't want to see
[1:36:06] destroy i don't want to see people i
[1:36:07] don't want to see california go in
[1:36:10] it's prophesied it's going to happen
[1:36:12] right even in revelations 18. there's
[1:36:14] two babylons
[1:36:16] one is burnt up the other's like a
[1:36:18] millstone cast into the water god what
[1:36:20] is that that's la sliding in
[1:36:24] i don't there'll be millions of people
[1:36:25] die
[1:36:26] you think about the catastrophe it won't
[1:36:29] just be an isolated you know you're the
[1:36:31] earthquake in haiti that's happened
[1:36:33] hundreds have died you know thousands
[1:36:34] die here and different things it'll be
[1:36:36] on a grand scale do you think we're
[1:36:38] going to be saying hallelujah glory to
[1:36:40] god i'm so glad those people went into
[1:36:42] that no we won't because they are people
[1:36:45] like you and i
[1:36:46] but they have a choice
[1:36:48] if anyone is sincere and generally want
[1:36:50] to find god god will come across their
[1:36:52] path they can be in the back of
[1:36:53] afghanistan somewhere they can be in
[1:36:55] some muslim they can be in mecca and
[1:36:57] saudi arabia if they have a genuine
[1:36:59] burden
[1:37:00] i want to meet god then the lord jesus
[1:37:02] christ will come by their way god is
[1:37:04] obligated to a sincere heart it's the
[1:37:06] same thing with you and if we have a
[1:37:07] genuine longing lord i want to know you
[1:37:09] i really want to know you lord i just
[1:37:10] want to i don't want to hear about you
[1:37:12] only i want to know you god will meet
[1:37:14] you god will meet that kind of a heart
[1:37:17] so all of the events we have we are
[1:37:20] seeing
[1:37:21] is stepping stones to the fulfillment of
[1:37:24] this
[1:37:25] when george floyd was murdered like he
[1:37:27] was
[1:37:28] those horrible things happened that was
[1:37:31] a stepping stone for the destruction of
[1:37:33] america
[1:37:34] whether we like it all remember rome
[1:37:36] wasn't built in a day
[1:37:38] it wasn't destroyed in a day either but
[1:37:40] it's a lot quicker to destroy something
[1:37:42] to build something but if you go look at
[1:37:44] you know a lot of historians have
[1:37:45] studied the fall of the roman empire
[1:37:48] and it was stepping stone upon stepping
[1:37:50] stone upon stepping stone because
[1:37:52] there's a scripture that the beast would
[1:37:54] receive a deadly womb it would be healed
[1:37:56] it turned from pagan rome to papal rome
[1:37:59] it's just a phrase in the scripture but
[1:38:01] there's a lot of events that cause that
[1:38:02] to happen right and if we were living
[1:38:05] there maybe we were even christians that
[1:38:07] were living in rome genuine ones you
[1:38:08] know we see our see our country go down
[1:38:11] we'd probably be feeling bit sad about
[1:38:13] it maybe i don't know might be wrong but
[1:38:15] you know no one likes to see destruction
[1:38:18] especially a christian we want to see
[1:38:19] life
[1:38:21] amen we want to see life
[1:38:23] so
[1:38:24] the murder of george floyd the black
[1:38:26] lives matter movement all those things
[1:38:28] it was horrible how he died but it was a
[1:38:30] stepping stone for this
[1:38:32] the travesty of the withdrawal from
[1:38:34] afghanistan
[1:38:36] it's horrible
[1:38:37] seeing that footage of that although of
[1:38:39] that globe master
[1:38:41] cargo plane fly off and people are
[1:38:43] hanging onto the sides and trying to get
[1:38:45] out falling to their death that's
[1:38:46] horrible
[1:38:48] it's all part of this
[1:38:51] it is you've got to look remember we're
[1:38:53] maybe a scriptural trained church see
[1:38:55] everything we see amen we should see it
[1:38:58] through the lens of prophecy
[1:39:01] it doesn't mean we're indifferent to it
[1:39:02] i'm sad for those people
[1:39:06] amen
[1:39:07] you know
[1:39:09] and and and even the condition of this
[1:39:10] country we're not exempt oh we're an
[1:39:13] island far away in the pacific don't be
[1:39:15] naive
[1:39:16] this country is going to get it too
[1:39:19] christ rejecting nations they receive
[1:39:20] judgment but the elect is sealed away
[1:39:23] and taken away before that ever happens
[1:39:25] i mean so we can't get but but the media
[1:39:27] and everything wants to bombard us with
[1:39:29] these things look at what's happening
[1:39:30] and it causes us to have an effect upon
[1:39:32] us oh there's a you know we can look at
[1:39:34] the injustice and get caught up in that
[1:39:36] or this is wrong and the country should
[1:39:38] do this and this is going on
[1:39:40] don't get caught up in it
[1:39:42] does it build faith
[1:39:44] no is the correct answer if you want it
[1:39:46] it doesn't build faith does it actually
[1:39:48] make us more like the lord no
[1:39:50] it makes us carnally minded
[1:39:52] that's why we have to be able to walk
[1:39:53] through this world
[1:39:55] but not be
[1:39:56] tainted by this world amen
[1:39:59] the baptism of the holy ghost is here to
[1:40:01] allow us to walk through this world
[1:40:03] amen and not be tainted by it and to be
[1:40:05] a living witness
[1:40:06] that people can be caught up in that
[1:40:08] stuff and we can pull them
[1:40:10] hallelujah so there's a better way
[1:40:13] there's a better way than being caught
[1:40:14] up in all this stuff
[1:40:16] people protesting about lockdowns and
[1:40:18] vaccines and so on the vaccine is not
[1:40:20] the mark of the beast it's not a
[1:40:22] stepping stone to the mark of the beast
[1:40:23] the bible's clearly i've i'm trust i've
[1:40:25] showed you
[1:40:26] it's clearly the mark of the beast is a
[1:40:29] mark of apostasy
[1:40:31] amen and the physical manifestation of
[1:40:33] it to me is people who are unwilling to
[1:40:36] be tamed to the scripture they cannot be
[1:40:38] because their nature within them is an
[1:40:39] untamable creature
[1:40:46] he says now you say brother brown why do
[1:40:48] you strike at those people so hard it
[1:40:49] ought to be struck at it's got to be
[1:40:51] struck at flee it because it will
[1:40:53] finally form the mark of the beast
[1:40:54] remember that will that is the truth it
[1:40:57] will be the mark of the beast the
[1:40:58] nomination will lead right to it it's on
[1:41:01] its road right here now
[1:41:03] to to force by power look at look in the
[1:41:06] old roman empire that's exactly what led
[1:41:08] them to the mark of the of an apostasy
[1:41:11] we found out that no man could buy or
[1:41:13] sell without the mark of the beast he
[1:41:15] had to have it look at the old roman
[1:41:17] empire that's exactly what led them wait
[1:41:20] sorry i've already okay we've got our
[1:41:21] next paragraph there is only two classes
[1:41:23] of people will be on the earth those
[1:41:25] with the seal of god and those with the
[1:41:26] mark of the beast you say what about the
[1:41:28] foolish virgin they think they have the
[1:41:29] seal of god
[1:41:32] right because they they had no oil when
[1:41:34] the bridegroom came but they were virgin
[1:41:36] clean living to the word
[1:41:38] i don't want to be one of them let's not
[1:41:40] be foolish just be wise
[1:41:42] let's be wise in this hour lord give us
[1:41:44] wisdom
[1:41:45] fill our lamps with oil
[1:41:47] may we have a revival every day
[1:41:49] may he be fresh and wonderful every day
[1:41:52] may never get cold may never become
[1:41:53] indifferent you know you know brother
[1:41:55] john anders was preaching about heart
[1:41:57] surgery yesterday
[1:41:59] anything about blockages in the heart
[1:42:00] and i was actually i think i was talking
[1:42:02] to analysts when we're driving we're uh
[1:42:04] we're gonna go pick up a friend or
[1:42:05] something yeah yeah for lunch and and i
[1:42:07] said you know you know how you can
[1:42:08] spiritually feel your heart's getting
[1:42:10] blocked you become cool and indifferent
[1:42:13] should say lord
[1:42:15] undo the blockages
[1:42:18] in my spirit
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:22] now
[1:42:23] only two classes yeah only two classes
[1:42:25] so you'll have to have one or the other
[1:42:27] will be an apostasy a mark of religion
[1:42:29] apostate religion and it's going to have
[1:42:32] an image unto the beast as we study we
[1:42:33] find out that rome was and as always to
[1:42:36] be the beast exactly there is no way to
[1:42:38] get it anything else rome and what did
[1:42:40] rome do was converted from pagan rome
[1:42:43] unto papal rome and organized a system a
[1:42:46] universal system that forced everybody
[1:42:48] to that one religion or be put to death
[1:42:52] and it's a strange thing that this
[1:42:54] united states appears on the scene and
[1:42:56] it's like a lamb and a lamb has two
[1:42:59] small horns civil and ecclesiastical
[1:43:01] rights and after a while when that was a
[1:43:03] lamb we found out that it spoke then
[1:43:06] like a dragon now this is revelation 13
[1:43:08] if you're wondering and exercised all
[1:43:10] the power that the dragon had before it
[1:43:11] and the bible tells us that they said
[1:43:14] let us make an image unto the beast
[1:43:16] an image is something like something
[1:43:18] else and we can see it right um we can
[1:43:21] see it right now that it's an apostate
[1:43:24] condition the church is forming the
[1:43:26] world council of churches which is the
[1:43:28] image to the power of rome and will
[1:43:30] force upon the people the same thing
[1:43:32] that the pagan or papal rome did so
[1:43:34] there is no other way no other thing but
[1:43:37] that is the truth and that's why i'm
[1:43:39] striking it in my age in my time because
[1:43:42] it's got to be struck at the call coming
[1:43:44] to come out of her my people that ye be
[1:43:47] not partaker of her sins
[1:43:50] amen it says here come out of her this
[1:43:52] is in revelation 18 4. i'll just read it
[1:43:55] i heard another voice from heaven saying
[1:43:56] come out of her my people that ye be not
[1:43:59] partaker of her sins and that you
[1:44:00] receive not of her plagues
[1:44:03] hallelujah we've heard the call come out
[1:44:05] here we are we've come out
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:09] hallelujah
[1:44:10] now there's a there's a concern about
[1:44:13] well if there's no man can buy or sell
[1:44:15] does that mean we're going to be put out
[1:44:17] to one side and we won't be able to buy
[1:44:19] or sell
[1:44:21] well
[1:44:22] let's have a look
[1:44:24] and his church stands alone
[1:44:26] she is not hooked up with nothing
[1:44:28] now notice
[1:44:30] when he's talking about this he's
[1:44:31] talking about the body of christ around
[1:44:32] the world
[1:44:33] right the church what is the church it's
[1:44:35] not shekinah tabernacle
[1:44:37] four walls address
[1:44:40] registered with the charities commission
[1:44:42] that's not the church the church is a
[1:44:44] body of believers that god dwells in
[1:44:47] right that is the church that's the
[1:44:49] redeemed because remember when the
[1:44:50] rapture happens this building's staying
[1:44:52] here this pulpit's going to stay here my
[1:44:54] bible's going to stay here the message
[1:44:55] books will stay here he's going to take
[1:44:57] living people who are filled with him
[1:44:59] amen when he amy is going to take people
[1:45:02] who are made in his image now and his
[1:45:04] church stands alone she is not hooked up
[1:45:06] with nothing
[1:45:07] but he was identified by god
[1:45:10] being the body that god dwelt in and the
[1:45:12] church is identified by his body doing
[1:45:13] the same thing she is his body the
[1:45:16] manifested truth of his promised word
[1:45:18] for the last days and she and she alone
[1:45:20] stands by it that's why the devil's
[1:45:22] howling these great organizations just
[1:45:24] set up something to close her up
[1:45:26] now the reason i said about the church
[1:45:28] being the body is because sure these
[1:45:30] church doors could shut
[1:45:31] but the body will still function
[1:45:34] amen we can still preach we can still
[1:45:37] you know we can still minister we can
[1:45:38] still function as a body
[1:45:40] amen because this really what we're
[1:45:42] doing right now is the smallest part of
[1:45:43] our body functioning
[1:45:45] right
[1:45:47] amen
[1:45:49] they'll never do it
[1:45:51] she'll be taken up not closed up
[1:45:54] amen they may try but they'll never do
[1:45:57] it i stand by this i mean they'll never
[1:46:00] do it she'll be taken up not closed up
[1:46:02] she is now risen and by the power the
[1:46:04] vindicated word promised to her amen
[1:46:08] hallelujah
[1:46:10] sure there'll come a time where people
[1:46:12] can't buy or sell unless they have the
[1:46:14] mark of the beast the number of his name
[1:46:15] and you know but look at this
[1:46:17] now when he gets all the money um when
[1:46:19] he gets the money all under control
[1:46:21] then he'll break this covenant with the
[1:46:23] jews as daniel said here he would do it
[1:46:25] in the midst of the last half of the
[1:46:27] seventy weeks of daniel
[1:46:29] and then brother what will he do he'll
[1:46:32] have all of the world's trade and the
[1:46:33] commerce are packed with the world
[1:46:35] because he'll hold the wealth of the
[1:46:37] world completely and during that time
[1:46:39] them two prophets will rise up on the
[1:46:41] scene and call that 144 000 then what
[1:46:44] will take place then the mark of the
[1:46:46] beast of revelation 13 will set in what
[1:46:48] is it
[1:46:49] the the mark of the beast will be
[1:46:51] manifested when the rapture goes it's
[1:46:53] already been applied
[1:46:55] just like the seal of god when we are in
[1:46:57] that glorious moment where our bodies
[1:46:59] have changed before we realize it that's
[1:47:01] the full manifestation of the seal of
[1:47:03] god
[1:47:04] hallelujah we feel as glory fill our
[1:47:07] souls we love his presence and we love
[1:47:09] his word and we can look back and he
[1:47:11] changes from glory to glory our nature
[1:47:13] what we are we weren't i mean what we
[1:47:15] are we're not we're not what we used to
[1:47:17] be well he's changed us made a sweet
[1:47:20] humble kind gentle forgiving long
[1:47:22] suffering full of love patience meekness
[1:47:24] amen
[1:47:25] why what's it says all those things are
[1:47:27] wonderful but but when these bodies are
[1:47:29] changed then we'll really realize the
[1:47:31] full magnitude of what happened when we
[1:47:33] really received the lord and he filled
[1:47:34] our souls with his glorious presence
[1:47:37] hallelujah
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:41] because he holds all the commerce trade
[1:47:43] and everything
[1:47:44] of the world and what will take place in
[1:47:46] the mark of the beast will come in that
[1:47:48] no man could buy or sell except him that
[1:47:50] has the mark of the beast thank god the
[1:47:53] church will be enjoying a great three
[1:47:54] and a half years in glory won't have to
[1:47:57] go through that amen
[1:48:00] hallelujah read that again as well put
[1:48:02] it in yellow thank god
[1:48:04] the church will be enjoying a great
[1:48:06] three and a half year years in glory
[1:48:08] won't have to go through that
[1:48:10] i mean when that full you know what is a
[1:48:13] boycott the prophet speaks about a
[1:48:14] boycott what's boycott that's a cancel
[1:48:17] culture we use the term cancel culture
[1:48:19] today that's a boycott
[1:48:21] boycott that shop boycott those people
[1:48:23] because they do this and this and this
[1:48:25] that's cancel culture
[1:48:27] amen so we're living in the day of a
[1:48:29] boycott coming in
[1:48:31] we're living a day of this control
[1:48:33] coming in
[1:48:34] but she won't be closed up she'll be
[1:48:36] taken up i mean we'll be in the wedding
[1:48:38] supper on the skies where no man can buy
[1:48:40] or sell
[1:48:43] what do we have to be worried about
[1:48:47] hallelujah
[1:48:49] amen
[1:48:50] that's why i say don't get caught up in
[1:48:52] what's going on in the world
[1:48:54] right
[1:48:56] the vaccine's a health thing
[1:48:58] you've got to know to take it or not but
[1:49:00] don't don't not take it out of because
[1:49:02] you're afraid
[1:49:04] amen you've got everything you do you
[1:49:06] got to do in faith
[1:49:07] even medicine you take a doctor's advice
[1:49:10] you got to take it all in faith
[1:49:12] right right the lord tells just say for
[1:49:15] example you know
[1:49:16] you get cancer and the lord tells you no
[1:49:18] no you don't need chemotherapy and it's
[1:49:20] a genuine revelation you've got to
[1:49:22] receive that in faith
[1:49:24] and that and that revelation will take
[1:49:25] you beyond
[1:49:26] right these symptoms that you're feeling
[1:49:28] in your body or if the lord says no you
[1:49:31] need to go get treatment
[1:49:33] brother brown took all of his children
[1:49:34] himself he went to the doctor first
[1:49:37] right
[1:49:38] amen
[1:49:42] so you know but everything we do
[1:49:44] we have to do in faith
[1:49:46] we can't be living afraid but what is
[1:49:48] all this stuff happening in the world
[1:49:50] it's fear
[1:49:51] oh it could be this and this is this you
[1:49:53] know there's so many videos i've watched
[1:49:56] and they talk about the science of
[1:49:57] different things i just i'm just going
[1:49:58] to mention this but
[1:50:00] because i've sat too long in lecture
[1:50:02] theaters and i know what they're talking
[1:50:04] about i can go and do some more research
[1:50:05] and say no no they use the terms but
[1:50:07] what they're saying is not true
[1:50:09] but it puts a fear because it couldn't
[1:50:11] yeah everything man touches is flawed
[1:50:14] right everything so of course there's
[1:50:17] going to be problems with medicine
[1:50:19] right because it's fallen man trying his
[1:50:22] best but you got everything you do you
[1:50:25] got to do in faith
[1:50:28] but don't let fair rule you
[1:50:31] don't be afraid we don't need to be
[1:50:32] afraid
[1:50:36] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:50:38] whereby you're sealed into the day of
[1:50:40] redemption amen
[1:50:42] and if you're sealed in amen the devil
[1:50:45] can't break that seal
[1:50:47] images like brother kaido did at the
[1:50:48] camp you know he took like a sealed
[1:50:49] bottle he threw it around
[1:50:53] the seal house
[1:50:55] hallelujah
[1:50:56] you know you don't need to be afraid
[1:50:58] now this is a man-made seal so it could
[1:51:00] break but yeah when god steals something
[1:51:03] it ain't gonna bust open it ain't gonna
[1:51:05] break
[1:51:06] hallelujah you can't even scratch it
[1:51:09] hallelujah
[1:51:10] doesn't matter remember a man can so
[1:51:12] serve god that the devil doesn't know
[1:51:14] what to do with him
[1:51:15] so he can do he can throw you through
[1:51:17] many great afflictions many great trials
[1:51:19] but even in spite of every trial you
[1:51:21] just praise god
[1:51:22] holly because remember our walk with god
[1:51:24] is not you the trial in god or you and
[1:51:27] your bank account and god oh it's full
[1:51:29] praise the lord it's empty oh this is
[1:51:31] dumb no praise the lord anyhow amen oh
[1:51:34] how's god going to fix us this great
[1:51:35] trial i don't see a way out praise the
[1:51:37] lord anyhow
[1:51:38] we worship god
[1:51:41] amen you don't need to worry about your
[1:51:43] body
[1:51:44] amen
[1:51:45] we'll get to that but see we're sealed
[1:51:47] to the day of our redemption
[1:51:50] i love this that's from the testimony of
[1:51:52] a true witness
[1:51:53] now one reason that i'm a calvinistic
[1:51:56] thinker of security of the believers
[1:51:58] because that i believe that when a man
[1:52:00] or a woman is in their right mind that
[1:52:02] is the time to accept the lord jesus
[1:52:05] and get it all settled then once forever
[1:52:07] because when we come to the end of the
[1:52:10] road we don't know just where and how
[1:52:13] we're going to be sick
[1:52:15] we may be sick in our mind and there may
[1:52:17] be a fever that could really cook
[1:52:20] cook
[1:52:21] our very brain
[1:52:23] yep and we might say anything or do
[1:52:25] anything at the end of the road
[1:52:28] we don't know but you see if we have
[1:52:31] already anchored in christ
[1:52:33] no matter what sickness takes us or what
[1:52:35] condition we're in when we go it's
[1:52:37] already settled
[1:52:40] hallelujah so i could something
[1:52:41] construct me could fly my brain and i
[1:52:43] could do something absolutely crazy
[1:52:47] you think that man is
[1:52:49] he's beyond obviously he wasn't sealed
[1:52:51] because look what happened no no it's
[1:52:53] already settled
[1:52:55] hallelujah you know the jehovah's
[1:52:56] witnesses they you know
[1:52:58] we were talking i think christine was
[1:53:00] coming but you know they're afraid if
[1:53:01] they get dementia
[1:53:03] they forget about jehovah therefore
[1:53:05] they're lost
[1:53:07] so they're depending on their physical
[1:53:08] state
[1:53:10] to fix their spiritual state
[1:53:13] and this is what people do with the mark
[1:53:14] of the beast you've got to outwit the
[1:53:16] devil
[1:53:17] so you don't get marked so my question
[1:53:19] is if it is a vaccine or a microchip or
[1:53:22] whatever
[1:53:23] all those who don't get it are they the
[1:53:25] bride then
[1:53:27] and they can be agnostics atheists they
[1:53:29] can be all kinds of things totally deny
[1:53:31] there is a lord jesus christ are they
[1:53:32] the bride just because that no it
[1:53:34] doesn't work it's a spiritual
[1:53:36] to accept
[1:53:37] the seal of you know to reject one is to
[1:53:40] accept the other and to accept one is to
[1:53:42] reject the other so if you accept the
[1:53:44] baptism of the holy ghost you reject the
[1:53:46] mark of the beast
[1:53:47] but if you accept truth you reject the
[1:53:49] mark of the beast but if you reject
[1:53:51] truth you accept the mark of the beast i
[1:53:54] say things around around the wrong way
[1:53:55] so i trust that made sense
[1:53:57] that's one or the other hallelujah
[1:54:00] amen so
[1:54:02] it doesn't matter see we are sealed in
[1:54:04] the day of our redemption ephesians 4 30
[1:54:06] says grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:54:08] whereby we're sealed into the day not of
[1:54:11] your death or but of your redemption see
[1:54:14] after death is done over you are still
[1:54:18] sealed amen
[1:54:20] hallelujah
[1:54:22] you know i've i endured 90 minutes of a
[1:54:24] video saying that the vaccine has gene
[1:54:27] editing technology in it and they're
[1:54:28] targeting the god gene and people and if
[1:54:30] that gene is taken out people won't
[1:54:32] serve god anymore
[1:54:34] i want those 90 minutes back of my life
[1:54:38] because what people are looking at is
[1:54:40] they're actually depending oh my
[1:54:42] physical state makes me a believer or
[1:54:44] not no
[1:54:45] and so therefore they think that the
[1:54:47] devil can somehow stop people becoming
[1:54:48] believers or staying believers we know a
[1:54:50] sister who got vaccinated she says i
[1:54:52] still love the lord
[1:54:54] she obviously saw it too or heard about
[1:54:57] it
[1:54:58] but it's fear-mongering
[1:55:01] now i say that for a reason not to be a
[1:55:03] joke
[1:55:04] but if we're scriptural trained we'll
[1:55:06] see no man can come to me except the
[1:55:08] father which hath sent me draw him and
[1:55:10] i'll raise him up at the last day so he
[1:55:12] says it's god that does a drawing it's
[1:55:14] not a gene
[1:55:15] in you it's not some genetic trait that
[1:55:18] therefore you've somehow got this gene
[1:55:20] therefore you're a christian or a
[1:55:21] believer no no god does the drawing
[1:55:24] irrespective of
[1:55:26] our race our color our forebears you
[1:55:29] could be the if you could trace your
[1:55:30] family tree back you might be literally
[1:55:32] the only bride member in your tree
[1:55:37] because remember jesus said the wind
[1:55:38] bloth where it listeth
[1:55:40] you know it comes from here goes here
[1:55:42] you know you don't know how that happens
[1:55:43] but that's how everyone is born to the
[1:55:45] spirit of god
[1:55:46] hallelujah hey a lot of us came out of
[1:55:49] came out of deep pits
[1:55:51] where where a lot of us would look at us
[1:55:53] back then and say they aren't coming
[1:55:56] they don't believe they're not
[1:55:57] interested but god saw us he put a cg to
[1:56:00] predestination that cannot be edited out
[1:56:02] by any of man's ideas or abilities right
[1:56:06] and that's before the foundation of the
[1:56:07] world
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:09] amen
[1:56:12] so no man can come to accept my father
[1:56:13] draws except the father which has sent
[1:56:15] me draw him
[1:56:16] and then and then the same same chapter
[1:56:18] and what if you shall see the son of man
[1:56:20] ascend up from where he was before it is
[1:56:22] the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:56:24] profiteth nothing
[1:56:27] amen the words i speak into the spirit
[1:56:29] in our life so it's not the genes you
[1:56:31] have
[1:56:32] it's not your mental ability to put it
[1:56:34] all together it's a spirit that makes it
[1:56:37] live
[1:56:39] amen i'm glad it's that way
[1:56:41] it would have gone way over my head
[1:56:42] somewhere if it was
[1:56:44] praise the lord
[1:56:45] praise the lord of the sin exams to take
[1:56:47] a rapture
[1:56:49] we have the sudden exam to overcome this
[1:56:51] is not this is not a lecture this is not
[1:56:52] a man-made man-made religion is do you
[1:56:55] understand it mentally and if you do
[1:56:57] you've passed the test like people who
[1:56:58] get baptized in other churches they've
[1:57:00] got to sit a course
[1:57:01] about baptism you don't need to sit at
[1:57:03] course just repent and be baptized name
[1:57:05] lord jesus christ give your life and be
[1:57:07] baptized in his name name lord jesus
[1:57:09] christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:57:10] the holy ghost
[1:57:12] peter did not say when they were pricked
[1:57:13] in their hearts and said men and
[1:57:14] brethren what shall we do he didn't say
[1:57:16] now okay hold on we're just building a
[1:57:19] school we've got semester one is turning
[1:57:21] up and you come and sit this course and
[1:57:23] then we'll baptize you and then you'll
[1:57:24] receive the holy ghost no
[1:57:27] but that's man's idea sorry i see time
[1:57:29] is running away
[1:57:30] amen so now
[1:57:32] where were yes see the flesh prophet is
[1:57:34] nothing the words that i speak into the
[1:57:36] spirit they are life but there are some
[1:57:38] of you that believe not for jesus knew
[1:57:39] from the beginning whom
[1:57:41] they were that believe not and who
[1:57:43] should betray him and he said therefore
[1:57:46] i send you that no man can come unto me
[1:57:48] except to be given unto him of my father
[1:57:51] i receive something
[1:57:53] hallelujah my father gave it to me i can
[1:57:56] come hallelujah
[1:57:57] i can come
[1:57:59] amen revelations 13 8 and all that dwell
[1:58:02] upon the face i mean upon the earth
[1:58:04] shall worship him that's the beast whose
[1:58:06] names are not written in the book of the
[1:58:08] life of the lamb's land from the
[1:58:09] foundation of the world if any man have
[1:58:11] an ear let him hear
[1:58:13] hallelujah
[1:58:15] uh my name's written in glory
[1:58:17] there's a name that's written in glory
[1:58:18] and it's mine and it's mine
[1:58:21] see i put that in because it's not it's
[1:58:23] not our mental ability we're not going
[1:58:24] to outsmart the devil and not take the
[1:58:26] mark
[1:58:27] that's not how this works
[1:58:31] and fear him not which which kill the
[1:58:34] body
[1:58:35] don't be afraid of that guy
[1:58:37] but
[1:58:38] but are not able to kill the soul but
[1:58:40] rather fear him that is able to destroy
[1:58:42] both the soul and body in hell so don't
[1:58:44] fear those that can harm your body
[1:58:47] don't live in fear of that guy
[1:58:49] fear the one that can destroy your body
[1:58:51] and soul in hell
[1:58:53] so what what jesus is saying if i can
[1:58:55] put it in my own english is
[1:58:58] pay attention to the one that can
[1:58:59] destroy the body and soul listen to him
[1:59:03] don't listen to this world they can just
[1:59:04] harm your body
[1:59:06] amen
[1:59:09] but i wanted to get that myth get their
[1:59:11] message to you that you are not part of
[1:59:13] uh that you are part of this
[1:59:14] resurrection see don't worry about it no
[1:59:17] more see just rejoice over it

[2:02:50] the railroad puts a seal on a door that

[2:02:57] seal upon a man and the seal is the holy
[2:03:00] spirit when he seals a man like that he
[2:03:02] has gone to his eternal destination
[2:03:04] never no more can he ever ever go back

[2:05:00] we should have a burden for this lost
[2:05:01] and dying world we can't fix this world
[2:05:04] it's prophesied to be destroyed
[2:05:06] right but we shall have a burden for

[2:05:21] not some kingdom building exercise he is
[2:05:23] everything

[2:05:27] the law to someone you're not
[2:05:28] introducing yourself to that person

[2:06:15] after lord you revealed the book of
[2:06:16] revelation to him he saw the great
[2:06:18] glories of you but he saw the great
[2:06:20] destruction of god and different things

[2:09:23] of the beast is a mark of apostasy to
[2:09:25] reject truth lord to turn from it father
[2:09:28] lord jesus and leave your presence that
[2:09:30] way like cain did lord there's a pattern

[2:09:35] lord jesus father they've walked away
[2:09:37] for whatever reason bring them back for
