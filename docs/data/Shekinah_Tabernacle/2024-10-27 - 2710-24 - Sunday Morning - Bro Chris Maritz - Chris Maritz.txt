have feasted from your table as David said it is good for us it was good for me to have been at the house of the Lord and father we can truly say that today that we are happy to be in the house of the Lord we're happy to be sitting at your table Lord knowing that you love us that you care about us you've chosen us you've called us Lord you've written Our Lives Lord in in the back of your hands you know all about us this morning we can come to you with our needs our cares we can come to you with our families we can come to you with our desires Lord our sicknesses our wants our desires Lord we bring them all to the table this morning and Lord we're expecting a feast today with you we're we're we're expecting to have a communion with you this morning so may you just come Lord in a special way as we invite you now we believe as as the item was sung this morning we believe we are standing on Holy Ground And there are angels all around so Lord we ask that you would increase our faith Lord so we can reach Beyond this Dimension Lord that we can bring you out of hiding this morning Lord as that saraph phenician woman she she brought you out of hiding by her faith oh God may we bring you out of hiding we may you come and be the visible one here this morning as we welcome you into this into your house Lord this place that we have dedicated to you may you come and a special way now may you meet the needs of your people and bless us in your presence in Jesus Christ's name amen I'm so thankful we can come to his table this morning and I'm just trusting in Him to supply for our needs to supply for whatever you have on your hearts today I believe he is a living God I believe he is here this morning and he has given us a word in due season amen so I'm expecting great things I'm excited to be in church today we were we were designed for this we were made for us to worship God and to sit and feast and so I feel most comfortable right here in the presence of the Lord amongst the uh fellow Believers amen so we're just trusting the Lord will bless you this morning and we say happy Sunday morning to you amen we uh we go to church on Sunday mornings to honor the resurrection amen and it's not just a a tradition but it is something that is alive in us amen he is the resurrection and the life and it's he that is in us who has already quickened us from the dead amen so we uh we we're not just here to put in a Traditions or time but we are truly here to be changed from Glory unto glory amen God bless you it uh we just uh are so happy to be here with you this morning brother Ben and Sister Christine everyone just been so kind so lovely I see so many uh of of our familiar uh friends and faces that we know and family that we know and we just say God bless you to each and every one of you amen if you'll turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Exodus chapter 38 sorry Exodus 33 I do need to get glasses so if I misquote a number here or there it's just um it's it's this body that is being change from glory to glory from one weight to another weight and it's and I see my wife is smiling there she's saying yes definitely getting heavier amen but there's a glory that is that is taking place there's a glory that is inside of you um and I want to speak a little bit about this this morning Lord willing and I want to just maybe title the sermon uh just so we have a kind of a reference point as we go through the service today just come back to this title it um being the glory of this body and I wanted to subtitle it face to face with his glory so I want to speak on the glory of this body and I want to hone in on this this one element of of of of this sermon today and that is coming face to face with his glory I think that was so appropriate how we how the song was sung this morning the songs were sign just every song this morning was perfect but just that one song really touched me this morning that standing on Holy Ground we are standing on Holy Ground And if we truly believe that this morning then whose presence are we in can we come face to face with our maker you know wouldn't that be amazing if if you could be given the opportunity this morning and and we could say you know um God is just sitting in that little study in the back there he's waiting there for you if you want to see him face to face this morning you can go in there and you can talk to him personally your creator your maker the one who knows everything about you he's he's in there he's got some things he wants to share with you you can go into the little room and you can come face to face with God wouldn't that be a wonderful experience how many here would turn down an an an invitation like that that was a trick question right nobody nobody would turn down an invitation like that but I believe we would all go into that room and we would want to have an audience with him and that's truly what I want to speak about this morning is is this invitation that we have had to come to his table this invitation to come face to face with his glory and so what does this mean you know it's not just sometimes when we think of the word Glory we think of Great Expressions and great demonstrations and and a big Fanfare and you know it's a loud and and everything but we really want to H what does this mean to come face to face with the glory of God and I trust it'll encourage you amen Exodus 33 and 18 and it's just one line of scripture I want to read here and he said I beseech thee this is Moses he's speaking out he's got a a question to God he's got a request to God he says I beseech thee show me thy Glory how many he this morning want to say to the Lord Show Me Your Glory I want to re bound one more time Lord we we have a request on our hearts Today show us your glory father we ask for your blessing upon the reading of the word may you come and bless the service now anoint the words that are spoken father as we just get out of the way have preeminence Lord and may your Holy Spirit move in our hearts and in our midst in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have your seats 1 Corinthians 15 and 40 says this there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the terrestrial Celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there are different bodies and basically he's saying there's the moon the Sun and then on the on the earth there are other kinds of bodies they are more like you know terrafirma kind of bodies they are bodies of of trees there are bodies of rocks you know every Everything has a body a flower has a body right amen you have a body this morning the sun has a body the Moon has a body and all these different bodies have are in different Realms different Dwelling Places but they all have been given a body and they all have a a Divine architect someone who made them amen they have they have a design they have a specific purpose you know the sun doesn't uh you know trade off with the Moon from time to time no it's the Sun and the Moon you know and they have very specific purposes and you can't replace the sun with anything else the sun has been designed to be there to bring warmth to bring light to bring light life to the Earth amen the Moon is there to bring light to be a reflection of the Sun and so what is he saying by these different bodies why did he create these different bodies it is to it is to show us something it is to be an expression of something but he specifically says that these bodies each have a glory and the one glory is different from the other all right the sun has a certain kind of Glory I I would say that probably most people enjoy the sunshine you know they enjoy that as I was walking up the path here it was just a a little bit chilly and and and just coming up the path here and the sun just kind of peak through the clouds there for a moment oh man that felt good that little bit of warming and and that is the glory of the sun that's the value that is the expression of the sun and it has an influence it has an effect on things amen so he created God created all these things for for a purpose and and he's specifically saying I'm going to put these things out there so that you can see by the visible things what is in the invisible so that you can understand me amen and so the the sun speaks of God Amen who brings life to the Earth he's the light and so forth so the sun has a glory it has a certain expression but all the Expressions all the bodies point back to their maker ohen amen each body has its own Glory it has its own purpose and expression like the glory of the Moon it may not have the glory of the Sun but it's the glory it's glory glory is to be able to reflect that that which is of the Sun the light and it's to reflect that upon the Earth and it brings a light in the evening time so we can see all these things have been laid out there like like uh brother brandom says you know the the stars and the and the Moon and the Sun that was uh job and that was Enoch's first Bible Abraham could look up there H the Lord referred to the stars in the heavens your seed will be like that amen so all these things are reflection of something that is real something that is tangible it it is it is a weight of Glory hallu in the message things that are to be glorious message speaking about the things that are coming up by the way things that are coming up is is better than what we have now it's only going to get better amen The Best Is Yet To Come amen so we we are looking at tangible things now we're looking at at different bodies and things and all these things point forward to something that's coming it's crying out it's reflecting it's it's speaking to something that's coming amen and so it's exciting amen because we see it in in a shadow of a shadow of a shadow we see it in in such a dim light but we we see that those things are all pointed to something great something amazing amen and so in the message things that are to be this is kind of the context of of how he's bringing this message and he says I just want to read a couple lines from it for you it says now they only express that there's a greater of the same kind so this body for instance what he's saying is this body this human body when we are changed from glory to glory when we finally cross over or or we drop this robe and we put on an immortal robe that body is not going to suddenly now look like an animal's body or look like something strange or or be some Whisper of a of a of a wind or something like that no it's going to be the same look we'll be able to identify one another that was a question brother brandom had when he went beyond the curtain of time he he was excited that he could shake someone's hand he could Embrace somebody we were still in the same form but this form speaks of something that is greater that is coming amen so have you ever been in a situation where you know things are getting really wor really bad and it's it's it couldn't get any worse that's really that's a good place to be because it can only get better man we're in a position where things can only get better amen hallelujah so there's an expression here what you're looking at it is an expression it's a reminder every day we see we see this guy we see we you see yourself in the mirror you you see your hands right there a reminder that there is something that is greater of the same kind because they are the same kind now the brother brother Rand says this goes on in paragraph 53 he says the likeness all the things that he did expresses the things that are to come amen all the things that he did remember he said that if you a uh if you are something here if you hold a position here of some kind he says you will be the same on that side it just continues on brother brandham will remain a prophet to our generation he will stay in that office amen so that's just a reflection of something that is coming up the likeness all the things that he did expresses the things that are to come just as the body gives you here just as this body he gave you to live in only expresses that there is one that is greater take a good look at that body you've got that you're dragging around every every day there's one that is [Applause] [Music] greater and this body is to remind you every day it's it's it has a glory this body has a glory and the glory of this body is to remind us that there's a greater one waiting for us it only expresses that there is one that is greater Yet to Come the heavens declare his glory the Bible tells us what is that saying they are the mirror of God's glory the the heavens declare his glory it's a reflection of God's glory so they are the mirror of God's glory remember the the subject today is we want to come face to face with his glory we're going to have to do a little bit of homework here before we get to the main meat of the subject so the everything points to or is a mirror or is a reflection or is a shadow of the real thing of his glory ultimately everything points to who he is everything points to the its maker amen everything points back to the original everything the prophet makes this beautiful analogy how the trees and and and plant life and animals he says everything is struggling for life why because the because there's something in us there's something that's built into us that knows that there's an eternity out there there's immortality there's something that's that is fighting that is struggling for life and maybe you're struggling for life this morning maybe you've lost your way a little bit but you're struggling for that life I'm struggling to come face to face with my maker amen God changing us every day every moment sermon to sermon from Glory unto Glory there's changes happening right now you know it's amazing when we're talking about Glory you know it's it is it is something that excites us and it and it sounds like a victory and and it's amazing but you know we're going to get into this a little bit more does this mean the glory you know there's there and what does it mean that we are being changed from Glory unto Glory because at every moment in your life you are an expression of your maker amen you mothers are an expression of God's love and grace to the children you're you are a a a a visible representation of the invisible amen you are the you are a reflection of the glory of God and so there's there's portions of our life where we can say wow this is amazing we we have like like last night we had wonderful uh uh uh healings taking place and people coming up for prayer and and we hear the word of God and it's great and we and we look to those things as glorious amen but your whole life is glory to God your whole life brings Glory the high points the low points everything is an expression of his keeping power of his love of his grace of his Redemption plan your whole life speaks to him it speaks of him it's it's the it's the story that he had in his mind playing out in your life amen so we see every moment of your life is is a step higher up every every day that you live every time you come to church every time you feed on the word we live by the word of God we are doing what we are being changed from Glory unto Glory we're not being changed from one weakness to another weakness we're being changed from Glory unto Glory the bride is is making herself ready dressing herself in the word of God we are being changed amen we are as as brother Andre started off on a Friday we are pressing forward amen we are not going backwards going forwards into the glory of God but it's amazing how Jesus Christ you know he was sitting there one day around the table amongst his disciples and and those that that people would would would say are his not re not not uh realizing that Judas was not was going to betray him and here they are everything is going so well you know the the ministry is going well they are they are they are uh having he healing campaigns and there's great Miracles taking place and oh my goodness you know there's so many testimonies we can share and if we had to talk about the glory of of Jesus Christ's Ministry a lot of people would point back to those Miracles they would point back to the first pull of his ministry the second pole of his ministry they would look at those things as the Glory Days you know they would say that is that was amazing that was the expression of the power of God and so forth but you know there come came a time where he was sitting around a table with just 12 12 people just 12 just a small little group and it became a personal time one-on-one kind of fellowship and it was in this time where where those two trees those two Vines amen was was walking together Cain and Abel walking together amen we have we see these twins growing up both bringing glory to God because remember God created both Satan did not create himself there's a scripture in the in Isaiah that says that even the evil I have made all these things God is the maker of all these things amen so he created Judas to bring a glory because he needed Judas to do a a job for him so we don't have to fear the devil he was created he was made by our God the one who loves you made him to serve a purpose for you and there so there comes a time where where Jesus Christ is sitting there the word and and he's and he's looking around the table and and he knows that you know this is a wonderful scene this is what this is lovely to have Fellowship like this to be in harmony like this but there's coming a season where he himself had to be glorified it wasn't just the Miracles those things were signpost for what was coming for to get the attraction of the people but there's coming a season where that that person Jesus Christ where he himself would be glorified what does that mean to be glorified there was a season where Jesus Christ was going to become was going to conf Faith face to face with the very image that God had of him before the foundation of the world the Lamb of God slain upon a cross he he he was going to come to a moment in his life where he would literally come face to face with the very purpose that he was created for that he was made for that he came to the Earth for he was going to come face to face with the glory of God in his life so there comes a season where he had to be betrayed and he looks over and he says to John whoever I say this to you know you know the story he's the one who's going to betray me and he leans over to Judas just for the sake of time I won't go into all the details he leans over to Judas and he says Judas what whatever you have in your heart to do go do it quickly amen he didn't argue with him what you're going to do is wrong it's immoral it's it's not right no you have a glory to your body that you have to bring out you have a certain value that you've been created for you have a certain purpose and you need to go do it because it's manifesting time my brother and sister we don't have to be be afraid of all the things that are manifesting everybody is playing their part but the question is what about your part don't be afraid of it everybody's got to do their thing amen just let them do their thing whatever you have in your heart to do go do it but I'm also going to do what's in my heart because it's a season for us to be glorified Hallelujah so he tells Judas whatever you do go do quickly go hurry up amen cuz I want to be glorified I want to come face to face with the the promise that is concerning me I want to come face to face with a prophecy that is laying over my life I want to be glorified I want to have a change of body I want to go into a Rapture I want to go through that Resurrection I want to see the my loved ones that have gone before me I want to meet with them I want to be glorified I want to come face to face with the glory of God in my life and so there comes a season where we're not afraid of these things we're not afraid of death we're not afraid of those things that have been cre created and they're harnessed by the hand of God Amen it's we don't have to be afraid of those things God is for us so Judas leaves the room and as he goes to betray the word as the word is going to be rejected as the word is going to be sold out as the message was going to be rejected and and there was going to be the the scoffers and they were going to come against the the the message of the day the word of their day guess what it was at that moment Jesus said now can the son of man be glorified it is at this time now that's now the ministry can be completed now the victory can be won without that betrayal without that what looked like a dark thing what looked like a sad thing what looked like defeat what looked like division what looked like whatever he was going to use that to bring glory to finish his product hallelujah what about you today whatever is happening to you it's happening for a reason that's right so these things are to express the greater thing that is coming the Mighty God unveiled before us 1964 brother B says now when their traditional veil of traditions of the elders and the word is broken through of course today then that comes into Plain View we see him amen so what's he saying getting through just the the everyday stuff don't you know we we we we have a certain expectation like maybe those disciples thought you know we're all going to stay together how is it possible that this person would betray us how is it possible that there would be these things happening around us but we have to look through those things we look through it amen to see the glory of God so we have to look through because somewhere in the picture Christ is unveiling himself the Mighty God unveiling before us hallelujah as Satan unveils himself as he shows his hand God also is showing his hand so deity again is veiled in human flesh brother Braham says you can go to Hebrews 1 and so on he goes on in paragraph 146 and says also Genesis 18 you remember God was a man standing there eating and talking with Abraham and told what Sarah was doing in the tent behind him we we know what this means we've seen this also and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh I want to see the glory of God deity veiled in human flesh Hallelujah now remember Jesus didn't say when the Son of God is being revealed in Luke chapter 17 I believe about the 21st verse he says along there and when the son of man is being revealed he said the son of man the church is going again he says not the Son of God being revealed but the son of man being revealed amen you want to make sure I said that right and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man is in the church again reveal healed in human beings not the Son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days man that's sped up right to our day we went right from from Sodom and gomorrah's day right up to our day amen it's a expression of each other it's a mirror of each other they're pointing at each other so if you want to see God we can go through the parallels we can go through the the types brother Brown says I'm a typologist why because we see Reflections it's a mirror of Who We Are Hallelujah we find that he promised that in God's promises for the last days now we notice another thing in the Old Testament I have the scripture here in Exodus that old Badger skins what did it do it hid the glory of God from the people the badger skins how many here's got some Badger skins you know what I'm talking about right we got some Badger skins and it what does that do it's a veil for the glory of God so that tells me that the glory of God is here but there's a veil just like when they were sitting around that table and and and and and you know there was a time when they were all in Harmony and unity but then suddenly there came a time where they started to manifest what was behind the veil started to come out and there's also but he's saying the glory of God is hid from the people in Badger skins the badger skins even people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it that skin the glory of God was behind the skin now the glory of God is behind your skin I'm just reading what the prophet said the glory of God is behind your skin Oh I want to come face to face with the glory of God you don't have to go very far we are standing on Holy Ground oh brother Chris I've had a terrible week I've had a rough week I'm sick and this of God you are tabernacling the very glory of God he says and now the glory of God is behind your skin that's right and the Traditions don't see it it's the inside of the veil where the word was what was on the inside of that skin back there the old badg of skins he says which he says there was no beauty that we should desire it right Badger skins isn't necessarily A A greatl looking animal right but there was no beauty that we should desire it and when it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it was still no Beauty we should desire it it doesn't matter the glory of God was tabernacled in that skin amen what about you today it's not about how we feel it's not about our emotions it's not about what we think it's not about our reasonings our imaginations it's about the glory of God that is tabernacled within you now the same thing is today amen so that just kind of clears it up the same thing it is today there's nothing in a man or woman that can be desired he says it's what's in behind there that's what it is well you say that fellow I know he used to be a drunkard he used to do this I don't care what he used to do what's hid behind that skin I don't care what you used to be what you used to do what is hidden in your skin praise the Lord what is behind there that's what counts that's what the people is blinded he says the skin blinds the people and you know I'll go as far as to say that sometimes we're blinded by our own skin we can't see past our own mistakes we can't see past their own failures but in behind there my brother and sister if you give it time you are being changed from Glory unto Glory them skins that was once on the badger now he says but now is hiding the glory of God you are hiding the glory of God oh I want to see God I want to I want to come face to face with the glory of God you are hiding it it's within you the the kingdom of God is within you amen when you sh shake hands with your brother or sister look look a little bit further you know we have like this two-foot Vision amen you need to go look right through into eternities and you'll see the glory of God is tabernacled in that man or that woman he says them skins that was on the boundery but now it's hiding the glory of God got it housed up behind it it was on an animal but now it is housing the glory of God before that skin was on an animal but now it's been converted it had to die and now it's housing the glory of God Lord praise the Lord he says now there's nothing in a man or woman right it's what's behind there just want to want to want to uh just nail this one down it's what's behind there how do you know what's behind you behind your skin just go look in in the blueprints how he made you what he made you for what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is what he thinks of you what he's called you to what he calls you you'll find out what's behind the skin greater is he that is in me go read that one once in a while huh greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world them skins my goodness the Skins can be a real distraction sometimes huh he says and so so can your skin be changed tonight to be made a housing place for God where it once just housed mistakes and failures what seems like those things and and what you think is just you know a miserable existence that can be changed to today this morning it can be changed to be made a housing place for God God dwelling in humanity I'm still reading from the message here of brother brandham he says now in paragraph 155 he says look the old Badger skins we find out behind it inside there was the word and that word there also was the showbread The Ark was sprinkled and what was it the shakina of Glory was in there now the word is a seed and it cannot bring forth until the shakina glory strikes it that son has got to be upon the seed the s o n son has got to come and shine upon that seed to make it bear or to make it come forth and that's the only way you take the word see take the word of God in your heart and walk into the shikina glory oh we are standing on Holy Ground you sang it this morning it's so perfect walk into the shikina glory and when you do it'll bring showbread it'll bring Mana that's that's only give for a separated people a royal priesthood amen the only thing that can eat it is that's permitted to eat it is just the people who are permitted and knows it Paul said they're changed from glory to glory so when we are when we say that we are being changed from Glory unto Glory I mean this is the process that's happening the shakina glory of God is shining upon you and is shining a light upon that sea that is on the inside of you that is tabernacled in your skin so much so one one of these days your skin won't be able to contain it amen Enoch is our is our example it was it's so sha in his life so much so that he could not contain the glory of God anymore there'll come a day when the glory of God will shine so bright that Ministry won't be able to speak anymore because it'll be so real there won't be any Shadows anymore won't be any uh uh mirrors or or or anything like that or expressions of an expression no it'll be the thing you will be face to face there'll be no Shadow between the two H it's just like a seed of a morning glory I'm still reading from the message there's so many good things in this message amen the seed of a flower it falls into the ground the seed of corn falls in the ground remember this is what got job's attention this is where he saw something in the flower that flower had a glory to it it had a value and that and it spoke to something and and to me what is incredible just let's just pay attention to what is happening here it's a flower it's just a fragile Little Flower but that flower was literally mirroring job's life it was literally showing forth what was going to happen to job here God has created something from the invisible realm we call it a little flower that dies in the winter and and it goes to to nothing it just dissolves and we we won't be able to find it there might be a little seed in the ground or somewhere and it looks like it has died it is it looks like it's over but in the springtime with the right atmosphere there's a glory in that seat that must come forth why because it's the law of life that's in that seat and that little flower shows that there is a resurrection that there is power in the word of God there is power in the glory of God so that body of that flower was a representation was a reflection to job he was saying to job job look at me I am you I am showing you what's going to happen to you oh my when job said I know my redeemer liveth amen it wasn't just you know it wasn't intellectual there was something happening in him he was being changed from Glory unto glory and what happened they had to go through a terrible time he had to go through great distress loss and and and and and and and and and what looked like failure and people turning against him he had to be betrayed he had to go through this process of refining to do what to show the value to show the glory that was already in his life there's something in your life that God wants to bring out there's a glory in your life and you might say brother Chris why am I being beaten why am I uh you know emotionally physically verbally whatever it is why am I going through these hard trials why why am I distressed why am I being pushed around why do I feel like I'm an elastic being stretched beyond my my my normal conditions my comfort zones why are these things happening it's because God is bringing glory out of your life you might not see it there but he invested something in you he sees something inside of you and that is a piece of himself he's looking at himself in your life and it has to come forth because without that he is not complete [Applause] hallall Hallelujah I better stick to my notes we're on page three of 24 for anyone's keeping count I I'm here till Friday so we got no other plans amen all right so the church has to come there's a morning glory there's a seed of the flower it falls into the ground the seed of corn falls in the ground brother Brown saying this what's the first thing it comes up and it's a little Sprout and then it goes into a tassel then from a tassel back to its original grain exactly what the church has done it come from Luther Wesley now back to the original grain back to its original Glory back to the glory it was at the beginning now I'm I want being very careful to say it exactly the way the prophet says it because what is Glory now he's saying the glory that we have as a church is is is the same as what we had at the beginning oh it's so good but you're going to have to just hang on for a minute the glory we have we've been restored to what is in the beginning remember the Little Flower it didn't come up a tree next time the glory it has it it is restored back to its original Glory nothing is lost nothing is added to we don't have to worry about what's going to happen we don't have to wonder how things are going to play out no it's going to be the same the same amen nothing will be lost everything will be given back amen the resurrection will fix everything that death did amen I'm just quoting the message to you amen that same one so it's the same all right I'm going to skip through some of this so it's the same it's but he says it's changing as it's moving from the East the Sun that Rose in the East it's the same Sun that's manifesting the same thing in the west changing from glory to glory so as that gospel moves is it is changing the bride it is dressing her until one day she will come face to face with the glory of God concerning her all right Hallelujah it changed from the Pagan down into Luther from Luther down to Wesley from Wesley into Pentecost and on and on changing from glory to glory producing the hidden manner something that's inside he says and now it's ripe to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning who's he talking about he's talking about you to bring him back like he was at the beginning his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one it's very important that it's the same some people might say that it's glory and so because it's glory is going to be bigger it's going to be different no it's going to be the same and there's a reason for that it's the same he says the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same holy holy ghost that is manifested today from Glory unto Glory unto Glory this changing is a revolving back to the original okay it is drawing you closer to the real you to the original the one that God has the the picture that he has in his photo album he's taking you back to that you know the prophet actually says he's not just changing you back to when you were 16 178 he not that would be terrible you know when I was 16 17 18 you know I had pimples on my face I was I was sickly I had a I had a chronic cough you know I mean I was not mature he's not just changing us back to when we were SI that's not original he's changing us back yes to young again amen and we will look like this but he's changing Us in other words he's he's reversing everything he's taking us back to who we were in the beginning Abraham and Sarah when he changed them back if he only changed their bodies then they would have had the same problems they still would not have been able to bring forth the Sun but when he changed their bodies they were able to bring forth the Sun so in this changing from Glory he he brings you back to who you are full of Power full of Glory the real you but it's the same that's Redemption that it's finest amen nothing will be lost fully redeemed completely redeemed from glory to glory and is back to the original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same Sensations it's from Glory unto glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him Abraham saw the same I'm still reading from the message now notice we see how it was changed since Calvary we are invited to share his glory I thought that was so perfect brother Isaac just just being open to the the moving of the Holy Spirit and just singing that song of being invited to the table we are invited to this Glory we're invited to be changed amen so he says notice see how it was changed from Glory from Calvary we are invited to share his glory now in 1 Corinthians 12 we are baptized into his body by one Spirit we're all baptized not by one water one Spirit we're all baptized that's right now and then we become part of him okay so in a nutshell that is how we become part of the Lord right is we are baptized now so what is his glory we still got to answer this question what is the glory of God 2 Chronicles 5 14 said so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the look at how these things are connected by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God so there's a season in their in their Journey where they were preparing the Tabernacle they put Badger skins on it they were making it ready for a dwelling place for the lord and there came a time when the Lord looked upon it and he said everything's in order precept upon precept word upon word this bride has made herself ready and at the season of time what does he do a cloud appears and it overshadows this just like Mary you are highly favored amen and he overshadowed Mary to do what to bring glory to her so he comes and he and he brings glory and fills the house of God it is God looking for a place of rest it is God looking for a tabernacle why because that is the whole purpose of this whole things to redeem you to be part of his family again the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God so we see we're going to look at the characteristics of the glory of God so that we can understand what glory is so there came a time when the picture was complete God was happy with the scene and he was happy to come and dwell therein but it's amazing and maybe one day we'll touch on this the cloud was present for this okay I'll just leave that with you Isaiah 40 and3 says The Voice of him that crith in the wilderness we know who this is a prophetic Ministry who was being prophesied of that is going to prepare the way of the Lord it was going to point out who the Lamb of God is amen and so he says prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places made plain and and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed he's going to send a prophet who's going to stand in the waters who's going to reveal why because prophets is the secrets of God come to prophets first right nothing happens until God unless God Reveals His secrets to the prophets so he is going to be there he's going to be standing in the Waterway and he's going to reveal he's going to expose he's going to point to the glory of God I'm just showing you highlights of what is what is this glory of God Amen we're going to just approach it from different angles so we can see what the glory of God is so the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it in Isaiah uh 40 and 5 in the Amplified it says the glory majesty and Splendor of the Lord shall be revealed his majesty who he is now I want you to remember when he was revealed like this not everyone saw it yeah but nonetheless the glory of that vessel the glory of that body would be revealed the prophet would point it out there is the Lamb of God Amen and the Lord the the the we we find a cloud there we find a dove coming out from the cloud and we find this connection between Heaven and Earth the glory of God will be revealed God dwelling in a body again amen all right John 1:14 let's just look at John 1:14 here just for a moment and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld His Glory Hallelujah oh he's just a Man from Nazareth he's just this he's just that no we beheld his glory what does this mean Glory you see what I mean in the worldly sense there's no glory there there's no armies there's no Prestige there's no wealth there's none of these things going on but when when when the scriptures are being written when when it declares who this was this is the glory of God being unveiled you see God's not looking for great pump and and Prestige and great demonstrations of things he's just looking for his own he's looking for his family he's looking for his expression he's looking for his part in you that's his glory that out of the darkness and out of the muck and mire of this world out of the cursed condition of this world that he can bring forth Glory he can bring forth Redemption he can bring forth Deliverance he can heal the sick he can save the Lost he's looking for those who will represent that he is the Redeemer oh and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth in the Amplified it says it like this and the word Christ became flesh human incarnate and tabernacled fixed his tent of Flesh and live for a while among us and we we actually saw his glory in other words we saw his honor we saw his value we saw his majesty what are we looking at when when it says we saw his glory what are we looking at and you know what I mean like you have to excuse me my brain works like this it is terrible because I get to a place like this and it's like okay I'm looking at his glory what am I actually seeing because Glory the word Glory like that is really vague amen or maybe it's just me forgive me everybody here who smart and understands everything just forgive me just put up with me for a few minutes but what does this mean I'm looking at glory we actually beheld his glory so what am I looking at because we Tabernacle his glory also so when we when we understand what Glory we're looking at then what are we looking at in here amen such Glory as only begotten son receives from his father full of grace favor loving kindness and Truth these are all the things he was looking at Exodus 16 and10 says and it came to pass and Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel that they looked toward the Wilderness and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud when they looked at the cloud they saw the glory of the Lord what were they looking at just a cloud no there was something about this Cloud when they looked at it they saw the glory of the Lord It's you see what I'm getting at what is the glory of God what does this mean the glory of God I want to know because I Tabernacle the glory of God you Tabernacle the glory of God but when they looked out there in the wilderness they beheld they saw the glory of the Lord appearing in a cloud that's for another day amen appearing in a cloud and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud which went before them this this is the cloud that was traveling with them through the Wilderness a cloud that follows you around you know normally that that's a negative thing right you have have this Cloud following you around no this was a positive thing it meant protection it it meant identification we have this Cloud following us around amen and in the cloud the glory of the Lord appeared what is the glory of the Lord we'll get there eventually maybe I should save it for tomorrow morning hey brother Ben okay a cloud expressing or tabernacling the glory of the Lord so even This Cloud BEC becomes a focal point becomes a veil becomes a tabernacle for the glory of the Lord okay this is very important as we move forward Christ the brightness of the of his father's Glory the express image of his person appearing in a cloud so okay what is Glory we need to get down to this because I can see some of you are just on the edge of your seat what is Glory when the Bible is talking about the glory of God as Tabernacle in glory what is he saying we have to go kind of back to the original language use right to figure out what does it mean the glory of God this word it is to mean properly if I'm just reading it right out of the strongs here properly it means weight w we i g HT weight for instance this Bible I don't know how heavy it is but it weighs a certain value right and we can measure the weight of this Bible so this Bible has a certain Glory you see where I'm going this Bible has a certain Glory glory to it and it's measurable if there was three pages missing out of this book it would not be the same Glory anymore but you see if it was adding as they were printing this Bible and they were adding pages into it and finishing it and finally you know they were putting on the leather it was being changed from glory to glory until finally it comes to its full Glory it can now be glorified it has reached the exact weight of what it's intended to be it can be measured by weight so the glory is weight it is to literally be heavy so when the Lord fills us with his glory it's a wait just think of Ruth when she was there with with with Boaz in the tent and it was going to come a season when he would would extend His Garment it would apply a certain weight upon her and that weight changed her her position she was now not just Ruth uh you know out in the fields and so forth the the the Gentile you know now she was going to come under his headship it was changing position she was being changed from one dwelling place to another she was being changed from one glory to another because of a weight that came upon her a certain heaviness this this Glory that we feel it is it is tangible it's got a measurable uh uh value to it the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud it's something real it's to make weighty I I I think it's amazing how the the the dictionary here in the in the strongs it says to make self many okay let's move on you can go look up this word glory in the Bible it is remarkable if you move forward a little bit in the definitions it also means wealth obviously you know because that's generally what comes to our minds being carnal we think of wealth we think of prestige we think of of great things tributes or Treasures right Treasures it means abundance wealth treasure but but specifically when it's speaking about treasure and you using the word Glory it is a measurable treasure it is something that has come to us full fullness in Revelations 21 and 24 it says and the nations of them which were saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it it bring they bring their treasure their wealth they bring their tributes into the city now look at this here just to shine a little light on this it being weighted measured second Corinth Ians 4 and 17 says for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory very specific so here's the original you on this side and it has a certain weight right now over here maybe you're just as small right Pretend This a and it's a different just a different weight right but there's a connection between the two and over time right we come through this time sequence this little little dip in from eternity right we come through here and we are being changed from Glory unto glory to bring you out exactly to the same weight you were over here but now if you're going through this process here and you're and you're still you know small like this and you're coming through this process and through this little time sequence this little space of time a little Vapor right just this little nothing but if you come through the space of time these light afflictions these little things we deal with right it's not a big deal right nobody here goes through stress or anything like that nothing is really overwhelming it's it's light afflictions compared to the glory that is here okay so do you see what something's happening there's a comparison so the scriptures when it talks about Glory there's a comparison between the original and where you are now and your destination which is basically back here again right so there's a comparison and is saying that that the things that are happening to us now for our light Affliction this weight so the afflictions we go through also have a glory it is also weighed out it is measured in other words the Lord does not allow anything to happen to you beyond what you can handle it is measured out it is weighed up amen and it is distributed exactly the way it should be amen it is all pled out it's all predestinated it's almost boring I'll be honest with you it's almost boring right because it's fixed in other words it should bring us peace today everything is weighed out everything is measured out everything is so the the hairs of your head are numbered praise the Lord right so some people are laughing at me now so everything's weighed out in this light of Affliction our light Affliction which is for but a moment worketh for us far more exceeding an eternal weight it is changing usen don't be afraid of the light afflictions that is working for out a Eternal Eternal weight of Glory a complete picture full salvation full Redemption full adoption full weight so there's a comparison so the scriptures is is is starting to show that there's a comparison there's there's this expression when when the you know when God is in the invisible realm that he needed an expression he needed something to point back that is tangible so there's this comparison always there's always these parallels running there's always these comparisons or Expressions pointing back at one another like the sun points back to God right but it everything has a certain glory to it do you understand what I'm saying amen so even as as we go through these light a afflictions everything is is pointing us is it is changing us it is changing our expression it is bringing us to the fullness just like Jesus Christ on that day he said now can the son of man be glorify those light afflictions that would come by his way I say that very R reverently that would come by his way it would produce it would change it would magnify it would bring his weight in glory to the per perfect sum of all the Prophecies of everything that was in the mind of Christ it would bring out all the manifestation of everything that was written of him so there's a comparison so when we are talking about Glory think of it like that it's a scale you know the old scales I know the kids probably don't know what these are when we were working in the automation industry we still had to go back to these scales to prove the digital stuff right so anyway we have these scales so on on one side you know there'll be two dishes like this you got this little triangle like so and if you put you know 10 lbs on this side and you put 20 lbs on this side it's going to be off balance right and the scales will tip right so what is he saying the glory that is over here the original Glory he wants you to come to a place where the it's weighted perfectly where the expression is is perfectly balanced across that's why you know legalism in the message that's why these distorted views things like that it doesn't balance out it's something is off and it doesn't bring the right Glory it's not the right picture amen but there's a glory that God brings out of your life and the idea is is to Fashion you to mold you he's the Potter we are the clay he's you're on the potter's wheel on this side and he's making you fashioning you allows a trial to come by this way why because he's taking a little milligram off here and a little ounce over here and a little piece over there and maybe drying it out a little bit more why because he's going to balance it out till one day you see him face to face you can look across the CM and you can look at at the word of God you can look through the word through that Veil and you can see yourself the mystery of Christ revealed is Christ in you but there come a day when we are changed so much we'll look across the table and you'll see yourself in here him it'll be perfectly weighted then this body can be [Music] glorified not sure where we are with time I'll just go on for a little bit if that's okay brother Ben you just you just shake your head or something if okay so it's about a comparison it's about being redeemed back if you are redeemable I mean it's so many things we could bring in here right it's a it's about going back to the original and it and it's not like a digressing but it's to the full image is to be weighted out perfectly to bring the right Glory all right so when when they saw the uh glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud that expression was weighed out exactly with what was in The Invisible and it was showing now in the visible realm exactly what was in The Invisible and it showed forth the glory of of the Lord that expression becomes perfectly weighted it is the same that is True Glory when it is Christ in you when it is the same so much so that when when people look at us brother brandham says it like this he says when they look at us will they see Christ not Chris will they see Christ will they will will we have been weighted so will we have gone through enough trials will we our character have been refined kind enough to the place where the true glory of the Lord can shine forth where it's not about your reputation anymore it's not about my opinions anymore it's not about how I feel anymore it's not about My reasonings it's about Lord what is the expression you want to bring from my life what is your will for me Lord I'm willing to go wherever you want we're talking about invitations earlier you know brother brandham is's a hunter right he was a hunter and he was going down that that mountain and the storm was brewing and he knew in his in his in in his Hunter expertise he knew that that this is bad he needs to get away from the storm he needs to get down into the mount to to back to base camp where it's safe that's the logical thing to do but there was a glory that was waiting for him in the storm there was something about brother brandham that was waiting for him in the storm and it could only be measured out inside the storm there was no way for him to get that Glory or to get that extra gram or to be changed from glory to glory down there in base camp where it felt comfortable where it was safe where it was nice and cozy by a warm fire no he heard a voice that said come back into the storm there was a a voice that called him why because the his maker was refining him and he was looking at the the weight on this side and the weight on this side and he was saying I got to bring you further I got to change you more from glory to glory Come Back Into the Storm come back into The Potter's House come back on the potter's wheel don't be afraid I know everything inside of you wants to run the other way everything inside of you wants to quit and give up and we're weary and we're tiresome and then we hear this voice come up a little higher come a little farther come a little deeper and it takes another dying out it takes another uh uh resisting and it takes another throwing down our reasonings and casting aside fears it takes more faith it takes more stretching but we got to go and take that invit Lord I hear your voice it doesn't make sense it looks hard it looks rough but oh my just look at the Potter's hands it's his hands in the storm that is going to make sure that you're weighted just right so that the life that light that shines from your life will be the exact expression that he wanted from you before the foundation of the world you may wonder why you go through hard times when friends leave you and churches upset you pastors uh disappoint you and and mothers uh cast you aside whatever it may be my brother and sister all these things have been fashioned for be by The Loving Hands of God by his tender loving care his Mercy his grace why because he's weighing out Glory out of your life there's a treasure in your life that is measured out and he wants to bring glory to himself it's him that he's looking at you know come you come to a place where it's like Lord I can't even I don't even know how to figure out tomorrow I don't even know how to take the next step I don't even know what to do just keep walking with the Lord keep trusting in the Lord because the the scales are balancing hallelu maybe we still have too much of ourselves maybe we have too much of ourselves still huh it'll take a little bit more refining to balance those weights and then when the bride has made herself ready oh we shall see him as he is we shall see his reflection in us when they look at us it'll only be Christ the life and I live it's not my own Paul said but it took a refining and brother Brandon goes back into that storm and in the storm oh it's such a beautiful scene in that storm where it was supposed to take his life it changed him that invitation should have should have caused his death but it brought life so much so you can go read that story again if you want to refresh your memory but so much so that what he said he was walking and he says every thought I had was like a young man I was I felt young again and I looked at my himself and he and he was young he was going through a change being changed from Glory onto Glory one of these days we'll go through the same thing it might be an invitation back into a storm it may be a trial it might be some light Affliction but my brother and sister don't be afraid he's refining the weights so that one day the T will come and everything will just be right and just perfect and then you will look and you'll see it's Christ it's you lord it's you it's always been about [Applause] you I am you in that day you shall know that I am in you and you are in me and I am in the father everything will be weighted and the glory you will be glorified but he went through the St more how many he is going to turn down the next invitation not me not me I said Lord give me strength in the trials Give Me Faith Lord give me what I need but I'm coming I'm coming what is in your heart go do it quickly Satan amen go do it quickly now can the son of man be glorified we you see what I'm saying we have control over these things we have power we have authority because there's a measurable weight there's a picture of you before the foundation of the world it's measured out every hair the eye color the way you will be your position in the body it's all weighed out there's a glory there's a value there's a purpose to your life and you cannot fail Hall cannot fail so there's a reflection it's pointing to each other amen Exodus 28 and 2 says and thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for Glory so even the garments that the priesthood of of of that day they they had to wear specific garments the garments were made in a specific way why to signify the glory of the Unseen make garments for thy brother a for Aaron thy brother for Glory and for beauty oh could talk about Aaron's garments because it had the breastplate on there with the names of the tribes and that whole expression of that priesthood was a glory it was a measurable it was an identifiable Glory uh uh uh weight that you could look at and and identify with there's me in that stone there's me that's my name on that stone there I belong to that Tribe of Benjamin I belong to that tribe of Judah and I'm on the breastplate of that it's a reflection of who you are in the priesthood so go and make garments for the priesthood that will reflect the glory they will be for Glory they will be for wait for a balance so when that priest goes in behind the veil he's your representation oh we could preach on that for an hour or two you see what I mean the glory is used for a record it is used for balancing the scales let's talk about woman's hair for a moment huh isn't that beautiful I look at all the sisters here today with their Glory what does that glory mean what do your hair mean 1 Corinthians 11:7 says for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God so do you see what that means now you're a reflection you represent him men you represent God that's why we don't cover our heads because we have a different Glory than the woman the woman has a different Glory from us but it's weighed exactly right to measure or to be a help meet or to be in reflection to mirror who we represent who we have come to know who we are known by for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man verse 15 says but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering so it's measured there's something about a woman's hair when you look at the woman's hair hair it is literally weighed perfectly across the scale as a representation that she is under that man's headship she's under his protection she's under his wisdom she or lack of wisdom under his wisdom under his care under his love amen but that hair is weighed perfectly it's a representation it signifies that she belongs to Somebody That Glory of the woman it is a reflection of your husband the headship of your husband and the husband we are a reflection we have a glory we are made in the image of God and so that represents God to to people here on the earth we are that other side of the scale and then again the woman is the other side of the scale representing the man even though they look different the Moon looks different from the Sun have you noticed how the world is trying to make this all neutral diluted because knows that when those scales are met when the scales balance out everything's going to change and so he tries to take away the glory of the woman he tries to take away the glory of the man whose headship over the W woman amen Godly headship over the woman woman is under her husband's head right but her hair signifies that she understands that she is is a reflection that she sees the measure she sees the weight of Glory in her husband just like the church sees it in Christ amen so do you see this concept this principle throughout the scriptures that Glory means weighted against each other it's weighed against each other you know the Old Testament all the stories of the Old Testament are therefore our example all the laws all the the Traditions all those things are a reflection of what was coming you see how that works now Moses was afraid to look at God in Exodus 3 And1 it says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt excuse me and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush he said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face the Bible says Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God I'm not just making this up this is in the scripture you know we talk about the presence of the Lord we talk about coming face to face face with God and and we we picture this huge Revival this great demonstration of refreshing all those things are fine I'm not speaking against that but I'm talking specifically about coming face to face with God your maker face to face with God Almighty on sacred Sands where to even get there we have to take our shoes off we have to approach him in in humility in reverence with a head bowed so much so that when Moses Moses was a prince in Egypt Moses commanded men and arms and and he and he and he built cities and he was a great man of renown and here suddenly he comes into the place of this strange atmosphere he's never been in an atmosphere like that before well was happening he was being changed from Glory unto Glory the real Moses was going to be revealed the real Moses was going to be on Veil that that measured portion of Glory was going to be weighed in the scales amen and so here we find him coming on the sacred grounds and and and it was so much so that when he came into the presence of the Lord there was the pillar of fire burning in the bush the Bush was not affected by it but he hid his face just like Adam hid his face from God when he came into his presence he was afraid to look upon God isn't that amazing afraid to look and we and we so quickly we say I want to look at his face I want to come face to face with God it's a hard thing we go through these trials we go through the things we face and we almost turn our face right the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down I am come down it's so beautiful because remember who went down Moses actually did but I am come down the Lord descending right we're talking about glories right we're talking about scales and all these things this harmony between God and and man I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites the hites the amorites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth the people the children of Israel out of Egypt so we we see this picture where he comes and he's now afraid to he's afraid to look at God but he is commission there's a commission upon his life that he must go down there I will come down I'm going to go with you I will send amongst them amen we know the story I don't really want to focus so much on the story I want to just hit these highlights of of the journey that Moses was on now first time he goes up to get the law we find this in Exodus 24:15 and Moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mount here again we see the cloud covering a mountain and the glory of the Lord Cloud glory of the Lord right glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount Si and the cloud covered it 6 days very specific six days and the seventh day in the seventh day there's a voice that comes out from the cloud and calls Moses and he calls unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud I hope you're catching what's happening here and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire Paul met this fire on the way to em uh Damascus Amen on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud so now he's going into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the mount and Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights that's a long time to be in this presence in this place Exodus 33 and12 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name God had spoken to him remember these experiences that Moses has with the Lord God is actually communing with Moses with his creation and he's telling him this is the real you this is who you are this is what I've called you to do you thought you were going to do it as an Egyptian uh with the with the armies of Egypt maybe or maybe you thought you were going to cause a rebellion or a coup but I'm going to show you really what is on the other side of the scale who the real you is it's going to be just you and me Moses me and you and the glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount Si sorry um ver uh chapter 3312 and Moses said unto the Lord thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight and therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may know thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people this is Moses speaking to God before he was afraid he turned his face away but trials and suffering and light afflictions has cause them now to look into the word to look into the cloud to look into these things and say Lord Now teach me your ways teach me what my name is teach me who I am in your kingdom teach me how this will come to pass and remember that this nation is thy people he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for where it shall be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight how will the the nation know how will people know that I have found Grace in thy sight is it not that thou goes with us so shall we be separated I and thy people and from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the Lord said unto Moses I do this thing also that thou Hast spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name and he said I beseech thee look at the Turning of the face so Peter when he stood in front of Jesus he stood face to face with him but there came a time where it wasn't just looking at Jesus Christ anymore he was looking through the veil he he looked fully right not looking through a g glass Darkly he looks fully into the face this he looked through the veil and he saw the face of God he saw the glory of God Thou Art the Son of God Amen Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and what happened right it was God revealed that to him we know the story right so here here we see this this sort of a courage that comes up in in Moses and he turns and he and he and he realizes there's more I need to see him face to face who is this that is talking to me what is happening I've heard your voice I've heard about you and you and we've had this journey together so far but the trials are getting harder and trickier and there's a greater evil in the day I I'm going to need more than just the experience that I've had I'm going to need to know you more I need to go deeper with you and so I'm turning my face to the my maker you see what's happening here I beseech thee show me thy Glory show me the weight show me the full measure show me the full mystery unveil to me the mystery that I have in you show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee that should have been good enough and I will Proclaim look what Revelation comes out from the cloud out from this communion that he's having when he turns his face towards his maker and he says show me thy Glory he starts with identifying who he is he says and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious so when the cloud shows up and the presence of the Lord shows up the name of the Lord is revealed so that we can measure him out so we know what our name is you know when a boy sees a girl he's attracted to her yada yada y right and he gets to this place where what is your name right it's important it's an identifier so he turns now it's it's measurable and now I can tell where you are from now I can tell who your family is I can tell your your personality traits because I can see your family right the name says a lot about a person it's a weight of Glory it's a value right and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou c not see my face for there shall no man see me and live o we've re we've hit this like roadblock thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and live I want to see his glory but he's saying that if I look the way it reads here if that I see it if I see my reflection if I see the fullness of him his his glory if I see him face to face he's saying that I will not live that's what it's saying for there shall no man see me and live what does this mean remember we're talking about the glory of God what does it mean to look at the face of God to look at the glory of God we say I want to see his glory well to look at this a little further if you I I don't know where we are in time but I'll just go through this one story we're we're only on page seven see some worried [Laughter] looks right let's all stand up for a second praise the Lord let's sit down all right just be 5 10 minutes I want to talk about Jacob for a second because he said that if we see his face we shall not live this is like a road block and and Moses has come to this place now it's amazing how the Lord um he how he's training his man you know how he is he is he is sanding off the rough edges to make it weight out properly right he he's working on Moses and look at how he does this he he's saying no man can see me and live so let's look at Jacob real quick in Genesis 32 and and 24 and Jacob was left alone that's a good place to be with the lord and there wrestled Amy man with him until the breaking of the day so many beautiful parallels here and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him I mean these two men are are wrestling they have come in contact here's a man called Jacob he's gotone a hold of an Angel he's gone a hold of God Amen in the form of a man he's G he's gone to a place where he can handle God can you imagine that handle God he's he's wrestling out with God and Jacob I mean he is in such a mess his life is is in disarray he's about to meet Esau he's got he's got his his his father-in-law on his back I mean everything is is going against him how is how is this uh promise that is over his head how is this going to play out all these questions may be in his head and here he comes to this place where he's left alone suddenly he's alone oh it's a good place and he and he finds that he is he's wrestling with this man you know God didn't like walk by in the cool of the evening and suddenly you know accidentally stumble over Jacob and and here they are in a tussle it's not no God descended he came down to meet with Jacob he came to wrestle with his creation he came to get a hold of you amen and in the in the form of light afflictions he puts his hands upon you and he starts to wrestle you and and suddenly you feel a little off Bal balance and and and something's happening and and then he's tugging this way and and you think you've got your job all figured out you've got you know your finances all all so well managed and just everything is so nice you know and then suddenly all that is just like you know it's just all out of cater and something's what is that God is wrestling with your life because he sees something in you he knows you better than you know yourself he's looking at the other side of the scale amen and so he starts to put his hands into your life he starts to take things away he starts to move you he starts to the eagle stirring his nest amen he's got his hands in there and you're just you're you don't know what's happening you're just you got a hold of something amen you got a hold of something but through the wrestling something starts to unveil there's something about this man that I am uh that I am wrestling with because it comes a time where it it it says that he touched the hollow of his thigh it didn't he didn't like you know he wasn't like in there and like ripped his you know thigh out of joint that's not what happened the Bible is saying he touched it so here he's wrestling with this this man and suddenly in the wrestling in this process amen of his life this everything coming to this point in this life he he's wrestling with God he doesn't realize fully what's happening but as this as this being as this person touches him he was a man touches him he everything changed and he realized something different about this man amen and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me this man that was destroying him this man that had the upper hand over Jacob Jacob held on for dear life and where we would have let go this trial is too great this pressure is too much there was something inside of Jacob amen there's a glory in Jacob there's something about Jacob he was not just Jacob the Shyer he was a prince with God but he doesn't know this yet but something inside of him there's there's something in in his life there's a glory in his life that is hanging on to God he is connected something keeps holding me and he's hanging on to this man I will not let you go unless you bless me verse 27 and he said unto him what is thy name what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed the balances right the the scales are balancing you are not Jacob the scales are balancing right it's coming up you are Israel you are Israel for as a prince has thou power with God this this is a huge statement we have we have met our equal is what he's saying Jacob you are not you're not really Jacob forget about Jacob you are Israel and I'm telling you you are equal with me you have power with me and what's he saying um he's saying you have a place with me you are equal you come from me you have power with God and with men and thou Hast prevailed amen you have overcome Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore it is that is it that thou Dost ask after my name and he bless him there Jacob called the name of the place panil for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved now he makes that comment because he probably knew what Moses said that if you see God face to face you will die you will not live it's what the Bible says right you will not live but now a man comes and he wrestles with God he comes in contact with God he sees God face to face and he makes this declaration I have seen God face to face in other words though remember what did he say see he got a revelation of who he was that's what he saw when he looked at God's face when he came in contact with God he got a revelation of who he is in Christ that's where the scales balanced amen and he says and when he did this where he should have died or where he should not live anymore it's he's saying that my life is preserved and he passed over panil the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh now he was not dead did God change his mind did did God you know change his rules what's going on here not dead but changed here's the key he was he did not die coming face to face with God he was changed he walked different he had a different name he was identified now as the prince having power with God Jacob in Ty here showing what will take place with Israel the s of Jo Joseph fear feared greatly when Joseph revealed himself to them face to face but there was a revelation and when they should have died amen you see how this now this pattern plays out over and over now where they should have died when they came face to face with Joseph their lives were preserved whereas he had met God himself and wrestled with him in the form of a man and yet he was preserved he could meet his brothers now with no fear of being hurt because he knew who he was in Christ something had changed about Jacob something was different how can you meet God like that and not be the same how can you meet the supernatural Eternal God and not be changed how can you come face to face with God how can you see God in his glory in other words how can you receive the revelation of who you are in Christ and not live differently I'm going to skip some of this here it's it's about Revelations 1:10 where they see him one likee unto the son of man and when he saw him he fell on his feet as dead but remember he was there in the midst of the gold golden candlesticks he is there in the church in the pmos vision he says no human being could stand the full effect of that Vision he's talking about coming into the presence of God right remember Jacob came into the presence of God and he did not die he was changed so that word not live does not mean that you will die it means that you will not live the same way that you have been living now the patmas vision when you come into this Vision when you come the prophet saying when a human comes to the full effect of coming face to face with your the revelation of Christ in you you and Christ no man could stand the full effect of that Vision he even tells the story of how when when he saw that that one right and he saw him from the side like that he could see a man and he says he he when he turned he passed out right his strength he says will be utterly Gone John fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the Lord in love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not Don't Be Afraid John I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more what is there to fear the Judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus see for aurity our eternity our attorney our judge is our judge our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it is finished there is therefore now no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered Both Worlds of unseen and seen not like Alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and knew no other way to turn for further Conquest so he died a victim of sin and righteous living not like Napoleon who conquered all of Europe but finally Was Defeated at waterl and banished to Elba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer this one Christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and has the keys thereof what he loses is loosed and what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there is no conqueror before him and there there is none beside him he alone is the savior the Redeemer he is the only God and his name is Lord Jesus Christ so he says Don't Fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are air too remember we are coming face to face with our maker today all that I am you are air too all my power is yours [Music] thank you Lord the scales are balancing today all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail I should try and close here somewh oh boy let's just close here so let's get back to Moses musicians can come Exodus 33 and 21 and the Lord said behold there is a place by me talking to Moses he just said no one can see my face and live and in this instance though in verse 21 the Lord saying now to Moses behold there is a place by me that's sacred can you can you hear the Lord saying that to you today there's a place by me in other words there's a there's a position there's a there's a a place that only you can fill there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock rock of Revelation there is a place the place that we are standing in today is a revelation of Jesus Christ in us that's the rock we stand on that is our place when we say Lord I want to see your glory show me thy Glory he's saying there is a place for you here next to me we're going to walk hand in hand through this Revelation and it's upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff of the rock I will put you in the Revelation I will hide you in the Cliffs of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see the my back Parts but my face shall not be seen oh my you might say we don't want to leave Moses just seeing the back parts of a man his journey continues Journey continues I'm going to just skip through things here there's a place where if I can find it there's a place where he literally comes face to face with the Lord It's it's called the tent of meeting this is the this is the like a title in my in my Bible it says the tent of meeting you know we have The Shining face of Moses because he was in the presence of the Lord and and and the people could not look upon him because he had been with the Lord he was God to the people and Aaron was his Prophet I mean he had come to such a place of communion of connection the scales were were perfectly balancing and it says here in Exodus 33:7 it says and Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it without the camp far off from the camp there was a a place away from everything the tent of meeting and he called it the Tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that everyone which sought the Lord went unto the Tabernacle of the congregation that was without the camp and it came to pass when Moses went out out unto the Tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and he looked after Moses until he was gone into the Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses entered into the C Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the cloudy pillar standing at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend as a man speaketh unto his friend he was not an enemy with God he was not working against God he was talking face to face we are friends you know you are a friend of God as a man would speak unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle so so beautiful I'll close with this brother Ben if you'll come no man can see my face and live do we understand what this means today no man can see my face and ever be the same again you can never go back to your old life again this is what it means to be face to face with God God bless [Applause] [Applause] you amen praise the Lord hallelujah you remember that time Lord came and
