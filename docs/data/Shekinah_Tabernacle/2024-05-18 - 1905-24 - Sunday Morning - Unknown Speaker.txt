we um read your word and we speak about the things of you Lord as we talk about the Glorious gospel of Christ Lord as Paul said for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it's the power of God unto salvation to the Jew first and to the Gentile we're so grateful Lord that we can come and be a part of this P this such a powerful gospel this morning Lord and we just pray you bless those that can't be here this morning with us and bless our pastor as he way Lord and the different ones that are streaming we just commit the service to you in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord God bless you all how are you this morning praise the lord it's good it's good to be here thank you brother Jimmy um thank you musicians just while you're standing let's turn in our Bibles to Galatians 5:16 brother adaman could I have that other tablet up here please bro Galatians 5:16 says this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the Flesh and that is my whole sermon you know we if you want to live an overcoming life then this is what we do this is this is how we this is how we overcome it's not 10 steps to overcoming or anything it's just this one step here walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh um praise the Lord you can take your seats this morning I want to give my condolences to um brother Ed and his family for the passing of his father that we heard of um this morning you know in some ways we if we were in a different environment we would be very sad which naturally we are sad but we would be very hopeless I would would say more because the sadness that comes with hopelessness that these situations are the end uh unfulfilling there's no hope anymore in the situation when we when we don't know Christ then we think somebody is gone forever then then hope is gone and and and there's it's just grieving to let go but as a Christian we know this is not the end job said though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I'll see God he looks around and he said the the leaves they the tree grows and the leaves fall off and it falls down but then it lives again so man and when man goes in the ground man has got to live again somewhere so so although it's it is a sad time there's a there's a naturally we we separate in this natural world from from people that we love all because of sin that's why this thing happened and yet we have a blessed hope that we will meet again it's not the end that that we'll rise again so we we want to you know go through each other we we go through the highs with the Brethren then we go through the lows and we all have these things in our life we all have highs we all have lows we all have wins we all have losses we all have happiness we all have disappointments and we go through it with each other so brother Ed and family condolences to you and and and may God bless you through this you know it's an evil thing what sin has done this thing Even Called Death we shouldn't have actually gone through this whole journey it wasn't supposed to be like this the human mind wasn't supposed to go through this journey of death and losing and all that we were supposed to actually just be in a place where there's life it wasn't wasn't supposed to be like this we were supposed to just have life and just have happiness and joy and refreshing and and just everlasting life but but the the curse of sin brought this upon the world that that that we have to go through and that's why as a Christian you know we we no matter how much of a Godly and holy life we live we just still go through all these things we go through all these downs and hardships and things we're not exempt from it we just have a blessed hope that there's more to life than this this is not the end this and and this is not my final resting place and this is not the this is not the final experience that I'm going to have we the greatest experience we could have here is nothing compared to the the awesome experience we'll have in glory when we when this this sinful Nature's gone this flesh is gone and we're just living in the presence of God and there's just life that's what that's the hope that we have and that's that's why we're here preaching the gospel right that's that's why we do all this we don't do all this to to have a club but we do this so that each one of you the souls that I that I see in front of me can receive redemption and forgiveness through Jesus Christ and receive the Holy Ghost and be saved and be Eternal that's that's why we're here this morning praise the Lord so um I've got a somewhat different uh way that I'm going to do this this morning and I haven't done this before so it may not work it it will work because it's the word of God but but what I want to do is actually go through Romans 1 to Romans 8 but in a sermon form and I'm not going to do it verbatim word for word although it is quite close to it but I want to I've sort of made it in a way that we can understand because no doubt we've all read Romans we've all read Corinthians we've all read Matthew we've all read the Bible at different times in different places um but some sometimes the the way to really get the essence of it is to go through it and one uh journey to actually get out the the general thought of what it was supposed to be you know even when we preach we might preach on a thought and then we'll take a scripture from here and then a script scripture from Revelation a scripture from Genesis a scripture from Hebrews a scripture from Mark and we'll we'll be speaking on a specific thought you know we be taking all these other thoughts to align with what we're saying and the word of God is like that it's a it's a a very big thing you know we can't sit down and exhaust the word of God and the the concept of God but um this morning I just want to go through it like a sermon so I'm going to go through Romans 1:8 so you're actually going to take the Journey of Romans 1 through to Romans 8 because I believe it's a pivotal uh scripture a piece of scripture that explains what's happened explains who we are explains how we get saved and explains how we overcome it it's it's applies to everybody this scripture Romans 1:8 now you've all read Romans 1:8 yeah yeah yeah but we're just going to go and I tried to make it simple because I want the young fellas to understand it you know if you this is a part this this this scripture is actually I want everyone to understand this because if we anchor this down in our hearts of how we're saved what the Lord's done for us and how we overcome just in a if we really just lay hold of it it it changes our life because we we can walk in more freedom we can walk in Liberty we don't have to walk in under any sort of bondage but we can walk in Freedom and in Liberty because we know for a fact that the Lord has set me free from the law he set me free from these things I'm walking in the Liberty in Christ and I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and we attain that by faith okay I'm going to it's going to seem a little bit dry because I'm just going to go through it like I'm going to read off the screen is that all right feel like a bit of an old you know the old I don't know Catholic priests and that their sermons are sort of just they sit up there and read out a piece of paper you know and but I want it to be full of life okay but I but I don't want to deviate Too Much from the Journey of Romans that we're going to take and we'll get through it in like 40 minutes it's pretty it's I've made it quite fast okay okay you ready yeah praise the Lord let's go I've been called and separated to be a preacher and I'm here today to preach to you the gospel of God the gospel which the prophets have already written about when they wrote For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all this gospel is about his son who as to his Earthly life was a descendant of David but he was declared to be the Son of God when he was raised from the dead through Christ God has given us the privilege and Authority as preachers to tell people everywhere what God has done for them so that they will believe and Obey him bringing glory to his name amen you are part of those people I'm speaking to all of you on Wellington who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people may God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you Grace and peace now let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world Amen and I always pray for you and I'm happy that I'm here with you and I like to be here with you because I like to impart something spiritual to you that you could be strong and that could encourage your faith but also have my faith encouraged by yours I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit just as I've seen among other people for I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the First World countries and in the rest of the world to the educated and to the uneducated because I am not ashamed of the gospel because because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew then to the Greek and the Gentile also this gospel tells us how God makes us right in his sight this is accomplished from start to finish by faith as the scriptures say it is through faith that a righteous person has life for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodly and unrighteous people who would rather promote evil than God's truth they know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them for ever since the world was created people have seen the Earth they've seen the sky through everything God made they can clearly see his invisible qualities his eternal power and his divine nature so they have no excuse for not knowing God Amen yes they knew God but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks and they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like as a result their minds became dark and Confused claiming to be wise they instead became utter fools and instead of worshiping the Glorious everliving God they worshiped Idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles they traded the truth about God for a lie so they worshiped and served the things that God created instead of the Creator himself so God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired and as a result they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies that's why God abandoned them to their shameful desires even the woman turned against the natural way and became homosexual and the men also became homosexual men did shameful things with other men and as a result of the sin they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserve and since they thought that it was foolish to acknowledge God he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that never should be done their lives became full of every kind of wickedness sin greed hate Envy murder quarreling deception malicious behavior gossip slanderers God haters insolent arrogant boastful they invent new forms of evil they disobey the appearance parents they refuse to understand they break their promises they are heartless they have no mercy they know that God's justice requires that those who do those things deserve to die yet they do them anyway and worse yet they encourage other people to do the same now you might think that you can condemn such people but you are just as bad and you have no excuse when you say they are wicked and should be punished you are condemning yourself for you who judge others do these very same things now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth do you think you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourselves that you will escape the Judgment of God don't you you see how wonderfully kind and tolerant and patient God is with you does this mean nothing to you can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you away from your sin but because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's Wrath when his rightous righteous judgment shall be revealed God will repay every every person according to what they've done he'll give eternal life to those who keep on doing good seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers but he will pour out his anger and wrath against those who live for themselves who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness there will be trouble and Calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil the Jew first then the Gentile but there will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who do good for the Jew first and also for the Gentile because God does not show favoritism when the Gentiles sin they'll be destroyed even though they never had God's written law and the Jews who do have God's law will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it because merely listening to the law it doesn't make us right with God it's obeying the law that makes us right in his sight because even Gentiles who don't have God's written law show they know his law when they instinctively obey it even without having heard it they demonstrate that God's law is written in their hearts for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right and this is the message that I Proclaim that the day is coming when God through Christ Jesus Will judge every person's secret life okay now you who call yourselves Jews who are relying on God's law and you boast about your special relationship with them you know what he wants you know what is right because you have been taught his law and also you're convinced that you are a guide for the Blind and a light for the people who are lost in darkness you think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God for you are certain that God's law gives you complete knowledge and Truth well then if you teach others why don't you teach yourself you tell others not to steal but do you steal you say it's wrong to commit adultery but do you commit adultery you condemn idolatry but do you use items stolen from Pagan temples you are so proud of knowing the law but you dishonor God by breaking it no wonder the scriptures say the unbelievers make fun of the name of God because of you the Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God's law but if you don't obey God's law you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile yeah so then if those who are not circumcised keep the Lord Law's requirements will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised in fact circumcised Gentiles who keep God's law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God's law but don't obey it because you're not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision no a true Jew is one whose Heart Is Right with God and true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the Lord rather it is a changed heart produced by the spirit and a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God not from people okay then what advantage has the Jew or what's the value of circumcision then a lot the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God true some of them run faithful but just because they were Unfaithful that does not mean does that mean God will be unfaithful of course not even if everyone else is a liar God is true as the scripture say about him you will be proved right in what you say and you will win your case in court but some Jews will use the argument our sinfulness serves a good purpose for it helps people see how righteous God is isn't it unfair then for God to punish us of course not if God will not entirely fear how would he be qualified to judge the world but some might still argue how can good God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonor highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory and some people even slander us Jews by claiming that we say the more we sin the better it is those who say such things deserve to be condemned well then should we conclude that we Jews are better than others better than others no not at all for we have already shown that all people where the Jews or Gentiles are under the power of sin as the scripture says None is righteous not even one no one is truly wise no one is seeking after God all have turned away and all have together become worthless there is no one who does good not even one their talk is foul like the stench from an open grave their tongues are filled with lies snake venom drips from their lips their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness they rush to commit murder destruction and misery always follow them the way of peace they do not know they have no fear of God at all now the purpose of the law is to keep people from having excuses and to show that the entire world is guilty before God no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands the law simply shows us how sinful we are but now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the the requirements of the law as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago we are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ and this is true for everyone who believes no matter who we are Jew or Gentile for everyone has sinned we all fall short of God's glorious standard yet God in his grace freely makes us right in his sight he did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty of our sins for God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin amen people are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life shedding his blood now this sacrifice shows that God was being feir when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past before Christ was on the Earth because he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time God did this to demonstrate his righteousness for he himself is feir and just and he makes Sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus can we boast then that we have done anything to be accepted by God no because our acle is not based on obeying the law it's based on faith Faith so we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law after all is God the god of the Jews only that know the law isn't he also the god of the Gentiles of course he is there is one God and he makes right with himself and he makes people right with thems only by faith whether they are Jews or gentiles well then if we emphasize Faith does that mean that we can forget about the law of course not in fact only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law now Abraham was humanly speaking the founder of our Jewish the Jewish Nation what did he discover about being made right with God if his Good Deeds had made him acceptable to God he would have had something to boast about but that was not God's way for the scripture tells us Abraham believed God and God counted him as right because of his faith when people work their wages are not a gift but something that they've earned but people accounted as righteous not because of their work but because of their faith in God who forgives sins and David David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it blessed are those whose Lawless Deeds are forgiven and whose sins are covered yes what joy for those whose record the Lord has cleared of sin still with me now is this blessing only for the Jews or is it also for the uncircumcised Gentiles amen well then we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith yeah but how did this happened was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised or was it before he was circumcised clearly God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised circumcision happened afterwards and was a sign that Abraham had already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous even before he was circumcised like us so then Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised they are counted as righteous because of their faith and Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised but only if they have the same kind of Faith Abraham had before he was circumcised it was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world but through the righteousness that comes by faith and if I might ask if God's promise is only for those who obey the law then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless for the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it the only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break amen so the promise is received by faith it is given as a free gift and we are certain and we are all certain to receive it whether or not we live according to the law of Moses if we have faith like Abraham's for Abraham is the father of all who believe this is what the scriptures mean when God told him I have made you a father of many nations this happened because Abraham believed and the God who brings the dead to life and who creates new things out of nothing which is what he does for us even when there was no reason for Hope Abraham kept hoping believing that he would become the father of many nations for God said to him your seed will be like the sand on the seashore without weaking in his faith he fa the fact that his body was as good as dead since he was about 100 years old and Sarah's womb was also dead yet he didn't waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God hallelujah he was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises and because of Abraham's faith God counted him as righteous and when God counted him as righteous it wasn't just for Abraham's benefit it was recorded for our benefit too assuring us that God will also count us as right righteous if we believe in him the one who raised Jesus our lord from the dead amen he was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification yes sir Lord therefore since we've been made right with God made right since we've been made right in God's sight by faith we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ Our Lord has done for us because of our faith Christ has brought us into a place of undeserved privilege where now we stand and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God's glory might I add we can Rejoice too when we run into problems and trials for we know that they help us develop endurance and endurance develops strength of character and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation and this hope will not lead to disappointment for we know how dearly God loves us because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love receive that this morning when we were utterly helpless Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners praise the Lord now most people would not be willing to die for an okay person though someone perhaps maybe might be willing to die for a person that's especially good but God demonstrates his own love for us while we were still sinners Christ died for us and since we've been made right in God's sight by the blood of Christ he will certainly save us from God's condemnation because think about it if when we were God's enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled and made his friend shall we be saved through his life amen GL so now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of Goden okay now when Adam sinned sin entered into the world Adam's sin brought death so death spread to everyone for everyone sinned because we're all seed of Adam now to be sure sin was in the world before the law was given but sin is not charged against anyone's account where there is no law still everyone died from the time of Adam to the time of Moses when the law came even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God as Adam did now Adam is a symbol a representation of Christ who is yet to come you still with me praise the Lord You're Going Through Romans 1:8 now Adam is a symbol a representation of Christ who is yet to come for there is a great difference between Adam's sin and God's gracious gift for the sin of this one man Adam brought death to many but even greater is God's Wonderful Grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man Jesus Christ and the result of God's gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man's sin for Adam's sin led to condemnation but God's free gift leads to our being made right with God even though we are guilty of many sins for the sin of this one man Adam caused death to rule over many but even greater is God's Wonderful Grace and his gift of righteousness for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man Jesus Christ yes Adam's sin brings condemnation for everyone but Christ's one act of righteousness brings a right relationship ship with God and new life for everyone that believes because one person disobeyed many became Sinners but because one other person obeyed God many will be made righteous GL God's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were but as people sinned more and more God's Wonderful Grace became more abundant just as Sin ruled over all people and brought them to death now God's Wonderful Grace rules instead giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord prise the lord well then should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his Wonderful Grace of course not since we have died to sin how can we continue to live in it do you know that all all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death because we are buried with him through baptism through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory through the glory of the father we too may live a new life because if we have been United with him this is just loading because if we have been United with him in a death like his we will certainly also be United with him in a resurrection like his we know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives we're no longer slaves to sin because anybody who has died from sin has been set free amen this is not working come here just stand up for a minute Shake around move around a bit I want you to stay I want you to stay with me can you just get this thing here G yeah I know you are but you know there's some there's there's the part I want to get to us at the end when you go through this you realize it's nothing we've done it's everything that he's done it's just Amazing Grace I can't earn this I can't I can't do anything in My Own Strength my own Deeds to please God all I can do is believe that's right and accept what he's done it's all I can do I don't have any I can't say Lord I've done this and this therefore accept me he's not interested in that whatsoever and there's just it's just he's uninterested you we must have faith in Jesus Christ forgiveness of sin that's the only way we get accepted and but when we go that way there's just this unmar grace and favor and blessing of God that just gets poured out like an abundant waterfall Upon Our Lives just forgiving us and cleansing us and and renewing Us Praise the Lord I've got one back okay move around a bit jump up and down get the yep now you can sit back down again praise the Lord okay I'm going to go back to oh man I'm going to go back to the one before that or did you click on that yeah thank you okay let's go back to this one for if we have been United with him in death like his we will certainly also be United with him in a resurrection like his we know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives we are no longer slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been set free from sin now we are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead and he will never die again death no longer has any power over him when he died he died once to break the power of sin but now that he lives he lives for the glory of God so you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus therefore don't let sin control the way you live do not give into sinful desires do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin instead gives yourselves completely to God for you were dead but now you have new life so use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God Amen sin is no longer your master for you no longer live under the requirements of the law instead you live under the freedom of God's grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace by no means do you realize that you become a the slave of whatever you choose to obey you can be a slave to sin which leads to death or you can choose to obey God which leads to righteous living thank God once you were slaves of sin but now you wholeheartedly obey this gospel we have given you now you from your now you are free from your slavery to sin and you have become slaves of righteous living now because of the weakness of your human nature I'm using this illustration of Slavery to help you understand all this okay previously you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness which led to even deeper sin now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy when you were slaves to sin you were free from the obligation to do right what benefit did you reap at that time from the things that you are now ashamed of those things result in death but now you are free from the power of sin and become slaves of God now you do those things that lead to Holiness and result in eternal life because the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord now you who are familiar with the law of Moses don't you know that the law only applies while a person is living for example when a woman marries the law binds her to her husband as long as he lives but if he dies the law of marriage no longer the laws of marriage no longer apply to her okay so while her husband is alive she would be committing adultery if she married another man but if your husband dies she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she REM marries so my dear brothers and sisters this is the point you died to the power of the law when you died with Christ and now you are united with the one who has raised from the dead as a result we can produce a harvest of Good Deeds for God Amen when we were controlled by our old nature sinful desires were at work within us and the law and the law aroused those evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful Deeds resulting in death the law but now we have been release from the law for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power now we can serve God not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law but in the new way of living in the spirit well then am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful of course not in fact it was the law that showed me my sin I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said you must not cover but don't miss this sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me if there were no law sin would have not have that power at one time I love without understanding the law but when I learned the command not to covet for instance the power of sin came to life and I died so I discovered that the Law's commands which were supposed to bring life brought spiritual death instead sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me it used the commands to kill me but still the law in itself is Holy and its Commandments Are Holy and right and good but how can it be did the law which is good cause my death of course not sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death so now we can see how terrible sin really is it uses God's good commands for its own evil purposes it condemns me because I break the law and yet sin causes me to do it so the trouble is not with the law for it is spiritual and good the trouble is with me for I Am All Too Human a slave to sin I don't really understand myself for I want to do what is right but I don't do it instead I do what I hate but if I know that what I'm doing is wrong this shows that I agree that the Lord is good so I am not the one doing it it is sin living in me that does it and I know that nothing good lives in me that is in my sinful nature I want to do what is right but I can't this is Paul I want to do what is good but I don't I don't want to do what is wrong but I do it anyway but if I do what I don't want to do I am not really the one doing wrong it's sin living in me that does it amen but if I do what I don't want to do it's that's it's a repeat let's repeat it I am not really the one doing wrong it is sin living in me that does it I've discovered this principle of life that when I want to do what is right I am inevitably do what is wrong do you find that amen now I love God's law with all my heart and all my mind but there's another power within me that's at war with my mind this power makes me a slave to the sin that is still Within Me Oh What a miserable person that I am who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death thanks be to God who delivers me through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin you'll see this there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who don't walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit and because you belong to him the power of the lifegiving spirit has freed you from the power that leads to death this is what I want you to get the law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature we we were never able to achieve the demands of the law because there was a sinful nature in us that soon as we knew the law the sinful nature took advantage of that and started to disobey that willingly and try harder and harder to disobey that so the law was unable to actually achieve anything for us it could achieve nothing so God did what the law could not do he sent his own son in a body like the bodies we Sinners have and in that body God declared an end to sin's control over Us by giving us his son as a sacrifice for our sins you'll get this in this one he did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us now the law has no claim over us amen therefore sin can no longer use the law to condemn us amen do you understand because sin that dwelt in US was always disobeying the law so what God did was he came down and he took away that penalty of sin that he he he abolished that so that the law had no hold or claim over us so sin could not use the law to have claim over us because according to the law we were pure and righteous so sin had no claim we were free so now we can just we say I'm free we we were totally free now we can just now we can walk in the newness of life because there's now no condemnation he he went right down to the source God went to the source and broke the source of it so sin cannot condemn us any longer we no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the spirit yeah so letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death but letting the spirit control your mind leads to life and peace I'm just going to preach for a couple of minutes because we we've almost got to the end of that I want to explain this to you so you know this you know this really good there are three powers that we contend with that are in existence in the world there's three powers there's the power of God well there's four but I'll go with the three there's the power of God there is the power of our mind and there's the power of our sinful flesh now all of these three have power in themselves but they all have a a power system where some are more powerful than others our mind just happens to be down the bottom the least powerful the the the sin that works in US is the next powerful and the god the power of God is the the most powerful do you understand so now I've lost my train of thought if okay I'll get it I'll get it back again I be I was I think I could talk about this now let's just let's finish on that let's go with this one here then I'll go back to that for the sinful nature is always hostile to God it never did obey God's laws and it never will that's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God okay but you are not controlled by your sinful nature you are controlled by the spirit if you have the spirit of God living in you amen and remember that those who do not have the spirit of Christ Living in them do not belong to him at all okay so this only works the whole thing revolves around our mind deciding to accept God and then God's spirit coming and living in our life and then our mind surrendering to that spirit and through the power of the Holy Ghost we overcome the power of our sinful nature that's why the Bible says walk in the spirit and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh you cannot be a Christian unless you have the spirit of God living in you you cannot overcome okay so don't think that if you try harder if you fail in your mind and if you if I try harder I'll do better it's not about that it's I'll surrender more to the spirit of God then I'll overcome more that's how you overcome you cannot train this body to be this sinful nature that's in you to be good but remember God's taken away the peny of it there's no condemnation you can walk in newness of life you can receive the Holy Ghost you can walk in his spirit you can just go from strength to strength and just go rejoicing that's who we are as Christians that's what all the Romans 1: 18 is talking about this is what you have is saying you're free from sin you're free from Death you're free from all that he's given you the Holy Ghost you can just walk in the newness of life don't be condemned by anything because God has paid the price of all your sins he's taken all your condemnation away you're not under the law you don't have to do anything to try and please God that's all been he paid the price of his own law that's all been done away with sin cannot accuse you now can't he can't say look you have sinned according to this law because you're sinless then you receive the Holy Ghost you walk in the newness of life and you overcome the works of the Flesh and you live out the law of God by the spirit of God that's dwelling in you and that's how the gospel works that's the overcoming power of the gospel and Christ lives within you so even though your body will die because of sin the spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God and if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you amen and that's why I said here and this I say them walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh am so this is actually this is what we have as Believers we don't have to earn anything we don't have to try hard for anything we just have to accept by faith what he's done for us accept it all by faith don't don't think of I'm a bit better then I'll I'll earn a little bit more it's got nothing to do with it amen there is no way our Good Deeds can ever pay the price of our sin but God and his great Mercy has made a way for us so we do not have to walk around and we do not have to walk around unbelief and ever let the devil get one over on us because that's unbelief and who did who did we just find out that we were we were sons of Abraham and Abraham believed God and he knew that God could a raise people from the dead B make things that weren't as though they were so that's what we have we we we believe the same way so if we we can believe Lord You Raised Me from the dead you make something new out of me the moment we give to unbelief and let sin condemn us that's Satan's got us where he wants us but we don't live like that because we're Believers we never let Satan have that over us we always believe we we're we're creatures of faith you know that and we know that this is the truth because when we look around at the world now we see that the sinful nature of man is hiding just below the mental capacity to control it do you understand that if you the sinful nature of man is so evil but it's it's it's held back by the mental ability to control the sinful nature that's why they do experiments any sort of experiment that they do that for instance why does someone when they're walking down the street are not as aggressive as what they are when they're driving in a car why is that because when you're walking along a street your mind will tell you I'm not as powerful as what I can be there's reasoning why you can't just yell at the person if he's taking up some of your lane you don't just say get out of the way because he might be bigger than you whatever it might be you're less aggressive because you've got nothing there to in your mind you think I cannot do this I can't say anything I'm I'm your mind is controlling your sinful nature when you're in a car whether you're a guy or a girl all you have to do is touch the accelerator and you go faster how does that make you feel powerful you're more powerful you've got this ability now to be more powerful to you know so then the reasoning in your mind you think I can yell at that person then I'll just carry on driving see so the carnal nature can bubble out of we bit now this is I'm not making this up this is facts cuz they see why are people more aggressive in AAR and the other thing was when people can't be seen they get even more evil that's why there's so much smut on the internet people that keyboard Warriors because it's anonymity why because the mind thinks oh no one's going to see this so then this the nature comes out more it's sitting right there at the surface they did experiments where they would have prisoners and prison oh no prisoners and prison guards they said you'll be the prisoners and you'll be the prison guards and it took six days for these normal people to turn into almost animals to these the prison the guards to turn into animals towards the prisoners six days because in their mind they convinced themselves well I'm a I'm the right guy here and he's the wrong guy and I'm in charge of him and they it just they were surprised at how long it took them to become evil evil is sitting right there right there at the surface and and it's it's just bubbling near the top and now we've had it we've had a nice Society because it's been held back by mental thinking of what's right and wrong because there's been Christianity around that's told people in their mind I should do this I should do that this what's right and it's held back the sinful nature but it's bubbling right at the surface it's coming out more and more and more and even that's why when there's a riot happens or something like that it spreads because suddenly in people's minds they think oh well uh I'm just a part of this group no one's really going to know who I am out comes a sinful nature they do things that they wouldn't otherwise do they wouldn't walk down the street and smash a window on a shop front because their mind tells them don't do it it's just them by themselves but when they're in a group and they're caught up in this emotion of it and the mind loses its ability to control the sinful nature what do they do they'll smash that window the same person it might take all of an hour to get to that state even when people you you won't believe this but when people are going to if people are jumping on a bridge to jump off and commit suicide people will start encouraging them to jump and when they do it sort of spreads among the crowd and they're all encouraging the person to jump It's common the police know this so they have to actually get people back out of airshot of the person but it takes one person to do it and then it just all that the sinful nature just why because they're murderers they they our sinful nature is a murderer first chance you give it it'll murder it's just it's sitting right there and and man is trying to figure out all sorts of ways to control it in the society that we live in but the things that they're doing are not working because the because the only way to control it is to receive the spirit of Christ in us and receive a new life the second best way to control it is to be governed by the laws and principles of God in a society but we're doing away with those two so we're seeing carnal nature bubbling at the surface all around and and and now doing things that we wouldn't do before things are happening in society that wouldn't happen before it's what Paul talked about this carnal nature but praise God we've been made free from this carnal nature we've been God has Set Me Free he's he's he's the spirit of Christ that's in me has overcome that I'm not what I used to be ain't what I want to be but ain't what I used to be this this we are the most Victorious people on Earth because through Christ through the spirit of God our carnal nature is subdued it's been overcome and we can and we are totally free from all the penalty of sin everything and we can walk in the uness of life and don't think that God doesn't mind you to young young people God wants to give you the Holy Ghost you just Lord just receive he he just wants that's his whole plan it's that's just like yep that that that there you go all he wants for you is a totally repentant heart and 100% commitment to him I'm going to close after I say this thought but that's it seems to be when you study the prerequisite for receiving the holy ghost that seems to be a the thing that will stop anyone's unwillingness to have a total surrender right because what is the Bible saying here it says we're a slave to Christ slave just gives over all their rights yep I fully surrender now I'm a slave so that's the the only thing that I've seen that would cause someone to not fully enter in is that they don't fully surrender that's the only thing like the Rich Young Ruler he was doing all these things and Jesus said one thing you lack just do this one thing but he didn't want to do it amen other people came oh I've got these houses and things he said follow me ah yeah I will but I've just got to look after my houses first he said don't worry about that come follow me when they had to make a choice they didn't want 100% surrender but those of us that really love the Lord we can say Lord of to whom shall I go you alone have the words of eternal life 100% surrender if you search in your heart and you know that that's in your heart you got it just walk in Praise the Lord the Lord will just pour His Spirit out upon you forgive you of all your sins you just walk in the newness of life it's just the journey it's the it's the tried and true Journey so don't fear don't have doubt don't don't let Satan pull you away from it it's just all there for you just walk in it amen and if in your heart you say Lord I'm going to receive I'm going to accept you with all of my heart just walk in it amen just receive it amen let's um let's um stand up this morning so you just read Romans 1 1 to8 now when you go back and read it again you'll be like oh yeah there it is there there it is there but sometimes the you know when you put it together it says a few different things let's can I have the musicians up let's um let's sing um um give me a d let's sing Amazing Grace my chains are gone and we'll just pray this morning as the mus musicians are sitting up Lord we just thank you Lord for your for your word Lord that for your promises that we can see Lord that you've made this complete and total salvation for us Lord Jesus Lord that that we

Lord those of us that anyone here that hasn't had that that doesn't know you like that yet Lord may they just let go and let you just move in their life or may they may they just totally surrender to you Lord Jesus knowing that you you want us to you didn't make this pathway and then and then make it hard for us to get on the path you just said come Lord come all you are thirsty come and I'll give you to drink of the Water of Life freely Lord we don't have to do any big ceremony or do Penance or walk up a certain amount of steps or anything like that Lord Even in our seat right now we can say Lord I come I accept you Lord and Lord you if in our heart we do 100% then you just come meet meet us right there Lord you you just walk with us on that Journey lord it's such a simple thing to receive you Lord we Just Surrender and just receive you Lord Jesus so Lord if there's anyone here that's struggling this morning with maybe in their flesh they're wondering why they can never overcome why they always struggle with these things Lord and feeling condemned because they seem to always fail in in in their flesh lord it's it's not them Lord It's the sin that dwells in them but there's an answer for that there's surrender to the Lord Jesus and receive his spirit and you'll overcome the things of the flesh you'll become a a new Christian you'll be a there'll be a new life living in you a new power living in US Lord that that's more powerful than our than the sinful nature that's in US Lord so just pray you'll bless each one here this morning bless us as we go away bless the lunch
