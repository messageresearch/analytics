just of that song um i don't know this is probably in 1997 i think that this came out a chap called red matt redmond i think and even though i had a little bit of the lord at that point in my life i was trying to serve him as much as i could and i had this little um what they call service here for christ and at this point of my life i was in the outreach team and we went to amsterdam and holland to to reach out and one of the things that we did was right at the end of the of the red light district or the dangerous district we had a little um cafe um when i say we we we just joined y wam at the point and um there was a lot of bums coming in a lot of people off the street and privatized and people that probably couldn't make it in the first world country couldn't get a job or something like that a lot of refugees and the one thing that they said was there was a double story building and at the top is the is the cafe and at the bottom there's a little basin uh a basement sorry um where we would play all these songs we had a little just a handful of cds back then yes it was cds so we had this whole and on repeat so the the one one commandment the one rule that we had to follow for everyone that's at the top of the cafe serving the people playing chess with him giving them a little bread or something to drink you never talk the gospel you never see say anything about the word anything about the bible you are there you are the bible and that never got real actually up until very recently that this is this is the bible so we had to sit there and we had to we we had we were happy but we we were fed we were you know we we if i can put it that we didn't need faith in that particular instance um because we weren't um in the situation they were so we had to play chess we had to give them a little peanut butter sandwich and make them little tea uh but never spoke the word and at the bottom of all this where all this commotion is going on and and chit chat there was one team so we we rosted our teams so the one team would just be in worship we've just been praying and we had this continuously praying uh playing in the background while we were praying and sort of interceding for that little moment that we had a glimpse it's five seconds you know that you could maybe share if they opened up if they opened up and we left there you wouldn't you would never know we would never know you know one day maybe on that side we will we will see familiar faces god have mercy but yeah so this song was bit on my heart this week and i thought oh man i'll try and share

ed amen praise the lord god bless you each one amen it's great to have christiana here welcome god bless you thank you amen does you feel at home and uh sister louise is here too god bless you amen praise the lord um amen so let's just turn let's read the scripture so we're here as our every month we listen to a portion of a of a message by brother branham and uh we're here on the seventh seal so we're just going to read uh revelations eight and one and um and then we're going to or maybe yeah we'll just read this and then you can um have your seat so this this seal is a uh it's actually the coming of the lord and um but anyway we just read this one verse revelations 8 and 1 it says and when he had opened the seventh seal is the lamb that opens the seals there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and this portion is quite hard as i said the later messages to get a kind of a condensed part because you've got to re-listen to the whole thing but you'll see in this brother brown says it's revealed in a three-fold way and he says i'm going to reveal the first fold of it but he doesn't he doesn't preach the next part of that until he preaches christ as the mystery of god revealed so on this one he says it wasn't interpreted to me because the devil could do great damage if he knew what it was but then a few months later he preaches christ's mystery god revealed so if you want to know what the seventh seal is listen to christ it's the mystery of god revealed right and then now notice when you're listening he mentions this silence in heaven is when the lamb takes the book so all the angels stop everything stops because such a great act is taking place where the lamb steps forth he's been intermediating our intermediary for 2000 years has finally come to step forth to claim that which he purchased that down calvary so just an incredible hour that we live in where the lord is is is purchasing and that's what is happening and trust in your life if there's a pull in your life towards god irrespective of what's going on in the devil's pools whatever but if there's a pull there's a hunger that's the lord putting it in you because he says you are mine and i'll make claim on you the devil can fight all he wants but he's he he has to let go hallelujah so you know and then um yeah so he says so it's revealed in a three-fold way but he only says he and he just makes the comment i'm just going to reveal uh the first part of it but in the message chris and mr god reveal which we'll we'll start listening to next month he goes into what the seventh year is the coming of the lord okay um and then if we just as you're getting that going um if we turn to matthew chapter 24 um we have the seven seals jesus because we know what jesus preached in the gospels was all in seed form uh you know condensed form then the apostle paul different ones they they opened it up um so what john was seeing in the seventh seals is jesus was was referring to in matthew 24 we know in matthew 24 jesus has been shown the temple and everything and um and the disciples say to him you know what great you know goodly stones are here and he says you know don't you know that there'll come a time where not one of these stones be left upon another and then they ask him three questions when will these things be the destruction of the temple you know and the sign of thy coming in the end of the world and he answers those three questions in matthew 24 and 25. now if i just have it here i trust i can find it i'm in 25's go back one more now he goes down and and i won't break it down now but you can read you can read matthew 24 and he begins to reveal what the first six seals are but then when it comes down to the seventh seal he says he says but of the day and the hour knoweth no man this is verse 36 no not the angels of heaven but my father only speaking of his coming so it's a mystery only with god but then it's been revealed in this end time and brother brahm says in the message christ's mystery god revealed it's been revealed in every type and shadow of the believers is revealed down today the coming of the lord because all the acts of the believers is pointing to that great event that's right what joseph did what ruth did what moses did what elijah did all the believers down through the ages were revealing that one great event i mean so so it may seem like um you know when i first became a believer and i got this seals book i thought i'm going to read the seventh seal because i always read the last chapter of a book first and then i was like there's no real answer in this what does this mean i went back to the beginning then as i was going along you know rick christ and mr god revealed that the prophet said this is what the seventh seal is so it's open it's all open yeah amen so and then you'll notice at the end of this message uh he says that uh of this portion that we listen to he says i may be laying a platform for a great one to come now some people have taken that saying it's my ministry but no the great platform we laid for the great one to come was the lord jesus christ himself to have a personal relationship with you and i i mean as john the baptist for on the first coming of christ so the message of william brown was for on the second coming john introduced the messiah to the people right and so the message of brother barum is using the messiah the word jesus christ to the people so it's us and god walking together becoming one i mean so um i trust this is a blessing in some form so without further ado uh technical difficulties here that some praise a lot for the tech team but who's happy to be a christian you know many things are going on in the world but god's in control not one speak of it's out of you know outside his control he knows what he's doing he has confidence in his salvation amen so you know it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do the lord has confidence in his salvation you know you know job was counted he he was considered a perfect man the lord's testimony of job was that he's a perfect man he testifies to the devil he's a perfect man there's no one else like him in the world do you know what made him that perfect man is because he had perfect faith and confidence in the shed blood of the lamb that's what made him that kind of a man i mean so if you and i yeah because that's what made job righteous it wasn't his own acts that were made and righteous as it was faith in the shed blood of that lamb hallelujah and if that is a man under the blood of bulls and goats how much more people under the blood of the son of god amen jesus christ himself hallelujah so his salvation works it's been proved down through the ages amen people went into i'm just waiting for this to start going but you know people walked into fire they walked into torture they walked into lions dens they walked into arenas they they walked into all kinds of trouble but they knew the lord amen would see them through that they would even if they had to give their bodies to be burned or whatever they would die in faith and you think how incredible would it be you're waiting to go until going into the arena remember the anointing was with them they are anointed with that anointing of sacrifice imagine that you know you can hear the lions out there all the gladiators and stuff and and you know would be gathered around you'd say children it won't be much longer and the one we've loved we're going to see him hallelujah it may be the way that by the way this line but we're going to see him holly we're going to go into his presence i mean very soon that they won't be done and we'll be in his presence what a kind of excitement could be in your heart burning amen hallelujah walk into that kind of you think that's a horrible way to die and all those things no i believe is to die in faith it doesn't matter what happens to make us go from this world to the next i mean god has orchestrated it and god has given us overcoming power i mean to overcome every spirit of the devil and brother brahm says the same faith the same faith that the martyrs had to overcome whatever obstacle came against them is the same faith we daily live by that overcome satan's eden hallelujah so we're in a great spot amen amen praise the lord amen it's brother john's birthday on saturday sorry the cat the cat's out of the bag you know you know most secrets i can keep for birthday secrets no sorry it doesn't work but so happy birthday and saturday for you yeah if i don't see you or if you're if you're away on the weekends thank you god bless you yeah god bless you bro so yeah um oh and it's janet yeah i believe is that on sunday sunday yeah we won't go into digits you know yeah okay she's 40. praise the lord amen yeah i'll get dragged into it eventually we won't talk about that we'll brother our mother okay god bless you all so let's just bow he's in the word of prayer and um yeah let's just prepare our hearts now gracious heavenly father lord there's none like thee lord i want to thank you that the tomb truly is empty lord the stone has rolled away and you're alive forevermore and it's not because we've heard someone else say that but we have me we've met you the resurrected lord jesus christ you've changed our lives you've transformed us lord you're taking us from glory to glory i'm just so thankful i'm not the old creature i was and i'm so glad i'm not a patched up reformed person by being transformed by your holy ghost by your grace and lord we know many in the room here oh god you've been we've been transformed by your transforming power and i pray dear god father as we hear this word this portion of this message tonight lord i proud to anchor into our hearts lord mate increase our faith lord faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god lord jesus may you have your way in this prayer meeting we love you so much we just want to commit our lives into your hands lord those who couldn't be here tonight lord i pray you'd be their portion be their strength my lord grant her father we love you so much and we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen you may have your seats thank you brother while we remain standing let's pray almighty god author of life and giver of all good spiritual gifts now we'll turn now to the eighth verse of the or the first verse i mean of the 8th chapter revelation 8 1 i know your time and i just try to listen just for a few minutes now the god of heaven helps we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things fine the things written in the seventh seal book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundational world and every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth it's a it's even the end of time time runs out the bible said so matthew the seventh chapter i mean uh revelations the seventh chapter and one the seven first time runs out angel said time will be no more well in the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the end of the at the end of this seventh seal lord it's the end of the church age it's the the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials and even in the ushering in of the millennium that's on the seventh seal it's just like firing a rocket into the air all right and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those stars exploding blows out five stars from it and then one of them starts explodes goes out five stars submit see it fades on out that's what the seventh seal right and this ends the time for the world it is the time for this it needs a time for that and then it's a time for this and then it's the time everything just ended up on that seventh seal now how is he going to do it that's what we don't know isn't it we don't know it's even time for all these things and the ushering in other millennium notice the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hush-fired in silence for the space of a half-hour is it great what is it it was hushed heavens there was a thing moved for a half hour now half hour might not be long if you're having a good time but in the suspense between death and life it seemed like a millennium it was so great jesus never mentioned it not arrested john couldn't even ride of it no he was forbidden right here see there's just a just he didn't wrap it at this his silence and the four and 20 elders that stood before god they're harping with their harps they quit playing their harps the angels hurst their singing in heaven thank the holy cherubins and seraphims that isaiah saw it in the temple with six sets or three sets of wings three or two over his face and two over his feet and flying and he's day and night there before god saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty and even when they walked there come into the temple the post of the temple move with their their presence and these holy seraphians hushed up angels quit singing flying in the presence of god saying holy holy holy they shut up no angel saying no praises no no altar service no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in heaven for a half hour all the host of heaven was silent for this half hour when the seventh sealed mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke amen the lamb breaks it you know what they were by it i mean they didn't know that it was it just stopped why what is it now none of us know but i'm i'm going to tell you my my revelation of it and uh i am not prone to be a fanatic if i am i'm ignorant of it i am i'm not giving away to uh such as uh lyrius uh carry ons and imaginary things i said some things might have been kind of strange to some people but when god comes around behind it and then the case and says it's the truth then that's god's word may seem strange that way and now uh certain as i stand in the platform tonight i had the revelation that revealed it's in a threefold manner that i will speak to you by god's help of a fool of it and then you let's go to that first here's the revelation to begin what i want to tell you what it is what happens is that those seven thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about john was forbidding to write about it even even write a symbol about it why this is why there was no active in head activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now amen if it's so great it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven thunders i noticed when the seven angels come forth to sound their trumpets there was one thunder when israel was gathered there was a trumpet when times shall be no more the last trumpet one thunder but here is seven straight thunders right in a row one two three four five six seven that perfect number seven thunders in a row uttered not nick is it's one two three four five six seven straight then heavens couldn't write that heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go wrong it's relaxing time it was so great till it's kept secret from the angels now why if satan should get a hold of it you might do great damage yeah that's one thing he don't know he can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift amen i hope you're learning [Music] he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret the angels everything shut up amen if they made one move if i give something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped uh seven god's perfect number seven just right down the road seven thunders utter straight together mike is spelling out something notice at that time john's started writing he said don't write it jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen he said only god would know it amen but he told us when we began to see these signs coming up how are you getting somewhere all right notice we can see these signs coming up me if satan can get a hold of it if you want something to happen uh you'll have to take my word for this if i'm planning on doing something i know better than to tell anybody about it not that person tell it but satan here see he can't get in my heart there as long as god's got it closed up with the holy spirit so that's between me and god he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it yes and i'll try i tell people i'll do a certain certain thing and watch the devil cut off every wheel he can to get in there see to beat me to it but if i get the revelation from god this don't say nothing about it then it's different remember satan will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's trying to do it we notice it through the antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate amen there'll be no mimics to this because he don't know it no way fine to know it it's the third pull he just knows nothing about it i can never think the same the rest of my life when i seen now i don't know what i know the next step there but i don't know what how to interpret that it won't be long i've got row down here when it happened if you can see here stop go no further than this right here i'm not prone to be a fanatic just telling the truth but you remember the little shoe that i always tried to explain how that the soul laid next to so and so on the inner conscience and all that kind of stuff which it only made a big bunch of impersonations start after how did that take up the hand and hold the people had vibration everybody had a vibration in their hand but you remember when he took me up there and said this is that third problem no i don't know amen remember that visions never fail they are perfectly the truth now notice remember the vision of the consolation charlie and i here you are something going on i've told you this week that you've it's been all around you but i wonder if you've noticed it remember the consolation of the vision of the angels when i left cheer to go to arizona you remember what time is it sirs you remember that notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appeared that right one burst of thunder seven angels appeared and i saw the lamb when he had opened the first seal and i heard as it was a voice of a thunder and one of the four beasts that come and see notice one thunder seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day amen at this age see what i mean amen now have you noticed a mysterious part yes of this week amen that's what it is amen that's what it's been amen it's been not a human being a man it has been the angels of the lord amen amen notice there's witnesses of three setting in here that a week ago a little over a week ago i was up way back into the mountains nearly to mexico with two brothers sitting here picking cocker bird or sand burst off of my trouser lane and a flash went off and almost looked like shut the mountains down now that's right i never told my brethren but they noticed the difference and he said to me now be ready go east here's the interpretation of that vision see now to let you know brother sophomore has not got the game that he went after was trying to get it going and he said now tonight for a sign to you he isn't going to do it you must consecrate yourself at this time or the visitation of these angels and i felt beside myself remember and i was in the west the angels was coming east and as they come back i was picked up with them amen remember that coming east and brother fred in here tonight is a witness and brother norman as we went down i almost persuaded that man to stay and get his game is that right brother simon yeah there it stands right there i persuade but yet he said he won't do it i never said nothing went on something sitting on the side of the tent the day that you remember brother simon now as soon as uh some things was being told that i put you in brother norman where's brother norman about there put them under oath that they wouldn't mention what was taking place is that right did i turn around and walk away from that tent like that is that right because this is what it was amen exactly what it was and knowing that i couldn't say it till happened to see if the people understand it and did you notice that one angel i said in there was a strange angel you look more to me than any of the rest of them remember that they were in a consolation three on the side and one on top and the one right next to me here counting from the left to the right would been the seventh angel he was brighter meant more to me than the rest of you remember i said he had his chest out like that it was flying eastward do you remember like that i said it picked me up [Applause] that mother seals meant a lot to me of course but oh you don't know what this is meant amen for one time in life i prayed i cried out to god i i i at that phoenix meeting any of the people there with me no i laid in the mountains one morning i got up and went up in safinia canyon this great rugged high mountains and i went up in there there's a little foot trail if you lead off growing up in the lehman mountain which

around if i'm going i i want this the family think i just took a walk they won't find me hide me away somewhere if i'm going to go away let me go maybe joseph will find my bible in here someday and let him use it if i'm going away let me go hard and i have my hands out and all once something hit my hand now i don't know i can't say did i go to sleep i don't know but if i go into a trance i don't know wasn't a vision i can't tell you one thing i can say is what i just the same thing like them angels was and it struck my hand and i looked and it was a sword real pretty and had a guard over it with gold and the blade looked like something like a chrome like silver is real shiny and it was so feather aid shot on my and i thought isn't that the prettiest thing that stepped my hand i thought that's awful pretty but i said hey i'm always afraid of them things a sword and i thought what would i do with that and just that a voice shut down to the other rock the rocks said it's the sword of the king amen and then i come out of it the sword of the king i been said a sword of a king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one the king and that's god and he has one sword that's his word amen oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and secret the third sent in there when this left me something has come to me and said don't fear now i didn't hear no voice like on the inside of his phone i have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said don't fear this is that third pull third pull you remember he said you've had so many impersonators on this what you tried to explain i said don't even try this remember how many remembers that vision why it's all taken everywhere that's been about six years ago seven years ago and seven years ago said don't try to explain that said this is the third poll but i'll meet you in there that right he said don't i was standing with a a little baby shoe when he told me something make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the lure so then watch your second pull said because it'll only be small fish he said then the third pawn will get it and all that ministers got around he said brother brahm we know you can do it hallelujah brother brown that's where i always get tied up with a bunch of preachers i love people they want you to explain everything just that and i said well uh uh uh oh i said i i don't know i said i'd understand fishing now i said now first thing you do here's what's done you see all the fish around you got the jerk the lure well that's exactly the tactic sufficient so i said jerk the lure nice see when i tricked the lure the first time now the fish takes out hatred but there were little ones that's just like they were catching so then i i said dandy you're set and i jerked it out on the bank i had a fish but it looked like a skin over the lure it's just it was so little and then i stand there and something said i told you not to do that i started crying all the line was tangled around me like this my head was standing there crying with my head down like that i said god oh i forgive me i i'm a stupid person lord don't forgive me and i i had this line and that what i had in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and i had that string was about as big around as my finger about a half inch line and the eyelet in this shoe was just about the size of a uh littler than uh uh 1 16 probably of an inch in the eyelet and i was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch card a voice comes said you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things he said now let him alone and just saying he picked me up he took me up and set me way up high the world meeting was gonna look like a tent or a cathedral of some sort now look there's a little box like little place over in the sign and i seen that light was talking to somebody about me that light that you see there on the picture it whirled away from me like that and went over that tent and said i'll meet you there and said this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody and in sabinia cannon he said this is the third pool and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that i cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third poll coming up amen and the holy spirit of god oh my that's the reason all heaven messiah man now i better stop right here see i just i just feel checked not to say no more about see so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and i want you to know before i even note any word about that that vision come years ago do you remember that and here it is just as this other house slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and god knows my heart i remember one time thought of such a thing as that amen and here it was it's later than we think amen this shows us from god amen for see it fits exactly in the promises of god from the end of the the message you notice notice now for the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but don't say anything about the seven and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible before knowing that and remember revelations 10 1 7 1-7 chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god will be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal now how did i know the other day like sunday a week ago today i was preaching on be humble be humble remember god veils little things i didn't realize what it really was talking about and now i see it it is in such a humble way you're thinking something like that would be revealed to the vatican but it comes just like john the baptist amen it comes like the birth of our lord and the state of the lord glory to god [Applause] we're here oh my how do you see it the truth of god's vision the seven angel bringing me from the west they were coming from the west coming back east bringing here for this message tonight oh my now the voice of that great thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed that it and proven that it was of god the state now i knew not these seals and they've been revealed this week did anybody think of that are those seven angels being this being the message that is coming forth then angels bring me back here for that remember the seventh messenger was the seven messengers was the noted one to me the seventh angel it seemed more to me than anything i see they were standing like this all right we're just watching the north and i was standing here and i was watching those other see one first bunch of little birds feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew eastward and the second bus were brighter bigger birds look like doves pointed wings they flew eastward first full second bull then the next was angels and it's standing right there and this explosion left and i was looking this way towards the west and they come and just pick me up in there and i went out of my knowing and the one of them coming was the one that looks strange to me was the one on my beat the left where i entered the constellation at but counting from the left to the right it would have been the seventh angel okay coming across now remember the seven messengers do you remember the pyramid of white rock of junior jackson's dream that i interpreted you notice the night that i left and i there were six dreams came and every one of them directly to the same thing then the vision started and sent me west junior he was watching well notice look how perfect i'm i'm hoping and trusting that you people realize that i'm trying to put this grace on jesus christ who is the author of all of it and the only reason you never heard me talk like this before in your life amen but this hour is approaching amen amen [Applause] i have to make it sure to you so it can be driven down i'm fixing to leave you again i don't know where i go i must preach the gospel other places but now that you might say i've heard all that kind of fanaticism i don't know why i can't judge any other man i only have to answer to god for what i or for myself but has there ever been one time i ever told you anything in the name of the lord it wasn't right and all these years nobody else can say so because i always told it just the way he told him now let me just show you that this is exactly true and confirm it now remember if there be a spiritual our prophet the lord will speak to him in visions and make knowing about dreams interpreting dreams is that joseph he can interpret dreams and speaking and see visions is that true now notice this that now when this taken place junior was standing in a field that had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something right on the rocks and i was revealing that to the people is that right junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now i took some kind of a bar and cut it off and on the inside was white rock that had nothing wrote on it and at that time i started to the west and i told them all i said don't go out west stay here and look on this until i return went west for the blessed return back to the east with the holy spirit interpreting this unwritten word amen amen now if that isn't personally a god almighty and i want you to know what it is what am i trying to say this for friend is to show you we're at the end now if that others is perfectly on the dot with the word so is this perfectly on the dot with the word we are here we're at the end soon it shall be time run out millions will lose their lives millions will be now believe that they are saved will be counted fodder for the atomic age we are living at the last hour by the grace of almighty god by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing of christ how long brother branham maybe in 20 years maybe in 50 years maybe 100 years i don't know and maybe in the morning maybe yet tonight i don't know and anybody says that you know they're wrong amen now notice so help me by god i tell the truth that these are spiritually discerned to me discerned by the holy spirit and by every one of them has identified its place in the bible now what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal i do not know i don't know it i couldn't make it out i couldn't tell it just what it was what it said but i know that it was in seven thunders other than themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that i see then when i've seen that i'll look for the interpretation it flew across there and i couldn't make it out that's exactly right the hour isn't quite yet far amen but it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that i speak to you in the name of the lord hallelujah be prepared or you don't know what time something can happen now when that gets on tape which it is that will probably send 10 000 of my friends away from me because we're going to say that brother brown's trying to put himself and make himself a a servant or a prophet or something before god let me tell you my brethren that is an era amen i'm only telling you what i seen and what has been told to me and how you you do whatever you want to i don't know who's going what's going to take place i do not know i just know that those seven thunders holds that mystery of the heavens is quiet amen everybody understand it may be time it may be the hour now that this great person that we're expecting to rise on the scene may arise on the scene maybe this ministry that i have tried to take people back to the word has laid a foundation and if it has i'll be leaving you for good there won't be two of us here at the same time if it is you'll increase i'll decrease i don't know but i have been privileged by god to look and see what it was see unfold to that much now that is the truth and i'm sure that you've noticed the things that's been happening this week i'm sure you noticed that little collins boy laying there dying the kingdom of god is coming amen i like this last paragraph here the kingdom of god is coming it's just becoming more from the negative to the positive as has been now that ought to choke people from justification to sanctification of the baptism the holy ghost and then here see amen the lord just becoming more positive all the time amen he says in later messages he's asked a question about what are the seven thunders he says to the seven thunders are the revelation the seven seals so we're not looking for that to come it's here amen the lord is fully it's christ being revealed in this day that's what the opening that's what the opening of the seals is is to reveal jesus christ the word amen praise the lord what a great time that we live in i'm so thankful we don't we we are living in the restoration hour we've been restored to the back to the true apostolic faith that means we can contend for the faith is once delivered to the saints hallelujah amen praise the lord um yeah so if you go listen or read christ is a mystery god revealed he will unfold what he started here because you remember the message doesn't just unfold to you as you walk with the lord it unfolded to the prophet as he walked with the lord right because it's christ revealing himself to you right as you walk with him and it was christ revealing himself to the prophet as the law as brother brown walked with him right so that's why you see there's an unfolding going on so um go listen or read to read christ as mr god revealed and we'll go into that next time next month um but yeah praise the lord see it's the end up of all things i love it how he gave it illustration it's like a rocket going off like a um we can't we can't buy them anymore but um you know fireworks yeah you fire it off it goes boom and it goes flies off it goes boom like this so it's the end of you know it's the end of time it's the end of sin it's the end of the church ages end of struggling nature end of death end of end of the devil hallelujah amen and then finally eventually eternity just rolls on but it's the end of all things and that's why there's such a big rapid change in the world right now as things are winding up the lord is fixing the place and us for us to leave this world hallelujah just as he was there working in egypt for the children of israel to leave i mean so he is fixing things for us to leave in this end time so praise the lord amen um can we have well let's just actually we have a few prayer requests let's change the order of service i'm just going to read these out and if anyone
