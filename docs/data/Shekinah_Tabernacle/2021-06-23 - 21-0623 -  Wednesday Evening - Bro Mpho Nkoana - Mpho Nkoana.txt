[Music] [Music] [Music] green scenes i'm a bit early tonight i haven't been to church in a while so i missed you guys terribly and it's a it's always good to be in the house of the lord and see all

message of our lord jesus christ and what a bunch of fine christian soldiers and brothers and sisters that we have um yeah i've been away for the weekend and all i could think about is it would be nice to see all of you again i actually really missed you guys a lot so it's awesome to see you guys god bless you all from the bottom of my heart it's good to see you amen i miss you guys always i wanted tonight maybe open with a for the psalm psalm 100 and then we will go into a just pray and open up and pray and they will sing some songs so if you feel late to stand or sit or whatever this is your time with the lord make it very personal because if you do you'll get your blessing amen he's a personal god it's easier psalm 100 make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing [Music] know ye that the lord he is god and that he has made us and not we ourselves for we are his people and the sheep of his posture enter into

in the midweek service in this cold weather but is warm in sight amen so we thank you all the musicians may the lord bless you so much for creating such a wonderful atmosphere yes it may be cold outside it may be freezing hands but inside is very warm amen so and tonight i want to tell you that we've seen the messages of the lockdown and everything but we know in as much as we can sanitize our hands and everything but you know there is a great sanitizer there is a great sanitizer and that sanitizer is the blood of the lord jesus christ that sanitizer is the word of god tonight the master chief sanitizer amen that can sanitize your life that sanitizer can clean you for good you don't need to sanitize tomorrow and after every hour it will sanitize you once and for all hallelujah that is the sanitizer that i'm talking about amen so let me just uh look here we then we'll read a scripture then we'll sit down amen we are living in a perilous times we are living in a very difficult and challenging times but at the same time we are living in glorious times we are living in both perilous dangerous disastrous times but we are living also in glorious times that is the situation we find ourselves in tonight and that is the situation that i'd like to prepare your minds and your hearts to understand that we are living in dangerous times it's not a play game marvel's times but at the same time these are the heavenly times which we are living in amen you realize as we go along that the reason why is perilous or dangerous times and is also glorious times the reason is because both the devil and god have brought the best of the best for them both god and the devil have brought the best they have brought everything of the best in these times that is why it's both perilous and glorious time because the lord and the devil because it is the end time you see we are living in the end of the end demonic forces all everything darkest forces are here but at the same time angelic forces are also here so so it is a very crucial time because both sides have brought everything you see you understand that everything when it comes to the end everything when it comes to completion completion huh are you with me everything when it comes to there it becomes very dangerous it becomes very hectic very challenging when you build your house we can start with the foundation everything and do everything but when it comes to the finishing when it comes to the finishings most people they know we can play a game the whole 90 minutes but when it comes to the last minutes we even call them danger times those are injury times those are dangerous times because anything can happen many years ago there was a our country was playing with brazil and we scored two goals before half time soccer now and then we we thought we won the game it went on it went on it went on brazil drew 2-2 we went on 90 minutes just at the last minute at the very dangerous injury time brazil scored then it was three to when we lost because those are dangerous times you never ever relax in those times and those are the times we are living in so that i didn't have a better example but everything when it when it's at the end is usually crucial and you cannot filled in the weakest player you cannot field in the the weakling at the end what am i saying to you i'm saying to you god tonight has brought in this age the best to finish this game and i'm talking to the best right now god has brought the best because god cannot bring the weakling let's redo it we are going to read from the book of um i can't control this one my brother hey maybe gaby can give me that little thing to press um we are going to read from the book of zechariah chapter four and i'll find it here because i've just lost you thank you brother quran thank you thank you man of god okay i've got it on the screen so i believe you trust me hey so i may not have to open my bible because i copied and i copied from here then i put it there amen god bless you so let's read zechariah chapter four verse one to seven just bear with me as soon as we finish reading it i assure you you can enjoy the comfort of our uses as soon as we finish amen let's read it i would like you to read with me in your hearts just follow you you you just put all your thoughts in the lord tonight not on brother and paul because me there's nothing that i can do for you you probably knew that you know my weaknesses you may know my my weak points it may be that we were on lunch the other day and i was in front of you and there was only piece of cake left and i finished it so so you know such weaknesses that i didn't let me leave you at peace so right now it's not time for you to focus on me it's time for you to focus on the one who brought you here i didn't bring you here i did not say go to church and i did not say come and sit here and listen you came by the grace of god and the one who brought you here is the one who is going to talk because he we can all sit down he can use this pulpit to preach so therefore i'm trying to say forget about me we'll talk about the cake later later on amen zechariah chapter four and the angel that talked with me came again and walked me as a man that is weakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see us now and i said i have looked and and behold a candlestick of gold with a ball upon the top of it and his seven lamp and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes or to the seven lamps which are upon their top thereof the two olive trees by eat upon one upon the the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and speak to the angel that to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no no as thou not what this be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who are thou o great mountain before zerubbabel that thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings cryings grace grace and to eat amen let's pray together our heavenly father lord once again we have read your word lord i pray that you bless it i pray that you inspire it lord anyone can open this bible but master it is only you who can interpret it who can inspire it it is only you lord who can uniquely come and talk to your children in a special way lord jesus i pray that you bless us this evening even as you promise in your word that where two or three are gathered in my name i shall be there we believe that with lord jesus we commit this service into your hands in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ i pray amen amen please have your seats finally my introduction was a bit long eh but i know that you've already unconditionally forgiven me thank you so much right now so we oh is it finished oh yeah oh ye thank you god bless you so we we we have read in the book of survival and now we have seen we have seen the title there prior to that slide that is there i've written overcoming power part one amen so so we we're going to take it easy tonight because i'll call it part one so there will be part two part three part four as long as the rapture carries amen and then then then we'll we'll we'll enjoy the word of god how many are hungry tonight i'm very hungry we will enjoy the word of god as it unfolds no rush amen then we'll see up to what part will we get to amen are we right that's that's our title tonight overcoming power one our subject will take not by might not by power but by my spirit say the lord it's not me who said that it was the lord it was the lord in the book of zechariah who said these are the words that came to zerubbabel when he was looking at the candlesticks yeah who who when i say candlesticks and they were burning what do you think of what are you remembering don't you remember the seven church ages don't you remember the vision that john saw are you not thinking of that i'm not thinking about those seven candlesticks in and and there were seven stars in the hand of the lord i want you to think along those lines amen but our topic our title or our heading is that not by mind nor by power but by my spirit but now the question is we say overcoming power we we all know what overcoming power is and we all want it but the bible says no not by mind no by power so so are we talking of two powers yes we are talking of two powers because it's not by my own power or the china's power or any superpowers power but by the spirit of the lord so it's not about what brother paul can do what what what chicana tabernacle can do what our pastor can do it's not about our abilities it's not about what we can do hence i said to you don't focus on me because it's not my power it's not by my training but my ability or any minister for that matter welcome brother marion i missed you god bless you so it is by the spirit of the lord tonight and that's where our focus is i want you to really focus on it because i won't be long we will be finished before you know it amen so let's read again the book of nehemiah chapter four i'll read it for you you can get it in your bibles i don't think you have to display them my brother because what i've displayed there is exactly what is in nehemiah chapter four i'm not lying to you amen he says they which build that on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid let it everyone everyone with one of his hands wrote in the work and with the other hand held a weapon this is during the time of the rebuilding of the temple of jerusalem this is during the the great tough time this is during perilous times of the nation of israel when the jews came out of babylon and they were building a city and the king gave permission of the land of the captivity and they were now rebuilding the city just like the one to do now to rebuild it right those are the hard times so the bible says verse 18 for the builders everyone had his sword gathered by his side and so build it they were having a sword and they were building and he that's that sound that the trumpet was by me in other words if you read some ways one hand was building one hand was having a thought so can you can you ever think about what kind of a time was it can you i cannot remember brother isaac taking a video and fighting at the same time i can't remember doing the vlog and fighting at the same time and i can't remember the ban also building his concrete and doing or and fighting at the same time but guess what it is happening today you are currently doing you are a temple that is being built and you are fighting and you are building at the same time that is possible because the old testament was overshadowing the new testament they were building and they succeeded the lord is building today and he's going to succeed through you we heard on sunday that the lord is not going to come here himself he's going to use you right so today it is happening you are the temple that is being built at the same time you are at war man i cannot imagine it it's just too difficult to build and to fight and it happened brothers and sisters for real they were fighting at the same time they were building imagine putting a brick and then with a sword too and the enemy comes you kick him there and you're building why it was a serious time it was a time of building the temple to restore the temple worship it was that time and that time was foreseeing this time it was a shadow to our time today the bible tells us that we are fighting against principalities we are not just sitting and waiting for the rapture to happen we are fighting amen for that overcoming power to operate we are fighting at the same time that the same time the temple is being built to completion so that a full dwelling so that the rapture can take place so that everything that the lord spoke in the bible can take place so that you can be a fully fleshed overcomer that's what we are talking about this evening are we together that's the thinking to understand that they were fighting and building you are fighting and building the lord is building through you you are part of the equation the lord is not just fighting for you and your city no no you and the lord are in this thing too say together we are together you know so sorry those that are new i like to interact my sister so if you just hear me calling your name please just bear with me because i'd like to make sure that my audience is alert amen otherwise the train will pass on the platform and you you are wondering what happened to the tree amen so i i'd like to to keep each one interactive amen let's read revelation let's do revelation two and three we are going to read various verses but what i want to highlight for you is that where they overcome overcoming can anybody and i don't know what they call it in them in english but you see a patented of the word overcome revelation is a book of symbols you see a pattern of the word overcome is repeated in every verse where the lord speaks to a certain church age or the messenger of a certain church age can you see it i didn't i didn't capture all the verses but i just captured where it brings the word overcometh because there is a power given brothers and sisters for me and for you to overcome today today look where you started the babel there were seven candlesticks daniel saw the vision of the end times the bible says he saw it and he saw that statue right that image right john in the isle of patmos also saw he even went into the preview of the bride are we together so those things we're all talking about this time hebrews chapter 11 or is it 11 or 13 when he talks about his is the faith chapter which one who are my bible readers hebrews chapter 11 at the end when you read it talks about great men and women who fought who were in lion's dens and who were in dances in sheepskins suffering but the bible says they did not see this day and it's the bible says even this world was not worthy of them but those guys they did not see this time but they were yelling and waiting to be here why because this is the very end of the end this is a very serious time and the devil what he wants to do he specializes in a spirit of shallowness the spirit of shallowness make you to think in a shallow or shallow in africa we say shallow i don't know about you here not too shallow when you walk in a little pond and the water just come up to here you say oh this point is shallow it's not deep isn't it it's not deep you cannot really drown in that kind of a pond you just walk past isn't it it's shallow but when it's deep everything can be there amen so the devil specializes in the way of making people to to think shallow when it comes to things that will benefit you in the sense that now we have said we are living in perilous times we are living in difficult and glorious times but now it seems if you you you go around there walking nobody seems to be recognizing or seeing the times that we are living in nobody i was sitting at my office and i'm saying you know what i wish they can just give me a mic just to announce and say brothers and sisters we are living in perilous times do you understand the times that we are living in are you aware that the kingdom of god is nigh i i wish i could tell them i wish i could i could i could use facebook or anything to say brothers and sisters whoa i understand scientists are are confused nature is confused nations are are fearing they are getting more confused they don't know what's happening nobody seems to understand but there is a solution there is an answer provided already and then me and you know it how can that be shallow how can that be shallow how can does that be all it's just all the you know the church people how can that be but let's forget about them do you realize the times where we are do you understand who you are do you really understand or because there's a difference between to know who you are and to think you know who you are there needs to be a revelation a clear cut revelation where your fish has eaten both the hook and the line and the sink everything where there's no other option there was a man in america he was a leader of the indian the indian people and you know he 44 the prophet speaks about him and after fighting his people were dying and now he said i will fight no more forever he took a resolution i will fight no more forever which means you come to a point where you know that backwards never only for what i go and also in italy when julius caesar was fighting with his men they say he crossed a river he took his soldiers and they crossed a river because he was a shrewd powerful soldier and they crossed a river of rubicon when they crossed that river rubicon they burned or they burn their boats and destroy them meaning what you are not coming back for what we go you you need to come to a point in your life where you know that you know that the world cannot do anything to you and you are not going to turn to the left or to the right not a wishy-washy brother brandon calls them dirty weak believer where you are have you ever seen a log floating in the river a big lock and you are amazed how is that big thing floating like that this water must be powerful meanwhile that log is actually empty inside ah in the message how can i overcome that's what we are going to read some of the pieces there the prophet says that lock is so you you you you you know go go go go go it's empty but it looks strong and big it's shallow so we we're not supposed to allow the devil to bring us to that point we have to pray and live our lives in such a way that that demonstrates that we know who we are where we are coming from where we are going both spiritual and physical i'm not just talking about spiritual life where we are too spiritual no including physical things day-to-day things where if i i i i offend my brother or i offend my brother or i'll offend my brother i'll be humble enough to say a man of god i'm sorry to say god bless you and to mean it not to please him no we we those are the things that the devil attacks believers to make things shallow to say oh i'm sorry i'm sorry not not meaning it who do you think you are deceiving god or your brother because if your brother for the spirit of the lord his his spirit will tell him that can you forgive him but he's not asking for forgiveness the spirit of the lord the days of ananias and sapphira safir are here and those were not the shallow days no when we pray in there and you can hear us and something tells you that they are playing and something is still simple voice say join and you don't join why do you want to remain shallow all right best servant of revelation 2 to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the three tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise this was paradise of god this was for ephesians ephesus verse 11 he that overcometh shall not be heard of the second death these are promises these are truths these are not lies these things are going to happen more real than the way you see us now they are going to happen there's going to be a second death but there's those people who are not good going to be affected by the second death those are the overcomers to him perseverant to him that overcome it will i give to it of the hidden manner and will give him the white stone and in the stone and made a new name written which no man know it saying saving he that receives it you know i like what brother ben said everything from the first church age is almost like combined stuck here all the powers the developers pulled all the plugs 250 million demons have been released you tell me how many angels have been released ah and we know our law does not work with that number no our law does not count as one two three million good one two billion no yes you can have the numbers but our our lord weighs us you know our lord weighs us my boy he does not count one two three twenty how we will win no he's a good we can win but he weighs us he weighs the spirit in us that's why the holy spirit is given to us in a measure otherwise if the lord can give you a full full then then you know we are still in flesh we are given the spirit of god with a measure according to the gifts right but everything that is in that little teaspoon you find it in all the qualities brother john are in that little spoon that's your measure right everything combined makes the whole the whole bright the point that i'm trying to say i forgot it is that oh yeah here god weighs us he does not count us he count us but he weighs us that oh this is me this is part of me and it this is just me the oh what exact size that's exactly how i saw andy he has arrived seal him closed packed that one sealed packed that one you know that's how god works but the devil thinks he can outnumber god that is why him he recruited so many and thinking that by taking two thirds he will win god doesn't work like that let's read 26 and he that overcome it and keep at my worst until the end did you hear that brothers and sisters did you hear that friends to him will i give power over the nations dietera all these things up to verse 21 to him that overcometh i will grant to sit with me in my throne who am i to sit on the throne of god i must be someone very important i must be someone very important huh i must be someone very very crucial very meaningful in the kingdom of god despite the fact that i'm an overcomer because overcoming just it comes to reflect who actually you were or you are right but remember we are not saying all these things or we should not be saying all these things with pride because god hates a proud heart you know you know there was a prime there was a a minister some time ago during the first lockdown they put their lock down lock us in the houses and nobody must go anywhere and that minister go to the beach and he's jogging or riding a bicycle and minister you see that man he does not understand his position he does not know who he supposed to be or who's watching or who is he leading there was an ambassador in my country an ambassador is like you know an ambassador you get sent to another country to represent another your country when you are there you represent the just like when you are here we represent heaven heaven is i'm talking to heaven now okay that ambassador wendy now he did silly things and ambassador in the offices he ended up even breaking the furniture on his drunk and everything and ambassador so you see this man does not know who he is he doesn't understand his position he does not know who he represent he doesn't know who he is but his wife's behaving like that so us we are supposed to be like that young man that we were told that when he was in america during slavery he was behaving and conducting himself as like a king a son of the king because back home where he came from he's a king being in america in slavery land or what wherever he can go does not change who he is you are a daughter and a son of god despite all the circumstances despite all the trials despite all the problems despite everything that you went through in fact all those things when they come to you when you go through the fire through the water through everything it's a demonstration that you are a son of god so you need not worry you need not worry about where you came from what you went through and cry no what matters is where are you now and the word is your destination that's what you're focusing on that brother john did not speak to me well no i must not even wait for him to apologize to me already i must forgive him unconditionally without him asking me brother i'm very sorry man you brought you borrowed me your car and i didn't drive it well before he do that i must already forgive him unconditionally and be ready to borrow him again i don't know who can do that if a young man can misuse you know imagine brother cooper the holden and and a young man you borrow them out of respect out of understanding then they go you know i recently i recently scratched the car for the church myself so but that is not on purpose me i'm an adult isn't it the point i'm trying to tell you is that we as daughters and sons of god has not met our culture doesn't matter our race doesn't matter our upbringing doesn't matter our history it doesn't matter our family faith or whatever doesn't matter it does not even matter who your father or your mother is you are a son and a daughter of god they say the word of god your nature that lord the lord has transformed it all those things they become subject to it they become does not matter the only thing that matters is that all those things are part of my testimony hallelujah those are part of your testimony friends therefore nobody can make you do something nobody can make you think otherwise nobody can make you act otherwise no no no you are a son and a daughter and you need to behave like wise and me and you has to conduct ourselves like the sons and daughters of the king the way we talk the way we walk the way welcome mr sorry i didn't see you the way the way we we wear our clothes the way you you can you can say i'm pedantic there's a word called pedentic i'm not pediatric the lord jesus christ said no i did not come to reduce the law i've come to increase it why let me show you but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this one is the house off can you hear me my girls in the front this is the house of correction and you see this is brother i'm talking now this is the thrown off this is the throne this is the throne of god and judgment goes forth from the house of god this is the house of correction sister is this no stephanie um maggie this is the house of correction miguel it is the house of correction whether we accept it or we don't but is the house of correction a minister cannot stand here and be afraid to tell you that no no sister your escape must not be like this no a minister must stand here and say brother marion i don't know what to say right i'm not saying understand the uncorrect people but the word of god must be so free to flow that you can hear that ah i can't wear a skate like that ah i can't talk like this ah brother i can't drive like this and i call myself the son of god ah i can't do those things that's the word of god back on the physical side how can you be good and nice and inspired inside but outside your note outside you are like the world you still play your music we don't even know who sky is that one we need to be believers from sunday to sunday 24 25 hours a day that's how we need to be that is why this is the house of correction and then you'll hear what the prophet says and here is where we come together here we gather in love i should have put that love in capital letters man we gather in love with one another as only christian can love it i was going to keep hands for this only you can love the true love is what you give the world their love is good conditions and limitations because it's got a limit it ends somewhere i brush your back as long as you brush mine i treat you nice as long as you treat me nice that's how the world laughs huh i treat you well because you're my mother nowadays even your mother you disown them or they disown you that's how the love of the world but us we love you beyond your imagination we love you even when you don't love us how many can laugh even if you don't love me but i love you for real not not yes i love you no for here truthfully even when you are alone in your room you confess and say that brother i love him not with us listening to you no no hello that sister i love him yes you offended me yes she grieved me but lord give me 110 percent to love her that's the christian love but in here we we are we are under a leadership of the holy spirit the holy ghost is among us and we are here to be to take reckoning among us recording to see where our short places are our shortcoming and how can we catch from where we should be that's why we are here we are not there to be told no no no no just continue you are part of the bride only not only that yes you are part of the bride yes we are part of the bride we are not going to be told yes michael becker do it my girl you are a daughter of the most high god he's all right now we are not here to brush each other's ego to polish one another that's not what we are here brother benfo we are here to say no pradampo i think you are wrong there my friend look in your brother in the face like this with love not with anger with love and say my friend i think there you go to draw my brother i want to show you something what paul said here what the prophet said but i i mean not the scripture but i feel that the way you are speaking to me is not approved of the weight so why do we shy from doing such things in new zealand i found that ah people mind their own business sort of i don't know if you should say we are passive oh yeah you know you can't you can't i i i go into a bus every morning and then every morning i see three girls every morning i see three girls two of them are siblings one i don't know if it's a friend or is a relative but they know each other so every morning they're there the one who's alone is eating her chips she's eating her snacks and she's so mean to the other two every day i see it she's so mean she he shows things that i can't even show in the pulpit to them he just walked on the pavement the little girl is standing there she just walked she just she just hit and bumped every day the little girl just moved for her the other big girl there's the same height the the bigger to that one she's trying but you can see she's dominating on them she's got a spirit of dominance and wanting to to bully them every day so i have to think of my ways as a parent as a christian how can i help this girl and i knew that i can i can touch a very dangerous area because i may i may find the parent of this child at my gate coming to tell me because this is laodicea the rights this is laodicea no more the times where i can correct debbie and say michael come you never ever speak to brother ben like that okay never ever this is the last time okay my girl never otherwise the jew is gonna come to my house so this morning the lord just laid in my heart i greeted them they say hello all the three of them hello hello hi and his cold is freezing it was cold she has freezing i say yeah then i saw her doing that again then i say i just walk next to them i say hi tell me something then she listen attentively tell me i said to her why are you always mean to them oh you know what that girl i saw blood you know on his skin i i saw a tiny rain he did not expect me to ask such a question now the little girl was so excited she was so happy to say oh you know what this must be an angel and the big one was just quiet she didn't know where exactly am i coming from so that that one never answered me she just was she was just stunned i never reprimanded her i just asked a question why are you always mean to them he never said i'm not he never said nothing he just became red and you know when someone is trying to and they can't talk so we need to be able to get to a point where we correct one another with love and show one another and and not take it personal afterwards you who is corrected and you who are correcting if you don't receive the correction and you don't give it you're both guilty did we know that we are both guilty because you can say your brother is in the wrong you can see your sister is in the wrong but you're not telling him with love and there's still small voices telling you how is he going to overcome brother i didn't preach to someone he said we are the people who are the source of giving eternal life and eternal life starts by me living for you you living for me i don't know why i'm going that route i'm going there because of that quote this is why we are here how can we catch from where we and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now we are where we are and this is brother brennan's english story and where we ought to be in that message how can i overcome he says you've got to be no no no no that's a different thought but the point of that that quote about that i read those two paragraphs is that when we are absorbent to the correction of by the word of god we overcome we get to a point where we overcome where it's easier for us to overcome unlike when we are we are we are protectionists you know protectionist is someone when you say um brother ben you know this shoes no no i know oh brother ben i was just saying yesterday i i know i was just saying yesterday i was greeting you you didn't see me no i didn't see that's the protection defense defense mechanism hello bradampo how are you feeling today i heard that yes i'm fine i'm fine you see without even hearing what the brother wants to say you're already defending defending what because the brother hasn't said anything the sister hasn't said anything yes yeah sometimes we don't even say it without our mouths we say it in our hearts we in our hearts we already say ah who does he think he is in our hearts who does marion thinks he knows too much who does he think he thinks he can tell me okay sometimes we don't even say it with our hearts we don't say it but we say it with our actions our actions our hearts if we are brave enough we say it with our with our lips we express it we say i know you no no you can't tell me you beg in my country they'll tell you no no you can't tell me i'm saying good morning what's wrong now this system greeting yourself here that's how we express we are different but i said at the beginning our culture our upbringing our way of doing things our family our everything brother andy told me that every country has got his own spirit that's what the prophet says and the chief demon of new zealand makes people to be like that so that when you meet another one who is inspired or or who is anointed by the chief demon of south africa there's a conflict but we are above those things us oh sorry we are above those things oh what a cramp just help me lord jesus amen in the name of jesus christ satan you have no right to put amen amen amen are you okay sorry sorry i'm sorry i'm very sorry about that brother i had very bad creme i hope this is not only youtube oh that was painful oh i don't know where that came from but i know that the devil is is playing games help us lord jesus amen that was very painful i never had one like that i won't move around amen can you continue you can unpause please unpause amen the enemy is not hating he's trying everything even yesterday two days ago he tried very very hard to disrupt me from bringing the thought my internet everything went down i was battling but i know that the enemy is a loser and i know for real that i am an overcomer i know that you are an overcomer i was so blessed yesterday when brother fedo was preaching i watched that same one he said even when you fail the lord looks and says that's my son and he picks you and help you he knew the end from the beginning so there's nothing that takes the lord by surprise i need to hurry up right so i just thought i should pass that one just give the devil a bit of a knock there so that he can know that you are not cheap you are not just human beings and we need to teach our children and our children's children the same that we are sons and daughters of god confess it and leave it look at it this way brothers and sisters if the muslims and the lutherans and the buddha buddhists and the monks can take their religion so seriously if they can take their religion so seriously to a point where some can be crucified you hooked with things on your flesh that's a spirit operating if the catholics can can give themselves that i am not going to be married i will live for the catholic catholicism and i'll be taken there for the rest of my life if a muslim can a a fanatic muslim can say i can swallow bombs and be exploded for allah if they can do that me and you believe that everything is managed or controlled by a spirit now what are we doing until the prophet of god said no the minimum you can do the minimum is to read your bible every day and pray every day and read listen to the spoken word every day there's no we cannot just go for the minimum esther you know that was it you can't just pass on the minimum all the time the minimum there's a chance that you can go below minimum if you do that the devil can pull you down to the minimum below minimum so we cannot we have to if we cannot do that every day we have to cry really cry before god because you see the devil has planted this world and everything in such a way with us in mind he's done everything with us in mind to to fine-tune everything and set it up so that we can fail that's how the he he set up everything so that the so-called believer of the message of the hour in the end time he cannot take minimum he attacks you even if he sees that you are a weak one because why the bible says even the weakest believer when he or she prays sincerely god moves the weakest believer the word if you consider yourself to be weak tonight even you when you pray with all your heart yes amen sincerely god moves so that's the powerful promise let's read that one let's read that portion did i put here okay we have already read here so i want us to read revelation think on my on my computer i'm not corresponding i'm together now revelation 3 verse 19 says as many as i love i rebuke and just so be zealous therefore and repent you have repented but when you do an error when you go below below minimum the lord is going to correct you why because the lord loves you we cannot reject correction to a point where it's hard for the pastor to preach here certain things in church no we cannot bring the spirit of new zealand or the spirit of africa or the spirit of india or the spirit of south korea here we are not in new zealand we are in heavenly places in christ jesus we are better than that ambassador or the minister who when the rules are given he goes against them a leader so we understand the type of a calling that we are called and our children must understand no negotiation some may say i'm too strict but god does not negotiate with the devil god does not sympathize with the circumstances of your time you must come to church only three conditions the prophet says if i'm not mistaken when you are sick or when you are waking or when you are dead i think i've edited that one but but you cannot stay home and say no no i'm not feeling i'm feeling tired tired tired brother oh no i'm no no pen comes early that's why i pick on him he comes regardless so you you can't say oh you know i think the traffic is gonna be dragged i don't feel like phil come on no brothers and sisters let us take god seriously let us understand that our calling and i'm not saying coming to church will make you an overcomer but it's part of the process because we are not uh forgoing the gathering together because he brings this leak of fire he's liquor fire his liquid fire and all the liquid fire that's why they were gathered in the upper room when the tongues of fire came and that has been said from the beginning of the church ages until today and it will be like that until the end an effect prayer a available we heard on sunday here that a heaven prayer what is your favorite prayer what is a heaven prayer what does paul mean when he says pray without ceasing what does he mean what does he mean the prophet when he says read the bible and pray every day what does that mean it means you must do it every day whether you feel like or you don't feel like you must do it because you understand your calling you understand who you are that you are caught you are you you have responded to the mark of the high calling the mark of the high calling is not just a law calling no no brother sisters i'm trying to pull those that are still struggling with this let's get it clear we cannot allow the circumstances of the devil nowadays that he has set up to control and manipulate us if that is happening which i understand it can happen to me to you to everyone but we cannot allow it we have to resist with an equal force oh no the best opportunity you get you kick and you pray so hard that the devil will know that weak he won't come near you take control of your circumstances and say hey i am going to pray until this thing leaves god i'm going to cry the problem is that you don't cry we don't cry the prophet says if that little issue that was in the chicken coop never cried if it never lived when the mother said just leave a little bit just leap what would have happened to it all it needed to do was just to leave a leap and the mother picked it up ah because it was not sure what is it but it knew that it's not part of the chicken but it didn't know what it was but the day the mother screamed and he said yes my daughter revelation started to brew so we need to to clear these loose ends the prophet calls them loose ends we need to clear them before we overcome remember this is part one this is part one we need to clear these abc's this a b this r a e o the vowels we need to clear them that hey so that our the mark of the high calling can take is full manifestation in our lives otherwise we're not going to be talking heavenly things and top stuff when we can't deal with the abcs when we can't deal with attire for our sisters attire maybe i'm saying it too hard i mean attire wearing clothing and we say no no i grew up like this it's my culture my culture that's how i was brought up but it's not a problem the prophet said as long as it's below my knees yes he said it but what does your heart say what does the holy spirit say in your heart are you arguing with it i won't go there too much brothers and sisters that's not the same one the same one is let's clear the abcs for us to be overcomers let's clear these things off i don't know i don't know i can't talk to him i'm not like that no that's not our culture excuse no no no no which college are you talking about a key one no we deal with the problem oh is that the culture the culture that i know heavenly one is that saying that i must talk to you with a humble spirit not with my country arrogance all my country robustness that i'll deal with you know that's that's not heavenly i'm just comparing those i'm from south africa or somehow and then you're from so i'm just using those as examples but i think you'll see the picture that i'm trying to bring some of those abcs have to be got written off as many as i love i rebuke and i trust him he's zealous and repent you have repented and you may be amazed why is brother talking about repentance there's things that the prophet called loose ends that creep among us to a point where the spirit of the lord gets offended and things cannot be preached as they are supposed to someone can get healed someone can get delivered because you are holding things against someone what against yourself against yourself that's how this enemy is able to do to make you hold things against yourself or against your brother or to think that way when god is thinking that way no let us release ourselves from the enemy amen we find that every time there is a rebuilding and a transformation or a renewal or a revival of the temple like in jerusalem when nehemiah went the revival that when they were building the temple there was a great turmoil there was a great war there was a tough time they were fighting and building we find that every time there is a renewal there is a rebuilding there is war we find that it happens like that we find that today when there is a rebuilding of the bride there is war there is tough time that has been the nature of this life that has been how god prescribed it and it's going to be like that that is why if you read these verses of overcome those ones that i was reading after every one of them the bible says he that hath an ear let him here and he doesn't say they that overcome it doesn't say they why it's not a group thing he that overcome she that overcap i'll give him a rope i'll give him a stone return a name that only him he knows he that overcome he or she that overcome we are we might be individuals but we know we form a body in some other parts you're going to see as we come to different parts of overcoming what comes out of overcoming what bri what overcoming brings or what brings overcoming when you come to those stages you will see what i'm talking about you'll understand that we are a body we are a building these stones are the ones that are building this building are we together we also found that israel was not always having upper hand in most enemies or challenges this is why i'm reading throughout the bible you can read it appeared as if israel is going to lose who would have thought that sangha will hit all those 600 people who would have thought that david will hit goliath huh who would have thought that joshua will just go around the walls and then the holes fall now it appears as if you are getting defeated today that's how it looks like agreed is a song a great means isn't it there's a song that says it may look like i'm surrounded but i'm surrounded by you it may look like the reality is not you are not surrounded by the enemy for to defeat you that's the reality throughout history even now today the whole world is going to be against israel the physical israel they are going to be against it you see but what is very good about this whole fiasco is that every time israel wins overcomes amen every time israel wins every time read the bible you can go read the bible you can read history of the inner chronicles you can read the war you can read every time every time israel wins yes and you are the spiritual israel you every time israel wins israel has got the technology that some of the countries in the hallway don't have where does that come from israel as we speak all the borders of israel are surrounded by his enemies you are here in this world you are all your borders are surrounded yes are you not israel today you are israel you are surrounded but do not worry about who's surrounding you the prophet pray that god opens your eyes and in 63 he came on sunset mountain he revealed everything and he came and he hold us and you know when when when a husband hold the wife like that and he he took us like this huh he took us like this and then we marched that's what he did in 63 he came and the prophet said eliasa he married us to him that is why there's no fear of who is around us jahazi realize that oh i'm with the prophet of god and these are the angels he saw because god opened that i mean elijah prayed that god can open his eyes today brother brandon prayed that your eyes can be open for the scripture of revelation 10 7 has been fulfilled and all eyes for the bride are on full alert right we also find the same thing in life of a believer that's what i was trying to tell you fight for every inch of the ground towards transformation there is a battle every corner brother every corner my friend so we can't expect to say what what why why is this thing happening to me no and he did all those things the lord he allowed them so that ephesians chapter 5 verse 17 27 can be fulfilled so that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot nor wrangle he does not want a wrinkle i don't want a church with a shirt with a wrinkle in new zealand sorry my colleagues just come with rainbow shares they don't care they just take your shirt out of the basket and wait even me i'm getting into that behavior nowadays because i'm in new zealand you just take your shirt and no he didn't go to work just i started putting a jay-z and i see i just end the caller and i see a guy called john proudly walking with him and wrangle this must be how things are done here man it's not a problem when you are in rome you do what the rumors do but but the point i'm trying to say is that he wants a straight clean iron church without spot because he's a spotless god and you he has made you you have to believe it brothers and sisters friends you have to believe it you are without spot or wrangle if you see any spot and the devil is telling you you must know that he's a liar i told you before i said even if the devil can tell you something that is he he says to you this mic is standing on the pulpit he's telling you huh he said this mike is on the pulpit say devil you are a liar who is he to tell you the devil only one person you can tell him who are you not your brothers not your sisters not everyone only the devil tell him that devil get deep behind me i am the one to tell you this thing is sitting on the pulpit not you because you are a liar you want to say sitting on a mic only on a pulpit that's how he works be careful of giving the devil a an ear no hear only the lord for he said he that have an ear an ear for what to hear the word of god not the devil the devil is not to be listened to even if he speaks the truth for he cannot speak the truth he's a liar and a father of lies that's how the devil is and and we need to approach him like that with no questions with no debates now we move to this one i'm finishing and over karma is not someone who thinks he can make it what did i want to say here an overcomer is not someone who thinks he can't make it sorry it's not that i made a mistake there an overcomer is not someone who thinks he can't make it just put there for me please there no that's not how an overcomer things an overcomer is someone who is fully surrendered sold out to the lord sold out when we say something is sold out we mean the stock is finished there's no more stock there's no back orders to me it's it's sold out when when a woman loves her husband and she's not fully sold out you can see that ah even the way he talks to her to him huh even the way our sisters must talk to their husband right isn't it brotherhood where's the gender our sisters our sister said you must talk to me like i'm her husband sister christine sister shannon sister bruno each one of them all of you ma they are my mothers i love them like that but they need to talk to their husband exactly how the bride will talk to jesus because the bible says this thing of marriage and we marrying our young people marrying them we are happy he says yes we are doing that but it's actually it's not it's more about christ and the bride that's what you should reflect and we brothers we must love our wives to death to be ready to die for them in reality to my sister that if something comes there i can stand and say no no for you to come in here kill me first before you can go in that's how our sisters and our brothers married should be we shouldn't find but sisters say no no no no no means me sorry n a it means me zulu is mina isn't it brother you can't find your sister sister christian say no no me i was even my father i was answering her like that i was answering him sorry even my dad i was answering him like that that's why i'm answering my husband like that sister we are not talking about your father no we are not talking about how you were brought up we are talking about how the bride should answer to christ that's how a sister answers to same with children we'll come to a time of children it's part of this series if the lord give us time we'll talk about it the young people see them even if they're in canada we talk to them with love respect i know i'm preaching to the converted but i'm just reminding you i'm reminding you that my dad and my mom is still my dad and my mom even when i'm 90 years old and the respect there's no respect for zambia respect for tanzania respect for malawi respect for serbia europe american respect kiwi respect no respect is respect honor your father and your mother amen love your husband and respect him talk to him like like you will answer another husband who comes to the house of someone else you find a sister talking to another husband so nice but the husband when we are not there come on don't do that i told you ah who are you talking to your head are you talking to your head but you brought them for comes oh god please i don't mean you do that i'm just warning you that those things the bible says they must not be found among us they must not even be heard among us young people who are going to be married you have been prepared if they're lord terrorists young fathers who are going to be married you have been prepared that's how we talk and respect our our spouses spouse they're just being refreshed isn't this the landing which has been refreshed this is also referring to me if i can tell you this and but i go home and i shout my wife or i don't respect her i i must not even come here i must sit out there and repent first because the prophet said every minister who stands here is going to answer before god every week that he speaks to the people and that's a very risky position to be that is why one must be careful prayerful before i come here before i say yes brother ben i must be very careful am i talking to the bride of god or i'm talking to people that i think are my friends do i know who they are if i'm asking you to know who you are do i know who you are as a minister preaching that is why i'm not just preaching is the lord talking to you and to me whether i take it or leave it that's the bottom line and that's how the position is for the lord jesus it will receive the very elect if it was possible so close the people so leave people can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers and liars gamblers he says people can not do those things right they live about that and still not with it what the prophet is saying here is that we are not talking about gamblers and people can can live a better life than me and you on the moral side and still not have the holy spirit still not have the overcoming power people can do that people can still live do those things better than me and you and i still haven't overcome him still not having overcoming so it is about the life of christ in red there this is the age of life personal life of christ personal life of christ in other words i should live today the way christ will live had he been here on the earth physically when he was here physically when he was here physically he gave everything they said it was so simple to a point that if he was among us here you could not even know him that's how the lord was may god help us maybe i should stop here so that we can come and continue next time you must know who what why how to overcome and those will be the parts of some of the areas that will tackle as we go on next time very very new put your focus concentration efforts on the right things all the time your efforts your concentration everything that you make an effort for in your life get approval of the lord does the lord want me to wear this or does the lord want me to buy this car does the lord want me to buy this suit is it the will of the lord for me to do this by this i mean both sides when i'm talking about this putting focus concentration efforts on the right things what i mean by that is that when it comes to god and his children let all the glory be to god don't you find people who want to be pompous people who wants to be known and i've said this before people who putting respect and i'm not saying we mustn't respect one another but we mustn't over elevate each other and we mustn't under elevate each other there should be just a walk in the middle of the road when when we tend to be men pleasers and also proud ourselves those are the settings that the devil puts on earth and he makes them our habits and he makes them as if we own them and we fail to realize that those things are not ours when it comes to the devil and all his works learn how to separate and distinguish between your brother and the devil must be you must be have that wisdom that tells her no it's not your brother talking like that it's the devil it happened in the bible the lord jesus said get be behind me satan do you think he was talking to peter he was not he knew how to separate between satan and the devil i must know when i interact with a believer that if my brother there he was a bit stumbled and had a big circle to incorporate him amen so otherwise it was going to be a problem for joshua he wouldn't have known that captain and he checked who are you and he said i'm the captain of the house and he knew so you must always check who are you what are you doing what is this why is this thought coming to my mind question it amen so that's how we need to do as believers we found that god always had overcomers but each one of those special had a special work and this is now the basis of how what i'm going to talk later on when you talk about the building when you talk about you as the stones of this great building is those overcomers in the bible noah abraham joshua david esther rude hannah nehemiah paul the list goes on and on and on why because each one of them was a stone in this temple each one of you is a stone and i don't expect the stones you see the stones here they are not the same they may look with a pattern they may look nice but each one of these stones is unique if i take this one and put it here and take this and put it it can't sit they have been made for that spot serpent and corner for each one this one small one here that you can't even see or this one it can't sit here yeah and this is me and you and you know what we are precious stones specially cut all we need to do is the lord to find a spot for us where we sit in that great building and you sit there you know you don't even need water you don't even need mortar because even the thinnest blade can go between those stones here because it's not a perfect building i i i can't even put glue there it can go but with this perfect building of god some stones we'll talk about them sepha onix all those beautiful stones you know gold by the way we will be working on gold us in heaven us will be working on our streets will be gold i don't know about the the lions what will they be used but the streets will be working on gold see this thing looks like gold it's not even gold but we will be working on gold a road made of gold we'll be working on it just think about that because you're called with a high calling let me conclude there that you are an overcomer this will be the fruits power to surrender the power to love power to fellowship the power to create an atmosphere the power to forgive the power to know yourself the power the power the power the power this is the power that we are talking about and this will be expanded as we go along at least you can go home and make a long list backer about this power amen and then we will finish off by reading ephesians chapter four till we all come in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ until we get there that we henceforth be normal children toast to and from and carried about with every wind of doctrine with every wind of talk with every thought let's talk about you as an individual with every thought every activity every action creates a reaction from you no let's not talk about the church let's talk about me as an individual that everything causes me to say ah i thought he loves me maybe he does not love me everything even if my brother is just coughing so maybe he doesn't like me that brother am i not being a child being tossed and fro yeah yeah we shouldn't be there we should be mature tester we should be to a point where when my brother comes i say yes god bless you my brother you are just coughing you are not referring to me if you are referring to me already in my heart i forgive you a child of god is someone who works on autopilot a child of god is even better than this cast that you drive an auto they are not auto because you must put it on auto ask the spirit puts us on auto we are flying above the atmosphere of the of the earth we are above we are no more having to be started every morning warmed up raved like silver fish how many no silver fish silver fish was my car for me and mario so so we are no more there we are above everything we are above everything hence no be no more children toss to and fro i want to individualize this because when i say winds and doctrines it's like a church no i'm talking about you as an individual my wife told me something very powerful that that that christine told her previously she's not there he said you know when someone do something wrong to you in your heart you must respond as if they did something good how many had this when someone does something bad worry to you and say why we to you and to you you respond as if they said god bless you your response is as if they said to you hello god bless you but meanwhile they said to you can you see what i'm trying to say how many understands me so you you don't respond by saying hmm back no you respond as if you say ah forgive them forgive her she does not know what he's doing that's how a believer responds because our lord jesus showed us when they were busy nailing him yes yes when they were busy spitting at him this is not a joke they did it today if i can just by mistake spit at you by mistake just passing and i talk and i spit at you are we your grandmother in america sorry if she's still alive she will know that i spit at you by mistake my girl it was a mistake i was trying to talk and a little bit of speed spit on your cheek you send there was a message to a granny day in america the way you are so angry but they're not jesus they spit it on him on purpose and they did everything and what he said was forgive them how can you answer that's not normal to answer like that it's beyond normal not below it's not abnormal it's beyond normal and that's where we are today me and you when you talk to me the way that is not right on the canal side i answer to you the way that is powerful above canal brother man [Applause] hallelujah can you say amen to that i'm not saying you mustn't get angry you can't get angry but the sun must not sit while you are still angry the sun must not sister lydia isn't it before the sunset you should be smiling again and if a beautiful smile like that amen so let's uh close the dm by reading that verse how many wants me to read those three verses then we are finished can i read it can i thank you so much that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine and a false doctrine it's not just what they stand there and preaching and no no efforts that think the enemy can bring it to you a wrong thought a wrong action around any action anything resembles the doctrine of the devil because you if you do it which means you believe the wrong doctrine of the devil a lie of the devil by by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking you but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ so you are very important people i'm not joking that's why i'm not mincing my weight you are very important people who are powerless but yet very important the lord was so important he was so powerful to a point where when they were busy doing all those things he said forgive them that's that's why we need to come even christ verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted you know what is compacting brother benny you are in construction when we compact something you know you compact it we use a competitor the whole day even when you go to bed you are still cheating it's compacted this road that they made yeah they use a competitor jointly fitted competitor that this road can last a hundred years they can make those rules how much more a believer the love that this body is gently fitted together and compacted i would like to see the competitor of the lord how how how we are so gently fitted into others so compacted we will be that no piece of devil can come in between that's what he's talking about there that's what he's talking about there compacted by that which every joint supplies you know when things are not joined and compacted this joint is trying to supply this one but because this one is not compacted there's a leak here because there's no compaction it's not joined are we laughing each other so much that brother ben can chew a chun gum over the marion or brother john and then give it to me and i chew it [Laughter] are we loving each other that much spiritually yes spiritually yes spiritually we must love each other to be ready to die for one another no more just your husband your children know your brothers and sisters to die you are so compacted that even when we are sleeping you know we are so compacted by that which is if every joint suppliers according to the effectual working in the measure of every part it's a strong language man now i've never had english like this there's no way you can go and check all the philosophy all the philanthropy all the books philosophical you can't find a language like this this evening a theologian can't understand they have to go and be taught how to become a professor and still not understand it because this comes from the university of hallelujah [Music] this is come this comes from the faculty of jaira the school of heaven that's where it comes from ah even a professor can't understand this of theology i mean if i say from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love the prophet says huh the prophet can't get it but you you already get excited because you you know the language the language talks to you let's turn on our feet can you stand i would like each one of us to think about this overcoming power we're just laying the foundation that maybe one day if the lord is willing we can expand the thought further and see other areas of this overcoming power that does not come by might or by our own power or by any national power or by any human power but this overcoming our power this overcoming power that is inside you the overcoming power is the reality of who you are today that's the overcoming power we are talking about and you have it and the devil wants to make it a shallow thing and that cannot be allowed that cannot be accepted not in this lifetime not in the life to come you have to defeat the devil everywhere on air on the road on the ground in the sea everywhere he must be defeated dead or alive that's how the devil must be defeated amen so we are going to take this with us think about this overcoming power think about it coming becoming a reality daily you as an individual you as a person why we need to think like that the spirit of god must find a freedom for the gifts that were promised to us and to this church and to the churches of the living god they must come to pass brothers and sisters why am i talking like this because time is no more we now are not be supposed to be still on the abc's no we are not supposed to we are supposed to have gone past an unbelievable stage and make deliver stage we are supposed to pass so that we can brother andy can come here and teach us and tell us how our heart is jerusalem and that temple is being rebuilt today those are the teachings that we need that's the real message of the deadpool those are the things right we we want to move to a time when the preacher finished preaching and there's prayer and worship praise and worship that a prophecy comes and say brother sorry and so go and make right about this and this and this that said the lord you will be healed that's what we want that's what we want we want the times to come where the the gifts will come to grief that will be operating among us as promised remember this church was promised so a prom god never promised and not fulfill he promises and he fulfills and he will fulfill keep on confessing and the prophet says keep on confessing it it shall come to pass to you to your children and to everyone that you love that said the lord everything that you love i'll give it to you because he knows that you cannot love the wrong things he knows amen i would like each one who wants this overcoming power fully let's be reverend before god we are going to pray together but i believe that the little ways that are spoken here the lord will re-preach them and you will regurgitate them and the lord will place them properly in your heart as we close our eyes maybe musicians should come and just softly lead us into this prayer we are going to lift up our hands and god is going to answer because god knows your need god knows your desire god knows what you want and what you need and the lord is able enough to give you what you need you don't know what you need now you know you know that you don't know what you need therefore ask god to give you to know what you need did anybody hear me if you don't know what you want or you need you don't understand where the problem is you don't understand where the solution let alone the problem god can make you understand that situation to god is nothing as we are bowing our eyes our heads and closing our eyes before god this is the truth this is the word that the lord is talking to you today that yeah he o israel the lord your god is one he is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not and he'll give you what you need may the lord compact us in his love today as we bow our heads there's a prayer request for brother stephen there is a need today for brother stephen that you and me are supposed to pray for and that the answer must come because god promised that when we pray and we believe he will answer you don't have to know him you don't have to be with him but you have to pray that god will heal him are we together if there's a need in your heart if there is a desire if you have a burden or you want the lord to give you a burden lift up your heart lift up your hand tonight bowing your head and closing your eyes before god in reverence and god is going to answer your need today today [Music] what is going to answer your needs today the devil won't overcome you today but god is going to give
