very much for your prayers really appreciate them hey Meena we are we on let's just go to the scripture just just quickly you know I was having such a wonderful time over there and then they are thought of all of you but man I miss home as well you know but let's go to Exodus 33 and verse 18 I mean you could just leave it up here Exodus 33 and 18 I mean they mean when we do our there that's what isn't the Lord wonderful amen and he said this is Moses speaking to the Lord and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I'll make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee before thee and I'll be gracious to whom I will be gracious and I'll show mercy on whom I'll show mercy thank you Lord for showing mercy upon me hallelujah and he said thou cannot see my face or no for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said Behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the cleft of the rock and shall cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I'll take away my hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face thou shalt not be shall not be seen now we understand in this day we've seen the face of God but I want to emphasize how the Lord says there is a place by me and I'll sit and thou shalt stand upon a rock I mean this is though he's a little bit of prayer gracious lord now change the gone Lord you took them away we're free praise your name we're free glory Lord Jesus you want to thank you nothing can hold us here Lord Jesus we're Free People law and we'll hear your voice and we and we'll walk with you and shall we not because you'll take us our God Father just want to give you praise this night lord thank you lord so wonderful to see the purchase of your blood laws that have gathered under this roof father to see the mighty workmanship of your hands standing in front of me Lord what a sight to behold and Lord when we gather with the Saints of all the angels around your throne Lord what a wonderful time that will be your lord I just pray father's I share the testimony Lord of what you did I just pray that you'll receive all honor glory and praise though we know that no flesh and glory in thy presence and but we know it's only you can save only you can deliver and only you can live Lord and do what you do so father I want to commit the service into your hands probably might be a blessing Lord and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen and then god bless your friends you may have your seats so there is a place by him and he wants us it's for his bride to who to stand stand the a me and upon a rock you know there's the rock of Revelation now so this is the country of Papua New Guinea see if this works this is north of baby we'll go here so this is Australia down here this is Papua New Guinea over 800 that's it's got the most languages in the world about 8 million people that they know of does not ever get born in a hospital you know it's all bush very third-world but anyway so I went up to Goroka here up here and then brethren from so these all through timbu here and then past he must came from Rebell so it's premature National Convention everyone came this is where I so I'm just gonna show I just got a whole bunch of photos ah I got a lot of video but the video doesn't really work in PowerPoint maybe I need to take the call sport you know this is a guest house I stayed in the doc Hut that we stayed and brothers as better than that but there was good accommodation good place to sleep and yes I praise a little time this is this is some of the believers so it's very it's very very third-world you know the power cuts out most of the day the only running water to the settlement is a pipe that comes out of the hill I'll show you that later you know here's the sisters they're shooting up coconut this is the kitchen thing is like I say they have nothing but they're happy be content you know they don't have the stress and the like us they have something that the first world needs to be content with what they have you're not ashamed of being how they are they're happy they're at rest they're at peace so praise the Lord so I'm just going to mention a few people as we go so this is you yes anyway I'll just I don't want to so this is to here I'm not really gonna share this at a linear fashion but anyway eight people got baptized one of the sisters that got baptized here and she stood up after the next day after the baptism and she said after she got baptized and she got changed and she went just walking around the markets the people who weren't believers they said you're shining you're shining you see difference in her so here's rejoicing we were rejoicing I mean I told the people up there I said I'm going to show photos of you through the Brethren in New Zealand and I'm gonna tell them you're gonna embrace these people one day and there won't be a language barrier hallelujah and then we'll be dancing around the throne hallelujah amen hurry to God so so here's that here's the kitchen so open fire they cooked all the meals on an open fire amen and but they're happy food was good man tell you what I got feed it was like when Christina went up so not here but another part of Puffin your guinea for a honeymoon and and they said to us are you putting on weight that's good they're fattening us up but so so welcoming so happy you know so good to sit around and talk with them and hear on the phone so here's the face this is past a moss from a bell if you know the mr. money when my parents used to live in in rebel I met the Lord had a burn to share the message with with the people up there the message hadn't gone to that part of the country yet but of course barely them speak English and the Lord just came down he said not by power by might but by my spirit and the Lord supernaturally got ahold of my my parents house mate who witnessed to the church up were hears they all came into the message and there's a message it's there but it's all just the sovereign God you know so anyway here's so Christina no this is others this is bully beef on rice and stuff buy big piles of food look that's that's that's that's one one portion they got here eat this hospitality but the food is good man I didn't have any trouble with my stomach with this kind of food I come back to New Zealand the stuff going crazy so been fed anyway okay here's a new site I know this is Wellington so I need do this but these sandwiches are sup body into us like man this is good what's in it lettuce egg tomato peanut butter yeah think about it think about it mango and coke but anyway it's on the side but but but very welcoming people you know they just it's just so nice you feel at home you know it's so so so great anyway so here's the so this is us driving in the you tower the settlement and there's a little pipe in here see all these people are gathered round with their gallon drums to pick up water there's a pipe coming out of the hill that's the hole there's the water for the whole settlement sometimes at work sometimes it doesn't work but they're happy they're not stressing in at all worried about trying to keep up with the Joneses and all these things this is the so pastor Robert who's the host pastor I'll show you a photo of him I said ah I need to go get some firewood for the kitchen I saw oh come I'll come for a drive so he went to the city dump went round the end of the city dump all this firewood to pick up so these these are these woman here are looking for like coke cans with our recycle them for like a kg of them for like 50 cents New Zealand but they're happy they're not all stressed and worried and you know they're they're contained it's just how they live you know you're not in a rat race you know everyone's happy friendly okay so this is this is one of the meetings so this is the church do it floor with some lino on the on the ground no seats it ones just their sisters but yeah the hinders but this is on one side brothers on the other all they all the children all all the picking a nice sitting up on the corner here on the ground heavy though you know just you know yeah there's a bit of trouble but yeah it's pretty good then they go to sleep when they get tired so this is the here try and find a bit of photo of he was a sister of one of the brothers that came from from another part of the country she is Catholic and she came to the came to the services I turned up so that I was there Sunday so I preached nine services over the time I was there but after the Sunday night service oh I handed this note and and I don't know who it was from but but she she wrote this note and said it basically to me you know when you're preaching about Ruth and you're preaching about Rahab and you know I could see you talking about me the service was for me and she said I'm a Catholic I'm a sinner I'm lost but I need the Lord anyway she she came to the Frank got prayed for and she got what she needed hallelujah so so she came and lost but went out found hallelujah praise the Lord so um few of these people in the back here are visitors from the settlement as well but a lot of these people gathered from all over the country so here's so here's so these so these this is a small church from a place in Jim boo and so this is the pastor it's brother cop see that brother now the message is quite new in Papua New Guinea about mid mid to late 2000s about 2006 this brother he was telling me his testimony he went to his his why his sister's place and so his brother-in-law so sisters her husband he had a copy of the prophet visit South Africa and this was back in 1991 and so he went to another province met them picked up the book and he said it just impressed his spirit was like Jesus Christ all over again he was amazed so he stole the book from his brother sloth and an ear ear he read it for the next 20 years couldn't find any books contacted voice of God obviously got lost in the mail somewhere you know but he read there for 20 years one book mr. mowett when he said it just spoke to him like nothing else it was a pastor now one of the Pentecostal denominations as well so it's not like he came out of the world and then in 2000 about 13 there was another brother who I'll find the photo of and he was doing some outreach in the local town and and he was using one or Romilly whose charts and picture brother branham on it and so when we and brother cops he saw the photo brother branham he said you know he said to brother Anton come to my church I want you to tell me about this man he became a believer lester's then and there he left his denomination so you know I'm out you know cuz there you can't just leave Church you you know it's a battle you know it's a battle just you can't just quit yeah they won't let you go but the bride has to be let go I mean so just think about 20 years province Africa but that's all ahead but it quick and you know that's what I say cast your bread upon the waters as the Bible says it'll come back to you you know the wood has a life of its own you know sometimes we get a worried how we're gonna witness how's this going to work out God will do it we we serve a supernatural God
