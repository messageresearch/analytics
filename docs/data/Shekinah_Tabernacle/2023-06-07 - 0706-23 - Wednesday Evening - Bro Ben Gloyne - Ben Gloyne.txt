thank you [Music] as a as a musician's play if you don't mind I will read you a little thing from a little scripture from Matthew 6 a very famous scripture in the Bible where from about from verse seven downwards it is describing the Lord's Prayer to us and I was last Friday very impressed by what comes before that and just reminded again and I wanted to to read you just verse 4 and 5. and then from there I want to jump just to a quick uh summary of what what brother Branham talks about that Matthew 6 verse 4. that then arms might be in maybe in a secret and thy father which seeth and secret himself shall reward thee openly and when they pray Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites that are for them for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward that's very how um how the Lord spake that and then from the a little quote from inspiration now Elijah laid beyond the bed upon the bed and was resting and then the Spirit came to him and said go ask this shinamite woman what we could do for her for all this kindness now if you want to find a favor from God be a favor to God come to him if you're a sinner you want to be healed come first and give your life to him come first if you're a if you're just a church member and want to be a Christian come first to Christ and then can be

Lord amen so we're just gonna gonna turn to um I'm gonna turn in the uh turn in the Bible too uh we're gonna read from First Corinthians 15 and we're going to read verses verse 57. got a few scripture readings but we're just gonna so I think I remember I think brother Ed ages go kind of preached on these same kind of lines about you know how we pray from victory you know we're in Victory now we have the victory you know we've won you're on the Winner's side you know we've won so we're just gonna we're just gonna go through these things and um just to you know remind us that God our lord Jesus has given us the victory so First Corinthians 15 and verse 57. get it we just take this one and you can then we'll open in prayer but thanks be to God which give us give us us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ thanks be to God he's given us the victory who believes that tonight Hallelujah amen let's bow he's in a word of prayer amen Lord Jesus I want to thank you you've given us the victory Lord we didn't earn it Lord Jesus we didn't apprehend it in our own strength or ability or how smart or whatever we think we are Lord or don't think we are Lord you gave us the victory Lord that's the main thing and we're so thankful father we can stand Victorious Lord no matter what's going on in life the situations we're facing the battles and trials we may be in the very midst of Lord we still have the victory so I pray dear God as we have a prayer service tonight Lord we know really every service is really a prayer service but fathers we have this time Lord God we come together and pray for various needs Lord I pray you'd raise our faith Lord Jesus may you reveal to us the position you've already placed Us in by the power of your blood Grant it dear God may we just

meet every need here as well father in Jesus Christ name amen amen God bless you might have your seats tonight so we have the victory you know it's amazing when we read the Bible he's going to read a couple of scriptures and I trust this will make you real happy if if we go to if we go to uh Revelations chapter 20 now I can't remember who said this I think it was maybe brother Donnie Reagan or someone but I think it stands quoting we we have won but yet we fight like we're losing the devil's lost but he fights like he's a winner it's really you know we should fight with one so we should fight like we're winning and we've won right but many times we fight like we've lost or we're losing but we've won yeah because the Lord Jesus has given us the victory but the devil actually if he was honest for a brief second he would say he's lost but he still fights like a winner let's just read this I like to I like to um you know it's nice when you tell people where they're going to go Revelations 20 and verse 10. I like this because I I can't identify myself in this scripture I trust you can't either I mean and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be taught me into day and night forever and ever that's a long time by the way oh yes the devil reads the same Bible we read he studies this Bible he's you know he he's a very studious student of the scripture and of the message and if he was honest he would say this is where I'm going to end up so you know if he is honest you say yeah I've lost you know and it's amazing when we go back so let's go back to Revelations 12. um and we're going to read from verse 7 here because you know it's incredible when we think about the Lord but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ we have the victory now we're going to read from first John soon that that that it's our faith that overcometh the world right so this great battle we're in we've got to realize we've won you may be in a trial right now you've won right you've got the victory in the trial right you don't have defeat amen you may feel like you're defeated but we're going to really change perspectives you know if we could really just focus in and see actually we've won because the Lord Jesus Christ has won the victory for us praise God Amen doesn't matter what comes or goes troubles trials whatever more we've won we're not defeated see the only discouraged being on the planet should be Satan and his demons because he's lost Time After Time After Time After Time but then he comes back like he's a winner like he's a champion but you know and then and then we get discouraged and we withdraw within ourselves think how are we ever going to get through these things but yet we read the same script the devil reads right his part is not our part but he's reading like he's reading our part because he's because he thinks he's a winner right but our part says we're a winner his part says he's defeated but he doesn't act as role like he's defeated he acts as role like he's won but many times we act our role like we're defeated Revelations 12 and verse 7. and there's war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not we could just dance around the church right there Hallelujah work is the same God that he he was defeated by in heaven is upon the Earth defeating him still amen the devil was defeated in your life amen when you gave your life to the Lord and the Satan got dethroned out of your life Christ came into your heart changed your life what happened the devil did not prevail there was a war in here Satan got cast out like got cast out there he lost again he's got a very bad track record man I would never get this guy to be in my Army you know you think because normally when there's different campaigns like World War II different things they would pick the right field Marshal of General to lead the campaign you don't pick a loser to lead your armies you want to win right you don't want to man how are we going to fix this defeat now you don't want that kind of a guy you want someone who's who's who's Victorious he's got a track record he knows the capability of his weapons right so you'd never you'd never hire the devil to be your general because you're loose you'd be the one that you anyway you think about this so there's war in heaven uh Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the powerless Christ the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuseth them before our God day and night and they overcame him I'm glad we're in this this is a good scene to be part of Hallelujah I can identify myself because I'm I'm I'm part of the day I trust you can say that you're part of the day they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives and to the death Hallelujah so yeah I trust we can we can look in the scripture see see it's amazing when you think about it the Bible so the Book of Revelation many times will take Revelation is 12 here and in a way it's kind of in the future this but it's now but if we could say and they overcame him so therefore the the the impul the devil that we're fighting right now we've already overcome right we've already conquered our Lord's already conquered no I I I'm going to labor this you may think you're repeating yourself but I think if we just look at we're in Victory it doesn't matter if we're in the Lost Valley of our life it doesn't matter if we're like Jonah in the whale's belly we have the victory if we're on the mountain we're the Victor from the valley where's the victory we have the victory see we're not praying to get Victory we're praying from Victory right because the Lord Jesus Christ has won US the victory amen so if we could just focus in on those things because this should be our reality right we have Victory you say I've got this really terrible mind about all these things are going on but you have the victory yeah I've got trouble in my home but you have the victory of that trouble uh yeah I've got this besetting Center I can't get over but you have the victory over it right you already have the victory Hallelujah amen let's go to First John five I know we're doing a bit of a reading but hey praise God I think it's good we you know we read our portion of the book amen I'm so thankful that you know we're not guessing if these things are us or not but no it is Hallelujah first John 5 and 7 because people you know we talk about how bad the world is and sure the world I'm not belittling anything like the enemy we can't we can't overcome them in our own strength how many people have tried to I'm just going to be independent I'm just going to be an eagle I don't need nothing or nobody and you know and big and they think they can outwit Satan just because they've got a few quotes on their wall no brother Ram said you can't over you can't outwit him he's a Slicker in your own strength you need the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to overcome them so we can't so I'm not belittling our enemy we've got a real enemy right but we've really overcome him right by the blood of lamb and the word of Our Testimony that's why it's so important if you're on a clinch a testimony testify of it that's a good way to put the last nail in the Satan's coffin in that thing testify of it amen now we're so we're here in first John and five and four whosoever is born of God who's had a new birth here overcometh the world amen and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith Hallelujah so you say well you know just for example you say well maybe I was just you know I just met the Lord yesterday but you've already overcome the world if you're born a God you've overcome the world politics whatever whatever people yo YouTube whatever's trending who cares you've overcome it you've already overcome it so see we shouldn't be worried about this big John Moss is going to swallow us up it can't swallow us up because we've overcome it this is what the Bible tells me I've overcome the world amen and this is the victory that overcometh the world it's even our faith Hallelujah so faith is the victory the prophet preaches right Faith gives you the victory over every circumstance and that Faith should tell you you've won it's like David when he went to fight Goliath hear anyone yeah God gave me the lion gave me the beer he'll give me this guy too he'll be another testimony on my wall why because his faith overcame those enemies and he realized that Goliath was the same category as those enemies because it's the that Philistine was an uncircumcised Philistine who had no Covenant with God just like The Lion and the Bear yeah right so we've got to realize that every enemy that comes against us doesn't have a covenant with our God be it sickness be it be it be it depression be any kind of spirit anything that can be named does not have a covenant with our God right we have a covenant with our God and he said that I have overcome he gives us the victory Hallelujah so we can we can just Rejoice amen amen right we have the victory you know it's even even over some of those talking to someone about about you know forgiveness and unforgiveness a good way to know you've forgiven someone as if you're like Stephen when you're about to you know as many Stone he says Lord don't lay this to their charge right he still felt the pain of the stones he still felt the rejection no doubt he still felt that but he said don't lay this to their charge when you have it in your heart that you want to see that person that's hurt you saved they want us you want to see them in heaven that shows you have forgiven them right it's like Jesus when he was hanging on Calvary he said his father forgive them they don't know what they do he still died of a broken heart see many times we mistake we think I can't I can't forgive because I feel pain Jesus still felt pain on Calvary not just physically but he died of a broken heart so he felt the emotion of the rejection the pain of the rejection and the hurt that they inflicted upon him not just physically but emotionally but yet he said father forgive them they don't know what they do so he he still felt that pain but he forgave them cease you can't go by paying your feeling by if you're forgiven or not no if you're forgiven and and you know you're forgiven but why because from your heart you want to see that person in heaven with you that is totally different from the pain you may be feeling from the trauma you've experienced right right but you've still forgiven them I hope I hope that's all right right so we can rejoice we have the victory right we can forgive right we can actually walk and have no ought in our heart against anyone right and it doesn't matter what comes against us we have the victory amen why because because remember it's predestinated that the devil is going to burn in the Lake of Fire we aren't going there right we have the victory over hell death in the grave because Jesus purchased it that day on Calvary for us right so it doesn't matter what we're going through I'm just going to wrap this up but I just I just pray this blessing to someone because many times when we're in a battle we can't see the wood from the trees we think how we're going to get through this but if we realize hey I've already won because he won it for me right every battle we go through I've already won how's the victory coming I don't know but he won it for me he's going to come on the scene and that's all that matters right so if we can just look beyond the maybe you know maybe the internal conflict or the external conflict whatever it is and we're going to look beyond that and say no I've overcome this thing because he overcame it right and those that are born of God overcometh the world Hallelujah the world doesn't overcome them we overcome the world Hallelujah amen I think it's a wonderful thing I think we can rejoice in that we're Victorious today amen you may not feel it but you are don't go by how you're feeling right don't go by you know well I have this memory I did this no you have the victory over it the lord gave you the victory amen praise the Lord um let's just read one more shall we let's read Revelations 19. and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah this is Revelations 19 to 1. I trust you can identify yourself here saying hallelujah Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord Our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the Great Horn which did corrupt the Earth with their fornication ethic pardon me Avenge the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said Allah and her smoke grows up forever and ever and the Four and Twenty others and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and a herd as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth it's already predestinated yes yes right do you believe you're predestinated right you have the victory so so so so don't shrink back in the trial push forward remember you have the victory over your whatever you're going through God Christ gives us the victory right amen I may be sounding like I'm a broken record but whatever you're going through you can name it in your heart right now God's given you the victory you're not defeated you remember Satan has lost but he fights like a winner we've won but we fight like we're a loser many times we need to swap that round we should fight like our outcome and our outcome is Victorious round the throne throughout eternity that's our outcome so we've already won because Christ won it for us right so we should live like we're winners not like we're losers but we should live like we're winners because we are not like that's a bad way of saying we are winners you know we're not pretending to be winners like Satan no we've won we just gotta just just enjoy the Lord as you go through life's journey now valleys mountains just love him praise Him worship Him adore him say thank you Lord you'll take me through this one too what do you want to show me I'm in praise God you're here with me thou art the keeper of my head you're you're out the lifter of my head Lord Jesus you're my shield my buckler you're here to see me through every trial so I think we can Rejoice so who has the victory tonight Hallelujah you say I don't feel like it no but you've still got it right we're not going on feelings here we are going on the revelation of the word of God and what the Lord Jesus Christ has already done for you hallelujah amen so we're gonna have a time of prayer now um I think we should so let's just go through the prayer requests and then I want to sing I thought his brother Edward singing I thought it's so applicable let's sing again Victory in Jesus my Savior forever amen so let's just I'm just going to read out the prayer
