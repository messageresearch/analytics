Um, so we've got new church cards in the back with our updated website address on it. Like to thank brother Ed very much for putting the website together and uh bring that all together. So we appreciate that. We're going to be adding to it as we go. But yeah, so if you got old cards, uh, just throw them out because we don't have that website anymore. That's a whole story in itself, but we'll get anyway. We had a new one. We needed a new one. So maybe that was just the push. I don't know. But all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you all. Let's turn to Genesis chapter 3. Just want to read a couple of verses uh here and then we're going to go to Isaiah um chapter 53. I know this is probably familiar scriptures to all of us, but just wanted to read these. And uh you know, I I went and saw brother Phil today and uh he was getting well maybe I shouldn't say it, but I'll say it. He was getting 60 odd staples pulled out of his wound and and this kind of got me on this whole thought of wounds. I don't have any pictures. Okay, I wouldn't show them, but you know, but so yeah, this is what I'm going to talk about. So, uh, Genesis 3 and 14, it says, "And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou has done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field, upon thy belly thou shalt go, and thus shall they eat all the days of thy life. And I'll put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." There's going to be wounding that's going to happen. And when God promises something, it's going to happen. And it did. And we praise the Lord for it. Amen. So, and then we go to Isaiah chapter 53. And um we're just going to read here. &gt;&gt; I actually have it, sorry, on the um I have it on the uh projector if you, you know, to save you time. But here we are. Isaiah 53. Going to read verses 2 to 6. Uh you we could read the whole thing. We're just going to read these verses here. It says, "And he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor comeliness that when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men. A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath bore our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. Amen. What a powerful scripture. Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer tonight. If you have need, you just want to raise your hand. Say, Lord, remember me at this time. Speak to my life, Lord Jesus. Cuz he's a personal God, isn't he? Amen. Hallelujah. We're so thankful for that. Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father, as we bow our heads in your presence once again, we just want to give you thanks, Lord, for all you have done. We praise your great name, Lord Jesus. Thank you that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Thank you. You're faithful and true. And as we have read your great eternal word, Lord, we ask once again. May you anoint it to our hearts, Lord. Not just the hearers here. Anoint it to my heart, Lord. Anoint it to those who are watching by the way of YouTube, Lord Jesus. Just be all of our abundant portion. We love you so much. We commit our lives into your hands asking Lord that you'll raise our faith Lord Jesus. Lord may you just uh bring a greater stability in our lives. May you just manifest yourself in a greater way Lord through us Lord as we Lord Lord from uh from before we left I mean before we came in this place to when we leave at the end Lord may there be a change in our lives going from glory to glory and be those who are streaming as well be their portion in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you friends. You can have your seats uh tonight. So, I want to talk about wounds now. Oh, wait. I'm pushing the wrong screen here. I want to talk about wounds. I mean, a wound is inflicted by a sharp or a a a hard object striking you, cutting you, damaging you in some way. And this is not just in the uh uh in the in the natural, but it's also speaking about spiritual wounds. Now, we read there in Genesis chapter 3 that God promised a wounding. Amen. There would be a wounding that would take place where the the the seed of the woman which we know is Christ would crush or bruise the head of the seed of the serpent and then that serpent in in turn would would would bruise his heel. So there was a wounding that would take place on both sides. Now we uh understand that the fulfillment of this prophecy was that day on Calvary where where Christ was was was was bruised in his heel. He was marred more than any other man. But the head of the of the serpent was crushed or bruised that day. That word bruise means crushed and I like crushed more. I like think of my enemy being crushed under his feet. Amen. So, so there was a wounding. Now, wounds wounds work both ways. They can they can either uh manifest God or they can or Satan will try and get into those same wounds and try and manifest, try and manifest his character. But it all depends on which way we allow it to go. Like it says in Hebrews about, you know, don't let a root of bitterness grow in you. You know, because there was a wound. In order for business to come in, there has to be a wound to to to come in cuz uh you know who's ever had an uh infected wound. It may go red may you know be a bit inflamed or something that's infection trying to come in. Now what happens is is is God allows wounds to happen and he allows them to happen that his glory would be made known. And like we have here Joby sitting he's covered in boils his friends or you know you know the picture's cropped but you know his three three friends are coming to visit him to basically tell him he's wrong and you know so but you see he was wounded. &gt;&gt; God permitted the wounding. God told en uh Job's enemy and his enemy Job's a perfect man and basically Satan said well the only reason he loves you is because everything's going fine. In other words he's never had a wound. &gt;&gt; That's why he serves you. That's why you could testify him about him this way. But but because God knew Job's future, he could because he knew Job's past, he could uh because remember he was with God before the foundation of the world. Amen. So God could actually testify to his enemy, do what you Well, you can do certain things, but you can't take his life. You can't touch him. We know he came to, you know, the first time he wasn't allowed to touch Job. Second time he could make him sick, but he couldn't take his life. And basically God was basically telling the enemy these wounds that you're I'm allowing you to inflict upon Job, they're not going to change Job in terms of the fact that he's going to become an unbeliever. He's going to curse me to my face. That was uh could not happen. Right? So, so Job's wounds actually brought out good in his life. You say, well, how did it bring out good? Well, before the tr before the wounding, he would say, well, I see in in nature, you know, the flowers come forth, they die, then they come back again the next season. And you know, he saw death, burial, resurrection in nature. But he says, "Man dies. Where does he go? &gt;&gt; He's not like a tree. He's not like a flower. He's just he just goes, gives up the ghost. Where does he go?" And this was his main question in life. What happens after my last breath leaves my body? &gt;&gt; Where am I going? But so God would allow wounding to come into his life that he could stand and say, "Now I know my redeemer liveth." Amen. And with these eyes, I shall see God. I'll stand with him on the last days of the earth. Amen. So his wounding actually opened heaven to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually gave him a mighty revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see the enemy wanted to use those same wounds to make Job curse God to his face. But you see, no those wounds actually brought out where God would actually because of those wounds, God would ask Job, "Where were you when the morning stars shouted for joy and the foundation world was formed? Where were you, Job?" And God through those wounds was trying to tell Job, Job, you were with me. in my mind before there's anything I thought of you, Job. And it wasn't with these wounds. It was with in in an eternal body dancing, rejoicing, and shouting because how God thought of Job in the beginning is how he's going to end up in the end. And those wounds weren't going to stop it. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing in our lives, friends. We're all being wounded. We've all been hurt. We've been betrayed. We've been backstabbed. We've been lied on. We've been, you know, ridiculed. We've been rejected. We've all been wounded. &gt;&gt; But why are we still believers? There's something greater in you than your wound. I mean, there's something greater in you than than than what man could do to you or a spirit would try and afflict you with. There's something far greater in you than those things. And we'll come to that later. Amen. But you see what happens is the enemy always tries to bring, I could say, infection into the wound where God wants to reveal himself. The devil wants to come in and try and mess it up just to taint it a little bit because he loves man, our enemy. Let's just read this like this for example. Likewise, the spirit although also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray as we uh for as we ought, but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. Amen. So when you get wounded, you just let the spirit of God pray through you and it can really it can really manifest or utter really what that wound has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that searchth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to his purpose. Now the enemy wants to come in and because we can look at things and say this is working for my good. &gt;&gt; Do you understand how? No. Do I need to understand how? No. We walk by faith not by sight. I don't walk with God because I understand everything. I don't walk with God because I've seen my life mapped out every day of what's going to happen. No, I walk with him because he's revealed himself to me and he's a faithful shepherd and he will see me through. &gt;&gt; He's proved his word in my life. Amen. So, we don't walk with him because we know all things or understand all things. Things will happen like Job didn't even understand what happened to him. And God never took the time to explain to him that that that he had a testimony meeting with with Satan before this happened. You don't read it in the book of Job. God's not obligated to tell us everything. And that's okay. I don't mind. He can do what he wants. He's God. I'm me. He's God. I've I've got the hierarchy right. You know, anyway. So, you know, so so things will happen and we don't understand why. Well, we've got to realize it's working for our good. But then the enemy wants to come in because remember trouble, brother says that God harnesses trouble, puts bits in its mouth and causes it to bring us closer to God, right? He he allows wounds to come in not because he wasn't displeased with Job. Job didn't put a foot wrong. He was a perfect man, right? God wasn't embellishing his testimony about Job to the enemy.
