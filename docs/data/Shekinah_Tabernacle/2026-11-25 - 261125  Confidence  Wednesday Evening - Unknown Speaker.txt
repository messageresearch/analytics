May May tonight not just be a human endeavor, Lord, but may the supernatural God touch each heart tonight, Lord, and refresh each spirit, every being here, Lord. May your spirit just move in a powerful way amongst us. We pray as we just um thank you so much for forgiveness. Thank you for your grace. Thank you for an entrance into the kingdom of God, Lord. And a and a way back that we could come back and have fellowship with you, Lord. So, we just want to commit um this service to your hands. Bless those that are streaming, [music] too. We pray in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Josh. Thank you, musicians. God bless you all this evening. &gt;&gt; How are you all? You doing good? &gt;&gt; That's good. It's good to see you all. Just while you're standing, um let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews 10 and the 35th um verse. Oh, it's not that one. Hebrews 10:35 says, "Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward." Amen. May God bless his word. You can take your seats uh this evening. I had a funny thought. There was a brother that um so I've heard that preached an entire service without asking the congregation to sit down. He sort of forgot to tell him to sit down. So and I guess they're all too polite to say anything. So they all stood up through through the whole service until he finished. And I think he realized at the end and at the end he said, "Well, hey, I have to stand up the whole service, so you might as well too." [laughter] But I got one up on him. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; They they he they had to stand the whole service on two legs. But I get to stand on one leg. Um it's good to be here. It's um I I've got a I've got a little thought that I that I've just had brewing in my mind and it's a it's this thought called confidence. Who likes having confidence? &gt;&gt; I like people with confidence. You know, some people get a bit annoyed by, say, some young fellas that are a bit sort of think they're all this and that. But I I actually quite like them. I like a young lad. I like people with confidence. I I prefer that over someone that that's a bit shy and doesn't want to do anything and pulls back cuz I I don't think that's healthy. I think it's healthier for a human to just to be out there and be be trying. At least you can It's probably a bit easier to pull someone in rather than it is to get someone to &gt;&gt; to come out. And um it's even been in my walk with the Lord. I've always had a I guess you could call it an agreement when I had those two dogs when I was just a new Christian. One was a one was called Mercy, one was called Wood. And Mercy would be very shy with everything. It wouldn't want to do things. It wouldn't want to hop in the car. It wouldn't want to go for a run. It would be very cautious. And the other dog wood was the opposite. It would just do anything. It saw water. It dived in. It saw the van. It jumped in and everything like that. And I I guess I preferred the more boisterous dog than the one that didn't do anything. So I said to the Lord, "Well, in my Christian walk, I'm just going to go for it. And if you want to sort of stop me and direct me another way, you can. But in the meantime, I'm going for it. [laughter] So I've kept my agreement and he's kept his. [laughter] But it it works." All right. I want to read you some scriptures about about confidence. David said it's better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It's better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes because he's saying of and and Solomon says for the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken. We can have confidence in this God that we serve. That confidence means you can rest assured. You can sort of be a bit brash if you're confident. You can be a bit a bit slightly arrogant if you're confident. You know, if you're in a situation if someone like someone if they've if they're about to enter a fight and there's only two of the other guys and there's one of them and about 30 of his mates, that man is real confident. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, cuz regardless of the what happens in his little fight, he knows that ultimately I'll get my friends will jump in and help me out. So, he he's got a he's maybe a little too overconfident, but that's the confidence we can have in the Lord that that we serve a big God that regardless what happens, he's always going to be there for us. we can have confidence and that's the God that we come to tonight is a we want to be confident in him and confident in his word and and be confident. John says, "Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then we have confidence toward God." &gt;&gt; So when we approach God, if we know, Lord, I've I am not a secret sinner. There's nothing I'm doing that I that I know that's displeasing you. I can have confidence towards you and my sins are forgiven, but I know I'm not I'm not purposely going out of my way to I know you've said this, but I go and do something else. You I've got confidence, Lord. My my heart doesn't condemn me. Therefore, I've got confidence to come into your presence. I've got confidence to talk to you. I don't have to be ashamed. You know, sometimes we we're if we do something wrong and we got to go and see the person, we're slightly ashamed. We say, "Look, I'm sorry I did this." And we're ashamed. It's a human trait. And it's a good trait. But, you know, it's nice when we can come to to God with confidence. Although, if we repent of our sins, then we can that the moment we do, we can come with confidence [laughter] to the Lord. the same Paul says in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith of him. So because we have this faith in the Lord, we can have confidence when we access him. We don't need to be shy or hold back. We can have confidence to go into the presence of God. It says, and then he says, for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end. As Christians, we've got a lot of confidence. &gt;&gt; We've got a lot of confidence in the word of God. We've got a lot of confidence in his promises. We've got a lot of confidence in his dealing. And Paul's saying, don't ever lose that confidence. &gt;&gt; Hold on to that confidence. I think when we're first new Christians, we've got a lot of confidence, but things can happen in our life. They can we can get setbacks and different things. And if we don't watch it, we the devil tries to rob us of our confidence. &gt;&gt; But Paul's saying, hold your confidence steadfast to the end. That the God that you served when you began is still the same God you serve when it's all over. So, and and his word is the same. He's never changed his mind on you. Don't ever lose your confidence in the Lord. Always be confident in the Lord. He always loves you. He always cares for you. He's always got your best interest at heart. Always be confident in the Lord. And that's what Paul's telling us. Hold your confidence steadfast into the end. And that's where this scripture comes in. Paul admonishes us again. He says, "Cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward." There's a confidence. If we have a reward in Christ, there's a confident there's if we have confidence in Christ, there's a reward that comes with it. I want to go through a few things of why we're so confident and why I'm so confident. Why? Why? I've got this confidence because through the devil trying to rob something from me, I've realized I've got a lot of confidence in the Lord. I've always been confident in the Lord. And I think you would be the same if you've got something in you that loves the Lord. You've always been confident in the Lord. You've been confident that he's going to provide. You've been confident that he's going to undertake. We call it faith, but it's also confidence. You know, we've just got this confidence that makes us move forward and keep going. And we're confident. We We're not shy to make decisions for the Lord because we're confident that he's going to undertake. We just we've got this air of confidence about us. And I want to say that I just want to bring us through a few things of why we're confident. And and one thing I've got confidence in confidence in is I've got confidence that God made the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; I look at the stars. I have confidence in that. I say, "Lord, you made this. You made all this creation." Then I then I look a bit closer and I see the intricate nature of some of the things that he's made. &gt;&gt; And I begin to trust. I I have more confidence in him because I think if God can make these intricate little things and make them all work very well, he can work out my life. I've got I'm confident in the Lord's ability. I'm confident in his ability to orchestrate things. I I I I've seen some of his handiwork. I'm confident he can do the same thing on me. I'm confident he's not just going to get take my life and make a mess of it. I'm confident he's very intelligent. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and then when I But then I'm also confident that at one point in time where there was no man, I'm I'm confident that in God was was this desire to express so many things. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he was like that. I'm I'm He wasn't just sitting there thinking I I don't want to know anybody. I'm just happy here by myself. I'm alone or up in the bush. I took a lot of flack for that statement last week. [laughter] Um I've got a Shannon's was up in the bush with me. Okay. [laughter] Okay. They just correct it. Okay. Hey, just in case I I think I missed that very important factor. Boy, was I in trouble when I got home, man. [laughter] So, it was Shannon and I, but and the children. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Nah, stinking old dogs. No, the dogs. Okay. Um, but I'm confident God wasn't like me. I'm confident that that he he desired to have fellowship. He desired to express himself. And and then I'm confident that that's why he decided to make man &gt;&gt; because he wanted to actually express himself and have some sort of fellowship and not just be there alone with his thoughts. &gt;&gt; I'm confident God was like that. So then over the course of time I'm confident that God created man. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he came down he thought he made the earth and then he creation came the birds the different things and then he made man and he was and I'm confident he was very happy when he finished making man because it says he looked at man and he said it's very good. &gt;&gt; It's good. I'm happy with my creation. And it was like it was like the the best of his handiwork went into man. And and and &gt;&gt; and then I'm confident that that when God would go down in the to the garden in the cool of the evening, I'm confident that he enjoyed it. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he didn't sit up wherever he was and think, "Ah, it's the evening again. I've got to go down again." [sighs] I'm confident it wasn't a it wasn't a burden for him. I'm confident he wanted to go and do it. He wanted to come down and fellowship with man. He it was he was it was such an enjoyable experience for him. I'm confident that God was like that. I'm confident he was looking forward to the meeting. &gt;&gt; And and I'm confident that when that when Eve was deceived and when Adam went the same way and I'm confident that God was sad at the situation. &gt;&gt; I'm confident he was disappointed in terms of he doesn't get that same fellowship they used to have. &gt;&gt; I'm confident he he wasn't just like ah there that that that saga is finally over because I was getting tiresome fellowshipping with these people. &gt;&gt; I'm confident he didn't think that. &gt;&gt; I'm confident he enjoyed fellowship. I'm confident he was sad. But then I'm confident that in his mind in his mind even though he had he had pushed man out of the garden and he had had shut the way to the tree of life. I'm confident that this was part of a greater plan that he had to and already when that had happened, he he was already making a plan to bring man back. It was part of his God has got such a way of doing that that even though things might look bad, they're working out for some better plan like like Joseph, you know, we if we just take Joseph's story of his brothers throwing him in the pit in isolation, we would think that's a very bad situation. That's a bad story. And yet on the grand scheme of everything, it was a great story and &gt;&gt; and and you you wouldn't take it back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you took if you looked at it in its just on its own, you'd say, "I would stop that situation. I wouldn't let his brother throw him in there. Let's not have that situation cuz it's a bad situation. But God in his great mind can just his mind is bigger than our mind. He's very good and he he can take things that like this situation here that look bad and make it even to to an even greater thing where where man actually had a better fellowship with God after everything was said and done than what they did before it was all said and done. I'm confident that's the God we serve. I'm confident he's always got a plan. and it looks like maybe his plan's been thwarted or maybe something's gone wrong, but I'm confident he he's never up he he's never worried about it's not going the way that he thought. &gt;&gt; I'm confident. &gt;&gt; Then I'm confident even though even though man was in the state where they were separated from God, if if man so desired even in that situation that he could begin in his heart somewhere to call out to God and I'm confident God would answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though there was a separation, God would still answer. There was still some way that man could communicate with this God. God didn't just turn his back completely and think, "I don't want anything more to do with you." I'm confident God, if he saw a heart somewhere that desired God, that God would somehow somewhere meet them some way and begin and talk to them somehow. That's why I'm confident that there was a man called there was a man called Job that that Job just loved this God so much that God could talk to Job or or Enoch. Enoch was supposedly cut off. The the the don't forget the the the tree of life. The tree the way to the tree of life was still blocked. And yet Enoch walked out of here and walked into the kingdom of God. So I'm confident that God had such a desire to fellowship that Enoch some way somehow just wanted to meet God. And he just he he and Enoch just cried and called out to God and God answered somehow someway even amongst even though there was this chasm God bridged the chasm somehow. So that that if any any anyone somewhere wanted to meet God I'm confident that God will respond to their the cry of their heart. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Then I'm confident that one day God met this man called Abram. And he said to Abram, I'm going to make you a great nation. And he said he said look up at the stars. I'm going to make your offspring like the like the stars you can see in the heavens. That's that's who your off that's the amount of offspring you're going to have. And I'm going to make a I'm going to make a great nation out of you. And he I'm confident God gave that promise to Abraham to Abraham. Then in the course of time, I'm also confident that that this promise looked like it wasn't going to go anywhere cuz all of Abraham's whole entire lineage became slaves in Egypt. But I'm confident that wasn't the end of the story &gt;&gt; because remember, God had made a promise and I'm confident that God keeps his promises. He doesn't just say it to Abraham and then maybe 400 years down the track realize thinks, "Oh, I didn't maybe this hasn't gone the way that I thought. You guys haven't been as good as what I thought. I'm going to go back on my promise." He didn't go back on his promise to to Abraham. Even though it looked like everything was bad and the promise was not going to happen, I'm confident God was going to keep his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and then I'm confident I'm confident that God led the children of Israel out of bondage with a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; I'm confident. And I'm also confident that they didn't walk through a sea of reeds. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And if they did, it would have been a greater miracle than if they walked through a deep sea. &gt;&gt; Cuz God managed to drown the the might of the world, the most majestic, powerful army in existence. He managed to drown them in a sea of reeds. [laughter] Someone's telling the story wrong. Either these guys were no good. They went a very powerful army and they were amateurs to die in a sea of reads. Or it wasn't a sea of reads. [laughter] or or otherwise God was just so powerful he could drown them in the sea. But I believe an east wind blew and it blew and blew and blew. You know that that you know if you do that if you blow wind so fast it actually can make things turn to ice. And if you can blow if you blow air fast enough that's why when you're flying an airplane ice particles build up on the outside because it's because the wind blows so fast. And when an east one blew it just blew and blew and blew and it could actually build up big ice walls and the children of Israel could walk across and then when he let the when he let um Pharaoh and all his army across the ice walls just came crashing down. I don't know if that's a scientific explanation but it can happen. Either way, I believe and I'm confident that God drowned all the all the Egyptian army in the sea. And then I'm confident that that to this this particular people. Now, there were many people that God spoke to in the world, but he just decided I'm going to work it this way that this particular people that he began to express himself to the children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; And now, it wasn't I'm confident it wasn't just for them like, oh, this is no one else can be a partaker of this. I'm just talking to these these people are no more. But I'm confident he was he was speaking although he was speaking to them. He was speaking to all of us. He was speaking to mankind. He just chose this particular group of people that I'm going to do it through. I'm going to start to express who I am. I'm going to start to express myself. And then he gave them he start he gave them what they called the law. I'm confident he gave them a law. But then I'm also confident that he said there's a way there's freedom from this law. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm confident that he just didn't give them a law and say now now you can't keep it. Now you're done and goodbye race. But I'm confident that he he said there's a although there's a law and you're breaking all the time, there's a way that you this there's a way that the penalty can be undone. And if you if you take a lamb, this penalty can can be undone. But I'm confident that he wasn't just speaking in some Middle Eastern desert somewhere talking to these people about a little lamb and then it was just a a sideeshow that he tried to do to give give himself a bit of entertainment. But I'm confident that he was speaking of himself. &gt;&gt; He had he had a greater purpose in mind when he began to tell them take a lamb. He had a greater purpose because he wanted to show eventually you're going to take me. I'm going to be the lamb. I'm going to come here like this little lamb is but I need to show you first what I'm going to do. I'm going to come here and be that lamb and I'm going to I'm going to pay the price for you just like I'm showing you. This is going to pay the price of that sin. I'm going to pay the price for your sin. I'm confident that's why he was doing it. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that's why he met Abraham. That's why he made all this effort for the to the children of Israel. I'm confident he did that for me &gt;&gt; because he wanted to show me that he's the lamb of God that takes away my sins. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that throughout the ages, it doesn't matter what the children of Israel did. Doesn't matter what the priests did. Doesn't matter what the scribes did. It doesn't matter how they messed up his whole religious plan. He didn't mind. He just kept on with his plan anyway. He kept on sending prophets saying, "I'm about to come. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come. Unto us a son is given. Unto us a child is born." I'm confident he just carried on. &gt;&gt; Even though they took the law and they did all these things with it and they they looks like it was always all messed up and it looked like there was no way this whole thing's going to carry on. And yet God, I'm confident he didn't worry about that. &gt;&gt; I'm confident he didn't give up. He just carried on. Then I'm confident that one day there was a woman called Mary that knew no man. man that was a virgin. I'm confident that the Holy Ghost overshadowed her one day and she conceived seed in her that was of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that this was a this was a worldchanging event that took place that that God Almighty came down and connected with Earth one in in in the womb of Mary. And I'm confident that in her womb was the son of God. When we understand the magnitude of that, it makes us shake ourselves to our core to realize that that just this is this is God visiting man here. This is not just a nice story, but it's God visiting man. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident then that that in in in a in a stable in Bethlehem that this this man called Jesus was born. That a very unannounced birth. It seemed like it wasn't even very significant. Yet, there was a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm confident there was a son of God born there. And and and I'm confident that that the angels were so excited they had to tell somebody. They were so excited about the son of God arriving that they the the best people they could find were shepherds. And they went and told the shepherds, "I bring you glad tidings. I I bring you good news. The son of God, God is with man." I'm confident that's what happened. I'm confident this wasn't a story, a a madeup story, but I'm confident that's what happened. Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then I'm confident that Jesus of his own free will &gt;&gt; just his whole purpose of being here and he knew it from when he was born was I'm going to pay the price. I'm going to die for I'm going to die for all of my people. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that when he was led up to the cross that he did it of his own free will that at any point he could have said no. &gt;&gt; I'm confident the Romans had no say in this matter. &gt;&gt; I'm confident cuz he said you'd have no power over me except it were given you. &gt;&gt; God had all the power and he chose to pay the price of our sins. I'm confident of that because he did that because he loved me because he loved you. I'm confident that's the God that I serve &gt;&gt; and that's that's that's who walked up that hill and that's who paid the price for our salvation. And then I'm confident that when he died, &gt;&gt; he didn't have any sin. &gt;&gt; So the the the penalty of death that that grabs on to this thing called sin. I'm confident it had nowhere to grab hold of him. It tried to grab him yet it couldn't grab him anywhere. So, I'm confident he went down to the the lower regions of hell, the deep the deepest the darkest place and got the keys of death and hell and he walked back victorious with it. I'm confident that's where he went. And I'm also confident that when he was laying in the tomb that he that his body didn't see corruption like when you David catches a pig and you skin it and you put it in the fridge and it it lasts maybe after 3 or 4 days. That's why they they let meat age cuz it starts to break down. It technically goes rotten and it gets softer and softer as it breaks down. I'm confident he didn't his body didn't break down when it was dead in the tomb. I'm confident it didn't see corruption. It didn't just start to rot and break away, but it saw no corruption. And I'm confident that before it did, the life of God came back into it and he rose back from the dead and there was an empty tomb. I'm confident of that. And I believe you're confident of that, too. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that he said, "If I go, I'll come back to you by my spirit. I'll I'll I'll cleanse you of your sins and I'll send my spirit back upon the earth and I'll come and dwell in you and I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost and I'm confident that Jesus Christ is alive forever more. I'm confident that he rose from the dead and he's alive forever more. I'm confident of that cuz I've I've met him. I'm confident. And then I'm confident that he kept his promise and the same spirit that was in him &gt;&gt; was p we was poured into the church. &gt;&gt; We have a confidence. I know that's what happened. They didn't just sit there and nothing happened. They sat there and the power of God came down and it filled each one in the room and they spoke with tongues and prophesied and there were and you could see actual pillars of fire in the building because the spirit of God was there fulfilling fulfilling the promise that was spoken of the prophet Joel. &gt;&gt; I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. I'm confident that that's what happened. And I'm confident that when Peter came out to speak that he didn't just uh rattle off some words that that he thought would be good at the time, but they said to men and brethren, "What must we do to be saved? what must we do? And I'm confident that Peter under the inspiration of the same God that was that made the earth said to the people, "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." I'm confident that wasn't Peter speaking. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that was the spirit of God speaking through Peter. And I'm confident if we go the same way, we can get the same result. If we follow the formula, we get the same result today because it's the eternal word of God. And I'm confident now that that men and women could we can surrender our life over to the Lord. We can repent. We can be baptized. And we can we can receive the spirit of God and walk in newness of life. I'm confident of that. That's that's the confidence I have that if someone comes whomsoever will let him come and he can he can be you can be changed, renewed, and refreshed and and filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then as time went on, I'm confident there was a man called Saul that hated God. That that no, he loved he loved what he thought was God, but he hated this Jesus. And he was going around trying to persecute the church and he he hated the whole idea of what they were trying to do. But I'm confident one day that God met him. &gt;&gt; That that this man was going in such a direction that he he thought he was fighting the good fight of faith and serving God and yet he was fighting against God. But I'm confident that God met him and turned his life around and he said, "Who are you?" And a light spoke and said, "I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest." I'm confident that happened. &gt;&gt; I'm confident. And then it I'm confident that that that God, the great almighty God, began to speak to Paul and to reveal things to Paul that that he'd revealed to no man &gt;&gt; to that point. I'm I'm confident he began to speak to this unworthy vessel, this man that hated him. &gt;&gt; God in his great mercy decided to use somebody that hated him &gt;&gt; to turn him around. That's why Paul could say, "I'm the least of all the apostles." He meant it. &gt;&gt; Show me any other records where any of the other apostles are so against the Lord. They were just doing their thing, fishing, doing bits and pieces, and he went and called them. They were living, you could say, reasonably okay, respectable sort of lives. Here was Saul hated Jesus, hated Christians. He was doing everything he could to persecute them. But, but I'm confident that God in his great plan begin to work through Paul and speak things. And I'm confident then that the things that Paul spoke were not just a mere man speaking, but they were thus sayaith the Lord, &gt;&gt; that they were the word of God. That it was God speaking through Paul. And as Paul would write letters, it wasn't just Paul writing letters, but they were the infallible word of God when he would write it. We have we have our Bibles here today still that as a result of this situation where God spoke to Paul. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident then that that man could take that and and take the word of God and and use it whenever he would desire. But but I'm confident that throughout the ages as when Satan started to impersonate and this one here when Satan started to see what God was up to and begin to impersonate Christianity, begin to impersonate the ways of God, begin to put us put a substitute up, he begin to to copy it and and offer another way that wasn't the way. I'm confident that there were people that still knew the right way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as these as Satan began to take over the Christian movement more and more, he he began to take control of Christendom, the very thing that was supposed to be God, as Satan un as he unpacked how the whole thing worked, he learned the the phrases. He learned the the songs, he learned this, he learned that to to impersonate Christianity, and then he began to take over and and men and women that didn't have the spirit of God were were tricked and were fooled. And then this and then Satan began over time Satan began to run the Christian church &gt;&gt; and that the and and Paul the Pauls of this world, the Holy Ghost people were of none effect and and the few that were left would begin to be put to death. But I'm confident that even in that &gt;&gt; God gave power to the believers all through the age to overcome. No matter what came against them, if they were thrown into the lines, they had power there to overcome. If they were wallowing in the dark ages, he gave them power to overcome. I'm confident that God didn't just leave his people and disappear. But I'm confident that that he gave them what they needed in that hour to overcome. I'm confident he gave these people what they needed to overcome. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that even through the dark ages when it when it would when it seems like if a searching man or searching woman would knock on any church door to try and find God, they wouldn't find him. Because Satan had taken over the virtually the whole of Christendom. So every church door you knocked on would lead you down the wrong path. God was nowhere to be found because Satan had done such a good job of impersonated impersonating it and taken over the whole thing to where whole continents were taken over by the church was run by Satan. But I'm confident God didn't want it that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that God would wanted a man or woman if they went to a to the house of God that they could find God. &gt;&gt; They they wouldn't knock on a door and and be led down and say this prayer and hold these beads in your hand and do this sort of stuff and do penance and do that. I'm confident he didn't want that. He wanted them to meet the living God the same way that he wanted that he said in the book of Acts 2. &gt;&gt; So then I'm confident he had a plan. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just going to leave it. He wasn't just going to say, "Well, let's just leave it. Satan's taken over the whole thing." But he sent men with a message that had courage &gt;&gt; to stand up against a whole continent. &gt;&gt; This is like Moses went up to a whole army. Martin Luther stood up against a whole continent, against probably the most powerful force in the world. He stood up and he he said, "No, it's not going to be like this." And that wasn't him thinking, "Oh, I'm just going to go out and give these guys a hard time." I'm confident that was the spirit of God in him desiring that that this thing will be pushed away and the spirit of God could begin to move into the people again. I'm confident it was a work of God. And and and this worked. I'm confident it worked and and men and women began to now find access. The just shall live by faith. They began to find access again back into the kingdom of God. They didn't have to do all these things. They could just believe. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But even over time as they started to go a bit loose, I'm confident God sent more people. He sent John Wesley to straighten things out and to to keep pulling his people out to pull them up higher because he wanted us back to where we were in the book of Acts. That's I'm confident that's where he wanted us. He didn't just want us halfway. &gt;&gt; He wanted us back. And then over time, as man did does, we all seem to get formal and we just started making all these so many rules and everything in the church. We became so formal. And Sister Robin knows all about that being in the what is it? the Dutch Reformed Church and things where it's just it's just a formal occasion that the the the you know the the the whole battle you think this seems so pointless the whole battle that Martin Luther waged and the end result is some formal &gt;&gt; little gathering that they just sing about two songs and then the the guy comes up and reads word for word off here and then he says his friend they all go home and you think and and that whole fight was fought for that &gt;&gt; it God wanted man to worship him in spirit and in truth where you're alive to Christ. The word of God's burning in your heart, you're filled with the Holy Ghost. That's what God desired. Not just coming dead wood. He wanted life. And that's what he So God didn't just stop and go, "Oh, that's what it is." He kept on pressing on until he got life. And and as men got way, way too formal, God decided, I'm just going to come down. I'm just going to fill a whole bunch of people with the Holy Ghost, and let's get this [laughter] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I shouldn't Let's stir this up a wee bit. Let's get this started. Let's turn Let's Let's turn over things a little bit. and on a little a little corner building where where there were just a couple of simple men and women that were just there praising God anyway that they knew how banging on some old guitar and tambourine. One of them would have had a tambourine that the spirit of God fell in a place called Isuza Street and it came down and they they didn't know what happened but it was the spirit well they knew it happened but it was just like we weren't expecting this when we came to church today but the spirit of God came because God wanted to keep on moving in the people and keep drawing people to himself. He wanted people to be filled with the spirit and and he he didn't want people just sitting around formal. That's and that was half of the battle that brother Brandham had even with his mother-in-law because she was used to formality. She's saying, "Who are these guys that are banging on tams and dancing around?" That's not the way we do it. That is the way you do it. If you want to do it that way, it's just that she was so used to being bound all her life sitting down and doing a 20-minute this and two songs. But God didn't want it that way. If that's if that works for you and you're filled with the spirit, good. But he he wants you to be free and serve him and walk with him. But even amongst all that, even amongst all that like the the the the move of God, even in that it started to get all organized and started to go fanatical and then so then you even had seems like more of a chasm. You had fanaticism and all sorts of stuff going off on this way and you had formalism. They almost started to fight each other and go separate ways. So you'd think, well, the church was even more it's it's even more messed up than it was in the first place. But God didn't leave it that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God didn't want it that way. He wanted people that could worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So he sent a man called William Brandham that that came with a word to point us back to the original faith to lead us in spirit and in truth to to show if you if you need a bit more spirit, you need more spirit. If you need more word, you need more he brought the two together. He says stick down the middle of the road. It's spirit and it's truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You you can worship God on Sunday, praise the Lord. And then during the week, live a holy life. And this is how you do it there. This is and this is how you approach God. And he just begins to unfold everything. &gt;&gt; And and we're confident that that's the that that he was sent from God. And we're confident that that the the the gospel that we the Jesus that we follow is the same Jesus that met Paul. We're confident of that because in this day and age there are many Jesuses that are going to speak to you. There's a there are many Jesuses on offer. It's not all the same. There are many on offer. You can't be naive and think, oh no, there's just one way and that's it. And if for someone calls on the name of the Lord, there's just one. Well, that's what they would have said back at the beginning. And then it turned out that the whole Christianom got taken over by this wrong spirit because Satan loves to impersonate and take over. And he's going to try and do the same thing today. And many of the people that that's why Jesus says there'll be many false ge false Christ will arise. False anointed ones and will deceive many say come here. He's over here. He's over there. But and what right do we have to say? Well, I've got it. You haven't got it. I can't just say in my mind I've got that. I've got it cuz I'm me and I'm right. That doesn't that's not the basis. But we can look back in the word of God and we can we can look and we think the same word that he preaches Paul preaches. &gt;&gt; We can look and think, well, you know what? If Paul came and preached in this pure, you'd all be saying amen the same as you say amen to me. &gt;&gt; You'd all be saying amen. There are many churches that Paul would go and preach and no one would say amen. And by the end of the service, they wouldn't want him back. &gt;&gt; So you think, what spirit is that church of? But I'm confident that the word that we've heard was from the same Lord Jesus that's that that walked here. It's from the same Lord Jesus that rose again. Was from the same Lord Jesus that met Paul. was the same Lord Jesus that spoke all through the ages. That's the Lord Jesus that we follow because we've got confidence. We can look back in the word and think, well, he said the same thing as this one. It's the same. It's of the same spirit. And I'm confident then that that because we're the bride of Christ, we I'm confident I can see this world erupting into chaos and it's going to be burnt. But I'm confident that I'm going to be taken out of here before any of this happens. I've got a confidence because that's what he said is going to happen to me. &gt;&gt; I've got a confidence that I'm not going to go through the tribulation and have to go through that way. But I've got a confidence that I'm his. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've also got a confidence that I that that the living Christ is amongst us today. &gt;&gt; I've got a confidence of that. It's not just a it's not just a good story to to make people feel good, but I've got a confidence that God's working God's working now the same way that he was back then. And I've got a confidence that he's that he's risen from the tomb and that he's working in hearts and in lives. And I want to bring it closer home. I'm confident that I'm confident that we have a pastor that's been called by the spirit of God and speaking the word of God and a and a a wife and a family that love the Lord that that are anointed by the same Holy Ghost that anointed Paul, the same Holy Ghost that anointed Peter. I'm confident that we serve the same God and that the same God is dwelling them. I've got a confidence. &gt;&gt; We got to bring this down to home. We have confidence. I've got I I know in whom I have believed and I know what he's done. And I can be confident in his work. And I'm confident that the present all around me are filled with the Holy Ghost and that are that are the royal seed of Abraham that are that are the sons and daughters of the living God that are the BRIDE OF CHRIST. I'M CONFIDENT that you all are. It's not just a story. I'm confident. I'm I'm confident that that I can come to you and ask you to pray and I'm confident God hears your prayers. &gt;&gt; I'm confident you pray for me and hopefully you're confident I pray for you and we we edify each other. I'm confident you love me and you're confident that I love you. &gt;&gt; I'm confident I only think good about you. And I know you only think good about me. And I'm confident that if you ever get a thought this opposite to that, I'm confident you'll fight it away cuz you're a son and daughter of God &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost. And you don't want any schisms in the body. You don't want any division. You just want the love of God to be reigning in this place and to be serving and praising the Lord. We don't want to &gt;&gt; turn our eyes off to some little little drama over here that waste our time. We just want to focus on the Lord and keep moving forward in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident then that that as that that we know we hear the voice of the Lord then that you have an individual walk with the Lord that each and every day as you walk, I'm confident the Lord is leading you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each and every day he leads you. You wake up, you speak to him, and he directs you and you know that and I'm confident that you know where you're going. &gt;&gt; I'm confident you know the path you're taking. You may not know everything, but I'm confident that you understand. I'm confident the Lord is showing you what you need to know. And and he's your he's your shepherd. I'm confident of that. And I'm also confident that because we know this God like how we do that, we're different. &gt;&gt; We don't have to live our life like what the Gentiles live their life. &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said, the Gentiles, they save, they do this, they do that, they buy, they do all those things. I'm confident that that's not the way we live our life cuz we serve a different we serve not the God of this world, but a an eternal God. I'm confident that we make funny decisions sometimes. I'm confident of that because I look at our forefathers, the the children of the book of Acts. What did they do? They sold everything and just wanted to serve the Lord cuz they were oddballs. I'm confident that they just put the Lord first. Nothing else. They didn't care. &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that. That we're all like that. We don't think normally. &gt;&gt; We don't think normally. &gt;&gt; We're not logical half the time. &gt;&gt; But we're not SUPPOSED TO BE. I'M CONFIDENT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus SAYS, "TAKE NO THOUGHT for tomorrow." &gt;&gt; How foolish AND NATURAL THINKING IS THAT? TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW. Aren't I supposed to plan everything? Well, according to God, you're not. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we SERVE A DIFFERENT GOD THAT LEADS. &gt;&gt; He said, "JUST BE CONFIDENT IN ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'll lead you. I'll provide for you. I'll sustain you. I'LL DIRECT YOU. JUST HAVE CONFIDENCE in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're oddballs. We're different. I don't know being an oddball. Leave me. I'll feel better this way. &gt;&gt; It's more fun. I HAVE A MORE EXCITING LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE around the corner. Imagine planning everything and then you die. It's boring. &gt;&gt; We live an exciting life cuz we can hand it over to the Lord and you never know what's around the next corner. THERE'S GOOD STUFF. THERE'S great stuff. Lord, there's so many good things around the next corner. You just don't know what's coming up when you trust in God. &gt;&gt; It's a far more exciting life anyway. You He makes us the most exciting people that there is. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident that man and woman can have a sincere relationship with with the Lord and just meet God and and live a powerful supernatural life. That the spirit of God can flow through them and their life is supernatural. It's not natural. It's supernatural. I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOUR life is supernatural. You don't just live a day and it's boring. the supernatural God dwells in you and he manifests through you and he does things through you and there's things around in your life that are happening. There's supernatural things that happening in your life and in my life cuz that's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that I'm confident that my life's in the palm of his hand that that it doesn't matter what I go through. Whether it's up or down, it doesn't matter. My life's in the palm of his hand. I'm all right. It's all right. It doesn't matter if it looks like it's good or bad. I'm all right. My life is in the palm of his hand. Another verse says, I'm the apple of his eye. &gt;&gt; He can never not see me. You can never not see the apple of your eyes. there. It's you. &gt;&gt; I'm confident that I'm the apple of his eye. And I'm confident that he's he's always watching over me. He's always keeping me like a like a son. If there's a group of children in our park, you always know like when you're a father, you always know where your child is. Where's my where are your children? If you go to someone who your children, they're like, "Oh, there's one there. There's one there. There's one over there." Cuz a mother or father knows cuz their eyes are upon them. And I'm confident no matter where I go, whatever crowd I'm in, the Lord knows where I am. He's looking over me. Isaac's there. Shannon's there. Christian's there. &gt;&gt; Josh is there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lat's here. I'm not going to say anymore cuz then I got to say everyone. And then then if you miss one person, they'll think, "Lord, why didn't he call me? Am I not one of yours?" You're all one of his. &gt;&gt; I'm confident THAT NO MATTER WHAT WEAPON IS FORMED against me, no matter what scheme the enemy has, no matter how much he goes to the realms of darkness and plans and schemes to bring me down, I'm confident that none of them will work on my life. I'm confident that he might come right up to the the battle line and maybe throw a rock or do something, but I'm confident that none of it ultimately will avail. I'm confident that we'll all be brought to N. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. &gt;&gt; And I'm confident no matter what I go through, I won't I won't go through anything more than what I'm able. I won't be tested above what I'm able. I won't go through some sort of hardship and it just breaks me down to where I'm finished. I'm confident and I serve a God that's loves me more than that. I'm confident and I'm confident for you, too. Regardless of what you're going through, you might think, "Lord, I can't take this anymore." If you're taking it, you can take a bit more of it. &gt;&gt; And he knows that. But I'm confident through every storm, through every trial, I'm confident that I'm going to come out better. I'm going to come out more, have a character that's more like Christ. I'm confident of that &gt;&gt; because that's the God that I serve. And I'm confident that the Lord's thoughts towards me, his thoughts of love and his thoughts of goodness and his thoughts of kindness and his thoughts of mercy and compassion and grace &gt;&gt; and peace &gt;&gt; and more than the sand on the seashore. &gt;&gt; David said, "If I number them, they're more than the sand ON THE SEASHORE." I'M CONFIDENT OF THAT. &gt;&gt; I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT GOD'S THOUGHTS OF GOODNESS TOWARDS me are innumerable. They're like the stars when I look up in the heaven. I think every one of those thoughts is a thought of is God's good thought towards me. I'm confident of that. I'm confident that when when we wake up in the morning, regardless of what happened yesterday, if we failed to the worst thing we could ever do, if we say, "Lord, I'm sorry." We can wake up the next day and that we can wake up with a newness of life. &gt;&gt; We can set everything behind us. No matter how messy it was, no matter how bad it was, we can set it all BEHIND US AND I'M CONFIDENT. GOD GIVES US A NEW DAY AND SAYS, "WALK FORWARD IN A NEW DAY." &gt;&gt; WALK FORWARD IN CONFIDENCE. DON'T DON'T LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE. If you mess up all day, don't worry. You ask for forgiveness, you move forward. YOU WALK ON IN CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; I'm confident. That's who we serve. And I'm confident God wants us to do that with each other every morning. Regardless of what you did last week, I don't care. You're you're walking with the Lord. It's a new day. It's a new week. It's a new Wednesday. It's a new Sunday. We're not pushing anyone down. We're not holding anyone back. I'm confident you feel that way towards me cuz I feel that way towards you. &gt;&gt; We're confident because we want we all want each other to grow because I'm confident God wants the same thing. He doesn't he doesn't want to hold something over us to push us down. He wants us to grow and he doesn't want us to do it to each other. He wants us just to encourage each other and edify one another and build one another up. And I'm confident that Satan's trying to steal my confidence. &gt;&gt; But I'm confident he's not going to get it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord said, "Cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward." I'm not going to cast away my confidence. And I'm confident that you won't either. All this confidence you have in the Lord, even to everything I've said tonight, you've said amen because you've got so much confidence. every from from the from cover to cover in the word OF GOD. YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The and even the the HOLY BIBLE COVER, YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN THAT. YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN THE WAYS of God. You've got confidence in his dealings. If you didn't have confidence, you wouldn't be here. But you have confidence. And you've got that because you're a son of God. And that's an inheritance of the the children of God is that WE WE HOLD OUR CONFIDENCE steadfast to the end. We're always confident. We never lose confidence. We never let Satan rob us, but we're confident. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you a little story real quick? when Okay, I'm just going to change change gear a little bit. Okay, then I'm done. We wanted to share just a couple of things about being this is now more in our natural life. You know, when we when we walk with the Lord, it's nice sometimes we know where we're going and sometimes we don't know. But it's nice it is nice to have confidence to know where you're going, especially if you're trying to do something for the Lord. Like like brother Brandon said, you know, if you want to be a missionary in some place, he said, you better know, or in other words, you better be confident that you're called there because Satan's going to meet you when you get off the plane and test your confidence. You sure you should be here? He's going to throw everything to to to shun your confidence. I had many quotes about brother Bram saying that we should have confidence in the Lord and we should have confidence in our pastor and confidence in one another. We got to have confidence and and oh, one thing I forgot too was God's got confidence in us. Yes, &gt;&gt; I should have put that in. God has got confidence in us. &gt;&gt; Like he had confidence in Job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So much so that he one day bragged about him. &gt;&gt; Job was just doing his thing and God open I don't want to make all this but he opened up his big mouth cuz he was so proud. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh Satan, by the way, have you considered my servant Job? &gt;&gt; He was so proud of him. Have you considered him? [laughter] cuz he had confidence in Job that no matter no matter what Satan threw at Job, Job would continue to serve the Lord. God had a confidence in him and God's got a confidence in you. &gt;&gt; He sits up there and one day when the devil walks past, he says, "Oh, have you considered my servant Shannon?" Satan, have you considered my servants? God's got a confidence. &gt;&gt; So, I'm probably talking about this film stuff cuz I'm a little bit I'm not far off making it, right? And and in our walk, we like to know. We like to we're not always, even if we think we know, we don't always know, but we like to we like to have confidence that we do know, you know, where we're going and what we're doing. And I was doing this film stuff's always been an effort and I didn't really want to most of the time I don't want to take too much of a risk on it because I don't want to drag anyone else into the whole thing. So, so sometimes it gets too much and I think, right, I'm just not going to do anything. I think I made I made um finished off making a bunch of those music videos. Then I made the hacker. Then I thought I'm not going to make anymore. This is like I'm kind of sucking away too many people's too much too much time and money and things from everyone. I'm just going to just going to leave it. Not going to do anymore. It's just a natural thought, you know, you don't want to be a burden. I don't want to, you know, put strain on people or anything like that. And then I got to praying one night and I had this thought in my mind that that's what what I was going to do. And I guess I was praying to tell God that's okay for me to do that. You know, sometimes we go into prayer to ask God to convince him to convince him to say what give us the answer that we want to hear. [laughter] But Shannon gave me a good quote the other day and and you all know it's, you know, Brother Vers when we go to prayer, we don't we don't change God's mind, God changes our mind. So I was there and then I I in prayer I kept on getting this word crystal. I was just praying and then the word crystal would come and um you know I think that's such a strange word to get crystal and then when I finished praying the uh I just had this thought the Lord said go and go and search the message and read I told someone the other day it was the 14th but I think it was the seventh but they're both the same anyway but I think it was the seventh if the person listening it was was one of those two I think it was the seventh because he said read the seventh time it talks about crystal now I didn't know about crystal or anything I was thinking a crystal that isn't a rock and it's like, you know, that's when I think crystal. Is that what you think? Yeah. Like in a rock. So, so, so I I but I'm thinking about films and not doing anymore and stuff like that. So, I I go to the seventh one and I think, oh, that's interesting because the six before that are talking about the Uram and Thum. But this sixth one says, Brother Brandon says, I can prove right now. Do you want me to paraphrase it? He's saying, "I can prove to you right now that there's radio waves and there's television waves coming through this building right now. They're all coming through." He says, "But essentially saying, but you can't capture them. You can't see them because you need a crystal that's going to capture that radio wave or that television wave and then bring that thing that you can't see and it's going to come through the crystal and push it out to reality. You need a crystal to do that." And I read that and then the Lord spoke and he said, "I have asked you to be a crystal, which is take these stories in your head and bring them out to reality and you're doing everything but you're supposed to be a crystal. You know, you you'll be the one that captures all those things that are flying through and make it." So I thought, "Okay, I'll make another one." So I made another one. Then I didn't want to make any more after that. Then I went same thing, not not make any more, but not be a burden. This is maybe years later. I'm just showing you about the confidence we can have in the Lord, you know, cuz I'm I'm confident. Like if the Lord said to me, "Oh, you need to be a crystal." I would say, "Yeah, but that's just could be my brain thinking." But I can't make up I get this word and I read it the read the seventh time and it says that. I can't make that up. The sixth time talks about something else, the eighth time about something else. I can't make that up. So that gives me confidence. Okay, I can't make that up. &gt;&gt; Like it's I didn't know it was there and I didn't think the thought. It just came in my brain then I followed it and it said that. So therefore, I think, okay, Lord, I think you're speaking because I'm confident that's how you speak and I can sense the spirit of God. So then I get this other one years later, I get the same thing and I'm thinking about and I get this word tide. Tide and I think it's such a strange word. Why am I getting this word tide? Tide. And I'm thinking about something about the tide coming in. And I'm thinking if there's some something about tide, I can't really nothing really no deep revelation comes about the tide. So I'm thinking, okay, there mustn't I'm just thinking things. And then just as I've finished my prayer, the Lord said, "Go and read in the message and read the 14th time that the word tithe is mentioned." So the first time is the seventh. This one is the 14th. So you know, you go to the message search and you type in the word ti tied and you go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and you get down to 14, which is here. And brother Brandon was praying and he's saying um he's saying about the um he says but as we see our nation rolling under the tide of judgment he's praying he said and we see across the sea yonder black arms yellow and brown reaching out crying for mercy our hearts are full and stirred within us and may the people who was to look to this picture this coming Sunday if you terry may they catch the vision. So, and I think to myself, this is so strange because I'm I'm referring this to movies. And I think, what are the chances of the seventh one? And brother Brandham is praying for a movie that's going to be shown and praying that people would catch the vision. So, I think, what's he talking about? So I go to the start of the sermon and it happens to be brother um Osborne and he had just been to I think it was Nigeria and he had and the Lord had done powerful things there and that they had taken a film crew there and they had documented this this over there and they they' made this film about it edited it all together and cuz they had they had a lot of money that that was one of those people. So he edited it together and he he and it's like a it's a it's a testimony and the people are healed and all sorts in it but it's a it's a film that they used for to to to um yeah just that that that lives could be touched and I kind of thought what were the odds if the cuz I'm thinking I don't want to make films anymore then the law refers me to this this place where in the message he says tide and then it's about a it's about it's about this I don't know how many times can you know of many brothers or people that he talked to that made films And like in the whole message there probably might be this one. Then there might be the time when he said um I went and watched the ten commandments because he got an invite to watch that or some of the I think he may may have even been the filmmaker but there weren't many times where he said oh lord may you bless this film and and I just and the word tide was in the same sentence and then the lord said read that one there. I don't know maybe I'm going crazy but I don't think I am because every time I go like that the lord always seems to get some sort of movie thing. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you one more? Okay. So, two things with the film I'm making. I was in two minds. I thought, I don't know if I want to do it. But then I and I wasn't even even after all these words and everything, I was still like, I don't know if I want to do this whole film thing. Just not sure. So, I said to the Lord, "Okay, Lord, what I'm going to do, I'm going to I've got to I have to know if you want me to do this because this is a massive venture. So, I've I've got to know. I can't just like walk in this haphazardly. I've got to be confident. That's what I was trying to find from God. Lord, I've got to be I won't take too much more of your time. I've got to be confident. And you should be the same in the things you do for the Lord. Lord, I've got to be confident. Now, you can call me crazy, but this is what I did. Okay? You'll call me, you will call me crazy, but I didn't have enough to do this big film. I had enough to make small films, short films. I could make those. So, if I did some sort of sign, Lord, if this comes to pass, make a short film. I can do I could I had the means where businesses I can make a small one that was I could achieve that but a big one is a whole different kettle of fish you you can't I couldn't do a big one I knew I couldn't do a big one there is no way this is going to happen right no way it's going to work I cannot do it and I thought I need to have some big sign I need to see the hand of God in a way that I can't deny it that's just what I needed I just I've got to have confidence similar to what um the uh what's the man's name um that did the fleece. Um &gt;&gt; Gideon. Yeah. So it was it was sort of like a fleece, but this was a big fleece. So I said, "Lord, I'm just going to push play on this film and I'm going to push play and if it all happens, I'm going to know you're with me cuz I don't have an I don't have the means to do it right now, but I'm going to set everything up and I'm going to get this whole thing in motion." And there's going to be two outcomes. One is I'm going to get to a point where I'm going to look like the biggest idiot in the whole wide world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I knew it. Otherwise, Lord, you're going to undertake, right? They were the two cuz we're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousands. It was like, okay, this is and and people, it's going to be a big disaster. But I thought, Lord, I call me crazy, but I kind of I can't make this work. So, so that's what I did. But I I can't remember if this incident was before that or after that. Okay. I think this was after that, but I'd already made a decision. We're going to push place. I booked all the crew, booked everything, and we went for it. Now, I'm pleased to announce that the Lord supernaturally provided everything just one after the other. It was like you couldn't write about it. It was just like I just couldn't believe how it was all unfolding till Satan came and hit it. But while I was in that time of like, oh, should I do this? Should I not? I was driving my old car, my my card down along the motorway on the um going into the city and then it suddenly went and it wouldn't drive anymore. It turned off. And you remember where we used to have the Thanksgiving dinner uh lunch in that hall there, right? It's actually where we pull off in here, I think. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Where we pull off if you're coming from upper hut. So I my car stopped on the motorway and but I was still rolling at 100k and I thought, man, I got to roll off the motorway somewhere. So that that left was coming up. So, I went left, then I managed to roll up the hill, and then I went right. And then instead of going down to where we had the Thanksgiving, I went left and I managed to roll up that little bur and rolled down to the river. Then I parked up by the river and I stopped there and I thought, well, that's okay. We're here now. [laughter] So, so I got out and I was just thought this is interesting. When you're a Christian, you kind of you always think &gt;&gt; either this is nothing or this is something, you know, just just wait and see. Maybe I'm just maybe my whatever. But you you're always conscious because because we we're confident that we're supernatural beings. That we're confident we serve a supernatural God. So we don't just walk through things not thinking. We think about things. &gt;&gt; Call me crazy, but that's what we're supposed to do. We think. We we we we sense and if it's nothing, we think, "Oh, it's nothing." But if it's something, we know it's something. So then I was about to I thought I rang up Shannon said, "Oh, can you come pick me up? My my I've broken down. Come pick me up from this certain place." And I then I begin to walk down to the I sort of walked down to the river to throw a stone in or something, you know, as you do. And I walked to the gate and I started walking along the grass b along the grass sort of bit down to the river. And I walked about five steps and something said to me, "Go back to the gate where you started and count your steps down to the river." Oh, I got So, you know, you I've got nothing else to do. So, not that I thought that'd be think, you know, you that was a strange thought, but I'll just, hey, I'll do it. So, I went back to the went back to where the gate started and I just walked. Normally, I would just walk count 1 2 3 4 5 6. So, I and I just walked and there was a there was a an a little it was grass, but there was a dirt track going down to the river that you could see. So, I just followed the dirt track around to the river. 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 and at 77 my feet were on the edge of the riverbank and the number step number 78 I was in the river and when I got to that point it's kind of like you know when the Lord you just know when the Lord just speaks and you know what it means it's like the Lord said jump in the river was in flood this was June the Lord said jump in it's going to be a rocky road but you're going to make it through like you jump in that stream, you're going to be up and down and but you're going to you're going to make it through 78. Jump in. And I can't tell you if that was before after I said to go for it, but it may have been afterwards and give me more confidence. But later on when I was when I was in a bit of a depths of despair cuz Satan chucked everything he had at me to stop the whole thing. Looked like it was dead in the water. I thought, was I going crazy that day when I did that thing at the river? Was I maybe I was just going crazy. So, I actually went back there and and thought, I'm going to retrace my steps just to give myself a bit of confidence. Did Did it Did it happen? I took a video. Do you want to watch a video? &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, no, you don't. Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Does now I we need the sound. So, I've asked brother Matt if he'll make the sound work. Okay. If I do that Oh, will you play it on your system? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Where'd the sound go? Pause. Pause. We need the sound. It's for added effect. You got to know the steps, man. Otherwise, you I could be making it up. [laughter] How would &gt;&gt; I say it? I just And the reason why I'm showing this to you is because we want to have confidence in God. We we we're confident that God's with us. We're confident we serve a supernatural God. Not yet. I'm confident this will work. &gt;&gt; I'm confident in Brother Matt. Who's confident in Brother Matt? &gt;&gt; Like whenever we have problems, tech problems, we're confident Matt will solve them. [laughter] just while they're just messing with that. Just pause it. Um I'll just tell you the outcome. I'm pleased to announce that my my um fleece that I put out, I said, "Lord, if you're with me, then then I'm going to do this thing and it's going to I'll finish it." So, in about 3 weeks, it's going to be finished. And and the Lord's done some drastic things to make it finish. So, it gives me a confidence. Yes. &gt;&gt; I think Lord, I'm confident that that I'm confident in your dealing. I'm confident in your dealings with with us. And &gt;&gt; and and I'm confident, Lord, that I'm not just like as Paul said, following a cunningly devised fables, but I'm confident I'm following the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and &gt;&gt; cuz Satan's going to try and attack our confidence and anything you try and do for the Lord, and brother Ben would have experienced this. No doubt many times Satan's attacked his confidence. Oh, you can you can't be a pastor. You're no good. No, just give up. Walk away. Whatever. Christina, look, maybe the Lord's not with you because you're having all these things happen to you. They're trying to just trying to shun their confidence. Don't lose your confidence. The Lord's with you. &gt;&gt; But that's what Satan does. And you'll be the same in your life. You know, as you're trying to serve the Lord and it doesn't look like things are going your way, Satan's going to try and make you uncomfort. We going there? &gt;&gt; Okay. But I only this only just I only probably be talking about it because this dawned on me like maybe a month ago when I you know, Satan was still at me. I'm like, "Hang on a minute. My fleece that I put out like 5 years ago, it's it's here." &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Well, that's that's what I asked for and that's that's what I got. I just want to show you this one video then I'm then I'm done. &gt;&gt; No, bro. I want audio. Can you um Does it play? Um um what if I go Okay, what if I do this? I've got another plan. Just wait. I might be able to We both push play at the same time. Watch this. Um yeah, it's this one here. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I'm going to try Okay. You ready? At the start. Go back to the start. I just turn this up. You 3 2 1. You ready? At the start. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to have started yet. Three, two, one. All right. I'm going to try and duplicate this. So, there's a I started from here. And there's a natural track around there that just sort of covered in there, but that's the way that I went. Okay. Let's try this. Ready? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 23 26 27 28 29 22 63 127 38 7 3 4 5 49 50 51 52 53 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 69 71 72 73 74 75 6 78's in there. from there. &gt;&gt; Call me crazy, but that gave me confidence &gt;&gt; cuz I didn't make that up. I didn't make up that the car would break. I didn't make up that somebody said walk down there and take the steps. I didn't make it up. I just But I have a confidence that I serve a dynamic living God. And I have a confidence that you do, too. And I have a confidence that we're the bride of Jesus Christ and the Lord is doing supernatural things in our midst. I've got a confidence. That's that's the sort of people that we are. So, let's have the musicians up. We'll just sing um we'll just sing one. Let's sing a fast song. Oh, when the saints go marching and then we'll close. I can just lead this one, then we'll close.
