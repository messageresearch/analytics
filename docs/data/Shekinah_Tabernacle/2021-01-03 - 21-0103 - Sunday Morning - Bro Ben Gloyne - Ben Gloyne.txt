amen god bless you all today i mean enjoyed all the specials and it's great to have everyone here it's what's nice about holiday season hallelujah get to see a whole bunch of people you don't get to see during the year so god bless you amen praise the lord um let's just go to the scripture we're going to go to ephesians 5. i don't have a i don't have a slideshow today so if you want to keep your bibles handy or maybe brother josh will be real quick on the trigger and put them up on the power point but um yeah god bless you happy new year everyone and um praise the lord i believe we're in for a great year well how can you not have a great year when you're walking with the lord you know so ephesians 5 and we're going to read from verse 13 down to 17 then we're going to go to the book of habakkuk um we're going to read some scripture from there as well could you turn me down a little bit that'd be real good he says but all things that are approved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that you will walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is so we've got to walk wisely in this world we can't just we can't just plow through and meander around we're going to walk wisely now let's go to have a in verse chapter 1 and verse 12. um i mentioned this well every service just merges into one so i'll just say a couple of services ago so are we do we have that habakkuk 1 and 12. i don't think i've ever really preached from this book that i you know we're still trying to recover from lots of late nights and you know so if i appear to stumble around you just pray for me you know one day we'll not be tired hallelujah but um you know it's like watch night we drove all the way from tauranga pretty much rolled out of the car got changed rolled into here head watch night you know so we're still kind of convincing in that kind of way amen have a quick one and twelve art thou art thou not from everlasting o lord my god my holy one we shall not die o lord thou hast ordained them for judgment and o mighty god thou hast established them for correction thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and can us not look on iniquity wherefore looketh thou upon them that deal treacherously and hold us thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the men that is more righteous than he and maketh men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them they take up all of them with the angle and that angle means a hook they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice in a glad therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto their drag because by them their portion is fat and they meet plenteous shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the nations now this may seem a bit obscure but there's a net upon this earth but the redeemed of the lord ordained to escape it amen let's just be our heads in a word of prayer lord jesus lord to not just sing a song that we're walking in units of life but lord have the reality of those words in our lives lord that it's a it's a testimony we sing lord that you've set us free from all our sin and you've shown us what true life is lord your life how thankful we are lord that we don't just have natural life we are striving for just natural things but you've given us your own life lord you've imparted eternal life into our souls and i just want to thank you for that this morning that we can say lord we are not our own but we're yours and such a joy a privilege to be one of yours lord to not be our own i just want to pray lord as we have read your word i probably say the same kind of prayer every service but lord i lord i always desire that you would come and lord you would anoint your word to our hearts lord anoint it to our anoint our ears to hear and and our hearts to receive and lord may you the great author of the book lord may you step forth and speak the words of life lord i haven't come to uh hear from me lord or my thoughts lord i'm not interested in my thoughts law that's they're not worth nothing but lord your thoughts are eternal and that's what we have come to hear lord is your word lord your thoughts and lord that we would be changed and molded and shaped and made more like you and just want to pray lord that as your word says that we are washed by the water of the word i pray oh god may may you wash lord jesus where we need to be washed lord jesus we we need you to come and cleanse us we can't walk in this world with our own mind our own smarts what we know lord we need you o lord we need your wisdom we need your mind so i pray oh god may you just come and direct our steps lord jesus we just want to commit our lives into your hands we thank you are not our own we are yours lord i pray you touch each life here lord those who may be watching now as well or who will watch this lord i pray you touch their lives oh god and may may you be so real and near to each and every one of us today lord those sick and body lord may you heal them as well dear god we thank you for this new year lord we pray for your bride around the world as well lord may you encourage and strengthen her o lord in this in this resurrection season that we're in we thank you lord for this privilege to be gathered together i pray you just be with us now in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you so you may have your seats this morning so we're going to go back into ephesians later but you know paul tells us that we need to walk circumspect leaks not as fools but as wise and and i'm sure we can agree that that this age that we're living in we need wisdom to walk in this world we really need human you know not human wisdom not not not walking by how our society tells us or by culture or you know but but by the mind of christ and and i and i'm very thankful that i believe i'm looking at a people that have the mind of christ it's not something that one day we will receive it but we have it now if the holy ghost is in you you have the mind of christ now i read this from from habakkuk maybe you just want to put that um back up again but you know this net that that he is speaking of here uh to me it is not the same net as jesus would would loud in the parable of the you know in in matthew 13 which is the kingdom of god is or the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net because this net that is spread is to just destroy but the but the parable that jesus speaks about the gospel net that gospel neck goes out the word goes out because god wants to gather a people to himself but this one here all it wants to do is is to destroy now if we if we go down to if we go down to verse 15 you know and they take and they take up all of them so this is speaking of a great this is not just a small group people is the whole world with the angle which is the hook they catch them in their net and they gather them in their drag now drag is a dragnet like how you know trawlers pull a net along that's that's that's a drag therefore they glad and i rejoice therefore they sacrifice unto their net and they burn incense under their drag so they they're worshiping this thing that they're using to catch people with they are sacrificing to it you know they're burning incense they're actually putting effort into this thing because they want it to be uh bitterly designed you know betterly if that's a word you know you know they want a more efficient net you know they so so they give their energies and and the reason they do that is because by them so so by their net and by their drag their portion is fat these people are getting rich they're they're living off this and their meat is plenteous and so verse 17 shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the nation so we know if you look into the history of warfare there has never been a physical net device that can actually destroy the whole world so this is not a natural net we're talking about this is a spiritual net and to me this is the world wide web right so it's more than just a abstract thing this is actually in play right now 100 years ago it wasn't even an idea fifty years ago maybe it was a very very elementary thing but now it's spread around the whole world so and it is designed to continually slay the nations now this word nations now if we just kind of meander through this today well we'll we'll get somewhere then we'll close and maybe we'll pick it up another time but i just want this to sink kind of deep because we need to we need wisdom remember there's nothing and and we're going to later there's nothing wrong with the internet as a as a medium just like there's nothing wrong with the printed nothing wrong with the printing press nothing wrong with radio as a medium or the television as a medium right the device itself is not evil it's what's on it that can be evil or good because even now we're streaming this over the world wide web hoping we'll ensnare someone i mean that they'll be caught up into the lord become a prisoner a love prisoner to jesus christ that that's their motive that we're doing it but the devil's motive is not that is to destroy people now this word too so so to me this this is not a natural net i'm sure you can agree with me here it's it's spread out over the whole world and to me this is what the devil has set up in this day to ensnare and kill people spiritually because if he can ward off your mind if he can if he can shut down even any hunger or desire for god he's got you remember the lord can you know lazarus was four days in the grave dead mary and martha thought all hopes are gone it's impossible but but then the resurrection life turned up to bring him back to life so even if we mentally think well that person's beyond they're never beyond if there's life in their bodies there's hope hallelujah and i'm glad that that's the case amen so so this word nation so shall not continually to slay the nations um this says here so it means a group of people it means a foreign nation or also means a gentile now when we speak of a gentile when we go into the book of ephesians when when um paul speaks of don't walkers other gentiles walk which we'll go into he's actually speaking of people who are pagans so you're not speaking of other non-jewish people in the sense of just a race spirit people are not believers so he's saying that this net will actually ensnare and slay those who are not believers remember we have the thing that can cut the net okay so this may sound pretty all we're enjoying this big trap and this is all a big trouble no we have what we we have the tool to cut the net and free those who are who are ensnared by it now brother braham says um he doesn't use the word net per se that i could find maybe if i looked a bit more but he uses the word web and he says and as eagle as the eagles stir with her nest in 1957 men and women who are born to be free who are born to be born to be sons and daughters of god to live above sin and away from sin is carousing the bar rooms and dance laws because that a web like a spider has raked them around and around until they've until they've caught them into that thing and then and then notice how what he ties how they've been caught into it on uncensored programs the schools and arithmetic teachers so atheistic teachers and all the modern divisions of the devil and sorry to say this but many times the modern church who let them go loosely do do anything they want as long as they belong to church so he's saying this is this is the way that that people get ensnared in this net now he says in the message shalom 1964 but you notice a woman in our day they don't seem to have that lady like they once had they just um they're just like they want to but there's something that won't say they're just like they want to but there's something won't let them do it it seems like there's a heaviness you ever seen people who've got a heaviness on them they're not free and happy and you know you know you can have a lot of burdens but there's difference between having a burden and a desire and wanting to see something happen then having a heaviness that now that you tell a lady that she should not do such and such a thing and the lady looks upon that and believes that she wants to believe it but there's something that presses her the other way see poor thing i feel sorry for her she's so caught in such a web of hollywood and advertisements in television radio and newspaper on the street in the store windows with modern dress and so forth so he's just listed that was that was all the mediums in which things were advertised in those days that was the television the radio and the newspaper and on the street billboards and so on with modern dress and so forth and the way that other women meet her so even as as as how other women were meeting it was actually pushing them into this web of hollywood so you got to be very careful how people you know we can be so we can pick up other you know you know other people's spirits we're going to admire someone even you know in the world saying and we can actually pick up the spirit that's on them because we want to be like them and that actually presses us into this web yeah yeah peer pressure's a real thing it's not just a buzz word it's a or a phrase it's a real thing and so this is and the way that the other women meet her so that's actually a peer pressure maybe subconsciously being pushed upon her to act a certain way because you've got to fit in with the crowd there's one crowd i want to fit in with that's the redeemed of the law and it seems to be that there is something that they just can't pull away from but notice how who he lives here our young people our old people our middle age so it's not just a certain bracket of age or what it's it's everyone that this could be caught into this web now as i now as i said brother brown list television radio newspaper now as i said this is just a medium in which a a message is transmitted so once upon a time we never had printed books like this you know when when jesus would step into the synagogue and open the book of isaiah it was a scroll that's how that's how the message was written down and then eventually uh you know in the 1400s whatever they actually got the printing press it wasn't handwritten down you know and they used to bind books like this but they were far bigger so you know but then the medium slowly changed and eventually now i can read the same bible on here same words same message different different medium that it's transmitted on so we can take these things and all that all that television radio and newspaper has evolved into is social media and the internet which is called the world wide web so now as i said before we know that television radio newspapers the internet they're just mediums to get a message across it used to be it'd be by a carrier pigeon or morse code or there'd be a telegram some way to send a send a message now it's just well the whole world can tune into this if they got internet so it's not the it's not the medium of television or radio newspapers see you can use those things for good amen just like just like these instruments here these instruments can either be used there's nothing wrong with the instrument it's it's the one who's playing it can either call on the devil or can call on god right remember boogie woogie or rock and roll was actually first devised on a piano so you know it's not about the the device or the medium it's what's played over it is the problem so that's why you know so it's the there's nothing wrong with the medium of television radio newspapers the internet social media it's the content on those platforms is what traps people see it's the that content and i'll go into this maybe later later time but the content on those things exploits people's insecurities in such a way because they want to find where they fit in the world where do i belong who you know am i i'm with this group or this group how should i be you know and it exploits that insecurity even even how we look how we talk how we dress the car we you know the job the things with the other material things it exploits an insecurity people who are insecure not comfortable in the fact they may have nothing you know i've met people you know who have literally nothing and they're happy and they're not down you know as i said i think last time i was in papua new guinea we went round by the city dumped to go get some firewood and people are scavenging through the rubbish to get aluminium cans to sell that they can get money they're not walking along like this and life is horrible and i can't oh this is my lot and this is terrible they were smiling hello how are you morning through all ghetto yeah my hammer must be look at you now yeah yeah they're happy hello you know but this is what they're doing they're not paid to do it they just have to find the cans and get money for it but they're content they're not insecure in who they are but then a lot of people they would you know you you put the west into that kind of condition you know they'll think their life has fallen apart how can you take a selfie with that in the background this is my day hashtag i don't know saving the planet or whatever you want to do you know it's not going to work but so it exploits insecurities in people and also we know that it also appeals to the carnal nature of man because we know sin is enticing you know we'd be lying to say well there's nothing to it because if there's nothing to it it won't be you know it wouldn't be a multi-trillion trillion dollar industry so there's something to it because it appeals to this guy so well you might say well then i'll just cut the internet out of my house i'll just you know cut the landline y'all cut you know get all get rid of all the smart devices you know then i'll keep my family i'll keep myself i'll keep my children safe that won't work that won't work because unfortunately or fortunately actually i thank god i can i can um you know pass the emosses on a mission trip in garoka another part of papua new guinea he's on facebook messenger he's sending me photos saying how the convention is going things are going oh thank god that we can be in touch like that i'm really glad it's not a slow boat to china kind of snail mail two months later i might get a letter and you know but we can talk you know so i thank god for technology but you got to use it the right way and the thing is it is an integral part of the world in which we live it is you can't function in the first world and it's coming into the third world too the developing world you can't function without the internet unfortunately that's just how it is well wouldn't life be easier or not no but we we sure it would be but we have to use these tools we can't delete it we can't get rid of it it's part of our lives but it's how we use it but the internet and everything that's on it this worldwide web is like a landmine i mean you know it's like a minefield with snares and traps on it but the thing is the only uh danger of a minefield is if you don't know where the mines are if you know where all the mines are you're not going to be terrified you're going to step on a mine you can just walk through it oh there's a mine you know there's there's stories from one of the um you know israeli wars where the and you know you know a platoon or whatever is coming into a you know you know you know they're at night i think they're gonna make an attack or something and they find themselves stumbled into a minefield but then a wind blows pushes all the sand away and they can see where the mines are and they walk through so you know you'd be you'd be freaking out it's like if you find yourself in the middle of a minefield you and you're trying to do a sneak attacks you can't just you know and you've got to try and get through these mines but if you see them well there they are i don't need to be afraid of this i can walk in this place there can be a mine right there i can walk right through it it's not going to harm me because i know where it is i mean so it's the same thing with the internet or social media whatever you you know all those things youtube etc you know if you know where the mines are all the snares and the traps you can still use it but it means you won't get blown up now standing on a mine doesn't always kill someone but they get severely maimed and how they walked before they stood on the mind to afterwards is very different they they either lose a limb both limbs or maybe they're just so mad they just can't walk like they used to now that happens in the physical but the same happens in the spiritual where you you know you kind of open a website or you scroll through something and you just something just gets imprinted into your spirit and you weren't looking for it but it found you and it can kind of change how you walk with the lord because you can sit there under condemnation and thinking well you know this is all my fault and you know and you can even begin to open yourself up to a spirit and so now afterwards your walk with god is very different to how it was before you open that thing are we all together hallelujah see the thing is when when when something is presented to you you have to accept it so on the on the positive side if you want the holy ghost to come and fill your life you've got to agree with his word that's how that's how you really receive the holy ghost you receive the word right yes but then in order to then on the negative in order to to to receive a evil spirit you've got to agree with that spirit now see what happens is you can expose yourself to something online that you weren't necessarily looking for but then that spirit will try and make you entertain it so if there's a spirit of lust or whatever it may be on that thing it tries to get you to entertain that spirit now how do you how do you entertain someone you make them feel welcome right you make them feel welcome you know you serve them you you give them food you you know give them a good time but then how do you entertain a spirit well you entertain it by meditating on the thoughts that it gives you that's how you that's how you entertain the spirit now in order to not entertain someone you don't give them a nice time you don't make them feel welcome you kick them out and it's the same thing with the spirit that's how you do not entertain a spirit it tries to bring a thought into your mind you just get rid of that thought so i'm not giving you another second in my in my brain hallelujah and eventually that thing will go you've got to remember you've got to draw an eye unto god he'll draw nine to you resist the devil and he shall flee so you've got to draw an eye to god he'll draw an eye to you then you resist him so that thing comes into your mind you got to say no no i'm not thinking about this this is not this is not my portion this is not who i meant to be what you're resisting hallelujah i'm glad we have a we have a resistance amen it's not something that can get overcome no no our resistance works hallelujah i mean so so for example i just i i just put one example down depressive thoughts result from a spirit of depression that's how you know if someone's feeling down and they think always negative and thinking bad about themselves their ability it's actually a spirit making them feel that way and if they keep thinking about those things see see if the devil tells you and he will never say you're useless he'll just say man i'm just so useless i can't do that right i stuff this up i can't even you know i'm doing this wrong with my children and this is going on i can't you know what is that that's a negative thought pattern where did that negative thought pattern come from it's not from god because god says i can do all things through christ which strengthens me all things hallelujah but then that spirit comes along and it tries to make you think that way and if you keep thinking that way you're entertaining that spirit which will result in you having a spirit of of depression and that thought pattern will become normal right thinking bad about yourself your ability other people other believers that becomes a normal thought pattern but that's not meant to be our thought pattern our thought patterns mean to be positive whatsoever things are good lovely honest truth think on those things hallelujah i mean no person was ever born to think bad about themselves in a depressive way well then how do i get rid of it well true repentance will bring deliverance amen and it will bring healing from the effects so for example you know a natural hospital someone who stands on a landmine they may be mad forever but they can never grow their limb back but then in the spiritual you can be half blown in two but god can put you back like it never happened holy and then you have the memory thank god i got fixed hallelujah so so it's not a patch up job and well i'm sorry you're just going to have to have these spiritual crutches for the rest of your life oh no just like our brother john andy's preached the last youth without borders he said the reason for going to the wound healing center is to leave the wound healing center it's like you go to the doctor you don't go to the doctor to live there you go to the doctor to leave the doctor i mean it's just like you come and meet the lord you've got a problem you've got something in your spirit you don't go to him and just live in that kind of condition and say well i guess i'll never get made well no you go to him to get healed that you don't have to stay sick amen you go to the healer to leave the healer if that makes sense right hallelujah amen this can only but but having a true repentance saying lord forgive me i even open myself up to this thing it can only come by actually hating that spirit if if anyone loves a spirit and and and how do you love a spirit you love a spirit by thinking that you're justified to think or feel that way just like brother brahm said about the maniac who came on the platform in oregon brother bam says he justified it does not not verbatim but he basically that that maniac was not delivered because he worshipped that spirit thinking he was right so that's why he still had that spirit he thought he was right on what he was doing and the devil always try and give you enough evidence to actually validate the reason you are but we know he's a liar even if he's telling truth he's lying say you think hold up mr devil you're a liar and you're the father of lies see even if you're giving 99.99 truth you're still a liar so hallelujah amen as brother tazewell said it camp satan you're a liar amen anyways we'll be alive because he can't change so if you actually validate yourself justify you know if you hate the spirit you can be free but if you love it you'll never be free that's why we love the lord we'll never be free from him not that we want to be free but because we love that holy spirit we love his presence we love his goodness you can't be free from that not that we ever want to be free but you know you take from the negative you come to the positive don't you love his presence isn't he good you know he's so wonderful hallelujah now we'll go back to ephesians uh chapter four i'm going to read from verse 15 we're just going to kind of break this down you know um i really enjoy you know some well this is me you know i can just plow through a book i don't really get too much but i'll say i wonder what this word means it actually makes sense once i know what the words mean so if you may think boy you're a dummy well forgive me we're going to go through some words so ephesians 4 and 15. now now just a background to this the apostle paul before the lord inspires him to write this section of this chapter he's speaking about until you know until we all grow into the fullness of christ so he's talking about now this is where we're going he says we have the holy ghost we're filled with the spirit in chapter one but now we're going to grow into the fullness of the statue of christ so this is what he has in mind when he's about to give these instructions he says now but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplier according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love i say this therefore so because what i've just said i'm i'm about to say this bit okay so i say this therefore this i say therefore sorry and testify in the lord that he henceforth now we're in verse 17 yep thank you that he henceforth so from now on walk not as other gentiles now this word gentile by implication means a pagan so it's not it's not talking about other gentiles like other non-jews talk about people are not believers so don't walk as are the gentiles or people who are pagans in the vanity of their mind now this word vanity it means uh in utility which will get into that but also means a transientness now what is transientness thing that something just passes through it comes and goes it changes and so their thoughts so so the thoughts of these gentiles these pagans uh uh are vain thoughts they have vanity in their mind and that vanity is a transientness now just just just just follow me so it just changes it just changes like the weather you have four seasons in one day this is how they're changing you know this is how their thoughts you know in the morning they think about something this way then mid morning they think about it this way then they hear something else they think about it this way it just changes then maybe it'll swap all the way back to the beginning but it's not steadfast it just it's just tossed to and fro now this so it just changes like the weather or in other words their thinking just changes to whatsoever is trending at the time so what's trending you know you know there's there's twitter feeds there's trending this is trending people get caught up all this thought in this way what's happening their thinking is transient it's just jumping back and forth now in utility which is this word vanity it's the quality of having no practice practical use it means uselessness so their thoughts are actually useless that transit they just change there's nothing secure there's nothing stable about their thought pattern this is so paul saying don't be like this be steadfast the word is true we're going to heaven we're victorious the blood has paid it all he's taken all our sins away we're walking victory everything's going to be fine we're going to get there he's going to get us there that's how we should be just just steadfast doesn't matter what comes what goes what yo whatever the enemy tries to come against us worth just keep walking with the lord just love him amen so he says don't be like that as don't walk as other gentiles walk he says he says let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience said no man deceive you with empty things with vain words things that have no value that are useless that are transient don't don't don't don't let anyone deceive you with those things and be not ye therefore partakers with them for we were so i've jumped down to forgive me i'm now in ephesians 5. and 8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light now notice he doesn't say sometimes you were in darkness but you were darkness why is because the spirit that was within us before we met the lord was darkness it was the spirit of this world so we were manifesting by the spirit that was within us we were manifesting the darkness that's why we were darkness but now ye are light in the lord hallelujah so now there's been a transformation take place where the devil's been dethroned off the throne of your heart the lord has taken residence now we are the light in the lord hallelujah so we were darkness but now we're light but he says here ephesians 5 and 9 for the fruit of the spirit is a new goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord now now we're going back to ephesians 4 and 18 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart now it really struck me being alienated from the life of god this is why they're this way it's not from being alienated from the teachings of god or from church or from doctrine but it's from the life of god now this having the understanding that that word understanding is there is is the person's mind how they think um being having the understanding darkened so it's there and that word darkened means to be made obscure so their thinking and how their thought pens are are obscure they're not clear thoughts the only way you can have clear thoughts is if you have the mind of christ if you have the word of god then you thinking clearly but if you don't well your brain's real foggy we don't want foggy heads we want real clear thoughts being being alienated from the from the life of god now to be alienated it means to be a strained away that is to be a non-participant so if you're not participating in something you are alienated from it it's not part of you you can't identify with it it doesn't belong to you so if you're alienated from the life of god you're not participating in its life but if you are not alienated from the life of god then you are participating in its life it's part of you it lives in you you feel its effects it changes you it moulds you amen but if you're alienated from it it doesn't change it doesn't it doesn't transform you it doesn't affect you i think we never want to be in that condition it says through the ignorance so are we still got thank you verse 18 through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness now this word blindness it means stupidity or callousness which is a hardness no emotion so so that the blindness is all being hard you know having no emotion no response just putting up a wall and you know a blindness of their hearts now their heart means their thoughts or their feelings so so a person can get to a state where they have no feeling towards the lord they're callous they won't be changed they'll say no you're wrong i'm right and sometimes the worst callousness is a religious callousness where people justify themselves with quotes and with scriptures and they think they're right but they're callous and and you can actually see it in someone's life because the life of god is not manifesting in their lives that's not effectually living you know this message is more than quotes it's more than stories it's more than testimonies it's the life of god and that life of god wasn't just a mean to be in malachi 4 it's mean to be in you and i remember the purpose malachi 4 case is behold i send you who's you that's me elijah the prophet who is that brother brown to do what turn my heart back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers back to the original faith and in that original faith god lived he changed their natures transformed them set them free brought answers hallelujah brought stability overcame you know for them in their age and that's what this message should do amen hallelujah praise the lord i'm glad you know it's like john would say in other yeah i think it's in first john that we've seen wait let's just turn to that i don't um i said i don't have it on my slideshow but i don't even have a slideshow so he says in first john 1 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shown to you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now if something's manifested to you it changes your life so john now john would actually come from a position here it's not just a second hand experience but that word of life hallelujah that life of god was manifested unto him and now he wants to share it with them it became a personal thing with him hallelujah so if something becomes personal in that way you're not alienated from it you're not a strained away now we're back to ephesians 4 and 19. but i'm you know i love those words of john because i can put myself there that life that was with the father has been manifested unto me hallelujah god's own life amen now um ephesians 4 and 19 we're back there who being who being past feeling which which being past feeling means they become apathetic that's how that their past feeling they don't really care about they become indifferent having given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with grittiness so so people who are past feeling they're not enthusiastic they're not passionate they're not on fire they just become indifferent to it all well years ago god did this but i guess well i've just got a you know i've got to simmer down and i've just got to you know because i've got responsibilities now and you know things are different no no god's not different god's the same so the fire we come in with is the fire we should still have the first love we started with let's continue on to that first love hallelujah that's how i feel about it amen so even though we have cares and responsibilities it doesn't mean we can be a victorious christian amen because even though we have responsibilities you know who cares we should still be able to rejoice in the lord hallelujah so now let's notice he says they turn themselves over unto lasciviousness and then jude would so so these are these are pagan people but it's amazing because in jude jude warns against ungodly men having turned the grace of our god until sorry i'm sorry ephesians 4 19 have given themselves over to lasciviousness i'm not sure if i said that right to work all uncleanness with greediness and then and then jude warns about ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness so the pagans had this lasciviousness now there's a people coming among the believers that have turned the grace of god into the same thing denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ but he says but ye have not so learned christ if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the manner of life the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man after which god is created in righteousness and true holiness having the understanding hallelujah i mean so we're called to put on the new man so i had another um i i don't know what happens with my notes sometimes but you know he calls us to put on the new man we have to put off the old man we're walking in units of life amen so now the question is if the result of being alienated from the life of god would result in someone who is past feeling they don't care they're indifferent they're you know they become callous they're not you know they have no enthusiasm no fire no passion then what would result from being one with god so someone who's not alienated from the life of god but now they are in the life of god i mean so we are not now so now the believer is not a strained they are not a non-participant but he is active in the everyday life he is living in their lives manifesting his word hallelujah because you know if you know if if he is participating in my life and he is my life then he'll produce his life amen says no so so therefore i cannot become hardened i cannot become calloused right even though the devil will try and make us that way because he wants us you know the devil wants us to become ineffective he doesn't matter how much church we go to how much quotes we quote if the life of god is not living that is the thing that really shakes the devil when god puts on flesh he hates it god loves putting on flesh he loves being in his believers the devil hates god putting on flesh hallelujah so we don't want to ever shrink back and just just go through the motions i mean the move is on my lord the move is on holly god should live we should give him free course amen now this may be a segue but what does a new birth do sorry if this is like two sermons in one but here we are what is the new birthday remember we want to bypass this net because this net's over the world it's working it works really well it does its job people are getting they're multi look at the tech companies you know that are being made fat according to bible language because of this net multi-billion dollar company some of the biggest companies in the world and they physically don't really do much but it's all data amen or you know data understanding you and what what is it designed to do work out you so it can make you buy stuff or make you spend time you know knowledge is power and it's so true in this day amen so what does a new birth do it makes us new creatures in christ so the old man's dead we're now a new creature i mean it it produces god's own life in us it is the word being made manifested amen so what so what christ did the bride will do because his life is in the bride when when jesus was saying john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father now so he said he that believeth on me the works that i do he shall do also i mean so if you see the works of god that he did in your life you're on a good road no people say well what about the false anointed ones well you know the bride has to be anointed too there's not just one class of anointed one at the end time it's not just the false remember the the spirit or the rain you know how paul would speak about the wheat and the tears in the field the rain was never for the tear never ever it was for the wheat right so the anointing of the holy ghost was never for the anointed one i mean the false anointed one out there the anointing of the holy ghost is for the bride it's for us so just be just because they do what they do it shouldn't diminish oh we better not let that happen here oh it's god moving there we say well it's not for the tears it's for the wheat so we don't want to push those things away is everyone following me should i say i'm about to close and we'll wake up and here we are you know brother brahm says and is this a sign of the answer when he takes scofield's uh list of mysteries that be unfolded then he added um adds to them he says the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation and many people put a full stop there but there's a comma but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did amen so you may not you so so all that's why all of our testimonies may be different but you'll see the works of christ in you i mean because that is the mystery is now god coming into a person and living his life out i mean it's the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did well now the question is well what works did he did he overcame he overcame the religious system he overcame the the social pressures he overcame family pressure remember his your family he was he was in a house preaching and his family's outside his your mother and and your brethren are calling for you to come out calling to see you he says who is my mother my brethren all that do the will of god right so so he went beyond family pressure cultural pressure religious pressure i mean he overcame hell death and the grave he overcame all things hallelujah so if jesus overcame and and that same person is in you then you'll overcome this world you'll overcome the challenges and the precious pressures of this age you will overcome because he overcame and he can't change so if he ever came back there he'll overcome here and he'll overcome in the future that's just that's just what he does hallelujah he's a creature of habit too you know just like the devil but he's a creature of habit too he ever came there and he cannot change he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so if he will overcome if he ever came back there he has to overcome today and you and i if that same spirit is in you amen that doesn't mean we won't be tested or tried or even stand on a landmine but he's the healer he'll restore and many times sometimes we're going to go through something to warn someone not to step on that same mind well that's not very fair well god just has happens to ordain a plan that there's a power in the testimony and there's a real big power of a testimony being delivered from something and that's the reason why we actually god doesn't erase our memory of our old past or where we fall in sin is because he actually keeps it allows it there that we'll be thankful they were not that person anymore hallelujah that when you see someone about to stand on that mind you can you can tackle them off it well that's a bit radical well i'd rather do that then you go boof up and smoke well what well how does that exactly work you know the woman you know god tailors his people that when other seed is going to come in that they people have a testimony that are in that can actually step into the person of a burden who's actually in that transition from coming from darkness to light you take the woman at the well she had a powerful testimony not because she saw oh not not just because she said we know where messiah cometh he'll do these things but because now she came out of that life because there would have been other women at the well that would have been in the same predicament that would have come to christ as well but she could enter into the burden of them because she had just what she had stepped on that mine but now she had been healed from that explosion and now she could take them to the healer she could intercede on their behalf you following me right that they could but but peter and the apostles they had never been the woman at the well so they could sympathize but they couldn't enter into that burden like she could that's why never ever let the devil use your past against you there's power in that past god wants to use it to shake the kingdom of hell hallelujah just like in the old testament there was you know there were six cities of refuge and a lot of them were built they were actually used to be philistine or amalekite or whatever right garrisons you know it was enemy cities then israel came in cleared them out it became a city of refuge so before we meet the lord there might be a complex or a pain or a hurt where the devil actually is in residence in our life because of something we went through before we meet the lord but then when god comes in he clears out the devil he takes up residence now he wants to use that not to hold it against us never never never does he hold our past against us aren't you glad hello he never he never blackmails us uses the leverage that's not how god works but now that things in our life now can become a city of refuge to someone else well how is it a refuge they come to you and you can just say i've been there i used to have that and you can enter in that's why you know maybe i repeat myself too much but i can i can speak about being a gamer i can speak about being into music movies all kinds of things but i know that was a garrison in my life pornography all those different things that was the garrison of the devil in my life but now i've been freed and so now i can enter into a bird and say don't go there it's really not worth it it's really not worth it it's not worth the time it's not worth the pain you know don't stand on that mind what and it you know if you've stood on that mind i'll say there is a healer in the house today that can put your leg back on that you can walk with god hallelujah amen jesus said to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have set down with my father and his throne it's amazing when when you read in the book of hebrews i just been thinking of this one verse or the first part of this verse hebrews 11 33 who through faith subdued kingdoms so the faith they had um that word subdued means to overcome so the faith they had caused him to overcome kingdoms he said well how did you know give me an example moses through faith subdued egypt he went into the superpower of the day and his faith remember here's egypt they have their pharaoh they have their royalty they have their court they have their systems they've got their government they've got their all their all this all their system of of their nation is there it's not a haphazard thing it's an incredible force and they've got their armies and their spares and everything and here's one man 80 years old with a stick in his hand but there's a faith there's a revelation in his heart amen that's going to subdue this egypt and it's going to release the people of israel out of out of that country so his faith subdued a kingdom that's incredible faith hallelujah that's not just a i hope so no he had a revelation in his heart you go down there and you get those people out hallelujah and pharaoh said no but moses says you're going to say yes and it would no back and forth no but then god just kept plaguing that place because it was moses faith subdued overcame hallelujah so it's the same thing with you and i now we know we're not fighting a natural enemy we're not here to go subdue egypt again but we wrestle against flesh and not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places now to me you know hell is a kingdom it's a dominion it's a domain of the devil and his angels and there's different hierarchies of fallen angels whatever more but if moses through faith can subdue a natural kingdom under the blood of bulls and goats now how much more people under the blood of jesus christ can subdue the forces of hell they can wrestle with hell and overcome why because their chief captain has already done the job but he says now i've won the victory but now i'm going to manifest that victory through you however i want you to enjoy the victory that i won for you amen so faith can subdue a kingdom faith cancer due to forces of health faith can subdue every demon power can wrestle and overcome it doesn't matter how big the trouble may be going through the faith that we have will subdue it will overcome it remember the apostle paul said that with the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god he didn't say faith in the son of god but by the faith of the son of god so the life he was living it wasn't paul's faith that was he living by it was actually the faith of god himself was in paul and that was the life he was living he was living by that faith hallelujah so now you think about god's faith let there be and there was hallelujah and then that and that same faith prophesied the seed of the woman's going to crush the head of the seed of the serpent and it happened and that same faith said there's going to be a new hemis and a new earth other than that same faith said there's going to be a bribe without spot or wrinkle and that same faith said no man taketh my life i lie it down i'll raise it back up again hallelujah that same faith went to calvary with one scripture and with that one scripture it came out of the grave what is that scripture i'll not suffer thy holy one to see corruption so here's a man had a revelation in his heart this body can't rot i'm going to come out hallelujah that same faith is in you and i by the baptism of the holy ghost that's why we should never limit our faith just just let it have its free course let it live hallelujah amen first john 5 and 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world hello sons and daughters of god they've been born by the holy ghost being born by the word amen whereas children they overcome the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith hallelujah so now we already have within us that which we need to overcome the world amen hallelujah say well the battle is pretty bad but we've got the weapon are the devils on every side we'll just start killing one at a time it may take all day but hey let it take all day i mean samson killed one philistine at a time one to a thousand years killed shamga kill one at a time fullest thing hallelujah the mighty men they killed one at a time oh there's a lot of devils in my life and my family just kill one at a time i'll leave the same faith that dropped the first one we'll drop the second one or drop the third one just keep chopping with the word hallelujah but don't stop until they're all dead hallelujah never ever call the truth truce with the devil he can wave his white flag ah no no we're not taking prisoners we're showing no quarter this is on amen so what we have see the victory that overcometh the world is even our faith this is what we overcome with hallelujah and it says in revelations 12 11 and they overcame him the devil by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and their love not their lives unto the death amen so this is how we're going to overcome so this this net you say well it's a very dangerous thing sure it is a dangerous thing but we have a faith that can break its hold you know we know that spirits travel on words just like i i pray even now that when i'm speaking to you it's not my human spirit traveling to you it's the holy ghost right so so just as just as the you know the spirit of god will travel on words so will a demon power travel on words but now it's not just words it's in pictures it's in videos right so now it actually brings a spirit upon people that their lives change but we have the ability to actually break that spirit off someone i mean our faith will move it off remember there were slave masters that were that were beating down the children of israel moses faith kicked them off hallelujah actually caused him to be free of it amen so we have the same faith that can deliver hallelujah amen no no we're still asking the question what does the new birth do now abraham's journey types the believer's journey now i just want to say this first the new birth will produce the promise of the age it will it has to every every down through the bible people who say were born again either as a shadow in reality it produced a promise of that age i just want to take out all the fear of if i'm going to make the rapture or not i just want to i love to just get rid of that thing because there's always a wonder i know he saved me i know all my sins are gone but am i going to get there well remember the word of the age brings the promise of the age and if you're born by that word then the promise the age is going to happen now abraham the the promise of his age is he is going to have the promised son that was his promise that was the promise for the age and abraham's journey is a type of our journey there are three states we know there's three stages or works of grace that make up the new birth there's the water the blood and the spirit the life now abraham had had three stages of his journey now brother brown types this now sorry if i'm hopefully this will just all come together but brother brown types the new birth like a man finding a glass and a manure pile so just say if this was a glass and it's down in a manure pile this is how we were down in the world covered in dirt now that glass can't help itself it may know it's out of place because it's meant to be on a table being used but it's out of place but it takes someone who's greater than the glass to reach down and pick it up that's where god we call out to god because god's looking for us he said lord help me save me then he reaches down and picks us up out of the manure pile hallelujah isn't that wasn't it wonderful when that happened you're stuck in this mud how do i get out of this thing he just reaches down his hand and picks you up hallelujah but now but now the reason that the glass got picked up is because the one who wants to use it sees the purpose in the glass so he saw a purpose in you you're his bride that's why he picked you up out of the dirt of this world hallelujah but then yet i can't drink out of this because it's covered in manure so now that's so that's justification but now it's got to be sanctified cleansed and set apart for service so i take it and i wash it so abraham was called out of the land of er it's like god picking up the glass out of the manure but then he had to be sanctified just like the glass has to be cleansed and set aside for service so now abraham's sanctification came when lot was separated from him he was sanctified but so now i can take this glass i can i can i can cleanse i can take all the dirt off it and i can sit it there but now it's not in use yet but now with abraham and sarah the new birth in their lives was was represented by a change of their name now when because abram became abraham sarah sarah became sarah now the now the word i mean i mean abraham or abram if you look at the spelling there's an h that's put into sarah and abraham's name to became abraham and sarah now in the hebrew that that h represents the breath of god so what god is saying he had to breathe into them that they'd become new creatures that they could bring forth the promised son now jesus would jesus would would breathe on his disciples after his resurrection he breathed of them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost but now that breath only came into them on the day of pentecost amen so so they had to be so so that breath or i say their names being changed they're represented or showed them receiving the holy ghost that was the third stage so now they weren't just cleansed and set apart for service but now they are filled that now the promise that was theirs would be manifested what was that promise they would receive isaac they'd receive the promised son because remember sarah herself had to receive faith had to receive a revelation that she could have the child as it says in in hebrews 11 11 through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised so beforehand she didn't judge him faithful because it wasn't her experience but after she met the lord there in genesis 18 with lord came down in a body of flesh discerned her heart then she realized because that was her visitation then she judged him faithful and the and and because she judged him faithful then she received the promise now have you judged him faithful have you judged the lord faithful lord you're able to fulfill your word for me not just for someone else not just for the preacher for whoever but for me you're able to fulfill your word and my life i judge you faithful you can do what i think is impossible you're more than able to do it there's no problem too hard nothing too difficult god can do it amen but you've just got to judge him faithful hallelujah now all this was done that they would receive the promise on isaac which was the promise for their age so i so i made the same before the new birth producers will produce the promise of the age now what is the promise of this age the body change that is the rapture so if you're truly born again you're going in a rapture if you truly are born again because remember the apostle paul said grieve you not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed into the day of redemption i mean so if you're truly sealed in holly you've really got the new birth you can't miss it there just goes a whole bunch of fear kick it out the window don't worry just press on with god just love him and walk with him everything will turn out all right whoa but brother braham said that you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost every day and still go to hell what's he talking about he's talking about an anointing on your spirit and that's true but god can come and dwell in your soul you're sealed in hallelujah well how do i know i have it what do you see his word put on flesh i mean when when the apostle paul or peter speaks about the fruits of the spirit and says how a believer should be and you just see that your life is actually living there before you read it hallelujah well what's going on the spirit in you bears witness with his right your spirit bears what the best witness with his that you are a son or daughter of god why because when you read in the word how believers should be say i'm living that amen who told you to be that way what he did because it's not a mental remembering what the fruits of the spirit are then trying to conform your life to match that it's not that at all it says that god comes in to manifest that life out of you hallelujah amen now the whole church is built upon revelation the whole church now i heard brother aaron mcgeary say this a while ago but he said you when when jesus spoke to the disciples and he you know your and and simon peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god and then jesus would say thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my churches blessed thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my father which is in heaven and that and i said to thee thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell shall not prevail against it we know that that that rock is the revelation of who jesus christ is and and brother aaron mcgarry said basically all of paul's epistles just are just expounding upon that one thought amen and so the whole church is built upon revelation when god reveals something to you you should always treasure that very very very highly brother it says in the rapture see but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation their whole entire body amen you know we read this there's a there's a um everyone knows the scripture for we walk by faith and not by sight we all know that scripture don't we now this does i hope tie into what i have been saying you know you may think we're doing this but hopefully we're doing kind of this but you know because paul told us in the beginning we read we need to walk circumspectly so how we walk and but that walk is by faith and not by sight now it's amazing well to me it was really neat when i was looking into the scripture because paul is tying a walk by faith with the revelation that you have an eternal body in the heavens already because he would begin that chapter and say that we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens so he's tying in this because he's telling the believers this is really what's what's pushing you along this is why you groan you know i was thinking imagine being one of the believers in corinth before this letter came you know having such a desire to go to heaven but not really being able to give the reason that's causing it because you know we all grow we all want to go you know and you know maybe you could ask that person is it because the world's evil well yeah maybe because it's the world's evil but you know when i get to church or i get to a convention the prince of the lord comes or maybe i'm praying at home and the lord just comes real close there's still such a groaning and desire to go to be to hear you go to bed you know go to be with the lord so it's not because the world's evil necessarily but there's a hunger but you can't put your foot on what that hunger really is you know well it might just because you see the lord you know you want to see the lord jesus and you're feeling really happy well no that you know that may be true but you know sometimes that desire that hunger is still there even if i'm not happy it's just beyond emotion but then the apostle paul would write this letter and say the reason you grow and the reason you have this desire i mean it's because you have an eternal body waiting in the heavens already and that is that theophany is actually calling you that's why you have a hunger and a thirst because you've got a body calling for you to come up higher hallelujah wouldn't that give you such stability because you've got this something you can't express i've got this desire i really want to go i want to be you know but i'm not sure exactly there's so many different factors which may bring the answer but really the whole answer is that you've got a body calling you hallelujah and that's why brother rahm said when you recognize this message with eagle food you heard from your theophany hallelujah hallelujah so he says he says if be so that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan speaking of these bodies being burdened not for that which we would for not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing as god who author also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident so because of this because we've got a body in the heavens we're always confident hallelujah so even in trouble we can be confident in that trouble even in a trial we can be confident in that trial because the lord is my help he's my strength he's my god he's got this other knowing that while we are at home in the body we're absent from the lord for we walk by faith and not by sight so the whole reason we walk by faith and not by sight is because there's a body calling us hallelujah and we are and we are confident i say i'm willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord amen that's why that's why we open with that scripture see you then you walk walk circumspectfully not as fools but as wise that's why we can walk by faith i've got a body it doesn't get old doesn't age doesn't need patching up doesn't need a doctor it's eternal waiting for me already in the heavens hallelujah so what's revelation got to do with not being caught in the net everything everything because you can see it for what it is and you know who you are in the lord i mean everything if it's been revealed that you've got a body eternal in the heavens you'll live in such a way that everything else doesn't really really mean that much to you but walking with him oh yes and your whole motive and objective is serving him and loving him now that doesn't mean you don't have the internet you don't look at these things you know you you're not on social media whatever more but just don't get sucked into the rabbit hole you know don't get all caught up into it use it as a tool as i said there's nothing wrong with those platforms but what are you using it for because unfortunately many people in this day and age their main form of relationship is through a device with people not one-on-one interaction but man people are made to actually have one-on-one interaction not to communicate through a device and that's a big problem why the mental health of this world has fallen because everyone's actually discon oh we're so connected no we're actually very disconnected people and that's why this world is part of it why it's falling apart so i'll leave it with you i don't want to have a transient mind i don't want to have this changes like the weather you know i want to have a mind that's steadfast lord your word is true you've called me your blood has atoned for all my sin you're going to take me to heaven hallelujah and i'm going to win because you've won i'm going to win doesn't matter what battle i face i'm going to win the battle i'm going to wrestle and overcome hallelujah have the overcomers in you how how can't you overcome hallelujah we'll just leave it there let's have the musician's place this morning we might go into these things a bit later but there's a web but we've got tools that cut the web hallelujah aren't you glad you get so you know you see something that's caught in a net you know you just cut it out yeah so how's this going to happen in a prayer the lord will fight the battle and set people free i've got to live a life not i just say lord i just want to be salty that people want what we have not a false you know advertising but something that's real and genuine because this world as brother adrian said at camp this world is dying because of a lack of love but we have that love hallelujah let's stand shall we amen this morning let's sing everything's open i actually first can we yeah yeah no let's sing everything's open a miracle happened i've got some songs to sing amen amen everywhere i looked darkness was my life everywhere i turned was night but one day an angel came and broke away these chains
