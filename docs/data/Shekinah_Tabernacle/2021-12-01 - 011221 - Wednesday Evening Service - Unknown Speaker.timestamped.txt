[31:27] in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's
[31:29] good enough for me praise god my sins
[31:32] are gone
[31:33] hallelujah well god bless you friends
[31:35] good to see everyone out tonight
[31:37] uh we're gonna
[31:38] listen to a portion of christ as a
[31:40] mystery god revealed
[31:41] um
[31:42] we're gonna go just as that's getting
[31:44] ready to go so
[31:46] we're listening through the seals
[31:48] brother brown says in the seventh seal
[31:50] that there's a there's a threefold
[31:51] unveiling of it
[31:53] and then if you really want to know what
[31:54] the seventh seal is listen to christ i
[31:56] miss you god revealed we know it's
[31:57] unfold in other places too but
[32:00] there's a three-fold uh
[32:03] unveiling of the seventh seal in here
[32:06] i don't know if i
[32:09] um
[32:10] let me just see i'm not sure sorry if
[32:12] it's in this portion of tape but
[32:15] brother bam says that um
[32:17] well i'll just see if i can find it
[32:19] quickly
[32:23] he says this here
[32:30] i'll find it
[32:33] okay so this is from oh it is in this
[32:35] message but
[32:36] he says here
[32:38] he says now god's great mystery of how
[32:41] it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody
[32:42] know nothing about it even the angels
[32:44] didn't understand it see he didn't
[32:46] reveal it that's the reason under our
[32:48] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[32:49] was opened there was silence jesus when
[32:52] he was on earth they wanted to know when
[32:54] he would come he said it's not even the
[32:56] son himself don't know when it's going
[32:58] to happen see god has kept it all to
[33:00] himself it's a secret and that's the
[33:02] reason there was silence in heaven for a
[33:04] space of half an hour now that's the
[33:05] seventh seal if you read just
[33:06] revelations 8 1.
[33:08] and the seventh and thunders out of
[33:10] their voices and john was even forbidden
[33:11] to write it see the coming of the lord
[33:13] that's one thing he hasn't revealed it
[33:15] yet of how he will come and when he will
[33:17] come it's a good thing he doesn't and he
[33:19] says no
[33:20] he has showed or revealed in every type
[33:23] that's in the bible
[33:24] therefore the entire bible is the
[33:26] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[33:28] the entire bible is an expression of one
[33:30] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[33:33] to achieve in the entire bible and all
[33:35] the acts of the believers in the bible
[33:37] has been in type and expressing what
[33:39] god's great goal is and now on this last
[33:41] day he has revealed it and shows it and
[33:44] god's help will see it right here this
[33:46] morning what god what the lord had in
[33:48] his mind all along and has expressed it
[33:53] so it's not a mystery that silence is
[33:55] actually being manifested
[33:57] amen which is the coming of the lord and
[33:58] we know the seventh seal it's all the
[34:00] end of time end of sin end of struggling
[34:02] nature into the devil end of all those
[34:04] things but we're caught up in that end
[34:05] of all things
[34:07] i remember what i love about the seventh
[34:08] seal is that is that god is actually
[34:10] revealing christ where it's christ being
[34:12] unveiled it's christ unveiled in you and
[34:14] i yeah right and it's actually part of
[34:17] the end of all things is the end of sins
[34:19] dominion in you
[34:21] it's part of the unfolding
[34:23] i mean so i pray that you you may have
[34:25] heard this many times but i pray that
[34:27] lord will just anchor it into your heart
[34:28] the reality of what what is happening
[34:30] what we're going to listen to tonight is
[34:32] not something that was
[34:33] 60 years ago whatever or history or
[34:35] knowledge it's actually happening
[34:39] it's happening your life is expressing
[34:41] what the prophet is preaching about here
[34:43] so
[34:44] um let's just bow he's in a word of
[34:45] prayer then we'll just listen to this
[34:46] portion then we're gonna have a time of
[34:48] prayer afterwards but it's about he's in
[34:49] a word of prayer gracious father we
[34:51] thank you for your word lord how it's no
[34:54] longer just in book form
[34:56] lord or on tape or father it's living
[34:59] lord because you are your word you're a
[35:01] living god and lord you've put on flesh

[35:07] great grace lord behind our humanity
[35:10] lord we so glad we're knowing that the
[35:12] purpose of calvary is that you would you
[35:15] would forgive us and cleanse us all of

[35:20] move and speak and act through them and

[37:11] that are in heaven and that are in the
[37:14] earth visible invisible where they be
[37:16] thrones
[37:18] dominions
[37:19] principalities
[37:21] powers all things were created by him
[37:25] and for him
[37:29] and he is before all things
[37:32] and by him all things consist
[37:37] and he is the head of the body the
[37:40] church who is the beginning
[37:43] the firstborn
[37:45] from the dead
[37:47] that in all things he might have the
[37:50] primitive
[37:52] for it please the father that in him
[37:55] should be all fullness dwell
[37:58] should all fullness dwell
[38:01] let me put a little emphasis on that
[38:03] again this 19th verse
[38:05] for it please the father that in him
[38:08] should all fullness dwell
[38:14] and having made peace through the blood
[38:16] of his cross by
[38:18] him
[38:19] to reconcile all things and to himself
[38:23] by him i say whether they be things in
[38:27] earth or things in heaven watch where
[38:29] that reconciliation went
[38:32] and you that were sometimes alienated
[38:34] and enemies in your mind by wicked works
[38:38] you now
[38:40] has he reconciled
[38:43] in the body of his flesh through death
[38:46] to present you holy unblameable
[38:49] approvable
[38:51] in his sight
[38:53] if you continue in the faith grounded
[38:56] and settled
[38:57] and not be moved away from the hope of
[39:01] the gospel
[39:02] which you have heard and which was
[39:04] preached to every creature
[39:06] which is under heaven world of i paul

[39:23] behind all the affections of christ in
[39:27] flesh for his body sake which is the
[39:30] church
[39:31] whereof i am made a minister according
[39:34] to the dispensation of god which is
[39:37] given to me for you to
[39:40] fulfill the word
[39:42] of god
[39:45] even the mystery
[39:49] which has been hidden
[39:53] from
[39:54] age from generation
[39:58] but now is made manifest to his saints
[40:02] i want to read that verse again
[40:05] even the mystery
[40:07] which has been hid from ages
[40:11] and from generations
[40:14] but now is made manifest to his saints
[40:17] to whom god would make known
[40:21] what is the richest
[40:23] of the glory of this mystery among the
[40:27] gentiles
[40:28] which
[40:29] is christ in you the hope of glory
[40:33] whom
[40:35] we preach
[40:36] warning every man and teaching every man
[40:40] and all wisdom that we might present
[40:42] every man perfect in christ
[40:46] jesus
[40:47] or unto our also labor striving
[40:50] according to the working which worketh
[40:54] in me
[40:55] mightily
[40:57] now
[40:58] for a text
[41:00] i want to take out of there
[41:03] this for a text
[41:05] up on the entire bible
[41:08] but i want to
[41:10] title this
[41:12] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[41:17] christ being the mystery of god reveal
[41:19] now
[41:20] i took it in order as a sunday school
[41:23] lesson so we could all read together
[41:26] and
[41:26] and uh have this fellowship together
[41:30] now
[41:33] god's secret mystery
[41:36] he had before the world began
[41:39] now back in the back part of god's mind
[41:44] there was something that he was trying
[41:47] and was going to achieve
[41:50] and he had a motive
[41:52] and doing it
[41:54] in order to let himself be expressed
[41:58] because first
[42:00] there wasn't even a moon star
[42:03] atom molecule or anything he was god
[42:08] but he exactly wasn't god at that time
[42:10] because god is an object of worship and
[42:13] there wasn't nothing to worship him
[42:15] so
[42:16] in his great
[42:18] mind
[42:19] he wanted these attributes
[42:21] to be expressed
[42:24] and in him was love
[42:27] in him was to be father in him was to be
[42:31] son
[42:32] in him was to be a savior in him was to
[42:34] be a healer
[42:36] all these great attributes that we see
[42:38] already expressed they were in god
[42:42] so my opinion the first thing that he
[42:44] made was angels
[42:47] and then they worshipped him and that
[42:49] made him god and he started from there
[42:52] as in previous messages i have tried to
[42:54] explain it
[42:56] break it down
[42:57] and now
[42:58] then when angels begin to worship him
[43:01] that was before there was even a
[43:03] molecule in the earth
[43:06] there was nothing
[43:07] it was all darkness there was no sun
[43:10] there's no moon no stars no nothing
[43:12] then he was god as he asked job where
[43:14] was you when i laid the foundations of
[43:16] the world
[43:17] i think when the morning stars sang
[43:19] together the sons of god shouted for joy
[43:23] now
[43:24] where were you see that's way back
[43:26] before the earth now god
[43:29] had a purpose
[43:31] and a hidden mystery
[43:33] and that's what i want to speak on to
[43:35] the church this morning the hidden
[43:37] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[43:40] before the world ever began
[43:42] and how that it's unfolded itself right
[43:45] down to this present hour that we're
[43:47] living
[43:49] then you will understand clearly that
[43:52] you see
[43:53] i believe what is being done
[43:56] god's great mystery
[43:58] of how it's a secret he kept it a secret
[44:01] nobody know nothing about even the
[44:02] angels didn't understand it
[44:04] he didn't reveal it that's reason under
[44:07] our seventh
[44:08] um uh
[44:10] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[44:12] there was silence
[44:14] jesus when he was on earth
[44:17] they won't know when he would come he
[44:18] said it's not even the son himself don't
[44:21] know when it's going to happen see god
[44:23] has this all to himself
[44:25] it's a secret
[44:27] that's reason they were silenced in
[44:28] heaven for a space for a half hour and
[44:30] seven thunders uh their voices and john
[44:33] was even forbidden to write it
[44:35] see the coming of the lord that's one
[44:37] thing he hasn't revealed yet
[44:39] how he will come and when he will come
[44:41] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[44:44] no
[44:45] he has showed
[44:47] or revealed it in every type that's in
[44:50] the bible
[44:52] therefore the entire bible is the
[44:55] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[44:59] the entire bible is an expression of one
[45:03] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[45:07] to achieve in the entire bible and all
[45:10] the acts of the of the believers in the
[45:13] bible has been entitled and expressing
[45:16] what god's great goal is and now in this
[45:19] last day he has revealed it and shows it
[45:23] and god's help you'll see it right here
[45:25] this morning what the lord has had in
[45:28] his mind all along and has expressed it
[45:30] therefore you can see the great meaning
[45:33] of what it's been to know this and then
[45:35] try to bring it to the people see and
[45:38] then you don't i haven't went into
[45:40] details to try to explain it as god has
[45:42] revealed it to me
[45:44] now
[45:45] if you want to mark this down i've got
[45:47] so many places i want to read from
[45:49] and now
[45:50] in in the book of saint luke the 24th
[45:53] chapter of saint luke
[45:55] we find out it's
[45:58] it is the two of the apostles on the
[46:00] road to emmaus
[46:02] and jesus
[46:03] stepped out after his resurrection
[46:06] and they were on the road to over to
[46:09] emmaus
[46:10] going along the road thinking and
[46:13] talking and weeping on account of his
[46:16] his
[46:17] death and how they seen him suffer
[46:20] for what they thought was of no
[46:23] value at all they took their lord and
[46:26] crucified him and
[46:27] and they were going along that weeping
[46:29] and he stepped out from the roadside and
[46:32] began to talk to them
[46:34] about christ
[46:36] he said oh
[46:37] fools and slow to understand don't you
[46:41] know that all the prophets and the
[46:43] psalms
[46:44] see what was he doing
[46:46] identifying himself
[46:49] to these apostles
[46:50] that all of the prophets
[46:53] and all of the psalms and everything
[46:57] was him expressed
[47:00] see
[47:02] and now the reason i never talked to
[47:04] preach this morning was because i
[47:06] thought in teaching we would understand
[47:08] it better than just to take a text and
[47:10] skip over it we just
[47:12] teach it
[47:13] he was saying that all the psalms and
[47:16] all the prophets spoke of him
[47:19] well therefore that shows that all of
[47:22] the old testament all of the new
[47:25] testament and all of the psalms the
[47:28] singing the songs that were sung were
[47:30] sung of him
[47:32] take the 22nd psalm and sing it and
[47:34] compare it with the morning of the
[47:36] crucifixion see my god my god why is
[47:39] thou forsaken me all my bones they stare
[47:41] at me they pierce my feet and my hands
[47:44] yet all those things are them singing
[47:46] that psalm down there in the temple and
[47:48] crucifying the very onesie see those
[47:51] great religious leaders
[47:53] those great man those great teachers
[47:56] and yet so blinded
[47:59] that was reading the prophets
[48:02] and was singing the songs and doing the
[48:05] crime that they said they would do
[48:10] the same thing is taking place this
[48:11] morning
[48:15] now listen close cause
[48:17] i ain't gonna even pay attention to what
[48:20] that clock says i want you to get this
[48:21] thing i want you to see
[48:24] so you can see here basically in the
[48:27] beginning
[48:29] the very thought that god
[48:31] had in his mind he hid it from all of
[48:35] those scholars
[48:37] and
[48:38] just a number a selected
[48:41] predestinated number
[48:43] a predestinated people was the only ones
[48:46] that heard i now search back the
[48:49] scripture down through the age of the
[48:51] prophets and see if it wasn't the same
[48:52] thing
[48:55] now at jesus christ referring them to
[48:59] the prophets and the psalms he said they
[49:01] all spoke of him
[49:04] see
[49:04] and here these jewish teachers rabbis
[49:08] doctors of the law professors
[49:10] have did exactly like they had done
[49:12] before
[49:14] now notice
[49:15] again he said
[49:16] search the scriptures for they are they
[49:19] that testify me
[49:22] search the scriptures the scriptures the
[49:24] entire scriptures
[49:27] what am i trying to do to show you that
[49:29] this bible is the thing that's right
[49:32] the other day standing in a hospital
[49:34] room
[49:35] talking
[49:36] a sister had asked me to explain about
[49:39] the nominations why we was against
[49:41] denominations
[49:43] uh with some denominational people
[49:46] you see it's got to come back to the
[49:48] word because the word is god
[49:53] and jesus declaring the same here that
[49:56] the word is him
[49:59] you can't make the scripture contradict
[50:01] itself
[50:02] in the beginning was the word awards
[50:03] with god and the word was god and the
[50:05] word made flesh
[50:07] amen
[50:08] now
[50:09] here he says search the scriptures
[50:12] they testify me
[50:15] in them you think you have eternal life
[50:17] that's true
[50:18] and they are the ones that bear record
[50:20] of me
[50:22] and i'm bearing record of them
[50:24] and if i do not the works has promised
[50:26] that i would do that don't hear me
[50:28] but if i do the works and you can't
[50:30] believe me believe the works because
[50:31] they testify
[50:33] that he is the word
[50:35] oh it looks like it couldn't be any
[50:37] plainer
[50:38] then all right
[50:41] now
[50:42] search the scriptures he said moses and
[50:44] all the laws and so forth and the
[50:46] prophets and psalms spoke of him and
[50:49] again he said the scriptures testify of
[50:51] him
[50:52] he is the principal theme of the entire
[50:55] bible
[50:57] if you read the bible
[50:59] and don't see christ
[51:00] and every verse of it go back and read
[51:03] it again
[51:05] if you can't see christ in every verse
[51:07] of the bible then you read it again
[51:09] because you missed something
[51:10] the bible is christ he is the word
[51:14] when you read in the beginning god
[51:16] created there's christ
[51:18] see
[51:19] every from that to the amen in
[51:21] revelations is every word testifying of
[51:24] jesus christ
[51:25] that's why these added books that are
[51:28] called the second book of daniel and
[51:31] the book of the maccabees uh uh adds
[51:33] purgatory and stuff like that see it's
[51:35] not spoken of in the scripture see it
[51:37] doesn't theme up with the rest of it
[51:39] there's no place to place purgatory in
[51:41] there there's no place to place
[51:43] intersection of saints and things
[51:44] there's no place in there for that
[51:46] there's no place for denomination
[51:48] there's no place for for creeds outside
[51:50] of the bible
[51:53] so when you see those things they just
[51:54] don't come into the picture
[51:56] and that's why people has added those
[51:58] and got their their their jigsaw puzzle
[52:01] all mixed up
[52:03] they can't make it right same yesterday
[52:05] and forever but if the things put
[52:07] together right there's the entire
[52:08] picture of the fall and regeneration the
[52:12] whole picture of creation god's whole
[52:15] plan revealed right in jesus christ
[52:19] amen that's the whole picture set
[52:22] together every little crooked corner
[52:24] it's just like no i don't mean to be
[52:26] sacrilegious by this but it's just like
[52:28] putting a jigsaw puzzle together
[52:30] that's why we got pictures today it
[52:32] looks horrible
[52:33] say we are believers the cow picking
[52:35] grass up on top of the tree
[52:37] don't work that's when they say yeah
[52:39] he's every way but just of a certain
[52:40] he's saying yesterday and forever all
[52:42] but a certain thing see then you ruin
[52:44] your picture
[52:45] the bible said he is the same
[52:48] saint john 5 or saint john 14 12 he said
[52:51] he he anybody he that believeth on me
[52:54] the works that i do shall he do also
[52:55] well that was for another age there you
[52:58] got your picture wrong again you got a
[53:00] man fishing out in the desert for fish
[53:02] and a bunch of hot sand well there's no
[53:04] fish i had see see you've got to bring
[53:06] him back to where he's fishing at
[53:08] galilee where there's plenty of fish you
[53:09] see
[53:10] you you got to make the picture look
[53:12] right it's god's great picture and
[53:14] there's only one way you'll see it that
[53:15] when you see jesus christ
[53:17] there's the entire bible he's the
[53:19] principal theme of the bible now you
[53:22] realize that any of these places here
[53:24] you could take a text that's just hard
[53:25] for a preacher to hold his peace you
[53:27] look like you want to keep going with it
[53:28] but you got to get back to what we're
[53:30] teaching on
[53:32] he is the principal theme of the bible
[53:35] he was in the prophets
[53:38] he was in the psalms
[53:40] he was in the history of the bible
[53:43] the bible is a prophetic book
[53:45] it's a historical book it's a book of
[53:47] love it's a book of songs
[53:50] it's a book of life
[53:52] and in there you find christ he was in
[53:55] the prophets
[53:56] he was in the psalms
[53:58] he was in the history
[54:00] and he also in the bible is the things
[54:03] that is to come
[54:06] so he was before and after what does
[54:09] that making then the same yesterday
[54:11] today and forever and you inject
[54:13] something in there that doesn't make him
[54:15] the same yesterday and forever brother
[54:17] lee where do you go to
[54:19] you got an awful picture there
[54:21] for he was the history
[54:23] see and he is the prophet
[54:26] he is the psalms he is everything
[54:29] and if you can't make him everything and
[54:31] the same what's your picture look like
[54:36] do you see it
[54:37] all right he is the thing
[54:39] he was the prophets he was in them he
[54:42] was in the psalms he was in the history
[54:45] and he is the things to come the same
[54:48] yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 if
[54:50] you're writing it down
[54:52] he should be then
[54:54] he should be the principal if that's
[54:56] what he is and we believe it don't we
[54:59] yesterday
[55:00] then if he is that then he should be the
[55:03] principal theme of our
[55:06] talking
[55:08] of our thinking
[55:09] of our singing
[55:11] of our walks
[55:14] he should be the principal theme of our
[55:16] life
[55:19] if he's the principal theme of the bible
[55:20] and the bible is in us then he should be
[55:23] the principal theme of everything that
[55:24] we do say our thing amen
[55:27] should be christ amen
[55:29] that right all right
[55:32] since we think this since he's been
[55:35] made the head of all things to us that
[55:38] colossians said so here he's the head of
[55:40] all things to us
[55:43] for he was made for us
[55:46] which we are considered all things
[55:49] he said what about the sinner he was
[55:50] made to be the judge of the sinner
[55:54] if he don't accept it
[55:56] he was made the glory for the believer
[55:57] who does accept it so their thing all
[56:00] things was made by him and for him
[56:04] and it takes the night
[56:06] to express the glory of the day
[56:09] it takes the vessel of dishonor to
[56:12] express the the love and care for the
[56:14] vessel of the honor
[56:16] it takes an evil woman
[56:19] that would wear immoral clothes and and
[56:22] cellar morals to express the virtue of a
[56:26] decent genuine lady
[56:30] it takes a crook and a thief in a man
[56:33] to express the genuineness of a real
[56:36] believer a real christian it takes a
[56:39] hypocrite to show up the believer
[56:42] what he is
[56:44] so all things was made by him
[56:47] and
[56:49] since he was made all thing
[56:53] made for all of us all things was made
[56:56] far by him
[56:58] then
[56:59] since that is true
[57:01] we should make our identification should
[57:04] be
[57:05] with him we should be identified
[57:08] ourselves
[57:09] with him because he has identified
[57:12] himself with us
[57:14] we should be identified with him
[57:17] how by living for him
[57:20] not just a confession
[57:22] so many people take a confession say i
[57:24] say it's got to this place now are you a
[57:27] christian i'm methodist
[57:30] well that's a long ways from being
[57:31] making yourself known as a christian oh
[57:33] look what the methodist does
[57:35] i'm baptist
[57:36] look what the baptist does
[57:38] i'm catholic look what they do
[57:40] see
[57:41] but
[57:42] the only way that you can actually be a
[57:45] christian is for christ to identify
[57:48] himself in you
[57:51] how we got some a stinger there i hope
[57:53] everybody on the tape gets that too
[57:57] you say i'm pentecostal that don't mean
[57:59] a thing
[58:01] it's christ identified in you
[58:04] that's when he has recognized you
[58:08] so i spoke of tongues devils does too
[58:11] i shouted the mohammedans buddhas and
[58:13] everything shouts the indians scream at
[58:15] the snake dance they
[58:17] there are
[58:18] they all do cults clans and everything
[58:20] else scream and holly holler and shallow
[58:22] the baseball game
[58:24] but when christ is identified in you
[58:27] identifying yourself saying you are
[58:28] christ-like which the word christian
[58:30] means to be christ-like
[58:32] [Music]
[58:33] there's your
[58:34] identification all right
[58:36] now
[58:38] and since he is our identification
[58:42] then we should be identified with him
[58:44] by living for him notice
[58:47] god has had a threefold
[58:50] purpose
[58:52] in this great
[58:54] mystery secret
[58:56] god in his great mystery
[58:59] secret
[59:00] that he had before the world began
[59:03] he's got a threefold purpose in it and
[59:06] now what we want to
[59:08] go up on this morning is what is that
[59:11] threefold purpose
[59:14] i believe by the help of the of god
[59:16] who's present and he'll show it to us
[59:21] um
[59:22] now
[59:23] if he had this threefold purpose
[59:26] we want to find out what is this
[59:28] threefold purpose
[59:29] the first thing was
[59:31] that god
[59:33] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[59:36] he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god
[59:40] who covered all space time and eternity
[59:44] he could not is too great
[59:47] to ever be revealed to people because it
[59:50] would be too mysterious how could that
[59:53] great being
[59:54] that never did began
[59:56] that after you went beyond the cycle of
[59:58] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:00:00] trillions of years of life space
[1:00:03] and on out into the infinite
[1:00:06] into the eternity and a great creature
[1:00:10] that was all that and still is
[1:00:16] but what he wanted to do he loved
[1:00:19] fatherhood
[1:00:20] or he was a father
[1:00:23] and the only way that he could express
[1:00:25] it
[1:00:26] was to become a son
[1:00:29] a man
[1:00:30] that's reason jesus kept saying the son
[1:00:32] of man see they didn't know what he's
[1:00:34] talking about many of them
[1:00:36] but now you get it
[1:00:39] he wanted to express himself that was
[1:00:41] his one of his great threefold purposes
[1:00:43] was to express himself
[1:00:46] identify himself with human beings to
[1:00:50] reveal himself in christ
[1:00:52] secondly
[1:00:53] to have the preeminence in his body
[1:00:57] of believers that is his bride that he
[1:01:00] might live in people now he could do
[1:01:03] that in adam and eve but sin separated
[1:01:06] them so now there had to be some way to
[1:01:07] get it back
[1:01:08] again oh
[1:01:10] my oh no this this is rich to me just
[1:01:13] even think of it see
[1:01:16] see what god's purpose was
[1:01:18] now why didn't he just keep adam and eve
[1:01:20] like that then he would never been able
[1:01:21] to express his fullness
[1:01:25] his full attribute
[1:01:26] because he could be a father there
[1:01:29] that's true but also he's the savior you
[1:01:32] say how do you know he was he is because
[1:01:34] i've had the
[1:01:36] experience amen he is a savior
[1:01:40] and he had to express that and how could
[1:01:42] he do it only through christ how could
[1:01:44] he be a son only through christ how
[1:01:46] could he be healer only through christ
[1:01:48] see all things are wound up in that one
[1:01:51] person
[1:01:52] jesus christ
[1:01:55] oh my
[1:01:56] god
[1:01:58] now when i when i think of it i i just
[1:02:00] see denominations passed off the scene
[1:02:01] everything else is going to when i see
[1:02:04] god's great purpose revealing himself
[1:02:07] and having
[1:02:08] first to reveal himself in christ the
[1:02:11] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:02:13] and then to bring that
[1:02:16] fullness of godhead bodily
[1:02:18] into a
[1:02:20] people
[1:02:22] that he could have the premises the
[1:02:24] oversight the leading another of the
[1:02:27] night if he didn't get the tape i
[1:02:29] preached there one night on
[1:02:31] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:02:33] paul
[1:02:34] a prisoner
[1:02:36] see when god gets you to be his prisoner
[1:02:40] then you can't do nothing but what the
[1:02:42] spirit says do
[1:02:44] paul with all his great intellects
[1:02:47] he taught he was taught by germain to be
[1:02:50] a great a priest or rabbi someday
[1:02:53] and he had high invasions he was
[1:02:55] intellectually a great man
[1:02:58] great authority
[1:03:00] great man in the nation but he had to
[1:03:03] sacrifice every bit of it
[1:03:06] to become part of the word
[1:03:09] to express jesus christ
[1:03:12] he knowed what it was to say uh he had
[1:03:15] an ocean to go someplace some brethren
[1:03:16] called him but he was forbidden by the
[1:03:19] spirit
[1:03:20] to do his own will
[1:03:23] oh if
[1:03:25] if people have spiritual can pick that
[1:03:27] up
[1:03:29] he was forbidden to do his own will
[1:03:32] he only could do the spirit forbid me
[1:03:36] he was a prisoner
[1:03:38] to christ
[1:03:40] then this little fortune teller one day
[1:03:42] who you know paul know he had power to
[1:03:44] cast that devil out
[1:03:46] but he could only do it
[1:03:49] as god willed it
[1:03:51] day after day she followed him
[1:03:53] crying out after him but one day the
[1:03:55] spirit gave him permission then he
[1:03:56] rebuked her the spirit that was in her
[1:03:59] see he knowed what it was to be a
[1:04:02] prisoner
[1:04:03] moses his intellectuals he had to lose
[1:04:05] them
[1:04:07] in order to find christ to be a prisoner
[1:04:09] that when god got all the world beat out
[1:04:11] of him and all this uh mighty man that
[1:04:13] he wasn't standing the presence of that
[1:04:15] a pillar of fire that day he was found
[1:04:17] speechless he didn't even he couldn't
[1:04:18] even talk he said god had a prisoner
[1:04:21] then
[1:04:22] see you won't try it to your own
[1:04:23] searching then god had to do this man or
[1:04:26] endow him with power
[1:04:29] enough that he could go down there and
[1:04:30] he said lord i told pharaoh what you
[1:04:32] said and he wouldn't do it he said then
[1:04:35] take this thou rock
[1:04:38] god speaking that's god's word
[1:04:42] go out there and point it towards the
[1:04:43] east and call for flies and flies come
[1:04:46] into creation because he had a prisoner
[1:04:50] that pharaoh couldn't pay off with
[1:04:52] nothing nobody else can turn him knowing
[1:04:55] he was a complete prisoner in the chains
[1:04:58] of god's word bound up
[1:05:00] only to thus saith the lord
[1:05:03] oh god can get his prisoners like that
[1:05:06] now that's when he can express
[1:05:08] the preeminence you see he he's got the
[1:05:10] man or the person so that he knows
[1:05:13] nothing but christ
[1:05:15] you get what i mean
[1:05:17] all right
[1:05:18] that's secondly first to express itself
[1:05:20] completely god in christ
[1:05:23] second to have the premises by this in
[1:05:25] his church which is his body of the
[1:05:27] bride
[1:05:28] so he could have the premise to express
[1:05:30] himself through them
[1:05:32] all right and thirdly to restore the
[1:05:35] kingdom to its rightly position that
[1:05:38] fell by sin by the first adam
[1:05:41] back to where he walked in the cool
[1:05:43] evening with his people
[1:05:45] talk with them
[1:05:46] fellowship with them
[1:05:48] and now sin and death had separated them
[1:05:52] from his presence
[1:06:08] we're going to keep going through this
[1:06:10] but go listen to it
[1:06:12] isn't that wonderful guys looking for
[1:06:14] prisoners
[1:06:15] paul was forbidden to do his own will
[1:06:18] look at the magnitude of that he
[1:06:19] couldn't even do what he wanted to do
[1:06:21] because he's such a prisoner that lord
[1:06:23] said no don't go there he said yes lord
[1:06:25] i won't go there even though he wanted
[1:06:26] to go there
[1:06:28] we could be like that
[1:06:30] prisoners to the spirit of god
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] um
[1:06:37] praise the lord
[1:06:39] so you see here that
[1:06:41] um this is the beginning of the
[1:06:43] threefold mystery under the seventh seal
[1:06:46] that's being unfolded in the sermon
[1:06:48] aren't you glad that there's no
[1:06:49] mysteries anymore
[1:06:50] god's opened his word
[1:06:52] we know his program we can see his
[1:06:54] program
[1:06:55] in here
[1:06:56] he's revealed himself in christ now he's
[1:06:58] having he's going to reveal himself and
[1:07:00] you have permanence in you
[1:07:02] in order to take us back to restored
[1:07:03] world
[1:07:05] praise the lord amen so we are very much
[1:07:07] in that process we're not looking for it
[1:07:09] to start it's already beginning i mean
[1:07:11] it's already started we're in the middle
[1:07:12] of it probably near the end of it in
[1:07:14] terms of for us we're going to go home
[1:07:15] soon

[1:07:18] coming into order

[1:07:24] people say you know you got to

[1:07:34] that we're ready to meet him but yeah it
