[0:54] h
[1:00] oh
[3:09] [Music]
[4:37] praise the Lord good
[4:40] morning how are you this
[4:43] morning I have a um I have a little
[4:47] Psalm here it's um Psalm
[4:51] 134 and it says behold bless ye the Lord
[4:55] all ye Servants of the Lord which Stand
[4:58] By Night in the house of the Lord
[5:00] lift up your hands in the sanctuary and
[5:02] bless the Lord the Lord that made Heaven
[5:05] and Earth bless thee out of
[5:07] Zion so he's basically saying bless the
[5:10] Lord and then when you come to the
[5:11] sanctuary raise your hands and praise
[5:13] the Lord and then the Lord will bless
[5:16] you out of
[5:18] Zion and I think um who enjoys raising
[5:21] their hands you like raising your
[5:23] hands you know there's there's there's
[5:26] when you when you raise your hand is
[5:30] there's there are a few different ways
[5:31] that you would do it in a worship
[5:33] sense
[5:35] like for me there's there's two
[5:37] different ways one one way I when I'm
[5:40] feeling like I need to overcome
[5:43] something I'm feeling quite
[5:46] like
[5:47] [Music]
[5:48] uh like in a combative sort of way like
[5:52] Moses you know when Moses had his hands
[5:53] up they won the battle you know that's
[5:55] like a he's there for victory you know
[5:57] I'm I'm raising my hands cuz it's a a
[5:59] raising your hands is in one way it's a
[6:01] sign of Victory it's like you know when
[6:03] someone wins something they go yeah we
[6:05] won you know it's victory and and I
[6:08] don't know if you notice my fingers when
[6:09] I do that that's
[6:11] like I raise Hall you know I'm like it's
[6:15] a it's a hand raised like Moses did and
[6:17] then but other times you know when you
[6:18] worship your your hands raised could be
[6:20] a surrender you know when you you say I
[6:22] surrender it could be two things and you
[6:24] know when you when you worship when you
[6:25] sing I surrender all you just say Lord I
[6:27] surrender all it's actually a surrender
[6:29] [Music]
[6:31] but either way we the Lord you know he
[6:33] knows which one we're doing and and what
[6:35] our heart is and sometimes it's to the
[6:37] Lord sometimes it's to the enemy but you
[6:39] know we're we're a people that can raise
[6:41] our hands in every situation anden let's
[6:43] some and stand this morning and just
[6:44] Worship the
[6:45] Lord and we just pray Lord we thank you
[6:49] that we can come this morning Lord and
[6:50] and have this opportunity to Worship You
[6:54] Lord and that you've given us breath
[6:56] you've given us a vocal cords Lord
[6:58] you've given us a that can
[7:00] comprehend thoughts and then we can sing
[7:02] these things out and we can raise our
[7:04] hands and worship Lord we we can
[7:06] actually Express Lord from our heart
[7:09] this morning just what you what you mean
[7:10] to us and what you've done for us Lord

[37:01] Kadesh Baria to spy out the land and I
[37:04] brought him word again uh as it was in
[37:07] Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that
[37:09] went up with me made the heart of the
[37:11] people melt but I wholly followed the
[37:13] Lord my God and how did he do that he
[37:15] took God at his word that the promise
[37:17] was theirs amen and Moses swear on that
[37:20] day saying surely the land on thy feet
[37:22] have trotten shall be thine inheritance
[37:24] and thy children's forever because thou
[37:26] Hast holy followed the Lord uh my God
[37:30] and now behold the Lord hath kept me
[37:32] alive as he said these 45 years even
[37:35] since the Lord spake this word unto
[37:38] Moses while the children of Israel
[37:39] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[37:42] am this day four score and 5 years old
[37:45] as yet I am as strong as yet I am as
[37:48] strong this day as I was in the day that
[37:50] Moses sent me as my strength was then
[37:53] even so my strength is now for war both
[37:55] to go out and to come in now there
[37:57] therefore give me this mountain where of
[37:59] the Lord spake in that day that thou
[38:01] heardest in that day how the Anakin were
[38:04] there and that the cities were great and
[38:05] fence if so be the Lord be with me then
[38:09] I shall be able to drive them out as the
[38:11] Lord said and we just got one more uh
[38:14] one more piece of scripture from
[38:15] Deuteronomy
[38:16] 33 um to read here
[38:20] and because we got to realize the
[38:22] strength we have is greater than the day
[38:25] we're living in
[38:27] amen God never just equals the enemy he
[38:29] outmatches him amen he outclasses him he
[38:32] absolutely defeats him right so just
[38:34] want to realize this that uh if we read
[38:37] here Deuteronomy 33:24 and of Asher I
[38:39] just wanted to put this verse in because
[38:41] we're having an Asher here amen but this
[38:42] is all for all of us right and as uh and
[38:45] of Asher he said let Asha be blessed
[38:47] with children let him be acceptable to
[38:49] his Brethren let him dip his foot in oil
[38:52] thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as
[38:56] thy days so shall shall thy strength be
[38:59] there is none like unto the god of jesam
[39:02] who rideth upon the heaven in thy help
[39:04] and in thy in his Excellency on the sky
[39:07] the Eternal God is our refuge and
[39:09] underneath are the Everlasting Arms and
[39:11] he shall thrust the enemy out from
[39:13] before thee and shall say destroy them
[39:16] Israel then shall dwell in safe safety
[39:19] alone the Fountain of Jacob shall be
[39:21] upon a land of corn and wine also his
[39:23] Heavens shall droop down due happy Art
[39:25] Thou o Israel who is like unto thee Oh
[39:28] people saved by the Lord he's talking
[39:31] about you amen The Shield of thy help
[39:34] and who is the sword of thy Excellency
[39:36] and thine enemy shall be found Liars
[39:39] unto thee and thou shalt tread upon
[39:41] their high places praise the Lord amen
[39:44] let's bow his in word of prayer this
[39:45] morning shall we commit our lives in the
[39:47] service to the Lord gracious father
[39:49] thank you Lord we have the great
[39:50] privilege to read your word Lord God and
[39:53] thank you Lord that we have faith in our
[39:54] hearts when we read it Lord not doubt
[39:56] not skepticism but Faith Lord that
[39:57] you've placed there dear God that your
[39:59] promises to us are yeah and amen father
[40:01] we're so thankful for that and as we
[40:04] stand this morning Lord I pray you
[40:05] cleanse all of our hearts Lord we want
[40:07] to approach your uh great presence with
[40:09] sincerity and reverence and Thanksgiving
[40:11] Lord because you're the king of kings
[40:13] and Lord of lords you're the only God
[40:15] and so father we pray that you'd be
[40:17] lifted up and praised Lord as we worship
[40:19] you we thank you for the songs thank you
[40:21] for the Lord your presence already here
[40:22] and I pray You' take these words Lord
[40:25] and anoint them to our hearts Lord may
[40:27] you an speaker and hearer may your blood
[40:29] cover us father protect us Lord and may
[40:31] be with those who couldn't be here today
[40:32] as well be their portion father have
[40:34] your way we love you and we thank you
[40:36] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[40:39] amen God bless you friends you can have
[40:40] your seats this morning so I'd like to
[40:42] speak about as as uh our days as thy
[40:46] days so shall thy strength be now we got
[40:49] to realize as I said before that the day
[40:52] we live in God's strength outclasses or
[40:55] outmatches what the enemy is doing in
[40:57] that day so we're never defenseless
[40:59] we're never hopeless we're never
[41:01] helpless the enemy wants us to think we
[41:03] are but the strength of the Lord is the
[41:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives
[41:08] right so it's the God's quickening power
[41:11] that that causes us to overcome now I'm
[41:13] going to use that phrase quickening
[41:14] power a lot today because if you look at
[41:16] you know if you do a study of it in the
[41:18] message you see brother BR speaks about
[41:19] the quickening power of God more at the
[41:21] end of his ministry that he does in the
[41:23] beginning now that quickening power is
[41:24] the Holy Ghost living right because our
[41:27] strength is not a human strength amen
[41:29] it's not a I'm just going to re just
[41:31] just go a little bit of Wednesday and
[41:32] just continue on from there just as a
[41:34] refresher our strength is not our human
[41:36] strength right we don't walk this walk
[41:38] by our own ability by how we can work
[41:41] things out by anything human right it's
[41:43] a supernatural walk and it's God's
[41:46] strength that causes us to stand causes
[41:48] us to walk amen it's not our ability one
[41:52] bit and I'm thankful for that aren't you
[41:54] I mean cuz then the pressure would be on
[41:56] you but the pressure is on God God we
[41:57] can lean upon him we're not leaning Upon
[41:59] Our Own selves we're leaning upon him
[42:01] cuz our Help Cometh From The Lord amen I
[42:04] just want to tell you friends that this
[42:06] the strength of God is present I think
[42:08] it's more present in your life than you
[42:10] realize I mean when you look back at
[42:12] what you've been through even last year
[42:13] and the and and and the typ places the
[42:16] trials the hardship the troubles and you
[42:18] got to realize what brought me through
[42:20] that it wasn't you it wasn't your
[42:22] stubbornness it was the power of God
[42:25] working in your life amen
[42:27] Hallelujah so now this day we live in we
[42:30] know it's a uh you know I just want to
[42:33] talk very briefly about our day then
[42:34] we're going to move on to our strength
[42:36] right so this day is uh that we live in
[42:39] is described as a time of trouble in the
[42:41] Bible it's it's described in Zechariah
[42:44] 14 as a gloomy day of not day or night
[42:46] but it says there in the evening time it
[42:48] shall be light so it's a gloomy day it's
[42:50] a foggy day it's like a Twilight kind of
[42:52] a time when it's not light it's not dark
[42:54] it's you know but but in the evening
[42:56] time it shall be
[42:57] light the Apostle Paul would be inspired
[43:00] to write to Timothy in 2 Timothy 3 that
[43:02] perilous times would come in the last
[43:04] days so we're living in a day that's
[43:06] perilous amen we're living in a day when
[43:08] gross Darkness covers the people but a
[43:10] rise and shine for thy light has come
[43:13] and the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[43:14] you through the message of the hour
[43:16] right so it's a dark day it's a perilous
[43:18] day it's a gloomy day but it's actually
[43:20] the brightest day there's ever been amen
[43:22] because for the believer this is the
[43:24] greatest day that's ever struck the
[43:25] Earth is this day because this day the
[43:28] dead in Christ could rise at any moment
[43:30] amen and then our bodies will be changed
[43:32] by the quickening power that's already
[43:34] within you amen and we'll be raised
[43:36] together to meet the Lord in the a you
[43:38] know when we sing that song This Morning
[43:39] When the Saints Go Marching In that's
[43:42] more than a song to The Believer that's
[43:44] more than a nice tune to the believer
[43:45] it's a reality am me when you're
[43:47] actually speaking what you're going to
[43:48] live out soon and very soon amen like
[43:51] David was inspired one time to write you
[43:54] lift you up your Everlasting Gates you
[43:56] lift you up you ever lasting doors that
[43:57] the king of glory shall come in and we
[44:00] know that he was he was speaking of when
[44:02] the Lord would rais amen after he had he
[44:04] had conquered hell death in the grave
[44:06] and when he arose many of the Saints
[44:07] rose with him and they went up into that
[44:09] great big city amen he emptied out
[44:11] paradise he took the saints that were
[44:13] waiting Abraham and Sarah and and you
[44:16] know Noah and Moses and all the ones
[44:18] waiting for that great moment he emptied
[44:20] out paradise and he went up he led
[44:22] captivity captive right and so David was
[44:24] one of those Saints so he sung under
[44:27] inspiration what he was going to live
[44:29] out and to me that would have been a
[44:31] tremendous thing to realize what I've
[44:32] been singing maybe for years what I've
[44:35] been believing maybe for years has
[44:37] finally I'm living out the the the
[44:39] expectation of my faith hallelujah
[44:42] hallelujah we're going to do that one
[44:43] day amen I believe we're actually doing
[44:45] it right now because when the spirit of
[44:47] God comes down what's he doing he's
[44:49] touching Our Lives saying friend you're
[44:51] coming to be with me very soon amen soon
[44:54] and very soon we're going to see the
[44:55] king amen so we live in a we live in a
[44:59] perilous time but it's a it's it's a
[45:01] very very good
[45:02] time praise the Lord as as David would
[45:05] say here thou has uh thou has thrust
[45:08] sore at me that I might fall but the
[45:10] Lord help me the Lord is my strength and
[45:12] song and become my salvation the voice
[45:15] of rejoicing and salvation is in the
[45:17] Tabernacles of the righteous the right
[45:19] hand of the Lord doeth valiantly amen
[45:21] the right hand of the Lord is exalted
[45:23] the right hand of the Lord doeth
[45:25] valiantly amen so the Lord Lord is our
[45:27] strength this may be very simple today
[45:30] but it the Lord is your strength see
[45:32] what you what you draw strength from is
[45:34] what you realize your strength is so so
[45:36] if you're leaning upon your own ability
[45:38] that's your strength but if you're
[45:40] leaning in the Leaning on the word of
[45:42] God he's your strength now all human
[45:45] ability comes to its end right but God's
[45:48] ability never comes to its end he's the
[45:50] infinite Eternal God he can't run out of
[45:52] strength or ability amen even even when
[45:57] um even when you know during a time of
[46:00] restoration when Nehemiah had had
[46:02] returned the Jews had returned to
[46:03] Jerusalem and they were rebuilding the
[46:05] temple they rebuilt the walls and
[46:07] finally there came when the when the law
[46:09] was read to them and the people began to
[46:11] weep and cry but but Nehemiah said you
[46:13] know uh he said he said don't be you
[46:17] know don't be sad neither be sorry for
[46:19] the joy of the Lord is your strength I
[46:21] mean so during a time of restoration the
[46:23] joy of the Lord is your strength what is
[46:26] that Joy God loves it when people return
[46:28] to him he loves it when the prodical
[46:31] comes home he loves it when one sinner
[46:33] comes you know you know Jesus said all
[46:34] the angels in heaven Rejoice whatever
[46:37] they're doing they stop doing that cuz
[46:38] they Rejoice could cuz one of God's
[46:40] children come home amen so so there's
[46:43] that Joy God loves to see it when people
[46:45] take him at his word am mean and that
[46:47] should give us strength that because we
[46:49] got to realize we're not serving a God
[46:51] that's indifferent we're not serving a
[46:53] God that doesn't care we're not serving
[46:54] a God that's distant that's somewhere
[46:56] like just spoke the world into existence
[46:58] and he sat back on his armchair and
[47:00] watched it unfold no God is actively
[47:02] working in the lives of men and women
[47:05] boys and girls all over the world in
[47:07] this world today amen so he's not
[47:10] indifferent he he's not a God that
[47:12] doesn't care he cares very much about
[47:15] what you're going through Hallelujah
[47:17] that should give us a joy amen Lord I'm
[47:20] I'm in a deep valley but Lord you care
[47:23] that I'm here you're my shepherd you've
[47:24] led me through here to take me out the
[47:26] other side
[47:27] amen praise the
[47:29] Lord hallelujah brother R makes a
[47:32] statement he says he says there is it is
[47:35] revelation of God that will give you
[47:36] authority over the devil right and you
[47:39] can see why they would add or take away
[47:42] from it would be cursed speaking about
[47:43] the Book of Revelation it would be uh
[47:45] would have to be so for who can add or
[47:47] take away from the perfect revelation of
[47:48] God and overcome the enemy it's that
[47:50] simple there's nothing as such
[47:52] prevailing power as the revelation of
[47:55] the word amen so Revelation gives you
[47:58] prevailing power over the enemy
[48:00] Revelation is your strength am mean
[48:02] because we're living by the strength of
[48:04] the Lord like you look at and then now
[48:06] what does what what brings Revelation
[48:08] it's the quickening power of the Holy
[48:10] Ghost right what you know what brings
[48:13] what brings the promises of God to pass
[48:14] in your life it's the quickening power
[48:16] of the Holy Ghost it's the Dynamics of
[48:18] the Holy Spirit coming into the word and
[48:20] making it live amen that's why like you
[48:23] look at even even Caleb how did he how
[48:26] was he that strong that he could fulfill
[48:28] the word of God that was given to him in
[48:30] Kadesh B saying you're going to you're
[48:32] going to possess that inheritance it was
[48:33] God's quickening power cuz even when the
[48:36] 12 Spies returned and Joshua and Caleb
[48:38] said no we're more than able to take the
[48:39] land Moses said that the Caleb and
[48:42] Joshua had a different spirit with them
[48:44] than the 10 spies who didn't believe
[48:46] what did they what did Joshua and Caleb
[48:48] have the quickening power of the Holy
[48:50] Ghost to cause them to look not to not
[48:53] to disregard the enemy in the land not
[48:55] to say they weren't there they
[48:57] acknowledged they were there but the
[48:58] quickening power of God said that is an
[49:00] obstacle that's not going to stand you
[49:02] are going to drive them out because I
[49:04] have declared you're going to drive them
[49:06] out it was the quickening power of God
[49:08] so it was the spirit of God that gave
[49:10] him the supernatural strength to be as
[49:12] strong as he was at 85 years old as he
[49:14] was at 40 right amen and friends if God
[49:17] could so if God's quickening power under
[49:20] the blood of bulls and goats can give
[49:21] Caleb that kind of strength how much
[49:24] more the indwelling of that quickening
[49:26] power and you and I to fulfill the word
[49:28] of God in your life right
[49:31] now amen so Caleb prevailed by that
[49:34] Revelation that mountain is mine and he
[49:37] said because remember when Moses was
[49:39] speaking there it wasn't Moses saying
[49:42] this is going to be your inheritance
[49:43] that was God speaking through Moses it
[49:45] was God's quickening power giving that
[49:48] promise to to him amen that same thing
[49:51] how does how does revelation go from a
[49:54] teaching to a revelation how does it do
[49:55] that it's by the quickening power of God
[49:58] Amen we are a very blessed people with
[50:00] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[50:02] amen because it's not man's you know
[50:04] like like Peter would say we're not
[50:06] following we're not following kindly
[50:08] devised fables of man no it is the word
[50:12] of God that's been quickened to hearts
[50:15] and lives amen praise the Lord now then
[50:17] how does yeah how did the Seven Seals
[50:19] come open by quickening power that's
[50:21] right by the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[50:23] it was God ceasing to open the book to
[50:26] the elect people I mean to to the Bride
[50:28] of Jesus Christ then how does that go
[50:30] from on tape into you by quickening
[50:33] power Hallelujah Aben we're an anointed
[50:36] people you know a lot of people are
[50:38] scared about anointed ones at the end
[50:39] time I say the bride is the anointed one
[50:42] at the end time we're not talking about
[50:44] false anointed one talking about true
[50:45] anointed ones you know the you know the
[50:47] holy ghost moving that reain is for you
[50:50] it's for the bride it's for the seed
[50:51] it's not for the tears it's for everyone
[50:53] gets the benefit but it's for you amen
[50:55] that's why we should never never shut up
[50:57] the windows of Heaven because of we're
[50:58] afraid of some false anointed one I mean
[51:01] we should never pull a knei raction will
[51:03] they do that out in the world listen we
[51:05] can't answer for what they do we're just
[51:08] responsible for taking God's word and
[51:09] letting it live amen so in spite of what
[51:12] the rest of the world does with the word
[51:14] Let's Take God at his word let him do
[51:15] what he wants to do let his Dynamic
[51:18] quickening power come down into our
[51:19] hearts like never before I mean cuz why
[51:22] take the false when the brother BR says
[51:24] the skies are full of the genuine pcal
[51:27] blessing of the holy ghost moving amen
[51:29] you know we are a Pentecostal people you
[51:31] know that this message has restored us
[51:33] back to a true Bookers of book of Acts
[51:35] Pentecost where God comes and dwells in
[51:37] his church and lives out his Plan of
[51:39] Redemption you know where we are being
[51:41] restored back to that amen we are
[51:43] restored back to the moving of the Holy
[51:45] Ghost and I'm so thankful I'm looking at
[51:47] a people that will not settle for
[51:49] anything less than God living amen that
[51:52] that I'm looking at people who will will
[51:53] not settle for anything less than God
[51:56] taking on over proving his word driving
[51:58] out the devil bringing healing bringing
[52:00] Redemption I'm preaching to the choir
[52:02] this morning I'm so thankful I do amen
[52:05] because because I believe Hallelujah I
[52:07] believe if if if something came in and
[52:10] we became cold and formal I don't think
[52:12] any of you would stand for it I think
[52:14] there'd be a
[52:16] Revolt praise God I believe that we
[52:19] would all of you would say this is wrong
[52:22] something's wrong here I'm not putting
[52:23] up with this cuz I remember not that
[52:25] long AG God moved in power and I loved
[52:28] it and I want it again hallelujah amen
[52:31] why because we love the moving of the
[52:34] Holy Ghost amen don't ever let someone
[52:37] put some tag on you saying oh that's
[52:38] just a Pentecostal thing no this message
[52:40] has restored us back to a true Pentecost
[52:45] it's brought us back to that true
[52:46] Pentecostal Feast amen this is what
[52:48] because the message was come to restore
[52:51] not to take us partway back not to take
[52:53] us back to something else but to restore
[52:55] us back to a true book of Acts God
[52:58] living in the
[53:00] people praise God I'm so thankful it
[53:03] does I'm so thankful we're not standing
[53:05] here with a B living by a bunch of
[53:07] theology trying with terminologies and
[53:09] phrases and nothing lives and no
[53:11] promises come to pass and we just stand
[53:13] here and say well God did it in brother
[53:15] braham's day but that was his day we're
[53:16] in a different day we're in the same day
[53:18] I me we're living in the same day amen I
[53:21] remember so so Gabriel was was was 10 on
[53:23] Friday I know I've shared this before
[53:25] but I want to share it again cuz give
[53:26] the devil a black ey amen but but but
[53:30] but around Christmas time you know so
[53:32] it's about a month before she was born
[53:33] round about you know Christine had a
[53:35] dream where she was born still born she
[53:36] was born dead and she woke up and there
[53:38] was a great fear in the room and so we
[53:41] started to pray against that and then on
[53:43] the on the uh the the night we're
[53:45] driving to the hospital course we prayed
[53:47] you as we drive before any other
[53:48] children are born but you know we prayed
[53:50] specifically against that dream and then
[53:52] so so I prayed and then she said can I
[53:54] pray and So Christine prayed against it
[53:56] and she said I didn't know at the time
[53:57] but she totally forgot about that dream
[53:59] cuz when brother nin would know this
[54:01] more than anyone but you know a mother's
[54:03] got to be relaxed to really have a good
[54:05] birth you can't be tense and troubled so
[54:07] when she prayed that second time that
[54:10] that that dream totally left her mind it
[54:12] was still in my mind and then
[54:15] so then then she comes to you know be
[54:18] born she twists in the birth canal
[54:20] Gabriel does and her and her shoulder
[54:22] gets stuck and it was well wasn't a you
[54:25] just a few minutes but you they pushed
[54:26] the alarm Bell and every doctor and
[54:28] nurse of the hospital was literally in
[54:29] the room and you know but but um you
[54:32] know but then somehow I think the
[54:33] Midwife put her hand in and untwisted
[54:35] her shoulder or whatever and she came
[54:37] out but she was blue unresponsive blue
[54:41] I'm praying you know and then and they
[54:43] take Gabriella then they put her on the
[54:45] table to examine her and she takes her
[54:47] first breath and I literally see her
[54:49] body go from Blue to Pink see this pink
[54:51] spread through her body Hallelujah she's
[54:54] a miracle child amen but what caused
[54:57] what caused that dream to be forgotten
[54:59] the quickening power of God I mean what
[55:01] caused what caused her to be born
[55:03] healthy and well the quickening power of
[55:05] God I mean we know we commit all things
[55:07] into God's hands and however things
[55:08] happen we know ultimately he's in
[55:10] control but why should we just sit back
[55:12] and be passive about things when we have
[55:14] the Holy Ghost living in our lives why
[55:16] not push the battle take God at his word
[55:19] and don't pull back for nothing
[55:21] Hallelujah why cuz we are full of the
[55:23] quickening power of God today you may
[55:26] not feel it it's not a feeling you may
[55:28] have a lot of trouble in your heart it's
[55:30] deeper than that amen it's in the soul

[55:34] and in your spirit but the Holy Ghost
[55:36] dwells in the soul

[59:04] no perils nor nothing can separate us
[59:07] from the purpose of the Living God what
[59:09] God has imagined in his mind what God

[59:16] there's nothing that can ever separate
[59:19] uh God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it

[59:28] preparation to conserve to his own
[59:31] purpose he will conserve a church he
[59:33] will conserve a people he will conserve
[59:35] subjects for his great domain that death
[59:37] cannot destroy and we realize that it is
[59:40] by faith that we believe this by the
[59:42] resurrection uh but the resurrection
[59:44] produces a solid foundation on which our
[59:47] faith rests why do we believe that
[59:49] quickening power that was Quicken to you
[59:52] that's why you believe it this morning
[59:54] amen nothing can destroy it as the poet
[59:57] once wrote Oh What A foraste of Glory
[59:59] Divine air of Salvation purchased of God
[1:00:02] born of his Spirit washed in his blood
[1:00:04] what an assurance upon the solid rock
[1:00:06] the resurrection of our blessed lover
[1:00:09] the Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it it
[1:00:11] has been planted it is the seed of God
[1:00:13] it is a purpose of God to give us the
[1:00:15] Blessed holy spirit it's the Blessed
[1:00:17] purpose of God to show us signs and
[1:00:19] wonders and miracles it's the purpose of
[1:00:21] God and nothing can destroy it all
[1:00:23] powers of Hell might wager against it
[1:00:26] but it will but it will prevail we have
[1:00:29] God's Eternal promise am mean there
[1:00:32] there may be teachers that uh you maybe
[1:00:34] isms rise there may be great programs
[1:00:36] rise there may be things that look like
[1:00:38] that it would uh would be destroyed but
[1:00:40] could never be destroyed it's the
[1:00:42] purpose of God to see that it will
[1:00:44] prevail then it's not up to me it's not
[1:00:46] up to you whether it we be destroyed or
[1:00:48] not it's up to God and we can rest upon
[1:00:50] it that God will never let our heritage
[1:00:53] be destroyed for it's his purpose to
[1:00:55] give it to us hallelujah amen so if that
[1:00:59] is so so if God be for us who can be
[1:01:01] against us amen if God be your strength
[1:01:03] amen that's kept you alive all these
[1:01:05] years that's kept you in the faith who
[1:01:07] can be against you
[1:01:10] hallelujah amen you know we are so
[1:01:13] blessed today that God has brought a
[1:01:16] perfect balance in the scripture amen
[1:01:19] that that we know well I'm I'm just
[1:01:21] going to wait let's just put this up and
[1:01:22] then I'll come to what I'm about to say
[1:01:24] here he says but the path of the justice
[1:01:26] is The Shining Light that shineth more
[1:01:28] and more until the perfect day so the
[1:01:30] path that we're walking is not obscured
[1:01:34] it's not become darkened even though
[1:01:35] there's so many opinions and things out
[1:01:37] there our path has not been darkened by
[1:01:39] those things because God has has has
[1:01:42] revealed to us his path for us to walk
[1:01:45] in right we're not guessing how to walk
[1:01:47] with God we're not guessing who God is
[1:01:50] he's been revealed through the entire
[1:01:51] message right amen but you see also this
[1:01:54] path shines more and more perfect per
[1:01:56] because we are not trusting because it
[1:01:58] used to be the path was tried to be
[1:02:00] walked by it's your Works to get you to
[1:02:02] heaven or have you done enough you know
[1:02:04] it was it was it was there was a human
[1:02:06] pressure that came in to say can you
[1:02:08] walk this path and that to me obscures
[1:02:12] the path because it puts the pressure on
[1:02:15] the individual as opposed to the ability
[1:02:17] of God right but now we have we have
[1:02:21] come down into this day where God has
[1:02:23] revealed to us that we come from God and
[1:02:26] we go back to God God can't lose any of
[1:02:29] his
[1:02:29] children amen God God can't lose a
[1:02:32] single one of his children right the
[1:02:34] devil has all these schemes and plans to
[1:02:36] try and get us off the road and all
[1:02:38] these things but God can't lose any of
[1:02:39] his children amen and then we know that
[1:02:42] election God does not change our mind uh
[1:02:45] change his mind about us this is our
[1:02:47] strength right you got because you got
[1:02:49] to draw from your strength amen when
[1:02:51] you're going through hard times right
[1:02:52] you realize that God God doesn't change
[1:02:54] his mind about any one you're accepted
[1:02:57] in the Beloved you're accepted in the
[1:02:59] Beloved you're loved by him you're loved
[1:03:00] by him amen if you're one of his you can
[1:03:02] never become not one of his amen now to
[1:03:06] me if that's been revealed then it
[1:03:09] should give us such a strength I want to
[1:03:11] walk with you Lord that's I'm yours I
[1:03:13] want to be fully identified with you I'm
[1:03:15] made in your image so I want to be your
[1:03:17] image I want to be just like you amen so
[1:03:19] all that you are your word says I want
[1:03:21] to become that's right
[1:03:24] amen praise the Lord let's just I just
[1:03:26] want to go down to this here see Peter
[1:03:30] would say here that Peter an apostle of
[1:03:32] Jesus Christ The Strangers scared
[1:03:33] throughout pontis and galatia capadia
[1:03:36] Asia and um Beth or whatever elect
[1:03:38] according to the for knowledge of of God
[1:03:40] the father now forn knowledge has been
[1:03:43] very misunderstood in this day forn
[1:03:45] knowledge people seem to think and and
[1:03:47] and sure there's probably some quotes
[1:03:49] you about this to say well God saw you
[1:03:51] through time choosing him it's much
[1:03:55] deeper than that
[1:03:56] for knowledge is you're you're you're
[1:03:59] known
[1:04:01] beforehand okay so it's more than just
[1:04:03] because remember if the pressure is well
[1:04:04] if God saw me choosing him then I'm his
[1:04:07] but then what happens if I unchoose
[1:04:09] him it's much see God God don't run his
[1:04:12] business haphazardly God do not just
[1:04:15] stab in the dark kind of see how it goes
[1:04:17] kind of a god he's very sure right so
[1:04:19] when he talks about for knowledge before
[1:04:21] the foundation of the world he saw you
[1:04:25] he knew your parents he knew your
[1:04:26] grandparents he knew how you come to
[1:04:28] this earth amen he saw you at your best
[1:04:32] Made In His Image robed him white
[1:04:34] dancing around the throne like he asked
[1:04:36] job where were you when the morning
[1:04:38] Stars shouted for joy in the sons of God
[1:04:40] where were you job he's trying to get
[1:04:42] job to see job I Saw You by for
[1:04:44] knowledge I saw you not as you are right
[1:04:47] now on this trial of this ash Heep lost
[1:04:49] everything right I didn't see you like
[1:04:52] this job I saw you redeemed washed my
[1:04:55] blood to my image dancing around the
[1:04:57] throne in a Eternal glorified body
[1:05:00] hallelujah amen so that's what for
[1:05:02] knowledge is God saw you and what he
[1:05:06] sees will come to pass amen he believed
[1:05:09] he sees it he believes it he speaks it
[1:05:11] and here it is it's material amen so God
[1:05:14] remember God does not save anyone to
[1:05:16] lose anyone when you really have a true
[1:05:19] salvation you can't lose it you can't
[1:05:22] lose it it's secure amen as as Paul
[1:05:26] would write grieve not the Holy Ghost we
[1:05:27] by your seal to the day of your
[1:05:29] Redemption Hallelujah see to me if we
[1:05:33] speak about these kind of things it
[1:05:34] should make the path even brighter I'm
[1:05:36] his he thought of me Hallelujah maybe
[1:05:40] not in the state not in the state ofen
[1:05:42] now the troubles and the things going on
[1:05:45] and complexes or whatever more he didn't
[1:05:47] see me like this he saw me in a perfect
[1:05:50] body sinless what Made In His Image
[1:05:54] dancing around his strong that's why I
[1:05:55] love you know When the Saints Go
[1:05:57] Marching In I believe God gave that song
[1:06:00] and CU God wanted it to Quicken it to
[1:06:02] the m to to the artist or musician who
[1:06:05] wrote it that when it's sung it will be
[1:06:08] quickening power will come and put it
[1:06:10] into a heart of a person where they can
[1:06:12] realize Lord like I was sing you you we
[1:06:15] were singing that when we crown him Lord
[1:06:16] of you know when we crown him Lord of
[1:06:18] all I was thinking Lord I don't know how
[1:06:21] though the hands that are going to touch
[1:06:22] that crown that are againsts your
[1:06:23] blessed head but I don't care I want to
[1:06:25] see it happen hallelujah what does that
[1:06:28] to me it's quickening power I'm part of
[1:06:30] the scene
[1:06:33] hallelujah amen praise God and I trust
[1:06:36] that gives you strength today those kind
[1:06:38] of things right amen praise the Lord now
[1:06:42] I'm just trying to find I've kind of
[1:06:43] jumped and as I do
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:49] amen Paul would say here he says but ye
[1:06:53] not in the flesh but in the spirit if so
[1:06:55] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[1:06:57] any man have none of the spirit have not
[1:06:59] the spirit of Christ he's none of his
[1:07:01] but if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:07:03] because of sin but the spirit of life
[1:07:04] because of righteousness but if the
[1:07:06] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:07:08] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:07:11] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:07:13] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:07:15] dwelleth in you this is his quickening
[1:07:18] power that dwells he but if he dwells in
[1:07:21] you he'll also Quicken your mortal
[1:07:22] bodies that it doesn't matter if if you
[1:07:25] go by the way of the Grave or if you're
[1:07:28] alive and you're changed there's that
[1:07:29] quickening power dwells within you
[1:07:31] already
[1:07:33] hallelujah amen and that's why we know
[1:07:35] Jesus Jesus died on Calvary that his
[1:07:37] quickening life his life would come into
[1:07:40] a people amen praise the Lord now this
[1:07:44] quickening power God don't want to stay
[1:07:46] all by
[1:07:47] himself he wants his Spirit to spread am
[1:07:51] mean God's all about finding his plan is
[1:07:54] I want to find my bride
[1:07:56] that's this is his heart right now I
[1:07:58] want to find her and when I found her I
[1:08:00] want to strengthen her I want to
[1:08:02] encourage her I want to show her who she
[1:08:04] is I want her to know I know her that's
[1:08:08] why the message came your way for you to
[1:08:10] realize God knows you how it's one thing
[1:08:13] God I know you but when God says God I
[1:08:14] know
[1:08:15] you hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[1:08:19] that's what that's what our God
[1:08:21] does Amen but but how does that come by
[1:08:24] quickening power
[1:08:27] praise the Lord amen this quickening
[1:08:30] power also breaks the Yoke it destroys
[1:08:32] the Yoke of the enemy amen the Yoke of
[1:08:35] the enemy shall be destroyed because the
[1:08:37] anointing or the quickening power will
[1:08:39] destroy it and that's why I believe I
[1:08:40] said earlier we love the moving of the
[1:08:43] spirit we love the anointing because we
[1:08:46] know when God comes down something's
[1:08:47] going to happen am mean no one can stay
[1:08:50] the same when God comes down to a
[1:08:51] meeting I mean that's why we love Camp
[1:08:53] cuz because what makes Camp him amen he
[1:08:58] makes Camp right why do we love church
[1:09:00] him amen because we realize whatever
[1:09:02] troubles are uh uh the monkeys on our
[1:09:05] back am mean they ain't going to stay
[1:09:06] there by the time the service is done
[1:09:08] why cuz the anointing the washing by the
[1:09:10] water of the word is going to come and
[1:09:12] break the Yoke destroy the Yoke of the
[1:09:13] enemy that that monkey may be a big AP
[1:09:15] in size but it'll be dead at your feet
[1:09:17] by the time you walk out these doors
[1:09:19] hallelujah amen why because there's a
[1:09:22] quickening going on I mean there's an
[1:09:23] Awakening going on for you to realize
[1:09:25] hey this thing belongs under my feet I
[1:09:27] mean this is a rug on my you rug on my
[1:09:30] floor it doesn't belong on my head it
[1:09:31] belongs under my feet no matter what it
[1:09:33] is amen hallelujah and it's so important
[1:09:37] that we let the quickening power
[1:09:39] move hallelujah amen like you know we we
[1:09:43] are told by we're told by um sorry our
[1:09:47] last our last few family prayers have
[1:09:49] been a theme around sincerity and and
[1:09:52] and when when Jesus asks his disciples
[1:09:54] who do you say that I am
[1:09:56] Simon Peter we know he says you know
[1:09:58] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:09:59] Living God and Jesus would say bless art
[1:10:01] thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood
[1:10:03] is not revealed this unto thee but my
[1:10:05] Father which is in heaven quickening
[1:10:07] Powers reveal this to you Peter and I
[1:10:09] say unto thee that thou art Peter and

[1:10:12] revelation of who Jesus Christ is I'll
[1:10:15] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:10:17] shall not Prevail against it and I will
[1:10:19] give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of
[1:10:20] Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on
[1:10:23] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:10:25] whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth
[1:10:27] shall be loosed in heaven amen so
[1:10:30] there's now a power to bind and loose
[1:10:32] that comes into the church this is not
[1:10:33] just for Peter this is for every
[1:10:36] believer there's a power the the
[1:10:38] quickening power of God because you got
[1:10:39] to realize that everything must obey God
[1:10:43] it doesn't want to but everything will
[1:10:44] obey like one day every knee will bow
[1:10:47] and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:10:49] Satan himself will have to bow amen the
[1:10:52] our great enemy in all of its hordes of
[1:10:54] Hell will all bow that day and confess
[1:10:57] that Jesus Christ is Lord he is the
[1:10:58] Supreme one he's basically saying what I
[1:11:00] tried to do cuz Satan wanted to become
[1:11:02] the Supreme one by but by him confessing
[1:11:05] that he is Lord he's saying I couldn't
[1:11:07] do it why because nothing can stop God's
[1:11:09] prevailing power his strength am mean
[1:11:12] but you got to realize that the Demon's
[1:11:13] bowing is not just for that day it's for
[1:11:16] this day I mean that's why quickening
[1:11:18] power comes into the church is that
[1:11:20] every enemy must bow to the name of
[1:11:22] Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what it
[1:11:24] is amen but it must bow and that's why
[1:11:27] we have over a thousand sermons of so
[1:11:29] many prayer lines I guarantee if you're
[1:11:32] going through something it's already
[1:11:33] been cast out that's right it was
[1:11:36] already defeated that day on Calvary but
[1:11:38] God sent you know he sent us the Prophet
[1:11:42] Elijah brother Braham in this day to
[1:11:44] remind us everything must bow to the
[1:11:46] name of Jesus Christ if you're sincere
[1:11:48] when you pray nothing can stop it amen
[1:11:51] if you let Faith take control nothing
[1:11:52] can stop that prayer am mean God will
[1:11:54] answer it in his time amen so now
[1:11:56] there's a power that's come in into our
[1:11:59] lives we have the power to bind and the
[1:12:01] power to
[1:12:02] loose I think you know to me when I read
[1:12:05] this I'm like I feel a lot more sincere
[1:12:07] we're not here playing games we're not
[1:12:09] here just just haphazardly well this is
[1:12:11] something I do know life and death is in
[1:12:13] the power of my tongue I me when you're
[1:12:15] when you're an anointed son or daughter
[1:12:17] of God there's more life you your your
[1:12:20] words have far more power than anyone
[1:12:22] out there right so now we have the power
[1:12:25] to bind the devil but also we have the
[1:12:27] power to loose the Holy Ghost into the
[1:12:29] congregation I mean we have the power to
[1:12:31] loose him to let him have right of way
[1:12:33] so if you see you know the reason why
[1:12:37] most of us or you probably you just go
[1:12:39] back and enough Wednesdays or Sundays
[1:12:41] you realize there's a common pattern
[1:12:43] kind of happens you have trouble in the
[1:12:46] morning fusses come in right it can be
[1:12:50] very tense in the
[1:12:52] car oh oh wow okay I need to you need to
[1:12:55] teach me how what's the secret here but
[1:12:57] you see why does why does that come
[1:12:59] because the devil is afraid that when
[1:13:02] you come to church and you get into the
[1:13:05] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and God
[1:13:06] begins to move you you begin to open
[1:13:08] your heart to the Lord and you begin to
[1:13:10] express back to God what he means to you
[1:13:12] and what he's done amen that his power
[1:13:15] is broken and he's going to be defeated
[1:13:17] he may have been Waring against you all
[1:13:18] week but he's afraid there's a there's a
[1:13:21] countdown timer on his
[1:13:23] watch amen and and and it goes off at
[1:13:26] about 20 n or 10 o' depending if you're
[1:13:29] in Sunday school or not you know but he
[1:13:30] is afraid and that's why he causes
[1:13:33] trouble to come because he wants us so
[1:13:35] bound up in what's going on that we are
[1:13:38] not open and our hearts are open and we
[1:13:41] let God move that then the holy ghost is
[1:13:43] now
[1:13:45] released amen so you got to realize you
[1:13:48] have a hard morning church is going to
[1:13:50] be awesome you have a real tough
[1:13:52] Wednesday church is going to be awesome
[1:13:53] you've had a real tough week oh my wait
[1:13:56] till we get to church Hallelujah God is
[1:13:58] going to do something exceedingly
[1:13:59] abundantly Beyond I can ask or think
[1:14:01] amen so so we amen this is to me this is
[1:14:05] an incredible thing that we have the
[1:14:06] ability to bind or loose all of us do
[1:14:12] not just the whoever is preaching or the
[1:14:13] song leader all of us have this ability
[1:14:16] now back back you was 121 years ago
[1:14:21] there's a Welsh Revival this is how this
[1:14:23] now in this in this revival there was
[1:14:25] over 100,000 people saved in Wales over
[1:14:28] a few year span this is how the this is
[1:14:31] how the Revival started okay some point
[1:14:35] at the beginning of the Revival in at at
[1:14:37] new new key kagar have you said on
[1:14:40] Sunday morning in February uh 1904 it
[1:14:42] was during a prayer meeting led by a
[1:14:45] Pastor Joseph Jenkins Jenkins asked for
[1:14:46] personal testimonies some tried to speak
[1:14:49] on other
[1:14:50] issues but Jenkins redirected their
[1:14:53] focus to the Lord
[1:14:55] amen there was prolonged silence now
[1:14:59] this quickening power wants to be
[1:15:00] released right then suddenly a young
[1:15:03] girl named Flory Evans Rose to her feet
[1:15:05] and spoke softly with a trembling voice
[1:15:07] I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart
[1:15:10] amen a journalist named tww Ste who was
[1:15:12] present that day wrote this the paos and
[1:15:15] the passion of the young girl acted like
[1:15:17] an electric shock upon the congregation
[1:15:19] one after another Rose and made a full
[1:15:21] surrender and the News spread like
[1:15:23] wildfire from place to place that the
[1:15:24] rival had broken out and that Souls were
[1:15:27] be coming and gathered to the Lord what
[1:15:28] did she do she stood up under the moving
[1:15:30] of the Holy Ghost it was quickening
[1:15:32] power what you she released the Holy
[1:15:34] Ghost upon the congregation just by a
[1:15:37] little testimony it wasn't a great big
[1:15:38] thing a little timid little timid girls
[1:15:41] with a trembling voice saying I love the
[1:15:42] Lord Jesus with all my heart amen but
[1:15:45] see it's not necessarily the way it's
[1:15:47] given it's the heart that quickening
[1:15:50] power moving amen that doesn't want to
[1:15:52] be bound it wants to be released
[1:15:53] Hallelujah that's why it's so important
[1:15:55] you feel to say amen amen you want to
[1:15:58] dance start dancing amen if it's a
[1:16:00] moving of the Holy Ghost don't be afraid
[1:16:02] if God's doing it it's always in
[1:16:04] order amen but what could that do it
[1:16:07] could trigger a Revival just like this
[1:16:09] you say oh we don't have revivals no
[1:16:11] more who said
[1:16:12] that who said that brother brah says you
[1:16:15] can have a Revival you can have it in
[1:16:16] yourself if the whole church is dead as
[1:16:18] a post you can be shouting the glories
[1:16:20] of God Amen like you first met him amen
[1:16:22] the word become more alive to you
[1:16:24] doesn't matter what what's going on
[1:16:25] around you it's you and God hallelujah
[1:16:28] amen so if she could move by the see it
[1:16:30] was the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost that
[1:16:32] moved in her heart and she began to
[1:16:34] express amen exactly what that was going
[1:16:36] on and it caused Revival to happen
[1:16:40] hallelujah amen
[1:16:42] friends why should we be intimidated how
[1:16:45] polished or unpolished we are that's
[1:16:47] right see it's the devil that wants to
[1:16:48] make us afraid not to act upon what God
[1:16:51] wants us to do that's what will that
[1:16:53] person think what will that person think
[1:16:55] I said that person could see that and
[1:16:56] say I want some of that amen I remember
[1:16:59] I remember standing standing at a
[1:17:00] ministers meeting years ago up north and
[1:17:02] there was brother AR's dad was there he
[1:17:05] began to scream and shout right next to
[1:17:06] me I thought man Lord I want some of
[1:17:08] what he's got right cuz it was victory
[1:17:10] in his heart coming out amen and you may
[1:17:13] be still as a post but just just let it
[1:17:16] come out whoever God wants to do it
[1:17:17] right amen it's not how skilled or
[1:17:20] whatever sure we should be you know play
[1:17:22] skillfully in all these things but it's
[1:17:24] the dynamic of it see you can have the
[1:17:26] perfect voice the perfect instruments
[1:17:28] the perfect everything but if the
[1:17:29] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost ain't there
[1:17:32] it ain't going to do what it's meant to
[1:17:33] do it'll be entertaining at Best But if
[1:17:36] God comes into it you maybe can't well I
[1:17:37] just I can't sing like nothing right and
[1:17:41] we all know that that's fine but you see
[1:17:43] but if God inspires it see amen it can
[1:17:45] do far more than than the most skilled
[1:17:48] musicians ban in the whole world it can
[1:17:50] do far more way cuz the the Dynamics of
[1:17:53] God come into it amen and it can change
[1:17:55] the whole scene amen and that's why I
[1:17:57] think it's so important friends we sing
[1:17:59] sing with all our hearts amen praise God
[1:18:01] with all that you are amen just let him
[1:18:03] take over don't be so afraid of what oh
[1:18:06] well the well the devil in this trouble
[1:18:07] and this person and this pressure forget
[1:18:09] all about that amen we're not here Amen
[1:18:12] to to to to come down to a mechanical
[1:18:14] level where it's just going through some
[1:18:16] church order thing and all those things
[1:18:18] are fine but we're here that God would
[1:18:20] take over a service am mean that it
[1:18:21] would leave human control that our lives
[1:18:24] are no longer but it's God living
[1:18:26] Hallelujah now I say I'm preaching to
[1:18:28] the choir amen cuz this is what we
[1:18:30] thrive on isn't it amen the moving of
[1:18:32] the Lord like that
[1:18:35] hallelujah amen praise the
[1:18:38] Lord see this quickening power see
[1:18:41] brother R makes a statement Moses looked
[1:18:43] one day and seen a pillar of fire it
[1:18:45] attracted his attention this great
[1:18:47] Theologian he had run with all of his
[1:18:49] theological training his understanding
[1:18:51] by his mother of the world um of the
[1:18:53] word itself uh of how he was to deliver
[1:18:56] the children of Israel but when he tried
[1:18:58] in his way he failed and although his
[1:19:00] mother had thoroughly instructed him on
[1:19:02] what to do a and on what he would do and
[1:19:05] what God had raised him up for all this
[1:19:07] knowledge as good as it was and it is
[1:19:10] good but yet it had not been set off it
[1:19:12] was only mechanics that's why we need
[1:19:15] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need
[1:19:17] the mechanics of the word they need to
[1:19:19] come together like Jesus said you must
[1:19:20] worship the father in spirit the
[1:19:22] Dynamics and Truth the mechanics but the
[1:19:25] mechanics by itself will not do anything
[1:19:28] right the the mechanics will be
[1:19:30] perfectly fine like brother bam gives
[1:19:32] the illustration uh and it is the rising
[1:19:34] of the sun of a car it can be perfectly
[1:19:37] theoretically it's a car it'll work
[1:19:39] it'll go this fast it'll do all this but
[1:19:41] if it doesn't have the spark plug to
[1:19:43] ignite that fuel in the engine it can
[1:19:45] only just be talked about it can't be
[1:19:47] proven right you take the same car put a
[1:19:50] spark plug in and what it says it can do
[1:19:52] it will do it amen and that's the same
[1:19:54] with the word of God what you just let
[1:19:56] the spark of God and I believe there's a
[1:19:58] lot of Sparks here there's a lot of fire
[1:20:00] of the Holy Ghost living in Souls amen
[1:20:02] and now that's why you just let the let
[1:20:04] the word ignite in faith amen just take
[1:20:06] God at his word don't worry about what
[1:20:08] the devil tries to pour on it saying it
[1:20:10] can't happen if God said it amen God can
[1:20:13] do
[1:20:13] it Hallelujah so it's not the mechanics
[1:20:16] see we need mechanics but see mechanics
[1:20:19] ain't what runs the automobile it's the
[1:20:20] Dynamics that runs it the mechanics
[1:20:22] don't run the church it's the Dynamics
[1:20:24] the holy ghost that gets into the word
[1:20:27] amen not a um Seminary that teaches you
[1:20:29] all the Theology and the Greek
[1:20:31] interpretations but it's the Dynamics of
[1:20:33] the Holy Ghost in there to set that a
[1:20:35] fire and bring it to pass and to make it
[1:20:37] live just exactly what promise uh
[1:20:39] promised the word of this hour not the
[1:20:41] mechanics the Dynamics it takes
[1:20:43] mechanics and Dynamics the word and the
[1:20:45] spirit they are one that gives life
[1:20:48] that's why we need both and I believe we
[1:20:50] have both amen so so if we have both
[1:20:53] what should we be afraid of about that's
[1:20:55] right amen what should we fear if we
[1:20:57] have both the mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:20:59] amen cuz remember we are actually the
[1:21:02] mechanics am mean the believer is the
[1:21:04] mechanics like Moses was the mechanics
[1:21:06] but he needed the burning bush the
[1:21:07] Dynamics to come in and bring to pass
[1:21:09] what God Said would do now I ask the
[1:21:11] question what could stop Moses after the
[1:21:14] burning
[1:21:15] bush nothing Egypt couldn't stop him
[1:21:18] Pharaoh couldn't stop him nothing could
[1:21:20] stop him the Red Sea nothing could stop
[1:21:22] him he was Unstoppable when the
[1:21:24] mechanics and the Dynamics came together
[1:21:26] I say if a man was Unstoppable under the
[1:21:28] blood of bulls and goats walking with
[1:21:30] the mechanics and Dynamics how much
[1:21:32] small now amen the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:34] under the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:37] with the mechanics and Dynamics
[1:21:39] amen praise the Lord amen you see well
[1:21:44] it's the Dynamics that does
[1:21:46] it now
[1:21:48] shamba Shamar killed 600 men with an ox
[1:21:51] code I'll guarantee you it wasn't his
[1:21:54] ability that did it right it wasn't his
[1:21:57] human strength that caused this to
[1:21:59] happen it was the it was the quickening
[1:22:01] power of almighty God what he had to
[1:22:05] realize was he was a circumcised son of
[1:22:08] Abraham see he would come brother Braham
[1:22:11] would would uh speak about he'd say year
[1:22:14] after year those Philistines would come
[1:22:16] and take away his crop now either
[1:22:19] because 600 men came to deal with him so
[1:22:21] either he had a very big crop or the
[1:22:23] Philistines were very very afraid of him
[1:22:25] I'm going to take the very afraid of him
[1:22:27] root right because the devil knows what
[1:22:29] you're he thinks he knows What You're
[1:22:31] Made Of so he'll send a force a strength
[1:22:34] that he thinks will take you down so
[1:22:36] these Philistines because remember one
[1:22:38] soldier would have done the whole job
[1:22:40] here's here's shamgar he's got an ox go
[1:22:42] which is just really a prod thing for
[1:22:44] oxen it's not a weapon right it's
[1:22:46] nothing you know he had no Shield he had
[1:22:48] no armor so one one soldier could have
[1:22:50] done the job or two three easy why 600
[1:22:55] because the Philistines were they had a
[1:22:57] bit of an idea what this man was capable
[1:22:59] of right and the devil knows what you're
[1:23:02] capable of but every time he comes
[1:23:04] against you amen his power is never
[1:23:07] enough that's right Hallelujah like a
[1:23:10] thousand against Samson with a Jawbone
[1:23:12] it wasn't enough amen all the power of
[1:23:14] Egypt was not enough against Moses amen
[1:23:17] all the unbelief of of the world during
[1:23:20] Noah's day was not enough to stop and
[1:23:22] building the ark and getting in amen all
[1:23:24] the all the um idol worship in Elijah's
[1:23:27] day was not enough Amen to stop the fire
[1:23:30] of God falling on Mount Mount carel amen
[1:23:32] all the all the all that stuff was not
[1:23:34] enough to stop Elijah going up in a
[1:23:37] chariot ride amen and it wasn't enough
[1:23:39] to stop the mandle coming on Elisha
[1:23:42] Hallelujah that quickening power that
[1:23:44] was on the prophet made him go up in a
[1:23:46] Rapture Came Upon Elisha and we know
[1:23:48] Elijah Elisha type the prophet in the
[1:23:50] church or Christ in the church right
[1:23:52] Elijah is the prophet or it's Christ
[1:23:55] Elisha is the church right and what was
[1:23:57] the last what was the so so the
[1:23:59] quickening power a double portion of the
[1:24:01] quickening power that was upon Elijah
[1:24:03] Came Upon Elisha and he did twice the
[1:24:05] number of Miracles as Elijah did we're
[1:24:09] got to realize friends if we took
[1:24:10] because you know we here brother Brown's
[1:24:12] Ministry we're in awe of everything God
[1:24:13] did that's in one man now you take that
[1:24:16] same anointing and you spread it around
[1:24:18] the earth what if you gathered all the
[1:24:20] bride and brought them into one spot and
[1:24:23] we had a testimony service
[1:24:25] you'd say man we're back in brother
[1:24:27] braham's day and we still are but you
[1:24:29] see now that same anointing has spread
[1:24:31] itself around the earth the Holy Ghost
[1:24:32] right so all the Miracles that were done
[1:24:34] just in his ministry a double has been
[1:24:37] done amen amen you just need to hear
[1:24:40] some more testimonies Our God ain't dead
[1:24:43] Hallelujah but what was the last miracle
[1:24:45] that Elisha did now uh he had a double
[1:24:48] portion he was meant to do eight he did
[1:24:50] do eight he died after he did seven so
[1:24:53] the critics come along and say oh he
[1:24:55] said he had a double portion he was a
[1:24:56] false prophet Elijah's wrong too but you
[1:24:58] see there was a time when there was war
[1:25:00] in Israel Elisha was dead in a Seiler
[1:25:02] just a bunch of Bones there was war and
[1:25:04] they carrying a some some men were
[1:25:06] carrying a dead man and they just threw
[1:25:07] him in the Seiler just just trying to
[1:25:09] you know trying to get rid because
[1:25:11] they're running from the enemy as soon
[1:25:12] as that dead man fell on Elisha's Bones
[1:25:15] the quickening power that was residing
[1:25:17] in him amen brought him to life
[1:25:19] Hallelujah so what is the last what is
[1:25:21] the last thing this Dynamic power's
[1:25:23] going to do it's going to raise the dead
[1:25:26] hallelujah amen the the quickening power
[1:25:28] that's within you is going to raise the
[1:25:30] dead the dead in Christ are going to
[1:25:31] rise amen why because the quickening
[1:25:33] power Hallelujah Elisha was not
[1:25:36] conscious of what was going on he was
[1:25:38] dead he was up in Glory by having a
[1:25:40] dancing spell around the Throne of God I
[1:25:42] don't know but you see he wasn't even
[1:25:44] conscious of that going on that's right
[1:25:47] same thing with the quickening power on
[1:25:48] you and I it ain't us that's going to
[1:25:50] work it up that's going to cause the
[1:25:51] dead in Christ to raise it's just the
[1:25:52] life within us being experiened
[1:25:55] that's why walk on and love the Lord
[1:25:57] enjoy his goodness he is your strength
[1:26:01] hallelujah amen so Shamar I'm just going
[1:26:04] to finish with this because because I I
[1:26:05] love this it's like one verse but hey
[1:26:07] it's a good verse Hallelujah so shamba
[1:26:10] here he is now uh Harvest after harvest
[1:26:14] he' hear these boots stomping down the
[1:26:16] road and he got used to he got used to
[1:26:19] the enemy coming and taking taking away
[1:26:23] what he what he had harvested and it's
[1:26:25] much like you know so so here's shamba
[1:26:27] he's the mechanics he's a circumcised
[1:26:30] son of Abraham he believes the message
[1:26:32] for his day he's adopted son of God
[1:26:35] living in the promised land right he's
[1:26:37] the me the mechanics are perfect but
[1:26:40] he's got to realize his dynamics that go
[1:26:42] with that right he's got to realize his
[1:26:44] dynamics that go with that Covenant that
[1:26:46] God has made right so they came so so
[1:26:49] you know you it's just like us sometimes
[1:26:51] you know we go to church we get a
[1:26:53] blessing full of harest comes in and we
[1:26:55] so appreciate the wheat the bread that
[1:26:58] God's given us and we're just chewing on
[1:26:59] it as we walk out the door and you know
[1:27:01] but then somehow the enemy comes in
[1:27:03] during the week and steals our Harvest
[1:27:05] and then we come back to church again
[1:27:07] and the same thing can happen it's like
[1:27:08] a cycle right but there's got to come a
[1:27:10] time when the believer realizes the
[1:27:13] Harvest God gives it's mine amen I'm not
[1:27:16] letting the devil come with a trouble or
[1:27:18] fuss or a complex or whatever it is that
[1:27:20] causes that blessing to leave amen it's
[1:27:22] just like Shamar he heard those boots
[1:27:24] stomping you know maybe he walked out at
[1:27:27] you know he he he had received this
[1:27:29] Great Harvest and and then here's the
[1:27:31] boots come he comes mondayitis comes his
[1:27:33] way 600 worth of it right and then but
[1:27:37] something within him he saw the plight
[1:27:38] of his family he saw the situation he
[1:27:41] was in and this time it was different CU
[1:27:43] instead of letting the boots make him
[1:27:45] feel more discouraged and more and more
[1:27:48] full of fear and worry the quickening
[1:27:50] power of God came upon his life and say
[1:27:54] in Hebrews 11 that out of weakness we're
[1:27:56] made strong I mean so so Shamar was in a
[1:27:59] situation of weakness but it was time
[1:28:01] for the strength of God to come into his
[1:28:03] life for the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:05] to come into his life so am me so
[1:28:07] something happened within him that he
[1:28:08] realized I am the
[1:28:10] mechanics I am the mechanics amen and
[1:28:13] the Holy Ghost is the Dynamics amen and
[1:28:15] he realized being a son of Abraham
[1:28:18] circumcised believer that was all that
[1:28:20] he needed am me so he grabbed the first
[1:28:22] thing he could grab what was it had your
[1:28:24] Ox go not even a weapon jumps out of his
[1:28:27] window charges into those Philistines
[1:28:29] now thinking man this guy's a joke
[1:28:32] obviously this is just a suicide charge
[1:28:34] and it's all over not the shamba why cuz
[1:28:37] the Dynamics had met the mechanics amen
[1:28:39] and then every single one of those
[1:28:41] Philistines were were were downed amen
[1:28:44] hallelujah and he kept his Blessing now
[1:28:46] you got to realize that you know an Oxo
[1:28:48] doesn't look like
[1:28:50] much right you saw a man with a stick
[1:28:52] charging after you your stick B you
[1:28:54] think now well this is going to be real
[1:28:56] quick and then you be thinking where am
[1:28:57] I going to eat my Harvest next year cuz
[1:28:59] he's going to be
[1:29:00] dead but the Dynamics came into it and
[1:29:03] every single one of those Philistines
[1:29:05] were dead now you take you take even you
[1:29:07] know you got to you got to really go
[1:29:08] with what's in your heart the scripture
[1:29:11] that God has quickened in your heart you
[1:29:12] got to realize that's a weapon of mass
[1:29:14] mass destruction amen that will down
[1:29:17] every devil that's come to try and steal
[1:29:18] your joy and blessing I mean you even
[1:29:21] look at you even look at you know the
[1:29:22] shortest the shortest verse in the Bible
[1:29:25] Jesus
[1:29:27] wept that don't look like much of a
[1:29:29] weapon but when the Dynamics of the Holy
[1:29:32] Ghost comes into that scripture amen it
[1:29:35] will change your life and kill every
[1:29:37] enemy that tries to rob you I mean you
[1:29:39] take even like a depression devil or a
[1:29:41] loneliness devil those those two words
[1:29:44] Quicken to you by the Dynamics am me
[1:29:46] will give you a strengthen the trial why
[1:29:49] because Jesus when he stood there and he
[1:29:50] wept he had feeling for his friends he
[1:29:53] was s s humanly that that Lazarus was
[1:29:56] dead he was feeling the sadness of Mary
[1:29:58] and Martha he wasn't indifferent amen so
[1:30:01] kills the devil saying God is
[1:30:03] indifferent to what you're going through
[1:30:05] notice Jesus when he came to lazarus's
[1:30:07] grave he knew already Lazarus was going
[1:30:08] to come forth he did not tell he did not
[1:30:11] tell Mary Martha be quiet woman the
[1:30:14] resurrection's going to happen just
[1:30:15] harden up just take it no he felt their
[1:30:17] infir so he wept he's a God that cares
[1:30:20] and when when you realize God cares for
[1:30:22] you amen it'll give you a
[1:30:25] strength amen it'll give you a real
[1:30:27] strength
[1:30:29] hallelujah amen you know you know the
[1:30:32] biggest criticism brother Braham had in
[1:30:34] his ministry from someone he he relates
[1:30:36] it all the time he says you know this
[1:30:38] woman comes to and says look you're
[1:30:39] bragging too much on Jesus he was just a
[1:30:42] man this woman say he said no he was
[1:30:44] divine and she says look I'll prove to
[1:30:46] you from your own Bible that Jesus was
[1:30:48] just a man and she would read Jesus wept
[1:30:50] at lazarus's grave and she would say how
[1:30:52] could the Divine weep
[1:30:54] see as the Devil comes along says God is
[1:30:56] some distant distant thing that doesn't
[1:30:58] care about you amen but he says look he
[1:31:01] was the god man he was a man there
[1:31:03] weeping CU he had the feeling for his
[1:31:05] friends he was sad Lazarus was dead he
[1:31:07] was sad his friends had suffered this
[1:31:08] loss but friends if we could just
[1:31:10] realize God God carries our burdens and
[1:31:13] our troubles and our hurts and he
[1:31:16] understands he weeps with you when
[1:31:17] you're going through hard times but
[1:31:19] that's not the end that's that's not the
[1:31:21] End Amen Lazarus was called forth he he
[1:31:24] was a man when he wept amen but he was
[1:31:25] the god you he was a God man he was the
[1:31:27] man part weeping but it was God that
[1:31:29] said Lazarus come forth and we know that
[1:31:31] if he just said come forth there would
[1:31:32] have been a general Resurrection
[1:31:34] Hallelujah so what you can take that
[1:31:36] Jesus wept and you can kill a depression
[1:31:38] devil you can kill that devil that tells
[1:31:40] you God don't care you can kill the
[1:31:41] devil it says you feel lonely and you
[1:31:42] should be you know no one understands
[1:31:44] Jesus
[1:31:46] understands
[1:31:48] Hallelujah so what's in your
[1:31:50] hand what's in your hand today I'm just
[1:31:52] going to close with this let let's have
[1:31:55] the musicians but what's in your hand
[1:31:58] what scripture is in your heart God will
