[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good evening everyone welcome to the house of God this evening we have a bass player tonight or are we down a bass player I suspected as much [Laughter] usually when they want to play they come up here rather than sit down there I didn't know I was doing music tonight that's not EADS fault that's my fault I was totally my fault I'm kind of you know when you have a holiday for a couple of weeks you kind of do find that you you sort of slow to get back into the daily grind of life I was a bit more enthusiastic about the whole thing when I was younger but now that I'm getting a wee bit older it's kind of becoming average you know work that the curse of work it's just a soul part of son you know that this world is run by selfishness and and greed and everything so as a result you've got to keep on working and because if you stop everything gets taken away from you because people other people take it that's just part of the curse that we live under I'll be glad when it's all over when when we can enter into that rest because that's what we were designed to do is actually just be in the presence of God and be at peace and there's being harmony and just have a good time that's actually what the human was supposed to do that's the way Adam was made he didn't have to do much everything worked for him but I'll be glad when we get to that place but praise the Lord I came in my sort of that side of the pulpit attire too but you know thinking um when Jesus was around the Bible says the common man sort of heard him badly no they they they kind of liked and I I think for most of the time it was probably dressed like a common man but look one thing we want as we want the Lord to meet with us tonight and we're under expectation to hear from God and to just receive a blessing it's nice to see all the different folk here there's just really entering put our minds off of whatever we've been going through we'll work everything else and really focus on God and make the most of this opportunity that we have that we've met with me met together - to worship God and to receive what he has for us and we want to welcome brother Robert Wilson here tonight and let's just give him Liberty and just let the Lord move it's not let's not let anything get in the way that wastes time you know let us enter and straightaway receive it and and just be blessed tonight so let's just um come at the service of the world we'll stand up and we'll pray and then we'll send some praise songs heavenly father we're so grateful Lord that we can be gathered in your house this place Lord that we've set aside to worship You Lord and we want to invite you into our midst this evening Lord may you come in and speak to us in a special way tonight may each heart be attentive to the things of You Lord may we be sensitive to your spirit and set our minds on things above floor so much time of the day we have to just do these daily things Lord but it's just so nice to be here this evening and to really focus all of our attention on you Lord in to lay hold upon eternal life this evening so we Lord will run a great expectation that you would meet with us Lord we know that we Lord we're just mortal men and woman we we as we get on we realize that we don't have much to offer Lord but when we just let you move in our life and when we let you take control of our life Lord that's when things change and that's when things happen Lord so that's our desire this evening Lord is that you would take over Lord in it and that we would just lay at your feet sit at your feet this evening and learn from you Lord and let you let you have the full control of the service and that your perfect world will be done this evening so we just pray in Jesus name Amen I mean least that was number 107 though I first it in a barren land of sin and shame and nothing satisfying there I found but to the Blessed cross of Christ one day I came with Springs of a living water that abounds amen Arthur stood in a barren land of sin and shame and nothing says my hair I found but firmly the price one day we're Springs of living water it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen praise the Lord can't hear me that's there's nothing wrong

ourselves we acknowledge it's you that I've assembled us here tonight before the foundation of the world was laid new here we knew the songs we will sing he knew the conditions of our hearts you knew everything and planning and maybe come to pass tonight we are fulfilling prophecy because you said whatever two or three are gathered out with alienness Lord know that we expect you we know you are here confirm yourself testify of your gifts testify for your presence and let us not leave you the same way we came in let us leave you better than we came in let us leave our barriers at aviary tonight and I pray O God give us a little bit of understanding a little bit more faith to claim the promises you prefer for us a little more of you O God that will make a difference cast away a little bit more of the evil spirit that beset us and O God this journey we are determined that you are leading us come and lead us O God we thank you lord thank you for your message today bringing us close and together Oh God we want to hear from you not from man I just commit myself to you hide me behind this little wooden desk and let it be you speaking to your children and not only waits but let your word come alive come alive in us so we can express you in the name of Jesus we pray amen thank you all check one another and say god bless you I'd rather thanks god bless you that's all the music we're going to have Wednesday night weekday service sometimes you can't keep too long so I'm going to do my best appreciate the musicians so if you have your Bibles so trying to find the mind of Christ for tonight I don't have to be here I was telling your pastor I didn't plan to even come to New Zealand let alone to Wellington my daughter got me into it she wanted to come to New Zealand so bad one year doubt she heard I was going to Melbourne so I told her that George Smith and better Tony admin well I might go to New Zealand who can I contact there and then on and on and on and I'm hopping through all that so I've been to Milwaukee is that what you call it been to Auckland and I was seeing Stratfor last night so tonight I'm passing through here but let it not be me passing through here that would be Jesus passing through so I want to give bring greetings for my family in Chicago we have a little assembly there and do the work of a pasta because my heart is really in the mission fields I spent more time in Africa especially the Muslim world when Morocco and me J and Mari last year and we are planning to go to China and other places so I just desired to somehow do something that will bring in the last we enjoying life you are little boy or girl going to school you want to get there get married have a big house but a world is so much in chaos that if even we live longer we don't know what state of mind we will be and so our prayer should be that Lord come quick so tonight let it be Christ speaking to you tonight I want us to go to the scripture and turn with me to 1 there's a a verse that we're going to read in the book just after Timothy is called fire lemon fire lemon or Philemon how do you pronounce that Philemon okay so you go to Timothy you go to Titus then you go to Philemon it's just a joy to be here for you I wish there's a couple more nights because when you miss somebody for the first time we sized each other anything I say it could go you think about it wrongly so I'm going to sustain the Scriptures myself I can because we don't know each other and there's too many evil spirits flying around preaching about that suppose idol preaching the gospel so we just want to stay in the way as close as we can so if you have fire lemon fire lemon I'm just going to read verse 1 and this that's 1 and 9 and take a lot of thought so verse 1 says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother on to Philemon of Philemon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and if you jump to verse 9 yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee be such an one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ so I want to take a little thought in a message once more Lord the RAM said you are going to be somebody's prisoner you don't belong to yourself you are somebody's prisoner you are either a prisoner of the devil knowing this truth and won't surrender to it or a prisoner to God as you surrender to the way you are either the devil's prisoner to sin or you are God's prisoner to righteousness you are one or the other so tonight I want to take a thought as God expresses through my heart whose prison are you are you really God's prisoner then you have to be really surrender to this truth if you are not surrender to it there's no middle ground you know some things you want a great area we call it there's no gray area in walk to God you are either the prisoner of God or prisoner of the devil and many times in our mind we convince ourselves who we are but our works and the things that we believe display is what we really are so tonight I want to challenge you as we go to the Bible and the message if you don't find yourself a total prisoner you don't find yourself a prisoner of God in your heart pray and cry to God Lord I want to be your prisoner Lord I want to be your prisoner Lord I want to be your prisoner let's pray again Lord Jesus tonight that's our desire show us in a mirror how and where and where we lack and let your spirit not only convict us but bring us to your presence that you will perform your work in our lives in Jesus name we pray amen please be seated as I said I have only one service so if it doesn't go well I probably don't have to come back again I'll just stick to Australia but we are not here to get a name there's no greater name like Jesus Christ the name of William Brown is there but Jesus Christ is above all and so we have to always look at it so this subject of being a prisoner is really difficult because many times we go to church regularly so we can call ourselves a prisoner many times we do many things that we don't understand but it looks like we're doing the right thing but when we talk about a prison I don't think anybody has been in jail yet we are all too young to get into jail oh you've been in jail before oh no jail is not a right place to be if you read the books and the stories of people who end up in jail you don't have the chance to eat your fish and chips so what you want is what the jailor will give you and they open a little hole and throw a cup of water in there for you and you got to live with it your toilet facilities is just by your bed if you are good enough in Chains you are taken to a room to do your thing when they release you for about an hour every day you feel controlled you feel locked up you feel that you don't have your own liberty so for power to coin self Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ there is something that Paul is talking about that maybe we haven't come to because working with God is a different matter it's not your thoughts of following your parents or following a message but it's a work that comes with a price that works means you get to a point where you don't do anything except what God wants you to do that's what means to become a prisoner Paul had an ambition she was a trained lawyer he was very religious he had all his stuff together till when there was a time that people were claiming there was a man called Jesus Christ he had disciples on the Sabbath day they were cutting food and doing everything to disobey the commandments that Moses laid down Paul being a strict Jew a Pharisee looked at it and said you people are desecrating the Word of God so you took on himself to persecute the Christians because he was committed to something many times we are not committed to anything we just follow blindly but on the way to Damascus on the way to bring get all the stuff to persecute them he met Christ and that changed him completely changed his ambition changed everything that Paul ever thought he was going to do because there is a meeting God will meet you because that's what will bring a change many times the chain hasn't happened and will claim and put a microphone on it and claim so many things God brings a change if this message that you claim you believe hasn't brought a change you haven't got it you can claim it as much as you want your claim doesn't count it's what God testifies that counts and so you have Paul now all of a sudden he was changed so much that the disciples were even afraid of him he was they were afraid of him but Paul got to a point where prophecy didn't move him if somebody prophesied to date tomorrow you're going to have an accident so don't go to Christ Church or something we induce a wonderful God has confirmed what I didn't want to do anyway so I'm not going but one great Prophet Agabus one day he walked there and took pause garments and say whoever has this there's a big persecution coming don't go to Jerusalem now poorer by condition knew God was sending today so it's not prophecy that makes us do what God wants us to do it's not a quote that you have to see before you realize God said prophet said I shouldn't cut my hair it's not a prophecy but something in you will confirm to you what you need to do those codes and prophecies may come and confirm it but even when they come and they don't confirm the way he said praise God for that confirmation but why why not die for him so poor disobeyed everybody and went to Jerusalem and if you read all the commentaries they said haw ruin his ministry by disobeying that prophecy but he took a profit in this age to come and said you know Paul was in jail in ships locked up he couldn't preach for all those two and a half years but why he was there he was thinking about the Corinthians that is preached so he wrote a letter to them he was thinking about the Galatians all foolish Galatians wrote a letter to them he was thinking about Titus he was thinking about Philemon if Paul did not go to Jerusalem we want to have the New Testament but Paul didn't even know what was happening to him but he was writing all these letters that we can go back so we can know how to have communion so we can know how to have bishops so we can know all these things so our life I still haven't got my subject our life is predetermined amen I'm not sure whether this country is a cricket country or soccer country or football but I have lived in I'm originally from Africa Ghana so soccer is important but have you ever watched a recorded play or recorded game before it's pre-recorded and you don't know this course and you know why you are watching prerecorded game maybe between Australia and New Zealand you are all charged up sometimes you forget is prerecorded goal and you throw your hand well it's already done you can't change it I want to tell you tonight the Prophet said your life was pre-planned before the foundation of the world was laid the devil can change your life even God can change your life because then God is changing his thoughts about you he can do it he laid it all before the foundation of the world and saw you walking in it even today till tonight he knew what clothes you away you didn't need a pastor to tell you you know wear a red skirt or a shed or something but the Spirit of God is in you something trances you I'm going to change this is not for change this is for change this is how long I want to look to present myself and on and on and on and then you come in and then you know he knows exactly where you are going to sit and you sit there tonight your life is all pre-recorded many times we make a mistake thinking I'm going to change it no you can't change it and so the predestinated of God are predestinated to walk in his counsel and his way and that's all that we do so every day your life is to come to a point say Lord where do I go from here because don't you see the Bible says the steps of the righteous are honored your steps are ordered so tonight God has ordered our steps to get together so being a prisoner means you've gotten to a point where you wait for God to tell you what to do you move when God makes you move and pour how to get to that point in his life that all the disciples in my ear Peter say Peter prisoner of Jesus Christ he never said John or might you say a prisoner of Jesus Christ but I haven't after having a real revelation Paul saw that his life was not his his life was Christ's life that he is living a portion of Christ's life that he said for him to live and so he looked at himself and said Paul a prisoner it's not what you say that will change what I have to do for God is what God will enable me to do that's what makes the difference so to be a prisoner for Christ has a very strong meaning and Paul admonishes us when you get a chance there's two tips I'd like you to listen to one is called oneness another one is called Paul a prisoner so we're going to try to the next 30 45 minutes try to focus on it a little bit because unless you become a prisoner of Christ you can't live this message you can't live for Christ after a while school job marriage money something is going to come in the way some of us are old enough you know I dye my hair a little bit that's why I don't see the gray hair but we've been in a message saying 72 and we've seen the impact and we've seen how people have also gone back and forth so when I see a young group like that I'm so excited there's a next generation for this message part of my heart I won't go to today part of my heart I want him to come quickly because I feel every generation has something to fulfill we have done our part and you are going to carry the next part but Paul brings us to the top topic of being a prisoner and I want to so I'll be bringing in quotes here and there yes so that we can build on it the first one I want to talk about before we go deeper it says we are all born a free moral agent any decision that we wish to God has given us to make it and because every man is on the same based like Adam and Eve we have to make our decisions so let's learn one first principle God would never make a decision for you you might say mom dad make a decision for me choose my school choose my husband choose this god never does if he does it then he has to wake up Adam and Eve and ask for forgiveness he created Adam and Eve put them on on the same level as you and I gave them a choice Adam had a choice Eve had a choice you have a choice I have a choice and God will never make the choice for us but you always presented to us and give us the tools to make the right choice but when you get there whether you make a choice on the business of God's Word or you make a choice because there was something flashy because you are afraid that's where we face a lot of consequences so first remember God will always bring you to a point that you have to make a choice a choice of who you want to be a choice of who you want to marry a choice of school parents will influence you a little bit but there are many times you get to a point it's like driving you make a choice to turn left or right you make a choice to right drive through a yellow light you make a choice and as human beings often when we make a choice and it doesn't work we like to find somebody to blame in my in my growing up the lady in the village caused all the troubles in this message you saw the pasta oh it's all a tape or a quote I didn't find but the choice is yours and this afternoon I read a quote to your past and I want to read it as we get started give me a second because with that it helps us to come to see that our choice our choice is really not our choices go just give me a second I'm just getting this on so in this message faith Moses I'm going to read a portion 58 or 720 I want you to listen carefully he says there is a choosing and we choose for ourselves we choose something for our own good but Moses chose their afflictions and disgrace that he might walk with the people of God think of it now listen choose the afflictions of the people of God and counted it greater treasure for he and yet seeing him who was invisible so a lot one time had to make a choice we all remember the story of Lord and it may be this morning that there will be men and women sitting here that will make your final choice so now listen carefully you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you will be five years from today should I read it again what you choose now will determine what will be five years from today five years from today you may be a missionary five years from today you may be a renowned Christian or five years from today you may be in hell because you made a wrong decision five years from today he may be cleaning splittings in a ballroom five years from today you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man or woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice of Christ five years from today you may be in glory and now he says you are what you are today because of a choice you made five years ago so when I read something like this I want to make a note of my choices there's few that you can and work on it and put it on a wall and see yourself five years from today so five years from today the choices we made comes into existence in our life fast forward so many things that come to us sometimes we don't know where it came from it's all based on the choices you can choose to serve Christ or choose not to serve Christ choose to go to school or not choose to go to school so God has given us that freedom it's yours the moment you bound a human being you have that choice children have that choice when they are young adults we can guide you but you get to a point where you're going to choose a husband and wife a job and all that and choose to follow Christ there are things that affect us so to be a prisoner means you've got to a point where your choice is what God's where it says you must do it's a tough one it's a tough one would you say that God's Word says I must go to church I'll go to church every day there'll be times you hit church he don't like the music you don't like the preacher the church is too far your car is broken down it's costing you too much cars and too much effort I would rather be somewhere so to be a prisoner means you got to a point where you surrender your choice you turn it all upside down and said what does God say about it and sometimes you stick only to the Bible you might end up with an interpretation for the denominations or somebody so you said what does the Bible say about it in light of the message of today because you are prisoner being a prisoner means you've gotten to a point where it's not what your pastor says it's not what you find a code but something in you drives you to do what you are doing and people will turn around and say oh I have the Holy Ghost I have news for you the Holy Ghost if it doesn't lead you to live this life I don't care how much you speak in tongues I don't matter how how much you see prophecies I don't know I don't care whatever you can lay on because it's a life it's God spirit in you producing God through you and if you don't live that life don't cram it just say Lord I'm not there yet I want to be there help me help me help me and so here by ramming the same message a prisoner says always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform miracles and we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have in the way but always judge yourself look back take inventory and see what kind of fruit you are bearing I can stop right here I hope I like you more amen you already you already could give me out tonight yes I'm amen amen you know seven God is the easiest yet is the most challenging if you don't get to a point where God has to do it you are not there yet like Jesus always said is God doing it through me and it's astroturf I'll tell you I've been in a message seven you know since 72 there are times I thought God was doing it then I find out I was doing at times I thought God was doing it but then I look at myself oh this is difficult how could I do it and then I do it I come back and I said how did I do it it was good is sometimes easier sometimes you see after the fact whether you did it or God did it because the Prophet also said God always testify he always backs his way so if God is doing it you stand by it so Paul after working with God for all this time prophecies didn't movie quotes didn't move him because he had got into a stage where he knew you can prophesy Paul you are going to die tomorrow praise God death where is your sting you can prophesy a poor don't go to Jerusalem well the same God that came to me that I should go to Jerusalem it doesn't mean your prophecy is false of course God is probably one in me but we sometimes get to a point where we are so paranoid till we want God to say something to confirm what we are doing so we don't do it we want a quote to confirm what we want to do so we can say I found a quote and when we find a cord that we don't really like it then we say but around may be said it from himself didn't know this edge and the stage will be in and all the excuses we can give I tell you tonight you are not doing it when you get there you'll be doing something that you find a quote he says I wonder why I was doing this now here is a quote that confirms what I'm hearing so tonight I want you to bring you a little bit closer no to butter brown bar to Jesus Christ because Jesus is what is going to make a difference in our life he's the one that is going to make a difference in your home a difference in this church and the more you bring him in the more you will see him so being a priest we'll look at some little implications and then take a little bit of examples Paul had an ambition but he got to a point where Paul and his ambition where all we're all completely surrendered to God Paul got to a point where he looked at himself with all the education his mind every day is what can I do for God next to get to that mentality it's like not you are not living in this world you get up in the morning I'm going to work yes I have to be at work to pay my bills but Lord what can I do today how can I walk in your world today how can you I be a blessing today when you get to that point where your everything your mind is on that then you know you are making progress it's not when you do something you come about all Lord I should have done it God will forgive you but we have to come to a point where this is what we must do and this is what we do let me take a few examples because examples always establishes that thought how many have read the story of Samson he read a story you remember Samson Judges chapter 15 and 16 you can mark it down Samson was raised I said Nazareth God raised him because Israel was in trouble and God wanted to use something to bring deliverance and we learned that a prophet said he was a little man he wasn't probably as big as me and it was such a miraculous power that will come on Samson that he can take the job all born upon us and kill thousands it was Joe it was he was so powerful when the Spirit of God comes to him and we want to get to that point but there was something a little something has never done he had not certain that he's had to go so God can use you God can use you to bring even people save people and you still have me surrender to Christ so Sampson was such a great man everybody was afraid of him but he got to a point because his head was not surrendered he kept doing the wrong thing he kept everything that something thought about was vile in his heart he started going after woman we all know the Bible you would think with all that power of God she represented him he had a choice the choice was to give his heart completely to God he didn't do it he kept on and on and on he found beautiful lady Delilah that's all that I want that's fine the Spirit of God was still day you tell Delilah I let him tie my hands with a rope they will come and the power of God will fall again and it was still living in sin that moyson was there that anointing can still be in the message on the coat and we can still live in sin no Holy Ghost and that was the life of Samson it went on and on and on and on until the very thing that God raised Samson to help the people overcome overcame Samson yeah till one day he told a story I was born in Nazareth you know since a child no Caesar has got my head Delilah felt now he's told me the truth he took razor shared his hair Samson the Philistines are upon you there was no power and you might think how does the hair connect with that you see we live we live in different dimensions there are a lot of things in this dimension that connects with our other life and so when your path is written I said women don't cut your hair he's gonna against you because if you read a word of god the head is a woman's glory why would you desecrate your glory now will you take a scissor and trim it just leave it I know it's fashionable to look like the other friend or some movie star but you are not a movie star you have another word Val so something toward another Shelby said now when the Philistines were upon something the Power had disappeared how will it come back so I keep saying this that the devil is not smart because they were looking for what is trendlines Nadi founded don't you think they should have bought all the reasons in the world and every morning shave something two or three times a day after every shower shave something shave something chef Sampson don't make sure there's not even one hair coming on his head because they found the solution to Samson's friend and that's why the devil does he's always looking for a solution to attack your life maybe your prayer life the friends you you keep the whatsapp messages and YouTube and all those things they affect your faith now we'll do it and the devil is trying more lifeline to awesome eventually he gets us in a corner he locks herself so if you don't get it what's up message in one day you are nervous why am I not getting anything he's got you are dicta to it you are like something in jail I was what's up when you were born I was a phone call or YouTube or Facebook because the devil oh I didn't read it he says God likes to make prisoners of people he wants to use and the devil also likes to do the same the our methods are different God wants to make you a prisoner by your choice the devil want to force you into request you and put a stamp on you so you can't get out so here was something that's so powerful man of God that everybody was afraid of now Samson and when the devil gets you he's going to remove your eyes he's going to take away your understanding he's going to blunt you so they took Samson's eyes am i reading the Bible and the man that has all the power now that power is being used to grind some milling meal or some corn or something because the devil is doing the same to us the power of the message the power of that shed the power of God now we just get it so distorted and that's because we are not prisoners yet so something became a laughingstock sometimes I think when people laugh at us we are exhibiting not a gospel but a hybrid life that we will see we are fake you you claim you a basic believer you on Facebook like me so what's the difference you are what's up like me it's just going to church that's what is the difference but there has to be a difference which is the life of God through us so now something when the devil get you Samson's eyes were gone but watch was there the Prophet said every day Lord forgive me I failed he was grinding the stuff Lord forgive me I failed I failed and slowly as he was I don't know how many years or weeks or something he was free confessing his fault and his hair was growing end of it there was a party and they thought oh today we are going to showcase we're going to demonstrate something so they brought something but they didn't know something has been confessing his self they didn't know Sampson has repented they didn't know Sampson now has become a prisoner so they brought Samson out they thought they were going to have a display and Samson whispers to that little boy and said show me put my one hand to a pillar and the other one to the other pillar I want to feel it so they always looked at something and he has something if you read I believe judges 16:30 or something he said Lord let me die with my enemy the professor that's the time he reached total prisoner he got to a point where I want to just affect my enemy so much that if it costs my life let it be we have to get to a point where our life doesn't matter to us anymore only the life of Christ that matters Samson said let me die with my enemies so imagine a little man there's one till I hear one today is going to be the greatest performance better man because he's free because the committed himself to Christ and he could stretch one hand from here to the other hand I don't know how he did it but I believe the power of God and then he brought the whole Bil'in down the Bible says more people died on that day than he's ever done why was that the Prophet said God cannot use you until you become his prisoner he can't do it you might feel a goose bump you might have a pillar of fire you might do something but God wants to tap business that you can use he want to use you at home he want to use you at work you want to use you at school you have to be that point it's more than what you are doing today now something god never will fail God gives us the gifts but we can only come to their full maturity of that gift until we become full prisoners so on that day if you remember Samson's prayer maybe you don't believe it but I'll read it for you yeahjust is chapter 16 and Sampson West when she and Samson caught on to the Lord and said O Lord God remember me I pray thee strengthen me I pray thee only this one so God that I meet my baby once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes fester 29 and Sampson took hold on the pillars on which the house stood on which it was born up one in his right hand and the other on his left hand was steady and Samson said let me die what I've reached a point where life doesn't mean much to me my life not my will but your work not my life but your life we don't have any life to live except the life of Christ and Sampson got to that point where steady and Sampson said let me die with the Philistines the Bible says and he bowed himself with all his might in the house fell upon the lords and I when all the people that were there so that dad which is true at his death we're more than they which he slew in his life we of course knows the message we of course go to change we of course pray we do everything but God is waiting yeah total surrender a tutor prisoner that it doesn't take somebody to get us to do God's work the church door doesn't have to be reminded something is driving you there this is Samson's life I wouldn't understand it but he took a prophet to look at Samson's life and said nothing could happen to Samson slime that was a credit until he gave himself to Christ and so you can see the same thing there's no power in the church because there's no commitment you come to church when you are able to when your favorite preacher is coming to preach or your favorite song leader is coming to leave songs or something whatever reason that that will give you but until you have a committed people in a church you can't even see the full power of God and and this message we are dying for Christ to come alive again we are dying to see the power of God again we are sit down to see the pillar of fire again let's get to that point where we have Christ in our mission because something in us tells us we are hungry I know it's easy to point to the Prophet how people were healed let me tell you the good news the same power is still here to do the same purify is still here he's waiting for a to attack commitment the Prophet made me sick but he had to get to a point where he was committed so when he pray and he stands there the pillar of fire will come wonderful that's the prophet today is the bride we are not draw much we are the Bride of Christ I'm hungry for Christ so much and when I go and I see his people he said whatever two or three I gathered every day I am expecting him I'm expecting him oh I can take so many other people I could take Moses let's take a few minutes on Moses you remember Moses he was born a proper child a bright cold trained he knew who he was he was a deliverer so much power that Moses could go and you know go to Pharaoh he seems to Egyptians fight him you can kill one and then he got to a point where they were after Moses when you have totally given yourself to Christ you can never be a cow because the Lord fights your battles so now Moses run into the hills and now he's a shepherd and everyday he'll be heading the ship you look up there he sees the light fire burning big fire and the bush is not bad he kept doing that for one year two years three years 14 years till one day he said okay I'm gonna see what it is so he went there see why do I'm not completely surrendered to God you even brought on holy ground and don't know it you don't even know one crashes amongst you so he goes there and he says Moses move your shoes he looks around who is speaking to me well I'll get my shoes anyhow and see what is next now God had to talk to him so Moses that finally he says they won't believe me said I'll give you three signs throw your stick on there he did tennis snake said hold it by the bat by the tail and he did 10 and Moses now had all the signs wonderful and finally said Lord do you think God he makes mistakes I think don't you think so how could you select somebody who is of a slow speech III grew I went to school with people who has Tamara slow speech that's what if the Prophet said it means so when they want to say something it takes more energy than the way that will come out so you can take Moses goes to the Jews and he has to tell Pharaoh let my people go took him probably five minutes to let those three words come out Moose's what are you saying let okay so let what my mama and that is God's prophet but before he went he told God God I miss Tamra how could I do it God said who made your mouth see God knows how to do it if God took a preacher like me I'll be preaching to Pharaoh I'll have a long sermon three hours because I know the power of God but God knew who he wanted so he was saying exactly and everybody was looking God and his choices that's why God chose you they didn't choose you because you are better looking than somebody he chooses you with infirmities that will confirm that he is God because he only gets all the glory you didn't get part of it he gets all the glory so people look at Moses but Moses could not go because at that time 40 years ago he wasn't surrounded but a professor when he came to that point that he was a prisoner 9 he went there with a staff in his hand I hope this man knows what he's doing he knew it he had more than that says the Lord he spoke to God live to hear God can speak to him directly mostly say this and Moses is struggling to say it and man is wondering what is he trying to say and when he became a prisoner the Prophet said he caught so much all his courage or his friend all his energy was all gone - anytime there is any confrontation who say God now these people are laughing at me what should I do these people are crying they need help what should I do they need water why should I do and Moses kept doing that today even God has to tell him why cry speak he sometimes became so delinquent because he just wants to hear that voice and we had a voice of God and we are fed up oh my goodness they got you now yes to his voice Moses were so tuned I haven't got a head God's voice today I don't know what I'm doing he was so tuned that's being a prisoner I won't go to speak to me today he will but Moses he it was formed by the Prophet people for my life you know what I'm waiting for he with an angel of God told him you are limiting even your ministry to miracles pretty soon they won't believe you until they see a miracle because when you see you are totally CERN and you see the power of God you got to a point where you don't want it to even an inch be yourself you want it just to be in Moses for forty years God has to get all the self out of him before he could use him God has to get you out of yourself so he can use you you know we live the way even we are I picked the salmon I'll just be quick on that on God's gifts that I wrapped see God gives us gifts but the same God that gives us gifts like to wrap it for us and many times we'll get stuck in the wrapping the greatest gift the world had Jesus Christ was wrapped in a human being that was God wrapped in a human being and sometimes we are home mother-father God's gift wrapped in a human being sometimes we get on each other others they have so much because we are looking at a rapid [Applause] you got to look beyond the wrapping God will always wrap his gift in the words wrapping that you can ever get and if you are into Christmas gifts Christmas time you look at a wrapping I don't know I don't want to open it and then you open it and it's a surprise that gives in this church but God has wrapped it so we got to look beyond that our kids look beyond that look beyond the irritation because God will always wrap it in a human being I wish you wrap it in an angel that has no fault he would sneeze at the wrong time you get on your knife the way he eats the way he smacks the way he does everything tells you off but he's a gift of God you reject it you reject her God I said that for the pasta you might like not like him he's a little bit boisterous young boy I know that that's God's gift and new husband's and your wives those gifts and many times I have to remind myself oh that my wife Helen is God's gift oh he's got kids Scott gifts men to do something for me aha let me hold my thought I have a couple more minutes why do you become a prisoner you recognize God because he's always going to do something that you see and say this is beyond man's thinking so now if you give gifts wrap it in there the west place that you can God started wrapping gifts before mine everybody started thinking about it and so you look at the human being and you let it drive you away that's the same gift that you are rejected that's why Jesus - that says if you believe in me believe also in me in him the angel told by wrong if you can get them to believe in you nothing can stand against your prayer it was on him and so people have to go beyond the wrapping of William Brown and we can't go beyond it because we are being Conner but when we go beyond the wrapping of William Brown we can see Christ expressing it if we go beyond that we can see Christ expressing your children crisis pressing your husband crisis pressing your church then we are coming to a point where we are completely serene keeping our eyes on Christ oh I wanted to talk about Abraham but I will make it quick I wanted to talk about the prodigal son you know the story he started praying for his parent and father to die so he can inherit it quickly and when it's not happening he said that just give me my portion I just know what I'm going to do I'm a better investor than you see God has given us so much knowledge in this age that through the message we can go back and see what was wrong in their life to help us be better than them prodigal son and finally excuse me one day he woke up and said I'm going to my father's house his father was able to receive him we look at Luke chapter 8 it's a story that is read I've read many times I'm going to use that to just try to change everything God always has to take a man that will serve Him truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything he is everything in his life so body everything else to become a complete prisoner that's the only time God can use him so I'm learning everyday that lord if I may yet life and I don't become your prisoner you can't use so it doesn't matter what I've prepared what I've done I have to try and enter in and get to a point where because God knows what you need I don't know it and if I say anything for myself it will bear no fruit but if God says it I tell you from tonight you start making decisions that five years from now you will see the results because God is raisin a CD seed will never perish so if you have with me Luke chapter 8 I want to go quickly because time is not with us we did I'm glad nobody has fallen asleep but Luke chapter 8 I said right so if you've thought with me from verse 22 I'm going to be quick now he came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go onto the other side of the lake and a lunch for but as I they said he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and we're in jeopardy and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and repeat the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and it was calm last 25 and he said unto them where is your faith and they be being afraid one that saying one - another what manner of man is this for the command before for he commanded even the winds and the water to obey Him now best 26 and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against Galilee and when he went forward to the land there met him a man him out of the city a certain man which are devils long time and wine no clothes neither aboard in any house but in tombs and when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of God Most High I beseech thee torment me not for he had commanded that unclean spirit to come out of the man for off times in our cotton and was kept bandwith changed and in Ferris and he break the bands and was driven of the devil into the wilderness so let's stop right there we saw how the devil keeps his prisoners when you know spiritually probably most people in this world today are worse than this man so they don't even know which sex they belong they are worse than this man this man didn't recognize his room anymore he lived in gravy ax and for me growing up anytime I see a graveyard spooky to me I'm just nervous that somebody's going to jump out it scare me but this man got to a point where the graveyard was his home but you wonder because now we want to trace this man who jumped to verse 30 so verse 29 38 sorry that I said now the man out of whom the Devils were a pilot besought him that he might be with him but since Jesus sent him away saying returned to their own house let's stop right there the man had a house he had a house before but a devil's took over completely till the gravy I was better he stopped paying his mortgage he stopped paying his rent he forgot completely then he has a nice bed so spiritually the world has gone to a point where we can't even think straight but if you see the story we're going to try to bring it to a close the man people saw him in his right mind and the Prophet said one day his wife and his kids has given up on him completely one day there was a knock on the door the man that was living in the graveyard nan was in his right mind telling his wife forgive me I am back a mind is better I have been restored but he missed his home while he was in the graveyard God wants you to be a prisoner if you don't want it these are the choices like Samson like this man it took Jesus to go to set him free but I wouldn't know the history of this man he took her prophet I want to get a chance you can read some of these messages I'm going to read from he said this man belonged to a holy ghost Church he didn't want to he didn't enjoy going to check so he started missing Church and I thought why is that and the Prophet said don't you remember that people in that city have been used to demonic possession till they are afraid of anyone that can cast out Devils I give you power to cast out Devils if somebody came in the church and cast out Devils it will be looking at him and so oh I don't want too much power in this church but that's the Holy Ghost Church and so after they seen that the man's evil spirit has been cast out because we've been given power to cast our evil spirit tonight if their evil spirits even by the preaching of the way they get cast out but we've gotten to a point where we've become so like much like a mock that would like to greet read a quote and go home so he said this man used to be in a Holy Ghost church where he seen the power of God so why he was in the graveyard he was always in his heart waiting for God to do something and here comes a man cast up those evil spirits now he's in his right mind he was afraid to go back because that church there women accepting the way we think he's been set free they would think is the same person so he wanted to go with Jesus Christ and Jesus said you go back to your house and your people and tell them what God has done for you that the Holy Ghost church is still here the RAM didn't take the Holy Ghost churches away the power of the Holy Ghost is still here tonight and this man looks at everybody in our village he was ready to battle for God because he's been delivered a greater power has come back in his right and they got rid of Jesus Christ we don't want you here because you because in all the demons away loosen housewives will be we want our our pigs because our pig meat when we roasted we enjoy it and you can't Davos spirits and cause so much havoc we don't want you don't you want the Holy Ghost church tonight the power of God is still here we must exercise it when you lose on a sit loose in heaven what you barn or Nance is bound in heaven God is not coming down to bound it you and I have to bound it you and I have to lose it we have to lose ourselves to worship God because we've been hungry we've been looking at the tapes and we know God is alive where is he in my church that's what we have to come to but it takes a change that is completely surrender to God it takes a change that is an expectation that God can be among us never than we have seen before so this man was sad when he had to let Jesus go but he had Christ's heart to remind him you have the power because I will be with you to the end of the world and if you read a story when he started his testimony everybody most of the people there they got converted so when we become completely prisoners of Christ the light shines in our community wherever we go people can see God you don't have to draw people in the church God will draw them now we've gone to a point where it is just a bunch of code that's all we do it's more than a quote it's meant to bring the power of God and make us conscious of it I don't know about you but I'm yearning for that day that people who say maybe Bob ROM is dead but I see the same power in the change I see the same pillar of fire in the church it's not you or me but is us deciding that God that's what we want Lord you are welcome it's not a song anymore but it's a life we want to live we don't want to get together unless you among us Paul has experienced that that's why I said Paul a prisoner and yes I read it for you God cannot use you until you become his total prisoner I want the Holy Ghost Church so much any times I'll go to a church I hear the sing and I see what is going on I said if somebody being prophesied people are going to look ha I thought the Prophet said you can prophesy you can stop it was spirit oh I don't believe it where is the quote that you can cut out it was where you lay hands on the sick oh my goodness that was meant for the Prophet don't you yearn for a holy ghost church so let's go leave it I'm bringing it to a close so this man was so possessed he was humble this man was a lovely brother I didn't even know he goes to church until I read his message he was elaborate brother he belonged to a Holy Ghost Church but slowly he didn't like he missed the church here and there miss the prayer meeting miss going home and finally the devil slowly led him into that like he did something through now his home was not good for him graveyard living among the tombs scaring people with some demonic strength I want to tell you tonight the power of God is here tonight to cast away every evil spirit that is giving you a headache that is troubling to you because it's the same power what you bound on that is bound in heaven God is not going to bind anything in heaven he's waiting for you and I to do it he's not going to lose anything on earth he's waiting for you and I to do it and we are sitting there looking for a court a court won't do it it's you that would do it is that God is looking for prisoners and man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything connected with anything but Christ not even comma not connected with your father your mother your brother your sister husband wife pastor you are only connected with Christ then you can see God manifested I'm not sure tonight whether God met you expectation but I believe he wanted you to see here this I believe he wants you to hear this I'm reading from the message oneness he says I'm persuaded and many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just received enough of the Holy Ghost enough in us to take us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything wrong but God wants to fill every fiber of his church amen he wants to fear your thinking he wants to fear your mind he wants to feel every bit of you so you can he can make you completely total dare to yourself or to your thinking just so surrounded in God till his word is just living right through you you don't know anything else by God's Word and you just want to stay right with this way it's a life my weights alive said Jesus Christ I like that it's not enough of the Holy Ghost to go to church everyday enough to read your Bible and I have to feel convicted when you tell a lie but you need every fiber every part of you filled with the Holy Ghost that's what God is trying to do to become for us to become prisoners it's not more Pentecostal time that I spoke in tongues I have the Holy Ghost so it's all finished you haven't even started yet I'm reading a message instead that does not what we caught we caught what will help us so we can do something that we want to do but I want to bring you to Christ tonight and before we leave there's a couple of decisions we got to make and after hearing something like that we just have to help god help you to make the right decision tonight Lord I want to make the right decision I want to be your prisoner how many want to be is Wisner tonight that's time to our feet you're going to raise our hands to him everybody says something to God and say Lord I want to be your prisoner fill me with every film feed every fiber he wants to hear your voice fill me fill my children fill my husband fill this church make this charge of Holy Ghost change we have decided this is what we want open our eyes to the words of the devil make us total prisoners like Paul make us completely healer to you O Lord Jesus you see the uplifted hands you know every heart every prayer we are praying my hands are raised up we

Ghost Church but you will feel welcome in this church we thank you that you've heard our prayer wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful we thank your name we bless you wonderful I believe is here our

come but you know I could have brought some nice quotes or something to make you feel so good but I believe God wants you to be drawn closer he wants a Holy Ghost Church in Wellington and that's all that God wants and he can have that change without us so we have to get to that point where we can they I bless your name I don't know the tune but maybe where's the song leader can you help me up you
