[36:41] [Applause]
[36:57] praise the lord
[37:01] i really enjoy can you tell me down a
[37:03] bit man
[37:05] i really enjoy the um items that
[37:08] different people give because
[37:10] you can tell when it comes from
[37:11] somebody's heart
[37:13] you know there's often
[37:15] um
[37:16] songs you know the
[37:17] brother ben calls it kane sacrifice you
[37:19] know in the sort of
[37:21] denominational churches do their big
[37:23] thing and you know
[37:25] and the music's always very good you
[37:26] know but it's sort of the the look puts
[37:28] you off right and he he's like oh just
[37:29] looks like kane sacrificed to me you
[37:31] know trying to offer up something to god
[37:32] but
[37:33] and there's a there is truth to that
[37:35] but
[37:35] will do the same song and i'm like man
[37:37] that's such an anointed amazing song but
[37:39] it's it's from her heart you know and
[37:41] it's i don't know how to describe it but
[37:42] it's different
[37:44] and
[37:45] you know brother andy when brother andy
[37:46] sings the songs come from his heart and
[37:48] and that's what that's what blesses us
[37:50] as we we we can feel it we sense it so
[37:53] i'm glad so glad for that okay we've
[37:55] just got one more and then we'll do some
[37:57] worship songs
[37:59] um the next one
[38:01] yep
[38:06] this one here was um
[38:10] i was going through this
[38:12] very bad situation who's been through a
[38:13] few bad situations
[38:16] really
[38:19] i thought i was the only one
[38:24] and i went back around behind my water
[38:26] tanks and i just didn't know what to do
[38:29] and i was
[38:30] just overwhelmed by the situation
[38:34] and then this little virtue came
[38:36] straight to my head with this song and
[38:39] it said if you just let go
[38:42] let jesus take your troubles you'll make
[38:44] it all he'll make it all make it all
[38:47] right
[38:47] and it was a and
[38:49] and
[38:50] that's what i try and do these days when
[38:52] we when i get in a situation
[38:54] just let go and give our trouble to
[38:56] jesus he'll make it all right somehow
[38:59] he'll make it all right
[39:00] amen
[39:03] okay just let me remember how this goes
[39:17] if you just let go
[39:20] let jesus take your troubles you make
[39:23] them all you make them all
[39:25] make them more right
[39:32] looking up ahead in the distance it's
[39:34] hard to understand
[39:37] that every move and every step you've
[39:40] waited in your hand
[39:43] so many times i wished i
[39:46] could do it all again
[39:49] so many things that i know now that i
[39:52] wish i knew back then
[39:54] life has got a way to bring us
[39:58] to our knees it's funny when we lose it
[40:02] all
[40:03] we gain everything
[40:06] if you just let go
[40:09] let jesus take your troubles you make
[40:11] them all you make them all
[40:14] make them more right

[40:26] make them more alright
[40:32] i remember when i thought it was easy
[40:35] i thought i knew the way
[40:38] shoulders back and my head raised up in
[40:41] the cool breeze on my face
[40:44] but then as the miles they rolled on
[40:47] heart aches and broken plans
[40:50] sitting on the side of a dusty road with
[40:52] my head down in my hands life has got a
[40:55] way to bring us
[40:58] to our knees it's funny when we lose it
[41:02] all
[41:04] we gain everything
[41:07] but if you just let go
[41:09] let jesus take your troubles you'll make
[41:12] them all
[41:13] you'll make them all
[41:15] make them more
[41:18] if you just let go
[41:21] let jesus take your troubles you'll make
[41:24] them all
[41:25] you'll make them all
[41:26] make them more right like the desert
[41:29] when it blooms after the rain
[41:33] oh like the watchman smiling when he
[41:36] sees the light again
[41:38] you take a cup that's empty
[41:41] and you make it overflow
[41:44] but you gotta let it go
[41:47] you gotta let it go
[41:50] if you just let go
[41:53] let jesus take your troubles you make
[41:55] them all
[41:56] you make them all
[41:58] make them more
[42:02] if you just let go
[42:04] let jesus take your troubles you'll make
[42:07] them all you'll make them all
[42:10] make them more right
[42:13] if you just let go let jesus take your
[42:18] troubles you'll make them all
[42:20] you'll make them all
[42:21] make them more right
[42:25] if you just let go

[55:14] year of special meetings on a weekend
[55:16] such as this lawn
[55:18] father we are so thankful lord that you
[55:20] have
[55:21] by your grace provided
[55:24] this time
[55:25] and made it possible lord for those of
[55:27] us who are gathered here to be able to
[55:29] come
[55:30] and spend time in your presence in a
[55:32] setting such as this over this weekend
[55:35] lord god
[55:36] father we ask
[55:38] your special blessing lord upon all the
[55:40] services lord
[55:42] two meetings have come

[55:48] an immense blessing to
[55:50] all those that tuned in all those that
[55:52] were here lord god
[55:54] we pray for the continuation of the
[55:56] services
[55:57] a couple of days ahead lord god that you
[56:00] would bless them mightily each service
[56:02] father would tie in so perfect with that
[56:05] which went before it
[56:07] and that which will come after it we
[56:08] pray lord god
[56:10] lord we are here to welcome you
[56:13] the services law the meetings our time
[56:15] together is all about you father

[56:24] really farther than an hour late
[56:26] so late is this how can we
[56:28] do anything else but desire to draw
[56:30] closer to you fallen and for you to have
[56:33] the utmost preeminence in our lives lord
[56:36] god
[56:37] we realize fathers the word is made so
[56:40] plain before us
[56:42] we see our humanity
[56:44] we see how our flesh
[56:46] often obstructs you from
[56:48] being able to achieve your your purpose
[56:51] and its fullness in our lives are gone
[56:54] but yet knowing at the same time we are
[56:56] precisely where we are supposed to be
[56:58] for the time we are living in and that
[57:00] nothing will hinder you lord from
[57:02] bringing us
[57:03] to the full potential that you have
[57:05] called us to that is our consolation
[57:08] father all things are precisely on time

[57:31] touch each heart lord god

[57:35] all things law that for all of us we
[57:38] could realize the urgency and lightness
[57:40] of the hour
[57:41] lord this is not a time to fall around
[57:44] and father we can feel it in the
[57:46] atmosphere the hour is short and the
[57:48] time to go home is very soon
[57:50] lord
[57:52] may you strip away from us all that is
[57:55] not of you
[57:56] the lord god all that would be there
[57:59] is the character of jesus christ
[58:02] radiating through us father we ask these
[58:04] things in your precious name of jesus
[58:06] christ amen
[58:08] amen praise the lord while you're

[58:22] while you're standing if you would like
[58:23] to take your bibles this evening to
[58:26] revelation chapter seven
[58:33] we're going to read two scriptures
[58:34] tonight
[58:38] i must say i marvel at the efficiency of
[58:40] the deacons
[58:42] they they
[58:43] they are the best deacons i have seen as
[58:46] far as how they
[58:47] they think in advance about the needs of
[58:50] the minister
[58:51] and
[58:52] all the variables that might arise it's
[58:54] it's
[58:55] it's very very good
[58:57] revelation chapter 7 we want to read
[59:00] from verse 1 to verse 3.
[59:02] the scripture says john speaking and
[59:05] after these things
[59:07] i saw four angels standing
[59:10] on the four corners of the earth
[59:13] holding the four winds of the earth
[59:16] that the wind should not blow on the
[59:17] earth
[59:18] nor on the sea nor on any tree
[59:22] and i saw another angel
[59:25] ascending from the east having the seal
[59:28] of the living god
[59:30] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[59:32] four angels
[59:34] to whom it was given to hurt the earth
[59:37] and the sea
[59:38] saying hurt not the earth
[59:40] neither the sea nor the trees
[59:43] till we have sealed the servants of our
[59:46] god
[59:47] in their foreheads
[59:48] amen you see even the angels receive
[59:51] greater instruction
[59:53] amen revelation chapter 13.
[1:00:02] verses 16
[1:00:04] and 17.
[1:00:09] is that me
[1:00:13] the scripture says and he causeth all
[1:00:16] both small and great
[1:00:18] rich and poor
[1:00:20] free and bond to receive a mark
[1:00:22] in their right hand or in their
[1:00:24] foreheads
[1:00:27] and that no man might buy or sell
[1:00:30] save he that had the mark or the name of
[1:00:33] the beast or the number of his name now
[1:00:35] notice in revelation 7 there is an angel
[1:00:38] who's going forth seal to mark
[1:00:41] a people and now in revelation 13 here
[1:00:43] is another class who are being sealed
[1:00:46] who are being marked
[1:00:48] amen let's let's pray one more time
[1:00:50] gracious father lord take these two
[1:00:53] scriptures tie them together for the
[1:00:55] time that we are living in lawn for this
[1:00:58] day we are seeing that a portion of the
[1:01:01] scripture is fulfilled even now and a
[1:01:03] portion is yet to be fulfilled in the
[1:01:06] tribulation the lord god
[1:01:08] we want the holy spirit to move tonight
[1:01:12] and lord god touch every life there are
[1:01:14] those here who are sealed there are
[1:01:16] those here who are not sealed father and
[1:01:19] lord by election your holy spirit can
[1:01:21] move and will move and accomplish its
[1:01:23] eternal purpose father we ask your
[1:01:25] blessing on the service now as we go
[1:01:27] into the scriptures lord keep us sharp
[1:01:30] may we follow the continuity of the word
[1:01:32] and lord may we
[1:01:34] just be excited to go forth from this
[1:01:37] building to have the privilege and the
[1:01:38] honor to live in the age that the
[1:01:41] forefathers long to live in of the great
[1:01:43] catching away of the bride of jesus
[1:01:45] christ without seeing death we ask these
[1:01:48] things in jesus name amen amen god bless
[1:01:51] you may be seated this evening
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:00] my subject
[1:02:02] this evening
[1:02:04] is that which i preached last in our
[1:02:06] home church
[1:02:08] sealed into god's system
[1:02:10] and locked out of the beast system
[1:02:14] sealed into god's system and locked out
[1:02:17] of the beast system and before we go any
[1:02:20] further
[1:02:21] i want to extend a special thanks to
[1:02:23] shekinah tabernacle for the past six
[1:02:26] years i understand of camp meetings that
[1:02:28] they have had i understand here in otaki
[1:02:31] we think over the past six years saints
[1:02:34] we have had various ministers who have
[1:02:35] come and stood here and preached the
[1:02:37] word or over in the basketball stadium
[1:02:40] area meetings have been preached and
[1:02:42] many different people have come to these
[1:02:44] meetings over the years lives were
[1:02:46] touched lives were the livin people
[1:02:48] received the holy ghost all sorts of
[1:02:51] things have happened over the years
[1:02:53] through the the meetings that have been
[1:02:55] established here and we have all been
[1:02:57] greatly blessed by those things and i
[1:02:59] want to say to you as a church and
[1:03:01] especially to brother ben as the pastor
[1:03:03] god bless you all and may the lord
[1:03:05] richly
[1:03:06] reward you
[1:03:07] for the time and the effort and the
[1:03:09] finances that you have put into meetings
[1:03:11] such as this
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:13] whether you know it or not lives have
[1:03:15] been touched and impacted and forever
[1:03:17] changed in small ways and great ways
[1:03:19] that we will not know about until we get
[1:03:21] on the other side and so i say that
[1:03:24] because saints i don't know if there
[1:03:26] will ever be another meetings like this
[1:03:28] again
[1:03:29] and so
[1:03:30] here is an opportunity tonight to say
[1:03:33] to shekinah tabernacle god bless you and
[1:03:36] thank you for hosting meetings such as
[1:03:38] this over the years
[1:03:39] i do not know whether we will be able to
[1:03:41] gather like this as a body of believers
[1:03:43] by this time next year the time is short
[1:03:46] the pressure is on
[1:03:48] and
[1:03:49] i want to say thank you and god bless
[1:03:51] you richly for then let's give them a
[1:03:52] hand of thanks and appreciation for
[1:03:54] those things that they've done
[1:03:56] amen
[1:04:00] since i believe we are going home soon
[1:04:02] amen this is not something that we we
[1:04:06] thought was something nice to to
[1:04:08] to dream about
[1:04:10] as i say you can feel it
[1:04:12] in the atmosphere there is a pressure
[1:04:15] that you can feel coming on that is
[1:04:17] going to swing you based on your
[1:04:19] election
[1:04:21] one way
[1:04:22] or the other all seed will manifest and
[1:04:25] is being manifested in a time such as
[1:04:28] this and i for one was not expecting to
[1:04:30] be here standing tonight to speak i was
[1:04:34] coming to sit in the meetings
[1:04:37] as most of you are and i received the
[1:04:39] whatsapp message from brother ben asking
[1:04:41] if i had something if i could come armed
[1:04:43] and dangerous armed and dangerous for
[1:04:45] the meeting
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:50] and when i read his whatsapp message i
[1:04:52] immediately knew what to bring which is
[1:04:54] this thought and the reason why
[1:04:57] it was this thought is because i
[1:04:59] preached at last in the church on a
[1:05:01] wednesday night
[1:05:02] and
[1:05:03] it is very much
[1:05:06] burning within me because it's for this
[1:05:08] time it's right now you can see what i'm
[1:05:09] going to speak about tonight you can see
[1:05:11] it
[1:05:13] and
[1:05:14] i want to shake you up tonight
[1:05:17] we have some of the local saints here
[1:05:18] and in one form it's a reheat
[1:05:21] but in another form when you reheat the
[1:05:23] same meal all the juices have gone
[1:05:25] deeper and there's more flavor
[1:05:27] and there's a lot more to it
[1:05:30] and so i trust that for those who've
[1:05:32] already heard it that you would be
[1:05:33] blessed again and the lord would open up
[1:05:35] more things through this thought of
[1:05:38] being sealed into god's system and
[1:05:40] locked out of the beast system now i
[1:05:42] want to say to you tonight saints that
[1:05:45] when we look at the world today in
[1:05:47] october of 2021 we see a world that is
[1:05:50] changing with such rapidity that we
[1:05:53] cannot keep up with it and the
[1:05:55] politicians likewise cannot keep up
[1:05:58] with everything that is happening with
[1:06:00] such rapidity
[1:06:01] they can't contain it
[1:06:03] amen so what is acceptable today is
[1:06:06] suddenly change tomorrow and then
[1:06:08] reverse the day after because they are
[1:06:10] trying to contain events that are
[1:06:12] spiraling out of control in a world
[1:06:15] that we live in amen and it seems like
[1:06:20] the the normal that we once knew is gone
[1:06:22] forever the truth is it has the normal
[1:06:25] we once knew is gone forever we will
[1:06:27] never go back to the former things we
[1:06:29] once enjoyed those things are history
[1:06:31] saints we see that all events are
[1:06:33] engineered to bring the plan of god to
[1:06:35] pass the devil is having a field day
[1:06:38] under the direction of god
[1:06:40] amen to really make you ready for the
[1:06:43] catching away amen now if you look at
[1:06:46] the world today you realize that your
[1:06:48] life in the flesh has become highly
[1:06:51] restricted that the freedoms that you
[1:06:53] once enjoyed you cannot enjoy unless you
[1:06:57] follow certain criteria and so when you
[1:06:59] look at the world today it seems like
[1:07:03] what you want to do has now become
[1:07:05] impossible
[1:07:06] what you would like to do is now an
[1:07:07] impossibility it is out of reach and if
[1:07:10] you look through eyes of flesh you see a
[1:07:13] world that has made your life impossible
[1:07:16] it's made your life impossible looking
[1:07:19] at it through the eyes of flesh
[1:07:21] but if you are a son of god or a
[1:07:24] daughter of god who is anointed and
[1:07:26] indwelled by the spirit of the living
[1:07:29] god and whose spiritual eyes are
[1:07:31] anointed by the spirit of god you are
[1:07:34] looking at the same world
[1:07:36] as the man who looks at the world
[1:07:38] through the eyes of flesh and when you
[1:07:40] look at the world you marvel at how
[1:07:43] great the supernatural of god is
[1:07:46] to do what he said you are going to do
[1:07:48] and for you to go where he says that you
[1:07:50] are going to go in a time where the
[1:07:52] world says you cannot do these things
[1:07:54] now if you're looking at the world
[1:07:56] through eyes of flesh it's a world of
[1:07:58] impossibility but if you're looking at
[1:08:00] the same world
[1:08:02] with eyes that are anointed by the
[1:08:04] spirit of god you marvel at how god will
[1:08:08] do and perform his will in a way that
[1:08:11] you cannot conceive or imagine
[1:08:15] god is going to do something in a way
[1:08:17] that you have not calculated
[1:08:20] praise the lord and saint if you are in
[1:08:23] a state of fear and trepidation and
[1:08:26] unsurety about the future you need your
[1:08:29] eyes anointed by the spirit of god amen
[1:08:32] and the thing is things is that you can
[1:08:34] have the infilling of the spirit
[1:08:36] but
[1:08:37] this flesh likes to rise up and satan
[1:08:40] can anoint this flesh and your spirit
[1:08:42] realm and sow a seed of doubt to pull
[1:08:44] you away from seeing things how the
[1:08:47] spirit of god which is in you wants you
[1:08:49] to see the world
[1:08:50] amen so this evening saints
[1:08:53] it's to stir you up
[1:08:55] and have your eyes anointed
[1:08:57] to realize the time that we are living
[1:08:59] in do not look at this world and see
[1:09:01] impossibility
[1:09:03] see that this is a time of immense
[1:09:05] supernatural
[1:09:06] amen a time of immense supernatural
[1:09:09] praise the lord what i want you to
[1:09:11] understand tonight saints is in these
[1:09:13] scriptures that we have read from
[1:09:15] revelation 7 and revelation 13
[1:09:18] that the whole world
[1:09:20] is being split into two camps
[1:09:23] those who are going to fall down and
[1:09:25] worship the beast
[1:09:27] all those who are going to fall down and
[1:09:30] worship the lamb
[1:09:31] you are going to either worship the
[1:09:33] beast
[1:09:34] or you're going to worship the lamb and
[1:09:37] there is no in between
[1:09:38] and the world today is designed to put
[1:09:40] you in one camp or the other by god's
[1:09:43] design
[1:09:45] praise the lord and the lamb is the lord
[1:09:47] jesus christ
[1:09:49] and the beast is satan himself
[1:09:52] who uses the powers of the world to
[1:09:54] exercise his dominion over the world
[1:09:57] that was given to him by god
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:01] but understand it's god always at the
[1:10:04] top
[1:10:04] god is always at the top and tonight
[1:10:07] saints you are faced with a decision and
[1:10:09] at the end of these meetings you're
[1:10:10] faced with a decision
[1:10:12] whether you are going to worship the
[1:10:14] lamb
[1:10:17] follow the lamb
[1:10:19] and his will all fall down and worship
[1:10:21] the beast
[1:10:23] amen praise the lord
[1:10:25] now
[1:10:26] we see in the scripture there was a
[1:10:29] ceiling there was a ceiling of elected
[1:10:32] of an elected people
[1:10:34] and then there was a ceiling of those
[1:10:36] who were not elected
[1:10:39] and that's this time saints everybody is
[1:10:42] being sealed whether you believe this
[1:10:44] word is the truth or not
[1:10:46] does not change that you are being
[1:10:48] sealed
[1:10:50] to renounce the word is to be sealed
[1:10:54] to accept the word is to be sealed
[1:10:59] to embrace this word is to take the seal
[1:11:02] of god
[1:11:03] to reject this word is to take the mark
[1:11:06] of the beast
[1:11:07] amen there is no in between
[1:11:10] the seed what is in your heart will
[1:11:13] surely manifest
[1:11:14] this hour is designed to manifest
[1:11:17] what is in your heart
[1:11:21] amen now watch in the scripture
[1:11:25] that revelation 7 speaking of a sealing
[1:11:28] angel this ceiling angel is going forth
[1:11:30] and stealing jews
[1:11:32] but notice that where revelation 7 is
[1:11:36] put in the scripture is where the seven
[1:11:38] seals are written revelation six were
[1:11:41] the six seals revelation eight is the
[1:11:44] seventh seal and between revelation six
[1:11:46] and revelation eight is the seventh
[1:11:48] chapter
[1:11:49] talking about a ceiling angel
[1:11:51] sealing jews a jewish type is put in the
[1:11:54] bible
[1:11:56] where the story line of the seals are to
[1:11:58] do with gentiles
[1:12:01] but watch
[1:12:02] in revelation 10
[1:12:04] we know the scripture a very famous
[1:12:06] scripture again we have the same angel
[1:12:09] the sealing angel who is jesus christ
[1:12:12] coming down with a book to seal a people
[1:12:15] and he's selling who gentiles
[1:12:17] but look at what is written around
[1:12:19] revelation 10. the ninth chapter is six
[1:12:22] trumpets
[1:12:23] the eleventh trumpet the the uh the
[1:12:25] eleventh chapter is the seventh trumpet
[1:12:28] and trumpets are to do with the jews
[1:12:30] and the prophet said what the seven
[1:12:32] seals are through the
[1:12:34] gentiles is what the trumpets are to the
[1:12:37] jews
[1:12:38] so where the seals are recorded which is
[1:12:41] to do with the gentiles a jewish type
[1:12:43] has put in
[1:12:44] other people being sealed
[1:12:46] and where the trumpets are speaking
[1:12:48] about the jewish people a gentile type
[1:12:49] has put in of the mighty angel coming
[1:12:52] down and sealing a people to show really
[1:12:55] what god is achieving
[1:12:57] in a time such as this there is an angel
[1:12:59] here who is christ himself
[1:13:02] ceiling of people
[1:13:03] before the wrath of god is released in
[1:13:06] its fullness the rest of god is here now
[1:13:11] in a minor form
[1:13:13] but will not be fully released
[1:13:15] until
[1:13:18] he that restrainteth which is a spirit
[1:13:19] of god and his bride is taken away
[1:13:22] praise alone and you see the same thing
[1:13:24] in the old testament in ezekiel 9 how
[1:13:28] that there were six angels i preached
[1:13:30] this in the local church and even in
[1:13:31] wellington recently or earlier this year
[1:13:34] slaughtering angels going forth
[1:13:36] to slay who those who did not have the
[1:13:39] mark of gods
[1:13:41] that's this time but before they could
[1:13:43] go forth by god's commission
[1:13:46] and destroy
[1:13:48] the ceiling angel
[1:13:50] the holy spirit went forth
[1:13:52] then after the elected are sealed
[1:13:56] then the slaughtering can take place
[1:13:58] praise the lord so in these last days
[1:14:00] god has seen a prophet who was a little
[1:14:03] man but in him was god himself
[1:14:05] he was not god but in him was god
[1:14:09] even as god is in you
[1:14:11] it does not make you god but it does
[1:14:13] make you god
[1:14:15] isn't that a paradox
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:21] and that man who stood there and
[1:14:23] preached faithfully
[1:14:25] faithfully for your sake
[1:14:28] what was going forth on his words was
[1:14:30] the holy spirit
[1:14:31] and your response to that message
[1:14:34] is determining the world you are going
[1:14:37] to
[1:14:38] amen praise the lord now let us take our
[1:14:42] scripture of bibles and read from
[1:14:45] deuteronomy 8 verses 1 to 4.
[1:14:54] before moses
[1:14:56] died he we know that he was not to go
[1:14:59] into the land because he disobeyed the
[1:15:01] lord and smote the rock
[1:15:03] rather than speaking to the rock and the
[1:15:05] lord said because you have done this you
[1:15:07] will not go into the land so moses never
[1:15:09] went into the land but in revelation 11
[1:15:11] he's in the land
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] deuteronomy chapter 8 verses 1 to 4
[1:15:17] moses is instructing the people as the
[1:15:20] prophet
[1:15:21] as the representative of god to the
[1:15:23] people
[1:15:26] he is
[1:15:27] speaking to them
[1:15:28] warning them
[1:15:30] and admonishing them before he goes off
[1:15:32] the scene
[1:15:34] and he says in verses 1 to 4 all the
[1:15:36] commandments which i command thee this
[1:15:39] day shall he observe to do that he may
[1:15:42] live and multiply and go in and possess
[1:15:44] the land saints if you are not
[1:15:46] possessing inheritance in your life
[1:15:50] follow the word
[1:15:54] go in and possess the land which the
[1:15:55] lord swear unto your fathers
[1:15:58] unto paul
[1:16:00] and to irenaeus martin and columba the
[1:16:03] apostolic fathers that which he swore
[1:16:05] unto them
[1:16:07] that their people would would enter into
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:14] he's going to keep his word
[1:16:15] he will keep his word by you keeping his
[1:16:17] word
[1:16:20] and thou shalt remember all the way
[1:16:22] which the lord thy god
[1:16:24] led thee
[1:16:26] these forty years
[1:16:28] have you been reflecting on the last six
[1:16:30] years of kim
[1:16:32] the way the lord has led
[1:16:34] have you reflected on the spiritual
[1:16:36] journey of your churches of your own
[1:16:38] individual lives when the lord touched
[1:16:40] you and the journey he took you on how
[1:16:42] the spirit dealt with you and how the
[1:16:44] lord chastened you and how the lord
[1:16:45] built you up and how he broke you down
[1:16:47] are you rehearsing your journey
[1:16:51] remembering these things
[1:16:53] thou shalt remember all the way which
[1:16:56] the lord thy god led thee these forty
[1:16:58] years and for forty years they went in
[1:17:01] the wilderness by disobedience and the
[1:17:03] lord still led them
[1:17:06] when they refused to go into the land
[1:17:08] when they came to kirsh barnea the lord
[1:17:10] let them wonder 40 years because of
[1:17:13] disobedience and he led them in their
[1:17:15] disobedience
[1:17:18] amen
[1:17:20] now what about you tonight every phase
[1:17:22] and stage of your life when you followed
[1:17:24] god and walked away from god in all
[1:17:26] those things if you are a son of god a
[1:17:29] daughter of god you are being led by the
[1:17:31] spirit of god reflect on those things
[1:17:33] saints
[1:17:35] for even in your disobedience he is
[1:17:37] honing you and molding you and getting
[1:17:39] you ready for the great catching away
[1:17:43] amen
[1:17:45] to humble thee and to prove thee whether
[1:17:48] thou just keep his commandments or no
[1:17:51] verse 3
[1:17:52] and he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[1:17:55] hunger and fed me with manna he allowed
[1:17:58] your economy to crumble that he might
[1:18:00] show you
[1:18:01] an economy that's greater
[1:18:04] and he fed there with manna which thou
[1:18:06] knewest not in other words things that
[1:18:08] had never happened before were now
[1:18:10] opened up by this pillar of fire was
[1:18:12] leading the people
[1:18:14] things that were spoken of and might be
[1:18:16] suddenly appeared that it never appeared
[1:18:18] before
[1:18:20] manna had never happened before quails
[1:18:22] had not appeared before water from the
[1:18:25] rock had not happened before
[1:18:27] god was showing there is a supernatural
[1:18:29] they are not calculated that came into
[1:18:32] effect when the need arise
[1:18:38] neither did thy father's know that he
[1:18:40] might make thee know that man does not
[1:18:43] live by bread only but by every word
[1:18:47] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[1:18:49] lord doth man live
[1:18:51] every breath you draw is by god's
[1:18:54] permission the mobility you have and the
[1:18:56] joints of your body is by god's
[1:18:59] permission the money in your bank the
[1:19:01] car you drive the house you live in is
[1:19:03] by the word of god and if he decrees
[1:19:06] tonight that it will burn down and be
[1:19:08] taken away it's by his word you will
[1:19:10] live by his words
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:15] there is nothing you have nothing you do
[1:19:17] or will achieve that was you it was by
[1:19:20] god's words
[1:19:23] even the devil does all things by god's
[1:19:26] word
[1:19:28] verse 4 by raymond's wax not old
[1:19:32] now look at that we always have to
[1:19:34] change our clothing every few years
[1:19:38] our shoes wear out the shoes is the
[1:19:41] piece that we wear that probably wears
[1:19:42] out the fastest
[1:19:44] but here for 40 years
[1:19:46] there was preservation of footwear
[1:19:51] by raiment wax not old uponly neither
[1:19:53] did thy foot swell these 40 years there
[1:19:56] was a care being given
[1:20:00] the lord was watching over preserving
[1:20:02] and giving longevity
[1:20:05] because there was no mall in the
[1:20:06] wilderness
[1:20:08] there was no mall that they could go to
[1:20:10] to get new sneakers
[1:20:12] amen
[1:20:14] whatever clothing that you would like to
[1:20:15] wear
[1:20:17] or you're dreaming about buying in the
[1:20:18] near future there was nowhere in the
[1:20:20] wilderness to acquire those things so
[1:20:23] what they had
[1:20:24] because they were always on the move god
[1:20:26] had to preserve it which means there's
[1:20:29] another economy coming into effect
[1:20:32] when they have no means of procuring
[1:20:34] other things
[1:20:38] that's right that's for us
[1:20:40] amen
[1:20:41] but when they went into the land
[1:20:44] then their footwear wore out the
[1:20:46] clothing got tetted why because there
[1:20:48] was an ability in the land to make new
[1:20:51] footwear
[1:20:52] to make new clothing but when there was
[1:20:54] no ability to do that
[1:20:56] god preserved another economy came into
[1:20:59] effect you understand if you're walking
[1:21:02] in the ways of the lord in the word of
[1:21:04] the lord there is a higher economy that
[1:21:07] comes into play to meet need not want
[1:21:10] need
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:13] and that is where we are moving into now
[1:21:16] saints
[1:21:17] what we enjoy now will be taken away
[1:21:21] that's what i'm speaking about today
[1:21:23] saints he has been with us this far
[1:21:27] he said
[1:21:28] i i took you 40 years through the
[1:21:30] wilderness i watched over you i
[1:21:32] preserved your footwear your clothing i
[1:21:35] fed you i watered you i have been with
[1:21:37] you 40 years he's been with us this far
[1:21:39] saying
[1:21:42] he will be with us
[1:21:44] till the end
[1:21:46] he's not going to just come on the scene
[1:21:48] he's been with you
[1:21:50] all these years
[1:21:54] people are wanting jesus to come on the
[1:21:55] scene he's been on the scene
[1:22:01] he's here
[1:22:03] and he will see you through
[1:22:06] he's not responsible for those who are
[1:22:08] not carrying his seal he's responsible
[1:22:11] for his wife who bears his spirit which
[1:22:13] is his life which is a seed
[1:22:16] he will see you through
[1:22:18] now if you can see that and get that to
[1:22:20] drop below your brains
[1:22:24] then you'll look at the world today and
[1:22:26] marvel
[1:22:28] at how the supernatural
[1:22:30] of god
[1:22:32] will maneuver your life in ways that you
[1:22:35] can't figure out
[1:22:38] now let me read a quotation of the
[1:22:40] prophet
[1:22:41] look away to jesus 1963
[1:22:44] talking about the ecumenical world which
[1:22:46] was the church world where they were
[1:22:47] getting all you know you had to belong
[1:22:49] to associations in order to be able to
[1:22:51] intermingle and have church and he says
[1:22:54] it's tightening this is 1963 and then
[1:22:56] when the time comes and the press comes
[1:22:59] to a place the press comes to a place
[1:23:01] where you are pressed out
[1:23:05] that's your future saints
[1:23:07] don't hope for a change in the world you
[1:23:09] will be pressed else
[1:23:12] amen then watch what i'm fixing to tell
[1:23:15] you in a few minutes watch the third
[1:23:17] pull then
[1:23:22] watch the third pull then
[1:23:24] the third pull is not just the opening
[1:23:26] of the word and the revealing of the
[1:23:28] word it's god taking care of his people
[1:23:33] c and it will be absolutely to the total
[1:23:36] last the third pull and for the saved
[1:23:40] but it will be for the braid look at
[1:23:42] that it'll be absolutely to the total
[1:23:44] lost but it will be for the brain and
[1:23:47] the church
[1:23:48] amen what a paradox
[1:23:50] everybody gets to enjoy the third pool
[1:23:53] some are not going to enjoy it
[1:23:57] saints the squeeze is not coming
[1:24:00] here
[1:24:02] it's called a squeeze because
[1:24:04] what the word is is what it means
[1:24:07] squeeze means to squeeze
[1:24:09] it's not immediate full power
[1:24:11] application it's like a boa constrictor
[1:24:15] it winds or wraps around you
[1:24:18] and say once it's wrapped around you you
[1:24:20] can't get out
[1:24:22] it's got you
[1:24:23] and then
[1:24:25] it starts ramping up muscular pressure
[1:24:27] as it's ramping up it's pressured
[1:24:30] forcing all the life out of you
[1:24:32] that's the squeeze saints
[1:24:35] you know what we are not going to perish
[1:24:38] by this constrictor
[1:24:40] amen because the reality is this is the
[1:24:42] devil
[1:24:43] using what is happening in the world
[1:24:46] to wrap
[1:24:47] himself
[1:24:49] and try and squeeze the life out of this
[1:24:51] brain
[1:24:53] but the lord said
[1:24:55] through his prophet watch the third pool
[1:24:58] amen
[1:24:59] it's it's beyond our mental ability
[1:25:02] to try and figure out a way
[1:25:04] around the world today
[1:25:06] it's beyond me i'm not a smart person
[1:25:09] it's beyond me but i have a lot of
[1:25:11] confidence
[1:25:12] in the god i serve
[1:25:14] because he created everything and the
[1:25:17] prophet said they can't make one blade
[1:25:18] of grass
[1:25:20] they're building a rocket but a rocket
[1:25:22] is not even a
[1:25:24] a pinch of the complexity
[1:25:26] of a plate of crust
[1:25:28] and how god made that your god is very
[1:25:30] intelligent sense now why not trust in
[1:25:33] he who not only made the blade of grass
[1:25:35] but designed all the serpent seed to do
[1:25:37] what they are doing
[1:25:39] he's got absolute control
[1:25:41] now if you look at it that way why would
[1:25:43] you fear
[1:25:44] in a time such as this you could only be
[1:25:46] excited
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:50] and if you're feeling fear that is
[1:25:51] normal in a flesh body that's
[1:25:53] unconverting to fear to fear
[1:25:58] because it's not converted
[1:26:01] the soul is but not the flesh
[1:26:03] not the spirit
[1:26:04] the soul is
[1:26:07] be that into a man feed that in a man's
[1:26:09] saints
[1:26:10] that what as you feed the inner man
[1:26:14] it brings flesh and spirit subject amen
[1:26:17] that's how it is feed the inner man
[1:26:20] right that's why if we look back to
[1:26:22] victories of history it was a ceasing of
[1:26:24] feeding in a man amen and if you desire
[1:26:27] to see greater things in your own life
[1:26:29] and a realization of your potential feed
[1:26:32] the inner man
[1:26:34] i can vouch where i fall short saints is
[1:26:37] a lack of fellowship with god a lack of
[1:26:39] feeding in a man
[1:26:41] a feeding of both worlds and enjoying of
[1:26:43] both worlds is what brings defeat
[1:26:46] that's what it is
[1:26:50] but i don't content myself that this is
[1:26:52] how i will stay and nor should you
[1:26:55] feed the inside man
[1:26:57] speak to the law
[1:26:59] follow the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:27:01] and see the change don't look for change
[1:27:03] in somebody else you want change in me
[1:27:05] and change in you
[1:27:07] amen now he says watch the third paul
[1:27:10] now this is it saints when the bride
[1:27:12] goes up
[1:27:13] the prophet thought this when we
[1:27:15] are caught away
[1:27:17] into glory
[1:27:19] satan is cast down from heaven
[1:27:22] he has access to heaven not as a
[1:27:24] a brother he has access as the accuser
[1:27:27] in heaven as he was seen in job one
[1:27:30] accusing job before the lord he is
[1:27:32] allowed into heaven to accuse we've seen
[1:27:34] the book of kings an evil spirit came up
[1:27:36] before the lord to do the will of the
[1:27:38] lord in causing the prophets to prophesy
[1:27:41] a lie to fulfill the word of god
[1:27:44] but when the bride goes up
[1:27:46] the accuser is cast down
[1:27:49] this is what i want you to see now the
[1:27:51] accuser is cast down and he will
[1:27:54] incarnate himself in a man
[1:27:59] because god wants to get into flesh
[1:28:02] satan wants to get into flesh
[1:28:04] god will incarnate himself in a people
[1:28:07] satan will incarnate himself in a man
[1:28:10] and we know in the scripture that that
[1:28:13] man he is called the false prophet
[1:28:16] and the false prophet
[1:28:17] is the pope
[1:28:19] because
[1:28:20] he claims to speak for god
[1:28:22] but his authority is not of god
[1:28:25] did not come from god he was not
[1:28:27] commissioned by god amen there's no
[1:28:29] pillar of fire
[1:28:31] following their man
[1:28:34] but there's a pillar of fire
[1:28:36] that was above the head of the true
[1:28:37] prophets
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] satan will incarnate that man so the
[1:28:43] evil spirit that is on that last pope
[1:28:47] will leave that pope and satan will come
[1:28:50] into him
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:53] that will be satan incarnate now watch
[1:28:56] in the book of revelation you read
[1:28:59] about the antichrist spirit the false
[1:29:01] prophet and the beast you read that if
[1:29:04] you read your bibles
[1:29:05] dust the cobwebs off and go and read it
[1:29:07] the antichrist spirit the false prophet
[1:29:10] and the beast the antichrist spirit is
[1:29:13] satan himself
[1:29:15] all his devils are antichrist spirits
[1:29:17] likewise but he is the chief one he is
[1:29:20] the the head
[1:29:21] of his fallen kingdom
[1:29:23] he is the antichrist spirit
[1:29:25] and when he is cast down the evil spirit
[1:29:28] in the pope will leave will vacate and
[1:29:30] satan will step into him
[1:29:32] the antichrist spirit satan goes into
[1:29:35] the false prophet making him the beast
[1:29:38] satan incarnate
[1:29:42] makes him the beast
[1:29:43] and when he incarnates him
[1:29:46] then he lays down the mark of the beast
[1:29:52] he lays down the mark of the beast
[1:29:56] but before that can happen you have to
[1:29:58] ascend
[1:30:02] you have to be pressed out
[1:30:04] as the prophet said
[1:30:07] amen now what is this laying down of
[1:30:09] mark i'm thankful that i got to preach
[1:30:11] this in our home church because then
[1:30:13] when the questions come it allows me to
[1:30:14] clarify for tonight
[1:30:16] we know things of god that the mark the
[1:30:20] seal of god
[1:30:21] is a spiritual thing
[1:30:23] the mark of god is a spiritual thing and
[1:30:26] likewise the seal of the beast this mark
[1:30:29] of the beast is a spiritual thing
[1:30:32] amen and in the bible the first one who
[1:30:34] was marked was cain and he was marked by
[1:30:38] god for refusal to offer
[1:30:41] even his abel orphan
[1:30:44] cain was not required to understand
[1:30:49] the reason behind the offering of blood
[1:30:52] he was required to apply the blood and
[1:30:54] that was it
[1:30:56] and if god will that he would provide
[1:30:58] understanding
[1:31:00] behind
[1:31:01] the offering of blood
[1:31:03] but cain
[1:31:04] could not take
[1:31:06] that wood
[1:31:08] and refused and was giving a spiritual
[1:31:10] offering the fruit offering was a
[1:31:12] spiritual offering but the the
[1:31:14] sacrificial offering always came first
[1:31:18] so he had the right offering at the
[1:31:20] wrong time
[1:31:23] he would not go in the order that god
[1:31:26] had ordained
[1:31:28] and he was marked by god a spiritual
[1:31:30] mark
[1:31:31] so what was in his heart
[1:31:34] manifested because he then slew his
[1:31:36] brother but god already saw his heart so
[1:31:39] watch today in this world you have a
[1:31:42] people seven billion people and most of
[1:31:45] them cannot receive the word they cannot
[1:31:48] they are already marked
[1:31:50] if they've heard the gospel and turned
[1:31:52] it down if they've heard the word i'm
[1:31:54] saying and turn it down they have been
[1:31:56] marked
[1:31:57] god knows their heart but now when they
[1:32:00] go into the tribulation what is in their
[1:32:03] heart
[1:32:04] manifests
[1:32:06] so that they will give remember the seal
[1:32:08] the mark was placed in the forehead and
[1:32:11] in the right hand speaking of thinking
[1:32:14] and action
[1:32:17] you see sayings if a time would come
[1:32:18] where they they put something like a
[1:32:20] chip in you or whatever those things
[1:32:22] only perversions
[1:32:24] that's not the mark it's only a
[1:32:25] perversion
[1:32:26] a submarine is only a perversion of a
[1:32:28] whale an aircraft is only a perversion
[1:32:30] of a bird
[1:32:31] amen it's only a perversion of what god
[1:32:33] has already done
[1:32:37] so
[1:32:38] at that time what is in their heart will
[1:32:41] manifest
[1:32:44] because what is happening is the world
[1:32:45] is being broken right now the economies
[1:32:47] are being broken by design
[1:32:49] and the prophet said the economy will be
[1:32:52] restored against gold but for that to
[1:32:55] happen the economy has to be broken so
[1:32:58] the world is being broken that the man
[1:33:00] of sin and
[1:33:02] who is incarnated by the devil can
[1:33:04] enthrone himself restore the world and
[1:33:07] to function inside that economy you must
[1:33:10] comply with their mandates their decrees
[1:33:13] that go contrary to the word and if your
[1:33:15] heart cannot receive the word you will
[1:33:18] comply
[1:33:20] you will complain
[1:33:23] that's the mark he will cause you that
[1:33:25] the only way you can function that world
[1:33:27] system and that world economy to
[1:33:29] transact
[1:33:30] is by you
[1:33:34] forfeiting the word
[1:33:37] for that
[1:33:41] that's in the tribulation but we are
[1:33:43] seeing the ushering in of it now the
[1:33:45] tribulation being actually then right
[1:33:47] now sings
[1:33:48] we are moving into it and the bride is
[1:33:50] taken away before it comes in its
[1:33:52] fullness praise the lord he sets down
[1:33:54] the mark you read that in 1963 under the
[1:33:57] first seal the prophet shows how that
[1:33:59] the spirit the that evil spirit and the
[1:34:01] pope will leave satan incarnates him
[1:34:03] amen the same thing it was with judas
[1:34:05] iscariot who betrayed the lord jesus
[1:34:07] amen the evil spirit left him and satan
[1:34:09] stepped into him
[1:34:11] and he sold out the lords praise the
[1:34:13] lord and so the bride is gone but before
[1:34:16] she's gone she's already pressed out of
[1:34:18] this world system
[1:34:19] she's still living on this earth but she
[1:34:21] can no longer function in the natural
[1:34:23] economy
[1:34:24] she's totally pressed down as the
[1:34:26] prophet said and that's why tonight my
[1:34:28] subject is sealed into god's system and
[1:34:32] locked out of the beast system amen
[1:34:35] this is where it is going saints whether
[1:34:37] you like it or not
[1:34:39] this is where it's going and this is why
[1:34:41] it's important these things get shared
[1:34:43] to realize we're not in some fantasy
[1:34:45] fairy tale the life goes on we have more
[1:34:48] camp meetings and and it's all wonderful
[1:34:51] it's decision time
[1:34:52] it's time to get real with god amen
[1:34:55] young and old get real with god
[1:35:00] you see saints if you don't have the
[1:35:01] seal of god
[1:35:02] you go into the tribulation now that's
[1:35:04] not to bring fear we serve god because
[1:35:07] we love god
[1:35:08] amen and you realize that the seal of
[1:35:11] god is given by the grace of god and if
[1:35:14] it's his grace it sealed you would you
[1:35:16] not want to serve him
[1:35:19] you didn't have to set an exam to
[1:35:20] receive the seal of god by his grace he
[1:35:23] gave that to you before the foundation
[1:35:25] of the world and the prophet said as
[1:35:27] long as there is a little something in
[1:35:28] your heart tugging for the things of god
[1:35:30] you have not crossed the dividing line
[1:35:32] between mercy and judgment
[1:35:34] amen so tonight saints if there is as
[1:35:37] long as there's something in your heart
[1:35:39] that is tugging at the preaching of the
[1:35:41] word it shows there's still hope
[1:35:44] to still hope saints
[1:35:46] amen
[1:35:48] praise the lord i'm thankful for the
[1:35:50] grace of god because i don't pass exams
[1:35:52] too well
[1:35:56] i don't study for starters
[1:35:59] i remember one sister said here if
[1:36:00] you're going to if you're going to see
[1:36:01] an example at least pray at least study
[1:36:03] you know you can pray the past exam at
[1:36:05] least study
[1:36:07] and when she said oh yeah that's true
[1:36:09] that's probably where i went wrong
[1:36:14] but you realize saints
[1:36:15] that
[1:36:17] there will be people in the tribulation
[1:36:19] that love the lord
[1:36:21] they'll love his word
[1:36:23] because
[1:36:24] you are his bride by election
[1:36:27] by grace
[1:36:28] by grace saints and in matthew 25 we
[1:36:31] find jesus gave the parable of wise and
[1:36:33] foolish virgins one one had the oil the
[1:36:36] other did not and since the oil was the
[1:36:38] spirit but both had the letter both had
[1:36:42] the word both had the message but one
[1:36:44] didn't have the spirit of the message
[1:36:47] one did not have the spirit of the word
[1:36:49] that is why they could not take a
[1:36:51] rapture amen so a true believer is not
[1:36:55] somebody that can explain all the deep
[1:36:57] intricacies of the word a true believer
[1:37:00] is they that have the spirit of god
[1:37:04] amen
[1:37:05] praise the lord there are many people
[1:37:06] who can explain going in the tribulation
[1:37:09] because they do not have the spirit of
[1:37:11] god god is only rapturing his spirit
[1:37:15] when he is saying that he sent his
[1:37:16] spirit down on the earth now he's come
[1:37:18] to collect the spirit which isn't a
[1:37:20] multi-member brain
[1:37:25] amen so these foolish virgins
[1:37:28] love the lord now think about it
[1:37:32] jesus is the great man that everybody
[1:37:36] wants to be married to because he is the
[1:37:38] absolute example
[1:37:40] of the male specimen
[1:37:42] amen now think in the natural world you
[1:37:44] might have a real dashing good-looking
[1:37:46] man muscular and and very fashionable
[1:37:49] and extremely intelligent and every girl
[1:37:51] that sees him likes him and loves him
[1:37:53] and and follows him
[1:37:55] and hangs onto every word he says
[1:37:58] and they would love to be his wife
[1:38:00] because he is everything that they want
[1:38:03] but you know what he chooses who his
[1:38:04] wife is
[1:38:06] and that man then goes and he selects
[1:38:08] some girl and he marries her
[1:38:10] and all the other girls they still
[1:38:12] admire this man and love this man and
[1:38:13] wish that he was their husband
[1:38:16] and and perhaps follow him on on
[1:38:18] instagram and twitter and all these
[1:38:20] things
[1:38:21] and so forth but you know what
[1:38:23] they never know
[1:38:25] his true heart
[1:38:27] amen they might hear the words that he's
[1:38:29] saying but they don't know his true
[1:38:30] hearts and his wife can be sitting there
[1:38:33] with all the other girls hearing him say
[1:38:34] a certain sentence
[1:38:36] and they hear it on a certain line but
[1:38:37] she knows exactly what he means that is
[1:38:40] the true believer
[1:38:42] amen many sitting in the message ranks
[1:38:44] hearing the lord jesus speak and they
[1:38:46] love the lord jesus but only the true
[1:38:48] bride with the spirit of god knows the
[1:38:50] heart of god or what is being spoken
[1:38:53] amen and that's the difference so those
[1:38:55] people because they were not sealed to
[1:38:58] take a translation they have to seal
[1:39:00] their testimony with their blood they
[1:39:02] love the lord jesus but he just didn't
[1:39:04] choose them it's his decision saints
[1:39:07] they're not bad people it's his decision
[1:39:09] they're not my bride they love me but
[1:39:12] they will seal their
[1:39:13] testimony with their own blood and you
[1:39:15] find there'll be people in the message
[1:39:17] like that and and nominal christians out
[1:39:19] in the church world who will not bow
[1:39:21] down to this system who they can see it
[1:39:23] wrong by the word but they do not have
[1:39:25] the spirit of the living god dwelling in
[1:39:27] them to shape their character for
[1:39:29] translation
[1:39:31] see that the grace of god chose you
[1:39:33] saints
[1:39:35] amen so here in the scripture
[1:39:38] in these last days saints when you press
[1:39:41] play when you open the book you are
[1:39:44] seeing and hearing the words of the
[1:39:45] ceiling angel
[1:39:48] amen which is jesus christ which is the
[1:39:51] holy ghost which is the same pillar of
[1:39:53] fire that led the children of israel
[1:39:55] through the wilderness
[1:39:56] amen and then we find that he is called
[1:39:59] jesus he's called melchizedek
[1:40:02] he's called michael we've been through
[1:40:04] these things before michael is jesus
[1:40:06] christ who is the giver of revelation
[1:40:10] the revealer of his word
[1:40:12] sorry the protector of his word the
[1:40:14] defender of his word but as gabriel he's
[1:40:16] the revealer of his word
[1:40:18] when you find gabriel in the bible he's
[1:40:20] always imparting understanding that's
[1:40:22] jesus giving out
[1:40:24] understanding the word being opened
[1:40:28] when the word is being preached that's
[1:40:29] gabriel the holy spirit speaking and
[1:40:32] then when god comes to back his word up
[1:40:34] that's jesus that's michael
[1:40:36] amen and forcing his word michael
[1:40:38] vindicating his word the same jesus in a
[1:40:41] different office
[1:40:45] isn't it simple isn't it
[1:40:47] praise the lord
[1:40:49] and the only thing that
[1:40:51] is preventing satan from having absolute
[1:40:54] draconian rule right now
[1:40:57] remember he's limited right now is
[1:40:58] because the angel the great
[1:41:01] archangel
[1:41:02] michael jesus christ is here on the
[1:41:05] earth amen his feet are on the sea
[1:41:08] and on the land and as long as his feet
[1:41:11] that's the part of his body that's
[1:41:12] contacting the earth as long as his feet
[1:41:15] are on this earth
[1:41:17] satan
[1:41:18] is limited in how far he can go
[1:41:23] with his great plan
[1:41:27] but where is the mighty angel today
[1:41:30] this this great one that came down from
[1:41:32] heaven who was suppressing the devil and
[1:41:34] limiting the power of the devil where is
[1:41:36] he
[1:41:37] he's in pride fall
[1:41:39] because when john saw him in revelation
[1:41:41] 1
[1:41:42] he was like the son of man that was
[1:41:44] jesus in his brain
[1:41:47] when daniel saw him daniel 7 was the
[1:41:48] light one like the son of man jesus in
[1:41:51] his brain meaning that as long as you
[1:41:54] are on the earth
[1:41:55] satan can only go so far with what he
[1:41:58] can do in the world
[1:42:00] today but when you leave the earth and
[1:42:03] the holy ghost is dwelling in you in the
[1:42:05] holy ghost which is the spirit which is
[1:42:07] the blood of god
[1:42:10] leave the earth
[1:42:11] nothing can restrict the devil anymore
[1:42:14] amen so saints this is the time
[1:42:18] to get ready
[1:42:23] we are going home
[1:42:27] you soon to fall asleep tonight
[1:42:30] sleeping virgins
[1:42:33] or you want to tune in
[1:42:35] because we're going home soon
[1:42:39] the beast saints is a system but it will
[1:42:42] also be in man
[1:42:44] i've shown you how that the prophet even
[1:42:46] said he says a man without the holy
[1:42:47] ghost he is a beast
[1:42:49] unconverted man he is a beast you find
[1:42:51] nebuchadnezzar he glorified himself all
[1:42:53] that i have achieved all that i have
[1:42:55] built and all my glory and and with all
[1:42:58] the talent of my kingdom i built it and
[1:43:00] what happened to him he was given the
[1:43:02] heart of a beast the seven years and god
[1:43:04] taught him
[1:43:05] to look up
[1:43:08] god had to teach a king to look up the
[1:43:10] leader of a world empire look up
[1:43:13] amen the beast is a system and we know
[1:43:16] that because in daniel chapter 7 daniel
[1:43:19] had a dream and he saw a great sea which
[1:43:21] was a mediterranean sea and he saw
[1:43:23] empires he saw beasts coming up from the
[1:43:25] sea
[1:43:26] beasts
[1:43:27] a lion a bear a leopard and a dragon
[1:43:30] that represented world powers that rose
[1:43:32] up for a season
[1:43:35] did certain works and then declined and
[1:43:37] were broken before the next power rose
[1:43:38] up a lion a bear and a leopard babylon
[1:43:41] persia greece and rome rose
[1:43:44] and fell
[1:43:45] beasts
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:48] so it's a system a world power
[1:43:51] and then in revelation 13
[1:43:54] you know the scripture
[1:43:55] i'll read it to you so you understand
[1:43:57] notice daniel saw a beast he saw a lion
[1:44:00] a bear a leopard and a dragon but in
[1:44:03] revelation 13 verse 1 here is john now
[1:44:07] daniel is the old testament book of
[1:44:09] revelation now here is john sing the
[1:44:11] same thing and i john stood upon the
[1:44:13] sand of the sea
[1:44:15] even as daniel in his dream
[1:44:18] was looking at the scene and i saw a
[1:44:20] beast rise up out of the sea having
[1:44:23] seven heads
[1:44:25] and ten horns
[1:44:26] and upon his horns ten crowns and upon
[1:44:29] his heads the name of blasphemy now
[1:44:31] watch verse two and the beast which i
[1:44:34] saw was like unto a leopard one beast
[1:44:37] having the characteristic of a leopard
[1:44:39] and his feet were
[1:44:43] yeah
[1:44:44] they just stuck together
[1:44:47] the feet of a bear
[1:44:52] and his mouth as the mouth of a lion
[1:44:56] look at that
[1:44:57] what was babylon what was persia what
[1:45:00] was greece at the end time was all
[1:45:03] wrapped up into one power
[1:45:05] which is the modern roman power
[1:45:08] that you live under today
[1:45:12] that you function under in the natural
[1:45:14] today
[1:45:16] all the attributes and characteristics
[1:45:18] of those powers of history
[1:45:21] are all here today embodied in the last
[1:45:24] world power
[1:45:25] the beast saints is a system before it
[1:45:28] becomes a man
[1:45:31] right it's a beast it's the roman power
[1:45:33] that we speak about which is the world
[1:45:35] system today
[1:45:38] and then we find in the tribulation
[1:45:41] satan himself enthrones himself by
[1:45:44] stepping into the man who is the leader
[1:45:46] of that kingdom
[1:45:47] that's what makes him the beast
[1:45:50] you follow that
[1:45:51] praise the lord
[1:45:55] and what you're up against is this beast
[1:45:58] this power
[1:46:00] this power
[1:46:01] now watch nebuchadnezzar he also dreamt
[1:46:04] of those same powers but nebuchadnezzar
[1:46:07] saw them as metals of an image
[1:46:09] he saw that he saw he had a dream
[1:46:13] i want you to notice things see the
[1:46:15] communication that you know is your
[1:46:17] phone
[1:46:18] your internet your email
[1:46:20] but look how god
[1:46:22] was communicating
[1:46:26] nobody can shut this off
[1:46:28] you thought about it nobody can shut
[1:46:30] this off
[1:46:32] right
[1:46:33] you don't get buffering
[1:46:36] nobody shuts this off this is something
[1:46:38] far superior
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:41] and he has a dream of an image of gold
[1:46:44] silver brass and iron
[1:46:46] metals to represent those same powers
[1:46:48] babylon
[1:46:50] persia greece rome but what
[1:46:52] nebuchadnezzar saw was the exterior the
[1:46:54] outward appearance of those powers but
[1:46:56] what daniel saw was the spirit of those
[1:46:59] powers
[1:47:00] he was the prophet
[1:47:02] when he was communicated by god
[1:47:06] and god communicated with him god showed
[1:47:08] him the spirits
[1:47:09] you might look at something and might
[1:47:11] look so beautiful
[1:47:12] but if god shows you the same thing
[1:47:14] you'll see the spirit of it amen and
[1:47:17] saints of god i believe i think the
[1:47:18] prophet said if you could see the spirit
[1:47:21] that was on a woman dressed up like a
[1:47:23] tart going up the street you would never
[1:47:25] look at her again
[1:47:27] that spirit is so hideous how we need to
[1:47:30] be tuned in to a god that can help you
[1:47:33] spot the spirit
[1:47:36] i tell you saints that will sort out any
[1:47:38] troubles you have
[1:47:40] man you have trouble so lord sensitize
[1:47:42] me to the unseen because you're going to
[1:47:44] need it
[1:47:49] nebuchadnezzar's dream described the
[1:47:51] outward daniel saw the spirit and in all
[1:47:54] things saints we look at the spirits
[1:47:56] it's what
[1:47:57] the word is it's a discerner of the
[1:48:00] spirit
[1:48:02] praise the lord we the brain we are
[1:48:04] living in an age within an age
[1:48:08] we are living in the bright age
[1:48:11] that's an age within laodicea so that
[1:48:14] all around you saints
[1:48:16] is laodicea
[1:48:19] and the spirit of the age is all around
[1:48:22] you
[1:48:25] and the spirit of the age in revelation
[1:48:27] 3
[1:48:29] was for the age to be rich and increase
[1:48:31] with goods and have need of nothing it
[1:48:34] was a materialistic age
[1:48:36] the last age
[1:48:38] was the age of materialism
[1:48:42] and you
[1:48:44] as the bride living in the bright age
[1:48:45] within laodicea have the spirit of
[1:48:48] laodicea all around you trying to
[1:48:51] influence you
[1:48:57] and so saints if your desire at a time
[1:48:59] such as this in 2021 is all about
[1:49:02] natural success natural success is not
[1:49:04] sinful
[1:49:06] it's perfectly fine
[1:49:07] but if that's what drives you if that's
[1:49:09] you your foremost thing in life
[1:49:12] is to be successful is to achieve in the
[1:49:15] natural world you are under the
[1:49:17] influence of leodycia
[1:49:19] and leo decea
[1:49:22] that condition that she was in
[1:49:24] the bible says she knew not
[1:49:27] that she was in that condition the lord
[1:49:28] says you're wretched miserable poor
[1:49:30] blind naked in other words you're insane
[1:49:32] and we can agree this world is insane
[1:49:34] it's not going to be insane it is insane
[1:49:38] but because it's happening all around
[1:49:39] you and you're exposed to it you
[1:49:41] sometimes don't realize that that's
[1:49:43] insanity
[1:49:44] because it's just happening around you
[1:49:47] but that's the spirit of the age they
[1:49:48] cannot see
[1:49:50] its condition and if you get caught up
[1:49:53] under that influence saints
[1:49:55] you will not see your spiritual
[1:49:56] condition
[1:49:58] if laodicea could not see it you will
[1:50:01] not see it
[1:50:03] that's why you need to be under the word
[1:50:06] you don't come and sit under the word
[1:50:08] once
[1:50:10] you come back to the word again and
[1:50:11] again and again
[1:50:13] to look at yourself in the mirror of the
[1:50:15] word
[1:50:17] see where you're falling short
[1:50:19] to take that spirit at bay
[1:50:22] because until this has changed saints
[1:50:24] you're going to need to sit under it
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:29] the influence of laodicea
[1:50:31] and but the thing is the paradox what i
[1:50:33] i have to laugh at is that
[1:50:36] this is the materialistic age
[1:50:38] that consumes the people in a time where
[1:50:41] they're going to be stripped of all
[1:50:42] things
[1:50:45] you're not leaving this world with
[1:50:46] anything material things
[1:50:48] that's the folly of this time it's the
[1:50:50] folly of the age
[1:50:54] you're going to leave this world with
[1:50:56] nothing
[1:50:57] if you've got a nice two-story house and
[1:50:59] a ferrari in a
[1:51:01] twin port garage you're going to lose
[1:51:03] the lot and the church that you attend
[1:51:04] you're going to lose that too and your
[1:51:06] sound system and all your instruments
[1:51:07] and all the money in your bank you're
[1:51:09] going to lose the whole lot
[1:51:11] in the age of materialism
[1:51:14] as the bride of jesus christ who will
[1:51:16] not comply
[1:51:18] to the evil of this age
[1:51:22] when you are pressed out you will be
[1:51:24] pressed out with nothing but god and god
[1:51:26] alone
[1:51:28] now does that shake you up in your
[1:51:29] thinking
[1:51:30] this is not a game saints
[1:51:32] you will lose everything and that is
[1:51:34] reality if you choose to stand for this
[1:51:36] word you are going to lose everything
[1:51:41] watch
[1:51:42] in the bible
[1:51:46] we find that there was no more middle
[1:51:48] class
[1:51:51] written off in revelation 13. if you are
[1:51:53] rich now
[1:51:55] if you live an average life now just
[1:51:57] middle class or if you're poor now
[1:51:59] you will have zero
[1:52:01] even if you're poor
[1:52:02] you will have less than that
[1:52:05] because poor people have something
[1:52:07] they just don't have a lot of it that's
[1:52:09] why they're poor
[1:52:10] but the little that they do have they
[1:52:11] will not have
[1:52:13] and the much that you do have you will
[1:52:15] not have
[1:52:19] you will have absolutely nothing by
[1:52:21] god's decree
[1:52:23] not by the decree of the state
[1:52:25] not by those evil people and government
[1:52:27] by god's decree saint if you have a
[1:52:30] problem with that go and take it before
[1:52:32] the lord
[1:52:33] he is the one that has set this decree
[1:52:36] that you are going to leave the earth
[1:52:39] with nothing of this earth
[1:52:44] praise the lord
[1:52:46] this future has been fixed by god
[1:52:49] established by gods
[1:52:53] to do what
[1:52:55] to lock you out of the beast system in
[1:52:57] order to lock you into god's system
[1:53:01] to lock you out
[1:53:03] of the beast's economy that he might
[1:53:05] lock you into his economy
[1:53:07] amen right now that you just taste of it
[1:53:10] here and there
[1:53:12] you see the lord come and provide here
[1:53:13] and there
[1:53:14] you only have a little dependence on the
[1:53:16] lord as long as you've got money in your
[1:53:17] bank you find that you don't depend on
[1:53:18] the lord that much
[1:53:22] when nothing saints that's why you see
[1:53:24] greater faith in the third world
[1:53:27] greater faith they have nothing
[1:53:30] so they rely on another economy their
[1:53:32] economy is finished
[1:53:34] no hope for the third world economies
[1:53:36] there's no hope for l1 but you've got
[1:53:37] something now and you find that the age
[1:53:39] of laid a seer makes you not so
[1:53:40] dependent on god
[1:53:42] so god will allow it to be all stripped
[1:53:44] away that what is within you will make
[1:53:46] you
[1:53:47] so connect with him
[1:53:52] praise the lord this has been fixed with
[1:53:54] god by god without the mark of the be
[1:53:56] saints you will not be allowed to
[1:53:59] carry out your day-to-day life
[1:54:02] in the world that we know today
[1:54:04] but
[1:54:06] without the mark of god
[1:54:08] you will not be able to function in
[1:54:09] god's economy
[1:54:11] you have a choice which economy which
[1:54:14] system you want to comply with
[1:54:17] you want to yield to
[1:54:18] submit two that's your choice tonight
[1:54:23] what system
[1:54:24] what world
[1:54:25] do i want to give myself completely over
[1:54:28] to because nobody is going to be in
[1:54:30] between
[1:54:31] you
[1:54:32] god has a requirement
[1:54:34] my mark the beast has his requirement
[1:54:37] my mark
[1:54:40] and whatever one you take that is what
[1:54:41] allows you to transact
[1:54:46] the transactive power of the spoken word
[1:54:49] is only for those with the seal of god
[1:54:55] and if you want to buy and sell and
[1:54:56] still have a bank account soon saints
[1:54:59] you're going to have to bow down to the
[1:55:00] beast
[1:55:02] that's the reality
[1:55:06] god wants to show you
[1:55:08] that there is an economy so great
[1:55:11] so
[1:55:13] much more superior
[1:55:15] so
[1:55:16] stable that he wants you to enjoy
[1:55:21] so he has to arrange things in our world
[1:55:25] to get you in tune with it
[1:55:27] signed up to it
[1:55:30] amen
[1:55:33] saints in this age
[1:55:35] the world is requiring many things of us
[1:55:37] you know you see it in the papers
[1:55:39] you need to have this in order to be
[1:55:40] able to do things god requires something
[1:55:42] too
[1:55:42] he requires his token
[1:55:44] to be on display if you want to be able
[1:55:47] to
[1:55:47] move about
[1:55:49] in the vastness of what he has made
[1:55:50] available
[1:55:53] he requires something to saints
[1:55:56] he requires his seal his spirit and i
[1:55:59] heard a profound thing of brothers in
[1:56:00] our church just on wednesday night he
[1:56:02] said the token in you applies itself
[1:56:07] the token must be on display the holy
[1:56:08] ghost the token in you which is the holy
[1:56:10] ghost will display
[1:56:12] itself amen it will display itself now
[1:56:16] watch saying i'm going to read you a
[1:56:17] scripture from acts chapter 8 to show
[1:56:20] you how that there is a world far
[1:56:22] greater right here right now
[1:56:25] amen there is an economy that is not
[1:56:27] going to come into existence it's
[1:56:29] already here and this scripture let's
[1:56:31] look at from the book of acts which
[1:56:33] again was a historic account of what god
[1:56:36] is doing again in the last days
[1:56:38] and in acts chapter 8 we read about
[1:56:40] philip and philip had a communication
[1:56:43] that was far superior to the
[1:56:46] communication of his day all the smoke
[1:56:48] signals and the ponies that were going
[1:56:49] back and forth and and the pigeons that
[1:56:51] later came and flew messages he had
[1:56:53] something far superior
[1:56:55] and the angel of the lord spake unto
[1:56:57] philip
[1:56:58] saying and watch the exactness of the
[1:57:00] angel
[1:57:01] arise and go toward the south
[1:57:04] unto the way that goeth down from
[1:57:06] jerusalem to gaza this is a god who
[1:57:08] knows geography saints
[1:57:11] he actually knows
[1:57:13] the roads that you took to get here
[1:57:16] amen and what is going to be achieved by
[1:57:18] you taking that road so he's giving very
[1:57:20] specific instructions to philip go the
[1:57:23] specific way
[1:57:24] down from jerusalem to gaza which is
[1:57:26] desert and then philip just a base
[1:57:29] then question the lord then go and pull
[1:57:30] out a map to verify that everything was
[1:57:33] still as
[1:57:34] as the lord said and there'd be no
[1:57:36] changes redrawn on the map since god at
[1:57:39] last looked at the map god is god
[1:57:42] and he arose and went and behold a man
[1:57:45] of ethiopia and unit god never told him
[1:57:47] about the ethiopian he just said go
[1:57:50] i want you to take this route go
[1:57:53] didn't tell him that there would be a
[1:57:54] man that he was going to have
[1:57:56] interaction with and lead to the lord he
[1:57:58] just says i want you to walk
[1:58:00] god is not obligated to explain things
[1:58:02] to you saints when those angels were
[1:58:04] were sent forth in in revelation 7 to
[1:58:07] hurt the sea in the land they were just
[1:58:08] sent forth
[1:58:10] didn't tell them how long just go forth
[1:58:12] and hurt the earth
[1:58:13] and when i say stop that's when you stop
[1:58:17] amen so he goes down
[1:58:19] he finds us ethiopian a great man under
[1:58:22] the authority of candace queen of the
[1:58:24] ethiopians who had charge of all her
[1:58:25] treasure and had come to jerusalem to
[1:58:28] worship
[1:58:29] fought to worship and he was returning
[1:58:31] from jerusalem and sitting in his
[1:58:33] chariot reading isaiah the prophet then
[1:58:35] the spirit said unto philip go near and
[1:58:39] join thyself to this chariot
[1:58:41] and we find what unfolds from there is
[1:58:44] that he speaks and the ethiopian is
[1:58:46] asking what these things mean in isaiah
[1:58:48] and
[1:58:49] philip teaches him about the lord jesus
[1:58:51] which results in baptism
[1:58:53] and then in verse 39 as philip is coming
[1:58:57] out of the waters where he had baptized
[1:58:59] the ethiopian and when they would come
[1:59:01] up out of the water the spirit of the
[1:59:04] lord caught away philip
[1:59:06] he's not in a glorified body saints he's
[1:59:08] in a flesh body the spirit of the lord
[1:59:10] caught away philip that the eunuch saw
[1:59:13] him no more just gone
[1:59:16] and he went on his way rejoicing but
[1:59:18] philip was found at a zotus
[1:59:21] somewhere else
[1:59:22] gone put over here no passport
[1:59:26] no passports
[1:59:29] amen
[1:59:31] he did not need anything of this world
[1:59:33] to be able to travel
[1:59:35] when the spirit of the lord has decided
[1:59:38] where you are going to go and what you
[1:59:40] are going to do god will do it
[1:59:45] amen do you know why things are called
[1:59:47] miracles because they defy the laws of
[1:59:50] the natural world but miracles and
[1:59:52] natural laws of the unseen world
[1:59:55] that this world doesn't know about
[2:00:00] this is a man
[2:00:02] connected to something that that roman
[2:00:05] empire of his time knew nothing about
[2:00:09] he could be in a cell
[2:00:11] as we find peter was
[2:00:13] and doors
[2:00:14] which should not be opening at that time
[2:00:16] in history
[2:00:18] opened
[2:00:22] praise the lord think about that
[2:00:26] a supernatural transportation system
[2:00:30] gps tracking
[2:00:33] god knew where the unit was
[2:00:36] gone you're here philip didn't know you
[2:00:37] just you follow i'll take you right
[2:00:39] there god knows where every one of us
[2:00:42] are
[2:00:44] amen
[2:00:46] praise the lord god is wanting by his
[2:00:50] word to make you conscious
[2:00:52] that there is a greater economy saints
[2:00:55] of a superior civilization
[2:00:58] that already exists in the unseen oil
[2:01:01] it is not coming to be it is here right
[2:01:04] now saints
[2:01:06] and we are being sensitized to that
[2:01:08] reality
[2:01:10] the preaching of the word is to
[2:01:12] sensitize you
[2:01:14] not to educate you
[2:01:16] to sensitize you to connect you
[2:01:21] to the unseen world
[2:01:25] and to the god who controls the economy
[2:01:28] of that world
[2:01:30] think of this saint he controls the
[2:01:32] natural world
[2:01:35] it controls the economy of the natural
[2:01:36] world you're going to see that tonight
[2:01:38] he controls the economy of the natural
[2:01:39] world and he controls the economy of the
[2:01:42] supernatural world he controls both
[2:01:45] why do you fear
[2:01:46] yeah
[2:01:48] why are you so uns so uncertain
[2:01:51] if he controls both
[2:01:53] and and ordain that you would live in
[2:01:55] this time
[2:01:58] hasn't he got absolute
[2:02:01] control
[2:02:02] is he not absolutely aware of where
[2:02:05] you're at
[2:02:06] your needs what you're going through
[2:02:09] if you've got the seal of god and you've
[2:02:11] overturned each stone and you know
[2:02:12] there's nothing between you and your
[2:02:14] savior can't you just rest with that
[2:02:15] confidence
[2:02:18] praise the lord now watch i'll read one
[2:02:21] more scripture here you don't need to
[2:02:22] turn in one samuel 28 verse 6 samuel a
[2:02:25] saul got away from the word of the lord
[2:02:28] he disobeyed the lord he he did not
[2:02:30] hearken to what samuel instructed him to
[2:02:32] do and saul got to such a low place
[2:02:36] that the philistines
[2:02:37] came and they gathered against israel
[2:02:40] and and saul went to seek the lord and
[2:02:41] the bible says and when saul and quiet
[2:02:44] of the lord the lord answered him not
[2:02:46] neither by dreams nor by urim
[2:02:49] nor by prophets
[2:02:50] god's communication system saints
[2:02:53] by visions dreams the word of god which
[2:02:56] is the urem therma of this age and the
[2:02:58] prophet of the age
[2:02:59] god speaks but you get away
[2:03:02] from the leadership of gods out of step
[2:03:05] with god the same prophets
[2:03:08] the same word will no longer give you
[2:03:10] direction
[2:03:13] you pick up the bible and get nothing
[2:03:15] you come to church you'll get nothing
[2:03:19] when you refuse
[2:03:23] to walk
[2:03:24] and obey
[2:03:25] you don't have to understand saints
[2:03:27] you're called to obey
[2:03:30] it's his responsibility to give
[2:03:31] understanding
[2:03:33] praise alone so here is god
[2:03:36] communicating with his children in the
[2:03:38] bible and god is doing the same thing
[2:03:40] today and if you're wanting to have that
[2:03:43] real fellowship with god where he can
[2:03:45] speak to you in a night vision
[2:03:47] speak to you out of his word speak to
[2:03:48] you in the meeting tonight speak to you
[2:03:50] via hearing the hearing of the prophet
[2:03:52] or the reading of the word just get
[2:03:54] performed and fellowship with them
[2:03:56] lay this down that you might be
[2:03:57] sensitized to a higher channel
[2:04:01] a higher channel
[2:04:05] oh i tell you
[2:04:07] when we go home and our flesh acts up
[2:04:09] it's a battle but you will get there i
[2:04:11] will get that i do not let anything in
[2:04:13] my life cause me to get the press
[2:04:15] because i have a vision of where god
[2:04:17] will get me and i know i will get there
[2:04:18] right when he wants me to get their sins
[2:04:24] amen so god god
[2:04:26] god has already said in revelation 13
[2:04:30] the middle class will be gone
[2:04:33] rich and poor free bond nothing in
[2:04:36] between god said that yes god has said
[2:04:39] it
[2:04:40] no more middle class in other words i'm
[2:04:42] middle class i will not be middle class
[2:04:46] the rich are getting richer
[2:04:49] the power are getting poorer saints
[2:04:51] that's the way it is
[2:04:55] and god said that is the way it is
[2:05:00] you see
[2:05:01] i said that god has control of the
[2:05:04] economy of the natural world now i'll
[2:05:05] show you in the word how he controls it
[2:05:07] let me read 2 kings 6 24 and 25 and it
[2:05:10] came to pass after this that then a dead
[2:05:13] king of assyria gathered all his hosts
[2:05:15] and went up and besieged samaria and
[2:05:17] there was a great famine
[2:05:19] in samaria and behold they besieged it
[2:05:22] until an ass's head
[2:05:25] essa's head what sort of food is that
[2:05:27] was sold for four score pieces of silver
[2:05:29] and the fourth
[2:05:31] part of a cab of dove's dung for five
[2:05:34] pieces of silver in other words
[2:05:35] worthless goods
[2:05:37] nobody goes to the shop to buy an asses
[2:05:39] head to eat
[2:05:40] but here it was now in high demand
[2:05:43] and worth of fortune because of an
[2:05:46] economic
[2:05:48] siege
[2:05:53] and it happened because israel got away
[2:05:55] from the lord
[2:05:57] they got away from the lord
[2:06:00] and righteous people in that nation had
[2:06:02] to suffer
[2:06:03] because the king the leaders got away
[2:06:05] from the lord so the whole kingdom
[2:06:06] suffered
[2:06:08] you think all the animal kingdom has
[2:06:10] suffered because of eve's disobedience
[2:06:15] animals do nothing wrong saints they're
[2:06:17] under the effects of sin
[2:06:18] you're under the effects of sin
[2:06:21] but it was eve that disobey
[2:06:23] so when when the headship gets out from
[2:06:26] the wood
[2:06:27] everything in inside the under that in
[2:06:30] that kingdom will suffer
[2:06:33] but watch that was to king six verse 24
[2:06:35] and 25 to kings seven verse one
[2:06:39] then elisha said yes hear ye the word of
[2:06:42] the lord thus saith the lord tomorrow
[2:06:45] about this pain
[2:06:47] shall a measure of fine flower be sold
[2:06:50] for a shekel and two measures of barley
[2:06:52] for a shekel and the gate of sumeria in
[2:06:55] other words prices that went up
[2:06:56] astronomically
[2:06:58] out of reach
[2:06:59] dropped in 24 hours
[2:07:04] 24 hours all the prices were plummet
[2:07:06] we're going to plummet by the decree of
[2:07:09] the prophet who is
[2:07:11] god's spokesman
[2:07:13] an economy changed
[2:07:16] by the decree
[2:07:18] of god through his prophet
[2:07:22] think of that
[2:07:24] so who and and we find as if you read to
[2:07:27] king seven what happened
[2:07:29] sirians were camped outside the city you
[2:07:30] realize that when you're surrounded in
[2:07:32] the city you can't get out nothing can
[2:07:33] come in
[2:07:34] so then the the food that you may have
[2:07:36] comes in shorts of play and now it's in
[2:07:38] high demand and now because it's the
[2:07:40] mind the prices go up because you can
[2:07:41] make more money when there's more demand
[2:07:43] now people can't afford and then when
[2:07:45] that's consumed there's nothing more to
[2:07:46] eat so the mothers are eating their
[2:07:48] babies
[2:07:49] what you read
[2:07:52] but then a decree came from heaven and
[2:07:54] there were some leopards that were
[2:07:56] standing in the gate of samaria and they
[2:07:58] said look if we stay here we're going to
[2:07:59] die why not let's just go to the camp of
[2:08:01] the syrians and see if we can get a feed
[2:08:03] and if we die there look we're going to
[2:08:05] die anyway let's try so they go and they
[2:08:07] find the camp of the sirians is empty
[2:08:10] they're gone because the sirians
[2:08:13] the lord allowed them to hear something
[2:08:15] that was not so
[2:08:21] the lord allowed them to hear things
[2:08:23] that weren't actually there
[2:08:26] they thought they had they could hear
[2:08:28] the sound of
[2:08:29] hoof beats
[2:08:30] sound of chariots and they thought that
[2:08:33] israel had hired the hittites and all
[2:08:34] the other heights all the purple tights
[2:08:36] and
[2:08:37] all these things who come against them
[2:08:42] and drive them out but
[2:08:44] god made them hear it
[2:08:46] and so they all left
[2:08:48] and when the lepers turned up at the
[2:08:50] camp of the sirians
[2:08:51] there was just so much food
[2:08:54] and they were they were no doubt tucking
[2:08:56] into it and then they can
[2:08:58] their conscience is pricked
[2:09:00] and they realize look hey there's a
[2:09:01] whole city there that's dying for a good
[2:09:04] feed maybe we should go back and tell
[2:09:06] the king so they go back and tell the
[2:09:08] king and these things were truly so and
[2:09:10] the food came into the city and the
[2:09:11] prices dropped and life returned to
[2:09:13] normal within 24 hours
[2:09:16] by the decree of the most high god who
[2:09:19] rose in the affairs of men
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:23] and rules in your affairs
[2:09:26] so
[2:09:27] he
[2:09:28] has control of the economy and now we
[2:09:30] find in revelation 6 under the third
[2:09:33] seal what does the bible saying
[2:09:35] and when he had opened the third seal i
[2:09:38] heard the third beast say come and see
[2:09:40] and i john beheld and lower black horse
[2:09:43] and he that sat on him had a pair of
[2:09:45] balances in his hand
[2:09:48] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[2:09:49] four bc watch a measure of wheat for a
[2:09:51] penny
[2:09:53] and three measures of barley for a penny
[2:09:55] but see they'll heard not the oil and
[2:09:56] the wine now the thing to understand is
[2:09:58] that these measures that have been
[2:10:01] spoken of here
[2:10:03] require a whole day's wages to purchase
[2:10:06] because in matthew chapter 20 jesus gave
[2:10:08] the parable of the man the head of
[2:10:09] vineyard that was had come to harvest
[2:10:12] and needed all the grapes to be gathered
[2:10:14] and so he hired laborers to go into the
[2:10:16] vineyard and he agreed with them for
[2:10:19] that a day's wage would be one penny
[2:10:22] a day's wage was one penny and so when
[2:10:24] he hired throughout the successive hours
[2:10:26] of the day that was the agreement a
[2:10:28] penny for the day's labor
[2:10:31] and now here in revelation 6 under the
[2:10:33] third seal he's showing you that what
[2:10:35] you earn in one day
[2:10:37] will buy you hardly anything
[2:10:40] and that's what you're witnessing in the
[2:10:41] world right now
[2:10:43] everything is going up and up and up and
[2:10:46] in america things are getting very very
[2:10:48] bad
[2:10:49] yes and it's getting it's starting their
[2:10:51] first because they rejected their profit
[2:10:53] and what starts there is going to hit
[2:10:55] our shores
[2:10:57] that's the third seal and that's all the
[2:10:59] economics and let me tell you all the
[2:11:01] virus and and and and with the the the
[2:11:04] americans the american economy giving
[2:11:06] the people a basic living allowance
[2:11:08] which was more than they were earning
[2:11:09] when they were working they're staying
[2:11:10] home which makes a labor shortage which
[2:11:12] has created a shipping crisis which
[2:11:14] means there's less coming on your
[2:11:16] shelves it drives the prices up
[2:11:20] to fulfill what god said would be who's
[2:11:24] behind all the transportation crisis and
[2:11:26] shortage of workers
[2:11:28] who who caused the american government
[2:11:30] to go and pay out the american people
[2:11:31] more than what they were earning when
[2:11:32] they were working god did
[2:11:34] because he has his word to bring the
[2:11:35] past
[2:11:37] but he said when i'm doing all this i
[2:11:39] will see that the oil and the wine those
[2:11:41] people
[2:11:43] who have the oil
[2:11:45] my bride who has my spirits and
[2:11:47] stimulated by the word
[2:11:49] amen that comes by my spirit will be
[2:11:52] looked after even as god took care of
[2:11:55] elijah took care of the woman of
[2:11:57] zarephath took care he takes care of his
[2:11:59] own but he will bring his word to pass
[2:12:02] it doesn't feel good for us to have to
[2:12:04] live in this time but he's saying i will
[2:12:06] take care of you
[2:12:09] amen so you see no saints the stock
[2:12:11] exchange the exchange rates every aspect
[2:12:14] of the financial system is controlled by
[2:12:18] gods
[2:12:23] and all the economists can study it and
[2:12:25] theorize about it
[2:12:27] and try and change it they cannot for
[2:12:29] what has been decreed by god what will
[2:12:31] be
[2:12:35] and so saints if that is so
[2:12:37] when you are stripped by the system
[2:12:40] which you will be it's by god's decree
[2:12:43] as god gave job permission to lose all
[2:12:46] his wealth
[2:12:47] as god gave satan permission to strip
[2:12:49] job of all his wealth
[2:12:52] and of his health
[2:12:54] everything that you have comes from god
[2:12:57] the bible says by him we have our
[2:12:59] movement in other words the fact that
[2:13:01] you can walk around
[2:13:03] and not have aches and pains in your
[2:13:04] joints comes from god
[2:13:09] everything you think you're so great
[2:13:12] the prophet says people you know they
[2:13:14] don't want god he says they just haven't
[2:13:15] got sick enough yet
[2:13:19] we've got no time but guys they haven't
[2:13:20] got sick enough yet they tell you what
[2:13:22] sayings when you're sick a billion
[2:13:24] dollars winning the lottery you know
[2:13:25] when i get the when i get a cold and i
[2:13:27] feel low
[2:13:28] to win the lotto wouldn't make me feel
[2:13:30] better i just want to be better i want
[2:13:31] to be well
[2:13:35] everything you have comes from him god's
[2:13:37] dealings with you with the economy of a
[2:13:39] nation
[2:13:41] is but
[2:13:44] a type of how god deals with your
[2:13:46] economy
[2:13:48] as a family as an individual
[2:13:50] amen how he deals with the nation is but
[2:13:53] an expansion of how he deals with you
[2:13:56] all of you every family here is a an
[2:13:58] economy
[2:13:59] you have money
[2:14:01] you have assets you are an economy put
[2:14:03] all the families together you have the
[2:14:04] national economy
[2:14:06] that's how it works
[2:14:08] so if god is in control of the nation
[2:14:11] he's in control of yours because it's
[2:14:13] all
[2:14:14] the family economies that make up the
[2:14:16] national one
[2:14:19] now watch
[2:14:21] this is what you have to be aware of
[2:14:22] because you're living in laodicea
[2:14:25] and laodicea is the age of materialism
[2:14:27] and the bible says in job 1 verses 20 to
[2:14:29] 22 when job was stripped of all things
[2:14:33] more than you will ever be stripped of
[2:14:35] saints
[2:14:36] not only did he lose his assets he lost
[2:14:38] his family
[2:14:39] he lost his children showing the local
[2:14:41] church when when a son or daughter dies
[2:14:44] you can't get them back
[2:14:48] when sharon rose died the prophet
[2:14:49] couldn't get her back
[2:14:51] when hope died he couldn't get her back
[2:14:53] amen if your car dies you get another
[2:14:55] car
[2:14:58] but you can't get that same child back
[2:15:01] or if your car dies you can rebuild that
[2:15:03] same car
[2:15:05] now watch when job lost all things then
[2:15:07] job arose and rent his mantle and shaved
[2:15:09] his head and fell down upon the ground
[2:15:12] and worshipped
[2:15:13] amen look at his attitude
[2:15:17] our example he fell down upon the ground
[2:15:20] and he worshipped god
[2:15:23] you realize saints that many times we
[2:15:24] can only worship god
[2:15:26] when we are feeling up to it
[2:15:29] joe was not feeling up to it
[2:15:32] but fell down upon the ground
[2:15:34] and worships
[2:15:37] and say naked king i out on my mother's
[2:15:40] womb
[2:15:41] naked shall i return to the the lord
[2:15:44] gave
[2:15:45] the lord gave and the lord the lord is
[2:15:48] taken away
[2:15:49] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:15:53] in all this job sinned knots
[2:15:56] how many people go into the world when
[2:15:59] things don't go their way
[2:16:01] oh when they see this one walked away
[2:16:03] and this one walked away
[2:16:04] that was supposed to be a devout
[2:16:05] christian and they go and sin against
[2:16:08] the lord but in all this
[2:16:10] job who had no explanation from god sin
[2:16:13] nots
[2:16:15] and when god restored all things to job
[2:16:18] god still did not explain to him the
[2:16:20] conference that went on in heaven
[2:16:24] when god came down and made visitation
[2:16:26] to job in the form of the whirlwind he
[2:16:28] never explained to job that in heaven
[2:16:30] lucifer came up and made a challenge and
[2:16:33] god accepted the challenge job went to
[2:16:35] the grave not knowing that you know it
[2:16:38] and joe probably knows that now that
[2:16:39] he's in glory but on the earth he did
[2:16:41] not know god is not obligated to explain
[2:16:45] why things that you think should go this
[2:16:47] way don't go the way you want
[2:16:51] and because they don't go the way you
[2:16:53] want is not a reason to determine how
[2:16:56] you serve god
[2:16:58] he's still gone still worthy of worship
[2:17:01] even when things go beyond what you
[2:17:04] think they should be
[2:17:09] see job was sensitized saints he didn't
[2:17:11] have a fraction of the understanding
[2:17:13] that you have if i tell you what he had
[2:17:14] something in his soul
[2:17:16] that carried him through
[2:17:18] amen
[2:17:20] we will take nothing material with us to
[2:17:23] the next world saints
[2:17:26] the car that you polish you're not
[2:17:28] taking with you
[2:17:31] anything that you hold dear to you
[2:17:33] saints you're not taking it with you
[2:17:39] not sinful to have those things not
[2:17:42] sinful in a house have a computer
[2:17:44] these things are perfectly fine
[2:17:46] don't worship them though
[2:17:48] but the reality is god gave them to you
[2:17:50] god's taking them from you
[2:17:52] you came into this world with nothing
[2:17:54] and you're leaving this world with
[2:17:55] nothing materialistic the only thing
[2:17:57] that you are taking from this world is
[2:18:00] character
[2:18:02] the only thing that you're taking
[2:18:04] is character and the character that you
[2:18:06] are taking
[2:18:07] is the character of jesus
[2:18:12] amen not the character of method not the
[2:18:13] character of ben
[2:18:15] or anybody other person here you're
[2:18:16] taking the character of jesus with you
[2:18:19] so you must go through things in this
[2:18:21] life disappointments in this life
[2:18:24] where you get disappointed with god you
[2:18:26] must go through that in your life to
[2:18:28] shape and fashion your character
[2:18:31] so that when you are put in the position
[2:18:33] of rulership
[2:18:35] you will rule with the wisdom of god
[2:18:38] amen praise the lord
[2:18:40] we are taking only character with us
[2:18:42] saints in this world we have the poor
[2:18:44] the middle class and the rich
[2:18:47] and among the believers it's the same
[2:18:49] we are sitting here tonight a varied
[2:18:52] group and some of us are very well off
[2:18:54] some of us might be rich
[2:18:56] other others of us may just live average
[2:18:58] lives and some of us may be poor
[2:19:01] that's the reality things whether you
[2:19:02] like it or not some of us here are doing
[2:19:04] very well some of us here just live
[2:19:07] average lives and some of us just
[2:19:08] struggle
[2:19:09] we just struggle we can't make ends meet
[2:19:12] and god decreed it will be that way
[2:19:17] god ordains it that way he purposes it
[2:19:18] that way just because you're the bride
[2:19:20] does not make him obligated to make you
[2:19:22] well off
[2:19:24] he chooses whether you're going to
[2:19:26] struggle scrimp and scrape all your life
[2:19:29] and if he's chosen that then be happy
[2:19:32] maybe makes you wealthy be happy
[2:19:36] and if you just live in average life be
[2:19:37] happy
[2:19:40] because the thing is saying before you
[2:19:41] leave this world whether you're rich
[2:19:42] middle class or poor you're not going to
[2:19:44] be any of those
[2:19:45] you're going to have nothing zero
[2:19:51] no matter you've got a million dollars
[2:19:52] now you're leaving the world with
[2:19:53] nothing in the bank account with no bank
[2:19:55] account
[2:19:59] you see brethren sodom could have made
[2:20:01] abraham rich
[2:20:02] you know that
[2:20:03] sodom could have made him rich because
[2:20:05] when when lot was taken captive and then
[2:20:07] abraham went out to rescue his brother
[2:20:10] his nephew lot
[2:20:12] in doing so he managed to bring back all
[2:20:14] the other captives and the king of sodom
[2:20:16] was so grateful
[2:20:17] and wanted to reward abraham
[2:20:20] with the riches of sodom
[2:20:22] but abraham refused
[2:20:24] why
[2:20:25] lest thou sayest
[2:20:28] i have made abraham rich
[2:20:33] so who gave abraham the riches
[2:20:36] who gave abraham influence
[2:20:38] who gave abraham
[2:20:40] position god did yes amen
[2:20:46] you realize that before the king of
[2:20:47] sodom came to abraham to offer him great
[2:20:51] sums great wealth
[2:20:53] melchizedek already got to him amen
[2:20:55] the king of sodom didn't get to abraham
[2:20:57] till the end of the chapter
[2:20:59] melchizedek got there right before him
[2:21:02] abraham met melchizedek
[2:21:05] he had met the god who made him rich
[2:21:08] he met the god who made him influential
[2:21:10] who gave him position and power and gave
[2:21:12] him a name that is remembered throughout
[2:21:14] the ages
[2:21:16] people want to be famous because they
[2:21:18] want to be remembered
[2:21:20] you know anything that we do with
[2:21:21] ambition we want to leave a legacy leave
[2:21:24] a mark on time
[2:21:26] but abraham let god do that yeah
[2:21:29] let god do it saints live your life just
[2:21:32] live your life
[2:21:33] live for the lord don't live to be
[2:21:35] anything of this world just live for the
[2:21:37] lord and if it's his will to give you
[2:21:39] other things
[2:21:40] let him do it
[2:21:42] but let him do it
[2:21:44] amen
[2:21:47] god
[2:21:49] made him rich god increased him with
[2:21:50] goods that's laid to see isn't it rich
[2:21:52] and increased with goods but here is god
[2:21:54] doing it
[2:21:58] praise the lord
[2:22:00] and in genesis 15 verse 1 when abraham
[2:22:02] declined the offer of the king of sodom
[2:22:04] the scripture says
[2:22:07] and after these things the word of the
[2:22:09] lord came unto abraham in a vision
[2:22:12] a night vision a dream saying fear not
[2:22:14] abraham i am thy shield
[2:22:17] and thy exceeding great reward
[2:22:20] hallelujah
[2:22:21] i was telling the church if you serve
[2:22:23] god you are serving one who owns the
[2:22:25] cattle on a thousand hills
[2:22:27] his resources are in finites
[2:22:30] amen
[2:22:31] and if you end up getting a hundred
[2:22:33] dollars in your bank realize that he who
[2:22:35] gave you the hundred
[2:22:37] has access to unlimited
[2:22:40] but he for now he wants you to have the
[2:22:41] 100.
[2:22:44] and they don't see how everybody got a
[2:22:45] hundred dollars in the bank thanks the
[2:22:47] god who gave you the
[2:22:48] hundred has access to all things as
[2:22:51] resources and finite how can you ever
[2:22:54] come to a place where you have nothing
[2:22:58] how can you ever come to a place where
[2:22:59] where no bill could be paid
[2:23:01] if you are connected with god
[2:23:05] you are in line with god
[2:23:08] his resources are there for you
[2:23:11] and he is mindful of what you need
[2:23:14] of your situation and that is where you
[2:23:16] place your faith that's where you place
[2:23:18] your confidence
[2:23:21] in him
[2:23:24] when you learn to submit to god's will
[2:23:28] for your life
[2:23:30] and you allow him to make you either
[2:23:31] poor
[2:23:33] to lead an average life or be rich
[2:23:35] and whatever
[2:23:37] god allows you to be
[2:23:39] you will be content
[2:23:42] you've never seen an age like this where
[2:23:43] people are not content
[2:23:45] i thank my i thank the lord because i
[2:23:47] genuinely i don't care about money i'm
[2:23:49] not money hungry at all
[2:23:51] i'm not ambition to be rich
[2:23:53] i just love the lord i love his word and
[2:23:55] that's what i enjoy
[2:23:57] i don't make money doing it i have no
[2:23:58] desire to make money do i just love the
[2:24:00] lord
[2:24:01] and because of that the lord always
[2:24:02] provides
[2:24:05] always provides
[2:24:08] i don't
[2:24:09] plan scheme plots he just
[2:24:11] everything works out
[2:24:13] i still make mistakes like all all of us
[2:24:15] do
[2:24:16] basically god knows my heart i make a
[2:24:18] thousand mistakes but god knows my heart
[2:24:20] i could say like like david saying i am
[2:24:22] a very good repenter if i repent all the
[2:24:24] time
[2:24:25] i have lots to repent of
[2:24:30] and god loves that
[2:24:33] because often says we are gauging
[2:24:35] christianity by performance
[2:24:38] he doesn't look like a christian not
[2:24:39] acting like one today
[2:24:41] you know the word of god should be
[2:24:43] achieving all these great and mighty
[2:24:44] things but look at this person
[2:24:46] look at this person saints don't look at
[2:24:48] the exterior
[2:24:49] look at the heart
[2:24:51] the spirit the desire
[2:24:54] amen
[2:24:59] god can still use you with all your
[2:25:00] flaws
[2:25:01] in a mighty way you think you've done
[2:25:04] nothing wait till you get to glory and
[2:25:05] you see how god so intricately
[2:25:08] manipulated every event and you realize
[2:25:10] how god used you in your life
[2:25:13] if you're a son or daughter of god
[2:25:14] you're not put here to do nothing god is
[2:25:17] using you
[2:25:18] whether you are conscious of it or not
[2:25:20] god is using you you know what saints i
[2:25:23] remember you've all seen the ten
[2:25:24] commandments movie and there was that
[2:25:26] man in the mud pits and uh and uh he
[2:25:29] obviously wasn't performing and one of
[2:25:31] the egyptians threw a a piece of wood at
[2:25:33] him you remember that and struck him and
[2:25:34] he dropped down in the mud and and moses
[2:25:36] was still prince of egypt at the time
[2:25:39] you know covenant mud came over to him
[2:25:40] and picked him up
[2:25:42] and sort of held him in his arms and and
[2:25:44] the man was dying and
[2:25:46] and you as he was taking his last breath
[2:25:48] he expressed his disappointment in god
[2:25:50] that he never got to see the deliverer
[2:25:53] but there was moses the prince of egypt
[2:25:55] covenant mud holding him in his arm
[2:25:58] and the last thing that man saw in the
[2:25:59] movie of course
[2:26:00] was was moses but the man wasn't
[2:26:03] conscious that god had heard his prayer
[2:26:05] and that was the last thing he saw and
[2:26:07] he went to the grave died disappointed
[2:26:09] but god saw it god answered it
[2:26:13] only a movie scene but it struck me
[2:26:15] how that you pray for things and you
[2:26:17] expect the fulfillment of those things a
[2:26:19] specific way and god fulfills them and
[2:26:21] you go to the grave or you go to glory
[2:26:23] not conscious god god saw the whole
[2:26:25] thing and answered it
[2:26:31] brother dean gilchrist who i was in his
[2:26:34] church
[2:26:36] a few years ago and he recounted
[2:26:37] experience that he had where he he
[2:26:40] experienced the presence of the lord he
[2:26:41] said in a very very real way in the
[2:26:43] realest way he's ever experienced in his
[2:26:44] life and he said in that presence he
[2:26:46] said there was total satisfaction
[2:26:48] that's what struck me about what he said
[2:26:49] he said in that presence you see there
[2:26:51] was just total satisfaction amen it
[2:26:54] didn't matter what what your needs were
[2:26:57] amen
[2:26:58] whatever you were going through in the
[2:26:59] presence of god there was just peace
[2:27:04] there's just peace
[2:27:06] and so saints you go in your life
[2:27:09] through all sorts of things that that
[2:27:11] play with your emotions all kinds of
[2:27:13] ways but go in the presence of god and
[2:27:16] stay there until the peace of god comes
[2:27:19] upon you then get up off your knees and
[2:27:21] get back into living your life
[2:27:24] because the presence of god will bring
[2:27:26] the peace of god
[2:27:27] amen
[2:27:29] even though you can't work it out
[2:27:31] he's still god a man who has connected
[2:27:34] with god and in fellowship with god
[2:27:37] is a man who is content
[2:27:39] with his lot in life
[2:27:43] you're not comparing what you have with
[2:27:46] what she has
[2:27:47] what he has you're just thankful for
[2:27:50] what god has done for you
[2:27:54] amen
[2:27:55] if you think you're the most untalented
[2:27:57] person
[2:27:58] be thankful that god made you that
[2:28:02] there's no body ungifted saints
[2:28:06] it's just that you think you're that way
[2:28:07] because you compared yourself with
[2:28:09] somebody
[2:28:12] a man in fellowship with god is content
[2:28:14] you realize saints of that beast that
[2:28:15] power that roman power and daniel
[2:28:17] chapter 11 the bible says that he
[2:28:19] divides the land for gain you know that
[2:28:20] scripture the roman power would divide
[2:28:22] the land for gain and and you see that
[2:28:24] how that the whole world was broken up
[2:28:26] into trading zones and economic blocks
[2:28:28] throughout the 20th century and in all
[2:28:30] that
[2:28:32] it's still not satisfying because the
[2:28:34] bible said that roman beast and daniel 7
[2:28:36] will devour the whole earth
[2:28:39] so you think that if you attain a
[2:28:41] certain thing or buy a certain thing you
[2:28:43] get the latest phone you get a certain
[2:28:44] car that you'll be content no you'll be
[2:28:47] looking for more wanting more more more
[2:28:50] why you're not in the presence of god
[2:28:52] you're under the influence of laodicea
[2:28:56] that's a roman spirit saints that's a
[2:28:58] beast spirit it's an insatiable spirit
[2:29:04] can never be satisfied
[2:29:06] and so it keeps devouring and what
[2:29:09] happens things you start looking at what
[2:29:10] other people have you want to take
[2:29:12] you want to start breaching your
[2:29:13] boundaries
[2:29:14] breaching the territory god gave you and
[2:29:17] start taking things out of other
[2:29:18] people's land
[2:29:22] don't do that
[2:29:24] you see when we look at a man all of us
[2:29:27] all of us have a hunger and a thirst i'm
[2:29:28] winding down all of us have a hunger and
[2:29:30] a thirst from birth
[2:29:32] amen because you are flesh you are
[2:29:34] natural man and you're a spiritual man
[2:29:37] and you have to realize that what your
[2:29:39] hunger and thirst force part of it is of
[2:29:42] the flesh and part of it is from the
[2:29:44] soul
[2:29:45] but we put it all together and say this
[2:29:47] individual this man this woman they have
[2:29:49] a hunger they have a thirst they have a
[2:29:50] desire in them
[2:29:53] but if you're unconverted in the flesh
[2:29:55] you go after the things of the flesh
[2:29:59] in the natural world you want success
[2:30:02] you want to be you want to be married
[2:30:03] you want to have children you want to
[2:30:04] have a house better car boats
[2:30:07] you want to expand your business you're
[2:30:09] of the flesh
[2:30:10] thinking that by the attainment of these
[2:30:12] things you will find
[2:30:14] satisfaction you'll find the quenching
[2:30:17] of this
[2:30:19] but you find that by the attainment of
[2:30:21] those things you are not satisfied
[2:30:24] because you don't realize the depth of
[2:30:26] that desires coming from the soul
[2:30:29] and the soul is never satisfied
[2:30:32] by things of the flesh
[2:30:35] never it must be minutes ministered to
[2:30:38] by the supernatural
[2:30:40] but if you if you get the you need to
[2:30:42] get the order the right way
[2:30:45] and minister to the soul first
[2:30:49] minister to the soul first
[2:30:53] that will curb your hunger
[2:30:56] for the attainment of flesh things
[2:31:00] young people going through school or
[2:31:02] about to leave school or starting out in
[2:31:04] life
[2:31:05] feed
[2:31:07] satisfy the hunger
[2:31:08] of the spirit man the word man
[2:31:12] you'll find the ambition will not be as
[2:31:15] prominent
[2:31:17] you'll find now you want the will of god
[2:31:19] and not your will
[2:31:23] we want the will of god saints i look
[2:31:25] back in my life and i wanted to be a
[2:31:26] policeman
[2:31:27] i applied to be a policeman
[2:31:29] and i got through most of the selection
[2:31:32] and i was not allowed in
[2:31:34] and i was disappointed
[2:31:37] by jeremiah in 2021 i look at the world
[2:31:39] today and if i became a policeman
[2:31:41] i would be required to enforce things
[2:31:43] that go contrary to the word
[2:31:47] at the time i was very disappointed that
[2:31:48] was my goal that was my dream
[2:31:51] but god
[2:31:52] it is he that walks through the seven
[2:31:54] church ages he is seen in the midst of
[2:31:57] the candlesticks he moves back and forth
[2:31:58] through time he could see 2012 and 2021
[2:32:03] and he knew what was best for me
[2:32:05] amen and now i look back at that i said
[2:32:07] thank you jesus i never became a
[2:32:08] policeman
[2:32:10] because there's no way
[2:32:11] that i would be doing what they require
[2:32:13] me to do
[2:32:17] you put your trust in him saints
[2:32:19] whatever you want to do in your life
[2:32:21] whatever you want to be you
[2:32:23] put it before the lord
[2:32:25] put it before the lord
[2:32:27] then you can live a life of peace and
[2:32:29] contentment
[2:32:32] and spiritual progress

[2:33:44] that's all you'll be
[2:33:46] all that you have achieved in your life
[2:33:49] will become some granite tombstone that
[2:33:51] will age and grow moss on it
[2:33:53] people walk past it
[2:33:55] it will be forgotten
[2:33:57] it's nothing
[2:33:59] but this
[2:34:01] this is no value since it's not 10 000
[2:34:03] worlds it's it's beyond value
[2:34:06] this is what we need to focus on
[2:34:12] solomon who had all things he knew that
[2:34:14] the supernatural part is what must be
[2:34:15] ministered to he was the wisest man
[2:34:18] saints wisdom his wisdom was discernment
[2:34:20] and god gave him wisdom he gave him the
[2:34:22] sermon that's why when the prophet
[2:34:23] preached a greater than solomon is here
[2:34:25] he was talking about the discerning
[2:34:27] angel
[2:34:28] jesus christ himself who was here
[2:34:32] a few musicians would come
[2:34:34] i want to read the last quote i like
[2:34:36] this quote
[2:34:38] and i heard this recently the prophet
[2:34:40] told his life story and
[2:34:42] i like hearing the prophet's life story
[2:34:44] i like his transparency i never get
[2:34:46] tired of
[2:34:48] hearing him recount the story
[2:34:51] and he talked about how that when he
[2:34:52] disobeyed the lord his his wife as a
[2:34:55] result was dying
[2:34:56] and she was laying on a deathbed and
[2:34:59] and the prophet managed to get to her
[2:35:00] just before she was really gone
[2:35:03] and he called to hope hope hope
[2:35:05] and and it sort of brought her back to
[2:35:07] consciousness
[2:35:09] and
[2:35:10] she begin to speak to the prophet about
[2:35:13] what she was seeing
[2:35:15] when she was when her soul was moving
[2:35:17] across the dividing line between
[2:35:19] mortality and immortality
[2:35:22] and just play something that you feel to
[2:35:24] play something that's fitting
[2:35:26] uh and she says and the prophet says
[2:35:29] he says you know what i think
[2:35:31] i think god let her break into paradise
[2:35:36] just as she was going over
[2:35:38] yeah and she said you know bill that
[2:35:41] religion that we've been talking about
[2:35:43] since we received the holy ghost and i
[2:35:45] said yes
[2:35:46] i remember the prophet's distraught
[2:35:49] he is distraught rather than he is
[2:35:50] broken man
[2:35:53] she said don't never cease to preach
[2:35:55] that
[2:35:58] she said
[2:35:59] you say that religion that we've been
[2:36:01] talking about since we received the holy
[2:36:02] ghost don't never
[2:36:05] cease to preach that
[2:36:07] this is a woman this is a person who is
[2:36:10] seeing the next world
[2:36:12] you and i have not seen the next world
[2:36:14] our soul is connected to it oh you
[2:36:17] haven't seen it
[2:36:18] she did
[2:36:19] her soul was crossing over because it's
[2:36:21] supernatural vision
[2:36:23] and when the soul came back and she's
[2:36:25] telling the prophet she's teaching the
[2:36:27] prophet now
[2:36:28] she says
[2:36:30] she is now seeing the value of this
[2:36:32] gospel
[2:36:33] because she has just had a little
[2:36:36] glimpse of eternity
[2:36:38] and when a soul is coming back in the
[2:36:39] body she sees and can tell a prophet
[2:36:42] this gospel
[2:36:44] is of such value
[2:36:48] don't never cease to preach that she
[2:36:50] said stay with that
[2:36:53] she said that's the thing
[2:36:56] that's the thing saying
[2:37:00] what you want is not the thing
[2:37:03] this word
[2:37:04] this message
[2:37:06] this holy ghost
[2:37:07] that
[2:37:08] is the thing amen
[2:37:11] and the prophet said and i said honey if
[2:37:13] i
[2:37:14] would have if i just listened
[2:37:17] oh he was kicking himself saints
[2:37:20] because when hope goes she's not coming
[2:37:21] back
[2:37:22] [Music]
[2:37:25] our prophet had to make a mistake
[2:37:29] recount these things
[2:37:32] for you to appreciate
[2:37:36] the necessity and the value of this
[2:37:38] gospel
[2:37:39] amen
[2:37:41] and god allowed him to make a mistake
[2:37:43] that you might benefit
[2:37:44] that you
[2:37:47] that we might tonight
[2:37:50] he said oh if i would have listened she
[2:37:51] said yes bill she said now look honey
[2:37:53] she says i'm going fast in other words
[2:37:55] i'm i'm about to
[2:37:57] it's my last words my life's about to
[2:37:59] leave the body
[2:38:00] because i'm going far she says but
[2:38:02] remember
[2:38:04] remember that wonderful holy spirit
[2:38:07] that we've received
[2:38:10] she said it's
[2:38:11] taking me through
[2:38:18] that wonderful holy spirit that we have
[2:38:20] received the seal of gods the mark of
[2:38:24] gods
[2:38:27] that is what takes you through
[2:38:29] the veil that's what takes you into
[2:38:32] glory that's what connects you with an
[2:38:34] economy
[2:38:35] that you will have great need of saints
[2:38:38] in the times in the days months days
[2:38:40] weeks and months ahead
[2:38:42] she said it's taking me through she says
[2:38:44] promise me this honey that you'll never
[2:38:47] cease
[2:38:48] you'll never let up
[2:38:51] you'll always stand true to that
[2:38:55] she said
[2:38:57] it's wonderful in death
[2:39:00] oh from the words of a dying woman
[2:39:03] sealed by the spirit of the living god
[2:39:06] it's wonderful
[2:39:08] in death
[2:39:10] the prophet said
[2:39:11] in response to his wife says i will i'll
[2:39:14] preach this gospel
[2:39:15] and he did
[2:39:17] he preached a gun barrel straight saints

[2:45:03] i see my faults i see my humanity
[2:45:07] but i see a promise too saints
[2:45:10] think of something that was said and
[2:45:12] the message of the hour
[2:45:15] a man had a
[2:45:16] child that was dying and the cardiogram
[2:45:18] said
[2:45:19] the child would die
[2:45:21] the technology said that the child would
[2:45:23] diet and never failed before
[2:45:26] but the prophet had seen that the child
[2:45:27] would live
[2:45:28] and the man had such a confidence in the
[2:45:30] word of the prophet he was so happy his
[2:45:32] wife was so happy and the nurse and the
[2:45:34] doctor couldn't understand it we're
[2:45:36] trying to point him back to how that the
[2:45:38] the chart the cardiogram had never been
[2:45:41] wrong it was calibrated it had proven
[2:45:44] itself time and time again with other
[2:45:46] cases that proved fatal
[2:45:48] but that man he put his shoulder on he
[2:45:51] put his hand on the shoulder of that
[2:45:52] nurse
[2:45:53] he says lady
[2:45:54] you're looking at a cardiogram
[2:45:57] he says but i am looking at a divine
[2:45:59] promise
[2:46:00] hallelujah
[2:46:01] saints
[2:46:02] look
[2:46:03] at the divine promise of the word don't

[2:46:13] words

[2:58:14] amen
[2:58:15] in this word world where we roam the
[2:58:18] word of god will guide us home
[2:58:21] i'm so glad i can stand and say i can't
[2:58:23] be marked with the mark of the beast
[2:58:25] you've already been sealed by the seal
[2:58:27] of god amen the devil came too late
[2:58:30] hallelujah
[2:58:31] i trust that's everyone else's testimony
[2:58:34] and if it's not your testimony
[2:58:36] just say lord take everything out of my
[2:58:38] life that's contrary to your word you
[2:58:39] can dwell in me and he'll do the
[2:58:41] rearrangement he'll do the removal and
[2:58:44] then he'll fill you
[2:58:45] amen
[2:58:46] we don't want to have one foot in the
[2:58:47] world of one foot in god's kingdom we
[2:58:49] just want to be head foot everything we
[2:58:51] are to god's kingdom
[2:58:53] amen burn every bridge
[2:58:55] there's no point going back what's there
[2:58:57] to go back to
[2:58:58] destruction and death i just rather go
[2:59:00] into life
[2:59:02] amen we're here choose life
[2:59:04] hallelujah that's what we heard tonight
[2:59:06] choose life amen hallelujah yeah there's
[2:59:09] a scripture in revelations that says
[2:59:11] that god puts it in the mind of man to
[2:59:14] fulfill his will
[2:59:16] well i think it's revelation 17 or 18.
[2:59:19] so i'm just i'm just repeating what
[2:59:20] brother matthew said because some people
[2:59:22] think it's too far-fetched that god's
[2:59:23] actually in control no it's not too
[2:59:25] far-fetched he's put in the minds of
[2:59:27] everyone who thinks they're in power to
[2:59:29] fulfill his word
[2:59:30] whether they're aware of it or not
[2:59:32] they're fulfilling his word but we're
[2:59:34] here to fulfill his word too
[2:59:36] amen it's not just us being like a
[2:59:38] puppet master no we've willingly given
[2:59:40] our lives i mean to serve him
[2:59:42] in the same time
[2:59:44] hallelujah
[2:59:46] amen you're the lord jesus amen he's
[2:59:48] never had a conscription but he's had
[2:59:50] the most volunteers in all of history in
[2:59:52] an army to gather to him
[2:59:54] i volunteered i signed up over my own
[2:59:56] free will
[2:59:57] amen the devil tried to get me to sign
[2:59:59] up but no i just saw his terms and
[3:00:01] conditions and i saw the pay i get and
[3:00:04] his pay is the wage of sin or death so i
[3:00:06] thought i don't want that payday
[3:00:08] but then god said i'll give you life
[3:00:10] eternal
[3:00:11] and even on this side i'll give you life
[3:00:12] and life more abundantly so i thought
[3:00:14] well that's a pretty good deal that's a
[3:00:16] pretty good salary to draw that's a
[3:00:18] pretty good life insurance to draw
[3:00:20] dividends it pays off
[3:00:23] sister hope said to brother brown what
[3:00:24] we heard the end it pays off this holy
[3:00:27] ghost gospel pays off it's not in vain
[3:00:31] hallelujah
[3:00:32] i mean the word's going to guide us home
[3:00:35] hallelujah let the world fall apart it
[3:00:37] has to fall apart
[3:00:39] amen we're not we can't fall apart
[3:00:42] but
[3:00:43] don't if you're if you're teetering back
[3:00:45] and forth
[3:00:47] i pray an angel just pushes you over
[3:00:48] into into grace
[3:00:50] into salvation
[3:00:52] but god doesn't force you
[3:00:55] the devil's a cruel task master
[3:00:58] he tricks you into it then he traps you
[3:01:00] and thinks you can never be free because
[3:01:02] you knew better
[3:01:03] he does that doesn't he yes yeah
[3:01:06] but the devil's a liar
[3:01:09] you've got a you're a denounced one to
[3:01:11] accept the other or you denounce the
[3:01:13] other to accept the one so
[3:01:15] i denounced satan and i accepted the
[3:01:17] lord jesus
[3:01:19] i had to renounce the devil to accept
[3:01:21] the lord
[3:01:22] but then other people will denounce the
[3:01:24] word the lord to accept the devil
[3:01:27] i don't even want to fall into that
[3:01:28] category it's not worth it so i'd say in
[3:01:32] these meetings
[3:01:33] you know them say by some big prayer but
[3:01:35] from your heart you say lord i choose
[3:01:37] life
[3:01:39] i want your life in me lord i want you
[3:01:41] to live in me that's what i want i want
[3:01:44] to be sealed in that i can't be marked
[3:01:46] with the mark of the beast hallelujah
[3:01:49] i'm sick when you're glad that day
[3:01:51] brother phil brother fish you chose life
[3:01:55] hallelujah brother andy where are you
[3:01:56] he's probably cooking but he chose life
[3:01:58] one day
[3:01:59] hallelujah he was in a prison cell and
[3:02:01] god found him in a prison cell
[3:02:04] hallelujah
[3:02:05] hallelujah

[3:02:36] you know you should ask i won't tell the
[3:02:38] testimony i'll tell a very condensed
[3:02:40] form
[3:02:41] sister christine can tell it to you but
[3:02:44] her auntie was dying of of of brain
[3:02:46] cancer over in switzerland and and and
[3:02:49] she went over there to nurse her as she
[3:02:51] was dying she didn't know the lord
[3:02:54] and she was actually on death's door
[3:02:56] and she was terrified there were dark
[3:02:58] streaks and things moving through the
[3:02:59] through the room because she hadn't
[3:03:01] given her life to lord and and
[3:03:03] the the doctor said she was gonna die
[3:03:06] and christine interceded said lord don't
[3:03:08] let her die she's not ready and she
[3:03:09] didn't die
[3:03:11] and then during a process of time the
[3:03:13] time where the lord
[3:03:15] gave her grace
[3:03:17] and she surrendered her life
[3:03:20] and then she was going to cross over she
[3:03:23] didn't see dark streaks and demons in
[3:03:24] the room to torment her she said it's so
[3:03:26] beautiful can't you see those birds
[3:03:29] can't see that paradise
[3:03:31] hallelujah and the lord told christina
[3:03:33] said actually she's going to die i think
[3:03:35] in the next week or something and she
[3:03:36] passed on
[3:03:37] but if she could if beatrice
[3:03:40] i don't know what her last name was her
[3:03:41] her maiden name's ruik but if she could
[3:03:44] come
[3:03:44] here right now
[3:03:46] she would say
[3:03:47] that decision was worth it
[3:03:50] all the fair go she wasn't afraid to die
[3:03:52] after that sister hope if she could
[3:03:54] stand right here she'd say it was worth
[3:03:56] it brother brown would you stand here
[3:03:58] and say it was worth it the apostle paul
[3:04:00] would stand and say it's worth it all
[3:04:02] the believers down through the ages
[3:04:03] those fed to lions sauna sunder whatever
[3:04:05] that's it was worth it hallelujah
[3:04:09] it's worth it

[3:05:33] that they can go back in their life and
[3:05:36] they can go back to that time where you
[3:05:38] found them
[3:05:39] lord it wasn't us seeking you as you
[3:05:41] seeking us
[3:05:43] because you can't lose a child of yours

[3:06:00] their lives to you
[3:06:02] it's worth it lord
[3:06:04] it's worth it lord if that mighty host
[3:06:06] of witnesses could just come through the
[3:06:08] veil
[3:06:09] and they could speak to us they none of
[3:06:10] them would say it wasn't worth it that
[3:06:12] all of them say it's worth it it's
[3:06:14] greater than we can imagine
[3:06:17] lord as your prophet went beyond the
[3:06:18] curtain of time he came back lord he
[3:06:20] could describe the condition of the
[3:06:22] people and lord those things but he
[3:06:24] couldn't describe how sublime it was how
[3:06:26] great it was lord to be in that great
[3:06:28] land
[3:06:30] lord jesus and we believe and we know
[3:06:32] and soon very soon you're going to take
[3:06:33] us into that land
[3:06:35] lord we're looking forward to that time
[3:06:37] where we step into that land
[3:06:39] so father i pray lord you'd move on
[3:06:40] every heart here as it made up their
[3:06:42] mind may they say i want to go to that
[3:06:44] land
[3:06:45] may they give their lives to your mother
[3:06:47] be sealed in
[3:06:48] lord sealed into the kingdom by the
[3:06:50] baptism of the holy ghost lord not just
[3:06:52] religious not trying to be a better
[3:06:54] person but may they surrender and die
[3:06:56] out
[3:06:57] lord mother be birthed into the kingdom
[3:06:59] by the holy ghost o god
[3:07:01] lord may conviction fall in every heart
