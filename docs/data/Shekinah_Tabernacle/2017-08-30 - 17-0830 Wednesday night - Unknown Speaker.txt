would you like the competition's they sing [Music] they made him praise the Lord it's good to be here with you it's always good to be together when we worship the Lord in one Accord of one mind of one spirit something has to happen amen just as we stand I'd like to read the Word of God I've got quite a few scriptures but I start with one thought to begin with x.25 and I read from verse 17 to verse 19 that's when Paul was before Festus when he was a prisoner and here it says in verse 17 therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow I set on the judgement seat and commanded the main to be brought forth against whom when he accuses stood up they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed but had certain questions against him of their own superstition or religion and of one Jesus which was dead who Paul affirmed to be alive let's just pray Heavenly Father as we look into your word tonight Lord is only doing anything for us if you come on the scene and quicken it to our hearts I just prayed that tonight something would happen that would strengthen our faith and draw us closer to you and more into the ways you have us to walk in and ask these things a name of Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated just before we get into a subject I would like to bring to your attention verse 19 but had certain questions against him of their own superstition or religion and of one Jesus which was dead who Paul affirmed to be alive but you see that's what determines a lot of things is he dead or is he alive that makes the whole difference to some people he stayed until some people is alive and you know there are a lot of people to then he's dead even they believe he he rose from the dead we believe it but he is still dead for them because he never made him alive it happens a lot of people in that situation I have heard many testimonies of people faithfully serving God faithfully doing what he called go to church every week and and never met him alive but he had Paul affirmed him to be alive and to the others he was dead he died he was crucified it was dead but to Paul he was alive have you questioned yourself why was he alive to put because he met him on the way to Damascus that's where he met him he had an understanding of the Living God the god of Moses the God of Jacob the god of Isaac and he believed in the God he believed in the resurrection but he never met God you never met God he knew all about him but he never met him until that day when he revealed himself to him manifested said and he said Lord who I heard he said I'm Jesus from their persecutors say that was a change in his life to him then God was alive this Jesus which was dead who pull affirmed to be alive and which all should have their testimony to affirm him to be alive and if we haven't seen it was that Lord way ie I wanna experience you alive it's for all of us and you know that determines in your life a lot of things you do a lot of decisions you make a lot of worries you have oh you don't have it makes such a difference whether you you declare him alive and I would just spawn encourage you see Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he's done in your life 10 years ago it's just like he's done it today it's no difference and I sometimes say to people look it's like a landmark just mark that day when the Lord came down and ministered to you mark the day when he answered your prayer mark the day when he healed me mark today when he saved you and declare it confess it you know brother Roman said if you save act like you say confess that you saved if you're healed act like your heel confess that you're healed we cannot rise above what our confession is so if we said Jesus is alive it's a people where is he never met him he's dead or they buried him somewhere or maybe he wasn't really dead and immigrated to India or somewhere and died died later you know here all these fantasy stories but when you have met him nobody can argue with you because he declare him alive and tonight I want to declare him alive but because he declare him to be alive you want to be led by him because he's got the words of eternal life here's the spirit that leads you to into the rapture into glory so we need to hold on to the Living God now it does not always come easy we are influenced we are living in a very very interesting day in the last day and sometimes few say oh well Paul already said we live in the last day they always said we live in the last day it is the last day it is the last day and you know when he died it's definitely the last day he should die before he comes you know it's important that we not get influenced by other leadership but holy spirit leadership and we want to be established in him now I'd like to read you a scripture here in first Corinthians I read from 1st Corinthians 2 from this one and I brethren when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power for what purpose that your faith your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so he wanted to establish the people in the power of God and I believe that's important to be established in their power and it says yo establish is - it says here to make it a permanent part or to be securely in place or or cause to have a firm and lasting position to bring into context to sit on firm basis to gain full recognition and acceptance to be established in the Lord in the risen Christ the one Paul declared to be alive the one I declared tonight to be alive I mean I couldn't not deny it up be a fool I've seen him not physically I - I but I've seen him come down in his presence in power and manifesting himself and doing things you know when he talked to people about the Lord I had that experience it's it's a few years ago now I was I had a stand as a home show I used to sell a few things and then mmm there wasn't a lunchroom I sit down and then a woman from another stain came and said that do you mind if I sit here there wasn't much room as it I feel free and you can't help but sometimes you just have to talk about the Lord and I was talking to her about the Lord and the Lord came on the scene and she started to sort of tremble she started to confess sins I didn't never ask for anything and then she said doesn't it say somewhere in the Bible when to talk about him he's right there he said he's right here she said he's right here and she was trembling praise God I know where when he comes and it sorts things it takes care of things so we want to be established in that power in him in that you see many people establish their ideas in people's hearts you know you go to any denomination of people to establish their teaching in people he is a good he's good Catholic you know or is a good chap a witness or he's a good moment or he's a good message believer so to speak they're established I mean it's good to be establishing the word but Paul wanted people to be establishing power and we all have to be established in power it should not depend on somebody come to preach to you or you past or anybody else but it's you if the Holy Ghost in you then greater is He that's in you than he that's in a world then it's you and as long the enemy can keep you down and say wow you're not good enough for whatever it's not you it's him and we want to be established in that as ever hold on that you see as I say said churches are trying to establish their doctrine but we have her commander to establish the Word of God power what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of God what are we trying to do we're trying to establish our church or are we trying to establish the Word of God I like to read you a quote here from brother brain Mises the thing of it is today we don't try to establish the Word of God in people's hearts we are trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's health we are commanded to establish the Word of God Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of men that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of men but I come to you in power in manifestations of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God man wasn't established himself see but it does happen and it can be even ourselves taking preeminence over the Holy Ghost well the more intellect you're have the more dangerous it is true truth let us be simple and hold on to the risen Christ the Living God now I just like to read you a few scriptures here in 1st Samuel so you can recognize that spirit that takes you away from what we meant to have first samuel 8 is for in all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel and to rama and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in the ways in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations just think about it here they had a prophet with the Word of God a type of the Holy Ghost leaving them they never missed anything or they had everything they had the leadership of Almighty God through their prophet and here I want a king like all the other nations I remember when my wife was telling me when she was at school she found it very hard Oh what do you do what what church oh wait was something oh we brethren or we Catholics so we're Methodists and she didn't know what to say and she felt it would be so nice to have sort of a belonging and you know a lot of people liked it to belong to something and then we try to say I want to belong to this now if you belong to Christ he sometimes whooping your honor not alone he's with you but you may be rejected you may be persecuted you may be despised you don't have to put a tag on just to be part of something you need to be part of them so they sit make us a king like all the other nations what it'd be like them because it looks good you know they have a big army and they have a king sitting there and it all looks so wonderful but that's not the way the Lord leads people and then but the thing displeased Samuel now he was grieved in his spirit that's not right why did the grievin when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me see that's what it is they have rejected the Lord they haven't rejected Samuel they haven't rejected your advice they haven't reject they have rejected the Lord because they don't want that they want to be like the others that I should not reign over them he said that's they didn't want God to reign Oh them see that's it's so obvious sometimes people feel comfortable in their little religious service and toonies and and walk and they don't want the Holy Ghost to tell them oh I want to do this next week are going to do that and they're gonna do that no I don't know what the Holy Ghost to say something different you know it's human nature you can't get a plane and you want to do what do you want to do you don't need anything else don't worry I don't even want to go to church otherwise somebody might say something different no we don't want to reject the Holy Ghost leadership you never know what he leads you to I'll give you an example or what never was the big younger I was quite poor I mean rich in the Lord you know but financially I wasn't thriving and I had seven children and we needed to have a bigger house we we couldn't afford so I bought a piece of land well people didn't want it because there was a city dump next door who wants to live next to a dump you have to have a leading to buy a section next to a dump I can assure you it was the cheapest one acre section in the whole town but there was a row of trees and the wind was usually blowing from the other side so it didn't bother us but you know the moment we moved in Council he started close to dump and now it's a park how would you know that you don't but the Lord knows so when you laid by him you have a great advantage but if you labor you ain't le now I would want that no I don't want to live next to a dump but it turned out to be a real blessing because the Lord knows what's around the corner we don't that's why we need the leadership of him not walk by sight but by faith so says here in in verse nine I read from verse eight according to all the works which they have done since the day I brought them out of Egypt even unto this day we're with they have shaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them he said let him have what they want but tell him what will happen see if they say wanted and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people did ask him of a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you this will be the manner of the king he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and Sam shall run before his chariots how wonderful the severe sons were their sons when they were on the leadership of the Holy Ghost once you have a king he'll take you sons the best ones the strongest they have to serve him well son can you help me to fix the roof on a house sorry I've gone upon the king so they lose their sons verse 12 and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captain's over fifties and who sit them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots work for him no longer for the family no longer for the benefit of the household work for a king and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers and and will take your fields and your vineyards and your olive the arts even the best of them and give them to his servants well they never had to pay taxes before certainly it all comes in and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants and he will take your maidservants and your maidservants and your godliest young man and your SS and put them to his work and he will take the tenth of your sheep and you shall be his servants well that is slavery that's terrible what do you want that but they wanted it they wanted it and you shall cry out in the in that day because of your King which he shall have chosen you and the Lord will not hear you in that day I find that's a dramatic thing here they are told the consequences and they still didn't want to leadership of the Holy Ghost always still concerns the Lord and you know people always soothe something but it's not the Living God because the Living God wants to lead his sheep by his spirited sons of God are led by the Spirit of God otherwise it's a man that leads them it says nevertheless that people refuse to obey the voice of Samuel and they said night but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations and that our king my judges and go out before us and fight our battles must be so great you know having a king with all the army coming you know when you see these army presentations like the HS had one in Korea you know that tanks count the rock that's come and thousands of soldiers walk down the street the people clapping it looks great and then the planes fly over and you know a demonstration of power and have people wanted that and therefore God the one that's all powerful they can raise the hand and the Red Sea opens up they can rain fire from heaven can open the ground and swallow up whole armies they forgot about that power they want to see it you know tangibly see it and that's human nature we want to see it and honestly I wanted god I can see to be alive in my life I always said to be but I'm not I don't have fantasies I'm a realist I'm realistic if the Bible says it then it's got to be somewhere if he's alive then he's got to be somewhere and he has to be found and we can find him and we so quickly discouraged by things and we so quickly can like the other nations or say it this way like the other churches just talk about what he's done in the past and forget about him to be alive today happens happens I know people I can go to their house all they tell me all these testimonies of brother Branham what happened 60 years ago but brother Branham was preaching he's the same yesterday today and forever his spirit in you does the same works same power same miracles same manifestations and he proven it to be true all we need to do is to say Lord your spirit come in me fill me and let my mind put aside all the things I've been thinking and wondering I want to be laid by you it's wonderful and then you experience the same power the same thing or sharing it pissed at me somebody who probably hate the spoken word well what is it surprised it was the Lord speaking through you it's nothing to do with you but you have to let him have his way and I can say you know you're out in the world and you're entertained you go I have a coffee somewhere you're not always that's sensitive but there's times when when you are where is to Lord and then when you speak and if it's the Lord everybody knows this alone it's not huge I love that same power same manifestation today in you if you have the Holy Ghost the Jesus Paul affirmed to be alive living in you by His Holy Spirit their power is within you and the devil's job is to keep it suppressed so it doesn't come out keep even your faith down a level where you have to trust other people to pray in their prayers isn't yours good enough there are some times when you have prayer meetings I've noticed sometimes people tell the Lord what he should do and how he should do it but he's well capable he knows exactly how they get through to a person he knows exactly how to speak to you he knows exactly how much you can handle before you fold he knows exactly so we don't have to tell him how to do it he knows how to do things just be aware of the Living God and don't take on other lead the ship like these realize this we want a king because you can get so used to being in in the religious slavery if you're religious you're not free and you can get so used to it oh I go to church if three times a week I'll do this I pray as my my Bible study in the morning and you know some people have quite a sick program I think it's so used to but it's becomes like a slavery they're actually enslaved I said once to a person and come to the Lord I said look it's like this they have this little rabbit in the backyard and the little round cage around it and they said look it's like this here you're in the cage then the Lord Jesus comes to see free lifts off their cage but if you don't walk in there Liberty a church comes and puts a cage on you another group comes maybe puts a bigger cage on you some are very narrow cage you're allowed to do anything in this church or in this church if more liberty but still a cage ought to be lead by the Holy Ghost that is the ultimate and you know these cages if you're in a cage for years and you don't know very very sincere people they've been all their lives in a church where they have quite a tight cage I was there once I was in their cage but I sometimes broke out and so I was considered a rebel but you know they had strict rules if we want to sing in a choir you know that have a beard Wow where does that say in a Bible you know for instance and they said you sisters the way you have to do you here is such in such a way till you 16 you'll have to have plaits and after that you have to have a bun no other here hidden would be tolerated I went to church are there sincere people lovely people and they grow up for years and years and years in there and if one day her sister will forget to do her here she thinks she's going to hell because you know it's silly it's silly it's a cage it's not the Liberty Christ called us to be in but it happens you know you heard that expression Stockholm Syndrome have you ever heard of that you know when it when a person say a bad person kidnaps a girl and keeps her locked up and after months a month and year she starts to get used to being mistreated and everything and likes to be in that situation almost it's not normal still in slave captured still kidnapped and sometimes people get religious Stockholm Syndrome they think oh yeah that's it I love it I'll have to go to church you know and they force itself I love to go to church I hope you all do but it's not because you have to but it can end up that way only happens when you refuse the leadership of the Holy Spirit in your life and you know to refuse the Holy Spirit is when you have too much of a plan and I know people then they say I have to do this when I was a that's years ago I was running a training course and they had different people there I wasn't Saudi Arabia at the time and then I think six times a day all the shutters go down and the carpets come out and do bow down towards Mecca or somewhere and say their prayers the Muslims I don't I had a man on the course and he he was a Catholic he said what a stupid the religion is Muslims you know he's a head stupid six times a day he said I'm Catholic morning prayer evening prayer finished done you tell him to die to self and accept the leadership the Holy Ghost he wouldn't want that he's happy with that religion twice a day you have to say your prayers and you Danny you know in Jesus was born the Bible says he wrote and all Jerusalem was troubled we are one another King we're happy with he what he said and we're happy to pay our little Texas and have our liberties and get away with this and there we don't want anything else we don't want to hold it oh schooling and reigning over us and you know if we don't want the Holy Ghost we don't see the power that's what it is only comes in interesting ways a tell you what he comes when we at least expect him sometime you know I always say when you feel least to pray when you down I don't feel like praying I feel miserable that's the most powerful prayers when you do that when you go on your knees despite Satan get behind me I believe her trust don't feel it but I know it's the truth we'll need to do that never reject the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life he will lead you in all truth the Bible says now taking on other leadership besides the Holy Ghost is rejecting God that's what it is it's actually rejecting God and if you reject God you're not just rejected I don't want I still believe in God no you reject God you reject his work of salvation no no I believe he died for my sins so don't go hell no reject His grace you reject his power you reject all of them we cannot have him in part Oh heaven life as my savior but not as my Lord doesn't work that way have you ever met a person who marries a husband oh I want him you know for this but no before that no he's your husband he's everything he is you know I married my wife she's uh I'll marry her because she's good cooks it's not if you if you ever go cook yours they have a loving wife you have this you have one that bears your children you have a book mother you have everything it's not heaven Savior and others Lord doesn't work doesn't work that is religion that is religion and there's not the power of the Holy Ghost that's why it's missing so often say we can't be full of oneself and full of the Holy Ghost the same time you know that song we sing sometimes Jesus all for Jesus all of our planes and missions and things I surrender them I surrender them because were every one his plane and hard love there I wish that but surrender it all to him surrender it all to him then the Holy Ghost can lead you if you have plans those plans will lead you or may make you do things and make decisions accordingly and you can miss the Holy Ghost altogether it's wonderful when you are walking being led by the Holy Ghost then it doesn't matter if things work out the way you thought or they don't you know he's right with me we declare him alive we declare him alive so my convictions are my desires must be of the Holy Ghost if I'm persuading others and if it's not the Holy Ghost then it's wrong you know I can persuade people to do certain things that don't do certain things but it's got to be the Holy Ghost I've heard brother say shouldn't be going and drag him out and tell him that's wrong to do with this I said look the Lord brought him thus far the Lord will lead him on if you have a strong leaning sure you do it but often we more a hindrance if we do things if it's not inspired by the Holy Ghost so the Holy Spirit will bring conviction with remedy have you noticed is that he doesn't just say your ass in knees that look here I paid the price you know the Spirit of God has nothing in common with the spirit of denomination but that is so strong in our day you know it's not necessarily just a church it can be yourself at the nomination there's only room for Jesus and His Word and I like I like to read it another quote even brother Branham uses just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the Holy Spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues and the interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the last days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the Spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their king he was father King he took care of Israel like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles smoothed away their difficulties and settled their problems he just busied himself over them they were the only nation to which he was truly God but one day they got to looking around and so the Philistines and other nations with kings over them it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted the king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God isn't that interesting you know you can't not go ahead or hold back you have to go with win the Lord leads you know we we're in a day we want everything straight away straight away we wanted today and young people even more it's here nice car look I want that who how many horsepower who well sounds like you ly hate Oh must have that how much is it Oh $4,000 oh I've got only 1500 what can you borrow me you know can you lend me some money needs to be the Deus and now shouldn't be like that but that's the way we wanted but the Lord in his time he brings to pass his will he's word in US and through us so let's be patient see there's no other leadership we want in our lives but the Holy Spirit there are people they try to take leadership of your life and sometimes it's close to home I know I don't point fingers but I know families we the wife calls the shots absolutely and if he doesn't do that then the bare atmosphere in your home is that the Holy Ghost or is it either wife then you get husband's on the head of the house I would says you know you have to submit but they're not fully sold out to Christ then it's not the Holy Ghost leadership either say sometimes close to home these things we need to be to know what we are following you know Bible says or the Lord said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand yes sheep will know his voice it doesn't sound right don't be late by it just be aware his voice is you know it once you've heard it you hear it again you know Bible says sons have gone a little Spirit of God but you know when was Israel led by the Spirit of God through Moses when they were still in slavery but they're still in the world and I believe every one of us it was the Spirit of God and drew us after world isn't there wonderful why was oh no you can't you wouldn't have hid the Holy Ghost but he was the Holy Ghost and led you because you hear his voice because you're his sheep I love that you know it's so true and sometimes you know I knew when I was in the world are they things and and somebody was trying to tell me oh you were in the world it's probably what's the devil kind of being God you know experience miracle in the world I kind of been gone what spirit would want to lead me out of the world into Christ the Holy Ghost not the devil and he knew us before we were even born my sheep hear my voice and I always say I'm still listening to the same voice they brought me out of Egypt not another one and the one that brought me out of Egypt is the one that led me to the promised land and he's still the same one in the promised land who leads me you know Moses was the voice and then it was Joshua the same voice just another person but the same voice and we need to follow the same voice all along well he leads us into all truth if he if it just a couple of things here he's an unknown author about being lead by other things besides the Holy Ghost one of the characteristics of of six is that they judge all other believers to be lost but they claim in effect is unless you agree with me on all issues that I define as essential you cannot be saved of who that because I don't see it as their way you can't be deprived you know you know have you ever thought about it even the natural my tells you who is the bride it's the one the bridegroom comes to and says will you marry me she's the bride and I think you all know that story brother Brent tells about this farm girl she was orphaned and they're a big party this big rich man coming along and all the girls dressed up but she was in the kitchen beer feet you know doing dishes she wasn't even allowed enough then the rich man got a bit warm and put out to get some fresh air and saw this girl and he fell in love with her and he said will you marry me she said yes he said I'll come in springtime look everybody now you're not the bride if anybody it's her you know she's has more dignity and she's got this the other but she knew she was so who cause he bribed the bridegroom praise the Lord so no matter what people's opinions are offer you if he tells you I love you you can be sure he loves you Amen you see there is a spirit of denomination which sometimes is very hard to be soon I mean lots of spirit we battled with and I've got a son he just come out of off the world and he's his dad look there's so many things are here and see but I know they are of the devil aren't they oh no good I said yeah there many voices the many voices but you know when the Lord speaks and you know it when it's not the Lord yes I do so praise God you can't avoid to be exposed to all the different voices you might be thoughts in your mind where did that come from I don't want that you know obviously not familiar if you don't want it it's know from here so we have these different spirits we have spirits of denomination which is very strong like I said you can be a one-man denomination and the easiest way to become a denomination is when you reach it refused to leave ship of the Holy Ghost we have national spirits we know their national spirits sometimes they strong and sometimes they don't and sometimes they come up we've got family spirits did you know there but we don't have to be bound and leave by them I put my past under the blood so I am NOT a family spirit elite by a family spirit you know I know a family spirits to the Lord ones showed us a family spirit and we did not know we didn't want to be judgmental but that's what the Lord showed us I think of course it was obvious start to find that yeah that's a truth there are family spirits there's also the Holy Spirit hey man that's the one that's the one we want to believe by says the spirit of denomination can also just affect one person within the church also a person who is in the church denomination is not automatically led by the spirit of denomination can you get that how many people come out of a church into more light into more truth you know like I said I was in a church with such a small cage and not just two three months three and a half years and I was faithful I went to every meeting I could go and and it was faithful I endured sometimes preaching you know I thought well you you really have to have faith to sit in there for an hour you know it's it's been right there but I was lit by the Holy Ghost they preached against water baptism who do you believe that how can you believe preach against water baptism because the founder came out from churchianity and at the time the Catholic said unless you baptize you go to hell you have to be baptized otherwise you're not can't be saved so so that so that people wouldn't have confidence just in the water he they actually left it alone they didn't preach baptism but it's wrong baba says repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ and he shall receive the roomies the gift of the Holy Ghost you know I was in the church I want to be baptized because the Bible says wanted to be baptized I had to apply for it and wait six months and then there wasn't some swimming pool thing and there was for me it was an emotional experience but then later on I heard that about baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ guess what happened I was rebaptised 1st of May 1983 rebaptised name of Lord Jesus Christ coming out the water speaking in tongues and so angels are all around I said at the ceiling on the edge there no lights there but they realized they praise God I was in a denomination but I was not led by that spirit it's a sooner or later the Lord takes you out of it into him so never judge people by where they are or you know if you got our message to you not all automatically lit by the Holy Ghost it's not youth it's an individual of fear so the Holy Spirit leadership can be accepted and followed anywhere in church at work at home on holidays basic and every part of our lives any given point I worked as a man comes 5 o'clock is here now we can soothe God again you know well maybe I wasn't the best worker I can help but just talk about the Lord the whole day know I don't know think most useless in some areas but you see you can not to say now I can't soothe God now I can soothe God you can restrict them if you restrict him you restrict the power and you restrict the glory that's for you and meant for you now give you an a just a couple of practical thoughts the spear of denomination restricts the Holy Ghost movement and leadership often due to the fact of self-inflicted boundaries and restrictions too I've known people decide a contract are gonna work three years in Saudi Arabia I've been to Saudi Arabia but only three weeks to run the course but this man he signed a contract three years he said well three years of my wife the money is good but you know it was hot it they were in a closing compound they had the food and everything for free they were that weren't able to do anything they were not allowed to preach the gospel it's prohibited so how can you so they basically say I signed I signed for three years so the Holy Ghost can only lead me in teri Arabia he's can't move me to America he can't move me to New Zealand you can't sent me anywhere else because I signed the paper tell you what time to paper if God says sign this paper I want you here for three years do it but if you're not sure don't get yourself in a situation where you restrict his movement you know the spirit that spirit can't or you can restrict you know people sometimes I know people they buy stuff on high perches all right and get them self indebted very much and then you hear in the prayer meetings oh you know lord help me to pay my debts I need but I need work and they eat money you know self-inflicted and then you restrict the Holy Ghost movement you don't have to stay there you repent and he takes you straight back to where you left it repentance I know I mean he went into a partnership with another mean looked all good you know will bite us together and make money and sell it again and whatever his confession to me was about three years later he said brother I lost all my money I had a nearly lost my life he got so upset and problems and things restricting the Holy Ghost the Lord can only bless you and him together I mean husband wife is good partnership but you know sometimes it's so easily done but the Holy Spirit might want to leave you lift and the other one he might want to leave right but then it's not a partnership partnership is you and Christ that's the partnership you know I'm just saying this not as a as a rule you know what I mean but I want to say don't restrict the leading of the Holy Ghost if you're free and sole down to Lord whatever you have here I am you can't do them if you restrict yourself and sign yourself over to whatever that's why I would say it's very very very important for a woman who gets married that she knows that's the perfect will of God because you you loose some kind of Liberty you know you can't just say look I'm taking off for a few months so what I would go for my overseas trip no you're at home you you look after things so that's why we need to be hearing from God otherwise we open ourselves for misery and then the Lord can't lead you live because you decided you want to stay right here hope you know it's I'll give you just a quote here then we just about closed up here bar embassies clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man jesus said now I mean like your house rent and stuff that's different you know you have to pay rent you got to do it get all your things off your hands get everything right make ready get ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen it can't be ready if you tied down you can't still Lord sit look I want you all oh I don't know how to put it but I went to shop the other day I know this man there is a Muslim there where is I'm here is his name where is he oh you ain't to Saudi Arabia before you know all Muslims once in a lifetime they have to go a pilgrimage to somewhere up there and he faithfully does that I don't think he's he's going all the way to Saudi Arabia because of a religious belief but if the Holy Spirit would tell you to go to a place can you do it or send our Lord sorry I just did this so tight myself down here it's got to be according to his perfect will and we need to know it like Paul I just want to go back once more to Paul when he was in prison the Lord appeared to him and says as you were a witness for me in Jerusalem so will you be a witness in Rome and the next thing his nephew heard that they made a plot to kill him to say regard a king look we need to ask some more questions when he brings him out we kill him 40 man said we don't eat nor drink till he's dead then if you heard that and then if you went and told Paul Paul didn't just say why don't worry I'm predestinated the word says got it wrong I'll be a witnessing wrong don't worry just relax no he had to bring the word to pass make your election and calling sure the Bible says if you know the will of God walk in it so he did every put everything in place he could to hinder that he would be killed and he sent the nephew with a letter to to the king and and he explained it and then they took him by night and with a with an army and and save them but you see it's we have the word but we have to play our part with it you know we need to play our path I said the other day it's like this symphony you know when when you have music and you have one party in it you have to follow the music even if you just have one heart and you won one guy I went to school with them and it was not the brightest what name anybody but he wasn't the brightest but he played in no history I said well you have to be clever but you know what he played those two do you call him simple she smoked together and in a whole piece of music he only came in once or twice bang bang and that's what all he had to do but he had to follow the sheep music and know when it was his turn so that's what I'm saying we have to be in line with the word and play our part so we know when when he wants us to move and use us let's do it amen just in closing here I said live by faith but don't tempt God if you are in the faith under leadership for the Holy Ghost ain't know what the situation is you will have joy come up with a new new instrument a faithful meter you know measure you the level of faith we have and the increments are in joy if you're healthy you have joy that's our faith in the Lord you know truth will line up with the Bible same works same anointing same power power and if we don't see it in our lives we only have to that's Christ of yesterday if we don't see it in our lives and as I said I'm a realist I want to see it if I don't see it white until it comes seek the Lord until you find him you know one of the greatest greatest annoying things that came down my wife and I we were living in a flat once and they'd had an evil spirit in it when Christine was still young and it affected us it affected her she was nearly killed like strangled and something was funny in that house and I had we had a lot of arguments and things that was just not right and I worked at 40-hour week and and then one night I woke up as one o'clock in the morning and I hurt my wife crying in a lounge and you know you have to get up in the morning you go to work and don't want to spend to half the night fussing so I went out and said what's the matter come to beat I wasn't very understanding obviously but I said that and she said no I'm not coming to be it here it says love joy peace I don't see it I want to know why oh whoa here we are in for a long haul you know as in well look that's the attitude we should have I said Lord you said in you word this why don't that see it I confess it I believe it I want to see it you know and I said what you want me to pray for you she said yes I went on my knees and I was half asleep and I mumbled something I can't remember what I said and then just about dropped off to sleep and then she started to pray and I tell you what it wasn't her praying was the Holy Ghost praying it was words of confessing the power of God confessing the glory of God thanking him for her for everything not the way she felt it was the Holy Ghost a man I woke up in a hurry and then that spirit came down the Holy Ghost and we screamed and cried and prayed till 3:00 in the morning we went to debate we couldn't sleep it was so heavy we jumped up and down and being praising God and praising God we could sir couldn't stop and we called on the blood of the Lord and thanked him for everything next thing there was this big bang on the window we lived upstairs the window was pushed from inside open with a scratching noise like you would throw a big dog through the window she said today we'll just lift he did there was peace in that house after their why did it happen because the perservere asked why why not Lord ever done anything wrong ever done anything wrong I want to repent I want to see you work manifest in my life we have to ask why isn't it and sometimes it's such a little thing you wouldn't believe it and for me once I sit there and I lost the peace my peace I knew it's wrong I should have a peace that passes all understanding didn't heaven there's the Lord whatever done I want to repent concede that I've done anything wrong I pray for three weeks in the middle of a prayer he said my plans not your plans you know I had wonderful planes wonderful planes and look in the middle of the prayer I almost smiled I mean I probably did I said Lord well that's the only horrible thing I did you know it was a horrible thing it was my plane my ways and all his voice you know as a father sometimes you want to be looking after your family and do things you do it in your own strength I was wrong I said Lord your plants of course your planes I don't care what happens and you know he place is so rich list that peace came back in but you know ask why not what what is seek God until you know don't blame him or don't think the word is not true or I'm not his that's why he doesn't answer no it's not that there's something hindering the leadership of the Holy Ghost and you know we read all these things to know it help people so easily forfeit the leadership with the Holy Ghost for something tangible they can see and you know that looks impressive but it's not it's not just closes this one you know sometimes we can end up being sympathizers with past work of God a past work and you know brother Brown puts it this way is like his paint it's fire one day somebody really good warm and and and you know week we can say wonderful painting beautiful painter fire almost feel the heat of it you know it's so good you know and and I know the author I don't know who painted it I know that was about 27 years ago he did their painting you know but he don't get warm on that painting and you know when when Elijah is show down there all the things in place the same old does the same everything sacrifice and talk but there Gothia dances real fire escort you see and that is really really what is our portion the real fire the real Holy Ghost and I I just want encourage you tonight don't don't don't just say oh well might be my lord it's know you a lot he said I want to give you life and life more abundantly that's what he says so it's not my lot I turned on a message of a brother amid a few years ago just briefly and ease it all I've got three sons we don't follow the Lord I thought that said you know I that is said it hurts a man or a father if the sons don't follow the Lord but you know before they reject the Lord they reject the leadership of the father his hope and then you know you cannot reject the family and those rejecting God God put it in place so it said it said but there's also promises and we always had Priya how we pray and we see the prayers answered we claim the things of God we claimed them because it's in the word and we believe the word and we act upon it we act upon our confession so we know just sympathizers we will actually go with it just finished with this quote here the Spirit of God can be identified by its characteristics the Spirit of God and the spirit of the church there is a church spirit and the Spirit of God that's absolutely not like the truth spirit at all there is a denominational spirit and like I said we can have it just ourselves it's another church that's faltering we can have it ourselves I know everything you know nothing you know we can have it ourselves but let's just surrender all our old ways to Jesus Christ declare him like Paul affirming that he's alive and if he is alive he knows everything our thoughts our motives our cries of our hearts he knows everything let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord is so much we can say and we can try to took place before for people but lower unless your Holy Spirit comes and makes it a reality in our lives it's just words and I just pray Lord let us all experience you to be alive in our lives even as we leave this place knowing you the Living God and and putting our lives before you Lord you know every detail of it we don't need to explain it you know everything let us all just surrender all our lives to you Lord and say lead us Lord Jesus by your Holy Spirit ask that you would do that Lord I pray that you would meet the needs of everyone here Lord there is there is always needs and we sometimes don't realize what is in need and what is there for our good and and we try to understand it but we don't but you know all things you're in heaven we are on the earth Lord you know all things and I just want to commit ourselves and our needs into your hands and ask you to undertake in a name of Jesus Christ amen amen here's the living god oh it's it's wonderful it's wonderful I just don't know how to you know I don't know when he comes sometimes he comes down and sometimes he comes down when you go home sometimes when you pray but he is the Living God and I can declare to you he is alive I've met him praise God should we sing a song together should we sing that one no not you in the temple if you're a temple of the Holy Ghost you know that that's the scripture do you know how to play no it not no you got the other people no you not know it not you are the typical no you god no you're not you are a pit bull you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost is on em yes I am and the pimple I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost full of price full of power and full of glory full of praise full of power and full of glory full of praise full of power and full of glory I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen amen [Music] you know means something the Christ lives in you you know I tell you something wonderful when God speaks you know when he speaks and you know when you fellowship you talk together about the Lord not just sympathizing with each other's problems and yeah yeah I know and you know but talk about the Lord and suddenly he speaks through one of them boys are excited and you get answers I had a brother I talked to him about how you know the Bible talks about husband wife is like church in Christ and all these things we were driving and and then suddenly saying something I never saw it before now they did here we start to rejoice and you know what is it it brought the presence of God so strong in the car when he were at home he started to confess family spirits and mother was a witch and this and the other and maybe some oppressive spirits around we prayed and cast him all out what did it fellowshipping with one another God will come on the scene and then you know when he speaks yeah absolutely absolutely it's our privilege she sing more MORE should we sing greater is He that's within me you know it or do you think that here I'm going to show what he I think it's e-flat oh no we think the other one cheese's old to Jesus for Jesus I surrender all to him amen they sing all for Jesus [Music] Jesus or 40 I am a neighbor hope to be Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] a neighborhood or by nation's hopes and plain I don't read the D into your hand oh my a turns wholesome plane during the be into your head already is only you will then I am free for it is only [Music] Oh 40 [Music] and hope to be amen amen we sing one more we're singing creating me clean create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me create in me a clean heart uber and renew a right spirit within me [Music] not away from thy praises and Holy Spirit from me restore the joy of my salvation and renew a right spirit within me amen just before we leave tonight I just would like to ask are we willing they have the Holy Ghost leading in our lives are we willing to heaven say what he wants yeah you know it's it's oh just give you one one more example you may relate to this I when I came back to New Zealand I was looking for a job I had three job offers in Rotorua and I didn't want to go into Rotorua to work I wanted to live in Tara but then after had three job offers there and none in Tauranga a pride said lord if it's your well that I'm in Rotorua I'll go to Rotorua but you know I preferred to be in tirana if it's okay for me to meet Tara please let me have a job by Wednesday then old biddy on you said to me why don't you ring a travel agent he traveled so much I said well I drink a lot of milk doesn't make me a dairy farmer you know and but then I thought well might as well throw a ring at regulation and I had an interview straightaway and they had a job by Wednesday so I was you see the Lord doesn't force you through things but he looks for willingness to do and if we are willing to surrender our lives to deliver if the Holy Ghost should we just pray together as a congregation you know should we all raise our hands to Lord Heavenly Father Almighty God you know our hearts our lives our needs our every burden that we have Lord we want to surrender it all to you we surrender our hearts and lives fresh and in the blood of Jesus Christ for a cleansing and Lord for your spirit to come in our lives to guide and lead us and Lord you want to rededicate our lives to you surrender all our wishes and desires into your hands Lord ooh you know what for us we want to have you will we want to be in a perfect will of God in Jesus Christ's name I ask that you make our hearts sensitive Lord if any one of us grief your spirit in the past forgive us for grieving your spirit and heal this and make a sensitive again to the leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord he come gentle as a dove he don't force yourself upon us Lord let us know when you move in our lives and respond and see the glory of God revealed in our own lives I just prayed a special anointing upon each one of us here that you will come and use us for the glory of God lower to to give us the assurance that we are in a perfect will of God Lord direct us and Lord if he stepped out of line we ask forgive us and we repent in the name of Jesus Christ and we say come Lord Jesus come Holy Spirit fearless leaders guide us for your glory in Jesus name I pray amen amen god bless you all it's wonderful to encourage one another you know it sometimes we can do it sometimes we can't but look what what better thing is there then just being in the will of God being led by the Lord you know I always say look even a little child who is led by the Lord brings out more wisdom and and things then then somebody who thinks they know everything if someone just obeys and is sensitive the leaders of the Holy Spirit and you know it's given to us and just remember and declare like pour believe he's alive and we declare him alive and that really helps it's always the crunch do we really believed is your life really believe is here yeah well I can see do you really believe it I I am believing praise the Lord go place you all and thank you for having me with like Priya well the Albert
