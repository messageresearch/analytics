we've ordered some more cheers as well um I believe we're making room for prodigals to come home amen God's Wayward to to find rest Amen to this house will be full amen so thank you for everyone all your hard work and prayers and labor and it was a big job but yeah thank you so much it always amazes me when we say we're going to do something everyone just is there before I even finished saying I'm going to do something you know everyone rallies around and pitches in it's amazing so God bless you all really appreciate it so much amen so let's um let's turn to the scripture this morning we're going to go to um we're going to go to uh Revelation no sorry we're gonna go to Hebrews 11 we're going to read one scripture here um Hebrews 11 and 13. to Hebrews 11 and 13 just just one one um now maybe let's just start from verse eight actually uh Hebrews 11 and 8 will read down to verse 13 here or verse 14 rather so by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place that he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so um sojourned in a Land Of Promise in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the ears uh with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker as God through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them embrace them and confess that they were Rangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country amen you may have your seats this morning may the Lord bless you also just one quick sorry um so that door that we used to take out uh to go out to the foyer please don't use that after service just take the back door and then eventually we'll get the front door I mean the back door sorted out that'll become the front door but just leave this door here for during service just go out by the sound disc that'd be really good amen so God bless you and Lord bless his word so I want to talk about here just this just the thought about being apprehended by the promises of God where it's so amazing when you look into hear this Hebrews 11 how we just read how you know they saw the promises are far off so those promises weren't close to them but they saw them afarf and they were persuaded of them they were influenced by them and they embraced them now it seems to be a strange thing to embrace something that's far away how can you lay hold of something that's actually in the distance but Faith takes you brings that promise into the present though the Fulfillment may be for even for a future generation like like like like them you know that promised land that Abraham walked upon you know it wasn't it was given to him but it was given to really his children and it was you know 400 years later you know after Abraham Isaac and Jacob then it was 400 years of of of of the children of Abraham being in being in Egypt then they actually came out finally and possessed a land so so the promise wasn't actually to Abraham it was to his children but though he but but he saw the promise of far off and and and it persuaded him you know it actually talked him into it you know it actually convinced us how it actually made his mind thinking a little bit you know differently that actually you know you know you changed his way of thinking it actually you know persuaded him in such a way amen that that that it would actually cause him to actually yield or obey it I made some promises of God we know are more than just nice things to put on Instagram we'll put on the fridge but actually the promises of God are God himself because God in his word you cannot divide your Gardener's word are not two separate things they are the same person just like the Centurion wood would um come to come to Jesus and he'd say my my servant is grievously uh sick you know very very unwell and Jesus said well I'll go pray for them and he said no I'm not worthy that you come under my roof you know I'm I'm a man of authority you know I call people to come here and do this and they come and they obey he said just speak the word only and and my servant shall be made whole so so that Centurion that Gentile had a revelation that God and His word were the same person and by Jesus saying that he's made well was exactly the same as Jesus physically walking through his front door going to the bedroom wherever the servant was laying his hands upon Him praying for him and he got well him speaking the promise was exactly the same as he himself walking into that room and healing him as the same thing with the promises of God today we have to believe amen that his promises are the same as him and him speaking the promise is the same as him coming and fulfilling the promise just like Jesus going and healing the Centurion amen so we're going to realize that we're not far from God you know some people get the idea in their mind the devil puts it in their mind you're far away from God we are not far away from God you see because Faith confesses what God has done for us amen see see unbelief so unbelief is is confessing what the devil says faith is confessing what God has done what he says amen so the Bible tells us that we were once far off I'll just try and find it in my notes here um well let's just go to Ephesians chapter two I know it's there amen um uh we're gonna go to Ephesians chapter 2 and then the latter part of that uh let's but let's just read this together because if we could really look into the scripture and say what does it say about you and I and it's irrespective of condition how you're feeling how your week's going how your family is your bank account whatever variable you want to put as an excuse It's irrespective of those things I mean what God has done if we start confessing what God has already done for us not what he will do but what he has done amen then then it'll give us a real Victory you know I was thinking you know we've got a better room to dance in this church now hello you know when we're building this thing we can dance in this place now we have room Hallelujah I mean to fully Express how we feel on the inside Amen to express really What the Lord Has Done For Us amen praise God so Hallelujah let's keep amen here we are so so second um so Ephesians chapter 2 will start from verse 14. now make this personal make it make it personal because because Paul's writing to you he's not writing just to the Ephesians he's writing to you amen because every every scripture is is personal right amen well some aren't because some are Promises to the devil don't take those ones take the ones that are for you right amen for he is our peace he's my peace amen who have made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us so he's taken down the wall I mean there are some walls broken down in this place where we had to walk around the long way you couldn't see what was on the other side but those walls just got busted down I'll lose the same thing with God by his blood he's busted down the wall of sin amen I press I'm glad our God is in the demolition business Hallelujah he just takes his D9 bulldozer and just goes to your Tin Can Alley of sin bulldozes it down puts up a great a great you know Mansion of his glory and it's on Hallelujah Highway and you're just rejoicing in the presence of God hallelujah amen having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to making himself of Twain one new man so making peace he's a peacemaker uh that he might reconcile both unto God uh in in one body both the cross having I mean sorry in one body by the cross having slam the enmity thereby and come and preach peace to you which were far off and to them that deny for through whom we have both one access by one Spirit unto God the Father I mean if he's not far away he's not far away yeah let's just say the Lord's close the Lord's here his spirit's here right now he's not far away somewhere amen his his cell phone towers don't get overloaded with with calls right the line's always open he's not far from you amen he's closer than your next breath Hallelujah he's head of a fellow's word but you've got to believe he's here to fulfill his word for you amen remember his promises remember we don't serve a god of History we don't have a his you know this is not a historian place if you've come to learn history you've come to the wrong building Victoria University is maybe that way somewhere and there's a history Department you can go there if you want to learn history but we're here to see that God is alive today he's The Great I Am amen he's not the I was he is the I am I mean he's here to fulfill his word but we've got to see now if they were persuaded by promises that were afar off and they embrace them but the promise wasn't for them was for their children now how much more you and I who are at the end of all the ages where all the promises that God are in fulfillment right now amen we're not standing it would have been amazing to stand there and be with the Apostle Paul he'll begin to speak of future events of the Rapture cycle and you know we shall not all sleep and we shall be changed into you know come under the influence of that word as it was released to the earth and the excitement that it would have generated but you know that was for two thousand years down the road I mean you know we know that the dead in Christ they'll rise first they actually have a greater a greater part than us would travel alive and Reign right but the thing is now those promises were for this day they weren't just for that day because they weren't alive and remain they had to die you know in the faith waiting for us to come to our position in the end time amen so you know but you think about the excitement when Paul would write that to the Thessalonians and no doubt the excitement were building you know they'd have a jubilee uh they'd have a praise break and begin to Rejoice because thinking this is us that he's talking about but you know God withheld from the church it actually be 2 000 years when finally that scripture would come into fulfillment and now here we are so the promise isn't afar off and it's been embraced now the promises here and we embrace it amen we're actually actually the promises here who's with me you understand what I'm saying the promise is not years down the road it is right now I mean you think about the the the incredible season that we're alive because I believe every True Believer that's actually had a taste of the other land where God has has met them in some form you know touched their hearts changed their lives it throws them into expectation that they're going to step into heaven one day they're under expectation the Lord is going to come and take them away amen there's a Heavenly land that they're going to you know I'm so thankful the heaven that we talk about is not just an idea it's not just an ethical moral kind of nice kind of place it's a real place it's not man devised ideas but Heaven is a real place just like this is a real place there's a really a land beyond the river amen and that's sweet forever that only by faith will get there by faith to cream amen but I believe that there is a heaven we're going to and I believe if we really focus on where we're going uh I think it'll change our Earthly walk we won't become like a bunch of useless monks that only just uh staring into the you know infinite but will actually be more a blessing upon the Earth if we focus on where we're going I mean because the more we focus on where we're going the more that land will influence us and we know Heaven consists of the word of God anymore the word will will will influence us and then we'll be a better blessing to our families to our communities to our schools to our jobs wherever we are upon the Earth will be a greater blessing to everyone amen because they said that they were and they confessed so when they saw the promise of far off they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth Hallelujah so so when the promises of God are revealed when God reveals himself this is it it throws us into this condition that we confess we're just passing through this is not our ending this is not our destination this is just a stop like you catch the train it says next stop this station next stop this station but finally you come to the place where you get off amen we don't get off here we can get off here hallelujah sure you get more excited as you get closer to the different train stations you're more alert you're gonna be asleep when you get on but when you hear you know the next Stop's melling or next stops wherever you begin to wake up because you don't realize I've got to get off here I've got to get off this train you know it's the same thing we've we've come through seven seven stations you know if it's a Simona pergamist satire or Philadelphia ladio Syria now we're here in the bright age rights who have come through seven stops now we're in the Rapture age Hallelujah so now we're beginning to perk up we're here we have arrived Hallelujah you may be in asleep as the scenery went past but you're here amen I believe the law the chief conductor saying the next stop is Glory Hallelujah I trust you're excited for that one that's a real good one that's the best stop Hallelujah and that's where we're going so I trust that I trust when the law gets a hold of your life it's throwing you into this condition where you confess you're just a stranger and Pilgrim on the Earth we're just passing through Hallelujah this is the season where all the prayers of the Saints will be answered as it would say in Revelations 5 you can turn with me there if you want to Revelations 5 and verse 5 to 10 where where this is the scene where John is is caught up we know that the first um so at the end of Revelations chapter 3 which is the end of our church age God describing the season we're in I mean it says then I Heard a Voice in heaven in that same voice that spoke to me was there in the open door and is lifted up into the eternal and so now John sees the um sees the throne room of God Revelations four and five then there comes a season now when when the lamb himself comes and takes the book where he takes everything that Adam lost now and he takes it back into his hands because as a man lost it in the garden so a man had to redeem it back so our great Creator became Our Savior amen God became man to redeem us back to himself because no man could pay the price in their own self we're all born and sin we're all born lost we're all born in prison we can't get out ourselves no matter how good we think we are we can't escape amen but that's why someone had to come from the other side of the fence Hallelujah and he and he didn't burrow under the fence he busted through the fence he said this is a jailbreak amen doesn't matter how many guards the devil tried to put in his way unbelief doesn't stop our God all the scribes and the Pharisees the herodians all the political nonsense going on that day it didn't stop God he busted through the fence purchased our Salvation said children run through this way amen repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy goes what's that that's your jailbreak Hallelujah hey man it's just um and so one of the elders saith under me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book in the loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne in the and and of the four beasts in the midst the Elder stood a lamb it had been slammed now we know this is all symbolic right and there's all the book of symbols having seven horns and seven uh seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb every one of them uh and every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayer of prayers of saints so these prayers have been contained down Through the Ages they've been lifted up before God even we read in uh Genesis chapter five you're the genealogy of Adam that says that their man began to call upon the name of the Lord because Adam no doubt would have Adam and Eve would have relayed what I was like to be in in the garden to be in perfection no sin no trouble no sickness no bad days no pulled muscles no soreness you know it's amazing this is you think how incredible the fall was the first thing that made Adam ever fear was hearing the voice of God after the fall you know fear you know any any emotion that comes through our body is a chemical reaction different different chemicals are released that makes us feel love or or or or um or the pre you know sadness or fear whatever it is as different chemicals are released and the first time he ever felt fear was when God came down the call of the evening to her fellowship with them this is after the fall they hid themselves because I heard the voice of God walking in the garden that's the first do you think about before the fall they just would have had I believe just a joy Here Comes father we've had such a great day in this paradise that he made us and now we get to spend more time with him Hallelujah but then there came a time because of the fall when they heard that same voice speaking and they got afraid they were actually in fear we you know to me it's incredible thing how people at Fallen man is afraid of the voice of God man is actually afraid of the supernatural of God even when the disciples were out on the water they were rowing because the wind was contrary basically the wind was coming head onto them they were wrong trying to get somewhere and Jesus came walking the Fourth Watch of the night which is just before Dawn so just before Dawn Jesus comes walking on the water they've been rowing all night and they get afraid of the very one that's come to save them they're afraid of him because they misunderstand who he really is he says be of a good cheer it's I and then the fear left and when they realized who it was it's the same thing with you and I we should not be afraid of God we should not hide away put up a wall lift up the drawbridge you know in our hearts we should always be open say Lord you're here not to destroy us but to redeem us your head affects me here to change me you hit it stabilize my life and you're here to give me peace in my heart you know that's is that how you feel when you think about the law that he yeah he's come to do good things he hasn't come to do bad things to us amen he loves us he's our loving father Hallelujah so so these these golden vials full of Voters which are the prayers of saints these prayers could not be answered till this day when the lamb would take the book because there was an expectation there's a prayer Lord when are you going to come Lord come quickly Lord but it was locked into a Time season because guiding you on his calendar when he was going to take the book when he's going to release the revelation of it to the seventh angel and it's going to be given to us we will come with it one with it we prophesy again that was this season that it would happen so these prayers that have been prayed all the way down through the ages of the Rapture and the translation of the Saints and walking on streets of gold they were all held until this season that's why they saw the promise it was afar off right they are persuaded of it but now the promise is not far off it's right now amen so every every answer that has been waiting for an answer is here now that's why I say we've made room for protocols we're going to get more chairs you know the more people are going to come and meet the Lord and you know God's going to move in a greater way there's going to be the power of God I believe we're literally going to dance around this church and God's going to move in this place maybe not today maybe next service I don't know why not now though and we'll dance around this place amen and change will fall off Liberty Bells will ring the Holy Ghost will fall uh that's what I'm I'm expecting and I'm believing Hallelujah that we could have a Sunday night at camp and a Sunday morning you know at church Hallelujah because our God can do anything amen but you feel the move of the spirit just move with him Hallelujah you say no one's dancing with me he's actually invited you to dance amen so you know but I believe we're in the season where every prayer is going to be answered I believe it's now not in the future one day no no no you know it's like but yo yo Believers are in such a way it's very easy to believe for the future but what about the now you know Martha would would you know your Martha Mary that Barry Lazarus and you know Jesus was four days late we know he's in the Tomb four days and uh you know Jesus came at his appointed time and it wasn't Mary that ran out to meet him it was Martha and so you know Jesus would speak to her and you know uh Martha would say you know I know my brother will raise him the last day I know he will I have an assurance basically Martha's saying to the Lord you know Lazarus was a Believer I knew he's a Believer he's going to rise he is a real Christian but then Jesus said to her but I am the resurrection and the life so so he's trying to get hurt not to just look at the last day look at today so it's not I will be the resurrection of the life no I am I am the resurrection of life either believeth me though he were dead yet shall he live and who whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou thus she said unto him yea Lord I believe Thou Art the Christ the son of God which has come into the world Martha believed but her faith was for an event in the future but the Lord brought her faith into the present and I believe that's what the Lord wants us to do that not just to look into the future for the promises of God to be fulfilled but to bring them into the now because I am right now the Resurrection the life he is I am the one who keeps my word I am the one that fulfills my word I am the one who's here to fulfill which I have promised unto thee amen you may think it's tarried for a long time but I believe this is the season amen where every Divine promise that God will be fulfilled Hallelujah amen this is this is the hour I mean so we can we can Rejoice amen because we're not here looking afar off the promises are here that's exciting don't you think it's exciting Hallelujah amen praise the Lord now if we look into if we go to um Philippians and Philippians chapter 3 because I want to talk about now everyone oh let's just read this and we'll go into this a bit here so um Philippians 3 and verse um verse 12 to 16. because the Apostle Paul you know I I Marvel at his life and what he did and how the things he had to overcome and just his walk with God it's amazing how the Lord said I'm going to make him an example to the world and so Philippians 3 and verse 12 do we do we have that or no but it's fine so it says here and not as though I had already obtained neither already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that which is which also I'm apprehended of Christ Jesus so the Apostle Paul is saying I haven't made it he knew he had eternal life okay so so when he's talking about perfection he's not saying well I need to be sinlessly perfect I'm getting there he's not talking about that being being perfect in the scripture has has two meanings depends what it's being talked about one is a sinless Perfection by the blood of Jesus Christ whoever made sinlessly perfect so who's perfect today by his blood right but but the another meaning for perfect it means a full maturity so who's fully mature in the Lord someone's quick off the trigger but they kind of put the safety back on right there you see you see we are growing right we are maturing we're becoming more like him every day as we look into his word we hear the message we pray we become more like him all the time and we should never think we have made it we know we've made it when these bodies have changed that's what we know we have arrived but until we get to that point we are still growing we're still pressing the mark of the High Calling we're still dying out saying Lord make me more like you take all my Humanity away there wouldn't be me living but you living in me Lord amen so this is what the Apostle Paul was saying here he says that uh it's not as though I have already attained so so I'm not ready yet I'm not fully mature I'm growing now when we think of maturity we're going to look at through through God's eyes because whatever he thinks is maturity is maturity but we'll all get there and then the body change will happen but don't beat yourself up if you're his workmanship you're going to get there if you're your own workmanship well you better just be born again and meet God and let him change you right because it's not us trying to fix ourselves or us being the Christian he must become the Christian in our lives amen then he grows and you know he becomes like us so so let's just let the Lord take us that we can uh become perfect in a in a sense of a full maturity as well as a sinless Perfection I mean which is blood has already done for us but the Apostle Paul said that I wanna he says I want to apprehend that which I am also apprehended of Christ Jesus it says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do now let's just stop in the middle of that scripture you think about the Apostle Paul he had the greatest revelation of the age being the prophet messenger for the Ephesian Church age you know he was caught up into the third heaven he was taken beyond the curtain of time you know he saw he would he would go meet the original Apostles and and he says they didn't add anything to what I believe he said that in the scripture he had the he had the revelation of the age but he's saying now I'm still I don't count myself to have apprehended so he was so he wanted to so the Lord on the road to Damascus apprehended him by the pillar of fire there got a hold of his life he was never the same from that moment on so the Lord got a hold of his life before that he is apprehended by being a Pharisee his own ambition was had had apprehended him and it's amazing you know we're all apprehended by something now the word apprehend it means like if you arrest someone for a crime you've been apprehended you're in cuffs you're a prisoner you've been you know you don't have your own will doesn't control what you do anymore you've been you've been taken prisoner and so the Apostle Paul before he came to the Lord he was apprehended by being a Pharisee of the Pharisees it's amazing how the devil will take our own human Fallen ambition and then drive that to to to make us be something we think is great you know you know we even look at this age so in the negative sense I want to go through negative apprehension first you know being apprehended a negative sense programs comes to the positives because the Apostle Paul was you could say he was apprehended in a very negative way he was apprehended by being a Pharisee by that religious spirit in such a way he even persecuted Christians the very reason he was going to Damascus is because he wanted to lock up Believers and he thought he's trying to he thought he's doing God a service but he was actually fighting as a very God he thought he was believing him and so he was apprehended and he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees is trying to make himself great within the organization and this age is such an age of self you know we can be people can be apprehended by by their own ego you know this age is such an age of self self-improvement self-help selfies it's all the me generation you know it's the i i everything I life you know it's all about yourself this is this is the age of self people want to uh apprehended by their own ego or their own looks or what they think they are and you know the whole reason that social media influences are so powerfully influential in this day is because they project themselves and they cause those who follow them to enter into parasocial relationships now a parasocial relationship Mr Google told me is is they are one-sided relationships which one person extends the emotional energy the interest and the time and the other party the Persona is completely unaware of the other's existence so it's not the influencer that that extends their emotional energy their interest in their time it's those who are watching all their you know on Instagram and their photos and their videos on YouTube different things caught up in what they're doing they're the ones who extend their emotional energy but what's going to happen when you pour your emotional energy into something that can't actually reciprocate it back this is why this world has had such a mental health problem and in my opinion people are investing into relationships that cannot actually give it back in kind and they become empty and they become depressed what's happening it's it's people are caught up apprehended by that influencer and their life and what they do and the person always makes a video like they're interested in the viewer and they don't know you from a hill of beans you can be living next door no probably not if they're in a multi-million mansion in California somewhere but if they were Joe everyone blogging you could be living right next to them they wouldn't know you I'm sorry they wouldn't say I'm so glad you liked my video no if they do respond they've got a team of people in the background responding for them but people you know invest all their emotional energy and interest and time and it's and and it's just like pouring yourself into a black hole it doesn't it doesn't actually give you any benefit it just consumes you what's happened people become apprehended they can dress like their influencer talk like them act like them even go to the same places as them but yet it's just an empty relationship our lord Jesus is not a social media influencer he invested his time his emotional energy his love his concern his care down Through the Ages he's always cared for his children he's he's had a burden for this Earth he's not indifferent to what's going on in the world he's not indifferent to what's going on in your life he cares about what's going on in your life it may be it may be such a small thing he cares about it he's interested in it Hallelujah I'm so glad we serve a God Like That amen that we can you know we can we can come to a God who actually cares about us no if people get caught up in their own ego they're apprehended by themselves we don't want to be apprehended by ourselves we're going to be apprehended by the word of God Amen that he would lead us so when the Holy Ghost comes brother Ram says it it takes wanting to be a big shot out of you it'll take it out of you it'll humble you when you do that that's why the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's what makes you quick gossiping makes you quit playing cards you know drinking smoking doing other things all around the corner see it but it takes that big shot ego desire out of your life when that comes you don't want to be the big one you want him to be the big one you want him to be the center of the life you want to be him to be the center of attention where people may you don't care if you're a member you want him to be known amen hallelujah so the Apostle Paul so that's all in the negative and you could go and list people are apprehended by their job by their Hobbies by their you know even their family by their houses by their by their material things people are apprehended by those things but that's all in the negative let's not focus on the negative let's look at the positive right amen so the Apostle Paul was he says I want to apprehend that which has apprehended me so the Lord got a hold of him but he wanted to reach back and get a hold of the one that got a hold of him so he now spent his whole life trying to apprehend the same God that apprehended him amen and and that being the focus of his life he he he got a what brother Bank calls a christ-centered life so the word was the center of his life the Lord was everything to him because his main focus was I want to get a hold of this one this great God that I thought I knew when I was a Pharisee this God that I thought I knew when I started him out was standing give lectures and people would applaud me and clapped me on the back and great Pharisee teachers say Well done the Apostle well that's all he did so good there and I've never seen that before you know he thought he knew him but he didn't know him at all and then God would would get a hold of him on the road to Damascus and he had such a desire I want to get a hold of this Lord I want to know you more Lord I want to I want to know the depths of your heart I want to know what's on your mind I want to know what you how you feel and I'm going to know what you think about us and what you think of me and you know he had such that long and do you have that kind of a longing amen Lord I want to know you more I don't just want to memorize scripture and quotes I want to I want to Anchor into my heart I want to know you I want to walk with you I want to experience you I want to understand the heart of your word not just the letter of it but your heart that's in your word and what you're trying to tell me Lauren Hallelujah he would be apprehended and yet he would come to a place where he says nothing moves me shipwrecks didn't move him he was apprehended remember the the biggest influence in your life is what has apprehended you see we're all sitting here saying well we're all Christians and praise the Lord but but really the main thing in your life is what has apprehended you see there see there's a lot of things that tried to apprehend the Apostle Paul he had to run from Damascus being lowered over the wall with a basket run for his life that that trauma could have apprehended him but it didn't apprehend him he was thrown into prison that could have apprehended him it didn't apprehend him here's Earth Paul and Silas and the inner present now that could have because he could have got to a point I'm just not going to preach anymore I'm just not going to put myself In Harm's Way anymore if God is God and he's so great why do I have to go through these things no he was apprehended by the word amen so so the so prison didn't apprehend him Stripes to apprehend him shipwrecks didn't apprehend him when when when he survived that shipwreck well God told him what would happen you know the ship was lost all the people are saved and you know he goes up on the bank he's collecting firewood and and that and that snake bit him in the hand that didn't apprehend him he shook it off because he said no what's apprehended me is the Angel of the Lord has told me I have to go to Rome hey man I have to go preach in Rome and we've got to realize we've been apprehended by a promise amen we're going in a Rapture Hallelujah so he just shook it off amen that thing that bit him I mean just like a malice or a bad experience or gospel pain just shake it off in the fire Shake It Off in the fire of God's word don't don't let it bite you and let the poison go through and flood your mind with negative thinking and this one does this and this trouble another Shake It Off in the fire and watch it burn up Hallelujah because he knew he had to go to Rome amen shipwrecks Stripes betrayal trouble in the church he says he fought the beast at Ephesus he wasn't fighting lions tigers and bears oh mine right no that was demon Spirits religious Spirits within the church those things didn't apprehend to me that they did not derail his walk he says I have kept the faith I have you know I afford a good fight I've kept the faith why because it's because for me there's a crown and and that Crown of Life I mean is for all those not only me but all those that love his glorious appearing why because he is so apprehended he realized life is more than this life is more than God coming down I even say this life is even more than God coming down now I hope this comes out right and and blessing us in church Heaven is more real than this you know science if you look at the wavelength wavelength right visible light's a very small part of the spectrum we can only see a small part of the created world even this telescope the James Webb Telescope that was built it's an infrared telescope it can see far beyond the Hubble telescope so it looks in in a in a wavelength we can't even see and and it's actually shown there's more of the universe that man has ever seen before it's all it's been there the whole time but they've only just developed the technology to build the thing and set it into the space and put it out there that they can see what they've been seeing you know they're they're they're they're way behind behind schedule I mean we're about a profit come in the state and look from eternity to Eternity and that same same anointing on the prophet has come unto you and you can see that I come from God and I'm going back to God I'm just in this hickey of time but when time is no more I shall still be Hallelujah so we can see far beyond what man can see Hallelujah but it just goes to show this far more to the world that man can see with the natural eyes people say well when I see it I'll believe it no saying is not believing I mean believing as Revelation believing is actually taking it in faith before you feel it you see it you taste it you smell it you think it whatever you you choose to accept the word by faith before what the five senses declare him hey man so if you're not well today you're going through trouble choose to take the word above how you're feeling choose the word above your conscious and you're raising your imagination take the word above all those things amen then it can actually come it can come your eyes listening to brother Bradham uh yesterday and you're saying about how people will will just you know he gets thousands of letters after a meeting and people just just in the congregation maybe they are blind or in a wheelchair whatever more and they heard what was being preached he says I just can't pray for everyone and and you say you know I can hear your people hear the word and then like a week later they'll be they'll be thinking on what they heard in the service and they'll just get out of the wheelchair other eyes will come open God will supernaturally touch them why because the word came into their hearts but then they began to think about the promise and then God always comes to his word but you want God to come into your life think on the word receive the word into your life and God will come and Quicken that word you take the opposite the scrubs and Pharisees see see the same word that was spoken to the woman at the well spoken to them the same word that was spoken to the man who was born blind with no eyeballs was spoken to them right but they did not think on the Promises in a positive way they just took it and said he's Beelzebub versus a cult have nothing to do with this guy this is wrong he didn't come according to our schools if he is really the Messiah he'd come to Caiaphas as the high priest and you know this is wrong and blah blah blah blah didn't do them any good no no but unbelief did not hinder God but those who thought on the promise those who begin to think about it amen God came and confirmed the word praise the Lord and you know we are we are built exactly the same way that's why it's so important to think on the Promises of God I probably say at every service but maybe I'll just keep repeating it think on the Promises of God whatsoever things are good and true and honest and of a good report and have virtue think on those things I mean do not think on negative things negative thinking has helped no one positive thinking has helped everyone even in even in the great sporting Arena you know when coaches great coaches can get their team to believe that they are champions amen if a Coach has ever you know made a successful team they have actually put put it in the hearts of the team you can win you can do this you're not in this tournament just to participate you're here to pick the trophy up and that and they instill that in their team and they may be the worst team on paper but there's something in them that will rise and they will win that tournament why because they they they have faith in what they're being told now that's just in the sporting Arena how much more the children of God how much more you and I this morning amen where the word has said you are made in my image I've washed you in my blood I mean you're more than conquerors through him that loved you amen the Lord Jesus Christ is your Advocate he's working on your behalf his promise is a true this is not Pie in the Sky ideas it's reality but don't let your mind wander come back to where I am hello everyone are we here amen think on good things don't think on negative things you think on his word the Lord will come and confirm the word in your life Hallelujah now so the Apostle Paul was apprehended by eternity and that's what made him live the life he lived he was apprehended he had a lot of trauma in his life he had a lot of hardship but after he met he had a way higher life after he became a Christian than before you know maybe the hardest thing he had in his life before was was stressing swatting for exams and what he's going to say when he gives a lecture but then sloth was turned upside down but God ordained it that way because God was using him as a pattern because there's a portion of suffering allotted to the church I'm glad there's no I said Hallelujah because no one wants those guy thinks but remember we would know him in the resurrection and the likeness office suffering so Christianity is actually more of a rugged life but we've got to realize we're not Christians just for the fun of it there's more to it than just what what meets the eye oh you just have a church you're a Christian there's there's more than that amen if you've really met God you know there's a lamb beyond the river you're going to amen you've been apprehended by eternity Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at people have been apprehended out of their own free will they haven't been tricked into it they haven't been uh whatever into it beaten into it you know there used to be back in the day back in the um you know the uh British Navy days where they had cannons and sailboats and things like that they had press gangs we're going to taverns and ports and things and they'll basically find drunk men hit them on the head and those men would wake up on the ship they're now in the Navy they had press gangs this is not how this works this is not a press ganging place you don't get hit on the head by the Bible and you wake up and you well I have to be a Christian no that's not how this works we sign up at our own free moral will no one forced me to be a believer Hallelujah I chose because I saw how great he is and what he's done for me hallelujah it's out of love and thankfulness we are believers amen because he's done so much for us Hallelujah Amen brother Brown would tell a story he would he would he would relate it in a few different ways where he'd speak um speak about how there was a there's a young young lady or um there and she was in Italy and she was she was there to learn how to do fine art and she was there for a couple of years and there was a caretaker that would be looking after the dorms in the school of where she was and you know um he would he would notice that that she did not hang out with the rest of the Americans who came because they just came and they've been University students they just painted up large but but she didn't do that kind of thing and she'd always look a certain time of night she'd look and go look out at the Moon and um or look at the Sun and you know and and so this caretaker said you know I want to ask you a question you know you know you know if you don't mind and and and um she would say yeah sure you could ask me and and he said you know why is it you don't hang out with the rest of the students that you came with from America why don't you drink up and why don't you party and things and why are you always looking at the moon and all these cars you know you look like you're the starry look in your eyes and why is this and she said well on the other side of the sea my sweetheart's there and and and I'm going to be here for a few more months my my my my art degree is nearly done and and he's building a house for us back home and we promised one to another we're gonna live true and then one day I'm going to get on a boat or a plane and I'm gonna go home I'm gonna get married so so she would say you know in a certain state of America in a certain city in a certain town on a certain Street there's a certain young man that I fell in love with and we and that's all I can think about is him that's why I live like this and you know I'm a Christian of different things you know we can be the same kind of way there's a certain heaven and in that certain Heaven there's a there's a certain Jesus who came to came from glory to Earth purchased our Salvation washed all our sins away put his love in our hearts amen that we can look up and say it now on a certain date I don't know when but it's going to be soon he's going to come from that certain Heaven he's going to come and catch me away and we're going to go up into glory and be there for eternity that's why we live the way we live Hallelujah you know it's so good if we could just look up and you know we can we can look to where we're going I think it'll just refocus Our Lives I think all the all the nonsense and stuff will just kind of Fritter away amen amen praise the Lord Brother Bible says in here and recognizing acting on the word of God he said he said but the sea will be quiet there brother speaking of um over in eternity he says just across the Sea Under there's a certain place called Heaven there's a certain one called Jesus in this heaven and one day he took all took away all my sins and I promise him I live true to him I do the things that he wanted me to do that's the reason I'm not ashamed of this gospel it's the power of God unto salvation that's what makes me a that's what makes a Christian live different he is different because he's got something to live different for I mean we've got something different to live for it's not just being a what what what the world would say religious or a Christian but it's eternal life hey man where where we can see and you know even even these last few years we've seen God become more real Among Us his spirit's moving in a greater way he goes promises are becoming more alive you know he's pouring out his Spirit more and more you know our camp minis are getting better I believe our church services are getting better you know the word is getting richer what's that heaven is coming down amen Time and Eternity are blending together in a greater way you know we're lining up with the word like never before but you'll have realized more and more that we're not just Sinners safe by Grace I remember we are the elected seed of God Amen we came from him and we go back to him and he cannot lose a part of himself that's one thing God cannot do is he cannot lose a part of himself and we're going to realize that we're part of him that's why he called you that's why he loves you that's why he died for you it's because you're a part of him maybe but as a spirit is pouring out more and more Hallelujah who feels that way God is moving in a greater way because he's wanting us to realize we are we are closer than ever before to crossing over we are closer than ever before seeing the dead in Christ race you know seems to be there's more over there than there is here and there's more dead in Christ over there waiting amen Hallelujah but they're waiting for us to finish this race finish our course amen but you know if we could just catch a glimpse I believe we could just look beyond the curtain of time it would just it would just calm all our fears it would take away all worry it would take away all sorrow it would take away all questions if we could just look past the curtain of time and even brother Brown when he gave the account of when he was taken past the curtain of time he's in a real body he was young against her all the redeemed you know he would sing that song let me look past a good time even praise in that song Lord let them look past the curtain of time and you know the Lord actually lets us look past a curtain a Time yes owl I've never I've never seen a curtain move and then there's eternity well then how does he do it well this eternity comes down you feel its impact you feel its presence you feel his presence what's that that's that's eternity reaching in and getting a hold of your heart and speaking to you and touching your spirit and saying it's okay it's okay you're gonna get there you're part of me I want to remind you once again amen that there is a heaven to go to there's a real Jesus that's going to come we're going to physically meet him in the air that's what Believers believe Amen to the presence we feel here will be multiplied a billion times in Rupp and Glory but it's Heaven reaching down into darkness into this age to get a hold of you and say look there's a land beyond the river for you amen and you're not going to make it haphazardly I've made a way for you to get there by my blood by the cross amen I have made a way for you to get into Glory hallelujah amen Faith you you think about these things it just to me it just makes me feel I know faith is not a feeling but it just gives me such a feeling of assurance and it makes my faith I feel rise when you think about how we were not looking for God but God was looking for you and I amen because you had a place in that land beyond the river he says I can't leave that place vacant I'm not getting 70 a pass Mark is not a pass in God's books it's a hundred percent fifty percent is not a past Market 50 well I got 50 of my children here I'm happy no that's a hundred percent it's it's it's all or nothing like he'd tell the parable of the of the Shepherd that lost the other one sheep went Australia the 99 were there you think 99 sheep are good well I've still got 99 of my flock you know one sure there's losses you know you know statistically during the year and blah blah blah blah but no a real Shepherd is not satisfied when one is lost he wants the whole hundred there he wants the full hundred there and it's the same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ he wants a full hundred percent of his children that's why he comes service after service touches our hearts speaks to our lives we just opened the Bible during the week and it just blesses us we pray so thank you Lord his presence comes down and what's that because he's reminding you there's a lamb beyond the river now the devil wants to put a big concrete bunker over us and tell us it's not real and God's not there and God doesn't care and if God was real why did all these things happen in your life and all these questions and things that doesn't change see that's the devil trying to overshadow you to keep you from the promise of God but if you can look Beyond because remember it may be cloudy I don't know what it's doing outside but remember it doesn't matter how stormy the world gets there's always the sun shining somewhere amen but just he's going to change atmospheres from the Earthly up into the Heavenly you'll see the sun shining sure is the world Amen you can see your you know NASA will give images and videos of great hurricanes moving on the earth they're not caught up in those winds they're way up in space actually those storms can't get to them they're well above the storm the storm can't physically get to the space station Hallelujah they just watch it on the earth they're far above that storm that's the same thing with the believer we can be lifted up in the spiritual realm we may be on the Earth but spiritually we're in Heavenly places amen there may be a hurricane coming through but we can just be as calm as calm can be you know I remember the first storm I was ever in um was in um was it American Samoa there's a cyclone coming and and it was going to flatten it was going to go right over the island thankfully it just went around the South Coast but where we were living I think I related this I know when but you know where we're living it was like lava rock there's about this much soil and and so what happened is this this hurricane came through or this Cyclone whatever it's called and and I've never seen so much water in the air with the rain and the wind so much noise it never heard it in my life and Big Trees big massive trees you think would never fall they all went over the root system was like as half the size of this room the whole thing just fell over the only thing left left up was a coconut tree coconut trees because they can flex and so the next morning after this thing went through thankfully we didn't lose the roof but a few people left roofs um lost roofs and then it was such a weird look like there's a kind of a small Valley here on the side of Stokes Valley and if you can imagine that that that there is like one side of that Valley's been like ripped up with a with like a big weed eater someone's just got and just weeded the whole like like all the trees are just Twigs the other side is is like it's never been touched and that was like all around the island like that total devastation powers out water was that all those things and then so now we had to we had to men I think my brother where these blunt machetes and we had to like cut through all the all the Fallen trees so my dad could get on his motorbike and go see if the factory he worked at was still there and so so this is the next day after the storms come through it's still blowing gusts it's still blowing a gale and coconuts are heavier and they're all up there still and these trees are Swang like this with the Gus and we're cutting we're cutting through you know these these Fallen trees with these blunt machetes and I didn't know the Lord then so here I am singing all the hymns that I heard it at you know the chapel at school where because if that thing hits me I'm not here I'm gone I'm gone thankfully while I'm here but you know I was afraid in the storm because I didn't because I didn't know him who was greater than the storm right but then now now there's not a storm but then when Chris and I were living in Christchurch when the first first earthquake struck you know we we somehow got out of bed and it was like the vile like the like the earthquake was like violent this way and this way and you know we got down by our front door and we started praying and the place is still shaking and the prince of God just fell down and we were shouting and rejoicing Hallelujah no fear and it's not something you generate there was just no fear why because because the one greater than the earthquake was there and I believe it was a storm I wouldn't have fear as well why because the one greater than the storm is in you that's why I can say you can be living on the earth in a storm but if you're in Heavenly places in him you don't need to fear anything Hallelujah Hallelujah because he's greater than those things amen praise the Lord have gone for time okay we're going to wind this up a bit amen Hallelujah you see the Apostle Paul was tired he had an absolute of the word Christ himself was as absolute and that's what the Christian needs today in this atomic age and this time of uncertainty we need something besides just an experience of joining church we need an anchor in absolute that you know because churches will fail people will fail but Christ cannot fail he is the absolute to the believer and of Christ as you're absolute you're tied to him and if he is your absolute you're tied to him then you're tied to the word a phase you're absolute I might actually leave it there but I want to ask you the question what are you apprehended by are you apprehended by your past pain failure ego self what's the thing that governs your life parasocial relationships on social media or is it the word of God we're all apprehended by something you know we can be apprehended by religion but is it the Lord Jesus Christ the word himself what are you apprehended by because what you're apprehended by you will try and apprehend people like like someone who's who's apprehended by by by like pornography or drugs or whatever it is any addiction it is that spirit's
