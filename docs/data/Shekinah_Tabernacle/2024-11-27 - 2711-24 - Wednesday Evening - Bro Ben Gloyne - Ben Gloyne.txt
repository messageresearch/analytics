bless you all great to see everyone here tonight amen as we have this prayer meeting amen you want to take your Bibles thank you brother Maron thank you musicians amen appreciate the songs tonight amen we're going to go to Psalm 23 I'm sure that um uh the Sunday School could uh read this well recite this verbatim but we're just going to read here so Psalm 23 we're going to read the whole Psalm amen how's everyone tonight everyone good praise the Lord amen that's got a Psalm of David the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointeth my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever praise God Amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight amen gracious father thank you Lord for your word it's alive it's Rich Lord It's you we praise you Lord this night we can gather we can we can uh read your word we can worship we can pray and dear God we just invite you once again to come into our midst Lord may you walk and touch every life and meet every need Lord those who couldn't be here tonight Lord be their portion too father have your way we love you so much father we commit Our Lives we commit the service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats I just want to speak on just three little words he leadth me what a beautiful statement you know how how David could could could write this and it was more than a uh sure it was an inspiration of the Lord but you know he could say as a testimony he leadth me and uh we know that the scripture says in Romans chapter 8 that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God so there's a leadership that we can enjoy and we do enjoy amen I'm looking at people where you could all say he leadth me amen he leadth me present tense he leadth me not just he has and he or he will he leadth me right now amen so you know it's amazing when you think about these just just that statement is a phenomenal statement because everyone will be Leed by something and it's leading you somewhere every every form of leadership and you think about David he was King he wasn't just uh some little guy in Israel you know he was the he was the top dog he was the he was the leader he was he had the final say but yet he said God leadth me amen so uh he he he he wanted uh you know the Lord was his leader now we all have to be led by something we know that's nothing foreign to us but you know we got to think about whoever's leading us will will lead us to a certain place as uh you know the Lord would say in Jeremiah he says for I know the thoughts I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not evil to give you an expected end now this if you think about it his thoughts towards us are before the foundation of the world he saw you rejoicing and shouting in eternity with him you know as he asked job where were you when I laid the foundation ations of the world and the morning stars and the sons of God shouted for Joy you know God was wanting job to say you were there you weren't on the ash sheep in my mind you were there and and you know that's why God sees us as well he sees us rejoicing around the throne so that's his thoughts towards us those are good thoughts he and we know God can't change his thoughts towards his CH he can't change his thoughts at all his mind is made up amen it's a good it's good amen so and and so what does this expected in for us Well to Well what he thought of us we will end up as that thought now expressed so we have a very good exped uh expected end now how do we know he's leading because you think about it because if he's a certain type of leader he's going to C he's going to lead us to certain places right so let's just go off the negative um I mean let's just go to the places he'll never lead us right because if you'll lead us one place he won't lead us to another place and if he doesn't lead us yeah so you know what I mean so he will never lead us to a place contrary to his word which is himself he cannot lead him to a lead us to a place or that is not him right he has to lead us according to his word God does not lead us in a way that frustrates his own purpose he doesn't lead us that way he will never lead you to become a bitter grumpy unthankful person he doesn't lead us that way you see the state that now when I talk about the state I don't talk about the trial or the situation you find yourself in because we got to realize we're Christians everywhere Jesus was Jesus in the synagogue on the sea in the tombs with the you know with Legion he was Jesus in Pilot's judgment Hall he was Jesus on the cross he was Jesus in Hell he was the same guy right he didn't change who he was he was the same kind of person everywhere right and that's what we to be we to be Christians wherever we are we're a Christian right on the job at school at home in church on the street whatever we should be the same person amen right so so so when I'm talking about the state you find yourself in I'm not talking about a trial you may be in I'm talking about the state of your heart right he'll never lead us into a state where we become bitter grumpy or unthankful he doesn't lead us that kind of way right he will never lead us to resent anyone amen he'll never lead us to hate anybody or group or race doesn't matter what color of the rainbow doesn't matter what state they're in he will never lead us to hate that person remember here's the Fountain of God's love here's the love of God expressed so what should the bride of Christ be the love of God expressed right so we should never have a condemnation even a thought of condemnation towards anybody we shouldn't we should love everybody hey if God loved you he can love them that's why I think if God could love me enough to save me he can love them right cuz the same love he poured out on for me he's poured out for them right amen he will never lead us to have a judgmental attitude he never leads us there no he can't that's not him you see he's not he's not uh resentful he's not grumpy he's not bitter he's not unthankful see he will never lead us there cuz that's not him right that's all contrary to his word he'll never lead us to hate anybody amen he does not lead to those places he will never lead us to be a carnal legalistic person that's not him I'm just going through the negative things let's go to we're going to go positive but let's just think about these things because you got to think about what's your current attitude amen right because because in order to be lead by him you've got to be United with him so what his heart is your heart should be now we know we're in this flesh it's not redeemed it's going to be changed all those things but we got to realize if we're walking according to the flesh we should know it right we should we should be well aware I am in the flesh very much right now and and that's not an excuse right but you should realize Lord soften my heart that I'm walking after your spirit right cuz where his spirit is there's tenderness there's love there's a peace there's a thankfulness there's a joy amen where he is right amen so he so he will not lead us to a carnal legalistic uh EXP erience he cannot lead us that way he will lead us to Green Pastures now you think about it you know there's a big difference you know I was born and raised in gbon so they have drought you know they have it gets dry there's always a worry about do we have enough water you know we had uh rain water that's what we lived off we had a b hole in case things get bad but you know in the summer time we'd have real summer up there real summer things would get dry it would be hot it'd be summer you know we thought it was cold when it was like 15° in the winter time man we thought man this is freezing anyway but you see there's a big difference when you're walking on grass that's dry it's baked like the Earth is hard it's rock because there's no there's no moisture there's no you know there's no Spirit flowing there hardness everything's dead and withered up there's no it appears to be no life so there's one thing to walk on that you hear the crunch there's no movement in the leaves there's no you know it's just everyone knows what I'm talking about right everyone knows what I'm talking about you know even the dust blows and all these things but then when you walk on green grass am mean that's well watered the the soil is soft under your feet you know it's just a it's just a nice experience to walk on that kind of a grass it's such a difference between a a withered dry kind of experience to a nice Lush experience am me so he doesn't lead us now I got to maybe I'll just put this here right now he will lead us through Dry times he will lead us through bitter experiences right through them not to them through them right he may he may lead us through hard he will lead us through hard times but he doesn't he doesn't take us to that and that's your end result right he's got thoughts towards us of Peace will come to an expected end what will be made in His image around the throne as he thought of us before the foundation of the world right so he will lead us through Dry places bitter experiences times of hardship through great trials you know as as David would say though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil now remember if there's a shadow there's a light shining somewhere right that's why like like there's Shadows down in this room because there's a light shining right not just these artificial lights but the sun is going down it casts Shadow upon the Earth so if there's a so if you walking through the valley of the shadow of death there's a light shining somewhere right and that light isn't the devil amen it's the Lord himself giving you enough light you may go through a dark time not sure but you say he leadth me amen he leadth me through those difficult times hallelujah amen so he leads us to to to Green Pastures that gives life there's life in it who's ever you know you just kind of kick over a clot of dirt there's all these earthworms kind of spring out of everywhere who's experienced that kind of thing why there's life in the soil because there's enough moisture there and you take a you take a a Christian that's really been in the spirit of God they're not dry they're not all cracked and hard and you know their hearts are soft and tender and you know you know it's just it's just cuz there's water flowing you know there's there's life it's Lush times you know why cuz the Lord has led us remember we were all dead we're all a Barren Wasteland of a desert but the Lord but then he leadth me am mean because his thought towards me wasn't a Barren dead desert amen it was a lush green Paradise am mean where people could come and sit down and be refreshed and why because remember whatever God gives us we give out remember Abraham received Isaac and he had to offer him back to God Amen so whatever moisture comes in will be given out right amen so now so so we don't you know he doesn't lead us to stay in some hard kind of experience you got to realize now you know if you're in a dry dry place you got to realize you're going through a dry place going through I'm going through a dry season you won't always be in that season don't even say well God's lead me here to stay here no I'm going through I'm going through this time cuz he leadth me right he leadth me beside the Still Waters now those Still Waters are peaceful places of rest amen it's not a place of torment and trouble and anxiety and worry and all those things no it's a place of Peace God wants us to have peace in our minds to to to have a peaceful mind to have a peaceful existence you know not that you know sure the devil will come and try and cause all kind of trouble in our lives but he wants us to be beside Still Waters God does right not beside some empty you know uh you know empty lake or you know Bracken kind of dead stagnant water that's not what it means it means still peaceful amen so there's a there's a place he leads us to now David would say restore unto me the joy of my salvation so David could say he leadth me back to the joy of my salvation and mean because remember he you know his carnal desire led him away from the leading of the great Shepherd but he realized he was far from his Shepherd so he said Lord take me back restore that to me see he never lost it but he lost the joy of his salvation and you see that's what the devil wants us to do is to lose the joy of being a Believer lose the joy of reading the word lose the joy of seeing one another be you become unth thankful become you know that kind of thing no but the Lord leads us to be what thankful full of love and appreciation praise God for all of you praise God for the blessing you are in my life he leadeth me to where his Saints are he leadth me to where the redeemed are he leadth me to that I can have real friends praise God I can have Holy Ghost filled friends that really care about me praise God he leadth me into the congregation of the Saints praise God he leadth me Amen to his revealed word amen he reveal he leadth me to where he is in this day amen he leadth me to him am hallelujah amen I'm so thankful for that amen amen because he leadth us to have a deep seat of joy in our hearts amen that transcends our situation we may be in he leadth us to that amen he leadth us to a a redemption in completeness and in Joy he leads us to that state and he wants us to stay in that state amen where where we know that we're completely redeemed that we're ready to leave it any time amen and there's a joy associated with it amen there's not a well I have to it's thank you Lord thank you Lord you found thank you you leadeth me I was leading myself one way but then you said no I'm going to lead you from this moment on and you leadth me amen he leadth me to every Divine promise he died for at Calvary he leadeth see present tense leadth me amen he leadth me to Healing Hallelujah he leadth me to Deliverance not just for me but for my family amen he leadth me to all things in Christ am mean he leadth me to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to have a you have an attitude Lord you're leading me to these things am mean you haven't just lead me one time and now I'm just walking by myself no you leadth me amen David what knew what it was like to be led in many situations amen but he but he but he said you know but you restoreth my soul Hallelujah if there's ever been a people that Souls have been restored it's you and I I mean restored us back to our original state in the in God I mean take away the darkness of sin out of our Lives amen he's He restored our soul restored us back to what we should have been in the what we were in the beginning amen restored us back to Faith again in the word of God isn't that glorious you can say I believe I believe the word he leadth me to believe all things are possible amen how did it happen well he leadth me I don't know but he leadeth me there hallelujah amen he leadth me to say yes Lord I can trust you he leadth me to that amen praise the lord we won't be too long tonight but he leadeth me amen I trust you can look at your life and say he leadeth me amen there's many all you know all the heroes of Faith could say he leadeth me amen Abraham could say he leadth me to the promised son he leadth me to a body change amen David say he leadth me to the throne but not just to the throne but to glory amen Solomon can say he leadth me to build the temple amen Elijah could say he leadth me to a chariot ride he leadth me Hallelujah he leadth me there amen Enoch and say he leadth me amen I walked with him he lead me we had a personal relationship every day I mean every day I got up said Lord what are we doing today and then there came a day where we I just walked with God and God said you want to keep walking home Hallelujah he said he leadth me I took one step Enoch and say he leadth me from this Dimension into the next and I was not because he leadth me amen he leadth me into a body change this is what he's doing friends he leadth me we going to realize we have a resurrection message we have the god of the Resurrection amen Among Us and in us not just with us but in US amen Christ send you the hope of glory he leadeth me am mean he leadth me through troubles he leadth me through trials he leadth me through misunderstandings but he leadth me through amen he leadth me through pain and hurt and bitterness he leads me through all those things he leadth me you got to realize God's leading you amen if you if your leadership you can see the leadership of the Holy Ghost in the word in your life you can say he leadth me you have full confidence he leadeth me there's not a stab in the dark kind of a I hope it works kind of deal no he leadeth me amen according to his word praise God he leadeth me he leadeth me where all things are possible why he leadeth me I trust I'm just actually going to I'm going to Su I'm just uh short and sweet but I trust you can look at your life he leadth me you say well I haven't really felt his presence much he leadeth me what called you he what's he what's he doing to lead you where to glory amen not into a tribulation into Glory he leadth me amen he leadth me into the Rapture CU he's the god of the Rapture he leadth me amen he leadth me when I don't know the way to go he leadth me to have the have a genuine Holy Ghost faith is the most valuable thing in existence have a genuine Revelation faith in your soul can't bite you can't earn it you can't think it out God just puts it in there cuz why does he why do you say well he leadth me because he wants to lead you he wants to have a closer relationship he wants he wants like David David you know God was very intimate with David he wasn't a concept he wasn't an idea as a personal God he says as the heart paned for the water Brook so my soul longs after thee he wanted Lord lead me more than you've ever done in my life Lord lead me more than you have in the past I thank you for all you've done in the past but Lord lead me more Lord may I be more conscious of your leadership in my life even in the Small Things amen that when we when we gather around the throne maybe I'll just um I got a a quote to read but I trust it ties him but you know he leadth us there he leadth us to Crown Him king of kings and Lord of lords he leadth us there he leadth us to dwell in the New Jerusalem with them you me praise God isn't that wonderful amen he leadth us into all things in Christ amen you say well some sometimes well these bodies are so limiting you know if we really had if we could really see the Unseen World in our lives every day we'd just be walking we'd realize we're walking around in a bubble in an atmosphere of of Heaven doesn't matter where you are remember God remember we don't have to we don't have to be still in terms of nothing wrong no trouble and God comes in you in certain circumstances God's with you always God was with Moses at the burning bush God was with Moses in Pharaoh's Court God was with Moses on the Red Sea everyone's troubled and everyone's saying what are you going to do and you've led us out here to die God was in that turmoil and said speak and go forward you see it's just like with David on the back you your you in the back of the farm playing his heart God was there God was with David against Goliath and running from Saul and all the things he went through he leadth me see he had a revelation God you've led me every step of the way and you know it says in the Old Testament I've carried you like a father carries us young he's born us up he's carried us as I said on Sunday we'll come to a point we realize he was there the whole time brother Braham said do you are you conscious of the presence of God is with you everywhere you go we should be conscious of that see he'll never lead us to a place where we think God doesn't exist that's not God's leadership God's leadership is I want to reveal myself I want you to know I'm alive that I'm a God of my word for you not just anyone not just everyone but for you not the not your neighbor next to you to you cuz he leadth amen and so as I was saying these these bodies can be so limiting but I pray we could be more aware God leadth presently every day in our lives amen what are we going to do just stay surrender to him love him be thankful thank you Lord you found me thank you Lord you saved me thank you Lord my expected end is Glory thank you Lord I don't have to go through a Great Tribulation thank you Lord that my sins are all washed away thank you Lord you dealt with the sin question of my life you took care of that for me thank you Lord thank you Lord you've saved me to keep me he leadth me who's ever been in turmoil I'm sure we're can all say yes and I and and you didn't know the way out and somehow the Lord just you maybe you opened his word heard a message some just came into your heart do this do that and you look back and say he leadth me Hallelujah when your flesh wanted to go one way but God wanted you go the other way and you chose to go God's way he leadth me and even though sometimes we may go astray he he goes after you he's like no no no you're going off the path I want to bring you home I want to bring you back I want to lead you in my word come back into my word and walk with me in my word amen but you see how as I said our flesh can be so uh I pray that we would look beyond our five senses and we would realize God is he leadth us amen and and S brother Bram uh in the message Mother's day you should go if you want to read a quick short sharp powerful thing read Mother's Day there's only one time he preached it it's very it's very good he says then as we as we see him and we will not be as we are now we'll know how to love him more we'll not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him we'll be more he'll be more of a relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in the Mortal bodies then we'll have a body like his glorious body we'll know how to worship Him and when we see what the presence of his being has done to us changed us the old back young all the deform strain out oh we'll understand then why has power healed us the question has been in our minds how can he do it how uh what would this somehow mysteriously they all fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our heads will this be how could it be somehow or another Majestic fingers will just untangle unravel those knots and it'll all fade into one big crown of love I pray he does it for us now just untangle those knots of how's it going to work out and how's this be and how could you do it and just be untangled unraveled it all fade into one big crown of love his Divine love in our lives amen that we can whatever situation we say he leadeth me I'm going through the worst trial of my life but he leadth me amen every my world's Fallen apart but he leadth me amen let's have the musicians tonight shall we have a time of prayer but I'm trust we all say he leadth me have you but have you invited his leadership into your life that's the question you because it it takes two how can two walk together unless they be agreed okay see so in order to be led you got to be surrendered to his leadership
