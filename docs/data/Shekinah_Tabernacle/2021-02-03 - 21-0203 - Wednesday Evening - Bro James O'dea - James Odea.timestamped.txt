[11:29] for it's only
[11:34] your will that i
[11:40] am
[11:54] [Music]
[12:01] [Music]
[12:13] [Music]
[12:15] jesus
[12:18] oh jesus
[12:28] [Music]
[12:36] jesus
[12:40] all for jesus

[12:54] [Music]
[13:02] that i am free
[13:05] [Music]
[13:07] for its own near
[13:11] your will that i
[13:16] am free for its only foreign
[13:21] [Music]
[13:40] [Music]
[13:45] ambitions hopes and plans let's
[13:49] surrender it
[13:50] i surrender these
[13:55] into your hands
[14:02] [Music]
[14:05] and then surrender it into his hands
[14:08] [Music]
[14:13] so this song i would sing if i may
[14:17] the first verse and the chorus i'll sing
[14:19] for you
[14:20] and which you join in and the rest of
[14:22] them because i sing it a little bit
[14:23] different
[14:23] you know it's all right but i hope it
[14:25] blesses you because it it just
[14:27] it just it's awesome to sing for the
[14:29] lord i
[14:33] what can wash away
[14:37] my sins nothing but the blood
[14:42] of jesus
[14:44] [Music]
[14:49] what can make me hold
[14:53] again nothing but
[14:56] the blood of jesus
[15:02] oh precious is that flow
[15:07] [Music]
[15:08] that makes me quiet
[15:12] [Music]
[15:25] so there's just that little force
[15:26] between the two in the first verse
[15:30] for my cleansing for my claims
[15:34] in this i see
[15:37] nothing but the blood of
[15:41] [Music]
[15:53] nothing jesus the blood of jesus
[16:00] oh precious
[16:08] [Music]
[16:19] nothing but the blood of me
[16:22] read those words i mean so love means so
[16:26] much
[16:26] [Music]
[16:29] this is all my hope and stay
[16:35] nothing but the blood of jesus
[16:45] this is all my righteousness
[16:50] nothing but the blood of jesus
[16:56] operations oh precious
[17:04] makes me
[17:18] nothing but the blood of me
[17:22] oh precious
[17:32] makes me
[17:47] [Music]
[17:52] amen sometimes the plane can
[17:55] fly and sometimes it gets full
[17:59] but as long as you keep singing for him
[18:00] right hallelujah
[18:02] amen so before we have a special i think
[18:05] we have to sing one more song just
[18:07] because everybody looks like they really
[18:08] want to sing tonight
[18:10] can we sing it's bubbly please
[18:14] the reason for it is it is bubbling
[18:17] amen i had one of the hardest
[18:21] trials i ever thought mentally you know
[18:24] those mental battles that the laws fight
[18:26] and then once you tell satan where he
[18:28] belongs
[18:29] and you get the victory you can't help
[18:32] but bubbling the law just helps you to
[18:33] overcome
[18:34] so let's please do bubbling if you don't
[18:36] mind please
[18:38] amen oh it's bubbling
[18:41] it's bubbling it's bubbling in my
[18:44] soulless singing
[18:46] and laughing since jesus made me own
[18:50] some folks don't understand it how can i
[18:53] keep
[18:54] it quiet

[19:35] it quiet

[24:34] i have heard of christians
[24:40] long ago they were
[24:43] born before
[24:46] [Music]
[24:57] if they would renounce
[25:00] the name of christ
[25:04] and one by one

[29:24] is
[29:30] hello thank you jesus
[29:34] hallelujah you know we're coming into a
[29:37] time when you're going to have to pledge
[29:39] allegiance to something
[29:42] and i really think brother roman for
[29:46] leading the songs and when i see seeing
[29:48] that he was going to sing that song i
[29:50] thought praise the lord i hope he
[29:52] calls me up on that song praise the lord
[29:55] if you could just put out my slideshow
[29:57] please
[30:00] and if you want to turn you can turn to
[30:02] mark but it's up on the
[30:03] slideshow as well
[30:12] so we're going mark 13 verse 9.
[30:36] cool but take heed to yourselves
[30:40] for they shall deliver you up to
[30:42] councils and in the synagogues you shall
[30:45] be beaten
[30:46] and you shall be brought before rulers
[30:47] and kings for my sake
[30:49] for a testimony against them and the
[30:52] gospel must first be published
[30:54] among all nations but when they shall
[30:56] lead you and deliver you up
[30:58] take no thought beforehand what you
[30:59] shall speak neither do you premeditate
[31:02] but whatsoever shall be given
[31:05] shall be given you in that hour that
[31:07] speak ye for it is not ye that speak but
[31:09] the holy ghost
[31:11] and i've just got another scripture here
[31:13] that i want to take and you can read
[31:15] that one if you want or it's
[31:16] luke 2 1.
[31:26] and it came to pass on those days that
[31:28] they went out a decree from caesar
[31:30] augustus that all
[31:32] the world should be taxed and all went
[31:34] to be taxed everyone into his own city
[31:38] so let's just pray and
[31:41] just commit this time to the lord
[31:44] heavenly father lord i just see this
[31:46] time we're coming into lord is such a
[31:48] such a real time lord just a pressureful
[31:51] time lord a worrying time lord jesus
[31:53] ever not for knowing you but father i
[31:57] just pray lord that your holy spirit
[31:58] lord will just move among us tonight
[32:00] lord
[32:01] oh lord just take my lips lord for they
[32:03] just shake together lord and don't know
[32:05] what to say father but
[32:06] our lord let your spirit speak lord as
[32:09] we've just read lord it's
[32:11] not we that speak with the holy spirit
[32:13] father and lord we just pray that you'd
[32:15] rightly divide the word for us
[32:17] tonight lord and just speak unto us lord
[32:19] and to our need father
[32:21] lord we just pray you bless this reading
[32:22] of your word in jesus name
[32:24] amen you may take your seats
[32:32] so the thought i had was a cold-pressed
[32:35] bride
[32:37] an extra virgin cold press borrowed
[32:40] and you know it to get this bride to
[32:43] perfection is going to take a pressure
[32:45] and we've been through the fires there's
[32:48] been all sorts of trials that
[32:50] people have come up through 2 000 years
[32:53] but it's got to take a squeeze to bring
[32:55] out the pure oil
[32:57] just like the goldsmiths they used to
[32:59] beat the gold you know
[33:00] because they wanted to get pure gold and
[33:02] it was just by beating it just pressure
[33:03] just
[33:04] time and just getting out all the
[33:06] imperfections and it's
[33:07] we've just got to get to the point where
[33:09] we just get out all those imperfections
[33:11] and if you think about a squeeze if you
[33:14] take a piece of fruit
[33:16] you say you take a lime now if you went
[33:18] to the supermarket and bought a lime and
[33:20] it had no juice in it you got home and
[33:21] you opened it up and there was no juice
[33:23] and it was dry
[33:24] you're like well that's a it's a dud
[33:26] lime i don't want that lime
[33:27] but you want a nice juicy one because
[33:30] all the goodness all the flavour
[33:31] and all everything that you want out of
[33:33] that limes in the juice
[33:35] so then you begin to squeeze that lime
[33:38] and all that juice comes out and you
[33:39] squeeze and you know it's interesting
[33:42] that the
[33:43] the less oil that's left to be squeezed
[33:45] out the more pressure has to be applied
[33:47] to get out that last drop
[33:48] and all the life's on the juice and
[33:50] what's left is just the flesh
[33:52] of the lemon and god's got to get the
[33:56] pure oil out of us
[33:59] amen who wants that who wants to see the
[34:02] pure oil come out in your life
[34:04] i mean it's going to take a squeeze
[34:09] in revelation 21 verse 9 it says and
[34:12] there came unto me one of the seven
[34:14] angels which had the seven vials full of
[34:16] the seven last plagues
[34:17] and talked with me saying come hither i
[34:19] will show thee the bride the lamb's wife
[34:22] you know the prophet identified himself
[34:23] with that scripture
[34:25] and he carried me away in the spirit
[34:27] into a great and high mountain and
[34:29] showed me that great city the holy
[34:30] jerusalem descending out
[34:32] of heaven from god having the glory of
[34:35] god and her light was like unto a stone
[34:37] most precious
[34:38] even like a jasper stone clear as
[34:40] crystal
[34:42] you know it takes pressure to create a
[34:44] precious gem
[34:45] amen and when i read this and i read the
[34:47] other stones i like to just
[34:49] just look a little deeper into what's
[34:51] behind it
[34:52] because each gemstones are made out of
[34:55] different elements
[34:56] that are squeezed together so like a
[34:58] diamond is formed when
[34:59] carbon atoms come together and then
[35:02] under extreme pressure they're squeezed
[35:04] together
[35:04] that diamond then becomes the hardest
[35:07] substance on earth
[35:09] so i wondered about this jasper stone
[35:11] and jasper's formed from
[35:13] volcanic ash
[35:17] something that's already been through
[35:19] the fire and then that combines with
[35:21] silica sand and
[35:22] through pressure it turns into a jasper
[35:24] stone and god likened her radiance as to
[35:27] a stone most precious like a jasper
[35:29] stone
[35:30] there's something interesting about this
[35:31] i found
[35:34] somebody i don't know who the quote was
[35:36] from but it was on one of those webstone
[35:39] sites each jasper stone possesses a
[35:42] unique pattern or colour scheme
[35:44] making it one of the most unique
[35:45] gemstones i thought that was rather
[35:47] interesting
[35:48] because god has a unique bride you know
[35:50] with a unique character
[35:52] and brother ben was talking about it
[35:53] with the girls going down south
[35:55] you're unique and that's what god's
[35:57] creating
[35:58] and it's coming from pressure because
[36:01] each
[36:01] trial that you go through is different
[36:04] and though we're going to be one
[36:06] bride we're still going to be unique in
[36:07] heaven you know daniel will have a
[36:10] testimony of being in the lion's den
[36:12] and noah will be able to tell you about
[36:14] the heaviest rain you've ever seen
[36:17] elijah would be able to tell you about
[36:19] getting chased by jezebel
[36:21] but you know what maybe one day moses
[36:23] will come up
[36:24] to you and say what's your testimony
[36:27] because you'll have a testimony and
[36:29] and brother impose trials might not be
[36:31] the same as brother ben's trials and
[36:32] then his character is a bit different
[36:34] both godly pure oil
[36:35] but everyone has a different
[36:37] manifestation to
[36:39] manifest amen
[36:44] so there's got to come a squeeze on this
[36:46] world
[36:47] and it's got to come on the bride to
[36:49] bring out a pure oil that extra virgin
[36:51] oil
[36:52] amen it's got to be cold pressed
[36:55] we've been done with the fire now it's
[36:57] now it's a real this is going to be a
[36:58] different kind of trial
[37:02] has anybody felt like the squeeze is
[37:04] starting to like i know this squeeze has
[37:05] been here but that it's starting to
[37:07] tighten up
[37:08] as brother branham said it will start to
[37:10] tighten that when it starts to tighten
[37:11] up
[37:13] you know i was thinking about this and i
[37:15] was thinking what about in lockdown
[37:17] did you have any rights you had some
[37:21] rights but a lot of your rights were
[37:22] taken away
[37:23] we couldn't just say all right they say
[37:26] we can't gather but we're going to have
[37:27] church anyway
[37:28] we couldn't do that we would have been
[37:30] locked up
[37:33] it's only going to get tighter and
[37:34] tighter from here
[37:40] so in that scripture we took luke 2 and
[37:42] verse 1 it says it come to pass in those
[37:44] days
[37:45] that they went out a decree from caesar
[37:47] augustus that all the world should be
[37:48] taxed
[37:49] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[37:51] his own city
[37:53] so i was looking at this and i had to
[37:57] i've got it there i had to look up what
[38:00] it meant that word tax because it wasn't
[38:02] what i thought i thought that meant that
[38:03] everyone had to go into their own
[38:04] country and pay some money
[38:06] but it's not what the scripture was
[38:07] saying it said everybody had to go back
[38:10] into their homeland
[38:11] and a record was taken israel was
[38:13] numbered and they
[38:14] wanted to know who was from where and
[38:16] who was from where and under this covet
[38:18] it's now
[38:19] causing men from all over the world
[38:22] to return to their homelands just like
[38:25] in the scripture
[38:27] you know we've had many flus over the
[38:28] year we've had
[38:30] swine flu bird flu has been man flus
[38:34] but none of these flus have caused such
[38:37] a pressure to come on the world
[38:40] amen none of them have taken away our
[38:42] rights and freedoms
[38:43] but this is what the squeeze is to do to
[38:45] bring a pressure upon all men
[38:47] and you know they've got if people don't
[38:50] they can't receive the same medical care
[38:52] they can't receive the same financial
[38:53] care
[38:54] if they're not in their own home country
[38:56] so there's reasons why people are going
[38:57] back to their home countries
[39:01] spiritual things that are in the bible
[39:03] shadows
[39:04] have to be made manifest now things that
[39:07] we see like patterns repeat in the bible
[39:11] at the coming the first coming of christ
[39:13] gabriel was sent before to declare to
[39:16] a virgin to mary that she would bring
[39:18] forth a christ trial
[39:21] and gave gabriel's message to mary
[39:24] tonight a virgin bride because she's got
[39:28] to bring forth a christ child in this
[39:30] age
[39:33] in 61 mary's belief we are looking for a
[39:36] heavenly visitor in this day
[39:38] it's a promise of god put on your deep
[39:40] spiritual thinking quick
[39:42] church and remember we are looking for a
[39:45] visitor
[39:45] and there's many claiming it but the
[39:47] only way that we will know this heavenly
[39:49] visitor because he'll be
[39:51] a record of the word and she knew that
[39:54] the angel was from god when she seen his
[39:56] action
[39:56] looked at him and must have been an
[39:58] angel he said i am gabriel standing at
[40:01] the right hand of god
[40:04] now when god gets ready to do something
[40:06] he sends a messenger
[40:08] always always has always will gabriel
[40:12] announce the first coming of christ
[40:14] gabriel will announce the second coming
[40:16] of christ that's right
[40:17] something major is fixing to happen and
[40:20] we noticed this angel when he said
[40:22] hail mary and told her what was going to
[40:24] take place
[40:25] she didn't doubt him because she knew no
[40:27] he was perfectly scriptural
[40:29] and that it was supposed to be that way
[40:33] so that message has come forth through
[40:35] the message of a prophet again to a
[40:38] virgin bride to a second mary
[40:40] that's that would be you
[40:50] if i could take a bit of liberty i would
[40:52] say a
[40:53] extra virgin a cold press extra virgin
[40:56] church
[40:57] amen because of christ
[41:00] you have you're going to have to
[41:01] manifest again a christ child
[41:09] the same i just started seeing a pattern
[41:11] here the same
[41:12] way that this happened two thousand
[41:13] years ago that's the way it's going to
[41:15] happen again because
[41:16] jesus wants to prove again he wants to
[41:19] prove to the world
[41:20] that christ lives in the bride amen
[41:25] it has to prove he lives
[41:29] that's what i want to see you know i
[41:31] want to come to church when we have
[41:32] those meetings when we see all the gifts
[41:35] happening or we see prophecy happening
[41:36] where we see people where i want to see
[41:38] someone come up here
[41:40] that's sick with a tumour and that term
[41:42] is prayed for and that thing falls off
[41:43] and hits the ground
[41:44] rolls out and rolls out the door because
[41:47] that's the kind of power that's coming
[41:48] into the church
[41:50] it's happened before and it's going to
[41:52] come again
[41:55] so with covert we've been called back to
[41:57] our homeland and herod
[41:59] which is satan and herod he knew that
[42:02] christ
[42:02] was in the land because there had been a
[42:04] star that identified christ's coming
[42:06] amen
[42:08] i asked myself why did that picture of
[42:09] brother branham with the halo above his
[42:11] head have to hang in washington
[42:14] this is a testimony before the powers
[42:17] and rulers of this earth
[42:18] yes that christ is coming amen
[42:22] amen when herod was on the wall path he
[42:25] wants to kill that christ child before
[42:27] it can manifest the power of god
[42:31] so now the bride coming under this
[42:32] pressure coming back to her homeland
[42:35] at this time and now herod puts out a
[42:37] decree to kill all the young children
[42:39] because he's got to kill that christ
[42:41] child he does not want that christ child
[42:43] to manifest
[42:44] power upon the earth
[42:48] and we know that the birth is always a
[42:51] vulnerable time right whenever
[42:52] something's about to give birth it's a
[42:54] very vulnerable time
[42:55] especially you see in africa or
[42:57] something like that when a buffalo or
[42:59] whatever animal it is is giving birth
[43:01] and the lions will hang around that one
[43:03] if they can it's an easy
[43:04] it's an easy meal it's easy to take the
[43:06] young and it's the same way spiritually
[43:10] a baby can't defend itself and that's
[43:12] why the pentecostal church can come
[43:15] so close to the real thing but she's
[43:18] still a baby
[43:19] she's a hundred year old baby but she
[43:21] never grew up
[43:25] she had something genuine you know when
[43:26] she started off she had something
[43:28] genuine but she just never grew up
[43:31] and anybody today without a seventh
[43:33] angel's message is gonna
[43:35] be devoured because it just debate that
[43:38] roman dragon wants to kill any of god's
[43:40] seed while it's a baby before it can
[43:42] mature because once it matures it can
[43:43] defend itself right
[43:46] i want to follow some of this through
[43:48] revelation
[43:49] 12 and 1 and there appeared a great
[43:51] wonder in heaven a woman clothed with
[43:53] the sun and the moon under her feet
[43:55] and upon her head a crown of twelve
[43:58] stars
[44:01] and she being with child cried
[44:03] travailing in birth and pain to be
[44:05] delivered
[44:06] and there appeared another wonder in
[44:07] heaven and behold a great redragon
[44:09] having seven heads and ten horns and
[44:11] seven crowns upon his head
[44:13] and his tail drew the third part of the
[44:15] stars of heaven and to cast him to the
[44:17] earth
[44:18] and the dragon stood before the woman
[44:19] which was ready to be delivered
[44:21] for to devour her child as soon as it
[44:23] was born
[44:25] so here's now a pattern of satan after
[44:28] the first christ
[44:29] and we can see how he's going to come
[44:30] after the second
[44:32] one being birthed in a bride
[44:36] but god's given us an open book right
[44:39] he's given us an open book
[44:41] prophecy to warn us and to show us where
[44:43] we're at and what's going to happen
[44:45] around us
[44:48] so in matthew 2 13
[44:52] and when they were departed behold an
[44:55] angel of the lord
[44:56] appeareth unto joseph in a dream saying
[44:58] arise and take the young child and his
[45:00] mother and flee into egypt and be thou
[45:03] there until i bring
[45:04] me word for herod will seek the young
[45:06] child to destroy him
[45:09] so let the squeeze come it's not going
[45:11] to change the fact that god looks after
[45:13] his own right
[45:15] god will move you when you need to be
[45:16] moved if god can move two million people
[45:18] in the desert
[45:20] then he can move you he can warn you he
[45:21] can pick a church up and move it to
[45:23] nelson
[45:25] i don't think he'll do that but if he
[45:26] can lead two million people through the
[45:28] desert to find
[45:30] water in a barren desert maybe only
[45:33] two k's away and find water then he can
[45:35] lead us
[45:37] i mean how many times have maybe this is
[45:40] just
[45:41] my testimony but how many times i'll be
[45:43] driving and then someone will slow me
[45:45] down
[45:46] and i can't get past them and you're
[45:47] held up we had it in
[45:49] one when we were down and traveling from
[45:51] queenstown to wanaka
[45:52] and we were in a rush when we were
[45:54] delayed leaving home we're probably
[45:56] i don't know sitting in the car waiting
[45:58] but then when we're going up that crown
[45:59] range
[46:00] and we're just one corner off the next
[46:02] corner and i see a truck come down the
[46:04] road on the wrong side of the road
[46:06] um two wheels smoke coming off and just
[46:08] go straight across the corner we would
[46:09] have driven around and off the hill
[46:11] you know what if we had it been 20
[46:13] seconds in front you know we might have
[46:15] collided and god knows how to place you
[46:17] to look after his own
[46:19] amen we're very precious to him amen
[46:25] verse 16 then herod when he saw that he
[46:29] was mocked of the wise men was exceeding
[46:31] wrath
[46:31] and sent forth and slow all the children
[46:33] that were in bethlehem
[46:35] and all the coasts thereof from two
[46:36] years old and under
[46:38] according to the time which he had
[46:39] diligently inquired of the wise men
[46:42] then was fulfilled that which was spoken
[46:45] by
[46:45] jeremiah the prophet saying i read this
[46:48] i just felt the lord say go read that in
[46:50] jeremiah there's something there for you
[46:52] and so i read it in jeremiah and i'm
[46:54] going to carry on right from there
[46:56] reading that in jeremiah
[47:00] thus saith the lord lord a voice was
[47:03] heard in remark
[47:04] lamentation and bitter weeping rachel
[47:07] weeping for her children
[47:08] refused to be comforted for her children
[47:10] because they were not
[47:12] but see the the dragon now the devil
[47:15] coming down in this age
[47:17] and robbing our children your children
[47:20] while they get babes
[47:21] and the lord because they don't know how
[47:22] to defend themselves yet and he's out as
[47:24] a roaring lion seeking her to devour
[47:27] and here in the scripture and rachel it
[47:30] says rachel now rachel's a type of the
[47:31] gentile bride she was the fair one that
[47:33] jacob loved
[47:35] and she represented the gentile weeping
[47:37] through children
[47:39] and you can't comfort a mother that's
[47:41] lost a child
[47:42] i'm not a mother i can't understand but
[47:44] i can very much understand what it would
[47:46] be like to feel that you've lost a child
[47:48] so the only way you're going to get
[47:49] comfort is to take that back from the
[47:51] enemy right
[47:52] this is where the lord seeker readers in
[47:54] jeremiah
[47:55] so he carries on
[47:59] in 16 thus saith the lord refrain thy
[48:02] voice from weeping and then eyes from
[48:04] tears
[48:04] for thy work shall be rewarded saith the
[48:06] lord and they shall come again from the
[48:08] land of the enemy
[48:09] and there is hope and known in saith the
[48:12] lord that all thy children shall come
[48:13] again to their own border
[48:15] so i missed that part often when we read
[48:17] it in in the new testament but i believe
[48:20] that's true you know because
[48:22] if you've instilled something in your
[48:23] child they know about california going
[48:26] down they know about these things they
[48:27] know about
[48:28] the catholic church coming up they know
[48:30] all these things though they suppress it
[48:32] but as this pressure comes on and we
[48:35] start
[48:36] losing liberties and all these things
[48:38] come on there's probably going to be a
[48:39] time those kids are going to go you know
[48:41] what
[48:42] i've actually heard this before i've
[48:43] actually seen this in prophecy before
[48:46] and it's going to start getting real
[48:48] serious
[48:54] so i've been watching this and
[48:57] for now for now i'm just going to say
[48:59] what i'm going to say about it
[49:01] and i'm going to keep watching it but
[49:03] it's interesting that we've come into a
[49:05] global pandemic
[49:06] a great pressure this is a time when
[49:09] leaders either going to fall arise
[49:12] and we've just seen the last trump
[49:13] leavers office
[49:15] and now america has some bad karma or
[49:17] camilla
[49:21] and now we have a catholic president
[49:25] and a protestant vice president that
[49:28] just happens to be a woman
[49:31] and this is where it starts getting
[49:33] interesting one of their main political
[49:35] agendas and main political pushes to get
[49:37] into government has been on abortion
[49:41] because it's all about the child
[49:45] and so what they want to do is they want
[49:47] to overturn old amendments that were
[49:49] made that
[49:50] allowed each state to make their own
[49:51] rule on abortion and override the main
[49:54] the main role but what they're doing is
[49:56] overturning that and saying no
[49:58] now that amendment's gone and
[50:01] they want to make abortion available to
[50:04] anyone
[50:04] at any time and are free of charge
[50:08] so now they can abort it eight months
[50:12] nine months well i don't think they're
[50:14] past it but that's been there
[50:15] one of their main drives in their
[50:17] political move to get into office
[50:21] so it's it's a spiritual and natural
[50:23] going hand in hand all the time the
[50:25] devil does
[50:26] not want this child to come forth
[50:32] in revelation 13 1 it said and i stood
[50:35] upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast
[50:37] rise up out of the sea
[50:39] having seven heads and ten horns and
[50:41] upon his ten horns ten crowns
[50:43] and upon his head's the name of
[50:44] blasphemy and i saw one of its heads as
[50:47] it were wounded to death and his deadly
[50:49] wound was healed
[50:50] and all the world wandered after the
[50:52] beast and all that dwell upon the earth
[50:54] shall worship him
[50:56] whose names are not written in the book
[50:57] of life of the land slain from the
[50:59] foundation of the world
[51:01] if any man have an ear let him hear
[51:08] and from verse 11 and behold another
[51:11] beast coming up out of the earth
[51:13] and he had two horns like a lamb and
[51:15] spake as a dragon
[51:17] and exercises all the power of the first
[51:20] beast before him and causeth the earth
[51:22] and them that dwell therein to worship
[51:24] the first beast
[51:25] whose deadly wound was healed and
[51:27] deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
[51:29] by means
[51:30] of those miracles which he had power to
[51:33] do in the sight of the beast
[51:34] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[51:36] that they should make an image to the
[51:38] beast
[51:38] which had the wound by a sword and did
[51:41] live
[51:41] and he had power to give life unto the
[51:44] image of a beast
[51:45] that the image of the beast should both
[51:47] speak and cause that as many as would
[51:49] not worship
[51:51] the image of the beast should be killed
[51:54] so now here in political power in
[51:56] america
[51:57] we've got one rising up out of the ocean
[51:59] and one coming up off the earth
[52:01] and power this is why i'm saying this is
[52:03] very interesting now to watch this space
[52:05] because i'm starting to see this in
[52:07] scripture very clearly
[52:10] so in the church age book
[52:13] brother branham says the beast that was
[52:16] wounded unto death but lived
[52:18] again as imperial pagan rome that fell
[52:20] to the onslaught of the barbarians
[52:22] and thereby lost her temporal power but
[52:24] she regained it in baffle roam
[52:26] do you see it the nation that ruled by
[52:28] crushing all which became the strongest
[52:31] empire ever known
[52:32] was finally wounded to death her power
[52:35] was gone
[52:36] physically as to control armies etc but
[52:39] under constantine she came back to life
[52:41] for papal rome has infiltrated the whole
[52:44] world and her power is absolute
[52:46] she uses kings and merchants and her
[52:48] deadly religious
[52:49] and financial strength she is governing
[52:52] as the goddess of this present age
[52:54] she is also the dragon that stood
[52:56] waiting to devour the man-child
[52:59] hero tried to kill the lord jesus and
[53:00] failed later jesus was crucified by
[53:03] roman soldiers
[53:05] but is now caught up to the throne now
[53:07] along
[53:08] with what i have just said recall the
[53:10] vision of daniel
[53:12] the last part of the image the last
[53:15] world power was in the feet
[53:17] that was iron and clay see the iron is
[53:20] the roman empire
[53:21] but now it is no longer solid iron clay
[53:24] is mixed in it
[53:25] yet it is there running world affairs in
[53:27] both democratic nations and despotic
[53:29] ones
[53:30] the roamer's church is in every nation
[53:32] it is mixed up in it all
[53:34] let me give you a little something on
[53:35] the iron and clay remember when
[53:37] khrushchev
[53:38] beat his shoe on the desk at the u.n
[53:41] well there were five eastern nations and
[53:43] there were five western
[53:44] khrushchev spoke for the east and the
[53:46] president eisenhower for the west
[53:48] and russia crucifies clay eisenhower
[53:51] means iron
[53:52] the two main leaders of the world the
[53:54] two big toes of the feet of iron and
[53:56] clay were side by side
[53:58] we are in the end of it all in verse 4
[54:00] it asks
[54:01] who was able to make war with the beast
[54:04] now there are pres
[54:05] at present some great names in the world
[54:07] there are some mighty nations
[54:09] but right now rome is calling the tune
[54:12] the pope is in the driver's seat and his
[54:14] power is going to increase
[54:16] no one can war against him so now we
[54:20] have that
[54:21] we have our president biden hand in hand
[54:24] with the catholic church
[54:26] and we've got the vice president there
[54:27] who's a protestant and we're going to
[54:29] somehow expect these to a protestant
[54:31] right
[54:32] but like usually that's not a working
[54:34] relationship but these two are now
[54:37] controlling the powers of america
[54:40] very very interesting but we don't need
[54:43] a fear
[54:47] because watch what happens next and i
[54:50] saw another
[54:52] mighty angel come down from heaven
[54:53] clothed with a cloud
[54:55] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[54:57] face word as the sun
[54:58] and his feet pillars of fires and he had
[55:01] in his hand a little book open
[55:03] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[55:10] i thought i'd illustrate this keep your
[55:12] attention
[55:13] and he put his left hand upon left foot
[55:16] upon the earth
[55:17] so now we've got a messenger that's come
[55:19] with an open book
[55:21] and he's come to say look this is
[55:24] you're exposed we're going to expose you
[55:28] to your lord
[55:29] that's right
[55:32] and then then we go down to verse 8 we
[55:34] know well
[55:35] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[55:37] spake unto me again and said go
[55:39] take the little book which is open in
[55:41] the hand of the angel which standeth
[55:43] upon the sea and the earth
[55:44] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[55:47] him give me the little book
[55:48] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[55:50] up it shall make thy
[55:52] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[55:53] mouth sweet as honey
[55:56] and i took the little book out of the
[55:58] angel's hand and ate it up
[55:59] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[56:01] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[56:03] was bitter
[56:04] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[56:06] again before many peoples and nations
[56:08] and tongues and kings
[56:10] you know who's had that feeling of
[56:12] butterflies in your stomach before a
[56:16] real
[56:16] genuine feeling of butterflies in your
[56:18] stomach you know i bet it felt like that
[56:20] so wonderful to hear the revelation oh
[56:22] man so good but then
[56:25] now you're going to go take it we're
[56:27] going to bring you before rulers and
[56:28] kings and oh
[56:31] that feeling you know it's it's
[56:35] you know we have no need to fear because
[56:37] we have the holy spirit but
[56:38] if i was honest if i didn't have the
[56:40] holy spirit i would be very scared
[56:42] because it's a very real time it's a
[56:44] very real pressure that's coming
[56:47] this is the bride stand she has thus
[56:49] saith the lord not to worship the image
[56:52] of the beast amen this book is in our
[56:54] hands
[56:55] and spiritually speaking that beast is
[56:57] underneath our feet
[56:59] his time to exercise control over god's
[57:02] elect is fast running out
[57:06] but remember there's always twins if the
[57:08] devil's manifesting then so is christ
[57:10] going to manifest
[57:12] as soon as he steps it up and not try
[57:14] the bride will step it up and not try
[57:19] amen so now
[57:23] this dragon's manifesting itself where
[57:25] is its attention going to turn because
[57:26] remember it was after the first christ
[57:28] child at the birth
[57:30] so now as this is all coming up to a hit
[57:32] this dragon again is going to turn to
[57:34] the birthplace
[57:35] of the second coming of christ right
[57:37] which is in the bride
[57:39] that's why the pressure is going to come
[57:41] on the bride the squeeze
[57:43] and it's happening now you know we can
[57:44] put this off but it's happening now
[57:47] because there's groups in other parts of
[57:49] the world that
[57:50] are not being allowed to gather they've
[57:51] been they've been brought that right now
[57:53] they've been brought before magistrates
[57:55] and rulers and
[57:56] and kings and been judged for what they
[57:58] believed
[57:59] just as this world council of churches
[58:01] is gathering together
[58:05] and you know these people that are
[58:06] gathering together they think they're
[58:08] doing it for the good
[58:09] they don't realize that they're doing it
[58:10] for the best
[58:13] so it's not it's not the people we have
[58:15] to remember that it's always a balance
[58:18] so if we go to the image in daniel 3
[58:21] verse 2 it says then
[58:23] nebuchadnezzar the king sent together
[58:25] together the princes the governors the
[58:27] captains the judges the treasurers the
[58:29] councillors the sheriffs
[58:31] and all the rulers of the provinces to
[58:33] come to the dedication of the image
[58:35] which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[58:37] this is what i believe is happening this
[58:39] has all been set up nebuchadnezzar is
[58:41] gathering all the people
[58:42] gathering all the people to set up a
[58:44] council then the princes the governors
[58:47] the captains the judge the treasurers
[58:49] the councillors the sheriffs
[58:50] and all the rulers of the provinces were
[58:52] gathered together unto the dedication of
[58:54] the image that nebuchadnezzar the king
[58:56] had set up
[58:57] and they stood before the image that
[58:58] nebuchadnezzar had set up
[59:01] then a herald angel then then a herald
[59:04] cried aloud
[59:05] to you it has commanded o people nations
[59:08] and languages
[59:08] that at what time you hear the sound of
[59:10] the cornet the flute the heart
[59:12] the sack but the poultry the dick
[59:14] climber and all kinds of music you fall
[59:16] down and worship the in
[59:18] the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the
[59:19] king hath set up
[59:21] and who so falleth not down in worship
[59:23] the same hour shall be cast into the
[59:25] midst of the burning fiery furnace
[59:30] wherefore at that time certain chaldeans
[59:33] came near
[59:34] and accused the jews and there are
[59:37] certain jews whom
[59:39] thou has set over the affairs of the
[59:41] province of babylon
[59:42] sadrak meshach and abednego these men o
[59:45] king have not regarded thee
[59:47] nor serve thy gods nor worship the
[59:49] golden image which thou has set up
[59:51] then nebuchadnezzar and his rage and
[59:53] fury commanded to bring shadrach
[59:55] meshach and abednego and they brought
[59:58] these men before
[59:59] the king just remember
[1:00:02] in context to our scripture and the
[1:00:04] gospel must first be published among all
[1:00:07] nations
[1:00:08] and you have this book you have the
[1:00:10] revelation of jesus christ
[1:00:12] but when they shall lead you and deliver
[1:00:14] you up take no thought
[1:00:15] beforehand what you shall speak neither
[1:00:17] do you pre-meditate
[1:00:19] for whatsoever shall be given to you in
[1:00:21] that hour speak ye for it is not ye that
[1:00:23] speak but the holy ghost
[1:00:26] amen like i said don't put this off
[1:00:29] this is current affairs this is the news
[1:00:32] amen this is this is the news i enjoy
[1:00:35] you know amen
[1:00:38] i've just been watching that squeeze you
[1:00:40] know it's not like it's been a new thing
[1:00:42] the squeeze has been here for a while
[1:00:43] but it's got to begin to tighten
[1:00:47] i mean and just to get the closer we're
[1:00:51] getting to the end right the more
[1:00:52] pressure's coming on to get out that
[1:00:54] last
[1:00:54] little bit of oil
[1:00:58] nebuchadnezzar's spike and sit under
[1:01:00] them is it true
[1:01:02] sad rack mesh and a bendigo do you not
[1:01:05] serve my gods nor worship the golden
[1:01:07] image which i have set up
[1:01:09] now if you be ready at what time you
[1:01:11] hear the sound of the cornet
[1:01:12] float heart and sack but sultry and dark
[1:01:15] climber
[1:01:16] and all kinds of music you fall down and
[1:01:18] worship the image which i have made
[1:01:20] well but if you worship not you shall be
[1:01:22] cast the same hour into the midst
[1:01:24] of a bernie fiery furnace and who is
[1:01:28] that god
[1:01:28] that shall deliver you out of my hands
[1:01:31] see this slippery devil trying to get
[1:01:32] them
[1:01:33] to doubt amen jehovah
[1:01:38] i hope i don't have to say this too many
[1:01:40] times shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:01:43] answered and said
[1:01:44] to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not
[1:01:46] careful to answer thee in this matter
[1:01:48] in other words we have no need to answer
[1:01:50] you they don't have to go away and seek
[1:01:52] counsel and they have to go away and ask
[1:01:54] the pastor you know
[1:01:56] the answer was we will not worship your
[1:01:58] image amen
[1:02:00] amen if it be so our god whom we serve
[1:02:03] is able to deliver us from the burning
[1:02:05] fiery furnace
[1:02:07] and he will deliver us out of thy hand o
[1:02:09] king
[1:02:10] but if not be it known unto thee o king
[1:02:12] that we will not serve thy gods
[1:02:14] nor worship the golden image which thou
[1:02:16] has set up
[1:02:17] amen that's why i like brother man
[1:02:20] saying that so i pledge allegiance to
[1:02:21] the land because you're going to have to
[1:02:22] pledge allegiance to something
[1:02:24] soon and you're going to have to either
[1:02:26] pledge it for spiritual things and
[1:02:28] suffer
[1:02:28] pressure or pleasure for heavenly things
[1:02:33] just don't pledge it for the wrong
[1:02:34] things
[1:02:37] everyone today is searching for the mark
[1:02:39] of the beast and you know i've
[1:02:41] heard it said recently by within message
[1:02:44] ranks
[1:02:44] don't take the coronavirus vaccine it's
[1:02:47] the mark of the beast
[1:02:49] and you know that's nonsense but the
[1:02:51] mark of the beast is to worship the
[1:02:53] image of his beast
[1:02:54] that's to come under their
[1:02:55] denominational systems
[1:02:58] and come under this council that's the
[1:03:00] mark of the beast if you're wondering
[1:03:01] what it is
[1:03:02] don't go there we're separate amen
[1:03:06] amen we've had an angel messenger that's
[1:03:09] come and crushed that image
[1:03:11] told us to stay away from it and you
[1:03:14] know the bride's going to have to watch
[1:03:15] he doesn't come under the influence of
[1:03:17] this land that speaks like a dragon
[1:03:19] because remember that lamb looked like a
[1:03:21] lamb brother branham said it spake like
[1:03:23] a lamb
[1:03:24] in the beginning because it was a
[1:03:25] religion but then later on it spake like
[1:03:28] a dragon
[1:03:30] so you know it's easy for us to follow
[1:03:32] the trends of pentecost
[1:03:34] and you know singing songs i'm not
[1:03:37] saying
[1:03:37] against it but we can easily follow
[1:03:41] that image right because in the end
[1:03:43] that's going to go one way and we're
[1:03:44] going to go this way
[1:03:46] but you know i believe we have a song
[1:03:48] they can't even sing
[1:03:49] because we have something to manifest
[1:03:52] that they don't
[1:03:53] amen that's why i love brother isaac
[1:03:56] songs you know because
[1:03:57] it's manifesting my revelation and they
[1:03:59] might not go and i don't even know what
[1:04:01] you're on about
[1:04:04] we have something to manifest saying
[1:04:06] there's at some point where
[1:04:08] prophet's gonna say come out and be
[1:04:10] separate yeah i mean it's a dinner
[1:04:12] thieves and
[1:04:13] foul things amen
[1:04:20] look away to jesus so now i'm going to
[1:04:22] say something to you now that i haven't
[1:04:24] said all along
[1:04:25] and that is the thing that we have
[1:04:26] looked for for so long
[1:04:28] for at least many years four or five
[1:04:30] years maybe longer
[1:04:32] the third poll has now been vindicated
[1:04:34] and i'm sure you all know what it is
[1:04:36] now remember there will never be an
[1:04:37] impersonation of that because it cannot
[1:04:40] be see it cannot be
[1:04:43] now it is in existence and i have and
[1:04:48] and warned of this that soon right at
[1:04:50] this time now
[1:04:51] it's just happened he's been revealing
[1:04:55] thoughts and things
[1:04:56] so it could identify its presence among
[1:04:59] you see
[1:05:00] but it will not be used in a great way
[1:05:02] until this council begins to tighten up
[1:05:06] and when it does when that does the
[1:05:08] pentecostals and so forth can almost
[1:05:10] impersonate anything can be done but
[1:05:13] when that time comes when the squeeze
[1:05:15] comes down
[1:05:16] then you'll see what you've seen
[1:05:17] temporarily be manifest in the fullness
[1:05:20] of its power
[1:05:21] see pure oil extra virgin bride
[1:05:25] displaying christ proving that he lives
[1:05:28] again on the earth
[1:05:29] amen amen when they come
[1:05:33] and want to try and shut us down we'll
[1:05:35] have to be in such a condition
[1:05:37] that we can speak what we have need of
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:44] i believe that we're going to be able to
[1:05:46] do that and they will want to shut us
[1:05:47] down
[1:05:48] it's not it's not like it's something
[1:05:51] that we just say and it's like yeah we
[1:05:52] say that but it's not no
[1:05:54] it will happen lockdown was just a
[1:05:57] warning
[1:05:58] you know when we had lockdown we were
[1:06:00] blessed enough to have the internet
[1:06:01] and we could zoom and have meetings what
[1:06:04] about when the time comes they shut us
[1:06:05] down because
[1:06:06] what we have that's truth they call
[1:06:08] heresy
[1:06:10] you know well we can't meet online we're
[1:06:14] gonna have to be in a condition where we
[1:06:16] can walk
[1:06:17] amen i believe it i
[1:06:20] am absolutely sold out absolutely soul
[1:06:23] help
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:29] now i must continue in evangelism just
[1:06:31] as i was commissioned
[1:06:32] first i must contin i must continue on
[1:06:36] therefore you've had the word and you
[1:06:38] know what to look for how to stand
[1:06:40] i must continue on an evangelism and
[1:06:42] friends of mine keep still
[1:06:44] and just keep moving on for the hour is
[1:06:46] approaching swiftly
[1:06:48] see that when something is going to be
[1:06:50] done now you might see
[1:06:51] some little odd things happen for me
[1:06:53] nothing sinful i don't mean that
[1:06:55] i mean something odd to the regular
[1:06:57] trend because where i reach to now in
[1:06:59] the ministry
[1:07:00] i'm dropping back here watching that
[1:07:03] spot and waiting for the time to use it
[1:07:05] but it's going to be used
[1:07:07] now the prophet was basically saying
[1:07:09] that this is going to happen in a great
[1:07:12] way but we just have to
[1:07:13] wait until that time comes and that will
[1:07:15] be manifested
[1:07:16] majorly and he's saying i'm dropping
[1:07:18] back
[1:07:19] because he had to drop back just like
[1:07:21] john the baptist had to drop back
[1:07:23] because he came to introduce christ so
[1:07:26] now it's time for christ to step forward
[1:07:28] which is you
[1:07:30] amen to introduce christ to this world
[1:07:34] jesus brother branham said jesus didn't
[1:07:36] finish his earthly
[1:07:38] everything in his earthly journey and
[1:07:40] but what he didn't finish he's now going
[1:07:41] to finish through you
[1:07:42] through his bride
[1:07:51] and everyone knows that for as certain
[1:07:54] as the first was identified so
[1:07:56] has the second being identified and
[1:07:58] you'll think real closely you who are
[1:08:00] spiritual
[1:08:01] as the bible said here is to him that
[1:08:03] has wisdom
[1:08:04] the third is properly identified see we
[1:08:07] know it is so the third paul was here
[1:08:12] it is so sacred that i mustn't say much
[1:08:14] about it
[1:08:15] as he told me in the beginning said this
[1:08:17] say nothing over it
[1:08:19] you remember that years ago
[1:08:22] it speaks for itself but if you've tried
[1:08:25] to explain to others
[1:08:27] and i made that a mistake this will be
[1:08:29] the thing that to my opinion
[1:08:31] he does say this i don't say the lord
[1:08:33] tells me this
[1:08:34] but this will be the thing that will
[1:08:37] start rapturing faith for the going away
[1:08:40] see i must lay quiet for just a little
[1:08:43] while
[1:08:44] now remember and who was listening to
[1:08:46] this tape you might see such a change in
[1:08:48] my ministry right away dropping back
[1:08:50] not going up dropping back we're right
[1:08:52] at that age now
[1:08:54] and it can't be go any further we just
[1:08:56] have to wait a minute until
[1:08:58] this happens over here to catch up then
[1:09:01] the time comes but it's thoroughly
[1:09:02] identified
[1:09:03] so saying just and for this
[1:09:05] manifestation to come we just have to
[1:09:07] wait
[1:09:08] for this what we've been looking at to
[1:09:09] catch up
[1:09:13] there is coming a time upon in this
[1:09:16] nation
[1:09:17] to where this nation is going to
[1:09:18] exercise all the power that the beast
[1:09:20] had before it
[1:09:22] which was pagan rome when it become
[1:09:24] papal rome
[1:09:25] see that this nation will do that
[1:09:27] revelation 13 plainly explains it
[1:09:30] the lamb come up out of the earth the
[1:09:32] other beasts come up out of the water
[1:09:34] thickness and multitudes of people this
[1:09:36] lamb come up where there were no people
[1:09:39] the lamb represents a religion the lamb
[1:09:41] of god and remember it spoke like a land
[1:09:43] it was a lamb
[1:09:45] and then after a while it received power
[1:09:47] and spoke like a dragon
[1:09:49] and exercised all the dragon power the
[1:09:51] dragon had before him
[1:09:53] and the dragon is rome always so don't
[1:09:56] you see roman denomination
[1:09:57] a mark protestant denomination an image
[1:10:00] unto the beast
[1:10:02] making a power that will force all
[1:10:04] protestants like a union
[1:10:06] you'll have to be into this council of
[1:10:08] churches or you won't be able to have
[1:10:10] fellowship
[1:10:14] and getting through what i want to read
[1:10:15] in these quotes well it's practically
[1:10:17] that way now
[1:10:18] you can't go to a church and preach
[1:10:20] unless you have a fellowship card or
[1:10:22] some identification
[1:10:24] and now on persons like ourselves we're
[1:10:26] going to be cut out of that altogether
[1:10:28] that's exactly because they won't be
[1:10:30] able to do it it's tightening and then
[1:10:32] when that time comes when the press
[1:10:34] comes to a place where you're pressed
[1:10:36] out
[1:10:36] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[1:10:38] in a few minutes
[1:10:40] watch the third pull then see and it
[1:10:42] will absolutely be absolutely to the
[1:10:45] total loss
[1:10:46] but it will be for the bride and the
[1:10:47] church now we are closer than it seems
[1:10:50] i don't know when but it's real real
[1:10:52] close i may be building a platform for
[1:10:55] somebody else to step on
[1:10:57] i might be taken away before that time i
[1:10:59] don't know
[1:11:00] and that time maybe this coming week
[1:11:03] that the holy spirit will come
[1:11:04] and bring christ jesus and he may come
[1:11:07] the next week
[1:11:08] he may come here tonight i don't know
[1:11:10] when he will come he doesn't tell us
[1:11:11] that
[1:11:12] but i do believe that we're so close
[1:11:16] that i would never die with old age yet
[1:11:19] at 54 years old i'll never die with old
[1:11:22] age until he is here
[1:11:24] just like how brother ben was saying um
[1:11:26] on sunday
[1:11:27] about israel becoming a nation and it
[1:11:29] would come up and brother brennan is now
[1:11:31] tying it in as well
[1:11:32] it's like an extra vindication on it
[1:11:35] until he's come and believe that and i
[1:11:37] want to say this i've never said it
[1:11:39] before but according to scripture
[1:11:41] according to what he said 30 years ago
[1:11:43] 33 years ago on the river down there
[1:11:45] in 1933 rather what he said everything
[1:11:48] has happened just exactly
[1:11:50] i may not do it but this message will
[1:11:52] introduce jesus
[1:11:54] christ to the world amen for as john the
[1:11:56] baptist was sent before on the first
[1:11:58] coming so was this message sent
[1:12:00] message to forerun the second coming
[1:12:02] amen and john said behold the lamb of
[1:12:04] god that takes away the sin of the world
[1:12:07] see so it is paralleled in every way i
[1:12:09] know it will
[1:12:10] the message will go on amen
[1:12:13] so now you have to become the message to
[1:12:16] the world
[1:12:17] you become christ to the world so why
[1:12:20] are you struggling
[1:12:23] so why use why are you in trials because
[1:12:26] you have to become pure oil
[1:12:28] you have to become christ
[1:12:32] you know why does each day seem just a
[1:12:33] little bit harder
[1:12:35] than the day before you know why does
[1:12:37] each trial seem worse than the last one
[1:12:42] maybe you don't feel like that but i
[1:12:44] know i feel like there you go
[1:12:47] well again another trial you know why me
[1:12:52] but until we come to that maturity that
[1:12:54] we can manifest the same things that
[1:12:56] christ did
[1:12:57] you can say well i don't go through any
[1:12:58] trials it's like well
[1:13:02] you're probably just about to go into
[1:13:03] one it's almost like saying hey can i
[1:13:06] have a triumph
[1:13:09] unless you can show me that you're doing
[1:13:11] exactly the same things as christ did
[1:13:13] right now
[1:13:14] okay now you're pretty some pretty good
[1:13:16] oil there you know
[1:13:17] olivani
[1:13:21] amen so christ is developing character
[1:13:25] and so is the world you know they're
[1:13:27] developing their character they're
[1:13:28] starting to manifest
[1:13:31] what's their portion
[1:13:35] sonic go back now into matthew 21 18
[1:13:39] now in the morning as he returned into
[1:13:41] the city he hungered
[1:13:43] and when he saw a fig tree in the way he
[1:13:45] came to it and found nothing there on
[1:13:47] but leaves only you know i was just
[1:13:50] studying this before service tonight
[1:13:53] well today and the fig tree we know the
[1:13:56] figures
[1:13:57] fig trees israel the trees and man
[1:13:59] anyway but this tree you come to had no
[1:14:01] fruit
[1:14:03] and that's like the church that had no
[1:14:05] fruit and come to this tree this victory
[1:14:06] no fruit
[1:14:08] and he said unto it let no fruit grow on
[1:14:11] the henceforth forever
[1:14:13] and presently the fig tree withered away
[1:14:16] and when the disciples saw it they
[1:14:17] marveled saying how soon is the fig tree
[1:14:19] withered away
[1:14:20] jesus answered and said unto them verily
[1:14:23] i say unto you
[1:14:24] if you have faith and doubt not ye shall
[1:14:27] not only
[1:14:28] do this which is done to the fig tree
[1:14:30] but also ye shall say unto this mountain
[1:14:32] be removed and be cast into the sea and
[1:14:34] it shall be done
[1:14:35] so now jesus is putting it on you
[1:14:38] because part of that third poll was to
[1:14:40] preach to the souls that are in prison
[1:14:41] now
[1:14:42] as it comes up to a time there's no
[1:14:44] fruit left for a short space of time i
[1:14:46] don't know the details we don't
[1:14:47] i don't really have details but there's
[1:14:49] a space of time where we have to preach
[1:14:51] to the total lost
[1:14:52] because the image has been made up to
[1:14:54] the beast people are starting to worship
[1:14:56] the image
[1:14:57] and there's no return for them and
[1:14:59] that's part of the third pull
[1:15:01] and then also we're going to speak say
[1:15:03] to this mountain be thou removed and it
[1:15:04] will be removed
[1:15:06] amen so could you say to yourself
[1:15:10] um could you just speak to that mountain
[1:15:12] and it moves
[1:15:14] or is there some more maturing to be
[1:15:16] done you know i've been honest because
[1:15:18] i could i say to myself you know if i've
[1:15:20] got a trial my car's broke
[1:15:22] it's not going anymore i need a brand
[1:15:24] new car just appear boom done
[1:15:28] and i could say i have the faith for
[1:15:30] that because it's a seed that's already
[1:15:31] in here right i have the faith for it
[1:15:33] but it's going to come up to an actual
[1:15:35] maturity where i couldn't speak that and
[1:15:37] it will happen
[1:15:38] but brother branham says you know
[1:15:39] there's a law that's stopping it because
[1:15:41] if you have that power now without
[1:15:42] character
[1:15:43] you know i'll just create the south
[1:15:44] island like just up the road and i'll
[1:15:46] just go live up there
[1:15:47] you know like we have to have the
[1:15:48] character to be able to use that
[1:15:51] amen pressure is what's going to create
[1:15:55] it
[1:15:55] and you know the pressure is coming on
[1:15:57] the earth as well
[1:15:59] because it's about to give birth to a
[1:16:01] new one and scientists call it global
[1:16:03] warming
[1:16:04] and i kind of thought it was
[1:16:08] was quite funny people were arguing
[1:16:09] saying well it's not global warming
[1:16:11] because
[1:16:12] it rains more and there's more storms
[1:16:14] but
[1:16:15] that's what global warming does because
[1:16:16] as the sun backs upon
[1:16:19] the earth the earth heats up and then
[1:16:21] the moisture goes up and then it forms
[1:16:23] into clouds
[1:16:24] and then there's more moisture in the
[1:16:25] air and it's all going to fall back down
[1:16:26] and it's just this
[1:16:28] revolving cycle that's speeding up and
[1:16:30] getting faster and i thought you know
[1:16:32] the bride's going through global warming
[1:16:33] you know the sun's starting to bake the
[1:16:35] bride
[1:16:36] and the bride's heating up and the
[1:16:37] prayers are going up and creating
[1:16:39] rain and the revelations coming down and
[1:16:41] speeding up and speeding up
[1:16:43] you know the whole earth the heavenly
[1:16:46] powers the satanic powers everything's
[1:16:48] manifesting and everything's getting
[1:16:50] ready
[1:16:51] for this age we love them
[1:16:56] amen so i want to see these things
[1:17:02] happen before my eyes you know i want to
[1:17:04] see these things happen in church
[1:17:06] like i said where we see these
[1:17:07] supernatural holy ghost-filled meetings
[1:17:10] just let the trials come you know it's
[1:17:13] so easy to get so down on a trial and
[1:17:15] just
[1:17:16] you know oh this sucks because it does
[1:17:19] but we just have to use that and so lord
[1:17:21] develop my character
[1:17:24] and you know it's probably going to take
[1:17:27] some sacrifice on our part as well
[1:17:29] because sometimes when you're going
[1:17:30] through a trial you know why you're
[1:17:31] going through the trial
[1:17:33] yeah i'm going through the trial because
[1:17:35] i'm not dedicating enough of my time or
[1:17:38] whatever your trial is and if you just
[1:17:41] carry on going you don't develop the
[1:17:43] character
[1:17:44] that god is trying to develop and you go
[1:17:45] from that trial into the next trial and
[1:17:48] henceforth the saying goes you're either
[1:17:49] coming out of a trial or going into a
[1:17:51] trial or in a trial like
[1:17:53] you know so we should learn from our
[1:17:55] trials just say
[1:17:56] lord i just want to be honest and lay
[1:17:58] before you and
[1:18:00] lord what what do you want to do just
[1:18:02] come and work with me lord
[1:18:04] i don't want to go around the block amen
[1:18:09] and then after a while all these trials
[1:18:11] of life are going to seem quite small
[1:18:14] amen the faith that started as just a
[1:18:16] little mustard seed
[1:18:17] will grow into a big mighty tree amen
[1:18:22] amen so if you're going through some
[1:18:24] hard times don't get too down you know
[1:18:26] just remember god's stirring the nest
[1:18:28] because he's gotta
[1:18:29] you're either gonna get ready to get out
[1:18:30] of the nest and fly or
[1:18:33] get pushed out you have to learn to fly
[1:18:38] hey amen i'm just going to bring it to a
[1:18:40] close i've seen what i need to say i
[1:18:42] don't
[1:18:42] speak long sermons i just straight to
[1:18:44] the point overwhelm you
[1:18:47] you can go and look at it later or ask
[1:18:49] me questions
[1:18:52] so as the musicians come i just want to
[1:18:53] read the scripture again
[1:18:55] but take heed to yourselves for they
[1:18:57] shall deliver you up to councils and the
[1:18:59] sin
[1:19:00] and in the synagogues you shall be
[1:19:01] beaten and you shall be brought before
[1:19:03] rulers and kings for my sakes
[1:19:05] but this is the important part for a
[1:19:07] testimony against them
[1:19:08] because you are a testimony and you have
[1:19:10] to manifest christ on earth
[1:19:12] and he was rejected in his first coming
[1:19:14] and he'll be rejected in the second
[1:19:16] coming
[1:19:16] and when they reject you they reject
[1:19:18] christ
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:26] maybe we could sing that song the battle
[1:19:28] is the lord's
[1:19:41] uh d
[1:19:45] are the battleless the lords
