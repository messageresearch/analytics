[39:08] next world. We praise you for that,
[39:10] Lord. Glory to your name, Lord God.
[39:14] Father, I pray you'd comfort Brother
[39:15] Quebe and the family as well, Lord, as
[39:18] his father is gone from this world.
[39:20] Lord, comfort him, Lord. Give them
[39:21] greater peace, Lord. Bless them in the
[39:24] family, Lord. We thank you for them,
[39:26] Lord. We so glad they're here. Lord,
[39:29] Lord, in our lives. Pray you bless them
[39:30] immeasurably, Lord, this day. Give them
[39:32] the desires of their hearts, Lord.
[39:34] Father, may you grant it, Lord. And we
[39:37] commit the service into your hands,
[39:38] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[39:42] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[39:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Well,
[39:49] it's great to have brother Matthew,
[39:50] sister Naomi here. We part of the
[39:52] furniture, but it's good to say welcome.
[39:54] Amen. God bless you. Amen. M and Bethany
[39:57] as well. God bless you. Great to have
[39:58] you here as always. Hallelujah. Amen. If
[40:02] you got your Bibles handy, um let's just
[40:05] go
[40:06] to the book of Judges. So, everyone's
[40:09] welcome to come back to our place for
[40:11] for lunch after the service as
[40:14] well. Amen.
[40:17] You know, it's so good. Doesn't matter
[40:19] what kind of week or morning we had, God
[40:22] is still good. And he's still in
[40:24] control. Hallelujah.
[40:27] Amen. Judges
[40:29] 16 verses 23 down to 30. And then we'll
[40:32] go to Romans chapter 6 and verse one.
[40:36] says, "Then the
[40:37] lords of the Philistines gathered
[40:39] themselves
[40:41] together for to offer a great sacrifice
[40:44] unto Dagen their god and to rejoice. For
[40:47] they said, "Our God hath delivered
[40:49] Samson our enemy into our hand." And
[40:51] when the people saw him, they praised
[40:53] their God, and they said, "Our God has
[40:54] delivered into our hands our enemy and
[40:57] the destroyer of our country, which slew
[40:59] many of us." And it came to pass when
[41:01] their hearts were merry that they said,
[41:03] "Call for Samson that he may make a
[41:06] sport." And they called for Samson out
[41:08] of the prison house, and uh he made them
[41:11] sport. And they set him between the
[41:13] pillars. And Samson said unto the lad
[41:15] that led him by the hand, suffer me that
[41:18] I may feel the pillars whereupon the
[41:20] house standeth, that I may lean upon
[41:22] them. Now the house was full of men and
[41:24] women, and all the lords of the
[41:26] Philistines were there. And there were
[41:28] upon the roof about 3,000 men and women
[41:32] that beheld while Samson made sport. And
[41:35] Samson called unto the Lord and said,
[41:36] "Oh Lord God, remember me, I pray thee,
[41:39] and strengthen me, I pray thee only this
[41:42] once, oh God, that I may be at once
[41:45] avenged of the Philistines for my two
[41:47] eyes." And the Lord took uh sorry and
[41:50] Samson took hold of the two middle
[41:52] pillars upon which the house stood and
[41:55] on and on which it was bore up of one of
[41:59] with his right hand, the other with his
[42:01] left. And Samson said, "Let me die with
[42:03] the Philistines." And he bowed him and
[42:06] he bowed himself with all his might, and
[42:08] the house fell upon the lords and upon
[42:10] all the people that were therein. though
[42:13] the dead which he slew at his death were
[42:17] more than they which he slew in his
[42:20] life. Let's go to Romans 6 and and verse
[42:25] one and we're going to be referring back
[42:28] to uh Samson a bit during the
[42:33] service. Romans 6 and1 we're going to
[42:35] read down to verse
[42:39] 11 says, "What shall we say then? Shall
[42:42] we continue in sin that grace may
[42:44] abound? God forbid. How shall we that
[42:47] are dead to sin live any longer therein?
[42:50] Know ye not that so many of us as were
[42:52] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[42:55] into his death? Therefore we are buried
[42:57] with him by baptism into death, that
[43:00] like as Christ was raised up from the
[43:02] dead by the glory of the father, even so
[43:05] we also should walk in newness of life.
[43:09] For if we have been planted together in
[43:11] the likeness of his death, we shall be
[43:14] also in the likeness of his
[43:16] resurrection, knowing this, that our old
[43:18] man is crucified with him, that the body
[43:21] of sin might be destroyed, that
[43:23] henceforth we should not serve sin. For
[43:26] he that is dead is free from sin.
[43:30] Now if we be dead with Christ, we
[43:32] believe we shall also we also sorry we
[43:36] shall also live with him, knowing that
[43:38] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[43:40] no more. Death hath no more dominion
[43:42] over him. For in that he died, he died
[43:46] unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he
[43:48] liveth under God. Likewise reckon ye
[43:51] also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
[43:54] sin, but alive unto God through Jesus
[43:57] Christ our Lord. Now, let's just read
[44:01] verse seven alto together of Romans 6.
[44:04] For he that is dead is freed from sin.
[44:08] Amen. So, if you're dead, you're free.
[44:11] Amen. May the Lord bless his word. You
[44:12] may uh have your
[44:15] seats. And that's really my title this
[44:18] morning is he that is dead is free from
[44:22] sin. Yes. Amen.
[44:24] Now, and and if I could pose a question
[44:27] to you this morning, are you dead?
[44:30] If you're dead, you're free from sin. If
[44:32] you're alive, sin has dominion over you.
[44:35] But if you're dead in Christ, you're
[44:37] free. So, are you dead? Amen. See, many
[44:40] times people just get wounded. They get
[44:42] convicted. You know, they may they may
[44:44] cry. They may have emotional time, but
[44:46] they don't die. They just get wounded.
[44:49] But a sacrifice must be dead. Amen. So
[44:52] it's very, you know, you look at
[44:54] Samson, it must have been an incredible
[44:57] scene to watch that day. Here was a
[44:59] great celebration. You know, the
[45:01] Philistines are very happy that day.
[45:04] This was a this was a victory
[45:05] celebration. But it was not the children
[45:08] of God celebrating. It was their enemies
[45:11] this time that would be celebrating. For
[45:13] they had finally found a way to get the
[45:15] victory over their enemy. Their enemy
[45:18] was just one man. Incredible, isn't it?
[45:21] a whole nation and one man could could
[45:23] beat them around however he really
[45:25] wanted. You know, the Philistines were
[45:28] greater in in military might than the
[45:31] Israelites, but they couldn't defeat
[45:32] this one man. This was the man who would
[45:35] take a jawbone of a of a of a donkey of
[45:38] an ass. And he would slay a thousand of
[45:40] their armed soldiers. This man would
[45:43] carry the gates of Gaza upon his
[45:45] shoulders. And not just carry the gates,
[45:47] he'd rip them off their hinges, then
[45:48] carry them away. Amen. Hallelujah. This
[45:51] man could not be defeated by strength.
[45:54] Amen. And even even in, you know, in
[45:56] Judges 15 and 13, when when the children
[45:58] of Israel, they they bound they bound
[46:01] Samson with two new cords. And then the
[46:04] Israelites went to offer him to the
[46:07] Philistines. You know, it says when the
[46:09] Philistines shouted against him, the
[46:11] spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
[46:13] him and he broke the cords that he was
[46:15] bound with and he picked up the new
[46:16] jawbone of an ass and he slew a thousand
[46:19] men. So when the enemy tried to come
[46:20] against them and they made their boast,
[46:22] now we've got you. Now we'll destroy
[46:24] you. Amen. That's when the anointing
[46:26] came upon him. Amen. Hallelujah. And he
[46:29] killed a thousand men. And I want to say
[46:31] this, this is exactly the same as the
[46:33] bride of Christ. Amen. Amen. that
[46:35] there's no weapon that is formed against
[46:37] you that shall prosper. Amen. She will
[46:40] not be defeated. Hallelujah. She will be
[46:42] victorious in every circumstance. Amen.
[46:45] There is no weapon the devil can build
[46:47] that can defeat you. Amen. Amen. There
[46:49] is nothing, no enemy can stand before
[46:51] the bride of Christ. Not one. Amen.
[46:54] Because their chief captain defeated
[46:56] hell, death, and the grave. Amen.
[46:57] Everything that could be defeated was
[46:59] defeated. Hallelujah. And he made an
[47:02] open show. He openly spoiled the
[47:04] principalities of the enemy. Hallelujah.
[47:06] He vanquished Satan. He defeated hell.
[47:08] He defeated the grave. Nothing could
[47:10] contain him. Amen. And because I live,
[47:12] he said, "You shall live also."
[47:14] Hallelujah. So nothing can stand before
[47:17] you. Amen. Amen. The prophet of God was
[47:19] told by the angel of the Lord when he
[47:21] was commissioned, "If you're sincere
[47:22] when you pray, nothing will stand before
[47:24] you, not even cancer." Amen. And every
[47:27] enemy that came into the presence of
[47:28] that prophet, Amen. when the angel of
[47:30] the Lord was there was defeated.
[47:33] Hallelujah. And that same God that
[47:35] anointed the prophet is upon the bride.
[47:37] Amen. That very same God that does the
[47:39] same things. He's not a weaker angel, a
[47:41] lesser angel, the angel of the covenant.
[47:44] The Lord Jesus Christ is anointed as
[47:46] bride. Hallelujah. Dwells in her. Amen.
[47:49] Hallelujah. Amen. So, no weapon could
[47:51] defeat Samson. Amen. When he was a
[47:53] Nazerite. No weapon could defeat him
[47:56] when he was separated unto God. Not one.
[47:58] Amen. All of their devices came to
[48:00] nothing. Yeah.
[48:02] Amen. It says in Isaiah 59:19, the B
[48:05] part of the verse says, "When the enemy
[48:06] shall come and like a flood, the spirit
[48:08] of the Lord shall lift up a standard
[48:09] against him." And the enemy came to get
[48:11] Samson and they shouted at him. Amen. In
[48:14] the presence of his enemy, making a
[48:15] boast cause the anointing to come
[48:17] mightily upon him. He was like any other
[48:19] man until the anointing came upon him.
[48:21] Amen. It's like Goliath. He said one
[48:23] day, "Bring me a man." He made a
[48:25] challenge for 40 days. Then one day that
[48:28] challenge fell on the wrong ears. Fell
[48:30] on predestinated ears. And those ears,
[48:32] Amen. that one who had those ears was
[48:34] predestinated, ordained to kill kill
[48:37] that enemy. Hallelujah. So the boast,
[48:40] when the enemy makes a boast, he's just
[48:42] really just he's he's causing the
[48:44] anointing of God to fall upon you. Amen.
[48:46] Because God is not afraid of a
[48:48] challenge. God loves a challenge. That's
[48:50] why he made his enemy like he is. He
[48:53] didn't make some weak little enemy. He
[48:54] actually made quite a powerful master of
[48:56] deceit. We can't defeat him in our own
[48:58] strength. Amen. He's a slicker. You need
[49:01] God. You need God in your life to defeat
[49:03] Satan. Amen. Hallelujah. But now, but
[49:07] the enemy found his weakness. He found
[49:09] Samson's
[49:10] weakness. And then he used that weakness
[49:13] against him. And there he finds himself
[49:17] now blinded, the laughingtock of his
[49:21] enemies. But why is this? How did it
[49:23] come to this? Simply because he was not
[49:26] completely
[49:27] dead. He had not brother Baron would say
[49:30] in going beyond the camp
[49:32] 1964 says the Bible said that he watches
[49:35] over his word to confirm it. He's trying
[49:38] to find someone if he can just get a
[49:40] half-hearted man like Samson. Samson
[49:43] surrendered his strength to God, but he
[49:46] gave his heart to Delilah. Yes, that's
[49:48] right. That's the way many times we do
[49:50] today. Just give something to God, but
[49:53] not all. Amen. But God wants all of us.
[49:57] Like an insurance policy, when you get
[49:59] an insurance policy, you might as well
[50:00] get full coverage. And that's what this
[50:03] blessed assurance does for us. It's a
[50:05] full coverage policy. It covers all we
[50:07] have need of in this life and our
[50:09] resurrection and eternal life. It
[50:11] includes everything. Amen. So Samson
[50:14] only gave part of himself to God.
[50:17] And it's the same thing today.
[50:22] He had to
[50:24] die. Remember, he was always down in the
[50:27] Philistines chasing some girl around. He
[50:30] was always down there. And his parents
[50:31] like, "Are there not good enough young
[50:34] ladies here you can marry?" But there's
[50:36] something in him. And that thing the
[50:39] devil used causes his eyes to come out
[50:42] and there he is a laughingtock. The
[50:45] devil has studied you. The devil knows
[50:49] humanity better than we know ourselves.
[50:52] He has studied humanity from the garden
[50:55] down to now. And the longer you study
[50:58] something, then normally the more
[50:59] knowledge you get about it. And you can
[51:01] refine your methods. You can refine your
[51:04] way of doing things. And then when you
[51:06] need to go in for the kill, you can just
[51:07] do it real easy. And so he's been
[51:10] studying us.
[51:12] But if we're
[51:13] alive, then the enemy that's against us
[51:16] can defeat us. But if we're dead, we're
[51:19] free. Amen. If we're dead, that enemy
[51:22] has no hold over us. Amen. Now, I'm not
[51:24] talking about physical death here. I'm
[51:26] talking about being spiritually dead.
[51:27] I'm being I'm talking about being dead
[51:29] in Christ. Right? Being dead in Christ.
[51:32] Now, if we are truly if we are truly
[51:38] dead, then the enemy cannot get you.
[51:40] Yeah. And if you are truly dead and the
[51:42] enemy comes around again, you just got
[51:44] to say to him, "Hey, I'm dead." Amen. If
[51:47] I was dead on the floor here, you could
[51:49] kick me. It wouldn't bother me. You
[51:51] could make fun of me. It wouldn't bother
[51:53] me. You could do whatever you wanted. It
[51:55] wouldn't bother me cuz I'm dead. Amen.
[51:58] And the enemy would come against me. If
[52:00] I'm alive, it' make f do whatever he
[52:03] wanted and it would bother me. But if
[52:05] I'm dead, it doesn't bother me. I'm not
[52:06] there anymore. Amen. Amen. And so it's
[52:09] it's got to be the same thing. So you
[52:11] say, "But I am dead." Well, you got to
[52:13] reckon yourself dead. Reckon that. And
[52:15] you got to say, "Satan, I'm dead. I no
[52:17] longer live in this place." Amen. I'm
[52:20] going to read what the Apostle Paul said
[52:21] about himself. He didn't say, "I'm I'm
[52:24] here anymore. It's no longer I that
[52:26] liveth, but Christ that liveth in me."
[52:28] So he's saying that that old man is
[52:31] dead. Crucify the old man. Amen.
[52:34] Hallelujah. Kill him. Kill him and
[52:36] you'll have victory. Amen. Just like
[52:39] Samson, he killed more in his death. You
[52:42] know, he did incredible things in his
[52:43] life. He killed a lot of people. He
[52:45] killed a lot of enemies, did he not? But
[52:48] in his death, he had to, in order to
[52:50] overcome that thing that had him bound,
[52:52] he had to die with it. And many times we
[52:55] look at the enemy, we say, "This enemy
[52:56] is after me and he's on my case and I
[52:58] can't be free and this thing keeps
[53:00] fighting me and bombarding me. How do I
[53:02] get rid of it?" Die. Amen. That's the
[53:04] only thing. You just got to die to your
[53:06] own thinking. Die to your own ambitions.
[53:09] Die to what you want. Lay it all upon
[53:11] the altar. Then that enemy won't be a
[53:13] problem anymore. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[53:15] It is your death that frees you. Amen.
[53:18] Your death frees you. Hallelujah. I want
[53:21] to kill this serpent that's biting me.
[53:23] Die. Amen. Just die upon God's altar.
[53:25] That's all you need to do. Amen.
[53:28] Hallelujah. In in James
[53:30] 1:13, let no man say that he is tempted.
[53:33] I am tempted of God. For God cannot be
[53:35] tempted with evil, neither tempted he
[53:38] but he he any man. But every man is
[53:40] tempted when he is drawn away by his own
[53:43] lust and enticed. This is someone alive.
[53:47] He's you know then when lust has
[53:50] conceived it brings forth uh sin and sin
[53:52] when it is finished bringeth forth
[53:55] death. What happened to Samson? He is in
[53:57] he was drawn away by his own lust and
[54:00] there he finds himself. There he finds
[54:03] himself in that place. Samson's biggest
[54:05] enemy was himself. It wasn't the
[54:07] Philistines.
[54:09] Amen. The biggest enemy you have this
[54:11] morning is you. That's right. You are
[54:13] public enemy number one. You are. Not
[54:17] the devil. Oh, hell's open itself in
[54:19] this last day. The bottomless pit's
[54:20] open. Yeah, but that's not your biggest
[54:22] enemy. It's you. You are the biggest
[54:24] enemy. Who cares if hell's literally
[54:26] become manifested upon the earth? It's
[54:29] you, the enemy.
[54:32] Amen. The biggest battle, the the
[54:34] biggest one you have to overcome is you.
[54:37] And once you overcome yourself, then you
[54:39] have the victory. Amen. That's right.
[54:42] And power of decision. This is the
[54:44] sermon, the power of decision. 1955.
[54:47] It's incredible. He's preaching about
[54:48] the power. I think in this series, he
[54:50] preaches about the power of God and the
[54:52] power of the devil and the power of
[54:54] decision. And he says, I just read this.
[54:57] We don't care about the routine. get in
[54:59] the spirit then we can see things done.
[55:03] An old prophet one time got all stirred
[55:05] up because somebody came to him. It
[55:06] wasn't right for him to come. He got all
[55:08] of his righteous indign indignation up.
[55:11] And you know what he did before the
[55:13] spirit came on him. He had to go sing
[55:15] some good old uh good spiritual songs.
[55:18] Then he got in the spirit and begin to
[55:20] see things. He saw some visions. I tell
[55:22] you, brother, life will look a lot
[55:24] different when the church gets in the
[55:26] spirit. That's right. and gets out of
[55:28] itself and the routine that you're in.
[55:30] Amen. Lay aside those weights. You got
[55:33] to find uh you got to find out the
[55:37] ladies aid society has their dinner next
[55:39] week and what you've got to do. Lay
[55:41] aside those things. Give me give time to
[55:44] old-fashioned heartfelt pouring out to
[55:47] the Lord Jesus Christ until the Holy
[55:49] Spirit pours down into your soul. You'll
[55:52] get beside yourself. Maybe you can get
[55:54] with Jesus if you get away from yourself
[55:57] once. Amen. You can't be with yourself
[56:00] in Jesus. You find out you're the
[56:03] biggest enemy you've got. If I can get
[56:06] William Brandham out of the way, Jesus
[56:08] can do have a wonderful time. I liked
[56:10] how he said that. That's why you because
[56:11] he says it a few times. Jesus can have a
[56:13] Who wants Jesus to have a wonderful
[56:15] time? Not just from 10 till about 12:30
[56:18] on a Sunday or Wednesday night. 24/7.
[56:22] Hallelujah. Yeah, you wake up in the
[56:23] middle of night. How you doing, Lord?
[56:24] I'm having a wonderful time. Glory to
[56:26] God. Have your way. Hallelujah. Oh,
[56:30] glory. You may think I'm crazy, but I'm
[56:32] happy. Hallelujah. Amen. You never, you
[56:36] know. Amen. But you, but you got to get
[56:39] him, get him out of the way. Speak of
[56:41] yourself. So when you start, see, they
[56:43] started go through on light foot and
[56:45] feeling wonderful. Why? They were
[56:47] following the pillar of fire, God going
[56:50] before them. So he's saying that if the
[56:54] biggest enemy we
[56:56] have, he said the biggest enemy I have
[56:58] is William Brandham. Now I said last
[57:00] Sunday about Jesus felt uncomfortable in
[57:03] in in Simon the Pharisees house. Now we
[57:07] just bring that right on home. We were
[57:08] talking about it after the service. Does
[57:11] Jesus feel comfortable in our lives?
[57:15] Does Jesus feel comfortable by what we
[57:17] dress, what we watch, where we go, what
[57:21] we say, how we treat one another. Does
[57:24] he feel comfortable? Yeah. Amen. You got
[57:27] to think about it cuz oh, the Pharisee.
[57:29] Oh, Simon the Pharisee and pride and
[57:32] Yeah. But does he feel comfortable in
[57:33] your address? Amen. When you go home and
[57:36] you do whatever you do in your free
[57:38] time, would he feel comfortable like
[57:40] that? Would he feel comfortable to be
[57:42] right there and do do whatever you're
[57:44] doing? Would he say, "I'm enjoying some
[57:46] fellowship with my son or daughter right
[57:48] now. This is such a glorious time. Put
[57:51] your name there. I love this." Would he
[57:53] feel comfortable? Amen. Amen. Because if
[57:57] he's not comfortable, then it's not You
[57:59] got to die. Something in you needs to
[58:02] die. That's right. We need a killing.
[58:04] Brother Bam says, I'll get down to the
[58:06] quote. He says, "You want a revival
[58:07] first? There's got to be a killing
[58:09] first. There's got to be a killing. Then
[58:11] there can be a revival. Amen. We try and
[58:13] pour in. Pour in. There's got to be an
[58:15] emptying first and a pouring in. Amen.
[58:18] Less of me, more of you, God. I don't
[58:20] want 50% me and 50% him. 100% him. 0%
[58:25] me. Hallelujah. That's what it's got to
[58:28] be. God is going to take vessels. He's
[58:31] going to take dead people to heaven.
[58:33] He's going to take those who are dead in
[58:34] Christ that are fully surrendered that
[58:37] their humanity has no say. Amen. Amen.
[58:39] What? Yeah. What? Don't. We got to stop
[58:41] pandering to this thing. Doesn't mean go
[58:44] be a monk in some shack someplace. But
[58:46] you know, stop pandering to this guy.
[58:50] Amen. There's so much easy living. I say
[58:54] you got to that's a weight. That can be
[58:56] a weight. Amen. When they had Now I know
[59:00] you they used to have all night prayer
[59:03] meetings. People burning on fire for
[59:05] God. Used to be that way. Where's that
[59:08] gone? I'm just posing a question to
[59:10] myself. You know, when I was thinking
[59:12] about these
[59:13] things that those that are dead are free
[59:15] from sin, and I began to think, well, am
[59:17] I dead? Am I still dead? I want to die.
[59:21] Amen. I need to die. I don't want to be
[59:23] alive. I don't know. I'm talking about,
[59:25] you know, this man living. Who's in this
[59:27] house? Who lives at your address? Is it
[59:30] you? If it's you, well, that guy needs
[59:32] to die. Jesus and you can't dwell in the
[59:35] same place.
[59:37] Are you following me? Yes. Hallelujah.
[59:40] You know,
[59:43] we can't be afraid of the unknown.
[59:45] People get comfortable in the rut
[59:47] they're in. Why did they, you know, here
[59:50] comes Israel out of Egypt. They're
[59:51] slaves. Trouble comes in. Oh, let's go
[59:54] back to Egypt. What are they doing? They
[59:56] want wanting to run back into their
[59:57] slavehood again because they were used
[59:59] to it. We don't want to go back. Don't
[1:00:02] go back to a comfort zone. That was
[1:00:04] their comfort zone. You think that's
[1:00:06] crazy? They were beaten. They were
[1:00:07] whipped. They probably half starved and
[1:00:09] whatever more was going on. But that was
[1:00:10] their comfort zone.
[1:00:12] Amen. Don't go back to a comfort zone.
[1:00:15] You say, "I'm scared." That's all right.
[1:00:18] Die. Nothing wants to die. Death is
[1:00:20] never easy, but you got to stay there
[1:00:22] till you're dead.
[1:00:24] Amen.
[1:00:27] Hallelujah. God, get us out of the way.
[1:00:30] Now, he says, "And show us the father."
[1:00:32] He said, "Look, last night when we were
[1:00:34] talking about the works that I do, shall
[1:00:35] you do also." We took the works that he
[1:00:38] did and showed what it was. He promised
[1:00:40] he would be here. You say, "But God
[1:00:42] lived in another age. God lives forever.
[1:00:44] God's eternal. God can't die. They
[1:00:47] killed the body, Jesus, but God raised
[1:00:49] it up again. He's alive forever more.
[1:00:50] His spirit lives in the church today.
[1:00:52] His spirit is here now. His spirit's
[1:00:54] among his people. Do you believe it this
[1:00:56] morning?" Amen. Amen. I believe he's
[1:00:59] here. Amen. I believe he's present.
[1:01:02] Yeah. Amen. Not just cuz I'm saying it.
[1:01:03] I believe he's here. Hallelujah. He's
[1:01:06] here to meet your needs. He's here to
[1:01:08] lead you up Calvary. He's He's here to
[1:01:11] lead you up so you can die. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:14] Amen. Hey, we need a killing. From here
[1:01:17] to wherever. Amen. From the pulpit to
[1:01:19] the janitor. That's what brother Bram
[1:01:21] said. And he put himself in there. Amen.
[1:01:24] Now his spirit's here now. His spirit's
[1:01:26] among his people. He proves himself not
[1:01:29] by something. He could prove himself
[1:01:31] alive by this. He could prove himself
[1:01:33] alive by the sunset. He could prove
[1:01:35] himself alive by his word. He could
[1:01:37] prove himself alive by his spirit that's
[1:01:38] in the building now by men and women who
[1:01:41] commit themselves to him. Who wants to
[1:01:44] prove? Who wants to say, "God, let me
[1:01:46] use me to prove your work. Use me to
[1:01:49] prove you're alive." Amen. Amen.
[1:01:53] You commit yourself to him. Say, "What
[1:01:54] happens, brother? When you see those
[1:01:56] visions, it's nothing in the world, but
[1:01:58] just having a gift to know how to relax
[1:02:01] myself, get William Brandham off to one
[1:02:03] side. That's the biggest enemy I got is
[1:02:05] William Brandham. He's always in my way.
[1:02:07] He's always in God's way. I'll say he
[1:02:10] always gets in God's way. He's too
[1:02:12] tired. He don't want to do this. He
[1:02:14] don't want to He don't want to do that.
[1:02:16] If I can just crucify that guy,
[1:02:19] God can use it. God can use this body.
[1:02:22] Amen. Hallelujah. That's what we want.
[1:02:24] Amen. Amen. That's what we want. Now,
[1:02:28] Samson,
[1:02:32] Samson, you see, he
[1:02:35] truly, if he truly died out to his own
[1:02:38] thinking about or his his own sinful
[1:02:41] desire to get a Philistine girl to marry
[1:02:43] instead of marrying an Israelite, he
[1:02:45] would never have ended up where he did.
[1:02:48] Amen. It wasn't the Philistines that
[1:02:50] caused him to be there. It wasn't
[1:02:52] himself. Right.
[1:02:54] So we can mentally know something is
[1:02:57] wrong and we shouldn't do it. But if we
[1:02:59] don't totally die out to the thing, then
[1:03:03] we will keep going back to it after a
[1:03:05] while. We can mentally know I shouldn't
[1:03:08] do this, I shouldn't do that, I
[1:03:09] shouldn't wear this, I shouldn't say
[1:03:10] this, or watch this. Mentally, but then
[1:03:13] you see people, they they wrestle. I
[1:03:16] know it's wrong, but I can't overcome
[1:03:18] this. I know this is wrong, but I can't
[1:03:19] be free. Why is that? Because they're
[1:03:21] not dead. That's right.
[1:03:23] Amen. There is a there is a power here
[1:03:25] to kill anyone. Amen. Amen. That you can
[1:03:28] be dead in Christ. Amen. Amen. Now, if
[1:03:32] you are dead, as I said, nothing can
[1:03:34] really bother
[1:03:36] you because the things that once plagued
[1:03:39] you, you have to remind see if you who
[1:03:41] is really
[1:03:42] dead. Maybe there's a bit of a challenge
[1:03:44] this ass. Well, I don't know if I really
[1:03:46] am. I trust by the end of when we all
[1:03:48] walk out these doors, everyone will be.
[1:03:50] and make sure they are because if you
[1:03:52] really are dead then don't worry about
[1:03:55] what the devil tries to do to you cuz
[1:03:58] you've got to you've got to tell them I
[1:04:00] reckon myself dead old nature is not
[1:04:02] just I think it's dead it's literally
[1:04:04] being killed the things I once did I
[1:04:07] cannot stand and that is not
[1:04:09] reprogramming your own self or a
[1:04:11] reformation that is God changing your
[1:04:13] nature amen when you sincerely mean Lord
[1:04:16] take my life and make it thine all of my
[1:04:18] ambitions hopes and plans I really lay
[1:04:20] at your feet. Amen. And then he comes
[1:04:22] and meets that. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] Not just in an emotional way, but God
[1:04:26] really meets that. Hallelujah. That's
[1:04:29] why people wrestle and get pulled out
[1:04:30] into the world cuz they're not dead.
[1:04:34] Colossians 3 and three, for ye are dead
[1:04:37] and your life is hid with Christ and
[1:04:39] God. You are dead. Amen.
[1:04:45] Now, Samson had to die to be free.
[1:04:50] We must do the same. He says in a total
[1:04:54] deliverance. Who wants a total
[1:04:55] deliverance? We are called, you know, we
[1:04:58] are not called to walk along even with
[1:05:00] chains on our broken chains on our
[1:05:02] wrists. Those are totally God. We don't
[1:05:04] walk around with just shackles hanging
[1:05:06] off us even though we can run. Those
[1:05:08] things aren't even meant to be there.
[1:05:09] Amen. Hallelujah. So, we are not the the
[1:05:12] believer is not called You are not
[1:05:14] called to be partially free. That's
[1:05:15] right. You're not called to be on home
[1:05:17] detention. You're not called to be on
[1:05:19] parole and have to log in with the devil
[1:05:21] once a week. Here I am. And sign your
[1:05:22] name and meet his conditions. We don't
[1:05:25] meet his conditions. We meet God's
[1:05:26] conditions. Hallelujah. So we are called
[1:05:30] his death made us free. Hallelujah. And
[1:05:33] his life in us now ensures we stay free.
[1:05:36] Hallelujah. And that is that is true.
[1:05:38] You say, "I don't know if that can be
[1:05:40] so." It is so. Why did he die? God
[1:05:43] doesn't share his wife with anyone. God
[1:05:45] does not allow his wife to be
[1:05:46] manhandled. You think he does? No. Man
[1:05:49] tries to raise up and manhandle the
[1:05:51] bride, God takes them away. He does. He
[1:05:53] will not allow his children to be
[1:05:55] manhandled by anything. Hallelujah. He's
[1:05:57] a jealous husband. He's a zealous
[1:06:00] husband. Lord, hallelujah. That makes
[1:06:03] him angry. Why do you think this world
[1:06:04] is going to be wiped out? Cuz God's
[1:06:07] children are here and the devil's tried
[1:06:09] to beat them and trod them down and
[1:06:12] destroy them. Do you think he rejoices
[1:06:14] in that? Do you think he says, "Oh,
[1:06:16] Satan, do what you want. He allows the
[1:06:20] devil to do what he does, but it's
[1:06:22] heaping up judgment upon his head." And
[1:06:25] God is going to pour his wrath out upon
[1:06:27] this world because of what Satan has
[1:06:29] done to God's children. Yes. Amen.
[1:06:33] God is not mocked. Whatever you sow, you
[1:06:37] will reap. And so, what the devil has
[1:06:40] sowed, he's going to reap. That's right.
[1:06:42] Amen. That's why you know God God is not
[1:06:47] indifferent to you. God is not
[1:06:49] indifferent in any way. He may allow you
[1:06:52] like the prodical son to end up in a
[1:06:56] place that you would never originally
[1:06:57] end up in. There he is in a foreign land
[1:07:01] feeding in a an an animal that's an
[1:07:03] unclean animal to him. Such in a
[1:07:06] destitute state that he wish he could
[1:07:07] eat the pig scraps. Yeah. He He may
[1:07:10] allow you to go down there, but he won't
[1:07:12] leave you there. Amen. He won't allow
[1:07:14] you just to stay there and keep going
[1:07:16] on. That was him when And then he came
[1:07:18] to himself. Hallelujah. And he
[1:07:21] recognized I can go back to father's
[1:07:23] house. Amen. I can go back to where I
[1:07:25] was. I'm not worthy to be called a son,
[1:07:27] but I'll go to him anyway. Hallelujah.
[1:07:30] And then so many times we say, "How
[1:07:32] could God ever take us back?" And he
[1:07:33] takes us back. And we think, "Well,
[1:07:35] we'll just be a servant to him." to
[1:07:37] know, friend, he never wanted you to be
[1:07:39] a servant of his. Amen. You're you're my
[1:07:42] wife. I love you. I'm going to lift you
[1:07:43] up. Hallelujah. To where you should be
[1:07:45] in me. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] We are not called to be partially free.
[1:07:52] We are not called. The enemy that has
[1:07:56] plagued us, plagued you, there has to
[1:07:58] come to an end of it. That's right.
[1:08:00] There has to come to an end of it. Amen.
[1:08:02] You say, "Well, this has been years. It
[1:08:05] must come to an end.
[1:08:06] Hallelujah.
[1:08:08] This is in total deliverance in 1959.
[1:08:12] He totally delivered the leper from
[1:08:13] leprosy. Speaking of Jesus now, he
[1:08:15] totally delivered the woman with the
[1:08:17] blood issue from her issue. Glory. He
[1:08:19] totally delivered the world from sin
[1:08:21] when he died at the day of of the
[1:08:23] atonement. He totally delivered every
[1:08:25] sin. He delivered the church. So there's
[1:08:27] no need for us to live under privileged
[1:08:29] people. Why live in a place you're not
[1:08:32] called to live?
[1:08:34] Why? There's no need for us to live in a
[1:08:36] defeated state. There's no need because
[1:08:38] he because Jesus all paid it all because
[1:08:40] he Why? It's like if you're in a massive
[1:08:43] financial debt, then someone comes along
[1:08:45] and pays off the debt, but you say, "No,
[1:08:47] I want to stay in this way." That's
[1:08:49] crazy. That's crazy. You would accept
[1:08:51] it. You go, "Glory to God. I'm free. I'm
[1:08:54] free from this this pressure and this
[1:08:56] bondage of this debt."
[1:08:58] But some people, they actually say, "No,
[1:09:00] I want to stay in this condition." Why?
[1:09:03] It's the devil lying to them. The devil
[1:09:06] lies to people. You can never be free.
[1:09:08] He says you can't really overcome this.
[1:09:10] You can't really be a victorious
[1:09:12] Christian. That's just that's just a
[1:09:14] hypothetical thing. No, it's not,
[1:09:16] friends. It's a reality. Amen.
[1:09:19] Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] There's no need for us to live in a
[1:09:22] defeated state because he defeated the
[1:09:24] devil and took all the principalities
[1:09:27] and powers and subdued them unto his
[1:09:29] feet and they have no legal rights to
[1:09:32] rule over you. Amen. Hallelujah. We are
[1:09:36] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:39] We don't have uh we don't have the devil
[1:09:43] dictate to us.
[1:09:45] Amen. Don't let the devil dictate
[1:09:47] anything to you. Amen. This is not the
[1:09:50] some kind of agreement. If you do this,
[1:09:52] I'll do this. And if I do this, you got
[1:09:54] to do this. No, we do not negotiate.
[1:09:57] Just like these days, we don't negotiate
[1:09:59] with terrorists. The devil's the biggest
[1:10:01] terrorist there is. We do not negotiate
[1:10:03] with him.
[1:10:05] Oh, he'll he'll he he'll blow up a whole
[1:10:07] city. No, he won't. He's just a bluff.
[1:10:10] That's They're all just like dummy uh
[1:10:12] you know, like props in a movie that
[1:10:14] don't work. That's all he's got. Yeah,
[1:10:16] it is. Oh, I'm going to blow you up. No,
[1:10:18] you're not. You got no bomb. Amen. You
[1:10:21] don't even have anything in your hand.
[1:10:22] You look pretty silly. But if you
[1:10:24] believe his lie, you'll get scared.
[1:10:26] You'll be intimidated. Don't be
[1:10:27] intimidated by him. Amen. Amen. Take the
[1:10:30] word, push him to one side, and walk on.
[1:10:33] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:10:35] We are Christians filled with the Holy
[1:10:37] Ghost. I'll just read this again because
[1:10:38] I like it. We don't have uh we we don't
[1:10:42] have to let the devil dictate to us.
[1:10:44] Christ delivered us. Total deliverance.
[1:10:47] Delivered us from evil. Delivered us
[1:10:49] from sin. Delivered us from habits. And
[1:10:52] I trust you should be saying, "Glory,
[1:10:53] hallelujah. Delivered us from um
[1:10:55] delivered us from from blackard.
[1:10:58] Delivered us from all kinds of smutty
[1:10:59] things. He totally delivered us and put
[1:11:02] us into his holy hands. A complete total
[1:11:05] deliverance. He delivered our sickness.
[1:11:08] He delivered us from sickness. For we
[1:11:10] have an abstract deed to that.
[1:11:11] Hallelujah. For he was wounded for our
[1:11:14] transgressions. With his stripes, we
[1:11:16] were healed. He is our healer. Amen.
[1:11:18] That's why the poor little poly old
[1:11:20] woman trying to take care of a cancer
[1:11:23] dying husband. She walked into the
[1:11:24] realms um she walked into the realms of
[1:11:27] the prince of God. She had faith. Who
[1:11:29] has faith? We are We are sitting in the
[1:11:32] realms of the prince of God this
[1:11:33] morning. Hallelujah. Well, I don't feel
[1:11:36] a whole bunch. Just take him at his
[1:11:37] word. Just say, "Lord, I believe it."
[1:11:40] Amen. You think the woman with the blood
[1:11:41] issue, I got to get to him. M you think
[1:11:44] I don't know how she felt but she would
[1:11:45] have felt pretty weak in her body. She
[1:11:48] had that blood issue a long time. I've
[1:11:50] just got to touch the hem of his
[1:11:51] garment. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:11:53] he's present. His garment is He's
[1:11:55] present. You can touch him by the
[1:11:57] feeling of your infirmity. Yes. Amen. Is
[1:12:00] that not right? That's what the Bible
[1:12:01] tells us. Hallelujah. She walked into
[1:12:04] the realms of the presence of God. Here
[1:12:06] you are sitting in that realm. She had
[1:12:08] faith. The doctors had done all they
[1:12:10] could do. So, she followed God's
[1:12:12] instructions and was totally delivered.
[1:12:15] Hallelujah. The disciples had total
[1:12:17] deliverance. Absolutely total
[1:12:19] deliverance. Who's one of Jesus'
[1:12:21] disciples today? Hallelujah. Amen. The
[1:12:24] same God back there is present. The same
[1:12:26] things they believe, we believe. Amen.
[1:12:28] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Why? So,
[1:12:31] absolutely total deliverance. Why?
[1:12:33] Because they were totally uh they were
[1:12:36] completely and totally filled with the
[1:12:37] Holy Ghost. when you can um when you
[1:12:42] just a church member and shook the
[1:12:44] pastor's hand or some had some kind of
[1:12:46] little experience like jumping, shouting
[1:12:48] or speaking in tongues or something or
[1:12:49] another and still have malice in your
[1:12:51] heart, act strange, telling lies,
[1:12:53] smoking cigarette, lusting after woman,
[1:12:55] that's there's something that hasn't
[1:12:57] happened yet. There's something wrong.
[1:13:00] For he that loves the world or the
[1:13:01] things of the world, the love of God's
[1:13:03] not in him, you've been misled. By their
[1:13:05] fruits you shall know them. You say,
[1:13:08] "Well, how'd they have total
[1:13:09] deliverance?" Because they were totally
[1:13:10] filled with the Holy Ghost. Because
[1:13:12] whenever the enemy came in or there was
[1:13:14] something in their life that God put a
[1:13:15] finger on, then they could give that to
[1:13:17] God and the overcoming power was in them
[1:13:19] to defeat that enemy. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:23] Amen. You just take the You just take
[1:13:25] the children of Israel coming to the
[1:13:26] promised land. That's like brother Bram
[1:13:28] says, when you first when you first
[1:13:29] receive the Holy Ghost, it's like the
[1:13:31] size of a white button and then it grows
[1:13:33] in your life. So they cross the, you
[1:13:35] know, that they cross Jordan and God
[1:13:38] comes down as the captain of the host.
[1:13:39] I've come to take over this battle. I'm
[1:13:41] not for you or against you. I've come to
[1:13:43] take over. I'm in charge of this fight.
[1:13:45] And then he puts a finger on Jericho.
[1:13:47] You know that problem you have now.
[1:13:48] We're going to crush that. Hallelujah.
[1:13:50] Then they go to AI and they go to
[1:13:52] different places. Why? Cuz God puts a
[1:13:53] finger. This has happened. Now you got
[1:13:55] to deal with this in your life. And
[1:13:56] there's this and there's this and
[1:13:58] there's this. And they went and they
[1:13:59] came and they saw and they conquered.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah. They not only just
[1:14:03] conquered, they set up residence. Amen.
[1:14:05] For the Yo, there's a flag flown high
[1:14:07] from the castle of my heart. Amen.
[1:14:10] Because the king is in residence here.
[1:14:12] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I'm so glad
[1:14:15] that's true. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:14:17] Lord. Amen. Romans 12:1. Aren't you glad
[1:14:19] we're in victory? Aren't you glad this
[1:14:21] is a walk of conquest? Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:14:23] You're being overcome more and more.
[1:14:25] Amen. Hallelujah. Now Romans
[1:14:29] 12:1 I beseech so I beseech you
[1:14:32] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[1:14:36] that ye present your bodies a living
[1:14:38] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:14:41] is your reasonable service. Now this is
[1:14:45] what Paul calls us to do. Present your
[1:14:48] bodies a living sacrifice. So that's all
[1:14:50] of you. That's not part of you. It's not
[1:14:53] put your fingers in the flame or put
[1:14:56] your arm in there or maybe h have your
[1:14:58] feet stuck out or your head. The whole
[1:15:00] thing you got to all be on the altar.
[1:15:02] Amen. And this word reasonable, it just
[1:15:05] actually means
[1:15:06] rational, which is actually it's uh it
[1:15:09] it's actually from the word where it's
[1:15:11] logical. This is your logical service.
[1:15:13] This is what you really should just do
[1:15:15] because it makes sense because you can't
[1:15:17] overcome yourself. You can't overcome.
[1:15:19] You cannot overcome anything in your own
[1:15:22] ability. That's why you got to place
[1:15:24] yourself. You say, "Well, I've been a
[1:15:28] Christian a lot." I mean, I mean, yo,
[1:15:30] you know, for many years, well, there
[1:15:32] comes a time, it's like Elijah, I think
[1:15:34] I talked about last Sunday, he rebuilt
[1:15:36] the altar. He repaired the altar of the
[1:15:39] Lord. So, he put the stones, and we know
[1:15:42] a stone is a revelation, right? Stones a
[1:15:44] revelation. So he took the revelation of
[1:15:46] the word, put it in its right order.
[1:15:50] Then he put the wood down. Then the
[1:15:52] sacrifice went on top. And it's like you
[1:15:55] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:15:56] word of God. You begin to hear the word
[1:15:58] and revelation begins to sink into your
[1:16:00] heart. An altar is being formed. But
[1:16:03] then that's not the end of it. Now
[1:16:05] you've got to climb up on that altar.
[1:16:07] Amen. And you've got to die.
[1:16:09] That's what you've got to do.
[1:16:12] And because there's always, you know,
[1:16:13] there there's always a change in a
[1:16:15] Christian walk where you come in, hear
[1:16:17] the word, you rejoice, you're so glad,
[1:16:20] but then there comes a bit of fear and
[1:16:22] intrepidation, but now I have to die.
[1:16:24] But this is so glorious. The Lord has
[1:16:27] descended. Amen. His word has come open.
[1:16:30] You know, he's told me I'm his bride.
[1:16:32] Yeah, but now you got to die. Yeah,
[1:16:34] that's right. Hallelujah. The altar's
[1:16:36] been rebuilt. There's no denominational
[1:16:38] stones. No, no tool of man has come upon
[1:16:41] this altar. This has been rebuilt. Oh,
[1:16:44] it's such a glorious thing. You mean the
[1:16:46] faith of our fathers was here? Yes, it
[1:16:48] was. Hallelujah. But now you've got to
[1:16:51] die. Oh, this is different. And this is
[1:16:55] probably a bit different this morning.
[1:16:58] But you got to die upon the altar. Amen.
[1:17:00] A sacrifice has to be offered. Amen. A
[1:17:04] sacrifice has to be offered. And you are
[1:17:06] the sacrifice. Yep.
[1:17:09] And if you do not, well, I'll just put
[1:17:11] half myself on there. Well, then that's
[1:17:14] not a whole sacrifice.
[1:17:16] You have to present your bodies as a
[1:17:18] living sacrifice. Well, how can I be
[1:17:21] dead and alive at the same time? You
[1:17:23] become dead because what you want is not
[1:17:27] even second place in your life. Amen.
[1:17:30] It's not a this this walk is not a
[1:17:33] democracy. You and God, oh, public
[1:17:35] opinion's changed. you know, I feel, you
[1:17:38] know, I got this new legislation, God, I
[1:17:40] feel I can do this now. That's, oh,
[1:17:43] let's vote on it. No, it doesn't work
[1:17:44] that way. God is king. He's decreed
[1:17:48] things. And so, if your will is contrary
[1:17:50] to his will, there's something wrong.
[1:17:52] And it's not with his will. It's your
[1:17:54] will. Well, how do I get rid of it? Let
[1:17:56] it die. Put it upon the altar.
[1:18:00] Hallelujah.
[1:18:02] Brother Ram says in the
[1:18:04] token he said we're not come together to
[1:18:08] talk about the message. We have come
[1:18:10] together to get in the message and the
[1:18:13] message is Christ. He is the word.
[1:18:15] That's right. We're called to get into
[1:18:17] it. Get beneath it. Yes, sir. That's
[1:18:19] what we're supposed to do. He was not
[1:18:21] responsible for any persons out from
[1:18:23] under the blood. Not one. No matter who
[1:18:25] he was, he was not responsible. All that
[1:18:29] had uh all had to take not only himself
[1:18:32] but his whole family. They're only safe
[1:18:35] when the token was displayed. Now we
[1:18:37] know the token today is the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:40] You must have the token. You must have
[1:18:42] the Holy Ghost in your life in your
[1:18:44] soul. Amen. And you must get your
[1:18:46] children under that token as well. Amen.
[1:18:48] Maybe we'll go into that in some other
[1:18:50] services. You must come under this
[1:18:52] token, God's Holy Spirit. And it
[1:18:54] displays to you Jesus Christ because it
[1:18:57] comes and lives in you. As I said last
[1:18:59] night up in New uh up in New York, one
[1:19:01] of the messages I told you that if
[1:19:03] Shakespeare lived in me, I'd do the
[1:19:05] works of Shakespeare. I couldn't help
[1:19:07] it. I'm no more myself. I'm dead.
[1:19:10] Shakespeare and I can't live together in
[1:19:12] here. Right? Shakespeare was a poet. I'm
[1:19:16] a minister. We can't live together. But
[1:19:18] if I am dead to myself then and
[1:19:20] Shakespeare lives in me, the works of
[1:19:22] Shakespeare I'll do, the life of
[1:19:24] Shakespeare in me will be lived out like
[1:19:27] Shakespeare. If the life of Beth Hovind
[1:19:30] was in me, I'd be Beth Hovind. If the
[1:19:32] life of do John Dillinger lived in me,
[1:19:34] I'd be John Dillinger. That's right. And
[1:19:36] if the life of Jesus Christ lives in the
[1:19:38] person, they become identified with him.
[1:19:41] It's Christ in you. Not a church member,
[1:19:43] not a system, but a resurrected power.
[1:19:45] It's the Holy Ghost as a token upon you
[1:19:48] that your life says amen to every
[1:19:50] scripture. The promise is written in
[1:19:52] there and you're not yourself no more.
[1:19:54] You are Christs. You don't think your
[1:19:56] thoughts. You don't think your thoughts.
[1:19:58] You say, "I think." You have no thought
[1:20:00] coming. The life that was in Christ is
[1:20:02] in you. The mind that was in Christ is
[1:20:04] in you. The works that was in Christ is
[1:20:06] in you. Christ himself is in you. You
[1:20:09] are dead and your life is hid in Christ
[1:20:11] through God. Sealed in there by the Holy
[1:20:13] Ghost. You're not your own. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:16] So, so he Jesus and you can't live in
[1:20:19] the same house together.
[1:20:21] If you're living, he's not living. But
[1:20:23] if he's living, you're not living.
[1:20:25] Hallelujah. Amen. Who wants to see him
[1:20:27] live? Amen. Who wants to see him live?
[1:20:30] Amen. Hallelujah. So, we have to be dead
[1:20:32] and our lives hidden Christ through God.
[1:20:35] And we have the power, God has given,
[1:20:38] released the power that we can be dead.
[1:20:41] That's right. Amen. There's a big
[1:20:43] difference as I said between a sacrifice
[1:20:46] being dead and being wounded.
[1:20:48] We don't just want to get wounded. Just
[1:20:51] get convicted and then be stirred up and
[1:20:53] then go back into our old selves. We
[1:20:56] want to be convinced and then we want to
[1:20:58] be brother Kyra Digs preach a sermon
[1:21:01] collision and impact where we can be
[1:21:03] impacted. We can have a collision with
[1:21:05] something and then your life is
[1:21:07] irreversibly changed because the impact
[1:21:09] of the collision. But then what happened
[1:21:11] when Christ you you had a collision with
[1:21:13] him? What happened with that impact?
[1:21:16] Hallelujah. You see someone who's
[1:21:18] unfortunately been in a car crash, a bad
[1:21:20] one. They can't they can't move like
[1:21:22] they used to move. They probably can't
[1:21:23] eat the same food they used to. They
[1:21:24] think that you maybe even their mental
[1:21:26] faculties can be damaged because they
[1:21:28] were in an impact. Yeah. They were
[1:21:30] collided with something, right? And it's
[1:21:32] the same thing with us. What happened
[1:21:34] with when when God impacted your life?
[1:21:36] Yeah. Amen. Do you walk different? Do
[1:21:38] you talk different? Do you think
[1:21:40] different? Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] I trust you do. Yes. Amen. How dead are
[1:21:47] you?
[1:21:49] Galatians 2:20.
[1:21:51] I am crucified with Christ. Yeah.
[1:21:53] Nevertheless, I live yet not I but
[1:21:56] Christ liveth in me. And the life which
[1:21:58] I now live in the flesh I live by the
[1:22:00] faith of the son of God who loved me and
[1:22:03] gave himself for me. So he says, I am
[1:22:05] crucified. Have you seen imagine you
[1:22:07] would have seen a picture of someone
[1:22:08] being crucified? They're pinned to a
[1:22:10] tree, pinned to a piece of wood. They
[1:22:12] can't
[1:22:13] move. They're pinned up there. They're
[1:22:15] dead after a while. And so if our lives
[1:22:18] are crucified, then our old nature can't
[1:22:22] live anymore. And don't try and
[1:22:24] resurrect that guy. Don't try and
[1:22:26] resuscitate him. Keep him dead. Keep him
[1:22:30] pinned up on that cross. Whatever you
[1:22:32] do, so he says it. So the faith, the
[1:22:35] life I now live in the flesh, I live by
[1:22:37] the faith of the son of God. So to live
[1:22:40] by the faith of the son of God is not
[1:22:42] human faith, but it's it's God's faith
[1:22:44] in you. And he lives God lives by his
[1:22:47] word, right? So it's not many people can
[1:22:50] quote that scripture, but you know, it's
[1:22:53] got to be more than just quoting a
[1:22:55] scripture. The life I now live, I live
[1:22:57] by the faith of the son of God. Well,
[1:22:59] what does that mean? That means you have
[1:23:02] his you live what his word says, right?
[1:23:06] But it's not you living it, it's him in
[1:23:08] you. Amen. That's why that's why it's
[1:23:12] not hard for
[1:23:14] me to never wear shorts again.
[1:23:17] It's not hard. It's not hard. It's not
[1:23:20] hard for me never to drink again. It's
[1:23:22] not hard for me never to listen to rock
[1:23:24] and roll music again. It's not hard for
[1:23:26] me never to go to the movies again.
[1:23:29] I could keep going down the list, but
[1:23:31] it's not hard for me to to to not do
[1:23:34] those things again because I died.
[1:23:36] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm not in bondage to
[1:23:39] those things anymore because I died. I
[1:23:41] didn't have to say thou shalt, thou
[1:23:42] shalt not. And you know, how can I how
[1:23:45] can I arrange my life to keep those
[1:23:47] things from me? Some people do. That's
[1:23:50] right. You don't That's not being dead.
[1:23:52] That's right. You got to be dead. You
[1:23:54] got to be dead to those things where the
[1:23:56] desire is gone. Oh, God can't do that.
[1:23:59] Oh, yes, sir, he can. Yes, he can. Yes,
[1:24:01] sir, he can. Hallelujah. I've seen it
[1:24:04] happen. I've experienced it. Glory to
[1:24:05] God. Amen. Because if that desire is in
[1:24:08] you, that means you're still alive.
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:12] I'm so glad.
[1:24:16] Now, brother Rab says, "In perfect
[1:24:18] strength and perfect
[1:24:19] weakness, it'll never be until every
[1:24:22] person that professes to be a Christian
[1:24:25] will forget their own ability and yield
[1:24:28] himself to God." You know what it is to
[1:24:30] yield to someone? You know what that
[1:24:32] means? To let them have control.
[1:24:36] Yeah. That what it means. Let them have
[1:24:38] control. Don't struggle. Don't fight it.
[1:24:42] Let them have control.
[1:24:44] Right?
[1:24:46] See, then God can achieve his purpose by
[1:24:50] sending not a revival, but brother, what
[1:24:52] we need to do first is send a killing.
[1:24:56] That's right. So we can revive. We have
[1:24:58] to die. You have to die before you can
[1:25:01] be born again. He needs a killing. This
[1:25:05] tabernacle needs a killing and me with
[1:25:08] it. Here's the prophet of God. This is
[1:25:10] in 1961. He says, "I need a killing,
[1:25:12] too." If we want a revival, brother, you
[1:25:16] know, we are living, do we all know
[1:25:17] we're living in the time of the bride's
[1:25:19] revival? Amen. Where this is not a
[1:25:21] denominational revival of every 3 years
[1:25:23] and it dies down, but we're living in an
[1:25:25] era of continuous revival. Where there's
[1:25:28] an awakening of a people. Yes.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah. So, but Brother Bram says,
[1:25:32] you've got to keep the spirit of revival
[1:25:34] around you. You can't just get all cold
[1:25:36] and starchy and well now this is how it
[1:25:38] is and this is how we do church and you
[1:25:41] know forget the yeah I know there's
[1:25:44] church order but don't get all set in
[1:25:46] our ways. We don't want to be set in our
[1:25:48] ways. We should be Lord I want more of
[1:25:51] you and more of you means less of me.
[1:25:54] So he says the tabernacle needs a
[1:25:57] killing in me with it. And I'm putting
[1:25:58] myself here.
[1:25:59] Absolutely. All of us. We need a killing
[1:26:02] so that we can be revived in a new life,
[1:26:04] a new hope, a new hope, a new
[1:26:06] experience. First, we need a day of
[1:26:09] mourning. We need a place of yielding to
[1:26:11] the spirit. And instead of so much
[1:26:14] depending upon schooling and upon our
[1:26:16] programs and on our campaigns and all
[1:26:19] that we have, we rely upon cooperation
[1:26:22] with so many different ministers to
[1:26:24] cooperate. We are we allow so many if we
[1:26:27] can't get so many then we won't we won't
[1:26:29] go to the cities without that. And then
[1:26:31] when we do that, we are making it into a
[1:26:34] great big machine that's got a carbon
[1:26:36] knock in it. See, we've got to get away
[1:26:38] from that from human ability. And we've
[1:26:40] got to get to a place where we can
[1:26:42] surrender our souls and lives even to
[1:26:44] the housewife to the farmer to the
[1:26:46] mechanic or whatever you are we are.
[1:26:48] We've got to re surrender completely to
[1:26:51] God and know that we are nothing. Then
[1:26:53] let God start from there. Then he starts
[1:26:56] moving working and that includes all of
[1:26:59] us, everyone. The thing we've got to do.
[1:27:02] Amen. is that history proves it. History
[1:27:05] proves it that God always chose the
[1:27:07] nobodies to become his somebody's. God
[1:27:11] takes the person that's nothing.
[1:27:15] Amen. There's got to be a killing
[1:27:18] and may it start with me. Amen. And me.
[1:27:21] Amen. This is not a pitchfork sermon.
[1:27:24] No. Give it to someone else. I hope they
[1:27:26] get this. I hope they receive this. I
[1:27:27] hope they No. This is not a pitchfork
[1:27:29] sermon. It should be, "Lord, here's my
[1:27:30] plate. Yes. Fill up my cup. It's this
[1:27:33] big. Fill it up, Lord. Hallelujah. May
[1:27:36] there be a killing. Start with me. Amen.
[1:27:38] Because remember Samson, they didn't
[1:27:40] see. Those Philistines didn't see. We go
[1:27:43] back to that scene. They were all having
[1:27:45] fun. They made Mary, they were making
[1:27:47] fun of him. They didn't see the see the
[1:27:50] tears begin to run down his face out of
[1:27:52] those socket those eyeless sockets. And
[1:27:55] he begin to cry, "Once more, Lord. once
[1:27:58] more that I can die with my enemy.
[1:28:02] Hallelujah. And he be to cry out once
[1:28:04] more, avenge my blindness. Sin is
[1:28:07] blinding. Avenge my
[1:28:10] blindness. And brother Brandon says upon
[1:28:12] these denominations, give me strength,
[1:28:14] oh Lord, to shake this denominational
[1:28:16] world. Hallelujah. And he began to pray
[1:28:19] once more, may I die with this enemy.
[1:28:22] When he died, that cycle of war that he
[1:28:25] was in ended. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[1:28:27] didn't have to fight the Philistines
[1:28:29] again. There wasn't a con, you know, a
[1:28:31] battle between them and him anymore.
[1:28:33] When he died, that died. Amen.
[1:28:35] Hallelujah. And so when he died, he got
[1:28:38] the victory. Amen. And it's the same
[1:28:41] thing with us. We can't just sit back.
[1:28:44] You know, if God says we can be on fire
[1:28:47] for him, I want to be on fire. I do not
[1:28:49] want to be lukewarm. I do not want to be
[1:28:51] indifferent. I do not want to become
[1:28:53] cold, starch, and indifferent. Amen.
[1:28:55] Because you say, "Well, that'll never
[1:28:57] happen to me." Don't even sit back on
[1:28:59] your laurels and what you used to do in
[1:29:01] yesterday year. What about today? What
[1:29:04] about today? Amen. You say, "Well, I've
[1:29:07] never experienced things like that."
[1:29:08] People are afraid to just actually let
[1:29:10] God have control. That's right. Do you
[1:29:11] know that people are actually afraid to
[1:29:14] actually let God have his way? You know,
[1:29:17] sometimes I'm standing here and my
[1:29:19] mind's here and whatever's coming out of
[1:29:20] here is not what I'm thinking. Amen.
[1:29:22] Hallelujah. That's called letting him
[1:29:24] have his way. Amen. And I'm not saying
[1:29:27] that, oh, look at me. No, we can do that
[1:29:29] with if you're singing, if you're
[1:29:31] praying, if you're playing, if you're in
[1:29:34] the back, if you're at the in the Sunday
[1:29:36] school teaching, if you're at home, if
[1:29:38] you're at work, wherever you may be, God
[1:29:41] can just take a vessel. Amen. And use it
[1:29:43] for his glory. Hallelujah. And that's
[1:29:45] how it should be. You say, "Well, I
[1:29:47] don't know what'll happen." Let him have
[1:29:48] his way. You know, all the modern music,
[1:29:51] you know, there's a l there's a radio on
[1:29:52] the lab. It's all about give you my
[1:29:54] heart. I lost my mind and I lost myself
[1:29:58] and you know, take come and take
[1:30:00] control. And what is that? The devil's
[1:30:02] saying give me you. Give me your soul. I
[1:30:06] will take you. That's what it's saying.
[1:30:07] It's calling people to do it. It's not
[1:30:10] just entertainment. It's a religion.
[1:30:12] They're having church on the radio. Come
[1:30:14] and take control. I'll lose my mind. I
[1:30:17] lost myself. or what do you know? That's
[1:30:20] what they sing about virtually all of
[1:30:22] it. And they sing to some great spirit
[1:30:25] in the sky. I don't want to sing to the
[1:30:27] prince of the power of the air. I don't
[1:30:29] want to sing to some darkness. Amen. God
[1:30:31] didn't make us to serve the devil. Think
[1:30:34] about it. You know, this is the whole
[1:30:35] world's engineered this way. Give give
[1:30:38] your heart to me. You know, that's what
[1:30:40] they sing about. Well, why are they
[1:30:41] singing that? Because if people open
[1:30:43] themselves up Yeah. the spirit that's
[1:30:45] traveling on that music comes into them.
[1:30:48] Yeah. And it begins to manifest what
[1:30:50] they're singing. So the inspiration that
[1:30:52] anoints the musician to begin with
[1:30:55] manifests in the people. Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] It's exactly what happens. And so now if
[1:31:00] that's on the darkness side and it's
[1:31:02] such a greater ramp up of those things,
[1:31:04] how much more it should be on God's
[1:31:06] side. Amen. Amen. Oh, that's crazy to be
[1:31:09] go lose control of body and soul.
[1:31:11] There's a used to be a song like that. I
[1:31:14] say it should be that way on God's side.
[1:31:16] lose control of body and soul.
[1:31:18] Hallelujah. Let him have his way. Don't
[1:31:21] be afraid. Amen. Just let go. Let go and
[1:31:25] let God. Amen. Just die upon the altar.
[1:31:29] Amen. Pride is forget the pride. Forget
[1:31:32] what people will think of you. What will
[1:31:34] heaven think of you? Amen. Who are you
[1:31:36] trying to please? This is not like
[1:31:39] Britain's Got Talent or whatever. They
[1:31:41] hold, you know, they have a judging
[1:31:43] panel and I'll give you a nine or a 10
[1:31:45] or whatever. they say or you're rubbish.
[1:31:47] You know, who cares what man says? We
[1:31:50] walk before who's our God? Who's our
[1:31:53] God? Is it your family or your next door
[1:31:55] neighbor or your work colleague or you
[1:31:57] know, do you walk before them? Are they
[1:32:00] going to save you? No, they won't save
[1:32:02] you. Well, you say that sounds
[1:32:03] ridiculous. But sometimes we how we
[1:32:06] conduct ourselves in front of other
[1:32:07] people is because we're intimidated by
[1:32:10] what they will think. Who can and we
[1:32:12] want to please them to fit in. I don't
[1:32:14] want to fit in here. I want to fit in
[1:32:16] heaven. How about you? Oh, but pride
[1:32:19] keeps us from from actually, you know,
[1:32:22] I'm I'm so convicted. Brother Bram said
[1:32:25] in one of the family alter books, he
[1:32:26] says, you know, we're afraid to testify
[1:32:28] on the job. He says it's pride. Amen. I
[1:32:32] thought, my God, help me. That's true.
[1:32:34] He says it's pride. That's pride stops
[1:32:37] us from doing things cuz we're worried
[1:32:39] about what they'll think of us and if
[1:32:40] they say negative things. Yeah. I
[1:32:42] remember when I first met the Lord, I
[1:32:44] didn't care. I just told people
[1:32:48] they didn't. And there was not a great
[1:32:49] big glory revival at the university. I
[1:32:51] prayed there would be. You know, I
[1:32:53] thought everyone everyone will know him
[1:32:55] cuz he's alive. I trust you've had that
[1:32:57] experience. Think how could people not
[1:32:59] doubt? He's lifted himself out of
[1:33:01] history. The things he promises in here,
[1:33:03] he does. Hallelujah. Not just on tape 50
[1:33:06] years ago, but today. Hallelujah. You
[1:33:09] know, the same God that spoke through
[1:33:10] the messenger is present. You think, "My
[1:33:12] goodness, how could people not receive
[1:33:14] this and rejoice?" And you come and talk
[1:33:16] to them even about things like water.
[1:33:17] These are Christian people. Talk about
[1:33:19] water baptism. Oh, why? It's crazy. You
[1:33:22] don't have to get baptized and in the
[1:33:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. No, you
[1:33:26] know, simple things. Brother says, "You
[1:33:29] don't even need a revelation on baptism.
[1:33:30] It's there in the word. You read through
[1:33:32] all the scripture on baptism. The
[1:33:34] conclusion is Lord Jesus Christ. What is
[1:33:36] the name of the father, son, holy ghost?
[1:33:38] Is father a name? No. Son? No. Holy
[1:33:41] ghost? No. That's not a name. It's what
[1:33:43] it is. What's the one name? Lord Jesus
[1:33:45] Christ. But would people rejoice in
[1:33:47] that? And no. I thought, man, essencier
[1:33:50] people surely maybe the delivery, you
[1:33:53] know, maybe the salesman needed some
[1:33:54] training. I probably, but you know, man,
[1:33:59] but then you come down along the way and
[1:34:01] if you're uh if you're not careful, you
[1:34:03] think, well, I'm going to be careful
[1:34:04] what I say now. Yeah, that's right.
[1:34:07] Don't be, you know, there's wisdom.
[1:34:09] Sure, there's wisdom. But if they reject
[1:34:12] it, they reject it. If they accept it,
[1:34:14] glory. If they if they don't, well,
[1:34:16] well, hey, it's up to them. You got to
[1:34:19] deliver it in the right way, of course,
[1:34:21] with wisdom.
[1:34:22] But he said, you know, he said it's
[1:34:25] pride. I thought, Lord, I don't want to
[1:34:27] be proud. Because God resists the proud.
[1:34:31] God is not a respective person. You say,
[1:34:32] well, I'm the bride of Christ. Ah, he's
[1:34:34] not a respector of person. He'll
[1:34:36] actually deal with you more harshly than
[1:34:38] someone in the world who has the same
[1:34:39] amount of pride.
[1:34:42] Hallelujah.
[1:34:45] So he begins to cry out.
[1:34:49] He says, "Oh God, if the body of Christ
[1:34:51] would stand as
[1:34:53] one." Now remember, you say, "Well, I
[1:34:56] believe the message." You're not immune
[1:34:58] from these things. You got to stay dead.
[1:35:00] The Apostle Paul stayed dead. When he
[1:35:03] says, "I die daily," he did. Yes. Amen.
[1:35:06] He He overcame everything because it
[1:35:08] wasn't him living anymore. When he says
[1:35:10] it's no longer I that liveth, but Christ
[1:35:12] that liveth in me, it wasn't just I'll
[1:35:14] think of some nice word, you know, that
[1:35:16] they can they can post on Facebook or
[1:35:18] Instagram 2,000 years later in a
[1:35:20] positive scripture, he was saying
[1:35:22] something that's it was a reality to
[1:35:23] him. I'm not alive anymore, that old
[1:35:26] man. Amen. And I was on the road to
[1:35:28] Damascus one day and the old guy didn't
[1:35:30] get all the way to Damascus. He met a he
[1:35:32] met a supernatural being that I found
[1:35:35] was the God of of the Old Testament. His
[1:35:37] name is now Jesus. Amen. And I'm no
[1:35:39] longer alive anymore. Hallelujah. He had
[1:35:42] a killing. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:35:45] he turned the world upside down. Amen.
[1:35:48] You say, "Well, I may You say, but I'm
[1:35:51] not a messenger to the age, but you're
[1:35:53] still the bride of Christ." Amen. Your
[1:35:55] favorite preacher will probably never go
[1:35:56] to your job site. Amen. Your favorite,
[1:35:59] you know, musicians or whatever, they'll
[1:36:01] probably never go where you live or your
[1:36:03] school or, you know, Brother Brandon
[1:36:05] will never walk into your school and
[1:36:08] talk to your friends or to your, you
[1:36:10] know, I mean, physically, you say,
[1:36:12] "Well, he's going to resurrect with the
[1:36:13] rest of them." Yeah, but when he does,
[1:36:14] mercyy's done. So that So even if he
[1:36:17] didn't talk to them, well, mercy is done
[1:36:18] anyway. I mean, now when mercy is still
[1:36:20] on, you following me? God needs to use
[1:36:22] you. That's right. Yeah. Amen. your
[1:36:24] favorite preacher from the other side of
[1:36:26] the world. He's not going to come and
[1:36:27] walk in your job site and do all the
[1:36:28] witnessing for you. Amen. Amen. It is
[1:36:31] you. And it and we when it's us
[1:36:34] overcoming, it's not, you know. Yes.
[1:36:37] Amen. The worship your favorite
[1:36:40] preacher, you know, we don't just
[1:36:42] overcome when your favorite preacher
[1:36:43] screaming in your ears through some
[1:36:44] earbuds or your or you're listening to
[1:36:47] your favorite worship music. That's not
[1:36:48] when we're overcoming being victorious.
[1:36:51] It's all the time. It should be all the
[1:36:53] time. When everything is when there's
[1:36:55] not even a Bible close to you, not even
[1:36:57] a message book close to you, not even
[1:36:59] YouTube or whatever you stream from
[1:37:01] close to you, you should be overcoming.
[1:37:04] Amen. Amen. Hey, if the apostles did it
[1:37:06] without the internet, we can do it with
[1:37:10] Amen. They didn't need Wi-Fi.
[1:37:13] I'm sorry I can't preach to you today.
[1:37:15] Here comes the Apostle Paul. Do you have
[1:37:17] Wi-Fi in this building? Huh? I can't.
[1:37:19] I've got to go. Oh, the Lord's called me
[1:37:20] somewhere else. It wasn't that way.
[1:37:23] They're sitting there in the, you know,
[1:37:25] Paul and Silas, there, you know, they're
[1:37:27] there. Remember, they were dead. They
[1:37:28] weren't bothered. They were in prison.
[1:37:30] They were dead. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] And they and they were sitting there.
[1:37:34] They just been beaten. They th in
[1:37:35] prison. They didn't say, "Hey, hey,
[1:37:37] Paul, did you keep your cell phone on
[1:37:39] you? I'm this may No, I'm saying these
[1:37:43] things because sometimes we depend. I
[1:37:45] need this. If I have this, I'm listening
[1:37:47] to this, then I could be rejoicing. It
[1:37:49] shouldn't be that way only." That's
[1:37:50] right. Sure, you should listen. But when
[1:37:53] when when when when the rubber hits the
[1:37:55] road or whatever, you know, when it all
[1:37:57] comes down, when the chips are down,
[1:37:58] whatever the saying is, what's causing
[1:38:01] you to overcome? Is there a life in
[1:38:03] here? That's right. Is there a life in
[1:38:04] here that brings forth his word? Amen.
[1:38:07] That changes the atmosphere in the
[1:38:08] place, or is it because you're depending
[1:38:11] upon something else? So Paul and Silas,
[1:38:14] they didn't say, "Hey, do you have W? Is
[1:38:15] there Wi-Fi in this, you know, in this
[1:38:17] in this prison? I need to put on my
[1:38:19] favorite worship band so we can sing.
[1:38:20] Then the then God can come and shake the
[1:38:22] place. No, they didn't have anything
[1:38:23] like that. They begin to sing. They
[1:38:26] begin to pray. They were going to give
[1:38:28] glory to God. They were dead.
[1:38:30] Hallelujah. They were free. And God came
[1:38:33] down. Amen. Amen. May not have been I
[1:38:36] don't know how long it took them when
[1:38:37] they sing, but you know, you know when
[1:38:38] you get to sing and you get to think
[1:38:39] about the Lord, time just becomes no
[1:38:42] more. You're not you're not in any
[1:38:44] hurry. You're not too worried. You're
[1:38:46] just having a good time to yourself.
[1:38:48] Hallelujah. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[1:38:50] one of them. And then God came
[1:38:53] down. Amen.
[1:38:55] Now he says,
[1:38:59] so I should read this. He says,
[1:39:01] now we don't need just a little. This is
[1:39:04] what he says in and once more Lord in
[1:39:06] Chicago. We don't need just a little.
[1:39:08] Lord, forgive me and Jim and Joe and all
[1:39:10] of us. Amen. We need a sincere cleaning
[1:39:13] up from the pull pit to the janitor.
[1:39:15] Yes. They never noticed the tears
[1:39:17] running down from them sockets where he
[1:39:19] once had eyes. They never noticed the
[1:39:21] moving of his lips. Speak of Samson. His
[1:39:23] eyes brimmy tears streaming down from
[1:39:25] the sockets. He wanted God to make his
[1:39:28] word once more vindicated to prove. As I
[1:39:31] say to this Delila today, or the Samson
[1:39:33] rather, Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:39:35] today and forever. Once more, he thought
[1:39:37] if it would happen, not a new
[1:39:39] denomination, not a new
[1:39:42] sectarian, but a vindicated word from
[1:39:45] you, God. I know you're still God. I'm
[1:39:47] blind. I've got off the track. I'm not
[1:39:50] worthy to live. Let me die with this
[1:39:52] enemy. You raised me up to destroy it.
[1:39:54] Hallelujah. You've been raised up.
[1:39:57] You've been raised up to destroy your
[1:39:59] enemy. You understand? You have been
[1:40:01] made in a certain way that you can
[1:40:03] overcome yourself. Amen. You've been
[1:40:05] made in a certain way that you can die
[1:40:07] on God's altar. You've been made that
[1:40:09] way. Amen. You've been built that way.
[1:40:11] You made that way from the foundation of
[1:40:13] the world. So, you raised up.
[1:40:14] Hallelujah. You're raised up to defeat
[1:40:16] this carnal flesh. Amen. By this, by can
[1:40:19] do all things through Jesus Christ who
[1:40:21] strengthens me. So, that means I have
[1:40:23] been raised up to defeat this guy.
[1:40:27] Amen. Hallelujah. And don't don't build
[1:40:31] a big wall of quotes and scriptures to
[1:40:33] to just validate some kind of
[1:40:37] wishy-washy, you
[1:40:39] know, and you know, compromise kind of
[1:40:42] walk. Oh, it's all grace. I wish I could
[1:40:46] I I might just plaster it up on the wall
[1:40:48] here. The definition of grace,
[1:40:50] especially the divine influence upon the
[1:40:53] heart. That's what grace
[1:40:58] grace is. Amen. Amen. I'm going to I'm
[1:41:01] just going to read it to you. It's a go
[1:41:03] to the New Testament. Just just read it.
[1:41:07] Maybe I'm wasting my time, but anyway,
[1:41:08] we'll see if this works.
[1:41:11] I'm glad we have technology like this.
[1:41:19] Hope you don't mind silence.
[1:41:32] I don't have Wi-Fi.
[1:41:36] I'll try it on here. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:38] But if you
[1:41:41] go, you see
[1:41:43] that grace is not just I can live any
[1:41:46] life I want to. That's not real grace.
[1:41:50] We forget sometimes God says I'll not
[1:41:52] always strive with man.
[1:41:54] He says in the days of
[1:41:55] Noah he said I will not always strive
[1:41:58] with
[1:42:01] man. Grace this is from 2 Timothy
[1:42:03] chapter 1. From the definition it means
[1:42:07] graciousness as in gratifying a manner
[1:42:09] or act abstract or contract literal
[1:42:11] figurative or spiritual especially the
[1:42:14] divine influence upon the heart and its
[1:42:18] reflection in the life. Definition of
[1:42:21] grace. Glory to God. Amen. So has his
[1:42:23] grace. That's why he says grace be unto
[1:42:25] you. Paul's writing grace be unto you.
[1:42:27] Amen. He's saying may may the grace of
[1:42:29] God influence may there be a divine
[1:42:32] influence upon your heart and it may be
[1:42:34] reflected in your life. Hallelujah.
[1:42:36] Hallelujah. So that's why people say,
[1:42:38] "Yeah, but we're under grace." Well,
[1:42:40] what kind of grace you under? I'm under
[1:42:42] the grace of God. Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] Amen. I'm so glad that's the case. I'm
[1:42:47] under the grace of God. I'm not living
[1:42:49] under human grace. You know, God doesn't
[1:42:51] just turn a blind eye. You know, you can
[1:42:54] you can live whatever way you want. As I
[1:42:57] said in the beginning, do you make Jesus
[1:42:59] feel comfortable?
[1:43:01] If you make him feel uncomfortable in
[1:43:02] your life, well, then there's something
[1:43:05] wrong. You're not dead.
[1:43:08] Amen. So, when you get dressed in the
[1:43:10] morning, do what you wear doesn't make
[1:43:11] him feel comfortable. Would he wear that
[1:43:13] same kind of thing?
[1:43:16] Amen.
[1:43:17] Yep. what you listen to. You got to be
[1:43:20] careful the music. Oh dear. Oh, I you
[1:43:23] know this modern stuff. A lot of it as
[1:43:26] you just go through a shredding machine.
[1:43:29] Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:32] What? You know, can you see Jesus
[1:43:34] standing in one of those big places? If
[1:43:36] we had a light system like they doing
[1:43:38] smoke screens and stuff, if I came here
[1:43:40] and saw this, I would never come back.
[1:43:43] I would never come into a place like
[1:43:45] that. I'd say, would God come into a
[1:43:47] place like that? Could you imagine
[1:43:48] Brandom Tabernacle being like that?
[1:43:52] Amen. I'm just just just think about it.
[1:43:54] Jesus would feel uncomfortable in that
[1:43:56] kind of place. You know, you go into a
[1:43:58] place, you feel the well, I haven't done
[1:43:59] it for years, but you know, when you
[1:44:01] used to in the world, you go to concerts
[1:44:03] or you go to the pub or something or,
[1:44:04] you know, and the base of the place, you
[1:44:06] feel it, it it beats your heart for you,
[1:44:10] right? You know, that's in that's in
[1:44:12] churches. Would Jesus feel comfortable
[1:44:14] in there? You know, I
[1:44:16] remember this is when I was at uni and I
[1:44:19] had to get some money out one night. I
[1:44:20] was in the library. Had to get some
[1:44:21] money out because we're going on to
[1:44:22] youth camp. I needed to get the money
[1:44:24] for the fees down in Christ Church and I
[1:44:26] went to So, if you ever been to Canbury
[1:44:29] University, there's the main library and
[1:44:31] then there's an ATM kind of across at
[1:44:33] the registry building. I was going to go
[1:44:34] to that ATM, but it was down. The next
[1:44:37] ATM I knew of was round by uh the
[1:44:39] students association building where the
[1:44:42] pub was, which I virtually lived at more
[1:44:44] than anywhere else before I met the
[1:44:46] Lord. There's a big big bunch of tall
[1:44:49] trees around campus and it blocks a lot
[1:44:51] of noise. So I'm walking around where
[1:44:53] you can't hear anything cuz you know cuz
[1:44:55] it's like a Wednesday or Thursday night.
[1:44:56] So the place is full and you can't hear
[1:44:59] any of the noise. But when you walk
[1:45:00] around past one of the buildings, past
[1:45:01] these trees, then you hear just the
[1:45:03] noise of the place. And then something
[1:45:05] said in and so the ATM I would have used
[1:45:08] is right by the front door of that
[1:45:09] place. That's where I was going to go.
[1:45:11] Okay. So as soon as I heard the noise of
[1:45:14] the place, something in me said, I do
[1:45:16] not want to go there. Yeah. It wasn't
[1:45:19] you don't want to go there. I was free.
[1:45:21] I was just going to walk there. I have
[1:45:23] no there there's nothing in me that
[1:45:24] pulls towards that stuff anymore. But
[1:45:26] the Lord said to me, I do not want to go
[1:45:29] there. He didn't say you don't want to
[1:45:31] go there. I don't want to go. Yeah.
[1:45:33] Like, Lord, okay, we're not going. I'll
[1:45:36] get the money another time somewhere
[1:45:38] else. Amen.
[1:45:40] Remember, we Jesus when he came to be
[1:45:45] baptized, what did John say? Behold the
[1:45:47] lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:45:48] the world.
[1:45:50] And then the spirit of God descended
[1:45:52] upon him like a dove. You ever listen to
[1:45:54] the sermon of the church in its
[1:45:55] condition with the lamb and the dove?
[1:45:58] You have you listened to those recently?
[1:46:01] Amen. And he says, brother Bram says
[1:46:03] that those two animals have the same
[1:46:04] kind of nature. And if Jesus was a wolf,
[1:46:08] a dove will never come land upon a wolf.
[1:46:11] And he says, the problem with us is we
[1:46:13] have we're born with a wolf nature. And
[1:46:15] that wolf nature, if we if we allow it,
[1:46:18] can come back alive. And then so the
[1:46:21] spirit of God will now take its flight.
[1:46:24] Amen. He says in Ephesians 4:30, "Grieve
[1:46:27] ye not the Holy Spirit whereby you're
[1:46:29] sealed into the day of your redemption."
[1:46:30] Amen. Who knows that scripture? So, so
[1:46:33] if Paul's instructing the Ephesians, do
[1:46:35] not grieve him, that means you can.
[1:46:38] Amen. That's right. Well, then how do
[1:46:40] you h Well, how can you grieve him? The
[1:46:42] old man that was crucified comes back
[1:46:44] alive again.
[1:46:46] Amen. And then so it's not a lamb nature
[1:46:48] anymore. Well, you're back in the house.
[1:46:51] He takes his flight.
[1:46:53] Amen.
[1:46:55] You got to be we got to be you say but
[1:46:57] he's the almighty all powerful God but
[1:46:59] he shows himself in that way.
[1:47:02] Amen. So we really you got to
[1:47:05] be you got to look you can't just blast
[1:47:09] in anywhere do whatever you want. You
[1:47:11] got to be sensitive to him. Lord is this
[1:47:14] pleasing to you? You know it's a rel you
[1:47:17] know it's a relationship e it's not
[1:47:19] rules and regulations. It should be Lord
[1:47:21] is this pleasing to you?
[1:47:23] Because we can't we can't actually say
[1:47:25] no. Hey Jesus, I'm sick of this. I want
[1:47:27] to do this. Oh, sure. Sure, dear. Okay,
[1:47:29] we'll go. It doesn't work that way. He
[1:47:32] just takes his flight. He waits for you.
[1:47:35] And then finally, you come to that place
[1:47:37] where it's like, what is wrong with me
[1:47:40] and you realize, oh, I'm alive. You have
[1:47:44] to die.
[1:47:45] Amen. I'm not saying it's a joke. You
[1:47:47] literally have to die. You cannot
[1:47:49] resurrect yourself. Amen. Amen. that
[1:47:51] because it's always the battle. You got
[1:47:53] to die daily. Reckon yourself dead. If
[1:47:55] we have the mind of Christ, we do not
[1:47:57] have the mind we once had. Amen. So our
[1:48:00] thinking and everything, you know, our
[1:48:01] thinking and what our affections and
[1:48:04] everything cannot be what they once
[1:48:06] were. Yes. That's right. Amen. Because
[1:48:08] of because if they still are that way,
[1:48:10] then something is wrong. Right.
[1:48:14] What has to happen? You got to die.
[1:48:16] Yeah,
[1:48:17] Samson.
[1:48:19] You say, "Well, I'll never end up like
[1:48:21] Samson did." I say you will if you are
[1:48:25] not totally dead. Yes. Amen. We battle
[1:48:29] and we battle. And
[1:48:32] sometimes there's two things. Sometimes
[1:48:35] you just got to bypass the enemy and
[1:48:36] leave him alone and walk on and reckon
[1:48:39] that you are dead and he is defeated.
[1:48:42] Right? Because I was very conscious of
[1:48:44] this sermon because you think, well,
[1:48:45] what if you get it in the people's minds
[1:48:47] that they just in this constant cycle?
[1:48:48] Am I dead enough? Am I dead enough? Am I
[1:48:49] dead enough? Am I dead enough? I got to
[1:48:51] die, die, die, die. And there and they
[1:48:53] already are dead. If you're dead, reckon
[1:48:56] yourself dead and walk on.
[1:48:59] Right. Yeah. But if you're not dead,
[1:49:01] then you need to die.
[1:49:03] It's very simple. Amen.
[1:49:07] He says, "Now, let me die with this
[1:49:10] enemy. You raised me up to destroy it,
[1:49:12] but I failed you, Lord. But there's a
[1:49:15] possibility you'd hear me once more,
[1:49:17] Lord. Once more. In dead earnestly
[1:49:19] prayed, he knowed what was coming. He
[1:49:22] knew he was going to die. Lord, just let
[1:49:25] this once more. Once more, let me see
[1:49:28] Jesus Christ as he was yesterday. When
[1:49:30] he prayed that prayer, tears roll, tears
[1:49:32] rolling down his cheeks, pardon me, with
[1:49:34] deep sincerity of confession. That's
[1:49:36] what the church needs. Confess you're
[1:49:38] wrong. Don't care what Dr. Jones says or
[1:49:41] what anybody else says. If you're out of
[1:49:43] the word of God, confess it that you're
[1:49:45] wrong. It's a way where you got to
[1:49:47] start. Cry out once more, Lord. Once
[1:49:49] more. Once more, Lord. Once more. Avenge
[1:49:52] my blindness upon these denominations.
[1:49:54] Give me strength, Lord, to shake this
[1:49:56] denominational world with your
[1:49:57] vindication. Give me strength, Lord,
[1:50:00] once more. Prove it. He knew what was
[1:50:02] going to happen if his prayer was
[1:50:03] answered. He knew dead earnest crying
[1:50:05] once more, Lord. And while he was
[1:50:07] praying and making his honest
[1:50:08] confession, every fiber in his body
[1:50:10] begin to vibrate. Oh God, if the body of
[1:50:13] Christ would stand as one and every
[1:50:15] fiber and every member begin to vibrate
[1:50:17] with the literal baptism of the Holy
[1:50:19] Ghost again. I like those words. Literal
[1:50:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost again, not
[1:50:24] with new members and shaking hands in
[1:50:26] some creed. As the strength begin to
[1:50:28] move into those big muscles, every fiber
[1:50:31] begin to twist. He begin to feel himself
[1:50:33] again as he twisted out. And when he
[1:50:35] did, the big wall fell. All we need to
[1:50:38] do today is to see these denominational
[1:50:41] walls fall is get deeply sincere before
[1:50:44] God to heal these blinded eyes that's
[1:50:47] been blinded from the word of God. You
[1:50:51] know, denominational things affect us.
[1:50:54] Amen. You know, we've all been affected
[1:50:56] in some measure by denominational
[1:50:59] teaching. We all have. And it can be
[1:51:04] it can be straight into message realms.
[1:51:07] A denominational spirit can try and come
[1:51:09] into message realms. Or you can just
[1:51:11] come out straight out of a
[1:51:12] denominational church. You know that's
[1:51:14] true. So he's saying once more push
[1:51:17] these things down.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:22] Now, that was Samson's greatest victory
[1:51:25] he ever had because he was willing to
[1:51:28] confess over every enemy first that he
[1:51:31] was brought up to destroy. He says, "Oh,
[1:51:33] Pentecost, stand at your post this
[1:51:36] afternoon. Your post of duty of God's
[1:51:38] word, repent and cry out loud once, Lord
[1:51:41] God, once more. Let me tell you
[1:51:43] something. You'd better destroy your
[1:51:46] enemy before your enemy destroys you."
[1:51:50] Amen. Well, you say, "How can myself
[1:51:53] destroy myself?" Well, very easy. You
[1:51:55] just sit back. I'm just going to
[1:51:57] continue wandering along. I don't die. I
[1:52:01] don't fully give myself to him because
[1:52:04] you'll be stuck
[1:52:06] here. This is I know we're not all
[1:52:08] shouting rejoicing, glory. We're happy.
[1:52:11] But we're called to take a rapture.
[1:52:13] Amen. Amen. But we're not just going to
[1:52:16] get on on easy street. Right. Right.
[1:52:20] We're not. Or you say, "Well, now you're
[1:52:22] bringing your own ability into it."
[1:52:23] Well, if my ability is yielding myself
[1:52:26] and being dead and crying out for more
[1:52:28] of God, then I want to use that ability.
[1:52:31] Amen. If I have a if if I have a sincere
[1:52:33] desire, Lord, live in me. Yes. Amen.
[1:52:36] I've come to take over. The Lord says,
[1:52:39] "Well, Lord, take over." Amen. Every
[1:52:42] fiber, everything that I am. Amen. Leave
[1:52:44] not one stone unturned in my life. Amen.
[1:52:47] If that is the case, I say, "Lord, do
[1:52:49] it." Amen. Amen. Renovate me. Change my
[1:52:53] life. I want to walk like the apostles
[1:52:56] walked and even greater because I'm
[1:52:58] going to be alive and remain. I want to
[1:53:00] live out that scripture. Amen. God takes
[1:53:02] you. God takes if you if that is your
[1:53:04] will. Then that's not a bad thing, is
[1:53:07] it? You following me?
[1:53:10] So you'd better destroy your enemy
[1:53:12] before he destroys you. You say, "Well,
[1:53:14] this thing has been waring against me
[1:53:16] for decades." You die, it'll be dead.
[1:53:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Stop trying to say,
[1:53:20] "The Lord rebuke thee. I curse you, foul
[1:53:22] devil, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:23] You're, you know, get out of here and
[1:53:26] all these things." Just die. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:28] You just need to die. Amen. He that is
[1:53:30] dead is freed from sin. Amen.
[1:53:35] Leave it. Leave it quickly. Return back
[1:53:37] to the word of the Lord. Away from this
[1:53:39] Hollywood showmanship. Turn your whole
[1:53:41] heart back to the word of God. Turn back
[1:53:43] to the power of God. He says, "You women
[1:53:45] dress like women, you men act like men,
[1:53:47] like sons and daughters of God. Turn
[1:53:49] from this Jezebel system that's choking
[1:53:51] you and blinding you. God, help us to
[1:53:54] have a true repentance. Not
[1:53:55] half-heartedly. You can't do it." Now, I
[1:53:58] think today at this very moment when my
[1:54:00] time is up, we should stand to our feet
[1:54:02] and cry our hands in the air, Lord, once
[1:54:05] more. Once more, Lord, I once more.
[1:54:07] Let's stand. Everybody that's willing to
[1:54:09] see a revival, that's ready to die to
[1:54:12] this Hollywood showmanship. Everybody
[1:54:14] that's ready to die, to see the power of
[1:54:17] God come to Zion, then with joy and all
[1:54:19] his holy mountains, nothing hurt or
[1:54:22] shall destroy. Let's raise our hands and
[1:54:24] cry once more, Lord, once more. Send the
[1:54:27] Holy Spirit like a rushing mighty wind,
[1:54:29] like you did in the day of Pentecost.
[1:54:31] Amen. Hallelujah. Now, I'll pose a
[1:54:34] question. Are you dead? I finished
[1:54:37] preaching. Are you dead? Have you really
[1:54:41] died? Amen. I mean I mean I'm not asking
[1:54:45] have you come up forward and being
[1:54:46] prayed for. That's not what I'm talking
[1:54:47] about. Have you really died?
[1:54:50] Have you died with your
[1:54:52] enemy? If you're not, you're not free.
[1:54:56] Oh, but Jesus makes me free. But you
[1:54:58] have to die.
[1:55:00] Amen. We can't. This time has run out.
[1:55:03] We've come to the end of all things.
[1:55:05] Right. And that's not the boy who cried
[1:55:07] wolf. Amen. It's reality. We're at the
[1:55:09] end of the end. Yeah. I was listening. I
[1:55:11] can't remember what message it was, but
[1:55:13] brother, he always says it's later than
[1:55:15] you think. Amen. It's right at the
[1:55:17] doors. And that was 50 odd years ago. He
[1:55:20] says it's later than you think. The
[1:55:22] world's not just going to continue on.
[1:55:24] Lord have mercy. We're not going to Some
[1:55:26] of us won't grow old.
[1:55:29] Some of us won't. Yeah. I'm not
[1:55:31] expecting to end up into in a retirement
[1:55:33] village.
[1:55:36] Time has come to an end. Amen. Prophecy,
[1:55:39] the wheels of prophecy are grinding on.
[1:55:42] Hallelujah. So if that is the case, what
[1:55:45] are we doing? Amen. Are we dead? God
[1:55:49] will take dead people to heaven who are
[1:55:51] dead to themselves and their own
[1:55:53] ability. You say, "I don't know how to
[1:55:55] die." Say, "Lord, take my what I want."
[1:55:58] Amen. Take that and take it away from
[1:56:01] me. Oh, Jesus. Yes. take what I
[1:56:03] selfishly want in my own self and just
[1:56:06] take it from me. Kill it out of me, God.
[1:56:10] Amen. Thy will be done on earth as is in
[1:56:13] heaven. Amen. Hallelujah. That's how it
[1:56:16] should
[1:56:18] be. I hardly know what to do. Let's
[1:56:20] stand to our feet. Let's sincerely pray.
[1:56:23] We don't need music just now, but when
[1:56:25] you feel to come musicians, that's fine.
[1:56:27] Let's all bow our heads and let's all
[1:56:30] pray together. You need to talk. Samson
[1:56:33] prayed himself. He didn't wait for
[1:56:35] someone else to pray for him. Once more,
[1:56:37] Lord. Once more. Oh God, we pray. Lord,
[1:56:41] gracious heavenly father. Lord, we come
[1:56:44] to you with great sincerity in this day.
[1:56:47] Lord, forgive me if I'm Lord, if the
[1:56:49] people would think that we're just
[1:56:50] trying to Lord, just put something heavy
[1:56:52] on them to break them up in some way.
[1:56:55] But Lord, I pray once more, Lord Jesus,
[1:56:58] that we would be dead upon your altar.
[1:57:00] Lord God, that we wouldn't wrigle off it
[1:57:02] in any way, Father, but our whole self,
[1:57:05] all of our being, Lord. Everything we do
[1:57:07] and we think and all of our heart, Lord,
[1:57:10] every part of us would be upon your
[1:57:12] altar, Lord. Father, we'd feel the
[1:57:14] firefall. Oh, God. You consume our
[1:57:16] offering. Lord Jesus, once more, oh God.
[1:57:20] Father, once more, Lord. We want to die
[1:57:22] with our enemy. We know it'll cost us
[1:57:24] greatly, but Lord, we're so glad we can
[1:57:26] die, Lord. We're sick of this, Lord.
[1:57:29] going around the mountain wrestling
[1:57:31] against things, oh God, Father, from our
[1:57:34] wrestling with our past and complexes
[1:57:36] and pains and hurts, oh God, that we
[1:57:38] want to be free from sin, Lord. Help us
[1:57:40] all to die once more, oh God, once more.
[1:57:44] Lord, may we be dead earnest, I pray,
[1:57:47] Father, may you fall among us this
[1:57:48] morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, may we just,
[1:57:51] Father, forget about ourselves. Lord, we
[1:57:54] are not our own. We're bought with a
[1:57:55] price. Oh God, may you just have your
[1:57:58] way once more, Lord. Once more. Oh God,
[1:58:02] may we push down the enemy's temple.
[1:58:04] Father, may we die with our enemy, oh
[1:58:06] God. Lord Jesus, Father, may you grant
[1:58:08] it for your glory, Lord Jesus. Once
[1:58:11] more, Lord. Lord, I just want to commit
[1:58:14] every soul here into your hands. Father,
[1:58:17] you see the hearts. You see the ones who
[1:58:19] are wrestling. Lord, Lord, may they just
[1:58:21] give up and give it to you. May Lord
[1:58:24] God, Father, may it not be, Lord, just a
[1:58:27] wounding, but may it be a killing, Lord.
[1:58:30] We want to see a revival, Lord. A
[1:58:32] greater revival among us, Lord. We don't
[1:58:35] just want to get comfortable, Father, in
[1:58:37] what we have, but Lord, we want an
[1:58:38] awakening, Lord, the bride's revival,
[1:58:41] Lord. We see it happening around the
[1:58:43] world, but Lord, we don't want to be
[1:58:44] left behind in any way. Lord, we don't
[1:58:46] want to live below our privileges, oh
[1:58:48] God. Father, we want to walk with you as
[1:58:51] you want us to walk. Lord, we want to
[1:58:53] lay aside every weight and sin. Forgive
[1:58:55] us of our indifference. Lord, forgive us
[1:58:57] of our laziness. Lord, forgive us of our
[1:58:59] sins, our iniquities, our trespasses.
[1:59:01] Lord, cleanse us of every secret fault,
[1:59:04] oh God. Father, may you grant it for
[1:59:06] your glory. Lord, fill our way every day

[2:09:03] standard. And I believe you've spoken a
[2:09:05] standard to us, Father. Let let Lord
[2:09:07] raise that standard from within us,
[2:09:09] Lord. For we desire, Lord, to be holy.

[2:09:19] it, Father. We pray. We sing our prayer

[2:10:52] come and dispel, Lord, as your light
[2:10:54] shines in our lives, Father. I pray,
[2:10:56] Lord, and ask, Lord, that you would just
[2:10:58] be merciful to us, Lord. And that these
[2:11:00] thoughts and these words that you would
[2:11:01] just send your Holy Spirit, Lord, and
[2:11:04] that Lord, you would mortify the deeds
[2:11:05] of this flesh, Father. Oh, Father,
[2:11:08] through your spirit, Lord, for it's not
[2:11:11] by might nor by power, but by your
[2:11:13] spirit, Father, we ask that your spirit
[2:11:15] would come. And Lord, just continue to
[2:11:18] wash us and cleanse us in the water of
[2:11:20] your word, Father. And just, Father, we
[2:11:23] just offer ourselves to you, a living
[2:11:26] sacrifice. We surrender everything to
[2:11:28] you, Lord. We give our lives to you
[2:11:31] wholeheartedly. Everything that we can
[2:11:33] think of, we surrender, Lord. And
[2:11:36] father, purge us from our secret faults
[2:11:38] and those things that we don't even
[2:11:39] know, Lord. Lord, Father, we depend on
[2:11:42] you, Lord
[2:11:44] Jesus. Lord, show us, Lord. Your way.
[2:11:48] Yes, Lord. Lord, lead us in your paths,

[2:11:56] light, Lord. Make it manifest, Lord
[2:11:58] Jesus. Show us, Lord. We depend on you,
[2:12:02] Father. Thank you, Lord. Bless this
