[34:56] what I mean like it's gonna so let's
[34:57] just let God be the fixer
[34:59] amen but uh Esther chapter nine and
[35:02] we're gonna read from verse 20 down to
[35:04] um verse uh 30. it's gonna read ten
[35:07] verses here so
[35:09] it's easier an Esther 9 and 20 and
[35:11] Mordecai wrote these things and sent
[35:13] letters unto all the Jews that were in
[35:14] all the provinces of King hazardous both
[35:17] nine far to establish this among them
[35:20] that they should keep the 14th day of
[35:22] the month of ADA of the 15th day of the
[35:25] same yearly as the days that wherein the
[35:28] Jews rested from their enemies and and
[35:30] the month which was turned unto them
[35:32] from sorrow to Joy from mourning into a
[35:35] good day that they should make them days
[35:38] of feasting and joy and ascending of
[35:40] portions one to another and gifts to the
[35:42] poor and the Jews undertook to do all
[35:45] um as they had begun and as Mordecai had
[35:48] written unto them because Haman the son
[35:51] of hamadatha the agar guide the enemy of
[35:54] all the Jews had devised against the
[35:56] Jews to destroy them and to cast per
[35:58] that is the lot to consume them and to
[36:00] destroy them but when Esther came before
[36:03] the king he commanded by letters that
[36:05] his Wicked device which he devised
[36:07] against the Jews should return upon his
[36:09] his own head and that he and his son
[36:11] should be hanged on The Gallows
[36:13] wherefore they called These Days Purim
[36:15] after the name of purr therefore for all
[36:18] the words of this letter and of that
[36:20] which they had seen concerning this
[36:22] matter and which had come unto them the
[36:25] Jews ordained and took upon them and
[36:27] upon their seed and upon all such as
[36:29] joined themselves unto them so as it
[36:32] should not fail and they should keep
[36:34] these two days according to their
[36:35] writing and according to their appointed
[36:37] time every year and that these days
[36:40] should be remembered and kept throughout
[36:43] every generation every family every
[36:45] Province every city and that these days
[36:47] of pyrams should not fail from among the
[36:49] Jews nor the memorial of them perish
[36:51] from their sea then Esther the Queen the
[36:53] daughter of Abigail the and Mordecai the
[36:56] Jew wrote with all authority to confirm
[36:59] this second letter of Purim and he sent
[37:01] the letters unto all the Jews to the 120
[37:04] and seven provinces of the kingdom of a
[37:06] hazarus with words of peace and Truth
[37:09] Glory praise God Amen let's just bow
[37:12] heads in the word of prayer this morning

[38:18] hearts unto you in Jesus Christ's name
[38:20] amen amen God bless you friends you may
[38:23] have your seats this morning
[38:25] praise the Lord I want to um I was going
[38:26] to speak on something else but I um went
[38:28] to the supermarket last night and I um
[38:30] it's kind of whole swung around you know
[38:32] seeing that we live in an hour or we
[38:34] live in a day where um you know we
[38:36] celebrated or the world or celebrated
[38:38] Guy Fawkes now Guy Fawkes you know many
[38:41] people just think it's a time to get
[38:42] some uh you know fireworks and fire them
[38:44] off and scare the pets and you know do
[38:46] that kind of thing but the but the but
[38:48] the Guy Fawkes has come from from a
[38:51] celebration of of when um when the uh
[38:54] Catholics tried to blow up the House of
[38:56] Lords there in England this is in 16 uh
[38:59] 05 they tried to do it because at that
[39:01] time King James was on the throne he's a
[39:04] Pros Protestant King and they wanted to
[39:06] blow up the House of Lords and blow up
[39:08] Herman you know reinstall a Catholic uh
[39:11] monarchy there but it was a failed plot
[39:13] it was exposed and the day before
[39:15] because the House of Lords was uh going
[39:18] to convene on the 5th of November and on
[39:20] the 4th of November that night the plot
[39:22] was exposed and Guy Fawkes was one of
[39:24] the conspirators and he was guarding all
[39:26] the gunpowder under the House of Lords
[39:28] and they found the others and and anyway
[39:30] it's a celebration every year of a
[39:32] commemoration of a victory over over a
[39:34] defeated foe now if we look into this uh
[39:38] this this Feast of Purim we know we do
[39:40] not celebrate it as the Jews do because
[39:42] you know we're not Jewish but it is it
[39:45] is a feast or a celebration of when a
[39:47] foiled plot of the enemy Was Defeated
[39:50] now we we should just Rejoice because
[39:53] you know we live in in a feast of
[39:55] Victory today amen where our enemy has
[39:58] been defeated he has been exposed he's
[40:00] been vanquished he's been conquered and
[40:02] you know we can Rejoice because if if
[40:04] God conquered him there then the victory
[40:07] he won there will manifest here right so
[40:10] we can Rejoice that you know you know we
[40:13] can have our Feast of Purim every day
[40:15] praise the Lord because our enemy has
[40:18] been defeated you know uh I believe that
[40:20] the reason that the uh Gunpowder Plot
[40:23] failed is because the King James Bible
[40:25] had to be had to be published it would
[40:27] begin to be um you know uh but yeah
[40:30] before this time it was um you know King
[40:32] James instituted or or said about the
[40:35] having the bible translated and was
[40:37] finally released in 1611 so to me uh you
[40:40] know the reason is because we had to
[40:42] have the word as we do in this day and I
[40:44] believe it's a good enough translation
[40:46] of the Angel of the Lord would would
[40:47] direct brother Branham to it I think
[40:48] it's a good translation don't you amen
[40:51] and it's and it stood the test of time
[40:52] so you know so we see that the Jews they
[40:56] still celebrate the Feast of Purim
[40:57] because it reminds them of the Unseen
[40:59] hand of God turning certain death into
[41:01] Victory and we can do this but in a far
[41:04] greater measure
[41:06] praise the Lord
[41:08] amen we can do this in a far greater
[41:09] measure because this wasn't just a plot
[41:11] to destroy our natural lives but was to
[41:14] destroy us in our entirety where we
[41:16] would be cast out into into Everlasting
[41:18] destruction and be consumed in hell but
[41:20] God rich and mercy intervened amen I
[41:24] want to thank the Lord that before the
[41:25] devil ever devised Us in his in his
[41:28] heart he had already made a way to undo
[41:30] what the devil is doing now if we look
[41:33] at the Feast of pure and what I love
[41:34] about this is is before Haman ever came
[41:37] to his position a queen was already
[41:39] ordained called set in position the
[41:42] crown was already on her head if you
[41:44] read through the Book of Esther Esther
[41:45] came to her position then Haman came to
[41:47] his position and we know the devil is
[41:49] always late he's habitually late he
[41:51] turns up too late amen he's always over
[41:54] budget you know running you know way too
[41:56] late you know his time frames always
[41:57] gone and you know he's always late but
[42:00] God is always on time we may think God's
[42:03] timing is not good timing but God's
[42:05] timings always perfect timing maybe it's
[42:08] a weekend rest assured that God is on
[42:11] time amen so the queen was already in
[42:14] her position now you think about the
[42:15] power that this woman possessed she came
[42:18] out of nowhere it's amazing how we can
[42:20] let our past derail our current walk but
[42:22] Esther would not allow her being herself
[42:25] being an Orford or I mean orphan living
[42:27] in a Strange Land having to actually
[42:28] deny her name to take on a a Persian
[42:32] name she did not let this hold her back
[42:34] for when the time had come for her to
[42:36] take her god-given rights and take her
[42:37] position she stepped forth and it was
[42:40] her she you know no one else could do
[42:42] the job like she could do the job sure
[42:44] Mordecai would say that you know if you
[42:46] do not go Deliverance or rice from
[42:48] another place but perhaps you've come
[42:50] into the kingdom for a Time such as this
[42:52] and it's the same thing with you and I
[42:53] there's a reason you've come into the
[42:55] kingdom this morning there's a reason
[42:56] you've come in this season amen not
[42:58] another season but this season where
[43:00] there's a culmination of the ages is
[43:02] here all things are here right now where
[43:04] the manifestation of the third pull is
[43:06] in full manifestation right now you've
[43:08] come into this Kingdom for a Time such
[43:10] as this amen where the enemy would be
[43:12] thoroughly defeated where his plans and
[43:15] his schemes and his plus to trap the
[43:16] seed of God in this age amen we'll be do
[43:19] we'll be absolutely defeated and we'll
[43:20] March out of here victorious in a
[43:22] Rapture I'm man Hayman schemed a lot no
[43:24] doubt it would be passed down through
[43:26] his family line of the of the wars of
[43:28] the Jews against the amalekites which he
[43:30] came from and King ahag which he came
[43:32] from being killed in if I'm going too
[43:34] fast just just okay just say slow down a
[43:36] bit you know but you know
[43:38] those things were passed down and he
[43:40] thought finally is the opportunity I can
[43:42] right the wrongs of my people so he
[43:45] schemed and you know the devil finally
[43:46] thinks he's got us he thinks he's
[43:48] trapped us here in this world with all
[43:50] the amusements and shiny things of the
[43:52] world and being born in unbelief and you
[43:54] know born born under a curse anyway who
[43:56] think he's got the human race but he
[43:58] doesn't have the human race he does not
[44:00] have Adam's Fallen race because our God
[44:02] step forth from the portals of Glory
[44:04] became one of us they mean to take upon
[44:06] the seed of Adam Amen to take upon human
[44:09] flesh to redeem us back to himself amen
[44:12] but Esther had to stand in her position
[44:14] it was no good her sitting in the palace
[44:16] saying I'm the queen she had to exercise
[44:18] her god-given office remember it wasn't
[44:21] herself that decided I'm going to be
[44:22] Queen no she just found herself in a
[44:25] current of events that that somehow you
[44:28] know the you know the decree she didn't
[44:29] say she didn't get vashti too you know
[44:32] reject the king's orders and be you know
[44:34] exiled whatever she didn't plot that she
[44:36] didn't scheme any of those things but
[44:37] she just found herself caught up in this
[44:40] Vortex of events and then she finds
[44:42] herself being summoned to the palace and
[44:44] she finds herself finding favor with
[44:46] hair guys she finds herself reasoning in
[44:48] a different reasoning than the other
[44:49] woman where she said haggai what should
[44:51] I wear to go before the king you seem to
[44:54] know the king more than I ever could and
[44:55] it's the same thing with us where where
[44:57] we've come into this age and God has
[44:59] sent a haggai in this day the seventh
[45:01] angel messenger who knows the heart of
[45:03] the king and there's something in it
[45:04] says says Lord what should I get dressed
[45:07] in and we approach the word and we don't
[45:09] come to God according to what we want we
[45:11] come to God according to what he wants
[45:13] amen and this is and Aang and we are a
[45:16] woman of Grace right well we do not
[45:18] approach God according to what we think
[45:20] we should do and I think I'll dress this
[45:22] way I don't care what it goes it doesn't
[45:23] matter all those things no we come and
[45:25] say Lord how can I live that's pleasing
[45:28] unto you not that we're trying to earn
[45:30] heaven but because of what he's done for
[45:32] us it's out of appreciation Lord you're
[45:34] so good I was in darkness and you found
[45:36] me I was lost and blind and you opened
[45:39] my eyes and I wasn't looking for you but
[45:41] you were looking for me and you found me
[45:43] and now Lord how can I live in a way
[45:45] that will please you because of what you
[45:47] have done
[45:48] amen so so Esther went and she spoke to
[45:51] haggis because haggar knew the heart of
[45:53] the king and so then he said you know
[45:56] she he said well this is how you should
[45:57] dress this is how you should be baptized
[46:00] there's not three kings there's one king
[46:02] this is how you should dress this is how
[46:04] you should conduct yourself this is how
[46:05] you should treat your brothers and
[46:06] sisters just how you should treat your
[46:08] family this is how you should do these
[46:09] things and you know she just dressed in
[46:11] it
[46:12] Hallelujah and then she goes them before
[46:14] the king
[46:15] and maybe there were a lot of other
[46:17] women who went before her who who who
[46:19] had the had the lineage you had the
[46:21] reputation of being a you know being
[46:23] being of royalty and having a church
[46:25] history which is better and greater
[46:26] whatever more but they didn't know the
[46:28] heart of the king they just knew the
[46:30] heart of their movement
[46:32] amen so she went in before the king and
[46:34] she found favor in his sight
[46:37] Hallelujah and then she finds herself
[46:40] kneeling before him I don't know how the
[46:41] ceremony exactly went but but the Royal
[46:43] Crown was placed upon her head
[46:46] and she found herself being the queen of
[46:48] Persia of the meats and Persians the
[46:50] superpower of the age she was the queen
[46:53] Hallelujah but it wasn't her schemes
[46:55] that got her there it was she was
[46:57] applauding nothing
[46:58] it was God's
[47:00] foreordained grace
[47:03] because he knew
[47:05] she when she got into that position
[47:08] that she was going to be used to defeat
[47:10] the devil's work
[47:12] praise a lot
[47:14] it's the same thing with you and I you
[47:16] know it's amazing how God would allow
[47:19] the fall to happen and he would allow us
[47:21] to actually be born in unbelief and you
[47:23] know and these lips that would speak
[47:25] cursing and blasphemy and mockery this
[47:29] life that that that the devil would
[47:31] actually be allowed to use to to to just
[47:34] be a mockery of you make a fallen people
[47:36] but then God would come and by the
[47:39] bleach of his blood not just wash our
[47:41] sins away but change our nature where it
[47:44] went from unbelief into faith if you're
[47:45] a Believer this morning you've been
[47:47] changed amen you've been God's son of
[47:49] work in your heart Hallelujah and then
[47:51] to the same lips that actually exalted
[47:53] the kingdom of Hell upon the Earth and
[47:56] now the same lips that tear the kingdom
[47:58] have held down holy where God could use
[48:00] your lips and cast out demons and could
[48:02] bring healing and could bring
[48:04] deliverance and could bring comfort and
[48:06] understanding where once maybe God would
[48:09] I mean I mean the devil would would
[48:10] actually anoint you to tear down and to
[48:12] rip apart and to break down God uses
[48:14] those same lips to build up and to edify
[48:17] and bring healing and love to one
[48:19] another amen hallelujah we're anointed
[48:21] to tear the kingdom of Satan down
[48:23] but you see Esther had to step into that
[48:25] position it wasn't enough for it just to
[48:28] be Queen like I've said but she had to
[48:30] use the office that God had placed her
[48:32] in
[48:33] amen you know it's amazing
[48:35] you know I really want this morning to
[48:38] be a accumulation of faith
[48:40] you know brother bam says this this is
[48:42] from thy house I think it's a very
[48:44] striking statement now he says now if
[48:47] you're sick here's healing you just
[48:48] believe it now you can't make yourself
[48:50] believe it's going it's got to be
[48:53] something happen to you just like your
[48:55] conversion has got to happen he says I
[48:57] was telling my wife the other day how
[48:58] much I loved her so I don't guess she
[49:00] wants me to talk about this but I do it
[49:02] in private so I guess I can do it in
[49:03] public right now pardon me I was telling
[49:05] you how much I loved her and how I
[49:08] always loved her since the The First
[49:10] beginning
[49:11] Amy I said I don't it don't make any
[49:13] difference she said oh Bill she said oh
[49:16] talking about how fat she was getting
[49:18] and her hair was turning gray I said
[49:19] honey you could be that way to know here
[49:21] I'd still love you just the same see
[49:23] because it has to be something there
[49:26] that uh that you have you have to meet
[49:29] that you love somebody and unless that
[49:31] person loves that other person this is
[49:33] for you young girls that are not married
[49:34] to your boys when you meet that girl
[49:36] that you love and there's just something
[49:37] you know you love her and that's just
[49:39] all there is to it or you love him and
[49:42] you don't care whether he's handsome
[49:43] whether he's not handsome or whether
[49:44] she's pretty or not pretty it doesn't
[49:46] matter but you love them just the same
[49:48] they better watch kind of hold around
[49:50] close there because we're getting close
[49:51] to home and a marriage based outside of
[49:54] that is sure to fall it'll never be
[49:56] successful they'll never be happy now I
[49:59] said that it's going to get around to
[50:01] one thing I want to say friends a
[50:02] conversion outside of the same thing
[50:04] won't last either it won't when you go
[50:06] to church and you say well I'm going to
[50:07] church I'm going to be baptized if it
[50:09] isn't coming from a heart of love to God
[50:11] Yonder it'll go nowhere all you'll do is
[50:14] just join church and be baptized but
[50:16] when you're converted to Christ I love
[50:18] to Christ then you accumulate a faith in
[50:21] Christ like you would do for your wife
[50:23] or for your husband you accumulate a
[50:25] faith that you walk in that fight I
[50:27] don't see it's just something about you
[50:29] you've got something that anchors you
[50:30] there you see well it's the same way it
[50:33] is about Christ and what Christ says you
[50:35] believe it you just stay right with it
[50:37] that's the way it just raises you right
[50:39] up above it and God brings it to pass
[50:41] and fulfills his promise that thou will
[50:43] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thine
[50:45] in thy house shall be saved so it's an
[50:47] accumulation of facing see a conversion
[50:50] outside of a coming to God with a heart
[50:52] of love and a change of nature it won't
[50:54] last see we don't just want to join
[50:56] church and get baptized and say the same
[50:58] kind of way we're going to see a
[51:00] difference in our lives you know the
[51:01] word should be working mildly in us to
[51:03] changing our Natures changing our hearts
[51:05] and you see but when you come when you
[51:07] converted to Christ you get a love to
[51:09] Christ then you accumulate the faith in
[51:11] Christ you begin to gather faith amen
[51:13] amen and that's why I believe we should
[51:15] do when we should you know you know when
[51:16] we come to church when we read the word
[51:18] when we pray when we hear the message
[51:19] we're actually accumulating Faith you're
[51:21] Gathering it you're collecting faith
[51:23] building your faith Bank up amen amen
[51:25] because we're going to look at now if we
[51:27] could look at the victories that the
[51:28] Lord has won in the past
[51:30] amen and in our lives and see that by
[51:33] faith that God if God has given the
[51:34] first Victory then he'll give the next
[51:36] Victory and if he's promised and
[51:38] fulfilled the first promise he will
[51:39] fulfill every promise and ought to
[51:41] accumulate a faith in you and I that
[51:43] he's more than able to do that which he
[51:45] has promised
[51:46] hallelujah amen that's you know
[51:49] that's how we should be we come to
[51:51] accumulate faith and we can accumulate
[51:53] Faith from every Divine promise in the
[51:55] scripture we can see every type and
[51:56] Shadow that we're here to fulfill it we
[51:58] should accumulate Faith through them
[51:59] amen to you and see Esther now she no
[52:02] doubt she was you know it's a strange
[52:04] thing that she was fearful to God to the
[52:06] prince of the king in the great hour of
[52:08] need where Haman had written the law
[52:10] that you know all the Jews were going to
[52:11] die of the 12th I mean 13th day the 12th
[52:14] month you know that was Laura you know
[52:16] in the kingdom and in this great hour
[52:18] where she could go in and get access to
[52:19] the king like no one else could she was
[52:21] afraid to do so but you know you really
[52:23] think about the you know the the
[52:26] position she was in
[52:28] the crown was given to her
[52:30] the crown that she put on was given to
[52:33] her by the king
[52:35] the robes that she put on were given to
[52:37] her by the king it wasn't her own robes
[52:40] these were these were given to her amen
[52:42] amen they you know the you know the shoe
[52:45] she put on they were given to her by the
[52:47] king
[52:48] you know so she had to you know put
[52:50] those things on now you think about you
[52:52] and I this crown of Grace that's been
[52:55] given to us
[52:56] God gave it to you
[52:57] God gave it to you he put it on your
[52:59] head the Rope of his righteousness that
[53:01] you wear the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:03] the word he gave it to you amen he is or
[53:07] die ordained that you should be a raid
[53:08] and fine linen and clean and white I
[53:10] meant to be to be shot with the gospel
[53:12] preparation of Peace of the Gospel he
[53:14] gave you that I mean so so he's he's a
[53:18] raid you to go into his presence
[53:20] you know you think about how great it is
[53:22] in this hour
[53:24] the reality of justification see all
[53:27] these things should accumulate Faith now
[53:29] Martin Luther would preach to Josh shall
[53:31] live by faith we're justified by our
[53:33] faith but true justification is not just
[53:35] a forgiveness it's a inevited in the
[53:37] first place that's the kind of
[53:39] justification that you know we live
[53:40] under now you've got to think about now
[53:41] where where is the first place now the
[53:44] first place before there is anything
[53:45] upon the Earth anything in existence was
[53:47] in God's mind so when God thought of you
[53:50] he saw you just like he said about Joby
[53:52] asked job where were you when I laid the
[53:54] foundations of the earth and the morning
[53:55] Stars sang For Joy and shouted and he's
[53:58] trying to get job to see job you were
[53:59] with me when I did those things you were
[54:02] shouting you're rejoicing job I didn't
[54:04] see you in my mind on an ashy this is
[54:06] not your final destination you're just
[54:08] passing through this Trail because I
[54:10] want to show you the resurrection but
[54:12] when it all is said and done what I
[54:13] thought of you in the beginning you're
[54:15] going to be in the End Amen so when he
[54:17] thought of you he didn't see you in your
[54:19] sins and your struggles and your trials
[54:21] and your troubles and your past and your
[54:22] burdens he didn't see you like anything
[54:24] be shouting and rejoicing and worshiping
[54:27] around the throne amen so that's why we
[54:30] say we never did it in the first place
[54:31] that's how God thought of us you think
[54:33] about sanctification now the methodists
[54:36] would say there's a method to being
[54:37] sanctified
[54:38] where where they lived the holy life out
[54:40] of their own human effort to be
[54:41] sanctified people and you know God
[54:43] worked on that but true sanctification
[54:45] is not us trying to cleanse ourselves
[54:47] right but a true sanctification is when
[54:49] the blood comes and cleanses our desires
[54:52] cleanses those things the world from us
[54:54] that there's nothing in us that wants it
[54:55] anymore that's a true sanctification
[54:57] amen Hallelujah now then you take the
[55:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Pentecost
[55:01] will say well they've got gifts and
[55:03] they've been anointed therefore they
[55:04] have it but the true baptism of the Holy
[55:06] Ghost is that on the day of Pentecost
[55:08] where God came and didn't dwelt his
[55:10] people and then walked in them talked to
[55:12] them acted through them manifested his
[55:14] word through their lives I bet you think
[55:16] shouldn't that accumulate faith in our
[55:18] hearts I've been Justified
[55:20] Hallelujah I never did it in the first
[55:22] place I've been Sanctified amen all the
[55:25] desires for the world are gone where'd
[55:27] they go I don't know but I don't want
[55:28] them back they're not boomerangs they're
[55:30] gone Hallelujah I've been filled with
[55:33] the spirit of God all that God is he's
[55:36] poured into the church he's poured into
[55:37] you and I amen now I'm a living
[55:39] Tabernacle of the Living God hallelujah
[55:42] shouldn't that accumulate Faith but but
[55:45] why did he do that it's because we're
[55:47] part of this amen is a prophecy of a
[55:49] bride that's being laying on the pages
[55:51] of the Bible amen and we just happen to
[55:53] be in the season because when God saw it
[55:55] when he would write in Revelations 19
[55:57] let us be glad and rejoice
[56:00] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[56:02] and his wife has made herself ready and
[56:05] unto her be she should be a right and
[56:07] like fine linen clean and white which is
[56:09] the righteousness of saints you know
[56:11] when John penned that he saw it in
[56:12] symbol form God thought of you
[56:15] God thought of you because remember a
[56:17] prophecy must have someone to fulfill it
[56:19] it's not just put there and God says
[56:21] well you know it's not like some
[56:22] algorithm or some guesstimation where
[56:24] maybe someone will step into it and
[56:26] fulfill it it well that was close enough
[56:28] so therefore that must be the
[56:29] Fulfillment no that's not how it works
[56:31] that's not how it works when God speaks
[56:33] something he knows exactly who's going
[56:35] to fulfill it when it's going to be
[56:36] fulfilled and how it's going to be
[56:38] fulfilled so when we saw the marriage
[56:40] supper of the Lamb when that was when
[56:41] that was prophesied through John God
[56:43] thought of you
[56:45] amen hallelujah
[56:46] shouldn't that accumulate faith that I'm
[56:49] not just coming through to sing into a
[56:51] haphazard way or maybe you know stab in
[56:53] the dark but God ordained that you would
[56:56] hear his word that you respond to his
[56:58] word you'll become one with his word
[57:00] you'd manifest that word through your
[57:02] life Hallelujah and that's what God just
[57:04] like Esther Esther was ordained before
[57:07] she knew she was ordained she was called
[57:09] before she realized it and she was in a
[57:11] position but she had to step into that
[57:13] position and use it
[57:15] amen
[57:18] so she was afraid to go before the king
[57:21] because the law said none could come
[57:23] without being summoned but Grace always
[57:25] overshadows the law Hallelujah that's
[57:28] why when she walked into the king's
[57:30] presence he extended the scepter of
[57:32] Grace to her pardoning grace amen
[57:35] there's something else is I must go to
[57:37] the king I cannot stay in this position
[57:39] I can't stay with this death threat over
[57:41] me and my family I've got to go before
[57:43] the king the losses you can't but Grace
[57:45] said I provided a blood for you to come
[57:47] into my presence amen then extended a
[57:50] scepter of grace to you you touched the
[57:52] head of it and he says now what is your
[57:53] request that's amazing you're the king
[57:55] the main thing he seems to say and
[57:57] Esther to me is now what is your request
[57:59] what do you have need of today well
[58:02] you've come into my presence for a
[58:03] reason you've come to church for a
[58:05] reason what is your request today what's
[58:07] going on in your life remember you've
[58:09] got to speak it to him he knows all
[58:11] about it but you've got to voice it to
[58:12] him because he wants to have a
[58:13] relationship amen he wants to have a
[58:16] communion with you will you speak to him
[58:17] and he speaks back Amen to the king says
[58:20] no what is your request I'll give you
[58:22] even up to half my kingdom now that does
[58:25] not mean now God split the Persian
[58:27] Empire into two into sdu of the Eastern
[58:29] side I'll have the Western no that
[58:30] that's not what it means it actually
[58:32] means I'll make you co-ear with me I
[58:35] mean I'll be Co I'll make you join air
[58:38] and that's exactly what our Lord Has
[58:40] Done where it says that we are now joint
[58:42] is
[58:43] amen and if children let's go to Romans
[58:46] 8 and 15 for for we have not received
[58:49] the spirit of bondage again to fear
[58:50] that's not the anointing we're under but
[58:53] we have received the spirit of adoption
[58:55] whereby we cry Abba Father or my father
[58:57] we know who our father is you know who
[58:58] your daddy is
[59:00] amen the spirit itself beareth witness
[59:03] with our spirit that we are the children
[59:04] of God and if children then ears ears of
[59:08] God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be
[59:10] that we suffer with them that we may
[59:12] also be glorified together so we're
[59:15] joint is now that word jointly a means a
[59:17] co-ear amen we are we are ears together
[59:20] so all that the Lord Jesus now remember
[59:22] he fell into all things
[59:25] all things old Power and Heaven and
[59:27] Earth is given to him right so so he
[59:30] conquered all things but he didn't want
[59:31] to just he didn't just purchase it for
[59:33] himself he wanted to enjoy the victory
[59:36] with his bride with his wife I mean so
[59:39] he now elevates Us by his own blood to
[59:41] be joining us with him police all that
[59:43] he fell here too we fall there too maybe
[59:46] not because we have done anything to
[59:47] Meredith no but because he fell into it
[59:49] and he wants to share it so he wants to
[59:51] share the victory he wants to share The
[59:53] Spoils of War he wants to share the
[59:55] Feast of his word he wants to share his
[59:57] presence with you and I that's what he
[59:58] wants to do I mean the word realize
[1:00:00] we're falling into every Divine promise
[1:00:02] every promise right now is yours in the
[1:00:05] scripture
[1:00:06] wouldn't that accumulate faith that's
[1:00:08] all that's all yours that's all yours
[1:00:11] right now or maybe one day no now
[1:00:14] right now it's yours
[1:00:16] Hallelujah so I'll make you join here
[1:00:19] amen so because he says what will thou
[1:00:21] Queen Esther what does I request that
[1:00:22] shall be given unto even half the
[1:00:24] kingdom now
[1:00:26] when she went in before the king she
[1:00:28] invited him to a banquet of wines no I
[1:00:30] know you know the story but let's just
[1:00:31] enjoy it today praise the Lord because
[1:00:33] we're having a feast of Purim every day
[1:00:35] I mean where the name of the devil's
[1:00:37] we're going to be blotted out under
[1:00:38] heaven and we're celebrating that day
[1:00:40] right now we need to be thrown to the
[1:00:41] Lake of Fire so if he was cast out of
[1:00:43] your life remember the first factories
[1:00:45] won the final Victory will be won where
[1:00:47] death will be no more hallelujah amen
[1:00:50] isn't that right so if we can we can
[1:00:52] Rejoice now because if this has happened
[1:00:54] that's gonna happen Hallelujah so she
[1:00:57] invited him and the enemy you think why
[1:00:59] would you invite your enemy but you know
[1:01:01] he sets the table before us at the
[1:01:03] Prince of our enemy God is not afraid to
[1:01:05] set a feast up for you with the devil in
[1:01:08] your presence he says just come eat you
[1:01:10] just come eat and fish sure he's there
[1:01:12] makers boasts whatever more but just eat
[1:01:13] on the word just enjoy his presence
[1:01:16] Hallelujah no I I you know I can do that
[1:01:18] too you know
[1:01:19] praise the Lord
[1:01:22] I don't have enough room we need to pick
[1:01:23] a church
[1:01:28] a banquet of wines no there's something
[1:01:30] that moves the heart of God
[1:01:32] it's it's real worship it's not a
[1:01:35] performance but a real heartfelt worship
[1:01:38] worship from the heart moves the heart
[1:01:40] of God Amen that's what we want to do
[1:01:42] that our lives would move as hard amen
[1:01:45] that he just hears us say thank you Lord
[1:01:46] a real thankful heart now it can be
[1:01:49] expressive it can be quiet but it's what
[1:01:50] the heart projects out amen
[1:01:53] as as really what matters you know you
[1:01:55] can be dancing the aisles you can have a
[1:01:57] tear run down your cheek but it can have
[1:01:58] the same effect right but but that moves
[1:02:01] the heart of God
[1:02:02] and so now the King was invited to this
[1:02:05] banquet of wines now we have the biggest
[1:02:07] wine banquet there's ever been in the
[1:02:09] history of man we have a seven seal we
[1:02:12] have a seven sealed menu we have a seven
[1:02:14] course menu of the word all of God
[1:02:16] remember Jeff remember the prophet said
[1:02:18] the the opening of these seals reveals
[1:02:21] Christ
[1:02:22] rice is not just horse riders and
[1:02:25] tribulation and the Jews and although
[1:02:26] it's Christ being revealed through all
[1:02:28] those seals right so it's Christ being
[1:02:30] real the word being revealed amen so we
[1:02:33] have the biggest banquet of wines we
[1:02:34] could ever have because amen Revelation
[1:02:37] causes a stimulation
[1:02:40] right so the oil is the Revelation the
[1:02:42] anointing comes down on the word anoints
[1:02:44] it to our hearts and then it stimulates
[1:02:46] us we act like drunk people we get
[1:02:47] excited
[1:02:48] Hallelujah that's why that's why you
[1:02:50] know we get here on Wednesday hearing
[1:02:52] brother Chris preach about the Queen of
[1:02:53] Sheba that's getting a bit drunk I was
[1:02:55] getting a bit happy well it was a
[1:02:58] revelation with anchoring praise the
[1:03:00] Lord just like at Camp getting a bit
[1:03:01] drunk yeah we're a bunch of happy drunk
[1:03:03] amen we're not we're not depressed
[1:03:06] drunks we're happy drunks because what
[1:03:08] happens is you know someone who's drunk
[1:03:09] the real them comes out the inhibitions
[1:03:11] go amen right so when you get drunk in
[1:03:13] the spirit of happiness comes out
[1:03:15] because that's who you really are you
[1:03:16] can be having a bad day you can feel
[1:03:18] down you can be depressed you can be
[1:03:20] troubled but when you get drunk in the
[1:03:21] spirit amen a happiness comes forth
[1:03:23] because that's the real you that's right
[1:03:25] Hallelujah so don't ever go by your
[1:03:27] feelings sure we all have bad days we
[1:03:29] have ups and downs we have trouble
[1:03:30] sometimes but that's not the real us
[1:03:32] that does not define you being a
[1:03:35] Christian you're a Christian because you
[1:03:37] took God in his word you came God's
[1:03:39] provided away you repented were baptized
[1:03:41] in his name filled with his holy ghost
[1:03:43] living according to his word that's what
[1:03:45] makes you a Christian because you can
[1:03:47] believe and receive the word that's what
[1:03:50] makes you a Christian not not better
[1:03:51] with reasoning but you can welcome and
[1:03:53] receive it amen hallelujah so so it
[1:03:56] moves the heart of the king now the king
[1:03:57] can't sleep after the first banquet
[1:04:00] he can't sleep he can't rest it's
[1:04:02] something stirring within him sure maybe
[1:04:04] before that he could sleep every night
[1:04:05] but now there's a time of action
[1:04:08] and now his memory's got to be stirred
[1:04:10] up so he calls for the for the records
[1:04:12] of the Kingdom to be read
[1:04:14] and finally it gets to the place where
[1:04:16] it would speak of when Mordecai would
[1:04:19] tell the king about the about the plot
[1:04:21] of a big thing and cherish you know
[1:04:24] trying to kill him and how Mordecai
[1:04:26] exposed the plot and then the king now
[1:04:29] asks well what did Mordecai receive what
[1:04:31] was his reward and the answer was well
[1:04:33] he received no reward that's right so
[1:04:35] now what happened is the where where
[1:04:37] what I love about it is God God loves to
[1:04:40] change the story
[1:04:42] Heyman no doubt was feeling very rested
[1:04:44] in himself even though he was angry and
[1:04:47] he couldn't well okay he was rest
[1:04:49] assured that on the 13th day of Adar the
[1:04:52] Jews are going to get wiped out it was
[1:04:54] law it was basically done he was just
[1:04:57] waiting for that time to come
[1:04:59] right but then and it's the same thing
[1:05:01] with the devil he thinks yeah I've got
[1:05:03] them
[1:05:04] there's no way they're ever going to
[1:05:05] meet God I've watered them off in their
[1:05:07] mind they've caught up in all kinds of
[1:05:08] things this is just how it is but then
[1:05:10] God always interrupts the devil's plans
[1:05:12] anyways interrupts the devil's plan he
[1:05:14] intercedes where we think there's no way
[1:05:16] it can be done God steps down that's why
[1:05:19] we always don't look at what you see but
[1:05:21] look at what you believe I mean take the
[1:05:23] word above what you see above what you
[1:05:25] hear above what you feel take the
[1:05:27] promise more than what you see amen so
[1:05:30] so the devil's plan was interrupted
[1:05:33] and it all began to change when the
[1:05:35] records came open
[1:05:37] amen so so when the book came open the
[1:05:40] records when the seals came off the book
[1:05:43] amen and the Scribe began to re read the
[1:05:45] history of the kingdom it was sealed in
[1:05:48] the records but now the book comes out
[1:05:50] the lamb steps forth and takes the book
[1:05:52] and opens the seals of it and then the
[1:05:55] history begins to be read then the king
[1:05:57] says no
[1:05:59] why wasn't he rewarded
[1:06:01] hallelujah what happened is now the
[1:06:04] fortunes are reversing the tables are
[1:06:06] being turned we live in a season where
[1:06:08] the tables have been turned against the
[1:06:10] enemy we are no longer under his feet
[1:06:12] but he's under Alfie amen we are no
[1:06:14] longer his slaves but he must do what we
[1:06:17] say Amen where he once used us to bring
[1:06:19] his kingdom forth now we God uses to
[1:06:22] tear his kingdom down Hallelujah so
[1:06:24] never ever diminish the fact God has
[1:06:26] loosed you from his clutches amen the
[1:06:28] best claws have been ripped off your
[1:06:30] life amen he's now a trophy on your wall
[1:06:33] and you stand Victorious
[1:06:35] Hallelujah do you believe that this
[1:06:37] morning
[1:06:37] hey man don't ever let the devil wrestle
[1:06:40] in your mind saying you're not an
[1:06:41] overcomer you're an overcomer
[1:06:43] he always tries to reclaim that which he
[1:06:45] was cast out from but I tell you we are
[1:06:47] not his property no one in this room or
[1:06:50] maybe listing here as his property I
[1:06:52] remember we're free Sons and Daughters
[1:06:54] of God hallelujah so when the book came
[1:06:56] open then then the fortunes of what was
[1:06:59] going on were totally reversed
[1:07:01] Hallelujah and then now then now the
[1:07:04] king rewarded Mordecai and his enemy had
[1:07:08] to pray them through the streets
[1:07:10] on the king's horse and the King's
[1:07:12] apparel with the crown of the king there
[1:07:13] and everything
[1:07:15] and then now
[1:07:16] now it was Haman was caught up in a
[1:07:18] whirlwind of events that it was totally
[1:07:20] out of his control you know this world
[1:07:22] is actually totally out of the devil's
[1:07:24] control
[1:07:25] God is supreme over all things right God
[1:07:28] is Supreme Over All Things We may think
[1:07:30] all the Devils controlling the world he
[1:07:32] has a he has a limitation of control
[1:07:34] that God has ordained and allowed him to
[1:07:37] do
[1:07:38] praise God nothing can happen in this
[1:07:41] world without God saying yes first
[1:07:44] you know the devil is the biggest
[1:07:45] lobbyist there is who knows what a
[1:07:47] lobbyist is they'll Lobby the government
[1:07:49] say you're pushing their agendas they
[1:07:51] have no Authority but they'll just
[1:07:53] they'll just they'll just get into the
[1:07:55] air of politicians and begin to whisper
[1:07:56] what they want and you know they're paid
[1:07:58] to do things and you know they Lobby the
[1:08:01] devil is the worst lobbyist there is
[1:08:03] well we're going to realize that he is
[1:08:05] the accuser of the brethren this is what
[1:08:08] his lobbying is all about to stand
[1:08:10] before God and to accuse us before God
[1:08:13] day and night outside that's what he
[1:08:16] does
[1:08:16] he accuses us but we've got to realize
[1:08:19] that actually he has no Authority no
[1:08:22] more
[1:08:23] you know where the devil will accuse
[1:08:24] will stand before God
[1:08:26] she did this and he did this and he said
[1:08:28] this and she did this and trying to pull
[1:08:30] up all of your past and use it against
[1:08:32] you but then the king actually goes into
[1:08:34] his records
[1:08:36] and says hold on but in my records which
[1:08:38] are perfect amen all there is against
[1:08:40] their name is a blank as a blank as a
[1:08:43] blank sheet hallelujah it's been
[1:08:46] eradicated by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:48] it's all gone amen but he's a lobbyist
[1:08:51] see he will go before God and try and
[1:08:54] stop God's plans
[1:08:57] amen just like before we went to Canada
[1:08:59] you know the law was speaking to
[1:09:00] Christine about how the devil's trying
[1:09:01] to give you covert he's trying to stop
[1:09:02] your flights he's just trying to stop
[1:09:04] the trip but what are you asking
[1:09:06] and we know the story The Storm turned
[1:09:09] up too late we flew out and while we we
[1:09:11] just had a staycation when we got home
[1:09:13] let's praise the Lord yeah so yeah the
[1:09:15] devil's plans were defeated see so but
[1:09:18] you see now if if the devil's a lobbyist
[1:09:21] how much more you and I to go before the
[1:09:24] Throne of God to intercede for others to
[1:09:28] plead the blood over other people Amen
[1:09:31] to go before him because the devil wants
[1:09:33] to kill maimon destroy but now what
[1:09:36] should we do now because he's a
[1:09:39] full-time devil
[1:09:40] right we should be full-time believers
[1:09:43] amen so you see here that you're in
[1:09:45] you're in the Book of Job Satan would
[1:09:47] Lobby for job's life because the Lord
[1:09:50] would point out to the devil how great
[1:09:52] job is he's a perfect man
[1:09:54] right but but then the devil says here
[1:09:57] in Job 1 and 9 then Satan answered the
[1:09:59] Lord and said doth job fair God for
[1:10:01] naught Hast not Thou made a hedge about
[1:10:04] him and about his house and about all
[1:10:06] that he hath on every side that was
[1:10:08] bless the work of his hands and his
[1:10:09] substance has increased in the land put
[1:10:11] forth don't hand now and touch all that
[1:10:13] he has and he will curse thee to thy
[1:10:16] face and the Lord said unto Satan and
[1:10:18] behold all that he hath is in my power
[1:10:20] on
[1:10:22] by may only upon himself put forth not
[1:10:24] thy hand so Satan went forth from the
[1:10:27] presence of the Lord so you see now
[1:10:29] Satan had some limitations of what he
[1:10:31] could do but it's because he was
[1:10:33] lobbying God let me touch him let me get
[1:10:36] a hold of his life he only loves you
[1:10:38] because everything goes fine for him but
[1:10:39] God had confidence in job just like God
[1:10:41] has confidence in you amen that you know
[1:10:44] the devil go up and Lobby to try and get
[1:10:46] a hold of your life or or allow a trial
[1:10:48] or sickness or something to strike your
[1:10:50] family or to strike you but God has
[1:10:52] confidence in you not in your Humanity
[1:10:55] now but in the seed he put in your soul
[1:10:56] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:10:59] to now just as God at confidence and job
[1:11:01] under the blood of bulls and ghosts how
[1:11:02] much more you and I under the blood of
[1:11:04] Jesus Christ and I knew I'm better
[1:11:06] Covenant than that right amen so Now
[1:11:10] esther was elevated into the position of
[1:11:12] Queen
[1:11:12] amen and she went into the prince of the
[1:11:15] king and now the King was moved by by
[1:11:18] the first banquet of wines and then now
[1:11:20] the records were yo yo I'm just
[1:11:22] reviewing quickly then the records came
[1:11:23] open and now the whole whole course of
[1:11:26] the Story begins to change when the word
[1:11:29] came open now it's the same thing in
[1:11:31] this hour the word has come open now the
[1:11:33] course of the story is changing because

[1:14:28] would become flesh that he is supreme
[1:14:31] deity that he had sit on the throne of

[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:29] see there'll be a people that are truly
[1:15:31] one with him
[1:15:33] have been so made that God's nature is
[1:15:36] in them
[1:15:37] I'm not going to read this from Oneness
[1:15:39] now the first man of first woman in the
[1:15:41] Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[1:15:42] with God so much that God could come
[1:15:45] down at any time he desired to talk lip
[1:15:47] to ear with Adam and Eve now that is
[1:15:50] perfect Oneness God and His creation God
[1:15:52] speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve
[1:15:55] now they were so perfect in harmony uh
[1:15:57] with God till they were one with God God
[1:16:00] and his family was one any man in his
[1:16:02] family a correct good Noble obedient
[1:16:04] family as one with another any family
[1:16:07] and if there's something in the family
[1:16:08] that moves them apart then it's not
[1:16:10] right the family's broken somewhere they
[1:16:12] should all be one father with Mother
[1:16:14] Mother with father children with parent
[1:16:15] parent with child all in agreement and
[1:16:18] when you see that you'll see one lovely
[1:16:20] picture that's God's purpose and his
[1:16:23] purpose is Father Supreme was to be one
[1:16:25] with his family Earthly family Adam and
[1:16:28] Eve and the only way they could be one
[1:16:30] with the family all with God was because
[1:16:32] God's nature was in them so that made
[1:16:35] them with God's nature in them then with
[1:16:37] each other and God they all become one
[1:16:40] isn't that a beautiful picture God and
[1:16:42] his family father over all Supreme no
[1:16:45] death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing
[1:16:47] just joy unspeakable never to be sick
[1:16:50] never to have a heartache just one with
[1:16:52] God what a picture because the very
[1:16:54] nature of God was in these people and
[1:16:56] therefore what they did they followed
[1:16:58] just in line with God and God with them
[1:17:01] made them one
[1:17:03] praise the Lord now it is not the very
[1:17:05] nature of God and it's by the baptism of
[1:17:07] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:08] hey man Hallelujah so now at the very
[1:17:12] nature of God is in us then we are one
[1:17:14] with God
[1:17:15] praise the Lord irrespective of our
[1:17:18] feelings and different things so now at
[1:17:20] the very Nature's in us now
[1:17:22] we can now Rejoice because we'll just
[1:17:24] follow in line with God we'll follow in
[1:17:27] line with his word you can't help but to
[1:17:29] follow in line with it because you are
[1:17:30] one with him
[1:17:32] Hallelujah said no Here Comes Easter you
[1:17:35] know I'm going to wrap this up about
[1:17:36] soon but you know you see now remember
[1:17:40] real worship moves the heart of God

[1:17:46] of God as you know that God's uh our
[1:17:49] desires will be released to us brother
[1:17:51] Braham says the reason that the angel of
[1:17:52] God comes down into the meetings is that
[1:17:54] God would release our desires to us so
[1:17:57] if we ever desire for healing or for
[1:17:59] salvation or for deliverance maybe
[1:18:00] someone not even here but somewhere else
[1:18:02] God can release that desire to you and I

[1:21:21] Christ they had known a lot of trust

[1:21:24] accuser because he is the not the
[1:21:27] Creator but he perverted amen
[1:21:29] righteousness into sin and cause it all
[1:21:32] to happen so there'll be a that day

[1:25:28] family with her people because she was
[1:25:30] one of them we're gonna have feelings
[1:25:31] for our family and loved ones who are
[1:25:33] lost and undone we're going to say while
[1:25:35] they're there and here I am and you know
[1:25:37] we said no she included herself because
[1:25:39] she was one of them
[1:25:41] Hallelujah
[1:25:42] and she said look King
[1:25:45] my life is under death

[1:25:50] who would who would dare touch my queen
[1:25:52] who did come against my wife who would
[1:25:55] did try and take her life you know yo
[1:25:58] many times we're scared the wrath of God
[1:25:59] will be poured out upon us
[1:26:01] you know God's Wrath was poured out that
[1:26:03] down Calvary
[1:26:04] Jesus took our judgment
[1:26:06] the Judgment we should have received it
[1:26:08] was poured out upon him remember the
[1:26:11] price of sin was a great price yes when
[1:26:13] he was mad more than any man he hung on
[1:26:15] Calvary Between Heaven and Earth a great
[1:26:17] price was paid the Judgment we should
[1:26:20] have received he took it all
[1:26:22] Hallelujah so the wrath of God cannot
[1:26:24] come upon you because it's come upon him
[1:26:26] he fulfilled it that damn Calvary amen
[1:26:29] right remember he went as a sinner to
[1:26:31] Hell on your behalf that you don't have
[1:26:33] to go
[1:26:34] oh Hallelujah he paid it all that's why
[1:26:37] we don't have to go through a Great
[1:26:38] Tribulation for a purging because he
[1:26:40] took all of our judgment everything that
[1:26:42] day
[1:26:43] so the wrath of God you say well that's
[1:26:45] pretty bold this is how I feel yes I
[1:26:47] stand sinless righteous mindless image
[1:26:50] no spot against me because of his blood
[1:26:52] I can stand in confidence so there's no
[1:26:54] judgment for me because he took my
[1:26:56] judgment that down Calvary and I can
[1:26:58] come before his presence anytime I have
[1:27:00] need of so we get scared oh the wrath of
[1:27:03] God's gonna be poured out against us now
[1:27:05] the only one the wrath of God is going
[1:27:07] to be poured out against the is Satan
[1:27:09] righteous like the Wrath of the King was
[1:27:11] poured out against Haman
[1:27:12] Hallelujah
[1:27:14] amen that is the same thing with you and
[1:27:16] I see see we should never be afraid
[1:27:18] God's Gonna punish us sure he can
[1:27:20] correct us but he's not going to pour
[1:27:22] His wrath out against us he wants to
[1:27:23] guide Our Lives correct us because he
[1:27:25] wants a closer walk so it's a good thing
[1:27:27] when those things happen
[1:27:28] right but we're not going to receive his
[1:27:31] judgment because he took his judgment
[1:27:32] that don't he took out judgment on
[1:27:33] Calvary praise the Lord amen said no the
[1:27:37] Wrath of the King was poured out against
[1:27:38] Haman right and then he was hang on The
[1:27:41] Gallows The Gallows that were made for
[1:27:42] Mordecai he was hung on them just like
[1:27:45] this whole you know the devil thinks
[1:27:47] he's going to destroy you and I but
[1:27:49] actually it's actually just going to
[1:27:50] destroy him
[1:27:51] well he thinks that the seed of God will
[1:27:54] be thrown to the Lake of Fire not one of
[1:27:55] them are gonna go
[1:27:57] one of them can go God cannot lose a
[1:27:59] part of himself
[1:28:00] Hallelujah
[1:28:02] amen now we're going to have a burden
[1:28:04] that we're going to realize people that
[1:28:05] we speak to our families they're part of
[1:28:07] God
[1:28:08] so they can't be lost Lord they've got
[1:28:10] to come I believe they're part of you
[1:28:13] Hallelujah and then said no
[1:28:16] the Wrath of the King was poured out
[1:28:18] against Haman but that's not the end of
[1:28:20] it
[1:28:21] wait no actually the Signet ring the of
[1:28:24] authority was given to Mordecai to
[1:28:26] Easter to write another law to
[1:28:28] overshadow what the devil had done
[1:28:30] Hallelujah so now the Signet ring of
[1:28:33] authority has been given to the bride
[1:28:34] what ye say whatever you bought on Earth
[1:28:37] shall be bound in heaven whatever is
[1:28:39] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:28:40] right she's got it he's given you the
[1:28:42] power to speak right to reverse what the
[1:28:45] devil has done
[1:28:47] sure to be according to the word it
[1:28:48] won't be outside the word don't get me
[1:28:50] wrong about those things but you have
[1:28:51] power to speak amen where are we
[1:28:53] speaking faith that now that God will
[1:28:56] work on your behalf
[1:28:57] Hallelujah that's amazing though even
[1:29:00] though that the law was reversed even
[1:29:02] though Heyman was hung even though it
[1:29:04] was proclaimed that actually Mordecai
[1:29:06] was now the Prime Minister and he was a
[1:29:08] Jew there's still some people still yeah
[1:29:10] gathered to try and destroy the Jews
[1:29:14] the devil's back was broken on Calvary
[1:29:16] he's just a wounded animal right and
[1:29:19] sputs but for some reason the devil
[1:29:21] still try and band together to come
[1:29:23] against you and I to destroy us right
[1:29:26] but the law the word has been reversed
[1:29:28] now that we are the Victor and not the
[1:29:30] victim amen amen amen we are the Victor
[1:29:32] we are the Overcomer Hallelujah but what
[1:29:35] I love about it is that they were given
[1:29:37] a day where they could actually go and
[1:29:38] destroy their enemies the Jews could and
[1:29:40] take their spoils I mean with the Enemy
[1:29:42] may have stole their joy and stole their
[1:29:44] peace and stole their love and stole
[1:29:45] their long suffering and all those
[1:29:47] things they could come and take those
[1:29:48] spoils back Hallelujah but it didn't
[1:29:50] just happen once it happened twice you
[1:29:53] gotta read the book of Esther they
[1:29:54] didn't just do it once they did it twice
[1:29:55] amen so we shouldn't be satisfied with
[1:29:57] one victory
[1:29:59] let's go kill them again let's go out
[1:30:01] and Destroy enemies again take back
[1:30:03] things again
[1:30:05] Hallelujah
[1:30:07] praise the Lord
[1:30:10] Hallelujah
[1:30:12] amen
[1:30:14] praise the Lord no it says here see
[1:30:17] we live in a different hour now
[1:30:19] we once were in mourning now we're in
[1:30:21] rejoicing
[1:30:22] now why is this a feast of Purim because
[1:30:24] we're going to realize if God has won
[1:30:26] the victory here here he's won the
[1:30:29] victory here
[1:30:30] Hallelujah your brother bam said this is
[1:30:32] such a precious quote here with you know
[1:30:35] maybe I'll finish you know I'm about to
[1:30:36] close her I'm trying to close or one of
[1:30:37] those things now he says and and here he
[1:30:40] says now doesn't Lord show us the father
[1:30:42] and it's sufficeth us he says and that's
[1:30:45] the way a Christian is we are planted
[1:30:47] together in Christ Jesus who is the
[1:30:50] inexhaustible Fountain of Life we're
[1:30:52] planted in Christ we just drink and
[1:30:54] drink and drink and push out
[1:30:56] and everything we have need of for the
[1:30:58] Earthly Journey everything

[1:31:18] everything you have need of for this
[1:31:20] life's journey even the Rapture is right
[1:31:23] in you then that's right
[1:31:24] that's right praise God you said well I
[1:31:26] need faith for a Rapture if you've got
[1:31:28] the Holy Ghost that's in you the Rapture
[1:31:30] is actually already in you see it should
[1:31:32] take all the fear out am I going to make
[1:31:34] it well if you've really got the Holy
[1:31:35] Ghost you're there
[1:31:36] hey man you the the Rapture is already
[1:31:39] in you now
[1:31:41] hello aces are proven by the gospel
[1:31:43] those who he called he justified and
[1:31:45] those who he justified he hath glorified
[1:31:47] Hallelujah then in heaven today we are
[1:31:50] glorified and the prince of God now he
[1:31:52] says I'm just pushing out to it
[1:31:55] amen so now he's just pushing out to it
[1:31:57] he's just growing into it praise the
[1:31:59] Lord and that's what we're doing it's
[1:32:01] already within us but we're just pushing
[1:32:02] out we're just growing out into it amen
[1:32:04] amen see it's already in me but it's
[1:32:07] just going to become material
[1:32:09] praise the Lord see one day the Rapture
[1:32:11] will become material these bodies will
[1:32:13] be changed right it's already the
[1:32:15] rapture's already within but it's gonna
[1:32:16] because remember God works from the
[1:32:18] inside out he doesn't work from the
[1:32:19] outside in he works from the inside out
[1:32:21] that's why your heart's will be going to
[1:32:23] change from doubt to Faith right and
[1:32:26] then and then and then there goes from
[1:32:28] the Outside Inside Out see it's already
[1:32:31] in me it's just becoming material like a
[1:32:33] little baby growing into an adult all of
[1:32:35] their potentials they'll reach in
[1:32:37] intelligence ability stature is already
[1:32:40] in them by their DNA
[1:32:42] praise the Lord now Sons and Daughters
[1:32:44] of God have a spiritual DNA amen that
[1:32:47] now we're just pushing out to it we just
[1:32:49] drink and push out that's why it's so
[1:32:51] important Amen to feed on the word
[1:32:54] feed on the word listen to the tapes
[1:32:56] read your Bible pray every day absorb it
[1:32:58] comprehend it meditate upon it think on
[1:33:01] the promises right what are you doing
[1:33:03] drinking then you begin to push out
[1:33:05] amen every promise is already laying
[1:33:07] there
[1:33:08] now the reason we can have a feast of
[1:33:10] pyramid we can Rejoice from what because
[1:33:11] one Victory is one that means the other
[1:33:13] one's coming it's because if God has
[1:33:16] promised one he's gonna he's fulfilled
[1:33:18] one he'll fulfill the other that's why
[1:33:20] it's so important acts 16 it says it's
[1:33:22] about the Philippine Jailer and he
[1:33:24] brought the mountain sirs what must I do
[1:33:25] to be saved and they said believe in the
[1:33:27] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be
[1:33:30] saved and thy house
[1:33:32] right so now he would already become a
[1:33:34] Believer now what must I do he was
[1:33:36] already a Believer believe on the Lord
[1:33:38] Jesus Christ and thine and thy house
[1:33:40] shall be saved Hallelujah so now if one
[1:33:44] party will be fulfilled the next part
[1:33:45] will be fulfilled you're following me
[1:33:48] that's why we can have confidence now we
[1:33:49] could have a feast of pyramid say the
[1:33:51] devil's being defeated amen Hallelujah
[1:33:53] one Victor has been one another Victory
[1:33:55] is on the way but because this Victory
[1:33:57] is being won this Victory is going to be
[1:33:58] won but it's just time has to go until
[1:34:00] that Victory is won but it's as good as
[1:34:03] done that's why we can rejoice and shout
[1:34:05] and praise God Amen that now
[1:34:08] there's the time
[1:34:10] we can have a feast of Purim just like
[1:34:12] every year they commemorate Haman being
[1:34:15] killed the victory that happened back
[1:34:17] there now we can take every Victory
[1:34:19] through the scripture let it and look at
[1:34:21] them it'll accumulate faith in your life
[1:34:23] take all the prayer lines take your own
[1:34:25] testimony testimonies Among Us and use
[1:34:28] it to accumulate Faith saying Lord you

[1:34:35] do it for my situation and accumulate
[1:34:38] Faith don't accumulate doubt and
[1:34:40] reasoning accumulate faith Hallelujah
[1:34:44] then we can go from sorrow to Joy from
[1:34:47] morning into a good day
[1:34:49] holidays from Esther 9 and 22. this is
[1:34:52] the time to go from sorrow to Joy from
