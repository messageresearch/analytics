seats uh let's open our Bibles at Matthew 18 and we're going to read there just a little bit of a portion of scripture I pray you've come with a need tonight I pray you have really I don't know sometimes I feel on Wednesdays it's all just a blur to get to church and it's a little bit all over the show but I pray that you'll just leave everything right at the door now and you just come and say Lord speak to me tonight amen I do believe the Lord has somewhat to speak to us tonight I'll try to keep it as short and fast as possible because it's a prayer evening um brother Ben did you get any other pray requests through okay so good you're all good so now we can have service amen so I can go into that no just joking okay let's just put that one on the screen Matthew 18 it says verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven and again I say unto you remember this is our Lord speaking that if two or more of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done of My Father which is in heaven for we two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we have opened this word but we know it's It's Only You Lord that can come and speak to our hearts and really open up to us what you want to tell us today Lord so we ask that you would speak completely take me out of out of the way Lord you just have preeminence For Your Glory and for your kingdom we welcome you in in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may have your seats Saints it's such a wonderful thing to be a Christian these days now I think sometimes the world don't really comprehend what it is to be a Christian they think Jesus Christ is a story they want to always go into creation and they always want an explanation for the supernatural but I want your attention young men young ladies I want your attention tonight he's alive he's very much alive and guess what he's even closer than your very next breath yeah see don't mean that you can't see the Lord he's not there don't mean that you come here and you might feel as dead as a door poost that God's not dealing with you sometimes when you pray you think you have to get into this realm of some some experience and emotion so that God would come down somewhere from Heaven to your level to answer your prayer that's not the case he's here he's the very present God he said I am the I am so when Moses came to him and he says when I go to Israel who do I tell them sent me he says I am because he didn't say my name is I am he said I'm the present God that's he says and when you come before Governors when people challenge you and and you come before a tight spot don't worry about what you're going to say I will put those words in your mouth so the very the I am is there but see he didn't make us boneless he didn't make us not strong and overcoming I think sometimes we heed too much to the devil's conversation and not enough to God's promis yeah we always see the negative we always see the oh why me we never just stop and go hold on what did he make me what am I what am I made of you know you you say the great creator that created heavens and earth comes and steps into a body and you can lay your hands on someone and they can recover amen it's not you doing the healing it's God anointing you to do it but see you still think oh I have to work myself up and brother brandom has a story where he says there was a pastor and or a man that sponsored one of his meetings man I'm already off my nose brother he sponsored one of his meetings and a wall fell over on on him and it burst his liver he was in hospital he was really bad and he was sitting talking to his wife and he says I a man with unclean hands but if Jesus went that way and he just laid his holy hands upon that man he shall recover so the prophet of God seeing Miracle upon Miracle says my hands are dirty have you ever thought about this this this man opened up the word and gave us Revelation and tell us thus sayith the Lord and it happened time and time again and he's unworthy and he's sitting there and he goes you know what but I know if Jesus gives me a vision and I walk to that man it's done and then he sits and thinks about it a little bit and he goes you know what hold on it's the same dirty hands if Jesus gives me a vision it's the same dirty hands that has to be laid on him so guess what I'm going to do I'm going to go to that man and I'm going to lay my hands on him and I'm going to pray because he says it's the prayer of faith it is faith that brings that man back faith in the word of God that these hands can heal not my ability that he can do it through these hands these unclean hands and he goes to that young man and he goes lays his hands upon him and he prays for him and that evening he's back in the service do you want to see that do you think it's impossible it's not see why is it impossible have we have we connected to this realm too much that's that's what we're doing that is our commission so let's go on that's just my Foundation is that the blind man yes there's some Blind Men here in Matthew 9 they're blind so for me it means they cannot see correct but just before Jesus gets to these Blind Men and walk past them there's two events that happened first one is there was he that took place of the woman that touched the Hem of His Garment for 12 years she struggled how many of you Believers are plus 12 years struggling with something right now 12 years this woman was an Agony she wasn't feeling good she had a blood issue it was something that was embarrassing it was something that she really wanted to get doubt with and many a time she prayed and she believed but she she just needed a moment where Jesus was passing her way isn't that tonight who makes it for a Sunday service who makes it for a service at Camp what are we here for to see the supernatural or did you come to just sit in church and go I've been here I want to see the supernatural I want to see Jesus Christ step for out of the word because that's the commission he gave us and he said we're two or more Gather in my name have we gathered in his name is he here so don't don't think about this realm think about God is here he down went because we gathered in his name and he stepped out of Eternity and he came back into time and he's sitting right here and he's listening and he's been ministering you all week he's been talking to you all week he says do you want your healing I am here just take me at my word and these Blind Men hear about the case of the woman that's healed because there's always a a a commotion when Jesus are there and healing takes place people rejoice it's a wonderful thing have you ever been delivered from a from any illness sickness remember your song make this trial a blessing have you ever come to a point where God has given you the other side of the mountain when you just see a big wall have you come there what do you do you tell everyone so why not you why not now so you so long we've prayed so long we've claimed so long we've believed why not do know yes sir why do we have to wait for a camp meeting it's the same God so these Blind Men also hear from the daughter one of the leaders in Israel he goes and he raises his daughter from the dead so now there's a big commotion because it says his Fame went across the whole country and these Blind Men hear that Jesus has walked past and we've got it here and he says and when Jesus Department um departed then the two Blind Men followed him they're blind think Logistics they are blind he's walking they are following because there's inside something they need yeah they in need of healing they want their eyes back but I want you to to realize it's two sides that work here not just the one and they shout they cry saying thou son of David have mercy on us they approach their approach to God was Lord have mercy their approach is Lord only you can do it but have mercy so they come with an absolutely soldout approach Lord if you cannot do it they're already in the right atmosphere they are prayed up they came here for a purpose I hope you read between the lines they they came here expecting healing they didn't go there they knew he could do it they just had to approach him right so they go believe is says Thou son of David have mercy and when he was coming to the house the blind man came to him and Jesus said unto him believe ye that I am able to do this here's God's question tonight to you do you believe that he can do it and he says and they say unto him yay Lord so see he waits for them he wants a response from you he can do it he did do it by his stripes he already healed it's done but he's waiting for your response because God is such a gentleman he will never Force healing even upon you it sounds rough but why would he come and go you're now healed and go do this he waits for your response because it's about a relationship my wife wants me to wash the dishes if she asks me I will do it if she doesn't I sidestep that trial okay let's get it right I do not try to get by that Basin ever but I know she wants me to do it but I really really wanted to ask me okay but Jesus Christ wants to have such a personal relationship that he wants you to ask him amen because what he said is if two or more agree in my name and whatever they bind here upon the Earth it's bound it's bound full stop period nothing it's bound and if you with your unwise words loosen something he will loosen in heaven so let let's be careful what we do with our confessions let's be careful what we say to one another because as much as we reap a good harvest what you seow you will reap amen so I didn't give you a p but he you out he says then he touched their eyes saying according to you your faith not I am Jesus creator of heavens and earth oh you have you it's me he said according to your faith so he wants to show us something that it's always about your faith touching his ability because he's done it brother brandham said if Jesus Christ was here he couldn't y you anyway because he's already done it before the foundation of the world it's done so do we settle that by his stripes you were healed amen amen amen but see we need to encourage ourselves in the faith to go he is able to do it amen let me go one step further all these little photos is when I get a thought I put a photo to it because it reminds me where I was when we did it David says bless the Lord oh my soul with all that's within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not his benefits healing is a benefit Deliverance is a benefit you think it's lame to be a Christian I've got benefits overcoming my benefit walking like no other man on this Earth not in sin not in iniquity not in false teachings not after some rock star or whatever walking a straight good road amen with a testimony of Jesus Christ that is why I have I'm that's my benefit cuz sometimes to sacrifice something you think you're losing out let me tell me young man you are not losing out those guys will give everything they own if they ever find out they have cancer they will give everything they own to meet God but because they don't know who he is they can't meet him he gives them chance after chance and they they fight their way to hell but you go to the richest man upon the Earth right now and you say you got 10 hours to live I tell you he'll take every scent he owns and he throws it in there to try and give him one more second yeah but his hands is not his life is not in his hands so I don't care if you're Richard Branson or you're the richest man on earth if you drop the big hey you got cancer and it's terminal and it's your last day question at him I'm telling you he his money will not buy his salvation and cannot give him his healing see the nice thing about being a Believer is even if you don't get your healing you know where your Soul's going you're not running around like a headless chicken stressing out you know you're all good but see but you can be as rich and as nice as you are but if that side of it is still not ready if your soul is not saved boy when that question comes your way or that thing comes your way it's a total different game right that's right and some people don't have a chance to go find God you know how many South Africans die on the road every year Split Second gone some of my friends I was 19 years old you little ones 19 years old I get a phone call so off my notes but I think this is for you I get a phone call 12:00 at night Nikki Morrison has just died in a car accident fell asleep on the steering wheel not drunk a very one of my best of best friends I ever had he was my budy through thick and thin 19 years old didn't know the Lord what's the first thing I think of I wasn't even saved back then I didn't even know the Lord I thought man I hope I'm ready because then stuff gets real it's nice living in a in a believer's atmosphere it's when it gets real when it gets real where are we when when they tell you you're sick where are you you do you really have faith then to believe are we just fighting that same old devil every year see but what happened with these Blind Men they realized there was a way out and Jesus didn't make it easy he asked them a simple question do you believe and now we think God is in a realm somewhere there in the eons and when we pray we have to break through this ceiling to go to another Cloud to go through to reach God no listen to this who have given forgiven all iniquities who give all Health all thy diseases which redeemeth thy life from destruction and to Crown thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth will be renewed Like an Eagle he's a present God he wants to restore he's not a punishing God he's he he he sometimes puts a trial in you to wake you up a little bit but he's not a punishing God he wants to give you David saw the better side of God the the not the Judgment God because he did something with basba he saw the side of God that goes no matter what I do even when I was born in this Psalm go read it you still had me in your mind before my members were formed before my arms even appeared you already knew I was coming so God knows there's no surprise where you are at now every everything you watch on YouTube Twitter and whatever other channel is do you think you watch alone in your room yeah do you surprise he's there he might not want to stay there because remember we can also offend him but he's there amen and no matter what you go through and no matter how much you have failed he says there he's there to forgive all thine iniquities so if you got it wrong what do we do we turn our face back to Jesus Lord I I need you a bit here I'm in a tough spot cuz remember healing healing is not just cancer healing is not just a common cold healing is not fighting with kidney stuff that's not just healing the soul is so much more important yeah he might put the biggest trial on you but if your soul is not there what's the point of being healed you'll get sick again but when your soul is saved nothing else then matters but his word and if he heals you go amen and if he doesn't heal you go amen but does that hinder your belief no he can do it sister margi he can do it it's not it's not about your how much Faith you have it's just take him at his word he can do it I've seen him done wonderful things I was a Liam stain was sick man if I didn't see it with my own eyes I can tell you now I'm a witness he can do it don't let nothing hinder the faith don't let let nothing come between your lord and your you and your savior your lord Jesus Christ don't let it come between it's a lying vanity it's nonsense you don't have to work yourself into emotion to come to the front and burst all out if you want to do it but I'm telling you now brother brandom never approached people there he says the same God that's here is the same God that's there and what touched us she touched the him of His Garment and who touched you I'm standing on the platform it wasn't the prophet of God healing it was the faith of the people people he just preached the word they raised up the faith and they saw but this is a different realm may your faith be raised tonight we come for a prayer meeting not just for us but for everyone I don't believe that any sick person should leave here tonight with my whole heart I wish I could tell you that Jesus Christ heals amen don't work yourself up just take him at his word don't let no lying devil come between you and the Lord never and healing is not just physical it is spiritual yes sickness of the body brother Brandon picks this up I'll read it I'll just put it there for sometimes my reading is not the best so you can follow me he says now remember this isn't all the days of thy life he is now remember I got a little sermon I preach he's God in the H Housetop he's God in the sell he's God in the prison he's God in the hospital he's God in church he's God in the Pew he's God everywhere I said the is God in you but he's God that's right he says he's God he's just as much God there as what he is here he's God in heaven he's God everywhere he's omnipresent do you believe that that's what he's asking them it's the same Jesus th steps forth he's busy with a sermon and the same Jesus stop it's the blind man all over again and he goes do you believe it it's not something you have to work in he's asking a simple question to the crowd do you believe it they got a choice now they can accept his word or they can deny it if they deny it they cannot get their healing no matter how much the prophet of God is praying now over that Pulpit they will not receive the healing that's why he says can thou believe it he goes on he says I missed a few hands here oh no he says now there's a oh here we go now there was a little woman in the Bible that couldn't have a prayer card or get in a prayer line but she touched the border of His Garment you remember that he says that's all prayer um never that's all the prayer card she ever needed if she had a prayer card without that kind of Faith she would have not got healed but she had faith without the prayer card don't major on the minors don't major on the minors it's your faith it is absolutely the faith you put in the word of Christ will bring the result it's the key to unlock everything he says and that's all that's necessary there you have it have the faith without a prayer card you can be healed do you believe that he ask it again he's in the prayer line and he's getting the people to start thinking this is more than just a normal thing I'm asking you can you believe and they say yay Lord he says just to let you know God is still God and he answers prayer out there so nowhere and I this critics that so against this message saying brother Brandon made himself a Healer and blah blah blah where does he step in here tell me where does he come and say I'm this great prophet touch the him of my garment wherever has brother brandham and I challenge every believer out there that don't believe this message when did he say I'm a Healer cuz there's all this nonsense going around to put confusion God was there he says can yall believe it's the same as the Blind Men but Jesus said let the blind lead the blind they both will fall in the ditch may you get I myself tonight may you grab that Hem of His Garment may you say yay Lord he said because what he do is he took his hands and he laid it upon their eyes and he says according to thy faith you are healed and they were healed it takes a little bit more for us that's why said a Believer has a backbone when the doctor says is not going to happen the believer goes say who he tried all he can I believe in doctors don't get me wrong my mom was in Hospital doctors gave all their reports I'm saying he's more than able to take her out of that hospital more than able why should I take the the advice of a doctor if I know my God is greater and if my God wants my mom to be sick she'll be sick and if he wants to heal her he heal it it's not about what God wants it's about I believe cuz I'm a believer that he will heal her how long it ever takes not my problem God's problem he steps on scene and he goes now you heal God takes over when I get to the end of the road when I get to the end of my ability that's when God steps in we could get to the end of our ability a bit sooner Believers we can get about this believe just get to the end of your own ability you cannot heal yourself God's the only one he goes on here and he says here's something I want to really anchor in tonight and and I'll maybe skip through a bit more now he's not just talking in this service about healing he's going to go a little bit deeper about this this is now busy with the pre he says I missed the hands over there everybody there put you um that put up hands that has in the prayer card all around he says oh I guess it's just everybody so now everybody's believing they put their hands up they react they deny gravity and they go it's for me sometimes when you feel in church I want to just drop something in and something says lift up your hands and it's inan that's that feeling don't deny it yeah because to deny it is to to just say I'm going to be stuck in this world you want to take a Rapture one day lift up your hands cuz if you cannot lift up your hands how are you supposed to lift this body up abely cuz what Satan wants you to do is no don't because the Reuben's watching or or you will be uncool Mo if you do this course they might look at you funny forget them cut them out if it's for you lift up your hands if the Lord places it on your heart just do it deny what the devil wants to do he wants you not to do it but this is an expression why is this so hard to do okay everybody hands down hands down okay on three let's lift our hands upu okay how hard was that to do let's go again I think some of you struggling okay and lift your hands up okay so that's the second time you've done it in church praise the Lord let's go again third time Perfection let's raise our hands up okay so on the third time how hard was it to do you all Justified gravity Satan goes don't don't don't don't don't oh they did it n surely they won't do the second don't don't don't oh they did it again and here on the third time he goes okay I give up because now you have overcoming power cuz your whole arm arms got like lead cuz you're thinking I hope the boys are not watching me OHS are like lead I got these ones or and then you go second time oh everybody lift their hands oh maybe I'll go higher and then the third time you're like hey here I am because it's actually not that hard so why if this is not so hard do you so struggle in church what's hindering you what's pushing you back it's a simple question if if you just did this what's so hard to do it in church it's a hindering spirit that doesn't want you to overcome it's the same thing as do you believe you go amen oh wow we have some Believers here the preacher is preaching he's blue in the face and he goes and and do you believe and everybody's like like come on man amen I believe I was made a Believer I've got this thing called backbone Jesus said I'm saved I'm saved he says I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm a Believer we're not unbelievers here I'm telling you unbelievers can run behind their favorite football team and go yeah come and church what is that they have Liberty out there but it one comes to the things of Miracles happening in their midst they don't believe I'm done on that one he says this is a sick world isn't it but you know what is the sickest body on earth now I want you to realize this is the prophet speaking he says I say this in reverence and I say this too because when I read that it was so impactful he says not to be Sac religious God forgive me if I say this wrong the body of Christ needs healing it can only be healed by brotherly love the sick people is not the ones out in the street and in the stadiums let's wake wake up sh the sick ones is here but we deal harsher with the ones here then we deal with the ones out there he says that sick body I know of it's broken into pieces and tore up tore up this is our Prophet speaking I want you to realize this impacted me when I read it yeah he says here come on just I pray for the healing of that body and you're the members of that body so God heal you physically and spiritually it's no point you can do 150 push-ups on the Trot and the brother next to you is dying spiritually there's no problem if you can give the fastest knockout in time the guy next to you is breathing for air the same faith that heals you that healed me can heal the one next to you so when we get to these prayer meetings the same Faith you had that saved you that brought salvation upon yourself could do the one right next to you if you get in the right atmosphere it could save the one right next to you but sometimes we so caught up in our little world our Twitter world and our out there world and our friendship group and our clicks and everything that we forget there's one dying right next to us but we want healing and Jesus said before you cast the moat out of your brother's eye let's work with that beam in yours once you've taken the beam out of yours he didn't say don't go help your brother he says once you taken this beam out go to your brother and help him never said just leave it oh the beam's out yeah okay you go bro he said then you go and you help him isn't that why we're here huh so let us not get in this state let us not get in the state where shakina is broken to pieces and we forgot that the healing is from the body and the Soul have we listened to the last sermons coming over this Pulpit have we God is speaking to us amen now David he got this David Goes Lord and this is just me I want to say this to to to light them a little bit up okay hear me out cuz I'm not fighting with you I want you to realize that everything we do actually means something every action every reaction every prayer set on our knees every sorry every everything we do has healing or it has pain it's just how it is carnally spiritually everything okay he says whether shall I go for thy spirit so even if I try to flee from your spirit where shall I flee from thy presence if I incend into heaven thou are there if I make my bed in hell behold thou are there if I take my wings for the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even if I even thy hand shall lead me and thy right hand shall hold me so even if you think you're the most ungodly person upon this earth and the most unsavable person he's still holding you he's still with you he's still brooding over you because it's not about your performance it's about his ability to keep you Hallelujah if it was any sense about our performance we would all be lost or our filthy our righteousness about filthy rags it's not about you keeping it's about him keeping you so what I want to say tonight is we've got a prayer meeting here we're here for one reason to pray not to be preached at not to be fought with but to enter in and say Lord who do I pray do we get like this of prayer meetings what is the next devil needs to come off where are we going who needs prayer who needs healing the body is shattered we need to get we need to get there no matter where we go you are going to be there I said well I want to go on with this he says surely even if the darkness shall Darkness shall cover me the darkness shall be my light he says even if I can't see right in front of my hands there will be light he says for thou H has possessed my Reigns thou has has covered me in my mother's womb I praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelously are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not heat from thee listen to this how personal David Gets he gets right into the grain of it he says when I was made in secret when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfected and in thy book of all my members were written with in continuance think about it when my members were written in your book when I was still Contin when I was formed in the womb when my arm wasn't even there when my eyes wasn't even there that's why I'm so against abortion he's already knowing you're going to be there that's why I hate taking a lot of an innocent baby this is in the womb and he says here listen to what he says with incontinence were fashioned so he's still being made into the image of what God wants him to you are now being made into the image that God wants you to be he he is so mindful of you little ones am don't think you're too small for church Gabriella all you little ones you you you want to think Jesus doesn't you know who's Jesus where is he's with you amen he is with you closer than you would watch your angels talk to him daily and some of you have a lot of them Bucky needs a couple more that man's busy but you boys you know girls usually they have maybe two or three Angels around them you you you you know they they like all like bodyguards big boys they look like Ed and and and kin they proper you know they got it but boys you got like a 100 around you boys they're covering every dot because wherever you go and you don't know where they go they don't know where you're going but they're going to cover you so you're covered Jesus said his angels behold is there in front of the Lord's face they look after you daily you don't just walk to this earth and be safe every day haphazardly oh no God watches over you you might not feel it you might not see it but God has when you were formed and you were a little bit of baby and you didn't have a brain yet he already knew you were coming amen and then already he put his angels in charge of you and your mother and your father some of the dad so I'm about to close just hang in there he says now we get to this point where we need to touch the him of His Garment now I want to tell you I shouldn't have showed you that slide don't read go that way don't read this is our commission he says oh that's Mary's one so good I changed the slide how many knows how many how many I want to ask one of the children how many people and the least I'm going to pick on you tonight how many people touch the H of Jesus's garment one okay so who says one who says two five 10 okay here's fun fact this is Jimmy s Jimmy I got this from you so Jesus goes to the boat and he calls Peter over the boat and Peter walks to Jesus and he he sees the way Wes and he's about to go down and Jesus grabs him and he saves him and they get back in the boat and the storm Cals and they go to the other side and they go to this place called Gareth and the leaders and the people it says here he says and when they've gone over they came to the land of Gareth and when the men of that place had knowledge of him do you have knowledge of him Ben is just the in charge of baby don't worry about it he says and when they gone over they came into Gareth and when the men had place of knowledge of them they sent unto all that country around them and brought them unto him that were diseased and besought him that they might only Touch the Hem of His Garment and as many as touched were made perfectly hold so do you want to touch the him of His Garment because see me as a brother I'm looking all over the show and I'm thinking our children needs healing I thinking our brothers sisters need healing I think I need healing I I think I need strengthening I think as a togetherness why can't we get Jesus to pass one more time and we encourage each other to Touch the Hem of His Garment because remember each one of those men that was made perfectly whole it was still his faith and God yeah it wasn't the leaders he still had to have faith to know that when he touched that garment he would be healed why don't Jesus come tonight and we encourage each other to Touch the Hem of His Garment and we forget about all the Shenanigans this little upsetting and this this this body that's being broken instead of that getting a body that's being healed isn't that's why we here wouldn't be the nicest thing brother Colin if I phone you and I go brother colen I've got a couple of things going on just pray for me how would you feel about that you'll be like man now I'm serving now we going and then next day Josh phones you and he goes hey brother calling how about you can can can I pray for you he's like bro I actually have unspoken request let's go why don't we get a a little bit more serious about touching Jesus and see what happens cuz there's much healing needed this is a very bad age but there's a lot of healing here so Jesus says there in Mark 16 who knows Mark 16 he says after he appeared to the 11 they sat and had meat he upgraded them with their unbelief I'll finish with this where is that one there we go he upgraded them with their unbelief he said to them you want margi to be healed I'm being very serious now you want sister marget to be healed how many of us is praying for that you want brother Ben to preach thus sayith the Lord every Sunday how many of us is praying for it are we really in the spirit are we really here about the Lord's business or did we get distracted because I want to see sister Margie heal I believe for her and I know you want it too I believe it could happen don't put a full stop behind it don't let doubt come in now if you have a unspoken request you take it before the Lord tonight you will receive your healing just don't let Satan take you off the word because remember our Lord Jesus Christ sent this commission he says they that believe shall hand lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover full stop done not maybe they shall this is not a haphazard this is a thus sayith the Lord they shall recover Can You Touch the Hem of His Garment do you believe so I ask you what Jesus asked to those Blind Men I'm I'm not excited I'm sincere do you believe so let's touch the hym of Jesus's garment can I have the musicians come for for the marching orders is pray lay hands on prayer of faith shall heal the sick the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much let's Touch the Hem of His Garment tonight let's stop this Shenanigans let's stop this playing I'm done playing this is not a game boys we don't we get so distracted this is thus saith the Lord for our time he says do you believe are you believers Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover not maybe not I hope so Jesus Christ is here can you play only believe please brother let's bow our heads I'm very very serious tonight with you I'm done playing with this devil this devil of unbelief and keeping people busy if you believe that Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior the one that the song said that they don't believe they think he's a story if you believe Jesus Christ can heal I want you to raise your hands I didn't say heal you do you believe he can heal so if you believe you can heal he will take your unclean hands and fulfill his word for your hour through your hands do you believe it can I get an amen amen do you believe it so let's pray if you have anything that you want to pray for you ask the Lord that it is healing for your time right now let's take it before the Lord close your eyes and we pray our wonderful Lord Jesus Christ based on your word and our confession Lord we are like those blind people that comes tonight Lord and we want to come before you
