[33:51] six down to verse seven and then we're
[33:58] going to go to we're going to go to
[34:00] verse 25 and 26 so John 4 and verse 6
[34:06] and and
[34:07] even now Jacob's Well was there it's a
[34:09] place Jesus therefore being wearied with
[34:12] his journey set us on the well and it
[34:15] being about the sixth hour then cometh a
[34:17] woman of Samaria to draw water jesus
[34:20] saith unto her give me the drink and
[34:24] then now and then and then they have a
[34:27] discourse we understand and then the
[34:29] woman said in verse 25 I'm just going to
[34:31] jump down to this and then the woman
[34:32] said unto him I know that Messiah cometh
[34:35] which is called Christ when he has come
[34:38] he will tell us all things jesus saith
[34:42] unto her I bet speak under the Emmy amen
[34:47] let's just actually keep reading a few
[34:49] more verses down and upon this came his
[34:51] disciples and marvelled that he talked
[34:53] with the woman yet no man said what
[34:55] seeketh thou or why talk--i though with
[34:57] her the woman then lifted her left her
[34:59] waterpot and went her way into the city
[35:01] and says to the men come see a man which
[35:04] told me all things that I ever did is
[35:06] this not the Christ hallelujah let's go
[35:09] to Ephesians chapter 1 and then we're
[35:13] going to sorry I hope there won't do
[35:17] that too much now let's go let's go from
[35:20] verse 3 says blessed be the God and
[35:24] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[35:27] blessed us you should say me who has
[35:30] blessed me with all spiritual blessings
[35:32] in heavenly places in Christ according
[35:34] he has chosen say me in him before the
[35:38] foundation of the world that I should be
[35:41] holy and without blame before him and
[35:42] love having predestinated me until the
[35:46] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[35:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[35:49] of his will to the praise of his glory
[35:52] of His grace wherein he F made me
[35:54] accepted in the beloved and whom I have
[35:57] redemption through his blood the
[35:58] forgiveness of sins according to the
[36:00] riches of His grace we're in here the
[36:02] bounded towards me and all wisdom and
[36:04] prudence having made known unto me the
[36:07] mystery of his will according to his
[36:09] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[36:11] himself then that that is a dispensation
[36:13] of the fullness of times he might gather
[36:15] together in one all things in Christ
[36:17] both which are in heaven and which are
[36:20] on earth
[36:20] even at him and whom also I have
[36:22] obtained an inheritance having
[36:24] predestinated according to the purpose
[36:26] of him who worketh all things after the
[36:30] counsel of his own world that I should
[36:32] be to the praise of his glory who first
[36:34] trusted in Christ and whom I also
[36:36] trusted after I heard the word of truth
[36:39] the gospel of my salvation and whom also
[36:41] after I believed I was sealed with the
[36:44] Holy Spirit of promise which is the
[36:46] earnest of my inheritance until the
[36:48] redemption of the purchased possession
[36:49] and to the praise of his glory amen god
[36:53] bless you friends you may have your
[36:54] seats you say well can you really change
[36:57] the scripture like that yes because
[36:59] you've got to make it personal I mean
[37:01] you can't just say us and throw it on
[37:03] someone else you've got to claim it I
[37:04] mean you've got to recognize the word is
[37:07] for you a minute you know don't worry
[37:09] about the person next to you at must the
[37:11] word is personally for you Alleluia so I
[37:14] want to talk a bit and I somehow I want
[37:16] to try and convey it that now it is it
[37:23] is an incredible thing when you think
[37:25] about it where God has predestinated a
[37:29] people to take a rapture right so God
[37:32] before there was a beginning before
[37:34] there was anything there before there
[37:36] was a universe before there was an angel
[37:38] there was just Almighty God and he had
[37:41] it his thoughts and his attributes and
[37:43] he thought of a people a meant that
[37:46] would one day be made into his image and
[37:49] not just made into his image but they
[37:51] would be they would take their fallen
[37:54] bodies would be changed a means they
[37:57] were just more than just had the
[37:58] character of Christ but then they would
[38:00] receive the full inheritance so the full
[38:03] benefit of Calvary they would receive
[38:06] amen and they would receive it and enjoy
[38:08] it and be changed by it I mean they
[38:11] would possess the fullness of what he
[38:13] paid paid for so now we just happen to
[38:18] find ourselves in that number right I
[38:21] trust I trust you can say I just happen
[38:23] to fall into that category of person
[38:26] hallelujah now we see the woman at the
[38:29] well her life was very much broken until
[38:33] Jesus came
[38:34] now we see that at your we didn't read
[38:36] it to save time but go away and read
[38:38] John chapter four and we we know the
[38:41] story very well how she had five
[38:42] husbands you know she went to the well
[38:45] at a time where the other woman did not
[38:47] go because she was not an accepted part
[38:51] of her village she was an outcast in her
[38:54] and her you know society she was not
[38:56] welcomed with the other woman so she had
[38:58] to go to us at a at a specific time
[39:01] where no one else went for water and so
[39:04] she found herself in this place in this
[39:06] condition Amen but there was something
[39:09] in her that what she was taught maybe at
[39:13] an earlier age that one day the Messiah
[39:15] would come and one day the Messiah would
[39:18] deliver his people and one day the
[39:20] Messiah would make an atonement he would
[39:23] shed his blood upon the earth he would
[39:25] make an atonement for his people
[39:27] hallelujah see she was she was taught
[39:30] the Messiah was going to come God
[39:32] himself would become flesh hallelujah
[39:35] that Almighty God would put on a body
[39:37] and it would be bought into the human
[39:40] race I mean that in his very veins was
[39:42] the purchase of the whole world I mean
[39:45] was the money whatever you want to call
[39:46] it but he had it in the bank account
[39:48] hallelujah and so he was going to pay it
[39:51] in full I mean so here he was I'll just
[39:56] drink this and here he was hallelujah
[40:03] now brother Branham if you go and you
[40:05] read you read about what he says about
[40:08] the woman at the well he would say that
[40:11] her parents caused her to go out onto
[40:12] the street and have this broken kind of
[40:14] life that her upbringing did it that she
[40:16] got sick of the fussing in the churches
[40:18] and she got tired of all the debates and
[40:21] all these different things so she kind
[40:22] of left that kind of a place but buried
[40:25] down with owner was a longing I want to
[40:28] see the Messiah I mean because we know
[40:31] the scribes and Pharisees when they saw
[40:33] Jesus deserting their hearts they didn't
[40:35] say we know when Messiah comes he'll
[40:37] tell us all things none of them said
[40:39] that but the woman at the welder
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:42] there was someone upon the earth looking
[40:44] Amen I trust you
[40:47] than you was looking hallelujah if when
[40:50] God would come and find you
[40:51] we know when Jesus comes he'll tell us
[40:54] all things amen he sent us Elijah to
[40:57] tell us all things
[40:59] hallelujah it's amazing because you
[41:01] think it wasn't brother
[41:02] yo this message is not brother branham's
[41:04] learning I mean he did not go to a Bible
[41:07] School to understand the mysteries of
[41:08] God he didn't get a theology degree like
[41:11] the world would want him to get amen but
[41:13] when he would preach sermons like crisis
[41:16] of mystery of God and yo you know
[41:18] revealed he had a concordance and his
[41:20] Bible and then he stands to the pulpit
[41:23] says I'm going to tell you what was in
[41:24] the back parts of God's mind before the
[41:26] foundation of the world hallelujah and
[41:28] the whole word from Genesis to
[41:30] Revelation has opened up a mean no man
[41:33] spake like this man because it wasn't
[41:35] man's intellect hallelujah I'm glad
[41:39] because it was every was man's intellect
[41:42] to be like the scribes and Pharisees
[41:43] away was such a fellow will have not
[41:46] this man rule over us Amen so now the
[41:50] woman at the well before Jesus came she
[41:54] thought this was her this is her pardon
[41:57] life I'm going to be an outcast you know
[41:59] the people are never going to accept me
[42:01] because I love to hold my past against
[42:03] me and she was but she was looking for
[42:06] love she was looking for a satisfaction
[42:08] but she could not find it in her first
[42:11] marriage or her second marriage or her
[42:14] third marriage or her fourth marriage or
[42:16] her fifth and then maybe she thought
[42:19] what's the point of getting married I'll
[42:20] just live with someone but then she
[42:22] found not the satisfaction there either
[42:24] but then finally her real husband came I
[42:28] mean God made flesh came to the world
[42:30] because he said I need to go by the way
[42:32] of Samaria so now she was going to find
[42:35] her life was very different hallelujah I
[42:38] know it's called that side but let's
[42:39] just enjoy church I mean let's just
[42:42] enjoy the Lord I mentioned now here she
[42:44] was endless endless predicament but now
[42:47] she was really meeting the one that
[42:49] could really satisfy her every need
[42:52] hallelujah and she found herself and a
[42:55] group that she would never have the
[42:58] world would never put her into that
[42:59] bracket of the bride of Jesus Christ
[43:02] where here was the one here was one of
[43:04] those that God Himself was looking for
[43:07] hallelujah brother Branham would tell
[43:09] the story of thee of an eagle debt that
[43:11] that lays two eggs no Eagle always
[43:13] normally lays 2x and the older one kills
[43:16] the younger one that's called Canaan ISM
[43:18] Cain kills Abel every time but it would
[43:21] tell a story where a farmer would find
[43:23] the two eggs and maybe I think take one
[43:25] you know and put it under a chicken you
[43:28] know a chicken and a chicken farm and
[43:30] then so now this is like us
[43:33] I mean God has so many pills Hren he
[43:36] knows where they are we were born into
[43:40] this world we did not understand who we
[43:43] really are you can say well I'm from
[43:45] this country this is my native language
[43:48] these are my parents
[43:49] this is my grandparents this is my town
[43:51] but that's not really who you are I mean
[43:55] that is really not because to know who
[43:57] you are because there's always that
[43:58] question where where every person has to
[44:01] come to it before there's a rapture
[44:04] there's a gate there's a door called
[44:06] death amen where people step from this
[44:10] world to the next world and so now
[44:12] there's the question begins to come
[44:13] where am i really from Who am I really
[44:16] Who am I I don't know I'm going to go
[44:18] through I've never been through this
[44:19] place before there's only one what
[44:22] there's only one chance to go through I
[44:24] mean unless you're like Lazarus and get
[44:26] resurrected but he wasn't believing when
[44:28] he died so it's fine for him amen you
[44:31] follow me so now there's that question
[44:33] out where am I
[44:34] where am I going I don't know where I'm
[44:36] going people don't know where they're
[44:37] going they try some religion but there's
[44:40] got to be a reality you got to know the
[44:42] person who's going to grab your hand
[44:44] I'll Lou you know I was thinking of um
[44:46] brother Bosworth's testimony and he's
[44:49] been few others brother Bosworth was
[44:51] brother Browns campaign manager one of
[44:53] them and he was on his deathbed brother
[44:56] Brown goes to them and says well you
[44:59] know that your the conversation gone to
[45:01] wind your greatest time you know of your
[45:03] life he's 80 odd years old he says
[45:06] amen because the one that I've loved all
[45:08] these years the suit and pretty soon is
[45:10] going to walk through the door and I'm
[45:12] going to go home to be with him
[45:14] hallelujah Amen so he was knowing we're
[45:17] hitting you where he was going
[45:18] I mean so that's why though we like that
[45:21] that Eagle a meant that we are we are
[45:24] you know born in a in a world but we
[45:26] don't fit in this world amen and that
[45:29] and that Eagle was hatched under the
[45:31] chicken tried to eat the same food as
[45:33] the chicken you're the hinged it and it
[45:35] gave it enough to survive and grow but
[45:38] didn't satisfy it and then maybe it
[45:40] would have gone from one Hut
[45:41] I'll try thee I'll try the popular
[45:43] people hutch and he walk over to the one
[45:45] and try and put it with the cool kids
[45:46] then I didn't fit in there I'll go try
[45:48] the sporty guys cuz that's cool there
[45:51] may be the Nerds I've try and join it
[45:52] over there but doesn't quite work
[45:54] hallelujah he didn't know he is an eagle
[45:57] and brother bran says about spiritual
[45:59] amnesia your amnesia is where people
[46:02] forget they forget their memories they
[46:04] forget who their parents are where
[46:06] they're from and he says people receive
[46:09] get spiritual amnesia and brother BAM
[46:11] says about a about a boy who was in the
[46:14] war and he was going to be taken to an
[46:16] insane institution because they couldn't
[46:17] cure his amnesia and he's being taken on
[46:20] a train and they let them off for a bit
[46:22] of a rest and he gets off the train and
[46:23] then he begins to look and he sees like
[46:26] a water tower and he begins to walk
[46:28] towards the water tower he begins to
[46:30] walk down this path and follow up and
[46:31] the guards the guards were going to grab
[46:34] him but one of the guys he delicious
[46:35] follow him see where it goes he begins
[46:37] to walk and he looks at this path and he
[46:39] looks around he sees this tree he walks
[46:41] over here to this house and then this
[46:43] house and he walks up a path to her to a
[46:46] house there's the old man standing there
[46:48] on the front porch and then he runs down
[46:51] and brace him son on you you'd come home
[46:53] hallelujah and when he when his father
[46:55] embraced him his eyes came open as
[46:57] amnesia was broken hallelujah where is
[47:00] from he knew who his dad was that's just
[47:02] a natural example I mean but God puts
[47:05] puts things in the Bible that seem very
[47:07] familiar amen this familiar places in
[47:11] the word where we begin to read and we
[47:13] can identify ourselves I mean like we
[47:16] can identify ourselves with the woman
[47:18] well maybe not because we had the same
[47:20] lifestyle but because when the Son of
[47:23] Man came he had need to come and find
[47:26] you because you had to be you weren't
[47:28] part of this number on the earth I mean
[47:30] but there's a heavenly host I mean
[47:32] there's a ransom Body of Christ
[47:34] I Lou you that we're meant to be part of
[47:36] I means he says I need to go by the way
[47:38] of where it was Wellington or South
[47:41] America or South Africa or wherever
[47:44] you're from I need to go by the way of
[47:46] their hallelujah because many times we
[47:49] think of you know like the woman if we
[47:51] could just touch the hem of His garment
[47:52] how the woman at the bloody shoe if I
[47:54] could just touch the hem of His garment
[47:55] I'll be made whole and he's the high
[47:57] priest that we touched by the feeling of
[47:59] our infirmities and we can touch him by
[48:02] our faith we can touch the high priest
[48:04] hallelujah but then you've got to ask
[48:06] the question really because Jesus when
[48:08] when the woman touched His garment he
[48:11] said and virtue strength went out of him
[48:13] he said who touched me but now this
[48:19] should really be the flip side of the
[48:21] question here you are in life and you're
[48:25] you're going down you've got your
[48:26] 10-year plan your five-year plan your
[48:28] whatever year plan maybe I'll do it
[48:30] tomorrow plan and you're going down that
[48:33] way but then something touches you amen
[48:40] where it becomes more than a storybook
[48:44] that becomes more than a church service
[48:47] it becomes more than a tape or a voice
[48:49] that you may be heard all your life but
[48:52] something begins to move on the inside
[48:54] of you hallelujah and then you got to
[48:56] rethink what touched me I mean what
[48:59] changed me I mean like the prodigal son
[49:02] he was down in a foreign land in a in a
[49:05] pig farm feeding the pigs and then he
[49:08] came to himself what touched him what
[49:13] touched him in their state none of his
[49:15] family was there his family didn't come
[49:17] find him but something touched them amen
[49:20] what he he could have really said what
[49:22] touched me what just happened he says I
[49:24] gotta go back to father's house so
[49:27] begins to make his way back to father's
[49:28] house and then he finds himself he says
[49:31] I'm not worthy
[49:32] there's always a question of
[49:33] unworthiness comes in a mint because he
[49:36] because memory is a Jew so there's
[49:39] always the earth is the law and there's
[49:41] different things they don't understand
[49:43] grace like we understand grace and the
[49:46] Old Testament the word grace just means
[49:47] our unmerited favor but then in the New
[49:50] Testament is magnified and it means a
[49:52] divine influence upon the heart amen
[49:56] and it's reflection in your life
[49:58] hallelujah the grace is magnified under
[50:00] the blood of Jesus Christ I mean so when
[50:03] grace falls upon you he's a divine
[50:05] influence like the boy in the Pigpen
[50:07] where he came to himself says I'm going
[50:10] to go back to father's house hallelujah
[50:12] but then when he as I said when he when
[50:14] he's going back to father's house he
[50:15] says I'm not worthy to be called a son
[50:18] I'll just be a servant and this is what
[50:22] we think because people then well I've
[50:23] gone too far I've done too many bad
[50:26] things in life my past is haunting me
[50:29] continuously amen hello and then sir now
[50:33] he thinks I'll just be a servant but his
[50:35] father has been praying maybe because if
[50:38] you read this the story it says and the
[50:40] father saw the son of far-off sierra's
[50:44] he had his binoculars watching because
[50:52] he saw his son walked that way right he
[50:57] knew his son was going to come back the
[50:58] same way so one day because remember we
[51:02] believe in prayer
[51:03] do we not we believe in prayer amen
[51:05] there's times when you pray and you just
[51:07] there's a peace comes you know
[51:08] something's going to happen and no doubt
[51:10] he would have bad with his mum and see I
[51:12] mean I mean I mean it's wife said honey
[51:14] we have two sons one son is not here
[51:17] this is not right Amen I was going to
[51:21] bed up a little bit of drama amen and
[51:23] we've read in the scripture us and our
[51:27] seed will be there it's an Old Testament
[51:29] promise aim it out ow ow God Jehovah who
[51:33] we love and serve the Almighty Adonai El
[51:35] Shaddai i hallelujah Jehovah he promised
[51:39] sign I seen a me and there's a promise
[51:41] in here look honey it says that thy word
[51:45] shall not depart
[51:46] out of my mouth or those seats mouth or
[51:48] those seat seats mouth forever amen but
[51:51] he's gone wayward but this is the
[51:53] promise remember your children are just
[51:56] echo what system it is to put on though
[51:58] what's that remember we don't ask for
[52:00] the type of children we had a meant God
[52:04] didn't send you an email saying now what
[52:06] characteristics do you want them to be
[52:08] how told you want them want sex what
[52:10] color eyes while color here John them to
[52:12] be this way no you didn't ask for how
[52:14] they came but they came amen and God
[52:18] knew they would come out of you is that
[52:20] right God knew they would come out of
[52:22] you remember Levi paid tithes in Abraham
[52:25] it was leaving I was still he was he was
[52:28] in the loins of Abraham Abraham didn't
[52:31] know who he was he's just doing whatever
[52:33] ahem did right but he came out of him
[52:36] eventually because this is great or
[52:38] grandson or whatever it was amen
[52:40] so our children are predestinated Amen
[52:43] God knew that came out of you your
[52:45] father's a meant so so the daddy would
[52:48] have said look remember Adam honey Adam
[52:52] was the son of God and we understand
[52:55] that children are part of us amen
[52:58] they're not Aurelia there are a separate
[53:00] Firstman away we are just an expression
[53:02] of one person Amen saying in the
[53:05] scriptural way he with me so he must
[53:09] come we have promises and the word and
[53:11] they bowed down and took Jehovah God at
[53:13] his work under the blood of bulls and
[53:15] goats and then what happened is a boy in
[53:19] a pig pen they don't know what state
[53:21] even doesn't matter what state people
[53:22] are in amen
[53:25] I had a something I just something
[53:26] struck me a few a few weeks ago lot was
[53:30] Abraham's nephew
[53:32] I've got nieces and nephews amen and
[53:36] don't and don't just limit the nieces
[53:37] and nephews you know we've got family
[53:40] and we stand between the living and the
[53:42] dead amen but I real but I just realized
[53:46] while Abraham got got lot he saved them
[53:49] he saved them twice once in battle the
[53:52] other time he was actually beyond his
[53:54] reach down in Sodom here's beyond his
[53:56] reach amen but here comes God
[53:59] it's going to sit on I'm gonna can I
[54:02] withhold from my friend Abraham what I'm
[54:04] going to do and he's standing there
[54:06] maybe the two angels have already gone
[54:08] down they've already gone down to Sodom
[54:10] they're on their way
[54:12] and here's his Abraham talking with God
[54:14] and Abraham stands in the gap and he and
[54:18] he whittles it down numbers go down down
[54:20] down down and then now see what because
[54:24] he's interceding for his for his nephew
[54:25] that's beyond his reach physically are
[54:29] you following me he's beyond his reach
[54:31] but yet it was Abraham standing in the
[54:33] gap for us for his nephew and for his
[54:37] family amen that caused two angels to go
[54:40] down there amen and drag them out Allu
[54:44] you I've heard the story many times but
[54:47] might become a reality
[54:49] amen so now here so they pray and then a
[54:54] piece came honey he's coming back how do
[54:56] you know I just know because it's not a
[54:58] hope anymore it's I know it's already
[55:00] done that's faith when you know it's
[55:02] already done hallelujah and he begins to
[55:06] look and they sees them come afar off
[55:08] the particles and comes afar off I mean
[55:11] what touched him to come back to
[55:12] father's house normally sons are
[55:14] stubborn they won't come back to dad
[55:16] when they're wrong I'll just say Amen
[55:20] sure isn't it Amen but what but what
[55:24] turns us heart amen God touch them what
[55:29] turned your heart wherever you were you
[55:31] may not even have ever really recognized
[55:35] it even in the beginning or even now
[55:37] amen many of you are from overseas let's
[55:41] go to New Zealand what touched you to
[55:43] make that decision let's move to this
[55:46] place it has to be substantial
[55:51] oh yeah what amen amen hey we moved
[55:58] heating haloo yeah but what caused that
[56:02] to happen what touched you I mean to end
[56:05] up in this place God hallelujah Amen it
[56:10] cost you to go from one place to another
[56:12] place
[56:13] Amen no the woman at the well her life
[56:19] changed that day amen
[56:22] she found herself in a number and she
[56:25] wasn't looking to be in that number but
[56:28] she was part of God's redeemed amen
[56:31] maybe I need to finish the protocol son
[56:32] story because always think about being
[56:34] unworthy the father said no give him the
[56:38] best rope put put the my ring and a
[56:43] father's ring and the in the Bible has
[56:45] his seal on it give him my authority
[56:50] hallelujah when he signs when when he
[56:53] signs an order he gets the wax and he
[56:55] seals it with my with that signet it's
[56:58] as good as me saying it amen give me
[57:01] give him my authority but the choice is
[57:04] rope on him hey hallelujah he was in a
[57:08] better state then that he was in the
[57:09] beginning I think because now he could
[57:12] administer mercy I mean but as older
[57:15] brother state there is a good boy I
[57:17] think it's a beaten understanding you're
[57:19] angry I've been working for you all this
[57:22] time you've never made me a feast amen
[57:26] but the father said your brother my son
[57:30] was dead but now he's alive
[57:33] Alleluia glory not just Amen he was dead
[57:37] but now he's alive amen
[57:40] now we find ourselves part of the
[57:45] predestinated or rather say we find
[57:49] ourselves recognizing we are
[57:50] predestinated now God has written his
[57:55] Bible in such a way that's more than
[57:58] stories amen it's more than history it's
[58:01] more than a code of ethics but God
[58:05] has caused it to be written in such a
[58:07] way that the believer will be able to
[58:10] read or see the heart of God right that
[58:14] it will be more than just information
[58:16] but it but it is a love letter to you
[58:20] amen where because because of
[58:22] relationship or because of family
[58:26] hallelujah
[58:27] you know you see your family I know you
[58:30] know there's some families or some
[58:33] people and families and you think they
[58:35] are either incredibly angry with you or
[58:37] they're very happy and because you can't
[58:40] read them you don't know where are they
[58:41] and where are they going with these kind
[58:43] of how they how they fresh things and
[58:46] you just don't know what's here what's
[58:48] she saying what's he really saying and
[58:50] then a member of the family will say
[58:51] they mean listen this and listen listen
[58:53] this a meant the family can translate to
[58:56] you what the person really means I mean
[58:59] some people can smile at you and really
[59:02] thinking you did you know but some may
[59:05] be smiling kids I love you you're
[59:07] wonderful you need someone to translate
[59:09] I know it's an extreme case being honor
[59:11] me you know how people are that way you
[59:13] follow you can be right so you need
[59:15] someone to really translate to you what
[59:18] that person means but then if just say
[59:20] if you married into that family
[59:22] I meant you'd begin to understand how
[59:25] they are because you know the heart of
[59:28] the person you've married
[59:29] right and it's the same thing with God
[59:31] people read this and they think oh he's
[59:35] you know they think oh he's all judgment
[59:38] what a terrible God but then other
[59:41] people read this he so glorious
[59:44] hallelujah even in the Old Testament
[59:46] there's so much death but as but as you
[59:49] know there's so much you know
[59:50] destruction but there's more life than a
[59:52] destruction I mean they're so so much
[59:55] hardship but God sustains through the
[59:57] hardship I mean there's still mercy even
[1:00:00] in the Old Testament but if you don't
[1:00:03] know the heart of God you must
[1:00:04] understand what he says you're following
[1:00:07] me and so now when we read this now
[1:00:10] because it is a love letter to you you
[1:00:14] begin to understand a few things
[1:00:17] not that you study it but when it
[1:00:20] becomes a love letter to you and that's
[1:00:23] why now they just read this quote
[1:00:28] brother Brown someone asked him about as
[1:00:31] your name about the um I just he's he's
[1:00:40] asked a question about trying to um
[1:00:45] so doesn't brother Brown someone wants
[1:00:47] to know why your name why you're not
[1:00:52] mentioned in the Bible
[1:00:53] speaking about his name and he gives an
[1:00:56] answer and he says and now you see oh
[1:01:01] it's us
[1:01:02] well I imagine this dear person Isis you
[1:01:04] see and someone that loves me or they
[1:01:06] wouldn't write at see now I could not
[1:01:09] say that my name the Bible does not call
[1:01:11] my name william branham or call your
[1:01:13] name whoever it is but we are in him
[1:01:16] anyhow and these and now you see
[1:01:19] familiar places that refer to in the
[1:01:21] bible that say certain things you see
[1:01:24] now if your watch history repeats itself
[1:01:26] in the bible now justly you give me a
[1:01:29] scripture for one i see many of you
[1:01:32] writing it down third chapter st.
[1:01:33] Matthew and when God called his son out
[1:01:36] of Egypt that it might be fulfilled
[1:01:38] I was just spoken out of Egypt I've
[1:01:40] called my son now if you've got a
[1:01:42] Scofield or any reference Bible you'll
[1:01:44] follow that reference there that margin
[1:01:46] reading it will bring you back to where
[1:01:48] he called Jacob Israel out of Egypt see
[1:01:51] but Jacob was his son that he called out
[1:01:54] of Egypt also Jesus was the son that he
[1:01:58] called out of Egypt see the Word of God
[1:01:59] is never-ending see we are identified we
[1:02:04] identify ourselves in the Bible
[1:02:07] I meant when with with many different
[1:02:10] how many remembers my message on
[1:02:12] identifying yourself with Christian
[1:02:15] characters amen
[1:02:18] Phoenix Arizona where I preached it yeah
[1:02:20] many of you has got it on the tapes you
[1:02:22] identify with Christian character see
[1:02:24] you can identify yourself anywhere you
[1:02:27] want to in that scripture if you're a
[1:02:29] Christian
[1:02:30] and if you're not a Christian you can
[1:02:32] identify yourself in the Bible see so I
[1:02:34] think maybe that would help I want to
[1:02:37] get as many of these as I can speak of a
[1:02:38] question so he says he says well you
[1:02:41] know he says that there are familiar
[1:02:44] places in the scripture that identify
[1:02:47] who we are you following and so the
[1:02:51] reason the Prophet preached certain
[1:02:53] sermons took certain Texas because he
[1:02:56] wanted you to see this is you Amen so
[1:03:00] when he preaches about different aspects
[1:03:05] of the scripture you know when he
[1:03:07] preaches about invisible union of the
[1:03:09] bride and Christ you should be able to
[1:03:11] say that's me he's talking about I meant
[1:03:13] about that about that woman that's
[1:03:16] perfect you're sinless why does snow
[1:03:18] without spot or wrinkle bone of his bone
[1:03:21] flesh your flesh life as life she is him
[1:03:23] a mint and then when you read things
[1:03:26] like an ester now these things are all
[1:03:29] done because the spiritual amnesia has
[1:03:31] to be broken amen
[1:03:34] so when you go into parts like when
[1:03:36] you're like the Book of Ruth and brother
[1:03:38] Barry speaks about the Book of Ruth
[1:03:39] about the kinsman redeemer now he
[1:03:42] identifies Jesus being the kinsman
[1:03:44] redeemer but then you have to identify
[1:03:46] yourself in the scripture or rather God
[1:03:49] Himself says you are Ruth Amen you're in
[1:03:52] the field hey Ruth yo the woman at the
[1:03:56] well found herself at that well she just
[1:03:58] happened to be there now it was all
[1:04:00] predestinated but she can say I was
[1:04:02] there at the right place at the right
[1:04:04] time with the right man hallelujah amen
[1:04:07] and here was Ruth now Ruth had no
[1:04:11] control over her life amen she wasn't
[1:04:14] looking when she was a little girl she
[1:04:15] didn't say one day I'm going to go to
[1:04:17] Israel I'm going to marry the mighty man
[1:04:19] of wealth and we're going to fit here
[1:04:21] we're going to found Bethlehem and you
[1:04:23] know she wasn't looking for that she
[1:04:25] didn't plan her life that way she
[1:04:27] thought well I'm all about us I'm going
[1:04:29] to marry one I'm going to stay here you
[1:04:31] know that would have been her her life
[1:04:33] because people didn't travel a whole
[1:04:34] bunch in those days
[1:04:35] so the here she was she found herself
[1:04:37] living in living in Moab now this may be
[1:04:41] you say this is a bit laborious no no
[1:04:43] just hold
[1:04:44] on to your seat because I want it to
[1:04:46] sink in real deep she happened to find
[1:04:49] herself there and there's a famine in
[1:04:50] Israel and it got so bad some Israelites
[1:04:53] had to leave and they had to come in to
[1:04:55] had to come into Moab and she found
[1:04:58] herself looking at what are the boys and
[1:05:00] she found herself liking one of them and
[1:05:02] she found herself marrying him amen and
[1:05:05] then she found herself with a sick
[1:05:07] husband and then she found herself as a
[1:05:11] widow and then she found her her
[1:05:14] sister-in-law also your happened to her
[1:05:17] the same way because there's two sons
[1:05:19] and they found themselves widows and
[1:05:22] then Naomi found herself a widow as well
[1:05:25] well there's a different kind of place
[1:05:27] and then she found herself hearing that
[1:05:32] there was wheat back in Israel and then
[1:05:35] something in her now you could say what
[1:05:37] motivated her what motivates you
[1:05:40] amen she can put a finger on it Nome he
[1:05:44] says one day girls I'm going home I hear
[1:05:47] this week I have nothing in this place
[1:05:50] my sons are dead my husband's dead I'm
[1:05:54] going back to Israel and he comes Ruth
[1:05:57] remember she was like you she was like
[1:05:59] me
[1:06:00] these weren't some mythical people that
[1:06:03] said very profound things all the time
[1:06:04] and everything went good you know they
[1:06:07] were exactly like us and she finds
[1:06:08] herself following her mother-in-law and
[1:06:10] she finds herself cleaving to her you're
[1:06:14] gonna be my god your people will be my
[1:06:17] people where you die I'll die hallelujah
[1:06:20] and then she finds herself in a field
[1:06:23] she finds herself in a field trying to
[1:06:27] glean behind the Reapers trying to find
[1:06:30] grain just to survive there's where she
[1:06:32] finds herself
[1:06:33] it's a place like a woman at the well
[1:06:37] hallelujah but she was in the right
[1:06:40] field
[1:06:41] I mean God Oh dangerous steps into the
[1:06:43] field of boy hallelujah the only one
[1:06:47] that could redeem her a man the only one
[1:06:50] and it was actually in the law no MOBOT
[1:06:53] can enter the Congress of Israel
[1:06:56] hallelujah hallelujah grace overshadows
[1:06:59] the law amen and then so here here she
[1:07:02] finds herself in this field and then she
[1:07:05] finds herself looking at another man
[1:07:07] hallelujah and he's a different kind of
[1:07:10] man
[1:07:10] he's not just a worker he owns the whole
[1:07:13] thing hallelujah and here you find
[1:07:16] yourself the message comes your way I'll
[1:07:18] just come right on hope the message
[1:07:20] comes your way member this the word is a
[1:07:22] field I mean the world is a field and
[1:07:26] you find yourself in this word and it
[1:07:28] becomes more than just well for the bram
[1:07:31] seeds or the Bible says but now the
[1:07:33] author Amen of the word I'm in the
[1:07:36] mighty man of wealth hallelujah he steps
[1:07:39] onto the field I mean against it talk to
[1:07:41] you stay in this world I mean stay in
[1:07:44] the field hallelujah and he drops
[1:07:46] handfuls of purpose for you oh what a
[1:07:49] glorious revelation hallelujah I mean
[1:07:52] how glorious listen I mean I've been
[1:07:55] redeemed hallelujah he doesn't know he
[1:07:58] doesn't leave you like that he doesn't
[1:08:01] leave me just rejoicing in the field I
[1:08:02] mean because when he looks down at you
[1:08:04] he's not looking for someone someone to
[1:08:07] just clean up at the end of the harvest
[1:08:09] hallelujah he's looking for a wife he's

[1:16:01] hallelujah the life is given look here's
[1:16:04] the Sun that's been birthed
[1:16:06] hallelujah and the gospel is going to go
[1:16:08] back to the juice hallelujah that's a
[1:16:13] familiar place amen I trust that story
[1:16:17] it's only four chapters in the Bible but
[1:16:20] is the most to me it's one of the most
[1:16:21] blessed parts of the scripture amen but
[1:16:24] you've got to be able to see yourself
[1:16:25] with it hallelujah now we just go one
[1:16:29] more real quick as time has gone away
[1:16:31] but the same thing happens you look at
[1:16:33] Easter
[1:16:34] hallelujah what now what moved her what
[1:16:38] touched her because when Easter there
[1:16:40] isn't you know is there a Babylon the
[1:16:43] Jews have already gone back to rebuild
[1:16:44] the temple
[1:16:45] so what moved on her Allu you what moved
[1:16:49] on Mordecai
[1:16:50] her cousin that was raising her up to
[1:16:53] stay out of the promised land yeah we
[1:16:56] can't we can't understand what God does
[1:16:58] all the time because that doesn't make
[1:17:01] sense if they're really Jews they would
[1:17:03] have been back in the promised land oh
[1:17:06] no sir cuz she had to go to a throne
[1:17:11] right and she found herself in a very
[1:17:13] different kind of place she found
[1:17:15] herself in the royal family
[1:17:17] hallelujah she found herself married to
[1:17:19] the most powerful King at that time on
[1:17:22] the earth hallelujah
[1:17:25] now I trust that ass of a familiar place
[1:17:28] hello as it a familiar place you when
[1:17:32] you read the book of Esther as
[1:17:34] not just a nice story but God says your
[1:17:37] Easter hallelujah you were here world
[1:17:41] events are going on you don't know
[1:17:43] really what's going on in the world but
[1:17:46] you'll be placed on a throne
[1:17:47] hallelujah upon this earth I mean a
[1:17:50] dominion over Satan and all of his
[1:17:52] devices hallelujah amen as I said now as
[1:17:57] I've said I think I think I said it
[1:17:59] years ago remember Haman is hung his his
[1:18:02] sons are hung there's a you know all
[1:18:04] those things those his Haman was just
[1:18:06] hung and in a signet ring that was Haman
[1:18:10] was the Kings given to Haman is now
[1:18:12] given to Mordecai hallelujah
[1:18:14] and then Mordecai needs to sit down
[1:18:17] because they can write a law they can
[1:18:21] write a law because they cannot cancel
[1:18:23] out what Mordecai I mean what Haman
[1:18:26] wrote to kill all the Jews but they have
[1:18:28] the ability to write a law that can go
[1:18:31] over and beyond hallelujah amen and it
[1:18:36] all comes into being because before this
[1:18:39] ever happened the king could not sleep
[1:18:41] and the book of records was open the
[1:18:44] Kingdom Records was open the book became
[1:18:46] loose hallelujah the records were
[1:18:49] unsealed and then now a scribe we had to
[1:18:52] read before the king everything was done
[1:18:55] you know that was done this hour stirs
[1:18:57] up the King hallelujah and with the
[1:19:00] opening of the book the opening of the
[1:19:02] word hallelujah it changes you Amen
[1:19:07] you're once you're once in a place I
[1:19:09] think the word place is by the wrong
[1:19:12] word but you got to understand this was
[1:19:15] this was urine heritance mean because
[1:19:17] Esther was under the sentence of death
[1:19:19] before the record was open before the
[1:19:23] book was loosed hallelujah and then now
[1:19:27] the the seals come open
[1:19:29] hallelujah prophets placed upon the year
[1:19:32] an inheritance is distributed out
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:36] the last will and testament hallelujah
[1:19:38] is read Amen in any and he begins to say
[1:19:42] and I think the first seal it is our
[1:19:44] church I'm not going to call you church
[1:19:45] anymore I'll call you bride
[1:19:47] hallelujah because he's now designating
[1:19:49] that you're a part of an ela Clady
[1:19:52] hallelujah and then now an inheritance
[1:19:55] is distributed but it's not just but
[1:19:58] then the Holy Spirit Himself is still
[1:20:02] brooding over his word to enforce what
[1:20:05] was spoken becomes reality amen top
[1:20:10] seated before you take it a natural
[1:20:12] sense Andy you get that house at 1 3 8
[1:20:16] we're ever that's your house now
[1:20:17] then the Lord gives them the papers he
[1:20:19] goes and gets the house if there's any
[1:20:21] squatters in the house he can kick them
[1:20:23] out and take position of his inheritance
[1:20:25] that's a natural thing a mint there's a
[1:20:28] law behind what the lawyer has said
[1:20:30] right and that's just natural but now
[1:20:33] there's a supernatural will and
[1:20:35] testament I mean we're a prophet stood
[1:20:37] he spoke it out upon the earth and the
[1:20:40] Holy Ghost is guarding his work because
[1:20:42] there's an electic amen that must
[1:20:44] receive the fullness of redemption
[1:20:46] hallelujah so she doesn't just hear that
[1:20:49] say that's a wonderful thing the Holy
[1:20:50] Ghost comes in behind I'm going to make
[1:20:52] you in here at this place I'm going to
[1:20:54] make you stand holy I'm going to cause
[1:20:57] you to put Satan under your feet I mean
[1:20:59] I'm going to make you more than a
[1:21:00] conqueror through Jesus Christ
[1:21:01] hallelujah I'm gonna mold you into his
[1:21:04] image hallelujah now we find ourselves
[1:21:10] in a different place hey amen
[1:21:17] time has escaped us but now we find
[1:21:20] ourselves in a different place and I'm
[1:21:22] just gonna leave you with this here was
[1:21:25] I'll say this here is Caleb and Joshua
[1:21:29] they are born at the right place well
[1:21:32] humanly they'd say the wrong place cause
[1:21:34] our slaves but they're bored at the
[1:21:36] right place the right time at the right
[1:21:39] season because God and his mind said to
[1:21:42] Kayla go with Caleb II said you're not
[1:21:44] meant to be putting bricks into a
[1:21:46] monument in Egypt you mean to be living
[1:21:48] on a resurrection Mountain in the
[1:21:50] pharmacy yeah I mean cuz that was the
[1:21:54] place that God had for him right so now
[1:21:56] here he is and he sees Moses come after
[1:22:00] 40 years hey you're
[1:22:01] man comes with a stick in his hand his
[1:22:03] wife and young uns on a mule going down
[1:22:05] through border control there in Egypt he
[1:22:07] says I've come to two reason for visit
[1:22:09] business you know whatever other
[1:22:12] invasion gives it to the border guard
[1:22:15] off he goes in why he says I've come to
[1:22:17] take over and he did it he took over the
[1:22:20] place hallelujah because the one who
[1:22:23] takes over dictates what they want to do
[1:22:25] what do you want to do let my people go
[1:22:27] what happened they will let go amen so
[1:22:30] here he comes now
[1:22:32] and then now his just say now we're
[1:22:34] Caleb and Joshua he comes Moses let my
[1:22:37] people go
[1:22:38] and then the plagues begin to fall and
[1:22:40] now we're in Goshen hallelujah the blood
[1:22:44] is on the door and lintel amen we're
[1:22:47] eating the Passover lamb death angel
[1:22:49] comes and strikes the strikes the place
[1:22:51] there's never been a cry like that cry
[1:22:53] but there's never been a rejoicing like
[1:22:55] this rejoicing oh yeah
[1:22:58] in Pharisees now you must go but up yo
[1:23:01] because otherwise we'll probably all die
[1:23:02] then we're marching out how they going
[1:23:05] to another place here we are
[1:23:07] prophets coming the same time I'll bring
[1:23:09] it to because we're in the third Exodus
[1:23:11] amen a blood word is spoken amen the
[1:23:16] power of Calvary has been released
[1:23:17] fullness of the Holy Ghost is a pot in
[1:23:19] the year plagues have already begun to
[1:23:21] fall the pre tribulation judgments
[1:23:23] already begin to fall now they found
[1:23:26] themselves there in Egypt 40 odd years
[1:23:28] later he was on his Mountain he found
[1:23:30] himself in a different place but because
[1:23:32] he was under the blood and lamb there
[1:23:33] and he believed what the act what God
[1:23:36] spoke through Moses he received his
[1:23:38] inheritance now here we are we've come
[1:23:40] out of the world a member we're not
[1:23:42] moving to another part of the earth
[1:23:44] we're going up
[1:23:45] amen we're going up Amen so I found a
