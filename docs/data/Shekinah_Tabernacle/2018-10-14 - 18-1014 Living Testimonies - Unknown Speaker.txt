before I sing a song amen has anyone ever been to a theme park or an amusement park or anything and then I'm the kind of guy who when he's on the chair usually grips onto the bar to hold on for dear life because the fear leaves me unbelievably stiff and frigid and whatever and you get other people who just throw their arms up in the air and scream and shout and yell and express whatever the strange part of that is that me who has my hands to the bar I feel those dips and those plunges and those insane madness and roller coasters are way more than those who have their hands screaming out loud and letting all of that out and it just feels like that in this season that God has intentionally put maybe you may relate additionally put me in a rollercoaster right whether it's dips and his rises and there's dips so that I can take my hands off the bar for once I can take my hands off the bar and raise them up and say Jesus I need you because you're my strength when I am weak Lord you're the treasure that I seek do you feel that way this morning do you feel that or you or you can ever be all you're ever will ever be is a a person to worship God but you don't have anything else in life to the point worship God you may have your job you may have your children to look after but ultimately our existence in this life is to live like God to be like him so we need him so if you feel that way this morning just raise your hands just close your eyes as we sing this song just let him hear you just let him come into your heart as whether been comes up you are my strength when I am weak you are my treasure that I seek you are my all [Music] you have I [Music] is your name [Music] is your [Music] rising again I bless your name [Music] Oh [Music] when I fall down you pick me up when I am

but everyone here great to have brother Peter back amen god bless you trust you feel welcome sister cheese oh god bless you great to have you here as well have you back I mean it's you know it's amazing it's um brother Peter was here two years ago and I was thinking where as two years gone amen praise the Lord just to feel at home on on this side of the world amen if you got your Bibles handy let's go to the book of Exodus chapter 15 we're gonna read we're just going to read three three verses here then we're gonna go to the book of Acts chapter 4 says here in in Exodus 15 verses 19 to 21 and this is the after the children of Israel across the Red Sea for the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with us Horseman into the sea and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon him but the children of Israel went on dry land and the of the sea and Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the woman went out after her with timbrels and with dancers and Marian answered them singie to the Lord PF triumphant gloriously and the horse and his rider hath been thrown into the sea hallelujah let's go to let's go to X I'll see if this is this is working I mean this got to Acts chapter 4 and verse 23 hallelujah that says and being late goes the apostles they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had done unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord thou art God which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David had said why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the king kings of the earth can you turn I can can you turn this thing down a bit sorry the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth against the Holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth I hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy Holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God with boldness amen may the Lord bless his word this morning you may have your seat so can you I think there's been a yeah yeah I yeah yeah it's better yep amen so I wonder if I could if I could take a title I'd like to speak about being a living testimony oh that that just went the other way that's all good praise the Lord now we read here how's your fun this morning if I'm well Alou yeah now we read here with an ex chapter four we have a group of believers we understand that the book of Acts is not the Acts of the Apostles but it's the Acts of the Holy Ghost and the Apostles it was the and we know that the Bride of Christ is writing another book of Acts so your life is writing another book of x-a my brother Bram said if that via never puts forth another branch it will write another book of Acts so the Bride of Christ around the world is writing another book of Acts now we know that the book of Acts I said it's the acts of the Holy Ghost and the Apostles it's God living in his body it's the it's God living through his bride and already the Antichrist spirit is war warring against the bride notice that that if you know if you read the whole account from Acts for not the whole church was dragged before the Sanhedrin before the elders and the chief priests it was just a few but in those ones they were threatened not to preach and his name anymore they are intimidated but then they gathered back to to have a prayer meeting and they are under expectation that God would come and meet their need I mean that they didn't just gather just for a religious ceremony but they religion they gathered that God would meet them and that should be our expectation for every service it should be God what are you going to do today what are you gonna do it's more we don't gather just to learn something just to hear some intellectual speech or some more kind of an idea but God would come anoint his word for every soul and he would live among us they had an expectation Lord the enemies come against us here we are one Accord one mind one heart and God came down and shook the place and they will fill with the Holy Ghost hallelujah so every part of us now every every one of us has a job to doing the service right each every one of us now brother Brandon tells us that we are a amateur creator that we can create an atmosphere around us right we can create an atmosphere around us and we know that that is more than just saying you know more than just I wasn't it lovely but God you can create an atmosphere around you that God can step down as the atmosphere for not only yourself but for others hallelujah that you can create an atmosphere that God comes in twelves as his word says he he inhabits the praises of his people to where God's people are praising him and worshiping him more than nice singing we know you're more than just saying nice things and saying praise but God comes anoint you creates an atmosphere he inhabits that around you hallelujah and that's what we want we aren't going to inhabit our praise go to inhabit our lives here in heaven the church here dwell among us hallelujah that's what we want because we have to recognize your we're free people I mean we can't let the devil try and put us back in bondage and tell us to shut up and sit down and the bride's not going to shut up the bride's not going to sit down we're going to take our god-given rights we're going to take everything in the land we are not going to formalize and settle down we're going to take everything God has given us and we should not settle for anything less than possessing the whole Word of God hallelujah that's so we should be dead interest I want it all I don't want to put up with the devil on my land and I want squatters I want to drive them off I want him to be trophies on my wall I want to possess all things if he has given us all things to possess I mean we have the title deed everything Adam lost in the guard and the bride is received the mighty angel is descended with an open book that book is in the hands of the Prophet anymore it's in the hands of the bride father in this everything Adam lost has been given into our hands again so we have our god-given right to possess the contents of the book hallelujah we shouldn't settle back for anything less I mean doesn't matter what other people don't live below your privilege we should live according to our privilege hallelujah so we should always have an expectation God what are you going to do today I mean not just in church but every day God what are you going to do in my life what are you gonna do when I get up out of bed this morning what are you gonna do in my life we should have expectation hallelujah Amen no sure it's going to be some battles as as the first church they were you know they had to fight fight some battles but we know that this is not a battle against flesh and blood but it's against teaming power amen but we have to recognize when Jesus died on Calvary he loosed the life of God was loosed upon the church he comes in dwells in you there's nothing between you and God anymore he breached the chasm he bridge the gulf hallelujah that he can dwell and walk with you every day of your life amen he's not some distant gods anymore now so we don't battle against demon power but I mean sorry we don't battle against flesh and blood but against demon power most of which comes in the form of religion and when it's all boiled down it doesn't produce the life of God and a people right but what religions are religion a religious spirit does not produce the wood and flesh it does not produce Jesus Christ and flesh now Satan can copy anything but he can't copy the word right so there's going to be a battle a contest is going on right now there's actually faith and doubt a fighting in this place in your mind is faith and doubt fighting and depends what you agree with what you agree with is where who's going to win so ever you cast your vote with unicast it was Satan and his doubt or faith in God right and that's who's going to win in here right so these are battle going on right now it depends what you pander to is what's going to win so now there's going to be a battle but we but we understand from revelations 12 at thee it says and I heard a loud voice so I don't have this on there I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of us Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death so it says that there was a war in heaven Satan was cast down but now there's some over coming upon the earth and so and how they overcame him was by the word of their testimony and by the blood of the Lamb was how these people overcame you're the devil doesn't care if we come to church he doesn't care if we say we believe the message he cares when the life in that word comes and dwells of you when the word becomes flesh that's when he that's when he has a problem with you he never you look at Jesus you know he gathers his apostles quite a few times in the scripture they tried to stone jesus the apostles were there wasn't they have a God who them because the life of God wasn't anemia the wood hadn't become flesh and them you they were gathered to the word they believe that word but hadn't become one with them yet and then after the day of Pentecost who are they trying to kill who they're trying to intimidate with the word had become flesh right so it's the same thing with you and I I mean we can just look on the devil doesn't really bother but then when we really become one with our Lord Jesus then he really tightens them it tries to bind us down and keep us quiet and that's when we're going to stand up so I know my God has put me here for a purpose as to manifest his word to be a final voice to a final age and Here I am this is what I'm here to do this is my job I'm going to do my job hallelujah glory to God so now to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb allah where do they testimony this is talking of you right and so the word of their testimony now a testimonies evidence given and you can only give evidence if you're there when it happened right you can't give you can't give testimony unless you're there unless you saw it unless you experienced it then you can really give testimony right so you can overcome now if you're if you were there you have a testimony so I was there when Jesus saved me right I was there when he washed all of my sins away I was there it happened to me right I was there when he filled me with the Holy Ghost I was there when he healed me hallelujah I was there it happened to me it's my testimony right hallelujah now we need to recognize sometimes you know we journey on and sometimes we need to look back at what God has done relive it and it increases our expectation of what he'll do because sometimes we sometimes forget him moving and we take it for granted just all we come to church and we believe the message it's all wonderful you know but the reality see we have we don't just have mechanics right brother I've seen as the rising the son the bride has both the mechanics and the dynamics he said it's like you have two Cadillacs and they can be the best cars they just rolled off the assembly line perfect in every way one has a spark like one doesn't have a spark plug the one with the spark plug can prove what the engine can do can't prove there's gasoline in the tank can't prove what the car can do because it's going to spark like it's got a fire to ignite what's in the tank right and unless that fires you can say anything you want you can't prove it right but the Bride of Christ doesn't just have the mechanics doesn't just have the Cadillac but it has the fire in it to prove what's in the tank to prove what the engine can do hallelujah is the same thing with you and I friends we don't just talk about the cross we have the life that was released so we can prove the victory that he won because he manifested in our life right that's why I love I love you know how these two parts of redemption the first body he purchases his bride and the second party claims his bride the second part you get to enjoy and live out everything you did in the first part right so now he purchased it it's like mention if I had a whole bunch of money and I went and bought some island someplace tropical island so I purchased it but what's good at just buying it unless you go to live there and enjoy it right what's good so honey we're going to holiday island or something and and what if she just tells if I forgot this island we got this island I forgot this island and people say have you ever been to it well no but we've got this island you know but then when you go and enjoy it you go and experience it that's very different cuz now yeah we're up this island and Here I am enjoying the island hallelujah it's the same thing now this message we just enjoy what he did for us that's what the message does opens up gifts to you redemption gives Hugh Watson the power of the blood is manifested in a brave I mean so he he died that he'd become one with God and man and that's why God's Spirit moves among us hallelujah that's why it comes and dwells in you maybe because you're enjoying his what he purchased on Calvary you're enjoying in your life he comes and heals you hallelujah he gives you peace of passes all understanding right hallelujah you know I'm so glad I was thinking about he say well I'm not we had now the frogs are leaving Oh Amy I think it's like we we shouldn't live below expectation you know when we say the Spirit of God moves it's not something we imagined right you had talked I've had times I felt drunk under the under the power of God I felt I felt drunk I used to be a drunk so I felt that way but there's no perverse part of it and if once praying we're just rejoicing and God was there staggering like a drunk person hallelujah you you get a drink of this wine and it's way better than even two drivers ride in the world how long it just gives you peace and you never regret the next morning at all what happened to me you say hallelujah it happened to me I wouldn't do it again and you become an addict hallelujah you become hooked you gotta make up to the Spirit of God hallelujah we maybe you say well you know people sometimes just think they just they just can find God to moving in church God doesn't just move in Church got to move outside of church he said I never leave you nor forsake you I mean we used to have youth meetings down in Christ Church and we would watch brother cloud ratings brother wrong Spencer you know and at the end God always moved the spirit ago I just came down SiC him on you he was there and we were praying well a lot I think the last one we had we're praying as like a beam came down to the room we all had our eyes closed we could literally pick it come down it came anointed tongues interpretation happen God moved hallelujah that's just in our house they meant we've had times I thought the pillar of fire is right there feel like you could literally leave this world go to the next world hallelujah God lives he's a being I mean Abraham Moses met God in the burning bush that same God is here to be met he's not far away someplace he's present that's why we're going to create an atmosphere around us I mean that we we try be true human we try and keep order and different things if God is anointing it's always an order as I say brother Bram burly pull tells a testimony there's a sister and your brand tabernacle gets excited against the swinger handbag throws it across the tabernacle hallelujah brother Brad never rebuked her for it she's just happy hallelujah we shouldn't be too you know thing is we get so tense we get so tense people who go to a sporting you know you know they go watch the rugby or whatever they don't get tense we're going to feel a certain thing that I'm going to say wonderful and clap and start to sing with the rest of the crowd they don't get all tense about it they just enjoy the game you just got to enjoy the service enjoy his presence don't get all bound now oh I've got to feel this before I go like this done you say hallelujah paulien is a he just hit a six uh he just had a four hallelujah aim it straight out of the park Laurita God just rejoice he inhabits the praises of his people not trying to work you up you got to relax because the devil gets us all bound and tense and all this way just relax let go and let God have his way thank God let God have his way Allu you I was there when Jesus saved me I have the testimony amen now we do not just learn as I said we don't just learn about the cross and how jesus paid it all but we actually experience it I mean if you have really had your sin washed away you know what it's like you know what it's like to be free you know we have to go back like the children of Israel they crossed the Red Sea they see their enemies drown they see their slave masters did holy the ones that bound them and drove them around and use them is just a tool in their hands they died Kalu yeah and they didn't just sit there say well hallelujah well done praise the Lord where we going they begin to dance they've begun to rejoice they began to praise the Lord because their enemy was dead Aleut oh I wish I had voice I mean there are a joy sing hallelujah hey you see that one I don't know what their names would be in Egypt I don't care but he's dead on the seashore hallelujah he's being drowned that one read me now he's dead Holly that one who what me made fun of me and mock me he's being destroyed Holly in the same devil that mocks you you got to realize by the blood and he can't follow you the devil can't follow you he tries to chase you he can't follow you hallelujah you know you know how you kill the devil you start to praise God you want to get the shackles off your life you get to praise him remember God doesn't look at you he doesn't care what situation urine he looks at the blood he looks at his son he looks at his sacrifice his sacrifice was accepted if you accept that sacrifice by faith in you become accepted it's not you're not examined Jesus was examined I'm not the one that's sitting in the hot seat he said in my hot seat he took my judgment I don't need to worry he paid it all I'm just a beneficiary of what he did hallelujah so why should we get a worried about it as we get a worry hallelujah now season first Corinthians six and nine to eleven know ye not that the unrighteous shall not here at the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revelers nor exhaustion is Shallon here at the kingdom of God but such were some of you right this is what I want to get to about such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God so we were such a time one of those sometimes you gotta go back to what you were even if you were raised in the message you had no experience and then one go one day God found you on your pew and the word became a living reality that's a rectory that's a rejoicing I knew that God would find you even in a church we made bypass many but he finds you holy they quicker themself to you hallelujah that's a glorious thing Lord you found me you revealed yourself for me hallelujah that cause us to be rejoicing because you know did you know you know the only place where people get scared if people shout should be a morgue you know if I'm in a morgue and I hear someone shouting I'd get real scared because they because they should be dead right they should be dead but if you go into a hospital you go to the maternity suite and you hear woman crying and babies being born you expect it you expect noise don't you because that's the place you're in with this life coming with his birth you should expect you should expect crying and travailing in birth and you should say oh god help that person bring that one through may they not just but you mother just not just have contractions but man life couple other lujah it's the same thing here I mean when don't we should be scared of people dance and cry and shout there's a place where life tub where deliverance comes where freedom comes where healing comes where deliverance comes where God fills fills us children with His Holy Spirit hallelujah this ain't no morgue we're not and Bob was some dead religion of man earlier beware of our transfusions by the blood this price hallelujah that's exactly right if everyone was did quiet in their seat I'd say something's wrong in this place I mean but people get happy people should be happy we should be happy enemies been defeated he's got a broken back brother Bram saying that Satan's back was broken at Calvary hallelujah he's been defeated us never keys to his own house we have all the power we are not on the run right we are not on the run we are in control God is in control of every part your footsteps are ordained and they're all deigned in such a way that God will reflect himself out of you will bring forth a character that's his character I'm into everything we go through it's the manifest his word in you hallelujah so we should just rejoice amen so they had been redeemed by blood and by power people of Israel and when they cross that red sea and they saw their enemies defeated they had a good old-fashioned Pentecostal meeting hallelujah brother Ben Sizzlin is actually the oldest religion that there is been even before the foundation of world godus Jobe where were you when the Morningstar shouted sang for joy hallelujah when God was thinking of you that's the state he saw you in and the devil I heard brother Dwayne Lawson say those are those stands quoting the devil cannot change in time what God has ordained in eternity so God has ordained in eternity will be shouting will be rejoicing will be worshiping him will be giving him praise because he's redeemed us he's washed us he gave us victory over the devil he took us in a rapture we got home safe hallelujah isn't that going to make us rejoice although we got home safe Alleluia you got us here glory to God so the devil can't change in time what God has done in eternity amen if it if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life it cannot be erased cannot be changed your name is there and you must manifest that name you must manifest the contents of that book so your life will manifest you just take you just take your job and I've got it in here somewhere John had her John was weeping when he's up in heaven so he's standing on mas right he's standing he's on the Isle of Patmos he's carried up by the Spirit of God into eternity and he any and he sees the four and twenty elders he sees the book the book sealed in the right hand of him that sat on the throne and he's weeping he's the one who leaned on Jesus bosom is the one who soon him resurrect right here's the one who's our there on the day of Pentecost but he's weeping because this is the book in the right hand of the original owner he doesn't see anyone worthy to take the book he went much but then one of the Angels will the elders he don't weep John the Lion of the tribe of Judah is prevailed holy and the turning saw him come out of the eternity wounded bloody overcome the Lamb he saw Eterna saw a lamb holy that's why when you see God in this message it's not as not a judge to judge this world you should see a lamb because we are the Lambs wife how they see your sacrifice your mercy your high priest your intercessor your Redeemer that's what you should see hallelujah and any sturm take the book and in the four and twenty elders cast down their crowns and they begin to rejoice and then John began to rejoice is it everything in heaven and on earth under this whom acquire glory blessing honor hallelujah to the lamb and brother Brahim says John got excited because John saw John John saw himself beyond the curtain of time he sees it in the breech message he said John got happy because he saw himself beyond the curtain of time so when the book came open he began to rejoice even though he is with the one who who was going to take that book it's wheat because in you have no man will show him where they take the book everything stuck and God doesn't like stuck God doesn't do stuck he does redemption he does full restoration that's how that's what our God does polio so he looked beyond here he is standing on Patmos he looks beyond the curtain of time he sees himself up there rejoicing redeemed hallelujah and that's the bride's revival John represents the bride in the book of Revelation right and that is the bride's revival when we see the word come open the else come off the book and the mighty onion says you earned this book this is you hallelujah this represents you and then we begin to realize well we're part of redemption I mean God's focuses are sexually you know God's focus is you and the sour hallelujah you're not just to tack on your the whole thing over here we need to I pray we could just he's on Patmos though I was thinking about this the other day because we think he's there but he's actually he's in a prison he's on a prison island do you think he was the same John after that hallelujah we we're still here right we're still in this body but we shouldn't be the same old people when it becomes more than horse riders you see the lamb because more than tribulation two witnesses the semen seal comes open to you that's Christ Himself coming to you right showing you that you're part of the plan because he's seventh seal winds up all things that's the end of time the end of the world systems the end of sin the end of all things it's all wound up in the seventh seal right and when you find yourself God reveals it to you that that seal is him as Christ Himself then you begin to realize we're at the end and I'm part of the winding up and my in destination of streets of gold hallelujah and the devil can't dance their holy hallelujah will be dancing he'll be burning hallelujah I think we should I think we should keep that on our hearts don't you think I like the end of the book come over here glory to God now you say but we're not Pentecostal people not by organization brother Brahim says that Pentecost is an experience right an experience so we are Pentecostal in that way but we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in the bride age while we everything that Adam lost has been restored we've been taken back to the original faith hallelujah glory to God brother a season spoke of where the original seed he says high breeding first started an Eden started in Genesis it's the beginning that's where it ends up over here in Revelation at the scene coming of Christ but now remember quickly he says that's why each generation has its own revival it gets a chance at the word then they highbreed it instead of taking it on they go somewhere else that's why every jet that's why God opens his word to to every generation because the previous generation gets off to the wrong thing about hybrid if they add man's ideas but this is the end you were going to realize we're the end of that cycle the cycle of revival and death has been broken hallelujah that we are not here to have revival than death and then another group raised up and revival and death as has happened you read the book of Judges revival and death revival and death even through the kings revival and a holy a down through church history revival and death that's the end of those things we're living at the breaking of that cycle where it's not revival and death it's just revival that's a quickening and awakening holy that we don't go down to death we just keep growing on and on but every generation has its chance at the word for every generation has a chance for God to live in them God to manifest his word in them I mean when they when when when you begin to realize hey God is here have we realized God is here ever realized that he walks among us I mean we shouldn't put a limit on what he can do hallelujah he can do all things as I said on Wednesday there's a voice came out of the throne window third horse rider was riding forth touchy not the oil and the wine so do not put a limit on my revelation then I put a limit on the stimulation by revelation touch it not devil you can't touch this I'm gonna pour it out in full hallelujah and that's where we are aren't we I mean we're not here just to have a bit of a feast just like when when Jesus you know you know it's Jesus first miracle six waterpots of purification turns the water into wine he's the seventh those ones you can drink empty you can't drink any people I mean you can't run out of this vintage hallelujah just keeps bitter and bitter and bitter because he's the source of the life hallelujah he's the life giver amen now revival brother BAM he see he's standing by Lake Michigan and he sees the waves jumping the winds on the water you know and he's and he sees the boats rocking and he says what's going on this is why the lake is having a revival see it's jumping and shaking why there's a Russian mighty wouldn't coming down on it I thought well you know what there isn't one more drop of water in there right now than it was when it was perfectly still no more water in it that's just all stirred up and well now what's it stood up about you know what are stirring up with the water dose it washes all the trash out of it up on the bank that's what we need a washing out of unbelief on the bank let the Word of God have preeminence that's what we need a revival to and wash out all the unbelief all the bugs and superstitions and things come out and see God is still God that's what we have revivals for and that's what the brides revival is washes all the trash out of your life Spirit of God sweeps through the church moves over your soul sweeps all the bugs and superstition hallelujah that we can be a cleared clear lake hallelujah Amy but that's what we have revivals for that's what God does he sends a spirit upon the earth blows over the place holy it transforms lives remember he is the same yesterday today and forever brother Bram says the Ephesian Church age he says the key given to me this is when he's looking at what the church ain't messengers are who they were rather the key given to me the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age as a most scriptural one in fact it's called the keystone of the Bible that's the Keystone the holds it all together it is the revelation that G that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ the same little say that the same the same yesterday today and forever Ecclesiastes 3:14 15 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God do with it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which hath already been and God requires that which is passed here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will keep on doing until we're down for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages is the kind of men that God chose for the first stage in how God manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all the other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages he says the keystone of the scripture he's the same he doesn't change so when I read when I read the New Testament he's the same God when I read about Moses when I read about Enoch taking a rapture he walked with God he's the same God Elijah on Mount Carmel same God God will fight for you yeah God of God backed up his word you know as word as as bright as his word I mean God defends his word hallelujah we're not here to fight the battle he fights the battle he he backs up who he will hallelujah God fights the battle so he's the same God with Moses same God he's the same with Joshua the same hallelujah all the way down through the same down to the New Testament era the same so when I read about God and the boss that you're the same one today you're not a different one I mean if you could if you can cause people will come out of prison like you did Peter you're the same God today if you can heal Legion to deliver Legion you you still deliver today if you can come down the day of Pentecost and fill your church they stagger around like drunk people amen as the fulfillment of prophecy has happened he's the same God today hallelujah we have more than one promise then then then they did hallelujah we should be rejoicing we say this is that spoken by the entire scripture that a bride would rise in the end time maintenance image alleluia alleluia now it says this in Isaiah 43 here we are Isaiah 43 nurses one of the first what are the first probably the first unofficial service we had hallelujah we're back in paternity preaching on the Philistines are upon thee and God made a way and sister Bernice to God the Holy Ghost totally different person totally different person from that hallelujah and then there's this prophecy came out behold I'll do a new thing now shall spring forth show you not know it I will make away in the wilderness this world as a Wilden he says I'll make away and rivers in the desert the beasts of the field shall honor me the dragons and the elves because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to drink to give drink to my people my chosen this people I fall for myself they shall show forth my praise hallelujah sir I will bring I will bring waters in the desert away in the wilderness that and I'll give drink to my people holy are my chosen I mean we have a water that never runs dry we are not we don't have some broken system someplace where that artesian well of the Holy Ghost that is gushing forth hallelujah so we have drink I mean who is drank from the fountain and found it to be good hallelujah and there's no wiggle tails in it it's not lukewarm it's not you don't have to scrape all this whatever off the side of centrifuges down to get water it's clear hallelujah it's not got anything bad not anything man-made it's just clear rivers of living water get it what I'm glad about we have the wood and the spirit we have an open wood and we have God to quicken that word to us I mean we don't have one or the other we are both I mean both are running together hallelujah that's why I said before we have the mechanics and the dynamics you're gonna have all the mechanics you want but you neither dynamics to make it to go down the road and by the grace God supreme grace the bride has both the mechanics and the dynamic Alleluia amen so now we have these this people are formed for myself they shall show forth my praise hallelujah and you and we praise God because the revelation he has given us that's why John could praise God when he saw the book open he began to really worship God because he received a revelation you're part of the plan of redemption you're part of the winding up of the plan and he's a symbol of you I trust when you see John in the scripture in the book of Revelation you see yourself like us here's John he's standing on there all of Patmos he is a voice behind him God's going to put him and put you in time put the bride in time his a voice behind him he turns around he sees seven golden candlesticks he says one like the Son of Man walking among candlesticks see he's already advanced past the church ages and hears a voice behind me to show this is what's happened this is what's going to happen or what is happening this is what will happen helllooo you it's like we've come the bride has come out of lady I see and the will saloon lady ousia right but the bride has lifted up into a bride age because God is not there anymore he's not in the church world anymore he's with his bride hallelujah so now John is representing you because God wants you to say this is where you are and I'm because at the end of that time what he's lifted up the heaven in a rapture lujah so that and you see brother Branham whenever the angel says to John come and see go look into the message and the things that John was told to come and see that's the messenger himself preaches on those things go have a look it's a personal book it's a bride's book it's not a book of mystery book of symbols to us I miss God says this is where you are this is what the devil's doing we're not ignorant of his devices this is where you are this is where I am this is where I'm going to thank you hallelujah so we should just rejoice Allu you as sees in Luke 15 it's a parable of the of the woman that had ten pieces of silver she lost one now and then she looked lights of candles she sweeps the house trying to find that which she has lost and then when she finds that she rejoices tells everybody looked at which I have lost I have found now those coins is like a wedding band they the ten coins and they're here and if they lose one they're considered an immoral wife so now it she's got a redeemed Church and redeemed that which she is lost right so she lights a candle we have a candle we have a light and you begin to search now what belongs to me because you know blows you there's a place for it right there's a place she knew she meant to have ten coins right and what I'd lost you knew one two three four five six seven eight nine is a hole I'm missing something there should be something in here if the devil has taken your joy right if the devil's taking your peace if the devil's taking your long-suffering your faith your rejoicing your first love that's your inheritance that belongs to you I mean a real prayer life joy just to walk with God joy unspeakable full of glory that's what we have we don't just cabbage down you know God doesn't God has never called anyone to come in with a full zeal and a rejoicing and then just well I'm mature now I just calm down and you know we're just a bit more no the fire should get greater I mean the love should get more holy the piece should get greater you should be more in love more happy with Jesus more rejoicing in his word that's how we should be that's how we should be Amen it's just like a like a real marriage more low hallelujah because you know each other better you understand each other more you appreciate how the more how this gets great it doesn't just plateau and well this is my role and I'm the husband and she's the wife and these are children and this is our job description and I'm just doing a job and no mercy ma oh god help us no no way it's not like that it's not like with God well he's my Savior and I see the plan of redemption I can take you through the message from from the first one to your all the way down to future home into Communion and put it all together oh this is those things are good both at the life without the life it's good to quote it you're the devil actually oh I'll tell you something this thing can't quote me the message and the Bible way better than me and it can do it in multiple languages I can only do it billion one so this thing can out quote me it can say brother Brahim says way more than me or Jesus says this or the Bible says this but this is never going to produce the life of God this will never ever this was not ordained to produce the life of God this the soul of man is ordained that God would dwell in there to produce the life of God so it's more than just quoting it's lived it's going to live in you I mean that God would quicken and I always pray Lord when we hear this mess clicking it to my soul to produce a life of God in me telling it when I read the scripture I'm not here to learn something but you would take your word quicken into my soul that I would become the living manifestation of that word hallelujah Moses received the law what did it make him the meekest manual the earth that's an attribute of Christ's character cause he received the law by revelation the scribes and Pharisees they learn the same law they are proud arrogant people and when people come in or they leave and they say well I was proud on the message I'll say very simply they never meet him they learnt it they learnt it or people are living in fear they never meet him because when you really meet him there's no fear there's no fear I'm not afraid I'm not afraid of him he's not my judge to condemn me guilty he's my judge to previous hallelujah just like the woman taken in adultery where are thy accusers he's the supreme judge he it just yeah well let's just go back a bit he preaches the Sermon on the Mount he's the lawgiver that was with Moses gave him the law the same lord give us now in flesh he preaches the Sermon on the Mount he magnifies the law you have heard of old time he shall not commit adultery I said you he seven looks upon a woman to lust after and as hard as commit adultery already you shall not commit murder I say but I say to you if your anger with your brother had a cause you're guilty he magnifies the law and then now in the days of Moses the leper was thrust out of the camp right wasn't even allowed near the same law givers in flesh he comes off the mountain he comes a leper Lord a foul will make me clean he says I will be their hole hallelujah son of the blood of bulls and goats that leper was cast out but now the lawgiver who just magnified the law who's full of grace and truth hallelujah comes and that lip actually is allowed to come to him and he's no longer a leper hallelujah because grace overshadows the law right but if there's no grace then you're in fear but when grace comes upon your heart you're not afraid anymore the woman's caught in adultery here's the supreme judge riding in the sand with his hee hee servers without sin let him cast the first we probably would have been right-handed I don't know and then if one drops their stones walks away and he says to her woman where sine accuses and she says there's none my lord supreme one hallelujah neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more see the devil he wants to bring us to a trial he wants to bring us to a trial but you know who he proves guilty himself who does he prove innocent it's God that justifies it's God that calls X God that glorifies it's not man we're not we don't sell I don't justify myself or do those no dude that's him right and someone who's really coming to that relationship knows it's him it's not me that's the Christian he's the Christian and me he's the one that keeps his word in me I don't have to say well I've got a you know I never waked well well you wake up in the morning you know yeah I'll leave it but I don't think in my mind well I have to behave this way and I have to do this I got to keep myself from this I shouldn't do this I've got a dress this kind of way and you know I just get up that's how men you right you shouldn't be trying to keep the word that's where people fall apart they try and keep the message well I'm a message believes over two doesn't let us know if he's in you he keeps it that's why it's actually you enter into rest you are not striving anymore you enter into rest and eternal Sabbath right so the bride is now resting it's not me that do it the works it's my father dwelleth in me he doeth the works that's why a lot of people get so that's why I say Oh God just bring them a full birth stop travailing just just birth the child give yourself to him hallelujah don't hold back otherwise you always be stressed just just give let go and let God that's why brother Jeremy said take your hands off the bar enjoy the ride hallelujah Buffalo earlier and maybe some corkscrew and loop the loop and you can't see your you know whatever let go Lord this is going to take me up holy hahaa just enjoy the ride but you've gotta enter into rest hallelujah he that enters into rest ceases from their own works their own works of trying to be a believer no let him be the believer in you that's all you need to do that's what the missus came to do take us from traditions brother I said Pentecostals were good legalists as that part of the body but now we have the mind of Christ right that doesn't mean we don't do away with sanctification we don't do away with holiness but he's the one who makes us holy if you're going to give you a will hallelujah I'm so glad it's such a freedom hallelujah I mean your own flesh is dead I mean you know we're living is dead only you don't need to worry about oh I've got to do this this and you know he pleases himself in you you know with faith they says let's go to Hebrews 11 holy let's go to Hebrews 11 and one Kolia we know faith is a revelation c is here now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now we know the word hope in the Bible is to have expectation with pleasure right you're under it's not a stab in the dark hope you have an expectation it's a hope so you're expecting it's going to happen hallelujah you're under expectation it's on that's why we have expectation for the rapture because there's a hope faith has given you the expectation for a body change hallelujah now for by it the elders obtained a good report for through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen are not made of things which sorry things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice then that have came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please him now let's just stay right let's just stop right there let's turn that around so see it's here but without faith it's impossible to please him I say but with faith it's impossible not to please him right so if you have real faith God has quickened his word to you you have real faith revelation faith as he become real to you I'd say yes then if you have that kind of faith it's impossible not to please him hallelujah hallelujah to God hallelujah for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him hallelujah it's impossible not to please him now aren't you glad about that if you have real real faith not just trying to believe or some well my daddy told me my mommy told me it becomes real to you he becomes personal to you hallelujah glory to God they season Deuteronomy let's just jump through this a bit he said in Deuteronomy 6 and 20 and when my sons ask thee in time to come saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath commanded you now then shall say unto thy son we were pharaoh's bondsman in Egypt and the Lord brought us up out of Egypt with a mighty hand and the Lord showed signs and wonders great and so upon Egypt upon Pharaoh and upon all his house her household before our eyes and he brought us out from thence that we might bring that he might bring us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers and the law commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the Lord our God for our for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these Commandments before the Lord our God as he doth commanded us so notice what they begin with what mean all these things and they go into the testimony we were in Pharaoh's house we were his bondsman as slaves but then the Lord came and brought us out he brought us out so we were one slave that's why we've got to keep our testimony shouldn't be some dead memorial right we should always keep it alive right this is what God has done for us this is why we're here this is what we've been called out because God called us out and now we're a free people in the land and God gave us this word Pylea to keep us victorious in this place it's not - yeah the law I know I've said it before but the law wasn't really something just to bind the people down the purpose of the law is that they would dwell in their land that they would be victorious every man would dwell under the earnest vineyard and under his olive tree whatever more and that possessed the fullness of the land and if the enemy ever tried to come and they'd be killed that was the reason for the law that God would come and dwell among his people and many times we just look at the negative of people that the devil always loves to anointing the negative he never ever says well you see that person he was once a drunk and that person was once an adulterer and that person was in the sin and that person was this way and she was a prostitute but then but then God came and delivered them and they became new creatures and their old life was dead and you know he never points that out he never points out what the word does for the believer never ever has he ever done that he always points at all but you got to do this and you got to do it you look at the wrong things Allu you what is it done for you I'm not the person I used to be hallelujah and I thank God that I'm not that person and you should bow it doesn't matter how long you've known the Lord for you say thank God I wasn't I'm not that person anymore thank God I'm not part of that group thank God I'm not walking in darkness anymore thank God I'm not trying to Pat it to my friends and please them and whatever who cares about that well I want to look cool who cares about looking cool I want to look cool with God hallelujah I wanna be in his team hallelujah doesn't that matter Amy glory to God now I want to just go into this so we are we're anointed to speak as I say just rejoice the devil wants to bind us down you know if I you don't have to raise your hands but 9 times out of 10 before you come to church is it all peaceful and happy at home you know you just you know just like a perfect day it's like okay kids a symbol yes and they get ready and they're waiting for you in the car and there's no trouble everything's fine between you and your spouse 9 times out there never like that because the devil knows if you're just get in contact with God if you just get into his presence one time and really rejoice and God can take over your vocal cords and speak things into the earth amen a manifest in South Korea he's in trouble the temples in a lot of trouble hallelujah and that's wasters he tries to cause trouble and then we have the soy our mind you know I heard it I know a brother said it but there was a I think from America someone in there and there's a some people came to some special meetings and the wife and the husband they had such a big fight before church and then they're in service and he's just rejoicing and he's praising God and he's giving him glory and she's all like this inside and she's so angry at him and she's half the service how can you do that you just said that to me and this will happen how can you do that in church and the husband just says God never did anything bad for me he never did anything bad to me I made a worshipper you understand what I'm saying he didn't have a grudge against him they may have things they need to sort out but Heath that was already sorted out the blood of Jesus Christ made that right that's way just worshipped him hallelujah so just this coat hooks up there hang you trouble up forget forget to pick it up when you leave forget to pick it up when you leave but just hang it trouble up doesn't matter what's been going on I'm facing a mountain hallelujah hallelujah I mean the children of Israel they face the Jericho they just must surround it with the word and trumpets in at the time they blew and shouted then they won only so just just leave it there take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there Allu yeah you may find that's why you know we always try and fix I think it's a man thing we try and fix things you know thing you know you hear about things you're amazing under how do I fix it mode but sometimes that you they just want to tell you you know and the problem is we we you know the best way to fix things thank God come down did God come down anoint you God come down and aren't you and he'll fix it sure maybe you got to say things and whatever more but he's the fixer hallelujah glory to God now and Jesus answering them saith unto them have faith and God fulfill I said to you that who service shall say unto this mountain be thou removed shall be cast into the sea and shalt and thou shalt because he and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he hath said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say to you what thing what thing soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so saying if you believe and pray for this to happen then you have to have confidence in your prayer you have to have faith in your prayer that you have prayed it and it's going to happen slowly God you know you know brother I said about when God made the heavens and the earth he just said let there be and and the prophesied he believed his own word and it came to pass we're made in God's image right we have to do the same thing you have to have confidence that he has heard your prayer and and your prayer will come to pass now he says this you know and the reason I want to say this I'll just say it now there's nothing impossible with you right many times you say god there's nothing impossible with God but he accesses there's nothing impossible with you whatsoever things you ask it shall be all things are possible to them that belief do we have believers today all things are possible to them that believe so God doesn't limit some things are possible all things all things you know brother Berman right and I'll read the quotes but I just want to put it out because you're kind of looking at me saying where are you going with this so I'll just give you the conclusion then we'll go through the first and second act of this okay brother Ram says that man is omnipotent all-powerful man is omnipotent that's why Jesus said nothing is impossible with all things are possible then that belief so there is nothing that man cannot do man is all-powerful okay now I'm going to read this but there were this is this is from the Patmos version 1960 but there was another young man who came into the world one time he died at 33 he conquered everything that could be conquered when he was on earth he conquered passions pride he conquered sickness he conquered devils when he died he conquered death when he arose he conquered hell he went up and conquered everything that was against mankind and winnowed the winepress of God and crushed it down and conquered death how grave sickness formalities everything else and overcame at all and rose on the third day and conquered all the atmospheres above and cut that mess between God and man and connected heaven and earth together glory oh my there he stands the mighty Conqueror since he rent the Velen - there he is he has the keys of both death and hell hang on on my side fear not laid his right hand his power upon him and raised him up by the power of his right hand said fear not I am he that was that is which is to come I'm the first and the last he that lived and died and is alive again forevermore amen oh lo behold the mighty Conqueror lo behold him in plain view there he stands the mighty Conqueror since he rent the falen - amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden now man I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent right did he not say in Mark 11 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you have what you've said what happens when to omnipotence meet this is the same quote when God and man comes together to omnipotence something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes it seem as though they are because to omnipotence have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful she says when when man is fully surrendered to God he becomes omnipotent all-powerful so in to omnipotence meet something's got to shake so in God and man become one something's got to shake something's got to happen hallelujah he says this and he says this in the uncertain sound he says now first I'm just I'm I want to raise your faith I want to raise your faith you've got to realize who you are what you have in your position there same creative power that said let there be Sun Moon and stars that same God comes and dwells in you right and that same God wants to speak that creative power out of your lips that that he will take control of the situation there what you have need of will become material I'm not talking about money and prosperity I'm talking about God manifesting his word in your life that's the important thing I mean your brother Marie spoke Scrolls into existence spoke a storm out of existence that tumor the size of a grapefruit was spoken around existence out of his wife's side life was given back to a fish all those things happen now I don't need squirrels right I don't need squirrels I don't need a Bluth to be spoken out of existence a storm I don't need those things but we need redemption right we need healing we need deliverance I mean we need the power of got to move in this place like never before and then we need to write another book of Acts the reality of God to be in the presence of the burning bush again we need those things do enough I mean therefore we shouldn't just hold back just rip the safety off your gun put off it doesn't exist why are we holding on why do we hold back we why don't we shouldn't limit God oh lord have your way take control flood this place flood every life have dominion amen hallelujah why should we hold back as like someone who can really swim in there in the kids pool why are you paddling around in the kid I'm not you know it's like that we're afraid why don't we lunch you out into the deep oh but I can't see the bottom that's all right your danger swim you know ordained to drown right just just just launched out i but we wanna but we look cool on the side here you know launch out into the deep hellooo yeah this bride we have the final voice to this world the final voice of the final age the bride under her messenger will will be the final voice to the final age I mean we are living the bride I'm not talking about just ministry so I said we're here to create an atmosphere all of us we can bring God down to a service we can change the whole service for someone amen he say well I have no needs what about my brother what about my sister what about someone else well someone who's done here but about family someplace or God come down or God meet on these I want to praise you give you glory and have it my praise hallelujah take control of my life hallelujah why not you say oh I don't know if it can happen have you tried hallelujah Hannah was barren by the by the Tabernacle in the wilderness she wanted a child she didn't go around asking people were you have you come and prayed here and have you got a child from God she wasn't worth she had a need she had a burden Lord I want to bring forth life on a producer son hallelujah it should be the same to us Lord where your son must be born well to see a life manifested in us holy is a group of people God manifesting himself we don't need to go well has there been somewhere else what about here why not you why not now hallelujah hallelujah thank God in His Word well I've never seen it done before my wife never seen tongues and prophecy and things before God came down she knew was real holy and it happened her I never meet someone you know I just had the message in my Bible you know I was going to a Pentecostal church there way more formal than you people you people would be out of order compared to what they were like but you know I never seen anyone meet God I never knew what the Holy Ghost was him transforming a life but I heard it on tape I read it in here something in me said why not me this is for me I will know my sins are washed away I never found some testimony who what's it like I just had a burden Oh God give me that holy Lord I want your Holy Ghost I want you to come and dwell in me take over my life do things I could never even imagine hallelujah why not God here he is hallelujah we should not just hold back we don't and we have enough you say whoa and there's enough testimonies up there anyway i am i saw someone put on facebook a short clip of jack cole jet coat and maybe i'll read it next Sunday but he said when he first went to brother Browns minute he was preaching he was a is a healing evangelists he went to brother barons meeting because he heard about the sermon things he thought it wasn't true and a man came up in the prayer line he couldn't get in the pillow himself a man came up without eyeballs and brother Brahim prayed from he said in three days you'll have your sight and then Jack Cole somehow brother Brown service finishes they're kind of standing outside Brown goes past Jack Cole Crace room and says we're fighting the same devil this is God and something just ignited in him and then he thought about the man who brother I said you have eyes you'll see in three days anyway to see him he actually found them two days I think it's two days he had eyeballs by the third day he could see that same God is here that same God is here hallelujah you should go read the contemporaries there's not people never do they never go read the contemporaries whether when the messenger was here they never go see what they said about him even if they never agreed with what he taught at the end they would say God look Tommy Othman said God put on flesh once again in this generation hallelujah many of them said the same kind of thing he's go see what but people don't look at those things they just see the people throwing stones from 50 years ago it's easier to throw stones at something that's on a memory for us something living that's very different hallelujah and that's why I thank God I see you people God transformed us going through nuda God's trained us we're living we are living witness of the resurrection I mean brother Han says that a living witness to the people who once did and said drank prostitution whatever in the world have become living and they're new creatures in Christ you want evidence of this message you see look at yourself in the mirror I am a living witness living evidence I mean that this message is transforming that this is the work I mean we haven't settled down you see the movements down through the ages they always point back to their founder well our founder did this and God moved in the founders life but they created the denomination that will then do is point back they don't point back and one way we do because they will God live there but the same God we have testimony I mean we have a Living God the same God that was with the with the messengers with the bride hallelujah and that's why we can say it's not just well that happened 50 years ago it's happening today hallelujah and that's the evidence just like Timothy you're the next generation from Paul in the book of your the original Pentecostal I mean the book of Acts churchy original they had the same file they had the same life they weren't just pointing to what the what had been on the day of Pentecost they had it they weren't even there but they had it because the same God there was there is now here hallelujah it's the same thing with this message and the same God that you hear on tape is here the same things you did there he does now hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I'm glad now then first thing you know now brother man speaking of Lazarus being raised he spent about two on Napoleon's meeting hallelujah now the first thing you know a little old Martha come running out there and she said Lord oh I like that see she titled him what he was he was her Lord if there would have been here my brother would not have died see said even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you nothing uncertain about that no see that's when two positives meet see that's when two omnipotens meet see when one omnipotent she had she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ hello hello Martha how are you today and he and Christ was omnipotent see she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was the Lord and knowed whatever he asked God God would give it to him in other words she said you just speak the word and that's all you have to do whatever you ask God God will give it to you that's omnipotent all-powerful cuz he just said so see all right he was all-powerful and went to Powell's with two omnipotent powers meet together it's a contact then hallelujah when a lion here has got 150 volts and this one's got a hundred fifty volts when they come together you've got a hundred and fifty volts both way see and when you've got supreme power when Jesus said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and you've got supreme faith in that being the truth you need a supreme God to make a supreme promise and a supreme result will come I mean that's it now watch her she comes she said lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you he said thy brother shall rise again she said truly Lord he'll rise in the last last days why she had heard that word she know that that was a certain sound sure Lord he'll raise the last days he was a good boy he'll come up in the general resurrection of the last days Jesus said I am nothing I certain about that I am both the resurrection life why I am the resurrection and the life either believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me he shall never die nothing is certain about that believeth all this she said yes Lord I believe you're exactly what you said you were I mean you're the son of God that come into the world to save us and I believe that's whatever you do or say it's just perfect there's nothing uncertain about that I mean about you at all hallelujah now we're gonna jump through this real quick jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straight away the father the child cried out with T said lord I believe help thou my unbelief and the child will still be see that if you can believe all things are possible how loose there's nothing impossible now brother Brahim says in the in the church age book this is the Pergamon church age he says the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back then in the day of our Lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow that's the Bible we have to work right we have the all we've got the word yeah now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word and the Pergamon age which was as yet 200 years from the Patmos vision he knew that that drift would cause them to go into the dark ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at Pergamos and D to all churches of all ages I'm the word if you want deity in your myths then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am that word remember that and then he asked the question I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word endowments let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer you know first John 5:14 we're told this is the confidence we that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we have desired of him now we ask what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that is by the Word of God lamentations 337 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord Commander that not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't partition I mean I mean I mean I mean petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word willed you can't separate God in the word they are one now this word he is left behind on the printed page is part of him when we accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said that that his word was life John 6:63 the be part that that is exactly what he said in John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8:9 If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he's none of hers there it is he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man and faith takes the word into his heart and place it upon his lips why that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man right so when a spirit boy I know I know I've seen this before by practice anchors into our souls I mean we're a spirit born spirit filled man or woman right and faith takes that word into us heart and place it upon his lips that's why that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man or before that person that's how powerful it is hallelujah and we're anointed to speak right it says in 2nd Corinthians 4 and 13 we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written I have believed and therefore I have spoken we also believe in therefore speak hallelujah so if you have received if you have that same spirit of faith right we have believed therefore we have spoken Amy I'm not doing about preaching - about you claiming your mountain right you speak and faith and prayer what belongs to you hallelujah you cannot but Speak hallelujah cos is therefore I've spoken we also believe and therefore speak hallelujah so nothing is impossible with you I mean nothing is impossible with the bride because man is omnipotent and when God and man come together to how many pundits meet something's got to take place hallelujah and that's why it's so important when we gather or even at home when you gather you have a family altar time don't just don't just expect to just go through emotion expect God to come expect God to meet you expect God to anoint your prayer and knowing what you're reading and knowing why you're talking about then he'll come down to the family hallelujah that's what we should have expectation for I mean we should have expectation for the supernatural hallelujah amen Oh God but more he sees this he says that he sees in the church age book of the revelation of Jesus Christ he says let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians knows it since God is immutable in his nature then he's just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows it surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all houses false it has to be but now remember us Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of X but the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless that exposes Satan revealing his works which is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word that's why people come against the message because Satan trying to discredit God's Word right right down to the time when he's cars in the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works I mean that if they get the revelation of the true church and what she is what is she she's the Word made flesh I mean she is the female part of Jesus Christ she's the Word made flesh and what does she stand for God living upon the earth hallelujah we don't need to put up with Satan and his and his devices right we're a free people hallelujah and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they can get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely thought definitely throated today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power of him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them hallelujah amen friends it's not sit back amen how God is here we're here too that he would live we should believe for the impossible right we should believe for the impossible I mean we're not you know we shouldn't just believe for well some things we should believe for the impossible how can it be done I don't know but it's going to be done hallelujah all things are possible to them that belief hallelujah amen we have the musicians place hello yeah that's the question have you looked back at your red sea and seen your enemy drowned I mean have you done a dance hallelujah amen we have a living testimony I'll say this don't settle for anything less than total victory in total Liberty as one of the well the the American patriots I say give me a little bitty or give me death say so he wouldn't settle for anything but Liberty and it should be the same thing with us hello yeah
