Lord in Jesus name amen and I'll just actually one more thing we're just going to pray for um uh sister Hera and corus brother adan's where is brother adaman oh there his um parents over in um South

hands in jesus' name amen amen praise the Lord how are you all this evening you good it's good I'm feeling good I'm feeling um you never quite feel ready to go Brothers always ask you are you ready to go you never quite have the courage to say yes you know because really if it was just a man doing something if that was all that was going to be done then that would be a bit of a disappointment so so on that basis we say look yeah I'm kind of ready but you know like I I'm I'm expecting the Lord to do something although on on the flip side the Lord did say to uh Paul said to Timothy study to show yourself approved a Workman that doesn't need to be ashamed are you ready yeah man I've been studying I'm ready yeah I'm not ashamed I'm not I'm not coming up here like I haven't put any effort in and just passively try and throw this all together cuz that's not how we do the work of the Lord Hey brother impo are we diligent you know if you get a job you don't you study it you go home at night sometimes and you figure out what you're supposed to do and you think about hey you can do it better and you go there the next day and you do it a we bit better you know that's how you do things if you're a diligent person and I think if you if you work for the Lord you think Lord I want to be the best I can for you amen let's um just while you're standing could you please turn to Ephesians 3 I'm going to go 17 to 19 then you can have your seats thank you musicians oh we can put that one up there okay Ephesians 3:17-19 says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love might be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God God bless you all you can take your seats this evening so on a Wednesday I'm not really a um I just kind of made it sort of a guy on a Wednesday I'm a bit more is that all you got bring it on you know Satan always tries to get at us but I refuse to give him The High Ground you know we I just I I think I think a Christian is a gallant person you believe that like I think we've got courage I think we've got we're Gallant we're we're we're Fearless the Bible says here that that we have not been given the spirit of fear out of a sound mind and I believe Christians are actually Fearless we are we've got Courage the only person that tells us that we're not is the enemy that doesn't want us to have it I'm just going to do say a few things before I get into it because I need to just settle the get into the atmosphere but you know I've often thought who are you Brothers want do you got brothers ever wanted to be a soldier when you were small no oh man come on brother Ed you and me bro I've often thought you know what would I do say say I was in a situation where we were maybe a three or four of us ended up in some situation where there's like four of us and a 100 of them and our demise is imminent you know we maybe fought to try and hold this position all day and all night and and in the morning we're just all worn out and we we got not much ammo left and and May maybe it's our last stand you know this is we we we perceive the situation that look Lads this ain't going to end well for us you know there are sometimes when you're in a situation you just have to kind of call it and go look we ain't going to do this not going to happen you know and I thought what would I do when I end up in that situation what would I do and I I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't do is surrender no we ain't going there you know and I thought if I was in that situation I think I'll go out on my own terms you know I'm not going to I'm not just going to sit there and let you come over my whatever I've got trying to maybe a little bunker or something let you come over there and my Last Stand is you coming over and shooting me and I fall on my back and I'm laying down like that I'm not going out like that you know those little anyone seen those little dogs you know that you go and try and touch the thing and it rolls over isn't that the most pathetic thing you've ever seen and they want you to scratch its stomach you know and it just sits there with his legs up doesn't look like much of a dog my brother used to in in Gisborne we we had a house here and he he lived in it and it was on the main one of these main roads in Gisborne and um he used to rent it but it was right near the street and he used to leave all of his shoes and everything on the by the front door there and um it wasn't long before the whole bunch of shoes all got pinched you know so he goes there the next morning and all his shoes are gone from his front door and he's thinking man I've got to stop this I'm going to get a guard dog that's it we're not having any more of this you know these shoes getting pinched so my brother's quite sort of makes a pretty quick decision and goes on to the local trade like buy sell trade and gets a dog in that same day you know but usually when you do that you don't get you generally don't get the pick of the litter or you know if it's just I've got to do it today you know so so he tells me his plan on going to get this dog man and my trouble's going to be over yeah a squeak and um so I go around and see him that that night and I what oh so I go around and see him that night and he's he's got this little um he's got this dog and I go to touch this thing and this thing rolls over and curls like this and it's tail between its legs just absolutely pathetic and I say man that's some sort of guard dog you got there bro that ain't going to be doing much to protect your shoes but um are we going now that's all right so the um this one right now the topic that I've I the the the subject that I want to speak about tonight is a subject called perspective who knows what perspective is perspective and it's kind of like it's been an interesting little journey to sort of look into this word perspective and to understand you know we we there's there's perspectives on things and I I it's more of like uh I'm just just going to talk to you like a more of a a sort of speaking talking one okay it's maybe not going to be too like it's not really preaching I'm just going to do a little bit of speaking is that all right okay okay so some of this you won't read because it's a bit small but I'm just it's only the first page okay now if we talk about perspective the one of the definitions of it is the art of representing three-dimensional objects on a two dimensional surface like you can draw something and it looks like it's got 3D depth that's what you know you call that that's that's one thing called perspective um another thing is a particular attitude towards or a way of regarding something or a point of view for example most guide book history is written from the editor perspective well there's another there's another thing that says you know history is written by the from the conqueror's perspective you know like a a bunch of people will turn up into a land and they'll say well we discovered this land you know we're we're we're the great discoverers from their perspective but there were already people there so from the people there their perspective was ah Hang on we're already here we might call you Invaders instead you know it's perspectives and and so whichever perspective we read from is the one that we we take in uh number three would be a way of regarding situations and facts and then judging their relative importance like you when you have perspective you would look into situations and you would try and get different perspectives to see how that might all play out like like at the at the cafe we do the for the staff we do like a staff discount meaning they get like half price for their pizzas that they buy and then we we sort of extended that uh Liberty to the Brethren here you know you if you go there you'll get staff what we call staff discount and some people sometimes say to me oh is that like is it sort of pretty hard on the business doing the staff discount you know to the to the Brethren should I should we stop it but then so so that's a that's a question that needs a a judgment on it it needs a perspective you say well okay so let's say we do 1,000 pizzas a week how many are we doing to the on the staff discount maybe maybe on an average week because it goes up and down maybe 20 so we got that's that's like Z like .2% so in that respect that's not much and then and how much are you losing on it we say uh not really anything cuz we're just covering costs on it okay well that's not really a major if 0.02% of just breaking even is going to ruin your business then you got I don't think that is your problem you got a serious problem and then the flip side would be okay then what do you gain from it you gain maybe the Brethren one day they were going to drive pass but they think you know what we'll stop in you know so so when you when you when you stand back and get the P get a perspective on the whole thing you you come out with this judgment rather than if you just said ah no we can't be giving away things for not much stop that you know it's perspective that's how that's how these things work um another one is the proper and accurate point of view or the ability to see it object something objectively like for example try and get some perspective on your troubles you know like you might end up in a situation and you can't see the forest for the trees and someone comes and says to you look it's all right just relax you'll you know and they and they point out to you a perspective of the whole thing um number five is a way of looking at or thinking about something whether she was being rude or candid is all a matter of perspective the way someone acted towards you you'd you'd perceive it a different way based on your perspective of them like like if you were if you were in the Army and you were being trained to maybe shoot a gun and you were absolutely hopeless at it and someone that the person that's trying to train you at it was mad at you because you're hopeless and his objective is to make you good and he yells at you and he says look man you're you reload you know slide in a a sloth in a coma you know and and you you you your aim is worse than a blind man you know and he's telling you all the stuff and you and he says look I mean you're so pathetic if you don't improve maybe I just shoot you myself to save the enemy doing it you know now and maybe Johnny would think oh man I better like this pretty harsh I be maybe I maybe he's serious I be to clean up my act and start learning this thing before you know maybe I'll learn and take my chances With the Enemy rather than this guy just shooting me here you know so his but the but the perspective that you look at it you say well let's say this man got into battle and he he learned to do well from that experience and then he he was in a situation where he's like man I'm glad I could reload this gun fast I'm glad I can shoot well because that saved me in the situation so from that perspective you'd say well then him dealing with that the Man how he dealt with them was good even though it would appear like even though you could you could you could perceive it different ways like but you could look at it the other way and think well that was so rude how he talked to that poor Soldier you know he should have said oh look Little Johnny you know everyone's a winner you know the lord loves a tri you know look you getting award for showing up you you fired the gun that direction you're good you know you eventually got it reloaded we're good you know cuz we try not to hurt their feelings and then you get him out to the battle and little Johnny is just Cannon fod he gone you know so so from that perspective you say well how like which was the better perspective so it's all it's all based on how how you perceived the situation okay um it's a Viewpoint or an Outlook or an opinion or a standpoint or if we say if we say something has perspective that means we have a like you have a decent perspective on life because you see it from a different a lot of different standpoints okay so so what we want is perspective because otherwise we just look at things from a small standpoint I wanted talk about um just bring it through this here because I want to open up perspective but we have to kind of go through this first who likes gardening do anyone anyone do gardening or done a little bit of gardening I would recommend if you haven't done it like even if you're not into it if you go and spend maybe just grow a garden one time over a summer period or something you'll learn a lot in the garden every time I've done gardening and I've done a lot over the years I always think man this is such an amazing place to be and such an amazing thing to do because if you're aware of it you've got wisdom just flying at you from all sorts of directions because see God made everything that exists here and he's put nuggets of wisdom amongst everything that he's made like there's nothing that he made that he hasn't put something in it to speak to us he didn't just make something and thought I had I've got a few spare materials left over I'll just quickly whoop this together and Chuck it out there it was all for a purpose all of the everything he's made is is can can teach us things so you go out in the garden and you soon realize that the garden like it sort of deal in when you perceive what it is it deals in what the human mind is and the human heart and and things going into it and growing and coming forth it it's you you start to see that all around you when you work in a garden that's if you if you open your eyes to it that's what you see and and and I believe that's what the Lord wanted us to see because even he said himself uh the the word of God is like a seed and we sew it you know and your heart is the ground and he he's saying I designed that to show you that to explain to you these these things so then you when when you look at it you have you get these seeds and you think okay I'll put these seeds in the ground and you start to think you know this seed is a very small thing and it may not look like it's very significant but if I put that in the ground whatever's in there is going to come forth and it's going to get bigger and bigger and do whatever it's going to do and and and you start to realize well the the principles of a seed like of sewing because you're sewing a seed uh you start to think well okay it is you reap what you sew so whatever's in that seed is what you reap uh you reap where you SE if you put it there you reap it there um you reap after you se you don't just put it in the ground next day it's there and you reap more than what you seow so when you understand that that that applies to other things in life like that's why the scripture says be not weary and wello for in due season you shall reap if you faint not like just because you you think well I'm putting this in the ground and nothing seems to be happening he's saying don't be weary because it's a seed your actions are seeds and they will they will bring forth fruit after a while don't be weary just keep going but but by the same token negative things are also seeds you start to se negative things in your life they will come forth and and it will always be more than what you seow like if you start hating it'll just if you let a seed of hate come in you it won't just be that that will start to grow more and more because it it it has to because it has to multiply whatever you put in whatever seed you put in your heart has to multiply and all of our life our whole being is just a whole bunch of is just all these seeds that have been planted there hopefully as we get on we we get the bad ones out and we keep the good ones that's that's the objective of being alive and living and serving the lord we say Lord weed my garden you know if these wrong seeds take them out and some of them are big some of them take a lot of work to get out there some of them are you know you might have gone through a life of a certain thing and there's some big bad weeds in there that that are just the roots go down deep some of them takes a lot of work to get out like if you're try and get a some sort of big bad shrub out of a garden that shouldn't be there and this thing's got to be really thick and The Roots have gone down it's a lot of work to get it out you really have to hack away at it and get right down sometimes we have to have that done in our life because that's that's there are just things like that there but you learn about seeds you you realize okay once I get this thing cleaned up the the easiest time to get rid of a little weed is when it's tiny you just go pick it out and and and when you pull weeds out when you do that in the garden you're like there's a weed and you go and you think to yourself that was so easy and then you turn around you got this big one over there you think this is so hard and you start to think okay when I see something I'm going to pluck it out straight away I'm going to deal with it when it's small and and that starts to go in different areas of your life when you're raising children you want to try and nail things early cuz you think if I let that thing grow it's just going to I'm going to have to deal with something else later on okay and then you start to look at the ground and you realize what this goes in is important like the seeds can't just I can't just throw it over there and hope for the best you know where it goes is important and often in our own lives even like if the Lord's starting a work in us we won't know he's actually working like we'll know nothing about the seed of the word of God but he may be working for years just preparing the ground of our heart because he knows I can't just throw a seed in your life and the ground is just all this dry Barren ground I've got to work in your heart okay so he's so then I know Shannon's experience was that she traveled from America and went around New Zealand for like a month or two or three and and it seems like oh she's just traveling around doing an OE but it wasn't it was the Lord breaking up the ground in her heart because that at a later point the seed of the word of God was going to come in and be planted there but but if if if it was just planted when her heart was rock hard then it wouldn't have had any effect now when she was going through that process she didn't know that that's what was happening she didn't didn't think about God or nothing and understand that but she just thought things are changing something's happening and then it got to a point where when that word of God came it could just find root so God he he he plans out the ground in our heart and if it's if it's hard then he then some people just have a hard heart that's what they call that man's that man or that woman have a hard heart and nothing seems to grow in there they just the Barron it looks like this and we've talked about weeds but you you get this concept of weeds like you let wrong things come in and they grow you know they're just all seeds and they they can they can cause Havoc but weeds can also cause like if you're trying to do things for the Lord and you've got all sorts of other things in your life that are just taking up your time and like you're like more than what they should be like the Bible says you know the seed went in but then the cares of this life the deceitfulness the riches all these other things are growing around that plant that's trying to come through and these weeds are choking it and it and this the word of God can't grow because it's when we check our lives we think okay put effort here but then I've also got all this other stuff that seems to Cloud everything and I I can't actually I'm not bearing any fruit for the Lord because I'm there's there's all these other things you know um water you know when when you used to go away maybe 3 or 4 days when we lived in gisborn and we'd come back and I didn't have anyone water the garden and I get back after 3 or 4 days and I'm like man this thing's almost dead because it was a middle of summer hot and it's just parched and the the little the leaves are all hunched down like this it's pretty amazing to see though you'd water these things especially in the call of the even and you you'd water these these plants that were all hunched down and like that and it it wouldn't take very long and these little leaves would per perk back up again you know and they would you think this thing's alive this thing's responding you know and often times in our life you might find you know if you if you don't get enough of the spirit of God in your life that that water to just perk you up you can actually get quite droopy and down and you know you notice your your attitude towards things is not what it used to be you're you're more Snappy you're more argumentative you know you you're more you don't have as much Faith as what you would usually have you you get despondent you all these things because you're you're drooping you don't have enough of the water of the word of God in you but you know you come and sit in church for a while or something and you just sing the songs and hear the word and you know even over a short amount of time it can just by the end of it you're just you perked up again you know cuz this this this has come and actually the other thing you need is Sun you know you think well the sun just bakes things and they all die it's actually the opposite you know you put a plant under the under another plant and you think this one plant is taken off and this plant that didn't get the sun's just struggling away you know that's why it's often good you know the sometimes you get too many if you get too many tall trees around you it can actually stunt the growth of some people that are underneath some people sometimes need to get away from tall trees you know just get a chance to be out in the open and let the sun hit them it does it happens in families you know that some of the younger people are just surrounded by tall trees and they can't actually get out so you notice some of them I'm not advocating for this but some of them leave home and it doesn't take long 2 or 3 years and they just they're completely different cuz they you know under a different environment under a different experience they got to the sun sha on them and they could they could grow here's another one like when you look at big Open Spaces when you when you when you look at this you you have to look at everything and think and think okay I think God made these to relate to experiences like we like of how we would go through life like you you would have often had times in your life where you said I'm on a mountain top who ever said that you're not on a mountain top because you're maybe standing here but metaphorically you say it's like I'm up the top of something I'm everything's going well I'm happy it's just it's worked out so good I'm feeling so good I've achieved this and that I'm going we just got married bought a house we're going to church and I'm doing this in the church and it's like things are quite good for you so you say look I'm on a mountain top and you'd perceive that and it's nice to look around like every time you be see a big view it's enjoyable to look out at the view I don't think I me anyone that sees an awesome View and says that's a pathetic view you know they're always nice views but then the flip side as you could perceive in your life you think man I just I was on the mountain top and then this happened that happened I've just been winding down to this now it seems like I'm just It's just tough I I look this way I just see Side of the Mountain I look that way I see side I clouds over me hanging down in the valley your life seems like it's you're in a valley and you are in a valley like you do walk in valleys you know we whatever you see in nature you will walk those particular paths and and like like in your direction in life sometimes you look forward and you think oh I can sort of see a long way off I I can perceive that what I'm what I'm what's happening in my life I've I've got a lot of vision of where it's all going and I'm there's nothing really out there that's going to surprise me you've had those times in your life where it's like oh yeah this it's open spaces you you get other times in your life like where you end up you seems like you end up on this little narrow windy path where you where every week to the next is changing you think man what's around the corner next week what's happening now you know you sort of you almost you almost get scared to face another week you think okay there's another Cor what's going to be there and there's some sort of Hiccup and you got to you know try and trudge through that you think well I got out of that now you got to turn another corner there you think what's going to be there something else there it's just a it's a you get those paths you you now and then you walk on those paths all right um I want to I talked to brother Ben about this the other day you know this is so funny when you you've heard of songs that are like so many oldfashioned songs all talk about the ocean about sailing you know and I was like I wonder why that is it's because like in the 1800s when when global trade and everything started to happen a lot people started men and women started sailing a lot more you know so they would they would they would end up always on ships and as as men and women would go on ships they would start to perceive oh I'm on this ship where there's water around and when it when when the storm comes I get blind this way and that way but when it's calm it's nice and you know we've got this thing called an anchor that we can send down and it holds Us in place when there's a storm and they they begin to see all these examples so so men and women begin to write songs about it because they could see this is a bit like our walk with the Lord you know this sailing on water I just want to read you some of these um sorry that's not can you read it here we go look well to your cables my brother for severed the faith strand may be take heed lest you slip from your moing and storm toss lie Out On Life's sea drifting away drifting away far from the home of the bless then anchor yourself on the Christ Rock for under his shadow is rest so he this man would look at a ship tied up to a maybe in a harbor somewhere and he'd see the winds and the storm blow and he'd think okay that whatever's holding that ship to that moing better be good because if that gives way the ship's going to get blown and end up on the Rock somewhere and it's all going to be in trouble so that's why he says look well to your cables then he would say okay what's the cable that holds Us in the storm what the cable of Faith okay then I want to look well to that make sure that's going to hold when there's a storm come it holds so he would perceive these situations here's another one it says my soul and sad Exile was out on life's sea so burden was s in distress till I heard a sweet voice saying make me your choice and I entered that Haven of Rest and he says I've anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest I'll sail the wide Seas no more The Tempest May sweep over the wild stormy deep in Jesus I'm safe Evermore so he would experience he would he'd be going somewhere and then it was a whole lot of storm and rain and there and then at a certain point they maybe came into a little Harbor somewhere it was Shelter From The Storm and they would put their anchor down and he would say well this is is such a nice place compared to what was out there see liking it to think maybe the Lord is like this that could be storm out there but when you come out to this Haven of Rest You anchor here then this is what it's like serving the lord so they would he would perceive these things I've just got one more my ship is coming in at last my ship that sailed AAR with spreading sail and favoring Gale she's sailing over the bar she's coming in coming in over the Harbor Bar she's coming in she's coming in my ship that sailed AAR with icebound Hull and storm rent sail all batter by the sea with wind swep Deck almost a she's coming back to me now I think he's he's describing this as though maybe he was out in the world and he was all getting battered around but he's coming back and and the Lord brought him back and when he came back in you can imagine this he's coming back in over the bar and there's this ship that's been on this Epic Journey somewhere and it's all the sailes are tatted and everything and it's coming over the bar and it's going to come into this place of rest and he maybe looked at his own life and thought that was me I was sailing around it was beaten I came in Ted but Lord I'm back here now now what I want to to I wanted to get you in the mindset because this concept of perspective you have to put on like a you have to think of it like these things like it's a type okay and and you have to understand that the word of God that we that we know has has perspective okay you'll understand what I mean shortly I'll just read this here Jesus said in that hour uh he said in the hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee Oh Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seem good in thy sight so what the Lord is speaking of here is he's talking about revealing something like like showing something so when you talk about perspective it's to do with he's he's showing you something okay so that means it's something that you see it's not something that you feel it's not something that you you you touch as such it's something that you that you see right so if you like and that and and it's something that you see with your eyes so I've got this person here with their eyes closed so can you all close your eyes for a second okay so you you probably don't see anything right you know like okay that's pretty obvious but now when you open them up you see something like you see the the word of God and seeing it has to be just like what you experienced I couldn't see much then open my eyes and I could see it and then and but because God has made nature it has to be it has to be as we see it here I'll explain to you what I mean you you'll see what I mean that Christ may this one here says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith and that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes passeth knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God so the Lord the so Paul is saying that the love of God love of Christ has it goes this way it goes that way it goes that way like it's it's not just a nothing it's a something it exists as a substance and and if you cannot if if you you and he's saying I want you to see what exactly it is I want you to see the substance I want you to understand and and the word of God is as we see things here like it's substance it's not just a flat thing that doesn't exist if you if whatever you see around you the word of God has to be the same way if he says I will reveal it to you then his type has to be that you'll see what I mean in a second here's one here and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Priscilla and Aquilla heard it they took him unto them and expanded un to him the way of God more perfectly meaning they gave him a better perspective and they they painted a better picture um what I'm trying to get to is that the the word of God is actually shape this sounds like a random thought but it's not it's got substance it's got sides to it it's got perspective it doesn't just it's not just like that like a flat thing because we don't exist in a flat thing do you exist flat you exist in shape so the word of God Concepts in the word of God have to have they've got shape like like Paul said the love of God has got a shape it's this way that way that way that way and and it's your job to understand what that shape is it's not just oh the lord loves me yeah but what's on what does that side look like what does that side look like what does this side look like what does that look like what does that look like there do you understand it's it's it's substance I'll show you a uh I'll give an example of this this because when you understand that then you can better better comprehend the word of God and apply it to your own life and to other people's lives because if you think it's just one thing you're often going to mess up situations especially if you're trying to counsel people because you're just going to think it's that when it's when it's not that it's there's shape to it there's there's more to it it's not just oh you need to do this and that's the end of it no what's the shape of this that we're dealing with what shape is this word cuz cuz if God says he's going to reveal he reveals substance shapes and depth and angles you know that what he reveals to so we can better know what we're looking at it's not just a flat thing okay so so this if I said this pil pit you can all you all look at this pil pit but from where you're sitting you see that side there right like like from your perspective and if I stood here I can see that side like I see two perspectives and if I if I stood on this side then I would see three but right now I'm the only one that sees this side okay you like you can't see it it doesn't mean it doesn't exist just means you can't see it you see and often times that's like the word of God there are things that you think that doesn't make any sense well maybe you've just never seen it but if you went around there and had a look you'd you'd see it because it exists I'll show you some um where's brother ID come up here bro I just want you to because I've got what I've done here is I've got something behind here like a little present and um only brother ID's going to see it maybe one or two more okay should I no don't say don't say anything don't say anything you can go now I need adults cuz the children will like say things ad demand so you're thinking what's what are they seeing like what is there you you you are thinking that why is he smiling now what's there he's seen something he's perceived something and it's made an impact in his to him you know and and people being people were so inquisitive we're like what what's there you know what is it who doesn't who who let's go uh Josh one more we'll just do one more I should have chose a girl sorry now some of you are so inquisitive if I don't say anything about what it is you'll track down these brothers and us and what what was there you know because we're inquisitive when someone's perceived something what have they seen you know when someone becomes a Christian and other people are looking at them they're saying something different about that guy what's changed or that girl what have they seen like there's something they they they're acting different they're doing something different they've seen something that I don't know what it is but they've seen something they've seen something from a different perspective that you know and there was a there's a song it is no secret what God can do I know if you know that song it was that was it was an actor that wrote that and he was among circles with John Wayne and that and I think he received the Lord and he was he was always happy all the time and I think John Wayne said to him H what's going on with you man tell us your secret what what's happened that's when he said look it is no secret what God can do you know I've just looked I've looked I've seen the Lord from it I've seen him that's why I'm different now you unless you go and see what these brothers saw You' never really understand what was there but the minute you saw it you'll be like yeah I see you know and often times it's like they're with the Lord you know like like if I've seen it I've seen it if you haven't you haven't that's just the way that it is I can't force you to see and you can't make me unsee it if the Lord's revealed it to me it just is I'm like I've seen it you know I'm happy I've seen it from a different perspective what you might think it's silly whatever I've seen it you might think the word of God makes no sense you might think might think this whole Jesus stuff is not true you might think there was no such thing as a prophet say what you want I've seen it it doesn't bother me what you think I can't unsee it I've seen it from that perspective and and if and if someone else hasn't then then just never going to experience what you experience you really really want to see what's D you do it yeah you know that cuz that's what that's what humans are like like you've ever been in a padic and you see sheep walking around you know and one sheep will just start walking in a certain direction and all the other sheep sort of go hey John where's time going you know and and and they think that John seen something we always joke around in our house we always when we're saying something silly we're always joking an American and Jenna's like why do you always joking American and she always becomes John if there's a problem we say to here there's a problem right there [Laughter] John so where's John going what's he seen Tom John hasn't seen nothing but because he's walking somewhere the other sheep just think he must have seen something you know we're quite inquisitive we like what's he seen but that can work to our advantage you know because they they say what's that person seen what's changed about you tell me more about this there there you know if you something changes in your life for the Lord you can actually you get maybe one or two opportunities to people will ask you after that they're like oh I've seen yeah not interested but they will our inquisitive nature okay I'll show you what's there it's just real something real basic it just says when you see the smile and then walk and then smile all the way back to your seat sorry that was so they didn't really see much it was like that's that's a dud I want to just take you through these what I'm trying to say with this now to get to the the example of perception like if if you just looked at this like it's just flat this this scripture here go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father son Holy Ghost just that's it okay go here's the instructions way you go go that's just that's not quite how this thing works you know like it actually it actually works like this like like that that concept is has substance it's got different angles to it it's not just that it you understand it's got substance and when you start to think what's the shape of this whole thing what does it look like oh there's another side to it which one that oh there's a scripture that says unto us a child is born okay so that child is Jesus okay and then they're going to call him the Everlasting father H are they oh it it gives it more shape you think so then this person that's walking here is the Everlasting father H and then you'd read another scripture where he was here on Earth and he would say uh he the he says at that say you will know that I in my father and you in me and I in you so you think hang on there's a person talking but he he's saying I will be in you and a physical human being can't be in another human being so what's he referring to is he referring to the spirit that's going to be in me and and that man there is saying I as an I am that Spirit you think then and it begins to make it take a shape where you understand okay then who is this what is the name of this whole thing and you get the correct shape of what it isz this is how the word of God works it's never just that cuz life isn't like that like this Pulpit has shape everything you see has shape it has depth it has height it has width everything has shape but and if you go and try and just if people try and just look the apply this shapeless revelationist concept to Christianity that's where it all comes apart because there's no Revelation there's no they don't see the shape of it and they just go around messing everything up because they don't understand there's shape there's depth all these other things like uh this is maybe one an interesting one like if you just put this shape you know you're having trouble in the marriage okay well wife just submit yourself to your husband and next all done sorted out be on your way and and be happy but there's more shape to it than that because we're talking about a marriage we're talking about people going together we're talking about Dynamics we're talking about something that that either is or isn't formed in the heavenlies and there there's shape to this thing what does what does the whole thing look like like it you you have to have know the shape of it like okay there's another side to this also the husband he's got to love his wife as he as he like his own body and he's got to give himself for it and and so there's that side of it and you and you realize that oh and there's also this concept of love that never gives up it never it never fails and and then you based on that you begin to look at the first one the wives submit yourselves and you think well then submit to who oh so he's the leader oh so what it comes with leadership oh responsibility oh so then who's responsible to create the atmosphere here who's responsible to actually lead this if if there's no love whose fault is that you know like because you want to you want the submission but you don't want the leadership you don't you don't want the responsibility of leadership you know there's more shape to it so when you start to explain the shape of it then you can you can better counsel people and get to a better understanding of what this looks like you understand uh here's one more like uh ask and it shall be given you okay so I just ask anything from the Lord Lord give me this and it get it comes to me you know that was easy what about you know what else have I got on my list you know ask ask ask ask and see see all these things in themselves are true but if you just take it as if you don't understand what does this whole thing look like CU then you might you might read another scripture and you say uh another scripture says you ask but you have not because you ask a miss that you might Heap it on your own lust now someone could just ask whatever they want and get it all the time but they're usually not a son of God because when you become a a son or daughter of God and you go that way then you get dealt with like a son or daughter so then you don't always get everything that you ask for because the Lord judges your objective and he's going okay I know you asked for it but I've got a responsibility as a father to you to say yes or no like when our children come we don't give them everything so you get dealt with differently so you you realize okay well why did I not get that oh oh that's right because I just wanted that to show off to all my friends you know cuz you you you understand this thing got more sh or you or even sometimes you just everything gets taken away from you when you want stuff you know but like you end up like job and you think oh well sometimes you think hang on I came here with nothing I I'm going to leave with nothing so if I even get one thing in my whole life it's from the Lord praise the Lord if I get nothing well I'm no I'm no worse off than when I arrived am I I came with nothing and that with nothing Lord you've been so good to me you know nothing went wrong if you get one thing you're happy praise the Lord got one thing but he gave me 10 things and he took about 10 away you'll never take 11 away because you didn't have it to start with you know so you you'll never be worse off see you understand these things have they have shape they have concept so and it helps you to understand more the ways of God and his dealings when you when you go like that and that's why it says for by wise counsel Thou shalt make war and in the multitude of counselors Zer safety because because if you just have your own opinion you'll sometimes just get one one thought and then but you see when you you get counseled they'll give you all sorts of different perspectives and you can better understand what it is that you're looking at oh that's what that's who we're facing is it oh okay I'm glad I ask you and you and you because now I see what we're looking at I would have just headed in there with just my own thinking my my one opinion you understand this one here is then if we if we apply that to our spiritual life today this is why Revelation is so important to us because it's actually showing us and making us understand this whole picture of God and how he works and so we're not confused we don't just see a single thing we like the the revelation of the word of God brings it all to life like you think well I never saw that before I didn't realize that that was like that I thought it was just this now I see that I see this I see that it's like it it when you receive it as such it will open up you'll start to see you'll see a whole new world you'll see this world in spiritual form it just will all open up and and like this is to get the right perspective CU before that you could have the just got the wrong perspective but the right perspective is actually receiving the revelation of the word of God and then study it read your Bible like look into it figure out what it is you got like look around what is this what's the shape of this what's the shape of that how does this work how does that work don't just not look around there's substance to all of this stuff and that's why David David was a man that had that the Bible said of her it says that he was a man after God's Own Heart and we think to ourselves well I could never ever be a man after God's Own heart how could I ever achieve that but you actually can because all David did was he thought Lord what is your heart what do you think what's your perspective on things I'll read your word like the next one says Thy word have i hidden my heart that I might not sin against you I'll read your word to get your perspective on things and then you and I will think Alik you my thinking will align with your thinking and then when we come into situations we will our thinking will be similar and then we'll get on well you know whereas if I've got my if I just have this opinion here and differs with yours We're No Doubt probably going to and I'm not going to be a man after God's Own Heart but it's very easy for you to be especially with the Revelation that we've been given we can actually become like David and be man and woman after God's Own Heart that's why when when David his his perception he had the right perception so when he turned up to say Goliath was there when David turned up to this fight the perception of the people there was a man would look at himself and think okay this me here I'm this big I've got this sword I've got this spear I look over there there's Goliath he's that big he's that wide he's got that big sword and he's got that big spear he will probably beat me and their perception was correct like okay if I go head-to-head with him he's more than twice as big twice as long I wouldn't even get close to him his spear would spear me that was their perception and they acted on that perception that's why they were all standing there scared because that's all they were seeing but but see David walked in with a different perspective with the right perspective he he cuz he understood this a bit more cuz he now he he saw that perspective cuz that is a perspective that's the front flat side yeah he saw the same thing yep I'm David I'm smaller than all you guys I'm about 14 I'm a lot smaller yep that guy's a lot bigger than me yep I've only got a sling yep he's got a big Spear and all that sort of stuff yep I can see that I understand that perspective yes but then he started to think hang on and all of this always has to start with there's a God hang on hang on let's let's just pull back a little bit there's a God like all perspective has to start with that as a foundational Viewpoint because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom you you can't have perspective unless you realize there is a God because everything stems from that he says okay all right let's get it let's let's let's get this all into perspective here there is a God right and oh he's he happens to have chosen some people as his own who are they H oh that's us okay okay so that makes us God's people and uh we're soldiers oh so that makes us God's Army hm okay uh so then and he's given us land what land is that oh it's this oh okay uh and so now based on that then who was this other guy uh he's actually way out of his depth like because technically he's now fighting against this living God in his army and he has got absolutely no show of ever winning in this battle and he's actually on God's Turf that was his perspective so it's like so from based on that perspective he said hang on hang on you guys are all looking at that that's all wrong who is this guy that's defying the armies of the Living God what are you guys doing sitting here and being scared of that you've got the wrong perspective and based on that perspective he went and annihilated Goliath because he had the right perspec effective right not only that but but how he would conduct himself like when when he could go and kill Saul the men next to him said David this is your chance this guy has hampered you your whole life you're when he's gone you're going to be the king um now's your opportunity the Lord's given them to your hands kill him that is their perspective but you see David had a a more Godly perspective he said no no hang on there's a God and he anoints people and he happened to anoint this person and and he's still anointed I'm not touching this guy not only that I don't have to mle in God's Affairs if he wants to make me King he'll make me King when he wants to make me King he will do it I don't have to go and help him out and kill this guy see it was a different perspective that that that caused him to have a better outcome I've just got a few more this one here CH little children I'm going to teach you something called wisdom do you want to know what wisdom is after this you're going to have a perfect concept of wisdom okay and if you apply it to your life it will change your life so what do you see there like if you if you look at the picture you say oh you see a guy and a chair and a little like a dwarf type person sitting on the chair right like like you all see that currently that is what you see cuz You' maybe you've seen this before but if you haven't seen this before you see that picture so to your reality that's that's it cuz you're you're none the wiser you know you're not you're just that's that's all you've got to go on is that that is that there right and often times when we you know when we're young and we're growing up we think well this would be a cool thing to do CU we don't we don't know anything else we just think well that guy that movie star was cool I'll be just like them you know and that's all we got to go on now but this is from a perspective but if if we just turn a little bit and look at this from a different perspective you'll see a different picture right so that's so if we this here is just you just turn around a little bit this is exactly the same situation exactly the same thing just from a different perspective you begin to see actually what I was saying before wasn't correct like that person is not right there next to that guy that it's all it's all wared it's not as it's not what I thought and now if I bring back to that one I'll never ever convince you that that's like that anymore you'll say no no no no no that's not like that that's all around the other way I'll never convince you otherwise why is that because you're wiser I I'll never convince you but like if someone walked in the door here and they hadn't seen it they're going to be utterly convinced that's that you're going to say no man honestly it's not it's not that it's not that it's it's I'm just trust me often you hear parents say just trust me it's not that trust me see and a lot of the times when your parents tell you stuff you just got to trust them it's not that you know I've been their son I've been their daughter I've been through it trust me it's not that don't follow that guy it's not that it's uh it's this and because because you see it from a different perspective you and it can never be CH undone your your law now when you're when you're wiser you're like I can see it now and we often spend half of our time trying to convince people this trust me man don't go don't go down that road this is the last thought that I want to I want to speak on and it's um it's a perspective that we should have in our Christian walk that that that if we ever start to get despondent or anything like that this is a perspective that we should always have in our Christian walk okay then I'm going to close with this this is a if you keep this one in perspective you'll always be all right in your life no matter where you go no matter what happens if you learn to just every now and then if it all goes a certain way if you pull back to this perspective that I'm about to show you it'll it'll it will you'll always be okay Romans 8:28 says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose okay so if we're called according to his purpose then it says for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so if he fornew you then he's going to work on you and you're going to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified okay so there's this process he's saying if we often use that first verse that all things work together for the good to them that love God so I'm going to get that new job cuz I love God that's not what that verse is even though we might apply sometimes it actually isn't it's it's not really applicable in that situation I don't we can you know apply it that way you know try and but the reality is it's it's based on you are called according to his purpose like your soul is called according to his purpose and he is going to work a work in you and he's going to eventually bring you out to be a what does it say at the end a glorified son or daughter of God because at the beginning you were that you're called according to his purpose and his purpose was to bring you there so you are going to be taken all the way to the end right so that that's going to be that's going to be where you end up now based on that perspective you'd say okay what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us now we've often used that scripture I have too like oh if God's for me who can be against me in the situation I'm facing but even that's not applicable to that cuz you understand like now if I know God's form me I can apply it to there but ultimately this verse doesn't mean that right this ver this verse means uh if God before us in terms of if God has determined that we will be there how could anything else ever hinder him from getting us there it's based on that it's not based on he's going to help me out in my troubles over here because he didn't promise that but he said I'll get you there right that's why he says um he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all if he's willing to pay that big a price how shall he not with him also freely give us all things that means all things that pertain to Salvation like all things that will get you saved it doesn't mean I going to give you everything you want in life it's to do with getting you there if you need anything to get there he's paid it all and he'll get you there okay that's what it that's what it relates to then he says who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect how then could you who is possibly going to hinder that whole purpose then because if it's been fully paid he's going to give you everything you need to get there then anything that gets tries to hind you along the way no he not good enough she's not good enough all these things he says how's that even going to affect anything it's all been paid for it's all done you're going to get there who shall L anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth God's already purpose you you're Justified and and no one's going to come in and change his mind who is he that condemneth because he's saying it's Christ that died yeah rather that has risen again and it was even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us so saying even if even if someone condemns you you've got this you've got Christ that's always standing up for you right now then you bring it down to this that's why Paul brings it down now to the realm we live in and he says based on that then what shall separate us from this love that's there uh he's saying shall tribulation if you have a bit of trouble is it going to separate you if you have distress uh if you have persecution if you have famine nakedness if you have if there's a or if there's a sword uh and then he goes on and says uh basically as it is written you will get all those things for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter now we often try and think well well if I don't have those things in my life then my life's going to be good that's the wrong perspective because because basically he's saying look you're pretty much going to have all these things but none of those things are going to affect you getting there and being that that's the perspective right so he's pretty much guaranteeing yeah you like he's saying it's like like we often think when we serve the Lord we have a we have a easy path and everything goes well that's not how it works and there was never promised to be that way it's actually the opposite he says you're going to get all those things like tribulation tick you know distress tick persecution tick famine tick nakedness tick Peril tick a sword killed all the day long and cuted a sheep for sort of tick tick tick you're think oh man what a ter terrible walk but his perspective is I've guaranteed if you start here you're going to finish up here no matter which one of these things you go through right but we often in our perspective look at these things and oh life is so hard and oh man oh you know we get down because we look at this we we go through things and we look at that that's in it because our perspective is wrong we're just we're seeing this whole thing on a page like that now these things exist and they make us they make life hard and all that sort of stuff yeah they they do but but the moment you start to zoom in on them and just focus on them your whole perspective is going to be wrong and your life is going to be miserable cuz you're looking at the wrong thing so then what you got to do is do this you just got to zoom out a little bit like you just got that see that it's actually what you do you got to get the right perspective you say okay no no no no we'll just we'll zoom out we'll see what actually there is here and that's why Paul says based on all this the P the P the proper perspective is nay and all these things what's he talking about those little things over there they're basically ruin your whole life and your whole existence here can do and all those things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us he's not saying you're conquerers because you won't have them he's saying your conquerors because he's going to bring you right to the end for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and that's the perspective that the Lord wants us to have is look no matter what you're going through remember who cares zoom out who cares what does it matter if you if you live your life like that from that perspective your life is just going to be miserable because you're never going to get away from these things you'll finish one another one will start mark my words you'll never get away from that there'll be there'll be some some sort one way one way this way but that's not the victory the victory is an understanding in all of those things I'm more than a conqueror that that he's got a plan and a purpose for me I start here I end up there that's my that's the perspective that I that I look to and that was I know it's been a bit sort of throwing information at you but I want you to think about this this week okay and like you know you you'll sort of dissect it and let it sort of sink in that the word of God's this amazing it's this world of it's it's just it's got perspective it's got depth and anytime you come into a situation just think there's got to be more to this Lord
