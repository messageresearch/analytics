[26:42] amen good too heavy line here with us
[26:44] and God bless you sister savage always
[26:46] wonderful to see you god bless you
[26:49] so Genesis 38 verse 8 2 verse 10 and
[26:54] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[26:56] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[26:58] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[27:00] from the presence of the Lord God among
[27:02] the trees of the garden Anna and the
[27:04] Lord God called unto Adam and said unto
[27:06] Him where art thou and he said I heard
[27:09] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[27:12] because I was naked and
[27:15] head myself
[27:18] let's just go to
[27:21] let's go to Matthew chapter 14 and
[27:27] we just jumping right into the story of
[27:30] Jesus walking on the water and Peter
[27:33] walking on the water
[27:37] I'm going to read from verse 24 down to
[27:40] verse 27
[27:44] let's read from verse 22 and straight
[27:49] away Jesus
[27:51] constrained his disciples to get into a
[27:54] ship and goat and to go before him onto
[27:58] the other side while he sent the
[28:00] multitudes away and when he had sent the
[28:03] multitudes away he went up into a
[28:05] mountain apart to pray and when the
[28:08] evening was come he was there alone but
[28:10] the ship was
[28:12] now in the midst of the sea tossed with
[28:15] him tossed with waves for the wind was
[28:18] contrary and the fourth watch of the
[28:21] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[28:23] the sea and when the disciples saw
[28:26] him walking on the sea they were
[28:28] troubled saying it's a spirit and they
[28:30] cried out for fear but straight away
[28:33] Jesus spake unto them saying be of good
[28:36] cheer it is I be not afraid
[28:40] amen my lord bless the word you may have
[28:44] your seats
[28:46] I
[28:47] want to I want to take those three words
[28:51] be not afraid
[28:53] you know it's amazing when you think
[28:55] about it where Jesus sent his disciples
[28:58] on the boat he was the one who commanded
[29:02] them to go there
[29:03] but then the very one that they were
[29:07] they were looking for to follow them
[29:11] walked out upon the water to them and
[29:13] they were scared you know that there was
[29:15] the wind and the waves in the and the
[29:17] boat was tossed and you know the they
[29:20] were the disciples maybe they were
[29:21] concerned about the about the weather
[29:24] but then when the God that they were
[29:25] following in the God that they were
[29:27] serving came into their midst they were
[29:29] afraid the very one who could have
[29:32] delivered them the very one who created
[29:34] the winds and the sea had come to them
[29:36] and they were scared they were afraid
[29:39] and it's amazing when you know Adam Adam
[29:42] before we read there in Genesis chapter
[29:44] 3 he was never afraid he he never feared
[29:49] it never came near his mind or as
[29:51] imagination what it was like to be
[29:53] scared and never came into his minor
[29:56] imagination what it would be like to be
[29:58] afraid of the very God he loved but yet
[30:01] we understand son came into the picture
[30:03] and and
[30:05] suddenly man had a bunch of emotions
[30:08] they had never experienced before and we
[30:10] see that the very God that came to help
[30:13] him that same one they were scared off
[30:16] because we it's incredible the one that
[30:19] could deliver them from this situation
[30:21] here there were he was God over the
[30:23] earth God had made him bus and he had
[30:25] fallen and the only one who could
[30:26] restore him back to that position was
[30:28] looking for him in the garden the only
[30:30] one that could help him was looking for
[30:32] him in the garden and he was afraid of
[30:33] him amen it sounds a bit crazy but this
[30:37] is man's condition man's condition is
[30:39] always afraid of the one that can help
[30:41] them man's condition as always they try
[30:45] and do it themselves and we understand
[30:47] if you read that whole chapter three
[30:48] they sewed fig leaves together they made
[30:51] aprons and they cover their sin and we
[30:53] understand a religion as a covering I
[30:56] meant they made their own religion and
[30:59] it was covering there very soon and they
[31:01] thought they will find until the very
[31:04] God that made them came into the image
[31:06] and they recognize that their own
[31:08] ability did not cover or undo what had
[31:11] happened and they were afraid of the one
[31:14] that could fix the problem
[31:15] it's incredible how you say well what is
[31:19] this what does this got to do with me in
[31:22] my situation
[31:23] very simple many times we were afraid
[31:27] we're afraid of God hey with me I know
[31:31] it's a wednesday no there's not many of
[31:32] us here but many times we were afraid of
[31:34] the god that can help us
[31:36] amen because you know God wants to take
[31:40] all fear away from his children he wants
[31:44] to totally annihilate any
[31:46] instance of fear or being afraid of the
[31:49] God that can help you because Adam knew
[31:52] that God was a man of God of his word
[31:56] and he said the day the ether of the day
[31:58] you shall die and he understood that and
[32:02] so he was afraid that the God that made
[32:05] him now was what could have destroyed
[32:07] them but he did not understand that man
[32:11] was a part of God if you're a son or
[32:14] daughter of god you're a part of him
[32:16] just like your natural children are a
[32:18] part of your parents and your children
[32:21] are part of your parents you cannot
[32:23] disown your parents in any way you know
[32:25] that could that it could be actually
[32:28] proven that you don't come out of them
[32:29] it's impossible they take a blood test
[32:31] you take a blood test DNA matches I
[32:34] meant out of 7 billion people in the
[32:37] world however many percent you know of
[32:40] the age bracket of childbearing age and
[32:42] male and female you could not be matched
[32:45] to another parent
[32:46] amen if you took the day DNA of every
[32:49] parent upon the earth the match would be
[32:52] perfect and you could not deny your
[32:54] parents and your parents could not deny
[32:55] you they could say no they're not my
[32:58] children but the blood evidence proves
[33:00] that you are related and the blood
[33:02] evidence proves that you are their
[33:04] offspring I mean you cannot you cannot
[33:07] in any way change the evidence and Adam
[33:10] when he fell he forgot that he came out
[33:12] of God I mean when he fell from his
[33:15] position he forgot that he was part of
[33:17] the very God that was walking down among
[33:19] them hearing the voice in the garden and
[33:21] he was afraid and now here we come and
[33:24] we're born in sin shaped iniquity come
[33:26] to the world speaking lies and we have
[33:28] no idea where we're from we have no idea
[33:30] you know we think this is my culture
[33:32] this is my nation this is maybe the
[33:34] church I go to this is what I believe
[33:36] but then when God comes upon the scene
[33:38] and he opens your eyes that is more than
[33:41] just a mental understanding i come from
[33:43] God I go back to God but it comes a
[33:45] revelation into your soul I come from
[33:48] God and I go back to God because I'm a
[33:50] part of God
[33:52] amen so and that now should take all
[33:55] fear away
[33:57] because God does not want you to be
[33:59] afraid of him God does not want you to
[34:02] be scared of him doesn't matter what
[34:04] condition urine he does not want you to
[34:07] be afraid
[34:08] but the greatest tool the devil uses us
[34:11] fear and brother Brown says the greatest
[34:14] paralysis and the church today is fear
[34:18] amen that man is afraid of
[34:22] the very god they worship
[34:26] down Israel in the church part 1
[34:29] this has been the greatest thing I found
[34:32] among Christian people throughout the
[34:33] entire world has been affair
[34:35] they're always afraid when a little
[34:39] sickness strikes they're afraid many I
[34:41] wonder sometimes and now I'm along with
[34:44] you but now what I'm trying to do
[34:46] tonight and in this week to come as try
[34:48] to drive that fear away by God's Word
[34:52] now you would come to me and say well
[34:55] brother BAM I believe this now I believe
[34:56] that there's only one way in the world
[34:58] to proof now I can't go by somebody's
[35:01] experience somebody's church ritual
[35:03] there's only one proof of what it's all
[35:07] about that's God's Word now if God's
[35:09] words here's a certain thing then I've
[35:11] got to believe that that is the truth I
[35:16] want to leave that quote there I wish I
[35:18] put it up but you must understand the
[35:22] devil remember God wants you to know who
[35:25] you are
[35:26] amen your homework for the rest of the
[35:29] week is to listen to who is this
[35:30] Melchizedek
[35:31] you must listen to the service before
[35:33] sunday because I'm going to go on to
[35:35] some things and I trust it just a blur
[35:37] I'm going to just lay a bit of a
[35:38] foundation kind of tonight but I want
[35:41] you to really listen to it because I
[35:45] want you to see well I trust the Holy
[35:46] Spirit rule will reveal to you who you
[35:49] are and it will destroy all fear doesn't
[35:52] matter if you're on the mountain or if
[35:54] you're in the valley you are victorious
[35:57] over everything all the mind battles are
[36:00] wearing you down it's irrelevant
[36:03] amen you must see who you are and it'll
[36:06] take out all the fear
[36:08] just a simple just a simple fact that we
[36:12] are the children of the Lord
[36:15] amen should take all the fear away Adam
[36:19] was afraid now I just want to I want to
[36:21] keep my marquee I want to come back to
[36:23] this quote but now this word afraid and
[36:26] that they're really bound Genesis
[36:29] was to fear it means it means to revere
[36:34] it's a course to be frightened to be
[36:37] made afraid to be fearful so they were
[36:40] fearful of
[36:42] the very of the very God made them
[36:47] now job I
[36:49] want to just go into I distrust I hope
[36:53] this all comes together in but now Adam
[36:56] and Adam was afraid because he was in a
[36:59] fallen state but he is still a son of
[37:01] God
[37:02] but here's it but he forgot that fact he
[37:05] was afraid that because he had fallen
[37:07] God was going to destroy him but God
[37:09] can't destroy his children all that the
[37:11] father has given me Jesus had already
[37:14] given me will you know all that the
[37:17] father has given me a
[37:19] mine I can't mean to the scripture
[37:22] verbatim and all that country or no wise
[37:24] cast out
[37:25] amen so he's saying they already been
[37:29] given and they're going to come to me
[37:31] and all that country I'll no wise cast
[37:33] out a mean so Jesus already has a set
[37:37] number
[37:39] and he's not going to lose one
[37:41] none of God's children are going to be
[37:44] lost it's impossible they cannot be lost
[37:47] you cannot be lost
[37:49] amen it's impossible you cannot go down
[37:52] in defeat
[37:53] now remember victory and circumstance
[37:56] are two different things
[37:58] victory is I've been redeemed by the
[38:00] blood of lamb nothing's held against me
[38:02] in this world of the next that's victory
[38:05] jesus paid it all and I receive it
[38:09] amen someone say hallelujah amen you've
[38:13] got to push this home come on friends
[38:14] we're gonna have church tonight amen we
[38:17] got understand that is victory there's
[38:19] nothing held that there's no evidence
[38:21] against you it's been annihilated it's
[38:24] been washed by the blood lamb the enemy
[38:26] has no evidence against you I mean you
[38:28] never did in the first place you
[38:30] justified the first place is God's mind
[38:32] when he thought of you amen but this
[38:35] message came for you to realize you
[38:37] never did it in the first place as for
[38:39] you to realize that you're justified in
[38:40] God's mind before the foundation of the
[38:42] world when he thought of you he didn't
[38:44] think of your struggles and your mind
[38:46] battles and the sin you're born with and
[38:48] what every that you're carrying he
[38:50] didn't think of you that way he saw you
[38:52] redeemed mature made his image washed in
[38:56] his blood hallelujah virtuous righteous
[38:59] bright of Christ that's how he saw you
[39:02] and he wants you to know that I mean he
[39:05] wants you to recognize who you are and
[39:07] so joke so Adam forgot just because he
[39:11] had fallen he forgot now God is going to
[39:13] destroy them but God could not destroy
[39:15] them that's why he brought in Redemption
[39:17] and he gave them the promise the seed of
[39:19] the woman is going to bruise the head of
[39:21] the seed of the serpent hallelujah in
[39:23] other words i'm going to come and flesh
[39:24] and i'm going to undo everything that
[39:26] just happened this day and he didn't
[39:28] just speak it in words he covered them
[39:30] in lambskins hallelujah pointing to the
[39:32] redeemer coming and he covered this
[39:34] covered their sin
[39:37] hallelujah so they had evidence they had
[39:40] evidence that their sin was going to be
[39:42] done away with and now the Bride of
[39:44] Christ has evidence hallelujah the bride
[39:47] has the Holy Ghost I mean has concrete
[39:50] evidence
[39:51] hallelujah that your sins been taken
[39:53] care of we're not looking forward to
[39:55] them coming we're looking back thanking
[39:57] him buddy did come amen and now you
[39:59] individually have evidence God is alive
[40:01] God is real God has transformed me God
[40:04] dwells in me by His Holy Spirit amen
[40:07] you have evidence
[40:10] hallelujah they're lambskins eventually
[40:13] if they didn't look after them the
[40:14] leather gets hard and cracked and you
[40:17] got to replace it
[40:19] the Holy Ghost doesn't get old cracked
[40:21] and need replacing
[40:23] Alleluia
[40:25] now job
[40:28] so as I said
[40:31] victory is different to circumstance
[40:34] we can just go to Hebrews chapter 11
[40:37] alicious go to
[40:38] Hebrews 11 very quickly
[40:42] and I want to read this
[40:46] because
[40:48] many times we think of victory as
[40:52] everything goes fine there's no mind
[40:55] battles even near you you victorious
[40:57] over everything there's no hardship
[41:00] there's no struggles you just crest
[41:02] every wave
[41:04] amen people think oh if I if I the Holy
[41:08] Ghost or if I see the devil tries to
[41:11] make you doubt your experience he tries
[41:13] to make you doubt what you have and he
[41:16] comes along and says well if you really
[41:17] had the Holy Ghost you would Crist every
[41:19] year just to feed every enemy you'd
[41:21] never have a hardship you never ever
[41:22] mind battle you'd never fall
[41:25] amen remember there's sin unbelief but
[41:28] this little sin which are things you do
[41:32] and we sent every day we must make
[41:35] mistakes every day but if the life of
[41:37] God is in you you won't continue down
[41:38] that way Donald director you know
[41:40] something he found the Dubs flan
[41:42] somewhere I mean like brother been told
[41:45] i think dawson Riley or I think I got
[41:49] his name right either the father all the
[41:51] saints like the holy ghost grieving the
[41:53] Holy Ghost is like he's like a dove it
[41:55] flies up into the rafters doesn't mean
[41:57] you're not sealed doesn't mean you're
[41:58] lost but he just waits there then you
[42:00] repent and make a right then he comes
[42:01] back again
[42:03] amen as possible to grieve the Holy go
[42:06] that doesn't mean you're not safe that
[42:08] doesn't mean you're not redeemed because
[42:11] remember we still live in these bodies
[42:13] and so wait you're here we were now
[42:19] let's go to verse 36 because many times
[42:22] we love to read no this is brief in
[42:24] verse 32 and what shall I more say for
[42:29] the time would fail me to tell of Gideon
[42:30] at a barrack and of Samson and of Jeff
[42:34] thee and of David and Samuel on of the
[42:36] prophets who through faith subdued
[42:38] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[42:40] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[42:41] quenched the violence of fire escape
[42:43] edge of the sword out of weakness was
[42:45] made strong way expelling in the fight
[42:46] turned the flight of the armies of the
[42:48] aliens woman received their dead race to
[42:50] life again the others were okay let's
[42:52] stop there that sounds that sounds
[42:55] incredible like Rambo coming and just
[42:57] gunning down everyone doesn't it that
[43:01] sounds pretty spectacular and many times
[43:03] we think now that's a hero of faith
[43:05] hey I'll just say a min for me that's
[43:08] right Amen
[43:10] but now
[43:11] others now this is the other side
[43:15] others were tortured not
[43:18] accepting deliverance that they might
[43:21] obtain a bit of resurrection and others
[43:24] had trial of cruel mocking and scourging
[43:27] 'he's yay MERVA of bonds and
[43:30] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[43:32] sawn asunder were tempted were slain
[43:35] with the sword saw they wandered about
[43:37] in sheepskins and goatskins being
[43:39] destitute afflicted
[43:41] tormented
[43:43] now that doesn't sound
[43:46] now now I understand why didn't you see
[43:49] her here big Universal hallelujah
[43:52] because that doesn't sound that
[43:54] glamorous but these are the heroes of
[43:56] the faith these are people like you who
[43:59] overcame in their age I mean these are
[44:02] the ones that didn't fear
[44:04] and whether you like it or not we are
[44:08] part of this number
[44:10] amen so someone who's destitute
[44:13] afflicted and tormented and in my margin
[44:17] tormented there means evil treated you
[44:20] know those that were they had trial of
[44:22] cruel mocking and scourging and so on
[44:26] that's that that's the believer
[44:30] their circumstances then does not sound
[44:34] all that glamorous
[44:35] yes you with me their circumstances are
[44:39] not sound that glamorous but many times
[44:42] we we don't differentiate victory to
[44:47] situation
[44:49] amen because if we look at situation one
[44:53] day we're having a glorious time next
[44:55] day it's getting hard and we're not
[44:56] doing all something's wrong nothing's
[44:58] wrong everything's running smoothly
[45:00] God's programs running perfectly just
[45:03] right but you got to look at the
[45:04] difference between your situation in
[45:06] your victory
[45:07] amen there's a brother in Canada is in
[45:11] the police force he lost everything is
[45:14] depressed he was down his life had
[45:16] fallen apart is a believer I
[45:19] think I come in but he lost his family
[45:21] or what happened but he was at the
[45:22] lowest part of his life and then this
[45:25] woman that was working the police force
[45:27] just came in maybe work in the same
[45:30] office I can't member the details but
[45:32] she said I see God in you what do you
[45:35] believe she had traveled to India she
[45:38] had been all around the world looking
[45:40] for something real and here was a
[45:43] believer in the last part of his life it
[45:45] says I see God in you and then he took
[45:50] her to the church and she says no I see
[45:53] God in everyone and she became a
[45:55] believer
[45:56] amen the situation was terrible but his
[46:01] victory was victorious
[46:03] amen now if you now if we could go back
[46:06] to that brother's life and talk to him
[46:09] at that moment how are you feeling when
[46:11] you effectively lead that sister to the
[46:13] Lord he would have said brother I had
[46:15] such a prayer before hand and God just
[46:17] came down and everything was going
[46:18] perfect and the wood was just opening us
[46:21] shouting and rejoicing and everything
[46:22] was going well it's say I hate it I
[46:25] hated my life at that point if he has on
[46:27] us do you see I hate I hated waking up
[46:30] that morning and wake up saying I'm
[46:32] still in this trial
[46:34] hello that was the situation it wasn't
[46:37] as his victory
[46:40] amen now it's not always like that you
[46:43] must understand but I'm trying to get
[46:45] you to see it doesn't matter what
[46:46] condition you find yourself in a min if
[46:49] you have the victor you have the victory
[46:51] it is what it is
[46:54] amen so don't
[46:56] never mix the two because that's when
[47:00] the mind battles come is when the hard
[47:01] hard times come and then the devil can
[47:04] get you think well maybe I'm maybe I'm
[47:06] not where I think I am
[47:09] amen
[47:10] never take never belittle what God has
[47:15] done for you I
[47:17] meant never let him belittle it
[47:20] because if he can do that in then the
[47:22] mine battles begin to win
[47:24] Amen
[47:26] hallelujah
[47:28] now
[47:31] job
[47:34] God's testimony of his servant job was
[47:37] this is a perfect man
[47:39] there's none like him in all the earth I
[47:41] don't know how many million people were
[47:43] upon the earth at that time but there's
[47:45] one without without equal without equal
[47:48] upon the earth that was Joe
[47:51] was it not let's read it in job chapter
[47:54] one
[48:08] remember this is you you you I I trust
[48:11] us help someone I
[48:14] say God destroy the fear
[48:17] there should be no more fear
[48:19] amen
[48:22] because ultimately we're not afraid of
[48:25] the devil
[48:26] we're afraid of the Lord
[48:29] amen ultimately because you don't walk
[48:31] before the devil but you work for the
[48:33] Lord you want to please him so you don't
[48:36] care what he says ultimately you care
[48:37] what does the Lord think of me and so
[48:40] the devil can get you to be afraid of
[48:41] God then that's where the trouble comes
[48:44] up
[48:46] amen his joke there was a man in the
[48:49] land of
[48:51] us thank you whose name was job and that
[48:55] man was perfect and upright and the 11
[49:00] that fed God and
[49:02] eschewed evil that fear is I believe
[49:04] it's a reverential fear not a thing in
[49:08] being terrified
[49:11] so
[49:12] let's go down to and
[49:16] there was born unto him seven sons and
[49:18] three daughters now this has dropped
[49:21] down to seven and eight this is where so
[49:24] this is this is job jobs divine
[49:27] commentary perfect man upright one that
[49:30] fed God and eschewed evil and
[49:32] then Satan goes up before the Lord and
[49:35] the Lord points his finger down to job
[49:38] well this is read verse 7 and the Lord
[49:41] said under Satan wits come us now then
[49:43] Satan answered the Lord and said from
[49:44] going to and fro on the earth and
[49:46] walking up and down in it and the Lord
[49:48] said unto Satan has thou considered my
[49:51] servant job
[49:53] now I know I've said these things many
[49:56] times before but I want to sink in have
[49:58] you considered my servant job there's
[50:00] none like them in the earth a perfect
[50:01] and upright man one that feareth god and
[50:04] ask you earth evil and then and then
[50:08] then they have the discourse after that
[50:10] but see this is god this is what God
[50:12] thought of joke
[50:13] this was God's testimony you know when
[50:16] we think of a brother assist from the
[50:17] church would say you know someone you
[50:19] admire you say what a what a model
[50:21] believe such an encouragement and the
[50:23] hard times just the Lord just you you're
[50:25] such a great example of what you know of
[50:29] God's grace and God looks down and he
[50:31] sees his servant job memek God sees all
[50:34] things any any calls things exactly as
[50:37] they are he doesn't elaborate he doesn't
[50:40] exaggerate he doesn't diminish he just
[50:42] says exactly exactly as he says that
[50:45] thats how it is and so here's a perfect
[50:48] man but Joe had fear
[50:52] because he didn't understand who he
[50:54] wasn't got a meant he had fear because
[50:58] we're it there that job had seven sons
[51:00] and three daughters and job himself
[51:03] would say and job through 25 for the
[51:07] thing which I greatly feared has come
[51:08] upon me and that which I was afraid of
[51:11] is come unto me and
[51:14] that was his family died he did
[51:17] initially care about his flocks remember
[51:19] one of the things one of his Clemmie T's
[51:21] was all of his children in a house and
[51:23] the house fell upon them and they all
[51:25] died and he sacrificed every time they
[51:30] you know your heat heat he offered a
[51:32] lamb on their behalf
[51:33] continually a mint but he was he was he
[51:38] was giving the sacrifice out of fear
[51:43] instead of confidence he was motivated
[51:47] by fear and stead of confidence that the
[51:50] lamb works
[51:51] they meant as part of his life was
[51:54] dictated to by fear and he said the
[51:57] thing that he feared came upon him and
[52:00] you got to be careful because there's
[52:03] power on the tongue there's power in the
[52:06] tongue so the things that you fear and
[52:08] you express they will materialize
[52:10] because you begin to believe your fear I
[52:14] meant you begin to leave your fear
[52:16] instead of believing the word of God
[52:18] that's why the things you fear you know
[52:22] don't let it
[52:23] grip you in such a way that you begin to
[52:26] believe your fears
[52:28] amen because as soon as fear comes into
[52:31] the equation you got to kick it out cuz
[52:34] fear
[52:35] torment and torment and fear is not of
[52:38] God because this word fear and hearing
[52:41] job that means to be startled by a
[52:44] sudden alarms as I just shocks you
[52:48] hence to fear and general be afraid
[52:51] standing or being fair to make shake the
[52:56] same startled startle them there's what
[52:58] he is afraid of what if this happened
[53:00] what if my children died lost not under
[53:03] the blood is living in fear and it's
[53:06] fear now they were under the blood
[53:08] because he offered the lamb on their
[53:10] behalf he was being a good parent
[53:14] amen but he did it out of fear
[53:18] instead of out of confidence I
[53:21] want you to think about this what he
[53:24] feared came to pass
[53:26] because he believed his fear and he
[53:29] spoken
[53:30] and if the devil can make you fear it
[53:33] disarms your faith either your faith
[53:37] will paralyze the fear the devil tries
[53:39] to put upon you or your fear will
[53:40] paralyze your faith that all the Pens
[53:43] who you're listening to just because job
[53:46] had fear here still perfect man remember
[53:49] victory conditions I
[53:52] meant his condition was I'm afraid for
[53:55] my children he was looking at situation
[53:58] because they were feasting and things go
[54:00] from house to house is worried what if
[54:01] they do something evil what if I do
[54:03] something against the Lord that he was
[54:05] afraid of the what could be that's why
[54:09] the imagination can be such a glorious
[54:11] thing but such a curse because Satan
[54:14] push that button here's the what could
[54:15] be comes out on the big screen 4k video
[54:19] I've never I don't know you know I
[54:21] definition or even virtual reality now
[54:24] become so alive and real and it gets is
[54:27] the what could be and it's never good a
[54:30] menace never it's never the you're going
[54:32] to take a body change and all your
[54:34] family will come in and God's just in
[54:36] you and we have glorious church times
[54:39] and prayer times at home and witnessing
[54:40] in the hole it's never that kind of
[54:42] imagination it's this is going to go
[54:45] wrong and you see what's already
[54:47] happening because this is going to
[54:48] happen and this is what you did and this
[54:50] is this and God's not really real and
[54:51] doesn't really love you and if you
[54:53] really loved you this wouldn't happen
[54:54] and you know all these kind of things go
[54:55] on and he's a consuming fire and he's
[54:58] also a god of Wrath even though he's a
[54:59] God of love but he's a god of Wrath and
[55:01] he's going to punish you for what you
[55:02] did and all the figures
[55:03] do-do-do-do-do-do-do down like this
[55:06] I'm just talking about myself but you
[55:08] know what I mean this is what happened
[55:11] and
[55:12] you go so you got to think now when
[55:14] something comes into your mind you think
[55:17] what's motivating this and where's
[55:19] really the conclusion i
[55:21] meant as the as the conclusion joy love
[55:26] peace long-suffering something that
[55:29] comforts you something that guides you
[55:31] something that settles you something
[55:33] that increases your faith or your love
[55:35] for God or is it fear
[55:41] so we have to
[55:44] what job feared came upon him
[55:47] because he was looking at circumstance
[55:50] and the what could be
[55:53] amen he was applying he was killing now
[55:58] this is just me but he was sacrificing
[55:59] for his children out of fear
[56:01] they meant instead of applying the token
[56:04] and confidence
[56:06] amen
[56:09] but God now
[56:12] God had to come to job and
[56:16] he cuz job didn't understand here he is
[56:19] a perfect man without without peer and
[56:22] he didn't even know that he thought was
[56:25] just regular Joe Bloggs they love the
[56:27] Lord people came to him you know ask
[56:30] them for advice is blessed financially
[56:33] all these things are going well and he
[56:37] attributed all that to the Lord but he's
[56:40] really forgot what he was he didn't even
[56:42] know what he was he didn't even know
[56:43] where should his last breath levers lips
[56:46] where he was going to go and then the
[56:50] whole trial happened because God came
[56:53] down to him spoke to him in a whirlwind
[56:54] I want you to see something's job
[56:58] this ties into milk is attackin Abraham
[57:02] I mean Jesus came who was Melchizedek
[57:04] made flesh
[57:06] the communion I'm just going to drop a
[57:08] few things in for Sunday the communion
[57:10] that symbolizes God giving a part of
[57:13] himself to you
[57:14] the bread and the wine he's giving a
[57:18] part of himself to you because he wants
[57:21] you to be where he is and now
[57:26] Melchizedek other branches wasn't a
[57:28] theophany body and
[57:30] Paul says if this tabernacle be
[57:35] dissolved I've one waiting already
[57:38] eternal in the heavens
[57:39] so God had to come down in time
[57:43] to link us without the off anybody
[57:47] okay now i'm going to go into this on
[57:50] sunday but this all I just a little just
[57:53] anointed in such a way that you'll just
[57:55] be fearless walking out of this place
[57:57] they meant so God God comes and he gives
[58:01] us would which is himself to you and it
[58:04] anchors into your soul because he wants
[58:07] you to recognize I have a body in the
[58:09] heavens
[58:10] amen there's a part of me waiting if I
[58:16] leave this body I have an eternal one
[58:18] and this message has come for you to
[58:21] recognize you have a body waiting if we
[58:24] all if this whole work building was
[58:26] vaporized right now we're step into that
[58:29] glorified into that theophany body so I
[58:32] don't want to mix it too but you know we
[58:34] have a body waiting
[58:35] we have a body waiting and God has come
[58:39] this way that's why God came to job what
[58:41] a job say after the great trial now i
[58:44] know my Redeemer liveth and with these
[58:46] eyes I'll see him and in the last hour
[58:48] stand upon the earth with them that's
[58:50] not verbatim what he said but that's
[58:51] what he said he said with these eyes
[58:54] I'll see God and other skin was a sort
[58:57] you know destroy this flesh with these
[58:58] eyes I'll see God he says I know my
[59:01] Redeemer liveth he didn't didn't know
[59:02] anything about a redeemer Erie chapter
[59:05] you're the first part of job he didn't
[59:06] know anything about Redemption I think
[59:08] God came to him
[59:11] amen where were you job
[59:14] when the stars of you know sons of gods
[59:17] that your shadow for joy and all these
[59:18] things the foundation of the earth was
[59:19] later where were you and God is trying
[59:23] to get job to see you there
[59:25] you were there shouting you're there
[59:28] victorious you're there shouting and
[59:31] praising me and now I saw that an
[59:34] eternity but now I want it to be
[59:36] expressed at the time that your
[59:39] condition before the world began would
[59:41] be manifested in flesh upon the earth
[59:43] hallelujah and that's why job now he
[59:46] could say there's more to this world
[59:47] than this I have a Redeemer amen
[59:52] so now he can see job and that to halt
[59:56] the fair away because he had questions
[59:58] and if the devil puts a question in your
[1:00:01] heart it's fair voice fear involved
[1:00:03] how do you know you have the Holy Ghost
[1:00:06] how do you know you're going in a
[1:00:08] rapture but he puts a question there and
[1:00:12] there's always fear attached to their
[1:00:14] question how do you know you're going to
[1:00:17] get well how do you know this is not
[1:00:19] going to take your life
[1:00:20] there's a question there's my brother
[1:00:22] brown me know put out the book do you
[1:00:24] fear cancer shouldn't fear cancer but
[1:00:26] his fear always associated with cancer
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:32] now
[1:00:35] going back to the quote I want to be
[1:00:38] much longer
[1:00:39] recently deals a young minister came to
[1:00:42] me and told me of a certain situation
[1:00:44] said he prayed over it and he said the
[1:00:46] Lord revealed to him that it was a
[1:00:48] certain way now when i read this really
[1:00:52] think no i just read it and I looked at
[1:00:54] them a little bit and said brother
[1:00:55] that's very lovely I appreciate the Lord
[1:00:58] doing that for you but let me tell you
[1:01:02] something its contrary he said well the
[1:01:05] vision came from God I said it couldn't
[1:01:07] have rather because it was contrary to
[1:01:09] the word now we must prove all things by
[1:01:13] the scripture if it's contrary to my
[1:01:15] faith and yet the scripture says so the
[1:01:18] scriptures right and I'm wrong see the
[1:01:21] scriptures always right and the only way
[1:01:23] you can do anything is come back to the
[1:01:25] scripture it says now is that true I
[1:01:28] like to hear you say Amen when you
[1:01:30] believe it you see so now this is us the
[1:01:35] devil comes to you and
[1:01:38] you have mine battles and you're
[1:01:41] wrestling something and the conclusion
[1:01:44] of voices argument is you're not right
[1:01:46] with God
[1:01:48] amen this is this is some of the matter
[1:01:50] and if you agree with him now he says if
[1:01:56] your faith if my faith is contrary to
[1:01:58] the scripture the scripture is right and
[1:02:00] I'm wrong
[1:02:01] so if you begin to believe you're not
[1:02:05] right with God then that's your faith
[1:02:07] because you believe it but you have to
[1:02:10] take it back to what does the scripture
[1:02:12] say about me
[1:02:14] what does the word say about me not what
[1:02:17] I feel about me says about me what does
[1:02:20] the word say about me
[1:02:22] amen are you following me because that's
[1:02:25] why he says the scripture is always
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:29] amen and
[1:02:31] so if the scripture says repent and be
[1:02:36] baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:02:38] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:02:40] receive to the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:41] for the promise under you and to your
[1:02:43] children those that are far off Evans
[1:02:44] meetings the Lord our God shall call is
[1:02:46] that right that's right who's ever call
[1:02:50] you know who's ever calls upon the name
[1:02:53] of Lord shall be saved in Romans chapter
[1:02:56] 10 says how can you hear on this is a
[1:02:58] preacher sent now going to be be sent
[1:03:00] unless he's been ordained to be sentient
[1:03:02] you know all those things so there's a
[1:03:03] there's a program God and God sends a
[1:03:06] minister and he anoints that ministry
[1:03:07] and he speaks through that ministry then
[1:03:09] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:03:11] Word of God and then you can call upon
[1:03:12] the name of Lord because God is working
[1:03:15] in the soul you say lord save me it's
[1:03:17] already been done on calorie but then
[1:03:18] you accept it
[1:03:20] amen and then you come God's provided
[1:03:24] way
[1:03:25] yeah and what does that mean now so so
[1:03:29] remember when Jesus died it was wiping
[1:03:32] your sin debt past present and future
[1:03:34] soon
[1:03:35] amen did he not he didn't have to die
[1:03:38] again he didn't have to shed any more
[1:03:39] blood again by one offering
[1:03:41] he has perfected them forever that a
[1:03:43] sanctified the scripture says so if he
[1:03:46] did that now and then here you are two
[1:03:48] thousand years down the road and God
[1:03:51] send a messenger to the age revealed the
[1:03:53] light of the word to him that same
[1:03:55] anointing comes upon a ministry and then
[1:03:57] you hear the words of that ministry and
[1:03:59] the Bible becomes alive to you amen and
[1:04:02] it changes your life see the devil
[1:04:04] doesn't like to remember the time he got
[1:04:05] defeated in your life the devil doesn't
[1:04:07] like to remind you the time smoking or
[1:04:10] whatever the world or drinking or
[1:04:12] whatever was was cast out of you the
[1:04:14] devil doesn't like to remind you of the
[1:04:16] fact one day he was on your throne he
[1:04:19] used to be upon the throne of your heart
[1:04:20] but then he got dethroned and the king
[1:04:23] of kings came in that's what the gospel
[1:04:25] is to do is to dethrone Satan wherever
[1:04:28] he he you know whoever will listen and
[1:04:30] God come upon the throne of the heart
[1:04:32] halloo you talk about a coup a min but
[1:04:36] really it's a Redemption it's a
[1:04:37] restoration of the human soul back into
[1:04:39] its right condition the devil doesn't
[1:04:41] like to be reminders days he always
[1:04:45] tries to sweep it under the carpet yeah
[1:04:47] amen but if God has done that for you
[1:04:52] if God has done that for you then you
[1:04:55] need to look into the scripture and say
[1:04:56] what does God say about me
[1:05:00] all right
[1:05:03] let's go to first John one
[1:05:11] I'm trying to
[1:05:13] let's just read this
[1:05:22] first John one
[1:05:27] he says this then verse 5 the sin is the
[1:05:29] message which I have heard of him and
[1:05:31] declare unto you that God is light and
[1:05:33] in him is no darkness at all if we say
[1:05:35] that we have fellowship with him and
[1:05:37] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[1:05:38] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[1:05:40] is in the light we have fellowship one
[1:05:42] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ His Son cleanses us from say the
[1:05:46] next word
[1:05:47] sin all sin all
[1:05:51] what does all mean the entirety of it
[1:05:54] the whole amount of it not most of it
[1:05:57] not some of it not a little bit of it
[1:05:59] all
[1:06:00] soon okay
[1:06:04] if we say we have no sin we deceive
[1:06:07] ourselves and the truth is not in US if
[1:06:09] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[1:06:11] just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:06:13] cleanse us from
[1:06:15] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:06:18] not sinned we make him a liar in his
[1:06:20] word is not enough my little children
[1:06:23] these things are right into that you
[1:06:25] said not and if any man sin we have an
[1:06:27] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[1:06:30] the righteous and he is a propitiation
[1:06:32] for our sins and not our not ours only
[1:06:35] but also for the sins of the whole world
[1:06:40] amen put that on your fridge
[1:06:43] put that on your fridge see we have to
[1:06:45] because remember if there's sin or if
[1:06:47] there's a question of sin this fear
[1:06:49] because all the devil dad tries to
[1:06:52] dangle men be used to do this and you
[1:06:53] did this and it's so real when you win
[1:06:55] it when it flashes back
[1:06:57] sometimes a min and he dangles these
[1:07:01] things of what happens what happens fear
[1:07:03] tries to come
[1:07:06] but little children we should not fear
[1:07:11] amen because if he has cleanse us from
[1:07:13] all sin and if we confess our sins he is
[1:07:16] faithful and just to forgive forgive
[1:07:18] forgive us of our sins is that right
[1:07:22] that's what the scripture says so you
[1:07:23] got to take your faith if your faith is
[1:07:25] contrary to the to the word then you
[1:07:29] forget your faith and you take what the
[1:07:30] scripture says about you now
[1:07:37] in closing I
[1:07:40] want to say one of the enemies in the
[1:07:43] land I
[1:07:44] can find it
[1:07:50] one of the enemies in the land was the
[1:07:52] Hittites now I may get us mixed up with
[1:07:54] another one but it means terror
[1:07:56] terror which is
[1:08:00] greater thing than fear but that was
[1:08:03] that was what their that's what the
[1:08:04] country meant was terror he was terror
[1:08:07] in the promised land and these lights
[1:08:10] had to come in and they had to conquer
[1:08:11] that terror I mean they had to overcome
[1:08:15] that terror that was part of the
[1:08:17] inheritance they had to overcome it so
[1:08:20] there's a fear so that's why you say why
[1:08:22] is the affair try to come in because
[1:08:24] there's an enemy and he's trying to
[1:08:26] battle against you remember it's satanic
[1:08:29] power as trying to hold you back with
[1:08:31] fear or terror
[1:08:33] you have to defeat that thing
[1:08:36] amen you have to overcome those things
[1:08:38] because we must understand we get sealed
[1:08:42] into the kingdom but then there's a
[1:08:43] victory to have these are full
[1:08:45] inheritance to possess and just because
[1:08:47] we may fall or fail we'll have all these
[1:08:49] mind battles it doesn't mean we're not
[1:08:51] in the land
[1:08:52] amen you got to take God at his work
[1:08:54] I've repented I've been baptized I've
[1:08:57] been sealed with the Holy Spirit I
[1:09:00] meant that's God's condition you're in
[1:09:02] the land you can't come out of the land
[1:09:04] you're in the land
[1:09:05] amen but then is there's this land to
[1:09:08] possess these things to overcome and one
[1:09:11] of those things is fear
[1:09:14] but if we understand I don't want to be
[1:09:18] too long I'll just maybe just wrap it up
[1:09:19] with this job was afraid Adam was afraid
[1:09:24] it was a man who had perfect fellowship
[1:09:26] with God and sin came in and now he was
[1:09:28] afraid
[1:09:29] then but remember it's just like the
[1:09:32] disciples on the boat she God comes into
[1:09:35] the into the garden and the very one
[1:09:39] that can help Adam and Eve in their
[1:09:41] predicament they're afraid of and they
[1:09:43] try and hide from and it's the same
[1:09:46] thing friends today don't be afraid
[1:09:49] why does God he doesn't come for
[1:09:52] destruction
[1:09:53] he doesn't come for destruction he comes
[1:09:56] to his children for deliverance I
[1:09:59] meant if you believe your gods child who
[1:10:02] believes their gods child
[1:10:04] amen if you believe your gods child God
[1:10:08] will only come to you for deliverance
[1:10:10] what about chastisement everything that
[1:10:12] is correction with your best intention
[1:10:15] and mind and the reason that it doesn't
[1:10:18] is to deliver you from doing it again
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:23] so God always why did God come to Adam
[1:10:26] and Eve I want to deliver you from those
[1:10:27] fig leaves I want to give you a promise
[1:10:31] that I'm going to undo these things why
[1:10:34] did God come to Moses by the burning
[1:10:37] bush yeah I mean I mean in the burning
[1:10:39] bush he didn't want to chastise and say
[1:10:41] why did you run away 40 years you've
[1:10:43] been trying to hydrogen me now was the
[1:10:45] season now deliverances come to my
[1:10:47] children why did he come to Gideon his
[1:10:50] Gideon he's afraid of the enemy he's in
[1:10:52] his own land and he's afraid of the
[1:10:54] enemy is threshing wheat and secret and
[1:10:56] God says member that's a situation how
[1:10:59] does God Sam you're a mighty man of
[1:11:01] Valor
[1:11:02] see how we see our sup now it's not
[1:11:06] being proud you say I was proud to see
[1:11:08] yourself as this virtuous overcoming
[1:11:12] sinless perfect you know bride of Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ that's not proud you got to see
[1:11:19] what God has made you
[1:11:22] Caleb and Joshua they did not see
[1:11:25] themselves as slaves anymore they were
[1:11:27] once slaves but they weren't slaves
[1:11:28] anymore they came a time when the
[1:11:30] slavery was done and they knew they
[1:11:32] weren't slaves they said let's go take
[1:11:33] the land because they saw themselves as
[1:11:35] God saw them but the others still
[1:11:39] they didn't think they'd still be at a
[1:11:41] slave mentality because a slave is never
[1:11:45] greater than the slave as the bottom of
[1:11:47] the room so how can a slave a nation of
[1:11:50] slaves overcome these other kingdoms
[1:11:51] greater than them but Caleb and Joshua
[1:11:54] they knew our God thought of them by
[1:11:56] hearing Moses preach these they they
[1:11:58] understood we have been made a nation of
[1:12:01] kings and priests this is the promised
[1:12:04] land this take it at once
[1:12:07] you know why did it's just all the way
[1:12:10] through the scripture God comes to his
[1:12:12] people to bring deliverance
[1:12:14] don't be afraid of the deliverer
[1:12:17] amen why did God come to this lukewarm
[1:12:21] age to bring deliverance
[1:12:24] amen he didn't come just all he's going
[1:12:26] to smite the earth with a curse why did
[1:12:28] he come before widely why hasn't he been
[1:12:30] spending with a curse yet destroyed
[1:12:32] because his deliverance in the leg God
[1:12:36] sealing away as children taking them out
[1:12:39] of the way then whatever happens after
[1:12:41] that well that's the people's risk
[1:12:45] the people made the choice
[1:12:48] but God sends mercy before he sends
[1:12:50] judgment
[1:12:52] brother Bram's preachers sermon God
[1:12:55] doesn't know God doesn't judge a person
[1:12:58] without warning them first
[1:13:01] amen so deliverance comes and yet we're
[1:13:05] afraid of the deliverance
[1:13:07] because our situation and our condition
[1:13:11] we get mixed up and we think God is
[1:13:15] going to
[1:13:17] deal with us this is the last time we've
[1:13:20] crossed the line too many times he must
[1:13:22] be sick of me and he would have been
[1:13:24] sick of me long time ago if he wasn't
[1:13:25] God but he's God and he can't lose a
[1:13:28] part of himself
[1:13:30] amen just in 29 and I could keep going
[1:13:34] but i wanna i want to stop it there
[1:13:35] you've got to recognize this is you in
[1:13:38] God's image and God's mind
[1:13:40] your revelation needs to match what how
[1:13:43] he sees you and this is why the speak
[1:13:46] you go you go listen to invisible Union
[1:13:49] guys listen to that sermon because he's
[1:13:51] talking about you he's not know when he
[1:13:54] talks about the invisible union of the
[1:13:57] bride and Christ and the bride that's
[1:13:59] been United to the bridegroom he's
[1:14:02] talking about you
[1:14:04] amen I trust when you listen to that
[1:14:07] sermon you say he's talking about me
[1:14:10] amen sinless virtuous never did in the
[1:14:15] first place he put a wedding band of
[1:14:17] premiere predestinated unmerited grace
[1:14:20] on your finger before the foundation of
[1:14:22] the world
[1:14:23] that's what he says I trusted something
[1:14:26] in you says that's me he's talking about
[1:14:29] me all the other stuff and blasting all
[1:14:31] the denomination's whatever I
[1:14:34] trust you come you don't put yourself
[1:14:37] there a
[1:14:38] min I trust you don't you should say
[1:14:42] he's actually talking about me
[1:14:44] amen because it's like what was it
[1:14:49] Elijah Elijah that went to the widow
[1:14:51] woman Elijah
[1:14:53] brother Graham says that there would a
[1:14:55] woman and the Prophet was with the same
[1:14:57] caliber
[1:14:58] the same caliber so God sends a spirit
[1:15:03] of Elijah in the same time to find a
[1:15:06] bride for the Lord and then now remember
[1:15:10] it's the word that comes out of the of
[1:15:13] the Prophet that's Christ yeah the word
[1:15:16] is Christ it comes into your home you
[1:15:19] entertain it you look after you enjoy it
[1:15:23] it comes to you it doesn't come to
[1:15:24] everyone else Elijah only went till
[1:15:26] would a woman there's a Gentile didn't
[1:15:28] go to you nor now see jesus said there's
[1:15:30] many other widows and that day but he
[1:15:33] went outside the land
[1:15:35] because that woman was the same caliber
[1:15:38] as the Prophet a widow woman not some
[1:15:41] queen and a palace a widow woman and she
[1:15:44] said yo yo Elijah comes along and and he
[1:15:47] says he says what are you doing and she
[1:15:50] says well I'm getting two sticks i'm
[1:15:52] going to make a fire i'm going to cook
[1:15:53] this last bit of bread and then i'm
[1:15:55] going to leave my son and I going to die
[1:15:57] this is her condition and he says he
[1:16:02] says now make me one first for thus says
[1:16:04] the Lord the oil will never run out in
[1:16:06] the ER and and and every with the meal
[1:16:08] and all these things this was her
[1:16:10] condition but the Prophet tells us they
[1:16:13] are the same caliber and then Jesus
[1:16:15] comes into your home he comes to you
[1:16:17] there are many other churches in the
[1:16:19] days of Lady ocf
[1:16:21] anybody came to a place like this and
[1:16:26] we received them as he was
[1:16:29] amen and that ended know what does that
[1:16:32] say not making some big I'm not
[1:16:33] stretching it too far but it's actually
[1:16:36] saying now if the message comes to you
[1:16:38] which is Christ you say yes Lord I love
[1:16:41] you I love your word your your word I
[1:16:43] love it above all things I'd rather have
[1:16:46] it than my next breath
[1:16:47] amen what is he saying you and Christ
[1:16:51] are the same caliber
[1:16:53] amen that's not I trust that's not too
[1:16:56] hard to swallow you say yeah but I'm
[1:16:59] struggling and things are hard and I
[1:17:01] don't know I have all these things going
[1:17:02] on
[1:17:03] situation who you really are
[1:17:07] amen I could play stand here for hours
[1:17:10] trying to get that one thing sunk in at
[1:17:14] your situation and your and your your
[1:17:16] victory with God are two separate things
[1:17:19] amen it doesn't matter
[1:17:23] you know people people many times must
[1:17:26] understand and especially when you know
[1:17:31] death is only a travel bus to get us
[1:17:34] where we really want to go
[1:17:35] ok
[1:17:37] that the
[1:17:39] Hebrews 11 says they all died in faith
[1:17:42] not receiving the promise so they all
[1:17:46] died in faith and that is the main thing
[1:17:49] if you go down as long as you go down in
[1:17:51] faith
[1:17:54] member situation who you really are
[1:17:58] if this is not even bought into
[1:18:01] consideration you'll do well you'll be
[1:18:04] you you'll do incredibly well but
[1:18:07] if you bring this into consideration and
[1:18:10] you forget this you won't do so well you
[1:18:14] could be destitute on the street your
[1:18:16] whole world's falling apart your family
[1:18:18] leave you your church leave you your
[1:18:20] friends leave you everyone leave you but
[1:18:23] if you know I'm a son or daughter of god
[1:18:24] you're doing well that's the most
[1:18:26] extreme case you could be on death's
[1:18:28] door
[1:18:29] everything could be have gone wrong if
[1:18:32] you know I know in whom I have believed
[1:18:35] then you're doing very well amen
[1:18:40] we have the musicians to come
[1:18:43] don't fear
[1:18:45] fear not there's a reason why every time
[1:18:49] an angel brother branham when the angel
[1:18:53] came the first time
[1:18:55] the first words that the angel said was
[1:18:58] fear not and the season in interview and
[1:19:01] 20th century properly says and then I
[1:19:03] knew the same voice that had been
[1:19:04] speaking to me all my life was now
[1:19:06] speaking to me first time I've ever seen
[1:19:08] him in physical form
[1:19:09] amen so he was afraid of the voice that
[1:19:14] had always spoken to him and it's the
[1:19:17] same thing with us
[1:19:18] don't fear Jesus is here I mean the same
[1:19:23] one that leads and guides us every day
[1:19:26] that's why Jesus said be not afraid of
[1:19:29] his eye and the angel comes many times
[1:19:33] is fear not I've been seeing for the
[1:19:34] principal mighty God the same amen I
[1:19:42] mean let's just sing that song be still
[1:19:44] let's just stand shall we
[1:19:51] but go go listen or read who is this
[1:19:54] Melchizedek
[1:19:56] and I trust on sunday you'll see
[1:20:01] God has imparted
[1:20:03] he came down why did he die on the cross
[1:20:06] because you have and why did he become
[1:20:09] real why has he come become real to you
[1:20:12] one reason because you have a body to
[1:20:16] step into
[1:20:19] and Weiss communion so special because
[1:20:23] of symbolizing God gives part of himself
[1:20:25] and
[1:20:27] now Jesus maybe I'll
[1:20:32] he should it's symbolizing he gives part
[1:20:35] of himself to fulfill the promise of the
[1:20:37] eight and
[1:20:39] the reason he does that is because why
[1:20:43] you're believer because you have a body
[1:20:45] hmm an eternal body waiting for you
[1:20:51] when you go from this wall to the ning
[1:20:54] that's why you're a believer
[1:20:56] I'm going to expand it on Sunday but I
[1:20:58] trust I just want to drop these things
[1:21:00] in just few to
[1:21:01] ponder why have I been called why do I
[1:21:05] live the life I live why go back over
[1:21:08] your testimony what God has done for you
[1:21:10] why is he done all these things why has
[1:21:13] he sent the word my way why is he what I
[1:21:15] feel his presence and love and want to
[1:21:17] serve them and you know he's more than
[1:21:19] life to me why is that because you have
[1:21:22] a body I mean that though this one be
[1:21:26] dissolved you have one waiting in the
[1:21:27] heavens I
[1:21:29] mean they stand shall we and let's just
[1:21:31] sing this
[1:21:33] I'm
