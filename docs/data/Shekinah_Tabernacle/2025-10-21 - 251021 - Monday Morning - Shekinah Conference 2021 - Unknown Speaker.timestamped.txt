[14:50] and it's a saying that says on a guard
[14:52] and a blaze of glory

[37:52] hey
[38:12] what's
[38:22] cheese
[38:33] amen
[38:36] first of all i think i want to thank the
[38:37] team we literally didn't have much time
[38:40] to practice yesterday
[38:42] i guess they were hearing the two songs
[38:44] for the first time so to say okay this
[38:46] is how i sing the verses this is how i
[38:49] sing the the choruses
[38:51] but they caught on amen so
[38:53] just in case i won't have the time to
[38:56] thank you after this
[38:58] thank you amen
[39:02] when we sing the singer has to be in the
[39:04] same spirit as the people that are
[39:06] begging him
[39:07] so
[39:09] i feel comfortable when the people that
[39:11] are playing catch
[39:13] the way i want the song done
[39:15] if they miss a chord it doesn't sound
[39:18] right you're missing something i want a
[39:20] minor there
[39:22] so we get to travel on the same plane
[39:27] now it takes me back to brother branham
[39:28] i always wonder why god chose brother
[39:30] branham he will explain to me when we
[39:32] get there
[39:34] there were so many educated people in
[39:36] the world billions literally but he
[39:38] chose an uneducated man from kentucky
[39:41] and that an educated man will take his
[39:44] stand on the pulpit
[39:46] his grammar was
[39:48] if he have studied literature say hey
[39:51] this is terrible grammar but god did it
[39:53] for a purpose
[39:55] when he preaches you say
[39:57] he doesn't sound but
[39:59] listen to it further don't just hurry
[40:02] he's just speaking about this about
[40:04] hunting about that then he gets to a
[40:06] place where
[40:07] he gets in the groove he preaches his
[40:09] message then that message that doesn't
[40:12] sound so special
[40:13] he gets to the end and he says you know
[40:16] who i'm waiting for
[40:18] you know who i'm waiting for he's here
[40:22] the ministers that were sitting behind
[40:24] there looking where is this one who is
[40:27] here
[40:28] where is this one who is here
[40:30] and then he says now be careful now
[40:33] i take over control i
[40:36] it wasn't him it's because he is there
[40:39] i take over control of every spirit here
[40:42] under my control so all the billions
[40:45] whatever they are is now under my
[40:48] control
[40:49] he is here so that's the anointing i'm
[40:52] talking about i work with an anointing
[40:55] with the singers when we get on the same
[40:57] anointing
[40:59] i feel comfortable they feel comfortable
[41:02] amen

[58:51] i'm sure something will be said which
[58:52] will help you
[58:54] amen
[58:57] praise god
[59:00] john chapter one
[59:02] starting from verse 1.
[59:06] amen
[59:07] it's a well-known scripture
[59:10] in the beginning was the word and the
[59:12] word was with god and the word was god
[59:15] the same was in the beginning with god
[59:18] all things were made by him and without
[59:20] him was not anything made that was made
[59:23] in him was life and the life was the
[59:25] light of men
[59:27] and the light shineth in darkness and
[59:28] the darkness comprehended it not
[59:31] there was a man sent from god whose name
[59:33] was john the same came for a witness to
[59:35] be a witness of the light that all mean
[59:37] through him might believe
[59:39] he was not that light but was seen to be
[59:41] a witness of that light
[59:43] that was the true light which lighteth
[59:45] every man that cometh into the world
[59:48] he was in the world and the world was
[59:49] made by him and the world knew him not
[59:52] he came unto his own and his own
[59:53] received him not but as many as received
[59:56] him to them gave you power to become the
[59:58] sons of god even to them that believe on
[1:00:01] his name
[1:00:02] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:00:04] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:00:06] but of god
[1:00:08] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:00:10] among us and we beheld his glory the
[1:00:12] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:00:14] father
[1:00:15] full of grace and truth
[1:00:17] john bear witness of him and cried
[1:00:19] saying this was he of whom i spake he
[1:00:21] that cometh after me is preferred before
[1:00:23] me for he was before me amen and of his
[1:00:27] fullness have we all received and grace
[1:00:29] for grace
[1:00:30] amen praise the lord in genesis chapter
[1:00:33] 1
[1:00:34] verse 11
[1:00:39] i'm needing this water a lot sooner than
[1:00:41] i thought i would
[1:00:46] my mouth gets dry pretty quick standing
[1:00:47] up here
[1:00:49] genesis chapter 1 verse 11
[1:00:54] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:00:57] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:00:59] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[1:01:03] notice this after his kind whose seed is
[1:01:05] in itself upon the earth and it was so
[1:01:09] and the earth brought forth grass and
[1:01:11] herb yielding seed after his kind and
[1:01:14] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[1:01:16] in itself after his kind and god saw
[1:01:19] that it was good
[1:01:20] amen in romans chapter 11 you don't have
[1:01:23] to turn there but i'm just going to read
[1:01:25] one verse there
[1:01:29] for if the first fruit be holy the lump
[1:01:31] is also holy
[1:01:33] and if the root be holy so are the
[1:01:35] branches
[1:01:37] amen god bless you you can take your
[1:01:38] seats
[1:01:43] damn
[1:01:45] if we look back to this time in genesis
[1:01:48] chapter one
[1:01:49] i'm just gonna put this down here in
[1:01:51] genesis chapter 1 where god was creating
[1:01:54] the earth as he was
[1:01:55] bringing all these things into
[1:01:56] manifestation which he had in his
[1:01:58] thoughts he established a law
[1:02:01] and that law was that every seed every
[1:02:04] form of life had to bring forth after
[1:02:06] its own kind
[1:02:08] so with the animal life if it was a dog
[1:02:10] it would bring forth a dog if it was a
[1:02:12] sheep it would bring forth a sheep you
[1:02:14] know whatever animal it was it had to
[1:02:16] bring forth that same life
[1:02:18] it's the same with plant life if it was
[1:02:20] a pumpkin it had to bring forth a
[1:02:22] pumpkin
[1:02:23] if it was a grapevine it would bring
[1:02:25] forth the grapevine
[1:02:27] if it was an apple tree they would bring
[1:02:28] forth an apple tree so whatever those
[1:02:30] seeds were they had to reproduce after
[1:02:32] they kind and that means that whatever
[1:02:36] sea was planted
[1:02:37] that seed had a dna on the inside
[1:02:40] which had to produce the same life which
[1:02:43] it contained right
[1:02:45] that same law was present in the human
[1:02:47] race you can look at you know even after
[1:02:49] the four you can look at cain and abel
[1:02:50] cain was a direct lineage of the serpent
[1:02:53] adam or abel was direct lineage of the
[1:02:55] son of god which is adam
[1:02:57] and abel was able to receive revelation
[1:03:00] cain wasn't and he was a murderer like
[1:03:02] his father so that sea just brought
[1:03:04] forth after its kind
[1:03:07] so the life which is in every seed
[1:03:09] ultimately manifests what's in itself
[1:03:13] now i'm sure we understand the principle
[1:03:15] of reaping what we sow right god doesn't
[1:03:18] punish you for your wrongs if you repent
[1:03:22] but there's a law in place that you reap
[1:03:25] what you sow
[1:03:26] right but says here in the quote god
[1:03:29] keeps his word in the message god keeps
[1:03:30] his word
[1:03:31] little church struggling now for the
[1:03:33] kingdom of god i'm going to try not to
[1:03:35] take too long brother ben i might have
[1:03:37] to skip some stuff but
[1:03:38] just um we'll just leave that in the
[1:03:40] lord's hands
[1:03:41] um
[1:03:42] little church struggling now for the
[1:03:43] kingdom of god don't never falter in
[1:03:45] this day if you do quickly repent jump
[1:03:48] right back up see if you stump your toe
[1:03:51] don't fall if you fall get up
[1:03:54] get up might get up sure if you've made
[1:03:56] a mistake now this revival coming on and
[1:03:58] you want and you went back and got cold
[1:04:00] and different
[1:04:01] wait get down to your bible walk out in
[1:04:03] the apple orchard somewhere get out
[1:04:05] yourself and say god now here i am i'm
[1:04:07] sorry of the scene
[1:04:09] you're going to get a whipping for it
[1:04:10] just remember that yes indeed you'll
[1:04:12] reap what you sow out
[1:04:13] yes sir but whatever you do take you up
[1:04:15] in here get right up straighten up say
[1:04:18] father here i am whip me just as thou
[1:04:20] sees fit lord here i am that's right and
[1:04:23] walk right back with a hallelujah in
[1:04:25] your heart
[1:04:26] god lets the whip down on you you say
[1:04:28] yes lord i deserve every bit of it just
[1:04:30] keep on going god will take you through
[1:04:32] all right
[1:04:32] it'll be over one of these days amen see
[1:04:35] so god's aim is never to break us down
[1:04:39] it is always to build us up always
[1:04:42] satan's goal is to condemn and to break
[1:04:44] down to destroy but god's goal is always
[1:04:47] to build up to heal right
[1:04:51] the interesting thing i heard by the
[1:04:52] rams say the other day janice and
[1:04:54] jambrus they could produce everything
[1:04:56] that moses did
[1:04:58] but they couldn't take it away
[1:05:00] brother ram says the reason they
[1:05:01] couldn't take it away is because god's
[1:05:03] the only one that can bring healing
[1:05:05] satan can't bring healing
[1:05:07] so he'll bring destruction and
[1:05:09] condemnation on all these things but
[1:05:10] he'll never show you the way out right
[1:05:12] but god always shows you the way out
[1:05:15] only god brings healing god brings
[1:05:17] deliverance because where the spirit of
[1:05:19] the lord is there is liberty i want to
[1:05:22] make the statement that
[1:05:24] god is not an insecure god
[1:05:27] he doesn't get upset just because
[1:05:29] somebody dared to do something that he
[1:05:31] he didn't want right he doesn't do that
[1:05:33] that's not how god works
[1:05:36] so and it's the same way with you know
[1:05:39] with parents and i'm not a parent yet
[1:05:41] but
[1:05:42] i'm just i'm just showing you the word
[1:05:43] here is the way you raise your children
[1:05:46] i might get in trouble for this one kind
[1:05:47] of say the way you raise your children
[1:05:49] the way your children relate to you is
[1:05:51] inevitably the way they're going to
[1:05:53] relate to god until god gives me an
[1:05:55] experience so we've got to be sure that
[1:05:57] the way we raise them
[1:05:59] is the way that god deals with his
[1:06:01] children right the god is not insecure
[1:06:03] he's a father and everything he does for
[1:06:06] his elect is for their benefits
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:09] so god put this law of reaping what you
[1:06:12] sow in place and he does that so that we
[1:06:14] can learn to do what's right so no
[1:06:16] chastisement is pleasant for the time
[1:06:18] but it works the peaceable fruit of
[1:06:19] righteousness by the alpha i really
[1:06:21] enjoy that service yesterday that was
[1:06:24] amazing
[1:06:25] and you know sometimes like that it's
[1:06:26] necessary for the lord to really point
[1:06:28] out things you know on the head but
[1:06:31] if it's done with the right spirit which
[1:06:32] i believe it was it brings redemption it
[1:06:34] brings freedom like we saw yesterday
[1:06:38] so the things we sow we will reap you
[1:06:41] know and we can do things sometimes
[1:06:42] which would scare us for life if we made
[1:06:44] the wrong choice but is god mean by
[1:06:47] allowing it does he love you less by it
[1:06:50] not at all
[1:06:51] he loves you just the same it's just the
[1:06:53] seeds we sow which brings forth its
[1:06:54] kinds like david and beth she by david
[1:06:57] sowed the wrong seed
[1:06:59] and he ripped you reaped what he sowed
[1:07:01] for years afterwards with um with amnon
[1:07:04] and with tamar and absalom killing amnon
[1:07:07] later he was reaping for years what he
[1:07:09] sowed
[1:07:10] even though god had forgiven him right
[1:07:12] so we've got to be careful what we sow
[1:07:15] satan will be ready to give you handfuls
[1:07:17] of tears
[1:07:18] everywhere you go
[1:07:20] to get you to sow that in your life
[1:07:22] but the flip side is true too god's
[1:07:24] given us his word
[1:07:25] and if we sow the word in our lives then
[1:07:27] it will bring forth the right thing
[1:07:31] the bible says in hosaiah hosea chapter
[1:07:33] 10
[1:07:34] sow to yourselves in righteousness reap
[1:07:36] in mercy break up your fellow ground for
[1:07:38] it is time to seek the lord till he come
[1:07:40] and reign righteousness upon you
[1:07:43] now i want to just move the focus a
[1:07:45] little bit and say now the word of god
[1:07:47] is also a seed right so jesus tells the
[1:07:50] parable of the seed that fell in the
[1:07:52] ground right they got sowed by the sower
[1:07:55] some of that seed fell in good ground
[1:07:57] some of the fell in stony places some of
[1:07:59] it fell you know
[1:08:01] amongst the tears and so forth
[1:08:03] but jesus said those who hear the word
[1:08:06] and with an honest heart keep it and
[1:08:09] then bring forth fruit with patience
[1:08:11] that's the good ground like bring forth
[1:08:13] fruit with patience it's not about you
[1:08:15] manifesting the word in your eyes your
[1:08:16] life if the right seed is sown it will
[1:08:19] produce the right life
[1:08:21] but just like any natural seed
[1:08:25] just sowing it is not enough it's got to
[1:08:27] be watered it's got to have moisture and
[1:08:28] it's got to have warmth to grow
[1:08:31] so we've got to keep it in the right
[1:08:33] atmosphere
[1:08:35] the things we've heard this weekend i
[1:08:37] promise you when you walk away from here
[1:08:38] satan is going to come and he's going to
[1:08:40] try and steal it away from you he's
[1:08:42] going to try to discredit it and make
[1:08:44] you believe that it was just emotion and
[1:08:46] it was just you know just a bunch of
[1:08:47] excitement
[1:08:49] but don't believe that
[1:08:50] don't let the devil steal that away
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] so
[1:08:56] you know if we if we keep that seed in
[1:08:57] the right atmosphere then it starts
[1:08:59] producing the word if it if we stay in
[1:09:02] the word stay in the right atmosphere
[1:09:05] and
[1:09:06] in the lord's time the lord quickens
[1:09:08] that seed and brings it to life in your
[1:09:10] in your life
[1:09:11] that's a law of god so as we continually
[1:09:14] behold the image of christ he changes us
[1:09:16] from glory to glory into his image
[1:09:20] brother branham likens the promises of
[1:09:22] god to his seed he says and show us the
[1:09:24] father and it will suffice us you can
[1:09:26] take a man that looks like a christian
[1:09:27] acts like a christian but if that man
[1:09:30] hasn't got the word of god in him if
[1:09:31] there isn't a germ of life in there to
[1:09:33] germatize that he will never raise up in
[1:09:35] the resurrection that's right because he
[1:09:37] can't rise there's nothing in there to
[1:09:39] raise him up again a seed now when you
[1:09:41] bury a seed you farmers you take you
[1:09:43] take and go out here and plant your corn
[1:09:46] you don't go out every morning and
[1:09:47] scratch it up and say let's see now is
[1:09:50] it growing anything happening to it no
[1:09:53] put it back down late the next day you
[1:09:55] say oh i want to see if it's getting
[1:09:57] along alright scratch it up again
[1:09:59] it'll never grow like that
[1:10:01] well the thing you got to do with the
[1:10:03] sea you commit it to the ground cover it
[1:10:05] up that's all you can do about it it's
[1:10:07] up to god to do the rest of it
[1:10:10] keep that seed in the right atmosphere i
[1:10:12] mean obama says well that's the same way
[1:10:14] it is with the word of god if you'll
[1:10:16] take any divine promise of god
[1:10:18] made in his bible put it in your heart
[1:10:21] and water it every day with the praises
[1:10:23] of god that's going to come to pass
[1:10:26] it'll grow
[1:10:27] if you don't quit fooling with it you'll
[1:10:29] if you'll just leave it alone he says
[1:10:32] don't say now let me see can i move my
[1:10:34] finger any better today or do i feel any
[1:10:36] better or headache a little bit better
[1:10:37] oh no it'll never be that just committed
[1:10:40] to god and walk away and leave it alone
[1:10:44] that's god's seed it will grow
[1:10:46] so don't fret about trying to bring to
[1:10:48] pass the promises of god in your life
[1:10:50] right don't fret about do i have the
[1:10:52] holy ghost don't i have the holy ghost
[1:10:54] if it's god's word if you've met his
[1:10:56] requirements if you've repented like
[1:10:58] what the alpha said you've been baptized
[1:11:00] it's god's word and it's up to him to
[1:11:02] bring that to pass in your life
[1:11:04] one thing i said to the to the young
[1:11:06] people the other day something that the
[1:11:08] devil kept me in bondage with a long
[1:11:10] time was that i was looking for this
[1:11:12] lightning and thunder experience you
[1:11:14] know sometime
[1:11:15] and i felt like i couldn't be a real
[1:11:17] christian until i got that
[1:11:19] and then the lord showed me hang on your
[1:11:20] experience is not just about a single
[1:11:23] occurrence a once-off thing it's an
[1:11:25] everyday walk where god reveals himself
[1:11:28] to you more and more so don't if the
[1:11:30] lord's given you a lightning and thunder
[1:11:32] experience praise the lord but don't go
[1:11:34] looking for that and expecting that
[1:11:36] because god works differently with each
[1:11:37] one
[1:11:38] right so
[1:11:40] if you've if like i said if you've been
[1:11:42] if you've repented and you've been
[1:11:44] baptized you've met god's requirements
[1:11:46] and all you need to do is believe that
[1:11:48] word and that seed will come to pass
[1:11:50] that seed will produce so that
[1:11:52] conception takes place without sensation
[1:11:54] so don't try to dig up the seed and see
[1:11:56] how it's getting along just leave it in
[1:11:58] the lord's hands
[1:11:59] it's not up to us to make the promises
[1:12:01] of god come to pass as his promises he's
[1:12:03] the one that makes it come to pass amen
[1:12:06] so if you see the promises of god
[1:12:09] if you want to see it come to pass in
[1:12:10] your life just commit it to him water it
[1:12:12] with praise and believe it
[1:12:17] eventually you'll look back and you'll
[1:12:18] see hey
[1:12:20] all these things are starting to come to
[1:12:21] pass in my life
[1:12:22] and i don't have anything to do with it
[1:12:25] it wasn't me that did it because i
[1:12:27] wasn't the one that stirred it up it
[1:12:28] just started happening by itself
[1:12:31] praise the lord
[1:12:32] all the lord's work
[1:12:34] now there's another seed that i want to
[1:12:36] talk about and that's you
[1:12:38] you are the predestinated seed of god
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:42] so if we look at a natural seed from a
[1:12:44] plant like a wheat seed
[1:12:46] we can see a perfect resemblance to us
[1:12:48] as a train being i had a slider which i
[1:12:50] wanted to put up but um i actually
[1:12:52] forgot my flash drive so uh it's okay
[1:12:55] i'm just gonna demonstrate it but
[1:12:57] you have a seed on the outside you've
[1:13:00] got the shell or the coat lid on
[1:13:02] on the and then just a little bit closer
[1:13:04] to the inside you've got where the
[1:13:06] nourishment is is the endosperm and then
[1:13:09] on the inside of that you've got the
[1:13:10] root of life which is the embryo right
[1:13:13] so it's like body spirit and soul
[1:13:15] there's a quote here which i i got from
[1:13:17] the internet
[1:13:18] where um
[1:13:21] somebody says the seeds for new life are
[1:13:24] found inside fruit
[1:13:26] they contain everything necessary for
[1:13:28] the growth and development of a new
[1:13:30] plant
[1:13:31] the three primary parts of a seed are
[1:13:33] the embryo in the endosperm right which
[1:13:36] is which is the um
[1:13:38] uh is is just around the embryo in the
[1:13:41] middle and the seed coat the embryo is
[1:13:43] the young multicellular
[1:13:45] organism before it emerges from the seed
[1:13:47] so the embryo is where the life lies
[1:13:49] right
[1:13:50] the endosperm is a source of stored food
[1:13:52] consisting primarily of starches the
[1:13:55] seed coat consists of one or more
[1:13:57] protective layers that encase the seed
[1:14:00] so this is this is interesting now we
[1:14:01] have this type with a case it represents
[1:14:04] our body which is the outer shell we
[1:14:06] have the endosperm which represents our
[1:14:08] spirit and then we have the embryo which
[1:14:11] represents the soul and that's that's
[1:14:12] the part that contains eternal life
[1:14:14] right
[1:14:16] now notice this they say the endosperm
[1:14:19] is a source of stored food for the soul
[1:14:22] so the things you feed on in your spirit
[1:14:26] is what filters down to your soul and
[1:14:28] generates either faith or unbelief right
[1:14:31] that by the brown says the channel to
[1:14:33] our soul is through the spirit
[1:14:35] so we've got to be certain that the
[1:14:37] things we feed on
[1:14:39] is the things that is what god said
[1:14:41] we've got to feed on the word
[1:14:43] the word comes into the spirit and then
[1:14:44] by revelation god brings that down into
[1:14:46] your heart
[1:14:47] and then it brings forth life right amen
[1:14:50] so there's only two senses and that's
[1:14:52] faith and unbelief and if you feed on
[1:14:54] the wrong things it creates unbelief and
[1:14:57] says you know unbelief is sin he hammers
[1:14:59] that point many times unbelief is sin
[1:15:02] so that's why there's a lot of things
[1:15:03] for us as christians which we don't do
[1:15:06] not because there's a verb item quote or
[1:15:08] a scripture which says don't do it but
[1:15:10] because it generates unbelief if it's a
[1:15:13] wrong atmosphere like a bowling alley or
[1:15:15] something which probably hammers a lot
[1:15:17] he doesn't do it because there's
[1:15:18] something wrong with throwing a ball
[1:15:19] within you know thin plastic pins it's
[1:15:22] about the atmosphere you've got to be in
[1:15:24] the right atmosphere surround yourself
[1:15:26] with the right atmosphere with the right
[1:15:27] things
[1:15:28] because then that filters down through
[1:15:30] to the soul right
[1:15:36] so
[1:15:40] so yeah so if we're spending too much
[1:15:42] time in the things of the world right
[1:15:43] and we and we feed on that i'm just i'm
[1:15:45] skipping a few things here
[1:15:47] but um
[1:15:48] you know that filters down to our solar
[1:15:50] produces faith our own belief so if you
[1:15:52] feed on the right thing it'll produce
[1:15:54] faith in your soul
[1:15:55] so faith comes by hearing the word and
[1:15:58] it's not just hearing it with these ears
[1:16:00] it's hearing it by revelation right
[1:16:03] the holy spirit making it alive to you
[1:16:06] making it personal to you
[1:16:08] so when god quickens something to you it
[1:16:12] anchors so deep in your soul that the
[1:16:13] devil can't touch it right that's why
[1:16:15] jesus said on this rock i'll build my
[1:16:18] church which is the rock of the
[1:16:20] revelation of jesus christ to you
[1:16:21] personally right i also spoke about that
[1:16:24] the other day as well to the young
[1:16:25] people that has to be a personal
[1:16:28] revelation to you it's not somebody
[1:16:29] else's experience that you depend on the
[1:16:32] lord places ministers there to preach
[1:16:33] the word and to guide us but ultimately
[1:16:36] we have to have our own experience with
[1:16:38] jesus christ
[1:16:40] so that's the thing that's the key is to
[1:16:41] creating the right atmosphere for that
[1:16:44] seed to grow
[1:16:45] so the more time you spend in the
[1:16:46] presence of the lord the more it will
[1:16:48] feed that embryo that soul right
[1:16:52] and brother brown said that soul is what
[1:16:53] dominates the spirit and in the body so
[1:16:56] if faith is reigning in your soul it
[1:16:58] will express itself right right through
[1:17:00] to the body
[1:17:03] now notice that the embryo is where the
[1:17:05] gym of life plays
[1:17:07] brother branham often speaks about it
[1:17:08] i'm still kind of laying a foundation
[1:17:10] here but but the branham often speaks
[1:17:12] about it when the cold comes and you
[1:17:14] know the winter and the leaves drop off
[1:17:16] the trees and so forth that seed or or
[1:17:18] you know the problem says the ground
[1:17:20] freezes and that seed bursts open and
[1:17:22] the pulp runs out of it
[1:17:24] he says here in the message hear him
[1:17:27] here's something that happened not long
[1:17:29] ago
[1:17:30] as you all know i'm a hunter i was a
[1:17:32] game warden for years i've hunted around
[1:17:34] the world africa india all over the
[1:17:37] mountains my mothers are half indian my
[1:17:39] conversion never took it from me i love
[1:17:41] the woods that's where i found god in
[1:17:42] nature going out in the woods and see
[1:17:44] little flowers you can't hide it let it
[1:17:47] die a log can fall over it and bury that
[1:17:49] little seed in there and it'll rot and
[1:17:51] the pop run out of it when springtime
[1:17:53] comes that little seed of life will work
[1:17:56] its way around that log and stick its
[1:17:58] head up and praise god
[1:18:01] you can't hide real life not over a
[1:18:04] bushel
[1:18:05] real life shows itself it can't kill it
[1:18:08] it'll live again just as sure as
[1:18:10] anything the frost can bite and the
[1:18:12] little flower and it bow its head they
[1:18:15] have a funeral position the four rains
[1:18:16] cry and bury the little thing it rots
[1:18:18] the bulb goes out the petals are gone
[1:18:20] the seed gone burst it open the pulps
[1:18:23] run out but somewhere in there is a
[1:18:25] little germ of life that no science can
[1:18:28] find
[1:18:29] just let the sun go to shine and warm
[1:18:32] the sunrise it'll live again
[1:18:34] if god made a way for a flower to live
[1:18:36] again how much more has he made a way
[1:18:38] for a man to live again
[1:18:40] you don't have to die to receive it you
[1:18:42] have to die to yourself
[1:18:44] then you won't have to impersonate
[1:18:46] nothing you got the genuine thing
[1:18:48] amen the brotherhood says that science
[1:18:51] can't find their germ of life even if
[1:18:53] they try it they can't reproduce a blade
[1:18:55] of grass right
[1:18:56] so to the naturals to the natural eye
[1:18:59] that seed might look as dead as it can
[1:19:02] be
[1:19:03] but
[1:19:04] god looks deeper than that
[1:19:06] and he sees that in that embryo there's
[1:19:08] a germ of life there there's a germ of
[1:19:11] life and in his time that will come to
[1:19:13] life
[1:19:14] and nothing is going to stop it right
[1:19:17] that germ of life was a part of alum
[1:19:20] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:23] now this this really blessed me as well
[1:19:25] the brother spoke about it a lot this
[1:19:26] weekend but so in god's mind he had this
[1:19:29] mystery hidden which was a threefold
[1:19:31] purpose right he had a threefold purpose
[1:19:33] in his mind
[1:19:34] and as we heard the first part was to
[1:19:36] reveal himself in christ right the
[1:19:38] original seed
[1:19:41] you might be seeing where i'm going with
[1:19:42] this but that's christ was the original
[1:19:45] seed he wanted to reveal himself in
[1:19:46] christ in the first part of his purpose
[1:19:49] to have the preeminence and his people
[1:19:52] right by his life living in her in the
[1:19:54] second part and to restore the kingdom
[1:19:56] back to what it was at the beginning and
[1:19:58] the third part so i'm going to come back
[1:20:00] to this now
[1:20:01] we were a central part of what god had
[1:20:04] in his mind right back then
[1:20:07] it doesn't matter how deep you appeared
[1:20:09] to be there was a part of god on the
[1:20:11] inside of you
[1:20:13] from before the foundation of the world
[1:20:15] right and it cannot be lost that part of
[1:20:18] god cannot be lost it's like that sea
[1:20:20] lying in the ground you know dormant in
[1:20:22] the cold in the winter and so forth
[1:20:24] there comes a time when the sunlight
[1:20:26] pierces through to that seed
[1:20:28] and nothing can stop that seed from
[1:20:30] coming to life right
[1:20:32] so when the s o in light reached you and
[1:20:34] you heard the message and like brother
[1:20:37] adrian commented when you recognized it
[1:20:39] was eagle food you heard from your
[1:20:41] theophany right you recognize that it is
[1:20:44] christ revealing himself to you
[1:20:46] and that's when that life right of
[1:20:49] christ connected with that germ that was
[1:20:51] on the inside
[1:20:53] and you came alive
[1:20:55] and out of seemingly nothingness that
[1:20:58] lifestyle is growing right brother says
[1:21:00] there's a law of life which has to be
[1:21:03] expressed it's a law of life right a law
[1:21:07] is something which can't be stopped
[1:21:09] there's a law of life on the inside that
[1:21:11] has to be expressed if you pour a slab
[1:21:13] of concrete over the grass
[1:21:15] during the winter around somewhere where
[1:21:17] the grass is the thickest it's right
[1:21:19] around the edges of the concrete because
[1:21:21] you cannot suppress that life that life
[1:21:23] right the satan might try to pour a slab
[1:21:25] of concrete on you right after the
[1:21:27] word's been sown i promise you like i
[1:21:29] said you when you walk away here he's
[1:21:31] gonna try to pour a slab of concrete on
[1:21:33] you young people the lord's done
[1:21:35] something for you
[1:21:36] be careful because satan is gonna try to
[1:21:39] pour a slab of concrete on that but
[1:21:41] don't you let him don't you let him
[1:21:42] steal that away right
[1:21:44] you just keep feeding on the word stay
[1:21:46] in a word atmosphere and then the lord
[1:21:49] will continue bringing that word to pass
[1:21:51] in your life right so you are a seed
[1:21:54] that is predestinated to life but says
[1:21:57] that's predestinated by four knowledge
[1:21:59] god didn't god didn't say ah i like this
[1:22:02] one i'm gonna pick this one i'm gonna
[1:22:03] pick this one no
[1:22:05] he could predestinate because he knew
[1:22:07] which ones were a part of him before the
[1:22:09] foundation of the world he knew which
[1:22:12] ones received the word back there did
[1:22:14] not believe the devil's lie and who
[1:22:16] would receive it today
[1:22:18] amen so that is how god predestinated by
[1:22:21] that full knowledge we rejected the
[1:22:23] devil's line the beginning and that's
[1:22:24] why we rejected today we believe the
[1:22:26] word today because we believed it in the
[1:22:28] beginning
[1:22:30] so when that word strikes it right that
[1:22:32] germ seed
[1:22:34] manifests the dna of its daddy
[1:22:38] so the bible says you hath he quickened
[1:22:40] who were dead in trespasses and sins now
[1:22:42] he quickened right brother says you had
[1:22:45] to have something to quicken
[1:22:48] to begin with right
[1:22:49] so when we were drawn to the message
[1:22:52] when we recognized that it was christ
[1:22:53] revealing himself it shows there was
[1:22:56] something inside us to quicken right
[1:22:59] it's like the lily it was if it's buried
[1:23:01] in the mud you know when that light
[1:23:03] reaches that lily seed all the way down
[1:23:06] there that life will manifest so even if
[1:23:08] you feel like there's a whole lot of mud
[1:23:10] on top of you
[1:23:11] that life will manifest
[1:23:14] once that ray of sunlight reaches that
[1:23:16] seed you might feel like there's a whole
[1:23:18] lot of human weakness on top of you a
[1:23:20] whole lot of lord i'm such a failure you
[1:23:22] know i'm i can't do it myself that's a
[1:23:24] good place to be
[1:23:25] when you recognize that to me i believe
[1:23:27] that's one of the greatest revelations
[1:23:30] is when you recognize i can't do it
[1:23:32] myself but god has to be the one that
[1:23:35] does that because when he does it
[1:23:37] no man can stop it
[1:23:39] nothing can bring it to it to stop amen
[1:23:43] that's a good place to be
[1:23:45] so
[1:23:46] i want to ask you is it the seed's job
[1:23:48] to somehow climb through the mud work
[1:23:50] its way to the top of the mud before it
[1:23:52] can express itself
[1:23:54] no not at all it is simply up to the sea
[1:23:57] to say lord help me
[1:23:59] help me and then lord reveal yourself to
[1:24:02] me
[1:24:04] and then when the law does it when he
[1:24:06] reveals himself to you
[1:24:07] nothing will stop that life from
[1:24:09] manifesting it's not in your flesh it's
[1:24:12] not in your spirit like it's not in the
[1:24:14] seed coat or the endosperm it's the
[1:24:16] embryo on the inside starts growing and
[1:24:19] the seed like that embryo that case
[1:24:21] can't stop it either right it might be a
[1:24:24] horrible case right i sometimes look at
[1:24:26] this case and i go oh this is an awful
[1:24:28] case but this case isn't going to stop
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:31] right in the lord's time as that life
[1:24:33] starts growing that case just breaks
[1:24:35] open
[1:24:36] and more and more you look at your life
[1:24:38] and you say that's christ that's not me
[1:24:41] that's christ praise god
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:45] so say lord interpret your word
[1:24:48] by bringing it to pass in me amen
[1:24:51] god doesn't need an interpreter he just
[1:24:53] needs somebody who's willing to yield
[1:24:55] and when you're willing to look away
[1:24:57] from your human abilities and look at
[1:24:59] christ
[1:25:00] then that sunlight can germinate that
[1:25:03] life right the life of christ will
[1:25:05] germinate that seed and bring it to life
[1:25:08] and christ will express himself through
[1:25:10] you to the world brotherham says you're
[1:25:12] in the token university can tell you
[1:25:15] what a seed seed is made out of but it
[1:25:17] can't give a seed life your education
[1:25:20] only takes you further away from god
[1:25:22] there is only one can give you life
[1:25:24] there is only one can give you life he
[1:25:26] says it twice and he will do it if
[1:25:28] you'll apply the token tonight he is
[1:25:31] here to give himself to you and give you
[1:25:33] life jesus christ is your life
[1:25:36] praise god
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:43] and this word that's been preached this
[1:25:45] weekend at the camp
[1:25:46] it's preaching the seed of god it's
[1:25:48] preaching life right
[1:25:52] it is such a blessing to be here
[1:25:53] brothers and sisters
[1:25:55] to be here where the word is preached
[1:25:57] right not from a human humanistic
[1:26:00] perspective
[1:26:01] but preached with life
[1:26:04] preached with life
[1:26:07] now remember now a seed needs light and
[1:26:09] water in order to germinate right but
[1:26:12] that's not where it ends that seed needs
[1:26:14] to stay in the right atmosphere to
[1:26:16] continue growing
[1:26:19] so when a son or a daughter of god has
[1:26:21] been brought to life
[1:26:22] you you can never lose that life again
[1:26:25] right the bible says grieve not the holy
[1:26:26] spirit of god by which you are sealed to
[1:26:28] the day of your redemption nothing can
[1:26:30] take that away but we've got to stay in
[1:26:32] the presence of the s-o-n right of the
[1:26:35] lord of jesus christ
[1:26:37] drink at the springs of living water
[1:26:39] amen continuously feed on the word stay
[1:26:42] in the right atmosphere
[1:26:44] in prayer fellowshipping with the lord
[1:26:46] praising the lord praising him for what
[1:26:48] he already has done right not just one
[1:26:51] day he's already done a work
[1:26:53] right and you just keep praising god
[1:26:55] thank him already even if you don't see
[1:26:58] that seed yet
[1:26:59] eventually that leaf will pop out
[1:27:01] through the mud and you'll start seeing
[1:27:03] it come to pass
[1:27:05] so
[1:27:08] one of my one of my favorite verses
[1:27:10] isaiah says isaiah chapter 26 i believe
[1:27:12] he says thou will keep him in perfect
[1:27:14] peace whose mind has stayed on thee
[1:27:16] because he trusteth in thee right
[1:27:18] that's the key is to keep your mind
[1:27:20] stayed on christ
[1:27:22] and then you stay in perfect peace that
[1:27:24] doesn't mean that there aren't going to
[1:27:25] be trials which comes sometimes the lord
[1:27:27] sees trials which absolutely breaks you
[1:27:30] right
[1:27:31] but if your eyes are on christ you still
[1:27:33] have a peace
[1:27:34] a peace through the storm through the
[1:27:36] trials
[1:27:37] that's the key is to keep your eyes on
[1:27:39] christ those things come to produce
[1:27:41] character in us right it produces
[1:27:43] character
[1:27:45] but if we just keep our eyes on christ
[1:27:47] we'll have a peace which passes all
[1:27:49] understanding
[1:27:50] amen peace doesn't come from the outside
[1:27:52] and work its way and
[1:27:54] it comes from the inside and works its
[1:27:56] way out right we don't produce peace by
[1:27:59] trying to force peace around us
[1:28:01] the life of christ in us the joy of
[1:28:04] christ in us produces peace amen
[1:28:08] keep our minds stayed on christ now as
[1:28:10] we stay in that atmosphere beholding the
[1:28:12] word right we changed into the image of
[1:28:14] christ and we start looking more and
[1:28:16] more like our daddy day by day
[1:28:18] and his seed his life starts producing
[1:28:21] after it's kind in us amen
[1:28:24] amen i want to come back to that but
[1:28:27] if i first want to go back to this
[1:28:28] thought of
[1:28:30] seed to seed that's my title this
[1:28:31] morning as seed to seed
[1:28:34] so notice this now that's every seed has
[1:28:36] to bring forth of its kind right the
[1:28:39] life which is in that seed is what makes
[1:28:42] it what it is right you can have two
[1:28:44] seeds which look absolutely identical
[1:28:47] right
[1:28:48] like you know but the brown speaks a lot
[1:28:50] about the true vine the false fine you
[1:28:51] can have seeds which look absolutely
[1:28:53] identical but if you plant it and like
[1:28:55] potatoes preaching is the word manifests
[1:28:59] life that's on the inside of that seed
[1:29:01] as soon as those seeds even if it's a
[1:29:03] wheat seed and a tear seed it manifests
[1:29:06] when the word comes on it right
[1:29:09] and that's not just you know it's not
[1:29:11] just on a on a dispensational level it's
[1:29:13] not just on a church age level it's on
[1:29:15] an individual level or even in our own
[1:29:16] lives
[1:29:17] if there's a seed if you're not sure
[1:29:19] which which seed it is just check it
[1:29:21] with the word
[1:29:23] you know just bring it to the word bring
[1:29:24] it under the light of the word and it'll
[1:29:26] manifest the seed that it is
[1:29:30] but the mam says here in questions and
[1:29:31] answers
[1:29:33] we're fixing to take communion just in a
[1:29:34] moment and i really want this to sink
[1:29:36] into you the thing of it is what's in
[1:29:38] your heart will produce make your life
[1:29:41] what kind of a seed you put in the
[1:29:42] ground will produce after its kind how
[1:29:45] can you take a popcorn plant and make a
[1:29:46] gems and weed out of it you couldn't do
[1:29:48] it no more than you can make a grain of
[1:29:51] corn and make a cockle bow you couldn't
[1:29:53] make them because they're two different
[1:29:54] natures two different lives altogether
[1:29:56] then you might take a gems and weed seed
[1:29:58] and an onion seed and they look so
[1:30:00] perfect alike till the very best of men
[1:30:03] couldn't tell them apart that's right
[1:30:05] the only thing you have to do is plant
[1:30:07] them
[1:30:08] they both look alike naturally but plant
[1:30:10] them they both will produce and one will
[1:30:12] be a gems and weed and the other one
[1:30:14] will be an onion right that's exactly
[1:30:16] right
[1:30:17] say why what makes the seed it just
[1:30:19] looks exactly like this produce a
[1:30:21] different kind of life
[1:30:23] it's because the kind of life is in it
[1:30:25] he says and a man of women a man or
[1:30:27] woman that professes to be a christian
[1:30:29] and don't live that kind of life by the
[1:30:31] grace of god notice this he says live
[1:30:33] that kind of life by the grace of god is
[1:30:35] a gems and weed by their fruits you
[1:30:37] shall know them if that things in your
[1:30:39] heart bears record of what you are
[1:30:41] somewhere else if it's evil it bears
[1:30:43] record that while you're down here when
[1:30:45] you die you'll just have to go where you
[1:30:47] are already if you're good and you're
[1:30:49] good because god has made you good and
[1:30:52] you're born again you're bound to go
[1:30:54] that way because that life will have to
[1:30:56] bear record with this place he says if
[1:30:59] it bears record record of here that's
[1:31:02] where you'll go if it bears record sorry
[1:31:04] he says if it bears record of down here
[1:31:07] that's where you'll go if a bear's
[1:31:08] record of up there that's where you'll
[1:31:10] go amen
[1:31:12] so kind of the kind now c c to c2c now
[1:31:16] the life which is inside us
[1:31:19] it makes us what we are right
[1:31:22] there was an original seed
[1:31:24] that went before us
[1:31:27] so god had this threefold purpose in his
[1:31:28] mind before the world began
[1:31:31] and the first part of that is that he
[1:31:33] would reveal himself to his bride
[1:31:36] through christ
[1:31:38] who was the original seed
[1:31:40] right
[1:31:41] and in the old testament
[1:31:42] when when a new harvest came they
[1:31:44] presented a wave offering
[1:31:47] that wave offering was the first fruits
[1:31:50] of the harvest that was to come
[1:31:53] right
[1:31:55] and it was a sign of what was to come
[1:31:58] it was the first fruits
[1:32:00] now brother man says in the sea of
[1:32:02] discrepancy and we know that jesus was
[1:32:04] the word saint john once said in the
[1:32:06] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:32:08] with god and the word was god and the
[1:32:10] word was made flesh and dwelt here among
[1:32:12] us then the word is a seed and the seed
[1:32:16] become flesh and dwelt among us
[1:32:19] jesus christ was the spoken word
[1:32:22] to mary made flesh right he was the
[1:32:25] original seed
[1:32:27] and and take note of this now a seed is
[1:32:30] something which has the potential to
[1:32:32] bring forth more of itself
[1:32:35] right
[1:32:36] and jesus christ
[1:32:38] was the original seed
[1:32:40] so his life that seed has to bring forth
[1:32:44] more of itself
[1:32:46] i trust you can see where i'm going with
[1:32:48] this if he was the first fruits who is
[1:32:50] the harvest
[1:32:52] i'm looking at it right here this is the
[1:32:54] harvest
[1:32:56] right here
[1:32:57] right god purposed before the foundation
[1:32:59] of the world he would reveal himself
[1:33:01] through christ who was the original seed
[1:33:03] right the first fruits in the first fold
[1:33:05] of his purpose but he wanted more than
[1:33:07] that
[1:33:08] right
[1:33:09] he by revealing himself through christ
[1:33:13] he wanted his life to come into a crop
[1:33:16] in this last days
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:19] and by that by his life having
[1:33:21] preeminence in his people
[1:33:24] and a bride
[1:33:25] he would produce the same life that was
[1:33:28] in jesus christ
[1:33:29] and that way he would have preeminence
[1:33:31] through a bride in the second fold of
[1:33:34] his purpose
[1:33:35] so that seed which walked the shores of
[1:33:37] galilee has reproduced itself again
[1:33:40] today
[1:33:41] in our lives
[1:33:42] by his life he has preeminence through
[1:33:45] the bride right
[1:33:47] so if that original seed expresses
[1:33:49] itself again
[1:33:50] it's not just through one seed but it
[1:33:52] produces many seeds right
[1:33:55] so christ is walking in flesh once again
[1:33:58] in a many-membered body right in many
[1:34:01] seeds in you and i
[1:34:03] he's produced his life again and you and
[1:34:05] i
[1:34:06] as a mini-member body amen
[1:34:09] so god tabernacled in christ as the
[1:34:13] original seed
[1:34:14] the christ was also a triune being right
[1:34:16] shall endosperm embryo now remember that
[1:34:19] the life that is in the seed is what
[1:34:22] causes it to bring forth certain fruits
[1:34:24] right so jesus said that for a seed to
[1:34:26] bring forth of its kind it had to die it
[1:34:29] has to abide alone and die right so
[1:34:32] jesus christ came and he paid with his
[1:34:34] life
[1:34:35] he paved the way so that his kind which
[1:34:38] is his seat after him could receive his
[1:34:41] life
[1:34:42] by him giving that life
[1:34:44] and bring forth himself
[1:34:46] again
[1:34:47] in this day
[1:34:48] right so if if jesus christ had not died
[1:34:52] he would have abided alone
[1:34:54] but like adam he chose to give up what
[1:34:57] he had
[1:34:58] so that he would not abide alone
[1:35:00] he decided in gethsemane that he was
[1:35:02] willing to take the way of suffering he
[1:35:05] was willing to give his life
[1:35:08] so that he could have a people in this
[1:35:09] day
[1:35:10] right that was redeemed back to himself
[1:35:13] so as a seed falls into the ground and
[1:35:15] dies
[1:35:16] he died he fell to the ground and died
[1:35:18] so that he could bring forth much fruit
[1:35:21] and we are that much fruit
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:24] jesus was our first fruits and all by
[1:35:27] the way says all that christ was he
[1:35:30] poured into the church right the god has
[1:35:32] once again brought forth kind after his
[1:35:35] kind in us and seed has been brought
[1:35:38] back to seed again
[1:35:40] praise the lord that's the way she
[1:35:42] manifests his life is by surrendering to
[1:35:44] him
[1:35:45] and letting him live his life through
[1:35:47] her amen that brings forth the
[1:35:50] manifestation of christ
[1:35:52] says here in the quote the spoke spoken
[1:35:54] word is the original seed
[1:35:57] it's a longest quote just bear with me
[1:35:59] every seed must come after its kind
[1:36:01] god made man in his image after his kind
[1:36:04] to be his word on earth he expressed it
[1:36:07] in jesus christ
[1:36:09] what was god was in christ that's a man
[1:36:12] after his kind see when god which is the
[1:36:15] word
[1:36:16] how many knows he's the word
[1:36:18] when the word was in christ a man human
[1:36:21] man expressing itself through him
[1:36:24] that was god the word in christ
[1:36:27] expressing itself
[1:36:29] and god in the beginning made man in his
[1:36:31] own image and that's the kind of man
[1:36:33] that god makes me makes today the
[1:36:35] seminary and the incubator hatchery
[1:36:37] turns out a bunch of hybrids see the
[1:36:39] schools but when god calls a man he is
[1:36:42] in his own image the word made alive in
[1:36:46] him
[1:36:47] that's right there he is there's god's
[1:36:49] man
[1:36:50] man made in his own image in his very
[1:36:52] likeness
[1:36:54] and jesus said he'll do the works that i
[1:36:56] do
[1:36:57] so god made man in his own image after
[1:37:00] his kind his kind what's his kind the
[1:37:03] word he is the word then if a man denies
[1:37:06] god's word how can he be in god's image
[1:37:08] just ask the question ask yourself how
[1:37:10] can you be in god's image and deny god's
[1:37:12] word when the word is expressed is the
[1:37:14] expressed image of himself
[1:37:17] oh he says it doesn't mean that the
[1:37:19] expressed image of god say
[1:37:21] oh i said it but it didn't really mean
[1:37:23] it i was wrong back there back up you
[1:37:25] know there was for some other time i
[1:37:27] didn't mean it oh mercy he says trash
[1:37:30] slop of the devil that he feared to eve
[1:37:32] don't let him try to poke it down an
[1:37:34] elected neck
[1:37:35] amen no sir they won't believe that just
[1:37:38] come join with algae join nothing you've
[1:37:41] got to be born
[1:37:43] not joined a new creature
[1:37:45] in his own image of his kind to be his
[1:37:49] expressed word on earth
[1:37:51] now jesus was god's expressed word do
[1:37:53] you believe that then what are we to be
[1:37:56] sons of god too with the expressed word
[1:37:59] in the church
[1:38:00] carrying on that's the mystical body of
[1:38:02] christ carrying on the same works that
[1:38:06] jesus did when he was on earth when he
[1:38:08] was here on earth see that's the kind
[1:38:10] after his kind praise god god's life
[1:38:13] producing a crop again
[1:38:15] now you can have the lutheran kind after
[1:38:17] the lutheran the methodist kind after
[1:38:19] the methodist the catholic kind after
[1:38:21] the catholic the pentecostal after its
[1:38:23] kind the oneness after it's the trinity
[1:38:26] after its but if you're god's kind
[1:38:29] that's different see you're the
[1:38:31] expressed image of the word making
[1:38:33] itself manifest oh my why it's got to
[1:38:37] the water falls on it it's got to do it
[1:38:40] praise god
[1:38:41] jesus christ was our first fruits and he
[1:38:44] he fell into the ground and died so that
[1:38:46] he could produce much fruit which is us
[1:38:48] right and
[1:38:50] he planted the seed on calvary
[1:38:54] and on the day of pentecost he sent back
[1:38:56] his life right
[1:38:59] he sent back his life into the church
[1:39:02] which was a seed after him
[1:39:05] and that sea that life produces the same
[1:39:08] life that was in christ so on a church
[1:39:10] age level you know we had we had the sea
[1:39:12] that died in the dark ages in the ground
[1:39:14] fell in the ground again and germinated
[1:39:16] again produced a stalk with luther the
[1:39:18] tassel with weasley and so forth and the
[1:39:20] shock with the pentecostal movement
[1:39:23] but now it's gone all the way back
[1:39:25] around to the original
[1:39:27] in our day and mature seed is producing
[1:39:31] the same life that was in christ today
[1:39:34] in our age god having preeminence in his
[1:39:37] people right
[1:39:39] we've had the shout right we are now in
[1:39:42] the voice
[1:39:43] we are the voice
[1:39:45] the bride is the final voice to the
[1:39:47] final age
[1:39:49] because it's the same life it's by his
[1:39:51] life living through her she is the final
[1:39:53] voice to the final age
[1:39:55] and it's all about him it's not about us
[1:39:57] it's not about our abilities our works
[1:39:59] it's about his life living it through us
[1:40:03] that just takes all the pressure off
[1:40:05] doesn't it praise god
[1:40:07] so our knowledge and our understanding
[1:40:09] isn't the life it isn't our works or our
[1:40:11] abilities it's the life of christ and
[1:40:14] the embryo the soul of the bride right
[1:40:17] that's the life of christ and that
[1:40:18] produces that life again in us
[1:40:22] as long as that predestinated seed stays
[1:40:25] in the right atmosphere it will bring
[1:40:27] forth the life of christ automatically
[1:40:29] and you can't stop it praise god nothing
[1:40:32] the devil does can stop it
[1:40:34] you know brother-in-law says you've
[1:40:36] sometimes god has to let those winds
[1:40:37] come and shake the tree around but you
[1:40:39] know just loosen those roots up a little
[1:40:41] bit so that it can dig down deeper and
[1:40:43] hold on hold on deeper grow deeper right
[1:40:45] grow stronger in christ
[1:40:53] and brother brahman says
[1:40:55] again in the spoken word is the original
[1:40:56] seed
[1:40:57] he says now remember every spoken word
[1:40:59] of god is the original seed god planted
[1:41:03] everything in the earth by his word
[1:41:06] and as long as you stay with the
[1:41:07] original seed it will breed itself right
[1:41:10] back and reproduce itself again
[1:41:14] i i spoke on this a while back
[1:41:16] this is not in my notes but god spoke
[1:41:19] the word over us right it goes from from
[1:41:22] thought to word to flesh
[1:41:25] right
[1:41:26] and god spoke the word over his bride he
[1:41:29] said he's gonna have a bride without
[1:41:30] spot or wrinkle right he's going to have
[1:41:32] a perfect people and that word that he
[1:41:35] spoke it was a seed that fell into the
[1:41:37] ground for a little while
[1:41:38] but it has to produce because god spoke
[1:41:42] it it was his eternal thought he spoke
[1:41:44] it and that has to come to life in flesh
[1:41:47] right from thought toward the flesh
[1:41:50] so christ is that original seed and if
[1:41:54] we stay with christ remember this the
[1:41:56] word is christ the word is not just the
[1:41:57] letter the word is christ
[1:42:00] and if you stay with christ his life
[1:42:02] will produce itself in you
[1:42:05] jesus was prophesied to bruise the head
[1:42:07] of the serpent
[1:42:08] and jesus christ in our day is still
[1:42:11] bruising the head of the serpent amen he
[1:42:14] got a real bruising this weekend praise
[1:42:16] the lord and don't let it stop there
[1:42:18] right when you go away don't let it stop
[1:42:20] there right just let the lord continue
[1:42:22] his work in you and you'll continue
[1:42:24] bruising that serpent's head
[1:42:26] amen notice that prophecy when he said
[1:42:29] it to eve he said it shall bruise thy
[1:42:31] head and thou shall bruise his heel
[1:42:35] notice this now it shall bruise thy head
[1:42:37] and thou shalt bruise his heel that's
[1:42:39] because christ
[1:42:41] was the one that was bruised on calvary
[1:42:43] so that we don't have to be bruised
[1:42:45] right he was bruised for our iniquity
[1:42:47] but the bride shares in the victory of
[1:42:50] christ
[1:42:51] that's why it says it shall bruise thy
[1:42:53] head and not just he shall bruise thy
[1:42:54] head because it's christ and his bride
[1:42:57] male and female together which is still
[1:43:00] bruising the head of the serpent
[1:43:02] praise the lord says you know the church
[1:43:04] age book it's that that same life you
[1:43:07] know it thwarts satan
[1:43:09] it thwarts him he'll be just as thwarted
[1:43:11] with that last day church
[1:43:13] as he was back then because it's the
[1:43:16] same life that's in her
[1:43:18] praise the lord
[1:43:20] again in the spoken word is the original
[1:43:22] seed
[1:43:25] um i might skip through this a little
[1:43:27] bit
[1:43:28] okay man was made to die he was made to
[1:43:30] live
[1:43:31] man sorry man wasn't meant to die he was
[1:43:33] made to live but high breeding brought a
[1:43:36] death there
[1:43:37] she hybrid it now do you deny the
[1:43:39] serpent see then i'll ask you why you
[1:43:41] what's the reason funeral service is
[1:43:42] about she was a hybrid every one of us
[1:43:44] are hybrid from the original that's the
[1:43:46] reason you're constantly dying
[1:43:48] excuse me but oh god there's a germ of
[1:43:51] life come from the real seed but god
[1:43:54] proved it was his seed he rose him up
[1:43:56] again see that through that life that's
[1:43:59] going over the original seed like was
[1:44:01] given to eve over his real church is
[1:44:04] bringing forth life again
[1:44:06] through the birth through the womb of
[1:44:09] his bride amen can you say that lord let
[1:44:11] your word be born in the manger of my
[1:44:13] heart
[1:44:14] amen through the womb of his bride see
[1:44:16] oh it's rich and glorious i give it a
[1:44:19] little time to study so it'll it'll sink
[1:44:22] in he is that seed he is that seed that
[1:44:24] was produced by the word of god
[1:44:27] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:44:29] there's the seed see taking the word
[1:44:32] amen that's the cro the attitude that
[1:44:34] christ wants us to have is be it unto me
[1:44:36] according to your word not lord help me
[1:44:38] to somehow produce your word no be it
[1:44:41] unto me according to your word amen
[1:44:44] but it says now jesus is the word made
[1:44:46] me made manifest he and the word is one
[1:44:49] and the same and that's why it was made
[1:44:51] so perfect oh sorry ma it was so made
[1:44:53] manifest in him so perfectly that's the
[1:44:56] reason that god manifested himself so
[1:44:58] perfectly in christ
[1:44:59] because he was the seed word the germ
[1:45:02] word itself the germ that's inside the
[1:45:04] seed that's the life in the seed you get
[1:45:06] it see he was the germ word of god the
[1:45:09] germ is the spirit the germ is the water
[1:45:13] so he says here the germ it's all about
[1:45:15] christ that's the point he's making here
[1:45:17] right the germ is the spirit the germ is
[1:45:19] the water
[1:45:20] and jesus had to be broken open there in
[1:45:22] order for that seed to let forth its
[1:45:24] life to water other seed that was coming
[1:45:27] praise the lord oh do you see even he
[1:45:30] said other sheep that's not even of this
[1:45:33] fold i have they're going to see that
[1:45:35] they're going to get that word and stay
[1:45:38] right with it
[1:45:39] and i'm sending forth the spirit to
[1:45:41] water it and it'll produce just exactly
[1:45:44] it'll produce miracles it'll produce the
[1:45:46] power of god it'll produce and it will
[1:45:48] not deny anything because it's kindred
[1:45:51] seed with the seed
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:55] i can't say mr cockerbury you can't live
[1:45:57] with me no sir no sir no it won't do it
[1:46:00] no indeedy
[1:46:02] it just won't mix can't mix death in
[1:46:05] life you can't be dead and alive at the
[1:46:07] same time
[1:46:08] see so you see what i mean
[1:46:10] it is the germ that come from the seed
[1:46:13] he is he is the word of god made
[1:46:15] perfectly manifest that's the reason
[1:46:17] that in him was what that was the thing
[1:46:20] that he is correctly the son from the
[1:46:22] first adam was the son that was produced
[1:46:25] was promised through adam continue on
[1:46:27] the human race and eve hybrided to the
[1:46:29] serpent and brought forth a generation
[1:46:31] of bastard children born to death
[1:46:33] without life and jesus come and was that
[1:46:36] seed he proved it everything that adam
[1:46:38] lost jesus was see he is the correct
[1:46:41] everything listen to this says
[1:46:43] everything that adam lost jesus was and
[1:46:46] jesus christ has again like i said
[1:46:48] poured himself into fullness into the
[1:46:51] church so we have everything that adam
[1:46:53] lost is being restored back to us amen
[1:46:56] now notice how he speaks here about
[1:46:58] hybridization i'm not not too far from
[1:47:01] done
[1:47:02] hopefully
[1:47:04] every time man hybridizes something puts
[1:47:07] his own interpretation to it it produces
[1:47:10] death right it dies it can't go any
[1:47:13] further right but a hybrid so hybrid
[1:47:16] can't produce the life of christ
[1:47:18] right only the true seed can produce the
[1:47:20] life of christ
[1:47:22] so notices the original seed life
[1:47:25] cannot be hybridized
[1:47:27] because as soon as you hybridize it it's
[1:47:30] not so you can hybridize the seed but
[1:47:32] you can't hybridize the life in the seed
[1:47:34] okay as soon as you hybridize the seed
[1:47:37] the original life leaves right and it
[1:47:40] cannot ever produce that original life
[1:47:42] again
[1:47:44] right it has a perverted life of its own
[1:47:46] then so when man takes the word and
[1:47:48] tries to interpret it themselves
[1:47:51] it produces death
[1:47:53] right so that's the lutherans organized
[1:47:55] and they started interpreting the word
[1:47:57] themselves so that the with the
[1:47:58] wesleyans and the pentecostals and it
[1:48:01] died right but the true life the true
[1:48:04] life carries right on down that lineage
[1:48:06] of predestinated seed
[1:48:08] but brahman says here and have not i
[1:48:09] sent thee so when a man tells you
[1:48:11] and and you the children going to school
[1:48:14] and they say that we come from a single
[1:48:15] cell in the ethics of darwin he just
[1:48:18] doesn't know what he's talking about see
[1:48:20] you take a horse and a well let's say a
[1:48:21] donkey in a mirror and they have a cult
[1:48:23] it's a mule but that meal cannot breed
[1:48:25] to another meal and have a meal it
[1:48:27] finishes right there
[1:48:29] hybrid corn you could hybrid corn and
[1:48:31] then you could plant that corn it won't
[1:48:33] be nothing see
[1:48:34] won't be nothing has to come back
[1:48:37] so how can then if we begin on evolution
[1:48:39] from single cell then where we at see
[1:48:42] their own scientific research proves
[1:48:44] them wrong see you can't do it you can
[1:48:47] breed the blue violet with a white
[1:48:48] violet and get the african violet but
[1:48:51] just leave them to themselves and
[1:48:52] they'll go right straight back to the
[1:48:54] original blue violet that's right so you
[1:48:56] see what he's saying here is not that
[1:48:57] the hybrid life produces it again but
[1:48:59] the hybrid life dies out right and it's
[1:49:02] only the original thing which remains
[1:49:05] brother says so when god spoken made man
[1:49:08] and man's soul was lost it absolutely
[1:49:10] anything outside of that joining church
[1:49:13] and anything is hybriding you've got to
[1:49:16] come back to god's got to speak the word
[1:49:19] back again that makes it life eternal
[1:49:22] when god speaks life into you then
[1:49:24] that's eternal again but until that it's
[1:49:27] a hybrid condition you see so the devil
[1:49:30] mingled with it and mixed tried to mix
[1:49:32] faith and something unbelief together so
[1:49:35] it makes a hybrid see but when god
[1:49:37] speaks and places the holy spirit in
[1:49:39] there and seals it it's eternal
[1:49:43] amen it's eternal it's it's interesting
[1:49:45] to note you know with the modern trend
[1:49:47] of technology
[1:49:48] science has been developing seedless
[1:49:51] fruit
[1:49:52] right
[1:49:53] so you know look at mandarins or bananas
[1:49:55] or grapes oranges whatever they've
[1:49:57] developed the seedless fruit by
[1:50:00] tampering with the life right and it's
[1:50:02] just the same way with christians who
[1:50:04] are under a denominational anointing
[1:50:06] they have a measure of fruit right it
[1:50:08] looks like fruit genuine fruit but they
[1:50:11] you know you might speak in tongues or
[1:50:12] produce you know all seemingly all the
[1:50:15] gifts of the spirit but there's no life
[1:50:17] in there there's no ability to reproduce
[1:50:21] that life of christ
[1:50:22] right it's a hybrid religion
[1:50:25] and it has no ability to reproduce life
[1:50:28] because it's sterile right
[1:50:30] so the way i looked it up and they say
[1:50:32] the way they reproduce these these
[1:50:35] seedless fruit trees is by grafting
[1:50:37] right brother brandon speaks about that
[1:50:39] it's merely it's a denominational life
[1:50:41] which feeds off the tree of life
[1:50:44] it produces it keeps producing in its
[1:50:47] own kind of seedless fruit which is dead
[1:50:50] denominational life without the life of
[1:50:52] christ but the bride grows from the
[1:50:54] original life right the bride isn't
[1:50:56] another branch which is just grafted and
[1:50:58] the bride is an original
[1:51:00] life is is the tree that's put forth its
[1:51:04] own branch again and it's the exact same
[1:51:06] dna as the main stump amen
[1:51:10] that's the original seed producing
[1:51:13] itself again so it fell into the ground
[1:51:15] in the dark ages right
[1:51:16] and by the restoration of the bright
[1:51:19] tree she's she's grown back again
[1:51:21] through justification sanctification
[1:51:23] restoration of the gift
[1:51:25] and finally today in our day it's back
[1:51:29] to the fruit
[1:51:30] which contains the seed right and it's
[1:51:33] producing the same life that was in
[1:51:35] christ
[1:51:36] so you know denominations can try to
[1:51:38] graft their life into this tree but if
[1:51:40] that tree ever puts forth another branch
[1:51:43] it produces the same dna as the original
[1:51:47] and it will produce the same
[1:51:48] manifestations praise lord it's not her
[1:51:51] life
[1:51:52] it's not our life it's the life of
[1:51:54] christ in us that produces the word
[1:51:57] if we try to convince ourselves of our
[1:51:59] righteousness just by our work or how
[1:52:01] righteous we can live
[1:52:03] it leads to death
[1:52:05] because it's a perversion
[1:52:07] righteousness comes only by accepting
[1:52:11] god's work of grace and the holy spirit
[1:52:12] bearing record of that in your life
[1:52:15] that's how the life or the righteousness
[1:52:17] of jesus christ has applied to you
[1:52:19] so we need to just surrender to that
[1:52:22] and let the life of christ live through
[1:52:24] us
[1:52:26] abraham says now we find out as went on
[1:52:28] said as janice and jambres withstood
[1:52:30] moses we talked about that how that
[1:52:32] these things would be in this last day
[1:52:34] now and last quotation was was that god
[1:52:37] made every seed after its kind that's
[1:52:40] his see when he was made man when he
[1:52:43] made man in his image was a seed of his
[1:52:46] word and when jesus was made flesh he
[1:52:48] was the flesh of the word of god and
[1:52:51] when we receive the word of god then we
[1:52:54] become god's word in our flesh
[1:52:56] see the church should be in that
[1:52:58] condition right god's word in our flesh
[1:53:01] that's the second fold of god's purpose
[1:53:03] the brother man says here later in the
[1:53:05] same message spoken word is the original
[1:53:06] seed and a real seed of god is an
[1:53:09] absorbent for the spirit all denominate
[1:53:12] all the nominal denomination that that
[1:53:15] word is taken out
[1:53:18] all unbelief is out
[1:53:20] and when the holy spirit comes into that
[1:53:22] germ of life that's laying there it
[1:53:24] produces another seed i want you to take
[1:53:28] note of this because i want to touch on
[1:53:29] this again it produces another seed just
[1:53:32] exactly another son of god is born amen
[1:53:36] another amateur god son of god
[1:53:39] i'm a brandon because i was born of
[1:53:41] charlie and alibranum that makes me a
[1:53:42] branham because i'm their seed their two
[1:53:44] agreements with the sperm together made
[1:53:46] me a seed that made me
[1:53:49] when god and his word becomes one
[1:53:51] hallelujah when god's spirit waters the
[1:53:54] seed of god the word of god it produces
[1:53:58] god
[1:53:59] and it's not the individual it's god
[1:54:02] for what you are dead you are not
[1:54:05] yourself no more you wrecking yourself
[1:54:07] dead hollowed out waiting for the sea
[1:54:10] germ then what is it it isn't you no
[1:54:13] more it isn't the man it's god in the
[1:54:15] man it's the sea germ like the beginning
[1:54:18] spoken word it's god's word made
[1:54:20] manifest in the man then it isn't a man
[1:54:23] it's a man that's died he can't be a
[1:54:25] hybrid and a son at the same time he's
[1:54:27] either a son of death or a son of life
[1:54:29] so if he's the son of death get it over
[1:54:31] to the devil or sorry give it over to
[1:54:34] god i meant and let him kill the devil
[1:54:36] that's in you run him out and hollows
[1:54:39] you out then
[1:54:40] then let god plant his own life in you
[1:54:42] then it's not you no more it's god's
[1:54:44] life
[1:54:45] because it's god's word watered by the
[1:54:48] holy spirit will produce the same thing
[1:54:50] you see it
[1:54:52] so
[1:54:53] you notice this now
[1:54:55] the same when a tree puts forth a branch
[1:54:58] again it produces the same life right
[1:55:00] the same fruit it produces the same
[1:55:02] fruits of the spirit it produces the
[1:55:04] same love that was in christ it produces
[1:55:07] the same attitude towards others that
[1:55:09] was in christ right so a seed remember
[1:55:12] this a seed is something which has
[1:55:14] potential
[1:55:15] to produce more of itself right
[1:55:18] the same works of god is to be manifest
[1:55:21] in this bride now what is the works of
[1:55:23] god
[1:55:24] the works of god is more than just signs
[1:55:27] and healing and demonstration of the
[1:55:29] power it's more than that right it
[1:55:31] that's definitely part of it right
[1:55:32] healing the sick and raising the dead
[1:55:34] and so forth that's very much part of it
[1:55:36] but it's not all of it right
[1:55:38] so notice this now
[1:55:40] under the third pull or sorry under the
[1:55:42] first pull it was a sign that was in the
[1:55:44] hand right it was just the seed coat it
[1:55:46] was just the flesh the sun that's in the
[1:55:48] hand
[1:55:49] the second pull
[1:55:50] was the discernment of the thoughts and
[1:55:52] intents of the heart right that went
[1:55:54] deeper it went into the endosperm the
[1:55:56] spirit it was the discernment of the
[1:55:58] thoughts and intents of the heart but
[1:55:59] the third pull was about a spiritual
[1:56:02] union it was about the life of christ
[1:56:05] coming to the embryo
[1:56:07] the soul of the rainbow trout right it
[1:56:10] was more than just about natural healing
[1:56:13] it was about producing life
[1:56:16] in the bride right in the church so that
[1:56:19] same life that was in christ as as the
[1:56:22] messiah that same seed
[1:56:24] that in us
[1:56:26] is what makes us mini messiahs
[1:56:29] do you believe that
[1:56:31] brother rams is here
[1:56:33] sorry i'm just messing up my notes here
[1:56:35] so that same life is what makes us
[1:56:39] amateur redeemers
[1:56:40] amen so that life of christ and us
[1:56:44] if we are a seed of god
[1:56:47] that same seed has the potential to
[1:56:49] bring forth more of itself
[1:56:51] and that same life of christ in us
[1:56:54] produces more sons and daughters of god
[1:56:57] right like paul calling timothy his son
[1:57:00] in the gospel he said um you know
[1:57:02] timothy my son so forth my son in the
[1:57:05] gospel he wasn't his natural son he was
[1:57:06] the son of the gospel
[1:57:08] so we are called to live the gospel
[1:57:11] and allow it to produce the same life
[1:57:14] and draw others to christ through our
[1:57:16] lives
[1:57:17] amen so that same attribute of
[1:57:20] redemption that was in christ
[1:57:22] that should be expressed through the
[1:57:24] church is expressed through his people
[1:57:26] in the second fold of his purpose amen
[1:57:29] the brotherhood
[1:57:31] the bible says you know that death and
[1:57:33] life are in the power of the tongue
[1:57:36] so if we speak our interpretation of a
[1:57:38] word
[1:57:39] it produces death
[1:57:40] right
[1:57:42] but
[1:57:43] if we are yielded to christ
[1:57:46] and god anoints us
[1:57:48] as vessels yielded to christ
[1:57:50] when we speak
[1:57:53] under the anointing of the spirit the
[1:57:55] holy spirit can ride on those words
[1:57:58] and produce life in the era
[1:58:01] if they have the ability to receive that
[1:58:03] it can produce life in the here now it's
[1:58:06] like the bible says while peter yet
[1:58:08] spake these words the holy spirit fell
[1:58:09] on them that heard the word
[1:58:12] so if we're speaking the word right but
[1:58:14] ram says if if that bride is so
[1:58:16] surrendered to christ it's not her
[1:58:19] speaking anymore it's deity speaking
[1:58:21] through her right so if you speak the
[1:58:24] word of god the undiluted word of god to
[1:58:27] a brother or sister
[1:58:29] it will produce life if there is an
[1:58:31] ability to produce life it will produce
[1:58:34] the life of christ right
[1:58:36] so the holy spirit can write on those
[1:58:38] words and penetrate into that embryo
[1:58:41] right into that heart and then that
[1:58:43] brother or sister can come to life right
[1:58:45] that doesn't just count for ministers
[1:58:47] right that counts for every son or
[1:58:49] daughter of god that's surrendered to
[1:58:51] his spirit right that's surrendered to
[1:58:53] christ us as ministers we're not any
[1:58:55] more important than the laity we're
[1:58:57] servants to the laity right
[1:58:59] but any vessel that is anointed by the
[1:59:02] spirit of god can speak life to another
[1:59:04] elected vessel amen so like mary
[1:59:08] she was anointed by the holy ghost to
[1:59:10] produce the christ child right and while
[1:59:12] she was speaking to elizabeth when she
[1:59:14] spoke the name of jesus
[1:59:16] john in elizabeth's womb received the
[1:59:18] baptism of the holy ghost you believe
[1:59:21] that
[1:59:22] amen so it's not not just works science
[1:59:25] it's not just uh just healing natural
[1:59:27] healing it's about that life producing
[1:59:30] more of christ
[1:59:32] right in others
[1:59:34] so
[1:59:35] and it's not it's it's not just about
[1:59:38] coming to life it's also you know you
[1:59:40] can have a brother and sister which can
[1:59:42] be a holy ghost filled but they can be
[1:59:45] clouded over with the wrong spirit
[1:59:47] and you speaking the word under the
[1:59:49] anointing of the spirit can move back
[1:59:51] that spirit and can produce freedom in a
[1:59:55] brother or sister's life right so if the
[1:59:57] un uncompromised word is preached by the
[2:00:00] anointing of the holy spirit it produces
[2:00:03] life doesn't matter which way you take
[2:00:05] it it will produce life right not
[2:00:08] bondage not works it produces the life
[2:00:10] of christ
[2:00:12] so
[2:00:14] amen so because you know you can ask the
[2:00:17] question why
[2:00:18] because it's not you speaking you know
[2:00:20] and brother man says it's deity speaking
[2:00:23] when that vessel is surrendered to
[2:00:24] christ we are anointed vessels
[2:00:27] anointed to carry forth the word of our
[2:00:30] hour right the life of christ today
[2:00:33] christ living through us right christ
[2:00:35] loving through us and christ producing
[2:00:38] his work through us we don't have to
[2:00:39] follow the signs the signs follow us
[2:00:42] because we believe the word right the
[2:00:45] life of christ fulfills his own word
[2:00:48] through us
[2:00:49] all the christ was he poured into the
[2:00:51] church she is him amen
[2:00:54] brother braham says here in the messiah
[2:00:57] i was talking about messiah the messiah
[2:01:00] messiahs
[2:01:01] they are the life sorry they are the
[2:01:03] light of the church today the light of
[2:01:05] the world jesus said to his disciples ye
[2:01:08] are the light of the world
[2:01:10] now you're a candle that sits on a hill
[2:01:12] that a light can be seen from everywhere
[2:01:14] we are the light if we are we reflect
[2:01:17] his messiah life the messiah sign
[2:01:20] follows the messiah's the same as it
[2:01:23] followed the messiah amen
[2:01:26] it's so good it's it might be a
[2:01:28] controversial topic but i love it anyhow
[2:01:30] that
[2:01:32] because the life of christ is in the
[2:01:34] bride today
[2:01:35] the mercy seat that was on the cross
[2:01:38] 2000 years ago is in the bride today
[2:01:41] right that mercy seat is now in the
[2:01:43] bride
[2:01:44] mercy is now in the bride amen and
[2:01:47] that's why you know brother you know the
[2:01:48] bible says if you if someone gives you
[2:01:50] as much as a cup of cold water they
[2:01:52] won't lose their reward because they're
[2:01:54] not doing it just to a normal person or
[2:01:57] just to anybody they're doing it to the
[2:01:59] mercy seat expressed in flesh again in
[2:02:02] our day
[2:02:04] so
[2:02:05] praise the lord so brother brandon says
[2:02:07] here here's some time ago
[2:02:09] in your lovely church here i believe in
[2:02:10] the same quote now he says i believe i
[2:02:12] preached on the subject here as the
[2:02:14] eagles stir with her nest flattereth
[2:02:15] over her young i believed i preached on
[2:02:18] that down there brother jack was
[2:02:19] somewhere yeah eagle stirring her nest i
[2:02:21] like to watch the big eagle you know
[2:02:23] that father eagle you know god called

[2:02:29] he told it that that eagle jacob he
[2:02:31] found him in a howling wilderness and as
[2:02:33] the eagle stirred its nest now we find
[2:02:35] out he calls himself eagle too so he's
[2:02:38] jehovah eagle and then he's got a bunch
[2:02:41] of eaglets eaglets like messiah it's
[2:02:44] eaglets
[2:02:45] now i can see the big eagle as he's
[2:02:47] walking around over the nest he loves to
[2:02:50] look at his children amen i think god
[2:02:52] was standing here with a if you could
[2:02:54] see him with a pleased smile on his face
[2:02:56] looking at everything that was happening
[2:02:57] here
[2:02:58] did you know that he called his
[2:03:00] prophet's eagles
[2:03:04] sure he did
[2:03:06] ah sorry now we find out he calls
[2:03:07] himself eagle two so he's jehovah eagle
[2:03:10] then he's got a bunch of eaglets eaglets
[2:03:12] like messiahs eaglets now i can see the
[2:03:15] big father eagle as he's walking over
[2:03:17] around over the nest he loves to look at
[2:03:19] his children oh my
[2:03:21] now he loves to look at them how do they
[2:03:23] look look just like he does they're not
[2:03:26] hybrid they're not half buzzard and half
[2:03:28] crown something else they're eagles amen
[2:03:31] that's what we are today we we're
[2:03:33] methodist baptist assemblies and so and
[2:03:35] so and so and so buzzards crows and
[2:03:37] everything else how can we be eaglets
[2:03:39] how can we when we see the sign of god
[2:03:41] moving among us and calling it something
[2:03:43] else hallelujah he likes to because he
[2:03:45] knows that they are thoroughbred they've
[2:03:48] got his flesh they got his blood they
[2:03:49] got his purity amen how proud he looks
[2:03:52] over his eaglets walking around amen the
[2:03:55] little egg let's look at him and say how
[2:03:57] great thou art how great they are
[2:04:00] look at myself oh my going to take a
[2:04:02] flight one of these days ain't we papa
[2:04:05] amen see how he likes to look at them
[2:04:08] they look like him they act like him
[2:04:10] they are his flesh his blood his spirit
[2:04:14] amen that's the way god's church is his
[2:04:16] eaglets his messiahs they look like him
[2:04:19] they act like him they preach like him
[2:04:22] they do the works that he did these
[2:04:24] things that i do shall he the things
[2:04:26] that i do shall he do also more than
[2:04:28] this shall he do because i go to the
[2:04:30] father amen these signs shall follow
[2:04:32] them eaglets hallelujah amen they'll do
[2:04:35] just as i do if my spirits in them
[2:04:39] they'll do the works that i do
[2:04:42] jesus christ as the original seed has by
[2:04:45] his life again produced kind after his
[2:04:48] kind and he's walking around in flesh
[2:04:51] again today
[2:04:52] in a mini-membered body praise god and
[2:04:54] that's why it's back to the son of man
[2:04:56] ministry again because christ in
[2:04:58] fullness is once again
[2:05:00] expressed in a many member body
[2:05:03] praise god
[2:05:04] 1 john 3 verse 9 says whosoever is born
[2:05:07] of god doth not commit sin for his seed
[2:05:10] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[2:05:12] because he is born of god
[2:05:14] so we can say
[2:05:16] who can accuse me of sin
[2:05:18] if my life is hidden with christ and his
[2:05:20] spirit bears record in my life of his
[2:05:22] righteousness in me who can accuse me of
[2:05:25] sin
[2:05:26] praise god
[2:05:28] for if the first fruit be holy the lump
[2:05:30] is also holy and if the root be holy
[2:05:33] that is my opening scripture for root
[2:05:34] bioli so are the branches because it's
[2:05:37] the same life it's the same dna amen the
[2:05:41] same life in both the first fruits and
[2:05:43] the harvest
[2:05:44] hallelujah
[2:05:46] so job asked this question if a man dies
[2:05:48] shall he live again melbourne says here
[2:05:51] now that'll go on through december
[2:05:52] january february march april may now may
[2:05:54] comes along
[2:05:56] last of april first of may the seed gone
[2:05:59] the pulp's gone the pedal's gone the
[2:06:01] stalk's gone
[2:06:02] everything there was of that flower is
[2:06:04] gone that can be seen
[2:06:06] is it gone
[2:06:07] no
[2:06:08] god has provided a way there's a little
[2:06:11] germ of life
[2:06:12] laying there somewhere just as sure as
[2:06:15] that sun rises yonder in the east and
[2:06:18] begins to shine
[2:06:19] warm upon the ground it lives again why
[2:06:23] god provided a way for it to live again
[2:06:26] if god made a way for a flower to live
[2:06:28] again
[2:06:29] what about a man that's made in his
[2:06:31] image can we have the musicians please
[2:06:33] what about a man that's made in his
[2:06:35] image how god has made a way for us to
[2:06:38] live again
[2:06:40] but we can say like that like job said i
[2:06:43] know my redeemer lives
[2:06:45] and at the last day
[2:06:47] even if the skin worms destroy this
[2:06:49] flesh i will see god because i am an
[2:06:52] expression of his dna in our day
[2:06:55] there's a law of life within us and
[2:06:58] nothing can stop that law of life from
[2:07:00] being produced
[2:07:02] so there's coming a day where the seeds
[2:07:04] of god
[2:07:06] right which sleep in the dust of the
[2:07:07] earth and the seeds those who are alive
[2:07:10] and remain
[2:07:11] he'll say right it's time to take my
[2:07:13] harvest
[2:07:14] and he takes them into his barn
[2:07:16] and in the third fold of his purpose he
[2:07:18] gathers his elect with them and she
[2:07:21] reigns and rules with him on his throne
[2:07:24] praise the lord so he's going to gather
[2:07:27] his wheat into the ghana with him
[2:07:29] eden will be restored and that's king
[2:07:31] and queen again right the original seed
[2:07:33] and his harvest together
[2:07:36] raining on his throne
[2:07:37] because we have the life of god the life
[2:07:40] of christ in us we cannot die
[2:07:43] we cannot die nothing can kill that life
[2:07:46] it will produce itself again
[2:07:48] and it's not just a perpetual life like
[2:07:50] a seed it's eternal life it's zoe life
[2:07:53] that same eternal life
[2:07:55] will bring us all back together again
[2:07:58] and he's going to rapture that life he
[2:08:01] is rapturing that life he's going to
[2:08:03] take that life with him to be with him
[2:08:04] for eternity so if you feel brother and
[2:08:07] sisters like something was said this
[2:08:09] weekend something was done for you this
[2:08:10] weekend

[2:08:13] don't let the day of the devil uproot
[2:08:15] that seed and say hey there's no life
[2:08:16] there
[2:08:17] just give a chance to stay in the right
[2:08:19] atmosphere stay in fellowship with
[2:08:22] christ right
[2:08:23] just stay on your knees stay in the wood
[2:08:25] stay and fellowship with christ
[2:08:28] and that seed will produce itself again
[2:08:30] right but the brown makes that statement
