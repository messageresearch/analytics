morning everyone how's everyone today praise the lord trust everyone's well and happy rejoicing they're a christian today amen praise the lord amen let's um i said just one notice if uh just if you want to grab your bibles um so all the youth who are going to go to the youth banquet in taranaki you need to register and pay by today police so because brother always got to put in the final numbers tomorrow so if you could make sure you're you're booked in amen that's all we have um let's go to ephesians three uh today we're going to read uh a bit here from ephesians 3 then we're going to go to revelations 3 as well so the youth had a bitter uh a bit of this at the um at the snow trip um uh yeah but we're just going to go into it a bit further uh today so ephesians 3 from verse 5 down to 12 says here the apostle paul saying which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as is now revealed unto his holy prophets and apostles by the spirit the gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereby i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me whom less than least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith by the faith of him amen we're just going to go to revelations 3 and we're going to read from from the philadelphian age here so revelations 3 and 7 and 8. we're gonna we're gonna take a portion of this for a bit of a uh context as well so so revelations three and seven it says unto the angel of the church of philadelphia right these things sayeth he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hath a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name amen so let's just bow here's the word of prayer this morning if you ever need just want to raise your hands to the lord you say brother ben you saved at every service but we have a need and the lord sees the need and he sees our hand raised and he's mindful of everything we're going through in life i mean there's nothing too big or small for our god amen let's pray together gracious lord we want to thank you dear god we can see the evidence lord of your goodness all over our lives lord jesus your promises and fulfillment dear god as your word has been lord looking or prophesying of a bride lord that would raise from the pages of the word oh god that should be the word made flesh today lord shall be bone of your bone flesh of your flesh life of your life lord she'll be part of you dear god made in your image lord and we lord we look around us we look lord at our own lives and we see lord that that promise is being fulfilled in our lives and we just stand in awe lord of lord of what you're doing in our lives we thank you so much dear god you're making us more like you every day and we just want to pray to god as we read your holy word may it live oh god in our hearts lord you see every need o god may come and just lord may meet every need for your glory we just want to commit our lives once again we surrender all that we are into your hands lord for your glory we thank you for this opportunity to worship you together in spirit and in truth we praise your great name lord be with all those who are not here as well today lord we're the second body or traveling or wherever they may be o god be their portion for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning i want to continue on uh with that thought uh my thought of um speaking about head chip that was a couple of sundays uh uh wednesdays ago um i think it's weird it's been over a month since i've stood here on a sunday but here we are anyway so i want to talk about so the headship you're under is what's been revealed to you where uh where we must recognize the supreme deity of jesus christ it's absolutely essential that we realize he's not just a second person or a person of the godhead but the fullness of god he bodily dwelled in him that he was god made flesh right so he wasn't just a god he wasn't just a prophet or a holy man or something like that but he was the god the almighty king of glory made flesh and dwelt among us and it's very important because if we realize the hatred we're under then we can realize the authority that's been given in that headship where um because as we read here in ephesians we'll go into it later that there's the apostle paul was saying there's a time now where the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made known to the church or by the church and another translation says it'll be through the assembly so it's not just something that would be head knowledge or something that's a nice idea that's theory but it would be a reality of all the powers and principalities and heavenly places will be made would be made known through you oh god you know whether it be healing or or salvation you know deliverance or prophecy or whatever it may be all the powers that are in heaven we may would be made known through your life now we read here in in in revelations 3 you know some people think you know what's the point of reading about a former church age now we know that a church age is a span of time in history right we know we're living in the seventh church age because the seventh church age you know when when the lord describes that age you say you're rich increase with goods have need of nothing and we know that this is this time i mean there's never been a time when the whole world has been rich and increased with goods you know even when this is years ago now in papua new guinea the first church however went to a pentecostal church and and there was a sunday school lesson before the service and and and the brother was preaching about revelations three saying look we're rich and increased with goods and in our mind you say no you're a developing world you're very poor but in there you know from what where they have been to where they are now they're very rich increase with goods i mean so the whole world has come into this condition so it's not hard for us to realize we are living in the ladies and church age now but the thing is that with god there's not an abrupt start and a stop there's an overlap from one age into the other age just like you know we can see this where when when when when salvation came to the jews here in the upper room it was all jewish believers but it was prophesied that god would take a gentile people for his namesake so what started happening is then then you come to acts chapter 10 and cornelius who was a gentile in this house with gentiles they came in and they received the same holy ghost that they did in the upper room and peter they said thereafter they received the holy ghost said can we forbid water saying they have received it like we did exactly in the upper room so now the gentiles started to come in and then and then god called the apostle paul and then and then he always went to the synagogues and he preached you know jesus christ being the messiah according to the scripture but then there was a blindness coming upon them so there came a time where we're sure jew and gentile were coming in but there was an overlap where the jews were being blinded and the gentile eyes were coming open and then finally he said see you find yourselves i'm worthy of eternal life low we turn to the gentiles so so then so sure there's been jews through this a few number through history that have received christ but as a nation as a great body of people they've been blinded but they have three and a half years of salvation amen when we go to the wedding supper in the sky that's when the two prophets come down and preach jesus christ to them the same god we know they will receive right but but there's an overlap time and it's the same thing even now you know that you know there's an awakening going on in israel because there's a blinding of the gentiles but an awakening of the jews amen so we're living in that time so don't let your eyes be blinded amen but may your eyes be open amen may our lands be burning trim and clear amen full of the holy ghost so there's an overlap always between one age and another now this where we read in revelations 3 saying i've set before then open door and and no man can shut it now this was a this was an open door where where where if we we won't look at it today but you look at the philadelphian age where where there was a methodist movement but then it grew into other movements and then and then and then just at the end of that age the the baptism in the name of jesus christ came back into manifestation where people were restored back to true water baptism in the name of jesus christ and and and and the truth of the supreme deity of jesus christ was being restored to the church so that was the open door that god had opened and no man could shut it amen so so going from that agent to this age there's a door open of revelation that would pour his strength into the church amen amen amen he says here he says brother brahm says here now he says an uh uh open door what was it it was the revelation of the supreme deity supreme deity of jesus christ not being a second person of a trinity but being god himself made flesh and dwelling among us he says and i noticed thou has a little strength and have not denied my name now the first time the name has been spoke of since one of the early ages you know because during the dark ages they lost his name and luther came out with a name and he was alive and was dead that's right was that father son and holy ghost but here comes out the name of jesus again and between these two ages here in between it's an open door it's a revelation that he was the deity the revelations of his deity amen so this is very powerful because we must realize and i'm sure i'm probably preaching to the choir but we're going to realize our god is supreme he is not just a god he's not just part of the godhead he's all that god was was poured into christ and all that christ was is poured into the church right so jesus christ is the name above all names i mean we do not have some headship that's got to negotiate with the enemy to try and get things done he's the supreme god amen no one's gonna ask him anything when he wants to do something he doesn't right he doesn't have to ask permission he just does what he wants to do because he's supreme i mean so we must realize that he's a supreme one because if we realize if our headship is supreme then nothing can stop us ain't because nothing could stop him the only thing that can stop us is yourself amen the devil's been defeated but now you've got to get yourself whooped out amen amen so i trust it's been revealed to you that it was actually it wasn't the blood of a jew that saved you well nor was it the blood of a gentile it was the blood of god that was shed that day on calvary as the apostle paul would speak there in acts 20 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the holy ghost hath made you overseas to feed the flock of god which he hath purchased with his own blood so he makes it very clear it was the blood of god it wasn't the blood of a jew or a gentile or a holy man it was the blood of god himself that was shed now there is great power in this blood where it is there is such power in this blood that it can change a person that they won't vary from the word one bit amen there's power this is not us trying to reform ourselves this is the supreme power of god the supreme deity coming into you and manifesting his word out of your life amen he would say brother brown was saying condemnation by representation oh brother god said it happens he says and that settles it it's always god said so jesus died that he might breed back oh hallelujah only the blood can do that only through the chemistry of the blood of jesus christ can breed back again a person that won't vary one word from what god said amen so there's power in the blood to change our nature we were born wrong to begin with but there's transforming power in his blood to breed us back let's see he's just using that kind of language to change our hearts that we won't vary from one word of god i mean there's power in that it's not our human mind trying to trying to keep this word now i may repeat myself but the devil's a liar i just want to just stand all over his face this morning amen because we're not here to play church we're not here to play religion amen no we're here to serve the living god amen this is not just a group thing this is a individual revelation amen because if you realize your god's unstoppable you become unstoppable i mean no weapon formed against you shall prosper i mean there'll be a lot of weapons a lot of mind battles a lot of doubts and flusterations may be formed against you but it won't prosper against you none amen if you realize that your handship is supreme hallelujah amen because real hatred elevates a person into god's ordained position for them amen caleb realized that they that that it wasn't moses saying the land is yours he realized that it wasn't moses saying this is the ten commandments it wasn't the ten commandments of moses i mean it wasn't moses idea it was god's idea and so caleb came under the headship of the pillar of fire that delivered them out of egypt amen and he received his inheritance right because he realized it wasn't it was not moses being their head god was there here amen the supreme deity was their head amen as the same thing with you and i will realize that this message is not a healing ministry only it's not even a prophet's ministry only but is jesus christ revealed i mean then it will elevate you into your god-ordained position as a bride of christ maybe when you hear the voice behind the voice amen where it goes from a mental remember faith is not accepting a bunch of facts and saying that's true that's not faith that's that's just a mental recognition that is correct no faith receives it and then god reveals it amen it's vice versa to human understanding amen he and caleb and joshua are under different hatred because they realize it wasn't moses that was leading them god was their head and because of that they could look beyond the humanity of moses they could look beyond his you know his his his his humanity they could look beyond that and they could see god and they received a reward from god we've got to do the same thing friends to look beyond the humanity of one another look beyond the humanity of the prophet amen and hear the voice behind the voice now it's very important that we realize that god has given us instruction to defeat every enemy this is why the angel of the lord comes you read through the book of judges the angel lord would reveal himself to gideon different ones to bring deliverance right i wasn't just now do this because i just want you to do something no no there are specific instructions to bring deliverance now when the angel of the lord spoke to samson's mother now the angel of the lord is god in angelic form right we understand that don't we right it is not just an angel as a messenger it's actually god in angelic form he would change his veil to be an angel then he'd go speak and um manoa sampson's father thought it was actually just a man because that's what he looked like that was the form he took on you go read their in judges but it was god they realized it was god they're afraid we're going to die because we've seen god but the angel of the lord gave a specific instructions to samson's mother aiming telling her don't drink any strong drink or wine or eat any unclean thing because out of you is going to come a deliverer out of you if i can put it this way it's going to become a messiah so she had to be a separated person in order that deliverance would come forth out of her for israel so it wasn't just now don't don't drink wine or have strong drink or any unclean thing for for no reason there's a specific reason behind it and god is showing us here that if we because remember a woman types the church in the bible if we could be separated unto god their messiah can be born in our midst and bring deliverance amen can actually destroy the enemies that are trying to destroy us so it's very important we realize that the instructions of the message is to bring deliverance it's not just to make us live a different kind of a life for the sake of it no that deliverance would come healing would come demon spirits would be cast out amen the holy ghost would be received amen protocols would return people from the other side of the ocean god can get a hold of them and bring them home amen bring them home to him geography is nothing to god i mean so that's why we've got to realize there's a reason we live a sanctified holy life as that deliverance would be born amen the messiah would be born i mean not just some not just some fallen man that just gives us heart to delilah and the strength of god but the word itself would come into full manifestation hallelujah that's why we're gathered that's what this message is sent to achieve as you're listening to uh the air is not seed with the the the seed is not here with the shook and you know he's saying that the seed there's time for the full manifestation of the fullness of god's power to be made known i mean it's not just a partial reality but the full reality of his word all that god is would be manifested in a people and i'm just thinking that's our day this is our time hallelujah i made you think well you're just excited over nothing no i'm excited over the word of god because we're living in the season of a full deliverance living in a season where people can really meet god and their lives can never be the same and then go from victory to victory hey some victories may be hard there's gonna be a lot of dying out but god can live in a people in such a way that they can look back and say every devil's come under my feet hallelujah amen this is the hour of it you say well they god would never choose me god chooses the unlikelies of the scripture i mean look at rahab she was a harlot look at tamar look at you know look at all the ones he he picked the woman at the well you know the woman with the alabaster box matthew was a tax collector all the the other apostles were you know they couldn't even read sign their own names but god used him as a mighty power amen so god's the same with us never ever think that you know you know god would never choose you know he's chosen you amen he's already put your name in his book but we've got to realize that our name is in his book hallelujah amen praise god now so if we can i trust we can get to a place and and and i believe that we're we are there but you know brother brown would say this and faith once delivered to the saints it's god's eternal spoken word by born again people by prayer asking god and god's obligated to his word when that real not put on not make believe but a real settled faith is in a man's heart that don't vary from god's word a bit it's god's word being spoken by mortal lips that's the faith that was once delivered to the saints i mean so a real faith that's settled in a man's heart that don't vary from god's word so he never said that a real faith is you'd be uh you you'd have no trouble you'd have no mind battles you'd have no trouble going on no no that's not the faith you're talking about but a real settles faith in a man's heart that it can't vary it don't vary from god's word a bit that's the faith that's once delivered to the saints right so i believe we can we are now this is you know really i'm just telling you who you are you know we need to realize who we are because the prophet said once she realizes who she is then the rapture will go when the bride realizes who she is amen that we are we are the word made flesh today amen so now we're living in an hour where the fullness of god has been all the power of heaven's been turned loose upon the earth right we can we can say how dark the world is you know we can read in revelations 9 the bottomless pit's open there's all these demon powers being released but we know that's not the end of the story because when john saw that happen in revelations 9 then in revelations 10 he says then i saw another mighty angel to sin so christ himself an angelic form came down upon the earth aiming to put his feet on one foot on the sea and one upon the land so the powers that came out of the sea multitudes peoples nations and tongues right of people right and the powers that come out of the earth out of america different places you know those powers the anointing of god comes down and subdues those in your life amen that you can receive the full inheritance of god's word amen amen because because it says in revelations 10 that his feet were his pillars of fire well where are those where is the pillar of fire today it's in you right it's a new amen trip that so if so if his feet are in you if i put it there the pillars of fire the pillow fires in you then that gives you dominion over all the unclean spirits of this world i mean so we can say how dark the world is but we really should say how light the world is in terms of the illumination by the gospel of jesus christ amen that we that the that the holy ghost is no longer bound by man's creeds and traditions amen it was bound so it could just come out partially through the church ages that's why luther all they had was just shall live by faith but those who truly justify by faith they were sealed to the kingdom by the holy ghost but they but but it wasn't exactly when you read the book of acts and and compared the lutheran movement it wasn't the same because it was restoring back and then and then wesley was a bit closer second worker of grace a sanctified life right so they believe that joshua lived by faith and they are sanctified a bit closer to the book of acts but it wasn't there and then now we have the pentecostal restoration of the gifts now now the gifts of the spirit are multiplied through the earth it's a bit close to the book of acts but it's not the book of acts yet why because in the book of acts it was god living in the people not just anointing them directing him by his spirit amen where it wasn't the original book of acts there was no traditions of man mixed up with the faith of the believers right but you get to about acts 15 or 16 it says and some of the pharisees that believed on jesus said unless people become you know obey the law of moses they cannot become christians well there's there's a very big problem with that picture because the problem with that picture is these pharisees who say basically you've got to become a jew before you can become a christian and they're still calling themselves pharisees that's a problem it should really be no no no they're christians if they're really born again by the holy ghost gods burn all the traditions of man out of them there'll be no pharisee ideas lingering around so they just become part of the group that's why it's so important don't just feed off the spirit of god people can live in the atmosphere of god but not have god in them so they can enjoy the meetings they can enjoy a camp and they can and they're just living off an atmosphere and that's just a camp experience or a church experience but by monday you'll back down where you were don't just feed off an atmosphere for a time let that atmosphere come into you which is the holy ghost himself right and then when you go monday having sunday on a monday and then sunday on a tuesday and sunday on a wednesday then you have wednesday as well so you having sunday wednesday on thursday and then sunday wednesday on a friday then saturday the same thing on sunday we've got sunday wednesday sunday on a sunday and just builds hallelujah hallelujah so don't just ride an atmosphere but let that atmosphere come unto you amen praise the lord he says and feast the trumpet says while this group down here has said two thousand bound two two hundred thousand bound at the river euphrates has been bound for two thousand years also that church has been bound has bound the holy ghost nearly two thousand years under martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river euphrates but the door of creeds and dogmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems she is going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the bible said and those two meet one another on the battlegrounds lucifer and michael again like in the beginning they have been bound for two thousand years almost almost 2 000 years is from the feast of the trumpet so he's saying that it's been bound but she's going to be liberated and i'll say she's been liberated right our liberations happen i mean if you've really met god you're liberated you're free whom the son is set free is free indeed amen you're not bound by traditions or or cultural this is how i was raised these kind of understandings no we we have been loosed from those things amen to believe god and spirit and truth to worship such you say well is it possible for traditions to make the word of god no effect absolutely because jesus would say in mark 7 13 says making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things do ye see saying that your traditions remember they had the they had the law they had the law the jews had the law now the purpose of the law wasn't just them to have a you know sure a big part of it was that they would be able to access god right they could worship god their sins could be covered by the blood but moses gave very clear instruction god spoke through moses saying that if you follow my word then every man will dwell under his fig tree with his own vineyard in his own land and peace right so basically saying that whenever the enemy would come against you if you stand for my word then i'll stand for you and i will fight your battles right that was a big part of the law it wasn't just keeping ceremony but the thing is they brought in the tradition the traditions of man and they forgot there was actually power in that word and then so now they're sitting under a roman empire trying to politically say how can we keep this thing going because traditions that came in and made the word of god no effect to them because there's no power anymore in their religion right but the true but the true word has power amen when there's no tradition there there's power there's power to transform lives there's power to heal the sickness power to raise the dead there's power to break conflict complexes take fear away take trouble amen to cast demon spirits out that there be peace amen right so we don't want to allow tradition or make this message a tradition right because it can become a tradition but may it never become a tradition might always be a living word a living reality a heartfelt religion amen now we know that the angel of the lord accompanies the message always so wherever the word of god is the angel of god is there to manifest it right that it's not just us trying to fulfill it but it's him coming and anointing us that it's fulfilled in our lives now this is very important because when we realize that it's not it's actually god anointing us delivers word god inspiring us quicking us making it alive amen that it's not just us trying to fulfill it that this open door of revelation has given great power amen the revelation of the supreme death of jesus of jesus christ has given great power to you and i praise the lord i hope you're still here now brother brown would say the patmos vision he says the greatest of all revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ he says you can't get the first base until you believe that so basically says you can't even start your walk until you believe that jesus christ is the supreme deity remember god is not just some ether thing without any personality or ideas or thoughts or no his name is jesus right amen remember the highest name given is the name of the lord jesus christ amen so you can't even start your walk until you believe that i mean that's what peter said when he would when he would preach the first ever sermon there on you know yo yo the day of pentecost where he says that god has made the same jesus both lord and christ he's basically saying he's he is the supreme one amen and then he said he said repent place he said repent and see the deity be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and then you're ready to get in the spirit the first thing that you have to know is the deity of christ i'm alpha and omega i'm the a to z there's no more but me i was at the beginning i'll be at the end i am he that was which is and shall come the almighty think of it that's what the trumpet said that's what john was told in the book of revelation chapter one amen so he is not just part of god he is god hallelujah amen as isaiah would say in isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be wonderful counsel of the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace i mean where brother brown would ask a question to a to a jewish rabbi saying you know because you know he's saying oh no jesus was just a man because he read the new you know apparently we're the new testament and and then so and then so brother and ask them why would your prophets ever make a mistake i said no of course not so he asked him now well then who was who was isaiah referring to in isaiah 9 6. you know well would would messiah be god he said absolutely but then but then the rabbi said but if i you know if i preach that to my people i'll be i'll be drinking branch water eating soda crackers basically i wouldn't have any um income or employment and brother i said i'd rather be eating eating soda crackers drinking branch water and preaching the truth then then be having a big massive church somewhere see but so he could himself see that when isaiah said that that the messiah would be god himself and jesus fulfilled the requirements his life manifested that i mean so he wasn't just a man he was god made flesh amen absolutely important now brother baum says about this open door he says we can see that jesus is the door he's the door of the sheep this is from john 10 i believe and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him and that revelation is the opening is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and to glorify his name that's what revelation does it gives us spiritual strength amen when god revealed to you you're you're his son or you're his daughter that gives you strength over the enemy when you realize actually god's my father yeah my natural father and mother sure they just brought me here but god's my real father i mean it gives you strength because you realize actually this this culture doesn't define me right my natural birth doesn't even define me no the word of god defies me because god is my father it gives you strength when you realize actually i'm a son of god i don't have to put up with the devil's nonsense no more i'd have to put up with depression and pride and you know pity parties and feeling sorry for myself no it open it gives you a strength amen i trust we've had that experience i've had that experience amen and it's to illuminate the word so the word goes from just letters on a page in stories to a living reality amen and to glorify his name that's what revelation should do shouldn't it glorify his name and when god reveals saying to you it doesn't make your stuff shirt you just love him more well it glorifies his name amen it was in the midst of the last two ages that the revelation of the deity of jesus christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was god how else could he be our savior but to know that he was the only god or god alone that he was the alpha and the omega that is jesus was both lord and christ making him lord jesus christ the father the son and the holy ghost all one person it's been lost since the first church ages but now we see it again the revelation of who he was has come back indeed the godhead is not a three-person god with one personality for it takes personality to make a person if there's one personality there is but one person but they who believe in three persons have a three god godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment amen but the revelation of the godhead is back now the true church can be built in strength again after all this time she finally knows who her lord is once again we are baptizing the name of the lord jesus christ just as they did at pentecost and that's why the word builds us in strength it doesn't make us lopsided it doesn't make us wobbly and weak no it builds our character to be strong i mean it gives us a grit and a you know uh your a determination it doesn't make us jellyfish it gives you gives you a backbone like a like a saw log you know it makes us strong amen because remember those that know their god shall be strong and do exploits amen so the church is built in strength you say i'm weak today no no you're strong i'm the devil wants you to think you're weak you're strong in the lord i mean he's made you strong he hasn't made you weak hallelujah you may be going through a battle but you're still strong it doesn't matter the size of the battle you've still got a strength right hallelujah amen so we are being built in strength again that's what faith does strengthens us amen faith does not weaken us it strengthens us encourages us establishes us in the faith amen it's very very important now paul would say in hebrews 1 he says god who at sundered times in diverse manners spake and times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed air of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all the things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they then he goes and he and he differentiates between god but between christ right and between men and between angels you know he makes that very clear that that he's the expressed image of his person so he's saying that all that god was you see in christ that's why jesus said you know philip or one of them said trust the father it'll it'll satisfy us and he says have i been so long with you and you don't know me who has seen me have seen the father right so he was the image of the invisible god amen as paul would say in colossians he says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him are all things created there in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him now it's very important that we realize that god and his word are one amen you can't separate god in his word now this may be elementary but it's very powerful when we realize who's here who's here our hate ship is here brother makes it very clear in christ the mystery god revealed the headship is here right our head is here we're not looking sure we're going to meet him physically in the air but the headship of the word is here christ himself in spirit form us here right to camp off our lives amen so now it says in psalms 107 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing now we might take this and think that his word he sent his words is like you send something that's separate from you but when god sends this word it's actually himself coming to do a job amen as it says in john 1 and 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god it to me so so john here is inspired to to to write to us and say you're god's speaking through him saying now that the word is god right if you leave the word you've left god it's that symbol if you stay with the word you're staying with god if you start with the word you're walking with god but if you leave it for your own understanding where you've left god right so the word and him are one so when he sent his word and healed them he's actually coming and and bringing healing right it's not a separate you can't see break god and his word they are one and the same so when he sends his word to the earth that is god being revealed amen right down to the prophets of the old testament it was a partial revelation that's why when jesus asked the disciples who did men say that i am they said some say you're elias or jeremiah or one of the prophets and the reason they said that is because what they saw jesus do they say that reminds you of moses or that reminds you of jeremiah that reminds me of elijah because they because they saw a part of god was manifested in those prophets but all the prophets where the fullness of god had body was now in christ jesus right so so that was just a partial revelation of god down through but now we've come to the fullness of god has been made known so it's not just part of his nature part of his character it's all of him hallelujah that's why we're not just saved by faith but god comes and fills us with the holy ghost right that's why divine healing is is manifested in this day because he's a healer right we've seen redemption we've seen all that he is the prince of powers and powers in heavenly places had been made known through the through the church amen hallelujah see because many people think they they get a romantic notion if they could just go back 2 000 years ago and and walk the shores of galilee with jesus then they could really then they could really pull their hearts out to him and he could answer every question all people think if they could just go back to the time of the prophet then god would come down reveal their needs through that prophet and you know you're through brother brown's ministry because the son of man was revealed there and then they could just know everything and you know all would be well but that but but people fail to realize that that same word is here right that same god is now present in 2022. he didn't die when jesus ascended in acts 1 that wasn't the end of it that same god came and dwelt in the disciples right and when the prophet left in 65 that same mighty angel christ himself was still upon the earth gathering us to himself right so he has not he has not diminished one iota amen he has not diminished empower ability right just because his physical form that was here two thousand years ago is not here upon the earth does not make him any weaker does not make him any less able to save or to heal or redeem or answer questions or bring peace he's still the same god because he and his word are one so i can say wherever his word is the angel lord is there to confirm that word then he is right here because he is his word right that same god is right pray you know i think if we could just really open our spiritual understanding and see the one that moves in our services right the one that comes to camp with us and this is around the world wherever wherever the children of god are god begins to move the anointing begins to fall that's that same one it's as if jesus literally walked in the room in the physical form right because it's the same god that's like that you're the one with the blood or she's saying if i just touch the hem of his garment i can be made whole we can still touch the hem of his garment by faith hallelujah he's still the same god just like blind bartimaeus called out them with his faith that made him stand still we can still make him stand still and meet our need as he's walking through this age praise the lord amen we can pour our hearts out to him right now and he can answer us exactly like he did in the days of his flesh praise to god because remember remember he praise the lord because he is his word now gentile faith realizes this there is a centurion that had a sick servant listen this is matthew 8 i won't i won't read it just to save a bit of time but you know jesus jesus was was approached by the centurion and the centurion says i've got a sick i've got a sick servant you know he's at home and jesus says you know i'll go i'll go and heal him yeah i'll come he because he's graviously tormented with palsy but then the centurion said i'm not worthy that you should come under my roof right but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed because i'm a man under authority and i call someone he goes here i call someone else he goes there and so you know but you know so so because i can see the authority that that i have you have in a far greater measure you just speak the word and it will be so and jesus heard it and he marveled saying i've not seen faith like there's no not in israel because the roman centurion realized that he actually recognized the supreme deity of jesus christ and that that's what brother that's what brother bram said in blind bartimaeus he said what was that roman doing he was recognizing the supreme deity of jesus christ i mean because he realized that jesus words had power absolute power that's what said you don't physically need to come and put your hands upon my servant and say be well but just speak the word only and he had gentile faith because he realized that jesus speaking his word or jesus sending his word was exactly the same as if jesus physically walked into his house physically laid hands upon the servant physically prayed for him and then physically walked away so jesus sending his word is exactly the same as if he steps into this room right lays his hands upon you talks to you says you're going to be well that's exactly the same he doesn't physically need to come here and do it because he sent his word and he and his word are exactly the same being amen so god has sent his word and it will accomplish that which is sent to do amen so if he sent his word and he says i'm going to have a bride made in my image i mean she's going to be made in his image he's going to be made in the image of the world amen so now you say well i'm sick well he but he sent his word and he healed them all and we can realize the very god amen because he is his word he sent a word upon the earth and that and that word to us is not condemnation that word is not judgment that word is not destruction that word is salvation it's deliverance it's healing it's identity amen and just as that centurion was a man under his ship because to be a man in authority you're going to be a man under authority man or woman right so so to be in authority you're going to be under authority right so if you're under your own authority you're not going to have any authority right but if you're under the authority of the word of god then you'll have the authority of the word of god right and then no enemy can stand before you hallelujah because to be in authority you've got to be under authority i mean so the centurion was under authority and he was in authority because he was under the authority but it was just an authority of a roman government but he realized that jesus had authority that was far greater than him and his word had absolute power and i pray if we can just grasp that today he says i've got a need but he sent his word amen to heal he sent his word to deliver you say well i don't know the answers to this problem you don't need to know the answer or how it's going to happen i mean here's the answer as long as you know the one who is the answer then then the answer will come because jesus is the answer to every question amen so this so this centurion recognized the supreme deity of jesus christ amen that's why that's why i said just but speak the word and my servant will live and that's why it's so important in the service are you reading the word listening to the mess say lord speak to me you know my need but speak to me release your word to me that becomes such a reality amen amen hallelujah and jesus had never seen faith like that in israel i mean more than more than dries more than anyone there he but that was gentile faith amen and that faith i believe is living in our hearts amen amen he was he was demonstrating gentile faith and his attitude was right his attitude was that jesus had supreme authority or has his supreme authority over sickness and he believed and agreed what jesus said it's so important that we agree with the word you want you want the power of god to flow through your life agree with his word you don't agree you don't have to grab my humanity but agree with his word right i agree with his word amen because it says in in romans 8 and 16 that the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god so now if your spirit bears witness with him there's an agreement right and and and that declares that you're a child of god so there's something in your spirit that doesn't agree with the word you've got the wrong spirit right because that that bearing witness is if you truly have the holy ghost you'll say amen to every word irrespective of it makes you happy sad or glad or mad or whatever whatever it does you know it might tear strips off your back it may shake you tip you up and shake you upside down yeah but you'll say amen right if you've got the right spirit but if you don't have the right spirit then you'll kick against it but the reason but but the only way you can have the right spirit is if you have the holy spirit within you right remember our devil will never say amen to the word he'll never say preach it in glory and hallelujah i'm so glad no a demon spirit will never say that if i said no that's not true it's not for you it cannot be so that's not right no that's for another age that's an unclean spirit speaking there but the spirit of god will say amen remember it's not just no it's not just anointed preaching it's anointed it's anointed pews i mean there's not just anointed worship man there's a noise that worship is everywhere i mean we're all part of this together we all come and create an atmosphere hallelujah amen just like you know the girls have been on the word sometimes and gabe's i'm like you know you know this lilian and and i'll say gabe just be a worshiper in the pew that's more important let's create an atmosphere hey little girls can create atmospheres they can they can change your whole world zone raise their hands and praise god and spirit of god can fall upon you amen so we're not just here to sing this is not singing this is worship giving a spiritual sacrifice to god and god come down and inhabit our praise and break the yoke of the enemy and change lives hallelujah so our spirit must bear witness with his lord amen that we are the children of god so if something and he disagrees with the word you have the wrong spirit that's just as plain as i can say it now brother braham says in the interval he says oh man what's the matter with you if you're a child of god your spirit will say god's word is right and you'll live that kind of a life to back it up jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe that's right and my name i shall cast out devil so forth and heal the sick and do things today you say them days of miracles is past look where you're living there you are don't take an intellectual take an experience with god when your experience agrees with this bible and every word is true your jehovah my spirit bearing record with his spirit yours we're sons and daughters of god and we've passed from death unto life it's true amen someone can say something to you real harshly you know just take the truth of what they're saying right if there's truth in there take it on board sometimes we've got to really sift through it but if there's truth in there take it on board right don't just throw the whole thing away because you didn't appreciate how we said sure we could we should say things in love so don't get me wrong but you got you want to take the truth out of whatever it says right that's what we're going to do amen now we live in an hour where the full word has come into manifestation right this is this is not alien to us right when christ opened the seals open the book of redemption brother ram says in the breach he says you know you know he's reading the portion where he says you know a strong eye um angel cried who's worthy to open the book and brother says maybe i'm just feeling this way but let him come forth now and open the book so it was an event those sermons were actually an event taking place he said i was praying all day and then he came to me in the room he says i was you know came with the understanding i was about to come with the understanding i had then he came into the room and actually showed me what it was right so now what's happening now is as that book is actually christ being revealed right everything it was everything adam lost is now coming to the possession of the believer so it's christ being may be made known brother it said that the opening of those seals is revealing christ right so now when the word comes open there's a power released through that word right but the amount of word that's open gives a certain amount of power now we read there in hebrews 1 that he upholds all things by the word of his power that's verse three so it says the word of his power not the power of his word the word of his power so when his word is released there's a power associated with that word so now for example moses moses brought the law that was a part of the word it was only under the blood of bulls and goats so there was not a power in there to transform a heart from unbelief to faith right it could not change it could not take sin nature out but it gave them overcoming power if they stayed with it to defeat their enemies right so there was a certain amount of power in it that's why david was anointed he could kill a lion a bear and goliath that's why the mighty men who gave themselves to david did the exploits they did it was supernatural things right because there was power with that word but there wasn't a full measure you know because it was just one under the blood of bulls and ghosts and two it was just a portion of the word right now we can go through the prophets and show that but let's just go all the way down now when jesus came he was the fullness of the word right so so in him he you know he breathed on the disciples said receive you the holy ghost so now the one that was prophesied of coming in the ultimate god indwelling a people right he's saying now now you can receive it because his blood was shed right and then they went to the upper room and because he released the word you know full measure for that day right the power of god came into the people that they weren't just trying to adhere to a law but never being able to live it but that god would come into a people and then his life in them would actually fulfill the law right so they did not just have to say you know it wasn't in their mind oh i shall not covet lord help me not to covet you know oh but my neighbor's got this and you know because in the law they were told thou shall not but they didn't have a power and ability to actually fulfill it because they were fallen man still even though they were god's chosen people but now when the spirit of god came in on the day of pentecost then god came in and then there's a thou shall not covet well that's gone out of them right if they say surrender to the holy ghost within them then there's no coveting amen right you see there was a power there but the thing is god knew that the church would go from a quick manifestation of maturity in the book of acts and eventually it would die and go down to the dark ages to to come forth again right there had to be a death burial resurrection of the church itself as jesus would say you know when the greeks came said sirs we would see jesus and jesus would say well unless a corn of wheat dies goes into the ground and dies it'll abide alone if it comes forth it'll bring forth much fruit so so they were like confused because they wanted to see god and and and this is the answer they got but but they they were being told he was he was telling them that unless actually i go to calvary i die and i come forth again then my life comes into you you'll never see god because it takes god to come in for you actually to see him hallelujah right because because jesus said the world seeth me no more but you shall see me right so the world does not see him but the believer shall see him and that's why people on the street say where is jesus we say well we see him right because he's in us he's working us he's fulfilling his word he's gathering a people we see jesus i trust when you look at one another you say i see jesus right i see his word we can discern the lord's body and say i see jesus amen so now and then and then even the name of the first age of of ephesus and the greek it means to aim at and to relax so they aimed at the high calling in christ you read um ephesians 4 we won't go into it now but but but the apostle paul was saying he gave the five-fold ministry till we all come to the fullness of the statue of christ this is this is chapter 11. so he's saying he's saying in chapter one you've received the holy ghost you know you've been born again but we're going to grow we're to be perfected not not a sinless perfection but a maturity right because the blood perfects us sin what we're sinless say he became me that i become him by his grace so he became sin who knew no sin that i become the righteousness of god through christ that's scripture right so we're going to believe that amen we should walk you know it should be our living testimony he became me that i become him praise god the thing is so so so they aimed at the high calling but then they relax so so then and then even even when the church ages started you read there in uh revelations too am i going too far shall i go down to second gear are we going to go up the hill let's keep going okay so in in revelations 2 it says but remember from where you have fallen speaking of the ephesian age they had already fallen from their first love right and what caused the fall is that the pharisees came in like i said in acts 15 they said they're christians but they're not they brought contention among the church and instead of the believers actually overcoming that and staying in their first love it dragged them down that's why we should never let arguments and fussing and fighting drag us down from our first love right those things will come do you think the devil wants us to walk in joy the devil wants no one happy that's why there's a mental health crisis in this world he does not want anyone happy he wants them broken discontented trying to live in some fantasy world to escape reality but god wants us to be happy he wants happy christians amen amen that's what he wants he wants us to be happy that doesn't mean we'll we won't have trouble but he wants you to be happy praise god i'm glad aren't you glad you know so to be all like isolated and all like tense and stuff that's not being spiritual no but to have joy of the lord and to be able to walk among anyone and and still know who you are and be a living witness that's that's actually being spiritual jesus did not get all funny and you know isolated and things at all it's more spiritual to be a wife no no he went among everyone but it didn't rub off on him he rubbed off on them see so we've got to rub off on everyone don't let them rub off on you amen praise the lord so so so the church went down into a dark age we know that the truth was literally locked locked away in the catholic church you know that couldn't read the bible nothing but then they but then the uh revel uh reformation started to come because there's a resurrection coming forth now and then finally we've come to this age i'm just going to jump ahead a bit but you see that's when the uh in the philadelphian age which is the age before this one there's an open door opening of revelation to give the church strength right so now there's a restoration of the gifts but then god had to restore his word to bring a full strength into the church right that's why he said elijah at the end time that we would not just continue the cycle of revival and death why because you look through church history you see church history with the book of judges it's basically the same thing they come and possess the land then they fall into idolatry it's a cycle and then and then and they call out to god god sends a revival and then they walk in victory again but then they fall into idolatry again and then the cycle repeats it's a cycle of revival and death but now there had to come a word that would bring a power that would break that cycle right that it wouldn't just perpetuate that it's the all right praise the lord we're having a revival then we go down to death then we organize no god ordained that the cycle would be broken and that's why that's why in revelations 10 when when when when the seven thunders uttered their voices john was about to write but he was sold right at not it's sealed to the time of the end yeah right so in those seven thunders is a power to break that cycle of revival and death that we wouldn't just come back to the ephesian age again and aim at but relax right but we would aim it and become right because remember we can only live by the anointing that is here that's why the martyrs in the dark ages they are anointed to give their lives that's all they could do right they gladly went to the arena or were tortured or saw an asunder a great horrible death but they are anointed it wasn't them physically saying out of stubbornness it wasn't human stubbornness that made them become martyrs no they were anointed under the ox sacrificial anointing of the holy ghost to give their lives right and then you come into the age of sardis with martin luther and things as the man man anointing great wisdom they translate the bible knew many different languages they were anointed to do that that's the only thing they could do they were anointed that way and then we're coming to this age now in this age we are not under the man age anointing we're under the eagle anointing amen right so now you can only live by the anointing that you're under right you are you can only live by that anointing so if you're under the eagle anointing you're lifted up above the things of this world you can see things for what they are what the other four the other three anointings of the lion the ox and the man they're all land-based creatures right the flying eagles the only one that actually get lift off and you can look further right so when something comes upon the land we don't get caught up in it right if it's if it's black lives matter coronavirus whatever conspiracy flat earth whatever's trended or trending we have an eagle anointing that lifts us up and we can see that thing and say that's just another distraction let's keep flying that's just another distraction that's not going to help me none that thing down there now let's just let's just go higher i want to go towards the sun i want to go towards the so when i want to go above the storm right because we're living in an age of so many distractions and voices but if you're really under the holy ghost in this age you'll be lifted up all above those things hallelujah so now john said don't don't write what the seven thunders say because it's for the time of the end then so the prophet comes malachi 4 comes and he's given the commission to go and you know the seven seals are going to be opened and remember in revelation there is supernatural power released in revelation so when the seals come open which brother rams asks is that the seven thunders or not he says no i mean he says yes it's the revelation of the seven thunders is the seals right so through that ministry god released a power upon the earth that there be a people now that would break the cycle of revival and death they wouldn't just have revival and die and get cold lukewarm formal and powerless but they would stay in revival until god takes them home hallelujah and we're living in that hour right now i'm saying this is not coming this is here i mean when the when this message found you supernaturally god was releasing a power into your life to break the cycle of revival and death i mean that you will stay in revival you will not go down unto death i mean nothing the devil does against you no no argument no fussing no fighting no stewing no trouble will drag you down back to where it wants to drag you down because that's what causes death as fussing and fighting and fractions and walls and trouble and whatever more no we're anointed not to do that hallelujah we're anointed to go beyond that that we can actually stay in revival remember you can only live by the anointing you're under this is not us saying i'm sick of that time we're going to have a different season no this is god saying this there is power in the open world to cause us that the cycle of revival and death will be broken amen some people told me a while ten years ago this will just last three years three and a half years i said no no it's burning on it's burning off because we don't have a man-made tank of oil man-made tank of natural ability and just enthusiasm we are connected to the great gusher of the holy ghost oil himself and he's pouring through every member giving illumination of the word and every heart and it's not going to stop amen it cannot stop because it's god that means that's why i say that in this hour every power and principality i didn't even touch it but we'll get to it maybe later every power and principality in heavenly places having me has been made known through the church because we're living in a season of revival not jesus death what is revival when an awakening to who you are right it's an awakening do you realize who you are not what you will not what you know it's who you are not who you were when you realize who you are it changes your thinking oh yes right yeah yeah i'm sure my dad will see this i love him but you know we're dna tests he had a dna test done now he's from south africa i share this with the youth you know he's from south africa he's from cape town he always said growing up we're english you know even though he can trace part of his forebears back to the original dutch settler families in the cape and different things and he's no no we're english he gets a dna test he has no english blood in him at all sure he's got irish scottish and welsh but in the uk that's a very different thing to english you know we may think it's all the same but no no it ain't the same but he's mainly scandinavian he's got jewish the balkans he's got a bitter asian a bit of indian enemies got all kinds of things but when he got that dna results back the results of his i could say well his dna it made him think differently about himself right so now we can think about ourselves one way but then when the test comes back what we begin to think about ourselves very differently hallelujah it's like you know there's been people who've been neo-nazis in germany they find out they're jewish they become jewish right so their environment conditioned them to be neo-nazis but then they got a test done they got a test and say actually in my veins is jewish blood and then so their identity they always were jewish but an awakening had to happen for them to realize i'm actually i'm a jew i'm not a neo-nazi right so it's the same thing with you and i when the test comes back and you begin to realize that my dna now i'm not talking about this guy i'm talking about this guy right when you realize your true dna is not based on your lineage but your true dna is from heaven i mean it makes you begin to think differently about yourself and it makes you think differently about other people right because grace can only be extended if it's been received right you cannot give grace you cannot give forgiveness or pardon or anything unless you've received it but then when he when he gives you grace he opens your eyes as an awakening you're part of me you're from heaven so your whole mind changes it changes your thinking about the country you live in where world events are going changes you think about you it changed your thing about the devil because it once yeah it used to be once upon a time that he'd come and whisper in your ear and you'd just listen all day that was a it was a hands-free call all the day you know good know i'm unhappy i don't feel like this and there's a devil in your ear but then when but then god opens your eyes he said no satan you're not my boss depression is not my boss anxiety is not my boss you know whatever it may be depression suicide anxiety trouble stress none of those things are my boss because the test came back and i'm from somewhere else and you're ordained because remember if you realize who you are then you realize who the enemy is right and you realize who your father is right so it's not just you realize who god isn't who you are you realize who the enemy is and his position right because if we've been elevated to be joining us with christ he's under your feet right but you've got to put him under your feet it's not just something that happens by us moses you've got to speak to your enemy you've got to address him and you've got to tell him where to go and not just please mr devil no you've got to command him because if we're under authority we have authority right in the authority of supreme deity which is jesus christ we have supreme authority not power but authority just like a policeman you can get the smallest policemen in existence right and they can be a scrawny thing you can basically just flick them over but when they put that badge on the head on and they you know they're in the uniform all of the state is behind them the authority of the state is behind them and if you go against their orders you can get arrested physically it doesn't matter their stature but the authority that they carry now we carry the authority of the badge of a believer right but we've got to actually put it into action we can't just sit back and say someone else will do it no you know there's a there's a um there's a uh what is it called whatever it's called it'll come to me maybe tomorrow but there's a yeah phenomena i'll put it that way it's a it's a human psychology thing that that if if someone comes across an accident and there's no one else around they will intervene you know some people maybe not but like vast majority will intervene but if there's a crowd there they will think someone else will take care of it that's actually a psychological thing now we can't be like that if the crowd's around we've got to be if we see a problem we've got to deal with it we can't say someone else will pray or someone else will do it no no we need to go before the throne of grace right we need to call one one one amen the real one one i'm talking about spiritual things now you understand so it's not just our brother so-and-so sister son so no what about you and i yeah what about us we can't just get under that conditioning someone else will pray or someone else or labor or no what about you and i yes lord there's a need if grace has been received then grace can be extended the powers of heaven can be extended to someone else i'm just going to close with that but i trust you've had the test what i trust he's revealed to you the results amen you come from god you go back to god hallelujah the powers of god has been released in this age to break the cycle of revival and death that's why you know people come against the mess and say there's nothing to it i said hold on you've come too late i've seen him move i've seen him do incredible things i've seen him promise what he promised he would do it's not just it see it's no lie it's good to testify of what happened in brother brown's life with jesus christ but really in reality we don't even don't get me wrong we have our own testimony we have our own testimony it's good to relate his testimonies we should but it but it's not just well god lived back there now where has he gone i don't know we're waiting for him to come no that same god lives here that same god manifests his word here in our lives right real handship is actually a personal wait this just we have the sorry hallelujah i just i'm about to close he says now therefore it's the word see egypt is the word right now say he the word how do you know it's right he the word is vindicated he the word properly vindicated as the headship the headship of the church his word is the headship he is probably identified vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing for themself and vindication is a direct proof to the entire body you don't need creeds then denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identification see identifying themselves proves the headship to the body then we are united under one vindicated headship which is christ the word of god not under a church what is personal uh vindications or personal identifications is when he reveals his word to you and it lives glory right that's a personal vindication right so that's the proof that you're under the headship of the word as one your spirit bears witness completely with it right and you see his word living out of you he proves his word in your life right and maybe we'll go into that next time but um can the musicians come this morning i think we can rejoice amen we're not just looking for god to do something he's doing a lot i mean he's pouring himself out changing our lives hallelujah amen praise the lord amen hallelujah let's um let's stand let's um let's sing that let's sing that
