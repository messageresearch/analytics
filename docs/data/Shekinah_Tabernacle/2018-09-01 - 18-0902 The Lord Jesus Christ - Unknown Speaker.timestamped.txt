[40:34] let's turn to the book of Exodus forgot
[40:39] the slideshow here
[40:58] let's read he Exodus six and in verse
[41:01] one two three
[41:08] is
[41:11] in the Lord said unto Moses how shall
[41:15] down there now shalt thou see what I
[41:18] will do to Pharaoh for with a strong
[41:20] hand shall he let him go and with a
[41:24] strong hand shall he drive them out of
[41:26] his land and God spake unto Moses and
[41:29] said unto him I am the Lord and I
[41:32] appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac and
[41:34] unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty
[41:36] but by my name Jehovah was I not known
[41:41] to them amen licious bow heads in a the
[41:45] wood of Korea the old gracious father so
[41:49] thankful we have a human to go to Lord
[41:53] we have an eternal promise of a father
[41:55] we just want to commit the service into
[41:57] your hands lord I just pray father that
[41:59] you will anoint a speaker and here are
[42:01] one more time father may your word find
[42:04] prepared ground in our hearts Lord to
[42:06] bring forth a hundredfold Lord of your
[42:08] life we just pray you'd be with those
[42:10] who couldn't make it today father be
[42:12] their portion as well Lord may you just
[42:15] have preeminence in this service Lord we
[42:17] just want to glorify you lift you up
[42:20] Lord to worship and praise you father
[42:23] may you grant it Lord forgive us of our
[42:24] sons our iniquities our trespasses Lord
[42:27] may our whole lives be under your blood
[42:29] father in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[42:31] amen amen god bless you friends you may
[42:34] have your seats this morning now I want
[42:37] to I spoke along these lines a few years
[42:41] ago and I'm not repeating exactly what I
[42:43] what I said but I want to show that you
[42:46] know brother Branham he makes a
[42:47] statement that and we'll read this from
[42:51] the get-go where he sees this he sees
[42:55] now what is it now this is from river
[42:58] from the Patmos vision it's somebody
[43:01] approaching a great one approaching
[43:02] trumpet sounds someone's coming he
[43:05] looked hallelujah trumpet saying I am
[43:07] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[43:10] he says not announcement of the second
[43:14] party or the third party but the only
[43:16] party I'm both Alpha and Omega before I
[43:19] show you anything I want you to know who
[43:22] I am I mean the greatest of all river
[43:25] is the deity the supreme deity of our
[43:28] Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first
[43:31] base until you believe that walk out
[43:34] what's that Peter said repent in be and
[43:36] then see the deity be baptized in the
[43:38] name of Jesus Christ remission of sins
[43:40] and then you're ready to go in the
[43:42] spirit the first thing you have to know
[43:45] is the deity of Christ I am Alpha and
[43:48] Omega
[43:48] I'm from A to Z there's no more but me I
[43:51] was at the beginning I'll be at the end
[43:54] I'm he that was which is and shall come
[43:57] the Almighty so it is absolutely
[44:00] essential that we do not make our Lord
[44:03] Jesus Christ the second person of
[44:05] eternity I mean or there's no to Lourdes
[44:08] there's one Lord the LORD thy God is one
[44:11] Lord amen so it's essential that we have
[44:14] a revelation that our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:17] is the Supreme God I mean there's no
[44:20] other God beside of there's no other
[44:21] Savior but him I mean that we must have
[44:24] this anchored into our hearts because
[44:26] because the thing is that people as we
[44:30] read last last week from the book of
[44:31] Jude as they deny the only Lord God our
[44:34] Lord Jesus Christ and a big part of that
[44:37] as they deny his word because he and his
[44:39] word is one as well it's essential that
[44:42] we have this together so you know I want
[44:44] to show you from the scripture and we
[44:47] have gone through this before but I you
[44:49] know this message exalts Jesus Christ to
[44:52] his to where he should be this message
[44:55] is a Bible message is not a another
[44:57] message it's not something outside the
[45:00] Bible it reveals Jesus Christ in the
[45:02] scripture I met in a big part of you
[45:05] know of the endtime restoration of the
[45:08] truth of the word is that Jesus Christ
[45:10] is the Almighty God manifested right
[45:13] it's very very vital that we understand
[45:16] that he's not the second person or the
[45:18] third person there's not three people in
[45:20] the Godhead right we don't worship three
[45:22] gods that's a heathen idea amen that's
[45:24] an idolatrous idea I mean that is
[45:27] heathen absolutely God is one hallelujah
[45:31] and in order to be a person you know
[45:33] people say three persons and they
[45:35] Godhead you have to be a separate I did
[45:37] there
[45:38] personality there's more than three
[45:40] people in this room but he is one and he
[45:44] has manifested in a sign Christ Jesus
[45:46] that was made right so now we read here
[45:49] that God God did was not knoin and we're
[45:54] and and we're gonna go on to this then
[45:56] what happens is all through the Bible
[45:58] God reveals a part of himself he's
[46:00] revealing a part of himself all the way
[46:02] down through and then I'm going to come
[46:04] down to the end and say well now that
[46:05] will be manifested in you because of
[46:07] what let's just summarize us women right
[46:09] now if we are called by his name right
[46:12] if we are the family of God in the life
[46:15] that was in him is now on us right
[46:17] we're not manifesting our natural family
[46:19] our first birth but if we walk according
[46:22] to the spirit
[46:23] we are manifesting his life right so
[46:25] everything that was in him is now
[46:27] reflected in us amen and we'll come to
[46:30] that so now we read here in Zachariah
[46:34] here Zechariah 14 and 9 and the Lord
[46:38] shall be king over all the earth and
[46:40] that day there shall be one Lord and his
[46:44] name one right he won't be divided into
[46:47] three or into two some people in the
[46:48] message make him to lords there's one
[46:50] Lord right his name shall be one so
[46:53] shall be shall be one name now we read
[46:57] here I'm just going to go through so so
[46:59] an ex for season and an IIST the high
[47:04] priest Caiaphas is and John and
[47:06] Alexander and as were many as we're the
[47:08] Kindred of the high priest were gathered
[47:10] together at Jerusalem and when they had
[47:12] set them in the midst they asked by what
[47:15] power or by what name have you done this
[47:18] then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:20] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[47:22] and elders of Israel if we have this
[47:26] they be examined of the good deed done
[47:28] to then the impotent man by what means
[47:31] he has made whole be it known unto you
[47:34] all that and to all people of Israel
[47:36] that by the name of Jesus Christ of
[47:38] Nazareth Nazareth whom you crucified
[47:39] whom God raised from the dead even by
[47:43] him doth this man stand here before you
[47:46] whole so there's a power in the name of
[47:48] Jesus that gave the man has his ability
[47:51] to walk again
[47:51] now a name represents a life now we're
[47:55] just going to go through this and may
[47:56] you know just just just pull with me I
[47:59] want him to be exalted right I don't
[48:02] want you know the Bible declares he is
[48:05] the supreme one the the quote reread
[48:08] brother Brown was quoting from
[48:09] revelations chapter 1 he says I am The
[48:11] Almighty God I am the Alpha and the
[48:13] Omega
[48:14] amen and he said if you were first he's
[48:16] you know declare who he is and he's
[48:18] going to show you his plan of redemption
[48:20] amen so first Samuel 25 over 25 this is
[48:23] this is Abigail interceding for her
[48:26] husband unable it says let not my lord I
[48:31] pray thee regardless man of Belial even
[48:33] Abel for for as his neighbors so as he
[48:36] Nabal as his name and folly is with him
[48:39] but I thy handmaid saw not the young men
[48:43] of my Lord whom now did a sin so now she
[48:47] is saying that his name is Mabel and so
[48:49] he is now enabled it means stupid or a
[48:53] wicked person so he was a man effect so
[48:56] so how he treated David and David
[48:58] servants was actually a manifestation of
[49:00] his name right and it's just like Jacob
[49:03] and the Bible so so as I see it a name
[49:07] in the Bible is extremely important
[49:08] because the life the character the
[49:11] nature of that person is expressed in
[49:12] their name right Jacob means supplanter
[49:15] and he was he supplied to thee story he
[49:18] he tricked us father lure out of you
[49:20] know many different cattle of different
[49:22] things he you know pulled all these
[49:23] shady deals because that was he was a
[49:25] manifestation of his name but then his
[49:28] name was changed right when he wrestled
[49:30] with the angel his name was changed from
[49:32] Jacob to Israel and prints with God
[49:34] right Sarah Abraham's wife Sarai her
[49:39] name was changed to Sarah now Sarah SAR
[49:42] AI her her original name means the
[49:46] motive means a hit person so she was out
[49:49] of her place she is manifesting her and
[49:51] that's why she said to Abraham take take
[49:53] Hagar and fulfill the promise she was
[49:55] actually trying to be the spiritual head
[49:57] of the whole move right but then her
[49:59] name was changed to be a princess Sarah
[50:02] means princess so she came into her
[50:04] position
[50:05] hallelujah and her name change
[50:07] represented that and then after her name
[50:09] was changed to Sarah then she had Isaac
[50:12] hallelujah so now through the scripture
[50:15] it's the same God revealing himself it's
[50:19] not a different one it's the same one
[50:20] so the God of the Old Testament is God
[50:22] our than you amen so it's the same one
[50:26] now God unfolds himself through
[50:30] Scripture and he does this by by
[50:33] changing his name right and what he's
[50:36] going to do in the day now in which we
[50:38] live is declared in his name now I want
[50:43] to do this because as I see it now the
[50:45] message restores the truth of the
[50:47] scripture it takes away man's Creed's
[50:50] and man's ideas and brings back the
[50:52] truth of the scripture because jesus
[50:54] said by teaching the commandments and
[50:56] doctrines of men you make the Word of
[50:58] God no effect to the people and the
[51:00] effect of the law and Jesus as they
[51:03] should have been they dwelling in their
[51:04] land
[51:05] no Romans or anything over them then
[51:08] dwelling with God amen possessing the
[51:10] full of severe inheritance
[51:12] I mean dwelling in peace with their God
[51:14] that's what the law should have produced
[51:15] when they were in the land that's what
[51:17] it should have produced but it didn't
[51:19] produce it causes because they brought
[51:20] in man's ideas man's Creed's man's
[51:22] tradition and it made the Word of God no
[51:24] effect right so now if the truth of the
[51:27] scripture is restored then the power of
[51:30] the Cross will be manifested in the
[51:31] believer that receives it right there
[51:33] they're overcoming power will be
[51:35] manifested in their lives they will not
[51:38] just be talking about it they will
[51:39] possess and will manifest the life that
[51:42] was in Jesus Christ will be in them
[51:45] hallelujah that's why it's very
[51:46] important that's why the message is
[51:48] vital because it takes away man's
[51:49] Crete's and it places the word as it
[51:52] should be placed
[51:53] hallelujah part of the Ministry of
[51:55] Elijah the you know you know when Elijah
[51:58] was out on on Mount Carmel you read it
[52:00] he rebuilt the altar a little bit had
[52:02] fallen down so stones that were
[52:04] neglected parts of the word that were
[52:06] neglected and had been set aside for a
[52:09] man-made altar I mean he rebuilt it and
[52:12] then he put the sacrifice on with the
[52:14] wood and the and the water and then God
[52:16] received that sacrifice the fire came
[52:18] down
[52:19] I mean that was the evidence that the
[52:21] altar was correct is because the fire
[52:23] came down and it's the same thing with
[52:25] you and I I mean when God receives our
[52:27] faith then the fire comes down then as
[52:29] Holy Spirit comes down and dwells in us
[52:32] hallelujah
[52:33] that's very important now we read that
[52:36] the greatest he says you can't get the
[52:38] first base until you believe that he's
[52:40] the supreme one oh yeah now this is a
[52:48] principle of the scripture he saith unto
[52:51] him I mean say Thunder dear me Jesus
[52:54] speaking to his disciples but whom say
[52:57] ye that I am and Simon Peter answered
[52:59] said thou art the Christ the Son of the
[53:00] Living God and jesus answered and said
[53:02] unto him blessed art thou simon barjona
[53:04] for flesh and blood has not revealed it
[53:06] unto thee but my father which is in
[53:08] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[53:11] Peter and upon this rock I'll build my
[53:13] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[53:15] prevail against it and I'll give unto
[53:17] thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[53:19] whilst ever thou shalt bind on earth
[53:20] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[53:22] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[53:24] loosed in heaven so the the rock that
[53:27] the church is built upon is the
[53:29] spiritual revelation of who he is who
[53:32] Jesus Christ is in his season this may
[53:35] be he say why are you going through
[53:36] these things because it's absolutely
[53:38] vital I mean because when the enemy
[53:40] comes and what's the first thing that
[53:42] devil does puts questions on the word
[53:44] and then you become a Trinitarian right
[53:47] because man's ideas they try and worked
[53:50] out who God was God's not known by study
[53:52] God's known by revelation where you read
[53:54] the word and then he he anoints that
[53:57] what you read any places that how it
[53:59] should be place where he reveals himself
[54:02] right so it is the the church is built
[54:05] upon the spiritual revelation of who
[54:07] Jesus Christ is who he is he is his word
[54:11] right he is his word so it's vital he is
[54:15] not a third person or a second person
[54:17] the Bible says that the fullness of the
[54:20] Godhead was in him burn him throughout
[54:22] the fullness of the Godhead bodily the
[54:24] Bible never says he was part of the
[54:26] Godhead never says he is third part of
[54:29] the God is is the fullness of God in
[54:30] Bali guava
[54:32] Braham says all that God poured into
[54:34] Christ all of himself he emptied into
[54:36] Christ then Christ has been poured into
[54:38] the church
[54:40] Allu you now let's go let's go to Exodus
[54:46] 3 and then we're gonna go to Genesis 1
[54:47] but I want to lay out these principles
[54:49] here and Moses said unto God behold when
[54:52] I come unto the children of Israel and
[54:54] say unto them the law I mean the God of
[54:55] your father's has sent me unto you and
[54:57] they shall say to me what is his name
[55:01] what shall I say unto them and God said
[55:04] unto Moses I am that I am and he said
[55:08] thus shalt thou say to the children of
[55:10] Israel I am hath sent me unto you she's
[55:13] saying that I am the present god I am
[55:15] NOT that I was or other I will be I am
[55:18] he comes the present one to fulfill the
[55:21] promise now let's go to okay so I just
[55:26] want to load it so he's the same
[55:27] yesterday today and forever
[55:29] everything God was he still the same but
[55:32] Jesus Christ is present and his people
[55:34] right just like he was on the day on the
[55:38] days when he walked on the shores of
[55:39] Galilee but he's not in that body
[55:41] anymore yes right their bodies on the
[55:44] right hand of God making intercession
[55:45] he's he's still our high priest right we
[55:48] will meet that body in the air right but
[55:50] his spirits upon the earth so everything
[55:52] that was in the man of Galilee is now in
[55:54] the Bride of Christ because that same
[55:56] life that same spirit the same anointing
[55:58] that same living word is now in them
[56:01] okay so now Genesis 1 in the beginning
[56:05] God created the heaven and the earth
[56:08] okay now that word God means the self
[56:13] existing one okay we you know we just
[56:17] read English the word god there's Elohim
[56:20] which is the which is the self existing
[56:23] one right and then now we go to we got
[56:30] there Genesis 2 and for these are the
[56:32] generations of the heavens and of the
[56:33] earth when they were created in the day
[56:35] that the Lord God made heavens and earth
[56:37] now so God you read Genesis what it says
[56:40] in God created and God said and God said
[56:42] but then when man's about to come into
[56:44] the scene it says and the Lord God
[56:45] because now God is the same God it's not
[56:48] to different gods it's not God made
[56:49] everything now the Lord God's going to
[56:51] deal with his children now it's the same
[56:52] God right unfolding himself making
[56:54] himself knowing okay so now when we read
[56:58] here in Genesis 6 and it says the Lord
[57:01] God now capital L OID it means Jehovah
[57:06] so the primary meaning of the name Lord
[57:09] which is Jehovah is the self existing
[57:12] one which we read about in Exodus 3 and
[57:16] 14 he that is who he is
[57:19] therefore the eternal I am but however
[57:22] from which Jehovah or Yahweh is formed
[57:25] signifies also to become that is to
[57:28] become known thus pointing to a
[57:30] continuous and increasing self
[57:32] revelation compiled combining these
[57:35] meanings of however we arrive at the
[57:37] meaning of the name Jehovah is the self
[57:40] existing one who reveals himself I mean
[57:43] so it is a advance upon the name of God
[57:47] of Elohim which suggests certain
[57:49] attributes of deity such as strength I
[57:52] mean rather than his essential being
[57:56] right so he's saying now he's he's this
[57:59] one he's now his Lord God he's the self
[58:03] existing one who now reveals himself I
[58:06] mean so he didn't he didn't have when he
[58:09] had animals upon the earth he couldn't
[58:11] reveal himself to them he had to put
[58:14] some on the earth that was made in his
[58:16] image that he could make himself known
[58:17] to Allu you so the same God now it's the
[58:22] same God right are you with me we're all
[58:25] following it so yep so and then now
[58:28] we're gonna go into the life of Abraham
[58:31] God God met Abraham many times but
[58:34] Abraham knew it was the same God okay
[58:38] now the Lord said unto Abraham which
[58:40] which became Abraham get the out of thy
[58:42] country and from thy kindred and from my
[58:46] father's house unto a land that I will
[58:48] show thee now we see this is capital L
[58:51] Ord
[58:51] which is Jehovah right I want you to
[58:54] hold that in your mind and when we come
[58:55] back to Exodus again so he reveals
[58:58] himself now
[58:59] calls him out of his country and then
[59:01] now we go to Genesis 14 and it says and
[59:06] Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
[59:08] bread and wine and he was the priest of
[59:10] the Most High God and He blessed him and
[59:12] said blessed be Abram of the Most High
[59:14] God possessor of heavens and earth and
[59:16] blessed be the Most High God which hath
[59:19] delivered thine enemies into thine hand
[59:22] and he gave him tithes of all now this
[59:25] this Melchizedek David writes about him
[59:29] as Jesus would be a priest after the
[59:31] order of Melchizedek but then and then
[59:33] also Paul writes about him and he says
[59:36] this about Melchizedek because this
[59:38] wasn't just a natural man coming to
[59:40] Abraham writes this is for this
[59:41] Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the
[59:44] Most High God who met Abraham returning
[59:46] from the slaughter of the kings blessed
[59:48] him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[59:50] part of all-first being by
[59:52] interpretation king of righteousness and
[59:54] also after that king of Salem which is
[59:58] king of peace without father without
[1:00:00] mother without descent neither having
[1:00:03] neither beginning of days nor end of
[1:00:05] life but made like unto the Son of God
[1:00:08] abideth a priest continually so you're
[1:00:11] never beginning he didn't have parents
[1:00:13] he didn't have end of life he's eternal
[1:00:15] and the only one one eternal is God
[1:00:17] because it says in the New Testament
[1:00:19] that only God has immortality right so
[1:00:22] this was God now coming down and
[1:00:25] speaking day Brahim the same God admit
[1:00:27] that you're that spoke to me Genesis 12
[1:00:29] is now speaking to him in Genesis
[1:00:31] chapter 14 the same God okay and then
[1:00:36] Genesis 17:1 and when Abraham was ninety
[1:00:39] and nine years old the Lord appeared to
[1:00:41] Abraham said I am the Almighty God
[1:00:43] walk before me and be their perfect so
[1:00:47] now he's declaring himself as the Lord
[1:00:48] God Almighty
[1:00:49] I am the Almighty God amen and this
[1:00:54] Almighty God is from the Hebrew word el
[1:00:56] shaddai I and it it so L so element
[1:01:02] means strong one and Shetty is formed
[1:01:06] from the Hebrew word shed which is the
[1:01:08] breast where so she say like like a
[1:01:11] mother breastfeeding a baby said
[1:01:13] that God the mighty one is the strength
[1:01:16] Giver right so God is now revealing
[1:01:18] himself Abraham as the Almighty God the
[1:01:21] strength giver the life Giver
[1:01:23] just nurse off my promise basically
[1:01:25] don't fret about it it's going to come
[1:01:27] to pass how lujah I'm sure that he's
[1:01:30] revealed himself to you in that way as
[1:01:31] well
[1:01:32] don't fret just nurse on the promise
[1:01:34] keep feeding on the promise it'll keep
[1:01:36] you strong
[1:01:37] it'll make you grow hallelujah keep
[1:01:39] focused on the promise amen hallelujah
[1:01:44] that's why so there is there now and
[1:01:49] then now we come to Genesis 18 which we
[1:01:51] we we read briefly in the Sunday School
[1:01:54] and now God comes down and flesh and has
[1:01:57] a meal with Abraham and the Lord
[1:02:00] appeared unto him and the plains of
[1:02:01] Mamre and he sat in the tent door in the
[1:02:03] heat of the day and he lift up his eyes
[1:02:05] and looked and lo three men stood by him
[1:02:07] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:02:09] from the tent door and bowed himself
[1:02:11] toward the ground okay and then so so
[1:02:16] there's three men coming but one of them
[1:02:18] is God and two of the angels that go
[1:02:19] down and to Sodom right and we see this
[1:02:21] in Genesis 18 and 22 and the men turned
[1:02:24] their faces from thence and went toward
[1:02:26] Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the
[1:02:29] Lord cuz one of them was the Lord and
[1:02:31] flesh okay so Abraham knew this was God
[1:02:35] coming to him because he'd meet him
[1:02:36] before it wasn't a different God right
[1:02:39] it was the same God
[1:02:40] coming in flesh to speak to Abraham
[1:02:43] saying now is the time of the promise
[1:02:45] now's the time of the promise where you
[1:02:47] will receive the promised son hallelujah
[1:02:49] and that's why it's so incredible Amen
[1:02:52] with you know in brother Baris ministry
[1:02:54] we're now here he is and he says now
[1:02:56] we're we're back in the days of Sodom
[1:02:58] again amen and there's a promised seed
[1:03:01] that that's that's been called out
[1:03:04] waiting for the promised son to come to
[1:03:06] meet him in the air
[1:03:07] hallelujah and he said that the last
[1:03:08] sign that the church will receive major
[1:03:10] sign will be he God comes down and human
[1:03:13] flesh and reveals the secrets of the
[1:03:15] hearts of the people just like in
[1:03:17] Genesis 18 he says now I'll turn my back
[1:03:20] hallelujah and that same sign is done
[1:03:22] that you would see that we're just
[1:03:24] before the burning of this Gentile world
[1:03:27] the people already called out Holi are
[1:03:29] waiting to meet the promised son in the
[1:03:31] end I'm in Genesis 22 and 8 and Abraham
[1:03:37] said my son God will provide himself a
[1:03:39] lamb for a burnt offering so they both
[1:03:42] went of them together so God is
[1:03:46] revealing himself as Jehovah Jireh the
[1:03:48] Lord Himself will provide a sacrifice
[1:03:51] right and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:03:53] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:03:55] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[1:03:57] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:03:59] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[1:04:01] the stead of his son and Abraham called
[1:04:04] the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as
[1:04:06] it is said to this day in the mouths of
[1:04:08] the Lord it shall be seen so he had a
[1:04:12] revelation God will provide himself a
[1:04:14] sacrifice and that was pointing to these
[1:04:17] sacrifice Jesus Christ God has provided
[1:04:19] himself on behalf of your sacrifice
[1:04:22] hallelujah now as I said in the
[1:04:26] beginning there with with Genesis 12 it
[1:04:28] says the Lord called Abraham said get
[1:04:30] out of the country write that word means
[1:04:32] means Jehovah now that main seem now in
[1:04:38] light of what we read in the beginning
[1:04:39] but now we're going to come to it again
[1:04:41] says the Lord said unto Moses how shalt
[1:04:43] thou they'll see what I'll do to Pharaoh
[1:04:46] for the strong hand shall he let him go
[1:04:48] and with a strong hand Shelley drive
[1:04:50] them out of his land and God spake unto
[1:04:52] Moses said unto him I am the Lord and I
[1:04:55] appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac and
[1:04:57] to Jacob by the name of God Almighty but
[1:04:59] by my name Jehovah was I not known to
[1:05:04] them if you go read the accounts that we
[1:05:06] just read about Abraham it says in
[1:05:08] Jehovah spoke to him
[1:05:09] so does this contradict no it doesn't
[1:05:12] contradict because part of the name
[1:05:14] Jehovah part of God's life knows
[1:05:18] attributes is that he's a deliverer
[1:05:20] right he's a deliverer Abraham was never
[1:05:24] delivered right they were never in
[1:05:26] slavery Isaac Jacob they were never in
[1:05:28] slavery but now here comes God down and
[1:05:31] he's telling Moses they never knew me as
[1:05:34] a deliverer but now I'm going to reveal
[1:05:36] myself as deliverer right now I'm going
[1:05:39] to now I'm going to reveal my
[1:05:41] self in this way so they will now know
[1:05:43] me by my by the fullness of my name
[1:05:46] Jehovah right he provided himself a
[1:05:49] sacrifice he was their banner their
[1:05:51] healer all different kinds of things but
[1:05:53] now he is going to reveal himself as
[1:05:54] Jehovah the deliverer hallelujah so we
[1:05:58] know God came down and what did he do he
[1:06:00] delivered his children out of Israel he
[1:06:02] manifested his name right he manifested
[1:06:05] the life behind his name in that era
[1:06:07] right because he delivered them he
[1:06:10] manifested it they were set free out of
[1:06:11] Egypt they were no longer slaves
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:15] so God now God has manifested his name
[1:06:20] and we see it through where God delivers
[1:06:24] his people but we know that this is not
[1:06:28] the fullness of the manifestation of his
[1:06:31] name because Israel never knew about
[1:06:33] being delivered from sin the blood of
[1:06:35] bulls and goats only covered right the
[1:06:38] blood of bulls guys only covered they
[1:06:40] didn't know anything about the new birth
[1:06:41] like David you know because David it
[1:06:45] said the Spirit of God was with him from
[1:06:47] from when he was anointed by Samuel but
[1:06:49] he had such a longing you know for for
[1:06:53] more of God but he couldn't be born
[1:06:55] again because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:56] wasn't given right the blood of bulls
[1:06:58] and goats did not birth a person into
[1:07:00] the kingdom it did not produce God and
[1:07:02] flesh like we know now if it did then
[1:07:06] why did Jesus have to die Jesus had to
[1:07:08] die to cleanse the people to come and
[1:07:09] dwell in them amen so now I want to show
[1:07:16] you here so in the book of Isaiah it
[1:07:20] says ye o my witnesses saith the Lord of
[1:07:23] my servant whom I have chosen
[1:07:24] that ye may know and believe me and
[1:07:27] understand that I am he before me there
[1:07:30] was no God formed neither shall there be
[1:07:32] after me I even I am the Lord and
[1:07:35] besides me there is no Savior so God has
[1:07:39] to clean there's no one else I'm only
[1:07:41] one there's no salvation outside of me
[1:07:43] I'm the only Savior so now in order for
[1:07:47] God to be a savior he had to manifest
[1:07:50] that salvation right and so season
[1:07:53] Isaiah seven and four
[1:07:54] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:07:56] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:07:58] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:08:00] his name Emmanuel which means God with
[1:08:03] us right there's a prophecy of God
[1:08:05] coming to the earth I mean in a body of
[1:08:07] flesh he also said in Isaiah nine and
[1:08:13] six he says for unto us a child is born
[1:08:15] unto us a sudden son is given and the
[1:08:17] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:08:19] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:08:20] counsellor the mighty God the
[1:08:22] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:08:24] of the increase of his government and
[1:08:26] peace there shall be no end upon the
[1:08:28] throne of David upon the and upon his
[1:08:31] kingdom to order it to establish it with
[1:08:33] judgment and with justice from
[1:08:35] henceforth even forever the zeal of the
[1:08:38] Lord of hosts will perform this
[1:08:40] hallelujah so now here's a prophecy
[1:08:42] saying he'll be called Emmanuel he'll be
[1:08:44] called the mighty God the everlasting
[1:08:45] father the Prince of Peace wonderful
[1:08:48] counsellor I mean all of these names
[1:08:50] will be manifested but then when we see
[1:08:52] and in the new testament because we know
[1:08:57] in the old testament the name of Jesus
[1:08:58] was never was never said that he will be
[1:09:01] called Jesus in the old testament right
[1:09:03] I mean anyone read the name Jesus in the
[1:09:06] Old Testament no it's not there but all
[1:09:08] of these all of what you read about
[1:09:10] God's attributes of the Old Testament
[1:09:11] are encapsulated in the name of Jesus
[1:09:14] Christ we read here in Matthew 1 and 20
[1:09:16] but while he thought on these things
[1:09:18] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:09:20] unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou
[1:09:22] son of David fear not to take unto thee
[1:09:24] Mary thy wife for that which is
[1:09:26] conceived of her as of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] and she shall bear forth a son and thou
[1:09:31] shalt call his name Jesus for he shall
[1:09:33] save his people from their sins now hold
[1:09:36] on you know but I thought his name would
[1:09:40] be Emmanuel let's just this is be silly
[1:09:43] a little bit you know but people are so
[1:09:45] carnal people are so carnal I thought
[1:09:49] his name should be Emmanuel shouldn't
[1:09:51] his name be everlasting father the
[1:09:53] Almighty God the Prince of Peace
[1:09:55] wonderful counselor isn't that what the
[1:09:57] Bible says his name should be as this
[1:09:59] angel falls now because there he's
[1:10:02] giving the wrong thing he's not giving
[1:10:04] the wrong name because in all those
[1:10:07] attributes
[1:10:08] an official in the name of Jesus because
[1:10:09] Jesus means Jehovah's salvation right so
[1:10:12] now Jehovah's salvation is coming to the
[1:10:15] earth I mean more than a deliverance
[1:10:16] from slavery but a deliverance from sin
[1:10:19] and deliverance from a first nature
[1:10:21] right a deliverance from culture from
[1:10:25] family ties whatever it is that that
[1:10:27] holds us back from hobbies and things
[1:10:29] that we would make idols remember God
[1:10:31] would cleanse us amen through the name
[1:10:33] of Jesus Christ right so Jesus was now
[1:10:36] the manifestation of the fullness of God
[1:10:39] hallelujah
[1:10:40] what what he could only manifest in part
[1:10:42] in the Old Testament he was now manifest
[1:10:44] in its fullness hallelujah for he shall
[1:10:47] save it I love it where you know I love
[1:10:49] this first this is the reason you got to
[1:10:51] call him Jesus because he shall save his
[1:10:53] people from their sins only he's gonna
[1:10:56] manifest that name I mean just like
[1:10:59] Nabal was a wicked fool Amen Jesus will
[1:11:02] manifest the deliverance of his people
[1:11:03] that they shall be saved from their sins
[1:11:07] Alleluia I mean so the angel wasn't
[1:11:10] contradicting what what was spoken and
[1:11:12] Isaiah know it is the interpretation of
[1:11:15] it
[1:11:16] Allu you and that's why right and then
[1:11:21] we read continue on now all this was
[1:11:23] done that it might be fulfilled which is
[1:11:26] spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying
[1:11:28] a virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:11:30] bring forth a son and they shall call
[1:11:32] his name Emmanuel which being
[1:11:34] interpreted is God with us amen so the
[1:11:38] name of Jesus Amy represents God being
[1:11:41] with us as well so now everything that
[1:11:45] all that God is that's why the name of
[1:11:48] Jesus is trodden down right that's why
[1:11:51] it's that's why it's a curse word his
[1:11:54] glorious name is trodden down because
[1:11:55] that's what the devil basically says it
[1:11:57] is it's not worth anything
[1:11:58] it's a lowly name it's a rubbish name
[1:12:00] it's not a rubbish name it's the name
[1:12:02] above all names and because in the name
[1:12:05] of Jesus we have deliverance we have
[1:12:07] salvation and then way of healing amen
[1:12:09] and it's amazing when a people a church
[1:12:12] world will pray in his name right
[1:12:15] they'll ask forgiveness in his name but
[1:12:17] they will not be buried in his name they
[1:12:19] will not be identified with us
[1:12:22] in Baptism and that shows that they will
[1:12:25] not be identified with his word right
[1:12:27] because if you're really identified with
[1:12:29] them you will manifest his word you will
[1:12:32] love his word you won't separate him
[1:12:34] from his word right but people will be
[1:12:37] baptized in titles they don't take on
[1:12:39] the name of Jesus Christ and what do
[1:12:41] they do at the word they put it to one
[1:12:42] side but the Bride of Christ
[1:12:45] I mean takes on his name I'm so glad to
[1:12:47] be identified with the name of Jesus
[1:12:49] Christ amen with my with my sacrifice I
[1:12:53] mean with all the reproach with all the
[1:12:55] glory whatever is I'm willing to take it
[1:12:57] upon myself thank upon his name and be
[1:12:59] identified with him amen and that's
[1:13:01] shown by taking his word hallelujah
[1:13:03] taking his whole word and saying that is
[1:13:05] you Lord Jesus I'll live for that amen
[1:13:08] amen
[1:13:09] John 5 and 43 I am coming my father's
[1:13:13] name and you received me not if another
[1:13:16] shall come in his own name him you will
[1:13:19] receive how can you believe which
[1:13:21] receive honor one of another and seek
[1:13:24] not the honour that cometh from God only
[1:13:26] do not think that I'll accuse you - the
[1:13:28] father there is one that accused with
[1:13:30] you even Moses in whom he trusts so
[1:13:32] Jesus is saying he comes in his father's
[1:13:35] name so what's the name of the father
[1:13:37] it's Jesus right he says I come in my
[1:13:40] father's name name of her father as
[1:13:42] Jesus right so there he was manifesting
[1:13:45] the name of the Father right because
[1:13:48] here is the Express image of his person
[1:13:49] so when he saw Jesus God and flesh as
[1:13:52] Jesus you saw what the great Eternal
[1:13:54] Spirit was right amen now we read here
[1:14:03] in revelations 14 and 1 that season I
[1:14:05] looked at lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion
[1:14:07] and with him a hundred and forty-four
[1:14:09] thousand having his father's name
[1:14:11] written in their foreheads so saying
[1:14:14] they're standing with the lamb which is
[1:14:15] our Lord Jesus and his father's name and
[1:14:17] their Foyt's what's the name of the
[1:14:19] Father Jesus right because these 144,000
[1:14:22] we're just reading about here I mean
[1:14:24] they are the Jews that received the same
[1:14:26] Lord Jesus we know after we go to the
[1:14:28] wedding supper hallelujah now the name
[1:14:33] of so it's
[1:14:35] go let's just keep going x9 and three
[1:14:39] and as he journeyed this is salt he came
[1:14:42] near Damascus and suddenly they shined
[1:14:44] round about him alive from heaven and he
[1:14:46] fell to the earth and heard a voice
[1:14:48] saying unto Him Saul Saul why
[1:14:49] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[1:14:53] thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus
[1:14:55] whom their persecuted it's hard for thee
[1:14:58] to kick against the pricks ER and he
[1:14:59] trembling and astonished said Lord what
[1:15:01] will thou have me to do and the Lord
[1:15:03] said unto Him arise go into the city and
[1:15:05] it should be told thee what thou must do
[1:15:08] now when when the Apostle Paul calls him
[1:15:11] Lord that word actually means supreme
[1:15:13] one it means supreme and authority
[1:15:16] so he wasn't just calling any being Lord
[1:15:18] he's saying who are you God who are you
[1:15:21] he said I'll tell you who I am I'm Jesus
[1:15:26] right because that is that is the name
[1:15:29] of God does God manifest it he went he
[1:15:32] became flesh the name of there was Jesus
[1:15:35] right that's the fullness of God's
[1:15:37] manifestation and then he went back into
[1:15:39] pillar fire and his name was still Jesus
[1:15:41] because it's still Jehovah salvation
[1:15:43] manifested a many other people now
[1:15:47] Ephesians 3 and 9 and to make all men
[1:15:51] see what is the Fellowship of the
[1:15:52] mystery which from the beginning of the
[1:15:54] world hath hath been hid in God who
[1:15:57] created all things by Jesus Christ to
[1:16:00] the intent that now unto the
[1:16:01] principalities and powers and heavenly
[1:16:03] places might be known by the church the
[1:16:06] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[1:16:08] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:16:11] Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:16:13] and whom we have boldness and access
[1:16:15] with confidence by the faith of him
[1:16:17] where of I desire that you faint not at
[1:16:20] my tribulations for you which is your
[1:16:22] glory for this course I bow my knees and
[1:16:25] to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:26] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:16:29] earth is named I mean so the whole
[1:16:32] family him mother's name Jesus Christ
[1:16:34] Alleluia amen now we'll we'll come to
[1:16:40] that later why that's significant
[1:16:41] because well I just drop a little bit in
[1:16:44] here you are you know we we get older
[1:16:49] realize we are our parents whether we
[1:16:52] like it or not
[1:16:52] what we the the natural life you see
[1:16:56] your parents living right there their
[1:16:58] character how they you know respond to
[1:17:00] things and you say I'll never become
[1:17:02] like that and then you find you are like
[1:17:04] that because it's the natural gene it's
[1:17:07] your DNA
[1:17:08] it's your makeup you know it's your
[1:17:12] family spirit the natural spirit you
[1:17:14] receive through them that's that's
[1:17:16] what's manifested in you you can't help
[1:17:18] it right you can't help but whether you
[1:17:21] like I don't you say I never be like
[1:17:22] that in you and you find yourself you
[1:17:24] like that right why it's because it's
[1:17:27] the life in you manifesting now if
[1:17:29] that's just natural life how much more
[1:17:31] the people who are really called by his
[1:17:33] name right they actually are the family
[1:17:36] of God right they are not just by
[1:17:38] association saying I'm a Christian but
[1:17:40] God says I'll put my name in them I mean
[1:17:43] they will manifest my redemption they
[1:17:45] will be like me holy and you begin to
[1:17:48] find yourself oh I you can't but act
[1:17:51] like him right because you are part of
[1:17:55] the family right his life is in you just
[1:17:58] let the life those and your father is in
[1:18:00] you I'm in the life of your heavenly
[1:18:02] Father is in you holy and you're
[1:18:05] manifesting his life and you can't help
[1:18:07] it it's there hallelujah amen
[1:18:12] I'm glad lujah and Jesus came and spake
[1:18:17] unto them saying all power is given unto
[1:18:20] me in heaven and earth go ye therefore
[1:18:22] and teach all nations baptizing them in
[1:18:24] the name of the Father and of the son of
[1:18:25] the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe
[1:18:27] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[1:18:29] you lo I am with you always even to the
[1:18:32] end of the world he says amen so it says
[1:18:34] baptized in one name he doesn't say
[1:18:36] names for the name of the Father of the
[1:18:39] son of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:40] now father is not a name we know there's
[1:18:42] very elementary but I want to the name
[1:18:44] of Jesus is supreme right right so
[1:18:49] father's a title sons a title Holy Ghost
[1:18:51] is what he is but it's not his name
[1:18:53] right and he's four now the disciples
[1:18:56] knew exactly what what Jesus was saying
[1:18:59] to them they knew who the father was
[1:19:02] I knew his name then you who who who he
[1:19:05] was and now we go to Acts chapter 2 and
[1:19:08] then Peter says repent be baptized
[1:19:11] everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:13] for the remission of sin and you shall
[1:19:15] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now
[1:19:17] notice in the book of Acts here
[1:19:19] Matthew was standing right there he was
[1:19:21] in the upper room and he took no
[1:19:23] exception of of Peter saying baptized
[1:19:26] the name of Jesus Christ because he knew
[1:19:29] what Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 is the
[1:19:32] name of Jesus Christ the one name of the
[1:19:34] Father Son Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ
[1:19:36] right and people say well I don't need
[1:19:39] to get baptized the thief on the cross
[1:19:41] didn't get baptized I say the thief on
[1:19:43] the cross was the last Old Testament
[1:19:45] Saint to come in right and if he if he
[1:19:49] wasn't stuck to that cross he would have
[1:19:50] been in the upper room and he would have
[1:19:52] got baptized right so you know I don't
[1:19:56] know why people look for a way out I
[1:19:57] just look for a way in amen
[1:20:00] Oh Lord what's for me I want it all yeah
[1:20:04] I'm not trying to avoid the thing I mean
[1:20:06] why would people want to avoid eternal
[1:20:08] life I tell you only reason as his demon
[1:20:10] powers upon them and they yield
[1:20:12] themselves to the devil more than God
[1:20:13] yes amen but he says there are baptized
[1:20:16] the name of Jesus Christ because they
[1:20:18] knew that this was God's and that name
[1:20:21] is his Redemption and that name is
[1:20:23] transforming power and that name is
[1:20:26] healing and their name is restoration
[1:20:27] and that name is deliverance hallelujah
[1:20:30] eternal life was given in that name amen
[1:20:33] everything that God is as manifest in
[1:20:35] the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:20:39] and that's why sorry we'll go back here
[1:20:41] X 3 & 6 then Peter said silver and gold
[1:20:43] have I none but such as I have give IV
[1:20:46] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:20:48] rise up and walk
[1:20:49] amen because now healing was healing was
[1:20:53] there deliverance was there hallelujah
[1:20:56] now the Apostles were no one for
[1:21:00] preaching in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:01] everything I did was everything a word
[1:21:03] or deed paul says doing the name of
[1:21:06] Jesus Christ they were known for the
[1:21:08] name of Jesus right so they they they
[1:21:11] preached in his name they prayed in his
[1:21:13] name they lived in his name everything
[1:21:15] named okay they lifted up the name of
[1:21:19] Jesus Christ and that is the essential I
[1:21:22] mean if we and we have been restored to
[1:21:24] an epistolary the faith of the fathers
[1:21:27] living still and because we have been
[1:21:29] restored so is the importance and the
[1:21:32] magnitude and the significance of the
[1:21:34] name of Jesus Christ has been restored
[1:21:36] that's why I say he's not a he's not a
[1:21:39] second God he's not a junior God right
[1:21:42] he's not some little errand boy I mean
[1:21:44] that we command to push around he's not
[1:21:45] some little doting grandfather or what
[1:21:47] every people have made him in the world
[1:21:49] the god of convenience a god of you know
[1:21:51] I now I need you to help me now I don't
[1:21:53] need y'all do my own thing you know
[1:21:55] that's not the God we serve a man but we
[1:21:58] we serve the Lord God Almighty
[1:22:01] hallelujah in his name as the Lord Jesus
[1:22:03] Christ so if they were known for lifting
[1:22:06] up the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:07] so will the bride in the last days
[1:22:10] because we've been restored back to that
[1:22:12] faith right and we know he is his word
[1:22:16] amen x4 and ten be it known unto thee
[1:22:21] and all the people of Israel that by the
[1:22:23] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:22:25] so Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[1:22:27] raised from the dead even by him does
[1:22:30] this man stand here before you whole and
[1:22:33] x5 and forty and to him they agreed and
[1:22:36] when they had called the Apostles and
[1:22:38] beaten them they commanded that they
[1:22:40] should not speak in the name of Jesus
[1:22:42] and let them go did they listen another
[1:22:44] didn't listen hallelujah then X 8 and 12
[1:22:49] and when when they believed Philip
[1:22:51] preaching the things concerning the
[1:22:53] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[1:22:55] Christ they were baptized both men and
[1:22:58] woman why cuz Philip was preaching the
[1:22:59] name of Jesus Christ how lujah that he
[1:23:02] was he was showing the power in that
[1:23:05] name that's why it's more than just a
[1:23:06] phrase or we love Jesus you know with
[1:23:09] Jesus people isn't he wonderful no
[1:23:12] there's a manifestation of that name
[1:23:14] right his name as his name has been put
[1:23:16] in the Bride of Christ just like the
[1:23:19] father put his name in the Sun right and
[1:23:22] the Sun manifested the life of Jesus
[1:23:25] right manifested the life of that name
[1:23:27] he
[1:23:28] benefits of Jehovah's salvation because
[1:23:30] he was Jehovah's salvation right
[1:23:32] everything he did was deliverance and
[1:23:34] salvation Redemption gathering his
[1:23:37] children to himself because it's
[1:23:38] manifesting the name of Jesus is
[1:23:40] manifesting Jehovah's salvation and as
[1:23:43] the as the groom manifested Jehovah's
[1:23:46] salvation so will the bride I mean but
[1:23:49] the bride does not does not have we
[1:23:51] don't have to die for anyone jesus paid
[1:23:53] it all right Jesus paid it all he
[1:23:55] delivered everyone who will believe he
[1:23:57] said everyone free on Calvary he
[1:23:59] purchased the sin of the world amen he
[1:24:01] he did all that so he he paid it all but
[1:24:04] now then the victory comes and lives
[1:24:07] through us right we're more than
[1:24:09] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:24:10] right because where we are manifesting
[1:24:13] his name to the earth amen I'm glad he
[1:24:19] paid it all and we just enjoy x4 1 & 3
[1:24:24] he says and as they spake in the and
[1:24:27] they spake unto the people the priests
[1:24:29] and the captain of the temple and the
[1:24:31] Pharisees came unto them being grieved
[1:24:33] as they taught the people and preached
[1:24:35] through Jesus the resurrection from the
[1:24:37] dead and they laid hands on them and put
[1:24:39] them in hold for unto the next day as it
[1:24:42] was now Eventide howbeit many of them
[1:24:46] which heard the word believed a number
[1:24:48] of Mimar about 5,000 and it came to pass
[1:24:50] on the morrow that their rulers and
[1:24:52] elders and scribes and an is the high
[1:24:55] priest and k ephesus and john alexander
[1:24:57] as many as were of the candidate of the
[1:24:59] high priest were gathered together at
[1:25:01] Jerusalem and when they had set them in
[1:25:05] the midst they asked by what power or by
[1:25:08] what name have you done this then Peter
[1:25:10] filled with the Holy Ghost said unto
[1:25:11] them ye rulers of the people and elders
[1:25:13] of Israel if we thirst they be examined
[1:25:16] of the good deed does the impotent been
[1:25:18] by what means he is made whole I mean
[1:25:22] they were so he said by what name have
[1:25:24] you done this by the name of Jesus
[1:25:25] Christ and the Apostle said there is no
[1:25:28] other name given under heaven by which
[1:25:30] men must be safe right so as Isaiah said
[1:25:33] we read there in Isaiah 43 that there's
[1:25:36] no God beside me there's no other Savior
[1:25:38] no not one that's how about that
[1:25:40] salvation is Menefee
[1:25:41] is the name of Jesus Christ because
[1:25:43] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[1:25:45] Christ of than you right so there's no
[1:25:47] other name no other way that a man must
[1:25:50] be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:25:53] that's how essential it is right
[1:25:56] hallelujah amen now Philippians two and
[1:26:04] eight and being found in fashion as a
[1:26:06] man he humbled himself and became
[1:26:08] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:26:10] the cross
[1:26:10] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[1:26:12] him and given him a name which is above
[1:26:15] every name that at the name of Jesus
[1:26:17] every knee should bow of things in
[1:26:19] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:26:21] under the earth and that every tongue
[1:26:22] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:26:25] to the glory of God the Father amen so
[1:26:31] here's the name above all names now that
[1:26:33] name is in the Bride of Christ right
[1:26:36] where we are manifesting that name
[1:26:38] hallelujah so now we read all that
[1:26:43] because there is no program said this
[1:26:47] and what is the attraction on the
[1:26:48] mountain he'd returned home for thus
[1:26:51] saith the Lord the seven mysteries has
[1:26:53] been hid in the Bible all these years
[1:26:54] these denominations and everything God
[1:26:56] is going to open these seven mysteries
[1:26:58] to us in the seven seals there was that
[1:27:01] circle coming up from the earth like a
[1:27:03] mist forming when it did it went plumb
[1:27:05] up into the mountain begin to circle on
[1:27:07] westward from the way it came science
[1:27:10] found it after a while 30 miles high 25
[1:27:13] miles across just exactly in the circle
[1:27:15] of the pyramid and the other day
[1:27:17] standing there turned the picture to the
[1:27:19] right and there's Jesus as he was in the
[1:27:22] seven churches the white wig on showing
[1:27:24] supreme deity he's Alpha and Omega he's
[1:27:27] the first and the last he is the supreme
[1:27:29] judge of all eternity standing there
[1:27:31] confirmed the message of this hour and
[1:27:33] this shall be light about the evening
[1:27:35] time he says what it's all about as
[1:27:38] Jesus Christ being made known hallelujah
[1:27:42] now in Revelation is 3 I've read a whole
[1:27:49] bunch because I want you to see this in
[1:27:50] the scripture right I want you to see it
[1:27:53] because people say no that's not true
[1:27:54] there's no
[1:27:55] true it's all in the scripture right I
[1:27:57] want you to see that the name that God
[1:27:59] has changed his name down through the
[1:28:01] seasons and the reason he did that is
[1:28:03] because every every time he checked he
[1:28:05] he says now I'm Jehovah I must is
[1:28:07] because he's expressing a part of
[1:28:09] himself and all that was down capsulated
[1:28:11] the name of Jesus Christ right and he
[1:28:14] that overcometh will i make a pillar in
[1:28:16] the temple of my god and he shall go no
[1:28:18] more out and i will write upon him the
[1:28:20] name of my god and the name of the city
[1:28:23] of my god which is the New Jerusalem
[1:28:24] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[1:28:27] god and I will write upon him my new
[1:28:30] name right this is the one that
[1:28:31] overcometh every overcoming promise is
[1:28:34] applied to every age right so now he
[1:28:36] says that he that overcometh right over
[1:28:39] cometh in the age that they live I mean
[1:28:41] I will write upon him the name of my God
[1:28:43] because they manifest that Jesus
[1:28:45] overcame right Jesus overcame it so the
[1:28:48] bride will overcome right speak so the
[1:28:50] overcomer in every age is manifesting
[1:28:53] the power of his name the life that's
[1:28:56] behind his name amen
[1:28:59] revelations 2:17 he that hath an ear let
[1:29:02] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:29:03] churches
[1:29:04] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:29:06] eat of the hidden manna and will give
[1:29:08] him a white stone and in that and the
[1:29:11] stone a new name written that no man
[1:29:13] knoweth saying he that receive it now a
[1:29:15] stone as revelation right so that he
[1:29:18] that overcometh I will give him a
[1:29:20] revelation amen and a new name written
[1:29:23] right that you will understand who you
[1:29:26] really are on him your identity I mean
[1:29:28] is revealed I mean in a revelation from
[1:29:30] him hallelujah I mean I'm glad that that
[1:29:34] is that is how the church is built amen
[1:29:38] now and gods only provide a place of
[1:29:41] worship I just got to two quotes that
[1:29:44] will close he says it ain't Methodist
[1:29:46] God's name isn't Methodist God's name
[1:29:49] isn't Pentecostal God's name ain't
[1:29:51] Baptist God's name isn't Catholic stay
[1:29:54] out of them doors then see see but in a
[1:29:56] place where I choose to put my name now
[1:29:59] there's not another place in the Bible
[1:30:00] given where God ever put his name only
[1:30:03] in Jesus Christ for he is the son of God
[1:30:05] taking the name of God and God's human
[1:30:07] name
[1:30:08] there's not another name and given under
[1:30:10] heaven whereby you must be safe that's
[1:30:13] what the Apostle said I don't care
[1:30:14] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:30:16] catechisms whatever you want to do only
[1:30:19] through the name of Jesus Christ where
[1:30:20] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:30:22] shall confess to it he being Lord that's
[1:30:24] how you come in and if you was and if
[1:30:28] you is just baptized in water like and
[1:30:30] then deny the word then you're
[1:30:32] illegitimate your birth wasn't correct
[1:30:34] you claim that you believe him then and
[1:30:36] you deny him how could I deny my father
[1:30:39] how could I deny Charles Brandon being
[1:30:41] my father a blood test on the door shows
[1:30:43] at sea uh-huh my action and the
[1:30:46] vindication of God's Word in my life
[1:30:48] shows whether I'm a child of God or not
[1:30:50] now there's God's only place see it the
[1:30:53] only place that God will receive your
[1:30:54] sacrifice I don't care how sincere is in
[1:30:58] Christ and Christ is the word right you
[1:31:02] say you say well I believed I come and
[1:31:06] to remember the Bible says you say well
[1:31:08] the Bible said whatever whosoever
[1:31:10] believeth that Jesus Christ is the son
[1:31:11] of God has saved shall be saved
[1:31:13] it says that but remember it has also
[1:31:15] written also as written no man shall
[1:31:18] call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy
[1:31:20] Ghost see you might say he is but he
[1:31:23] isn't until the Holy Spirit itself which
[1:31:25] gives life to the word proves it by
[1:31:28] vindication that you are the son of God
[1:31:30] then that's the scripture the place that
[1:31:32] I chose to put my name you shall not
[1:31:34] worship but any other gate but in the
[1:31:36] gate I put my name and then I will
[1:31:38] receive you you're in my family now the
[1:31:41] family of God obeys the orders of the
[1:31:43] father of the family and he is the
[1:31:45] Prince of Peace the mighty God the
[1:31:46] everlasting father and of his Dominion
[1:31:49] and reign there shall be no end the
[1:31:51] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:31:52] and he being the governor King Emmanuel
[1:31:55] first last Prince of Peace the mighty
[1:31:56] God everlasting father every one of us
[1:31:59] children obey every word to the order
[1:32:01] because they're part of him
[1:32:02] we live in our home like branham's love
[1:32:05] you live in your home the Joneses like
[1:32:07] the Joneses live and in the house of God
[1:32:09] we live by the Word of God and everyone
[1:32:11] that everyone that proceeds out of the
[1:32:13] mouth of God and any other fraud we
[1:32:15] won't listen to him see why because this
[1:32:18] his life comes unto you
[1:32:20] right if you love me jesus' keep my
[1:32:24] commandments it also says if we love Him
[1:32:26] as Commandments nor grievious right his
[1:32:28] word is not Grievous to them that love
[1:32:30] him right because now well why is that
[1:32:32] because his name his life comes unto you
[1:32:36] and you can't help being a Jesus person
[1:32:38] right if you're really surrendered to
[1:32:41] him and his life is in you you can't
[1:32:42] help it I mean because you're
[1:32:45] manifesting the life of your family your
[1:32:48] real family right not you're not your
[1:32:50] natural family Amen but you are
[1:32:53] manifesting Jehovah salvation hallelujah
[1:32:57] I mean where he is he has manifested
[1:32:59] himself other people that's why I say no
[1:33:01] it's it's so it's so vital that we
[1:33:07] understand we're called by his name
[1:33:09] because we're manifesting his life right
[1:33:12] that's why we're that's why we're called
[1:33:14] by his name not that we just associate
[1:33:17] ourselves with his name we said no I'm
[1:33:19] gonna call these people by my name that
[1:33:22] they will be my family they'll be my
[1:33:23] bride right and they'll manifest my life
[1:33:26] hallelujah and then we just turn around
[1:33:29] say well we can't help but doing it
[1:33:32] family traits are passed down hallelujah
[1:33:35] his family traits are passed down I mean
[1:33:38] we may have different testimony but I'll
[1:33:40] produce the same kind of life we know
[1:33:42] God's not a cookie cutter but we'll
[1:33:44] produce the same kind of life if the
[1:33:46] Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:33:48] have produced that kind of life and the
[1:33:49] Holy Ghost falling today will produce a
[1:33:51] same kind of life it won't produce a
[1:33:53] different kind of life I mean we've been
[1:33:54] restored back to that where the name of
[1:33:57] Jesus was manifested the name of Jesus
[1:33:59] was glorified it was manifested in a
[1:34:01] people hallelujah so it weren't it won't
[1:34:05] change I think we we have the musicians
[1:34:08] please there is power in the name of
[1:34:11] Jesus
[1:34:23] so once you to understand Jesus
[1:34:26] conquered every spurt right he conquered
[1:34:30] every sickness he conquered hell itself
[1:34:33] and he rose victorious to show that
[1:34:36] there was nothing above his name right
[1:34:38] death wasn't above his name sickness
[1:34:41] wasn't above his name religion wasn't
[1:34:43] above his name culture wasn't above his
[1:34:45] name unbelief didn't hinder him nothing
[1:34:48] hindered the name of Jesus everything
[1:34:50] was put under his feet right and it is
[1:34:53] the same thing now that to the name of
[1:34:56] Jesus everything must bow right sickness
[1:35:00] must bow unbelief must bow indifference
[1:35:03] must bow brittleness must bow resentment
[1:35:06] must bow whatever it is must bow
[1:35:08] melancholy must bow everything must bow
[1:35:11] to the name of Jesus Christ everything
[1:35:13] is under that name hallelujah and that's
[1:35:17] why if we are called by his name we are
[1:35:19] call to overcome we will call to
[1:35:22] overcome all things amen whatever it may
[1:35:24] be you name an enemy at must bow has
[1:35:27] been put under his feet I mean we're
[1:35:29] called by his name that we're called to
[1:35:31] overcome we're anointed to overcome
[1:35:33] every enemy overcome every obstacle
[1:35:35] break through every barrier a me walk
[1:35:38] out victorious hallelujah
[1:35:41] I believe it frees this one the name of
[1:35:43] Jesus is so vital and important they
[1:35:45] understand if we're called by his name I
[1:35:47] mean that as he overcame we will
[1:35:49] overcome through him hallelujah that's
[1:35:52] why we shouldn't just sit back and say
[1:35:54] well this is how life is and this is how
[1:35:56] it's gonna be
[1:35:56] who said it's gonna be this way who said
[1:35:59] it's gonna remain this way hallelujah we
[1:36:02] should just you know don't just put up
[1:36:04] with the status quo the status quo is
[1:36:06] called to be changed hallelujah
[1:36:08] there's people in the world calling
[1:36:10] himself progressive we're progressive
[1:36:12] hallelujah that the old order has done
[1:36:14] away with of our being separate from God
[1:36:17] and sin reigning over people no we're
[1:36:20] going to take away the foundation out of
[1:36:21] that thing
