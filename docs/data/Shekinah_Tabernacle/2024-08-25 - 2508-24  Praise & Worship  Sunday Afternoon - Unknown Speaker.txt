[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to the um praise and worship 2024 session um I think in our fellowship we have we are probably skewed more in in favor of musicians they non-m musicians that would almost be correct wouldn't it put your hands up if you if you are a musician or if you can kind of sing okay like you think you know I'm a bit of a put your hands up now come on be honest and you do items if you do a special ever then you got to put your hand up tth you're doing specials come on see yeah plus us yeah we're yeah we're 51% but um you realize that growing up in a church actually you become a lot more musical than if you don't um grow up in a church because you each each week sometimes twice a week you are singing and being involved in music so as a general rule Christians are actually more musically minded than non-christians um so I think it's a um it's an enjoyable thing to um be able to sing together and worship God and to yeah music is quite powerful in a sense that everyone can enter into the same atmosphere of a song you know we can all do it together and enter in and sing so thanks um brother Jimmy for arranging this session um we've got a a a bunch of very nice um specials to um that we're going to be doing and I'm just going to we'll do a we'll open up prayer then we'll do one song we're going to do I'm so glad Jesus lifted me so we'll do a song Just we'll stand up and just to get a praise song happening and then we'll probably do about three or four specials or maybe 5 and then we'll get up and do another congregational song just to kind of get those afternoon sort of sleepy office not going to lie to you you know you have a

up praise ye the Lord I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation I feel like the song we just heard was praising the Lord some there were the sisters praising the Lord with their whole heart in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation so we just lived out that verse amen it's just a small surprise I I teach Sunday school so I'm really glad for these girls and the two boys were always very helpful in class and this song is just um sometimes I'm a parent and sometimes we hardly sometimes see uh when we're teaching the kids we sometimes don't see it if it's making sense because we don't see it immediately but the song is saying um just look at the details and that's where you'll see God and sometimes those details at the moment you don't see those details cuz all the details you see you don't but then in the long run you'll see those details and you'll see how they really me so we're counting our blessings yeah it's like it was yesterday I was praying for a miracle scared to have a little hope and now looking back today seeing all the things you've done I can't even them up 2 three after to inin I drawn out of numbers before I could thank you for everything God I'm still counting my blessings for all that you've done in my life the more that I look in the details the more of your goodness I find father on the inside of Heaven I know that I'll run out of time but I'll keep counting my blessings knowing I can't count that high I know the seasons will never last forever so God I will remember all of the reasons my heart has to be grateful all the times you've been faithful to me God I'm still counting my blessings for all that you've done in my life the more that I look in the the more of your goodness I find father on this side of Heaven I know that I run out of time but I'll keep counting my blessings knowing I can't count that high oh I can't count that [Music] high oh your goodness your

experience brother impo I don't know if the words she might desert me just [Music] now God bless you and the song the song that I'm going to sing talks about the city of the home that we are going to and it's actually in the suet by and by there's a there's a land that is fairer you know that song but it's in suot to so it's not a direct translation word for word but it's the same context or same meaning if you know the song it blesses me so much because it doesn't talk about the past doesn't talk about the current challenges it talks about the our future and that's that's why we are all looking forward or ahead to experience amen is that the one which one I'm [Music] seeing [Music] [Music] for for [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen to this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the sweet in the Sweet By we shall me on that beautiful show in this way I and by we shall be on that VI sing it

about when I when I woke up [Music] so this song is such a blessing to me because sometimes if you listen to a song and you you you find like sister taba was saying yesterday you know some of these songs speaks colums when when you are alone and you're going through something and maybe a lump of Happiness you're going through that you know when you go through that think about God and you go through a lump of sadness or hurt or or the enemy just brings something you know we go through those things hey or you you've got a burden for someone and you are you're in a burden for them and you enter in that burden for them so some of these thingss comes when you alone and you cry alone it's so nice to cry when you are alone cuz nobody can see you so it says uh s is going to help me where I get stuck I want I don't have to go slow but a little bit give it a bit of like small [Music] speed just tell me when to start [Music] was sleeping so peaceful in my bed last night the spirit of God

your best Harmony voices sounds so amazing together I think we've got all these instruments but you know one brother said he said the best instrument of all as a human voice and how we can uh uh you know it's it's more than just like this is a piece of wood with some strings and that it's made in a certain way and when you when you pluck it it makes a sound but you know that that guitar say we take a guitar for instance that guitar in itself it it it's only expressing what something else is playing through it you know it's it's although it's making a beautiful sound it doesn't it can't do that in and of itself but you know we have this voice here that we can feel something in our heart and then we can sing it out through here and it it it comes out but it's from somewhere in our heart like we can do our voices can do what none of these instruments can do they can express and we can we can praise the Lord so let's just sing Hallelujah which means praise the Lord oh are they
