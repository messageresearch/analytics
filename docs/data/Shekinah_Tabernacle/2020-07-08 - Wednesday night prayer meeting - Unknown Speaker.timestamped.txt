[29:36] and departed into a solitary place and
[29:39] they're prayed and Simon and they that

[30:31] in a race run all but one receiveth the
[30:35] prize so run that you may obtain in
[30:38] every man that striveth for the mastery
[30:39] is temperate in all things now they do
[30:42] it to obtain a corruptible crown but we
[30:45] an incorruptible I therefore so run not
[30:49] as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[30:53] that beateth the air but I keep under my
[30:55] body I keep under my body and bring it

[32:14] Lord amen I mean god bless you you may
[32:18] have your seats tonight I I want to kind
[32:20] of maybe start a bit of a subject I'm
[32:22] just gonna hit maybe some highlights but
[32:24] I want to talk about it working
[32:25] according to the laws of God I got this
[32:28] from brother Berman he he mentions a few
[32:30] times and I'll just I'll just take one
[32:32] of them where where he would speak about
[32:35] you know these laws as an as in gravity
[32:37] and and you know he he says now he says
[32:42] it as I said God will never go outside
[32:44] his laws to do anything if you've got an
[32:47] artesian well on this hill
[32:49] flowing water all over the air and on
[32:51] and on this other hill over here you've
[32:53] got a crop burning up you can stand on
[32:56] this hill and holler o water run over
[32:58] there and fill my crop I water get to my
[33:01] crop it'll never do it but if you'll
[33:03] walk a work according to the laws of
[33:05] gravitation you can water that crop I
[33:08] mean if you've got here or a sinner
[33:11] laying here or a man that wants to be
[33:12] right but he can't give up drinking tank
[33:15] about smoking can't give up lusts and
[33:16] things if you'll just work according to
[33:19] the laws of God let the Holy Spirit come
[33:21] in there then he's no more his own he
[33:24] will stop that thing
[33:25] because the Holy Ghost takes him over
[33:27] but you've got to work according to the
[33:30] laws of God the rules of God I mean now
[33:33] how many of you here's a young man in a
[33:35] wheelchair some stretcher cases little
[33:36] water here baby heart trouble stomach
[33:38] troubles and everything else sitting
[33:40] right here you're right in a dark spot
[33:43] aren't you now all the screaming you do
[33:45] to God that isn't it electricity will
[33:48] light up if you'll work according to the
[33:51] law of electricity is that right if you
[33:53] had an artesian well on this side now
[33:55] there's another quote I'm just I just
[33:57] writing them all together if you had an
[33:58] artesian well on this side of the hill
[34:00] a thousand gallons of water per minute
[34:02] no Ron that sigh the hell another hell
[34:05] you've got a crop burning up needing
[34:06] that water well no matter how much you'd
[34:09] scream to water go up on that hill and
[34:11] water that crop it'll never do it but if
[34:13] you walk it if you work according to the
[34:17] way of gravitation and run the water
[34:18] over on the hill it'll water the crop is
[34:20] that right but you've got to work
[34:22] according to the law of gravitation
[34:24] I mean well now if God is here is here
[34:27] all in this building right now do you
[34:29] believe that he says we're all
[34:31] conscience wish I can't get it all in
[34:33] one night you see you're conscious that
[34:36] God is here now the only thing we can do
[34:38] is work according to the law of God for
[34:40] our healing is that right what is the
[34:42] law of God he is love perfect love casts
[34:46] out all fear love and faith is the same
[34:48] thing see love perfect love casts out
[34:51] all fear which gives faith you see Amen
[34:56] so you know we have to work according to
[34:58] the laws of God
[34:59] now one illustration jesus said about
[35:03] the four types of of ground and he says
[35:07] one is one is the others you're the
[35:09] sower so is the seed then the birds come
[35:11] eat it up fly away and you're the weeds
[35:14] come and choke it out and all these
[35:15] things and he speaks about the weeds
[35:17] being the cares of life and different
[35:18] things so you know what what good
[35:21] nothing see what happens is we come into
[35:23] church now I'm not saying you do what
[35:25] I'm about to illustrate but this is
[35:26] working against the laws of God who
[35:29] should brother Brahim say how how
[35:30] churches are praying for a revival
[35:32] working right against it see so so
[35:35] they're not they weren't working toward
[35:37] your with the law of God was the law of
[35:39] God Lord empty me out change my life
[35:42] that I don't come to you according to
[35:44] what I think but change my thinking to
[35:46] match your word that you can do what you
[35:48] want in my life see that is working with
[35:51] the laws of God but to work work against
[35:53] it with the parable of the sower is that
[35:56] is that was a good of being having a
[35:57] wonderful service God moving pouring his
[36:00] spirit out and then we go and let the
[36:02] kids of life choke it out or we go and
[36:04] do something that's actually fills us
[36:06] with unbelief and superstition and doubt
[36:08] you know you're just working against
[36:10] what God has tried to do in the service
[36:12] you see so we don't just want
[36:14] what you know yours the Apostle Paul
[36:17] would say we don't want to race run this
[36:20] race with uncertainty you know we don't
[36:22] just want to fight the air and
[36:24] haphazardly run around and you know we
[36:26] want to walk according to how God wants
[36:28] us to walk you know what you know what
[36:30] good is that you know as the scripture
[36:32] says one principle of the scripture says
[36:34] father's provoke not your children to
[36:36] anger least they become discouraged at
[36:39] least they just give up and say who
[36:40] cares I'm not gonna serve God I'm sick
[36:42] of this I'm oh yeah why because they're
[36:43] being pushed down all the time being
[36:45] being frustrated that is work but of
[36:48] course the fathers how it would be
[36:49] honestly my children love the Lord but
[36:51] if they treat the child the wrong way
[36:53] they are working against the law of God
[36:56] I mean so you know we're gonna there's a
[37:00] lot of things in the scripture that
[37:01] equip us I mean that if we now we know
[37:03] we can follow the scripture to the
[37:06] leader bond this God comes on the scene
[37:08] it won't do any good but you got to give
[37:10] God something to work with
[37:12] no brother Brahim he would say that he
[37:14] was meditating on the scripture of of of
[37:16] mark 11 maybe you want to throw that up
[37:19] mark 11:23 I believe it is 22 to 26 and
[37:22] you know when when brother Brown was out
[37:24] hunting and and he was thinking about
[37:26] how how yo Jesus would would say
[37:29] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[37:31] mountain be thou removed and cast into
[37:33] the sea and shall not doubt it in his
[37:36] heart but shall believe that all those
[37:38] things which he saith shall come to pass
[37:40] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[37:42] therefore I say unto you what things
[37:44] soever you desire when you pray believe
[37:46] that you receive them and you shall have
[37:48] them so so the Prophet was thinking
[37:50] about the scripture now this is this is
[37:52] another kind of principle if you want
[37:54] God to come upon the scene think about
[37:56] him remember the tur on the way to
[37:58] Emmaus and they are talking about what
[37:59] God was doing in their day right they
[38:01] were talking about the crucifixion they
[38:03] talked about what Jesus you know all the
[38:04] miracles and the healing and the
[38:06] salvation and Lazarus coming out of the
[38:08] grave and the storms being silenced and
[38:10] all those incredible things they were
[38:12] talking about what God was doing in
[38:13] their day they couldn't quite put it
[38:15] together but they're talking about him
[38:18] and if you want him to draw near talk
[38:20] about him I mean who's ever had some
[38:22] fellowship run a conversation you feel
[38:24] the atmosphere just changes you talk
[38:25] about the Lord why that's him drawing
[38:27] near
[38:28] I mean because what we want we pray that
[38:30] God would anoint our fellowship that
[38:32] what we took about the supernatural
[38:34] would take place right because we're a
[38:36] people of the supernatural library we
[38:38] need a supernatural God to do
[38:40] supernatural things I mean it's not a
[38:42] natural just serving God as a man would
[38:44] naturally that though that it is good
[38:47] that's not gonna do it we need God to
[38:50] come upon the sees salvation is a
[38:52] supernatural thing someone gives it
[38:54] heart to God it's a supernatural thing
[38:56] someone repents it's a supernatural
[38:57] thing right I mean hallelujah so you
[39:01] know we need God to come in a
[39:03] supernatural way so brother Branham was
[39:04] thinking about the scripture and then
[39:07] and then the Lord begin to deal with him
[39:10] and challenge him about well what are
[39:13] you out doing I'm hunting what are you
[39:16] hunting squirrels what do you need
[39:17] squirrels well say let there be a
[39:20] squirrel you know the story but he was
[39:22] thinking on the scripture and then God
[39:25] came to interpret that scripture to him
[39:27] the Prophet sees who wouldn't be
[39:29] wonderful for God to interpret the
[39:30] scripture to you you know actually prove
[39:32] it to you in your life how it's more
[39:35] than just well this is how you're just
[39:36] remembering it or yo yo but God comes
[39:38] down says I want to prove the scripture
[39:40] in your life I want to show you what I
[39:41] meant
[39:42] amen you know that's I would like that
[39:44] myself so he's thinking about these
[39:47] things and then the Lord came down and
[39:49] you know the rest of the story as he
[39:51] spoke and the squirrels were created
[39:52] exactly where he said there'd be but the
[39:56] principle I'm trying to get across now
[39:57] is that he was thinking on the scripture
[39:59] I mean so we're going to really think
[40:02] about what takes up our mental space
[40:05] what takes up these top two inches at
[40:08] all for me maybe one inch I don't know
[40:09] how much is there but you know you know
[40:11] what what takes up because remember we
[40:13] have the same 24 hours in a day that
[40:15] that anyone else has in the world right
[40:18] but but what is going on in here because
[40:21] we are a steward of this yeah we're a
[40:24] steward of this right this is the thing
[40:26] God said well he say you know this thing
[40:28] we've got to protect it hallelujah mean
[40:32] but God doesn't just push a button and
[40:33] now I'm a robot
[40:34] any-any just punches in a function I do
[40:36] this I go do this no no we have a free
[40:38] moral agency in the matter
[40:42] right so it's up to local who we going
[40:44] to give our choice to and really who
[40:46] you've given your choice to will really
[40:48] be a for a large part what goes on in
[40:50] here it doesn't mean the devil won't
[40:52] come in here and try and battle you in
[40:53] war but it depends what you give
[40:54] yourself to I mean so you know we're
[40:57] going to think about I trust we you know
[41:00] sure we have to think about our job and
[41:01] what we're gonna eat what we're gonna
[41:02] you know where we're going to live all
[41:04] those natural things we can't forsake
[41:05] them but when it comes to everything
[41:08] else what do we think upon because maybe
[41:12] you know to me we you got to give God
[41:14] something to work with Here I am Lord
[41:16] work with me Lord let through my life
[41:19] amen
[41:21] brother Brahim said in perfect faith
[41:23] when he's relating about the squirrels
[41:25] being created he sees the Great
[41:27] Physician who is here who said these
[41:29] signs shall follow them that belief if
[41:31] they lay their hands on the sick they
[41:33] shall recover and if they say to this
[41:35] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[41:37] your heart but can believe if he can
[41:39] create squirrels who has who has no way
[41:43] at all or nothing there to believe
[41:45] that's my own faith that goes and does
[41:47] that my faith and what he challenged me
[41:49] to ask he challenged me to ask it I
[41:52] received his challenge and obedience to
[41:55] his word I asked it and it appeared God
[41:58] and heaven knows that's true can he also
[42:01] heal the sick can he lift me up with the
[42:03] faith pardon me this away even for
[42:05] people even if they can't climb up to
[42:07] that bracket if they can't do it he can
[42:09] use my faith he can lift me to that
[42:11] place I'm climbing for you I'm believing
[42:13] for you I'm speaking for you he see and
[42:16] and and to me that's a powerful
[42:18] statement but but that should be how
[42:19] Christians should be I'm gonna believe
[42:21] for my brother I'm gonna believe for my
[42:23] sister I'm gonna lift them up before God
[42:25] I'm gonna create an atmosphere I'm gonna
[42:27] be friendly to them I'm gonna you know
[42:28] be their buddy I'm gonna help them along
[42:30] life's journey but I'm gonna be
[42:32] believing for them that's how we should
[42:34] be shouldn't we yeah I mean it doesn't
[42:36] matter what lion's then we get thrown
[42:38] into it we should be believing I mean
[42:39] they're gonna come out back in the
[42:41] victory cuz the Lord's going to bring
[42:43] them through it
[42:44] Allu you so the Lord challenged him to
[42:47] take him at his word but he was thinking
[42:50] about that scripture amen you know
[42:57] the Apostle Paul would say if we can
[43:03] just go back to I believe it was theirs
[43:08] in Philippians for the end of the script
[43:11] into the well Philippians 4 invoice he
[43:14] has rejoiced in the Lord all the way and
[43:16] again I say rejoice let your moderation
[43:19] be known unto all men the Lord is at
[43:21] hand be careful for nothing but in
[43:24] everything by prayer and supplication
[43:26] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[43:28] made known unto God now we know we're
[43:30] just going to pause it just there he
[43:32] says but in everything by prayer and
[43:34] supplication prayer is the most
[43:37] empowering on the earth prayer and their
[43:40] prayer in the heart of the believer is
[43:42] incredible powerful thing I mean we know
[43:45] that prayer amen can change Nations
[43:47] prayer can bring salvation prayer can
[43:50] bring deliverance prayer can bring
[43:52] healing
[43:53] I mean prayer can take people from
[43:54] darkness into light I mean prick and
[43:57] change someone's eternal destination
[43:59] hallelujah prayer is the most powerful
[44:01] thing I'm a prick and deliverer from
[44:03] demon power I'm in prayer can cast the
[44:05] demons away and bring the Holy Ghost on
[44:07] the scene
[44:07] maybe that's why prayer can do I mean if
[44:09] prayer is incredibly powerful I mean so
[44:12] she's been in everything by prayer and
[44:13] supplications they mean with
[44:15] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[44:16] known unto God now we know that our God
[44:19] is not an errand boy I mean he's not
[44:21] someone we make him do stuff he's not
[44:24] like one of our children says go do this
[44:26] pick this up do this that's not how we
[44:27] treat God amen he's not you know you
[44:31] don't just give him a to-do list only
[44:33] and say I've got this need this need
[44:34] this need Amen Jesus Christ's name Amen
[44:36] good boy you know but that's not always
[44:38] the case because we know prayer is not
[44:41] just - you know we know brother Brahim
[44:43] says that prayer can change the mind of
[44:45] God right you can actually intercede for
[44:47] someone and actually change the mind of
[44:50] God and God worked on their behalf
[44:52] but prayer first and foremost in my
[44:55] opinion should be not to change God's
[44:57] mind it should be to change our mind I
[44:59] mean because remember Jesus and now we
[45:02] just took that scripture from from Mark
[45:04] one but Jesus was a man of Prayer right
[45:08] he resorted many
[45:09] times two a lot of time and prayer and
[45:11] it's because the man part of him had to
[45:13] stay in fellowship head to stand
[45:15] communion with the God that was in on
[45:16] the inside of him right that's why he
[45:19] was a man of prayer to stay and oneness
[45:21] with the Father dwelling on the inside
[45:24] of him and now if the Son of God who was
[45:26] virgin born without sin had to be that
[45:29] way how much more sinners saved by grace
[45:31] how much more the redeemed ones of the
[45:33] earth amen
[45:34] so I believe that prayer first and
[45:36] foremost should be Lord changed my
[45:38] thinking to match your thinking and
[45:40] every single situation my brother says
[45:45] to have an order against me Lord change
[45:46] my thinking that I would think as you
[45:48] would think towards them that there's a
[45:50] sinner that's done me wrong Lord changed
[45:52] my thinking that I don't want to get one
[45:54] back at them but Lord I want to throw I
[45:56] want to stand in the gap for them that
[45:58] Lord your mercy would fall upon them it
[46:01] should matter how we be amen I mean so
[46:04] so it should be you know because your
[46:06] man is an incredibly selfish thing we're
[46:10] born with every bone of selfish
[46:13] mimimi III now now now you know and if
[46:16] not now when
[46:17] and I want it now and we live in this
[46:20] instant age but when you meet the Lord
[46:25] it's not my will but thy will be done
[46:28] remember Jesus Jesus one Calvary and
[46:31] Gethsemane amen he won the victory on
[46:34] his knees when he surrended as well over
[46:36] hallelujah remember his ministry started
[46:40] and death to self and it ended in death
[46:43] to self because he went to the Jordan we
[46:45] know that Jordan is a representation of
[46:47] death amen and he was baptized in the
[46:50] River Jordan so so it started and death
[46:52] and it ended and death
[46:54] he's our example and we all want to be
[46:57] like Jesus right so that means we're
[47:00] going to start with a real death not
[47:01] just a conviction not just all I did
[47:04] wrong but a real full death because the
[47:06] problem as many people get convicted
[47:08] they get wounded but they don't lay
[47:10] themselves completely on the altar and
[47:12] they go for a period and wrong but now
[47:14] they've got to die on the altar I mean a
[47:16] hab was a such a man I have tried to
[47:19] find favor with God and everything got
[47:21] fine he just went back to doing
[47:23] he did but never fully surrendered to
[47:24] the Word of God we don't want to be in a
[47:27] hab throwing out old Tantrums and so on
[47:30] but we've covered that so we won't go
[47:32] back to that one Amen see you know but
[47:35] we lord help us you say why are you
[47:39] trying to say these things we're living
[47:41] in a crazy time we're living in a crazy
[47:44] time and it's going to get crazier so we
[47:47] need to be balanced in a crazy time and
[47:49] the only way we will stay balanced in
[47:51] this time is if we stay one with the
[47:53] Lord
[47:54] right there's not our flesh driving us
[47:56] or our spirit you know the problem is
[47:58] the devil you're the worst thing we can
[48:00] do is sympathize with a spirit right if
[48:04] you simple sir if you sympathize with a
[48:07] spirit you come under its influence see
[48:10] see someone with you know you know some
[48:12] depression devil on them or some pride
[48:14] feeling sorry for themselves
[48:15] devil you start sympathizing with that
[48:17] it'll come on you right but eventually
[48:20] stand in the gap for your brother or for
[48:22] your system amen then you can really
[48:24] pray for them then you can deliver them
[48:26] I mean but that but was the devil do he
[48:28] works on emotion he works on emotion you
[48:32] know someone hurt you you feel offended
[48:34] and he takes a defense any any and he
[48:37] tries to breathe into the coals and make
[48:39] it a lot worse and makes it grow in your
[48:40] mind and next thing you know you're just
[48:42] living through a big complex instead of
[48:45] giving it to the Lord and being free
[48:51] amen but Jesus was a man of Prayer the
[48:54] Apostle Paul was a man of prayer brother
[48:56] Brown was a man of Prayer I'm not
[48:59] talking about time necessarily but
[49:01] quality you know you can be driving down
[49:03] the road God comes on the scene you can
[49:05] be in your prayer closet
[49:06] God comes on the scene they're all
[49:08] important I meant but as King David said
[49:13] may the words of my mouth and the
[49:14] meditations of my heart be acceptable in
[49:16] thy sight o my strength in my Redeemer
[49:19] amen so it can be it can be five minutes
[49:23] five hours whatever it is whatever you
[49:26] need to do but prayer is very powerful
[49:31] amen and if they should be a praying
[49:33] people of this hour should be the Bride
[49:34] of Christ
[49:35] not to put a man-made thing upon you but
[49:38] we should be lord give us a burden as
[49:40] brother and Paul preached a while ago
[49:42] give us a burden of Prayer I mean not a
[49:44] man generate a burden but a god-given
[49:46] burden I mean cuz the victory is won in
[49:50] prayer our belief I mean so and so be
[49:55] careful for nothing but in everything by
[49:57] prayer and supplication with
[49:58] Thanksgiving that you're a crispy made
[50:00] known unto God now I uh I won't get to
[50:03] verse 7 but you know we should always be
[50:06] on the lookout for lost souls we should
[50:10] be mission minded I mean because
[50:12] remember as I said on Sunday what's our
[50:14] purpose our purpose is to find that last
[50:17] one they were going home and that could
[50:20] be anywhere anyone any place any time
[50:23] could be that last one and we're going
[50:25] to keep that on our mind Lord where do
[50:27] you want me to be to find that last one
[50:30] shouldn't it be we should be mission
[50:32] mind at all we need to go to Ecuador no
[50:33] no they're probably next door brother
[50:36] Tony Emma said don't go to Nick amigo
[50:38] until you go next door right
[50:41] that could be your neighbor who knows
[50:43] they could be your school they could be
[50:45] at your job they could be anywhere but
[50:47] the thing is if we stay in in in
[50:50] fellowship with the Lord that is not us
[50:52] our mind our opinions but it's his mind
[50:56] his word living then wherever he takes
[50:58] us we'll be content wherever he takes us
[51:00] you know the Apostle Paul went through
[51:03] incredible things and he lists them
[51:05] shipwrecked beaten stoned peril
[51:09] you know peril on the sea pair of the
[51:11] land robbers all those things he would
[51:14] he was actually so kind of poor that
[51:16] that he'd write to Timothy and say when
[51:18] winter's coming I need my coat this is
[51:21] the kind of state heals in but he said
[51:23] and well I think we'll get to it but he
[51:25] says I found you know to be content and
[51:29] in you when you're stoned he was in the
[51:31] will of God when his imprison is in the
[51:33] will of God
[51:34] he's been shipwrecked is in the will of
[51:35] God when the snake venom is in the will
[51:37] of God I mean when he is when he is in
[51:39] trouble by false brother and whoever
[51:41] he's in the will of God hallelujah he
[51:44] didn't let those things move him
[51:46] why because he stayed and fell
[51:48] ship with the God on the inside of him
[51:50] when the Holy Ghost came into her may
[51:52] many stayed and fellowship with the God
[51:53] that was leading him yeah I mean
[51:55] remember the scripture says that the
[51:56] sons of God who lived by the Spirit of
[51:58] God it means that's us I mean so we
[52:01] gotta stay because remember it's either
[52:03] our flesh can lead us or the Spirit of
[52:05] God it depends who you pander to right
[52:10] amen because yo yeah I know I've said it
[52:13] before but you know we know when we're
[52:14] carnal we know you know you know when
[52:17] here in that Carter you're in carnal
[52:19] mode oh lord help us but he know when
[52:22] the law when you repent in the spirit
[52:23] Lord and that sweetness comes back
[52:26] hallelujah I mean so so he went through
[52:29] many things but he didn't get upset
[52:31] about it
[52:32] I don't read in the scripture knew her
[52:37] as a pity party where he starts to get
[52:39] angry at God upset Lord why did you let
[52:42] this happen he was in a jail with Silas
[52:45] and they begin to pray they'd just been
[52:48] beaten they're in the inner prison
[52:50] now the other prisons the nasty one
[52:51] that's the yucky one on the inside the
[52:53] gloomy damp thing he wasn't that one
[52:55] with Silas and they begin to pray oh and
[52:58] they begin to worship God they didn't
[53:00] worry about their beatings in there and
[53:02] their rejection and all those things
[53:04] they just begin to praise God and God
[53:06] came down in their press press service
[53:08] and their worship hallelujah amen
[53:10] because what I guess maybe they realized
[53:13] maybe Paul said Silas
[53:15] yes Paul we're here for a reason do you
[53:19] think we're just saying wrong Paul nope
[53:21] why is that we preach the truth while
[53:26] we're here I don't know why don't we
[53:28] just pray isn't he wonderful Silas oh so
[53:30] wonderful
[53:30] Paul I was blind but now I see he's my
[53:34] Redeemer
[53:35] I heard about a god but now he lives
[53:37] he's more than a story to me Oh Silas I
[53:40] was a Pharisee of the Pharisees I was up
[53:42] to here in religion I thought I was the
[53:44] greatest thing upon the earth
[53:45] hallelujah since Moses but then I meet
[53:47] him I meant the quyllur of fire
[53:49] Oh let's sing a song Paul Holly what
[53:51] should we sing I don't know I'm not
[53:53] gonna try but you know but it's what's
[53:57] on the inside comes out you know
[54:01] when you squeeze an orange you get
[54:02] orange juice right these are saying you
[54:05] can't get blood from a turnip because
[54:06] there's no blood in a turnip you can't
[54:08] get blood from a stone because there's
[54:09] no blood in the stone but what do you
[54:10] squeeze you'll get out I mean what the
[54:12] thing you squeeze you get out so when
[54:15] the believer comes under pressure what
[54:18] comes out is what's on the inside of
[54:20] them you know we can all have it's very
[54:22] easy to be a believer reps you really
[54:26] win your Sunday night at a convention
[54:28] there's no problems the devil is just
[54:31] far far away you're having a jubilee
[54:34] time it's very easy isn't it
[54:36] everything's fine
[54:38] glory Lord I'm ready now where's your
[54:40] calendar I'm sure it's today we're going
[54:43] but it's in the hard times when the
[54:46] pressure comes on it really shows what
[54:48] you're made of lord help us when you
[54:51] squeeze us I mean when you trice will
[54:52] come forth as gold amen
[54:56] so we should always be mission minded
[54:58] you know Philip he was having he was
[55:00] there leading a revival and God told him
[55:03] never go down to the desert he wasn't
[55:06] disappointed they snore him fussing
[55:08] saying but it's perfect here Lord no no
[55:10] he was he was a and oneness with the
[55:13] Lord that led him doesn't that right and
[55:16] he went down there and met the Ethiopian
[55:18] eunuch and you know the rest of story
[55:19] but the thing is wherever we find
[55:21] ourselves we should be Lord there must
[55:23] be a soul here there's a reason I'm in
[55:26] this place it's not just for me it's
[55:28] must be for someone else Shirley chin
[55:30] that should that be our our our heart
[55:33] we're here for a purpose to be a witness
[55:37] remember it's not about how successful
[55:39] that you gauge your walk with God
[55:40] remember when we're led into heaven I
[55:43] say well done my good and faithful
[55:45] servant
[55:46] good and faithful not good and what you
[55:49] thought was successful he said well I've
[55:51] never you know I've never done something
[55:53] great for God just living for him as an
[55:55] incredible thing I mean whatever he says
[55:58] this is this is your purpose you're
[56:00] gonna be housewife be the best one be a
[56:02] father be the best one being a worker be
[56:04] the best from whatever you are in life
[56:05] just be the best one whatever your
[56:08] purpose of life is and you say well done
[56:10] my good and faithful amen hallelujah
[56:13] amen
[56:15] so we should be faithful and whatever
[56:16] the Lord's putting our hands and
[56:18] whatever state we find ourselves in we
[56:21] should be content amen
[56:26] verse seven and the peace of God which
[56:30] passeth passes all understanding shall
[56:33] keep your hearts and minds through
[56:35] Christ Jesus and now notice he's saying
[56:37] this finally brethren remember if I put
[56:41] a title this I said you know working
[56:43] according to the laws of God so Paul is
[56:46] giving some instruction finally my
[56:49] brethren whatsoever things are true
[56:50] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[56:53] things are just whatsoever things are
[56:56] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[56:57] whatsoever things are have a good report
[57:00] if there be any virtue if there be any
[57:02] praise think on these things so I think
[57:06] it's a good idea you're a thought starts
[57:09] wandering from this lobe to the next
[57:11] lobe to the frontal lobe and you know
[57:13] you should begin to think does it fit in
[57:14] these categories right instead of just
[57:18] letting your imagination wander yes
[57:20] right you know the devil's imaginations
[57:22] just been released on this age through
[57:25] through entertainment through social
[57:28] media the internet that's just his
[57:30] inspiration his imaginations just popped
[57:32] out over everywhere so we're going to
[57:34] really think about it now when we when
[57:36] we think on something is it true is it
[57:40] honest as a pure is it lovely
[57:45] is it of a good report doesn't have any
[57:48] virtue or does it weaken your faith if
[57:52] there be any praise think on those
[57:53] things think on these things remember
[57:56] got to give God's own to work with we
[57:58] don't want to we don't want to frustrate
[57:59] the grace of God by actually working
[58:01] against his word his will those things
[58:07] which he have both learned and received
[58:09] and heard and seen in me do and the God
[58:12] of peace be with you but I rejoice in
[58:14] the Lord greatly that now at last your
[58:17] care of me heaven has flourished again
[58:20] wherein ye were also careful but ye
[58:23] lacked opportunity not that I speak in
[58:26] respect of
[58:27] for I have learned in whatsoever state I
[58:30] am therewith to be content he sees
[58:33] another place to content with godliness
[58:36] is great gain I mean so so whatever
[58:39] state you're in just be content I'm
[58:42] living on the street big content I have
[58:46] all things be content the one thing I
[58:48] wanted
[58:49] just just be content I just lost it all
[58:51] be content right as I said about the
[58:55] Apostle Paul he suffered many things it
[58:57] wasn't God dealing with him right God
[59:01] allowed him to go through those things
[59:03] sure but it God wasn't angry at the man
[59:06] amen so whatever state I'm in just be
[59:10] content why cuz I got a home over yonder
[59:12] I've got something that the world can
[59:14] buy Jeff what Benz or whatever his name
[59:19] is he has his fortune when I bought know
[59:21] how many tens of billions of dollars but
[59:23] he can't buy what I have right I know
[59:29] both had to be a based and I know how to
[59:32] abound everywhere in all things I am
[59:36] instructed both to be full and to be
[59:38] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[59:43] amen so the Apostle Paul learnt these
[59:46] things he was just content amen we know
[59:51] the thorn and the flesh that the other
[59:52] the other mischief from Satan buffeting
[59:54] him he sought the Lord that he'd be
[59:57] delivered of that right but he never
[1:00:00] complained at all and then and then once
[1:00:03] the Lord said my grace is sufficient for
[1:00:04] the he just rejoiced right but he never
[1:00:07] complained to God if he was hungry he
[1:00:09] never complained if he was cold he never
[1:00:11] complained he just walked on with God
[1:00:13] because remember our contentment should
[1:00:16] not be in our material positions how
[1:00:18] much everyone likes us how much
[1:00:20] everything's going well our contingent
[1:00:22] should be in our salvation and the God
[1:00:24] that we have believed in amen
[1:00:28] now so that's how we should be now as I
[1:00:35] said so those from expectation and the
[1:00:38] only way I know to do is prayer prayer
[1:00:40] is the key it's the
[1:00:41] answer prayer changes things prayer is
[1:00:43] the most powerful weapon that was ever
[1:00:45] put into the control of human beings
[1:00:46] there is no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb
[1:00:49] as powerful as prayer prayer will change
[1:00:51] the mind of God I mean if you stand in
[1:00:53] the gap say Lord be merciful to these
[1:00:55] ones you can change God's mind about
[1:00:57] someone Amen but we should we should
[1:01:05] always pray first and foremost Lord
[1:01:07] change my thinking you know the devil
[1:01:11] will give you the world if he can heal
[1:01:13] heal anoint your imagination with what
[1:01:15] you could be but don't follow that say
[1:01:21] Lord what do you want what do you have
[1:01:23] for my life whatever that may be we all
[1:01:26] have a different path to walk with him
[1:01:28] right we all have to express something
[1:01:30] different you know maybe some of us will
[1:01:33] go like jog through great suffering
[1:01:34] right some will maybe have what appears
[1:01:37] to be an easier walk but the battle will
[1:01:40] be different right but God has a
[1:01:43] predestinate path for us to take but are
[1:01:46] we willing are we surrendered to to walk
[1:01:48] it with him that's the challenge
[1:01:51] maybe but this message is not a picnic
[1:01:53] it's a battlefield as rugged brother
[1:01:55] Brandon says guys looking for rugged
[1:01:57] Christians I mean not not not not a
[1:02:01] hotbed plant but a rugged hallelujah and
[1:02:05] I believe he makes us rugged Christians
[1:02:07] he puts something in us some grit I mean
[1:02:09] that whatever the devil fires at us we
[1:02:11] can just overcome and keep walking on I
[1:02:13] believe we can make us don't you holy
[1:02:16] but the key is Lord changed my thinking
[1:02:19] that it's your thinking
[1:02:23] amen as Christ won the victory in the
[1:02:26] garden by saying not my will but thy
[1:02:27] will be done that's how we all overcome
[1:02:30] as well you say but I've got rights I've
[1:02:34] got rights to be angry I got rights to
[1:02:36] hold resentment I've got rights to do
[1:02:37] what I want to do sure but a Christian
[1:02:40] forfeits its rights if we're sheep who's
[1:02:44] ever done shearing or docking anyone how
[1:02:49] old
[1:02:50] we're Swiss with a towel tapes
[1:02:54] okay I was AIDS as age and I helped pick
[1:02:56] up lambs to be docked there actually not
[1:02:59] this once you get a hold of them not
[1:03:00] that I wasn't strong but you know but
[1:03:03] you know once you get a hold of them
[1:03:04] they stop kicking let's just give up
[1:03:07] there they are
[1:03:08] hey they see their friends this got you
[1:03:10] know doctrine but they just kind of that
[1:03:13] and they just accept work because
[1:03:14] they've given up their rights you know
[1:03:16] we don't want to have some kind of
[1:03:18] nature as a goat kicking and fussing and
[1:03:20] but at all that's going on no no you say
[1:03:23] Lord he said well I feel that way say
[1:03:25] Lord changed my nature did I get the
[1:03:28] nature of a lamb because remember as the
[1:03:31] Lord in a nature of a dove son of God a
[1:03:34] nature of a lamb and they and those two
[1:03:35] natures blended together and that's the
[1:03:38] only two natures that will blend
[1:03:39] together and that's how we want to be
[1:03:43] well how do I do that you just got to
[1:03:45] give it all over Christianity is
[1:03:49] self-denial right if any man's gonna
[1:03:53] follow me take up has let him take up us
[1:03:56] cross deny himself and follow me I mean
[1:03:59] in an age where everyone wants their
[1:04:01] rights the believer is the only one that
[1:04:03] doesn't want their rights they want the
[1:04:05] Lord to have control I mean so I'm just
[1:04:09] gonna we'll pick it up some other time
[1:04:12] Oh who wants to work according to the
[1:04:15] laws of God I don't to be like the
[1:04:18] farmer on one side with the teaching
[1:04:20] well and the crop on farm the other hill
[1:04:21] saying water go over there it's not
[1:04:23] going to do any good
[1:04:24] we're going to work according to the
[1:04:27] laws of God isn't that right I don't
[1:04:30] want to read the Bible and then forget
[1:04:32] it instantly you forget what I've read
[1:04:34] about walk off and think about something
[1:04:36] else it doesn't help me right
[1:04:39] anyway so we have we have sister Maggie
[1:04:45] scene to prayer request a little earlier
[1:04:47] I think her name is Leah everyday she's
[1:04:51] alive as a miracle we're gonna keep
[1:04:53] praying for her she's born very
[1:04:55] premature add a zero on us ever have a
[1:04:57] prayer request father James

[1:05:13] anyone else
[1:05:17] boffo night man
[1:05:20] absolutely my brother stabilized in
[1:05:35] heart and he'll be just the recovery and
[1:05:40] my grandfather deteriorated a bit while
[1:05:43] she was in hospital and it's looking
[1:05:47] like you're holding there to the
[1:05:48] transitory to a home and so she just
[1:05:51] asked here I'm in the right place
[1:05:54] Luna man and then she just wants to
[1:05:57] trust him and once time they transition

[1:07:13] top of them what have you called it back
[1:07:16] 10 15 years ago but he also wants to
[1:07:18] help that'll sound amusing but I think
[1:07:23] it's also the Lord opening up an
[1:07:24] opportunity okay man what just film
[1:07:26] about six years ago and he was quite
[1:07:29] receptive but still held by drugs and
[1:07:32] right and you know his own instant
[1:07:36] gratification measures that he had I
[1:07:38] don't know where is that now but he
[1:07:41] wants to help because of the Lord he
[1:07:45] wants to help Christians so it could be
[1:07:47] that the music that he makes us all
[1:07:50] masters for us will be a testimony to
[1:07:53] help them yeah
