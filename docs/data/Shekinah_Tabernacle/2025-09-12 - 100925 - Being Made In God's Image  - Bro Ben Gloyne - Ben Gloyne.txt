Thank you, musicians. Appreciate the atmosphere. Amen. God bless you all tonight. Good to have everyone here. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's um let's go in the scripture to um Genesis chapter 1 and um just going to read a couple of verses here. Then we're going to go to First Kings 19 and um yeah, we're just going to read this here. I mean, so Genesis 1 and 26-28. Amen. And it says, "And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Amen. Then we're going to go to First Kings, just a bit of a uh I trust the context. I trust this all tied together. Uh so first Kings 19, going to read verses 19 to 21. Amen. We're all there. So, I'm a quick off the quick out of the blocks. Amen. So, yeah. First Kings 19 and 19-21 says this says, "So he departed uh then found Elisha the son of Chafat who was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen before him. And he with the 12th and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him. And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I'll follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go back again. What I what for what have I done to thee?" And he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. Amen. Let's uh let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight. If you have a need, just want to slip your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me in this time." Amen. Let's pray. Gracious Father, you see that hands have been raised up all around the building, Lord. No doubt those who are streaming as well, Father. Lord, we lift our hands. We have needs, Lord. We have burdens. We got things in our lives, Lord, that we need you to come and minister to to change. Father, you see every uh you know the reason why we've lifted up our hands. I pray, dear God, you come and your great grace touch each of our lives, Lord. Not just here, but those who are watching by the way of YouTube. May you be our portion this night. Lord, we just desire more than anything that your word would change us from glory to glory. We love you, Lord. We thank you. You first loved us and died for us on Calvar's tree. Thank you for your allsufficient sacrifice. We love you, Lord. I just pray you'd touch every life, Lord. Those, Lord, who are sick and body as well, who are not here, be their portion, too. Father, we lift them into your presence by prayer, committing the service into your hands, Lord. Asking you'd cover us in your blood. May your preeminence take complete control, Lord, for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats uh tonight. I was I was quite struck. I really enjoyed Brother Isaac's um service last well, two Sundays ago, and um it really struck me how how so um well, I'll just put this up then we'll come back to what we're talking about. But you know there's um there was recently uh in in China there was this humanoid uh robot games and some people have said humans keep building robots that are shaped like us. What's the point? And to me as brother Isaac was bringing out about artificial intelligence and all the effort and energy that man has put into building these things and we know the wisdom of man is fullness in the sight of God. But you see it's it's it's within man to build something in his image. He can't help it. He's he's all of technology, the apex really of all of our technological advancements will be a robot or something that's made in the image of man because God made man in God's image. And so because we are made in the image of God, then we have a burden along to make something like us. You see? And so, so that's why, you know, because, you know, people will argue, what's the point in making a robot that's like a man? It's not the best shape. It's not the best structure to move things, carry things, not the most stable, not the fastest, but yet it because it's it's it's within man to drive man to make something like him. He can't help it. He's going to put all of his technology towards it. We can see it, you know. But you see, it's because we were made in the image of God. And because we're made in the image of God, we want to make something like us that we can have fellowship with, that we can commune with, that we can fall in love with, we can have a relationship with. That's why, you know, nowadays there's, I think brother Isaac brought it up, but, you know, there's there's a avatars that people want to marry. You know, these chat bots they fall in love with. They build relationships. And, you know, it's because God made someone to love. &gt;&gt; And so, because we're made in the image of God, we want to make something to love. And this is why people have made this technology because they want something to love. &gt;&gt; Because we're made in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Man can't help it. The thing is though, God doesn't want us to be in the image of man. He wants us to be in the image of fallen man. He wants us to be in his image. Now, we understand from Genesis chapter 1 that when God created man in his own image, that image that he first made man in was a spirit man. He created him as as Jesus would say to the woman at the well, God is a spirit and they worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. So when God made man, male and female, he made him as a as a spirit man. And then as we come down to Genesis chapter 2, it says, "And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the earth." Now this word formed is not the same as create. Create is you you make something out of nothing. But to form something is like you take some clay. Who's ever done that in art? You at school. You take a lump of clay and you make something, right? You make a vase or a cup and normally blows up in the kiln if you ever get that far. But you see, you form that thing out of clay. And so God formed the physical body of man out of the dust of the earth. And then he put that spirit man within the natural man. I put it that way. And so now, but then of course the full expression of the image of God then was when Eve came out of Adam, right? Because what did uh because when when when man became material, what was he? One. He wasn't three people. He was one person &gt;&gt; with the woman inside him and then she became expressed and that's the image of God. Man and woman together united. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when So that's why the trinity doesn't work from the very beginning. Okay. What was the what did he make? He made one. &gt;&gt; Didn't make three. Okay. And then now when when um God would look down and see Adam in this body of flesh before Eve was taken out of him uh you know God would God would look at Adam this the apex of his creation and say it's not good that he's dwelling alone. You know, God when he made everything else, he said it's good or very good. But when he saw man alone, he says it's not good because he was he was signifying uh Adam's loneliness was was was signifying his own loneliness, if I put it that way. Because God was dwelling alone with his thoughts, but he didn't want to just dwell alone with his thoughts. He wanted to dwell with his family. He wanted them to be expressed. He wanted them to be around him, to have a relationship with him. And then so what happened was God would cause a deep sleep to to to come over Adam and he you know took the rib out and and uh medical science has proven that you can take a rib out a certain way and it'll grow back cuz you know it used to stumble people when when when you count the number of ribs on a man it's the same on both sides, right? There's not one missing. And well the reason is is if you cut a rib out a certain way it grows back. One of the few bones that'll do it. God's a good surgeon. &gt;&gt; He doesn't do a hack job. Okay, he doesn't leave a big scar. He does a perfect job. But the thing is, he didn't just take out the physical rib. He actually took out the feminist spirit out of Adam and and and put that put that in what we call Eve, you know, the woman. And so now there the two of them were God's perfect masterpiece. And brother Bram would say that that that after after he made this masterpiece that the that the devil came in and and and slithered under the walls of of the Garden of Eden and broke that masterpiece. And so now what happened? But then of course, God being the master sculptor and the victorious one wouldn't just leave his masterpiece sitting there in ruin in sin, you know, broken up. He says, "I'm going to rebuild this and it's going to be better than it ever was in the beginning." Okay? Because remember, we're built in a condition that we can't fall, right? Our souls are sealed to the day of our redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot fall. We're actually in a position. You say, "Well, I'm in this body of flesh." Yes, but you're in a bit better state than Eve and Adam were in the garden because you can't fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. They fell. They fell in paradise. We stand in Satan's Eden by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now Adam and Eve, there they are in the garden. They're fallen and and then and then of course God wanted wanted man to reproduce himself as more gods upon the earth, &gt;&gt; right? But then now in Genesis 5 when when it picks up the generation, it says this is the book of the generations of Adam. So basically what you're going to read now is the family tree of Adam and Eve. This is it right in the day that God created him in the likeness of God made he him. Male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day that they were created. And Adam lived 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name Seth. So notice it's it doesn't say Adam lived 130 years and begat a son in the image of God. No, in Adam's own fallen image, he be to produce. He was Seth was the son of God. We'll meet him one day. It'll be wonderful. &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, he he was being made in Adam's fallen image, not in not in the image that Adam was in before the fall. Are you following me right now? Right? So he begins to reproduce himself. And it's not as sons of God, you know, that without sin, perfect, made in the image of the word. It's fallen Adam reproducing himself. And this is the thing we must be very careful of is we do not want to reproduce ourselves people &gt;&gt; only. We desire that our children would know the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? Because when God comes into their lives and transforms them, it's no longer our natural lineage living through. Sure, on the outside it is. their characteristics, their looks and everything are you see mom and dad in them. Praise the Lord or or not. Okay, that's fine, you know. But but but the inner man, the eternal man, right? He is now made in the image of God. Praise the Lord. I'm just going to going to walk through this. We're just going to go for a stroll. Okay. Amen. So, so the thing is we don't want to make people in the image of ourselves. So, for example, I would hate it that when we get to the end of the road and and we're well, you know, we come to the end of all things and we realize actually all I've done is reproduced spiritually myself and people. &gt;&gt; That would be the worst thing &gt;&gt; any any minister would come to that realization that actually the congregation has just taken on the pastor's spirit &gt;&gt; because our desire is of course my desire is that you receive the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? that is that that God God reproduces himself that way. Amen. It's not little Benjamins running around. We've got one of them. One's enough. Okay. But then he can't stay like that. He's got to have his own experience with the Lord. There's not fallen glowin genes that are expressing themselves. Actually, God comes into him and begins to express himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because we realize now that we have been we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified. I like that. Amen. But you see we've been for ordained. We've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son. So we've been we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of the word as God wanted us to be in the beginning. You realize if there was never a fall, God just would have Adam would have just spoken us forth &gt;&gt; and we would have been in a perfect image how God wants us to be in the end fully mature made in his image. That's how it was going to be, right? But God allowed it to come a secondary way. So, we're born in sin, shaped iniquity, come to the world speaking lies, but yet there's on the inside of the inside of us is that God gene that wants to live, &gt;&gt; that's crying out for expression. That's why if there's a hunger in your heart for God, God put that in there before the foundation of the world. Amen. That because God wanted not just your natural self to grow and mature, he wants himself to grow and mature and express himself through you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've been ordained to be conformed to the image of his son, made in the image of God. Amen. You know, when we receive the Holy Ghost, it makes people, it does the same thing through anyone. Doesn't matter about culture, language, background. When people meet the Lord, it transforms them, &gt;&gt; right? Doesn't make us all the same personality, but it changes our lives that we love the same word that he comes and lives through out of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So he says now he says I'm a mystery. I go over the land where people there that don't even know which is right and left hand. They stand there. You know what they do when they receive the Holy Ghost? The same thing you do the same thing. Amen. Why? Cuz the life is now changed. The life that they were meant to have in the beginning has actually come in and is now living itself out. What a glorious thing. I mean, aren't you glad that the same God that came down the day of Pentecost lives in you? makes you live the same kind of life, the same faith. Amen. That they had, you have by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, because that's why a new birth is a a new life coming in. There's a dormant something was dormant on the inside of you, that gene seed of God. But then God in God's season when the Holy Ghost comes and quickens the word to your to your soul. Amen. You're born again. There's a creation that takes place if I put it that way. There's a new life comes in. I mean, the life you were meant to have in the beginning, right, is now within you. And now the Lord himself begins to live his life out. Amen. Praise the Lord. See, the thing is, you know, people talk about there was a blood moon. I got up to see it, but I saw clouds. I don't know if anyone saw it a couple of mornings ago. And you know, the signs in the heavens and you know, Israel's now bombed uh Hamas and uh Doha and all these things are going on. But, you know, those signs aren't really the signs. There's a true sign overlooked and it's walking around on two feet. Amen. The true sign in this day is not even brother Brandham anymore. It's now the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's now the word made flesh in you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the sign that the world is actually looking at. They don't understand what they're looking at. Even ourselves, we look in the mirror and we wrestle with what we are or who we are, right? This natural guy. This this but but on the inside there's something very different. Amen. There's God. Okay. Okay. And then so so because what God is going to prove the full power of Calvary through a people and he's going to take us home. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is so you are the last sign to this world before God turns to the Jews. Lord &gt;&gt; Amen. But now see even so as we read about with um Elisha, Elijah when he was there on Mount Carmel or no sorry not mount Carmel he went down um he went down to Mount Horeb I think it was you know after he had had the great showdown with the priest of Baal and so on and then God speaking to him there in the cave and asking him in this previous uh verses saying what are you doing here Elijah what's going on. Then then then Elijah begins to tell him about, you know, he's he's the only one left alive and all these things and troubles that's going on. But then God o God in his grace opens opens the lamb's book of life to to Elijah and he goes down to the margin, goes to the page where Elisha's name is written and says, "Look, Elijah, this ministry is going to continue on. It's not you that's going to continue it on forever. But there's going to be a transition period that takes place because you are assigned to Israel because your name I think means my God is Jehovah. And God proved his word through Elijah on Mount Carmel and many other things he did. But you see now here he comes and he's, you know, he's down. He's in this cave. He's downcast and he's wondering what's going on and what the future holds for him. But then Elijah is told, you're going to go anoint Elisha to be prophet in thy room. and that and that in my room means the one he's going to be the prophet after you that this ministry is going to continue on through Elisha. Now, we understand that brother Brown would teach this that that that Elijah of course is is Christ and then Elisha is the is the bride or the church of Jesus Christ following after him. Now, we understand that in order for someone to come to adoption, our we and our humanity can't do it, right? for for for like a man to come to manhood uh spiritually it takes the Lord to do it or a sister your woman to come to adoption as well because brother when he preaches uh leadership he says you know the first thing you do is you hold your your mother's hand you take your first little steps and she leads you and then and then she passes you on to the school teacher and then the school teacher leads you and then and then after the school teacher becomes your dad and then you know the pastor and so on but they come so what he's saying is that as a as a person is growing or maturing this human leadership is so involved and we know through our lives there's human leadership but the main one in certain forms of development uh the mother the father uh school teachers and so on right but then he says after the minister gets a hold of you then he says now who's going to lead you then because the thing is a church as a woman cannot bring a man to manhood right you know we cannot bring any of you to adoption it takes the word and the word alone known to mold and shape you. Amen. Into into the image of God. Now Elisha could never come to his position that God foreformed him to have by plowing oxen with m you for mom and dad. He was good at what he did. He was plowing straight rows. It would have been very difficult all those oxen keeping them straight. And I'd hate to try and do that, you know, but but he was skilled. He knew what he was doing. But you see him in that position could never bring him to adoption to a full manifestation of being a son of God. It took a prophet to come along, I mean, and throw his mantle over the shoulders of Elisha. And I thought, isn't that interesting that as soon as, you know, you know, um, Elisha asked him, um, you know, let me, um, wait, let's just find the scriptures, go back up to it. He says, you know, uh, you know, he left the ox and ran after Elijah, said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and thy mothers." Verse 20, "And I will follow thee." And Elijah said unto him, "Go back again, for what have I done to thee?" See, Elijah has been constantly telling Elisha, "Go back." And we'll come into that when, you know, before Elijah's taken up in the chariot, he's always saying, "Stay here. Go back." But he knew what was in Elisha's heart. And Elisha, you know, the bride of Jesus Christ, we want all of God, right? We're not listening to anything saying, "Stay here. Don't come any further." There's something in us says, "Lord, even if you tell me to stop, I'm going to keep walking with you." Amen. You can't stop me. Praise the Lord. Amen. So that So, so here is Elisha. I'm just going I just want to go back to this picture here. So, so here is Elisha and Elijah throws the mantle over him and he doesn't know that he's been predestinated to take Elijah's place after Elijah is gone. And so now we have come now if we come down to this day, we've had an Elijah in this day. Amen. Brother Ron's ministry, he was the prophet Elijah to come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord to turn our hearts back to the original faith of the fathers. Right? and he's done that. He's gone off the scene. Okay. The mantle that he carried of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, of Christ living in his life, that mantle has been placed upon a per people. You say, "Well, I wasn't there in his ministry." Well, it's not physically being in his meetings that mattered. It's when you hear the voice behind the voice. When you hear that word that's spoken, it's more than hearing Brother Bram's voice. You hear God anointing that word. You hear the voice behind the voice. What's that? God's throwing his mantle over you. of his word because he's calling you for a job that you're already predestinated to do. Amen. And then so now God God begins to call us that way. And then what h but what happens now is there has to we have to go through a molding process to fit the robe to fit the anointing. Amen. Now we know it took Elisha 10 years to get there but it doesn't have to take you 10 years. It can be 30 seconds. You give a full surrender to the Lord and the Lord can mold you and shape you. Amen. to fit that robe &gt;&gt; for the ministry. Amen. Because we know that the book of Revelation says that we're instructed as being John as a symbol of you and I to take the book and eat the book. Then now must prophesy again before many kindreds, tongues, and nations. Right? So that's the ministry of the bride in this end time is Revelations 10:8-11. That's your job. That's what you're called to do. Amen. Live out that to speak under inspiration what's already been given. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that so so there he is. He go he throws his mantle over Elijah. Then Elisha begins to follow him as as the church follows Christ. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now notice in Elijah there, he threw his robe on him and and and and tried it on him." In other words, Elijah the prophet who had the mantle of God on his shoulders. He came down laid it across Elisha the farmer to see if it would fit him. And it had taken about 10 years to get altered to fit that mantle. You know, God usually puts us in the shop and trims us up. Now, he didn't alter his robe to fit Elisha. He ordered Elisha to fit the robe. And that's what he does today. He alters us to fit the robe, not the robe to fit us. Sometimes we want to make the robe fit us. But we can't do that. We've got to let uh we've got to let be altered yourself for the robe. It's God's robe. And he made it perfect. He has to bring us into that realm to make the robe fit us. Yes. Like brother Bram says, these great deserts, deserts of experience where men are molded into saints. He says, "I'm so how thankful we are for these these things, Lord, these great deserts of experience where we're molded and shaped to fit the anointing, to fit the word." Remember, we don't want to change the word to match our experience. We want to be changed that our experience matches the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then now there came a time when when um Elijah Elijah knew that he was going to be taken up in the whirlwind. And then this is when he would say to he would say to Elisha repeatedly, "Stay here." And so they they started off in Gilgal. Now the journey that they took is the same journey that the bride of Jesus Christ takes. They started in Gilgal. Now Gilgal is significant because when Joshua brought the children of Israel over Jordan, this is where they circumcised the people again where the reproach of slavery was taken off them was in Gilgal. Amen. And Gilgal represents justification. When you give your life to the Lord, you're justified by faith. That the reproach of being a slave to the world is struck off. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the shame, the guilt, the hurt, the pain, the regret that is struck off in Gilgal. It's a mighty place to be. &gt;&gt; You remember being there? It's a great place to be. Amen. When you realize Jesus died for me. Amen. It's more than a story. It's reality. Amen. He changed my life. Amen. He really died. He really took my sins far away. That's what's that. That's being a Gilgal. &gt;&gt; But you see, we don't want to stay in Gilgal because there's a robe that we must wear. Now, I'm not now I'm looking at people who are wearing the robe. Okay? I just want you to realize this is your journey that God is every day has been significant in God's economy in your life. I mean, every day God's been molding, shaping, speaking to you through everyday life. Amen. It's through everyday routines that God deals with us, molds us, shapes us, changes us. Praise God for everyday life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then, so we come to Gilgal. That's that place of, you know, justification. And then Elijah said unto Elisha, "Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to Bethl." And Elisha said unto him, "As the Lord liveth, and as my soul liveth, I will not leave thee." So they went down to Bethl. So Elisha is determined. I'm going to stay with Elijah. And the bride of Jesus Christ, I'm sure this is our heart as Lord. I want to stay where you are. &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave you, Lord. I want to, you know, I don't want to wander off of my own ideas. I want to stay with your word completely. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he comes down to Bethlehem. Then he comes to the, you know, there and, you know, there's the sons of the prophets there. And it's amazing how, you know, through this through this whole story that there's that there's people that will, you know, there's sons of prophets. says those who are made in the image of a prophet and they're telling him what's about to happen. It's all very well for people to know events, but I'd rather be in Elisha's shoes than just know what what's going to happen, &gt;&gt; right? Because Elisha is part of the ministry of Elijah, right? The sons of the prophets are just trying to tell them this is going to happen. This is going to happen. You know, been caught up. You know, it's all very well to to know what's going on in the world, &gt;&gt; but we need to know him. We need to know Christ. And we need to be walking in his word. That's the main thing. Okay. And then so Elisha is told by them, you know, your master is going to be taken from thee. And he says, you know, uh, you know, I know these things, you know, yeah, I know it. Hold your peace. And then, and then Elijah tries to leave him there at Bethl, you know, which speaks of like, uh, sanctification, cleansing of worldly habits. God cleanses our spirit. And it's a wonderful place to be is Bethl. Bethl is where Jacob had the dream of the ladder, the angels going up and down. Incredible place. Visions of heaven, angels ascending and descending. I mean, the Lord on the top of the ladder, all these incredible things going on, you know, but but you can't just stay there in sanctification. We got to keep going on. Then finally, he comes to Jericho and he comes to Jordan. And Elijah wants him to stay in these places. And even there when he comes to Jericho, Elisha is told, you know, that don't you know the Lord will take away your master from thy head today? He answered, "Yay, I know it, but hold your peace." And Elijah said to him, "Tarry, I pray thee here, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan." He said, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I'll not leave thee." And the two went on. See, this is this is a place that many people we must cross Jordan. We must have a death to self. We must not just stay at Gilgal or Bethl or Jericho. the sons of the prophets, we must cross Jordan because there's a mantle for us to use. Not just to wear, but to use. Amen. That God and now I'm not saying we're not in this position, but you know, we can't just stay in just a justified state or a sanctified state. Those are incredible ways to be, but we need to cross Jordan because God wants to take us into the his image. And the only way he takes us into his image is when the word himself comes and lives on the inside of the inside of us. Amen. Because even Elijah was not interested in Elisha becoming a little Elijah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't interested in that. He wanted Elisha to know the same God he knew. Amen. Cuz why? He was a he was he was called. He called Elisha to be prophet in his room after he left. So the same inspiration, the same Holy Ghost leadership, the same word living would be in Elisha was like it was in Elijah. I mean God did not want Elisha to walk around with Elijah's testimonies only. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, he God doesn't want us just to walk around with brother Bram's testimonies only. He wants us to have our own testimony. I mean, he wants us to have the own living God experiences ourselves where the word comes alive to us. Amen. It's no good walking around with what brother did. You know, those things are all very good. We should talk about those things. But if God is only alive to you back there, it doesn't do you any good. I say you're just a son of the prophet watching what's unfolded, what's going on. But we're called to be Elisha. I mean, we're the same. where the God of the prophet comes and lives in you and I. Amen. And does the supernatural. Amen. Proves his word. And then so Elijah took his mantle, wrapped it together, and he smoked the waters that divided hither and thither. So the two went over on dry ground. So now the word has led Elisha to this place where he's going to cross. He's going to have a true death to self. He's going to die out and cross the river Jordan. Amen. And then so here he is. He's, you know, I just, you know, I just like the angle of this picture. And you see, you know, Elisha in the back. He's watching Elijah do something that only Joshua did with the ark or Moses did at the Red Sea with his staff. He's never He's never experienced this before. He's come to a new walk in his life. Amen. And then here is here is Elijah takes his mantle smites the Jordan and then they cross the Jordan. Then what happens is yo Elijah asks Elijah, "What can I do for you now? You've been with me all this time. You've never left my side. Now what do you want?" Amen. And what do we want as the bride of Jesus Christ? Lord, we want you to live like never before. Lord, we want you to live in our lives, Lord Jesus. We want to see your word manifested. We don't want to be made in the image of Shakina Tabernacle. We don't want to be made in the image of even of Brother Brandon. We want to be made in the image of Jesus Christ, the word. Amen. That's what we want. Amen. Like brother Ram says that, you know, many people, they get people to a theory. They get people to a church. But you see, that's not what we're meant to do. We meant to get people to Christ, the living word, where the word becomes real and alive in their lives. Amen. So, we don't want to get people to a theory of the message. &gt;&gt; If we do that, we've miserably failed. Amen. But if we get the people to the God of the message, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible, we have achieved what God has placed us here to achieve. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, now here is Elisha. He's watching Elijah. They cross Jordan. And then you know um Elisha says to Elijah after he's asked what can I do for you and Elisha says I want a double portion. I want a double portion of your spirit. There's a inspiration struck Elisha. This is what I want. Amen. I don't just want the same as what you have. I want more. Amen. Because he that believeth on me Jesus says amen. These works you do and greater than these shall you do cuz I go to my father. Amen. So there's going to be more. Amen. And you we know it's giving you imparting eternal life whether through the preaching of the word creating an atmosphere not just preaching but living a life creating atmosphere of the Holy Ghost you can impart eternal life to others that's a greater work. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's greater in that extent and it's more why because there's more people God is in &gt;&gt; to prove his word through. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like many times people think, man, if we could only go back to, you know, one of the meetings there, maybe in Durban or maybe, you know, one of the great healing campaign meetings, you're going to realize if you took the bride of Jesus Christ and brought every testimony together, it's greater than that cuz it's more. It's just diffused through the world. Amen. That same spirit is now around the world healing, raising the dead, casting out devils. Amen. Preaching the word, filling with the Holy Ghost, doing signs and wonders. It's all around the world. Praise the Lord. And that's what God intended it to be. Amen. So then Elijah says, "Well, you ask a hard thing, but if you see me when I go, I'm trying to find it here. If you see me when I go, then you shall have it." So, so, so what did Elisha do? He kept his both eyes upon Elijah because he knew that that that what he asked, he's going to receive. Amen. It's the same thing with you and I. We can't have one eye on the world and one eye on on the Lord. would have both eyes on brother says both eyes on Calvary, both eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ. Don't worry about what's going on in the world. I tell you what, the thing that can help your world is you get a double portion of the anointing. Amen. You keep your eyes on the Lord, that will fix everything around you. Amen. Because if we keep one eye on the on the world, we're saying, "Well, how can I fix this humanly?" We'll never fix it. I got problems with my home, problems in the family, children, job, whatever more. You keep both eyes on the Lord, knowing those things are there, not ignoring them, but you keep both eyes on the word. Amen. Then God will give you the wisdom and understanding and he will step into your battle and he'll conquer it like you never could in your humanity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So now here he says you know if you do these so he kept both eyes on Elijah and then as he was keeping both eyes on Elijah that chariot of fire came down separated them took Elijah up into glory and what fell down was the mantle that God you that Elijah used to to to um smite the Jordan. So Elisha sees it. He picks it up. You know before he picks it up he cries, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." basically is saying that Elijah had more value than the whole armies of Israel. I say the bride of Jesus Christ, this this revealed word has has more value than all the bombs in the world. &gt;&gt; You know, you being alive, present is holding back the wrath of God. It's holding back bombs flying, destruction. The bride of Jesus Christ around the world is holding that back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon says, "Before one bomb drops," talking about atomic bombs on America, the bride will be gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, let's witness while we're here. &gt;&gt; Let's be a living witness while we're here. God saves. God redeems. His word is true. Amen. So, he picks up now. He picks up that, you know, picks up that mantle. He goes back to the Jordan to where they crossed. And what does he do? He asks the question. He says, "Where is the God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happened is he smoked the, you know, smoked the um smoked the uh waters with the mantle and it parted exactly as it did when Elijah did it. So now it's not it's not Elisha. It's not Elisha looking at Elijah doing it. The same God that was in Elijah parting the waters is now the same God in Elisha doing the same things. Amen. So now Elisha is there and he's realized, hey, the God of Elijah is in me. Amen. He's not a historical God. God did not go up in the chariot with with with Elijah only and now there's no God upon the earth. Jehovah's left the building. No, Jehovah God is present. Amen. And Jesus Christ is present. I was bringing to our day language because Jehovah of the old is Jesus Christ of the new. Amen. So he smoked the Jordan and you know and what that do God proved to him as I was with the prophet, I'm with the bride. Amen. As I was with brother Araham, I'm with the bride of Jesus Christ around the world. Amen. The same anointing, the same power, but we know Elijah I mean Elisha did twice the number of miracles, right? Elijah did four and Elisha did eight. And you know the last I'm just going to kind of wind this up here, but you know you know the last miracle that Elisha did was actually Elisha because he did you know he did seven miracles and then he got sick and that sickness took him to death. And now that's when the critics started their websites up and said, "Hey, this guy said he had a double portion, but he's only done seven miracles. He must have been a false prophet." But there was war going on in Israel and Elisha was dead. He was buried in a seplica. And some men were carrying some men were carrying a dead friend of theirs from the battle. And they thought, "Man, what are we going to do with this guy?" And they just threw the threw him into this hole into this pit. They didn't realize it was Elisha's seplica. And when that dead man made contact with Elisha's bones, he came back to life. Amen. to the last miracle Elisha did was the resurrection of the dead. Amen. I tell you what, friends, the last miracle the bride of Jesus Christ is going to do by the life of God within them is going to bring the dead in Christ out of the grave. Amen. There's going to be a resurrection of those who have died in Christ down through seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's why it's so important. Walk in this double portion of the anointing. Amen. Remember Elisha wasn't even conscience conscious. He was dead. He was somewhere else. But that quickening power was so real within him. Amen. That it laid within his bones. Amen. So it wasn't him consciously saying, "I've got to raise this person from the dead. I've got to bring the Christ, you know, the dead in Christ from the grave." No, it was it's not us consciously needing to do anything. It's just the quickening power of the Holy Ghost living in us. Amen. Will bring them from the grave. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I say, so why do you say it like that? Just relax. Just relax and let the mantle live. &gt;&gt; The mantle is the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the living word. Just let it live. Amen. Don't be so fixated on I've got to do this and that, whatever more. Just live a genuine loving Christian life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be a light wherever you go. Amen. Love everybody. Speak peaceibly with everyone. Live peaceibly with everyone. Amen. Just pray, "Lord, I want to be salty today." &gt;&gt; Amen. and an atmosphere of God will begin to live out of your life. Amen. And you'll begin to see God begin to do the supernatural without you even being conscious of it. Amen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. What did brother say when he came down to the end of the seals? He says, "Just live a simple Christian life." And that simple Christian life as some people have taken it means well some people have taken it and said, "Well, we don't need to know what the revelation of the word is." That's not what he's saying. He's saying just live a simple loving the Lord life. Walk with God. He'll unfold himself to you. Amen. Just keep walking in the light as he is in the light and he'll unfold his word to you as you walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not exciting. That's very exciting. That's incredibly exciting that I can just love the Lord and walk with him and he can reveal himself. As God wanted to have fellowship with me before the fall, he can have it with me now. &gt;&gt; Why? because as I walk with him, just like Elisha walked with Elijah and Elisha was being molded into the image of a son of God. Same thing with us. We're walking with the word now. See, as I said uh you know a while ago, this church can't take you into adoption. It can't it can't take you into manhood into or into womanhood, right? It's like Ruth and Moab. She could never come to her position there. But under the leadership of Naomi, which represents the Orthodox, you know, old church, right? under her leadership, she could come to Boaz's feet and come to her position in the body. Right? So now, it wasn't Moab and her parents telling her what to do to raise her, to bring her to that position. It was the word instructing her life. Amen. And it's the same thing with us men as well. It's only the word, only the Lord himself can place you, take you to adoption, take you to your position. Amen. plowing plowing um plowing fields and doing what you're you know I'm not here to build more loins even my own children I want to see them made in the image of daughters and son of god &gt;&gt; that's what I want to see &gt;&gt; amen I don't want them to continue on in like the not that we have a family trade but you know I don't want to mold them into well this is what I was like son you've got to be like me you've got to be do science you got to do this you got to love this you got to no I don't want to mold my children that way. I want them to know the Lord and God take them on from where I can't take them humanly can take them into the full image of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is and and this is friends, this is what it's all about. You and Christ together. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said I was going to stop, but actually I've changed my mind. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because what is it that what is it that let's let's make it more tangible. What is it that molds us and shapes us? Okay, it's our spiritual diet is vital in this. &gt;&gt; Okay, we cannot expect to eat McDonald's Christianity and come out strong, tough, and made in the image of the word. Okay, who's seen it's it's probably so old now the documentary Superersized Me, &gt;&gt; right? The guy had other health issues, but he just ate McDonald's for a month. It didn't do him any favors. Okay, he became a living walking Big Mac. Not a good idea. Spiritually, very bad idea. Okay, but you but if we could see the value of what the Lord has deposited in this day for us to eat, I think it would change everything about us. Okay, because even I found it very interesting. Sorry girls and Esther and William, but you're going to go through family prayer again. But you know, it's amazing how the reason the children of Israel called mana manner is because they didn't know what it was. I got it in yellow down there. Okay, I'm just going to skip through this really quickly. But God said, "I'm going to bring bread out of heaven." And they called it mana because what is this stuff? Well, it was bread. God said it was bread. Okay, and then the psalmist would pick it up and say, "Man did eat angels food." So, it's more than just bread. More than just, you know, something that came. Well, what is this that came out of heaven? Angels food is what they lived on during their time in the wilderness. And then Jesus would come and say, "I am the true bread." &gt;&gt; Amen. That came out. I am the bread of life. I am the true bread. Bread that came out of heaven. So we can't call. But really, when when when the you know when the Israel um Israelites and stuff are looking at the Lord Jesus, they call could have called him mana. We don't know where this guy is from. What is this? What is this man saying to us? Right? But he's saying now I am the true bread that came out of heaven. Amen. He that you eateth me liveth on me shall never live. I mean I mean I mean shall never die. He says for for the bread of God which uh is which he is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. And then they said unto him, Lord, ever more give us this bread. Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth me shall never thirst. So now this word that this, you know, this this bread we live off, this spiritual word is a person. It's Christ Jesus the Lord. And even brother Brandham would come down to anointed ones in the end time. One of his, you know, halfway through the last year he'd be um alive. He says, "I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river." Speaking about when he was baptizing in 1933, I was only performing uh sorry, standing there where when he appeared. I'm not the one that performs these things and fortell these things that happens as perfect as they are. I'm only one that's near when he does it. I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. That's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh, no. It was the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel, his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He's the one you're feeding on. Okay? So, I'm just listening to a message. What are you feeding on? You're feeding off the revelation of Jesus Christ himself. Amen. You're not feeding on a man. A man his words will fail. Amen. You're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. So we're not feeding on the opinions of William Brandham. We're feeding on the true revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So aren't you glad this is what we're feeding on. See, as you as you eat the word, you become the word. &gt;&gt; That's why your spiritual diet, I trust it's good. I trust spiritually you're you're fat and flourishing, &gt;&gt; right? I trust you are spiritually. Okay? Because you realize no, as I feed off the word, I become the word. Like brother says in the rapture message, I don't have the quote on me, but he says, "But the shout brings forth a living bread which makes a living bride." Amen. The word itself. But you see, sometimes we're like, and and I can say I'm like this. We're like a hog under an apple tree. Amen. He'll he'll eat apples all day. They'll beat him on the head and he'll never look up. see which way they're coming. Well, that's just the way we are. We just absolutely God will pour his blessings upon us. And then we never look up to say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm so glad to be here. Thank you that you give me something to eat." We just go ahead like he owed it to us. We owe him. He owes us nothing. We owe all we are to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, he owes me this." No, no. He doesn't owe you nothing. We owe everything we are to him. Now, I'm not saying you're a bunch of hogs under an apple tree. You know where this comes from, okay? But I think we should appreciate more the fact that the Lord has sent a word to transform us into the image of his son. Amen. How God wanted us to be in the beginning before the fall. Talking about the inner man. Okay? That we're not made in the image of a fallen Adam. We're made in the image of Jesus Christ, the word. That's a beautiful thing. Amen. Let's have the musicians tonight. Amen. So why does man make robots like men? They want to make something in their image. They can't help it. It's built in them cuz God wants someone in his image. I'll say they're trying to do it. God's already achieved it. Amen. He's made you, well, I've got all of my faults and failings, whatever more. Don't look at the outward man. What about the inner man? He's changing you from glory to glory. The person you once were, you're not that person anymore. You've taken a step higher. Amen. Step closer to the Lord. Why? Because God is transforming us into his image. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand tonight, shall we? Amen. Let's let's bow our heads and then we'll we'll sing a song, shall we? We can sing that. Goodness of God. Bless you. Let's bow our heads today. Tonight. Amen. Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads tonight, we just ask, Father, that may you continue to mold us, to shape us, Lord Jesus, into your image. Father, please forbid it, dear God, that anyone here would catch my spirit, my human spirit. Lord, I don't want that. Not for a second, Lord. Not here to reproduce spiritually myself in any way. That's just weird. Lord, I just I I desire that you would come in, dear God, and you would produce yourself in us, Father. Lord, as true sons and daughters of the most high God, grant it, Father, we commit our lives into your hands. I ask, dear, God, that may we, Lord, may we not stop in our Christian walk. Lord, like Elisha, he he wasn't willing to stop anywhere, no matter where Elijah told him to tarry. He was staying right with Elisha. I mean, right right with Elijah. And dear God, we want to stay right by you, dear God. We don't want to wander off somewhere. We don't want to stop. May we continue to walk with you, Lord Jesus. May we walk with you in the light as you're in the light, Lord. And may you continue to reveal yourself to us. We love you so much, Lord. We want more of you. Grant it, dear God. Continue to reveal yourself to us, Lord, in our personal walks with you, Lord. Lord, I just pray when we open your word, when we hear the message, Lord Jesus, when we come to church, I pray you' just anchor more of yourself within us, Lord. Mature us, mold us, shape us, Lord, into your image. We love you so much and we thank you, Lord. We praise you with, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's sing Goodness of God, shall we? And then I'll turn the service to you, Brother Josh. That's okay. Amen. I love you, Lord. For your mercies never fail me. All my days I've been held in your hands. [Music] From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head, I will sing in the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful.
