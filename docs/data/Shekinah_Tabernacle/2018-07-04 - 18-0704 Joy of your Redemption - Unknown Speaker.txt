any need here further may mean it feel glory Father in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen amen god bless you all thank you musicians Amen it's good to be in the presence of the king amen if you have your Bibles that's and read a couple of places and we're gonna begin an Luke chapter 15 and we're gonna read from verse 12 verse 11 this is probably a familiar piece of scripture to to everyone this is in the younger of them I mean sorry verse 11 this is the story of the of the prodigal son and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that's fallen to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together he took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and sent him and so and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hide servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and him no word no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of our hired servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and I'm no more worthy to be called my son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for the son for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be married I mean I like that now let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 and we're gonna we're gonna read from verse 11 we're gonna read just the verse 11 down to verse 13 it says this here wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision and the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ amen may the Lord bless us word this evening you may have your seats I want to speak about the joy of redemption I mean you know Christianity is a heartfelt religion and you know we have something to rejoice in you know brother brand preaches a sermon Redemption and completeness and in joy and there's something about when when someone goes from being lost and maybe just raised in a Christian home and or in a church or maybe out in the world that doesn't really matter where you start it's where he finishes the main thing and God begins to call that person and they didn't respond to that call and they go from being lost to being found where there's a joy where once you were drifting on the sea of life and then he comes and he gets ahold of you and he lifts you up a many places you in heavenly places on himself I mean there is a definite time where you must know some thing happened to you I mean where it said where where it's more than just maybe something you do but it becomes a joy to serve God it becomes a joy to be called a Christian that's it yeah it's a joy I mean to be redeemed hallelujah so you know God is here searching out for hearts amen and we must be very sensitive to when he he he moves because we know that we do not gather here just to have a religious service then go home and say well I've fulfilled my religious duty but we're here to meet God I mean we're here to meet him that he would mold us and change us and shape us and you know the world wants to make us feel indifferent and cold and formal but God doesn't want us indifferent cold and formal our God wants us full of love and rejoicing and praising him hallelujah giving him praise for everything he's done for us now I like here in Ephesians where it said that that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel so there was a time now that was Ephesians 2 in verse 12 so there was a time when at that time you without him you're in the world but you were without him hallelujah but there comes a time when there's there at that at that time he didn't meet you and he becomes a living reality right now God is a god we should we must experience I mean we must really meet him I mean we must know what it's like to take up our cross and follow him I mean there has to come a time in life where you lay down everything of your identity and your family and whatever situation your status or whatever the world my view u.s. you've got a you've got to put that down take up your cross and follow him amen you have you ever seen a sheep that's been lost in a you know on a hillside or stuck in a thicket someplace wandering around aimlessly there was like us one time I mean where we were stumbling around this world but the shipment was looking and he's still looking tonight I mean this is more than just nice where your story it's a reality I mean where we were wondering and Magnus I mean there's there's right now in Thailand there's a is a soccer team and assistant coach there in a cave they've been there for ten days now they've been found hallelujah they can't get out because there's water it's flooded and all different things but they were lost and darkness they were there for nine days they don't even know you know you know pitch black during this Cape who's written about it and the news there in this cave complex they can't get out they've been in there nine days pitch darkness but they knew the rescuers knew that they were there somewhere and they had to find them so they they got the best divers in the world cuz they dive through narrow passageways because they're all flooded to try and get to these people and they sent rescue teams in and there's a video where the diver comes out of the water shines his light on them Khalu you and they say we're hungry we're thirsty we don't know what day it is because time is yo you know they they don't see the Sun go up and down and whatever more they're in a dark cave and it's just like once upon a time that was you you were living in a cave doesn't matter how big your cave was you're in a cave and you didn't know where you were but a rescue and you you were there I'm in a rescue and you you were there and he didn't want you to stay in that cave I mean he wanted you to come out to the sunlight hallelujah and God doesn't worry about the obstacles in the way I mean he just plows through those strengths he passes through the darkness and he gets a hold of us hallelujah that must happen to you that must happen to you you must know what it's like as a sailor a sheep lost in a you're on a mountainside the Shepherd comes along picks up that lamb picks up that sheep hallelujah and doesn't just pick it up and drop it picks it up carries it back home to safety amen where Jesus is I'm the door to the sheepfold and he says that you're what man who is a hundred sheep and 99 is safe and one is lost and he goes out and looks for the one hallelujah you've got to know what it's like stumbling around and you see someone else come there was this one he picks you up something in you has to yield to him he can't buck and kick and fight I mean by the strong hands gonna pick you up you know who's who's catching you hallelujah he picks you up and what a joy it is to be put on his shoulder don't worry child no more to be okay I mean I'm not gonna leave you on this barren hillside of a wasteland of a world I'm gonna carry you into my sheaf oh and what it's like to be carried through the door placing among the redeemed hallelujah do you know what that's like you have to know what that's like we say well I was raised in church my parents taught me things it's got to become a reality you must know what it's like to be saved you must know what it's like to be redeemed hallelujah redemption is a reality salvation is a reality it's not just nice thoughts or an idea or until something we prescribe to it's a reality to know what it's like to be saved but first you got to know what it is to be lost amen don't let the devil lie to you and say you'll find in your cave hallelujah when the rescue is shining is like I found one I've been looking for this one hallelujah amen salvation is real it's real I mean it's not it's not just a story or history it's a reality I mean Jesus died for you and I He shed his life's blood upon the earth I mean - Bridget chasm between you and God hallelujah that when you could not go to where he was he came to you amen he came to me that at that time he came to me hallelujah and from that time I've been a different person I mean you got to become a different person hallelujah God's transforming power is real the room is full of it hallelujah amen here's this protocol son this protocol son has his own ideas we all had our own ideas amen he said give me what what what is mine go spins it but then the main thing as he comes to himself we have to come to ourselves right we have to come to a play where realize this is not how life should be it doesn't matter if you have you may be from the richest family in all the world you had to come to yourself and say this is not how life should be I have a better inheritance than this I'm it and he comes to himself hallelujah and before that a famine struck and I believe because the father was praying I mean when you see people go through trials they hit the ditch and they you know they crash to whatever more you say praise God God's answering prayer hallelujah oh yeah you're the cat might be on fire or whatever board what's going on God's answering prayer hallelujah because God's trying to get someone's attention I meant and you got to be you know don't be too sick headed when he knocks you should say yes Lord I'm here cuz you'll knock a bit harder you'll knock a bit harder hallelujah I'm glad he knocks don't you I'm glad he knocks I mean so it comes to himself this is not my lot in life to be here in this Pigpen in a strange land I'm in and you have to have that kind of experience you know we are born and said people say I've never done anything wrong you were born lost you're born lost right your birth made you lost well that's not fair there's a way of escape I mean there's a blood that cleanses makes you a new creation hallelujah I mean that can change anyone it's irrelevant where we're from or what we've done I'm glad it's that way don't you I mean so it comes to himself and my father's house them you know that even the servants eat and you know they're not have want so it goes home and he feels I'm not worthy to be a son anymore and the biggest thing is you know we find it harder God finds it far easy to forgive us and we can forgive ourselves right he was he was still holding his past against him and his father was having prayer meetings at home one day he broke through a famine happened hallelujah something in them said we noticed Johnny's coming home hallelujah begin to watch watch him to come the same path he left he's going to walk back on their path hallelujah and then one day he sees them come over the horizon oh yeah I mean if I prayer changes things bread changes things when you touch heaven I mean that peace comes down you know God you're going to answer I may not know how but you're going to answer we have confidence I mean that he's going to do it Allu yeah and then his father begins running and braces his son oh yeah and then his son because he can't forgive himself says I've sinned against you against heaven sure he had but you got to when you're forgiven you got to forgive yourself - amen oh sure I've done a lot of bad things in life if God's forgiving you you can forgive yourself don't hold it against yourself right hallelujah because he says to his father I'm not worried that he'd be killed your son let me just be a servant that was not the father's hide at all he didn't want another servant he wanted his son back he wanted his flesh-and-blood back he wanted his family back just like God he doesn't want servants he wants a bride he wants his wife around him his children lujah his life changed now we have to come to a point we don't care we do not care about anyone around us because the biggest the biggest hindrance I know the biggest hindrance I had in my own life was my friends it was my friends that helped me back and I didn't even tell them I had any kind of faith at all but just I was afraid to lose them right I was afraid to lose them now in the grand scheme of things what does it matter you know the devil puts all these scarecrows up what about this person what about this person what about your family what will they say what will they do when you get the Holy Ghost amen what will your friends think of you what will God think of you who's the one you know when it's all said and done who's going to say well done my good and faithful servant it's not going to be your friends or your family or your church it'll be him it'll be our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah the rich young ruler wasn't willing to lay down his riches because he was afraid of what people would say about him he wasn't willing to give up his riches people thought a lot of them here's a very religious man he says Lord I've kept all the commandments from my youth and and before then he asked Jesus watch I do to inherit eternal life Jesus you know the commandments are thy father and mother and etc and she says I've kept these from my youth the Lord you know the Lord knows all things he didn't say you're a liar he acknowledged you actually kept them he was a good message person but one thing thou lacus sell all that you have take your identity you know we craft this image that we try and put forward we have our own branding wherever our logo sometimes we rebrand as we get older I used to be this guy now Musk I you know have my own logo have my own image this is me you got to get you got to get rid of that thing because that was as long I didn't want to get rid of his logo he didn't want to rebrand he wanted to keep his lagos a rich young ruler success and godliness maybe that was his catchphrase I don't know cuz he was religious and he was wealthy he was successful right good barrels I kept the law from my youth he was proud proud of his religion but he had to rebrand it wasn't enough that did not give me ternal life and he knew this there's like the first question asked Jesus that's the only one he asked him what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life he knew that as religion did not give me to new life I think it's a good question that's a very good question to ask the Lord Jesus what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus just comes down to the crux take your logo take your branding take your image sell it give to the poor that you probably think you're better then give the ball take up your cross better approach of us be the reproach of us and follow me hallelujah now we know he turned it down if there's never a pleasant thing no one dies actually easy doesn't matter how much meat someone might have or whatever no one really dies easy if you look at the state the body goes through and death no death is really an easy death or a nice death but after death is glorious after death is glorious that's why you know if you know if we could only really put in words how great it is to die how great it is to be born again it's not a test it's not a nice phrase but God births he changes your nature I mean when we when she had a big weight of sin he takes that weight off hallelujah burdened down you couldn't even live with yourself and then he takes it from you and burdens now a lighter brighter is my way it is such a joy to walk with him where my journey here is over Oh woody on the other Shore eternity once we begin our glory glory hallelujah praise the Lord today I know I'm free he is with me and if I stay close to him say from having danger I will be that's more than a story or a song more than just a nice lyric it's a reality how old are you who knows what it's like to have a sin burden go I mean who knows what it's like to lay it all down completely on the altar no family surrender fully died off what doesn't matter what anyone says about me doesn't matter what they think of me doesn't matter what ridicule I may receive I want to take up my cross and follow you there are approaches worth it friends I mean the bad back your the rejection whatever more it's worth it currently to be born again to be birthed totally to become a new person a new creation by the blood of God hallelujah it is a reality I preached about what I've experienced hallelujah I know what it's like to be to be redeemed I know what it's like when I was standing around for his big arms to pick me up holy just stop straggling my child okay well they just give up all on I'm sorry thank you can I stop running now you've seen a sheep run around please surely you've been on a farm they run around they get all panicky and whatever he's like just stop running you'll just get tired just give up it's a lot easier to give up amen let go and let God have his way Alleluia don't let the devil lie you lie to you and say it's not really that worth it well you don't really have to Jesus's first doctrine as you must be born again that was this first teaching he says very very well absolutely absolutely I said to you you must be born again amen and once you are it's a glorious thing it's a reality we can have joy in the trial I mean we're the enemy just with this cattle nature nothing holding us up we crumple hallelujah pressure comes on we fall apart a member when he comes in it may be seven times harder a lot worse but something's carrying you through hallelujah I'm so glad that's the truth aren't you amen now the you have to come to that place don't let don't dance around stay at that place he did interest be dead earnest Lord I must meet you I must be changed amen you died for me I want the Holy Ghost amen I want you to come and dwell in me I will not settle for second-best I'll not sit back until you've touched me right we need to be dead earnest about our salvation and the devil says well you've got time why don't use that same amount of time for the Lord why not have that same amount of time for God to come and live in your life and manifest themselves I know every believer that I've ever met they said if only I knew him younger and absolutely I wish I'd young far younger every father glorious to with them with a young a you know from a young age hallelujah how whatever would be to be five years old God comes hallelujah hallelujah I mean well that'd be wonderful he walks with you God you I mean you can commit all your kids - how many speaks back to you and he and he looks after you hallelujah wouldn't that be a glorious thing amen there's nothing wrong to imagine those kind of things how wonderful would it be mentioned David there he is he's looking after his father's sheep just like many other days and then a servant comes except the prophet Samuel said our home he wants you okay looks long comes into the house he's been at their house many times it's very loves prophet Samuels their God tells that prophet this is my king kneels down daunting oils poured Spirit of God comes upon him from that day on and he goes back to the sheep but have been a lot different out there in that paddock yeah would mean a lot a lot different before God wasn't there now he was I mean before before he he was only there desert a world looking out of a sheep now the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want hallelujah and God comes down he begin to sink to his traitor to his maker to his Redeemer hallelujah and God comes down that panic oh yeah and then maybe a world this would be me as a man I wish this happened a long time ago I mean and that's how different it is with God in your life not just talking about him not just saying nice things that other people believers want to hear but you actually know him hallelujah amen and then the lion comes in he kills the lion and the bear comes in and he kills the beer and then Goliath comes in and he kills Goliath hallelujah here's victory a mini sista cloth I'm gonna cut your head off this day and he doesn't even have a sword but he's going to use his own weapon against them and what happens his head is severed and it's done hallelujah Amen now that's why being a work story oh wait better work stories isn't it but that's cuz gods they're trying to get you to think about it you know how was your day David I killed a beer mm how about how's your day I killed a lion with the sling in the knife yeah why did you do I grabbed him I hit him with a stone grabbed him and killed him you're this big I have a big God Jehovah is my as my weapon amen Jehovah is my god Jehovah is my protector hallelujah how was your day I went home I was called home like many other times prophet Samuel was there that same God is here that same God that is right here amen I and how was it well I all my brothers were there they weren't looking too happy and I got called and they sent just kneel down and I felt this oil come on me but then I felt more than just all come on me the Spirit of God came around me and that same presence is with me wherever I go hallelujah I mean how credible that would be then what about now you go to the day of Pentecost Terry in Jerusalem until you are endued with a power from on high they had to lay it all down they had to die to themselves had to get rid of all the pride whatever things trying to hold them back oh the Apostle Peter I'm you know upon this rock I'll build my church and y'all he had the revelation he's the Christ all that proud pride was kicked out right he had to go through that The humiliation during the crucifixion to get rid of those things they had to pray through you have to lay it all down when you really mean business God will meet you when you really when you're pretending he knows right you can't fool you may fool me you can't fool him right and then there on the day of Pentecost they've been there 10 days the tenth day was different only the tenth day was very different no doubt they had testimony meeting you know was like to see him resurrected to run to the tomb what was like Mary ran to the tomb tomb was open he wasn't there how'd you feel broken that's the worst day of my life up to that point I turn around I hear a voice I think and I think it's a gardener but then he sees my name sweetest name sweetest voice ever heard in my life the resurrected one Lord their whole life changed oh it's you Lord you've risen go tell my disciples of risen and then he appears to them Thomas was there I won't believe until I I see the holes in his hands in his feet I don't believe he's risen that's your stories you guys had just way too deep in this kind of stuff I don't know if he can raise Lazarus but him himself I don't know and then then Jesus appears oh that's why touch me put your hand in my side touch the hulls of my hands they says my Lord and my god hallelujah he knew he's the supreme one hey man he says blessed are thee that do not see yet belief hallelujah I'm in you're blessed to not see that yet still believe it and then now they're in there in the upper room you're gonna put yourself there because that had to happen to you I trust it has then it sound like from heaven like a rushing mighty wind fills the place well this didn't happen for the first nine days this is a bit different and the pillar of fire comes into the room separates itself out Kalea and that same presence that was with the Messiah is now in the room it's the same God and just one twist it all goes into them all this is a different kind of day holy they begin to rejoice and shout and give praise we've been redeemed God lives at us I mean washed by his blood hallelujah and they burst out of that place sound like a bunch of drug people there's a different kind of day oh yeah they come to down to Cornelius house hello Gentiles how are you and then Cornelius tells the people I had this vision I was praying he was a devout man he prayed many times before it's good to always pray you may just get visited by an angel Amen you believe that you believe angels still visit people and you still walk into houses and you'll still speak right we live in Bible days the book of Acts is continuing he's the same God today as that Enoch yes he is or not in 2019 we've got modern forget it God doesn't change if he did it then he does it today well that could never happen to me how do you know that's the devil telling you that oh you can't you can't walk that close to God that he speaks to you you'll never hear the voice of God you'll never have angels visit you you should actually write those thoughts down put a line under them and say how do you know how do you know right you should see us who have you read the end of your life I think do you know what's going to happen tomorrow oh the same as today how do you know how do you know he won't visit you 10 days there in the upper room the first nine are much the same till they got all burned out and right now ready for the visitation day 10 was very different I mean day 10 was very different here's Cornelius he's praying and angel meets him Cornelius your prayers have come up before God your arms and your prayers have come up before God he's the same right now God hears every prayer amen you're not praying to the sky you're not praying to a wall or to a couch or wherever you're kneeling or standing whatever you may do or driving along God hears your prayers and then he says now your your prayers and others have come up before God now go send him into job her you'll find Simon in her house he'll come tell you the words of life well this is different then he tells everyone brethren I've had a I had a visitation of an angel and they believed him and then he sent two men and then as those two men are travelling Peters Simon Peters on the rooftop and he sees a vision of a sheet come down with all these unclean animals happens three times and then the Lord speaks tongue there's a knock on the door God's ears go with those men he goes to Cornelius this house we live in these days friends I want to recognize we live in these days this is not just some nice story all that happened to them he's the same God right now right and then this Simon Peter comes in all the people are there you know what's gonna happen they are under expectation wouldn't you be under expectation the man that you trusted he know he's lives the holy life and a angel visits him and then he sends two men to go get the Simon Peter now here he is and he's going to tell the words of eternal life not just some nice lecture eternal life is going to be told oh my what what's going to happen then he begins to speak speaks about the crucifixion and the resurrection and the blood hallelujah and while yet Peter spake these words because they were gripped that were really do you think they would have been praying before Simon came Oh God Oh Lord this man is going to tell us the words of eternal life I don't know what's going to happen but I want to be ready I want to be prepared aim in order he prayed up hallelujah and then he comes and he speaks and God falls on them that was a different kind of day right and he's the same God right now hallelujah you know I'll just say this is on the Internet the first the first prayer meeting we ever had for this church we're two tongues interpretation there's eleven of us including children at that time and God said if you remain humble your word my word will go forth and people will come and find rest in this place to me that is God's covenant with us if I may be so bold he promised that and we're eleven and what has happened people have come and found rest hallelujah and God never said no it's done it still continues right now right so I believe I may be so bold I say I believe God is present that if you have not found rest o troubled troubled soul I know what he was like to be a troubled soul in this world burdened cumbered down by sin no peace when God meets you you get peace you get real peace and it's not peace you get by trying to explain away your situation he gives you peace everything will be fine it'll be okay I'll work this out I've got it sorted it's not that kind of it's not that kind of peace this world medicates us dolls all senses that the reality of the situation does not become apparent right it's like someone in hospital they get sedated if there are a lot of pain something's wrong with them they get medicated we need to treat these people we need to keep them in the state till they get well the devil doesn't want you well he wants you did right and this world is here to sedate us you know that the reality of our of our condition of our soul doesn't affect us amen brother Brown told the story of a was a Methodist woman her friend went to the tabernacle this Methodist woman was dying in hospital she was a Sunday school teacher who Sunday school came she was dying the Sunday School came it's actually bitter a farewell the angels were going to come and carry her heart and then when she was dying her true state of her soul became apparent to her and her preacher who was smoking a cigarette out in the corridor came in and she began to scream at him I'm lost you deceive her of men who said the story you heard the story she she says you deceive me I'm lost don't get that girl from that Tabernacle don't get that preacher you deceive her I'm lost because her real state became real because her mental faculties were leaving her right and unfortunately she died in that way but she thought she was a Sunday school teacher she was in a church she was religious she did not have risked for her soul amen that's why we must have reached our troubled soul why delay well Ida life he's rested in this place he is our rest I mean not just for a moment or for her season for eternity I mean my precious wife had had an accident in Switzerland when she was issued lit her answer to the Lord before she died of a brain cancer but she had an accident with a bike and she was in hospital and they gave her a drug and she had an anaphylactic reaction nearly died and she said she was leaving she felt like she was leaving her body and it was the most wonderful feeling because she was going to be if she would have died that moment she knew she wasn't going down she was going up and it was the man you asked her she had the experience she's right back there she wasn't afraid because

was seeing black streaks in the room she was terrified this her Auntie you had no no religion at all and then right near before she died Christine spoke to her Lord spoke to her and she received the blood of the cross and then she started to go in and out and she said I just see birds and paradise and it's so lovely and her and her auntie didn't leave this world loss she left found because of simple acceptance I mean and when you really when you really accept that a chat when you accept it in here it changes your life hallelujah and we're gonna meet Beatrice one day I've never met her in
