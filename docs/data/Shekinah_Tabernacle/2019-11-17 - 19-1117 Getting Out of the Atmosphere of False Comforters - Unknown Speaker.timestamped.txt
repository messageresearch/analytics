[36:18] [Music]
[36:31] god bless you all and this song is
[36:35] called the glory of the Lord is my
[36:37] defense it should be in the system there
[36:40] and I wrote it a few years ago when I
[36:43] passed a preach about it and just for
[36:47] two weeks I have had it on my heart
[36:48] quite a lot in then came again and on
[36:51] the Friday prior prayer meeting this
[36:53] Friday we had it I think was India 10
[36:56] o'clock right so for me it was like now
[37:01] definitely gotta sing this song like
[37:05] when the Lord walked us is he said there
[37:08] was nowhere he could place his heat to
[37:12] rest but then the body was prepared over
[37:16] those seven Church ages then he chip
[37:19] came down in 63 it's a perfect body we
[37:24] don't walk blind the eyes are in the is
[37:27] the eyes are in the head we don't have
[37:30] to walk blind everything's happening all
[37:32] in the head to function the rest of the
[37:34] body and then just reading some of these
[37:37] things the prophet talks about him
[37:39] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[37:40] and he sees that the headship is like a
[37:44] kingdom and he's talking about how the
[37:46] kingdom of heaven is within us so I hear
[37:50] all these things kind of even a little
[37:52] bit of this morning mentioned as well
[37:54] he's our head ship he's our defense he's
[37:58] the one that that laid the cloud was
[38:00] leading the children of Israel by day
[38:02] and in the pillow of night fire by night
[38:04] he's still the same God today so crazy
[38:11] [Music]
[38:19] [Music]
[38:23] glory of the Lord is my defense he's my
[38:29] Savior I'm not just about
[38:33] Constance's ray
[38:36] [Music]
[38:38] God's cloud upon me chose to hedge it
[38:43] make a stand for the glory of
[38:48] what is my affair even
[38:55] the whole
[38:57] tries to bring me down
[39:01] great pressures are a poor me heavy
[39:07] the Lord

[39:23] glory of the Lord
[39:26] is your repair here's your Savior
[39:31] you're not just about what circumstances
[39:34] breathe
[39:36] [Music]
[39:38] God's cloud upon you shows true Hitchin
[39:42] and you make a stand for the glory of
[39:47] the Lord is your defense
[39:53] even like Mozy

[49:56] what are you like it or not just worship
[50:05] okay now our method of the twelve that's
[50:08] why I'm gonna take my switch off from at
[50:12] that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day
[50:14] true they come and the disciples were
[50:16] and hungered and began to plug the ears
[50:19] of corn and to eat on his Sabbath day
[50:23] remember so they failed they committed a
[50:28] burnable seen as the Jews as far as
[50:31] they're concerned but when we first saw
[50:33] it they said unto Him behold that the
[50:37] suppose do that which is not lawful to
[50:39] do upon the Sabbath day but then he who
[50:43] christ's deity i'm society said said it
[50:47] is the pillar of fire a dc-3 came down
[50:49] amen so it's not a man he did make it up
[50:51] it's not Bible School listener is him

[51:38] enter the house of God and it is
[51:40] shewbread which was not lawful for him
[51:42] to eat neither for them which were with
[51:44] him but oh but oh but only for the
[51:47] priests that would have done go down
[51:49] because of time but this is the place I
[51:55] want to take notice and resolve but if

[55:56] anything wrong you you are going to get
[55:59] paid for it

[1:05:25] first so so John Levin we're going to
[1:05:27] read from verse 17 and and we do have us
[1:05:30] on the PowerPoint it says then when
[1:05:35] Jesus came he found that he had lain in
[1:05:37] the grave for days already now Bethany
[1:05:40] was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlong
[1:05:42] loins off and many of the Jews came to
[1:05:46] Martha and Mary to comfort them
[1:05:47] concerning their brother then Martha as
[1:05:50] soon as she heard that Jesus was coming
[1:05:52] went and met him but Mary sat still in
[1:05:55] the house then said Martha unto Jesus
[1:05:57] Lord if thou has had us been here my
[1:05:59] brother had not died but I know that
[1:06:02] even now whatsoever thou ask of God God
[1:06:04] will give it thee jesus saith unto her
[1:06:06] thy brother shall rise again Martha
[1:06:09] saith unto him I know that he shall rise
[1:06:12] again in the resurrection at the last
[1:06:13] day jesus said unto her I am the
[1:06:16] resurrection and the life he that
[1:06:18] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:06:20] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:06:22] believeth in me shall never die
[1:06:23] believeth Aldous she sat unto Him yay
[1:06:26] Lord I believe thou art the Christ the
[1:06:28] Son of God that should come into the
[1:06:30] world and when she so said she went her
[1:06:33] way and called marry her sister secretly
[1:06:36] saying the master has come and calleth
[1:06:38] for thee as soon as she heard that she
[1:06:41] rose quickly and came unto Him now Jesus
[1:06:44] was not yet coming to the town but was
[1:06:47] in that place where Martha met him the
[1:06:49] Jews then that were with her in the in
[1:06:51] the house and comforted her when they
[1:06:53] saw Mary that she rose up hastily went
[1:06:56] out followed her saying she Garth under
[1:06:58] the grave to weep there then when Mary
[1:07:00] was come where Jesus was and saw him she
[1:07:02] fell down at his feet saying unto Him
[1:07:05] Lord if thou had us been here my brother
[1:07:07] had not died when Jesus therefore saw
[1:07:11] her weeping and the Jews also weeping
[1:07:13] which came with her he groaned in the
[1:07:15] spirit and was troubled and said where
[1:07:17] have you laid him they said unto Him
[1:07:19] Lord come and see
[1:07:20] Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how
[1:07:23] he loved him and some of them said could
[1:07:25] not this man which open the eyes of the
[1:07:28] blind have caused that even

[1:08:34] glory Lord amen amen god bless your
[1:08:37] friends you may have your seats this
[1:08:39] morning and I want to I want to take a
[1:08:41] thought here from John 11 while just
[1:08:44] just backing up you know we read there
[1:08:45] at Ephesians that we we do not fight
[1:08:47] flesh and blood you know there's a
[1:08:49] spiritual battle and we must understand
[1:08:52] that there are only two powers in the
[1:08:53] earth I know you know Eve ones is very
[1:08:56] familiar with this thought but when it
[1:08:57] becomes more than a theory but into a
[1:08:59] reality that's where you know you could
[1:09:03] say things become real it's not a
[1:09:05] concept but actually become something
[1:09:07] that happens so we understand that
[1:09:09] there's only two powers in the world
[1:09:10] there's not many you know there's two
[1:09:12] there's God or Satan there's this faith
[1:09:14] or there's unbelief and those two powers
[1:09:17] want to have preeminence over you I mean
[1:09:20] so and it depends which one I believe
[1:09:22] brother Dean you're saying you know
[1:09:23] you're you have power decision you can
[1:09:25] choose so so when you choose to take
[1:09:27] Dominion that's the one that will take
[1:09:29] dominion over you because something must
[1:09:30] have dominion over you because it's how
[1:09:32] we're built something must lead us so so
[1:09:35] if there's only two powers in the earth
[1:09:36] and I just want you to you know it's
[1:09:38] amazing you know I was so moved just
[1:09:40] singing of here here's Mary and Martha
[1:09:43] and there
[1:09:43] and they've just lost their brother you
[1:09:46] know they've you know they've watched
[1:09:47] them die you know they've sent for Jesus
[1:09:49] to come that that he will you know even
[1:09:52] just speak the word or you know and and
[1:09:54] and he'll get well they've seen him
[1:09:56] slowly deteriorate and then finally he
[1:09:58] dies so the life that was once in their
[1:10:01] home that you know no doubt made their
[1:10:03] lives special made you know did you know
[1:10:05] added that little something in there and
[1:10:07] their home had gone and now the Jews
[1:10:10] these Jews came to come and comfort them
[1:10:13] now you've got to be very careful what
[1:10:16] you open yourself to and your time of
[1:10:18] crisis you've got to be very careful
[1:10:20] what your comforter is because I just
[1:10:23] want to come out and say it these Jews
[1:10:25] really were not anointed by faith they
[1:10:27] were not anointed by the word of their
[1:10:29] day they just had a carnal understanding
[1:10:32] and they were actually anointed by the
[1:10:34] devil to create an atmosphere of
[1:10:36] unbelief I mean in Mary Martha's life
[1:10:39] that they will stay in a spot of
[1:10:41] depression they'll stay in a spot of
[1:10:43] loss they will not ever you know you
[1:10:46] know people say to you many times and I
[1:10:48] just want to take this parallel in the
[1:10:50] Christian walk they say when you come to
[1:10:51] terms with your loss then you can move
[1:10:53] on but there's some some things that we
[1:10:56] lose it's actually the devil stolen it
[1:10:58] from us but we have a right to get it
[1:11:01] back and then we have a right by the
[1:11:04] Word of God that if our Joy's been taken
[1:11:06] if our peace has been taken if some
[1:11:09] indifferent spirit comes upon us and we
[1:11:11] feel numb and separated we do not have
[1:11:14] to stay in that condition amen I do not
[1:11:17] believe that we have a first love then
[1:11:20] we lose our first love and we just go
[1:11:22] through the motions that is not the
[1:11:24] brides portion this message is a romance
[1:11:27] it's a love affair I mean the message is
[1:11:30] a love letter to you the Bible is a love
[1:11:32] letter to you I mean and love just gets
[1:11:34] greater gets more gets richer and that's
[1:11:37] how our walk should be but the devil
[1:11:40] don't want you to have that kind of walk
[1:11:42] oh no he wants you to live with a sad
[1:11:46] memory and that's all they had was a sad
[1:11:49] memory of what Lazarus used to be right
[1:11:53] so so here they were comforting
[1:11:55] comforting myriad my
[1:11:57] but they were just anointed by a demon
[1:11:59] power to keep an atmosphere of unbelief
[1:12:02] and sadness upon them because think
[1:12:04] about it here they're you know sure they
[1:12:06] had good intentions many people have
[1:12:08] good intentions
[1:12:09] we're going to be very careful as I said
[1:12:11] what you open yourself to within your
[1:12:13] time of need I mean saying but just
[1:12:16] think about it this said they're crying
[1:12:18] and and their pain was real their
[1:12:20] sadness was real their brother really
[1:12:22] died it was a very traumatic event I
[1:12:24] mean to see their brother whatever
[1:12:26] sickness it was take his life and
[1:12:28] finally he breathed his last breath and
[1:12:30] he's gone and humanly he can never come
[1:12:33] back and so here they were these Jews
[1:12:35] came and tried to comfort them regarding
[1:12:37] this but just but just think about it
[1:12:40] the resurrection and the life was
[1:12:42] walking towards their house and this
[1:12:45] time of despair and this time of sadness
[1:12:47] in this time of loss the resurrection
[1:12:50] and the life was now making step by step
[1:12:53] towards their house and he wasn't coming
[1:12:56] there just to comfort them like the Jews
[1:12:58] were know he was going to break the
[1:12:59] cycle of death he was going to show them
[1:13:02] Nazareth doesn't have to stay dead
[1:13:05] hallelujah so I want you to keep that in
[1:13:07] mind
[1:13:09] hallelujah remember Lazarus had been
[1:13:12] dead for four days by the stage when
[1:13:14] Jesus turned up these Jews would be
[1:13:16] comforting Mary and Martha all this time
[1:13:18] now I don't know how long they would
[1:13:19] have remained there but the devil has a
[1:13:22] way that when he takes something from us
[1:13:25] he will try and ensure that he will keep
[1:13:28] us in that state of loss I mean that's
[1:13:31] his job member brother Bram he says your
[1:13:33] demon pals would fight him in the pulpit
[1:13:35] will come against him he would he would
[1:13:37] speak about how maybe if I just find it
[1:13:41] here you know he says he sees about he
[1:13:46] says now the devil he sees this isn't
[1:13:48] show us our Father and it will suffice
[1:13:49] with us then Martha as soon as she says
[1:13:52] oh see when we're just getting warmed
[1:13:54] into the meeting now see see that Satan
[1:13:57] is trying to ward off that old devil you
[1:13:59] believe right now this is the hour this
[1:14:01] is a time that in your own church you
[1:14:03] can start a revival and do the works of
[1:14:05] God so he tells us that the devil tries
[1:14:08] to ward off the blessings of God
[1:14:11] a man just because he tries to ward them
[1:14:13] off it doesn't mean you're not a
[1:14:14] believer you got to get that out of your
[1:14:16] mind straightaway the reason he tries to
[1:14:18] ward it off is because you are a
[1:14:19] believer he knows if you can take God at
[1:14:22] His Word he is defeated he is powerless
[1:14:24] he will be beaten every place every time
[1:14:27] everywhere just as Jesus defeated him in
[1:14:29] the desert with the Word of God he knows
[1:14:31] the people of God if they recognize who
[1:14:33] they are they'll take that same word and
[1:14:35] defeat him anytime anyplace anywhere
[1:14:38] doesn't matter how they feel doesn't
[1:14:40] matter if they've had a good day or a
[1:14:41] bad day he knows if they take if they
[1:14:44] recognize if you recognize who you are
[1:14:46] and the Lord Jesus Christ and what he's
[1:14:49] made you to be and you take God in His
[1:14:50] Word he'll be defeated he says here and
[1:14:53] for him will I accept in 52 he says oh
[1:14:56] my now I just see them people out there
[1:14:59] just seems like it becomes a mess to me
[1:15:01] and how that I think that Satan just he
[1:15:05] says if I could just break that spirit
[1:15:07] above you right now
[1:15:08] that's all Satan waving his black wings
[1:15:10] around there trying his best to keep you
[1:15:12] from keep you from believing if there's
[1:15:15] some way that that could move away then
[1:15:18] there would be nothing between you and
[1:15:20] the glory land of God that would fall
[1:15:23] upon you and heal every person here
[1:15:25] believe with all your heart even right
[1:15:27] now there's you're the devil's here to
[1:15:29] fight us brother I'm said he hates me I
[1:15:32] hate him so the devil hates you you have
[1:15:35] a real enemy you know we have to
[1:15:37] recognize the devil as real right he's
[1:15:39] not just a thought he's not just a funny
[1:15:41] feeling he's a being and he's come to
[1:15:44] try and rob the people of God from
[1:15:47] everything that God has given them or
[1:15:49] wants to give them so here here's
[1:15:52] leiserson I mean I mean so here's Mary
[1:15:55] Martha and hear her comforters these
[1:15:57] Jews and you know I don't know how long
[1:16:00] they would have remained there in that
[1:16:01] state comforting them keeping that
[1:16:03] atmosphere of sadness and loss but it's
[1:16:05] the same way you know the devil robs us
[1:16:07] but then he tries to keep us in a state
[1:16:10] you know we suffer loss in our Christian
[1:16:12] walk here the storms of life come we get
[1:16:15] poisoned by gossip or a critical spirit
[1:16:17] misunderstandings happen sickness
[1:16:19] strikes the joy once had is gone the
[1:16:22] victory we once had where we didn't care
[1:16:24] who was around us for us like when we
[1:16:26] stepped into church we begin to sing the
[1:16:28] songs of God or open the Bible or just
[1:16:30] talk to it feels like we literally
[1:16:32] heaven just comes down it's like you're
[1:16:34] in a bubble of the Holy Ghost you having
[1:16:35] a glorious time you don't care who saw
[1:16:37] you do whatever you're doing I believe
[1:16:40] we should have freedom to express
[1:16:41] ourselves as we should I mean if we're
[1:16:44] of a little bit quiet that's fine if
[1:16:46] we're very exuberant that's fine I mean
[1:16:48] brother Bram said and deep calls to the
[1:16:50] deep there's a man standing before him
[1:16:52] and he says I can see you're just you're
[1:16:54] just excited that's just his presence
[1:16:56] here that man was standing before the
[1:16:58] angel Lord and he steamed you did still
[1:17:00] so it's not necessarily the outward it's
[1:17:04] what's going on in the heart but I'll
[1:17:06] say this and there's something in the
[1:17:07] heart it'll come out
[1:17:09] hallelujah right amen so now you know
[1:17:13] you know so there's that time where
[1:17:15] literally it feels like heaven just dips
[1:17:17] in I believe in a heartfelt religion
[1:17:20] hallelujah amen but something happens
[1:17:24] and we seem to be no longer that way
[1:17:28] some people say that's maturity I ask
[1:17:31] really hallelujah I don't think that's
[1:17:35] maturity it can just be an indifferent
[1:17:37] feeling and numbness towards the things
[1:17:39] of God we once the fire burn brightly a
[1:17:42] real passion for him has died now
[1:17:45] brother Moses and lady I see in Church
[1:17:46] ages his own I never want any bitterness
[1:17:48] or indifference though we may firmly
[1:17:50] disagree if we are sitting at a table
[1:17:52] and one eating one kind of pie and one
[1:17:55] another that'll be just as much as right
[1:17:57] here when it comes to fellowship one
[1:17:59] with another we love one another and if
[1:18:01] we don't do that then we should do that
[1:18:04] see see and he says we'll never go no
[1:18:06] farther and God until we do that what
[1:18:09] love one another so he says I don't want
[1:18:11] any indifference to come around me
[1:18:13] what's going to happen though it's going
[1:18:15] to try we are going to be tempt we are
[1:18:17] going to be tested by every spirit you
[1:18:19] can imagine every spirit just because
[1:18:22] the devil you know just because you
[1:18:23] defeat him in one case he doesn't just
[1:18:25] quit he's gonna see in something else
[1:18:28] Allu you remember the Lord Jesus has
[1:18:31] already overcome all things right so he
[1:18:34] already overcame that devil and if he's
[1:18:36] in you you'll overcome that
[1:18:38] amen so you know hallelujah no
[1:18:42] indifference just a definition so it
[1:18:46] means you know that it doesn't matter
[1:18:48] one way or another it's of no importance
[1:18:51] or value one way or another it's marked
[1:18:54] by no special liking or dislike of
[1:18:56] something it's marked by a lack of
[1:18:58] interest enthusiasm concerning something
[1:19:02] once on fire for God now just become
[1:19:04] indifferent well I've heard it all
[1:19:06] before
[1:19:06] it should it should still be alive I
[1:19:09] mean it should still be a living yo God
[1:19:12] doesn't just become dead the word still
[1:19:15] alive hallelujah well I've heard that
[1:19:18] before you'll hear it again hallelujah
[1:19:21] you know so that kind of thing comes in
[1:19:25] but let's go back to Mary Martha's house
[1:19:27] let's go into the mind of the let's go
[1:19:29] into the mind of the comforters I'm
[1:19:31] sorry I'm so sorry for your loss I'm so
[1:19:34] sorry your brother died I'm so sorry
[1:19:37] that life will never be the same because
[1:19:38] he's gone always tries to do the
[1:19:41] negative I'm sorry that your joy seems
[1:19:43] to have gone I guess it just wasn't for
[1:19:46] you you know the devil comes you want
[1:19:48] something there's always a voice saying
[1:19:50] it's not for you that's the devil that's
[1:19:52] actually God's that's actually the devil
[1:19:54] confirming to you it's for you you've
[1:19:56] got to take the opposite should I repeat
[1:19:58] that again I meant the devil says it's
[1:20:01] not for you he says the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:20:04] for you you'll never overcome this thing
[1:20:05] you'll never be this way and that's
[1:20:07] actually the devil confirming - it's for
[1:20:09] you you got to take the opposite what
[1:20:11] he's telling you you've got to take the
[1:20:12] opposite lelou you amen I'm sorry that
[1:20:17] you know your meekness your
[1:20:18] long-suffering nature has died your love
[1:20:20] for others that you once loved everybody
[1:20:22] no matter how they treated you it's gone
[1:20:23] you know I guess maybe you know you know
[1:20:27] Mary Martha it's a different stage of
[1:20:28] life now you know if one has to die and
[1:20:31] Lazarus there was this time you know you
[1:20:33] just got to accept the fact that the
[1:20:35] life you once had in your home it can't
[1:20:36] come back you can't have that same kind
[1:20:39] of walk no more you can't have that
[1:20:40] overcoming life no more you can't have
[1:20:42] that joy and speak will full of glory no
[1:20:44] more it's because you've grown up
[1:20:47] really this is comforting this is the
[1:20:50] devil comforting
[1:20:52] you know that person did that to you
[1:20:53] well I guess you can never look at them
[1:20:55] the same way you can never treat them
[1:20:57] with love again because they did that to
[1:20:59] you
[1:20:59] really love covers a multitude of sins
[1:21:02] Amen if he if Christ loves the unlovable
[1:21:04] I mean we should be able to love
[1:21:06] everybody we should be able to treat
[1:21:08] them with love and respect irrespective
[1:21:11] of how they treat you that's not the
[1:21:12] thing it's how you treat them
[1:21:14] I mean they may pour sulfuric acid down
[1:21:16] your neck you'll just say well they've
[1:21:18] never seen love like this how Louie how
[1:21:20] you treat them back Amen well I guess
[1:21:23] you know I guess you've just got to come
[1:21:26] to us with Mary Martha he's really did
[1:21:29] that trauma really happened to you you
[1:21:33] know I guess it's just a different stage
[1:21:34] of life you know I mean maybe your joy
[1:21:36] has now just become a deep joy and so
[1:21:39] deep it never comes out
[1:21:40] maybe the peace you have is so deep you
[1:21:43] know maybe or maybe not maybe it's just
[1:21:48] in a different spirit trying to rob you
[1:21:50] of the joy and the victory that is yours
[1:21:53] maybe well no it's not indifference
[1:21:56] maybe you're just stable in your walk
[1:21:59] maybe no maybe it's just indifference
[1:22:03] maybe that cold spirit comes along you
[1:22:05] know where we're with the Lord as this
[1:22:08] life you want to see why has the devil
[1:22:10] turned you know you take the Anglican
[1:22:13] Church you're all the churches of the
[1:22:14] West and even these why they so quiet
[1:22:16] now we're gonna do this now we still I
[1:22:19] was I was at boarding school with
[1:22:21] Anglican Chapel three times a week you
[1:22:23] stand up you say this sit down say this
[1:22:25] say this cygnus arm sit down you know
[1:22:28] it's just all just a form
[1:22:29] there's no life there's no joy there's
[1:22:33] not half our religion there's no
[1:22:34] expression why did it become that way
[1:22:36] because that's what the devil wants us
[1:22:38] to be
[1:22:40] called formal Luke woman Paulus we don't
[1:22:44] want to be and this and see of people in
[1:22:46] there they just it's the system that
[1:22:47] destroys people see it's not the people
[1:22:49] as a system I mean but you know we don't
[1:22:51] want to ever systemize the message and
[1:22:54] to just a form of religion this should
[1:22:56] be a heartfelt religion Joanne speak
[1:22:59] will full of glory that were actually
[1:23:01] happy we're saved we're happy we're free
[1:23:03] we're happy we're overcoming we're happy
[1:23:05] we have life that's how we should feel I
[1:23:07] mean our salvation is not based on how
[1:23:09] we feel we know I mean I'm not saved
[1:23:12] because I feel I'm saying I'm saved
[1:23:14] because I believe it's word I'm saved I
[1:23:15] have met his requirements of his word
[1:23:17] right so first and foremost my salvation
[1:23:20] is not based on how I feel I mean but
[1:23:22] because it's a heartfelt religion love
[1:23:24] as a feeling I mean so if you love the
[1:23:26] Lord you will feel that love hallelujah
[1:23:29] I tried I trust that came out the right
[1:23:31] balance you know I'm not gonna take a
[1:23:33] rapture because I feel it I believe it
[1:23:35] he's revealed it to me it's become a
[1:23:37] revelation hallelujah amen
[1:23:41] so Lazarus you know you know maybe
[1:23:43] that's begin to talk about how Lazarus
[1:23:45] was such a good man you know maybe they
[1:23:47] would relate stories those Jews that
[1:23:49] knew knew Lazarus fairly well maybe they
[1:23:51] tell you know how he did this for me
[1:23:53] anyways was so kind and thoughtful and
[1:23:55] you know but they no doubt you know as
[1:23:57] they begin to reminisce over Lazarus's
[1:23:59] life they naturally begin to speak out
[1:24:02] then when Jesus came into their life and
[1:24:03] how the friendship formed and I imagine
[1:24:07] even in their anguish Mary and Martha
[1:24:08] would relate when they begin to realize
[1:24:10] Jesus was more than a man where he is
[1:24:13] more than a holy man even more than a
[1:24:15] prophet but he is God himself
[1:24:18] hallelujah but no doubt the Jews would
[1:24:20] pop out at this moment because just as
[1:24:22] faith is trying to rise what happens the
[1:24:24] devil comes along he tries to just pour
[1:24:27] put a wet blanket over the whole thing
[1:24:28] but no doubt it about this time the Jews
[1:24:31] would pipe up and say but didn't you
[1:24:34] send word to him that Lazarus was sick
[1:24:37] didn't he heal other people didn't you
[1:24:41] see him do the miraculous you just his
[1:24:42] to fight he did but why did he come and
[1:24:45] help your brother he said he loved him
[1:24:47] why didn't he come that's the devil
[1:24:51] being a comforter he always puts a quick
[1:24:53] should mark against the Word of God yet
[1:24:56] trying to console you trying to comfort
[1:24:59] you but he's just trying to keep you
[1:25:01] stuck down in your rut and he puts you
[1:25:04] there in the first place
[1:25:05] but he comes alongside you remember we
[1:25:07] shouldn't be ignorant to the devil's
[1:25:08] devices right there's a real devil
[1:25:11] there's a real mind battle I mean so you
[1:25:14] know but didn't didn't he heal other
[1:25:15] people why could he do this and then but
[1:25:19] then they no doubt would have gone in
[1:25:20] and I said but surely if only you had
[1:25:23] taken him to the hospital so he tries to
[1:25:26] poor and regret he tries to get you to
[1:25:28] sick and guess what you've done you know
[1:25:31] surely if you did something different
[1:25:33] Lazarus maybe wouldn't have died that's
[1:25:36] the devil comforting see you following
[1:25:38] me surely if you only said that to that
[1:25:40] person that wouldn't have happened that
[1:25:41] way surely if you went here and did this
[1:25:44] it wouldn't happen that way but you've
[1:25:45] got to understand your foot steps are
[1:25:47] ordered of God you've got to have peace
[1:25:49] that the Lord has ordained your steps
[1:25:51] the good end what we call the bad steps
[1:25:53] hallelujah you know surely you know and
[1:25:57] and and what is he trying to do he's
[1:25:58] trying to put blame on you it's actually
[1:26:01] basically they're saying this is just me
[1:26:03] the comforters are saying to Mary Martha
[1:26:05] it's actually your fault he's dead
[1:26:06] because you should have got some other
[1:26:08] treatments in waiting for Jesus to come
[1:26:10] well is that he try to pour on regret
[1:26:14] you see the devil he will always get us
[1:26:17] to focus on the negative keep trying you
[1:26:20] to look at the circumstances trying to
[1:26:23] keep you in a pity party and not look at
[1:26:25] the word yes yes you were there yes you
[1:26:31] were that way but then such-and-such
[1:26:32] happens you know sure I was full of joy
[1:26:36] once I didn't care what everyone thought
[1:26:38] I was just in love with the Lord but
[1:26:40] then things happen in life sure you know
[1:26:44] but then such-and-such happened some you
[1:26:46] know you just can't change you know you
[1:26:50] just can't change it I mean you can't
[1:26:51] change that Lazarus instead the life has
[1:26:53] gone out you can never get them back you
[1:26:54] can never get that kind of joy back kind
[1:26:56] of love back sure you may be happy in
[1:26:58] the Lord again but how will they ever be
[1:27:00] the same
[1:27:01] Mary Martha you'll come to terms with
[1:27:03] the fact Lazarus died it'll be a happy
[1:27:05] memory you'll still you know
[1:27:07] and you know there's the resurrection at
[1:27:09] the end you'll see him one day you'll
[1:27:11] have that joy one day I'm gonna come to
[1:27:14] that later you know but but so so so
[1:27:16] yeah butBut Mary Martha you know you'll
[1:27:18] pick your life back together your walk
[1:27:20] will still kind of come to some kind of
[1:27:21] resemblance but I'm sorry because he
[1:27:23] died you can never go back to what you
[1:27:25] had before he died oh isn't that
[1:27:27] comforting no that's a lie from the pit
[1:27:29] of hell hallelujah the Lord said I shall
[1:27:32] restore I mean so what you had you shall
[1:27:35] be restored - hallelujah why you see I
[1:27:40] just put this on my nose here why are
[1:27:42] you preaching this way because the devil
[1:27:43] wants toward us from every divine
[1:27:45] promise of God to make us indifferent
[1:27:48] cold formal of powerless and many times
[1:27:50] it's actually an evil spirit affecting
[1:27:52] us and we just get used to it as opposed
[1:27:55] to resisting the devil and getting rid
[1:27:57] of the thing we actually we actually
[1:27:59] begin to agree with the comforter and
[1:28:02] God doesn't want it that's not comfort
[1:28:04] that's just actually him trying to pour
[1:28:06] unbelief upon you because remember the
[1:28:08] resurrection the life is walking towards
[1:28:09] you just like he's walking to their
[1:28:12] house hallelujah now Jesus he referred
[1:28:19] to Moses as he lifted up the serpent in
[1:28:21] the wilderness even so the Son of Man
[1:28:22] will be lifted up that whosoever
[1:28:24] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:28:26] have eternal life we know we had that
[1:28:28] tongues interpretation about four prep
[1:28:30] meetings ago he said yo yo as the
[1:28:34] serpent was lifted up by Moses so if I
[1:28:36] be lifted up he says I'm the antidote
[1:28:38] for every snake bite the Lord the word
[1:28:41] is the antidote for every snake bite of
[1:28:43] of the devil not just for our young
[1:28:45] people but for all of us right and and
[1:28:48] then and ever so we must remember that
[1:28:50] we have the antidote for every bite of
[1:28:53] the devil
[1:28:55] everyone we have Moses's medical cabinet
[1:28:59] on the lower hills all my diseases I
[1:29:00] mean we have it now this word that's
[1:29:02] innocence living we have it this message
[1:29:04] we don't need to go find it somewhere
[1:29:07] God said here you go I will give you the
[1:29:10] first aid kit you need for every day of
[1:29:12] your life's journey hallelujah so you
[1:29:17] know because you know I've never been
[1:29:19] bitten by a snake before but I'm sure
[1:29:22] you know but I'm sure if you have or
[1:29:25] someone has they will remember
[1:29:26] especially a poisonous one they will
[1:29:29] remember the time when it bit you right
[1:29:31] now some snakes can actually bite you
[1:29:33] don't feel the fangs but then the effect
[1:29:35] of the poison starts to grip the body
[1:29:37] right so I remember see so you may not
[1:29:41] feel the Fang bites necessarily but you
[1:29:43] may feel the effects of the venom and if
[1:29:46] you can get anti-venom as quick as you
[1:29:48] can
[1:29:48] right then then you can actually
[1:29:50] counteract the effects of the venom but
[1:29:52] the longer you leave it the worse you
[1:29:54] can become it means so so many times
[1:29:57] what happens the devil comes along
[1:29:58] remember the Lord is going to prove his
[1:30:00] salvation so the Lord will actually
[1:30:03] allow the devil to bite you he will
[1:30:07] actually allow an evil spirit to come
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:10] just like what it what did God what did
[1:30:13] what did God say to Satan about joke you
[1:30:16] can do this but you can't take his life
[1:30:18] and the devil pushed to the very edge of
[1:30:21] that boundary and and job didn't know
[1:30:23] what was going on life just went upside
[1:30:25] down real quick but you know he was
[1:30:28] trusting in the lamb right he didn't
[1:30:30] understand the whole picture but he was
[1:30:31] trusting in the lamp so the devil was
[1:30:33] allowed to be turned loose upon job
[1:30:34] because God was willing to show job the
[1:30:37] power of his salvation
[1:30:38] Amen it's the same thing God will
[1:30:41] actually allow the devil to be turned
[1:30:43] loose upon you I mean that you will
[1:30:45] actually see through the trial the power
[1:30:47] of God salvation his keeping power his
[1:30:49] overcoming power because he wants to
[1:30:51] manifest it in you see it's easy to say
[1:30:54] we are overcomers but then you've got to
[1:30:56] overcome something and then it's very
[1:30:58] different right but in order to be an
[1:31:00] overcomer there's something you must
[1:31:02] overcome
[1:31:02] we know there's the devil that's got to
[1:31:04] be overcome our own flesh has to be
[1:31:06] overcome right but we will
[1:31:08] overcomers on that side amen hallelujah
[1:31:12] so so the problem is now if you don't
[1:31:15] know you've been bitten by a venomous
[1:31:16] snake then the poison can work longer in
[1:31:20] your body and you'll get sicker and
[1:31:21] sicker and sicker and sometimes the
[1:31:24] devil will bite us but and then we'll be
[1:31:27] under the effect of a spirit of gossip
[1:31:29] or critical spirit or something will
[1:31:31] happen and we won't actually understand
[1:31:34] why we're this way right someone gets
[1:31:37] bitten by a snake maybe their organs
[1:31:39] swell I was saying they begin to feel
[1:31:40] the physical effects of that bite but
[1:31:43] spiritually the same thing can happen
[1:31:45] are you all following me right but we've
[1:31:48] got to recognize because you got to
[1:31:50] think now there was a time when I had
[1:31:52] joy unspeakable everything was wonderful
[1:31:55] everything was great doesn't matter what
[1:31:56] was going on around me I was on the
[1:31:58] Hallelujah side right but then if the
[1:32:02] devil bites you you will fall from that
[1:32:04] position to another position where you
[1:32:06] won't be you you'll be under the effects
[1:32:07] of the venom as opposed to the effect of
[1:32:09] your experience of your walk with God
[1:32:11] but then what's but then you've got to
[1:32:14] say I so so you've been bitten you're
[1:32:16] sick you got to remember I was once not
[1:32:19] this way what caused me to go from this
[1:32:23] way to what I was hallelujah and so now
[1:32:27] if you have a memory this is what I once
[1:32:28] was like because what God did view is
[1:32:31] real there's a real work in your life
[1:32:33] yes say well I shouldn't be sick I
[1:32:35] should be rejoicing I should have peace
[1:32:39] I should have love I should be just
[1:32:41] shouting and heavy a glorious time
[1:32:42] however the Lord moves on my heart to
[1:32:44] express his praise it should be
[1:32:46] happening
[1:32:47] so if I'm sick if I'm not that way if
[1:32:50] I'm cold and different and separate from
[1:32:53] God because maybe pain hurt or put up
[1:32:55] walls you gotta say no this is not my
[1:32:57] portion this is the devil trying to rob
[1:32:59] me of my victory hallelujah amen and so
[1:33:04] you've got to recognize this is not me
[1:33:07] maturing this is actually the devil
[1:33:08] trying to destroy me hallelujah amen see
[1:33:14] I've seen big giant trees full of green
[1:33:17] leaves blowing in the wind howl ooh yeah
[1:33:20] they're still moving as a spirit
[1:33:21] they're rejoicing just like we're now
[1:33:24] little hallelujah but they're still
[1:33:25] rejoicing so little and they and they
[1:33:28] can actually draw a lot more water out
[1:33:30] of the ground because their root systems
[1:33:32] far bigger than a sampling they can draw
[1:33:33] a lot more of the word up holy and
[1:33:35] create an atmosphere around them
[1:33:37] hallelujah amen they're still doing the
[1:33:39] same thing as a young as a young tree
[1:33:41] hallelujah but now they're just just
[1:33:43] just draw more out they got more leaves
[1:33:45] out hallelujah
[1:33:47] what still the same tree but then I've
[1:33:49] seen trees that are dead we've seen a
[1:33:52] big giant tree there's no life and
[1:33:54] there's you you know get it actually you
[1:33:56] know feel the breeze go thought there's
[1:33:58] no it's not rejoicing it's not shouting
[1:34:00] oh it's mature no actually it's dead
[1:34:03] there's no life to prove what's in it is
[1:34:06] not being manifested so you know you've
[1:34:08] got to think now what bit me and
[1:34:10] ultimately it's not the person it's the
[1:34:12] devil
[1:34:13] hallelujah but we have the antidote for
[1:34:16] every bite hallelujah now he was now so
[1:34:21] so you know so far worse than a natural
[1:34:23] snakebite is a you know as the devil
[1:34:26] sometimes we don't realize we mean
[1:34:28] bitten when someone has spoken to us and
[1:34:31] the next thing you know we're all
[1:34:32] troubled in our spirits I mean because
[1:34:34] you heard something about brother
[1:34:36] so-and-so and sisters so-and-so now
[1:34:37] that's just gripped you and now you're
[1:34:39] all heavy and down what's happened bite
[1:34:43] right because you know sometimes when
[1:34:45] you say all the devil's come against you
[1:34:46] think there's some big creature just
[1:34:48] appears out of nowhere and you know no
[1:34:50] spirits travel onwards Spurs travel
[1:34:54] onwards and that's why there's some
[1:34:55] people you can I'm talking about
[1:34:57] believers too
[1:34:58] you know you can spend time with some
[1:35:00] people you feel so refreshed you feel so
[1:35:03] happy why you've come under the greeny
[1:35:05] leaves yeah leaves are the fellowship
[1:35:07] having a wonderful time and then there's
[1:35:09] some believers sure they may look the
[1:35:10] part but you just don't really want to
[1:35:12] be around them there's a different
[1:35:14] spirit see that's not the person it's a
[1:35:18] spirit I mean because that's why you
[1:35:22] know brother Bray I'm told the story of
[1:35:23] the two going through a divorce and
[1:35:25] they're and they're and they're going
[1:35:26] through the house and this is minor this
[1:35:28] is mine but then finally they came up to
[1:35:30] the attic where they picked up a little
[1:35:31] baby bootie and the memory of life
[1:35:34] coming for
[1:35:35] brought them back together hallelujah
[1:35:37] and that's why you've got always go back
[1:35:40] to you know think about when life came
[1:35:42] when that brother or sister was with you
[1:35:44] and in a meeting in a convention it was
[1:35:46] and God came down and life was birthed
[1:35:50] hallelujah those memories those
[1:35:52] experiences keep us together amen
[1:35:55] isn't that right hallelujah it's not
[1:35:58] about this in that kitchen now this is
[1:35:59] my no no no it's when life comes that's
[1:36:02] the important thing
[1:36:03] how can i overcome he says I was
[1:36:05] crossing he says I was crossing an old
[1:36:08] log the other day or why should we call
[1:36:10] it a hallow and I jumped up on this log
[1:36:12] we have yeah good luck trying to find it
[1:36:15] and I jumped up on the slog on the
[1:36:18] outside sobrevivir and it looked good
[1:36:21] looked like a big old beach log then I
[1:36:23] just jumped on it a great big chunk fell
[1:36:25] off was real rotten and dirty I see
[1:36:27] that's the way the Christians are
[1:36:28] becoming they did incident trespass as
[1:36:30] long as that become dirty they can hold
[1:36:33] no weight at all see they don't know
[1:36:35] what the overcoming means and I think
[1:36:37] and I begin to think in the stick see
[1:36:39] and overcome keep life in you when life
[1:36:42] went out that's was when the log brought
[1:36:44] the log to that condition see and it was
[1:36:46] made worse than ever when it laid in
[1:36:48] that branch where the water was and then
[1:36:50] there you take a Christian that supposed
[1:36:52] to be a Christian that the life of God
[1:36:54] go from him and the experience the joy
[1:36:57] of serving Christ and living in a church
[1:36:59] where such as going on he wrought ins
[1:37:02] twice as quick right living right under
[1:37:04] it so if you're trying to follow the
[1:37:06] message of the hour at least this part
[1:37:07] of the message we should live constantly
[1:37:09] in the life of Christ
[1:37:10] see cause if you don't you lay around
[1:37:12] and know these things that you're
[1:37:14] supposed to do and don't do it the Bible
[1:37:15] said he that knoweth to do good and
[1:37:17] doeth it not to him it's end then you
[1:37:19] become dirty rotten when you're separate
[1:37:21] from the love of God so strive with all
[1:37:24] that's in you just stay in the life of
[1:37:25] Christ that we would be fruit-bearing
[1:37:29] hallelujah brother bang speaks and
[1:37:31] believe us now this keep life about your
[1:37:35] church
[1:37:35] don't leave bidness comin don't need any
[1:37:37] difference to only some critical spirit
[1:37:39] don't they don't forgiveness take root
[1:37:41] keep life about you because remember the
[1:37:43] Lord he doesn't you know we are meat to
[1:37:46] be like he when he has baptized you as
[1:37:47] the Lamb of
[1:37:48] God and then spread of God descend upon
[1:37:50] like a dove hallelujah and brother Brown
[1:37:53] teaches very simply that dove would
[1:37:55] never land head to land upon the same
[1:37:57] kind of animal that had the same kind of
[1:37:58] nature he would never land upon a wolf
[1:38:01] and it's the same thing with us you know
[1:38:03] we can get a critical nature we can
[1:38:05] become a wolf again and the and the
[1:38:07] devil take its flight and we'll wait and
[1:38:10] the rafters until you're ready you
[1:38:12] repent then he'll come back again that's
[1:38:15] why we're going to keep were to keep
[1:38:16] life about us he says he doesn't believe
[1:38:19] ourselves leave us thou lovest and food
[1:38:21] I mean in nineteen fifty says then I
[1:38:23] look at them and immediately after that
[1:38:25] they needed food to live on God rained
[1:38:28] God rained down out of heaven man or a
[1:38:30] type of the Holy Ghost every morning
[1:38:33] they went out picked it up it was good
[1:38:34] they eat it it tastes like honey they
[1:38:36] would just lick their lips and eat it I
[1:38:37] tell you this Holy Ghost it rains now
[1:38:39] which was that type and this is the
[1:38:41] anti-type it taste like honey that's
[1:38:43] right I've seen the saints of God so
[1:38:44] drunk till they lick their lips moon so
[1:38:47] good there's something about hunting
[1:38:49] hallelujah I mean David the older of the
[1:38:52] psalmist in the Bible he talked about
[1:38:54] the honey and here's a shepherd the
[1:38:56] Shepherd used to carry a little old
[1:38:57] script bag and in there they had honey
[1:38:59] in it and when their sheep would get
[1:39:01] sick that put that honey all on a rock a
[1:39:04] limestone rock and those six sheep we're
[1:39:07] going to licking that rock and when they
[1:39:08] did licking off the honey the area's
[1:39:10] hallelujah glory just look on it that's
[1:39:12] all right he says listen brother I tell
[1:39:14] you I'll put it on Christ not some
[1:39:17] church either I'll go to Christ where it
[1:39:19] belongs on lick on him hallelujah you
[1:39:21] need healing if there's any virtue if
[1:39:23] there's any path if there's any praise
[1:39:24] it belongs to her may men that's right
[1:39:26] on Christ the solid rock to rock the
[1:39:28] rock played a big part in it too a long
[1:39:31] time ago when they when they used to
[1:39:34] have the rock used to be people that got
[1:39:36] bit by a mad dog they'll take a stick
[1:39:39] and they take and stick them to a mad
[1:39:42] stone if they got stuck they got well if
[1:39:44] they didn't stick they died
[1:39:46] the worst mad dog I know is the devil
[1:39:48] that's right and the only cure I know is
[1:39:49] the rock of ages' stick to it hold on
[1:39:52] and God will take care of it little boy
[1:39:54] here in a wheelchair you blind sir you
[1:39:56] laying on a cart holding to hold to
[1:39:58] God's unchanging hands
[1:39:59] the devil might have a bit you but
[1:40:01] there's enough drawing power of the Rock
[1:40:03] of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself
[1:40:05] Annie hallelujah the devil don't can't
[1:40:07] get you when you're hit in there stick
[1:40:10] with it hold on to it don't let away
[1:40:11] from it no matter how many symptoms
[1:40:14] appear how many this or that or the
[1:40:15] other hole to it stay there until the
[1:40:17] healing power has drawn all the disease
[1:40:19] from you that's right he will do it
[1:40:23] hallelujah we have the Rock of Ages just
[1:40:27] stick to it it'll draw it all the
[1:40:28] sickness and disease hallelujah
[1:40:31] hallelujah so now we if we just go back
[1:40:36] to Mary and Martha's house the
[1:40:39] comforters have had their way for four
[1:40:41] days but now Jesus was on his road now
[1:40:45] when you know maybe I'll just say this
[1:40:48] but but Mary and Martha had to get out
[1:40:50] of that atmosphere they had to get into
[1:40:53] an atmosphere of faith to see the
[1:40:55] resurrection of the previous life
[1:40:57] hallelujah
[1:40:59] that's why would you keep an atmosphere
[1:41:00] of faith I mean what does worry do
[1:41:02] brother his worry has no virtue at all
[1:41:04] amen but faith can deliver hallelujah
[1:41:09] and and brother sees and faith is our
[1:41:12] victory says there there may not be a
[1:41:14] chance for you to live you may be dying
[1:41:16] with cancer you may be bound to a
[1:41:18] wheelchair you may be totally blind I
[1:41:19] don't know what your trouble is but if
[1:41:21] you just take the chief doctor's
[1:41:23] prescription whatsoever you desire when
[1:41:25] you pray believe you receive it and you
[1:41:27] shall have it and believe that faith
[1:41:29] will overcome any difficult that there
[1:41:31] is you may be so burden until sin unto I
[1:41:35] mean we're sittin till your soul is as
[1:41:36] smutty as it can be you may have tried
[1:41:39] to get rid of that ill temper that
[1:41:41] slandering tongue that gossip on the
[1:41:42] telephone you might have tried every
[1:41:44] remedy you know how but if you just let
[1:41:47] Jesus Christ come into you tonight he'll
[1:41:50] operate on your faith and give you a
[1:41:52] faith that will climb beyond anything
[1:41:54] that the word can produce world can
[1:41:56] produce why faith is the victory that
[1:41:58] overcomes the world holier how could you
[1:42:02] doubt when Jesus Christ and Son Living
[1:42:03] God as prison here now his great Holy
[1:42:06] Spirit in this building the word promise
[1:42:07] that lo I am with you always even to the
[1:42:09] end of the world it was promised by the
[1:42:12] Lord
[1:42:12] God has to keep his word do you believe
[1:42:14] that when he promised he would do these
[1:42:16] things God is solemnly obligated to do
[1:42:19] such a man no no from that scripture of
[1:42:23] you know I think it's in first John that
[1:42:24] our faith is our victory that overcomes
[1:42:26] the world that word victory means our
[1:42:28] means of success well that's only used
[1:42:31] once in the scripture that word victory
[1:42:32] there so it's our means of of success is
[1:42:35] our faith that's the victory so our
[1:42:37] revelation of who we are who God is
[1:42:39] actually is the means of our victories
[1:42:41] the means of our success over the world
[1:42:44] hallelujah but now merit so Mary Martha
[1:42:47] had resurrection faith amen
[1:42:49] they had the faith that that Jesus would
[1:42:51] come and raise yo they had resurrection
[1:42:54] faith but under the I'm no but being
[1:42:56] with their comforters in the house
[1:42:57] didn't help them didn't help that faith
[1:42:59] actually come to life so as soon as your
[1:43:01] says in John 11 and 20 then Martha as
[1:43:04] soon as she heard that Jews was coming
[1:43:05] went and met him I mean if it says but
[1:43:08] Mary I'm still sat in the house so now
[1:43:10] now Martha goes out gets out of that
[1:43:13] atmosphere hallelujah to go and actually
[1:43:16] meet the resurrection in the life
[1:43:17] hallelujah and then that's why you know
[1:43:20] you know if the comforters could just
[1:43:22] keep them in the atmosphere you're the
[1:43:23] devil in you I can stop this all from
[1:43:25] happening hallelujah if he could just
[1:43:27] keep you in that gloomy indifferent sad
[1:43:30] the precious pity party atmosphere God
[1:43:33] can't live it doesn't start it doesn't
[1:43:35] take your salvation away but God can't
[1:43:37] live in that kind of atmosphere I mean
[1:43:39] so so so Martha went out begin to speak
[1:43:42] with the Lord amen and then so so Martha
[1:43:47] now went from a different atmosphere of
[1:43:48] one of unbelief to one you know one that
[1:43:51] you know you know into one that wasn't
[1:43:54] one of pity party sadness and ultimately
[1:43:57] doubt in Lord Jesus Christ but she went
[1:43:59] to an atmosphere of the resurrection
[1:44:01] hallelujah
[1:44:02] because remember he was on his way and
[1:44:04] he came hallelujah and I'll say the same
[1:44:07] thing with you and I you may be sitting
[1:44:09] in the gloomiest worst spot in your life
[1:44:12] but you've got to remember Jesus is here
[1:44:14] the resurrection and the life is here to
[1:44:17] take that all away
[1:44:18] kaalia to restore the walk you once had
[1:44:22] to restore you back to that walk
[1:44:24] hallelujah so now Martha begins to speak
[1:44:27] to the Lord says Lord Jesus if thou has
[1:44:28] been here my brother had not died but I
[1:44:31] know that even now whatsoever thou will
[1:44:33] ask of God God will give it thee jesus
[1:44:35] said unto her thy brother shall raise
[1:44:37] again Martha said unto him I know that
[1:44:40] he shall raise again in the resurrection
[1:44:41] at the last day so if I can put in other
[1:44:44] words yes Lord I know when I'm an
[1:44:47] eternity then I'll be happy again yes
[1:44:51] Lord I know when I have my glorified
[1:44:53] body then I'll really shout and praise
[1:44:55] you and have joy and speakable but not
[1:44:57] now I can't have it now I know one day
[1:44:59] one day in the future when there's no
[1:45:02] sin there's no devil then I can really
[1:45:04] sing how I want to sing I can walk with
[1:45:06] God really how I want to walk but jesus
[1:45:09] never wants us to put the promise in the
[1:45:11] future he is not interested in saying
[1:45:14] yes one day no he said to her I am the
[1:45:17] resurrection and the life she saying I
[1:45:21] am present right now the resurrection of
[1:45:24] life not one day will be I am hallelujah
[1:45:27] so so he took Martha from a future one
[1:45:31] day because note how the confidence said
[1:45:33] one day in the resurrection you'll see
[1:45:34] him again one day you'll see him as he
[1:45:36] is putting off in the future the devil
[1:45:37] says one day but not now one day but not
[1:45:39] now but in the Lord comes his no no no
[1:45:41] not one day but now hallelujah
[1:45:45] hallelujah you can have joy now Martha
[1:45:48] you can have peace now Martha you can
[1:45:50] have an overcoming life now Martha you
[1:45:53] can rejoice now you're gonna have your
[1:45:54] first love now not in the future but
[1:45:57] right now hallelujah
[1:46:00] why cuz I am the resurrection and the
[1:46:03] life I haven't don't listen to the
[1:46:05] comforter of the devil he's a liar he
[1:46:07] just tried to rob you of your god-given
[1:46:08] rights hallelujah hallelujah but then he
[1:46:13] says no it's not for you that that event
[1:46:15] in your life was so traumatic hey death
[1:46:17] is a traumatic thing that death was so
[1:46:19] traumatic or so sad you can never have
[1:46:21] what you once had but you said now I'm
[1:46:24] going to show you well hallelujah and

[1:46:28] reality hallelujah is the same thing

[1:46:32] nice idea about having joy going back to

[1:46:39] to take the devil's Regent Club telling
[1:46:41] us shut up and sit down
[1:46:43] hallelujah because he can beat us down
[1:46:45] all he wants but I just say Devils no

[1:52:07] down and shut up but no if we want to
[1:52:10] stand and shout stand and shout you want
[1:52:12] a dancer on however remember when the

[1:52:21] don't be afraid to be out of order if

[1:52:46] so let us be glad and rejoice hallelujah
[1:52:49] you think we don't have to go through
[1:52:52] tribulation hallelujah the wrath of gods
[1:52:56] can report out upon the earth and God
[1:52:57] said no you're not gonna be there I have
[1:52:59] to take you out I can't leave you on the
[1:53:01] earth however when I when I leave when
[1:53:03] the Holy Spirit lifts off the earth you
[1:53:05] have to come with because you're part of
[1:53:07] me you're part of the work
[1:53:08] hallelujah we've got a lot to rejoice
[1:53:10] about hallelujah hallelujah you know you
[1:53:16] know when brother cadre said let's go to
[1:53:17] heaven hallelujah I don't I didn't have
[1:53:22] all really I'll say yeah here we are but
[1:53:25] then to me that wasn't the greatest
[1:53:27] thing he says in the door comes open and
[1:53:29] then God's presence goes before him or
[1:53:31] mine and he steps in the door hallelujah
[1:53:35] hallelujah you know people say you don't
[1:53:39] need to shout God will hear you I see
[1:53:41] become making beef hallelujah
[1:53:45] he says overcome means to recognize the
[1:53:48] devil in every one of us trucks a lot of
[1:53:50] people says there's no devil it's just a
[1:53:52] thought don't you believe that there's a
[1:53:54] real devil he's just as real as you are
[1:53:56] or anybody a real devil and you must
[1:53:59] recognize him real you must know he's a
[1:54:01] devil then the same time that you
[1:54:03] recognize him and know that he's a devil
[1:54:05] that he's against you then to overcome
[1:54:07] him you must recognize that the God in
[1:54:09] you is greater than mighty than his that
[1:54:11] he that the one that's in you has
[1:54:14] already overcome him and by His grace
[1:54:16] you're more than a match for him amen
[1:54:19] there's real overcoming when you
[1:54:21] recognize you look back and say I'm
[1:54:23] doing this I'm doing that then no no no
[1:54:25] you're defeated but there's no
[1:54:27] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:54:28] Jesus that walk after the flesh but
[1:54:31] after the spirit then you realize that
[1:54:33] you have overcome
[1:54:35] and you and you know that that he's a
[1:54:37] devil you can't say I've got a sickness
[1:54:39] and I don't believe it's a sickness oh
[1:54:40] yes it's a sickness your cancer you
[1:54:43] don't believe it's a cancer it's a
[1:54:44] cancer it's a cancer but remember the
[1:54:46] greater is He that's in you than he
[1:54:48] that's in the world you must recognize
[1:54:50] that the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[1:54:52] already overcome the swing and he's in
[1:54:54] you and you can overcome by him
[1:54:56] that's exactly sensible that's exactly
[1:54:58] the way the scriptures written
[1:55:00] overcoming notice overcome the God
[1:55:03] that's in you is greater than the one
[1:55:04] that's in him the God of the world is
[1:55:07] not as great as the God of heaven which
[1:55:09] is at you know more than darkness can
[1:55:11] stand in the presence of light now
[1:55:12] darkness cannot stand in the presence of
[1:55:14] light I don't care how dark it is light
[1:55:16] will put it out I can't it can't stand
[1:55:19] glory but you take as much darkness as
[1:55:22] you want to and try and stand against
[1:55:23] light one time see what happened
[1:55:26] hallelujah and then but then of course
[1:55:30] we know Mary had to be there too so we
[1:55:34] can't we can't leave one of us under
[1:55:36] that gloom of the comfort of the devil
[1:55:39] you're all going to come out of that
[1:55:40] atmosphere hallelujah and then so and
[1:55:43] then so master goes back and calls her
[1:55:46] sister secretly saying the master has
[1:55:48] come and call the three he didn't give
[1:55:50] it a blanket call come Jersey you've
[1:55:52] come to come back come here no the
[1:55:53] Masters come and as soon as she heard
[1:55:56] that she rose quickly and came unto him
[1:56:00] hallelujah and then Jesus comes to the
[1:56:04] grave now here is here is the
[1:56:07] resurrection the life and he's about to
[1:56:09] show Mary and Martha what you lost I'm
[1:56:12] going to restore to you but now it's
[1:56:14] with a testimony now it's with the
[1:56:17] testimony because I wanted to show you
[1:56:19] Mary and Martha that what the devil took
[1:56:21] from you remember the devil you know
[1:56:23] death is Satan's device right so
[1:56:26] actually the devil stole their brother
[1:56:29] from them but now the Lord has one to
[1:56:31] show them what the devil is taken from
[1:56:33] you I'm going to restore it and you're
[1:56:36] gonna have now a testimony you're gonna
[1:56:38] have a victory dance and then because
[1:56:41] the devil took it but you weren't
[1:56:43] willing to stay in that state you call
[1:56:44] that to me and I delivered you
[1:56:47] even though it may have been what
[1:56:48] appears was four days late you may say
[1:56:51] well it's lingered a long time it's been
[1:56:53] a long season Jesus is never late
[1:56:55] Jesus is always right on time it's I
[1:56:59] have set in this house with these
[1:57:00] comforters a long time but Jesus is
[1:57:02] never late
[1:57:03] and now the Masters come the word has
[1:57:06] come and he call us for thee holy and I
[1:57:09] just I just get out of that depression I
[1:57:11] get out of that indifference I get out
[1:57:13] of the pain of my past or my regret or
[1:57:15] whatever it is I just get up and say
[1:57:17] Lord Jesus your word says forget the
[1:57:19] things which are in the past
[1:57:20] press under the mark of the high calling
[1:57:22] so just leave the past in the past it's
[1:57:24] under his blood you can't change it but
[1:57:26] he can you can fix it but he can parley
[1:57:31] and you can't make it right but he can
[1:57:33] hallelujah hallelujah can he not can he
[1:57:37] not fix it cannot make it hallelujah
[1:57:40] so now here they are and Jesus says
[1:57:43] where'd you lay him and then here comes
[1:57:46] here comes the juice worth because the
[1:57:48] devil always wants to wherever God is he
[1:57:50] just he's like pepper Otzi he just hangs
[1:57:52] around you know he shouldn't be paid for
[1:57:55] what he's done you know he's just here
[1:57:57] watching cuz he's got nothing to do
[1:57:58] anyway
[1:57:59] you know partner and then and then so
[1:58:00] now Jesus comes to the tomb and then
[1:58:04] Jesus weeps and then the juicy behold
[1:58:07] how he loved him see the devil wants us
[1:58:09] to be emotional he tries to want to keep
[1:58:11] us in an emotional realm you got to be
[1:58:14] real careful emotion can actually rob
[1:58:16] your faith because you can get so caught
[1:58:18] up in a most now anything with our
[1:58:20] emotion is did we understand they're
[1:58:21] right but they try and keep an emotional
[1:58:23] state and then now and then some of them
[1:58:26] said could not this man which open the
[1:58:28] eyes of the blind have caused that even
[1:58:30] this man should not have died so the
[1:58:33] comforters are coming with they're
[1:58:35] following where you going Martha I'm
[1:58:36] coming oh it's Jesus but couldn't you
[1:58:40] heal them he comes down right in the
[1:58:43] face of the resurrection amen
[1:58:46] and that's what happens among us the
[1:58:47] devil's right there doesn't mean you
[1:58:50] know to believe a mirror Martha were
[1:58:51] believers we're gonna meet them one day
[1:58:55] we're gonna meet Lazarus one day two
[1:58:58] hallelujah so now here they come here
[1:59:01] they come
[1:59:02] the comforters are right there but now
[1:59:05] Mary Martha I'm talking to them no more
[1:59:06] the devil say what he wants let him
[1:59:10] shoot his mouth off hook is but who are
[1:59:11] you listening to
[1:59:12] who are you listening - did those
[1:59:14] comforters help Mary and Martha has a
[1:59:16] devil that's robbed you helped you you
[1:59:19] know when he comes ease it's not for you
[1:59:21] you're too young you're too old you'll
[1:59:23] do something something excuse whatever
[1:59:25] place an excuse there you know you've
[1:59:28] got to actually say devil shut up who
[1:59:31] who who is my god Satan the spirit of
[1:59:35] suicide is not my God the spirit of
[1:59:37] pressure is not my god
[1:59:38] I meant pain hurt whatever you want to
[1:59:41] call it regret whatever it's not my god
[1:59:44] that's not the one that redeemed me so
[1:59:47] why should I pay attention to it
[1:59:49] you follow me why should I why should I
[1:59:52] give my ears to a voice of unbelief amen
[1:59:56] because the devil's gonna burn anyway
[1:59:58] I'm not going to the lake of fire
[2:00:01] that's not my Porsche it's his portion
[2:00:04] it's not mine that the lake of fire hell
[2:00:07] was craved for the devil and his angels
[2:00:09] not for me are you a devil or are you an
[2:00:12] angel
[2:00:13] that means it's not for you hallelujah
[2:00:16] so here comes the Lord where have you
[2:00:17] laid him he says no roll the stone away
[2:00:20] yeah he calls out with a loud voice and
[2:00:22] we know brother Brahim says he says if
[2:00:24] he hadn't called Lazarus by name there
[2:00:27] would have been a general resurrection
[2:00:28] so it cries out Lazarus come forth they
[2:00:32] roll the stone away may have got the
[2:00:35] those things mixed up at the beach but
[2:00:36] you know what I mean and then that what
[2:00:38] was dead now had life so what do you
[2:00:42] know he's calling joy come fall
[2:00:46] Hey come fall first love come fall
[2:00:51] hey come for my family come for
[2:00:56] overcoming power come fall hallelujah
[2:01:00] and what'd he do he restored it
[2:01:03] he says Lazarus and then he restore them
[2:01:05] back together and they went back and
[2:01:08] lived in the same house and the
[2:01:09] comforters were gone because now they
[2:01:12] had nothing to comfort about because the
[2:01:13] devil was defeated hallelujah
[2:01:16] does the same thing today friends you
