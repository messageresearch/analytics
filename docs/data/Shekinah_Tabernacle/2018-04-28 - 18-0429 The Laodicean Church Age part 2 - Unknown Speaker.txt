Jesus so just before we really get into service we've got a couple of I got a testimony and two specials today so you all just can take your seats I think we'll start off with a taste of money so we can just get ready for the special brother George felt they to just share a taste of money with us things it's more of a sharing testimony I mean he's a bit of a testimony as well but I just came back from Greece I was there for a month a week and for us Christians a trip the journey is a spiritual one more than a physical one and there was a lot of things I saw there and there was some nice things and bad things some successes and failures I just want to share though a few a couple of things my aunt is quite sick she's been sick quite a few years and I had a nice time with her Mike took her out for a coffee right before I left it was a nice sunny day she's a believing woman coming out from an orthodox background Greek Orthodox backgrounds and we talked about the Lord and one thing I and I showed her you know we're talking about the Lord all day where was she was very she was very happy although she was very sick she was very happy to talk about these things and at the end of the day I showed her some videos of our church and some singing and translated to her and one thing that really but this is what I wanted to share with everybody is how we are the Bride of Christ and this is the highest relationship we can have with God and how this relationship is hidden to the world and to the denominations this relationship is very very special than in these last days like in Revelation it is it is their relationship that is most Jesus is portrayed as our husband and these last days it's especially it was always true but this in the last days is you know it's the time of the bride and that that relationship that that he records with my aunt and I think she you know there was attached there and it feels like the dawn breaking where you can't see the Sun you see the light but you can't see the Sun and you know there's failure there's a phase difference you know there's Donuts breaking at different times around the world you know and you know donees breaking at different parts of the world different times and although you can't see the Sun you see the lights and you know that it's coming and I just want to encourage everybody in that and and there's also another thought well maybe I just link it up to the if it's the thought of something else we see self justification you know a lot of people it's easy to get so self justified and it's only God who justifies it's easy to say you know I'm right I'm wrong or you know he's wrong all this but it's only God who justifies and it's only God who shows us who's right and who's wrong and I just wanna this is just a couple of things I wanted to share in my journey thank you Thank You Bret George Lord is good and he's faithful and he's wonderful baby can you put up the words for us for that completely

to the book of Hosea again the opening scripture and then we're going to go to you were just read here Hosea 6 and verse 1 down to verse 6 see if I can drive this let me okay good now Hosea 6 and 1 come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the letter and former rain unto the earth IV frame what shall I do unto the Oh Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as an early jerk go away therefore I have here and them by the prophets I've slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as light that goeth forth for I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings I mean let's just about he's in a word of Prayer and if you'd like to be a member to pray just want to raise your hands to the Lord gracious father we see Lord you see the hands that are raised Lord both my hands are raised father just ask us we Lord we've read your Scripture Lord and we know that anyone who can read can read your Bible but Lord you are the author of your word and we know your Bible is not a textbook Lord it's a love letter that's been Lord given to us Lord to reveal you and so lord I just pray father as we look into your word now father may he just anoint it Lord anoint speaker in here one more time father may Lord may you speak to every heart Lord draw us all closer to you father may we feel your presence among us and Lord we just ask you to be with those who are away Lord be their portion

Lord and father just us you take complete control over this service Lord in Jesus Christ they may you Lord have your Lord receive all honor glory and praise in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to continue on what I was speaking on on Wednesday where I where we're going to go into not in just one service but I want to go into all the scripture that God has fulfilled in this endless day we can someone just turn the air con down a bit I know it's all but woman here I don't know don't want anyone to fall asleep on me maybe open the door thank you brother hey I'm so we read here in Hosea 6 where there was a prophecy that we're where goddess yo speaking and he's speaking of her people that he says come let us return unto the Lord and he 'the torn he will heal us he is smitten ax spinning and he will bind us up now after three days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now from the from the scripture if you read in in the in Peters epistles Peter says that one day with God as as a thousand years upon the earth so when when this was written Hosea was writing this speaking about the Jews where where they they will be scattered bases and the third day they will return unto their inheritance they'll return to the promised land and they will live in God's sight now this was written in BC well according to my Bible chronological order your the times it says that this was written in BC 780 so this was written in you say over 2,000 years ago this this prophecy was written and it says in the third day we shall return and live and live in God's sight so if we we can see that the scripture has been fulfilled as rules being called and in our nation seventy years upon the earth for the first time in over two-and-a-half thousand years there are a nation once again and so so now Israel's been gathered and the reason Israel's been gathering is because in this end time people have been gathered we all been gathered to a place you know as as Jesus said now the harvest has come in this season where where the tares are bound for the burning but the wheat is gathered into the garner you know so we'll began that all of us will be gathered to a place right will be either gathered into Christ or be gathered you know with the world systems that will be burnt in the tribulation this is this is a harvest going on and so there's a gathering in this end time and so I just want to go into these things because we live in the most wonderful time to be alive you know we don't need to be afraid of nuclear war or whatever may be coming upon the earth all those things may happen but we have a promise in the scripture that before the first nuclear bomb drops I mean the bride will be raptured into glory hallelujah so we're so glad we have that opportunity to become one with him that he will take us off the earth now if we go to I just want to go to revelations if you want to read with me in revelations chapter one I'm just kind of continuing on trying to lay a foundation and I wanted to try and take thoughts because there's lots of things happen in the sages lots of Scripture being fulfilled so Jesus last few moments if you look at all the prophecies Jesus from from being betrayed in the garden or even at the last last supper to when he was crucified and he rose again he he fulfilled many many prophecies just in those last few hours of his life was very rapid scripture being fulfilled and so because many times people say well these things are afar off you know maybe you know it'll be maybe in the next generation that you know the rapture will happen and enough that the tribulation but the scripture can be fulfilled very quickly very rapidly and I just want to bring to light as we go through this series that all the scripture that God is fulfilling in our day you know we are living in Bible days this is not a just a book of history and the a book of the future but God is fulfilling his word today and your generation scripture is being fulfilled a means I want to go through these things that we would see the day an hour in which we live because we understand this is a road map this is a map from from earth to glory right but the thing is with a map if you don't know where you are in the map how do you know how to get to your destination like if I wanted to drive to say I've no Drive to Auckland and I've never driven there before and I have a map in front of me I can see Auckland on the map but I don't know where I am how do I know where to begin my journey because I can guess maybe I'm well maybe I'm in Wellington maybe I'm in New Plymouth maybe I'm an Guzman I don't know and then now I've got to turn left and turn right but I'll end up lost because I don't know where I am but if you as soon as you know where you are then you know how far you have to journey that's the same thing in the Bible we're going to find out where we are and when we find out where we are then we can know where we're going to journey to amen so we've got a so that's why it's so wonderful in the state we're not wandering in darkness God has revealed his word to us that we know where we are hallelujah our revelations 1 and and 3 so it says so I just want to take a few thoughts out of out of this first chapter just as we go through so the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent it and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things that are written thereon for the time is at hand now the first thing I want to just take out this is this is a book of the book of Revelation in the book of prophecy and it's also a book of symbols so and we'll read it later but because Jesus instructs John what you see right in a book and seen to the seven churches and so it's a book of prophecy you read it in the last chapter of Revelations God says if you add or take away from this prophecy your name will be taken out of the book of life so it's a book of prophecy it's prophesying the future events and John he what he saw he wrote down so when he saw a white horse rider write forth with a you know with the bow no arrows and was given a crown that's what he saw and he wrote it down but it's all symbolic and it the the symbols have a meaning just like the Book of Daniel meaning of Daniels you know dreams and visions that he had was symbolic like Nebuchadnezzar's Imogen and and the four beasts and different things he saw that was symbolic but they are interpreted okay so it's the same thing with the book of Revelation so what so he's commanded now this is a book of prophecy and then and then I just want to drop down because I'm not going to read the whole chapter he is I John am also also am your brother and companion in the tribulation and the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ who was on the Isle called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what they'll see us see what you see write down what you see us write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia and to Ephesus under Smyrna unto Pergamos unto Thyatira and decide us unto Philadelphia and unto Lady hacia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and good about the paps with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire now we're going to see what this means because it's interpreted he says and his feet were like fine brass as if they burned in a furnace his voice of the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword as countenance was as the Sun shines and his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou have seen anything which are and the things which shall be Hereafter the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou source in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches now I just want to I just want to break down a part of the sky I want to show that God has been working from you know because we read the Bible and we read you know the Gospels Jesus ministered in the book of Acts the same Jesus down now on his now in his church working and then we read the epistles and then we read maybe the book of Revelation and we wonder what's been going on from because we're in 2018 it's been 2,000 years from when when the Bible was you could say written and now we're 2,000 years down the road so what's been going on you know because many people God just you know many people think well after after the book of Acts or after Paul's ministry God kind of just crossed his arms and just sat back and watch the world go by as as the church was trying to you know spread the gospel and things but God has been fulfilling his word all the way down through two thousand years it's been prophecy that's been fulfilled God God has been working in the lives of people from from the book of Acts down to today God is not an impersonal God God has been interested in the in the affairs and lives of men and women he's interested in you today he's not some distant god that says well maybe they'll make it maybe they won't let's find out he knows the end from the beginning he's interested in your life he's in the details of your life he cares about you he's interested in you right and so now we read here that that it's already been interpreted so the seven stars are in his hand now all this is symbolic but the seven stars in his hand are the seven angels to the seven churches and the seven golden candlesticks which I saw are the seven churches now there's been seven so so the seven stars are the angels to the seven churches now if you go look at the definition of the word angel so when we read it in English we think of a heavenly being with wings when we normally think of an angel you think of a heavenly being with wings but that's not always the case in a Bible because in the Bible the word angel means a messenger the angel means you know the word angel means a messenger and if you go look at the scriptures the Angels never preach the gospel to the people so if God sends an angel to a church he's not going to send a heavenly angel to preach the gospel because that's not God's program God uses man to preachers gospel he could have had the wind preach the gospel or the trees or or or heavenly beings but he chose man to work through for his plan of redemption and so you can see this annex and in Acts chapter 10 I don't have it on the PowerPoint you go read Acts chapter 10 there's Cornelius at Gentile and he's praying and he knows only the god of the Old Testament and an angel appears before him and says that your arms and your prayers have come up before God and he instruct he doesn't preach for this is after the cross this is after the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost has been given but this angel tells him go find Peter and he will tell you the words of eternal life the angel could have told them but it wasn't the angels job God works through his body right so so so Cornelius said for to sent two men to go get Peter and Joppa wherever it was he came back to Cornelius house and they had a meeting and it says well yet Peter spake these words of what God was doing in there down our the Holy Ghost fell upon them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost the same as they were on the day of Pentecost so God works through men right so these seven stars are seven ministry seven messengers to the seven churches okay and even Paul says in Galatians 4 and 13 and 14 he says you know that through the infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first and my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not neither rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus so they received Paul as a angel of messenger right so there's been seven messengers down through the church ages now I have to background all this because not only is God been working Satan has been working when the Holy Ghost felled the Antichrist spirit fell John says that the Antichrist spirits come already into the world right so the over darkness all everything the enemy's been doing down through two thousand years and all that God has been doing has now built up into this last H Alou you I'm glad that we're not just fighting this battle alone it's more for stand against us I mean all of heaven is behind us believers hallelujah now this is a diagram and this is from the seven churches book where I don't know if you can quite so it's a bit small but now these seven churches that we read about they were prophetic the condition in those churches was prophetic speaking of future ages right because many people say well it was just for those churches in Asia therefore this doesn't apply to us but it applies to us it's a prophecy okay and you can go through history and we're not going to do it today but you can go through history and you can see when you read revelations two and three what God is describing in each church you can see it repeated in history right and so now there was a star there was a messenger to each period of time from Calvary to doubt now Paul was the messenger to the first stage well he wrote most of the New Testament he he placed Lauren Grace correctly so he was the ministry that that was the light to the to the first church okay and then on down through some of these people maybe you're not very familiar with Iranians of Martin and Columba then we have so now this is the this period as the iron age or the Dark Ages and that's what it's called in history it's the Dark Ages the Catholic Church basically ruled the world they they had all the gospel you know the Bible's away people weren't even allowed to look at him you know even open the page of the Bible and read it because and they had absolute control but God had not finished because God God knew this would happen he knew that the church would would would buy it by an antichrist burnovich they'd go down and persecution go down in the ground of the Dark Ages he says I shall restore saith the Lord and so now Martin Luther even before him hundred years before him a man was he was a man called John HUS or maybe I should go back Columbo here was the messenger to the cages now history tells us and but there's a rule of thumb which I should actually say here now this is how the messengers were chosen he sees it so at the time of the giving of Revelation ad 94 Paul had already died but according to tradition Paul literally died a minor but John was carrying on and see it exactly as Paul had done in the days of his ministry the death of Paul before the revelation was given does not at all annul the fact that he was the messenger to the ephesian church age for the messenger to every age regardless of when he appears or ghost as the one who influences that age for God by means of a word manifested ministry Paul was that man so Paul had signs and wonders Paul pointed people that Jesus Christ not to an organization Paul's burden was that man would not have a relationship with the church a system he that was this burden he didn't want people to have a relationship with a system that's what people that's what people think in these days they think if you have if you're part of a church system therefore you go to heaven and go overlook anything that's wrong that's not what God wants God wants you to have relationship with him he wants you never relationship with Jesus Christ in his word not just being part of a you're a church system right so so he he had signs and wonders see so God men have backed up what Paul said and he was preaching according to the seasons he rose in and he and he joined the people to Jesus Christ and if you take that you take that pattern and you take it through history the one closest to that pattern is the messenger right so Paul had already died before the Ephesian Age started and Columba had already died before the thought Iron Age started but the reason I was saying that as church history says that Columba founded a Bible School up and up in Scotland and it says that for the next nine hundred years after that Bible School was founded by Columba the vast majority the evangelical Christian work came out of that Bible school so he affected the dark ages amen for the Lord okay and and in that ministry then they'd influence a man called called called white cliff who knows their Bible history and so he had a burden he just wanted the people to have the word in their language so was in Latin but he wanted it in English and so so he had that burden and then his and then what happened is now but his influence then was taken to a place called Bohemia where it influenced a years later a man called John HUS and John HUS wanted the same thing he had a burn he wanted thee he wanted the Bible instead of being sealed away in Latin he wanted in the common people's language and but he was burned at the stake by the Catholic Church but he said in a hundred years a man will stand up with the same belief and you will not destroy him and a hundred years later Martin Luther came on the scene and the Reformation was on hallelujah so and so Lucy even though Luther was the one who influenced that age the most and in John Wesley after that he heard a commentary that Luther wrote on the book of Romans and his heart was warmed something happened to him and he had a real salvation experience he came out of the Anglican Church he didn't want to start a new church but they kicked them out and he preached an open field with with George Whitfield and different ones and the people came out of darkness and they received a light for their day so he influenced that age the most Alleluia is the starts of the age amen and then said now but now we live in this lady or C&H we live in the last church age and this started this age came in with a with a desire of the people that the gifts of the Spirit would be restored who's read about the Azusa Street revival the Pentecostal movement was birthed you know there and there were small outpourings before that but this was the major one and people went out from there and the world has been changed since then Amen but that's not the full part of the restoration because if we read our let's go to now is that clear for everyone class are you're following me we're having a bit of a teaching today if that's all right but there's a there's a start to an age and he brings the light to the age right just like you know and so but that's why these people they fought an antichrist spirit and that Antichrist spirit is still moving in this in this end time right so just as God member there's more for us than against us that's why we should always rejoice when the Bible says greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world so it doesn't matter how dark the world looks like it's getting and how bad things may be greater is He that is in me then it is in the world hallelujah now let's just go so not only now not only has God because so not only has God been reflecting himself through ministries to the earth Satan has been doing the same thing now let's go to revelations 6 and 1 we're just going to go through I just want to lay a background because all darkness is here all light is here hallelujah all that heaviness is upon the earth amen I'm so glad we're not alone in this I just want to just be happy for a little bit you know if God is for us who can be against us hallelujah so we don't need to be worried now now as we were in Revelation chapter one it was a prophecy and it was symbols what you see right in a book and there's a book of prophecy right so now we're just changing the scene a bit and now so what we're going to read here it's all symbolic and so it says now and when I saw the lamb opened one of the seals I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now this so this first so horse a beast and the Bible like this represents a power riding yeah power moving forth and so now this horse doubt let's just this is breakdown because many people in the church world think that this is the Holy Ghost riding forth in the first age to go to conquer and you know these things but we'll find out that this is not the this is not the Spirit of God riding forth but this is deception this is an antichrist spirit moving forth and and I'll show this to you so let's just look at these symbols so he had a white horse right which appears in the Bible normally that means a purity but we'll see that it's actually a deception and he and him that said on him had a bow doesn't say anything about arrows but just a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now if you go read revelations chapter 19 let's just go read there quickly because I want to show you that is - there's two riders on white horses but they're very different they're not the same one says go to revelations 19 and 11 now just I'll just leave this up so you had to keep it in mind a bow no arrows he said on a white horse and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering if we read in Revelation 19:11 it says here and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse all maybe this is the same one let's find out and he that sat on him was called faithful and true this one we read about wasn't given a name yet okay this one's called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war and his eyes were as a flame of fire we read about that in revelations chapter 1 and I was hid were many crowns not just a crown many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God and armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nation's and he should rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God and he hath on his vesture on a thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords now this one has many crowns he's called faithful and true amen he's called the Word of God he is a sharp two-edged sword that comes out of his mouth he doesn't have a bow this is two different riders amen 1 1 1 is deception riding forth with a bow and then he was crowned and then the other one had a sharp two-edged it's all coming out of his mouth he's called the Word of God he's faithful and true and as vicious dipped in blood so the second one we read about this is Jesus Christ writing for write the first one is the Antichrist spirit trying to appear like the Holy Ghost riding forth as a deception ok and also I want to but I want to show you just quickly as well that what we read here these two verses they cover a space of time because if you look at church history now it sees a crown was given unto him so he went forth he went forth with a with a bow he had a bow so he comes a deception but then finally that deception was crowned and if you go look at church history when the Pope was crowned a crown was given to the first boat that's when this spirit was crowned because you can't crown a spirit you got a crown a person ok and so now there's a space of time where where the Holy Ghost comes in the book of Acts the same time the Antichrist spirit comes and these two now are in the fighting within the church trying to get preeminence it's the same thing today friends Alleluia that's why we've got to withstand the Antichrist spirit we're to stand upon the Word of God amen and then finally this Antichrist was crown when the when the when the first Pope was crowned so he went forth to conquer it so this is the Antichrist riding forth okay and you see that in church history and then after that we go to the next one and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that he set thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword this is the same rider this is the same Antichrist prayer but changing his minister but there's still a deception following with it as well and you go and and you can see it in church history that finally after this antichrist spirit was crowned in in the state was now behind the church now they had a now they had an army now they could enforce upon the people you know recant or die recant or burn so he had a sword they used it he killed millions with that sword amen he killed millions with that sword and you can even see well you know and we all know that about you and church history so these things have already happened amen so now and so this was the Dark Ages oh it will follow in class okay just you know fall asleep or do something if you say I don't know okay and then an inn so the next power that rides forth and this is I'm just touching all the highlights today of these two things because I want to lay background for maybe so for next Sunday and so and when he had opened the third seal so the lamb opens the seals I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine so there comes a time now with thee where the Catholic Church is now you have to pay in order to get out of purgatory or get out of you know you know in order to get to heaven fast and so they start charging they start charging for salvation and this was the age where Martin Luther stood up and said this is wrong why should people pay for sins they're about to do you want no vania so no this is this was state-sponsored because they want to build a bigger yo Cathedral Basilica and you're on Rome this is why they had these schemes and so so the Antichrist power is riding forth and the biggest to try and charge for salvation but then there so this is now this is now in the time of the Reformation and I've got a diagram to show all this but I just want to go through these scriptures but then finally it comes now the last move of the Antichrist and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat thereon was death so now finally this riders called he's called death this is this Antichrist spirit this religious spirit riding forth now he's called death he's been called a name and hell followed with him and the power was given given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword just like that red horse rider had a sword to kill and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth now this one said on a pale horse and it's a mixture of the of the white red and the black you mix together you get a you're a funny kind of pale mixed color so all the powers that were riding before that now have come together and this is the devil riding forth because his name is called death now but I want to point out something as I said about the first seal it covers a space of time the Antichrist Burt wasn't crowned as soon as it turned up there's a few hundred years later then it was crowned so now this powers riding forth but then when the rider actually sits upon this eponymous power this is when the bride goes up okay but it's all the mixture of all the evil of the of the first three ages has come together in the fourth and this is this is what we're up against in this age the fear not little flock at your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom Alleluia now I just want you to notice here every time that a seal is open there's a boy these are beasts it's got the first one and when I saw the lamb opened one of the seals I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see okay and then we go to verse three and we end it open the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and in the and in the third one when I and we need open the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and then now in the in the fourth seal when I heard the and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see so the so there's another beasts saying come and see come and see come and see this come and see this so now well who is that now this is what we're gonna go to go on to now so if we go back in revelations chapter 4 we're gonna find out what these beasts are now these fourth now these four beasts you read about they're anointings that God seems upon the earth to combat what the enemy is doing that's why when the enemy comes in like a flood that said the Lord will raise up a standard so we don't need to worry amen as I see it there's more forest and against us God spurred us always here to combat the move of the enemy hallelujah that he would show his greatness now revelations 4 he says and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts who were full of eyes before him behind and the first piece was like unto a lion the second beast was like unto a calf the third beast like a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle now we read there the when the lamb opened the you know when the lamb opened the first seal there was a noise of thunder and I heard the first piece say come and see so this is now God spirit coming it's the Holy Ghost in a in a in a different manifestation or you could say a different way to combat what the enemy is doing so now so now when the Antichrist was riding forth in the first stage God said a line anointing upon the church to combat that deception now that's the word that's the anointing of the of the true word to combat what the enemy is doing that's why Paul could stand he says he says I fought the beast at Ephesus who's read the other scriptures I fought the beast at Ephesus and that wasn't him in an arena fighting Lions and Ephesus that was demon pals within the church that he fought and withstood and you can see it in in annex chapter 15 where where you go X chapter 2 the other day of Pentecost the people all fully birthed into the kingdom but then when you come into about X 15 there's now people coming among the believers and they're trying to get the Gentiles to become Jews before they became become Christians so now people weren't fully converted but yet religious had come in among the people and we're trying to drag them back to something that God had done away with so that Antichrist Burt was already working among them and Paul even said after my departure grievious wolves from among yourselves will rise up and Rin the flock so that was already sitting there it was already sitting there and he said after my departure will raise up among you and he was talking to them and some of those were the ones who would rise up and rend the flock because it was a religious Antichrist spirit working among them Amen this is a battle phrase we don't fight against flesh and blood amen but you know we don't need to be worried about these things that's why you're gonna be fully born into the kingdom can't just become a religious person I mean because a religious person God's not interested in religion he wants a relationship he wants to be united with you that's what that's what he wants he doesn't want us to go through some form of a life you know just a religion he wants to become one with us that's why he died on Calvary when I could not go to where he was he came to me hallelujah and he did that on Calvary to shed his blood to wash away my sins change my nature that he could come aspera could come and dwell in me hallelujah that was the purpose of us of a sacrifice now so the first beast was a lion that was that anointing went forth but when the Antichrist changes moved that we went from a white horse a deception to now a red horse with a sword he could kill now the the Holy Ghost changed its anointing to be like a calf and that's a a calf as a animal of sacrifice your research history you see people they rejoiced when they were being tortured they rejoiced when they went to the stake they rejoiced when their heads are going to be cut off I mean and it wasn't that's not normal that's not normal so I'm going to die today hallelujah no it was an anointing upon the church that they could withstand and overcome in their age that even though they were burned and they were sawn asunder and ripped and killed and whatever will happen to them tortured they they were pointed and they're anointing cause them to overcome that they would not recant we cannot turn back we cannot give up our Lord Jesus you're gonna have to burn me whatever you need to do I can't say no I can't join your religion I've got to stay with the truth and they gladly gave their lives why because they are anointed with a calf anointing and ox anointing hallelujah and I love it because if you look at it I believe it can only live according to the anointing that's upon them I mean they can't do anything else so they they just gladly gave their lives and now the fort now the third beast had the face as a man now a man has intelligence and you go you're read there you take Wyclif he was in the universities John Huss was a very learned man William Tyndale who was the first one to really translate the Bible after Wycliffe you know into English very smart people you knew multiple languages you know and so God and Martin Luther all your all the Reformers down the same very intelligent because they had a man's intelligence God sent an intelligence upon the church that they could take the wood and translate it and release it to the people Alleluia it was combating what the enemy was doing Alleluia but now we see that at this fourth beast now I just want to go back now in all of them I want to point this out here so let's read the fourth one we'll go backwards so when he'd opened the third fourth seal I heard the voice of the forced fourth beast say come and see the voice of the fourth beast say come and see but in the others I heard the I heard the third beast say there's no I heard the voice so these are codes is that there's a differentiation here I want you to notice this the third piece Seco say come and see the second beast say come and see the first beast say come and see but then in the fourth it says I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see so now there's a voice coming forth to tell you what these things are and it's only under this seal that the rider is named and the power coming with them as shown and fully exposed for what it is amen and that's why we're not probing that's why there's a prophetic ministry has come in this day that we're not probing is this God as a Satan or what is this but God has sent a voice in this day that we know exactly what the enemy is doing hallelujah and you take the fourth beast there was the flying eagle now all those other animals are earthbound a lion is earthbound a ox is earthbound a man is earthbound but an eagle is a flying eagle that can fly above now if you look at this you know it's like if we were anywhere if we can just fly a little bit higher if we get lift up then you can really see the terrain you and just say you're lost in the bush and you just see hills and mountains and trees you maybe get lost where am I but if you just get lifted up above the terrain then you can see where you need to go and how you need to get out but if your earthbound you can't see the same as something in the sky right it's like an eagle flies high up in the sky it can see far-off but a lion or a man or an ox they just see maybe this they can't see very far off so now the anointing that is upon the church in this day is an eagle anointing I mean that we can see from eternity to eternity amen we can see what the enemy is doing we can see what God is doing Alleluia and if you can see what your enemy is doing you can evade them hallelujah you can fly what you're if he's just working on the ground you can you can fly up hallelujah and this and there's some Eagles I've seen you have seen prick see some Eagles actually eat snakes it's the Serpent's on the ground but they don't come and fight these ship and on the ground they pick them up and they fly up into the sky because of the snake if it doesn't have anything to work with it can't move only yeah that's where you see like the Crocker a hundred different ones they pick up a snake by its tail and it just hangs there can't get them carrying it because it's got nothing to work against it's like Eagle they you know the others an eagle takes the who seen the photo who seen that amen sir you think it doesn't come down and fight the snake and his ground he takes him up into heavenly places hallelujah where the snake can't move he just kills them in there they will just eat this devil and okay amen so now we're anointed that's why we are not you know pulses we're not ignorant to the devil's devices amen we're not ignorant to what he's doing because his voices come hallelujah to say come and see and I'll show you this is the devil riding forth this is the powers of Hell coming with them early and we're anointed with a flying eagle anointing this is the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost all the way through just anointing the people in a different way to combat what the enemy is doing amen so now this is the anointing that's upon us now let's just show you a picture and then um can we see it not too well sorry I couldn't make a bigger but I'll I'll make a better picture one I just grabbed this off the internet from how it ties in but now down here are the seven churches and then we've got the Tribulation Period and then the Millennium okay now this is the four first four seals we read about and this the first four seals are the working of the Antichrist spirit upon the earth okay and now the reason why there's Ephesus Smyrna you know the you know the church ages are lumped together like this it's because it's showing what the enemy is doing in each of those ages now we live in a lady of sea and age we live in the seventh church age now maybe let's just read that scripture no actually I'll explain this and I'll show you why I can say that okay so so this is the enemy so the first seals the Whitehorse the you know the deception then God sends a lion anointing of us Holy Ghost to combat it and then there's the Ox anointing to combat what the enemy is doing it in this third seal the other man anointing to combat the black horse rider but now on this and this lady I've seen aged now everything that's been in the first ages is now mixed in come together into this age but in this age there's many things that are going on it's not just so in this age as I said the very beginning Israel's comeback as a nation and you can read that in Matthew chapter 24 when the fig tree foots poor puts forth its buds you know summer is naive and at the door and a fig tree in the Bible that represents Israel it's when it comes to be a nation again you know that summer's night or the millennium is nigh and Jesus says this generation that sees this shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled and they've been a nation seventy years so the generation of people that see the fig tree become a nation you know you know the fig tree blossom forth again that generation won't pass - all these things are done and they've been a nation seventy years we're at the end Alleluia that's going home time that's why I find everyone you can say there's a better way of life you don't have to be a slave to the world or some religion you can become one with Jesus Christ have joyous people full of glory he'll be your comforter he'll be your guide he'll be your husband he'll take care of you he'll guide you he'll love you he'll reveal himself to you wholly he'll do all those things and more I mean that's why we should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that seasoned Jude for that faith that was given I mean in that faith was a union with Jesus Christ I mean they were not bad down under man's ideas and man's teachings and and and what we think if we can do you know our ability we're not worried about those things he did it all Alleluia amen and if he made it I'm going to make it if he ever come I'll overcome I mean if he's victorious I'm victorious because I'm under pending upon him hallelujah so now so now here we are in this last H and then after this we have the Tribulation Period in the Millennium now but we'll go on to the fifth sixth and seventh seal later but those some people when they read this they think this is all chronological because the first four are but the fifth sixth and seventh they overlap but there's no for today now let's read revelations three because I said each of these leaders to the seven churches are prophetic speak and the condition that is in those churches that that God's writing about they're speaking of future but have I said we're in the seventh the first six already done it's a revelations three 14 and 17 he says and unto the angel or the messenger of the church the lady o sins write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou wert cold cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth all these things they have meaning but we won't go into it just now because thou sayeth I am rich now this is the confession of the church today because they'll say as I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not so what let's just stop there this is the confession of the church world I was in the first time I ever saw my appearance as many of you know they used to live in Papua New Guinea third world country the first time we ever went to a church over there they were reading this scripture and now saying look we are rich and increased with Goods and from a Western eyes you would look at them with you know yo some villagers don't have power they don't have running water you know they live in what we would call shacks they have virtually nothing in our eyes but in their eyes compared to what they used to be they are rich increased with Goods because they have said they have go back even 20 years what they have now they never had about 20 years ago there and they say well look we're rich increased with Goods and so everywhere upon the earth comparable to where they used to be everyone as rich increased with goods that was their confession it wasn't mine amen now knowest and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked this is God's diagnosis of this age I cancelled Eid to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent as many as i love do anyway behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and that's how every leader finishes to him the heaven ear let him hear what the Spirit is saying amen so now we are rich increase with Goods this world is rich and crazy-good and this world's a he is saying I don't need anything and I could say this is even a far greater picture of this Western world man doesn't need anything but we have our healthcare we have our you know the state will look after us if we lose everything you know we have we have cars we have homes where food you know we have everything we need rich have need of nothing and so man thinks they don't need God but there always comes to a point in every life where the doctor says we can't do anything more unfortunately because medicine comes to an end and then what and then what's going to take you the rest of the way I mean that's why I'd rather know God now then maybe a deathbed confession I mean so now people say I've needed nothing now I want you to notice here he sees in but God's diagnosis as this world has Richard Miz rule naked blind and don't know it spiritually and then he calls him now as many as so but I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the that thou mayest be rich spiritually rich he's talking about he's not talking about natural gold here there's a deity golden the Bob where was his deity they mean it's a character that is molded and shaped in trial come and get it off me because God is looking for character this world is a characterless stage amen we're men aren't men and women aren't woman anymore everyone have a moral back backbone you know the vast majority right and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed spiritually clothed that they shame of thy nakedness do not appear in North iron eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see on your glad you can see on young lady's got I serve in his word amen and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repeat so this is now this verse next is being now the people he loves I mean many times they say well God loves me but he's got to love you you know I trust this is your so this so in this verse he does love us for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son but this verse says he's speaking of the object of his love and that's why he can say how do you know your love because his word comes in Crixus you know when you're doing wrong and there's something and you say you shouldn't do that the Bible says this you know God the Holy Spirit deals with you you know you know that when you you know that's God correcting because it you know you know to be chasing it's not just a not just a beating or whatever it's actually with correction and mine hallelujah so just as long as I'm his child he'll keep correcting me thank the Lord maybe they'll be zealous therefore and repent now we cover there comes a time here it says behold I stand at the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me now many people take this scripture this is part of the same time many people take the scripture and they say this is Jesus knocking at the door of your heart he wants you to open your heart to him now in a sense that is true but this verse actually speaking out Jesus is on the outside of his church he's been kicked out he's been kicked out of the church he was once working among the church but now they took creeds and dogmas above the Word of God and he's kicked out so he's trying to get back in let me back into my church let me in but he's saying now but he's so standing at the door knocking and If any man hear my voice Amen you got to hear the voice of God that's what this message is the voice of God to this age hello and they say you open the door and he'll come into you and you heels up with you and he and and you with him now so let's just let's just one this up a little bit now listen so so what's what's mean to happen in this in this age now this there's to be a restoration of all things as as as Jesus says in Matthew 17 Elisha shall come and restore all things there'll be a ministry with the anointing of Elijah to restore all things so Israel it'll be a gathering of Israel for them to receive the Messiah we know from the you know from the Bible that Israel still has a space of three-and-a-half years where grace goes back to Israel where God was working with the Gentiles now he goes back and deals with the Jews again Alleluia amen so now so there's a gathering of Israel for them to receive their Messiah and that's why Israel's a nation again because God always deals with the Jews when they're back in their homeland so they have been gathered that their Messiah would would would become known to them but before the Messiah becomes known to them the bride has taken up into glory amen and so now and so there has to be again so they've been gathered there's 144,000 he lectures that will receive the same Jesus Christ we know amen so so Israel's been gathered now they'll also be the opening of the bottomless pit if you read revelations chapter 9 right okay and then there'll be a binding as well of the tears and a gathering of the wheat and they'll also be the revealing of the Son of Man and Luke 17 30 says in the days of Noah and lot so shall it be when the Son of Man is revealed so the Ministry of Jesus Christ will repeat again and it's also an age of adoption where people come to their place in Christ amen where are people we know adoption in the Bible it's not it is it does not say going to China getting a baby you know and then now they're part of your family but adoption in the Bible is the placing of a child into the family so they've bought into the family already and then they come to a place of maturity where they're placed in the family I mean that that how they conduct the business is how the father would conduct the business so it's the placing of a placing of a son or daughter in a position of power and authority this is an adoption age I mean we're living the time of adoption where God is taking his bride lifting her up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus I mean because we're called to be joint heirs with him everything here is we fall we fall heir to you know God doesn't want us to be subservient to him amen we are joint we are joint equal with them because of what he has done for us amen now and then also as we just read Christ being rejected by the church knocking the church world knocking trying to get back in this has to happen and also the manifestation of the seal of God and the mark of the beast that will be fully manifested in this hour because those who are sealed with the seal of God will go on a rapture amen and there'll be those here who don't have the seal but they will stand for God and the Great Tribulation they'll give their lives we know that Amen but it also will be the manifestation of the mark of the beast will be in this hour and there will also be the rapture of the church amen and so and then also there'll be the image of the beast will be erected which it already has so that will happen as well a mint and you know so all these things have to be manifested in this day and the whole reason that all this goes on is because God is gathering amen he's gathering and the gospel has to be restored the restoration of all things and thus Gosselaar us we preached at the end of the world and then the end will come and that is happening amen so many of these things virtually all these things already already in manifestation hallelujah we're right at the end of all things there's a lot of a lot of things going on in this age and even though it is the darkest of all ages it is the most light amen we know stumbling in darkness with children of the day with children of light that's why we don't need to be worried what the enemy is doing Amen because if he's your Shepherd he'll lead you and he doesn't lose a lose one amen and if you wander off the trail he'll come and get you hallelujah I mean so this is this is where we are I mean can we have had the musicians please I'll just leave it there because I want to give it's like a very rough overview and then we're going to go we're going to start going chronologically through everything that you would see that God is there's so much scripture being fulfilled in the state and the whole reason that's being done now the reason I want to do this series is not that all I know some things but I want you to want you to know that God is dealing in the lives of men and he is finding his so he's so he's uniting you know the world systems that uniting the church world is uniting amen and the bride is uniting with Jesus Christ is all this uniting going on and I want you to see all these things that you would appreciate more thank you Lord you called me out thank you Lord you became real to me thank you Lord you saved my soul thank you Lord you've washed me clean thank you Lord you've made me a new creature thank you lord you've held off the darkness I mean that I would walk with you there's one of my growth excites I want it to be
