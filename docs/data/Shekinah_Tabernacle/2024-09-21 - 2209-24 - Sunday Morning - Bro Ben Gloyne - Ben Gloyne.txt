========================================

[Music] good morning welcome to the house of God um this morning it's good to be here it's good to be uh warm and dry if I um I think apart from the example of the flood I think rain is always a sign of God's blessing you know Elijah he said it won't rain there' be no rain in the land till I call for it and when there was no rain there was there were big troubles in the land but maybe the first year they were okay cuz they had supplies of different things and they had Wells that they could draw water from and they still had the streams that flowed from the snow that was melting in the spring and the summer but you know as the drought went on year after year the second year got a little bit harder it was less less water in the reservoirs there were there were there was less rain uh less water in the creeks and in the rivers you know and and life got harder and harder you know and by the third year it was getting really hard cuz they couldn't now grow the C the crops they needed and things you know and it's the same in a and and anyone that that you know you know when when people live their life without the spirit of God you know it just gets drier and drier and dryer till it's not possible to live anymore under that condition but we're grateful today that like the rain that's falling on us now the we're living in a time of Latter rain and and and the spirit of God is falling upon us and it's going to continue to fall Upon Our Hearts and and make our land the land of our life make it fruitful you know even though there may be a drought all around we've got our our we're planted by the rivers of Living Water you know we we've got the we're we're refreshed daily by the spirit of God so that's that's going to be our portion this morning we're going to be refreshed this morning there's going to be we're going to be like uh we're not going to be like dry sticklers who's been to Tucson ARS owner I went there uh Shannon's from there so we went there to visit her family and um back then I was a young fellow I thought I was a real Bush man so I used to go into the desert and and live off the land so I decided to eat what they call a prickly pear cactus you know that one cuz I eat those you know so me being a Bushman I thought man I'm going to try one of these things so I got this little prickly pear managed to pull one off of this cactus plant they grow these little these little fruits and you could break it open and eat the fruit eat from the inside but these things I didn't know this once I ate it man I had all these tiny little prickles all through my mouth come to find out you know the ancient Indians sift the thing first cuz there's so many tiny little prickles in it they sift it before they eat it I just got straight into it man but it's a it's it's everything there is just and it's it's sticks at you and Spears you everywhere you turn everything you stand on is going to pierce you but you know when it starts to rain if that place ever got rain everything would go soft again all those all those little sharp things would go soft you know so let's all just that's what we want to be like just soft you know you you're you're refreshed by the spirit of God and we we're just nice soft and tender you know we're not sharp and stickly to anyone or that we're just soft and tender which I believe we are already so let's stand

specials we've got we're going to start with uh Sister Louise and then um Stephanie and Co I just wanted to First give a testimony um as you know you've been praying for me because I've been sick I hadn't been to a doctor for about 3 or 4 years so I finally ended up going to the doctor and they took blood tests and various things um but it wasn't until afterwards at the time they said something about testing my thyroid and at the time I thought oh that'll be interesting because about probably 20 or 25 years ago um Joe Hansen came and stayed with me um at the time she was Joe M too um and she noticed that I had a sort of lump on my throat and thought it was thyroid and being a nurse she kind of knew his stuff so anyway I got it checked out and sure enough I had a you know a bit of a thyroid problem so at the time they put me on a waiting list I'm still waiting um and we prayed about it and over time it it went it was one of those things that you kind of it just happened really gradually and then so one day notic oh it's gone so when they said they were testing my thyroid the thought was that'll be interesting anyway I just want to give God the Glory you know like after all these years it's been like 25 years he healed my thyroid problem so so the blood test came back clear so I'm really grateful for that and the song that came to me after I um after that happened um was

go to so I'm going to we're going to have a Spanish lesson today all right so I'm going to read English so when I'm reading I'm not reading that and translating it right it's just but I have it on

without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead silly women later uh sorry lead captive silly women later with sins lead away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of crup Minds reprobate concerning the

them strength Lord watch over them Father we commit them into your hands as well For Your Glory we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats uh this morning so I want to talk about the hardness of this age so I'm going to probably talk a little bit slower cuz Brother Jimmy's going to be translating as I'm speaking so I'm probably if it feels like we're in the slow lane well we're just going to go in the slow lane but we're going to get there so it's not that I don't I feel like splitting out of my skin right now uh the atmosphere here and I'm trying to keep it all together but you know there's a hardness in this age there's a real uh resentment against Christianity in this age there's a real you know people you know you tell people that you're a Christian and they label you with all kinds of things that the devil has thrown in there am me to take away discredit overshadow put doubt unbelief on the power of God and what real Christianity is now this was prophesied this is why I started actually in um so I'm going to keep I started from this verse there's many things here this is speaking of our day because because Paul said that in the last days perilous time shall come now this is this is the last days I'm sure we can agree that this is the last days amen the world is heading for a nuclear war it is it is it cannot be reversed amen prophecy will be fulfilled Rome's going to be be be blown up by bombs America's going to be smoked bombs and craters as was prophesied the first six visions of brother Braham have been fulfilled the seventh sure is on its way America is tearing itself apart amen we're not uh we're not shocked by these well it is shocking to watch to see it unfold but we've been we've been warned before the time it would be here and this is where we're living so we're living in perilous times but you got to realize it doesn't matter how perilous it gets how dark it gets how Troublesome it may be am mean our God is greater he's mightier he won't leave us alone we're not not here alone okay we're not we're not defeated we have come to win he's anointed us to win okay you got to remember that this may seem a bit negative but it's actually very positive because we see prophecy but if you can see the darkness for what it is you don't want it amen you shun it you you but you understand it you say that is that is the devil I want no part of that in my life amen so so there is this there's this piece here where where poorly lists all these attribut Ro of of this anointing that's in this age and and I pray none of us have any even near of this thing in our lives amen but he says now as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of crap Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further sry I've gone to the English have I not um yeah we're going to be jumping around a lot but he says now as Jus and jous withstood Moses so now the Apostle Paul is now take us back into the days of the E first Exodus to say is going to be there's going to be the conditions of the first Exodus are in this Exodus now we understand that there's been three times there been in Exodus right the first time was in the book of Exodus where Israel was taken God sent a Vindicator Prophet the pillar of fire God himself was in attendance and and he he threw Moses brought Israel out of slavery into into the promised land right the second time of the great Exodus when when that Pillar of Fire didn't God didn't send a prophet he came and self the god Prophet amen and he brought a people out of traditions of man and called religion into the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the second Exodus now but now we're living in the time of the Third Exodus where God is taking a people who are filled with the Holy Ghost and he's taking them from this world into Glory this is the great season that we're living in today amen but you see the conditions of the first Exodus have come around in the Third Exodus now we're just going to we're just going to speak a bit I just want to come down to this piece because we very much live in this time now Exodus 1:8 says now there arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph so there came a generation uh or a king over Egypt that did not know the power of Joseph they did not hold the testimony of Joseph where Joseph we know God sent him into Egypt not just to save his Brethren and you know all of his all of his family but Joseph coming into Egypt save the whole world if you think about Egypt if Joseph hadn't been there there would have been famine or there was famine but they would have probably resorted to cannibalism they would have lost everything Egypt would have been destroyed as a nation they would have been a total chaos of a ruin of a civilization it would have ended right there but that gift that God sent into their midst saved saved that nation and made it the mighty super power that it was in that day you see and and and and if you look at history especially Western history where there's been Revival amen you God has sent a messenger into a country and and and the people for a big part of that embraced that and it actually impacted the whole of society where the rulers would would believe what the messenger was saying amen they still were very greatly impacted by that message coming to that country and it delivered them Amen brother brah would say the reason that the French Revolution never crossed the British channel was because the anointed preachers of God Amen preached the word of God and it kept that chaotic spirit away from the country amen you look at America the reason that it is what it is today is because a 100 odd years ago you know they had many great Awakenings there was a great cry and a great desire to see God live and it caused the shackles of Rome to be broken it caused Liberty to come into those colonies and they became the great nation that they are today but the reason that it's falling apart today is because they had an opportunity to embrace the Holy Ghost they had an opportunity to actually really receive the Gospel but they turned it down in the 50s and that's why the thing has fallen apart but you see now now we're living in a season because even brother bram's day you know he knew all was known throughout America during the healing revivals when he preached there and remember the Deep cth to the Deep who's seen that film that was preached in Washington DC I think he was acquainted with Nixon or different ones he knew he knew powerful yo Congressman upshore was a congressman and he was healed in one of the meetings and you know Congressman upshore made sure his testimony got into everyone's hands that was a leader he even said that he translated into Russian and sent it to Stalin cuz he wanted even Stalin to have a chance to see that God Lives there's a lot of influence that post World War II healing Revival that God uh God uh spearheaded through brother brandham changed America it changed Canada it changed many parts of of the world but now we're living in a season where the world doesn't know it anymore they don't know Joseph there's leaders that have risen up they don't know Joseph they don't know the power of God they're not God-fearing anymore they're not interested in anything God has done so we're living in this time very much now I'm not talking about politics today I'm not talking about the election or whatever more but I just want you to know we're living in a season where there's leaders there's most of the world does not know Joseph and his abilities and his I'm talking about God himself now I'm talk about Joseph right and so we're living in this day now excuse me brother bam uh describes or God describes this thank you for the prayers as well I'm feeling a lot better William's back fighting forit Gabriel is fine so I really appreciate that amen but you see God would describe this age uh in the Book of Revelation is a lady oan age it's a and it's a wretched miserable poor blind and naked age now the word comes uh that word comes from two Greek uh Words which means endur and trial it has nothing that uh that's the word wretched it has nothing to do with trials that come to a true Christian for God describes a Chris and trial is blessed and his attitude of one of joy is his description is phrased as wretched and miserable well okay I'll just clear out the flues and hey we'll be good okay now because the Christian attitude uh his attitude one of joy is his description his phras is riched and miserable how strange is in this age of Plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of Plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there's so much more to be had with all that the uh inventions uh to do our work and so many uh things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll is to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy when really nothing seem to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol or even I could say they run to entertainment they run to gaming they run to streaming they run to Social Media they run to something to try and drown out the fear now you think what really really the place where Liberty is should be the House of God Amen where it should be known among the nation that really if you really want freedom go to Christ right that that should be known you think about the revivals of 200 years ago of Charles finny and different ones great great men of God brother B speaks about they would preach in a place they'd go into one one of them I can't remember who it was he'd go into a building and and just attest the Acoustics no microphones no speakers it's stand at the pullit just say and just scream out repent or perish and people who heard him would actually get on their knees and repent there' just be whole towns would be changed pubs would be cleared out all these things you see this is how God used to move and he still is the same but there's a hardness in the world today because people have seen the negative of religion people do not want what God has because they associated with a bunch of hypocrisy and and evil living and Scandal and moneymaking and all these things you see that's why people don't run to run to the Lord anymore but there's a spirit of hardness in the age now he says yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever this boast this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boast of better moral values but and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood now this age does boast its moral Integrity it does you all all the all the all the social rights and everything that done but you see what has happened is we've come back into a time where because there's a pharoh that has risen up that knows not Joseph is that there is a great time of of of children being murdered in this day you know I would hate to think of the number of children that are murdered in the womb now irrespective of how they got there it's still alive you know there's a slogan my body my choices it's should be my body my responsibility and that should go to men and women are we together on that my my yeah but that's not the baby in the womb is not the mother's body it's its own life right so just as just as in the first Exodus all the all the Hebrew all the Hebrew boys were throwing were thrown into the river now I'm just so I'm just trying to find where I have this here I'm sure I have it no maybe I don't I thought i' did oh yes here we are Pharaoh this Pharaoh that knew not Joseph charged the people every Hebrew son's got to be thrown into the river keep the woman alive keep the daughters alive you see and there's a great there there's been Millions around the world that had been killed in the womb right and it's the same thing being see it's being children just like in in in moses' day here in this Exodus time they thrown they were thrown into the Nile now what has happened really with a large percentage of these things is that people sacrifice those children to the God of this evil age because they want to keep their lifestyle you know they want to keep partying they want to live a life of pleasure they want to keep doing what they do and now that child is going to hinder their lifestyle they're going to just be an old Mama now instead of trying to be some sexy thing on the street trying to trying to live a life of Glamour and pleasure and so what they do is they sacrifice now you say this may be a gross exaggeration and you can take it like that if you wish to but I'm saying is people sacri rice children to the God of this evil age even to neglect children being raised in a home that's because when when when fathers would rather spend time in front of a screen you know gaming or doing something instead of looking after their family that's what are they doing they're sacrificing their children to worship a god you see so there's many of these things going on now the Nile was more than a river in Egypt it was a source of life now I'm not sure what era from we got some egyptologists here or amateur Enthusiast ones which is fine but I'm not sure what era of the Egyptian Kingdom this came out of but the river became known as the father of life and the mother of all men it was considered a manifestation of the god Hai I don't think it's a very happy one you know happy but I wouldn't call it happy it's an idol it's cursed who who blessed the land with life as well as with the goddess uh matat at Ma with apost thing a who embodied the concepts of Truth Harmony and balance so sacrificing these babies to a goddess which embodied the concepts of Truth Harmony and balance so there's got to be balance in the world it's just another Pool of genes that's what people say you know oh we're just an animal we're not an animal we have a soul amen we're very different to an animal you know DNA wies were at least 99% the same name is a chimpanzee but a chimpanzee 4,000 years ago was doing the same thing a chimpanzee does today 4,000 years ago what were we doing we were building pyramids and doing whatever if you take the Egyptians but now 4,000 years later an Egyptian can be in space Oh yes they do we live a very different kind of a life why because there's part of us that's not sure we're we're we're animal here but there's a soul there's a there's an image of God that needs to be expressed and and man is made to be a Creator to you know to to to subdue the subdue the world and things the Chimpanzee is still a chimpanzee because they don't have a soul so so don't ever let some unbelieving teacher try and RAM it down your neck you're just you're just like an animal you're just a worthless you're just a number in a system you're more than a number you we're far more than that amen I mean one soul is worth more than 10 million worlds amen amen so we're very important to God so never never let anything tell you that you got nothing you know there's nothing to you no you're part of God if amen I believe that amen amen so don't you know so so they would they were sacrificing these babies to to to the to the Nile Amen to to keep their lifestyle keep control now the same thing happened in the second Exodus where where Herod after after the wise men had come and you know they had come to Jerusalem because they thought well we'll surely find the Christ child here but they were you know that you know Jerusalem was more surprised about God fulfilling scripture in their day than they were Magi from a foreign land and so and then but then of course you know the uh the wise men they go to Bethlehem they find they find our lord Jesus and then they're about to go back to Jerusalem to tell Herod where where the baby is but God warns him in a dream leave and go go home another way and so then when Herod you know when the penny finally drops and he F and he realizes actually the wise men AR going to tell him where the Christ is then he commands his men to go into Bethlehem and kill all the children two years and down why because they're trying to kill the Christ child they're trying to stop the serpent Bruiser raising up now I want to say these things is because we are ordained to stand on the head of the serpent I mean we are ordained that every devil would be under our feet I mean every work of Darkness would be ashes under our feet we are born for that purpose and just like Moses was was born for that purpose to raise up Amen to take that all that demon power in Egypt all the power of Egypt under his feet and bring out a people amen foreshadowing Christ that wouldn't just he wouldn't conquer a national Kingdom but he had conquer hell death in the grave amen that Christ would he would bruise the head of the seed of the serpent amen as prophesied amen he was tried to be killed by Herod to stop that happening are you f Genesis chapter 3 that's where I am if you're wondering God told God told Adam and Eve that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the seed of the serpent that was a prophecy of Christ coming right but as a Shadow Moses was that same thing amen and because we are the children of God we are ordained to do the same thing that God would live in us that every spirit that comes against us will be under our feet amen that we're tread on the head of serpents amen as it says in the Book of Psalms amen this is this is what we're uh anointed to do so this world has been engineered to try and kill us before we can come to our position I mean that's why it's so careful after someone has a real birth the devil's here to try and hinder the growth of that child but God ain't going to let it happen now I'm trying to lay a bit of a background to really get where I want to go now this this word reprobate now sorry I don't I don't have this in espanol um but now this word reprobate it means not standing the test not not approved and it was properly used of of metals and coins so so a coin would be given to you in the olden days and and it would be given to certain Smiths and gills to test if that coin was genuine CU imagine if you're walking around with uh counterfeit gold coins in your in your purse you think man I've got all this gold and then you take it to someone and they examine it and they say no this is fo's gold you know this isn't genuine this isn't genuine gold it would be considered reprobation so it wouldn't be manifesting what it's meant to be manifesting now Janice and jambus were were were reprobate concerning the faith of the day and so men will rise again in this end time as Janice and jambus and they'll be reprobate they won't be genuine concerning the faith now the faith is not a faith it's not a denominational Faith it's the restoration of the full word of God Amen as as prophesied in Malachi 4 so they would be reprobate conc turning the faith but I want you to notice this now when Moses when Moses went in before Pharaoh he cast his rod down first God had commissioned him take that take thy rod throw it on the ground turn into a serpent Moses ran maybe for the hills you know but he came back God said pick it up by the tail and it turned into a staff again and so Moses went in before pharaoh and he's commanding Pharaoh let my people go he's not asking he's commanding and then so and then so when when Moses Moses throws down his staff then Pharaoh maybe we'll just stay with the picture but then when when Pharaoh saw his staff turn into a snake then Pharaoh said well I've got I've got Ministry that can do the same thing I've got Janice and jamus I've got these magicians and they got their Stars they threw it down and it became a snake so they did the same thing that Moses Mo did and what happens is but but the intent of Moses and Janice and jambus are two very different intents Moses is there to bring Liberty Moses is there to break a slave mentality Moses there to break the break the task Master's rods amen Moses is there to deliver people out of Egypt that they don't live in that condition no more and the true gospel does not the true gospel is here to break a slave mentality now that slave mentality is I'll never overcome this God can't do it yes sure he did something in the past but he can't do it today you know I'm always going to be this way I Was Born This Way my Situation's too bad and people surrender themselves to those kind of Lies that's a slave mentality and what happens is Janice and jambus what they wanted to do is keep the people in the Kingdom of Egypt so there's Ministry around the world and they want to they're Kingdom Builders all they're interested and is adding numbers to their movement to their denomination that's all they and they want to hold the people in that in that mentality and they'll say yes you know and and they keep people in a slave mentality because they make the grace of God something it's not they make the grace of God basically God puts blinkers on his eyes and don't see our problems and doesn't fix us he can't do it no the grace of God is sure you've got this addiction sure you've got this Spirit ruining your life but the grace of God looks beyond it and and they preach those things in that manner and they keep people in that state of a slave mental but the grace of God is here to break the Yoke of the enemy the anointing destroys the Yoke amen the true anointing of God destroys the Yoke it doesn't give you a seven-step plan to coping with your problems no the word of God brings Liberty and complete Liberty amen doesn't give a partial Liberty we're not you know on the weekends we're with God and during the week we're with the devil you under no sir we are we are full custody and soul custody with our Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah but you see this is what this is the problem with denomination it holds people in a system amen you can look through church history and whenever God sheds light on his on his word the church doesn't Rejoice the church doesn't break down its barriers it doesn't delete out its full stop after its lift list of beliefs and and and and lets God change it they say no this what this man is preaching is contrary to what we previously believe and therefore he is wrong look at y I was thinking of I was thinking of um uh John hus he was 100 years before Luther he received virtually the same Revelation that Luther received that just shall live by faith and many different things so close to what Luther was preaching that when Luther rose up with what he believed they said you're just believing you're just preaching what hus believed but you see John hus when he came to the end of his life he was he was alone he had he he died on the stake everyone forsook him the church said rant he said I cannot and he died alone at the stake but he said in a 100 years someone will raise up with the same teaching and you won't be able to stop it and 100 years later I think virtually to the day Martin Luther nailed the thesis on the uh Church door there in wienberg I think it was amen and the revolution I mean you it was a revolution the Reformation amen spread through Europe and people broke the shackles of Rome I mean but you see he stood alone but you see the Catholic Church did not rejoice and he was a Catholic priest I think he was hus was I you know Luther was as well and he didn't want to start a new church no he wanted to change the one he was in but you see there were Janice and jambres there amen putting shade on his teaching trying to keep the people in that system of Catholicism and that cycle has repeated down Through the Ages amen Lord amen so so that is Janice and jamb intent is to keep people in a human Kingdom we're not here to build human kingdoms we're not even here to build the name of this church forget the name of this church we just have a name but no brother Bram said his mission is that God would take men and women and make them powerhouses of the Holy Ghost built into the fullness of the stature of Christ and when he finishes the church age book his last um his last paragraph he says this one thing I want to see is that man and God would have a true spiritual relationship am mean that man would walk with God in the revelation of his word he said basic he said that is basically my summary of my entire life that is the summary of the angel of God coming and commissioning brother Braham that's a summary of the seals opening amen that's a summary of the truth being restored as that there be true spiritual relationship between God and man restored upon the Earth but you see Janice and jambus want to keep people in uh as slaves right say Let My People Go amen we're not slaves we're free people today you don't have to listen to the lies of a serpent amen you can walk free amen but you see what happened is when Janice and jambus did the same things it hardened the heart of pharaoh and the people and you see now this is why when you go maybe you speak to someone and maybe you use exactly the same words as a denomination you you maybe you share same testimonies as happens even in Pentecostal moves it hardens the heart of people because they say well that happens there what's so special about you you understand you are you with me class today see there's a hardening of people's hearts because of what Jenice and jambus do but you got to understand it doesn't stop the genuine it doesn't stop the genuine amen these things have allowed to come upon the Earth to test the genu do people really want to know God because Janice and jous they did the same enchantments as Moses did but one difference is one serpent got fat the others got eaten it wasn't Moses's he didn't have to say Janice can I have my staff back now no Moses one gobbled up the others went on his way and then and then it just says here in verse 14 Pharaoh's heart is hard and he refused to let the people go because of what Janice and jambus did and it was the same thing it was exactly the same thing when Moses was told by God to go uh pour water upon the land and then all the waters will turn into blood Janice and jambus did the same thing they did they did exactly the same thing and so Pharaoh's heart was hardened and his house and neither did he set his heart to to to to set them free so the bogus dollar begins to begins to actually uh cause so much trouble that people don't see the genuine and that's why we've got to live such a life that if that that people may may be maybe uh I can't remember the phrase but they can be staunch atheists they can be staunch a stch can be atheist but if they see you they say if there's ever a Christian it's that person amen that's how we should live Lord if they Lord use me to be a genuine example of Christianity amen that when people see me they don't see a counterfeit they may get confused because I sound like a lot of what they say but remember Moses did it first and JIS and jambus copied right brother Braham came with the gift of healing the two signs right and he said after that there's all kind of people that you know you know people preached you had to see blood on your hands or oil on your face or Balls of Fire on the platform or you know all kinds of fanaticism rose up because it was what Janice and jambres raising up with similar things but who did it first and people you know because brother Bram took people by the hand that he saw the he saw the patn and different things on his hand and could discern what was wrong with the person before the gift of discernment came into manifestation and others would say they smell Devils they see colors all kinds of things and what is it as Janice and jamb is bringing confusion among the people to keep people in Chains but who did it first the prophet did it first amen as as as uh Jesus would would speak the there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they would deceive the very elect so we know a Christ is an anointed one amen so says that many false anointed ones would rise so there are people who are genuinely Anointed with the Holy Ghost but they're not genuine in their hearts this is the age we live and that's why it's so important that when we judge everything we always judge it by the fruit amen where is Judge it by the fruit Jesus Jesus would say by their fruits s sorry we're going to this one instead he says by their fruits you shall know them he says you don't get you don't get good fruit off a corrupt tree it brings forth evil fruit so you so he's saying look at the life that the tree produces it can have a big explanation about what it does and what it can do and what it's made of but just get the fruit how do you know an apple tree you get an Apple off an apple tree right you eat the apple that's an apple orange tree all those kind of things so it's the life see we must never put this a a supernatural gift above the life of God above what the word is meant to produce there's many Supernatural gifts in the world does it mean we run after them all there's many who who who who have great testimonies even no it's the word of God that's the most important thing amen it's the word of God right it's the life that's produced by that word you say well I know a lot of train wrecks along the life of people who claim to be the message but what about the genuine what about the genuine believer you see the devil will never show you the genuine believer he always show you the mistakes and the trouble and the problems and whatever more but what about the genuine yes that's I've said to many people go around church and ask people their testimony I've said to people go ask them their testimony ask them why are they Believers yeah isn't that the proof of the pudding is the testimony thereof amen amen I think I think so amen I trust you all with me amen amen see it's it's when we really know him then the Life of Christ comes forth because many will come to him in the end time say Lord have we not done many great things in your name he says depart from me I never knew you they cast out devils in many mighty things they said he never knew them now God knows everybody but he didn't intimately know them he never dwelt he they never receiv received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you see and this is why this is why we must go we must take it back always back to the scripture amen right the word of God what to me I I follow the message because it reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture right I follow what brother R teaches I take it back into the Bible I never find it go outside the Bible I always find it back in the scripture right this was the absolute of the Prophet amen amen this is why I follow it What attracted me was his preaching when I heard him preach Jesus Christ came out of History he was alive I remember sitting there in my flat making Homebrew drunk and loss as can be hearing and preach crying I'd sat in church many different churches before that but that voice spoke to me because why he took the scripture say look you can meet God today he's alive there's a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost he can transform you he can free you from sin he's just preaching the Bible what he it changed my life amen more than even the supernatural well what about the supernatural in his life that was just to vindicate what he was preaching was the truth amen and God over Vindicated it that you would know we're the true voices amen praise the Lord amen you see Pharaoh's Pharaoh's denomination said they could do the same thing carnal impersonation and it hide in the heart of the people now in Jesus's day so I'm going to skip through because I feel like we kind of see the negative is always thrown everywhere now let's just look at these guys for a for a second because that Spirit of Janice and jambus has never died Spirits don't die amen that's why you got to be careful whatever comes out of your mouth it should be a positive confession of the word of God Amen right it's like you know Jesus is there by the tomb of Lazarus and um and then the you know the Jews that were with with Mary and Martha comforting them basically trying to keep them in their sorrow said you know he could heal others but this one he couldn't save this one he couldn't help that's why he wasn't here the case was too hard you know so that is that unbelieving spirit will say sure he's done other things in the past but he can't do it now he can't help me now the trouble's too big now look Lazarus is dead if he was really the resurrection and the life why did he stop him dying but Jesus in John 11 it's interesting he actually says I'm glad for your sakes that I wasn't there telling telling his disciples that Lazarus is dead I'm glad for your sakes that I wasn't there that you would believe so a lot of times in life hardship comes on because God actually wants to raise our faith you know all of us want a testimony but are you willing to actually be the one in the testimony are you willing to let God use you as a testimony oh I need proof of the Living God he wants to use you amen I mean cuz it's you know cuz it's one thing to share someone else's testimony but when it's your testimony that's a very different thing amen but you look at these guys after after Jesus rose Lazarus from the grave then they then they had a meeting what are we going to do then from that day forth it says here in in in verse 53 from then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death and they even wanted to put Lazarus to death too [Music] but this is this is the spirit of Jenice and jambus because there was a there was a pressure put on don't follow this man they that Spirit wanted to keep Israel look at their condition in that day look at them under these religious leaders what Liberty did they have what promise of Moses did they have living in their lives apart from the fact they were living in the promised land what did they have did they have Liberty did they have did they have their own Nation were they free to live however they wanted to live no they were taxed by the Romans they were trotten down they you know all this trouble had come in but what was the reason because they knew not Joseph they didn't know the power of God they didn't even ask the question like Gideon Gideon was a scriptural man when the angel of the Lord came he said if God is for us we are the if God is with us we are the Miracles they weren't asking that question they were just trying to politically survive and just keep their little thing going on what was it it was that Spirit of Janice and jambus holding the people down but now when the Messiah came not just a prophet but when the Messiah came Amen to set them free not from Rome but from sin and self and death am mean to fulfill the promises that the prophets have been speaking would come and there he was they did not get happy they got angry and the more Jesus did the angrier they became amen but then even among themselves even among themselves they had the supernatural Jesus uh um this is in Matthew 12 but but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow does not cast out Devils but by beab the prince of devils and Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided pardon me against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if I by beab cast out Devils then whom do your children cast them out therefore ye shall be your judges so they had the supernatural in their midst themselves what's all going on that Spirit of Janice and jambus to harden the hearts of the people Amen to cause a rejection of the Messiah this is in the second Exodus amen they see that Spirit Never Dies it wants to keep people bound and that's why it's so important friends we're not here to be slaves we're not here to be I pray we not a single person stands behind this pulpit and preaches a slave mentality amen this message did not come to bind people and change that they could never become the Sons and Daughters of God to fulfill the word of God now this message came that men and woman would raise in faith amen would know God in the power of his resurrection amen that all doubts would be dispar little discouragement would be gone I mean a a a burning Faith would be in their hearts amen that God Lives he's more than able to do it whatever he's promised he can do it in his time he'll do it we're children of God Amen and this is what the message has come to do amen we are not here to be beaten down the devil may try and beat you down just like he tried to beat Moses down but Moses said no God has commissioned me amen I'm going to take my people out amen cuz God has commissioned me to do it amen and God has commissioned us to do the same thing amen that that that there'll be Liberty in every life Hallelujah say that that that is impossible no we can be so free Hallelujah that all the cares of Life can go all regret can be gone all guilt can be gone under the blood of Jesus Christ amen and that's more than a euphor that comes and goes that's a reality in my life I known whom I have believed I mean you see the Apostle Paul when he was when they said I'm you know his head was going to be chopped off he didn't start writing a list of regret he said I've got a Crown of Life Hallelujah that's set before me and not just me only but all those that love his glorious appearing Hallelujah I mean when he stood before King AG grippa those chains on him what caused those chains that Spirit but the word of God is not bound the word of God cannot be bound amen God used God used that against them but even just for the Apostle Paul's benefit for a reason but when he's standing before king of gripper in the chains I ask you the question who was really the chained one in that room was it Paul or was it king of gripper I say it was king of gripper and chains all of his court and his pump and who he thought he was and his Splendor and I'm in charge of this place they were in Chains of sin they were in Chains of Darkness they were actually the prisoners and Paul was the free one we got to look at our lives differently we look at our lives differently and have love and concern for those who are changed amen that should be our burden Lord loose those chains off my brother loose those chains off my sister amen I remember when when when when the family and I we went to Canada I know I've shared this but I'll share it again we're there at the youth camp and even before we go to the camp you know Christine's praying about going and the Lord says there's going to be a s spirit of suicide there at that camp and there was a girl there we didn't know we didn't know the people and uh her friends came forward for prayer saying uh um you know pray for our friend she's got this the suicidal Spirit she's tried to take her life a couple of times and you know pray for her I didn't know she was there was she was there I thought she was back in I think Quebec wherever they were from I can't remember so praying for her and then in that same service as the after service everyone's praying and singing and I think it was the song even my chains are gone I can't remember which one the spirit of God came down and and and and she was set free of that suicidal spirit and one of her friends who was praying for her at that time she said she literally felt chains fall at her feet so they are chains if you're if you're bound if if negativity is consuming your life that ain't meant to bind you am mean that's not you that's the enemy amen if there's if there's suicide or just the you're empty I'm worthless I'm not mean nothing that's not you that's not God God would never call you that you are the purpose of his being he died for you I mean he gave his whole life for you he cares very much he's not indifferent he's not distant somewhere he cares for you more than you realize but the devil wants that Janice and jamus wants to come along and say no you're not important you're just young or whatever you've lived your life whatever more no you're very important to God amen amen but the Rage of those guys caused caused Paul caused the Lord to be crucified it wasn't the oh the Romans killed him no was that spirit it was that Christ rejecting Spirit I'm not even saying the Jews did it was that Christ rejecting Antichrist Spirit that's still in the world today caused the crucifixion it caused Paul to be bound but he had to go to Rome so God uses everything anyway you see so these things hinder or try to hinder because there was pressure on the people if any man confesses see nevertheless among the chief rules also believed on him so it wasn't just the the common folk in Israel some of the chief rulers believed he was the Messiah can you imagine you've been studying the Torah all your life you know it from jot and title from Genesis 1 to Malachi 4 and 6 you know it you can you can repeat it and then you're seeing a man live it don't you think that you know don't you think that they would put two and two together in their mind where's he from Bethlehem what scripture would come to mind where's raised up nazarus where would the scripture would come to mine look what he's doing don't you think there' be two and two come together be like hey this I've read this this and I believe God would actually bring it to their remembrance to give them a a space of Mercy to get to realize hey this is me doing this receive it receive it can you see the word living in your midst amen but there was precious say because of the Pharisees they did not confess unless they should be put out of their synagogue control control amen we go through many things but sadly as janison that spirit is hard ined the world now that doesn't mean the elect can't be found out there nothing can hold back a child of God nothing can hold back a child of God but we got to realize that this is the reason why the world is so indifferent I think it was you know well my grandmother so I think it was in the 20s or 30s you know they used to have tent meetings out the back of Park in East Coast there you know she was a Catholic but they'd go along there was actually in New Zealand there was a genuine Christian culture right but then now what's come to light in all these things the effect of Janice and jambus on this nation and and it's been around the world look at all the scandals of the Catholic church is it going to change no she'll keep going on you know and you know there's been this big um you know uh abuse inquiry not just among State institutions but also religious ones trying to help people and all these poor people whose lives have been so destroyed because they go to a place that can help them and their lives just get messed up is there is there a real genuine change in those places you say well why did that happen because that Spirit not the people that did that Spirit anointed people to cause people to be damaged and become in a slave hold people down but to harden the country oh you're like those people oh what about them oh you oh I'm a Christ oh they say they're Christians too oh you talk about Jesus on the cross they talk about it too you talk about the resurrection they did too oh you sing that song they sing it too the same thing Janice and jambus did after Moses did it casting the rod down became a serpent see they can even say the same things like us they can do the same things like us without the life you see but what is it now it's hard it's hardened the heart of the world people who push a Prosperity Gospel H this is hard youo the gospel has become big business big business around the world I mean there's there's there's church denominations that literally run portions of countries even a papa you know the government has asked the big like the Catholic 7th Day Adventist and Baptist and different ones who got big parts of that country Methodist different ones and said you need to take greater care of the people in your regions they have literally forfeited parts of their country to those churches to look after Healthcare education all those things it's big business you say well it's doing a lot of good but people up there say well if I follow this and I reject that where am I going to get my Healthcare from who's going to who's going to educate my children this is real problems up there because because over there if you leave a church you know the whole family is in an uproar the village is in an uproar you can't just leave one and change to another one you certainly can't leave denomination and accept the truth there's a lot of persecution the Believers have faced and continue to face face because of that and then so now even with the prosperity side you know people see churches just pulling for money they just want to make money and it hardens the hearts of the people they think these people don't care about the ones they're pulling money from they just care about their wallet that's all they care about they don't care about the people and it hardens the hearts of the people but in spite of all those things there's still a genuine there's still a genuine Lord Jesus Christ there's genuine Christians upon Earth I'm just going to wrap up with this there's a genuine Spirit of Hol of the Holy Ghost that creates genuine Christians right so this world may be hard you say it's a pretty dark picture I say there's nothing that can hold back a child of God Amen doesn't matter how deep in sin Legion Legion had Legions of demons in him in the tombs by himself cutting himself among the tombs did that stop God going his way no did that stop him coming out I mean all the religion the Apostle Paul had did it stop him coming out no sir amen the woman at the well the things that she was raised up in and trouble and things she had did that stop her no cuz when the genuine came her way amen God set her free and Friends God's hands upon the Earth are your hands God God's feet are your feet God's tongue is your tongue he wants to use your voice your life amen that to to live a genuine Christian Life that no matter how hard this world is there's still a genuine somewhere that when someone looks at you in spite of your fault your failures your Humanity they see you they say there's a genuine Christian I may not agree with this with this church stuff and the things they do and how they dress but there's something in them that's real am mean they live what they speak amen now I I believe I'm looking I believe I'm looking at those kind of people amen I I sincerely believe that amen that there is not a that that we are not these guys we are not these guys on the throne here a Janice and jambus no we're a Moses that we have genuine care and consideration for people amen so let's have the musicians please this morning I just want to leave it there right so does everyone understand this is why this world is so hard okay but it was prophesied to be this hard that there be such an indifference but in spite of the indifference God is here to set the people free amen so let's live life let's let's live the Christian Life that is not just our words but it's our life it's our attitude it's our motive objective how we treat people doesn't matter who they are we were once like that oh that person could never be saved well you would have put me in that category 17 years ago you would have put me in that category amen true you would have L I'm not I'm not that's just true God can find anyone so let's live a life shall we I know you are God bless you keep shining your light amen you say I'm not making an impact you have you have no idea the impact that you you make the influence that you carry amen God bless you amen let's let's stand amen praise the Lord I want to I want to sing the song Thank God I am free amen free free from this world of sin amen thank God I am free yes free free from this world of [Applause] sin I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I've
