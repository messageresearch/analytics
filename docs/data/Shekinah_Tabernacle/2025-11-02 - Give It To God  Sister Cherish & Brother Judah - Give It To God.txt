Lay [singing] it in his [music] hands. Give it to God knowing that he's able to do what only he can. [singing] He's a burden bearer. So cast your every care you can bring all [singing] that you've got. Why wait another day? Give it [singing] to God. Just remember the [music] promise. Keep standing on it. Know you can take him [singing] at his word. It's not a tear that is fallen. [music] Time that you've called him and went unheard. So trust [music] in the Lord. cuz he's got a plan. When you're broken, [music] when you're weery, when you've done all that you can, [music] give it to God. [singing] Turn it [music] over. Lay it in his hands. Give it [singing and music] to God knowing that he's able to do what only [singing] he can. He's a burden [music] bearer. So cast your every care. You can bring [singing] all that you. [music] Why wait another day? Give [music] it to God. Turn it over. [singing] Lay it in his hands. Give it to [singing] God knowing that he's able to do [singing] what only he can. He's a burden. [singing] So your every care you can bring all that you've got. Why [singing] wait another day? [music] &gt;&gt; Give it to [singing] God. Give it [music and singing] a go. [applause]
