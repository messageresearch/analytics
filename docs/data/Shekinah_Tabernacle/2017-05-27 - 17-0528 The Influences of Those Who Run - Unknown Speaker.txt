now I'm not sure that all of you are aware of what happened last yesterday so the men that were there I just want to give a quick quick understanding to everyone about how much that meant to Ben so Ben Ben also goes to church and he believes and yesterday the fact that so many strangers rocked up at his house and helped him with things that he just doesn't get to things that he's been meaning to do for a long time but it just doesn't have time because he's not at home he was overwhelmed so it might not have looked like it while we were working but afterwards I stayed back and just had a chat to him and he said this is what it should be like people should just help each other and what was comforting for me so he made the comment about you know he would like to do something back so that he can get someone you know maybe another day like that and it just came up to me and I realized that us that were there we weren't expecting something back and I think that's one of the that's one of the characters of God as well you know that he puts in us that we would do for love and not not expect anything back because that's just who he is in us and that we can live like that without without expecting him to do something back for us and I would just I would like to thank everyone that came yesterday to help and those who prayed keep on praying Sinead was was she quite shocked because she

control of this service in Jesus Christ's name we ask anybody amen god bless you think about the job thanking musicians amen good morning everyone there's a lot if you've got your Bibles handy just want to turn to Leviticus chapter 14 and verse 1 so just one announcement so Queen's birthday weekend which is I believe is next weekend as our the church's five year anniversary and so we're going to have a regular Sunday morning service and then we'll get about about four o'clock about four till about 6:00 we're going to have a we're gonna have a praise and worship service and testimonies as well so if you have a testimony or you've got it have you got a special or a testimony you like to share Kenya I'm just going to drop or other Isaac into it can you please it brother Isaac now so we can have a bit of a you know your plan of what we're gonna how we're going to have the evening okay so that's that's next Sunday now if you let's go Leviticus chapter 14 verse 1 the biggest foot in the water isn't the Lord spake unto Moses saying this shall be the law of the leper and the day of his cleansing he shall be brought unto the priests of the preshow go forth out of the camp and the preshow look and behold of them if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper then shall the priests command to take for him that is to be cleansed to birds alive and clean and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water as for the living bird he shall take it and the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop and shall dip them and the living bird and the blood of the bird that was killed over the righting water and he shall sprinkle upon him that that is to be cleansed from leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field and let's just go to let's just go to Hebrews chapter 11 again just want to continue continue my thought about let us run I think after this is one more part but we'll just see as the Lord opens it but so Hebrews 11 and 32 and we'll read down to 12 verse to live it in 32 what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon an american of samson of jeff knee of david also and samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens people receive their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had cruel had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword we want they wandered about in sheepskins and go goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that there so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame is sit down at the right hand of God who was read the next verse as well for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself they should be weary wearied and faint in your minds Amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about if I could if I could give this a title I want to speak about the influences of those who rent or those who run now brother Branham would would quote a a a poem and it's called the psalm of life and I'm going to read it to you it says tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream for the soul for the soul is dead that slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal dust thou art and dust returnest was not spoken of the soul not enjoyment and not sorrow as our destined end alway but to act that each tomorrow finds us farther than today art is long and time is fleeting and our hearts though stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave in the world's broad field of battle in the bivouac of life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in the strife trust not future however pleasant let the dead past bury its dead act act in the living present heart within and go right overhead lives live site of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life Solon Maine a furlong and shipwreck brother seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait amen brother bran would quote that quite the sum of life many times and it tells us to me we should be up and doing we should be heroes in the strife amen we can't just be be like dumb driven cattle I mean but we have to we have to press the mark of the high calling now in influence you know the definition of an influence is the capacity to have an effect on the character development or behavior of someone or something so we have all been influenced by something right our lives have been shaped by influence and it's normally it's normally the ones who influence us the most in a positive way they are the ones you want to become like okay so now when we see people do great things I'm just going to lay a bit of a foundation aw do you think because we we you're your influence you are reflecting something that's influenced you I mean you are you want to I'll just read you're the one when when you see a person doing great when we see people do great things it captures the imaginations of those who see them do it yep and they begin to copy that person act like them speak like them dress like them do what they do because their imagination has been captured because they've seen a life that's been lived in front of them I know I've told the story many times but when I was about seven or eight you know I really loved cricket I love cricket longer than that but it was then i i i saw a pace followed by the name of Danny Morrison play for New Zealand and I wanted to be a fast bowler member my imagination got captured right and so I wanted to bowl like him I wanted to run up like him I wanted to you know I wanted to be just like him and so when I would practice cricket I'd imagine that my imagination was I'm him but because when I had seen someone run right I had seen a life that was lived before me even though it's just a little screen where I saw he became my hero so he became my hero and my imagination was captured by that man and I wanted me to become just like him right so and that can be that can be anything in life it is so my seven-year-old heart was I wanted to be just like him hello seven and eight year olds right amen hello every other age because your imagination is caught by your you've been influenced by something and subconsciously you want to become it and it can be just a religious person it can be in a different person it can be a worldly person or can be Christ themselves amen it can be his work amen set the pins now now so we all know we've all seen feats of great human ability and they've all captured our imagination once in our life now but instead of wanting to become you know an all black or a springbok or a ragged Bushman or whatever whatever you've seen in life and you want to become instead of letting that capture your imagination why don't you let him that died for you him that's going to resurrect you come that's going to take you in a rapture why don't you let him capture your imagination and because many times we think of imagination just as a bad thing but what don't you imagine God living what do you begin to think about what he could do I meant God we have one life to live I mean we're all at the prime of our spiritual life it's the best time to be alive and God wants to take you out oh I'm going to read a quote from perfect strength and perfect weakness that that God's God's strategy brother Bram says is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them that's a shred that's his plan take empty human vessels and shake the world Amen you see now just a little bit see just like at Pentecost at Pentecost what did he do and taking them ten days to get all emptied up but they were all standing there with their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up that's all they shook the world poured himself into them that's the need of today that's what we need today as empty vessels yes sir so God can fill them up amen and you cannot take them I've got to bypass a lot here he says God could not use them as long as they're already filled up if you're full of the old theological training God can't use you God's got to have empty vessels so he can fill them now Elisha didn't say go get some vessels and borrow a lot of oil and we'll see if you can get a good sale price on it you've got to get a little more and you can pay the neighbor back he said just get the empty vessels that's all you need and that's what it was at Pentecost they had empty vessels so God can fill them up brother this day demands that amen empty vessels this day's got to have that we'll have that all Paris amen so you know why don't you just let your imagination you doesn't matter what age you are let your imagination swing out a little but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm in the same same God that spoke to Samuel as a young boy can speak to you and we can fill your life I mean can you you use you to shake this world we let your Matt go but we think of you know what job we're going to get in what sport we're going to play and you know my hero is not some sports star anymore I mean my my hero I don't even know who's in the All Blacks anymore I don't care I don't you know I still I still love sailing but I'm not caught up in the America's Cup I used to get up very early hours in the morning when it was overseas and I'd watch every race yeah the last few ones I haven't watched a race life I don't care my hero is not someone on a boat I mean my hero is not some Sportster awesome you know you look at thee my hero does not walk around with his undies on the outside wearing spandex that's right do you think these these theat these superheroes I tell my girls you never trust a man no I'm not saying this for jokes it's how ridiculous it is never trust a man wearing spandex with his undies on the outside I've come to say to you all know you don't oh no sir you call the police let's get mad amen but yet the whole world and it's not just children it's adults yeah they made they you're the you're the comic book people Hollywood they get way more money out of people my age yeah I meant that engrossed themselves in these things that's not my hero right I trust it's not your hero well he can do he can do cool stuff can he speak a world into existence is he a living reality can he heal the second raise the dead can he walk on water amen couldn't Kenny pass through walls Alya no he cannot amen let him let the one who's alive and riyo present let him catch your imagination I mean wait you know why can't I use you you only think about you know I just I so caught up by this a few weeks ago Jesus ran a mint you know we speaking about we can speak about the prophets we can speak about Paul or Irene yes or you know we can speaker any of the great church young men and women of faith down through the ages but if they could be standing here today they wouldn't you know no doubt they'd always come back to the whether they saw that read hallelujah John yeah you're the apostle saw so God become flesh they saw Jesus run influence my life I mean their imagination was caught up hallelujah and there's something in this is I want to be just like him I mean then Paul saw him on the road to Damascus it'd be incredible for them to stand here I mean but they would begin to talk about the one that influenced their life amen to shake the world hallelujah and it's got to be the same thing let him yeah let him take your imagination amen why can't we imagine the pillar of fire becoming visible and why can I imagine God saving a whole community Amen or healing the circle raising the dead what think upon these things and why can't we think about that but the devil will have us down some psy track of get your head you know brother BAM would say take a shotgun and shoot the TV out maybe a mint no I'd say some of us need to take a shotgun and shoot these things out I mean because years ago tell we don't have television you know we're believers then we got worse than a television right here and we've got our head buried and stuff yeah that's going to burn in ashes I mean I don't think that's too strong we are cool to run I'm not trying to dig up a simmer from few weeks ago but let him influence you who was influencing your life the most I mean is it is it just religion trying to try to count your Osito you're conscious but I go to church but I spend a little bit of time that's just a fig leaf but I listened to a few misses well that's just a fig leaf religion yeah let's try to just cover up your conscience with a conviction if God is convicting you say God pour it in but that's a gift of God to be even convicted amen Hey amen we let him take up your imagination he says that really possible he shook he he used 120 people in the upper Murray shook the world the world is still being changed because of those ones Amen you say well is it still possible today absolutely Amen God guys could just shake your school will shake your workplace or shake your family whatever your world is God was it take you holily well I've never seen it done we've seen it though we've got a record of here of the world being shaken my people who sold out a man they said I'm going to go out the loss of yours despised few and they gave themselves they really there were people like us I mean exactly like us you go through all the way down through the scripture there were people just like us but they were influenced by someone anybody unseen God hallelujah and they said I'm going to let my life be shaped by that one amen that's the one Jesus read I'm going to come back to it we've seen that same son of men running this day the son of man Jesus Christ has been revealed to a Ministry of a prophet don't let that become common to you I've seen that same God run yeah amen it's like we are back in the book of Acts scene because we are robbers like we're it's like we just with Timothy that you know that next generation that's come down that's us I made a Paul had a burden I want to pass this faith down amen and it should be the same thing you say well we might take a rapture tomorrow I say please God can it be oh yeah but it should be in us I want to pass this I want to live a life that also influenced my children those around me I say I've seen one run I mean I want to become like that one that should be us now let's go to Isaiah 6 and 1 because influence is very powerful influence is incredibly powerful and influence that is not of God a meant that isn't it that is taken in a wrong way can actually block the visitation of the Lord it's very powerful I mean so if your mind is wandering off onto all kinds of things you should just put a stop there think on him I mean let's not let's be rugged yeah let's be up and doing I mean let's be determined amen members Isaiah 6:1 now before we read here Isaiah was influenced greatly by King Uzziah they are both young they both got on really well and brother bam and I'll read some quotes he leaned on the arm of the yo-yo the prophet leaned on the arm of the king he looked up to the king Isaiah was a prophet of God yes well can't agree but they had to be an influence that had to die in order for a visitation Isaiah 6 and 1 and the year now notice in the year that King Uzziah died this influence died right I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood seraphim's each one had six wings with twain covered his face and with twain covered his feet and with twain heated fly and one cried out to another saying holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried the house was filled with smoke then said I was me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts in 1:1 a den flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon us upon my mouth and said lo this is this has touched thy lips my iniquity is taken away thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying who shall I send who will go for us and he said and then said I here I am send me so here was a god-ordained prophet this is how strong influence there's a God ordained prophet and King Uzziah was a godly King until he got lifted up in Pride and wanted to become a priest and go offer sacrifices yo do the incense in this place of a priest but he was never priest and he got lifted up in his in his heart because the Lord had blessed him so much and so now this influence had to die his Isaiah with in the Book of Isaiah as the whole Bible he goes back from when iniquity is found in the heart of Lucifer and he falls he goes all the way from there he brings in Calvary Redemption salvation and the new heavens and new earth it goes all the way that's the whole Bible in one book I'll say in order for that inspiration to be given that influence had to die mm-hmm n I mean and these influences in life that's right that are actually holding back the visitation yeah amen I want this to sink in is this influences in life when we lean too much on the arm of flesh can't stop and does stop the visitation of God yeah a meant that people because he was a God ordained prophet but he wasn't fully in his office there as he should have been the influence had to die amen and it's the same thing with us now I'm going to read from influence brother Brown who speaks of so here too this influence had to die and then he saw the Lord High lifted up and then he is cleansed and commissioned and set into service amen and it's like US influence has to die and then we see our state that we're in this world is so blinding yes Amen this thing can be so blinding oh yeah Amen the influence has to die Amy this is just as bad as heroin yeah you know the internet it is just as addictive with all these other things but people justify themselves say well I don't shoot needles into my arm but you still are just as addicted I mean hey God wants to shake the earth one more time I mean he wants to shake this world I mean he wants to shake this world brother Gramps hit the end of his ministry I'll ride this trail again and that wasn't him riding the trail it was God speaking first person through through a prophet just like David under the inspiration says my God my God was Elfa sake of me he was looking at Calvary David wasn't forsaken he was a king on the throne but as God speaking first person through a man so when brother Han said I'll ride this trail again that was God speaking saying I'm going to ride this trail I'm going to do the same minister again but not in one man I mean but in a many many men but brave hallelujah so that's the case the whole world was shook you see that is you see the Prophet coming to his position amen he begins to speak the Word of God hallelujah the whole world is falling apart because a man came with a ministry it did I mean you take 1963 this is the you know Paul I mean Peter prophesized the world I'll not only shake the heavens both shake the heavens that in here and that is a loosening that word shaking as a loosening and you see people who are not even I think brother brother auntie bought it out a while ago I think Baptist people they took crime you know murder rape all these different things divorce all these things 1963 is it Graf 1963 goes up yeah it's worse it's what's happened God has added his voice upon the earth yeah I mean and the whole world is falling apart God said God sent the gift brother BAM Caesar they could if the people could only rally around the gift of the Holy Ghost and these last days would have a millennium and he said America wouldn't need to worry about the Russian subs I mean the whole world would fear them if they just rallied around the gift I mean of the Holy Ghost I mean there's a few rally around his anoint him his word he's a Living God if you rally your life around that yeah amen with you think about the God himself step down and this generation he heard his voice Amy if you just rally around that polio god will take care of everything out amen he said if yo if they just rallied around the gift of the Holy Ghost coming and you're coming in the nation they would need to worry about whether Russian subs were and what they were doing how Wilden fear them but they turned it down and the world is falling apart amen incredible things have happened I'm you take you take history and you just take thee becomes the Prophet comes upon the scene the Gospels turn down then what happens you know as as he is there delivering the word you know hell opens upon the earth the whole world has changed but we've been bought I think I see the last week we have been born in this change world but just as all hell is here heaven is present amen so let heaven influence you yes Amen this whole world is different because of a ministry God sent Elijah gauzy and Elijah down into Israel the first year the spirit of Elijah and Elijah says there won't be any rain or Dew till I call for the whole nation was changed amen do you understand the significance of what God has done for us yes don't take it casual don't just leave it on the shelf right I meant you this is not having a message book or a tape in your houses it's not a rosary bead religion where I have the I have all the paraphernalia therefore I'm going to go yeah God wants to take you I mean what is influencing you the most because you'll become what's influencing you the most right you know you take you take Hollywood I think I see this before they show a camera shot of what they want you to see and that's all you see and you see the glamour and all the wonderful shiny things and all the wealth of you know and that captures people's imagination and they want to they want to become like that but if you just turned the camera a little bit you'd see the brokenness yeah yep and and and and all the drug abuse in the broken homes the broken people you'd see all the broken the destruction that thing creates the devil doesn't want to show you that he just wants to show you the nice things yes amen and then the devil will only want to show you the bad things of being a believer you say this is what it producers know that's not what it produces this produces a rapture this produces a body change this producers are overcoming power now our ambition should never to be like should never to be like the world now Satan came to Jesus in the wilderness and the hour of his great temptation and he said if thou bow down and worship me he showed him all the kingdoms of the world this is a matthew 4 and 8 again the devil take him up to an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship Me then said Jesus unto Him get the hint Satan fer is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve so the devil offered Jesus the kingdoms of the world he offered him the kingdoms of the world but he offered him in such a way that it was that he was going to give it to him but Jesus said no get hints because I'm going to buy it I mean I'm going to redeem I'm going to purchase the world by my blood so the kingdoms of man will become the kingdoms of God and and God in his mind was never just to let the world continue as it was but if but if Jesus worship Satan - to receive all the kingdoms of the world they would just continued on but in God's mind he didn't see civilization this way and the new heavens and new earth it is not like this I say praise the Lord Amen so he was offering him a kingdom and it's the same thing with the devil the devil will offer you a kingdom he will offer you you could just be have or have a very small realm of a you know you just you could just be promoted to a certain job right or it'll just be a kingdom over but he will offer you some kind of kingdom if you will just sell your gift to him they meant but now we are not called to run Satan's Kingdom we are kings and priests to God so that means we have a Dominion we have a we have a rulership over God's kingdom or in God's kingdom so now Jesus knew that he had to die to redeem the kingdom know that this world to become the ruler of it and Satan will give you a kingdom without a birth yeah I mean without a death right because you have to die as well you follow me you have to die as well to receive a Dominion I meant but he will give you everything he can just without you dying because unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so Satan will offer you this world if he can just to keep you from meeting God amen and so he will offer you he will give you this message without a birth he will that pulse it though I understand all mysteries though I heal the second race it did have faith to move mountains if I have not charity which is divine love I have nothing I mean so he will offer you this message without a real birth but there has to be a death amen that's it's vital you have to be born again they say well that's all very elementary no it's not element oh it is it is vital amen amen yes sir now Jesus said that he would he had to redeem the world in order to to receive the kingdoms of this world now the new heavens and new earth is not everything's totally annihilated and God makes new ones and that way but it's a renovation of what's already here because then because the New Jerusalem is going to sit upon this earth when we are in eternity we're going to be walking upon this earth amen and so it's just like in second Peter 3 and 10 but the day the Lord will come as a thief in the night and which the heavens shall pass away which means change with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works are and shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking forward hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for the new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him and peace without spot and blameless now this word you hear and the Greek it actually means a freshness which is actually with which is in respect to age shall be made new again as and young again right it doesn't mean a new one isn't as a new buy a new car and you get rid of the old car that two different cars it's a renovation or making you or making young of what's already here we're going to walk here the streets of gold are here are going to be here yeah amen hallelujah so he will give you don't take Satan's cheap gimmick yes I mean whatever you do now to receive the kingdom of God is far greater than to receive a Dominion upon this world by Satan see my hero as I said is not some Sportster now I know we did a lot of work yesterday but be with me that fall asleep here we are amen amen come on amen now my hero created all things that's right see we were sitting around the dinner table that's what we say I come here was we're talking about how great it would be just to see him and be in the Millenium and have new bodies and we were getting excited Amen I mean we we were getting excited because it's a reality hallelujah but the greatest thing about that is I'm going to see him as he is a man because he is my hero Eliot my hero is not someone who who doesn't incredible whatever in sport of this world my hero walks to a grave of his friend that's been dead for days and your speaks his name it says come forth and and that body that was decaying and corrupt it comes back and the soul and spirit come back in the body and he walks out of the tomb that's my hero I mean my hero controls nature Hollyer my hero created the universe amen my hero hallelujah can transform the most broken lost decrepit soul amen into his image earlier that is my hair my hair I walk in humility I mean he wasn't all look at me I'm here to save the day no meek humble lowly came our Lord Jesus that's my hero I mean my hero heals the sick and raises the dead hallelujah my hero became flesh and walked upon this earth amen he became me he became he became what like me my kinsmen hallelujah to redeem me back to himself I mean when I could not go to where he was he came to me I'm in mud that's my hero I mean my hero put on flesh to understand the human battles that I have to enjoy hallelujah and my hero is my advocate amen he is my intercessor here's my mediator hallelujah he is my sacrifice now we're going to come to the two two birds soon okay but here's this is what this is my hero this is the one I idolized God himself Hey hallelujah now brother Brown would say that those in Jesus Christ the same y'all googled uh um you know the weakness of Christians now because our hero because heroes in the world they say I'm up here you can't become like me you'll never be as good as me you know people always debate what was the best rugby team and you know what era and stuff yeah because they say no these ones are better but my hero became lower than me to lift me up to where he was and he demonstrate it is power to show that the weakest of Christians can use the same weapon that he used to defeat Satan amen and it will defeat him so it doesn't matter how strong you think you are or how weak you think you are I mean but you have a god-given authority to use the same weapon that he did hallelujah so don't look at how how forget about how you feel your walkers do it just forget about it and just take I'll just read this Jesus Christ the same now when you go home this week study this where I'm going to quote from you just now because time won't permit me to read it all about next 10 minutes now notice when Jesus was here on earth this is my hero after he received the Father and to himself well we truly believe I am sure you southern people here believe that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself that he was divine and lady sometimes said to me he was just a prophet well if he's just a prophet rule lost he was deity God manifests in the flesh absolutely nothing less and Jehovah dwelling in a body his own son there by his great will he created a tabernacle a body virgin born that he lived it to express himself to the world through that body now we find him as soon as God came upon him he was anointed went into the wilderness and and out after 40 days defeated Satan by the Word of God what did he do he brought any divine promise and reach of the weakest of Christians any man I mean he brought every day he says any but I'll say every divine promise he brought it down to the weakest of believer that's right so it doesn't matter if you're feeling weak every divine promises have been brought down within your reach hallelujah if he was God why did he let Satan say if thou be the Son of God perform a miracle here and show me you can do it turn these stones into bread neatly see that's written man shall not live by bread alone so in a Satan always tries to coat the word went back and told him when he put him on a pinnacle of the temple of Genesis it's written he defeated Satan on the Word of God this is God's covenant with Abraham and his seed in 56 and he said it's also written a man and he took the father's word and defeated Satan right on his ground what did he do he was proving to the weakest of Christians that you can defeat Satan anywhere anytime on the plain word of God hallelujah amen this is Jesus Christ the same in 1955 Chicago you believe devil's recognize Christians certainly well the scripture I believe someplace says that the Devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of living God when you fall to your knees and prayer even the Devils tremble to the weakest of them hallelujah so it doesn't matter how strong or how victorious or whatever you feel you are amen God has brought down this is my hero now he brings everything in his arsenal and he's placed it down in your reach I believe that you can take the same weapon and whip the devil any place any time anywhere hallelujah we have that Amen that is our god-given right hallelujah I mean my hero took on all sin of the world upon himself says in 2nd Corinthians 5 and 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so he became me that I might become him by his grace hallelujah that's my hero how about now who's your hero today hallelujah my hero is not just a man of history amen he's not a hero of yesteryear but he's the same yesterday today and forever amen Jesus ran I'm sure you can agree let us run see we'll be so campus by this great cloud of witnesses let us run Jesus ran as us in the beginning we talked about the apostles I mean come all the way down through to to the ministry of the Prophet on this day a debugs say Jesus ran and then just conquer this world amen I know I've said it before but he just didn't conquer this world but he he took your sins on himself up to Calvary when to the two descended down to the last regions of hell took the keys of hell death in the grape he ran he ran through hell he preached the souls are imprisoned amen he actually preached them at church service amen they didn't just stand he went down took the keys of hell did the grave then he ascended on high Alleluia you have to be influenced I trust you're influenced by him amen Paul was a man who was very young he is very influenced it says in Philippians three and eight yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ you've got to count everything but dung I mean you've got to count everything in life but time that you might win Christ amen you can't take you can't take your old life with you my brother Brown tells the story of the wise men going from the east to you got to find the you know find Jesus had been born and he dramatizes yo they're packing their camels and a guy puts his card table up there and he puts his whiskey drinks and all these different things and the cattle begins to buckle under the weight and then he realizes I can't take this with me because they throw up all the stuff he doesn't need and then then the other wise missus what are you doing he says I'm laying aside every weight and sin that so easily beset me because I'm going to run hey amen you can't take your old life you had a can of but done yes but Lord I did listen listen this you're to counter but dung Amen if the Apostle Paul who was up to here in religion yeah you talk about dedicated man before he met the Lord he's dedicated he's a Pharisee of the Pharisees that's not just a you know amateur-hour kind of walk he was dedicated his whole life was was was directed of that but he counted that but dung Amen Alleluia how about you oh my Amen now and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by by faith that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might obtain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I have already obtained either we're already perfect but I follow after that if that I may apprehend that for which also I'm every headed of Christ Jesus and in brethren I count not myself to be a pre I me to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind so forget the past move on I mean forget the past and move on amen and reaching forth unto those things which are before I pressed towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be dust minded and if in anything we are otherwise minded God shall reveal even this to you amen so Paul saying let this mind be in you hallelujah so here was the man who he was lifted up he said unto the third heavens and he saw things and things of spoken to him was so incredible he couldn't speak about it for about 15 years he says lest I being lifted above the revelation that I have received I mean he received a thought yo-yo a thorn of yo Satan to buffer him to keep him humble here was a man he says the dispensation of the gospel has been given to me you know when Paul was writing the New Testament he didn't just study it like many people study the Bible today and look at and look in the Old Testament all this sounds pretty neat this kind of relates and then old you know write a letter he received divine inspiration a mint you know he received divine inspiration and he pinned it down he sent it to the churches he God took the gift in his life and he any any place law and grace exactly how it should it be here was it was the Apostle Paul but he says that I want to ever ahead that which is that has apprehended me amen so he saw Jesus I say he saw him run we've all been influenced you've seen someone run 100 I want to be come back you know where you see your favorite team win and then you look yo you know it's like you know when the All Blacks wouldn't it heaps of more kids start playing rugby because they get influenced by I mean so he saw he saw geez run and he wanted to and he said now that thing I want apprehend amen and I trust it's the same with you today you say well what does this got to do with us we're sitting at the end of all things the rapture could go just now Amy we have we have a part of this race to run Amy right we are to live another book of Acts yep we are not just here sitting back on the laurels and and the victories of yesteryear that's right right we're not called just to sit back and just to enjoy all the blessings that are being passed down from Calvary to now there's no where where to take what we have received and where to run with it Amy a way to influence those around us yes Alleluia now you take let's go back to Leviticus 14 again now these two birds that you know one was killed and the blood of blood of thee your your the blood of one the live one was dipped in it with hassel and cedarwood and scarlet and and and and hyssop they had to be the same kind of birth it wasn't a wasn't a turkey and a vulture or a turkey and a dove there were two doves yeah right and so the blood now now you just think about you just think about a live one yeah it would have been an incredible experience to be grabbed put into you know and and to be dipped in the blood of you did mate just think about this and then you're released into a into an open field so now the life that was once pulsating in your mate now is upon you and because the blood that was and the dead one now goes in a live one and in that live one takes the blood that was shed out into the world and so here we are this is the only way you can run as when the life of the Dead mate Jesus Christ comes into you by his word amen and then the power of that blood that was shed now you spread it upon the earth oddly imagine singing Bertha's dripping with blood flood you don't get your attention amen and should be the same thing with you and I the life that is within us I'm in the life that was within us amen should should be should be so visible and our character how we conduct ourselves I mean how we treat other people they should see something is different about these people I admit it's because now that same God that was in Jesus Christ out empties himself into the church because God's work is completed through his body right his workers plan of redemption is completed through you well does that mean I have to die no you don't have to die because he maybe he purchased our salvation but then he did to the disciples go into all the world preach the gospel why is that because what was done there in Jerusalem has to spread about upon the whole earth and how is God going to do it through his body or through the living mate that the blood has been dip I mean has been put upon yeah so all the healing all the salvation amen Redemption the power of the blood comes unto you I mean now remember we still have a bloody sacrifice at the 3rd of God and when and we will meet him in the air amen but the life that was released on Calvary from that blood comes into the believer and then we go out into the world amen Hey hallelujah slightly and so this is this is what we're cool to be hello let that now let that imagination grip you that God Himself could step down I'm really trying to preach to the kids I want to get all your attention amen amen because God if God could speak to Samuel and use him to change a nation God can speak to you and you can change this world you're never too young hallelujah never too old either a marry me Alleluia God wants to use us to shake this world now let's go to revelations 19 and 1 I just want to read this now it says revelations 19 to 1 after these things which is the destruction of of the to Babylon so is the destruction of Rome destruction of Los Angeles going into the city I mean I mean into the Seekers once burn with fire never ones like a millstone thrown into the sea slides in after these things I heard a great voice I just say one thing what you're feeding on you know your your we are reflecting other two worlds you're either a reflection of heaven oh you're a reflection of hell and it's what you're feeding on shows really where your sweet where your treasures are laid up a mess I mean so if your treasures are laid up upon this world and entertainment could be sport it could be chasing the dollar could be chasing some image of some successful person could be anything of that if you're chasing those things your treasures are upon the earth that's right and that now is going to perish I meant where your treasures are laid up that's where your heart is you know believe it how can how can yo God takes us just as we are but we've got to come through his provided way otherwise there'd be all kinds of spirits in heaven yeah revelations 91 and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power and the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which they commit Krupp the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said Alleluia and a smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that said on the throne saying amen Alleluia and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and you that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were a great were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth amen let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready how isn't a good we can live out that scripture and for her and to her was granted she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb hello blessed people and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him and he said unto me si doubt not I'm our fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy so now there's a great multitude in heaven and as the voice of many waters and the voice of mighty thunderings saying I'll Lou you for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth now we're on the book of Revelation that uh that that waters as peoples multitude nations and tongues so it's a it's a voice of many people right it's a voice of many people crying out now we happen to be part of that voice of many waters program speaks it speaks that it says it's the ministry screaming out Amen but it's also now not everyone is called to preach but if one is called to live a sermon everyone is called to live a life I mean so it's not just it's not just the voice of the ministry crying out but it's the life that you live which is crying out as well hallelujah so now this is us he says let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and we get ready here I mean the word dresses us here hallelujah sir I trust you're ready this morning amen amen and then some but notice now the voice as it's also as the voice of mighty thunderings now I'm going to read a couple of things just going back to the speckled bird don't know just bear with me a bit longer he settled down he settled right down here the bottom of the river there at the Ohio River and it is John the Baptist was sent to get a message ready for the word to be made manifest so will your message now dr. Davis and them caught me out of my mind wanted to turn me out the church because I disagree with them on women preachers and those things that was on Scripture he says and you say you're going to preach and cause a revival to strike the world I said not me but he said so he said Billy you had a nightmare I said I'll give up my card right now I'm I'm no more of you he said he he said I believe it word by word for here is the word see and the word does that knows the secrets of the heart is that right all right proves it in Hebrews 13:8 and he will have a bright Church ready in the last days how is he going to do it brother Brown I don't know but he said he would he'll he'll prove it I called out from all others that's right the speckled bird that speckled by his blood that's improving his work called out all the rest of the flocks against her she's despised and rejected but the speckled bird now I don't care how much the author wanted to disagree with that he's mistaken remember what did what did to the bird that's pickled it they taken to their mom was killed the mate and was poured up on the other bird as it was for a cleansing of leprosy and the specks of blood and cried holy holy holy unto the Lord and that was our mate Jesus Christ which was killed and his blood came upon us crying holy holy holy unto the Lord all the rest of the birds I'm glad my name's on her book not here on the earth Amen but up there not a goat skin but on lambskin that's right there will be a resurrection of the dead he'll confirm it that's right he'll prove it there'll be a rapture of the church how is it going to be I don't know but he'll prove it his words true there'll be a millennium he'll prove it it's his word there'll be new heavens and new earth he'll prove it because it's word said so and only the righteous will be there he'll prove it too that's right only the ones that's been made part of this word see will be there part of their position in the word for their age will be the only ones will be there cause that's just what it is it says word and then five different five different identifications of the true church and you glad tonight that your name is on the book what a beautiful thought I'm thinking concerning a great speckled bird and they say her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy work all the other birds flocking around her she's despised by all them what was that speckled bird I different with the guy who said it was wrong I said that was wrong what was this big bird of the Bible it was not Israel as they said it was it was the Church of Jesus Christ for a sin-offering what do they do they took a Turtledove pulled the head off one and turn it upside down poured the blood upon the living mate and turn the mate loose and the mate sprinkled it with the blood of the Dead may 20th sprinkling as he fluids wings and the blood splashing upon the earth quite holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto Lord it was a type of Christ and the great speckled bird is the church that's been speckled by the blood birds did make the Savior Jesus Christ and she's crossing the world today flopping her wings crying holy holy holy unto the Lord amen that's us now we are the voice of many waters and also a voice of great thunderings and brother Branham we preachers revelations chapter 4 he says now he says what we need I'll just read this we need men of God who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you call to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and that's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it they said no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet Living if there ever was a man of God that's the man or that woman seen live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher get all mixed up anyhow messed up and you get the people tangled up and they won't know you'll ruin them and yourself to just live your sermon the preachers called the preachers and to live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your Swimming's alright now here was voices Oh what we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voice --is the thunder of God thundering out and sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump up how much you can do this or that or sharp but what hurts the devil now who wants to the devil espanish amen what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified Holy life consecrated to God say anything to them call them anything just as sweet as can be and move right on oh my that throws them away that's the thunder that shakes the devil just like well you say if he could preach like Billy Graham or all Robert Shaw or somebody a great influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that and nothing you get all the theology you wanted to and all the seminary training and the devil just sits back and laughs at it but when he sees that life look at those disciples down to that maniac child that day with leprosy saying come out of him devil come out of him devil come out of them devil the devil sitting there now ain't you making a pretty shame of yourself now you see what you're doing Jesus told you he commissioned you to come and cast me out and not one of you can do it but brother when they seen him come one come walking quietly oh my he didn't have to say nothing that devil was already scared right then he knowed he had to leave that's right because here come a life not a sermon but a life said come out of him oh my that done it quietly no doubt he knew what he was doing hallelujah that's what hurts the devil on the stake yeah amen we need thousands of low voices when I live in Jeffersonville we live in Wellington what we need today is thousands of live voices or however many a place the number here of live or that is what shakes the devil amen we want to be let him influence you what do you caught up with today just think about it doesn't matter how old or young we're all caught up by something our imagination has been captured by something why don't you just let be the eternal one I make we have some musicians to come are you influenced by hem who ran amen who's influenced by the school by some religion let's live this life for him Amen know what's going on it'll be worth it all I mean when we see Jesus it'll be worth it all all the trials will mean all the hardship will seem so little once we get to the end of the way amen brother Branham II tried to describe what it was like beyond the curtain time he says it so sublime it's so wonderful words can't even can't even describe how great it is you know heaven is just not just some nice peaceful place like we think yeah it's far greater heaven is far greater than even the nicest place it's far greater than just being a camp that's right way yeah it's way more than just being in a camp atmospheres only believers around that's what it's a spa supreme and once we step that first few seconds I meant when when you see the dead in Christ rise all everything else seems so little hey they're going to rise that's right amen and they're going to make themselves known because they're going to come to tell you it's on that's right what you've been looking for for however many is is happening right now hallelujah you know I said to brother Chris we're cutting wood I see one day it could be very likely he's the Liam crying there's boys Go Daddy it becomes a D I'm expecting that though that is not crazy I'm expecting my girls to because because they will be merry little Sharon rose was a baby you know she dies and in the brother Brahim actually goes beyond the couldn't of time there Sisu she he doesn't even recognize her she's 18 to 21 hey daddy you know mommy's waiting for you up at the house during a girl fancy alive conscious of what's going on glory amen so I'm expecting my girls Amy Begay beuliss it'll be my that should be up here and that will be the greatest moment that will be the greatest moment of life will be that moment I mean when you see the dead in Christ rose because they want to take members older they're going to walk with us they're gonna shake your hand saying we're going to hallelujah we've been waiting for this day you know you know death doesn't change your attitude or your ambition so john wesley brother brown you you take any of your heroes through the any of your great Christian heroes that you know about they'll be exactly the same as when they died is when they come back alive again hallelujah and they'll come walk by us amen I tell you what it's going to be the loop we just won't say praise God we're going amen good thing is we'll have new body so we can't we can't lose our voices hey Olivia and so just keep you say well life's king pretty hard I don't know how things are going to work out just keep that before you because all of the hardship of life will seem so little oh yeah once you get to that moment and you know in about 40 days we're all going to meet him up in the air you see the Lord in his glory coming down hallelujah because he doesn't stand on this he hasn't put his feet upon this earth at that coming and he puts his feet upon the earth when he comes to the Jews we meet him halfway amen hallelujah everything you'll see maybe I'm so glad you and you'll be so thankful thank you lord I saw you run hey Thank You Laura's influenced by you yeah thank you Lord I gave my will to you and all the hardship and maybe hunger and whatever it'll seem so little do you think about it you say well you're just imagining things know one day it's going to happen that's right amen and when I think about those things I just want to praise them more amen say thank you Lord that you would allow me to be part of the greatest event since Calvary as now the fullness of redemption has come the change in the body the power that's chump change your bodies is here amen there's power and the Holy Ghost in us to change you change these atoms my brother actually one day there will be a sweet come over the church here we are before you realize what will be you'll be a lot younger before you even realize how lujah brother Brown was lying on his bed he's about 50 this is well if I going to do anything the Lord I better do it now the voice said you want to see parts occurred in the time Oh before he knew he was there he was there that's right before he realizes he know what's going on my buddies he did he was taken before you even realize amen and that friends it's a reason that that that happened in his ministry because because God wanted us to know it's more real than this world it's greater than the best day of your life that you've ever had times of bye Billy and it's still greater than oh and all the hardship and the sacrifice and the and the traveling and the prayer and the you know and the rejection by people and the being misunderstood by people of all the things all the approach will not mean a single foot Hey amen it will be worth it all do we have that we don't have this I'm doing it do we noticing it it will be worth it all when we see Jesus okay I promise you it it's greater than you can imagine amen so let's now I think these the words of brother Isaac I might I might get the koi drop but he said when he gets over there he wants to actually you could say rest because he's been laboring here for the Lord he doesn't want to be rested up here and then just have another risk amen so I say let us work till Jesus comes amen because you'll see it in the scripture so Matthew 24 25 it goes you know Jesus talks about the signs of the end he goes to the wise and foolish virgin and that page talks about the about the servants there is the parable of the servant the master goes away and then then the servant is in charge things he delays his coming he begins to get drunk and smite as fellow servants what's that now people who lose sight of the Lord returning they get drunk with this world and then we're going to smite one another amen you go read it people who lose their vision when I pulled the loser version friends amen so a wise servant is found doing be found doing when he comes the brother man says you just keep doing what you're doing until he comes to take you away amen amen queer some words we need some Lissa you know can you sing it for us [Music]
