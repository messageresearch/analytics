[39:00] technology
[39:05] maybe it doesn't work i might need the
[39:06] clicker
[39:10] anyway we're going to go to genesis
[39:11] chapter 14
[39:13] verse 10.
[39:22] genesis 14 and 10
[39:27] i'm going to read down to verse 16.
[39:34] and the veil of sidom was full of slime
[39:38] pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah
[39:40] fled and fell there
[39:42] and they that remained fled to the
[39:44] mountain and they took all the goods of
[39:46] sodom and gomorrah and all their
[39:48] uh littles and went their way
[39:51] and they took a lot abraham's brother's
[39:53] son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and
[39:55] departed
[39:56] and there came one that had escaped and
[39:58] told abram
[39:59] the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of
[40:02] memory
[40:03] the amrite brother of ishkol and brother
[40:06] of
[40:09] uh and i'm sorry there's a um part of
[40:12] the pages taunts i can't um i don't have
[40:13] that were they
[40:14] and there and these were confederate
[40:16] with abram and when abram heard
[40:18] that his brother uh and abram
[40:22] and when abram heard that his brother
[40:24] was taken captive he armed his trained
[40:26] servants born in his own house
[40:28] 318 and pursued them unto dan and he
[40:30] divided himself against them he
[40:32] and his servants by night and smote them
[40:34] and pursued them unto
[40:36] uh hoba which is on the left side of
[40:38] damascus and he brought back all
[40:40] i like that word brought back all the
[40:42] goods and also brought again his brother
[40:44] lot and his goods and the woman also
[40:47] and the people amen and now we're going
[40:50] to go to
[40:53] you know you rely on technology to
[40:55] update but doesn't update so
[40:57] um do i have it here
[41:02] okay this is oh yes first samuel 30 and
[41:04] verse 1.
[41:06] okay that's different to this but it's
[41:07] meant to be the same
[41:10] we'll get there one day with something
[41:12] may we just go old school just be
[41:13] unplugged and
[41:14] you know maybe life was simpler that way
[41:18] wasn't it
[41:20] first time you're 30 and verse 1. now
[41:22] there's a pattern with these two
[41:24] there's a reason i'm reading these and
[41:26] it came to pass when david and his men
[41:27] were come to ziglag on the third day
[41:29] that the amalekites had invaded the
[41:31] south and zigleg
[41:32] and smitten zigleg and burned it with
[41:34] fire and had taken the woman captives
[41:37] that were therein
[41:38] they slew not any neither great or small
[41:40] but carried them away and went on their
[41:42] way
[41:42] so david and his men came to the city
[41:44] and behold it was burned with fire
[41:46] and their wives and their sons and their
[41:48] daughters were taken captives
[41:50] then david and the people that were with
[41:52] him lifted up their voice and wept until
[41:54] they had no more power to weep
[41:56] and david's two wives were taking
[41:58] captives
[42:01] the jezreelitis and abigail the wife of
[42:03] nabal the carmelite
[42:05] and david was greatly distressed for the
[42:08] people spake of stoning him because
[42:10] the soul of all the people was grieved
[42:12] every man for his sons
[42:14] and for his daughters but david
[42:16] encouraged himself from the lord his god
[42:18] what a great powerful secret that is
[42:19] right there
[42:20] and david said to abetha the priest uh
[42:22] ahimalaksha's son
[42:24] i pray thee bring me hither the ephod
[42:26] and abitha brought hither the ephod to
[42:28] david
[42:28] and david inquired of the lord saying
[42:30] shall i pursue after this troop shall i
[42:32] overtake them
[42:33] and he answered him don't you love when
[42:35] god answers
[42:36] pursue for thou shall overtake them and
[42:39] without fail recover
[42:41] all there's that word again amen now
[42:44] let's just
[42:45] bow our heads and word of prayer tonight
[42:46] amen in his presence we
[42:48] amen lord jesus we lord as um
[42:52] lord we approach you with such
[42:53] thanksgiving and joy in our hearts but

[44:12] i'm going to need that clicker please
[44:14] it'll be real here we go
[44:16] awesome thank you very much now if i
[44:18] could title this tonight i want to speak
[44:20] about
[44:22] you know brother brown uses the
[44:23] expression it may sound a bit of a crude
[44:25] expression for a sermon title but
[44:26] a chip off the old block now we know
[44:30] that god has
[44:31] god has uh um attributes he has
[44:33] characteristics and
[44:34] and you know if just like a natural
[44:37] family
[44:37] you know there's characteristics that
[44:39] are passed down you know maybe a
[44:40] temperament maybe a way people speak
[44:42] maybe how they look you know
[44:44] you can see your family you know you
[44:46] know you know when you see children
[44:47] maybe you've never met the parents
[44:48] before but as soon as you meet the
[44:50] parents you say i know where you came
[44:51] from speaking to the children you know
[44:52] so there's
[44:53] so there's you know and and there's
[44:54] expression they're just a chip off the
[44:56] old block so
[44:57] as the old black block was or is so they
[45:00] are
[45:01] i mean so now we read here because
[45:03] abraham we know is the father of of
[45:05] of of the israelite people you know of
[45:07] the jewish race
[45:08] and we can see as you know as we look
[45:10] down through the scripture
[45:11] if you study you know the attributes
[45:13] that are in abraham you'll see them you
[45:15] know
[45:15] down through israel you know you know he
[45:17] was he was a priest we see that in the
[45:19] tribe of levi
[45:20] you know he was he was a mighty
[45:22] conqueror just like in david that's why
[45:24] you know we read the scripture here
[45:25] because as as
[45:27] um as abraham
[45:30] you know was yes
[45:33] yeah i'm sorry there we go
[45:38] as abraham was anointed you know we know
[45:40] that he was not a military man he did
[45:42] not have a professional army
[45:43] you know the you know he just armed his
[45:45] servants and they and they were
[45:46] but but yeah i believe they are anointed
[45:48] by god to to get locked back
[45:51] so everything that you know because we
[45:52] know lot was a part of abraham he was
[45:54] his family and and
[45:56] god allowed abraham you know abraham at
[45:58] this time to go
[45:59] get his nephew and everything that the
[46:01] enemy had taken away and and this is an
[46:03] attribute
[46:04] in the people of god you know when i
[46:06] talk about chips off the old block i'm
[46:07] really talking about you and i you know
[46:09] we should be able to look into the
[46:10] scripture
[46:11] and see the characteristics of the
[46:12] believer and see that same life is now
[46:14] in me
[46:15] i am in the same you know it's more than
[46:16] income paper now it's put on flesh and
[46:18] you and i
[46:19] so we can see that you know there's a
[46:21] reason that that that that abram was
[46:23] built this way is because god was
[46:25] expressing a part of himself
[46:27] and he's also expressing the same nature
[46:29] that was in him amen is in future
[46:31] generations you know just like
[46:32] abram you know when they went down they
[46:34] back slit a couple of times they went
[46:36] down into grey they went down to egypt
[46:37] and your abram would tell sarah
[46:39] you know tell them just you tell a lie
[46:41] you know say that we are brother and
[46:42] sister which
[46:43] kind of they work as they are half
[46:44] brother and sister but they were married
[46:46] and
[46:46] you know isaac did the same thing the
[46:48] next generation did the same thing and
[46:50] you know but but there's also positive
[46:51] attributes that are passed down
[46:53] and because we know in our flesh in our
[46:56] own humanity we will never manifest
[46:58] god's attributes but it takes the spirit
[47:01] of god a real new birth
[47:03] i mean the you know god living on the
[47:05] inside of the inside of us i mean if he
[47:07] comes and lives in
[47:08] us i mean then he will manifest his
[47:10] character manifest his attributes
[47:12] through our lives so so abram armed his
[47:16] servants
[47:16] and they recovered all hallelujah
[47:19] and we can see this now down into down
[47:22] into uh
[47:23] david's life where he came into a place
[47:25] of great distress
[47:26] you know but but you know and it says
[47:28] they wept until they had no more power
[47:30] to weep but you know
[47:31] he had a burden he must get his family
[47:33] back
[47:34] where did that come from that came from
[47:35] abram it was passed down a few
[47:37] generations but there he was in flesh
[47:39] again and
[47:40] what i love about the attributes of god
[47:41] is as you know the scripture tells us
[47:43] when the enemy comes in like a flight
[47:44] i'll raise up a standard
[47:46] so when the enemy raise up a flood i i
[47:48] mean raises up or comes in like a flood
[47:50] rather
[47:50] i mean god has an attribute upon the
[47:52] earth to meet the challenge of the day
[47:54] i mean to overcome in that challenge and
[47:56] and walk out victorious amen so
[47:58] we know david there's the challenge of
[48:00] goliath and we know who won that battle
[48:02] it was god's attribute against the
[48:04] devil's attribute and god's attribute
[48:06] won
[48:07] he he walked out packing the victory and
[48:08] it's the same thing where all their
[48:10] loved ones were taken you know but you
[48:12] know
[48:12] even even his own men were felt like you
[48:15] know this has just come to nothing
[48:16] you know this message we're following is
[48:18] just basically ruined our lives and
[48:20] we've just lost everything but
[48:21] david encouraged himself and the lord
[48:23] has gone and we must have such
[48:25] confidence it doesn't matter how good
[48:27] life is how bad life is
[48:29] how terrible life might be we just need
[48:31] to encourage ourselves in the lord
[48:32] i mean whatever the devil's stolen from
[48:34] us we have a right by the authority of
[48:36] god's word to go take it back
[48:38] i mean we don't have to live under our
[48:40] privileges we don't have to just become
[48:42] cold formal and powerless amen but we
[48:44] have a we have a right
[48:45] if our joy has been taken we can get
[48:47] that back if
[48:48] our peace that passes all understandings
[48:50] being taken we can get that back
[48:52] if our long-suffering nature is gone we
[48:54] can get that back
[48:55] hallelujah if our love is gone and we
[48:57] just have a critical spirit we just look
[48:58] at everyone say this person's wrong this
[49:00] person does this this
[49:01] we can get rid of that and get love back
[49:04] hallelujah
[49:05] i mean because if david could recover
[49:06] all we can recover all too
[49:08] and this is the hour for us to recover
[49:10] all
[49:12] hallelujah amen this is this is where we
[49:15] are so
[49:17] now i was telling you on sunday about
[49:19] mama eagle
[49:21] how she would display her power and and
[49:24] what
[49:24] what her burden was now i'm just trying
[49:26] to find my slide which isn't here but
[49:28] it's not there
[49:29] what her burden was or is is that her
[49:32] children would recognize the same life
[49:34] as in them
[49:35] and that's what god has been trying to
[49:37] do down through down through the you
[49:39] know
[49:39] ever since time began he's been wanting
[49:41] his sons and daughters to see
[49:43] the same life that's in me is and by a
[49:46] new birth in you
[49:47] i mean even even under the blood of
[49:48] bulls and goats i mean the believers did
[49:50] incredible things
[49:51] we know god has an attribute of a
[49:54] deliverer it's a characteristic of us he
[49:55] is a deliverer
[49:56] and so he comes down he speaks to moses
[49:59] because that characteristic was in moses
[50:00] that attribute was in moses but it had
[50:02] to come to life
[50:03] and everything that moses lacked the
[50:05] burning bush had he just had to step
[50:07] into that presence for just a few
[50:08] minutes and everything he needed in life
[50:10] i mean to overcome in his day came to
[50:12] life in him
[50:14] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[50:15] and i all we need is more of god
[50:17] that's all we really need we just need
[50:18] more of the holy ghost we need more of
[50:20] his word living on the inside of us you
[50:22] know
[50:22] we can try and work things out in our
[50:24] mind but really
[50:25] man has been trying that and we're going
[50:28] to have a nuclear war
[50:30] right so how's that working out it's not
[50:32] working out very good
[50:34] my bomb is bigger than your bomb well
[50:35] i'll fire my bomb before you fire your
[50:37] bomb well it's going to end up pretty
[50:38] bad
[50:39] that's man trying to work out trying to
[50:41] fix the world
[50:43] but we have something that's greater
[50:44] than than you know human reasoning
[50:47] we have the word of almighty god
[50:49] hallelujah
[50:50] and we must never ever lose confidence
[50:52] in our weapon
[50:53] when we must never forget who we are we
[50:56] must remember who we are
[50:57] we must get up in the morning i trust
[50:59] you do i don't but maybe we should start
[51:01] doing it so i'm a son of god
[51:02] or i'm a daughter of god lord you called
[51:05] me why do we pray in the morning
[51:06] we commit our ways into a into his hands
[51:09] do we not we say lord you're my shepherd
[51:11] you're my god
[51:12] i need you to be my shepherd today lead
[51:14] me through this day what are you
[51:15] declaring
[51:16] father i'm your child i need you to take
[51:17] me by the hand and lead me through the
[51:19] day
[51:19] i mean because if he leads us we're
[51:21] going to end up pretty good
[51:23] i'm not talking about him prosperity we
[51:25] can be homeless on the street but if you
[51:26] know him
[51:28] that's all we need really hallelujah now
[51:33] i don't know why this is not that
[51:38] if it's not i'll just blank that and
[51:40] i'll talk from this
[51:42] there we go now
[51:46] everyone loves to read romans 8.
[51:49] and we know that all things work
[51:50] together for good for them that love god
[51:52] and to them who are called according to
[51:53] his purpose i'll say
[51:54] if this message has found you you've
[51:56] been called according to his purpose
[51:58] so many people love him but we're also
[52:00] called according to his purpose because
[52:01] remember his purpose of the hour is to
[52:03] call the bride and take her in a rapture
[52:05] that's god's program today hallelujah
[52:08] and for them he did for no he did also
[52:10] predestinate to be conformed to the
[52:12] image of his son
[52:13] that he might be the firstborn among
[52:16] many brethren so
[52:17] if he has you know if he has foreknown
[52:20] us
[52:20] he has predestinated us to be conformed
[52:23] to the image of his son now we know the
[52:25] image of his son is his word
[52:27] so god has predestinated us that our
[52:29] endpoint will be will be conformed to
[52:31] the image
[52:32] of his word so so it goes from ink on
[52:34] paper
[52:35] into flesh so what you read about a
[52:37] believer should be in here
[52:39] you should see it living in you because
[52:41] that's a person that's been conformed to
[52:42] his image it's more than just quoting
[52:44] scripture quoting quotes but it's a life
[52:46] lived
[52:47] hallelujah amen so we have an input so
[52:50] so if we're conformed to be the image of
[52:52] his son we're going to be a chip off the
[52:53] old block
[52:55] hallelujah amen and i believe i'm
[52:58] looking at a few chips
[53:00] glory if the lord says i'm something
[53:03] i'll say
[53:05] yeah amen i'm told before i am
[53:08] if he told me a certain thing if he says
[53:09] he loves me with an unfailing love amen
[53:12] i'm loved if i'm accepted in the beloved
[53:14] because he told me i
[53:15] i receive that i mean if he said he's
[53:17] washed all my sins away
[53:19] amen let it be unto me according to thy
[53:21] word lord
[53:22] hallelujah so he's building he's
[53:25] building he's taking chips off the old
[53:26] block and he's conformed then to be
[53:28] he's predestinated to be conformed to
[53:30] the image of his son
[53:32] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[53:34] he also
[53:35] called and whom he called them he also
[53:38] justified in whom he justified them he
[53:40] also
[53:41] glorified it's all done
[53:44] hallelujah now brother braham says in
[53:47] the masterpiece now for nearly 2
[53:49] 000 years god has been making him a
[53:51] masterpiece
[53:52] because he struck adam to get a piece
[53:54] off of him part of him a rip to make a
[53:56] wife for him
[53:57] now and now that perfect masterpiece
[53:59] that he struck at calvary he got a piece
[54:01] off of him
[54:02] it's just the new testament that's all
[54:04] he fulfilled the old testament
[54:06] now it's the new testament another piece
[54:08] to be fulfilled see the old and new as
[54:10] husband and wife see
[54:11] and it taken the taken the altar for
[54:14] show the new
[54:15] christ came the masterpiece to fulfill
[54:17] that now his bride will fulfill
[54:19] everything that's in the new testament
[54:21] another masterpiece in the making so
[54:24] when he's saying here that that you know
[54:26] this piece that came off him is just a
[54:27] new testament he's not just talking
[54:29] about income paper
[54:30] he's talking about living epistles read
[54:32] and known of all men hallelujah
[54:34] so he's saying now that there's another
[54:35] masterpiece in the making what is it
[54:37] it's a chip
[54:38] off the old block hallelujah
[54:41] i'm talking about you remember god wants
[54:44] us to know who we are because brother
[54:46] ram says when she recognizes who she is
[54:49] then the rapture will go because we need
[54:51] to and revelation gives us overcoming
[54:54] power over the devil
[54:55] i mean if you you know if we get in our
[54:57] minds that will never be victorious we
[54:59] won't be victorious
[55:00] you know if we're you know if we get in
[55:02] our minds that we can never overcome
[55:04] something we never will overcome it but
[55:06] if the word comes along and says no
[55:07] you're more than a conqueror through him
[55:09] that loved you i mean you're more than
[55:11] able i mean we're more than conquerors
[55:12] we're not just congress but more than
[55:14] conquerors
[55:14] so therefore anything that's fighting us
[55:16] we will overcome it
[55:18] hallelujah but if we have a failure
[55:20] mentality we'll be failures but if we
[55:22] have a victorious mentality
[55:24] and because brotherhood says the right
[55:25] mental attitude towards any promise that
[55:27] god will cause it to come to
[55:29] pass hallelujah so we want to have the
[55:31] right mental attitude towards the word
[55:34] and what's that right mental attitude
[55:36] lord it's for me you purchased it for me
[55:38] thank you lord it's on its way
[55:41] hallelujah
[55:43] amen because really it's not you that's
[55:45] going to fulfill the word in your life
[55:46] it's him
[55:47] but we we have to give ourselves to it
[55:50] amen now in pentecostal forgot
[55:55] or full gospel peoples around the world
[55:57] i find them with a great faith
[55:59] and the reason they have faith is
[56:01] because they have stepped up a little
[56:02] father
[56:03] they have been born of the spirit of god
[56:05] which is the supernatural
[56:06] and many people tell me brother brown as
[56:09] you get older you look like your dad
[56:10] well he's my dad that's the reason i
[56:12] look like him
[56:13] well now the same thing many things that
[56:16] we have
[56:17] that we uh we uh by a family strain
[56:20] like that to each other and then in the
[56:22] family strain of god
[56:24] we become born of the spirit of god we
[56:26] take on the nature of god
[56:28] which then we are the sons of god i mean
[56:31] so there's a family strain down through
[56:33] you can see the family tree and there's
[56:36] a common thread down through the family
[56:38] tree what is it
[56:39] faith in the word of god for their day
[56:42] amen
[56:43] oh look that's why abraham he staggered
[56:45] not at the promise of god
[56:47] i mean through unbelief his own body was
[56:50] dead sarah's body was dead they couldn't
[56:51] have a child but he didn't stagger at
[56:53] those things
[56:54] he took the word of god above how he
[56:56] felt what he saw i mean what he knew
[56:59] you feeling yeah are you following me he
[57:02] took the word above those things and
[57:04] counted that
[57:04] as not and took the word of god said no
[57:06] we're going to have the child
[57:08] hallelujah amen and because sarah was
[57:12] part of the promise
[57:13] god visited them himself i mean and gave
[57:16] her faith
[57:17] to then then she could judge him
[57:18] faithful and then they had the promised
[57:20] son
[57:22] hallelujah amen now that you know that's
[57:25] why when you read hebrews 11 what is it
[57:27] it's like a family tree and there's
[57:28] common threads down by faith
[57:31] through faith hallelujah and then if the
[57:33] bible was continued to be written down
[57:35] through to this age and past
[57:37] you your name would be in there because
[57:40] why because it's now a book of acts is
[57:41] still being written
[57:42] by faith hallelujah by faith i overcame
[57:45] ladies by faith they walked with god
[57:47] like enoch remember there's a
[57:48] characteristic that was an enoch and
[57:49] elijah they took a rapture
[57:51] hallelujah and that same characteristic
[57:53] as in you and i
[57:55] hallelujah amen now the lord is that
[57:59] spirit and where the spirit of the lord
[58:00] is there is liberty
[58:02] but we all with open face beholding as
[58:06] in the glass
[58:07] of glass the glory of the lord are
[58:08] changed into the same image from glory
[58:10] to glory
[58:11] even as by the spirit of the lord so
[58:13] we're beholding something
[58:15] and it's transforming us the world is
[58:17] beholding something and is deforming
[58:19] them
[58:20] but the bride is beholding something and
[58:22] they're being transformed
[58:24] what is it the word of god now this word
[58:27] where there is liberty
[58:29] it does not mean you're free to do
[58:31] whatever you want as the as the modern
[58:33] church
[58:34] would like it to be i'm free because
[58:35] jesus forgave me and you know his blood
[58:38] means i can just keep sinning and
[58:39] everything's fine that's not what it
[58:40] means
[58:41] i meant yo that's actually a catholic
[58:43] idea instead of them paying for it
[58:46] you know like that you know that's why
[58:47] martin luther was so outrageous because
[58:49] people are going around
[58:50] you know selling novenas or whatever
[58:51] it's called which is basically i will
[58:53] pay the priest a certain amount of money
[58:55] then i can go do a sin but it's already
[58:56] been forgiven so if i had the
[58:58] right amount of money i could actually
[59:00] pay for sin and i'm going to go murder
[59:01] someone
[59:02] but i've already paid for the sin so
[59:04] then i can go do the sit and then you
[59:05] know
[59:06] that's why he's so outraged and they all
[59:08] did it to build big churches
[59:13] yep so you know yeah it's you know it's
[59:15] like an insurance policy
[59:17] you can't get in trouble because you've
[59:18] already been forgiven
[59:20] but it's all premeditated and and the
[59:22] people instead of taking the physical
[59:23] money they say well the blood of jesus
[59:24] christ is that way
[59:26] but if the blood of jesus christ ever
[59:27] comes upon you it'll change your nature
[59:29] that you have no desire to do those
[59:30] things amen that's what grace is grace
[59:33] is a divine influence upon the life i
[59:35] mean
[59:35] uh you know a divine influence upon the
[59:37] heart and it's reflection in the life if
[59:39] you go look at the strong concordance
[59:40] meaning
[59:41] hallelujah so if you say if someone's
[59:43] really under grace they'll be living the
[59:44] word of god because the divine influence
[59:46] of his word has come upon the heart
[59:48] has been reflected in the life so this
[59:50] word liberty the root meaning
[59:53] it means unrestrained which means to go
[59:55] at pleasure means you can go
[59:56] if you want that is at a citizen um as a
[59:59] citizen and not a slave
[1:00:01] so so this liberty means that we're no
[1:00:04] longer slaves we're no longer bound but
[1:00:06] we can go as citizens
[1:00:08] hallelujah so we're no longer just
[1:00:10] slaves being being used by the devil
[1:00:12] made to do whatever he wants us to do
[1:00:14] but now we're citizens of a kingdom and
[1:00:16] there's the kingdom of our lord jesus
[1:00:17] christ we're free to go at liberty
[1:00:19] so we're no longer under the bondage of
[1:00:21] the devil but now we're we are
[1:00:22] sons and daughters of god in his kingdom
[1:00:26] hallelujah amen so where the spirit of
[1:00:29] the lord is there is that liberty
[1:00:32] hallelujah that's why we need more of
[1:00:33] the holy ghost all the time
[1:00:35] because because where that where the
[1:00:37] spirit lord goes from
[1:00:38] slavery comes in what happened with
[1:00:40] samson
[1:00:41] you know the spirit of god was upon him
[1:00:43] the philistines would come they just
[1:00:45] ended up dead and he was victorious
[1:00:47] but because he gave his heart to the
[1:00:49] wrong person he gave his heart to a
[1:00:50] woman not to god
[1:00:51] i mean then then the anointing left him
[1:00:53] because he revealed a secret to her
[1:00:56] what so he so he wasn't liberty because
[1:00:57] the spirit of the lord was there but now
[1:00:59] he went into bondage
[1:01:01] we want to continue to be free
[1:01:05] that's you know that's one thing we need
[1:01:07] you know we need to contend for liberty
[1:01:10] and the holy ghost
[1:01:12] hallelujah amen brother brahm says this
[1:01:15] is invisible union i know
[1:01:17] uh yeah i put it on the whatsapp but if
[1:01:19] you're married to christ christ is the
[1:01:20] word of god and saint john the first
[1:01:22] chapter said in the beginning was
[1:01:24] the word and the word was with god and
[1:01:26] the word was god and the same was made
[1:01:28] flesh and dwelt among us christ was the
[1:01:30] living word
[1:01:31] he always was the word he still is the
[1:01:33] word he always will be the word
[1:01:35] he was the only manifestation of the
[1:01:38] attributes of god for he was
[1:01:40] the son of god and any son
[1:01:44] is the attribute of his father and just
[1:01:46] as you were in the genes of your father
[1:01:48] in the body of your father
[1:01:49] when you when he was a young boy you
[1:01:51] were in him yet
[1:01:52] he could not have fellowship with you
[1:01:54] because he didn't know you
[1:01:55] then through the bedding grounds of a
[1:01:57] mother you were brought forth into the
[1:01:59] earth and be
[1:02:00] and become in the image of your father
[1:02:02] then he could have fellowship with you
[1:02:04] and so were you sons of sons of god and
[1:02:07] daughters of god
[1:02:08] before there's even a moon stars or a
[1:02:11] molecule
[1:02:12] you are sons and daughters of god for
[1:02:13] you are the only
[1:02:15] for you are only the physical
[1:02:16] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:02:18] in god at the beginning
[1:02:20] for there's only one form of eternal
[1:02:21] life and that was that was you before
[1:02:24] you know nothing about it neither did
[1:02:26] you know when you was in your earthly
[1:02:27] father
[1:02:28] but you are manifested you too in his
[1:02:31] image
[1:02:31] in the image of god you're made and
[1:02:34] you're manifested for the glory
[1:02:35] and the fellowship of god i mean so we
[1:02:38] are right now the bride is the physical
[1:02:40] manifestation of the attributes of god
[1:02:43] so what was in his mind is now in flesh
[1:02:47] just like david was in his mind abraham
[1:02:49] was in his mind all the believers down
[1:02:50] through the ages
[1:02:51] now we are here hallelujah so
[1:02:54] you know it's just like abraham would
[1:02:56] speak of levi he says
[1:02:58] as i may so say levi also who receive
[1:03:01] tithes paid tithe in abraham
[1:03:03] for he was yet in the loins of his
[1:03:05] father when melchizedek met him so
[1:03:07] paul is not saying figuratively he's
[1:03:09] saying literally levi was in abraham
[1:03:11] when he paid tithes and that was
[1:03:13] attributed to levi
[1:03:16] hallelujah so he's saying literally levi
[1:03:18] was an abraham
[1:03:19] and it was attributed to to levi even
[1:03:22] though levi knew nothing about it
[1:03:23] it's the same thing with you and i why
[1:03:25] is the cross become a reality
[1:03:28] i mean because the lord the bride was in
[1:03:30] him when he went to calvary
[1:03:31] and he purchased our salvation that day
[1:03:33] on calvary and so that sacrifice is now
[1:03:36] attributed to you
[1:03:38] hallelujah that's why it becomes more
[1:03:41] than a story
[1:03:42] more than an isa becomes a reality my my
[1:03:45] lord jesus literally died on calvary
[1:03:47] took my sins far away
[1:03:49] living he loved me dying he saved me
[1:03:51] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:03:53] rising he justified me freely forever
[1:03:55] one day he's coming a glorious day
[1:03:58] hallelujah
[1:04:01] amen so levi was a priest
[1:04:04] abraham in his life was a priest
[1:04:08] he gave spiritual sacrifices to god so
[1:04:10] the attribute of a priest
[1:04:12] and abraham went down into levi
[1:04:15] hallelujah now if we're chips off the
[1:04:16] old block we need to see what the old
[1:04:18] block does
[1:04:20] amen because the old block that i'm
[1:04:22] talking about has nothing bad in it
[1:04:25] you turn it you know it's the pearl of
[1:04:27] great price the scripture talks about
[1:04:29] hallelujah he's incredible block
[1:04:32] hallelujah you know this may sound very
[1:04:34] simple but you know i'm just so happy
[1:04:36] i'm a son of god
[1:04:37] i'm so glad he's my father that means
[1:04:40] more than life itself to me
[1:04:42] hallelujah now as abraham was was
[1:04:45] determined he was going to get locked
[1:04:46] back
[1:04:47] he got locked back and that same
[1:04:50] attribute of being a deliverable went
[1:04:51] into david you know it went into others
[1:04:53] but it came
[1:04:54] down into david and he was determined
[1:04:55] i'm going to get everything back
[1:04:57] no doubt he made a list i remember a few
[1:04:59] years ago i think it was now
[1:05:01] i said make a list make a list of
[1:05:04] everything the devil's taken from you or
[1:05:05] what you want
[1:05:07] make that list and then now what does
[1:05:10] that do
[1:05:10] it gives you a purpose because many
[1:05:13] times in life we wander along and the
[1:05:14] weeks
[1:05:15] all blend into the same and the seasons
[1:05:17] just roll around and
[1:05:18] life seems almost meaningless but it's
[1:05:20] not meaningless even
[1:05:22] joseph down in prison saw there was a
[1:05:24] purpose he was down there
[1:05:25] he didn't he may not have understood the
[1:05:27] day-to-day but he had a couple of dreams
[1:05:29] that said he was gonna
[1:05:31] he was gonna come to a place of
[1:05:32] authority that his own family was gonna
[1:05:34] bow down to him and he no doubt saw that
[1:05:37] that this was somehow the fulfillment of
[1:05:38] that dream it was in motion
[1:05:41] so so so he lived with purpose right he
[1:05:43] wasn't just floating along in prison
[1:05:44] saying was me
[1:05:46] no he went into action and it should be
[1:05:48] the same thing with you and i
[1:05:50] you know the rapture's a revelation i
[1:05:52] trust has been revealed to you this
[1:05:53] body's going to get changed
[1:05:55] hallelujah it may be today
[1:05:58] i love you today hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:01] you know that's actually a revelation
[1:06:02] this thing's going to change
[1:06:04] and if i go by the way the grave this
[1:06:06] ain't staying there
[1:06:08] yeah i heard brother brown i'm talking
[1:06:09] about yo he's among the full gospel
[1:06:11] businessman he's talking today about
[1:06:13] assurance
[1:06:14] you know what yeah yeah yeah he's asked
[1:06:17] the question what do you do
[1:06:19] assurance you know what business
[1:06:20] assurance oh really where's the
[1:06:22] headquarters of this company he says
[1:06:23] glory
[1:06:25] the guy doesn't really understand what
[1:06:26] he's talking about he says blessed
[1:06:27] assurance jesus is mine and
[1:06:29] you know another insurance guy said no
[1:06:30] but billy that won't get you into the
[1:06:32] cemetery but he says it'll it'll get me
[1:06:34] out
[1:06:34] and that's the kind of policy i want
[1:06:36] hallelujah and if you haven't taken one
[1:06:38] of these eternal life policies
[1:06:40] i encourage you with everything within
[1:06:41] you get one hallelujah
[1:06:44] because that's all that's going to
[1:06:45] matter that's right hallelujah so now
[1:06:49] david david got all as i said
[1:06:52] write a list if you haven't written that
[1:06:54] list write it everything
[1:06:56] children family everyone in church
[1:06:59] neighbors work colleagues write it down
[1:07:02] fruits of the spirit everything just
[1:07:04] write a list
[1:07:05] and then seek the lord say lord you see
[1:07:07] this list this is my inheritance
[1:07:09] is it not the word says our children our
[1:07:11] inheritance
[1:07:12] hallelujah repent and be baptized name
[1:07:14] the lord jesus christ for the remission
[1:07:16] of sin you shall receive the gift of the
[1:07:17] holy ghost
[1:07:18] for the promise unto you and your
[1:07:19] children hallelujah
[1:07:21] so if i've got one part of that promise
[1:07:23] i want the second part because it's all
[1:07:24] part of the same promise
[1:07:26] hallelujah so now that will give you
[1:07:28] purpose in life
[1:07:31] amen it'll actually give you purpose
[1:07:33] because joseph's life was fixed around
[1:07:34] two dreams
[1:07:36] his whole life was fixed around these
[1:07:38] two dreams and that that's what drove
[1:07:40] him day by day
[1:07:41] and if we have a purpose then our life
[1:07:44] will actually be focused you know this
[1:07:45] you know this
[1:07:46] this ages and age of just you can just
[1:07:48] be so distracted
[1:07:51] so distracted in this life yeah there's
[1:07:53] so many different voices so many things
[1:07:55] you know you know the internet is just a
[1:07:59] vast big i don't know
[1:08:00] i don't know the stats of how many new
[1:08:02] videos are uploaded onto youtube every
[1:08:04] day
[1:08:04] it's a lot of viewing time it's a lot of
[1:08:07] viewing it's not just one or maybe 100
[1:08:09] videos
[1:08:09] it's like i don't know it's crazy but
[1:08:11] you know so you could spend and
[1:08:13] i and i don't recommend it but someone
[1:08:15] could spend literally about a hundred
[1:08:17] lifetimes
[1:08:18] trying to watch everything up there but
[1:08:20] it's so vast and it just gets greater
[1:08:22] and greater and greater
[1:08:22] it's just a distraction but what's our
[1:08:25] what's
[1:08:26] what's our motivating factor you know
[1:08:29] brother isaac could probably say this
[1:08:30] better than me but you know normally
[1:08:31] well
[1:08:32] i might be totally wrong but you know
[1:08:34] actors before they play a scene
[1:08:36] sometimes they ask what's my motivation
[1:08:39] what's my vote
[1:08:40] what's my motivation for this scene and
[1:08:42] then the director will say well this has
[1:08:43] got to happen this and this and you've
[1:08:45] read the script and this is how i want
[1:08:46] it to be and
[1:08:47] you know and and that should be the
[1:08:48] question we should ask ourselves
[1:08:50] lord he's a great director isn't he he's
[1:08:52] given you a role
[1:08:54] you're not a tree in the corner on the
[1:08:55] stage you're actually the main event
[1:08:57] harley just like esther and all you know
[1:08:59] i love watching plays of bible dramas
[1:09:02] because you know what's going to happen
[1:09:04] but then you enjoy it
[1:09:05] unfolding you know and you know no doubt
[1:09:06] the audience they know what's going to
[1:09:08] happen
[1:09:09] you know if we you know if we put a play
[1:09:11] on if the youth put a play on
[1:09:13] i know joseph or moses or ruth or
[1:09:15] anything
[1:09:16] we would all come watch it even though
[1:09:18] we know what's going to happen
[1:09:20] we know there's not going to we know
[1:09:21] when the plot twists come we know when
[1:09:22] the villain comes you know when the
[1:09:24] villain gets defeated we know when the
[1:09:25] lord over
[1:09:26] intervenes we know all those things but
[1:09:28] we're excited because we want to watch
[1:09:30] what was in the mind of the director is
[1:09:31] now going to be put in flash hallelujah
[1:09:34] maybe we have our ideas how it's going
[1:09:36] to be or should be but really it's the
[1:09:37] mind of the director that actually comes
[1:09:39] out
[1:09:39] hallelujah it's the same thing you know
[1:09:40] we have a great director or brother man
[1:09:42] called a great composer
[1:09:44] and he has a script and he's called you
[1:09:46] to a role
[1:09:47] you're not the villain of the play
[1:09:49] you're not the lady i've seen in the
[1:09:50] play
[1:09:51] you're the bride of christ in the play
[1:09:53] hallelujah and he's built you
[1:09:55] to play that role you know you hear
[1:09:57] people famous stars they say you know
[1:09:59] they play a certain role and they
[1:10:00] you know people say they were born to
[1:10:02] play that role
[1:10:03] they you know how they look and how they
[1:10:05] speak and how they act is just
[1:10:06] yeah it's just like they were made for
[1:10:08] that role we're made for a role
[1:10:11] as the bride of christ we're made for a
[1:10:13] role we may not feel like it
[1:10:15] some days but we're we're built for a
[1:10:17] role joseph was built for a role that
[1:10:19] life would be preserved
[1:10:20] when it was needed to be preserved
[1:10:22] hallelujah so we should really say
[1:10:24] what's our motivation in life i tell you
[1:10:27] if you write a list
[1:10:28] that'll give you a purpose hallelujah
[1:10:32] now i'm not talking about what size
[1:10:33] mentioned we're in a holiday house here
[1:10:35] and this now i'm not talking about that
[1:10:36] on the list
[1:10:38] you know i'm talking about redemption
[1:10:40] what people being saved
[1:10:42] healing coming you know reconciliation
[1:10:44] coming whatever it may be those kind of
[1:10:45] things
[1:10:46] hallelujah amen we're here for a role
[1:10:50] we're here for a purpose
[1:10:51] yes
[1:10:55] he therefore that minister ministereth
[1:10:58] to you the spirit and worketh miracles
[1:11:00] among you
[1:11:01] doth he do it by the works of the law or
[1:11:03] by hearing of faith
[1:11:05] even as abraham believed god and was
[1:11:06] accounted to him for righteousness
[1:11:08] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:11:11] faith the same with the children of
[1:11:12] abraham
[1:11:13] and the scriptures foreseeing that god
[1:11:15] would justify the heathen through faith
[1:11:18] hallelujah i uh yeah i read things i'm
[1:11:22] like he's talking about me
[1:11:23] i was a heathen i got justified by faith
[1:11:27] hallelujah i like you know simple things
[1:11:30] make me happy
[1:11:32] anyway preach before the gospel unto
[1:11:35] abraham saying
[1:11:36] in thee shall all nations be blessed so
[1:11:38] then they which be of faith are blessed
[1:11:41] with faithful abraham so they who are of
[1:11:44] the household of faith are blessed with
[1:11:46] faithful abraham
[1:11:47] abraham got lot and everyone back yes
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:50] hallelujah we have the same ability now
[1:11:54] we don't have to go get arms and get
[1:11:55] knives and guns and go you know that's
[1:11:57] not what we're talking about but there's
[1:11:58] demon powers that are hell-bent on
[1:12:00] destroying you and i
[1:12:02] they are you know the devil's got
[1:12:03] purpose in this hour he know he he knows
[1:12:05] he has but a short space of time
[1:12:08] he knows his time is coming so he's
[1:12:10] putting everything into overdrive that's
[1:12:11] why this world is
[1:12:12] falling apart so rapidly everything is
[1:12:15] in motion
[1:12:16] and the end times has been coming for a
[1:12:18] long time
[1:12:20] this thing that we see in the world
[1:12:22] right now has been 400 500 years in the
[1:12:24] making
[1:12:26] and here we are at the end of the end so
[1:12:28] if he is
[1:12:29] if he has got a purpose and a motivation
[1:12:33] and he's going to lose how much those
[1:12:36] who are going to win
[1:12:38] hallelujah you know sometimes you see
[1:12:41] that this is you know you watch um
[1:12:43] not that i've done this in the last
[1:12:45] decade but
[1:12:46] probably but you know you see you know
[1:12:48] teams like the all blacks playing japan
[1:12:50] and rugby
[1:12:52] and they annihilate them 100 something
[1:12:53] to nothing
[1:12:56] there's no what i'm talking about
[1:13:00] take off your angel wings you know but
[1:13:02] you know but why don't they just maybe
[1:13:04] get one try and just sit out the rest of
[1:13:06] the game no they're going to see how big
[1:13:07] a score they can get
[1:13:09] right and and and i say that you may
[1:13:12] think well that's a silly thing to say
[1:13:13] but you know
[1:13:14] i say that because how much victory do
[1:13:16] you want
[1:13:17] we know jesus has paid it all if you
[1:13:20] know the lord you know you're going to
[1:13:22] heaven right
[1:13:22] brother ram said that i could hunt and
[1:13:24] fish for every day for the rest of my
[1:13:26] life i'll still go
[1:13:28] but how much victory do you want how
[1:13:31] many trophies do you want on the wall of
[1:13:32] what the lord has done in your life
[1:13:35] that's not you doing it there'll be
[1:13:37] nothing to boast about up there of our
[1:13:38] own human ability
[1:13:40] when we're gathered around the throne
[1:13:41] you yo i say lord jesus you got me here
[1:13:44] when that spirit came when when all of
[1:13:45] hell was pointed their guns against me
[1:13:47] you you deflected every bullet and then
[1:13:50] you turned them back on himself
[1:13:51] hallelujah
[1:13:52] i mean when that pain came into my life
[1:13:54] you healed me of that pain
[1:13:56] that complex came along you broke that
[1:13:57] demon of complex
[1:13:59] harley you gave me the victory over this
[1:14:00] when i went when i had burdened for my
[1:14:02] family went after them you got them
[1:14:04] it wasn't me getting them you got them
[1:14:07] so

[1:14:10] nail a
[1:14:11] million to nothing hallelujah
[1:14:14] why not yeah the lord you know the lord
[1:14:17] loves to see us
[1:14:19] loves to see us take him at his word you

[1:14:24] you know he rejoices too
[1:14:26] those are my children they chip off the
[1:14:28] old block

[1:14:45] mighty
[1:14:46] conqueror hallelujah he recovered all
[1:14:50] hallelujah and that was just a shadow
[1:14:52] was christ and david
[1:14:54] moses went down and spoke to pharaoh
[1:14:55] said pharaoh
[1:14:57] i'm taking everyone amen we're not even
[1:14:59] leaving a hoof behind
[1:15:01] we are not leaving nothing not even our
[1:15:03] livestock everything's coming worth
[1:15:04] and you know what happened everything
[1:15:06] came with hallelujah
[1:15:08] hallelujah that was just a shadow now
[1:15:10] here comes the mighty conqueror himself
[1:15:13] god says i'm going to show you chips
[1:15:15] this is how the block operates because
[1:15:17] remember we're beholding something
[1:15:18] yes and what we behold will become
[1:15:22] you know i remember when i was young i
[1:15:23] wanted to be danny morrison giving away
[1:15:25] my age with cricket i wanted to be
[1:15:26] russell cootes with sailing
[1:15:28] i want to be all different kinds of
[1:15:29] people because i beheld an image and i
[1:15:31] wanted to become that image
[1:15:33] and they were my heroes my heroes were
[1:15:36] not men who wore
[1:15:37] lycra and your head you know had their
[1:15:40] undies on the outside and ran around by
[1:15:41] night with a cape on
[1:15:43] they weren't my heroes sportsmen were my
[1:15:46] heroes
[1:15:47] but then one day i met my real hero and
[1:15:50] and you know he's he's far greater than
[1:15:52] a sports person he's far greater than
[1:15:54] some
[1:15:55] superhero you know he's a lord of glory
[1:15:58] he's my hero
[1:15:59] hallelujah you know he's the kind of man
[1:16:01] who'll go to a funeral and it can't stay
[1:16:03] a funeral
[1:16:04] amen he's the kind of one who just says
[1:16:06] peace be still and the wind's a wave
[1:16:07] obey him he's the one who who doesn't
[1:16:10] leave people sick but he heals them
[1:16:12] he goes to people called legion and
[1:16:14] those people called legion everyone else
[1:16:15] tries to avoid them
[1:16:17] and think there's no way this person can
[1:16:18] get help and he just goes and says i'll
[1:16:20] show you they can be helped
[1:16:21] hallelujah that's my hero hallelujah my
[1:16:24] hero is not a hero of history that we
[1:16:26] read about from 2000 years ago
[1:16:28] my hero's in today i mean my hero can
[1:16:31] take a man
[1:16:32] or take a woman and show the power of
[1:16:33] his blood hallelujah you know i love it
[1:16:35] that the devil doesn't have the keys to
[1:16:36] his own house
[1:16:38] i love it he doesn't have the keys to
[1:16:39] his own house i mean
[1:16:41] when he thought he had the prince of
[1:16:43] life and he sat down in his lazy boy
[1:16:44] cheering hell
[1:16:45] and there's a knock on the door and that
[1:16:47] king of glory stepped in and you know
[1:16:49] and then and then satan said i finally
[1:16:50] got you now i thought i had you with
[1:16:52] abel i thought i had you with moses i
[1:16:54] thought i had you
[1:16:54] with john the baptist but now i finally
[1:16:56] got you but the tables were turned
[1:16:58] because our lord said no satan
[1:17:00] my blood is still on the cross dripping
[1:17:02] there i've purchased adam's fallen race
[1:17:04] i am now the conqueror of hell death and
[1:17:05] the grave give me the keys hallelujah
[1:17:07] and then he went from there took the
[1:17:09] keys off satan ascended up to paradise
[1:17:11] hallelujah
[1:17:12] where the thief on the cross just went
[1:17:14] in and said boys
[1:17:16] hallelujah i saw him where'd you see him
[1:17:18] did you see him on the shore of galilee
[1:17:20] do you see this and this and this and
[1:17:21] no no he was hanging on the cross right
[1:17:24] with me
[1:17:25] hallelujah hallelujah and he said today
[1:17:28] you'll be with me in paradise now i'm in
[1:17:30] paradise but where is he
[1:17:32] hallelujah and then the door comes open
[1:17:34] there's brother cairo said at camp his
[1:17:36] presence goes before him
[1:17:38] holly and then he steps into the room
[1:17:40] there's children you've been waiting a
[1:17:41] long time but now let's ascend up high
[1:17:44] holly and david was there and you know
[1:17:46] he prophesied
[1:17:47] open up the everlasting gates and be
[1:17:49] lifted up that the king of glory shall
[1:17:51] come in he prophesied that
[1:17:52] and then he finds himself living out
[1:17:54] that scripture
[1:17:56] wouldn't that be an incredible thing you
[1:17:58] know he's there in that great train as
[1:17:59] the saints go up high and you know
[1:18:01] then there's the call to the ramparts
[1:18:02] open up your gates and be lifted up that
[1:18:04] the king of glory shall come in
[1:18:06] then the response comes back down who is
[1:18:07] the king of glory and then he himself
[1:18:09] says the lord
[1:18:10] he is the king of glory mighty in battle
[1:18:12] and he's probably you know this is just
[1:18:14] me but wouldn't that be incredible you
[1:18:15] prophesy something
[1:18:17] and you find yourself living it out amen
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:21] we're going to speak our outcome
[1:18:24] hallelujah if we say no we're not leave
[1:18:27] one hoof behind
[1:18:28] i believe it's going to happen we should
[1:18:31] never settle for
[1:18:32] you know i i can't remember which
[1:18:34] brother said it at one of the
[1:18:35] easter conventions up in auckland but he
[1:18:37] said you know we're not made to be
[1:18:38] peacekeepers with the devil
[1:18:41] a peacekeeper just keeps the peace
[1:18:42] between two factions and you know
[1:18:44] no no that's not what we're built for we
[1:18:46] don't wear blue helmets
[1:18:47] and drive around in white armored
[1:18:49] vehicles and don't do nothing
[1:18:51] hallelujah we're here to conquer we're
[1:18:53] here to drive them out there's a
[1:18:54] principal work of the churches to cast
[1:18:56] out the devil
[1:18:57] hallelujah even as the word goes forth
[1:18:59] what does it do the washing of the water
[1:19:00] of the word takes
[1:19:01] spirits to try and latch themselves upon
[1:19:03] you trouble your mind it washes them
[1:19:05] from us
[1:19:06] hallelujah says the principal work of
[1:19:08] the church is casting out satan
[1:19:11] amen it's our job description that's a
[1:19:13] good idea
[1:19:14] mark 16 is our job description
[1:19:17] hallelujah

[1:21:40] like that

[1:21:51] like this
[1:21:54] hallelujah
[1:21:57] amen you see it through the new
[1:21:59] testament where jesus conquered
[1:22:01] he wasn't intimidated by anything
[1:22:04] the scribes the pharisees the high
[1:22:06] priest he wasn't intimidated by it
[1:22:08] he says i've come to do i'm you know
[1:22:10] i've come to do my father's will
[1:22:12] this is why i'm here and then you see
[1:22:14] that same life going to the
[1:22:16] go into the apostles where beforehand
[1:22:18] they were cowards they run peter denied
[1:22:20] and all kinds of things
[1:22:23] but then
[1:22:27] after the upper room they said should we
[1:22:31] serve god or serve man
[1:22:34] hallelujah now once again
[1:22:37] here it is all that the father cometh
[1:22:39] now now
[1:22:41] david got all back
[1:22:45] abram abraham got locked back in
[1:22:47] everything
[1:22:48] now here's the one that they were
[1:22:50] pointing to being shadows they're
[1:22:51] pointing to the reality
[1:22:52] all that the father hath given me shall
[1:22:54] come to me and him that cometh to me
[1:22:56] i'll know why is cast out
[1:22:58] for i have come down from heaven not to
[1:23:00] do my own will but the will of him that
[1:23:02] sent me this is
[1:23:03] this should be our this should be our
[1:23:05] motto in life
[1:23:06] i haven't come to do my own will i've
[1:23:08] come to do my father's will
[1:23:12] and this is the father's will which hath
[1:23:15] sent me
[1:23:16] that all which he hath given me i should
[1:23:18] lose nothing
[1:23:20] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:23:21] day and this is the will of him that
[1:23:23] sent me
[1:23:23] that everyone that seeth the son and
[1:23:25] believeth on him
[1:23:26] may have everlasting life and i will
[1:23:29] raise him up
[1:23:30] at the last day what's that got to do
[1:23:33] with us
[1:23:34] you may be asking i'll just throw the
[1:23:35] question out there well do we want
[1:23:37] everyone to see
[1:23:38] him in us that they would believe that
[1:23:41] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:23:42] and forever
[1:23:43] in our conduct how we treat people how
[1:23:45] we treat our families how we treat our
[1:23:47] spouses how we treat people
[1:23:48] to be salty amen
[1:23:52] don't we want people to see jesus that
[1:23:54] we actually have something that's just
[1:23:55] not an
[1:23:56] it's not an argument it's not a
[1:23:57] different church system but it's a real
[1:24:00] living reality of god that's what we
[1:24:03] want
[1:24:05] hallelujah
[1:24:08] i'm just gonna i'm just gonna take this
[1:24:10] back here
[1:24:13] i will
[1:24:19] i'm just going to leave this i'm going
[1:24:21] to close with this scripture therefore
[1:24:22] it is of faith that it might be by grace
[1:24:24] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:24:26] all the seed
[1:24:27] not only which is of the law but to that
[1:24:30] also which is of faith
[1:24:31] of the faith of abraham who is the
[1:24:33] father of us all
[1:24:34] as is written i have made thee a father
[1:24:36] of many nations
[1:24:37] before he whom he believed even god who
[1:24:40] quickened the dead
[1:24:41] and calleth those things which be not as
[1:24:44] though
[1:24:45] they were now that same faith should be
[1:24:48] in you and i
[1:24:49] yes i don't see the promise i don't know
[1:24:52] how it's going to happen
[1:24:54] i don't understand how it happened
[1:24:56] physically it seems impossible
[1:24:59] but he called those things not as though
[1:25:01] they were
[1:25:02] isaac's on his way sarah how are you
[1:25:05] feeling
[1:25:06] nothing he's coming 20 years of that
[1:25:11] he turned up hallelujah that's
[1:25:14] perseverant you know brother brown
[1:25:15] preaches perseverant perseverance quite
[1:25:17] a lot it should be a theme of our lives
[1:25:18] to be perseverant
[1:25:20] in the faith don't give up don't quit
[1:25:22] don't be discouraged you know
[1:25:24] joshua was told be strong and very
[1:25:26] courageous
[1:25:27] don't be discouraged press the battle
[1:25:29] failure will come
[1:25:32] amen failure will come we will fail god
[1:25:34] miserably sometimes
[1:25:36] and we'll be ashamed of ourselves but
[1:25:38] don't lay face down in the dirt it's not
[1:25:40] him that fall of him that gets back up
[1:25:42] says lord try me one more time
[1:25:44] hallelujah who against hope believed in
[1:25:48] hope that he might become the father of
[1:25:50] many nations according to that which was
[1:25:52] spoken so shall
[1:25:54] thy seed be and being not weak in faith
[1:25:57] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:25:59] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:26:01] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:26:03] and staggered not at the promise of god
[1:26:05] through unbelief it was strong in faith
[1:26:06] giving glory to god
[1:26:08] and being fully persuaded that he uh
[1:26:10] what he had promised he was also
[1:26:13] able to perform see so so so he just it
[1:26:16] was just anchored in his heart
[1:26:17] god's going to do it it was really that
[1:26:20] simple god's going to do it we're going
[1:26:22] to take a rapture how's that going to
[1:26:23] work god's going to do it
[1:26:25] my family's going to come in how's it
[1:26:26] going to happen god's going to do it
[1:26:28] i don't know how we can overcome this
[1:26:30] world god's going to do it
[1:26:32] through us yes hallelujah
[1:26:35] and being fully persuaded i'll just
[1:26:37] repeat that verse and being fully
[1:26:38] persuaded that
[1:26:39] what he had promised he was also able to
[1:26:41] perform and therefore it was reputed to
[1:26:43] him for
[1:26:44] righteousness amen he believed the word
[1:26:48] as it was promised him and it was
[1:26:50] imputed to him for righteousness
[1:26:52] now he's the father of the faith hello
[1:26:55] children of abraham how are we today
[1:26:57] we can see in the old testament that he
[1:26:59] staggered actually quite a lot you say
[1:27:00] well how does paul how does paul
[1:27:02] reconcile this well by the blood of
[1:27:04] jesus christ and he actually had faith
[1:27:06] in the promise when when paul
[1:27:08] writes the divine commentary of
[1:27:09] abraham's life all that staggering is
[1:27:11] not even there
[1:27:12] it's actually not a contradiction in
[1:27:14] scripture because the old testament's
[1:27:15] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:27:17] where all their failings and things were
[1:27:18] shown but under the blood of jesus
[1:27:20] christ they're not even written about
[1:27:21] like is not attributed to them but he
[1:27:24] was persevering for 20
[1:27:26] odd years and he got isaac
[1:27:30] let's keep pressing the battle remember
[1:27:33] we have a role
[1:27:35] let's let's let's live that role out
[1:27:38] hallelujah amen musicians
[1:27:42] we just finished there he said i'm going
[1:27:45] through a real battle
[1:27:46] just take god at his word the devil will
[1:27:49] always tell you that the word is not for
[1:27:50] you
[1:27:51] and and it can't be fulfilled in your
[1:27:52] life he will never come along
[1:27:54] imagine if i was the devil i said isaac
[1:27:57] the word's going to happen you'd
[1:28:00] actually say no hold on
[1:28:01] that's not how you talk because the
[1:28:02] devil doesn't talk that way
[1:28:04] he'll always give you doubt and you
[1:28:06] always try and place the evidence
[1:28:08] place the emphasis of it being fulfilled
[1:28:11] on your lap
[1:28:12] how are you going to do it he always
[1:28:15] tries to put you in the equation but
[1:28:17] it's actually it's you and god and god
[1:28:19] said i'll do it
[1:28:19] god told abraham you're going to be the
[1:28:21] father of nations i'm i've made you the
[1:28:23] father of nations i've changed your name
[1:28:24] to actually show you that
[1:28:26] and so it wasn't abraham saying okay
[1:28:28] how's this deal going to work
[1:28:29] you know in terms of what am i going to
[1:28:31] do that it you know all that ended up
[1:28:33] was with was an ishmael
[1:28:35] a wild man it wasn't his humanity that
[1:28:38] brought it forth it was god's promise
[1:28:39] him taking god at his word
[1:28:42] amen aren't you glad the lord put
[1:28:44] something in our hearts we can just take
[1:28:45] him at his word
[1:28:46] holy that we can just walk with him amen
[1:28:49] praise the lord um
[1:28:51] let's say uh let's stand shall we
[1:28:53] tonight
[1:28:54] and um i want to sing that chorus oh
[1:28:57] could you turn me down please
[1:28:58] um i want to sing that chorus just more
[1:29:00] of you and then i want to sing magnify
[1:29:03] the lord with me
[1:29:06] amen more of you i've had it all but
[1:29:08] what i need is more of you

[1:33:47] i believe by your grace
[1:33:49] lord by the transforming power of your
[1:33:51] holy spirit lord you can take a man or a

[1:33:56] their nature which was once
[1:33:58] violent horrible and terrible lord you
[1:34:00] can transform them such a way that lord
[1:34:02] that their nature has changed to become
[1:34:04] your nature oh god
[1:34:05] lord as your word says we are partakers
[1:34:07] of the divine nature
[1:34:09] i want to thank you lord that you are
[1:34:10] molding and shaping us oh god too
[1:34:13] lord to express lord yourself upon the
[1:34:15] earth through us lord thank you lord
[1:34:17] that
[1:34:18] by your grace i believe we are your
[1:34:20] attributes manifested today in flesh
[1:34:22] and dear god i just pray lord lord as
[1:34:25] as you read in that quote as the um boy

[1:34:41] your word would be the mirror that we
[1:34:42] compare ourselves with lord

[1:34:46] people that we know but lord may we
[1:34:48] compare ourselves
[1:34:49] lord may the mirror that we look into
[1:34:51] his lord may it be your word and lord by
[1:34:53] your grace may we match your word our
[1:34:55] god
[1:34:56] not by our own lord our own ability our
[1:34:59] own humanity
[1:35:00] but lord may we just yield ourselves oh
[1:35:02] god to your spirit that you can mold and
[1:35:04] shape us that lord that we become your
[1:35:06] word made flesh lord jesus
[1:35:08] may you grant it dear god i want to
[1:35:10] thank you lord that you've made us that

[1:35:18] lord that wants to do its own thing but
[1:35:19] lord you've allowed us lord by your
[1:35:21] grace to
[1:35:22] lord have a nature that says lord have
[1:35:24] thy way
[1:35:25] we are the clay and you are the potter

[1:35:40] name of jesus christ lord they can be
[1:35:42] yielded and flexible to your word o god
[1:35:44] father oh lord jesus we know in the days
[1:35:47] of your flesh lord to me the greatest
[1:35:48] miracle you did is you subjected your
[1:35:50] own body to the word you had to fulfill
[1:35:52] to go to calvary as a man
[1:35:54] lord what a victory that was lord jesus
[1:35:56] lord we submitted
[1:35:58] yourself your humanity to that
[1:36:01] you knew what you had to suffer and go
[1:36:03] through lord to be wounded for our
[1:36:05] transgressions marred more than any man
[1:36:07] lord to redeem us back to god so i pray
[1:36:10] lord jesus help us to yield ourselves
[1:36:12] lord the word we must fulfill in this
[1:36:14] day
[1:36:15] lord may we just give ourselves
[1:36:16] completely to you oh god may there be no
[1:36:19] doors in our hearts that are closed lord
[1:36:21] that you not welcome in but may every
[1:36:22] door just be open o god
[1:36:24] lord may you grant it lord i pray you
[1:36:26] dismiss us with your blessing now

[1:36:33] hearts lord that we can get back
[1:36:35] everything the devil's taken from us
