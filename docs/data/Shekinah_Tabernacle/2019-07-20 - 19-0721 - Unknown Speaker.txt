musicians thank you brother Idi Amin good morning everyone I mean it's good to have everyone here god bless you great to have the my books home welcome home I'm in praise the Lord anything brother man can I get rid of this thank you I mean God bless you all I mean great to have the rodiles as well brother Mario they've been bless you amen let's um let's turn in the scripture to Ephesians chapter 2 I mean I don't I don't have a PowerPoint morning do it the old-fashioned way Ephesians 2 and 19 they many see is now therefore yeah no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone and whom all the building fitly frame to give the grass and to a holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit but this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a foreign few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge and the mystery of Christ which in other ages were not made known unto the sons of men as it was now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow ears and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power and to me who am least then the less then the least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord I mean and let's go to the book of Judges and we're gonna read judges chapter 2 and verses 7 to 14 this may seem a bit unusual but we're gonna read judges to 7 to 14 and the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being a hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance and Timnath he rose in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill of yesh and also all that generation would gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel I mean my Lord blesses word you may have your seats this morning now it's very contrasting scripture there but one is now I want to continue on from from where I was last Sunday I pray the Lord help me now we hear we read very to two contrasting scriptures but you know one was you know the Apostle Paul and I find when I read the book of Ephesians it's very hard to find a place to stop and start but here here he is showing that in times past there was there was parts of of God that were not made no and they were they were there was a position in Christ that was not known to the church but now they came a dispensation where a people would come back to where Adam and Eve was in the garden that they would they would dwell in their position in Christ that the because he says to the intent that the reason that the gospel has been ministered that these unsearchable riches of Christ would be now ministered to the church as that that they would know the believer would begin to know see and comprehend the principalities and powers and heavenly places that are given to the church so that means that the power that they that the bride has that the believer has would be made known because you know if you take any army if they don't know what their equipment can do how are they going to fight I mean like if America they have all the missiles or Russia they have all their muscles but if they don't know what they could do do you think they would use them do you think they could actually rest in the fact they have this weapon that could destroy the world you know that would they wouldn't act the way they do if they didn't know what it could do and it's the same thing with it that yeah you know with us we want to know what we have we want to know the position we have we don't want to just sit back and say well Jesus died for me thank you Lord and just sit back and not use what he gave us I mean because when he redeemed us it wasn't just to cleanse us from sin but it was two places and heavenly places in Christ Jesus that we could have authority over the devil have authority over this flesh I mean we could overcome all things so we want to see what we what he has made us to be I mean because the more you see what God has made you to be the more you worship Him because the more thankful you are hallelujah I mean cuz he paid a great price I remember that great price was paid that we would we would live according to our privilege hallelujah I mean in the greater the prices paid the greater the thing that's bought hallelujah amen so so but you're very very two contrasting scriptures so one the Apostle Paul is showing the church the dispensation of grace that he is ministering to them was not known in previous ages how the Gentiles are the habitation of the Spirit that that we would know the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so that you would know your position in the Lord Jesus Christ what he has made you to be now this was not revealed to the believers before but now has to be made knowing right so now when something is is revealed is not just to give us something to talk about it's not just something you to do to debate or or you know you know your form an opinion that's not why things are revealed but the word is revealed in order that God's mind would put on flesh upon the earth so what God thinks it is spoken and then it's spoken in the right people will receive it and it will become manifested I mean so that's why it's revealed that it would be lived it would be manifested that people would not just talk about it or debate it but they would actually possess what is spoken I mean so that's the you know that's why Jesus died is that not that we would just talk about him dying I mean I'll talk about him resurrect him but we would possess amen the promise of eternal life that would be manifested in these mortal bodies hallelujah so so when something is so so so when something is revealed I mean it is God's thoughts manifested upon the earth so you take you take fruit now and you could spend week it's been forever just looking in the scripture you know this is God's mind being transmitted down it's what this message is it's God's mind being transmitted down I mean that we would know what he's thinking and not just say well now I know what the mind of God is but no now that mind would be manifested I mean as the scripture says that the mind that was in Christ be in you so if his mind is in you you'll operate you'll live according to the word I mean you won't just talk about it or debate it it'll be manifested hallelujah so amen so brother Branham would know so you take Isaiah yo prophesy about a virgin shall conceive and we know that that was impossible without God never been done before and and you know we don't you know prophets will say something and if they're really conscious of what they're saying they probably would never have seen it how's this gonna happen this is impossible but he just spoke it out and someone wrote it down and they believed that as I say at the Lord I mean so now you know you take so but when God when God prophesized something he knows exactly who's going to manifest their promise right isn't just throw it out there and say well maybe someone will catch it maybe someone will agree and you know he knows who's going to manifest it hallelujah he knows exactly the person the time the season when it's going to happen that you take when Isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive and and brother Bram dramatized it you know II so listen listen the message Jehovah of miracles and this is when Joseph and Mary are coming back from from from a meeting in the synagogue he seasoned at this point Joseph must have said do you realize dear how many quails that would have taken to feed them people speak of the people in the wilderness but there are about two and a half million people in the camp and each man could easily eat two quail or more for satisfying so it would take more than 5 million quails but he's Jehovah the Creator amen how that he could create quail this probably wasn't even five million quail and all Palestine or all the wilderness but he's Jehovah God who can put them there and that's there's none there he can still create them for he did it in the days of Abraham on the mountain when Abraham called him Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide anything he is need of then Joseph's mother must have said something like this that message was striking but I thought the good rabbi ruined it at the end when he said but it is true that Jehovah used to do miracles but alas Jehovah doesn't even do miracles today that those days have long past the go all Jehovah wants us to do is go to church pay our dues and just live a good life Joseph must have said I kind of disagree with the rabbi because if he is God he has to remain the same God if he was Jehovah Jireh he could provide for them he can provide for us all so how I could have holid like to have holiday mean to Joseph I mean I like that kind of faith he's still the same one hallelujah Mary slips back into the house and picks up a scroll brings it out as their usual Sunday afternoon Bible study and it happened to be this day we'd say she brought out the scroll of Isaiah and as Joseph took the scroll and opened it up he began to read the scroll to Mary and to comment finally he comes to the place in Isaiah nine and six Ritz hears something like this and to us a child is given unto us a son the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called counselor the Prince of Peace the mighty God the everlasting father and while he is reading he heard a sigh and he looked sideways and the little lady sweetheart of his her little face had flashed up and her eyes were glistening like the stars on a dark night and said read it again dear and he read it against you and and she must have said oh who has that be what was that prophet speaking of and he said something like this or would have said the Prophet was speaking of the Messiah will come and one of our woman someday will bear the Messiah their scripture seemed to grip the little version for she couldn't get away from it hallelujah and you know amen say see see that word was was there sitting in the scrolls for 800 years but then finally the pre later one I mean that was part of the promise heard that word and you know many other woman would have heard that scripture many other would have seen it's going to be me but once came upon the earth or it wasn't just it's gonna be me it was her hallelujah and gripped her I mean like not a scripture didn't and I pray to God that the word this prophesied of today I mean of a body change of a rapture I'm it would grip us like never before I mean it will become more than our everyday food everybody comes to our live to us more than just a nice promise or more than a nice idea but grip our lives Holly it becomes so real or God that's for me I mean not because not because I may say it or brother Brahm Caesar or you read in the scripture but God comes and behind as his that scriptures for you hallelujah encrypter and it could never get why because God had revealed it to her the rapture is a revelation I mean it's a revelation to you it's got to be made alive to you I mean when it becomes alive to you your whole life will be different I'm going home I'm going home there is nothing holding me here hallelujah glory to God amen now the Apostle Paul would say in Ephesians three I'm going to come back to judges we're just going to go this way a bit but that's cause there's Ephesians 3 and 14 the cause of what is so so for this cause what's the cause we worried about the cause of what is being revealed in this dispensation of grace I bow my knees into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ I've whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend now that would comprehend means to take eagerly to cease to possess to apprehend to perceive it's not just a mental comprehension actually to possess what is being given a mentor sees it to lay hands upon it I mean to to to apprehend it Palu you that you me able to take eagerly to cease possess with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of God which passes knowledge that ye may be filled with all the fullness of God so the Apostle Paul is not just saying you know a little bit about it that you won't just have a shallow kind of religion you'll know the depths the heights the breadth the length I mean we're in four dimensions hallelujah I mean that you'll know all these things the fullness of God everything that he is that you'll see that you'll possess it I mean it's more than just being justified you'll be sanctified as well I mean you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost you'll possess the fullness the inheritance in Christ you will not someone else you will I mean you'll possess the fullness of the promise of this day hallelujah that's why the Spirit has come that's why we're the habitation of the Spirit hallelujah it's more than just knowing about it but you really possess it amen so notice the breadth the length the depth and the height every dimension every part of the scripture I'll say this if the word is not exciting you something else is exciting you you should the word the rapture is for the rapture the rapture is for those who are caught up in him this is a love affair yeah between you and the Lord Jesus that's a love affair it's not a working relationship but you're never here comment should never get stale that should get richer greater more wonderful should mean he should mean more to you now than he did yesterday I mean he you should love for more now than you did yesterday his word should be more alive more rich more wonderful every day why because it's a love relationship I mean it's not a the honeymoon continues on yes I mean you know what we're here for we're here to break the cycle of revival and death I mean the bride is here upon the earth now that the cycle of revival and death would be broken that we wouldn't just have one generation coming and have amazing testimonies and God would live and in the next generation we just become formal and just well say might my parents had or had an experience and now I'm just here no that wouldn't be that way it would just be revival than the next generation revival the next generation revival I mean because now we're going into a season where it's not a cycle of revival and if that cycle must come to an end and we are and and and you should say in your soul Lord Here I am use me manifest that breaking of the cycle in my life hallelujah that's why we're here friends amen and don't let the devil rob you amen of what is rightfully yours amen he's not going to be on he's not supporting you he's against you Amen we need to come to that conclusion now so see it's not just a shallow walk with the Lord it's not a secondhand experience or a relationship it's not a one time in the past kind of thing I mean we don't serve a memory Amen Church did Amen but we serve and walk with the great I am the present God I'm in his living word today amen see listening and hearing someone else's testimony is great I mean but it's when you meet him for yourself I mean it's not just a weekend away or a holiday away and that you post some pictures on Instagram and talk about it later and boast about it but it's an everyday walk I mean here's a life today as he was yesterday he's real to you today as he was yesterday it's not just a one-time holiday thing I mean but it's a now hallelujah amen right now hallelujah he wants to lead you see look listen he wants to lead you through the Promised Land of his word I mean he doesn't just want you to live off a memory I mean the memories are good because you got to have the faith if he did it for you Denny do for you today because the same God he was back then when you first met him he's the same God today I mean the same God that delivered you from the world then is the same God that keeps you today the same one that filled you with the holy spirit then can refill you today the same one that healed you back then he'll heal you today how Lisa would have that confidence Lord you're the same yesterday today and forever you do not change in any way hallelujah I mean so he wants to lead you through all the promises of his word hallelujah amen that's why that's why when we look into the message look into the scripture there shouldn't be any part of it we should stay away from oh those people have made those who cares what they've made there's truth there somewhere hallelujah you know where the Scarecrow scarecrows are built to because it's good food there hallelujah and brother man tells the story of the groundhog comes out brother Bamie Reuter he he drew a scarecrow on a butter paper take the boys butter beans or whatever then he's watching and in the ground hook came out and he looked at the thing he looked he went a bit closer came back it wasn't moving was just a dead thing skeet Crozier did there's no life and so the and so the ground I went and he and he kept it a twin rattle because if anyone rode he jumped back he when he getting ready round it off he jumped back he realized knots Danny just went eating hallelujah and you got to realize the same thing people put scarecrows up they did don't worry about the Scarecrow don't be afraid hello it doesn't matter how big it is how lifelike it is it's just an imitation of a life I mean so we should be just go eat hallelujah fill your belly fully up roll out of this place hallelujah amen hey you can always digest later amen but you know we shouldn't be amen he wants to lead us through the Promised Land of his word the riches of it the great valleys the mountains the rivers our forests the bubbling streams all of it hallelujah we should have an inquisitive nature what's over that hill what's in that promise what's in that scripture what's in that prophecy we should go look he wants to show us oh but I've heard it all well have you really heard it all you may have heard it in here but hasn't become alive has it become quickened amen if he sees with the opening of the seals brother Brahim sees in the rising of the Sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God as Christ and Christ as the seals that was opened what was the opening of the seals in revealing Christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power do that to us cooking power lets us see his coming now put this in your lap Amen I say quickening power let us see is coming quickening power let me see he is coming I mean quickening power snatches from death to life cooking power snatch me from death to life quickening power gives us the sermon hallelujah to know what's wrong with you to end and what to do and what you have done and what you ought not to have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power all these things I mean Jesus is so full of quickening power he is full of it together he was so full of quickening power he said this you destroy the spotting I'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quickening power I mean destroy this body this temple I'll bring it up in three days why why did he say that he knew that was written of him see that was written of him by the Word of God that could not fail the word said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell he knowed that quickening power would raise him up and that there would not be one cell corrupt he knew was written of him it gave him perfect faith should be the same thing with us if this earthly tabernacle beat us your beat is all with one eternal in the heavens waiting already I trust that's been quickened to you this we made a life to you and why is it being quick and maydel overs because it's for you hello it's your promise I mean the promise of the rapture I trust that something's gripped you I mean this body's going to be changed by the Holy Ghost that's within me I mean what is that that quickening powers brought that promise to you because you're part of that promise hallelujah I think we should just rejoice I mean cuz if God has given you a promise I mean I'll just say yes Lord it doesn't matter what the devil says doesn't mean what your own mind may be saying forget that just say yes what I agree yes Lord it's for me thank you lord hallelujah amen no he said you destroy this temple I raised up again in three days why it was prophecy the Word of God and prophecy if it's true Word of God and cannot fail in the same prophecy and Word of God that's it he'd raise him up see that we are already raised with him but me no wonder he said fear not for as written the spirit that is now was in him and now in us also quickens our mortal body fear not friend he says the Esso winners up the Sun is up hallelujah that's why it says in Isaiah 54 and 16 behold I've created the Smith the blood the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work I have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord hallelujah his righteousness is our rice is as of him I mean but he created the waster to destroy he made all these things I mean nothing's out of cater everything is going on exactly as he promised I mean we don't need to worry about anything you say well it's looking awful dark no it's always darkest before dawn hallelujah God member I you know I have said it over the years we can't just continue on as we have polio there will come an end they will come an end and and and the dead in christ rose and we are gone hallelujah there will come an end amen sure we should plan long-term right we should but there will come a time when there'll be no time and we're living in the season hallelujah amen so he created the waster to destroy I mean so I think we should just rejoice Lord you allowed it you created it you want to bring something out of my life Pulu you he says in Isaiah 43 in 1 but now thus saith the Lord that created the Oh Jacob and he that formed thee O Israel fear not brave redeem me I've called thee by thy name thou art mine hallelujah glory amen when thou passes through the waters I'll be with thee amen and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall they flame Kindle upon thee and it's you gonna walk through some dark places sure we're gonna walk through some dark places mm he says I'll be with thee I'll be with thee in the fire I'll be with thee on the mountain I'll be with you in the valley I'll be with you through the very tight places holy but I'll be with thee I'm in gonna have confidence that he'll lead you through hallelujah now notice notice when when when Eve was taken out of Adam it was Adam that told her who she was I mean she didn't have to work it out herself he came to her and revealed it I mean so so the rib was taken out you know the Lord God took it out of the man he made the woman and brought her unto the man and then Adam said to her this is bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man hallelujah now we know that this is a type of the Seventh Seal where where a man and a woman are living in Dominion and in the garden I mean so now we under the true seventh seal are now being restored god I mean back to having dominion upon the earth again I mean to go into a millennium right that's why the Devils under our feet I mean because the Lord has lifted us up into heavenly places I mean of the devil and his works are under our feet I mean he has restored as Jesus was the second Adam amen so the bride in this day is the second Eve it's the man and the woman being restored to go back into the garden hallelujah amen so now notice notice though Adam told the woman because she wasn't called Eve before the fall because she is part of him right that cult yeah they're both called Adam right but he came to her and said you are bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she didn't work it out she didn't say well am i part of you and how's this work no no he came to her amen to tell her who she was and it's the same thing today the Lord this message has come to you I mean that you would understand you're not just here I mean to to go through life and have a kind of religion no it's not that at all this message has come that you would know you're part of him a man as he is the word so the bride is part of the word hallelujah glory to God I mean we're not a separate part here that's why you've got to look into the scripture why did why did Jesus walk with a torn the way to Emmaus here they were the ministry had had hold themselves up somewhere the one they believed that was was the Messiah was dead the treasure of the church Judas had just hung himself their whole world had fallen apart and they're living in the time of the resurrection the greatest week in history brother a seed and they walk here long said think of it the whole world just fell apart they had to forsake all to follow this man from Nazareth it wasn't just I'll leave this church go to this church nothing will happen no everyone knew that they forsook they had to furs they had to go beyond the pressure of the synagogue there to go beyond the pressure of the high priest and follow this Jesus of Nazareth he wasn't well thought of he wasn't you know the who's who he was a renegade he was Beelzebub they said they had been willing to follow him now he had died and the whole world fell apart but then living a time of resurrection and it wasn't just the resurrection of the Messiah but there were people that were going to be resurrected as well there are gonna be quickened from death to life so here comes here comes Jesus on the way you know with him on the way to Emmaus he begins to reveal prophecy about himself and what he's fulfilling why cuz they're gonna know the height the depth the breadth or the length of the promise hallelujah and so here he is opening the word to them and it's burning within their hearts and then finally they come into the house and he does and he does something that he did before he died he does the same thing today hallelujah breaks the bread and they and their eyes come open it's you it's it's Messiah then he disappeared why did he do that because he wanted them to see that they are part of that resurrection hallelujah that's why he walked with a nets way up in the scripture that they would know they are part of the promise they're part of the prophecy hallelujah and it's the same thing today why does he walk among us why did he do the sign of the Messiah in this day what he did before he was crucified he did it get in this day that we'd see Jesus Christ is alive today why did he do it why is he open his word to you because to show you you're part of the resurrection you're part of the rapture you're part of the prophecy you're part of this book hallelujah just as Moses came out of the scripture John the Baptist Isaiah Jeremiah the prophets the woman at the well they all came out of the scripture I mean just as they did so did you hallelujah amen amen the Apostle pulls in the scripture he was prophesied of he said I'll be a light to the Gentiles wholly he came out of the scripture he has prophesied of he has spoken of is the same thing with this word speaks of you and here you are hallelujah amen I trust you look at yourself a bit different we're not at rotten down scraping by oh kind of people know we're here to manifest the Word of God I mean we're part of the scripture I mean that lives today hallelujah so Amy now now the other Scripture we read about from judges chose the beginning of the recital of revival and death that rear what that was a reoccurring event through the book of Judges and then just reoccur there when or it goes all the way down through the scripture into the new testament era until today now but notice in judges they had the tabernacle they had the mercy see they had the priesthood that the high priest said the sacrifices they had the feasts they even had a written record of what the Lord had done for them in the past but their generation did not know the one that gave them those things and even the purpose for them so they didn't they didn't fold up the tabernacle and put away in storage they didn't cover up the ark and put it away in storage you know take the priests garments off the priests and put it away and stop you know there was still there they you know there was a tabernacle they had everything but they didn't know the Lord that gave at them amen and so maybe maybe just just let me repeat that they had Church order how ministry should be important times of the year how they should dress how to worship they even had a written record an audio record a video record of what God had done for them in the past but that generation did not know the one that gave them those things even the purpose for them amen now I read that I thought Lord no I don't want to see this today I mean that that we can have church we can go through the motion and we can know how to dress and act and whatever whatever whatever but not know him just like them there must come a time where the cycle is broken where we don't just have a church or a message culture and people conform to how people should be but they are transformed by the renewing of their mind they meet God for themselves I mean that the god of their fathers becomes a God their God only you know why did why did why did God call Israel out why did he give them the tabernacle is here so I can walk among you he wanted to have us have his family around him that was the purpose it wasn't just for them to follow a bunch of rules and do's and don'ts or what no God wanted his children close he wanted his family close to him that's why it was there that was the purpose holy Ana and if I only caught the purpose of it is that they Almighty God that created all things would walk among them holy that they would look well in safety and peace under their vineyard and God would be there and they'd say you know cuz they couldn't no other nation could say let's go worship the Creator let's go worship the one that gave us life nikka let's go worship the Chern Living God let's go prices name let's go hear his word no other nation could do it they had their idols they had their what they did I mean didn't matter how real it was it wasn't the true and living God but they could say let's go worship Him hallelujah glory to God and it should be the same thing with us let's go worship the Creator let's go worship the one that died for us on Calvary they shall worship the one that gives eternal life let's go spend time with him he doesn't know he just doesn't want to walk among us he wants to be in us holy not just to be with you but in you to the end of the world hallelujah - why this message come that Christ would dwell in us and not just a little bit but in his fullness it's full every fiber of our being that wouldn't just be just justified by faith or just sanctified but filled with the Holy Ghost more than just being anointed our spreads we come and dwell in our souls I mean that it would be no longer we that live that his character is now our character hallelujah amen we're going to look at the purpose of it what is the purpose of church that God would come down I mean the window fellowship way of communion with him that he would come and meet with us and change us and molas and shape us I mean that's the purpose of church holy what's the purpose of having family altar that God would come down hallelujah hallelujah that the holy spirit would be present in the house I mean there you would know that he's alive amen what that's the purpose of this message that God would come down that Jesus would step out of history I'm so glad he's not a god of history Paulie I'm so glad he's not a God that died in 1965 or somewhere and or yesterday yesterday no today hallelujah I'm glad he's alive today I'm so glad we can feel his presence Amen doesn't matter if we all sing out of tune out of key out of whatever God comes down probably they can walk with you manifest himself to you I'm so glad it's that way I'm so glad we serve a God of reality hallelujah hallelujah and it's for you that's for all of you hallelujah amen now this word it says he they knew him not it means they didn't see him they didn't recognize them they were not acquainted with him there's few of the definitions so they didn't really see him they had their natural eyes but spiritual eyes they didn't see him they didn't recognize his presence as many do not recognize his presence today they weren't acquainted with them they never relationship sure they had a relationship with maybe the feasts and the forms and the worship but no the God that gave them yeah I need that thank you I'm looking down there's no water thanks buddy he'd appreciate it I mean so they didn't they weren't acquainted with him I thought that's the biggest robbery the biggest robbery that anyone could ever have is be among the believers but not know him I mean cuz to know him is life I mean to know him as life and when the Spirit of Truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth he will lead you and while it's not a collective thing it's an individual walk I mean he will lead you and guide you into all truth I mean to win to him so when you hear messages about the seals and trumpets and whatever more it's a reality and you see him hallelujah I mean when I first heard the seals I saw horse-riders tribulation whatever more second time I just saw Christ I still the lamb with the book it was open I saw the Redeemer stepped forth to claim me hallelujah amen now Peter would say in 2nd Peter 1 he says for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ whereby I'll not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things and though you know them and be established in the present truth yeah I think it meet as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by the pudding putting you in remembrance amen knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me more ever I will endeavor that you may be able after my decrease to have these things always in remembrance I mean for we are not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but will witnesses of His Majesty know before he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with them in the Holy Mount we also we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shyness in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart so a new day dawns a day star is Christ himself arising in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation why is it not a prior private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but the holy men of God spake as are moved by the Holy Ghost that's why it's not a private interpretation because it wasn't them bringing the word it was God moving upon them bringing the world a man that's why it's not of any private interpretation now brother Brown says and take on the whole armour of God he says when the enemy comes in like a flood that yo God raise up a standin he says but God doesn't have to do anything more to his make it any more appealing the only thing he has to do is raise up of his own word against the enemy the Bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises a standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he's already said more positive and taking his same word he just makes it more positive now what does that mean now he's not saying so so he's not saying it's um he makes it more greater than initially was that's not what he means because God's Word cannot change but an order for it to become more positive you know if you look at the definition of positive one of them it means two it's consisting in or characterized by the presence rather than the absence of distinguishing features so to make it more positive Amen it's actually showing the distinguishing features of the word of present so it's not taking away saying they're not there he's saying they are there hallelujah so if you're saying that the word becomes more positive that's how it raised up a standard he says the distinguishing features of the word are there hallelujah so what are the distinction features of the word Amen he's mighty too safe hallelujah he's made it a hill I mean he's present to deliver he's here to give peace he's here to be our banner our fortress our strength our strong tower amen to be our guide to be our refuge how their to be our healer to be a deliverer those are distinguishing features of the word I meant to show I mean to show what the devil's works are and then and they are cast away I remember us to show that Christ is present and because he is his word I mean if you have Jehovah Rapha you know you have to have all the attributes of God I mean because here because if he is praising or veneers as present I mean he doesn't just come half him come he's all here hallelujah amen so his distinguishing features are present that's how he makes the word more positive hallelujah he brings you to the realization that's how I raised up the standard he opened your spiritual eyes that you would really recognize he is here I mean it's like Elijah you know speaking to to his servant you're the Syrians are around the city amen and and and the server gets panicky look we're in trouble we're surrounded how we gonna get out of this one and then Elijah just praise Lord open up his eyes he didn't know that though there he just believed out there and then the servant was more shocked with the armies of heaven around them than he was the enemy on the on the field they meant so should be the same thing with us holy it doesn't matter what the enemy's doing in the physical I'm in the armies of heaven and kept about those hallelujah snot just we're not in this fight ourselves hallelujah amen so so what did what did it happen God made his promise more positive his word more positive hallelujah amen now he says this this is an where is it doesn't count down he says now somebody now now pray for somebody or do something here here is what pops in your heart right now is speaking to someone now here is what's in your heart you've got two brothers that you're praying for they're both alcoholics if that's right raise up your hands now this is the brief show that Jesus Christ is here alright see there you are see there it's sharper than two aegis sword a discerner of the thoughts and tints of the heart he says don't don't you see it friends we've passed speaking tongues here in the astronaut age here is now we still believe in speaking tongues we know that amen but we've gone beyond now here is a man right in front of her with his head bowed he's got sin here wearing a white coke glasses on he's got a spiritual problem he said now wait a minute I do know the man wait a

heal your head trouble lady all right you can have it Amen what is it the word of God for this day sharper than a two-edged sword Jesus Christ and astronaut power he says do you believe it no why did God do that to make the promise more positive to make his word more positive to show that he is present and be more than just healing but to show the rest of the world is here hallelujah that's why that's why that was done time after time after time as that people had come to an awakening that Jesus Christ is here in flesh holy that and he still here today as he was back then I meant to show you that the God that gave the promises the God here to manifest the promise hallelujah amen hallelujah now he say well how can we look and see Jesus brother Brown would say I'm looking away to Jesus he would say this he says well he comes forever so so so now he's here the time of the crucifixion BRABUS is released he says well come here Barabbas look up here you see that man dying up there he took your place he says I wonder if we tonight I'll say this morning can look and see what Barabbas saw someone taking our place he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we I was healed you were healed I wonder if we the guilty ones who should be sick and see him in our deliverance we who should go to hell see him and see him in your freedom you'll pass to heaven wonder if you could see what Barabbas saw that day he said a little while the world save me no more but you shall see me he says Oh Church then if he said you shall see me that's a proof that you can look again and then you'll see me probably with you even and you to the end of the world I mean when when will you see him at the word he is the word look at the word and see what the promises please the same yesterday today and forever what he was then when he think galley is the same thing he is tonight in Jeffersonville I'll say the same thing today here in Stokes rally the same thing he was as that Bradham Tabernacle what you what do you look to see a founder adult a denominational man you'll never see it in Jesus what do you see when you do you look to see some great priestly man you'll never see it in Jesus no sir how do you see Jesus by the Word of God being made manifest because he was the manifested Word of God what he was then he is tonight and will be forever I mean she can still look you can still see him you can still know him he says because a little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me but depends what you're looking at how'll it depends also what you're looking for amen the scribes and Pharisees we're looking for the wrong kind of Messiah and they missed him when he came I'll leave but the woman the wellses we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and she meet Messiah hallelujah beacons still look into his word and see him today just as alive as he was than he is now hallelujah now the Jesus would would be would rebuke the scribes and Pharisees he says you tithe and mint and anise and cummin and have admitted the weightier matters of the law so they were which our judgment mercy and faith these things you ought to have done and not leave the other undone he's saying that you've actually left off the most important part amen I mean this is how so you know it's like those in the days of judges they didn't know the Lord they had a form they they worship the yo they they had a tabernacle they had all those things but they did not know him and look at the scribes and Pharisees they were doing all these outward physical things but they really missed the true essence of the law they they missed the weightier matters now the way to you matters means the more burdensome things the more important yeah more important things they had they they had actually omitted them and term it means to forsake to lay aside to leave to yield up to actually yield up means to surrender it we don't want to surrender up the way to you matters Amen judgment mercy and faith parley we don't want to you know we don't want to forsake them laid them aside we want to lay hold upon them hallelujah amen not judgment husband of course we know means means by extension so so it's a it's a it's a judgment as for or against right it's by extension a tribunal by implication justice like divine law I mean so we have to wait there we don't want to admit judgment because many times to us people use the word judgment they always look at the negative side I mean but judgment is also a very positive thing I mean because he because when the woman was taken in adultery in the very act and brought before Jesus she judged her righteous hallelujah so so here the scribes and Pharisees who believed in the law actually brought her before the one who gave the law who was made flesh and now the law was going to judge her hallelujah remember the Lord didn't judge her as as as condemned the law actually judge her as righteous because she said because because he began to right in the right in the sand or the accusers he said them without sin let him cast the first stone and from the oldest to the youngest they dropped their stones and they left and then said now he looked up and says woman were like us where are thy accusers and she said I have none Lord so her attitude was not you know the yard to her he was not just a man a prophet Lord means Supreme One amen they have all gone my god they've gone and then now the one who gave the law says neither do i condemn they go and sin no more so don't write so you're free to go just don't go do it again so she was judged amen all the charges were dropped Jesus dropped the charges hallelujah that's the same thing with us amen he judges us righteous because we believe his word how they just like Abraham it was imputed to them for righteousness because he believed the word that's why he was righteous not because who he was as a man but because he believed the word God declared him righteous hallelujah hello righteous one tell you today I mean we wrestle about the things we do I mean but it's our faith that God sees man sees how it works for God sees our faith hallelujah and God gives you the faith anyway to believe hallelujah hey man praise the Lord mercy compassion amen we know faith is revelation amen those Caesar three things are very important now but the thing is we have to we have a battle and now I'm just going to kind of close on this but we have a battle when we look at ourselves and I said that now God is called God is calling a bride we know through seven Church ages she's been called but now it now God comes to the climax of his manifestation man and woman manifested as one hallelujah but then now the thing is our battlers is how we how we view where he's manifesting his word now Isaiah would would would prophesy also of of our Lord and and and his ministry in Isaiah 53 says who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed but he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and out of a root out of dry ground he has no form nor comeliness when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him so now this is the judgment of the people upon the form that God took to manifest Redemption you think about here was here was the one who who could take away the sins of the world as a man here was God's manner God's salvation manifested that's why it's called Jesus Jehovah salvation was now being was now being manifested upon the earth and he didn't come in a form that was amazing he didn't look like a king he didn't he wasn't tall but shoulders look like he should have a crown on his head he didn't he didn't put on that form so now here we says he had no form nor comeliness then when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him now that word camel enos means magnificence so he didn't he didn't have a form or magnificence that when we see him and there's no beauty that we should desire him so there was nothing of us physical um you know self that that was wow this is the Messiah this must be him you know you know it's not like the children's Bibles where Jesus as his blond blond haired white robes and he looks very different Devo announced he looked exactly the same as everyone else I mean you could have we could have been wandering through Jerusalem and he could have walked past and women you would never have seen him cuz he looked like everyone else hallelujah so why do you say hallelujah because it's more than what you see with your eyes that makes you catch who he is that's the same thing today I mean see there's no outward appearance he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and antiquated with grief so he knew grief very well this is where God's manifesting his salvation and we hid as it was our faces from him and he is despised and we esteemed him not now the word esteem means to think or regard or value so we didn't think about him in a great way we didn't regard him in a great way we did not value him in a great way we esteemed him not I mean surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted I mean so we regarded him as stricken we valued him as stricken we thought of him as stricken amen but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed but we are like sheep have gone astray I mean we have turned everyone to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all now that was when God manifested his salvation man did not esteem him in a great way it was the fullness of the Godhead was made work was Bodley in Christ Jesus God became a man to walk among us to manifest their salvation now I just want to put it on your lap we know that God's Jesus his ministry did not stop when he died on Calvary it continued through the book of Acts and Dow goes down into today the book of Acts is not the acts the Apostles as the acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles it means it's the same Christ's ministry continuing now in a mini membered body now you look at those people we would not esteem them great amen there was not a great big Cathedral great big chapel robe choirs yo excellent music and everything when you saw the first church we would never people would never have esteemed them as great you'd never think you know there was no form or comeliness or magnificence that when we would see them that there'd be any beauty that we would desire well this is this is the Bride of Christ on display this is the great mystery of cry send you the hope of glory is now in these people you'd never a statement to be great this is where God is fulfilling his word you'd never esteem it great what do you look at though you know I went through all the you know I went through some of the 120 in the upper room yes you're the husband I was in Papua New Guinea you know the people didn't realize that God doesn't take the great ones of the world he takes the he takes it down and out story yeah you know the rejects the you know he takes those are the people he takes her and transforms and puts in his body hallelujah and so now you take you take 120 real quick weird Peter he truck he's the minister of the church the pastor the church he tried to kill a guy not that longer with a sword he wasn't aiming to cut off his ear he's trying to cut off his head but he wasn't a swordsman he's a fisherman and then and then he said I'm going to stand for your Lord I you know I will I will I will even go die with you and then he goes to the judgement Hall a woman comes along aren't you one of them and then he and then he buckles under that pressure of one woman's testimony you know because in those days a woman's word was valued less than a man's right so sorry buckled under that and then another woman came along aren't you one of them buckles under that and then someone else comes along and he curses and swears and denies the Lord three times what a great man standing for the faith and here's the pastor of the church you know there's a woman at the well there was Mary Magdalene Seven Devils were cast out of her there was Matthew the tax collector no one likes the tax collector oh yeah this there's all these people but God gathered them hallelujah he bypassed the ones that we would have seemed to be there and he took the unlikely ones hallelujah and then you take over the Apostle Paul I mean you know you think our first church age messenger he'll be a one who walked with Jesus in the days of his flesh and God bypassed all of them they were still part of the body but he bypassed all them and took a Pharisee of the Pharisees and me to manifest his Redemption Parlier to the people so now see God's ways are they differently I'll leave I'm I'm glad God works that way amen and you go through the oh you take Rahab Tama you can take all those ones Bathsheba take all those ones down through the scripture the woman that are in the lineage of Jesus Christ my mama you look out you're Rahab all those ones and he and they're reflecting you al so now there's nothing of his form that we would desire him there's nothing great we esteem him stricken we you know we didn't esteem him when we saw him we hit our hid as it were our faces from him now that's where God manifested his Redemption as I said now the the bright is continuing his ministry not to die on the cross to pay for sins but now to continue his work right to find the last ones that we can go home so now work now we look at ourselves who has a battle with self and self-worth yeah why what what's the problem because your esteeming yourself not your esteeming yourself valuing yourself as man would value right you're not valuing yourself as God values you I mean that's the problem we value ourselves we have we need to change our thinking that we don't think according to these five senses I mean if you don't value ourselves we should never avail ourselves according to this a mentor or our position in society what we have our jobs profession you know status you know status who cares about status you know it doesn't matter we want to have God status and then we want to view ourselves as God views us holy Oh what we're going through great afflictions it says that at pleased it pleased him to bruise him at pleased God to bruise him to manifest his glory but it sees that but it pleased God so it's actually you know you may think this is strange but we go through a great trial it's actually a pleased God to allow you to go through it because he wants to manifest part of his life out of you through that trial hallelujah well no but we should say hallelujah we should count it all joy whether I can't see the joy just count it joy attribute it to being joy amen so now we so we wrestle with what we look like on the outside or how we view ourselves but we should look ourselves according to the word I mean but that's the problem and especially this first world as as an image is put in front of us that is photoshopped that is video you know the videos are altered there's a false perception of success there's an Instagram life that's put forward amen and it's projected and people try and become it and that's why they become depressed broken people what because they are not content because the world is trying to tell you don't be content with how God made you don't be content with what you have contentment with godliness as great gains I mean it's it's not a bad thing it is actually great gain to be content with what you have amen because we know we know that physical you know being very rich doesn't necessarily mean or being very poor as not showing God's pleasure or displeasure upon you it's not actually that is actually not even part of it at all amen so it's not oh I'm I'm rich therefore I must be very spiritual I'm very poor I must be very can although that's not how God works I mean God's blessing is that he chose you before the foundation of the world remember his love does not change his love does not change so you know his love is shown an election his love is shown and choosing Amen because he said before Jacob and Esau were born Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated because he chose one rejected the other and there was God's choosing he said well that's not fair I just say thank you Lord us chosen I'm just happy I'm an aren't you hallelujah so so he chose one and rejected the other right so his love is shown an election and his choosing because if God has decided there one of them you're gonna be one of them and you're accepted in the beloved you've been your he he's shown as love towards you and that love cannot change hallelujah so therefore we should just relax and rejoice and love him Amen I mean we should just enjoy him everyday just be happy being safe holy have you got nothing to be happy about it you know you can't think of anything going well in life just think well at least I have eternal life at least I at least I have redemption at least I'm walking in the light at least he's revealed himself to me at least he's taking all my sin away and they cease she'll be into the kingdom with His Holy Spirit hallelujah I just begin to rejoice in those things hallelujah and you'll just keep rejoicing in that through all eternity hallelujah you say well life's going sideways let it go sideways Josef's life win very sideways comes to his brothers guess what I had a dream oh he comes this guy and you guys all bowed down to me that's the conclusion of it I'm gonna be here to this place he's like two-by-four thinks he's king of the world you know that's God's dream that was a vision I mean I was you know it was a dream but there was god chung this is what's gonna happen in the future and no doubt I got the coat of many colors I'm special but then his life went sideways he's now being sold well one of his brothers wanted to kill him once he'd know don't kill him and he sold as a slave and he's going down into Egypt as a slave and no doubt as my thought but but I thought I was gonna be head of the tribe I thought I was going to be the one everyone were bow down to and he's actually going according to what God told him he's actually walking according to that dream see we don't know the middle we know the end from the beginning but the details in the middle do you know if you knew the you wouldn't need faith do you know that if you didn't actually know you wouldn't need faith that's why God doesn't show us what's around the next corner just keep walking just keep walking why and you gotta have faith Lord you've led me here you'll lead me on I mean I don't know what's going on but I know you're leading me and so he's taken down into Egypt thinking but I thought I was gonna be here to the tribe and he's going exactly how God were him to be but he had sent himself my life's gone for highways and then now he's finally there in part of his house in charge of the whole thing now it's going to happen and he finds himself in jail again you know just when he thought everything was coming together oh no because God knew the character he needed to have in order to manifest there and many times you say yes Lord you've made me the bride but there's a character that's going to be molded and shaped and the words gonna be molded into us although our carnality is going to be taken out of us holy and God knows how to do it hallelujah why because he wants you he has an image of you and it's more than just you thinking you're awesome with a crown and a white robe saying look at me hallelujah no you're made in His image I'm it's a history military have that Hemi same humility that surrendered your love prisoner to Christ you're the same way hallelujah glory to God so there he is and maybe he thought for the second time well maybe this is it and God had him in the prison God had him as a slave God had him in the prison God had
