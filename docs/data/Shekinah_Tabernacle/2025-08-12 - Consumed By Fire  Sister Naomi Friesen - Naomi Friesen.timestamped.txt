[0:33] disappear.
[0:38] Riches and fame and all that they could
[0:41] buy. I've come to find they never
[0:44] satisfy.
[0:48] What would I gain if my soul price?
[0:54] I don't want to love what the world
[0:56] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[0:59] world does. I only want you.
[1:05] I only want you.
[1:09] First things first, I seek your will,
[1:13] not my own. Surrender all my wants to
[1:18] you
[1:20] and keep the first thing first
[1:24] to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set
[1:29] my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you.
[1:35] All my desires reversed
[1:39] to keep the first thing first.
[1:44] I give it all. My life and offering.
[1:48] My heart is yours. So have your way in
[1:51] me. Your kingdom's all I want to see.
[1:57] I don't want to love what the world
[2:00] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[2:03] world does. I only want you.
[2:08] I only want you.
[2:12] First things first, I seek your will,
[2:16] not my own. Surrender all my wants to
[2:21] you.
[2:23] And keep the first thing closed
[2:27] to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set
[2:32] my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you.
[2:38] All my desires reversed
[2:42] to keep the first thing first.
[2:46] Lord,
[2:49] to keep the first thing first.
[2:53] All my desires reverse.
[2:56] To keep the first thing first.
[3:01] Oh,
[3:04] to keep the first thing first.
[3:09] Oh,
[3:12] first thing first, I seek your will, not
[3:16] my own. Surrender all my wants to you
[3:22] and keep the first thing first
[3:27] to live your truth. Walk your ways. Set
[3:31] my eyes. Lord, I fix my face on you.
[3:37] All my desires reverse.
[3:41] To keep the first thing first,
[3:48] to keep the first thing first.
[3:56] To keep the first thing first.
[4:03] All my desires be reversed
[4:10] to keep the first thing first.
[4:16] [Applause]
