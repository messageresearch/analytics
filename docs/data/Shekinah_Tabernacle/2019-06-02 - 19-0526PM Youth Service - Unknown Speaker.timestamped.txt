[8:17] nope my on so yeah this afternoon
[8:24] I guess it's brother beans vision as a
[8:27] pastor to to encourage our youth there
[8:32] to see them grow into the ministry and
[8:35] to have opportunities to try things out
[8:39] you know to go this way or that way and
[8:41] learn so the the purpose of this
[8:45] services is to give opportunity to young
[8:48] people to my instruments to speak to
[8:53] leave music to just to do all those
[8:55] sorts of things and hopefully analyse
[9:01] intimidating environment in a normal
[9:03] service although we've pretty much if
[9:06] you look at this Joshua it's almost like
[9:08] this is this is bigger than the services
[9:10] I preached to this is even daunting for
[9:15] me it's like all these faces spirit back
[9:18] [Music]
[9:20] so brother Joshua was going to lead us

[10:11] happy right
[10:15] [Music]

[48:28] speaker I don't I don't like speaking
[48:29] I'd rather sing I have another public
[48:31] speaker and there I've been escaping it
[48:34] talking about the word in front of a pub
[48:36] in front of the public for a long time
[48:37] I've been running from England all the
[48:39] way for the bank quote me when I came to

[48:49] saying every single thing every of every
[48:51] single thing that was in my heart he was
[48:53] saying it yeah and and and and for me
[48:57] that was much more of a blessing because
[48:59] I was it was like hearing myself preach
[49:01] to myself you know and then you know I
[49:03] told him he dried me up I have nothing
[49:06] new to tell you and then my dad came
[49:09] this morning and preached that message
[49:10] and he also took a portion of what I had
[49:12] in my heart to do so I basically have
[49:14] not dried up and I have nothing left
[49:15] nothing there but I'll just back them up
[49:18] this and this this afternoon with the 10

[51:21] Lord may you dwell with us today Lord I

[51:25] and the brother Jesse and brother
[51:27] Kenneth who were to speak after me
[51:29] father Lord may you clear their minds
[51:31] Lord may you speak directly through them
[51:32] Lord all this we pray and ask in the
[51:35] precious name of Lord and Savior Jesus
[51:36] Christ amen amen
[51:38] let's give them a hot cup of praise okay
[51:45] amen I'm going to talk about I'm going
[51:47] to talk about war Amen I'm going to talk
[51:50] about the battlefield the battleground
[52:03] anyway so I mean really our young a man
[52:08] full of energy full of adventure full of
[52:10] a we want to go out they want to play
[52:11] football we're gonna play whatever
[52:13] interests that we have a man yeah them
[52:16] ambitions you know I want to be I don't
[52:18] know what you guys want to be maybe an
[52:19] astronaut or a scientist or you know
[52:22] you'll have your own ambitions but
[52:24] there's something that is lacking
[52:26] because the world is lacking something
[52:29] the world is lacking spirituality the
[52:33] word is lacking something that's missing
[52:36] from from the journey to become a happy
[52:40] I mean you can walk into a bookshop and
[52:42] you see you know self self would you
[52:44] call those books self care books you
[52:46] know how to be happy how to reach
[52:48] [Music]
[52:50] satisfaction in life you know take these
[52:52] 12 steps to be happy you know you know
[52:55] stretch out in the park and a yoga route
[52:57] you know to be happy yeah that's all
[52:59] well and good I mean if that helps you
[53:01] out that's that's cool but there's
[53:04] nothing more continuous and there's
[53:07] nothing more eternal than the joy you
[53:10] get from the word of God because all
[53:12] those books and all those things that
[53:14] you see out there
[53:15] it's the trying to reach a certain goal
[53:16] they're trying to get to something
[53:18] something that they know is missing yeah
[53:20] Amen I mean I mean that's why you can
[53:23] find the richest person in life oh you
[53:24] can have all the money in the world but
[53:26] before he goes to bed you pick up a
[53:28] bottle and drink that bottle empty to
[53:30] put himself to sleep Amen you find the
[53:33] poorest man wherever he is working hard
[53:35] don't know how many hours to allow the
[53:36] day I don't know before he goes to bed
[53:38] he will get that bottle and go to bed
[53:40] so on the opposite down on the opposite
[53:42] scale of society that we live in both
[53:44] worlds they're missing something they're
[53:46] missing something but we we are
[53:49] privileged here because we're not
[53:51] missing anything we have everything here
[53:54] so the Bible is which we should form our
[53:57] minds and personalities to the Bible
[53:59] amen we should we may not understand
[54:01] like like like what I said this morning
[54:03] we may not understand what we hear or
[54:06] what we see we may not get it but know
[54:09] this
[54:10] everything you need is in here and the
[54:13] only way to get it it's it's it's it's I
[54:16] know it's crazy out there you know you
[54:18] go to the canteen order to the
[54:20] restaurant to eat nobody's praying you'd
[54:22] only one prayer and all this weirdo I
[54:23] couldn't get em over there you know the
[54:27] conservative because you brain you cool
[54:29] I'm different Lord but you may feel very
[54:37] dry that you're not going anywhere you
[54:39] know that you have these treasures
[54:41] stacked up against you you know brother
[54:44] Brahim said that that that the most
[54:50] powerful weapon anybody can have is
[54:52] weapon of prayer I mean it doesn't
[54:55] matter how young you are doesn't matter
[54:57] how old you are
[54:58] I'm talking to the Joshua's now not to
[55:01] the Caleb's not to the older ones I'm
[55:03] talking to the young ones now and Joshua
[55:04] you know it wants with the energy to go
[55:06] and get that lense and when I mean land
[55:08] is not a physical mountain out there
[55:09] it's it's what you want it's your
[55:11] promise do you want a blessing or
[55:13] anything just go down on your knees and
[55:16] ask him and with sincerity and asked him
[55:19] Lord I'm small young I know you're real
[55:27] please give me an experience with you
[55:29] and you will build on that because the
[55:33] consequences of conforming to this life
[55:35] is not worth it I mean like like brother
[55:37] and I said this morning you can go out
[55:38] there brother Billy put the prophets son
[55:40] I mean it may seem like it don't deal in
[55:43] the preface son you know it's it's over
[55:45] and I'm going to heaven no he saw after
[55:48] witnessing all his his father's and
[55:51] miracles how how long am I going after
[55:58] his witness Oh
[56:00] Happy's witness on his father's miracles
[56:02] I mean brother the Prophet know there
[56:05] was still something missing it was an
[56:06] experience a deep thirst for the Lord he
[56:12] still went out and did what he had to do
[56:14] and then he was confronted with his in
[56:17] with his mortality and he ended up in
[56:20] that bed and that's when he realized
[56:21] that there was no
[56:22] out of the Word of God amen and today to
[56:27] make it more more realistic more
[56:30] applicable to our lives the world we
[56:33] live in there's no hope
[56:34] guys I don't want to I don't want to
[56:37] there's no hope you may see a guy or
[56:41] girl out there living life however you
[56:44] think like very happy smile and joyful
[56:47] you know coming out in New Zealand
[56:49] there's a situation going on
[56:50] no just nice even around the world is
[56:53] there mental health crisis
[56:55] is it deep mental health crisis and the
[56:59] government doesn't know what to do it's
[57:00] experiment after experiment there is a
[57:04] there's a research after research no one
[57:08] knows what's going on are the psychology
[57:10] student I'm in the midst of it I get
[57:13] taught about it
[57:14] the book of cycle is about this big the
[57:16] clinic Bible of psychology or the human
[57:18] problems or here a lot of pages so lots
[57:21] of pages and I like weight against my
[57:25] book claim my point is that the happiest
[57:33] person know that as long as you're after
[57:35] of the blood outside of the Word of God
[57:37] you will come to a point where your mind
[57:40] can't take the pressure of the world
[57:41] anything and you begin to break down
[57:44] slowly and you'll come to a point in
[57:46] life where you're not able to take that
[57:48] pressure anymore because you have
[57:49] nothing to lay your burdens in you have
[57:52] you have nothing to to to lean on you
[57:58] have family around you but you still be
[57:59] alone as long as you have God with you
[58:02] guys you don't only have something that
[58:06] will sustain you we're going through
[58:08] hard times you have something to give
[58:10] you I think the Prophet said unspeakable
[58:13] joy unspeakable something different
[58:17] spirit something words cannot brother
[58:19] aunt knows about that something words
[58:22] cannot describe amen that's that kind of
[58:25] joy that this world is looking for that
[58:27] he gave you and the devil will fight
[58:29] against it
[58:30] and you pebbles sitting out here you
[58:33] pebbles you're more than conquerors
[58:35] amen you're more than able hallelujah
[58:38] amen amen so the second part of that
[58:42] verse before I go the second part of
[58:45] that verse it says be it transformed by
[58:48] the renewing of your mind
[58:50] amen so even though it's a battle it's
[58:53] it's a warfare because things aren't
[58:55] just physical you know the mic neech's
[58:57] you know yeah yeah it's cool like we
[59:00] everything it's physical but there's two
[59:02] things going on there's a there's a
[59:04] different dimension that we don't
[59:06] actually see heaven and hell I hear is
[59:10] here there's no hell you're going under
[59:12] there's no heaven I don't know but
[59:14] heaven on earth is right here now the
[59:17] important part is what you tune your
[59:20] spirits into if you wake up in the
[59:24] morning and I'm telling you that I am a
[59:27] testimony of this I used to go out I
[59:30] just wake up in morning just leave the
[59:31] house yeah you know and things would
[59:36] happen things would definitely go wrong
[59:38] and I react to negative ways and things
[59:40] would happen boom you know I'm back to
[59:41] square one when I began to leave the
[59:44] house after I said a prayer I began to
[59:47] win battle that never I never actually
[59:51] took their battles I began to realize
[59:53] that something was really happening here
[59:55] there was something behind me and the
[59:57] move I realized that the more I realize
[59:59] that this button is not my own that
[1:00:01] everything that happens in our lives
[1:00:04] happens for a reason and if we don't
[1:00:07] have the right kind of backbone if we
[1:00:09] don't have the right kind of something
[1:00:11] to fall back on we'll lose all lives and
[1:00:14] losing I don't mean in losing I mean
[1:00:17] this is I'll be realistic this mental
[1:00:20] health crisis that's going on right now
[1:00:21] we will delve right in there and we will
[1:00:24] hit that ground so I think the best
[1:00:28] thing for us to do with the young was
[1:00:30] young people right now is try and find
[1:00:33] our purpose and when I say purpose I
[1:00:35] don't mean ambitiously looking for
[1:00:37] something to you know to do I mean try
[1:00:40] and find who you really are
[1:00:42] who you who you really are where the
[1:00:45] been said is before in the Old Testament
[1:00:46] is full of stories many many stories you
[1:00:49] know as you grow up you begin to read
[1:00:51] those stories you will find an identity
[1:00:52] you find someone whose life is similar
[1:00:55] to yours someone whose life is oh and
[1:00:58] this happens no that's mean I know oh oh
[1:01:00] oh that's me and then you see the Lord
[1:01:05] in that person's life and then that
[1:01:07] becomes your identity so who is the
[1:01:11] devil to come up to me like oh you can't
[1:01:12] make it
[1:01:13] well you can't you jump you can't shout
[1:01:14] like you know God doesn't love you or
[1:01:16] that's your battle that's when you have
[1:01:19] to realize who you who you are and
[1:01:21] you'll repel you're that pebble that the
[1:01:23] Lord bless when David picks that sling
[1:01:25] up and let loose and you can destroy any
[1:01:28] trial anything nothing can stand between
[1:01:31] you and your promise what whatever you
[1:01:35] need whatever whatever you want Amen God
[1:01:38] would be with you he said even before
[1:01:41] with you even with you even in you and
[1:01:46] the Lord is in you it devil has no space
[1:01:50] has no issue has nothing
[1:01:53] amen and just before I leave I see what
[1:02:04] you mean by the end elated time flies
[1:02:06] time does fly when you I'm gonna cut
[1:02:11] this down but um yeah yeah as soon as
[1:02:20] you realize find your purpose in the
[1:02:23] Word of God that's when the Lord can use
[1:02:25] you to do anything I mean you don't even
[1:02:29] have to go outside and tell people what
[1:02:31] you believe like this is the Bible this
[1:02:33] is what I do
[1:02:33] Romans 12 said this and I'm this yeah
[1:02:36] that's me you don't have to do that all
[1:02:39] you have to do is live according to the
[1:02:41] life that you have learned in the Word
[1:02:44] of God and that means even if it's a
[1:02:47] verse a day start somewhere even if your
[1:02:50] prayer come if even if your prayer is
[1:02:52] five minutes or two minutes yeah let it
[1:02:55] be
[1:02:56] Lester and you will grow as you age just
[1:02:59] say a prayer with the verse and be on
[1:03:01] your way
[1:03:02] amen and the person you meet outside
[1:03:04] you'll be they will see the glory of God
[1:03:07] and anything that you do and that's how
[1:03:09] you bless somebody that's how you that's
[1:03:11] just that's how you become a witness one
[1:03:14] way you become a witness
[1:03:15] amen amen so I just want to just before
[1:03:18] I leave I just want to read joshua 1:8
[1:03:21] just to you I mean who's a Joshua in
[1:03:27] here are you well Joshua's amen amen
[1:03:31] hallelujah so Joshua 1 verse 8
[1:03:53] I can find it myself
[1:04:05] yes so Joshua one verse 8 and 9 are read
[1:04:10] out II it says this book of the law
[1:04:16] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[1:04:21] thou shalt meditate meditate therein day
[1:04:24] and night that thou mayst observe and do
[1:04:28] accordingly to all that is written
[1:04:30] therein well then thou shalt make thy
[1:04:37] way prosperous and then thou shalt have
[1:04:41] good success so I would say as long as
[1:04:44] you keep this Word of God within you
[1:04:46] below to be before you any single thing
[1:04:48] that you do amen you were able to do
[1:04:50] anything that you need to do Amen you
[1:04:52] were able to control your emotions
[1:04:54] you're able to do those things you never
[1:04:56] thought you could have ever done amen
[1:04:59] and verse 9 says have I not commanded
[1:05:02] thee be strong and of a good courage be
[1:05:08] not afraid neither be thou dismayed so
[1:05:13] it's saying this is it's it's not
[1:05:14] telling you that nothing to make you
[1:05:17] upset or dismay you will not happen
[1:05:19] those things will definitely happen
[1:05:21] you'll come to a situation where you
[1:05:23] will fill this mail you'll feel
[1:05:26] discouraged you you you'll feel fearful
[1:05:29] but it's telling you I've given I've
[1:05:31] given you myself to help you so be not
[1:05:35] afraid because I'm there with you amen
[1:05:38] but the LORD thy God is with thee
[1:05:41] whithersoever thou goest even as long as
[1:05:45] you believe that young people as long as
[1:05:48] you believe that amen
[1:05:50] anything is suppose you've won the
[1:05:52] victory

[1:08:54] them all you see they're all out nice
[1:08:55] good friends know they and they actually
[1:08:57] a very gracious crowd you know they they
[1:09:00] like you you like the immense a nice
[1:09:01] atmosphere it's a bit harder when maybe
[1:09:03] if you're up some Ernie didn't really
[1:09:05] and if they didn't like you it's hard to
[1:09:06] talk all these people like you and this
[1:09:25] is kind of a nice and there's a nice
[1:09:29] Dunham to the you know it is it's a
[1:09:32] one-sided conversation that means you
[1:09:37] get to do all the they don't
[1:09:39] really you know when you're having a
[1:09:41] conversation sometimes someone is
[1:09:44] talking a lot and you've got a great
[1:09:45] thing to say but you have to wait till
[1:09:47] they finish like say Adam Anders talking
[1:09:48] talking talking and you've got something
[1:09:54] awesome you want to say and use that
[1:09:57] thinking about what you want to say and
[1:10:00] you stop listening to him you're just
[1:10:02] waiting for him to stop so you can
[1:10:03] quickly say it and when he finishes if
[1:10:06] you're a good Christian brother you say
[1:10:08] yes good brother even actually hear what
[1:10:10] he said
[1:10:12] and then you say you're me then us
[1:10:15] together I was it just me I love brother
[1:10:24] out of mine I'm gonna hand it over to GC
[1:10:33] now and
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:45] um could I please have the first slide
[1:10:47] up the scripture on Tori so today I'd
[1:10:59] like to speak about spirits and powers
[1:11:01] and um so I want to go straight into
[1:11:05] before I do this I want let's just bow
[1:11:08] our heads and we're no work here Amen
[1:11:11] Lord Jesus um thank you that we can all
[1:11:14] be here tonight Lord and please just let
[1:11:17] the service go well Lord and let me not
[1:11:19] get too nervous and let um yeah just and
[1:11:23] thank you for the word this morning
[1:11:25] water and just not me so could we go to
[1:11:30] Nixon I mean I got a scripture it's from
[1:11:37] John 1911
[1:11:51] and jesus answered the our colors have
[1:11:55] no power it was all against me except it
[1:11:58] were given thee from above therefore he
[1:12:01] had delivered me and unto thee and hath
[1:12:04] the greater son so God's powers over
[1:12:07] everyone in the world and when you have
[1:12:11] God's power there's nothing to fear
[1:12:16] we see this ending on the Lions Den
[1:12:18] those lines couldn't touch him because
[1:12:20] he was God was in them and he had the
[1:12:22] power from Jesus even now as close as
[1:12:26] those lines got they just couldn't touch
[1:12:27] him
[1:12:29] could have balloons closes they want ya
[1:12:37] wanna go it's quite quick cuz I'm don't
[1:12:40] want to lose too much time like wanna do
[1:12:44] me
[1:12:44] I need get through my stuff I mean these
[1:12:53] um I've gotten few scriptures to read
[1:12:55] actually but they're just this one right
[1:12:57] now but truly I'm full of the same one
[1:13:00] no but truly I'm full of power by the
[1:13:04] Spirit of the Lord and of judgment and
[1:13:06] of might and to declare unto Jacob is
[1:13:08] transition and to Israel it's in mm so
[1:13:12] Lord has a lot of power and more than we
[1:13:15] think
[1:13:16] I mean he's full of power now we see
[1:13:23] this and also in Moses and the Red Sea
[1:13:27] now if you go to a beach or something
[1:13:29] you know it's gonna go up there and say
[1:13:30] oh what a betta party that's not really
[1:13:32] gonna happen but it did happen and when
[1:13:35] Moses that massive sea was huge
[1:13:38] he made it - um split into two sides so
[1:13:42] they could get across now that is a lot
[1:13:45] of power God has a model
[1:13:47] you wouldn't need a lot of power to do
[1:13:49] that yeah I've got the slide at the end
[1:13:53] so don't want to waste too much but boy
[1:14:01] um some my memory from a schoolteacher
[1:14:04] my mum we had to learn this in our
[1:14:08] Sunday school this and so some of you
[1:14:09] might not for you wrestle not against
[1:14:11] flesh and blood but against proceeding
[1:14:13] empowers and against the rulers of
[1:14:15] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:14:17] wickedness in high places and there's a
[1:14:22] story that brother that this woman she
[1:14:26] was walking and she goes to bound down
[1:14:30] down by her party wish Easter party and
[1:14:32] that she know there's a spirit in there
[1:14:35] but she's partying and she's but she's
[1:14:38] just become a Christian and so she was
[1:14:41] like ah she lied or shy not maybe I can
[1:14:43] go in there and help the people find
[1:14:46] Jesus and then she wind there and came
[1:14:50] out in me and she went to brother
[1:14:51] branham's house and brother Brent and
[1:14:53] you know and he said the spirits there
[1:14:56] and then the spirit came out of her and
[1:14:58] written about like a bat who like came
[1:15:00] out of her and a bet and they saw star
[1:15:02] and their brother Brandon's brother I
[1:15:05] think it was dad screaming yep yes so
[1:15:11] and we see brother Brenda Mia who's come
[1:15:14] before on God's ministry and I had a lot
[1:15:18] of power in him hit the he raised all
[1:15:21] those people came to life through
[1:15:23] brother Brennan you know they were blind
[1:15:24] people there that receive their sight
[1:15:26] people with cancer they I was so close
[1:15:28] to dying got healed there be one there
[1:15:34] was a woman that got her eyes back
[1:15:37] and one person's League got put back
[1:15:45] open the eyes and this is from acts
[1:15:48] 26:18
[1:15:49] to open their eyes and tune them from
[1:15:51] darkness to light and the power of Satan
[1:15:54] unto God that they may receive a
[1:15:56] forgiveness and sin and inheritance
[1:15:57] among them which are satisfied
[1:15:59] sanctified by faith that is in me now
[1:16:04] brother Branham didn't fight the people
[1:16:06] without what I was finding his support
[1:16:08] fought the spirit that was a new and

[1:24:09] that he may abide with you forever now I
[1:24:12] would speak about it but I heard from
[1:24:15] brother Brennan that you must make
[1:24:17] scriptures simple not too complicated so
[1:24:20] I don't want to go further on that but I
[1:24:23] would like us to bow our head so you can
[1:24:24] pray dear Lord Lord I know you in this
[1:24:29] place and well I just want to say thank
[1:24:32] you so much for giving us all the
[1:24:33] opportunity to be here tonight I mean
[1:24:35] today and just want to say Lord just
[1:24:39] help me now when I speak because
[1:24:41] sometimes I stutter whenever I'm in
[1:24:43] front of in front of like a lot of
[1:24:45] people Lord just want to say please can
[1:24:47] you help me with that and all of our
[1:24:49] struggles Lord can you can I pray that
[1:24:51] you just fix them all and just touch us
[1:24:53] all tonight but today and I just want to
[1:24:55] say thank you Lord for everything
[1:24:57] early Martin in me Jesus Christ so I'm
[1:25:00] gonna be talking about my baptism and
[1:25:03] how I was baptized
[1:25:04] so when Durbin vall was was my school in
[1:25:09] Cape Town there was there was someone
[1:25:12] that came to our school who was talking
[1:25:14] about Christianity and he said something
[1:25:17] about baptism and then he moved to
[1:25:19] something completely different without
[1:25:21] like staying on it and something just
[1:25:23] said to me remember
[1:25:24] baptism remember what baptized is and I
[1:25:28] went home and asked my mom mom what is
[1:25:30] it and she said to me that it is when
[1:25:33] you when you have when you want to give
[1:25:35] your life to the Lord and when you when
[1:25:38] you when you ready and so after that I
[1:25:41] was always having this thing in me
[1:25:43] saying I want to get baptized and it's
[1:25:47] it kept on happening and kept on
[1:25:49] happening and in two months we went to
[1:25:51] Australia and we went to visit my uncle
[1:25:55] and he went see brother Gary's church
[1:25:58] and he I was I was too nervous to ask
[1:26:02] him for me to be baptized and then he
[1:26:07] said he said is if there's anyone who
[1:26:09] wants to be baptized and I was I was
[1:26:12] like oh and then I went I went and he
[1:26:15] said that one of the sisters were
[1:26:17] learning there Paul
[1:26:18] to us so now went and got I went to the
[1:26:22] pool and I wanted to get baptized
[1:26:24] so I wins I got my son in costume on I
[1:26:27] went in the water and it was very cold
[1:26:30] because it's Australia so so it was I
[1:26:36] went in the water and I was I think the
[1:26:40] devil touched me at that moment and said
[1:26:42] you're not ready you you you're a
[1:26:45] failure you're never gonna walk with the
[1:26:46] Lord and well I was I was thinking about
[1:26:50] that but it was too late and so I just
[1:26:52] went good dog into the water so but when
[1:27:01] I went in the water I I was looking up
[1:27:03] and I like froze for a second and I saw
[1:27:05] it looked like the water was frozen and
[1:27:08] there was like particles of the water
[1:27:09] and I could see the Sun a tiny bit and I
[1:27:12] just felt like like everything just
[1:27:14] released right off for me I felt like I
[1:27:16] felt like I was at overpressure tying
[1:27:18] something just poked me you know so I
[1:27:22] got out of the got out of the water went
[1:27:26] into the car opened the window and I
[1:27:28] just felt so free again I just felt and
[1:27:30] then but then my mom said to me that
[1:27:32] after you baptized you weren't feel you
[1:27:35] won't feel all the time it's like you
[1:27:37] won't feel good all the time it's worse
[1:27:38] it's worse than it was before you were
[1:27:41] baptized I mean after you baptized now
[1:27:43] so so before I was baptized my goal was
[1:27:49] to keep the Lord up and to keep the
[1:27:50] devil down but so yeah so the goal was
[1:27:54] to keep the devil down and then you know
[1:27:56] when he gets to the fall just go so so
[1:28:01] but after I was baptized when I moved
[1:28:04] back to hey well when I went back to
[1:28:06] Cape Town it's like almost like all the
[1:28:09] technology just hit me and said let us
[1:28:12] do this and like all these bad things
[1:28:14] are happening to me at school and with
[1:28:18] many different things and then my mom
[1:28:23] got the opportunity to move to New
[1:28:25] Zealand and it was it was quite a fast
[1:28:28] process it was like one month notice and
[1:28:30] the next month we gone
[1:28:32] and we had we had like three days to
[1:28:34] pack our laughs and we're gone and then
[1:28:36] when we came here I said to sister
[1:28:39] Christine this is my home and this is
[1:28:41] like this is the best place ever and I'm
[1:28:44] gonna love this place and then I met the
[1:28:48] church er which was one of the best
[1:28:50] things ever happened to me because and
[1:28:52] keeps on we don't have a church we do
[1:28:53] have churches but it isn't very nice
[1:28:55] churches if oh no no it's not very nice
[1:28:58] it's nice but it's like it's just it's
[1:29:06] [Laughter]
[1:29:10] it's different so we so the church here
[1:29:16] is as much with the churches
[1:29:19] I like the church here it was it was but
[1:29:27] but I met the schools here which of the
[1:29:29] schools aren't very nice and I'm gonna
[1:29:30] say that because that's true the school
[1:29:32] the school that I go to there's a lot of
[1:29:34] swearing there's there's bullying
[1:29:37] there's mean teachers I say mean
[1:29:40] teachers this it's pretty mean teachers
[1:29:42] yeah cuz they in Kate's on the school
[1:29:47] that I was in it wasn't it was it was a
[1:29:48] Christian school but yes it's much
[1:29:52] different and I think the one day I got
[1:29:53] peer pressured by someone they said to
[1:29:56] me that I had to sway about something I
[1:29:58] don't know like I'm not gonna say what
[1:30:01] word was obviously yeah but they wanted
[1:30:04] me to say this word and I just said no
[1:30:06] no no and I left it and now I'm just I'm
[1:30:10] just so happy that the Lord led me here
[1:30:12] without doing any of those bad things
[1:30:13] and just and like earlier earlier today
[1:30:18] when we're in brother Andy prayed for us
[1:30:21] and said about the refilling of of the
[1:30:24] Holy Ghost I I was crying because I I
[1:30:28] lifted up my hand and as soon as I
[1:30:30] lifted up my hand my hands started
[1:30:31] shaking I was like just I just felt so
[1:30:33] happy and this is one last thing I want
[1:30:38] to talk about it's about a ghost those
[1:30:41] in our house when we moved here so our
[1:30:44] shopping
[1:30:45] just arrived for quite a while ago
[1:30:47] Andrew and we were busy putting together
[1:30:49] a chair in my room and I have two
[1:30:52] walkie-talkies that were just charged
[1:30:54] and I put them in the lounge and one of
[1:30:56] them started ringing and I was and I was
[1:30:59] in the room and it just kept on ringing
[1:31:02] and I said to my mom mom can we please
[1:31:04] go check that what that was so I walked
[1:31:06] up I went we went into the room and it
[1:31:11] felt it I was first I was really scared
[1:31:13] because the walkie-talkie was ringing
[1:31:14] and then as soon as I went near it it
[1:31:15] rang again and then I looked behind me
[1:31:18] and we had there we have the laundry
[1:31:19] room right behind the laundry room was
[1:31:22] wrapped behind me and I heard something
[1:31:24] banging as hard as they could like
[1:31:26] banging against the washing machine and
[1:31:28] I was then I went to the kitchen and I
[1:31:32] said to and then just something told me
[1:31:34] just pray just close your eye I mean
[1:31:37] just pray and just pray because there is
[1:31:39] something in the house and you need to
[1:31:40] get rid of it just something told me and
[1:31:44] the I don't know where I heard it from
[1:31:47] heard it from someone someone said to me
[1:31:49] if these ghosts or something in your
[1:31:52] house and you eventually find that it's
[1:31:56] there you would feel like a shocking
[1:31:58] thing through your head like it would
[1:31:59] feel like you're here standing up and
[1:32:01] that was something I was very frightened
[1:32:03] of and then as soon as I started praying
[1:32:05] my hair it felt like my hair was like
[1:32:07] fuzzing up and it was all standing up
[1:32:10] and I said and I said I said demon get
[1:32:14] out of the house and I prayed about it
[1:32:16] but when I was busy praying I felt like
[1:32:17] I was gonna fall over like everything
[1:32:19] inside me just been numb and I was I was
[1:32:21] holding against the cupboard and I was
[1:32:23] just like me it was horrible but after
[1:32:27] that I it it left the house because I
[1:32:31] know it did because I believe it did
[1:32:33] and me and my mom went back to the room
[1:32:37] and I took the walkie talkies and then I
[1:32:40] think the Lord told us that the walkie
[1:32:41] talkies did that whenever it was flat so
[1:32:45] the walkie talkies were only ringing
[1:32:47] because it was flat and it just just
[1:32:50] just showed me that that I must always
[1:32:52] pray whenever whenever this like
[1:32:53] something bad in our house to try get
[1:32:55] rid of it and I don't know if I've got I
[1:32:57] don't know if I've gone over time
[1:32:59] but there's one quick little one about
[1:33:00] the warts simply so when I came here we
[1:33:05] had a foot washing which is the first
[1:33:08] time I've ever had it and brother been
[1:33:11] city wants to wash my feet
[1:33:12] so we went into the room and I was I was
[1:33:15] telling brother brother been pleased and
[1:33:17] washed my feet because I have water on
[1:33:18] him and I had warts I had warts I had
[1:33:20] two ingrown watts which worth me for
[1:33:22] like seven years and then I had one just
[1:33:27] like there in places and I told by the
[1:33:32] baby please don't wash my feet don't
[1:33:33] wash my feet and then we prayed and then
[1:33:35] I washed his feet and then I think week
[1:33:38] later or two weeks later I was looking
[1:33:41] at I looked at my foot and I was
[1:33:42] wondering where my warts were and I was
[1:33:45] like where's where's my wart that's and

[1:41:43] Hey
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:58] okay
[1:41:59] just before I pray I just wanted to
[1:42:02] share a testimony that I'm happened to
[1:42:05] me you may have your seats so what
[1:42:09] happened was this one Wednesday night I
[1:42:12] was standing I was we were standing and
[1:42:16] we were coming to church and I I didn't
[1:42:23] have anything to do in here and I know
[1:42:26] and I didn't I wasn't I'm not you really
[1:42:29] used to being outside and standing there
[1:42:32] where everyone is now so I decided I
[1:42:36] don't want to be here so I'm gonna stand
[1:42:38] back in the mother's room and I was
[1:42:41] standing there and then brother kress
[1:42:44] and brother Ben they asked me what was
[1:42:46] wrong and I said nothing was wrong but
[1:42:49] something was torturing me just telling
[1:42:53] me Sunday now it's not gonna be good
[1:42:56] you're not gonna be able to do it you're
[1:42:58] gonna you're too shy you your voice is
[1:43:01] too bad no one's gonna like it and then
[1:43:04] I was standing back there and I just
[1:43:06] started crying because I didn't know
[1:43:10] what it was and then when my mum started
[1:43:13] talking to me
[1:43:14] I noticed the devil was trying to get me
[1:43:16] back there and I he didn't want me to be
[1:43:18] standing here where I am right now he
[1:43:21] didn't want me to be here he didn't want
[1:43:23] me to do anything and then my dad came
[1:43:27] anything he was looking for me and we
[1:43:29] talked and everything and then I went
[1:43:33] and I wiped my tears off and then I came
[1:43:36] and I stood here and then after that
[1:43:40] when we were praying this morning I was
[1:43:44] still having that feeling but when
[1:43:46] brother and he said lift up your hands
[1:43:49] and if you want to be prayed lift up
[1:43:53] your hands
[1:43:54] cuz the whole he goes this year and if
[1:43:56] you want the whole ego so it'll come but
[1:44:00] not only did that happen the spirit
[1:44:02] lifts me and I said now I felt the
[1:44:06] courage to come up here and I knew I
[1:44:08] there was nothing telling me to come to
[1:44:12] not be so he knows our name and he is
[1:44:24] the maker so just like Caleb said the
[1:44:27] warts got taken away he's the one who
[1:44:30] makes everything he made the warts he
[1:44:33] made everything so you can decide if he
[1:44:35] wants to take it away so that no one
[1:44:38] ever gets it again or you can take away
[1:44:40] it away from one person for once or
[1:44:43] forever you can do anything because he
[1:44:46] made this world people think it's
[1:44:49] builders that made this church but
[1:44:52] actually no it's not the builders it's
[1:44:54] God Jay's been asking me since we've
[1:45:05] gotten eat since we were outside can we
[1:45:09] sing Jubilee I said okay then
