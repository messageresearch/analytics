[14:02] um good evening everyone welcome here
[14:05] tonight just before we officially open
[14:07] now part of the service we're um just
[14:09] going to have the Liz the um Camp
[14:14] mother um just take us through the camp
[14:18] [Applause]
[14:25] information vation area is out on the
[14:27] field just out there parked along the
[14:29] side of the fence there just on the
[14:31] opposite side of that outside the the I
[14:34] think it's brown housee that's there um
[14:36] is the evacuation area if we need to
[14:39] evacuate for a fire but if it's an
[14:41] earthquake then it's just going to be
[14:44] the drop cover hold and if you watch
[14:46] television you'll see that the best
[14:47] place to stay is in bed last night um
[14:50] they said that um so it will just be
[14:53] drop cover hold and wait till the
[14:55] shaking stopped and if you can get to
[14:57] the evacuation area then then that's
[14:59] where we go to um there are um just four
[15:04] hygiene reasons this time at Camp I am
[15:06] going to put outside the office on the
[15:09] long bench seat some hand tows and bath
[15:12] mats if you want to swap yours out
[15:13] tomorrow and there's a green container
[15:15] that you can put the other ones into in
[15:17] Lake Lodge I'll probably use a flexi tub
[15:20] and put some in there and if you're in
[15:22] the Lakeside Villas if you just want to
[15:24] bring up your towels if you want to have
[15:26] them swapped if you don't want to have
[15:27] them swapped that's fine as well but if
[15:28] you want those swapped out then just
[15:30] hopefully I will be in the office if I'm
[15:32] not I'm possibly in the laundry or the
[15:34] kitchen or somewhere around and we can
[15:37] swap those out for you
[15:40] um things in the playground one person
[15:43] at a time on the trampoline um there
[15:45] were a couple of kids that thought that
[15:47] because they were under 100 kilos that
[15:49] they could both be on there but we risk
[15:51] things like injuries and head banging
[15:53] and stuff like that and neither Ben or I
[15:55] want to call an ambulance out for an
[15:57] accident so it is one person regardless
[15:59] of how heavy they are um the tire swing
[16:02] is a maximum of four people if you're on
[16:05] the roundabout please sit down on there
[16:09] um and then just yeah if you've got any

[51:04] some few worship songs to the Lord
[51:06] before we call up um brother Andrew this
[51:10] evening and um you know many of you come
[51:13] from we all come from different walks of
[51:15] life and our experience to get to the
[51:17] camp was you know it's all different
[51:18] some people live nearby some people
[51:20] travel a long way some people uh have
[51:23] been looking forward to this all year
[51:24] other people maybe it was the last
[51:26] minute to ision just to come and and
[51:28] some maybe didn't want to come and are
[51:30] nervous and
[51:32] and even you know not sure about God or
[51:35] just anything like that and
[51:38] and but I just I've
[51:41] just I want to the next few songs I want
[51:44] to sing are an expression of the heart
[51:46] of God to each one of us you know if
[51:48] there's anyone here that's unsure about
[51:50] God I can let you know that he's a good
[51:52] God that we serve a good God and that he
[51:55] he loves us and his heart is for us you
[51:57] I was looking at a there was a little
[51:59] meme it said um a picture it said you
[52:02] know thanking our heavenly father for
[52:04] whatever it is that we can thank him for
[52:05] and someone had commented there you know
[52:07] I thank my heavenly father for life and
[52:09] things like that and and my cousin
[52:12] actually of all people my
[52:16] cousin wrote a comment there and he said
[52:18] in the words of Slayer God hates us
[52:20] all and I thought you know that's a lie
[52:23] that's not the truth that Slayer is some
[52:26] death metal band that's not the truth he
[52:29] didn't he got that information from the
[52:31] wrong place because the God I know is
[52:33] not willing that anyone should perish
[52:35] but that all should come to the
[52:36] knowledge of the truth and and that's
[52:40] the god that we we come to this morning

[1:03:03] seven course Feast for those who will
[1:03:04] come and dine and I don't know about you
[1:03:06] tonight but I don't want to be like
[1:03:08] those in the Bible that found excuses
[1:03:10] amen not to come Feast at the table amen
[1:03:13] I know tonight we may come here and it's
[1:03:15] the first night of the meeting and amen
[1:03:17] I know there's always that element of
[1:03:18] tiredness and amen but I know tonight
[1:03:20] the Lord has something special for us
[1:03:22] and amen we know that wherever two or
[1:03:24] three are gathered together he made a
[1:03:26] promise he said there I will come and be
[1:03:28] in their midst and you know tonight I
[1:03:30] was just hearing the prophet of God say
[1:03:32] it today he said you know he said it's
[1:03:34] not how many's there he said it's the
[1:03:37] attitude of the two or three that are
[1:03:38] there and you know tonight there's a
[1:03:40] whole house full of Believers here amen
[1:03:43] but if we have the wrong attitude there
[1:03:44] won't be one promise come to pass amen
[1:03:47] but if we can all find that right mental
[1:03:49] attitude amen then all things are
[1:03:51] possible tonight and I wonder before we
[1:03:53] open the word if we could just buy our
[1:03:54] hearts together for word of prayer as
[1:03:57] they just play that softly tonight I
[1:03:59] know as we said this is the first night
[1:04:01] of the meeting how many's come here with
[1:04:03] an expectation something you're Desiring
[1:04:05] from the Lord amen I know he will meet
[1:04:08] your expectation tonight let's just
[1:04:10] approach him Heavenly
[1:04:12] Father Lord As We Gather here this
[1:04:14] afternoon on this first night of these
[1:04:16] meetings Lord Believers have gathered
[1:04:19] here from different walks of life
[1:04:20] different areas Lord different parts of
[1:04:23] the world different parts of this
[1:04:24] country Lord but father we've come here
[1:04:27] for one motive and one objective and
[1:04:29] that is to lift up the name that is
[1:04:30] above every name for lord your word said
[1:04:33] if I be lifted up I will draw all men
[1:04:36] into myself and Lord we know there's no
[1:04:39] name given in Heaven and Earth whereby
[1:04:41] men might be saved but at the name of
[1:04:43] Jesus and Lord we know the devil hates
[1:04:45] that name the world hates that name Lord
[1:04:48] they've done everything they can to kill
[1:04:50] the influence of that name but Lord your
[1:04:53] word prophesied that you would raise up
[1:04:54] a people for that name's sake and Lord
[1:04:57] standing before me tonight as a group of
[1:04:59] people that you've raised up for the
[1:05:01] name of Jesus and Lord As We Gather here
[1:05:03] tonight we just want to speak the name
[1:05:05] of Jesus over every heart the name of
[1:05:08] Jesus over every life over every
[1:05:10] situation Lord you see the needs here
[1:05:12] that's represented Lord maybe some would
[1:05:14] think their need is so great that Lord
[1:05:17] nothing could happen that would help
[1:05:18] them maybe some would think their need
[1:05:20] was insignificant but Lord we know
[1:05:22] tonight there's no need too great
[1:05:24] there's no need too small
[1:05:26] but Lord when your spirit begins to move
[1:05:28] the spirit of God Lord will move upon
[1:05:31] the face of the conditions and will
[1:05:32] bring a transformation father We join
[1:05:35] our hearts together tonight we lay aside
[1:05:37] tiredness oh God lord we lay aside the
[1:05:40] cares of life and the situations oh God
[1:05:43] and Lord bring us into one mind and one
[1:05:45] Accord under great expectation Lord
[1:05:48] father I believe there's events that are
[1:05:49] going to transpire here this weekend

[1:05:57] of the enemy Lord we bind the hand of

[1:08:00] you have your Bibles we want to go to
[1:08:02] the book of St Luke the 16th chapter we
[1:08:05] have a few places we want to read
[1:08:07] tonight we're going to begin in St Luke
[1:08:09] 16 and then also Philippians 3 and 2
[1:08:13] Corinthians chapter 4 amen amen you love
[1:08:17] the Lord tonight
[1:08:19] amen in St Luke chapter
[1:08:22] 16 in verse number 16
[1:08:27] Jesus here is
[1:08:28] speaking and he says now the law and the
[1:08:31] prophets were un John and since that
[1:08:34] time the kingdom of God is preached and
[1:08:38] every man presseth into it so there is a
[1:08:42] preaching and there is a pressing the
[1:08:46] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[1:08:49] presseth into it now in the book of
[1:08:52] Philippians chapter 3
[1:08:55] Philippians chapter 3 I want to read a a
[1:08:59] very familiar reading there in
[1:09:02] Philippians chapter 3 and verse number
[1:09:05] 13 Philippians 3 and verse number
[1:09:09] 13 Paul here writing he says now
[1:09:12] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:09:15] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:09:18] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:09:21] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:09:23] which are before so Paul is saying there
[1:09:26] are some things behind us but really
[1:09:29] they're worth forgetting and moving
[1:09:31] forward to what's in front of us now
[1:09:34] watch what he says I press toward the
[1:09:36] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:09:40] of God in Christ Jesus so he's going to
[1:09:43] have to press forward into what God has
[1:09:47] in front of him now one other place I
[1:09:49] want to look with you is in 2
[1:09:51] Corinthians chapter 4 uh We've read here
[1:09:54] in Luke 16 where the Bible tells us that
[1:09:57] we press Philippians chapter
[1:10:00] 3 we read about pressing I want to
[1:10:03] identify here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[1:10:06] and verse 13 the way that we press Paul
[1:10:10] here writing says we having the same
[1:10:13] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[1:10:16] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:10:19] spoken now we also believe and therefore
[1:10:23] we speak you say how do we pray press
[1:10:25] well the way we press is we believe the
[1:10:28] things that are spoken and then we begin
[1:10:31] to say the things that have already been
[1:10:33] said and by saying those things we press
[1:10:35] forward now I want to read Verse 18 in 2
[1:10:39] Corinthians 4:13 down to the 18th verse
[1:10:43] Paul says now while we look not at the
[1:10:45] things which are seen But at the things
[1:10:48] which are not seen for the things which
[1:10:50] are seen are temporal but the things
[1:10:53] which are not seen are Eternal we ask
[1:10:57] the Lord this evening to add the
[1:10:58] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:11:00] you can have your seats here uh this
[1:11:02] afternoon I want you by the help of the
[1:11:04] Lord for just a few moments tonight if I
[1:11:06] would title this sermon I want to talk
[1:11:08] to you on this pressing by faith into
[1:11:11] the realities of the Unseen pressing by
[1:11:14] faith into the realities of the Unseen
[1:11:17] now uh we look there at that word press
[1:11:20] and of course Webster will Define it he
[1:11:22] says now to press means to move or to
[1:11:25] call calls to move into a position of
[1:11:28] contact with someone or something by
[1:11:31] exerting continuous physical Force so
[1:11:34] when something actually uh is pressing
[1:11:37] you're actually moving into a position
[1:11:39] of contact now we all know the prophet
[1:11:41] of God would tell us that the most
[1:11:43] powerful force Amen on the face of the
[1:11:46] earth is a Believer who is in contact
[1:11:49] with his maker now just to lay a
[1:11:51] foundation here I want to read a couple
[1:11:53] quotes beginning here in 1949 n brother
[1:11:56] speaking upon the subject of Science and
[1:11:58] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:12:00] vision he said and I just thinking of
[1:12:02] how that science how they are taking the
[1:12:05] natural man and how he's went into the
[1:12:06] research from the fall of the natural
[1:12:08] and what he has done and how little the
[1:12:11] spiritual man has progressed in the
[1:12:13] kingdom of God he said I was thinking
[1:12:16] that the natural man went out at the
[1:12:17] Unseen of his eye and he pulled an adom
[1:12:20] down out of the sky and split that atom
[1:12:22] in two and see that destroys human life
[1:12:25] now if the natural man that knows
[1:12:27] nothing of God and cannot know nothing
[1:12:29] of God except he be converted then his
[1:12:32] soul becomes alive with the supernatural
[1:12:35] if he could do that in the natural realm
[1:12:38] amen then what ought the man of God to
[1:12:40] be doing he said my friends the church
[1:12:42] is so far behind he said let's pray my
[1:12:46] that God Amen will move his church up
[1:12:49] see the natural man with the natural
[1:12:52] resource is getting greater results than
[1:12:54] people amen are that calls thems
[1:12:57] Christian he says let's press into the
[1:13:00] Unseen amen let's press into the Unseen
[1:13:04] he said the blessings are yours amen
[1:13:07] they are there for you I think it's a
[1:13:10] powerful thing that a prophet amen has
[1:13:12] come among the church and he has
[1:13:14] identified amen where the blessings are
[1:13:17] he says see the blessings are not in the
[1:13:20] visible realm amen but they are in the
[1:13:22] Unseen he said see the blessings are are
[1:13:25] there now in 1950 uh looking at the
[1:13:27] Unseen he said now we look at the Unseen
[1:13:30] amen and believe that those things which
[1:13:33] are unseen amen but spoke of by God
[1:13:36] become realities amen we look at the
[1:13:39] Unseen and we believe that those things
[1:13:43] amen which are unseen but spoke of by
[1:13:45] God Amen those things become realities
[1:13:49] now I believe the time has come as
[1:13:51] Believers amen I believe the time has
[1:13:54] come to press I don't believe it's time
[1:13:56] Amen to lay down or to back up or to
[1:13:58] give in to the devil I believe if
[1:14:00] there's ever been a time to press amen
[1:14:03] now is the time to press now when I say
[1:14:06] press I don't mean go to the back or to
[1:14:08] the left or to the right amen but I
[1:14:10] believe it's time to press forward see
[1:14:12] brother so we all have to work together
[1:14:14] as one unit we have to get our
[1:14:16] differences away and lay aside our
[1:14:19] doctrines and things and put our arms
[1:14:21] together and press forward amen and take
[1:14:24] the promise that God Almighty has given
[1:14:27] us now amen I don't know about you but I
[1:14:29] believe we have been given promises amen
[1:14:32] and I know the devil don't want you to
[1:14:34] possess those promises amen your flesh
[1:14:36] don't want you to possess those promises
[1:14:39] amen but we are under a Divine
[1:14:41] Commission of almighty God Amen to
[1:14:44] possess those Divine promises brother
[1:14:46] said a man amen that is commissioned of
[1:14:49] God Amen he looks upward and onward amen
[1:14:53] you don't have to care what the world
[1:14:54] say says about it anyhow amen he's not
[1:14:57] listening to the world he's got a Divine
[1:15:00] commission from God and he is enjoying
[1:15:03] that presence amen I believe that we are
[1:15:06] enjoying amen the presence of Jesus
[1:15:09] Christ we are enjoying amen the company
[1:15:12] of the Holy Ghost now amen I believe
[1:15:14] that there is more than just a feeling
[1:15:16] Among Us I believe there's more amen
[1:15:19] than just a sensation or an emotion amen
[1:15:21] but I believe the Holy Ghost of God Has
[1:15:24] Come among the church amen and when he
[1:15:26] comes Among Us he's doing more than just
[1:15:28] exciting us amen he's doing more than
[1:15:31] just making us feel good amen but the
[1:15:33] Holy Ghost is actually making us
[1:15:36] perseverance now you all know what
[1:15:38] perseverance means it means to be
[1:15:40] persistant Amen to make a goal brother
[1:15:43] said a man that's ever amounted to
[1:15:45] anything at any time through any age has
[1:15:48] been men who believed in God and they
[1:15:50] had faith in God and they stood against
[1:15:52] the enemy on every side amen and they
[1:15:55] were perseverant because they believed
[1:15:58] in God he said therefore I believe every
[1:16:01] Christian amen should be very
[1:16:04] perseverant listen I don't think this is
[1:16:06] the hour Amen to become casual with the
[1:16:09] devil I don't believe this is the hour
[1:16:11] to step aside amen and just put on a
[1:16:13] pair of gloves and try to handle the
[1:16:15] devil I believe if there's ever been a
[1:16:17] time for Christians Amen to take a stand
[1:16:20] upon the word of God Amen now is the
[1:16:23] time to stand listen it's time to stand
[1:16:26] against the devil it's time to stand
[1:16:28] against the world listen as long as a
[1:16:30] Christian can know that he's living
[1:16:32] above sin and the Holy Spirit is
[1:16:35] blessing him and is standing with him
[1:16:38] amen then be perseverant amen and press
[1:16:41] towards the mark of the High Calling
[1:16:44] amen Christians should be very
[1:16:46] perseverant Amen in their claims to God
[1:16:49] Amen stay with it amen I don't know
[1:16:52] about you but I didn't come down here
[1:16:54] amen just to for a social Gathering or
[1:16:56] amen just to see who showed up and who
[1:16:58] didn't amen but we come here to do
[1:17:00] business with God Amen and I'll say this
[1:17:03] amen we are not amen of those who pull
[1:17:06] back amen but we are perseverant
[1:17:08] Christians we will not lay down to the
[1:17:11] devil we will not back up to the spirits
[1:17:13] of unbelief we have been anointed by the
[1:17:16] message of the hour Amen to move into
[1:17:18] all that God has for us amen I want to
[1:17:21] say this we're not just pressing amen
[1:17:24] toward something we are pressing towards
[1:17:26] an identified something that is the mark
[1:17:28] of the High Calling brother B said as
[1:17:31] Paul said I could stand quoting again
[1:17:33] amen forgetting those things that are in
[1:17:35] the past amen now I press towards the
[1:17:38] mark amen the High Calling are you'all
[1:17:41] ready for this Amen to the complete
[1:17:44] identification when all time will fade
[1:17:46] out into eternity amen when Jesus comes

[1:17:53] justification we're not just pressing
[1:17:55] towards sanctification we're not even
[1:17:57] just pressing towards the baptism amen
[1:18:00] of the Holy Ghost but a prophet has come
[1:18:02] among the church and he has said
[1:18:04] justification made way for
[1:18:07] sanctification which made way for the
[1:18:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:18:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost has made way
[1:18:14] amen for the word itself to return
[1:18:16] listen this is not a church bride this
[1:18:19] is not a hybrid bride we are a word
[1:18:22] bride who has been birthed from the
[1:18:24] genes of the word of God listen we are
[1:18:26] more than just church members we are
[1:18:28] more than just citizens of a country hey
[1:18:31] but we have come from God and there is a
[1:18:33] jean seed in our soul and that seed is

[1:18:39] full Son of God listen we're not going
[1:18:42] to have a rearview mirror Fair amen a
[1:18:44] rearview mirror only looks back amen and
[1:18:47] sees where you have been he said but we
[1:18:50] are looking forward Amen to see where we

[1:26:27] through faith we understand that the
[1:26:30] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:26:34] that the things which are seen were not
[1:26:37] made of things which do appear brother
[1:26:40] comes along in 1950 he says believest
[1:26:43] Thou this he said now you testify of the
[1:26:46] things you do not see faith is the
[1:26:49] substance of things hoped for it's the
[1:26:52] evidence of things you do not see see
[1:26:54] and we look at the Unseen church that's
[1:26:58] almost what is an oxymoron amen that we
[1:27:01] look at the things we do not see an
[1:27:05] unpardonable sin 54 he said faith is
[1:27:08] something that's born in you it's
[1:27:10] something that God gives you super sign
[1:27:14] 1961 he said faith is Supernatural amen
[1:27:17] and it does Supernatural things
[1:27:20] Blasphemous name 62 he said now coming
[1:27:23] from the holy Spirit what is come then
[1:27:26] he will give to you Supernatural Faith
[1:27:29] amen spiritual faith that here at the
[1:27:32] bottom then that spiritual Faith
[1:27:34] recognizes only the word no matter what
[1:27:37] anybody else says it don't do no good
[1:27:41] amen that only knows the word if
[1:27:44] somebody say the days of Miracles has
[1:27:46] passed that Faith only knows the word
[1:27:49] somebody says there's no such a thing as
[1:27:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that
[1:27:54] Faith only knows the word see that's
[1:27:57] real spiritual faith it only knows the
[1:28:01] word no wonder a prophet would invite
[1:28:04] the holy spirit amen to the platform to
[1:28:07] anoint him to preach the word to bring a
[1:28:09] courage upon a Joshua generation Hey
[1:28:12] listen we don't have just church Faith
[1:28:15] we don't just have human Faith but we
[1:28:17] have been taken back Amen to the stature
[1:28:20] of a perfect man where there was a
[1:28:22] foundation laid and the the foundation
[1:28:24] was not feelings the foundation was not
[1:28:27] sensation but the foundation was the
[1:28:29] faith of Jesus Christ listen and Jude
[1:28:32] come along and said contend for the
[1:28:35] faith of Jesus Christ listen I tell you
[1:28:37] what it take this meeting into an
[1:28:39] atmosphere where all things are possible
[1:28:42] amen is the faith of Jesus Christ in the
[1:28:45] flesh of a redeemed believer who
[1:28:47] believes that God Is Bigger and God is
[1:28:49] greater and God is stronger listen I
[1:28:52] don't know what your mountain is I don't
[1:28:54] I know what your Valley is I don't know
[1:28:55] what the walls of Jericho for you are
[1:28:58] but I know God and I know if he's the
[1:29:00] same yesterday today and forever when
[1:29:03] faith comes into the building it will
[1:29:05] begin to encourage somebody to say devil
[1:29:08] your days are over yes sir I love how
[1:29:11] the prophet moves there in 1963 he says
[1:29:14] now we want to speak upon Faith he says
[1:29:16] and a different type of Faith a perfect
[1:29:19] faith my goodness amen now Faith we told
[1:29:23] in the Bible amen that Faith cometh by
[1:29:25] here listen you cannot be saved without
[1:29:30] faith and faith is something that you
[1:29:33] have to believe that it's there that
[1:29:35] really nothing else will declare it's
[1:29:37] there but Faith see listen if you're
[1:29:41] waiting on your five senses Amen to
[1:29:43] declare the realities of God it'll never
[1:29:46] happen amen if you're waiting on your
[1:29:48] five inner senses to declare the
[1:29:50] realities of God it'll never happen the
[1:29:53] only way we can have a meeting is to
[1:29:55] break out of the five outer senses and
[1:29:58] the five inner senses and move over into
[1:30:01] the Super sense which is Faith and when
[1:30:03] you begin to believe by faith your faith
[1:30:06] will declare things that you don't see
[1:30:09] you don't feel you don't smell you don't
[1:30:11] remember you don't reason oh Church of
[1:30:14] the Living God listen hey I might as
[1:30:16] well preach I come all the way down here
[1:30:18] it's time to break out of the five
[1:30:20] senses and step over into the
[1:30:23] jurisdiction of the faith of Jesus
[1:30:25] Christ listen hey I believe that
[1:30:28] prodical can come home but sometimes
[1:30:30] your sense of sight won't declare it
[1:30:33] amen I believe that while I'm preaching
[1:30:35] cancers can leave bodies but sometimes
[1:30:37] your feelings won't declare it but
[1:30:40] there's one thing that will declare it
[1:30:42] that is the faith of Jesus Christ and
[1:30:44] when that Faith begins to operate and a
[1:30:47] son of God begins to exercise by that
[1:30:49] Faith something begins to happen what is
[1:30:52] Faith amen what is Faith I love what the
[1:30:55] prodag God says 1964 he says it's an
[1:30:58] unseen
[1:30:59] force my goodness brother Ben faith is
[1:31:02] an unseen Force see it's a spirit and
[1:31:06] the Holy Spirit brings
[1:31:10] faith faith is an unseen force your
[1:31:14] feelings are not an unseen force your
[1:31:17] smell is not an unseen Force but faith
[1:31:20] is an unseen Force faith will move
[1:31:23] Things That You Don't See possible to
[1:31:27] move now faith is the evidence I love
[1:31:29] what Paul says it's the evidence of
[1:31:32] Things Not Seen Hebrews 11:7 Paul comes
[1:31:35] along and writes about Noah he says by
[1:31:37] faith Noah being warned of God of things
[1:31:41] not seen as
[1:31:43] yet my goodness he moved with fear and
[1:31:47] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:31:50] house by the which he condemned the
[1:31:52] world and become an air of the
[1:31:54] righteousness which is by faith listen
[1:31:57] abrah rather Noah amen I've been studing
[1:32:00] on Hebrews 11 so I might preach it all
[1:32:01] right now amen Hebrews 11 Noah amen
[1:32:04] moved by faith and prepared an ark when
[1:32:07] he didn't see one raindrop when he
[1:32:10] didn't see one cloud in the sky listen
[1:32:12] but his faith had Rose to a level to
[1:32:15] believe if God said it I may not see it
[1:32:18] yet but it's going to happen oh Church
[1:32:21] of the Living God you know what that
[1:32:24] I'm getting ahead of myself amen Paul
[1:32:26] said Things Not Seen if you look in the
[1:32:28] Amplified Bible that translates to
[1:32:31] events not yet seen or happened so there
[1:32:35] are events that's going to take place
[1:32:37] that the only thing will declare they're
[1:32:39] going to take place is
[1:32:42] Faith there are events brother Andrew
[1:32:45] that are going to take place but the
[1:32:47] only thing that will declare it is Faith
[1:32:50] listen friends I know there's going to
[1:32:52] be a rapture but my flesh don't declare
[1:32:55] it I know there's going to be a body
[1:32:57] change but my sens of feeling it don't
[1:33:00] declare it but because I am a Seed of
[1:33:02] Abraham I have got Abraham's faith I
[1:33:05] have been called Amen to call things
[1:33:08] that are not as though they are and
[1:33:10] things that are as though they are not
[1:33:12] brother said Noah waited and he believed
[1:33:15] and moved with fear and he built an ark
[1:33:17] he said don't criticize why that old
[1:33:19] fellas must have been crazy yet no
[1:33:22] clouds had ever come before there was a
[1:33:24] cloud before there was a drop of water
[1:33:26] in the skies amen Noah with the Unseen
[1:33:30] of the natural eye with this spiritual
[1:33:32] eye he tuned to the word of God my
[1:33:36] goodness Noah got in tune with the word
[1:33:38] of God and he seen the rain
[1:33:42] falling did I read that right he seen
[1:33:46] the rain
[1:33:47] falling before one cloud ever formed in
[1:33:50] the sky before one drop ever began to
[1:33:53] fall listen before the ark was ever
[1:33:55] finished Noah's Faith declared there's a
[1:33:58] rain coming oh he says if we tonight in
[1:34:01] this angelous Temple could so tune our
[1:34:03] hearts amen not our literal mind let it
[1:34:06] go and cast down reason but with our
[1:34:09] heart could tune it to the word of God
[1:34:12] to see a Revival Break Forth to see the
[1:34:14] altars full to see the church packed to
[1:34:17] see the Revival spreading through Los
[1:34:19] Angeles listen a fire that cannot be put
[1:34:22] out our heart would begin to pulsate
[1:34:24] under the power of the Holy Ghost there
[1:34:26] would be such a prayer meeting over Los
[1:34:28] Angeles tonight if it happened listen
[1:34:31] when the church is in tune what if the
[1:34:34] people here tonight that sick would
[1:34:36] begin to think God is God if he isn't
[1:34:38] then why serve him if he's still God
[1:34:41] he's still a Healer if he's almighty God
[1:34:43] he can do all things and if he made a
[1:34:45] promise he can't break it he has to keep
[1:34:48] it then that pulsation begins to rise in
[1:34:51] your heart something's going to take
[1:34:53] place
[1:34:54] there could be nothing stop it
[1:34:57] Hallelujah did y'all hear me listen amen
[1:35:00] there could be nothing stop it so your
[1:35:02] senses can't stop it your feelings can't
[1:35:05] stop it your emotions can't stop it when
[1:35:08] the faith of God drops in the heart of a
[1:35:10] Believer they begin to move with fear
[1:35:12] for the preparing of this rain that's
[1:35:15] coming listen Noah got ready for a
[1:35:17] natural rain that was bringing a
[1:35:19] destruction but I come here tonight to
[1:35:21] say there's a rain and it's a harvest
[1:35:23] rain it's a latter rain it's a rain
[1:35:26] that'll bring a refreshing from the
[1:35:28] presence of God listen I don't see a
[1:35:31] cloud I don't see a rainstorm but I have
[1:35:33] a message and that message says there's
[1:35:36] a rain that'll fall in the last
[1:35:39] days yes sir there could be nothing stop
[1:35:42] it it's a fire like a building on fire
[1:35:44] in a windy day it'll just keep blowing
[1:35:46] as the Holy Spirit fans the fire and it
[1:35:49] keeps burning are y'all ready for this
[1:35:52] it keeps burning turning until it
[1:35:54] becomes a reality to
[1:35:57] you so it don't even have to become a
[1:35:59] reality to your neighbor but if it
[1:36:01] becomes a reality to you it don't matter
[1:36:04] what anybody else
[1:36:08] thinks see what is it it's the word of
[1:36:10] faith now Paul comes along in Romans
[1:36:12] 10:8 he says but what saith it the word
[1:36:15] is n thee it is even in thy mouth and in
[1:36:18] myy heart that is the word of faith
[1:36:21] which we preach look at this word preach
[1:36:23] it means to Proclaim openly or publish
[1:36:26] something which has been done with the
[1:36:28] intent to be done
[1:36:30] again so when a preacher begins to
[1:36:33] preach they begin to say listen he's
[1:36:36] done it
[1:36:37] before he can do it
[1:36:40] again they begin to declare to you that
[1:36:43] there is a pulsation of faith in their
[1:36:45] heart that believes he's not just the
[1:36:47] god of the Old Testament he's not just
[1:36:49] the god of I was or the I will be but
[1:36:52] there's something in the heart of a
[1:36:54] believer that begins to testify he is
[1:36:56] the I am he is the I am and he's right
[1:36:59] here present now brother said I must
[1:37:02] preach the kingdom of God he says I must
[1:37:04] preach the truth regardless of how it
[1:37:06] hurts or what it hurts now let me just
[1:37:09] say this we must preach amen the word of
[1:37:12] faith when Paul writes to Timothy he
[1:37:14] says these three words he says preach
[1:37:17] the word be instant in season out of
[1:37:19] season you reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:37:22] all long suffering and Doctrine comes
[1:37:25] along in present stage of my Ministry he
[1:37:28] says that's the reason I would not
[1:37:30] talate with any of these Creeds and
[1:37:32] denominations is because I have been
[1:37:35] commissioned of God to stay with the
[1:37:37] word he said I love to see God heal his
[1:37:40] children certainly don't get me wrong
[1:37:42] but there's one thing I've been noticing
[1:37:44] I've been trying everywhere I go when I
[1:37:46] get an invitation is to press in to
[1:37:49] preach just a little bit I've let down
[1:37:51] on my preaching and it's too much on
[1:37:54] just the anointing and working on the
[1:37:57] Eternal part of the supernatural rather
[1:37:59] when to see Visions he said they're
[1:38:01] wonderful and I thank God for it listen
[1:38:04] the the Visions are wonderful he said
[1:38:06] and I thank God for it he said but yet
[1:38:09] the preaching of the word is a million
[1:38:12] miles beyond that when I see the lame
[1:38:15] walk and the blind see I love this
[1:38:18] deceived Church by the world he says the
[1:38:20] success of the church it lies within the
[1:38:24] preaching of the Gospel of the power of
[1:38:27] God and the demonstration of the spirit
[1:38:30] so our success does not lie in our
[1:38:32] programs it does not lie in our
[1:38:34] buildings it does not lie in what we can
[1:38:37] come up with in our minds but the
[1:38:39] success of the church is laying within
[1:38:42] the preaching of the Gospel then the
[1:38:46] Bible says that God sent his word amen
[1:38:48] by anointed
[1:38:51] preachers in Romans 10:14
[1:38:54] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:38:55] they've not believed and how shall they
[1:38:57] believe in him of whom they have not
[1:38:59] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:39:03] preacher and how shall they preach
[1:39:05] except they be sent as it is written how
[1:39:08] beautiful are the three to them that
[1:39:10] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:39:12] Glad Tidings of good things but they
[1:39:14] have not all obeyed the gospel for
[1:39:17] Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed I
[1:39:21] report now somebody say well I don't
[1:39:23] have faith thank you for telling me here
[1:39:25] it is so then Faith
[1:39:30] cometh hello Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:39:35] hearing by the word of God somebody say
[1:39:38] I ain't got no faith well listen Faith
[1:39:41] cometh come on I don't know a better way
[1:39:43] to start these meetings off than to tell
[1:39:45] you this Faith cometh church and it
[1:39:48] cometh by the hearing of the word of God
[1:39:51] spoken words Original Seed you can only
[1:39:53] serve God on Earth as God's servants
[1:39:56] that sent on Earth by divine inspiration
[1:39:59] interprets the word to you remember said
[1:40:02] a few years ago when the Holy Ghost
[1:40:03] before it came the church began to get
[1:40:05] formal back in the days of Methodist and
[1:40:07] you people cried to God for deliverance
[1:40:09] and God sent down the baptism of the
[1:40:11] spirit now since then people has been
[1:40:14] liberated from their sins by receiving
[1:40:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now those
[1:40:19] who do not believe in it they cannot
[1:40:21] receive it you've got to to believe in
[1:40:23] it are y'all ready for this therefore he
[1:40:26] sent anointed preachers to preach the
[1:40:29] word and you received it listen Christ
[1:40:33] does not anoint ministers to preach the
[1:40:36] gospel just to have it returned back to
[1:40:38] him void but he expects you to receive
[1:40:41] the word listen when God sends a man
[1:40:44] behind a pullit that's not for a
[1:40:46] preacher's ego that's not an occupation
[1:40:48] or a job that's because the word of God
[1:40:51] has got an intended purpose and it's got
[1:40:53] an intended effect and God will raise up
[1:40:56] somebody who will stand behind the pit
[1:40:59] and they will take off the gloves they
[1:41:01] don't care who it hurts they don't care
[1:41:03] what it hurts they have been called to
[1:41:05] preach the word and by the preaching of
[1:41:08] the word it is encouraging the Believers
[1:41:11] to defeat the Devil who is already
[1:41:15] defeated you know what I say I say we've
[1:41:18] been taught that we get what we expect
[1:41:21] you know what I believe that works for
[1:41:22] God is what
[1:41:24] I believe that God Amen gets what he
[1:41:26] expects you know what I believe I
[1:41:29] believe as he sends the word you receive
[1:41:31] the word and you become the word as you
[1:41:35] hear the word faith cometh to your heart
[1:41:38] and as Faith cometh you hear the word
[1:41:40] receive the word and you become the word
[1:41:43] amen how can I talk about preaching and
[1:41:45] not speak of Jesus last commission and
[1:41:47] the final words that fell from his lips
[1:41:49] in Mark 16 when he said go ye into all
[1:41:52] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:41:55] Creature he that believeth that is
[1:41:57] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:41:58] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:42:00] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:42:03] here it is in my name they shall cast
[1:42:07] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:42:09] tongues they shall take up serpents if
[1:42:11] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:42:13] hurt them listen they shall lay their
[1:42:16] hands on the
[1:42:18] sick and they shall
[1:42:21] recover listen that's not the words of a
[1:42:24] man that's the words of Jesus listen I
[1:42:27] refuse to back up to some devil that
[1:42:30] don't want to see somebody get help in
[1:42:32] the
[1:42:33] house but I might as well preach I'm all
[1:42:35] the way down here amen I know it's got
[1:42:37] to a time where we spend more time
[1:42:39] arguing about what we should have and
[1:42:41] what we should do than just doing it
[1:42:44] y'all know what I'm talking about amen
[1:42:45] God spend 20 years arguing should there
[1:42:47] be a prayer line should there not should
[1:42:49] there be altar calls should there not
[1:42:51] should we lay hands on should we not
[1:42:52] listen I remember when I started
[1:42:54] preaching amen a few years ago I started
[1:42:56] preaching I was 13 I remember the word
[1:42:58] of God breaking open to me in the
[1:43:00] realities of the message and I was just
[1:43:02] looking for a pull pit amen anybody
[1:43:04] invited me I was just looking to stand
[1:43:06] there and say the third pull is in the
[1:43:08] bride and the Seven Seals open and the
[1:43:10] MDC has returned listen I remember when
[1:43:13] they used to argue about the third pull
[1:43:16] being in the bride and the Seven seal
[1:43:18] being open but do you see what we've
[1:43:19] done now we argue about should we shout
[1:43:22] or not should we we dance or not should
[1:43:24] we have prayer lines or not should we
[1:43:26] have altar oh come on sir you know what
[1:43:28] I say I say go ahead and Shout a little
[1:43:30] bit and have a prayer line and make the
[1:43:33] devil uncomfortable and bring the power
[1:43:35] of the word back in the church listen I
[1:43:38] refuse to back up to the devil and let
[1:43:40] some ungodly formal ritualistic devil
[1:43:43] crawl up out of the pits of hell and
[1:43:45] invade our message churches we are not a
[1:43:47] lukewarm hibiz bride we are an
[1:43:50] invincible Army we have received the
[1:43:52] opening of Seven Seals the word has
[1:43:55] returned to the church there is a fire
[1:43:58] and it's a holy fire it's a consuming
[1:44:00] fire and it's a fire that'll burn every
[1:44:02] devil
[1:44:03] out now let me just go ahead and bump
[1:44:06] that devil again why are we arguing
[1:44:08] about helping
[1:44:10] people I don't care if they get helped
[1:44:13] by a prayer line or hands laid on them
[1:44:15] or the word being preached to them or an
[1:44:17] altar call let's just help the people of
[1:44:20] God
[1:44:24] well I don't think there ought to be
[1:44:25] emotion amen well let me just say this
[1:44:28] amen obviously the devil's convinced you
[1:44:31] that we shouldn't be excited about the
[1:44:32] message of the hour but you're looking
[1:44:34] at one preacher who refuses to lay down
[1:44:37] and not come to my complete
[1:44:40] identification somebody say well amen
[1:44:42] that Devil's CW in the churches and craw
[1:44:44] in homes and you know what that come on
[1:44:46] we might as well preach Devil's you know
[1:44:49] where we've come to we've come to now
[1:44:51] where the devil's trying to take away
[1:44:52] the rightous to preach the
[1:44:54] gospel for the first time we finally
[1:44:57] have something to say and the devil says
[1:44:59] set all the preachers down and just put
[1:45:01] a tape player in the pullit and just
[1:45:03] press play well can I tell you what that
[1:45:05] is that is a coward Spirit from the pits
[1:45:08] of hell you say can you prove it I can
[1:45:11] it's a lot easier to put a tape in the
[1:45:13] pull pit and let brother Brandon preach
[1:45:15] against makeup and let brother Brandon
[1:45:17] preach against High heill shoes and let
[1:45:19] brother Brandon preach against the way
[1:45:20] we dress but you know what I say I say
[1:45:23] if I believe his message then God give
[1:45:25] me the courage to stand behind the
[1:45:27] pullit and take the gloves off and say
[1:45:30] what a prophet
[1:45:32] said we ain't a bunch of cowards we're
[1:45:35] end time Believers we're Eagles of God
[1:45:38] we have been anointed for this
[1:45:41] hour Devils come in and start pushing
[1:45:44] and pushing and don't lay hands on the
[1:45:45] sick and amen and they oh god well let
[1:45:48] me just preach but let me say what the
[1:45:50] part of God said he said the preaching
[1:45:52] of the Gospel is the casting out of the
[1:45:56] devil so no wonder the devil don't want
[1:46:00] preaching because when you begin to
[1:46:02] preach it begins to kick him
[1:46:05] out no wonder the devil wants to shut
[1:46:07] all of our preachers down but you know
[1:46:09] what I say preachers I say preach I say
[1:46:12] preach until the Holy Ghost Falls I say
[1:46:15] preach until the devil's back up I say
[1:46:18] preach until Liberty breaks out in the
[1:46:20] house of God and people can believe God
[1:46:24] again it's only a devil but a Prophet
[1:46:27] come along and he said God has given me
[1:46:30] the authority to break the power of
[1:46:33] Satan another place you give us the
[1:46:35] divine power to break the power of Satan
[1:46:39] over this life in the name of Jesus
[1:46:42] Christ see the battle we are in is a
[1:46:45] spiritual battle it's spirits that don't
[1:46:48] want you to move into a complete
[1:46:51] identification of an overcome
[1:46:55] but can I tell you tonight you're not
[1:46:56] the
[1:46:57] overcome you're the Overcomers now
[1:47:01] brother B comes and believe in God he
[1:47:03] says now the only thing that kept me
[1:47:04] from being saved when I was 12 years old
[1:47:06] was because a spirit hung over me and he
[1:47:09] says it was a devil that said wait a
[1:47:12] little while longer he said there's not
[1:47:14] a man that's got his right mind but what
[1:47:16] wants to do right see but there's
[1:47:18] something that won't let you do right is
[1:47:22] that right he said that's the devil but
[1:47:25] he commissioned his church to cast them
[1:47:28] Devils out there you are in my name they
[1:47:31] shall cast out Devils you ain't going to
[1:47:33] heal anybody you're going to cast The
[1:47:36] Devil away from them so they can accept
[1:47:38] the healing I've already done listen to
[1:47:40] brother bram's words preachers they
[1:47:42] stood on the platform and they preached
[1:47:45] the gospel and devil
[1:47:48] scattered then the man come the altar
[1:47:50] under conviction and said I want to get
[1:47:52] saved the preacher never saved the man
[1:47:55] he cast out the devil and the man got
[1:47:58] saved and accepted his salvation you see
[1:48:02] the same thing by Divine Healing you
[1:48:04] sick people here this morning believe
[1:48:06] and have been born again and are Sons
[1:48:07] and Daughters of God Christ has already
[1:48:11] healed you listen Church the only thing
[1:48:14] that keeps you from being well this
[1:48:16] morning is a spirit hanging over you
[1:48:20] that won't let you fully go out yonder
[1:48:22] and believe God's promise that he's done
[1:48:25] it now I'm preaching to you now that's
[1:48:28] what hinders the services it's not your
[1:48:30] husband it's not your wife it's not the
[1:48:33] song leader it's not the Deacon it's a
[1:48:36] spirit that hangs over the church listen
[1:48:39] it's a devil trying to stop you from
[1:48:41] breaking out of the depression and
[1:48:43] breaking out of the nervousness and
[1:48:45] breaking out of the
[1:48:48] confusion it's a spirit and Spirits are
[1:48:51] real he said but here's my commission he
[1:48:53] said that's what God gave me it's what
[1:48:55] he give every gospel preacher who will
[1:48:57] believe him the power and the authority
[1:49:00] to break that
[1:49:02] Spirit Well I might as well say it the
[1:49:04] devil showed up for camp this
[1:49:06] year the devil showed up for camp and
[1:49:09] he's already trying to hang over you
[1:49:12] he's already trying to tell you it ain't
[1:49:14] for you and the preacher's too loud and
[1:49:16] the preachers too emotional and the
[1:49:18] preachers to this and the song leaders
[1:49:20] to that come on you know what I'm
[1:49:21] talking about amen but but it's a spirit
[1:49:23] hanging over you it's a spirit hanging
[1:49:25] over this meeting but I want to dedicate
[1:49:27] this quote to the devil I believe with
[1:49:29] all my heart that every demon power
[1:49:32] that's in here at this minute is already
[1:49:37] broken hu it's already broken you say
[1:49:41] preacher it's going to be broken no it's
[1:49:44] already broken whatever Devil's trying
[1:49:47] to bind you is already broken so faith
[1:49:50] is coming to the word and the word word
[1:49:52] is coming to the bride and she's
[1:49:55] receiving
[1:49:56] Courage the devil's already broken see
[1:49:59] that's the matter the devil has broke
[1:50:01] away from you he has to because Faith
[1:50:05] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:50:07] of God the word of God made
[1:50:11] manifest see Faith doesn't wait Faith
[1:50:14] takes God's word for what it says and
[1:50:17] starts
[1:50:19] rejoicing see that's why we're not a
[1:50:21] Pentecostalism bride
[1:50:24] right we don't wait for the service to
[1:50:27] get righteous out we go ahead and praise
[1:50:30] God we don't wait for the music to get
[1:50:33] good and hot and the drums and the
[1:50:34] guitar listen when the word drops in our
[1:50:37] soul we start rejoicing on the promise
[1:50:40] of the word of God he said you're

[1:51:05] the word well let me say what a prophet
[1:51:07] said he said by the watering of the word
[1:51:10] is the punctuating in the word with an
[1:51:13] amen when you say Amen it is equivalent
[1:51:17] to getting a water hose and Watering
[1:51:19] your flowers when you say Amen it is the
[1:51:22] equivalent to water in your garden oh
[1:51:24] Church of the Living God I say Jesus

[1:53:38] sword amen is not Pentecostalism it's
[1:53:41] the amen of God nowhere in the Bible
[1:53:44] does it say when the priest got done
[1:53:46] reading the word that everybody nodded
[1:53:48] or they smiled or they give him a thumbs
[1:53:50] up or they shook his hand the Bible says
[1:53:53] they all with one Accord they all said
[1:53:56] amen well Church of the Living God I say
[1:53:59] bring back amens in the house of God
[1:54:02] till every promise of God receives a
[1:54:04] seal of God upon it in your
[1:54:07] heart preacher says you're healed just
[1:54:09] go ahead and say Amen preacher says
[1:54:12] you're delivered just go ahead and say
[1:54:13] Amen it don't matter how you feel it
[1:54:16] don't matter what the devil's working
[1:54:17] against your flesh if the word of God is
[1:54:20] in your soul there is an amen in your
[1:54:22] soul and there's a place to go in god
[1:54:25] until that amen brings the unseen
[1:54:27] reality before
[1:54:29] you you say preacher that's work up no
[1:54:32] it's a believ in
[1:54:34] God you say that's a bunch of nonsense
[1:54:37] no amen it's called praising God and let
[1:54:40] me just tell that devil the praise of
[1:54:42] the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:54:46] different our praise is different we
[1:54:49] don't wait for the promise to be
[1:54:50] manifested to praise
[1:54:53] we don't wait for one physical evidence
[1:54:56] to begin to believe it's our promise but
[1:54:58] the very minut the word of God Amen
[1:55:00] drops into our soul we forget those
[1:55:03] things that are behind us and we begin
[1:55:05] to say amen and press Forward Unto every
[1:55:08] Divine promise that God has called us
[1:55:11] to yes sir listen the praise of the
[1:55:14] Bride is on the promise of the coming
[1:55:17] manifestation I love this quote so what
[1:55:19] is the evidence of your healing when you
[1:55:21] believe it no matter what takes place
[1:55:23] you say I don't feel better that don't
[1:55:26] have nothing to do with it you've got
[1:55:28] the purchase power you believe
[1:55:31] it now I know the devil's tried to take
[1:55:34] the dance out of the house of God but I
[1:55:35] asked that Devil by what Authority did
[1:55:38] you take praising God the dance out of
[1:55:40] the
[1:55:41] church my Bible says praise ye the
[1:55:45] Lord in a dance now listen friend
[1:55:48] somebody say well then that's just a
[1:55:50] bunch of emotion well let me just say
[1:55:51] what a said he said don't have nothing
[1:55:54] to do with it you got the purchase power
[1:55:55] so just start dancing a little jig
[1:55:58] saying praise God I'm going to be well
[1:56:01] because I've got the purchasing power of
[1:56:04] that loaf of bread come on it doesn't
[1:56:07] say the healing it already happened it
[1:56:09] said the very minute the reality strikes
[1:56:11] your heart I'm going to be well then go
[1:56:14] ahead and praise God in a little
[1:56:18] jig somebody say well that's a bunch of
[1:56:20] workup well I tell you there was a man
[1:56:22] over Donnie brother Donnie Reagan's
[1:56:23] church one time was sitting on the front
[1:56:25] row eat up with leukemia I just talked
[1:56:27] to him the other day he was sitting on
[1:56:29] the front row eat up with leukemia and
[1:56:31] in the middle of a Sunday morning
[1:56:32] service brother Donnie stood there and
[1:56:34] read that quote Amen in the middle of
[1:56:36] preaching nobody arounded him on their
[1:56:38] feet but that man jumped up on his feet
[1:56:41] he said brother Ander I didn't have no
[1:56:42] fancy footwork he said I just started
[1:56:44] praising God listen the leukemia was
[1:56:47] still in his body but the reality of
[1:56:50] healing had already struck his Soul you
[1:56:53] know what he got up the next day and
[1:56:54] went to the doctor and the doctor come
[1:56:56] in there they said sir we don't know
[1:56:58] what happened to you but you're
[1:57:00] completely free of
[1:57:03] leukemia come on this ain't just a
[1:57:05] sermon it's thus sayith the Lord It's
[1:57:08] the message of the hour either we
[1:57:10] believe it or we don't I refuse to lay
[1:57:13] down my weapon of Praise I refuse to lay
[1:57:16] down my
[1:57:17] sword God gave it to me ain't no devil
[1:57:20] going to take it away listen somebody's
[1:57:22] going to preach
[1:57:23] it somebody's going to preach it and
[1:57:26] somebody's going to believe
[1:57:28] [Applause]
[1:57:30] it somebody's going to preach it and
[1:57:33] somebody's going to believe
[1:57:35] it you say what's happening it's God by
[1:57:38] his Spirit energizing his word not our
[1:57:46] feelings not by might nor by
[1:57:49] power but by my
[1:57:53] Spirit sayith the Lord listen not by
[1:57:56] wisdom not by knowledge not by
[1:57:59] nomination but with my spirit I will
[1:58:02] energize my word listen what the prophet
[1:58:05] of God said he said the disciples had it
[1:58:07] solded into
[1:58:10] them then the Spirit come to energize
[1:58:13] the word see it's the water of the word
[1:58:17] of faith that energizes the word of God
[1:58:20] and makes it work what is is it brother
[1:58:22] Taz it's an unseen energy and it's
[1:58:26] coming into the church and it's causing
[1:58:28] you to believe when everything wants you
[1:58:31] to doubt see Jesus said I am the vine
[1:58:35] and ye are the branches sorry I'm from
[1:58:37] the south
[1:58:39] branches now if he will let me know what
[1:58:41] you his listen to prophet of God if he
[1:58:44] will let me know what you his daughter
[1:58:46] let I his child his son know what his
[1:58:49] daughter wants then I being a man and
[1:58:51] you woman there has to be something
[1:58:54] between us here it has to be God using
[1:58:57] us as branches listen he being the vine
[1:59:01] is energizing your heart to believe and
[1:59:05] mine to
[1:59:08] yield Church of the Living God so we are
[1:59:11] here as vessels both a
[1:59:15] speaker and the hearer he said as we
[1:59:19] yield our Soul and Spirit to as vessels
[1:59:21] as I yield m un to you for a mouthpiece
[1:59:23] I yield my eyes for the vision I yield
[1:59:25] my mind for your words he said they
[1:59:28] yield their hearts and their Spirit to
[1:59:31] receive now listen what we're receiving
[1:59:34] amen is we are receiving the promise of
[1:59:37] the word and it is becoming materialized
[1:59:40] right here even though nothing else will
[1:59:42] declare it now listen it's prop of God
[1:59:44] he said now how many believes that Jesus
[1:59:46] completed the Plan of Salvation and
[1:59:47] healing at Calvary he said okay as far
[1:59:50] as that it's all over isn't it he said
[1:59:53] but the only thing that he can do is to
[1:59:55] shock you or to bring you to an
[1:59:58] understanding that he is still God and
[2:00:00] he keeps his promise so in doing so he
[2:00:04] anoints
[2:00:06] preachers that's These Fine men standing
[2:00:08] around here and many back there he
[2:00:11] anoints them to preach another place
[2:00:14] once more 63 he says oh I think now to
[2:00:17] be conscious of the spirit near us light
[2:00:21] he says break out of the shell of the
[2:00:24] hour that we're living in in the time
[2:00:26] and be conscience of the spirit of God
[2:00:29] that is now Among Us come on friends you
[2:00:32] know what I'm talking about we get in a
[2:00:34] shell and we get used to everything in
[2:00:37] the shell and brother all we forget
[2:00:39] there's something happening outside of
[2:00:41] the shell do youall know there's a
[2:00:44] chicken and a chicken's born in a shell
[2:00:47] remember brother said the only way a
[2:00:48] chicken can get out is he's got a little
[2:00:50] p a little a
[2:00:52] bill on the end of his nose he said a
[2:00:54] little a little he says he peeps his way
[2:00:56] through he says he peps his way through
[2:00:58] now listen that chicken gets so used to
[2:01:01] that shell that he forgets there's life
[2:01:04] outside of the
[2:01:06] shell are you hearing me we get so used
[2:01:09] to our little way of doing
[2:01:11] things and we get so used to our little
[2:01:14] narrow view of the message and we get so
[2:01:16] used the way we think things ought to be
[2:01:18] that we forget outside of our little
[2:01:20] shell there's there's a Brides revival
[2:01:23] going on and it's happening around the
[2:01:25] world it's not just in my church or your
[2:01:28] church it's in the body of Jesus Christ
[2:01:32] universally so what happens is if you go
[2:01:35] over and crack the egg and pull the
[2:01:37] chicken out you'll kill it so brother
[2:01:39] Bram says that as a little as a little
[2:01:41] uh a little chicken in there he'll start
[2:01:43] Ping his way through he'll start just
[2:01:46] going pep pep
[2:01:48] pep now I got to wonder One Day how long
[2:01:52] does it take a chicken to get out of the
[2:01:53] shell and then then you know what I
[2:01:56] found out I found out it takes 21
[2:01:59] days for a chicken to pick his way amen
[2:02:03] out of the shell sounds kind of like the
[2:02:05] Book of Daniel don't it amen that Daniel
[2:02:07] waited 21 days but after 21 days he had
[2:02:10] a
[2:02:12] breakthrough oh Church of the Living God
[2:02:15] I don't know how long you've been
[2:02:17] waiting but there's a breakthrough on
[2:02:19] the church there's a promise of a
[2:02:21] Revival there's a promise of a
[2:02:22] refreshing from the presence of
[2:02:26] God I got to thinking one day brother CH
[2:02:29] amen he starts peping his way out amen
[2:02:31] amen can I change that peping to
[2:02:35] amen you know some days he'll pep one
[2:02:38] time and some Services he'll pep 20
[2:02:44] times some days he'll just feel like
[2:02:47] going amen and some days he'll feel like
[2:02:50] going amen amen amen amen amen amen amen
[2:02:54] and you know what we say
[2:02:56] Pentecostal emotional but do you know
[2:02:59] what the problem of God said he said
[2:03:00] he's got to do that because he's
[2:03:03] building up strength in his body to

[2:03:22] on a Friday night Amen to break out of
[2:03:24] the shell and remember God is God and
[2:03:27] His word is true and his power is here

[2:04:08] on the inside said Say Amen one time and
[2:04:11] on that 21st day when he begins to say

[2:04:25] age of confusion I know it's an age
[2:04:27] where Satan has become the god of this
[2:04:29] evil age but I propose to you tonight

[2:04:43] anointed preachers stand there and they
[2:04:45] preach to you under the pure inspiration
[2:04:47] of his presence I love what Jesus says
[2:04:50] he says yet a little while and the world
[2:04:53] aren't you thankful for a
[2:04:55] prophet who can give you commentary on
[2:04:58] the word of
[2:04:59] God the world he says the unbeliever
[2:05:02] seeth me no more but ye the believer see
[2:05:06] me because I Christ live ye the believer

[2:05:20] shall you do also

[2:05:25] while and the world the visible
[2:05:28] intellectual cultured scientific the
[2:05:31] world will see me no more that's exactly
[2:05:34] a prophecy it can't help but be the
[2:05:36] truth Jesus Christ said it the
[2:05:39] intellectual believer the world won't
[2:05:41] see me no more yet ye shall see me for
[2:05:44] I'll be with you even in
[2:05:48] you to the end of the age and and the
[2:05:51] works I do that I have done shall you do
[2:05:54] also and More Than This shall you do for
[2:05:57] I go to my father he says I Christ in
[2:06:00] his church energizing bringing the same
[2:06:03] things that he did when he was here on
[2:06:06] the earth listen another place Jesus
[2:06:08] Christ is in his church his branches
[2:06:11] energizing them bringing forth the same
[2:06:14] fruit he brought when he was here on the
[2:06:16] Earth are y'all ready for
[2:06:18] this when he comes to the church in the
[2:06:21] last days he will come in the fullness

[2:07:40] in my immaturity when the devil threw
[2:07:42] something at me I would back up and get
[2:07:44] scared and think I was going to fall
[2:07:46] apart and then the devil say I'm going
[2:07:48] to get you I'm going to get you I'm
[2:07:50] going to get you but one day brother
[2:07:52] Andrew something struck my heart if the

[2:08:02] would have done got you but he ain't got

[2:08:18] message in the face of every devil oh
[2:08:21] church not Christ not the body but this

[2:08:45] mirror and got ready and told your wife

[2:09:03] Son of
[2:09:06] God you know why it hadn't happened is
[2:09:09] cuz you're looking at what you see
[2:09:11] you're looking at the failures and the
[2:09:12] mistakes and all those things that devil
[2:09:15] throwing against you but if tonight you
[2:09:17] could break out of the shell of this
[2:09:20] visible intellect
[2:09:21] cultured unbelieving world and Look Away
[2:09:24] to Jesus one time you would see that on
[2:09:27] the inside of you is a predestinated
[2:09:29] seed just like was in Jesus
[2:09:33] Christ I tell you what you see you see
[2:09:36] the flesh you see the mistakes you see
[2:09:38] the failures you see the shortcomings
[2:09:40] but I pray to God tonight you would look
[2:09:43] beyond the Flesh and look in the Unseen
[2:09:46] one
[2:09:49] time you say brother Ander I can't yes
[2:09:51] you can yes you
[2:09:55] can yes you can you can look beyond what
[2:09:59] you see one
[2:10:01] time and one look in that Dimension will
[2:10:04] cause you to forget all the
[2:10:07] failures somebody say I'm not
[2:10:09] undefeatable yes you
[2:10:11] are get up in the morning and look
[2:10:13] around and say we're undefeatable
[2:10:17] Church come on fathers get up in the
[2:10:19] morning and tell them babies you're
[2:10:23] undefeatable is this foreign to you come
[2:10:27] on you got to fight the devil come on
[2:10:29] young people come on it's time to fight
[2:10:31] back the devil's trying to stop you
[2:10:34] because he knows what's laying in front
[2:10:36] of you he knows there's a future home he
[2:10:39] knows there's a body change listen I
[2:10:41] tell you right now the devil knows that
[2:10:42] there's a breakthrough right here in
[2:10:44] these meetings he knows there's a
[2:10:45] healing right here he knows there's a
[2:10:47] miracle right here and that Devil's
[2:10:50] pushing and that devil pressing but I
[2:10:52] say tonight Satan in the name of Jesus I
[2:10:55] adure Thee by the authority of Jesus
[2:10:57] Christ I rebuke you take your hands off
[2:11:00] of this meeting take your hands off of
[2:11:03] this people take your hands off of this
[2:11:05] church Satan now are defeated we dismiss
[2:11:08] you Satan in the name of Jesus
[2:11:14] Christ you say why because we're not
[2:11:17] preaching ideas we're preaching the word
[2:11:18] of
[2:11:19] faith and we're prach preaching the Word
[2:11:22] of Promise I got to tie this together
[2:11:24] see as a minister as a prophet of God
[2:11:28] was preaching listen he was ministering
[2:11:30] in
[2:11:32] entrance you know what the Bible says in
[2:11:35] first or two 2 Peter 11:11 for so an
[2:11:37] interest shall
[2:11:39] be
[2:11:42] ministered shall be
[2:11:45] ministered so an
[2:11:48] opening a door shall be ministered
[2:11:52] listen unto you abundantly into the
[2:11:55] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[2:11:57] Savior Jesus Christ now this is not very
[2:12:00] deep but for a country boy it
[2:12:04] is to enter something you've got to exit
[2:12:10] something so when a door is opened as an
[2:12:13] entrance the same door that's an
[2:12:16] entrance is also an
[2:12:19] exit like you come in this building but
[2:12:22] you left outside behind
[2:12:25] you listen friends so Believers are
[2:12:28] Kingdom people who are exiting the
[2:12:30] influence of the worldly Kingdom and
[2:12:32] they are entering into the influence of
[2:12:35] the Heavenly Kingdom that's why Prophet
[2:12:37] stood there amen by discernment and he
[2:12:39] said this I'm pressing into another's
[2:12:43] fear listen the human parts gone and the
[2:12:46] supernatural comes in and works through
[2:12:50] human flesh can I give you just a few
[2:12:52] quotes in
[2:12:54] closing expectation 51 see you got to
[2:12:58] break into a sphere that people know
[2:13:01] nothing about testimony 1951 may he come
[2:13:04] tonight and anoint thy servant with
[2:13:06] great power that this audience will be
[2:13:09] illuminated with his great August being
[2:13:12] may it sway over the building may it
[2:13:15] sway over the building till the people
[2:13:19] will lose sight of their diseases and
[2:13:22] they will sway on out in those spheres
[2:13:24] there where they can see Jesus and take
[2:13:28] his word another one now come near to me
[2:13:31] father and anoint thy servant and pack
[2:13:36] me pack me from this sense bound
[2:13:44] existence into the
[2:13:49] Spheres thir t my prayer for this
[2:13:52] meeting that's my prayer for every
[2:13:54] service Lord pack us out of this sense
[2:13:57] bound
[2:13:58] existence brother said we get so used to
[2:14:00] what's going on down here and things get
[2:14:02] so dreary he said we forget there's
[2:14:05] something happening in another
[2:14:09] realm pack me from this sense bound
[2:14:11] existence into the Spheres where you
[2:14:14] live can I say this as a Believer begins
[2:14:17] to believe the word of Truth and Faith
[2:14:20] they begin to exit the
[2:14:22] sphere or the realm or the
[2:14:27] kingdom of
[2:14:29] unbelief that's why Prophet stood there
[2:14:32] and preached the word preach the word
[2:14:34] preach the word preach the word and
[2:14:37] Faith was coming to the
[2:14:39] church are you with me Faith was coming
[2:14:42] to the church and then he would turn in
[2:14:45] the discernment oh
[2:14:47] God and he would say now I'm standing
[2:14:50] here here he said but really I'm over
[2:14:55] there he had preached an entrance oh God
[2:14:59] he had stood in the pullit and preached
[2:15:02] away through the lines of unbelief into
[2:15:04] a dimension where all things were
[2:15:06] possible and as you the believer begin
[2:15:09] to believe what he was saying you begin
[2:15:11] to follow
[2:15:13] him oh Hallelujah you begin to follow
[2:15:16] him out of this Dimension into a place
[2:15:19] where all things are

[2:32:20] Lord curves and situations he's thrown
[2:32:22] at him Lord problems that's come up at

[2:33:03] Lord he clung to that promise as a Son
[2:33:05] of God he clung to that promise Lord and
[2:33:09] your Prophet said he looked in the
[2:33:10] Unseen and in that unseen Lord he saw an
[2:33:14] event and that event was Sarah holding a
[2:33:17] baby Lord while her milk veins were
[2:33:20] still dried up Lord while her womb was
[2:33:22] still as good as dead Abraham pressed
[2:33:25] Bey on the scene he took God at his word
[2:33:28] and pressed out into the Unseen he
[2:33:31] pressed out into that Dimension where
[2:33:32] there was no sense bound
[2:33:35] existence but Lord there was faith and
[2:33:37] Liberty to believe your word and Lord he
[2:33:40] kept looking at the promise father I
