[37:39] and the lovely one
[37:42] [Music]
[38:06] uh
[38:27] um
[38:28] it's a song that was really important to
[38:30] me a couple of years ago
[38:33] there's
[38:34] there's a little miracle out there
[38:36] called uh sympathetic resonance it's
[38:38] where
[38:39] if someone plays a note
[38:41] any objects around that are tuned to
[38:44] that note or somewhere in that notes
[38:46] family will resonate too even though
[38:47] nobody touched them
[38:50] i think i need a child to be a witness
[38:52] to this miracle actually
[38:54] no well you want to come
[38:56] come check this out
[39:01] so if i play
[39:02] this note here i need you to bear
[39:04] witness i am not touching this string
[39:06] i'm only touching that string but this
[39:07] string here
[39:09] it's actually moving and i'm not
[39:10] touching
[39:12] [Music]
[39:15] actually that's not a miracle it's
[39:16] pretty cool but it's not a miracle
[39:18] thanks noelle if you're a star
[39:20] um i might have said that too but then i
[39:23] found out what the resonant frequency of
[39:25] my soul was i didn't touch it i just
[39:28] played a note and then my soul started
[39:29] resonating
[39:31] it was particularly cool because i
[39:32] didn't even think i had one at the time
[39:35] but
[39:35] then i found out what note it needs to
[39:38] resonate
[39:39] and this is the song that i was singing
[39:40] at the time the words have resonances as
[39:43] well
[39:44] and i always enjoyed praising the lord
[39:45] in terra maori even when i didn't enjoy
[39:47] it in english
[39:49] so this is called ateyariki

[1:01:41] uh and and verse
[1:01:43] 46.
[1:01:45] here we
[1:01:47] spoke a bit on this on wednesday but i
[1:01:49] just want to go into it a bit more
[1:01:53] so
[1:01:54] mark
[1:01:55] 46 sorry mark 10 and 46 says here and
[1:01:58] they came to jericho
[1:02:00] and as he went out of jericho with his
[1:02:02] disciples and a great number of people
[1:02:04] blind bartimaeus the son of timeous
[1:02:07] sat by the highway side begging and when
[1:02:10] he heard that it was jesus of nazareth
[1:02:12] he began to cry out and say jesus thou
[1:02:15] son of david have mercy on me
[1:02:18] and many charge him that he should hold
[1:02:19] his peace not just one or too many many
[1:02:22] told him to be quiet
[1:02:24] but he cried out the more a great deal
[1:02:27] i like it yeah when the devil tells you
[1:02:28] do one thing just do the opposite
[1:02:30] amen thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:02:33] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[1:02:35] to be called and they
[1:02:37] and they call the blind man saying unto
[1:02:39] him be of good comfort rise he calleth
[1:02:41] thee and he casting away his garment
[1:02:43] rose and came to jesus and jesus
[1:02:45] answered and said unto him what will
[1:02:48] thou that i should do unto thee the
[1:02:50] blind man said unto him lord that i
[1:02:52] might receive my sight and jesus said
[1:02:55] unto him go thy way thy faith has made
[1:02:57] thee whole and immediately he received
[1:02:59] his sight and followed jesus in the way
[1:03:02] amen may the lord bless this word you
[1:03:04] may have your seats this morning
[1:03:07] also
[1:03:08] this coming sunday we're going to use
[1:03:09] the vaccine pass i'm going to start
[1:03:11] using it every second sunday
[1:03:13] the wednesdays will stay rosted but we
[1:03:15] wanted to do this so everyone has more
[1:03:16] of a chance to get to church at the
[1:03:18] moment it's every three or four weeks
[1:03:19] but if we do it that way it'll be every
[1:03:21] second sunday at least and the sundays
[1:03:23] we don't use the past all those who are
[1:03:25] unvaccinated will have priority okay so
[1:03:27] this one habits everyone can get to
[1:03:29] church of the same regularity as
[1:03:31] everyone else so
[1:03:32] um
[1:03:33] yeah so
[1:03:34] we want to um
[1:03:36] i love blind barter mass
[1:03:39] he's not a he's not a man that really is
[1:03:41] defined by his blindness no more
[1:03:44] but we want to talk about
[1:03:46] where where
[1:03:48] you know if he can do it for them he can
[1:03:50] do it for me that's my title if he can
[1:03:52] do it for them he can do it for me
[1:03:55] amen and and this was blind bartimaeus's
[1:03:58] uh way
[1:03:59] you know he realized if god can do it
[1:04:01] for them he can do it for me
[1:04:03] and now this is the believers this is
[1:04:05] the believer's really attitude
[1:04:07] amen you know brother brown would say in
[1:04:10] in the message the supernatural he says
[1:04:12] we wanna he says the hardest thing to do
[1:04:15] is to get to the people in that
[1:04:17] atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the
[1:04:18] atmosphere of believing so we want to
[1:04:20] get into a greater atmosphere of
[1:04:22] believing
[1:04:23] that all things are possible
[1:04:25] amen we live in unprecedented times but
[1:04:28] i believe this is unprecedented at times
[1:04:29] for the bride too
[1:04:31] that god's pouring out his spirit more
[1:04:32] and more amen that signs and wonders the
[1:04:35] god of history as a god of the present
[1:04:38] amen we're where impossible things are
[1:04:40] done because god does them
[1:04:42] right so here so if god can do it for
[1:04:44] them he can do it for me that's my title
[1:04:46] now
[1:04:48] what the lord has done down through the
[1:04:49] ages he's still the same today
[1:04:52] god bless you vicky great to have you
[1:04:54] here megan god bless you
[1:04:56] we'll see you paul next time oh yep
[1:04:59] praise the lord
[1:05:00] say hello from us to them thank you
[1:05:03] thank you
[1:05:05] he's the same today
[1:05:07] he hasn't changed
[1:05:08] in any way
[1:05:10] the believer a big part of what makes a
[1:05:12] believer a believer is that he believes
[1:05:14] or they believe he's the same
[1:05:16] right he's not that you know he hasn't
[1:05:18] changed our lord jesus is not some
[1:05:21] distant god someplace he's not sitting
[1:05:23] up in heaven with us with his arms
[1:05:25] crossed just waiting to see how things
[1:05:26] play out but he's actively involved in
[1:05:29] the lives of men and women and children
[1:05:32] even today he's walking among his church
[1:05:34] today amen he is he is interested in our
[1:05:37] lives today he's not a distant god today
[1:05:40] he never was a distant god but the devil
[1:05:43] wants us to make us think that he's a
[1:05:44] distant god and he doesn't care he does
[1:05:46] care he's a very present in a time of
[1:05:49] trouble amen
[1:05:51] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:05:53] forever
[1:05:54] he hasn't changed so what he did back
[1:05:56] then he'll do for you the same today
[1:05:59] amen but he's the same
[1:06:01] the devil wants us to think he's not the
[1:06:02] same but he is the same he's the same in
[1:06:05] power he's the same in ability he's he
[1:06:08] answers prayer the same amen he does the
[1:06:11] same workings he's the same god
[1:06:13] now this shouldn't be foreign let's just
[1:06:16] let's just get into an atmosphere of
[1:06:17] believing like never before
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:21] he's the same now a believer believes
[1:06:24] he's the same in principle he's got to
[1:06:26] be the same in power he's got to be the
[1:06:28] same in every way except his corporal
[1:06:30] body because we're going to meet that in
[1:06:31] the air aren't we believers believe in a
[1:06:33] literal rapture believers believe we're
[1:06:35] going to literally see him in the air
[1:06:37] where our bodies can be changed we're
[1:06:38] going to
[1:06:39] be with him in the air right we're going
[1:06:40] to meet him in the air that's what
[1:06:41] believers believe
[1:06:43] amen brother brown would say in seed of
[1:06:45] discrepancy he says now for if a gospel
[1:06:48] preacher or someone says the days of
[1:06:49] miracles is past that's a seed of
[1:06:52] discrepancy when a man stands and says
[1:06:54] that he's a minister a pastor of a
[1:06:56] church or somewhere and does not believe
[1:06:58] that jesus christ is the same in every
[1:07:00] detail except the physical body the same
[1:07:02] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:07:04] seed of discrepancy so we believe he's
[1:07:07] the same he hasn't changed one bit
[1:07:11] should i say i'm about to close stay
[1:07:12] with me
[1:07:13] right because we're going to travel some
[1:07:14] way but see if we can just realize we
[1:07:16] get in contact with almighty god we can
[1:07:19] as individuals get in contact with
[1:07:20] almighty god and god can move on our
[1:07:23] behalf and change situations things we
[1:07:25] cannot do he does
[1:07:27] amen so he's the same now that's the
[1:07:30] that's the attitude of the believer you
[1:07:31] know i find even even people they are
[1:07:33] you know they just wander off off the
[1:07:35] street or people who just start to walk
[1:07:37] in the way
[1:07:38] deep down inside they believe the
[1:07:40] bible's true
[1:07:42] that's an attribute of a believer they
[1:07:43] just believe the words true they may
[1:07:45] never heard it before but they just
[1:07:46] believe it's true because there's
[1:07:47] something in them saying he is his word
[1:07:49] and his word is true
[1:07:50] amen and he has not changed now
[1:07:53] we
[1:07:54] many times we think if i just had the
[1:07:56] faith of you know
[1:07:58] of blind bartimaeus if i just had the
[1:08:00] faith of the woman at the well if i just
[1:08:02] had the faith of the serophenician woman
[1:08:04] then i would get you know what they have
[1:08:06] need of i have need of and i'll get it
[1:08:08] you know we have that same faith we have
[1:08:11] that same kind of faith this morning we
[1:08:13] don't have a lesser faith we have the
[1:08:14] same faith i mean we're actually built
[1:08:16] of the same stuff as they were we're not
[1:08:18] built of a lesser quality faith we have
[1:08:21] the same kind of faith you know as a as
[1:08:24] brother brown would say about about the
[1:08:26] widow woman that fed elijah
[1:08:29] he said she was made of the same caliber
[1:08:31] as the prophet
[1:08:33] that's why the lord sent him there that
[1:08:35] she would sustain him during the famine
[1:08:38] he says that she was she must have been
[1:08:40] the same caliber as elijah
[1:08:43] so you take the caliber elijah you know
[1:08:46] elijah wasn't some peashooter
[1:08:48] he wasn't some air rifle he wasn't some
[1:08:51] you know he was he was a 150 million
[1:08:54] caliber kind of a gun he was a real high
[1:08:56] caliber because he could stand there on
[1:08:58] mount carmel after seeing a vision of
[1:09:00] being fulfilled and he challenges the
[1:09:02] prophets of baal and says the god who
[1:09:04] answers by fire led a monster by fire
[1:09:06] and you know the rest of the story and
[1:09:08] he stood there one man against a whole a
[1:09:10] whole religious movement and he stood
[1:09:12] there for jehovah god amen and god came
[1:09:15] down and answered his prayer and you
[1:09:17] know burned up the sacrifice and
[1:09:18] everything
[1:09:20] she was of that same caliber
[1:09:22] no record of her doing a miracle no
[1:09:25] record of her seeing a vision having a
[1:09:27] dream but she was made of the same
[1:09:28] caliber i mean so so remember remember a
[1:09:31] prophet represents the word
[1:09:33] they are the word of god to the to the
[1:09:35] people so so she was of the caliber she
[1:09:38] could sustain and look after the word
[1:09:40] during a time of drought
[1:09:42] amen and so that same word has come to
[1:09:44] you
[1:09:45] hallelujah for you to entertain for you
[1:09:47] to give life to you to rejoice and few
[1:09:50] to praise you to make feel welcome his
[1:09:51] name is jesus
[1:09:53] amen so she was the same caliber as the
[1:09:55] prophet and i'll say the bride of jesus
[1:09:57] christ is the same caliber amen as our
[1:10:00] lord jesus christ remember because in
[1:10:03] god's economy the bride is not a
[1:10:05] second-class citizen in the kingdom
[1:10:06] where his where is queen
[1:10:08] we're the apple of his eye he loves us
[1:10:11] very much he's not angry at us he loves
[1:10:13] us he cares for us he wants the best for
[1:10:15] us
[1:10:16] is that foreign some people look at me
[1:10:18] like
[1:10:20] am i talk am i talking another language
[1:10:23] you know if you don't know he loves you
[1:10:25] you should pray lord reveal your love to
[1:10:27] me
[1:10:29] it's very very important
[1:10:30] it means she is of the same caliber and
[1:10:33] so we
[1:10:34] are the believer is the same caliber as
[1:10:37] the word
[1:10:39] so i'll say this if we are of the same
[1:10:41] caliber because we're believers now
[1:10:42] god's made us believers nothing we've
[1:10:44] done he made us believe us amen so
[1:10:46] therefore we have the same faith
[1:10:49] the believers had through the ages
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:53] but you see the thing is many times we
[1:10:55] think we're the only one going through
[1:10:56] the trial we're in
[1:10:58] and it's unique it's never happened
[1:11:00] before in the history of man no one's
[1:11:02] ever gone through this this is new
[1:11:04] territory for a believer no one's ever
[1:11:06] experienced this kind of thing you know
[1:11:08] and unfortunately that's how that's you
[1:11:10] know no one can understand what i've
[1:11:12] gone through i can't draw from anyone
[1:11:13] else's testimony i can't talk to anyone
[1:11:15] about it no one understands this is how
[1:11:17] elijah got after mount carmel
[1:11:20] he would complain to god
[1:11:22] he would actually pray that god would
[1:11:24] take his life he was praying against the
[1:11:26] will of god for his life because the
[1:11:28] will of god for his life as he'd go to
[1:11:30] rapture
[1:11:31] how many times we get real upset and
[1:11:33] down and we pray against the will of god
[1:11:35] but god doesn't change his will for us
[1:11:37] and then he would actually complain to
[1:11:39] god god i'm the only one
[1:11:41] i alone have stood
[1:11:43] no one else has
[1:11:44] it's all me in this trial no one
[1:11:46] understands what i'm going through my
[1:11:48] brother doesn't understand my sister
[1:11:49] doesn't understand i'm the only one
[1:11:52] this is human condition
[1:11:54] but we are not the only one
[1:11:56] as god would tell them no i actually
[1:11:58] have seven thousand
[1:12:00] reserved
[1:12:02] kept
[1:12:02] you know you're actually you actually
[1:12:04] have a church of seven thousand you
[1:12:06] thought you're the church of one but
[1:12:08] there's a lot of others you just weren't
[1:12:09] aware of them
[1:12:11] amen ever so so we need to understand
[1:12:13] that there is no temptation which had
[1:12:15] which has taken you but such as is
[1:12:18] common to man
[1:12:20] right so every temptation we go through
[1:12:22] it's actually it's not unique
[1:12:25] okay it's actually common to man
[1:12:27] someone's been through it before or
[1:12:29] someone is going through it at the same
[1:12:30] time
[1:12:31] amen but god is faithful this is from
[1:12:33] first corinthians 10 13 if you're if
[1:12:35] you're wondering but god is faithful
[1:12:37] who'll not suffer you to be tempted
[1:12:39] above that you're able but will with the
[1:12:41] temptation also make a way to escape
[1:12:43] that ye may be able to bear it so in
[1:12:46] every temptation we should look for a
[1:12:48] way of escape here's the way of escape
[1:12:50] we should look for that way of escape we
[1:12:52] shouldn't just sit there and say poor me
[1:12:53] and all this you know but look for the
[1:12:55] way of escape he's the way of escape
[1:12:58] hallelujah but there's no temptation
[1:12:59] taking you but such is common to man so
[1:13:02] we
[1:13:03] if someone's gone through it before
[1:13:07] you know someone's already gone through
[1:13:09] it so if god did it for them he'll do it
[1:13:10] for you
[1:13:12] we're gonna keep that on our minds if
[1:13:13] god did it for them he can do it for me
[1:13:16] amen that we are not unique
[1:13:18] or the believers of you know in the past
[1:13:20] were not unique in the sense it was only
[1:13:22] for them and god doesn't answer the same
[1:13:24] way if we have the same faith and the
[1:13:27] right mental mental attitude towards any
[1:13:29] promise of god god will cause it to come
[1:13:31] to pass what is that right mental
[1:13:33] attitude god's word is right the promise
[1:13:35] is for me
[1:13:36] irrespective of what we say i mean
[1:13:38] what we see what we feel what we hear
[1:13:41] god's word is always right
[1:13:43] i mean sublime bartimaeus was sitting
[1:13:45] there by the by the gate he was blind he
[1:13:48] was a beggar this is the condition he
[1:13:49] was in and it's amazing even even the
[1:13:52] meaning of his name
[1:13:54] if i um i have it here it's actually uh
[1:13:57] from the chaldea origin um
[1:14:00] it actually means to be uh unclean
[1:14:05] religiously
[1:14:07] this is his name
[1:14:09] son of timmy so bartimaeus is son of
[1:14:11] timmy which is all the unclean he is the
[1:14:13] son of the unclean
[1:14:15] this is this was his name
[1:14:17] so he was living under the stigma i'm
[1:14:20] actually i i've been i'm the son of the
[1:14:23] unclean
[1:14:25] this is
[1:14:26] this is what he was living under and it
[1:14:28] means to be foul in a religious sense
[1:14:30] infamous defiled or polluted
[1:14:32] so this was his name
[1:14:34] but deep down on the inside here is a
[1:14:36] believer
[1:14:37] see we've got to look beyond our natural
[1:14:40] name even our natural cultural net our
[1:14:43] past we're gonna look beyond that here
[1:14:45] he was as a blind man i love it wig
[1:14:47] where the lord jesus he goes to cases
[1:14:49] where people no doubt every one of them
[1:14:51] thought this is my lord in life and i'm
[1:14:53] just stuck this way the woman at the
[1:14:55] well no doubt thought this is just how
[1:14:57] it's going to be i'm always going to go
[1:14:58] to the well because i can't go with
[1:15:00] every other woman because i've been
[1:15:01] ostracized from my village so i always
[1:15:04] have to go this kind of time of day and
[1:15:06] well you know i've been married six five
[1:15:08] times i'm just living with this man i've
[1:15:10] got this you know people don't you know
[1:15:11] i've got this reputation i've been
[1:15:13] shunned by society this is just how life
[1:15:15] is gonna be
[1:15:16] but jesus came her way hallelujah jesus
[1:15:19] changed everything because deep down on
[1:15:22] the inside of her and her soul wasn't
[1:15:24] meant to be the woman at the well as
[1:15:26] everyone knew but she was meant to be a
[1:15:27] believer
[1:15:29] amen and that's why jesus went her way
[1:15:31] raheb as a harlan jericho because
[1:15:34] remember um blind bartimaeus lived in
[1:15:36] jericho jericho's you look at the
[1:15:37] history of jericho there was a there was
[1:15:40] a great history of of of faith in that
[1:15:42] city
[1:15:43] hallelujah amen there was rahab she was
[1:15:47] she was a harlot this is just you know
[1:15:48] brother brown says in one place just to
[1:15:50] dramatize it says actually her her her
[1:15:52] family put her out on the street you
[1:15:54] know they caused that to happen to her
[1:15:57] and they're so there she was she was
[1:15:58] stuck in this kind of a life and
[1:16:00] no doubt she would thought well i'm
[1:16:01] never going to get married this is just
[1:16:03] how it's going to be i'm known as a
[1:16:04] harlot here i am but deep down on the
[1:16:07] inside of her she knew there was mercy
[1:16:09] in a god somewhere
[1:16:11] and when she heard of the testimonies of
[1:16:13] of the red sea and mount sinai and the
[1:16:15] plagues in egypt remember all she heard
[1:16:17] was judgment
[1:16:19] to gentiles and she's a gentile all she
[1:16:22] heard was judgment to her kind of a
[1:16:23] people salvation to the jews but but
[1:16:25] judgment to gentiles she's a gentile but
[1:16:28] somehow she knew there must be mercy in
[1:16:30] that god
[1:16:31] for me somehow all the other gentiles
[1:16:33] you know have been have been judged but
[1:16:35] there's got to be mercy for him i mean
[1:16:37] and him for me hallelujah and she asked
[1:16:40] the spies you know surely there's got to
[1:16:42] give me a token that that we won't die
[1:16:44] because you're going to take the city we
[1:16:45] know you're going to take the city you
[1:16:47] know so there's a kind of a faith in her
[1:16:49] hallelujah
[1:16:51] and and and she was instructed just get
[1:16:53] everyone into into your house under the
[1:16:55] scarlet rope and we think sometimes if
[1:16:58] we just had her kind of faith
[1:17:01] we do have that kind of a faith because
[1:17:03] that's a shadow speaking of a reality in
[1:17:05] this day of you
[1:17:06] amen where i what i love about her is
[1:17:09] her her whole her past and the complexes
[1:17:12] and the pain and the hurt the rejection
[1:17:14] and being used and abused and everything
[1:17:16] that was actually in her that became
[1:17:18] very secondary to her to now she
[1:17:21] actually had this scarlet rope
[1:17:24] and it was actually always in her
[1:17:25] possession it was her rope the spies
[1:17:28] didn't give it it was already it was
[1:17:29] already
[1:17:30] tucked down in her house somewhere amen
[1:17:32] it just had to come on display
[1:17:34] i mean a word had to be spoken to her
[1:17:37] for it to come to life as the same thing
[1:17:39] with the predestinated seed of god it's
[1:17:42] always buried there but when the light
[1:17:43] strikes the seed and it comes to life
[1:17:46] how's it what do you mean it comes to
[1:17:48] life you begin to think different you
[1:17:49] begin to walk different you begin to
[1:17:51] speak different
[1:17:52] church is not a ball the word is not a
[1:17:54] bore it's a reality it's alive the word
[1:17:57] speaks to you it didn't used to speak to
[1:17:59] you before but now it does and it means
[1:18:00] something to you and your whole life has
[1:18:02] changed what's happening that life has
[1:18:03] come on
[1:18:05] that scarlet rope that was buried is now
[1:18:07] on display
[1:18:08] and so now what she now possessed in her
[1:18:10] hand became her whole life
[1:18:13] that was her life's mission now i've got
[1:18:16] to get everyone in
[1:18:18] all my family
[1:18:19] all my
[1:18:20] relations whosoever will and i've
[1:18:22] somehow got to keep it quiet
[1:18:26] can't just put posters everywhere and
[1:18:27] say god sent a prophet and this is
[1:18:30] what's going to happen no
[1:18:33] you know she had to be wise
[1:18:35] and what she did
[1:18:37] i'm not against that kind of thing but
[1:18:38] you know what i mean she had to have
[1:18:39] wisdom but all of her complexes and
[1:18:42] pains and hurts she was still carrying
[1:18:44] them and i'm so and i'm not saying this
[1:18:46] to say you've got to live with those
[1:18:47] things god can deliver you sure but but
[1:18:50] what she had in her hand of the scarlet
[1:18:51] rope became her main thing all those
[1:18:54] things were put to one side i've got
[1:18:56] salvation
[1:18:57] for my family
[1:18:59] amen and we do we don't have a physical
[1:19:02] scarlet rope but we have the baptism of
[1:19:04] the holy ghost that's our short token
[1:19:06] amen and we can live if we you know god
[1:19:09] can live in our lives in such a way it
[1:19:10] creates an atmosphere around us of power
[1:19:13] of the holy ghost that our our family
[1:19:15] will actually become believers they'll
[1:19:17] fall right into it brother braham says
[1:19:20] amen i believe that i mean that was the
[1:19:22] kind of faith that was that was that was
[1:19:25] identified with with jericho
[1:19:29] and there's blind bartimaeus there and
[1:19:31] and when when he was young his his his
[1:19:34] mama brother bam says just to dramatize
[1:19:36] it would would pick him up on her lap
[1:19:38] and tell her bible stories
[1:19:41] of great of great heroes of faith
[1:19:44] and she would tell him about about rahab
[1:19:48] and she would tell him about about
[1:19:50] elijah
[1:19:52] and about elisha
[1:19:54] about how elijah and elisha they you
[1:19:56] know you know they walked through
[1:19:57] jericho elijah took his mantle smote the
[1:20:00] river jordan at potter they walked along
[1:20:02] the other side elijah was taken up in a
[1:20:04] rapture
[1:20:05] amen and then elisha took the same
[1:20:07] mantle smoke the same water it parted
[1:20:09] walked back across you know and maybe he
[1:20:11] had thought if only elijah or elisha
[1:20:13] were here right now
[1:20:14] then they would heal me they'd do
[1:20:16] something i miss like elisha how he
[1:20:18] received a double portion of the
[1:20:20] anointing that was on elijah and how
[1:20:22] elisha would would would would actually
[1:20:25] tell a shunammite woman because because
[1:20:27] he she looked after him and made the
[1:20:30] little side room in her house and
[1:20:31] different things from when he was
[1:20:32] traveling through that that that he
[1:20:35] would tell her you're gonna have a son
[1:20:37] and she had the son
[1:20:39] so life came through the words of a
[1:20:40] prophet
[1:20:41] and then and then when that boy actually
[1:20:44] died
[1:20:45] that same prophet brought him back to
[1:20:47] life and maybe maybe um bartimaeus would
[1:20:50] have said if only i lived back there
[1:20:52] where elisha was because i'm not dead
[1:20:54] i'm alive so it's this is not as hard as
[1:20:56] resurrection of the dead and he could
[1:20:58] lay his hands on me he could do
[1:21:00] something and then my sight would come
[1:21:01] back or maybe he'd think of the story
[1:21:04] where you know maybe maybe it was right
[1:21:06] by jericho where where neyman the
[1:21:08] general from syria came and dipped seven
[1:21:10] times was healed of his leprosy
[1:21:12] and maybe he'd think if only elisha was
[1:21:14] alive i could go to him and he could
[1:21:16] tell me what to do
[1:21:17] now what i love about it well what do i
[1:21:19] need to do just believe and come to the
[1:21:21] lord
[1:21:22] we don't need to dip seven times in some
[1:21:24] water we need to believe and come to him
[1:21:27] hallelujah
[1:21:29] amen so he would have thought no doubt
[1:21:31] if only i lived back then
[1:21:33] i could have gone and talked
[1:21:35] and many both people think if only i
[1:21:37] live when brother branham was here i
[1:21:39] could have got an interview i could have
[1:21:41] got this he would have prayed for me
[1:21:43] called me out in the service or would
[1:21:45] have been fine the same god
[1:21:48] the same jesus not a different jesus not
[1:21:50] a lesser jesus the same god is alive
[1:21:53] today because he's the same yesterday
[1:21:55] today and forever he hasn't changed in
[1:21:58] any bit just not his corporal body i
[1:22:00] mean so he's the same god he's the same
[1:22:02] power to heal the same power to deliver
[1:22:04] the same power to save amen the same
[1:22:07] power to give peace
[1:22:09] he's the same god
[1:22:10] amen the same god today
[1:22:13] so
[1:22:14] while you know
[1:22:15] while uh bartimaeus was pondering on
[1:22:18] these things
[1:22:21] a bunch of noise began to walk past
[1:22:24] and it was jesus coming
[1:22:26] jesus was walking that way
[1:22:28] he was actually on his way to calvary
[1:22:30] where jesus is there's always a lot of
[1:22:32] noise now i may be repeating myself but
[1:22:34] from wednesday but i want to emphasize
[1:22:35] this because the devil wants us to shut
[1:22:37] up sit down and just go through the
[1:22:39] motion but i'm not here to be dictated
[1:22:42] to by the devil i'm here to be dictated
[1:22:44] to by almighty god and and the lord says
[1:22:47] you have joined speaker will full of
[1:22:48] glory peace it passes understanding amen
[1:22:51] we can be drunk on the holy ghost every
[1:22:52] day of our life until we leave this
[1:22:54] world
[1:22:55] hallelujah we can be so drunk on the
[1:22:57] spirit we even forget our own name
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:01] hallelujah you've got trouble in your
[1:23:03] life just take a
[1:23:04] drink take a drink of the spirit
[1:23:07] you'll forget all your troubles
[1:23:09] everything will come into perspective
[1:23:11] the lord is my strength the lord is my
[1:23:13] helper he's my fortress my strong tower
[1:23:16] he's my peace he's my comforter he's
[1:23:18] gonna see me through i may be trouble
[1:23:20] maybe on every side but trouble's not in
[1:23:22] me
[1:23:23] amen because the lord's in me
[1:23:25] hallelujah so you know we can we can
[1:23:28] live such a way i believe it you know
[1:23:32] but the devil doesn't want us to tap
[1:23:34] into our resource
[1:23:35] he doesn't want us to get to our source
[1:23:37] of strength
[1:23:38] amen which is almighty god you just
[1:23:40] start listening to this word
[1:23:42] you'll find a strength come up
[1:23:44] you'll find clarity come
[1:23:46] amen and his anointing the lord's
[1:23:48] anointed will come and quicken it to
[1:23:50] your life you'll find amen things very
[1:23:52] different
[1:23:53] hallelujah so there he was jesus was
[1:23:56] walking past
[1:23:57] and him being blind this was a different
[1:24:00] kind of a noise he was he was used to
[1:24:02] other noises coming past maybe he he
[1:24:04] would hear a donkey come past in the
[1:24:06] past and he would cry out you know for a
[1:24:08] penny or a shekel whatever and but but
[1:24:10] the but the voice of the man on the
[1:24:12] donkey will say out of my way i'm here
[1:24:15] i'm a i'm a priest i'm on yeah i'm on
[1:24:17] official business i don't have time for
[1:24:19] you and it's oh sorry servant of god you
[1:24:21] know forgive me you get out of the way
[1:24:23] here another noise coming past he'd cry
[1:24:26] out and you know a shekel or whatever
[1:24:28] and you know but this noise was
[1:24:30] different
[1:24:31] because here was a man walking along
[1:24:33] some of the crowd was crying out hosanna
[1:24:35] to the son of david some of them were
[1:24:38] saying get out of here beelzebub you
[1:24:40] won't have any prayer meeting you won't
[1:24:41] have any you don't have any kind of me
[1:24:43] you're not welcome down here
[1:24:45] and some would just be standing there
[1:24:46] watching what was going on a lot of
[1:24:48] hustle and bustle going on and then so
[1:24:51] he would he would begin to ask what is
[1:24:53] this commotion
[1:24:55] what is going on in this place this is
[1:24:57] unusual this is different
[1:24:59] and then someone would say well well
[1:25:01] blind bartimaeus you know bartimaeus
[1:25:03] this is this is uh jesus of nazareth
[1:25:07] coming through
[1:25:08] and then so who's that i haven't heard
[1:25:11] about this guy i've heard about pharisee
[1:25:13] jones and you know said you see sad man
[1:25:15] and you know they don't believe in a
[1:25:17] resurrection that's why they said you
[1:25:18] see and you know so
[1:25:22] so so he heard about them but this jesus
[1:25:24] of nazareth and then so someone will
[1:25:27] begin to testify because faith cometh by
[1:25:29] hearing see they say well this this
[1:25:31] jesus of nazareth is a different kind of
[1:25:33] a man
[1:25:34] for starters
[1:25:35] there were blind men
[1:25:37] that he gave sight back to he would he
[1:25:40] would take the bread and the loaves and
[1:25:42] he would feed he would take he'd take a
[1:25:44] boy's lunch
[1:25:45] see if you just give something to god
[1:25:46] god will multiply it more than you can
[1:25:48] imagine he's a boy walking along with
[1:25:50] his lunch he's meant to be on his way to
[1:25:52] school but he sees a crowd he goes to
[1:25:54] see what's going on he doesn't want to
[1:25:55] go to school somehow he finds himself
[1:25:57] and maybe in maybe in front of the
[1:25:59] apostle peter and and and the apostle
[1:26:02] peter says the lord needs your lunch so
[1:26:05] he gives him his lunch
[1:26:06] and then he sits down
[1:26:08] and he watches that same lord jesus take
[1:26:10] and he begins to pray he takes that same
[1:26:12] bread he begins to multiply that bread
[1:26:15] takes that same fish the boy was
[1:26:16] carrying it before now he sees it
[1:26:18] multiplied in before his very eyes and
[1:26:20] then he's eating this multiplied bread
[1:26:22] and fish tastes the same like mama made
[1:26:24] because the same fish and bread
[1:26:25] multiplied and then and then and then
[1:26:28] it'd say
[1:26:29] you know and then and then you know that
[1:26:31] person would testify you know there was
[1:26:33] lazarus jesus's friend he got sick maybe
[1:26:36] badminton say well did he get did jesus
[1:26:38] come and heal him he said no he went
[1:26:40] four days journey
[1:26:42] lazarus died
[1:26:43] four days in the grave
[1:26:45] and maybe bartimaeus began to think well
[1:26:48] i guess there's some cases that are just
[1:26:49] too hard
[1:26:51] but then no no no no no no no no there's
[1:26:53] no cases too hard the devil says these
[1:26:55] cases too hard but god says nothing's
[1:26:58] impossible with me you've got to think
[1:27:00] god made all matter
[1:27:03] all time and space the molecules that
[1:27:05] make up your body he made
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:08] this
[1:27:09] the you know the mass that makes this
[1:27:11] everything we breath the oxygen we
[1:27:13] breathe everything we are god made it
[1:27:15] it's his spoken word
[1:27:17] amen now the devil gets into it tries to
[1:27:19] bring chaos
[1:27:20] right into our body what is sickness
[1:27:22] it's actually disease actually causes
[1:27:24] cells it's a chaos in the body things
[1:27:26] are out of harmony
[1:27:28] right right and it's the same thing when
[1:27:30] he tries to get into your spirit all
[1:27:32] troubled all stressed you know anxiety
[1:27:34] should not be a thing we live with
[1:27:37] don't be anxious for nothing the bible
[1:27:38] says don't be stressed this is an age of
[1:27:40] stress we don't need to be stressed
[1:27:43] amen because we're in a different kind
[1:27:45] of economy
[1:27:46] don't get under the atmosphere of this
[1:27:48] world everyone else can be stressed but
[1:27:51] you know i remember so not the job i
[1:27:53] mean but the one
[1:27:54] before the show quality somehow i found
[1:27:56] myself in the data processing team i
[1:27:58] just processed data all day and friday
[1:28:00] was the stressful day
[1:28:02] because
[1:28:03] what we had to do is process all the
[1:28:05] data and then give it to scientists or
[1:28:08] senior scientists and they had to check
[1:28:10] it and they released it to the to the
[1:28:11] customer
[1:28:12] now we were a a seven day a week company
[1:28:16] but scientists and senior scientists
[1:28:18] they don't work weekends
[1:28:19] oh no
[1:28:21] no no so we had to have everything to
[1:28:23] them but the customer probably wanted
[1:28:24] their results on saturday not that they
[1:28:26] ever checked them but they had to be
[1:28:27] there on time or
[1:28:29] or sunday so we had to get everything so
[1:28:31] friday basically we had to get three
[1:28:33] days work
[1:28:34] worth of work ready on the friday
[1:28:37] and so everyone's panicking in the team
[1:28:39] being so stressed and i realized why
[1:28:41] should i be stressed about this
[1:28:44] why should i get under this atmosphere
[1:28:45] if it's friday no it's friday i'm happy
[1:28:49] praise the lord you know and and and we
[1:28:52] all worked as hard as we could
[1:28:54] right but if there's something wrong
[1:28:56] with the system something needs changing
[1:28:58] but why get stressed because all my
[1:29:00] colleagues are stressed about it it's
[1:29:01] like let's just work as hard as we can
[1:29:05] but you know i could have allowed myself
[1:29:08] to get under that
[1:29:10] no we don't have to get under the
[1:29:12] atmosphere of this world whatever
[1:29:14] climate you know whatever fear is being
[1:29:16] projected
[1:29:17] i'm not going to receive that mail
[1:29:20] i have no actually my old house we
[1:29:22] should put on the new one we should put
[1:29:24] no jug mail
[1:29:25] you know and we don't get any junk mail
[1:29:27] it's like the devil everything he sends
[1:29:29] you is junk
[1:29:30] just put no junk mail
[1:29:32] and say i'm not receiving this he may
[1:29:34] even try and make it personally to you
[1:29:36] know it's junk throw it away
[1:29:38] that's what fear and anxiety is it's
[1:29:40] just junk mail
[1:29:42] amen we don't need to we don't need to
[1:29:43] accept or even open that kind of a
[1:29:45] package
[1:29:47] um praise the lord now
[1:29:49] so they are their bar mitzvah
[1:29:52] and and he was testified to
[1:29:55] now what a believer can do is they have
[1:29:57] the ability
[1:29:58] to put what god has done in the past and
[1:30:01] what god is doing in the present and
[1:30:03] actually say it's the same god
[1:30:05] that's what the believer can do
[1:30:07] amen now
[1:30:09] it wasn't just
[1:30:11] say bartimaeus or the other ones who
[1:30:13] believe that that jesus was a prophet
[1:30:17] you know there was a man called herod
[1:30:20] and
[1:30:21] let's just let's just um
[1:30:23] do i have this here yeah let's go to
[1:30:25] luke 9 and 7.
[1:30:28] because there were other there were a
[1:30:29] lot of other people who wanted to see
[1:30:31] jesus too
[1:30:32] but their attitude was wrong
[1:30:38] and they even said that he was a prophet
[1:30:42] luke 9 and 27
[1:30:44] i mean sorry luke 9 and 7.
[1:30:46] now here at the tetrax heard of all that
[1:30:49] was done by him and he was perplexed
[1:30:52] because it was said of some that john
[1:30:54] was risen from the dead
[1:30:56] and so and of some that elias had
[1:30:59] appeared and of others that one of the
[1:31:01] old prophets was risen again
[1:31:03] and herod said john have i beheaded but
[1:31:05] who is this of whom i hear such things
[1:31:09] and he desired to see him
[1:31:12] because all this is a prophet of old has
[1:31:13] been risen from the dead oh i want to
[1:31:16] see him but then if we go all the way
[1:31:17] now to luke 23 and verse 8 this is where
[1:31:20] herod gets his opportunity
[1:31:23] and when herod saw jesus
[1:31:25] he was exceeding exceeding glad he was
[1:31:28] real happy
[1:31:29] it wasn't just a nice he was real happy
[1:31:31] i've been waiting to see you and i keep
[1:31:33] hearing more testimony and testimony and
[1:31:35] i want to see you
[1:31:37] for he was desired to see him for a long
[1:31:39] season because he had heard many things
[1:31:42] of him and he hoped to see some miracle
[1:31:45] done by him so he just wanted to see
[1:31:47] some supernatural thing
[1:31:49] show us your power
[1:31:51] this is that this was his motive i just
[1:31:53] want to see god i want to see you do
[1:31:54] something jesus of nazareth i've heard a
[1:31:56] lot of stories but i just want to oh i
[1:31:58] just want to see you do something now
[1:32:00] his attitude was he just wanted to see
[1:32:02] god do something just like a trick but
[1:32:04] god doesn't clown for anyone
[1:32:06] well he isn't clown for anyone so
[1:32:08] herod's attitude was wrong
[1:32:11] and that's why when he if we keep
[1:32:13] reading then he questioned with him in
[1:32:14] many words but answered him nothing and
[1:32:16] the chief priest and scribe stood and
[1:32:18] verily
[1:32:20] however you say that word accused him
[1:32:23] and herod with his men of war set him at
[1:32:26] naught and mocked him and arrayed him in
[1:32:28] a gorgeous robe and sent him again to
[1:32:31] pilate now that word to set him at
[1:32:33] naught means to make utterly nothing of
[1:32:36] to despise
[1:32:37] so they heard great things about him but
[1:32:40] because he didn't clown he didn't he
[1:32:42] didn't respond how they wanted him to
[1:32:44] respond
[1:32:45] they just said no this guy's nothing and
[1:32:47] they mocked him he was the great king of
[1:32:49] glory that if herod's approach was just
[1:32:52] right
[1:32:53] what could have happened in that kingdom
[1:32:55] what could have happened in that kingdom
[1:32:57] if he just approached them right
[1:32:59] right so there were many others who
[1:33:01] wanted to see jesus but they came with
[1:33:03] the wrong attitude now we have to come
[1:33:06] in humility
[1:33:08] and reverence
[1:33:09] right god doesn't owe us anything
[1:33:12] we owe him everything
[1:33:14] amen we aren't you know
[1:33:17] brother brahm says in one place if we
[1:33:18] come feeling we don't deserve the
[1:33:20] blessing we're actually in the right
[1:33:22] condition to receive it
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:26] so if you feel unworthy that's a good
[1:33:28] thing
[1:33:29] then you'll receive it hallelujah
[1:33:32] amen so blind bartimaeus he hears he
[1:33:35] hears the different testimonies of what
[1:33:37] happened through the life of
[1:33:38] jesus in the ministry and then he begins
[1:33:41] to realize that that same god his mother
[1:33:43] told him about
[1:33:45] amen was now walking right past him that
[1:33:48] he wasn't a god of history no more but
[1:33:50] he stepped out of history and he was now
[1:33:52] walking in flesh more than a prophet and
[1:33:55] so he began to cry out because he began
[1:33:57] to realize that jehovah is the same
[1:34:00] yesterday today and forever remember
[1:34:02] jehovah of the old testament is jesus
[1:34:04] christ of the new he just changes his
[1:34:06] form but he's the same god hello so so
[1:34:09] he was walking past them and that's why
[1:34:11] blind by blind bartimaeus began to
[1:34:13] realize now is my opportunity
[1:34:16] now is my opportunity today is a day of
[1:34:18] salvation why wait i may not have
[1:34:20] another opportunity i gotta i've got an
[1:34:22] audience right now and you know what's
[1:34:24] amazing when blind bartimaeus didn't
[1:34:27] know where to go to see god alive god
[1:34:29] gave came to him
[1:34:31] hallelujah many times we may not think
[1:34:33] where is jesus well if you have a real
[1:34:35] desire to meet jesus the lord jesus will
[1:34:37] come to you you may not know how to get
[1:34:39] to him but he'll get to you
[1:34:41] hallelujah so he began to cry out and
[1:34:44] noticed not everyone wasn't supportive
[1:34:46] of his cry oh praise the lord blind
[1:34:48] blind bartimaeus he's got some faith he
[1:34:50] really wants to be here legally you know
[1:34:52] jesus has healed other people he can
[1:34:54] heal blind bartimaeus no they weren't
[1:34:56] supportive
[1:34:57] the other church members weren't
[1:34:58] supportive they were saying be quiet
[1:35:01] many of them said stop stop what you're
[1:35:03] doing you're
[1:35:04] you're you're you're changing the whole
[1:35:06] scene i pray we change the whole thing
[1:35:09] hallelujah amen we changed the whole
[1:35:11] scene in a service i mean where our
[1:35:13] faith projects and we touch the lord
[1:35:16] hallelujah and then so he just cried out
[1:35:18] the more that's why i said in the
[1:35:19] beginning if the devil tells you to shut
[1:35:22] up and sit down do the opposite if he
[1:35:24] says there's no way you can ever meet
[1:35:26] the lord do the opposite if he says
[1:35:28] you've you you've sent away your day of
[1:35:30] grace go to him anyway go to the lord
[1:35:32] anyway just do vice versa
[1:35:35] hallelujah
[1:35:37] amen you know we can just like blind
[1:35:40] bartimaeus he cried out all the more
[1:35:43] and then that his faith because it
[1:35:44] wasn't his his voice necessarily that
[1:35:47] made jesus stop because a lot of people
[1:35:48] were shouting at the lord it was his
[1:35:50] faith may jesus stand still
[1:35:54] hallelujah and if our faith could just
[1:35:56] be projected today we can make the lord
[1:35:58] stand still
[1:36:00] amen because we get his attention who
[1:36:02] wants the lord's attention
[1:36:04] hallelujah remember our flag ain't too
[1:36:07] small we're not too insignificant that
[1:36:09] he can't see us waving our
[1:36:10] flag of faith hallelujah he sees our
[1:36:13] hearts cry he's interested in our needs
[1:36:16] he knew blind bartimaeus was blind but
[1:36:19] he didn't want him to stay blind
[1:36:21] hallelujah so then he calls he calls for
[1:36:25] him
[1:36:26] and then someone
[1:36:27] and then so so they commanded now blind
[1:36:30] barometers you know
[1:36:31] be of good comfort he calls for thee
[1:36:34] so blind bartimaeus it says cast he said
[1:36:37] casting away his garment he rose and
[1:36:39] came to jesus now this garment no doubt
[1:36:41] kept them warm because he was begging
[1:36:44] sitting there so this was very much
[1:36:45] identified with his old life as as a
[1:36:47] beggar
[1:36:49] but he knew he wouldn't come back and
[1:36:51] beg no more
[1:36:52] because he believed the lord could heal
[1:36:54] his eyes so he didn't put it somewhere
[1:36:56] where he could you know find it some
[1:36:58] necessarily he just cast it aside
[1:37:00] hallelujah that's why it's so important
[1:37:01] just cast aside your old life just let
[1:37:04] it go in order to to go somewhere you've
[1:37:07] got to leave somewhere
[1:37:08] right so in order for me to go home i've
[1:37:10] got to leave here
[1:37:12] i can't bring this with me
[1:37:14] i don't have the technology
[1:37:16] i can't physically bring this building
[1:37:18] home i've got to leave it
[1:37:20] right as the same thing in the spiritual
[1:37:23] if something's holding us back you've
[1:37:24] got to just let it go
[1:37:27] let it go and move on your past is
[1:37:29] holding you back just let it go the
[1:37:31] law's taking care of it
[1:37:32] anyway his blood is cleansed if you've
[1:37:35] thoroughly confessed that everything you
[1:37:36] know just surrendered your whole life
[1:37:38] it's gone
[1:37:40] hallelujah
[1:37:41] amen that's why you just gotta let it go
[1:37:43] you gotta just drop it and let it go i
[1:37:46] love zoom too you know
[1:37:48] praise the lord god bless you whoever's
[1:37:50] online now but you've got to let it go
[1:37:52] you just got to cast aside your garment
[1:37:54] amen amen
[1:37:56] and rose and then he came to jesus and
[1:37:59] then jesus asked him saying what would
[1:38:01] you have me do
[1:38:02] and the blind man said lord that i might
[1:38:04] receive my sight jesus said unto him go
[1:38:06] thy way thy faith has made thee whole
[1:38:09] and immediately he received his sight
[1:38:11] and followed jesus in the way
[1:38:13] so now what i love about this is is
[1:38:15] before when he was blind he was known as
[1:38:18] blind bartimaeus
[1:38:20] so his past or his current condition
[1:38:22] defined who he was
[1:38:24] amen but after the lord received his
[1:38:27] sight he wasn't blind bartimaeus no more
[1:38:30] right he could walk in this current
[1:38:32] world and not trip and stumble and fall
[1:38:35] when he was blind he'd had to feel his
[1:38:36] way around and ask people can you help
[1:38:38] me i need to get there because i knew
[1:38:40] where he begged you know can you help me
[1:38:42] sir and ma'am and watch out and things
[1:38:43] would he'd bump into things and you know
[1:38:46] but then when his eyes came open he
[1:38:48] could just walk
[1:38:50] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:38:52] you and i before the lord opens our eyes
[1:38:55] spiritually we are blind in this world
[1:38:58] we are spiritually blind in this world
[1:38:59] like the lord jesus said
[1:39:01] the blind lead the blind and they both
[1:39:03] fall into the ditch and he wasn't
[1:39:05] speaking about physical blindness he's
[1:39:06] speaking about spiritual blindness how
[1:39:08] the scribes and pharisees were
[1:39:10] spiritually blind but then so with
[1:39:12] bartimaeus now his eyes came open
[1:39:15] and maybe when he was walking around
[1:39:17] he would say hey blind bartimaeus how
[1:39:19] you doing he'd say don't call me blind
[1:39:23] do i look blind
[1:39:25] i can see you
[1:39:26] didn't realize you look like that but i
[1:39:27] can see you
[1:39:29] you know am i acting like a blind person
[1:39:32] am i stumbling around like a blind
[1:39:34] person do i need someone to lead me in
[1:39:36] the way
[1:39:37] do i get hit by stuff that i'm not aware
[1:39:39] is coming no i can see so don't don't
[1:39:42] define me by why by what i used to be
[1:39:45] it's the same thing with you and i the
[1:39:47] devil wants to define us by what we used
[1:39:49] to be
[1:39:50] i mean but we're believers now
[1:39:52] we're under the blood of jesus christ
[1:39:54] but the devil wants to drag up our
[1:39:56] dredge up our past and say you used to
[1:39:58] be this and used to be this and you say
[1:39:59] yeah i used to be
[1:40:01] i'm not now
[1:40:03] don't call me blind when i can see
[1:40:05] i'm not stumbling around i walk a man
[1:40:07] who can see a woman who can see walks
[1:40:09] different than a person who cannot
[1:40:12] right they can just walk around they can
[1:40:14] see they have depth perception they can
[1:40:16] you know and it's like a believer we
[1:40:18] walk different to the world
[1:40:20] we act different to the world i mean
[1:40:22] because we can see
[1:40:23] we can see the enemy in his tricks
[1:40:26] amen we can stay for you know yes like
[1:40:28] the prophet said you know you want to
[1:40:29] overcome he says you should be able to
[1:40:31] see that punches the devil's punches and
[1:40:34] and and sideset them before they come to
[1:40:35] you says that's overcoming you know
[1:40:38] instead of just walking into them all
[1:40:39] the time hey sometimes we do we get
[1:40:40] blindsided we're human but you know we
[1:40:43] can actually live in such a way we can
[1:40:45] see the tricks of the enemy and just
[1:40:46] just bypass
[1:40:48] and go the other way he wants to bring
[1:40:50] you down to a carnal atmosphere you can
[1:40:52] bypass it
[1:40:53] you can do the unexpected
[1:40:56] hallelujah
[1:40:58] amen because the devil wants us to react
[1:41:00] a certain way no we're going to react a
[1:41:02] different way how do how do you change
[1:41:05] the kind of an atmosphere don't answer
[1:41:07] him according to what he's trying to do
[1:41:09] you know he gets all me he you know
[1:41:11] people fuss and fight and carry on no
[1:41:13] don't respond according to that
[1:41:16] amen respond in a heavenly way
[1:41:20] like for example there's a bunch of
[1:41:22] trouble going on in the home
[1:41:24] just start singing a song
[1:41:26] start praying
[1:41:28] amen
[1:41:30] do the opposite
[1:41:32] amen so bartimaeus became bartimaeus
[1:41:36] he wasn't blind no more
[1:41:38] hallelujah
[1:41:40] and now he followed jesus in the way
[1:41:43] so he didn't stop there and get healed
[1:41:44] he began to follow jesus in the way
[1:41:47] amen now this way can be a way of
[1:41:49] persecution and trouble
[1:41:51] which it is but we have to realize that
[1:41:54] in order for there to be a resurrection
[1:41:55] there's got to be a calvary first in
[1:41:57] order for there to be a sunshine there's
[1:41:59] got to be a darkness
[1:42:01] i mean in order for there to be life
[1:42:03] there actually has to be death
[1:42:06] jesus had to go to calvary that life
[1:42:08] could come to you and i
[1:42:10] i mean he had to be mad more than any
[1:42:11] other man
[1:42:13] in order for life that we would be made
[1:42:14] whole
[1:42:15] amen so there has to be many times where
[1:42:17] you know we're going through a dark
[1:42:19] place light's coming
[1:42:21] life's coming
[1:42:24] joseph went through a dark place
[1:42:27] he was sold as a slave he was thrown
[1:42:29] into prison he is you know sold by his
[1:42:31] brother imagine the pain in agony
[1:42:33] because of just that one event the
[1:42:35] brothers that you know they just don't
[1:42:36] like you a little bit but actually one
[1:42:38] of them wants to kill you
[1:42:39] you know a lot of them i think was more
[1:42:41] than one but but but i think reuben said
[1:42:43] no no we can't do this and the very
[1:42:45] brothers he came to see how they're
[1:42:47] doing
[1:42:48] tie him up or or just throw him in the
[1:42:50] well
[1:42:51] and then and then he cries out there's
[1:42:53] no deliverance coming have you ever put
[1:42:54] yourself there
[1:42:56] you know this is not just some play some
[1:42:58] some emotionless play
[1:43:00] no he went through this
[1:43:02] and he he had to you know suffer the
[1:43:04] rejection of his brothers he's hauled
[1:43:06] out of the well he sold as a slave no
[1:43:08] doubt he'd be crying out brothers don't
[1:43:10] do this to me
[1:43:11] we're family
[1:43:13] we are the sons of abraham
[1:43:16] right we are we are circumcised
[1:43:17] believers don't don't do this to me what
[1:43:20] are you doing to me
[1:43:21] and he sold you know the transaction
[1:43:24] takes place he's taken down into egypt
[1:43:26] he had to live with that pain
[1:43:29] right and then and then you know finally
[1:43:32] you know he's
[1:43:33] part of his house then he you know
[1:43:35] part of his wife wants to commit
[1:43:36] adultery with him he says no you know
[1:43:38] i'm not going to sin against my god she
[1:43:40] she trumps up the charges he's in prison
[1:43:42] again all those things happen he's for
[1:43:44] and then and then the butler and baker
[1:43:45] are there
[1:43:46] and then he he interprets their dreams
[1:43:48] for him
[1:43:49] for them rather but then but then the
[1:43:53] butler forgets him after he's restored
[1:43:56] he has to sit there
[1:43:58] but then when it's all said and done and
[1:43:59] he's been exalted to the right hand of
[1:44:01] pharaoh and his brethren in front of him
[1:44:03] he said all this happened that life
[1:44:05] would be saved
[1:44:08] so
[1:44:10] we don't like cutting eh we don't like
[1:44:12] pain
[1:44:13] who likes pain
[1:44:16] i'm glad everyone's listening
[1:44:18] no one no human being likes pain and
[1:44:20] anguish and suffering
[1:44:22] but if you look through the scripture it
[1:44:24] takes a lot of anguish and suffering in
[1:44:26] order for a character to be molded in a
[1:44:28] certain way for then god to come upon
[1:44:30] the scene
[1:44:32] amen joseph was that way imagine imagine
[1:44:35] moses now moses through the great
[1:44:37] anguish of his life the first 80 years
[1:44:40] of his life
[1:44:42] he had to be hidden
[1:44:44] he was he was you know god allowed him
[1:44:46] to be raised up in the palace of the
[1:44:47] very one that he's going to be raised up
[1:44:49] to destroy
[1:44:51] amen pharaohs right but there's the
[1:44:53] anguish of the israelites and their
[1:44:54] slavery and all those things then he
[1:44:56] tried to deliver them but he just killed
[1:44:57] one egyptian he had to run for his life
[1:44:59] he's on the back side of the desert your
[1:45:01] backslidden prophet hiding away trying
[1:45:03] to live out his life like this you know
[1:45:05] there's a lot of pain
[1:45:07] but
[1:45:08] brother graham says that it's in those
[1:45:11] burning sands of experience
[1:45:13] where where men and women are molded
[1:45:16] into saints
[1:45:17] he says how lord how i thank you for
[1:45:19] those times
[1:45:21] that life will come
[1:45:24] jesus would be asked by in one place
[1:45:26] it's the mother of um the sons of
[1:45:28] thunder
[1:45:29] and then in other places actually the
[1:45:31] sons themselves the two disciples he
[1:45:33] says can we sit
[1:45:35] on your right and left hand when you
[1:45:37] come in glory
[1:45:38] and jesus asked them can you drink the
[1:45:40] cup that i will drink can you be
[1:45:42] baptized with a baptism that i am
[1:45:44] baptized with
[1:45:46] and they said yes we're able he says yes
[1:45:48] you shall
[1:45:49] drink of that cup what was that cup a
[1:45:52] cup of suffering i don't know why i'm
[1:45:53] going down this way but we're going down
[1:45:55] this way you know it was a cup of
[1:45:57] suffering there's actually a measure of
[1:45:58] suffering that's given to the church
[1:46:01] we didn't sign up for this but we signed
[1:46:04] up for it
[1:46:05] because we're made of the same stuff
[1:46:07] amen like joseph joseph was betraying
[1:46:10] not just christ but the believer
[1:46:12] we're the very ones that hurt and maim
[1:46:15] and scar
[1:46:16] and reject
[1:46:17] the lord can actually take that person
[1:46:19] that's been in that condition and use it
[1:46:21] their life will be saved
[1:46:24] hallelujah
[1:46:28] amen we're made of the same stuff are we
[1:46:30] not the same faith of them as in us
[1:46:33] praise the lord there's a certain
[1:46:34] suffering that is that is uh allotted to
[1:46:37] the church but it's for our good and
[1:46:39] it's for not just for ourselves remember
[1:46:42] everything we go through in our
[1:46:43] christian journey sure we get to go to
[1:46:45] heaven ourselves
[1:46:47] right we get to meet the lord ourselves
[1:46:49] but most of our testimony is actually
[1:46:51] going to say for others
[1:46:55] amen how else can we enter into other
[1:46:57] people's prayer needs
[1:46:59] how can we actually put ourselves in
[1:47:00] their shoes and actually understand
[1:47:01] where they're coming from
[1:47:03] amen
[1:47:05] it's like brother brown when he when is
[1:47:06] when winners when his baby sharon rose
[1:47:08] was dying
[1:47:09] you know her eyes were crossing in the
[1:47:11] pain nothing could be done for her
[1:47:13] and and and she died and you know
[1:47:16] he he buried her
[1:47:18] with her with his first wife
[1:47:20] he would say after that
[1:47:22] that every child that came across a
[1:47:24] platform with cross eyes they never left
[1:47:26] with crossed eyes
[1:47:27] because he could enter into the burden
[1:47:28] of that child
[1:47:30] hallelujah
[1:47:32] so what about us we say why did i have
[1:47:33] to go through that god wants to use it
[1:47:36] he wants to use our path nothing nothing
[1:47:38] that happens in our life is actually in
[1:47:40] vain
[1:47:41] god wants to use it for a specific
[1:47:43] reason
[1:47:44] hallelujah we can enter into someone's
[1:47:46] burden actually pray for them in a
[1:47:48] greater way that someone else that just
[1:47:50] sympathizes
[1:47:51] amen sure it's good to sympathize with
[1:47:53] someone in prayer but when you've really
[1:47:54] been in their shoes
[1:47:56] oh boy you can really pray
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:01] hallelujah now
[1:48:06] amen so he followed him in the way now
[1:48:07] the apostle paul would say speaking to
[1:48:09] king agrippa i believe it was now but
[1:48:12] this i confess unto thee
[1:48:13] that after the way which they call
[1:48:15] heresy so worship by the god of my
[1:48:18] fathers believing all which is written
[1:48:20] in the law and in the prophets amen so
[1:48:23] so blind bartimaeus followed him in the
[1:48:25] way followed jesus and then the apostle
[1:48:27] paul saying in the way that's that which
[1:48:29] is called heresy this is the way i
[1:48:30] worship god so they had to walk that
[1:48:32] same kind of way but but the thing is
[1:48:35] the apostle paul realized they may call
[1:48:37] it heresy
[1:48:38] or another translation is a cultural
[1:48:40] sect
[1:48:41] but
[1:48:42] he says the reason they call it this is
[1:48:44] because i believe the whole word
[1:48:47] so worship i the god of my father's
[1:48:50] believing all things which are written
[1:48:51] in the law and the prophets
[1:48:53] i mean so
[1:48:54] people may think it's crazy to believe
[1:48:56] the whole word of god but actually you
[1:48:58] know they may call it all kinds of
[1:48:59] things but this is the way
[1:49:02] amen amen hallelujah
[1:49:04] now
[1:49:07] blind bartimaeus now i just have i think
[1:49:09] i just have one more thing i want to
[1:49:10] bring out here
[1:49:11] so blind bartimaeus realized now here
[1:49:14] comes jehovah god this is this is god
[1:49:16] the old testament i heard about he's
[1:49:18] here today
[1:49:19] he can answer what he did for them he
[1:49:21] can do for me
[1:49:23] this is this is what he believed now if
[1:49:25] we could go through all the testimonies
[1:49:28] the syrophoenician woman daughter
[1:49:30] grievously vicks vicks by devil
[1:49:33] if he can do it for her he can do it for
[1:49:35] me
[1:49:36] amen i'm sick and body if he could do it
[1:49:38] for them he can do it for me
[1:49:40] hallelujah amen
[1:49:43] amen cancers in my body if it can heal
[1:49:45] others he can heal me
[1:49:47] amen wayward family he can do it for
[1:49:49] them he can do it for me finances have
[1:49:51] gone to nothing if he could do it for
[1:49:53] them he can do it for me amen trouble in
[1:49:55] the home god brings peace if he can do
[1:49:57] it for them he can do it for me
[1:49:59] hallelujah the impossible if he could do
[1:50:01] it for them he can do it for me
[1:50:04] hallelujah brother brown would testify
[1:50:06] he'd say about a man who would who who
[1:50:08] who sponsored sponsored his meetings and
[1:50:10] and and he was doing some construction
[1:50:12] work or something and a wall fell upon
[1:50:14] him and mashed his body
[1:50:16] and and this man is lying in hospital i
[1:50:18] know where it was in america somewhere
[1:50:20] brother brahms there not even near where
[1:50:22] he was and he says now this man's helped
[1:50:24] the meetings you know he's been
[1:50:25] supportive but he's but he's on his
[1:50:28] deathbed
[1:50:29] and then he'd begin to say well if the
[1:50:31] lord jesus was here
[1:50:33] he and his great faith would go lay his
[1:50:35] hands upon him and pronounce him well
[1:50:38] but me i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[1:50:40] you know but then he began to think
[1:50:42] if the lord jesus would would would come
[1:50:44] and use
[1:50:45] use his own body to do it it's the same
[1:50:48] filthy hands but it's the same god
[1:50:51] right and then he just prayed for him
[1:50:53] because he's the same god
[1:50:55] and that man got healed and in the next
[1:50:57] morning he was in the meeting solid well
[1:51:01] hallelujah so
[1:51:03] impossible so it seemed impossible for
[1:51:05] this man to ever to live
[1:51:06] but the prophet realized jesus christ is
[1:51:08] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:51:10] amen and the same you know if we're
[1:51:13] believers god can do the same things
[1:51:15] can he not
[1:51:17] amen if he can do it for them he can do
[1:51:20] it for us
[1:51:22] if he can fill them with the holy ghost
[1:51:24] he can fill me
[1:51:26] hallelujah if he can save the philippian
[1:51:28] jailer and his family if he did it for
[1:51:30] them he can do it for me
[1:51:33] isn't that right amen hallelujah if he
[1:51:35] can raise the dead he could he can do it
[1:51:37] today
[1:51:38] he's the same god
[1:51:40] amen because remember the same pillar of
[1:51:42] fire that was in the believers in the
[1:51:44] new testament is the same pillar of fire
[1:51:46] today the same one that led them in the
[1:51:47] old testament
[1:51:48] then dwelled in the in the book of acts
[1:51:50] church is the same god today
[1:51:52] amen so if we can do it for them he can
[1:51:54] do it for me
[1:51:56] hallelujah
[1:51:57] amen because he is the same god this
[1:52:00] morning he hasn't changed
[1:52:03] i remember we just get into an
[1:52:04] atmosphere of believing
[1:52:06] he's the same god how is he going to
[1:52:07] work it out he worked it out for them
[1:52:09] he worked it out for noah
[1:52:11] and the saving of his house if he can do
[1:52:13] it for him he can do it for me well
[1:52:15] there's not a flood coming but there's a
[1:52:16] rapture coming
[1:52:18] just like the ark transported them from
[1:52:19] one world to another amen the ark the
[1:52:22] lord jesus christ is going to transport
[1:52:24] us from this world to the next world
[1:52:26] so if he can do it for them he can do it
[1:52:28] for me who believes that this morning
[1:52:31] how's it going to work out god takes
[1:52:33] care of the details

[1:52:41] salvation he's full of healing he's full
[1:52:43] of redemption
