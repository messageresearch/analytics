[14:15] We're living the jubilee.
[14:17] Yes, we are.
[14:20] [Music]
[14:36] Years and years I
[14:39] labored. Toil and tears were my
[14:44] me since my dentist took me
[14:48] prisoner. Sold me to slavery.
[14:54] But every day that I
[14:57] toil, the
[15:01] 49er, the 49th year was the longest
[15:06] year. And then I heard the trumpet
[15:10] sound. When I heard that jubilee, I walk
[15:15] free. I walk free. I walk free. And when
[15:21] I heard that jubilee, I walk free. And I
[15:26] ain't going back to
[15:29] slavery because Jesus has set me
[15:37] free. Years and years of
[15:41] confusion. I had eyes but couldn't see.
[15:46] The enemy had me stumbling in darkness
[15:52] turn into
[15:55] slavery. But then I heard the prophet
[16:00] speaking. Heard the voice behind the
[16:04] voice. He opened up the word and let the
[16:08] light shine in. Said, "You can all go
[16:12] free."
[16:14] When I heard the jubilee, I'll walk
[16:19] free. I walk
[16:21] free. I walk free. And when I heard the
[16:26] jubilee, I walk free and I'm going back
[16:31] to
[16:32] slavery because Jesus has set me free.
[16:40] And when I heard the Jubilee, I walk
[16:45] free. I walk free. I walk free. And when
[16:50] I heard the Jubilee, I walk free. And I
[16:56] ain't going back to
[16:59] slavery because Jesus has set me free.
[17:08] Jesus has set me
[17:11] free. Jesus has set me
[17:16] free. And him whom the son set
[17:21] free. He is free
[17:25] indeed. Oh Jesus has set me
[17:31] free. Jesus has set me free.
[17:36] And whom the sun sets
[17:41] free. He is free
[17:45] indeed. Oh heard the jubilee. I walk
[17:50] free. I walk
[17:53] free. I walk free. And when I heard the
[17:58] jubilee I walk free. And I ain't going
[18:02] back to slavery.
[18:05] Because Jesus has set me
[18:11] free. And when I heard the jubilee, I
[18:16] walk
[18:17] free. I walk free. I walk free. And when
[18:22] I heard the jubilee, I walk free. And
[18:27] I'm going back to
[18:31] slavery because Jesus has set me
[18:36] free. Because Jesus has set me
[18:43] [Music]
[18:48] free. Oh wow. That song is such a
[18:51] blessing. Oh yes.
[18:55] [Music]
[19:04] I will enter his gates with thanksgiving
[19:08] in my heart. I will enter his courts
[19:12] with
[19:13] praise. I will say, "This is the day
[19:16] that the Lord has made. I will rejoice
[19:20] for he has made me glad.
[19:24] For he has made me glad. He has made me
[19:28] glad. I will rejoice. For he has made me
[19:33] glad. He has made me glad. He has made
[19:37] me glad. I will rejoice for he has made
[19:41] me
[19:42] glad. I will enter his gates with
[19:46] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter
[19:50] his courts with praise.
[19:53] I will say this is the day that the Lord
[19:57] has made. I will rejoice for he made me
[20:02] glad. Oh, he has made me glad. He has
[20:07] made me glad. I will rejoice for he has
[20:10] made me
[20:13] glad. He has made me glad. He has made
[20:17] me glad. I will rejoice for he has made

[20:23] I will enter his gates with thanksgiving
[20:26] in my heart. I will enter his court with
[20:32] praise. I will say, "This is the day
[20:35] that the Lord has made. I will rejoice
[20:39] for he has made me
[20:42] glad." Oh, he has made me glad. He has
[20:46] made me glad. I will rejoice for he has
[20:50] made me glad.
[20:53] He has made me glad. He has made me
[20:57] glad. I will rejoice for He has made me
[21:01] glad. I will rejoice for He has made me
[21:08] glad. Oh

[45:37] [Music]
[45:40] merit
[45:42] would not take thy faith.
[45:50] Heal my wounded broken
[45:57] spirit.
[45:58] Save me
[46:01] by thy grace.
[46:06] Oh
[46:09] savior,
[46:11] [Music]
[46:14] savior here my
[46:18] humble cry.
[46:24] While on others thou art
[46:30] called do not
[46:34] pass me by.
[46:40] Thou the spring of all might
[46:44] come.
[46:47] Comfort
[46:48] more than life to
[46:55] me.
[46:57] Whom have I on earth
[47:01] beside thee?
[47:05] Whom in heaven but
[47:09] [Music]
[47:12] thee.
[47:16] Savior,
[47:20] Savior, hear my
[47:25] heart cry.
[47:31] While on others thou

[47:46] me. Amen.
[47:51] [Music]
[48:07] Were it not for thy nail scarred hands?
[48:16] Nailed scarred
[48:18] hands and
[48:20] thorny
[48:23] veins. Were it not for thy love for
[48:31] me?
[48:33] unfailing love that shows
[48:38] [Music]
[48:40] Calary. Then such a
[48:44] one condemned as
[48:48] I would have no
[48:53] pardon and I die.
[48:58] But thou, oh
[49:01] Lord, you took my
[49:05] place. You took my
[49:08] [Music]
[49:09] place. You took my place.
[49:14] [Music]
[49:18] And you bore my sin on your
[49:25] shoulders when you could have
[49:29] had it all. You chose me to be the one
[49:35] that you would die
[49:37] for, the one that you would
[49:41] save, the one that you would carry. From
[49:46] the cradle to the grave.
[49:50] The one that you would care
[49:53] for. The one that you would
[49:57] raise, the one that you would see
[50:01] through every storm and every wave. You
[50:06] chose
[50:06] [Music]
[50:12] me. You chose me.
[50:17] [Music]
[50:23] Were it not for thy nail scarred
[50:30] hands? Nail scarred
[50:33] hands and
[50:35] thorny
[50:38] bands. Were it not for thy love for me?
[50:48] unfailing love that chose
[50:53] [Music]
[50:54] Calary. Then such a
[50:59] one condemned as
[51:03] I would have no
[51:07] part and I die.
[51:12] But thou, oh
[51:15] Lord, you took my
[51:19] place. You took my
[51:23] place. You took my place.
[51:31] And you bore my sins on your
[51:38] shoulders when you could have had it
[51:43] all. You chose me to be the one that you
[51:48] would die
[51:50] for, the one that you would
[51:54] save, the one that you would carry. From
[51:58] the cradle to the
[52:02] grave. The one that you would care
[52:06] for. The one that you would
[52:09] raise, the one that you would see
[52:13] through every storm and every wave. You
[52:18] chose
[52:25] me. You chose me.
[52:33] And you bore my sin on your
[52:39] shoulders when you could have
[52:43] had it all. You chose me to be the one
[52:49] that you would die
[52:51] for, the one that you would

[53:07] for, the one that you would
[53:11] raise, the one that you would see

[53:19] chose me.
[53:27] You chose
[53:29] [Music]
[53:34] me. You chose
[53:39] [Music]
[53:42] me. You chose me.
[53:51] You chose me.
[53:57] Oh Lord.
[54:00] Oh
[54:01] Lord, what can we say? Lord,
[54:05] you chose
[54:07] us and we are indebted to
[54:10] you and we give what we have Lord and
[54:13] that is our lives. We give it to
[54:15] you because it is

[57:57] do. And we're going to say yes, Lord.
[58:00] Lord. Hallelujah. God, you know, you

[58:50] we've come to praise you. We've come to
[58:52] give you glory. Lord, something in us
[58:54] just says, "Worthy art thou. Worthy art
[58:57] thou, lamb, mighty lamb of God." Oh,
[58:59] you're such a strong lamb. You're a
[59:01] powerful lamb. Lord, you wrestled and
[59:03] you overcame, oh God. Father, we're so
[59:05] thankful that you are bloody. You were
[59:07] wounded, but you overcame. Father, you
[59:09] conquered everything. Hell, death, and
[59:11] the grave, and you rose again.
[59:13] Hallelujah. You're not a dead God to us,
[59:15] Lord. You're a living God. Father,
[59:17] you're the great I am, oh God. We want
[59:19] to praise your great name there, Lord.
[59:21] That you would wash away our sins, Lord.
[59:23] That you'd redeem us, oh God. Father,
[59:25] that you'd come down to where we are, oh
[59:27] Lord. Father, we're so thankful that you
[59:30] made us worthy. You made us worthy, oh
[59:32] God. You've redeemed us, oh God. Father,
[59:35] we praise your mighty name tonight,
[59:37] Lord. Father, I believe there's victory
[59:39] here, oh God, because you said it is
[59:41] finished that day on Calvary. And we
[59:43] just see your victory being lived out
[59:45] every day. Your great victory being
[59:47] lived out every day. And we thank you,
[59:49] oh God. This is another day to see your
[59:51] victory lived out, Lord Jesus. Oh,
[59:54] Father, I pray you'd help us yield to
[59:56] your Holy Spirit, dear God. Father, may
[59:59] we just yield ourselves now. Father, may
[1:00:02] we be pliable and flexible and yielding
[1:00:04] to your word. Father, as it comes forth,
[1:00:06] dear God, may we just surrender
[1:00:08] ourselves. Dear God, lift us up into
[1:00:11] heavenly places, oh God. Father, if
[1:00:13] we're not there, Lord, if there's anyone
[1:00:14] here who doesn't know you, God, Father,
[1:00:16] may just go to where they are, dear
[1:00:18] Lord. Father, you're a gentleman, oh
[1:00:21] God. Father, you don't force yourself
[1:00:23] upon anyone. Oh God, help us to open
[1:00:26] every door, Lord. I pray, Father, may
[1:00:29] you just have your way in this service,
[1:00:30] dear God. Father, we could we could
[1:00:33] literally live here the rest of our
[1:00:34] lives and just recount the great things
[1:00:36] you've done. Father, we're looking
[1:00:38] forward to what you're going to do
[1:00:40] tonight, dear Lord. Father, your people
[1:00:42] are believing. You're here, oh God. Have
[1:00:45] your way among us, Lord. Have your way
[1:00:47] among us, dear Lord Jesus. We pray, oh
[1:00:50] God, have your way among us, Father. We
[1:00:52] ask Lord. Oh in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:00:55] ask these things dear God.
[1:00:58] Amen.

[1:01:03] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes Lord. Yes
[1:01:10] Lord.
[1:01:13] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:16] So just before we start. So just before
[1:01:18] we start, Sister Hunley said to me
[1:01:22] Brother Pete in the hospital. She said,
[1:01:24] maybe I should get a t test. She said
[1:01:26] Pete's legs the same, but he's
[1:01:27] rejoicing. Amen. And he says, God is
[1:01:30] dealing with him like he's never dealt
[1:01:32] with him before.
[1:01:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Victory.
[1:01:39] Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] What happens? Who cares about the body?
[1:01:44] Amen. If God deals with a soul, but you
[1:01:47] can always get sick again. But if you're
[1:01:48] redeemed, you're redeemed. Amen.
[1:01:50] Hallelujah.
[1:01:52] Aren't you glad God's not confined to
[1:01:54] walls? Amen. Where he goes to where his
[1:01:56] children are and he can come to where
[1:01:59] you are right now. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:02:01] just sing this. Amen. Just as our

[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:29] Glorious loving
[1:03:32] father tonight. Father, we can never
[1:03:35] pray enough, Lord. Oh God. And we Lord,
[1:03:39] we just thank you, Lord, from the inside
[1:03:41] of the inside, Lord, for what you've
[1:03:43] done, Father. Lord, and we also thank
[1:03:47] you for what you are doing right now,
[1:03:49] Father. Lord Jesus, you're a God of now.
[1:03:52] You're the I am, Father. Lord, we call
[1:03:54] that I am on the scene tonight, Father.
[1:03:57] Lord Jesus, your word is here, Lord, in
[1:04:00] bride form. Your word is here in Holy
[1:04:02] Spirit form, Father. And your word is
[1:04:04] here also in written form, Father. Lord,
[1:04:06] we pray tonight, Lord, that that word
[1:04:08] alone will be manifested, Father. Lord,
[1:04:11] because you've promised, Lord, when I be
[1:04:13] lifted up, Lord, I will draw all men
[1:04:15] unto me, Father. And we want all men to
[1:04:17] be drawn to you tonight, Lord. Father,
[1:04:20] you know the needs tonight, Father, you
[1:04:21] know every need in every heart tonight,
[1:04:24] Lord. You know every question, Lord. You
[1:04:25] know every complex. You know every
[1:04:27] challenge that people are struggling
[1:04:29] with, Father. Lord Jesus. And you know,
[1:04:31] Father, what it will take to break those
[1:04:33] bonds, Lord. Father, but Jesus breaks
[1:04:36] every feta, Lord. Lord, and you have
[1:04:39] already broken those fetterss on
[1:04:40] Calvary, Lord. And I pray tonight that
[1:04:43] you will give revelation, Father, of
[1:04:46] those fetters that are broken, Lord.
[1:04:49] God, we love you and appreciate you,
[1:04:51] Lord. And Father, we just calling you on
[1:04:53] the scene again tonight, Father. We pray
[1:04:55] that you will, Lord, cast out any wrong
[1:04:59] spirit, Father, Lord Jesus. And we pray
[1:05:01] that your angels will encamp around us
[1:05:03] now, Lord. make your word alive to us,
[1:05:06] Father. You're the author of the word,
[1:05:07] Father. Lord Jesus, it's only by your
[1:05:10] authority, Father, that we can bring the
[1:05:12] word, Lord. Father, and we call that
[1:05:14] authority on the senior. We ask it in
[1:05:17] the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:21] Amen. Thank you very much,
[1:05:24] musicians. Amen. God bless you, brothers
[1:05:26] and sisters. It's a privilege to be here
[1:05:29] tonight. I'm
[1:05:31] just so humbled and so excited about
[1:05:34] what the Lord has done for us so far.
[1:05:37] You know, the Lord is I wonder if you
[1:05:40] can take your seats just for a moment as
[1:05:42] I just kind of get adjusted for a
[1:05:46] moment. But you know, it's just what it
[1:05:49] I marvel in how the word is continuous
[1:05:52] and how the Lord opens the word to us
[1:05:57] and how simple the word is becoming.
[1:06:00] Amen. I just marvel at how the Lord is
[1:06:03] bringing things that, you know, that
[1:06:05] it's deep. But deep no longer means
[1:06:08] intellectually out of my hands. Amen.
[1:06:11] Out of my reach. Deep doesn't mean
[1:06:13] something that I, you know, that you
[1:06:14] have to have a PhD to understand. Amen.
[1:06:18] Hallelujah. There's a brother in
[1:06:20] Australia. He calls a PhD a post hole
[1:06:23] digger. Amen.
[1:06:25] And you know the other day I I read a
[1:06:27] quote where brother Brandham speaks
[1:06:29] about the post hole digger and I wonder
[1:06:30] whether he got it from there. But
[1:06:32] anyway, praise the Lord we uh we don't
[1:06:35] rely on those things my brother and
[1:06:36] sister. What we relying on is the
[1:06:38] experience. Brother Aram speaks about
[1:06:40] how when God sent the the disciples out,
[1:06:43] he said he didn't say go teach the
[1:06:46] nations. Amen. He said go out and preach
[1:06:48] this gospel. He says by what? Testim
[1:06:50] test testifying of what the Lord has
[1:06:52] done for you. And it and it goes with
[1:06:54] with signs and wonders following. Amen.
[1:06:57] Because Jesus Christ is on display.
[1:06:59] Amen. And as our brother Timmer has
[1:07:01] said, I mean, when Jesus Christ is on
[1:07:03] display, that makes another Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] in the next one. Amen. And that's how
[1:07:09] these these things get get perpetuated.
[1:07:12] Amen. That's how disciples are made.
[1:07:14] That's disciplehip is that every next
[1:07:17] one is following God in the previous one
[1:07:20] and becoming that. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:25] Now, before I want to start tonight, I
[1:07:28] will say that um I'm not going to preach
[1:07:30] anything that you haven't heard already
[1:07:32] this weekend probably. Um as we were
[1:07:35] traveling down on
[1:07:37] Friday, the Lord inspired a specific
[1:07:41] thought and um gave me a number of
[1:07:44] scriptures and things. So just as a real
[1:07:46] kind of framework and skeleton of of
[1:07:49] what he placed on my heart to to bring
[1:07:50] to you
[1:07:52] tonight. And then on Friday night when
[1:07:55] uh I think it was brother Isaac that
[1:07:58] introduced the the new song and the camp
[1:08:01] theme song, I was jumping out of my
[1:08:04] seat. Amen. And I was having a little
[1:08:08] jubilee because that's the title of of
[1:08:11] the sermon. Amen.
[1:08:16] But yeah, brother Tim has already
[1:08:17] preached most of it and brother Ben has
[1:08:19] preached the rest of it. So, praise the
[1:08:21] Lord. I all I will do tonight is I'll be
[1:08:24] like one of those men. I think it was
[1:08:26] Joshua and and another one who held up
[1:08:28] Moses's hands. Amen. So, tonight I'll
[1:08:31] just hold up brother Tim's hands and and
[1:08:34] just say amen to the things he said so
[1:08:37] far. So you can relax now and you know
[1:08:40] there's you're not going to hopefully
[1:08:41] you're not you're not too tired to
[1:08:43] follow where we're going tonight. It
[1:08:45] will just be very simple. But I trust
[1:08:48] that the Lord will just somehow touch
[1:08:50] your faith tonight. Amen. So I wonder if
[1:08:53] we can stand together and go to John
[1:08:55] chapter
[1:09:02] 8. Hallelujah.
[1:09:05] I'd like to also just bring greetings
[1:09:07] from Stratford from the assembly there
[1:09:11] and just say we appreciate brother Ben
[1:09:13] and we appreciate the the assembly down
[1:09:15] in Wellington. Amen. And just um we
[1:09:19] kindred spirits and like close friends
[1:09:21] and we just have close ties with him and
[1:09:23] just really appreciate them. But we also
[1:09:25] appreciate what the Lord has done for
[1:09:27] them. It's amazing to think it's been
[1:09:29] more than four years now since they
[1:09:31] since they started and what the Lord has
[1:09:33] done in this time. Amen.
[1:09:37] John chapter 8 and we'll start from
[1:09:39] verse
[1:09:41] 31. Then said Jesus to those Jews which
[1:09:44] believed on him, if you continue in my
[1:09:46] word, then are you my disciples indeed,
[1:09:50] and you shall know the truth, and the
[1:09:52] truth shall make you free. They answered
[1:09:54] him, "We be Abram&lt;unk&gt;'s seed, and were
[1:09:56] never in bondage to any man. How sayest
[1:09:59] thou, you shall be made free?" Jesus
[1:10:02] answered them, "Verily, verily, I say
[1:10:03] unto you, whosoever committh sin is the
[1:10:06] servant of sin, and the servant abideth
[1:10:09] not in the house forever, but the Son
[1:10:11] abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall
[1:10:14] make you free, you shall be free
[1:10:16] indeed." I'll just read that last verse
[1:10:18] again. If the Son therefore shall make
[1:10:20] you free, you shall be free indeed.
[1:10:25] Lord Jesus, we just commit this word
[1:10:27] into your hands now, Father, and pray
[1:10:29] that you'll have full control and
[1:10:31] freedom, Father, to go where you would
[1:10:33] like to go, Father. Lord, we commit the
[1:10:35] service into your precious hands now in
[1:10:37] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:10:40] You may be
[1:10:49] seated. Now, I want to pick up this
[1:10:53] thought from the perspective of the
[1:10:56] birth of a little human
[1:10:59] baby. And by the way, Brother Tim, I'm
[1:11:02] one up on you. The
[1:11:07] Lord, I haven't got to the finger
[1:11:09] technology yet, but
[1:11:13] hallelujah. Amen. So um I want to speak
[1:11:17] from the principle of a human baby or
[1:11:20] for that for that matter any baby in the
[1:11:22] womb of its mother. Amen. And how
[1:11:26] there's a process that needs to happen
[1:11:27] for that for that little embryo to be
[1:11:31] transformed into a little human being
[1:11:34] walking around on this earth. And if if
[1:11:37] that little baby could think like an
[1:11:39] adult would think, that little baby
[1:11:41] would would be in that womb. And as you
[1:11:45] can see, nice cushy safe environment.
[1:11:48] Amen. Food and drink on tap. Amen. Safe
[1:11:53] as can be. Why on earth would that
[1:11:56] little baby want to get out of there?
[1:11:58] Amen. And if you started telling that
[1:12:01] little baby, well, here's the benefits.
[1:12:03] Amen. here where you are. You can't
[1:12:06] walk. Walk. What's that? Amen. You can't
[1:12:10] talk. Well, what's that? Amen. You can't
[1:12:13] experience things. You can't use your
[1:12:15] senses. You can't nothing. All those
[1:12:17] kind of things. You can convince that
[1:12:18] little baby with nothing that it's
[1:12:21] better to be on the other side. Amen.
[1:12:25] However, the reason for that baby being
[1:12:27] there in the first place was never to be
[1:12:29] in that womb. Amen. the reason for its
[1:12:32] existence, the reason for it starting to
[1:12:34] grow, the reason for the the food that's
[1:12:37] being pumped down, that connection with
[1:12:40] mom and and all of those things. The
[1:12:43] whole point of that is that there needs
[1:12:44] to be an expression someday. Amen. There
[1:12:47] needs to be an expression where there
[1:12:49] needs to be a breach made. Amen. And
[1:12:51] that little baby can come forth in the
[1:12:54] manifestation. Amen. Of that little seed
[1:12:57] that started the whole
[1:12:59] process. Amen. But that little baby may
[1:13:02] be very very scared. Amen.
[1:13:05] Because I mean quite frankly this big
[1:13:08] world out there is really scary. Amen.
[1:13:11] Instead of this little small cage that
[1:13:13] is in now suddenly is this huge wide
[1:13:16] world with all its influences with all
[1:13:18] its sicknesses with all its devils with
[1:13:20] all those things that that little baby
[1:13:22] needs to face now. Amen. So before that
[1:13:26] baby has experienced
[1:13:29] life, life can be a very daunting thing
[1:13:32] for it. Amen.
[1:13:36] Now, in that same kind of
[1:13:39] thinking, you can also sometimes have
[1:13:43] prisoners that when they've served a
[1:13:46] long sentence in prison, they've gotten
[1:13:50] so used to every day in the cell, same
[1:13:53] old thing, food gets supplied, you know,
[1:13:57] I don't have to plan, I don't have to
[1:13:58] think, I don't have to. Nothing. Amen.
[1:14:01] And when they need to go out into the
[1:14:03] real world, I mean, they can be fearful.
[1:14:06] There's stories of guys that's really
[1:14:08] fearful that doesn't want to go out
[1:14:09] there that doesn't want to face what we
[1:14:12] see as normal anymore because they're
[1:14:15] afraid of what we see as normal. Amen.
[1:14:19] Just because they've gotten used to
[1:14:21] being confined. They've you be become
[1:14:23] used to being dumbed down. They've been
[1:14:25] used to just everything is decided for
[1:14:28] me. Amen. I don't have to make choices.
[1:14:31] Amen. Sometimes for children, that's the
[1:14:34] hardest thing to learn to make choices.
[1:14:36] To learn to, you know, to see that
[1:14:38] there's multiple options and if I make
[1:14:40] that option, I'm going to I'm going to,
[1:14:42] you know, hurt this one and if I'm if I
[1:14:44] choose that option, then I'm going to
[1:14:45] impact that one. What's the best way to
[1:14:47] do all those kind of things? Amen. And
[1:14:49] if you sit in that prison cell, well,
[1:14:51] the warden just said, "Shut up. Sit
[1:14:53] there. Right now, it's time. Come out.
[1:14:56] Time for lunch. Go back. Time for
[1:14:59] shower. Go in there. They decide
[1:15:01] everything for you. Amen. Am I allowed
[1:15:04] to this or that? No. Okay. End of story.
[1:15:07] Amen. But maturity and freedom, Amen. is
[1:15:12] much more than that. And you can be
[1:15:13] afraid to to to go out of that prison
[1:15:16] gates. Amen. And and have to face those
[1:15:20] things.
[1:15:21] Freedom is sometimes scary.
[1:15:26] But now of course once you are out and
[1:15:30] once you are experiencing those things
[1:15:32] and once you are used to those things
[1:15:34] now who would ever want to go back amen
[1:15:39] I'll ask anyone here who wants to go
[1:15:40] back into mommy's womb. Amen. Why on
[1:15:44] earth would we want to do that? Amen.
[1:15:46] Now to be confined to that little space
[1:15:48] and you have no choice. You can't
[1:15:49] express yourself. You can't fellowship.
[1:15:51] You can't nothing else. Amen. All the
[1:15:53] things that you were afraid of are the
[1:15:55] things that you now enjoy. Amen. Are the
[1:15:58] things that you don't want want to to
[1:16:00] remit anymore. You don't want to get,
[1:16:02] you know, lose those things anymore.
[1:16:05] Hallelujah. So, with that as a little
[1:16:06] bit of a background, I wonder if we can
[1:16:08] turn together to Deuteronomy
[1:16:12] 15. You all know exactly where I'm going
[1:16:15] now. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:23] Deuteronomy 15 and we'll start from
[1:16:25] verse 12.
[1:16:41] And if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a
[1:16:43] Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and
[1:16:46] serve three uh serve thee six years,
[1:16:49] then in the seventh year thou shalt let
[1:16:51] him go free from thee.
[1:16:54] Amen. The
[1:16:56] elect cannot be kept bound down beyond
[1:17:00] six ages. Amen. In the seventh age, in
[1:17:04] the seventh time, amen, she can go free.
[1:17:08] But then the flip side is outside of
[1:17:11] election that doesn't apply.
[1:17:14] You have to have a to be a Hebrew in
[1:17:17] type. Verse 13. And when thou sendest
[1:17:19] him out free from thee, thou shalt not
[1:17:21] let him go away empty.
[1:17:25] Amen. Now, we've heard so much about the
[1:17:27] Jubilee this weekend. Amen. We've heard
[1:17:30] so much about that principle of the
[1:17:31] Jubilee year. Amen. And that freedom
[1:17:34] that comes with it and all those kind of
[1:17:35] things. Amen. That is the time when God
[1:17:39] can fully unleash all the blessings upon
[1:17:41] us.
[1:17:43] Amen. We were in bondage. Amen. Is now
[1:17:46] being flooded with spiritual blessings
[1:17:49] just like this one. Amen. They were a
[1:17:52] slave to someone else, a Hebrew. Amen.
[1:17:55] They were enslaved to another Hebrew.
[1:17:58] And at the seventh year, they not only
[1:18:01] let go, but they are lavished with
[1:18:03] blessings.
[1:18:05] Hallelujah. Thou shalt furnish him,
[1:18:06] furnish him liberally out of thy flock,
[1:18:09] and out of thy flock, and out of thy
[1:18:11] wine press, of that wherewith the Lord
[1:18:13] thy God hath blessed thee, thou shalt
[1:18:15] give unto him. Thou shalt remember that
[1:18:18] thou was a bondman in the land of Egypt,
[1:18:20] and the Lord thy God redeemed thee.
[1:18:22] Therefore I command thee this thing
[1:18:24] today.
[1:18:26] And it shall be, and this is one of the
[1:18:28] saddest things for me, it shall be, if
[1:18:31] he say unto thee, I will not go away
[1:18:33] from thee, because he loveth thee and
[1:18:36] thine house, because he is well with
[1:18:38] thee, then thou shalt take an all and
[1:18:40] thrust it through his ear unto the door,
[1:18:43] and he shall be thy servant forever, and
[1:18:46] also unto thy maid's servant thou shalt
[1:18:48] do
[1:18:50] likewise. Now, just like that baby or
[1:18:52] that little prisoner, Amen. There's
[1:18:55] someone here who's entitled to a
[1:18:57] birthright. Amen. In the lineage of
[1:19:00] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. Amen. They have
[1:19:03] all this rights. Amen. They've been
[1:19:06] given an allocated portion in the land.
[1:19:09] Amen. But they've got accustomed to
[1:19:11] being dumbed down and work for someone
[1:19:13] else. Amen. And be confined and and and
[1:19:16] their rights being limited and so forth.
[1:19:19] Amen. And someone that say, I don't want
[1:19:22] to make a life for myself now. I don't
[1:19:24] want to go out and fend for myself.
[1:19:26] Amen. I need the slave master now to
[1:19:29] dictate what I'm allowed to do. Amen. We
[1:19:31] all know that story of Johnny Crow that
[1:19:33] Brother Bram speaks about. Amen. That
[1:19:35] little crow that he was he was fastened
[1:19:38] and he could only only walk in one
[1:19:40] specific circle and he couldn't get away
[1:19:43] any further from that specific spot than
[1:19:45] the length of the string. Amen. And
[1:19:48] eventually when they untied that string,
[1:19:50] Johnny Crow was so used to being
[1:19:52] confined to that little area, he still
[1:19:55] was just walking around that same spot
[1:19:58] like many believers round and round and
[1:20:00] round and round the same spot, not going
[1:20:02] forward with the Lord. Why? We are
[1:20:05] scared to take him at his promises. We
[1:20:07] are scared to accept the word for
[1:20:08] ourselves. Amen. We are scared to to let
[1:20:12] go and let God have his wonderful way.
[1:20:15] Amen. Like that Johnny Crow. Amen. and
[1:20:17] just nud down, dumb down, and go round
[1:20:20] and round and round that same
[1:20:32] spot. God said in the word in Isaiah,
[1:20:35] "And it shall be at that day, sayaeth
[1:20:37] the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi,
[1:20:39] and shall call me no more Bali." Amen.
[1:20:42] We heard those things over the weekend.
[1:20:44] Amen. Is she
[1:20:47] husband? No more Lord. Amen.
[1:20:52] He wants us to come from being a slave.
[1:20:56] Amen. To have relationship. He wants us
[1:20:59] to come from being down. Amen. To be the
[1:21:02] M of the house. Amen. To be the one that
[1:21:05] the other slaves look up to now. Amen.
[1:21:08] There's a special position reserved for
[1:21:10] this bride. Like our our brother said
[1:21:11] over this weekend. Amen. Not a
[1:21:13] concubine. Amen. We are not just a
[1:21:16] virgin anymore. We now have experienced
[1:21:18] the husband and we have free access to
[1:21:20] him. And with those things, we have
[1:21:22] rights. Amen. We have a place. We are
[1:21:24] part of him now. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:21:28] nothing can take that away.
[1:21:33] Amen.
[1:21:37] Through the prophet, we've heard, I no
[1:21:39] longer call you church, but I call you
[1:21:41] bride. Amen.
[1:21:43] But we can say, "Well, I don't feel good
[1:21:45] enough for him." Amen. And he's going to
[1:21:48] look at all my mistakes and he's going
[1:21:50] to this and you know, I don't know how
[1:21:52] to relate to him as husband.
[1:21:56] Amen. Just get the revelation.
[1:22:00] Hallelujah. Brothers and sisters, it
[1:22:02] comes automatically
[1:22:05] because you are built for it. Amen. Just
[1:22:08] like that little baby is built for for
[1:22:11] coming out of the womb and being
[1:22:13] expressed. Amen. Like I said, cross that
[1:22:16] bridge. Amen. And being expressed into
[1:22:19] much more than just the dumbed down
[1:22:21] potential by the reality of a human
[1:22:24] being. And in our case, a reality of a
[1:22:27] son and daughter of God.
[1:22:30] I wonder if we can also just quickly
[1:22:31] turn to Exodus 21.
[1:22:35] It's the same story with just a little
[1:22:36] bit more detail in
[1:22:40] it. Exodus 21 from verse two. If thou
[1:22:44] buy an Hebrew servant, six years he
[1:22:47] shall serve, and in the seventh he shall
[1:22:49] go out free for nothing. If he came in
[1:22:52] by himself, he shall go out by himself.
[1:22:54] If he were married, then his wife shall
[1:22:56] go out with him. If his master have
[1:22:59] given him a wife, and she have borne him
[1:23:01] sons or daughters, the wife and her
[1:23:03] children shall be her masters, and he
[1:23:05] shall go out by himself. And if the
[1:23:08] servant shall plainly say, I love my
[1:23:11] master, my wife, and my children. I will
[1:23:14] not go out free. Then his master shall
[1:23:16] bring him unto the judges. He shall also
[1:23:18] bring him to the door, unto the
[1:23:20] doorpost, and his master shall bore his
[1:23:22] ear through with an all, and he shall
[1:23:24] serve him forever.
[1:23:27] What happened in in this write up? What
[1:23:29] happens is this person got
[1:23:33] gains while in
[1:23:37] slavery. This guy's got a wife, has got
[1:23:41] kids that's now entangled in the slavery
[1:23:45] and is now being pulled into between the
[1:23:48] gains and freedom.
[1:23:52] Amen. Just like we are, every one of us
[1:23:56] when we make this decision, we have that
[1:23:58] exact same thing. Amen. In so many
[1:24:02] different ways. Like that rich young
[1:24:03] ruler, he had so much invested. Amen. He
[1:24:07] wanted this and that. And it was a
[1:24:10] one-way street. It was this or that.
[1:24:13] Amen. God or mammon. Amen. He he
[1:24:17] couldn't take both of them. I mean the
[1:24:19] the scripture even speaks about how um
[1:24:21] those who you know we we we have to let
[1:24:24] let our husbands and wives and family
[1:24:26] and fathers and mothers and everything
[1:24:28] stay behind for this prize. Amen. This
[1:24:32] pill of pill of great price. Now of
[1:24:34] course what I'm saying is not you know
[1:24:35] leave your husbands and leave your wives
[1:24:37] and that kind of thing. What I'm saying
[1:24:38] is my brother and sister I've seen so
[1:24:41] many people who does not want to go
[1:24:43] forward with the Lord because they don't
[1:24:45] want to do it with husband or with with
[1:24:47] wife. Amen. Or struggles with the thing
[1:24:50] that if if I go forward with this
[1:24:52] message, it means that I'm saying that m
[1:24:55] mom and dad wasn't right. Amen. And how
[1:24:58] can I then basically categorize them as
[1:25:00] being wrong. So now I'm not going
[1:25:02] forward. Amen. That's not God's way.
[1:25:06] Amen. God's approach is he knows. He's
[1:25:10] in control. Amen. And and by your life,
[1:25:14] if your life gets changed, you might
[1:25:16] impact their lives. Amen. Because once
[1:25:20] you become a disciple, mom and dad can
[1:25:22] become disciples too through your life.
[1:25:24] Amen. Because you can also live the
[1:25:28] token back for mom and mom and dad.
[1:25:30] Amen. Because once you become Jesus
[1:25:33] Christ on display, they going to they're
[1:25:36] going to want to lick the salt lick.
[1:25:38] Amen. As we become more salty. Amen. Mom
[1:25:41] and daddy is going to want to lick that
[1:25:43] salt lick because they're going to
[1:25:45] experience from you what you experienced
[1:25:48] when you first came in contact with the
[1:25:50] word. Amen. And God knows whether they
[1:25:53] predestinated or
[1:25:55] not. And with human emotions, my brother
[1:25:58] and sister, obviously we're sad that mom
[1:26:00] and dad, you know, may not be
[1:26:02] predestinated. Amen. But the reality is
[1:26:05] in this bride, there's the power. Amen.
[1:26:08] that the things they did for you raising
[1:26:11] you and the things they did for us, my
[1:26:12] brother and sister, they can get life at
[1:26:15] the white throne for those things. Amen.
[1:26:18] So even then, my brother and sister,
[1:26:20] it's worth the while to take God first
[1:26:22] because no matter what, he's got it all
[1:26:25] in control. Amen. We don't have to break
[1:26:28] our minds and figure it out first. Amen.
[1:26:31] Can you imagine this little baby? He's
[1:26:33] in this womb now. Amen. And he's
[1:26:34] thinking, "Shall I or shalln't I?" Amen.
[1:26:38] Will I or won't I? Amen. Is it safe to
[1:26:41] go or not? Let me check. Can I, you
[1:26:44] know, are there multiple horses I could
[1:26:46] back on this one? Amen. Can I make sure
[1:26:49] that that whichever way it goes that No.
[1:26:53] Amen. It's total submission.
[1:26:56] Amen. And the same way with the son and
[1:26:59] daughter of
[1:27:00] God. This is the day of jubilee. Amen.
[1:27:04] This is that day. For 2,000 years, the
[1:27:07] church was bound by false teachings and
[1:27:09] things. Amen. This bride brider went
[1:27:12] down to a stump. Amen. But God has
[1:27:16] restored. Amen. God has restored
[1:27:20] completely. That same life that's on
[1:27:22] display now in this bride is the same
[1:27:25] Jesus Christ that went into the ground
[1:27:26] in the first place. Amen. And that life
[1:27:30] is now on display, my brother and
[1:27:32] sister, to bring a jubilee now for this
[1:27:35] bride. Amen. Like our brother said,
[1:27:37] coming completely now into the bride
[1:27:39] age, being lift away.
[1:27:45] God is inviting
[1:27:46] us as
[1:27:49] individuals to come out of Leodysia.
[1:27:53] Amen. We are not any longer part of
[1:27:57] that. Amen. As God gives us personally
[1:28:01] that rebirth, as God personally works
[1:28:04] with us, my brother and sister, you are
[1:28:06] you are given all the potentials and all
[1:28:09] the life and everything you need to fly
[1:28:13] high in the bride age. Amen. While this
[1:28:18] world is still timewise caught in
[1:28:19] Leodia, my brother and sisters, you
[1:28:22] don't have to be anymore. You can cross
[1:28:25] that bridge. Amen. You can you we are
[1:28:29] eagles. Amen. We're not stuck in manage
[1:28:31] thinking anymore. We're not stuck into
[1:28:34] intellectual conceptions of God anymore.
[1:28:36] We can now soar in heavens. Amen. We can
[1:28:40] let this word lift us. My brother and
[1:28:42] sister. I want to say this word is the
[1:28:45] best thing that could ever happen to any
[1:28:47] human being.
[1:28:49] Amen. But this word left on the rack,
[1:28:52] this word not eaten, this word not apply
[1:28:54] to daily life, my brother and sister, is
[1:28:56] useless
[1:28:57] to you.
[1:29:00] Amen. But when we eat this word, when we
[1:29:02] become this word, when this word is the
[1:29:04] impetus behind us, this word is the life
[1:29:07] behind us, my brother and sister. This
[1:29:09] word is the eagle anointing in this day.
[1:29:13] Amen. The seven spirits before the
[1:29:15] Lord's throne. In every time, God
[1:29:18] expresses himself in a different way.
[1:29:20] And the expression in this time, my
[1:29:22] brother and sister, is the fullness.
[1:29:26] Hallelujah. That Pentecostal age was
[1:29:28] just under the under that man anointing
[1:29:31] still. Amen. Isuza Street was still
[1:29:34] under the man anointing. Amen. The eagle
[1:29:36] anointing came when the word fully broke
[1:29:39] open. Amen. When the seals were broken.
[1:29:42] Amen. And God fully could express
[1:29:44] himself now as the person of the word to
[1:29:47] us.
[1:29:50] We are now living.
[1:29:52] And you know these are concepts that we
[1:29:54] can just they can become cliches and
[1:29:57] things my brother and sister. We are
[1:29:58] living in the throngs of the rapture.
[1:30:03] We are the rapture.
[1:30:06] Amen. Because I've heard that a million
[1:30:09] times. You know, I've heard that over
[1:30:10] the pullpit so many times. It needs to
[1:30:12] become reality to you my brother and
[1:30:14] sister. Amen. We have received the shout
[1:30:19] and we should by the rebirth by the work
[1:30:22] that God does in you personally by your
[1:30:25] growth in Jesus Christ and your
[1:30:27] relationship with him become the voice.
[1:30:31] Amen. So that you are ready for that
[1:30:33] body change my brother and sister. Amen.
[1:30:36] And I'm not saying these things from a
[1:30:38] pressure. Come on guys. Let's all work
[1:30:40] this thing up. Amen. I'm saying submit
[1:30:43] to the word and the word will do it.
[1:30:46] Because the word is the only thing
[1:30:47] that's got power in it to do it.
[1:30:51] Hallelujah. Brother Bram speaks about
[1:30:52] the false freedom. Amen. There was a
[1:30:55] false freedom given to in Constantine's
[1:30:58] time. Amen. To the Christians. They were
[1:31:03] saying, "We won't persecute you anymore.
[1:31:06] Come on. let's just, you know, let's
[1:31:08] just all be friends
[1:31:10] and Amen. But that's a false kind of
[1:31:13] freedom because the it's the same kind
[1:31:17] of freedom that the serpent offered Eve.
[1:31:21] Amen. Which is a man-made version of
[1:31:25] God's real freedom.
[1:31:27] Because freedom is only inside the word.
[1:31:32] Amen. And it's the same same same
[1:31:34] freedom that Satan offered Jesus Christ
[1:31:37] when he came in the temptations. Amen.
[1:31:40] The kind of freedom which was, hey, just
[1:31:43] fall down and worship me.
[1:31:46] Amen. And he offered Jesus a
[1:31:49] shortcut which would cut us out. Amen.
[1:31:53] Because he wouldn't pay the price and
[1:31:54] and we wouldn't be there. And of course,
[1:31:57] from a predestinated perspective, that
[1:31:58] could never happen. Amen. But Jesus
[1:32:01] Christ was his match over and over. Like
[1:32:04] brother Bram says, this time he he hit
[1:32:06] one with a with a million volts. Amen.
[1:32:10] And when that stinger went in, Amen. his
[1:32:12] stinger was pulled out that time.
[1:32:15] Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] That same freedom Satan is still
[1:32:20] offering today, which is a freedom which
[1:32:23] is false. Amen. It's a false birth. It's
[1:32:27] a still birth that's being offered.
[1:32:29] Brother Brandon makes a statement in the
[1:32:32] Thotyron church age. He says, "Now why
[1:32:34] does God God call these churches his
[1:32:36] churches even though they are the false
[1:32:38] vine?" Amen. Why does God call general
[1:32:42] Christian churches his churches even
[1:32:44] though they are the false vine? The
[1:32:46] truth of the matter is that they are
[1:32:48] Christians, but they are not Christians
[1:32:50] of the spirit, capital S. They are
[1:32:52] Christians of the flesh. They are
[1:32:54] bearing the name in vain. Exactly what
[1:32:57] our brothers been speaking of. Mark 7:7,
[1:33:00] "How be it in vain do they worship me,
[1:33:02] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:33:04] of men, but indeed they are Christians,
[1:33:06] for what else could they be? A mahabhan
[1:33:09] is a mahabedan. That's that's his
[1:33:11] religion. No matter how he lives it
[1:33:13] because he subscribes in theory to what
[1:33:15] the Quran teaches." In the same way, a
[1:33:18] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[1:33:19] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[1:33:21] son of God, born of a virgin, was
[1:33:24] crucified and died and rose again. that
[1:33:26] he's a savior of mankind etc. In fact,
[1:33:29] in the Leodysia church age, there will
[1:33:31] be those who call themselves Christians
[1:33:33] because they subscribe to the fine
[1:33:34] qualities of Jesus while reserving to
[1:33:37] themselves the right to deny his deity.
[1:33:40] Christian science have done that already
[1:33:42] as well as the multitude who preach a
[1:33:44] social gospel. He is a nominal Christian
[1:33:46] and belongs to church but is not a true
[1:33:49] or spiritual believer. That kind of a
[1:33:51] believer is one who has been baptized
[1:33:53] into the body of Christ and is a member
[1:33:56] of him. But nonetheless, it it is in
[1:33:59] God's order that the tears grow up with
[1:34:01] the wheat and they are not to be
[1:34:03] uprooted. That's the commandment of God.
[1:34:05] The day for binding and burning is
[1:34:07] coming, but not yet. Amen. In our
[1:34:10] opening scripture, my brother and
[1:34:12] sister, Jesus was speaking to the
[1:34:15] Pharisees. And they were presenting a
[1:34:17] man-made intellectual version of
[1:34:19] freedom.
[1:34:21] And Jesus was saying, "The ones who the
[1:34:24] son of man has set free." Amen. The one
[1:34:27] who he has set free is free indeed.
[1:34:30] Freedom has only got one source and that
[1:34:34] is Zoe. God's own life. God's own life
[1:34:38] is the only source of freedom. And my
[1:34:41] brother and sister, I want to say very
[1:34:42] bluntly and sorry if that steps on your
[1:34:44] toes. You can be a one-man denomination.
[1:34:48] Amen. You can have you can say this is
[1:34:51] what I believe and nothing else. Amen.
[1:34:54] And everyone else is wrong and everyone
[1:34:56] else is not this and everyone else is
[1:34:58] not that. Amen. We can be a one-man
[1:35:01] denomination in just like in the in the
[1:35:05] in the um association of Christians just
[1:35:08] what we read just now. You can have
[1:35:10] people who are not really Christians.
[1:35:12] You can have people with a message label
[1:35:15] who are not really message. Amen. Who's
[1:35:17] a one-man denomination inside the
[1:35:19] message.
[1:35:21] Hallelujah.
[1:35:23] Now, we've spoken about the birth and
[1:35:25] I've already done it. But I just want to
[1:35:26] clearly now link this example to the new
[1:35:30] birth because really that's where I want
[1:35:32] to get to today. Amen. We can be afraid
[1:35:36] of the new birth
[1:35:38] experience because what's on the other
[1:35:41] side of the new birth? Amen. And of
[1:35:43] course, I'm saying this from the
[1:35:45] perspective of somebody that I I believe
[1:35:47] I have the rebirth. Amen. But I'm
[1:35:49] preaching it from the perspective that
[1:35:51] maybe there's some of us who who don't.
[1:35:53] Amen. And it might be that you have a
[1:35:56] major challenge thinking what will it be
[1:35:59] like? What will I have to sacrifice?
[1:36:02] What will change in my life? Do I have
[1:36:04] to let go of this? Do I have to let go
[1:36:06] of that? All those kind of things. Amen.
[1:36:08] We can be afraid of the
[1:36:10] rebirth when we are still caught in
[1:36:14] prison.
[1:36:16] But when we are set free, my brother and
[1:36:17] sister, you would never want to go back
[1:36:20] just like that baby. Amen. because it's
[1:36:22] a freedom that you have never
[1:36:24] experienced if you've never been there.
[1:36:26] Amen. And I want to say it's actually
[1:36:28] impossible for somebody with a rebirth
[1:36:30] and and don't get me wrong, don't get
[1:36:32] the wrong idea. Amen. But it's
[1:36:34] impossible for somebody with a rebirth
[1:36:35] to intellectually explain to you. Amen.
[1:36:39] What it's like, what it is. Give it in a
[1:36:42] nutshell. Give it in a little recipe. Do
[1:36:44] ABC. Tick these boxes and you got it.
[1:36:47] Amen. It's not about that, my brother
[1:36:49] and sister. It's about Jesus Christ
[1:36:52] doing it himself in our lives by his own
[1:36:55] will.
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:57] Yes, sir.
[1:37:00] We heard this weekend already about the
[1:37:01] attributes of God. And I'm just going to
[1:37:03] pick that up. In God's minds, in God's
[1:37:06] mind, before time began, there were
[1:37:09] attributes in there.
[1:37:11] There were attributes, Father, Son, Holy
[1:37:13] Ghost. There were the redemptive
[1:37:16] attributes of God. Amen.
[1:37:18] provider, savior, healer, all those kind
[1:37:21] of
[1:37:22] things. But attributing God was also
[1:37:25] Elray Robertson
[1:37:28] and your name. Amen. If you believe
[1:37:30] you've been there. Each one of us, my
[1:37:33] brother and sister, if we if we ever
[1:37:35] have part of Zoe, we were there in God's
[1:37:38] mind. That attribute of us was in God.
[1:37:41] Amen. And that attribute just as much as
[1:37:45] God desires if we can even put those
[1:37:48] kind of human attributes to God, God
[1:37:52] desires to express his fatherhood and
[1:37:55] his sunship and his healer uh attribute
[1:37:59] and all those kind of things. Just as
[1:38:01] much as that, God desires to express
[1:38:04] you.
[1:38:06] God desires for that birth to take
[1:38:08] place. God desires for that expression
[1:38:13] that was there in his mind to come to
[1:38:16] fruition to bring forth.
[1:38:19] God desires, I'll put it this way. God
[1:38:22] desires for the vision that he had of
[1:38:25] you when he was Elohim, dwelling with
[1:38:27] his own thoughts to become
[1:38:30] manifestation. That's right. So that he
[1:38:32] can have fellowship with his attributes.
[1:38:36] So that God can have relationship with
[1:38:39] attributes.
[1:38:43] Excuse me. So that self-existing one
[1:38:46] dwelt there with his thoughts. The next
[1:38:47] thing that happened was in the
[1:38:50] beginning. And that in the beginning,
[1:38:52] the first time that we could pinpoint
[1:38:54] something that has changed so that we
[1:38:56] could measure time from there was God
[1:38:58] expressed it in word form or logos form.
[1:39:02] Amen. And don't let the terminology trip
[1:39:04] you up. We can get so hung on on hung up
[1:39:06] on terminology. Amen. Logos is God's
[1:39:10] word expression. Amen. When God spoke
[1:39:13] his attributes the first time. Amen. I
[1:39:15] always say, and this is just me. I mean,
[1:39:17] don't take it as anything more than just
[1:39:18] me. But what a big bang. Amen. When God
[1:39:21] expressed I wanted to say God was like a
[1:39:24] big balloon that blew up and blew up and
[1:39:26] blew up and at some point he couldn't
[1:39:28] contain it anymore. He needed to express
[1:39:30] all those thoughts now and he expressed
[1:39:32] those thoughts. And when he expressed
[1:39:34] those thoughts, logos came forth. Word
[1:39:37] came forth. He said it. And part of what
[1:39:41] he said there, my brother and sister,
[1:39:42] the potentials of you and I were there.
[1:39:45] Part of it. Amen. And I believe
[1:39:48] personally that our theophonies were
[1:39:50] right there in that word because our
[1:39:53] theophonies are just our word part just
[1:39:56] like the logos is the completion of
[1:39:58] God's word part God's word expression
[1:40:01] the expression of all the attributes
[1:40:03] that were in God and your little
[1:40:06] expression of was of what was in God in
[1:40:09] word form is your theophony and that was
[1:40:13] expressed there. Amen. We read in John
[1:40:16] 1, how the word or the logos was made
[1:40:19] flesh. The God
[1:40:22] part came to earth, took on flesh and
[1:40:27] walked the streets of Galilee in the
[1:40:29] form of Jesus Christ, the Galilean.
[1:40:34] Amen. Brother Ram shows us that Jesus
[1:40:36] did not bypass his theophony. And he and
[1:40:39] he says in one place he said he says
[1:40:41] Jesus's mind could go back to those
[1:40:44] things. Amen. But we bypassed our
[1:40:47] theophies.
[1:40:51] And what brother Brandham says what
[1:40:53] happened with us in our case. I hope
[1:40:54] this is not this is not too deep. It's
[1:40:57] really really simple. Amen. It's so
[1:41:00] simple but it's soly spectacularly
[1:41:03] special when you take that personally my
[1:41:06] brother and sister. And this is the
[1:41:08] cleanser for me. The thought that was in
[1:41:11] God's mind. Amen. He said we bypassed
[1:41:13] our word expression. He took the thought
[1:41:17] or the seed or the potential or whatever
[1:41:20] you want to call it. Amen. The attribute
[1:41:23] of you with your name on he put it on
[1:41:26] earth inside your soul. And that
[1:41:29] attribute is now walking around. And in
[1:41:33] some cases, those attributes sit in
[1:41:36] souls that hasn't been regenerated,
[1:41:38] hasn't been reborn yet.
[1:41:41] And in other cases, by the Lord's grace,
[1:41:43] they are in souls that have been reborn
[1:41:45] and are now expressing the life that was
[1:41:48] in that attribute. And that's God's
[1:41:50] whole point is to get that attribute
[1:41:52] just from his thought dumbed down in
[1:41:55] that prison. Amen. To bring it forward.
[1:41:58] Amen. To express his life on earth.
[1:42:01] Amen. That's why you're here. Amen.
[1:42:04] That's why we are here. Our soul with
[1:42:07] the attribute of God in my brother and
[1:42:09] sister is our eternal part. And it's
[1:42:12] that part that God brought here. And
[1:42:14] that's the whole reason we are here on
[1:42:16] earth.
[1:42:18] And you know what we often do? We spend
[1:42:22] all our effort on the spirit and the
[1:42:24] flesh.
[1:42:28] And really the spirit and the flesh is
[1:42:32] just a little prison
[1:42:35] for that soul so that God could do
[1:42:39] something special with that attribute
[1:42:41] and the soul so that he could bring her
[1:42:43] to something that he's seen in his
[1:42:45] vision before the foundation of the
[1:42:47] world. Amen. And we struggle with this
[1:42:50] flesh and we struggle with the spirit
[1:42:52] and we get sick and we get down and we
[1:42:54] get complexes and we get all those
[1:42:56] things. Amen. Hallelujah. And God is
[1:43:00] trying to show us my brother and sister.
[1:43:02] There is potentials in you. There's
[1:43:06] nothing that can stop that little seed
[1:43:09] from growing when God eventually pours
[1:43:12] the water of the Holy Spirit on it.
[1:43:14] Amen. And I want to say that as an
[1:43:17] encouragement. I know people struggle.
[1:43:19] Do I have the Holy Ghost? Amen. Do I
[1:43:22] have the rebirth? I want to say we
[1:43:25] should not worry about whether we have
[1:43:26] the the the Holy Ghost in the spirit
[1:43:29] realm.
[1:43:32] The first and foremost thing is to get
[1:43:35] the rebirth.
[1:43:38] But then like our brother said, you can
[1:43:41] have the rebirth in the soul
[1:43:44] now, but then your spirit can be so
[1:43:46] cluttered up with complexes and with all
[1:43:49] those things that God cannot manifest
[1:43:52] through to the spirit
[1:43:54] and then again from there to the to the
[1:43:56] body. Amen. But first and foremost, my
[1:44:01] brother and sister, we need that
[1:44:02] rebirth. We need that more than anything
[1:44:05] else. And that rebirth is Jesus Christ
[1:44:09] in person on the throne of your heart or
[1:44:13] soul, however you want to put it. Amen.
[1:44:17] But then, my brother and sister, this
[1:44:19] bride has also got all the other
[1:44:22] potentials of God available to us. Amen.
[1:44:25] He wants to come and clean up your
[1:44:27] spirit. God wants to be able to now re
[1:44:30] our spirit. Amen. And there's that that
[1:44:32] scripture, I can't remember it right
[1:44:34] now, but speaking about the man who
[1:44:36] reigns his own spirit and those kind of
[1:44:37] things. Amen. God wants to the real you
[1:44:40] now. Amen. Live to express God in your
[1:44:46] spirit realm and from there again to
[1:44:48] your flesh realm.
[1:44:51] Hallelujah. I've lost my place, but
[1:44:52] praise the Lord. I'm enjoying myself.
[1:44:55] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:02] So that rewinds a little bit. And the
[1:45:04] one that left
[1:45:05] home only come to the earth to serve his
[1:45:10] purpose. He's speaking about you and me
[1:45:12] now. He's not speaking of the theophony
[1:45:14] there. I believe personally because we
[1:45:17] have bypassed our theophony. So I
[1:45:20] believe what he says there is the
[1:45:22] attribute only come to the earth to
[1:45:25] serve his purpose. Is that right? All
[1:45:26] right. Then after it's finished, it's
[1:45:29] brought back in a glorified state. It's
[1:45:32] matured and brought back again. God
[1:45:35] sends the attribute here, my brother and
[1:45:38] sister, to be matured.
[1:45:40] And that attribute can only be matured
[1:45:43] in one way. And that one way is not a
[1:45:47] lot of fun. We heard about it.
[1:45:49] Resistance training.
[1:45:52] Amen. Resistance training through
[1:45:55] trials. I'll come back to that. I just
[1:45:57] want to leave that there for a
[1:45:59] moment. Brother Rams preaches that that
[1:46:02] message um power of transformation.
[1:46:05] Amen. The power of that seed to bring
[1:46:10] forth of itself. Amen. And the
[1:46:13] transformation is happening when the
[1:46:15] Holy Ghost rains water on that seed.
[1:46:19] Amen. And really, it's the word in
[1:46:21] everything. And I so enjoy that when you
[1:46:23] read it. It can confuse you totally if
[1:46:26] you let it. Amen. Because it's the word
[1:46:28] that's you read the word through your
[1:46:32] senses. But the word is also the Holy
[1:46:35] Spirit that anoints you. And the
[1:46:37] attribute is the potential word that's
[1:46:39] in you. And the theophony is the word
[1:46:42] that's not in you. I mean, it's the word
[1:46:45] is just everywhere. I mean, God does
[1:46:48] everything through the word. The point
[1:46:50] is he's trying to express just like the
[1:46:53] expression of God is love. The
[1:46:55] expression of God is his word. It's the
[1:46:58] selfs same thing my brother and sister.
[1:47:00] Amen. And it's that word that does the
[1:47:02] complete work in us. Amen. It's the word
[1:47:06] that brings us to a rebirth. If I say it
[1:47:08] in another way, it's love that brings us
[1:47:10] to a rebirth. It's a desire for
[1:47:13] fellowship and a desire for relationship
[1:47:15] that brings us to the rebirth. And the
[1:47:18] desire, my brother and sister, is more
[1:47:19] so on God's part than on your part.
[1:47:22] Amen. God desires more to re to relate
[1:47:25] to you in that relationship than we do
[1:47:28] to relate to him. Amen. Why? God had
[1:47:31] that absolute desire to express himself
[1:47:33] as a healer. Had the desire to express
[1:47:36] himself as a savior. He had the desire
[1:47:38] to express himself as bridegroom. Amen.
[1:47:42] is the desire for you to come forth, my
[1:47:45] brother and sister, so that his word
[1:47:47] where he says, "I will have a bride and
[1:47:51] she will be spotless."
[1:47:54] So that his word will come forward by
[1:47:57] his doing completely by his doing that
[1:48:01] life in the seed being transformed into
[1:48:03] a reflection of the original seed that
[1:48:06] came back on that came into the ground.
[1:48:09] Hallelujah. And once the seed is
[1:48:12] expressed, I mean, once you have a whole
[1:48:14] tree of apples, why on earth do that
[1:48:16] does that whole tree want to go back
[1:48:18] into that original seed again? The same
[1:48:20] principle with the birth. That's the
[1:48:23] purpose of the seed is to express.
[1:48:27] That's the purpose of God's attribute
[1:48:29] into you is to mature
[1:48:32] and come back to God again in matured
[1:48:34] form.
[1:48:37] Look at this beautiful way in which
[1:48:38] brother Brandham says this here. Be
[1:48:40] careful here and see this. It's not the
[1:48:42] person that comes predestinated
[1:48:44] eternally from God. It's the word or
[1:48:47] seed. That is it way back in there. Too
[1:48:51] far back for the human mind to grasp the
[1:48:53] eternal God with eternal thoughts uh
[1:48:55] thought and decreed. Jacob have I loved
[1:48:58] but Esau have I hated. He can think is
[1:49:01] it that simple? Did God sit there aons
[1:49:05] and aons and aons of time ago? Amen. And
[1:49:09] think, Jacob have I loved, Esau have I
[1:49:11] hated. Yes. Amen. And read your name in
[1:49:16] there, my brother and sister. And don't
[1:49:18] go the pessimistic route and I'll
[1:49:21] probably just be an old Esau. Amen.
[1:49:24] That's not the point. The point is you
[1:49:27] cannot do it. Yes, you are dirty. Yes,
[1:49:30] you are vile. Yes, you are weak. Yes,
[1:49:33] you're never good enough for God in
[1:49:35] yourself. Amen. But the seed is in
[1:49:38] there. And it's not about this flesh.
[1:49:41] It's not even about your spirit. It's
[1:49:43] about God on the inside of your soul.
[1:49:46] And he wants to express and he's going
[1:49:48] to express whether you like it or not.
[1:49:51] Amen. Hallelujah. And neither was born
[1:49:54] and neither had had done good or evil.
[1:49:57] See, it was the thought and then that
[1:49:59] thought became expressed and God brought
[1:50:01] back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed.
[1:50:05] There was potentials in Jacob. Like
[1:50:07] brother Ram says about that woman at the
[1:50:09] well and the priest. Amen. The one had
[1:50:12] seed, the other one had not. The one
[1:50:14] looked vile on the outside. She was in
[1:50:16] sin. She was in absolutely you she was
[1:50:19] she was a prostitute. And then you put
[1:50:21] the priest next to and he looked so good
[1:50:23] and you would say, "Well, God can work
[1:50:25] with this one." Amen.
[1:50:27] God looked at the seed only.
[1:50:31] She had God inside in potential form.
[1:50:35] And when that the word came across her
[1:50:38] path, she said, "I perceive that you're
[1:50:41] a prophet." Hallelujah.
[1:50:45] See, it was the thought and then that
[1:50:46] thought became expressed and God brought
[1:50:48] back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed.
[1:50:50] Jacob alone had the seed. That's why he
[1:50:52] had respect to the birthright and
[1:50:54] covenant of God. If you are true seed,
[1:50:57] you will hear that word. The spirit will
[1:50:59] baptize you into the body of Christ,
[1:51:02] filling you and empowering you, and you
[1:51:04] will receive the word for your day and
[1:51:06] age. Did you read anything about
[1:51:08] yourself there? You will do this or
[1:51:11] that. No, he will do it in you. Amen.
[1:51:15] Hallelujah.
[1:51:17] See how clear the true evidence becomes
[1:51:19] when the word is revealed to you again.
[1:51:21] No, Jesus was the royal seed. He lived
[1:51:23] in a human body. When the spirit called
[1:51:26] to him, the word manifested thought.
[1:51:29] Hallelujah. I love how the prophet sees
[1:51:31] things. I love it. Amen. And we can
[1:51:33] confuse ourselves so much, but it's so
[1:51:35] simple. When the spirit called to I want
[1:51:38] to say Jesus, who was the word
[1:51:41] manifested thought, he went to the
[1:51:43] Jordan and was there baptized in water.
[1:51:47] Why? The word in him did what the word
[1:51:50] expected. Amen. In the Old Testament,
[1:51:53] there was the type lamb had washed
[1:51:56] before it's being offered, being
[1:51:58] presented. Jesus Christ stepped into the
[1:52:01] thoughts of God and the word of God and
[1:52:03] he lived it. Amen. So, he went to that
[1:52:06] Jordan and he got baptized and he went
[1:52:08] through that process. Why? because
[1:52:10] that's how the type patterned out in
[1:52:12] heaven and that's how his life typed it
[1:52:14] afterwards.
[1:52:17] Amen. He went to Jordan and was there
[1:52:18] baptized in water. Upon obeying the
[1:52:20] word, the Holy Spirit came upon him and
[1:52:22] the voice said, "This is my beloved son.
[1:52:24] Hear ye him." The voice did not say,
[1:52:26] "This has become my son. Jesus was the
[1:52:30] son. The Holy Ghost positioned him as
[1:52:32] that son before them all." Then having
[1:52:35] been fold thus and the same pattern
[1:52:37] holds at Pentecost and ever after what
[1:52:41] you are already sons. You are already
[1:52:44] daughters. He went in demonstrated power
[1:52:47] received the full revelation of God and
[1:52:50] from God for that day just like you will
[1:52:52] receive the full revelation of God and
[1:52:55] from God for this day. Amen.
[1:53:02] I'll put it in this way and I've kind of
[1:53:03] said it already but our
[1:53:06] attributes are when we are born here on
[1:53:09] this
[1:53:11] earth with this cross between
[1:53:15] serpent messed up hybrid
[1:53:18] bodies that potentials of God that
[1:53:20] attribute of God is in prison in this
[1:53:24] body. That's right.
[1:53:27] It was clouded over by human flesh,
[1:53:32] by human thinking,
[1:53:34] by human complexes, by human memories,
[1:53:36] by things that got that hurt us, by all
[1:53:39] those things in our spirit.
[1:53:41] Amen. And that needs to be set
[1:53:47] free. And the rebirth is the process by
[1:53:50] which that seed starts growing. Where
[1:53:53] that seed seed is now
[1:53:56] by the Holy Ghost and starts growing and
[1:53:59] come
[1:54:00] forward starts that daily overcoming.
[1:54:05] That's the point my brother and sister
[1:54:07] like brother Bram speak shows us um I
[1:54:10] think it's in future home where he
[1:54:11] speaks about how up to that
[1:54:14] point that serpent nature is in the soul
[1:54:18] but when the rebirth takes place that
[1:54:20] serpent nature is taken out and the dove
[1:54:22] nature is put in we get that nature
[1:54:25] chain amen does it mean that from that
[1:54:27] first moment now everything is honky
[1:54:29] dory and that we're just going to do
[1:54:31] things life is going to be easy and
[1:54:33] we're just going can overcome
[1:54:34] everything. No, that just sets us in
[1:54:38] battle array. Amen. Because what's
[1:54:42] happening is we just crossing
[1:54:45] Jordan. Now there's all these
[1:54:47] strongholds to go and face now. Amen.
[1:54:50] There's the fight really starting.
[1:54:55] But sinners lost a grip of control
[1:54:58] because now suddenly God is on the
[1:55:01] throne.
[1:55:03] God is the ultimate father. I said I'll
[1:55:06] come back to this. I'll I'll do that
[1:55:08] now. God teaches us through trials and
[1:55:11] there's no other way than teaching us
[1:55:14] through resistance training so that he
[1:55:16] can train and make strong our faith
[1:55:18] muscles.
[1:55:22] And that's part of becoming mature in
[1:55:25] Christ. God never will take all the
[1:55:28] trials away because then we learn
[1:55:29] nothing. Amen. And I said that in church
[1:55:32] recently, you know, sometimes you have
[1:55:35] visitors with little kids and and mom
[1:55:40] and dad just go around and, you know,
[1:55:42] put all the vases and things on rack so
[1:55:44] the kids can't touch
[1:55:47] it. Why are you
[1:55:49] [Laughter]
[1:55:52] laughing? What happens is those kids
[1:55:55] never learn anything. Amen. Because the
[1:55:58] reality is if mom and dad doesn't deal
[1:56:00] with a situation, they learn nothing.
[1:56:02] Amen. And all we do sometimes there's
[1:56:06] there's parents that do that until kids
[1:56:08] are 40, 50, 60 years old and mom and dad
[1:56:10] is still intervening. Police has got
[1:56:12] them again and dad will go in and sweet
[1:56:15] talk and try and Amen. We have to learn.
[1:56:19] We have to grow. We have to we have to
[1:56:22] find
[1:56:24] opportunities to teach our children. And
[1:56:26] God does the same thing, my brother and
[1:56:28] sister. God allows us. God does not jump
[1:56:32] as soon as we're going to get to trial,
[1:56:33] jump in and keep the trial away from us.
[1:56:36] That's not his way.
[1:56:38] Amen. God allows a trial that you can
[1:56:41] stand and you you you grow a little
[1:56:45] stronger
[1:56:46] and then God allows another trial. Amen.
[1:56:49] And then he and he he as you grow
[1:56:52] stronger, he will allow stronger and
[1:56:54] stronger trials to come. That's how we
[1:56:56] get stronger. Amen. When you have a
[1:56:59] muscle man and he just, you know, keeps
[1:57:01] on practicing with a 20 kilogram, you
[1:57:03] know, weight, he's never never going to
[1:57:04] get anywhere.
[1:57:06] As he can do the 20 kilogram easy as
[1:57:09] he'd start with the next one and the
[1:57:11] next one. And that's what God does. Why?
[1:57:13] He's a good father. He knows it's good
[1:57:15] for us. And he knows, my brother and
[1:57:18] sister, in fact, God and that's the
[1:57:20] awesome thing. And that's the one of
[1:57:22] those things that we we kind of don't
[1:57:24] want to hear because it's not really fun
[1:57:26] when in practice. Amen. But God has a
[1:57:30] vision for
[1:57:31] you. When God was just Elohim dwelling
[1:57:34] alone with his thoughts, he had a vision
[1:57:37] what he wanted to achieve through your
[1:57:38] life.
[1:57:40] And God custom makes trials for us
[1:57:45] personally to achieve the expression
[1:57:48] that he had for you. Amen.
[1:57:51] Amen. And I never want the life of that
[1:57:53] prophet.
[1:57:56] Hard life. Amen.
[1:58:00] You know, brother Bram speaks about how
[1:58:02] people say, "Oh, I wish I had that
[1:58:03] gift." But they don't have any idea what
[1:58:06] trials come with that kind of gift.
[1:58:09] Amen.
[1:58:10] But my brother and sister, every member
[1:58:12] of the body of Christ, every attribute
[1:58:15] of Jesus Christ has a job, has a role,
[1:58:19] has a function in the body. And God is
[1:58:22] going to allow the exact trials to come
[1:58:25] across your path to make you what he
[1:58:28] wants you to be. And God does not waste
[1:58:31] pain. God allows pain to let you grow so
[1:58:36] that tomorrow you can help someone else
[1:58:38] or so that he can form you or so that he
[1:58:41] can let you learn obedience through the
[1:58:44] things you suffer. Amen. Our prophet was
[1:58:48] for me when I look at brother Brham's
[1:58:50] life you know you see so much of Jesus
[1:58:52] Christ in there. Amen. The reason why
[1:58:55] when brother Brandham came to the end of
[1:58:56] his ministry, when God said do this, he
[1:58:58] would do it absolutely unquestioningly
[1:59:01] was look at his life. Look at how God
[1:59:05] had trained him in a hard way humanly
[1:59:07] speaking. Amen. His wife died, his
[1:59:10] daughter died, and several of his family
[1:59:12] members died. All those things happened
[1:59:14] with him because of one simple mistake
[1:59:17] from our perspective. Amen. But God was
[1:59:19] teaching him when he went to South
[1:59:21] Africa. Amen. God taught him step by
[1:59:24] step. When I say something, I mean it.
[1:59:28] Amen. And God taught him obedience
[1:59:30] through the things he suffered.
[1:59:34] God doesn't just randomly let trials
[1:59:37] come. Amen. There's nothing random about
[1:59:40] a trial.
[1:59:42] Again, when you're in the middle of a
[1:59:43] trial, it kind of doesn't feel like
[1:59:45] that. Amen.
[1:59:47] But my brother and sister, God specially
[1:59:49] selected the exact trial necessary to
[1:59:52] achieve something in your life. Amen.
[1:59:55] Now, I know it's not even humanly
[1:59:57] practical to expect us to get excited
[1:59:59] when a trial comes. Amen. But if we had
[2:00:03] eternal vision, we would. Amen. Because
[2:00:07] ultimately all that we're going to take
[2:00:09] with us, brother Bram says, is
[2:00:10] character.
[2:00:12] And the the the way between that seed
[2:00:15] that was just potential in God's mind
[2:00:18] and the mature seed that comes
[2:00:21] out with character
[2:00:24] is trial.
[2:00:26] And ultimately, that's the only reason
[2:00:28] why you're here.
[2:00:31] To build character and serve God's
[2:00:33] purpose while you are here.
[2:00:36] And then of course God orchestrates it
[2:00:38] in a way that just totally blows our
[2:00:40] human minds. And that is in millions of
[2:00:43] lives he interact those people with one
[2:00:46] another to achieve in every one of those
[2:00:48] lives exactly what he wants. Amen. We
[2:00:52] can't I mean we can't even plot it on a
[2:00:55] computer if we have to. Amen. And God
[2:00:57] had it all planned beforehand.
[2:01:00] Hallelujah. So God sends those
[2:01:03] custommade
[2:01:05] trials. But look what God says. For I
[2:01:08] know the thoughts that I think toward
[2:01:10] you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace
[2:01:12] and not of evil to give you an expected
[2:01:15] end.
[2:01:20] Let's turn there together. Jeremiah 29.
[2:01:24] Yes, Jeremiah
[2:01:26] 29. We love to quote that scripture by
[2:01:29] itself. For I know the thoughts that I
[2:01:30] think toward you, sayeth the Lord.
[2:01:32] Thoughts of peace and not of evil.
[2:01:34] Hallelujah. Amen. You can say amen to
[2:01:37] that part. But now look at where the the
[2:01:40] Bible says that Jeremiah 29 and we'll
[2:01:42] start from verse
[2:01:44] 10. For thus sayaith the Lord that after
[2:01:47] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I
[2:01:49] will visit you. He's letting them go
[2:01:51] into Babylon. He's letting them go into
[2:01:54] major trial. Amen.
[2:01:58] I will visit you and perform my good
[2:02:00] word toward toward you in causing you to
[2:02:03] return to this place. Is God angry with
[2:02:05] him? God's got a purpose.
[2:02:09] For I know the thoughts that I think
[2:02:10] toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of
[2:02:12] peace and not of evil to give you an
[2:02:14] expected end. I need to send you there
[2:02:17] to achieve my end is what God is saying.
[2:02:21] Then shall you call upon me, and you
[2:02:23] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[2:02:24] hearken unto you, and you shall seek me
[2:02:26] and find me when you shall search for me
[2:02:28] with all your heart, and I will be found
[2:02:30] of you, sayeth the Lord, and I will turn
[2:02:32] away your captivity. Amen. Then they
[2:02:34] come to the expected end. But God knows
[2:02:37] the road to that expected end is trial.
[2:02:42] Hallelujah.
[2:02:43] It's getting quiet. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:50] God also knows something else very very
[2:02:55] important and that is that we are just
[2:02:57] like brother Bram says a cloud of dirt.
[2:03:00] Just very quickly run through this
[2:03:01] quote. Now we think we're something just
[2:03:03] remember what are we a clot of dirt
[2:03:05] that's all because dust thou art dust
[2:03:07] thou shalt return. So when you see this
[2:03:09] man walking down the street thinks he's
[2:03:11] somebody you know and got a lot of
[2:03:12] education and things remember it's a
[2:03:14] clot of Indiana dust. That's all. That
[2:03:17] woman that's all dressed up in shorts
[2:03:18] and smoking cigarettes and carry on down
[2:03:20] the street twisting like she owned the
[2:03:22] whole country. It's a clot of Indiana
[2:03:24] dust. That's the way it's turning back.
[2:03:26] So you're not even very much to begin
[2:03:27] with. See that's right. That's what you
[2:03:29] are. But that soul that's in there, see
[2:03:34] that soul is what God is working on.
[2:03:38] Amen. Back to what I said earlier. God
[2:03:40] is not so much concerned as we are about
[2:03:43] this thing.
[2:03:48] God is almighty. So, what's the body
[2:03:49] made of? A little calcium pot here some
[2:03:51] time ago down in Memphis, Tennessee. I
[2:03:53] like art and I was watching in the
[2:03:55] museum and so forth. The human body of a
[2:03:57] man weighing 150 lbs was worth 84 cents.
[2:04:00] There's enough whitewash in the body to
[2:04:02] sprinkle a hen's nest and oh, you know,
[2:04:04] just a few things like that. There's two
[2:04:06] boys standing there, one looking around
[2:04:08] at the other and said, "Well, John,
[2:04:09] we're not worth very much, are we?" But
[2:04:12] you'll put a $500 mink coat on that 84
[2:04:14] cents and walk down the street with your
[2:04:16] nose turned up like if it had rain it
[2:04:19] would drown you. And you belong to some
[2:04:21] big church and you take care of that 84
[2:04:23] cents and what is it? Nothing but a
[2:04:25] little handful of ashes and you'll stick
[2:04:27] anything in that soul which is worth
[2:04:29] 10,000 worlds. You don't think about
[2:04:32] that.
[2:04:34] That soul is what Jesus Christ died for.
[2:04:36] Amen.
[2:04:39] That soul is worth 10,000 WS that God
[2:04:42] will move heaven and earth for. Amen.
[2:04:47] But we focus so much on this 84 cents. I
[2:04:50] said to to the church back home that
[2:04:54] with inflation today that would be worth
[2:04:57] $4.82 American. Amen. Just for the
[2:05:02] record. Amen. Dust thou art, dust
[2:05:04] returneth. Was not spoken of the soul.
[2:05:06] Yes. 84 cents what the human body is
[2:05:10] worth.
[2:05:11] Hallelujah. That's why the tender hand
[2:05:14] of Jehovah doesn't mind to let 6 million
[2:05:18] Jews be killed. Doesn't mind to apply
[2:05:21] pressure when he needs to. Doesn't want
[2:05:24] mind, Amen. to let this body go through
[2:05:26] sickness and so forth. That's why our
[2:05:29] Lord also instructs us in Matthew 18.
[2:05:32] Amen. As an act of love and obviously in
[2:05:35] the right attitude and through that
[2:05:37] agapo expression like our brother spoke
[2:05:39] about when someone goes wrong. Amen. To
[2:05:43] let Satan have its body so that the soul
[2:05:47] can be saved. Why you comparing
[2:05:51] $482 with 10,000 worlds? There's no
[2:05:54] comparison. Amen. There's no comparison.
[2:05:58] And of course, and and I don't want to
[2:06:00] go down that road too far because it's
[2:06:02] one of my favorite topics. When Matthew
[2:06:04] 18 is expressed in anything else but
[2:06:07] unselfish agapo love for that brother or
[2:06:11] sister, if that motive is just a inch
[2:06:14] wrong, my brother and sister, if it's
[2:06:16] any bit about our pride or looking good
[2:06:18] or looking this or that, it's wrong.
[2:06:21] It needs to be
[2:06:23] expressed in godly love with the
[2:06:27] absolute right focus and the right
[2:06:29] motive.
[2:06:31] Amen. And over the years, we've done a
[2:06:32] lot of things that's not exactly that.
[2:06:37] Hallelujah. Just like all the power of
[2:06:39] heaven, my brother and sister, was
[2:06:41] reflected in that little baby in the
[2:06:44] manger. That little weak baby, helpless
[2:06:48] baby. That same power is now
[2:06:51] reflected in these bodies that look like
[2:06:54] real little helpless babies.
[2:06:57] Amen. But the important part is God was
[2:07:00] in that little baby and God is now in
[2:07:04] this
[2:07:05] person.
[2:07:07] Amen. Now I just want to quickly go I
[2:07:10] see our time is running very quickly.
[2:07:13] go down a little little um side comment
[2:07:16] and that is at what point did we become
[2:07:20] sons and
[2:07:22] daughters and in the natural we become
[2:07:24] sons and daughters when that seed was
[2:07:27] formed in our father's
[2:07:30] um potentials. Amen. Or where the seed
[2:07:34] was placed in mom or where it came forth
[2:07:36] as an expression. Amen. The point is it
[2:07:39] was there already in potentials in dad
[2:07:42] from the start and in our heavenly
[2:07:44] father in that Elohim that seed
[2:07:48] expression already
[2:07:50] was son in attribute
[2:07:55] form and son came forth as word
[2:07:59] form. Sons and daughters and sons and
[2:08:02] daughters are now coming forth my
[2:08:04] brother and sister by that attribute now
[2:08:07] in us. But we are sons and daughters
[2:08:10] before we are even born. Amen. When we
[2:08:15] have to face judgment, are you or are
[2:08:17] you not sons and daughters? Amen. Sons
[2:08:20] and daughters will never face judgment
[2:08:23] at the white throne because we've
[2:08:25] already been judged and we've been
[2:08:28] accepted as sons and daughters. Why?
[2:08:31] Because Jesus Christ gave his blood on
[2:08:33] Calvary for sons and daughters and has
[2:08:36] already accepted every one of those
[2:08:39] attributes. He took it there. Amen. On
[2:08:42] our behalf.
[2:08:47] So when we fail, when we make mistakes,
[2:08:50] when we fail God bitterly every
[2:08:53] day, we are still sons.
[2:08:57] Sunship, my brother and sister, is not
[2:08:59] something that we go out of. Amen.
[2:09:03] Sunship was judged eternally
[2:09:06] already. But Brandon makes a statement.
[2:09:09] He says, "It's not you or I to say which
[2:09:11] is fish and which is not. We don't know.
[2:09:13] We just cast the net and pull it. That's
[2:09:15] all. God knows his own. Those who he
[2:09:18] forneew, he called. And those who he
[2:09:21] called, he has justified. And those who
[2:09:24] he has justified, he hath glorified.
[2:09:27] Amen. It's a done deal. It's a finished
[2:09:29] work. In God's mind, there's absolutely
[2:09:32] nothing that can make you get lost.
[2:09:38] And the trials on this earth is
[2:09:40] sometimes God knocking on your heart to
[2:09:43] get your attention.
[2:09:45] So that we can get to a point where we
[2:09:47] can
[2:09:48] realize I am not sufficient for this
[2:09:51] thing. I cannot do it. Because under no
[2:09:57] circumstances can you die again for your
[2:10:00] sins that Jesus Christ has died for
[2:10:03] already.
[2:10:05] Under no circumstances can you pay again
[2:10:07] the price that Jesus Christ has paid
[2:10:09] already. Under no circumstances can you
[2:10:12] add anything to your salvation by your
[2:10:15] own works.
[2:10:18] God only looks at himself and his
[2:10:21] attributes.
[2:10:25] But of course and this is really where I
[2:10:28] want to start focusing on for a moment.
[2:10:30] We need a revelation of sunship.
[2:10:34] Otherwise, my brother and sister, we are
[2:10:36] like that Johnny Crow. Otherwise, we are
[2:10:38] like that one that gets that gets
[2:10:41] loosened. Amen. The prison doors can be
[2:10:43] opened. Amen. But we sit there and we
[2:10:46] don't want to take our
[2:10:48] potentials. That Johnny Crow will still
[2:10:51] walk round and round and round and
[2:10:52] round. And God needs to reveal to us
[2:10:55] personally, amen, I've done it. You
[2:10:59] free. You can go now. You can soar into
[2:11:02] the sky. Hear the mother eagle calling.
[2:11:05] Amen. You're not a chicken. Amen. But I
[2:11:09] see chickens all around me, but you're
[2:11:10] not a chicken. Amen. Stop looking at
[2:11:14] yourself. Stop looking at people around
[2:11:16] you and just accept what God says about
[2:11:19] you.
[2:11:20] And my brother and sister, major major
[2:11:23] major struggles in people's minds can be
[2:11:26] overcome by just simply
[2:11:29] in our heart. not mind over matter in
[2:11:33] our heart
[2:11:34] accepting what Christ says in his word
[2:11:39] by dying to our thoughts by dying to our
[2:11:42] opinion of ourselves, by dying to our
[2:11:45] ideas of how we need to manufacture God
[2:11:48] and how we need to try and be better
[2:11:50] citizens and how we need to this and
[2:11:52] impress God and all those kind of
[2:11:53] things. We need to accept what God has
[2:11:57] done. Amen. Here Here our brother
[2:12:01] touched on it and I don't want to go
[2:12:02] down that that road. Brother Ram speaks
[2:12:04] about thinking in the heart. Amen. He
[2:12:07] makes a statement one point. He says God
[2:12:09] said heart. If he said heart he meant
[2:12:12] heart. He did not say thinking in your
[2:12:14] mind. What a man thinkketh in his heart
[2:12:17] that is he. And what thinks in my heart.
[2:12:21] Amen. The only thing that can think in
[2:12:23] my heart is the real me which is Christ.
[2:12:27] Amen. And like our brother said, then
[2:12:30] are you asking the question, who's doing
[2:12:32] the speaking? Who am I hearing? Is this
[2:12:34] Satan's thoughts or is that my
[2:12:37] thoughts? I don't believe the thoughts
[2:12:39] that's in here is that important in
[2:12:42] here. Once you have the rebirth, once
[2:12:45] Christ is is quickened in your soul
[2:12:48] realm, my brother and sister, he's the
[2:12:50] one that speaks the thoughts. So the
[2:12:53] question is if is it Christ speaking in
[2:12:55] my heart or is it me? It's the same
[2:12:58] thing because the potentials of Christ,
[2:13:01] the attribute of Christ is now in my
[2:13:03] soul and he's speaking
[2:13:06] or I am speaking the real me. Amen. And
[2:13:09] that is the only thought that's
[2:13:11] important.
[2:13:13] And Satan will use our senses
[2:13:16] of the spirit and of the flesh to try
[2:13:19] and break down the voice of that heart
[2:13:23] speaking. But in that heart from his
[2:13:26] perspective, it's finished.
[2:13:29] We are free.
[2:13:31] The price has been paid. Yes.
[2:13:35] If we think from that heart and I'll say
[2:13:38] it in that way and I hope it doesn't
[2:13:40] stumble you then we will say aba father.
[2:13:44] I accept I am a son of God. I accept
[2:13:49] like brother Ram says I'm no longer the
[2:13:51] son of Charles Alabbran. I accept that
[2:13:54] this flesh that I was caught up in was
[2:13:56] just something God used to grow this
[2:13:59] this attribute into maturity to grow my
[2:14:03] character to achieve something through
[2:14:05] through my life.
[2:14:08] Amen. And still in the meanwhile, my
[2:14:10] brothers and sisters, we die daily to
[2:14:12] ourselves.
[2:14:14] Die daily. When I say to ourselves, I
[2:14:16] pro I speak about our human spirit.
[2:14:18] Amen. The more our human spirit dies,
[2:14:21] the more the God part can come forward,
[2:14:24] the more the God part can be on display,
[2:14:26] the more the the white dog is in
[2:14:29] control. Amen. The more the white dog
[2:14:31] can can control and have the upper hand
[2:14:34] in our
[2:14:36] lives. I'm going to start winding down
[2:14:38] and skip some of this
[2:14:43] here, but I'll just say some people are
[2:14:45] too scared to let go.
[2:14:48] And most of the time it's because of
[2:14:52] that greatest battle
[2:14:54] that's being fought here.
[2:14:57] And most of the time it's because we
[2:15:00] have a skewed expectation of what the
[2:15:03] rebirth is.
[2:15:05] We expect it's a big fanfare and
[2:15:08] something.
[2:15:09] Amen. When we're honest with ourselves
[2:15:12] often that's the expectation. We're
[2:15:14] expecting that when the rebirth happens
[2:15:16] that you know there's going to be major
[2:15:18] outpour of emotion or things like that.
[2:15:20] Amen. It can be like a brother said it
[2:15:23] can be but it's not necessarily that
[2:15:27] but it's a grounding a anchor that
[2:15:31] anchors in the word. Amen. That people
[2:15:34] cannot take it away from me again.
[2:15:38] Even though, and I'll say that, Satan
[2:15:40] can still after that convince you in
[2:15:42] this thing you don't have it because
[2:15:44] that's his whole aim. Amen. He is a very
[2:15:48] good salesman. When you have it, he will
[2:15:50] sell to you that you don't. And when you
[2:15:52] don't, he will sell to you that you
[2:15:54] have. Amen. He's a liar. Amen. When how
[2:15:58] do we know the Satan is lying? When he
[2:16:00] opens his mouth. Amen. When he opens his
[2:16:02] mouth, he's lying to us. Amen. Now, how
[2:16:05] do you know what God's word is? whether
[2:16:07] it's God's word speaking or whether it's
[2:16:09] Satan speaking. Amen. I believe my
[2:16:13] brother and sister when it comes to the
[2:16:15] rebirth and and be careful how you get
[2:16:18] this now. I think we should stop
[2:16:21] worrying about it the whole time. We
[2:16:24] should stop digging up that little plant
[2:16:27] the whole time to see has it formed
[2:16:28] roots yet.
[2:16:31] We should just submit to God.
[2:16:35] Amen. let go and let God have his
[2:16:37] wonderful way. Amen. And I believe we
[2:16:41] can pray every day, God, bring me closer
[2:16:43] to you. God, I I'm eating your word. I'm
[2:16:47] taking in word and I want to reflect you
[2:16:50] more.
[2:16:51] But God, I cannot do it. I can do
[2:16:55] nothing to add to my stature in God. I
[2:16:58] can do nothing personally to make that
[2:17:00] word grow in my life except eat it.
[2:17:04] Amen. Amen. Our brother said something
[2:17:06] really, really special. And I just
[2:17:08] thought I'd throw this in also that you
[2:17:11] see, can you remember what you heard
[2:17:13] last Sunday morning in church? Now, half
[2:17:16] the time we can't. Amen. And then we
[2:17:19] want to, you know, judge ourselves for
[2:17:21] not remembering, but our souls were fed.
[2:17:25] A pastor once asked asked someone that
[2:17:27] came to him with that thing. He says,
[2:17:29] "Can you remember what you had last
[2:17:30] Sunday morning for
[2:17:32] breakfast?" No. Did it feed you? Yes.
[2:17:36] Amen. Same principle. Eat the word, it
[2:17:39] feeds your soul. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:17:45] In the millennium, Satan, Satan's hands
[2:17:48] are bound by circumstance.
[2:17:50] Many times we actually bound God's way
[2:17:53] in our life
[2:17:56] by unbelief, by looking at ourselves, by
[2:17:59] focusing on all the wrong things, by
[2:18:01] believing we're not good enough, by
[2:18:04] intellectual approach. Amen. I just feel
[2:18:07] to go down this road. There seems to be
[2:18:09] a pull in this direction. If someone can
[2:18:12] intellectually convince you of this
[2:18:15] message, someone else can intellectually
[2:18:18] convince you out of this message,
[2:18:21] Amen. The work of God is not an
[2:18:23] intellectual work. Amen. We try so hard
[2:18:27] to convince people.
[2:18:30] You can't convince someone into the the
[2:18:32] rebirth. It's a work of grace. Amen. And
[2:18:37] I believe the right way is to live the
[2:18:40] token. Like our brother said, express
[2:18:42] that atmosphere. Amen. Live the token.
[2:18:46] Amen. And of course, part of living the
[2:18:48] token is if that person gets thirsty,
[2:18:51] make the virtue available. Amen. If that
[2:18:54] person is thirsty, share the word. But
[2:18:56] don't try and force it down their
[2:18:57] throats, convince them, lo overload
[2:19:00] their minds. Amen. Two opinions that we
[2:19:03] kind of, oh, this is a better option
[2:19:05] than that. That's never going to last,
[2:19:08] my brother and sister. Often the more
[2:19:10] often than not, it actually delays a
[2:19:12] real experience with God.
[2:19:25] Let me just jump right down
[2:19:29] to I'm just going to share this quote
[2:19:31] again. Brother Tim had it on already. So
[2:19:33] if you recognize it, that's
[2:19:35] why that's what power is in the church
[2:19:38] now. But it's controlled by a law. And
[2:19:41] that law is not keeping a bunch of
[2:19:43] commandments. It's a law of faith. Jesus
[2:19:47] said, "All things are possible to them
[2:19:49] that believe." And if you can believe
[2:19:50] it, whatever God will lead your soul to
[2:19:53] believe, whatever God leads your soul to
[2:19:55] believe, Amen. that is yours. Every
[2:20:00] place the souls of your foot can sit
[2:20:02] upon by faith, God gives it to you.
[2:20:04] Amen. It's yours. You possess it if you
[2:20:06] can find the key to this law of faith
[2:20:08] that opens it to you. You see what I
[2:20:10] mean? That power is controlled. If you
[2:20:12] are a son of God, you're a daughter of
[2:20:13] God. that never leaves you. It's with
[2:20:16] you all the time, but your faith gets
[2:20:18] away from it, but it's still there.
[2:20:21] Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet has a
[2:20:24] special way of saying these things.
[2:20:26] Amen. Brothers and sisters, our souls
[2:20:30] need to take hold of the And how can you
[2:20:34] control your soul? It's a work of God.
[2:20:39] We need to get out of God's way so that
[2:20:42] he can do the work in us.
[2:20:45] So we must say tonight, I'm struggling
[2:20:47] to live the word. I'm struggling to live
[2:20:49] this message. I don't know if my life
[2:20:50] will ever line up with the word. I want
[2:20:53] to encourage you from the word tonight,
[2:20:55] my brother or sister.
[2:20:57] Amen. We read that opening scripture.
[2:21:00] Who he who the son has set free is free
[2:21:04] indeed.
[2:21:07] Meaning of that word
[2:21:10] indeed. Indeed, certainly of a truth,
[2:21:13] verily,
[2:21:15] clean, truly, in reality, in point of
[2:21:18] fact. Listen to this. As opposed to what
[2:21:21] is
[2:21:22] pretended,
[2:21:24] fictitious,
[2:21:26] false,
[2:21:27] conjectural, that which is
[2:21:31] truly. So what he's saying is what the
[2:21:34] son has set free is free completely. Not
[2:21:39] free in their mind. Not free
[2:21:41] fictitiously. Not free in pretense. Not
[2:21:44] trying to be. Not not making up. Not
[2:21:47] human presentation.
[2:21:50] What the sun has set free.
[2:21:53] And I want to pull it this way and say
[2:21:55] what the sun has given a rebirth. Amen.
[2:21:58] Is a done work.
[2:22:01] Hallelujah.
[2:22:06] Then just a few scriptures in and quotes
[2:22:09] in in closing. Dear Jesus, I just quoted
[2:22:12] your word that your prophet said, and I
[2:22:14] know the words of the prophets are true.
[2:22:15] And you said, I the Lord hath planted
[2:22:18] it. Why certainly you put it on the
[2:22:20] Lamb's book of life before the
[2:22:22] foundation of the world. That's where
[2:22:23] sunship was confirmed.
[2:22:26] I the Lord hath planted it and I will
[2:22:28] water it day and night unless some
[2:22:30] should pluck it from my hand. These
[2:22:32] probably Lord has heard a many altar
[2:22:35] call but you're still watering at it
[2:22:36] Lord you are through your word still
[2:22:40] watering
[2:22:43] it. Jeremiah then said the Lord unto me
[2:22:46] thou has well seen for I will hasten my
[2:22:50] work to perform it. Amen. For I am the
[2:22:54] Lord. I will speak and the word that I
[2:22:56] shall speak Ezekiel shall come to pass
[2:22:59] shall come to pass. It shall be no more
[2:23:02] prolonged. For in your days, oh
[2:23:04] rebellious house, will I say the word
[2:23:07] and will perform it, saith the Lord God.
[2:23:10] What has he said about you? What's the
[2:23:12] vision about you? Amen. What God had in
[2:23:16] his mind before the foundation of the
[2:23:18] world, he will perform it. He will bring
[2:23:20] it to pass.
[2:23:23] being confident of this very thing that
[2:23:25] he which have begun a good work in you
[2:23:28] will perform it unto the day of Jesus
[2:23:30] Christ.
[2:23:32] So if you're struggling and thinking I'm
[2:23:34] never going to get the rebirth. If
[2:23:37] there's a seed it's going to come
[2:23:39] forward
[2:23:41] and see yourself my brother and sister
[2:23:44] not as a Esau as a Jacob. Amen. Brother
[2:23:47] Brandham shows he says if there's any
[2:23:50] least desire in you
[2:23:53] to follow Jesus. He says that's God.
[2:23:57] Because Satan wouldn't place that desire
[2:23:58] there. He said, "Grab that little bit
[2:24:01] with both hands and with all you have
[2:24:04] and say, God, I can't do it. You please
[2:24:07] do it." Not God, I present this to you
[2:24:10] as something. No, God, I cannot. But you
[2:24:15] have, and I pray that you will manifest
[2:24:18] it and make it real to me.
[2:24:23] In that day, sing ye unto her a vineyard
[2:24:25] of red red wine. I the Lord do keep it.
[2:24:29] I will water it every moment, lest any
[2:24:32] hurt it. I will keep it night and day.
[2:24:36] That's how he feels about you. That's
[2:24:38] how he thinks about you. Amen.
[2:24:44] Jesus answered them, I told you and you
[2:24:46] believe not. the works that I do in my
[2:24:48] father's name, they bear witness of me.
[2:24:50] But you believe not, because you are not
[2:24:52] of my sheep. As I said unto you, my
[2:24:54] sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
[2:24:58] and they will follow me, and I give unto
[2:25:01] them eternal life, and they shall never
[2:25:03] perish. Neither shall any man pluck them
[2:25:06] out of my hand. My father which gave
[2:25:08] them me is greater than all, and no man
[2:25:12] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[2:25:15] hand. and I and my father are one.
[2:25:22] Be strong and courageous. Be not afraid
[2:25:24] nor is made. For the king of Assyria,
[2:25:26] that's Hezekiah speaking if I remember
[2:25:28] right. Not for all the multitude that's
[2:25:30] with him. For there there be more with
[2:25:32] us than with him. With him is an arm of
[2:25:35] flesh, which is really a distraction if
[2:25:38] anything. But with us is the Lord our
[2:25:40] God to help us and to fight our battles.
[2:25:43] And the people rested themselves upon
[2:25:45] the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.
[2:25:53] And the last one, I wonder if the
[2:25:55] musicians can come up so long. What was
[2:25:57] he doing? Confirming his word that
[2:25:59] someday he who turned old and gray and
[2:26:02] wrinkled someday will spring back to a
[2:26:04] young man and young woman again. God
[2:26:06] gave us life and we come to the maturity
[2:26:09] death set in taken us away. But all that
[2:26:12] death can do is take us away. Then it's
[2:26:15] finished. Then listen to this. Then all
[2:26:18] the old doubting part and everything.
[2:26:20] It's like the man life in there has gone
[2:26:23] out. Then there's nothing left but
[2:26:26] perfection.
[2:26:28] Death takes all the temporary parts and
[2:26:31] nothing is left but perfection.
[2:26:35] Amen. I'd like to sing that jubilee song
[2:26:38] when we done. What this body was when it
[2:26:40] was in perfection, what God intended
[2:26:43] when it resurrects in the resurrection,
[2:26:45] it will be perfection.
[2:26:49] Does it say anything about now? Not
[2:26:52] going to happen.
[2:26:54] Not going to be perfect on this side.
[2:26:58] Oh, when I think of that, my heart just
[2:27:00] turns
[2:27:01] flip-flops. Yeah. It's not just a
[2:27:03] mythical dream. It's thus sayaeth the
[2:27:05] Lord. God said so. Then I'll base my
[2:27:07] life right there. Yes, sir. God said so.
[2:27:10] That settles it forever. It's settled in
[2:27:13] heaven. And if a little piece of heaven
[2:27:16] is in our heart, it ought to settle it
[2:27:18] there. That's all. That just makes it
[2:27:21] all right. God, you said so. I believe
[2:27:23] it. That's just all. That's enough. You
[2:27:26] say, "Is it that simple, my brother?"
[2:27:28] Amen.
[2:27:30] Hallelujah. It's just accepting what God
[2:27:33] says. That's right. So just in closing,
[2:27:36] if you are like one of those still
[2:27:39] struggling to express into the new brave
[2:27:43] world, ask God to unlock the cells.
[2:27:48] Because it's no good. You kick and
[2:27:50] scream and try and put effort in by
[2:27:53] yourself. It's only God.
[2:27:56] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just pray for a
[2:27:59] moment. Let's bow our heads together.
[2:28:03] Thank you
[2:28:06] Lord Jesus. We are so thankful Lord that
[2:28:11] father where you placed your seed you
[2:28:14] are also the one watering it looking
[2:28:17] after it Lord Father and it's your
[2:28:19] vision that you're trying to express
[2:28:21] Lord Jesus Lord and there's no trying to
[2:28:24] about it father your work is perfect
[2:28:26] your work is on time father and you know
[2:28:29] exactly father the potentials that's
[2:28:31] lying in every member of this bride
[2:28:33] father Lord Jesus and we want to ask you
[2:28:36] Lord to just continue the work with us,
[2:28:39] Lord. But tonight, it's my desire,
[2:28:41] Father, to ask, Lord, if there's young
[2:28:43] people or older people, Lord, whoever it
[2:28:45] is, Father, that's struggling, Lord, to
[2:28:48] accept in their heart, Father, that
[2:28:51] rebirth process, Lord, that you will
[2:28:54] quicken it to us tonight, Father, that
[2:28:56] you will bring those to rebirths,
[2:28:58] Father. Lord Jesus, that you will let us
[2:29:01] accept, Lord, that it's just in
[2:29:03] simplicity, Father. It's not a work up.
[2:29:05] It's not a pretend to be. It's not a
[2:29:07] have to be something special before that
[2:29:09] happens. But it's simply your word
[2:29:12] quickening the word seed in us, Father.
[2:29:15] Lord, and I pray that you will come by
[2:29:18] your grace and do that work for us,
[2:29:20] Lord. Father, I want to commit every
[2:29:22] word that was spoken to you, Father. If
[2:29:24] anything was not your perfect will, I
[2:29:26] pray that you will blot it from our
[2:29:27] memories, Lord Jesus. But I pray that
[2:29:29] everything that was off you, Lord, will
[2:29:31] bring forth fruit, Lord Jesus. Lord, we
[2:29:34] commit it into your hands now. We love
[2:29:36] you with all our hearts, Lord. We just
[2:29:39] thank you, Lord, for your amazing grace.
[2:29:42] Oh God, we thank you, Lord, for the
[2:29:45] process of salvation. We thank you, Lord
[2:29:47] Jesus, for the completion of salvation
[2:29:49] in this day, Father. Lord, we love you
[2:29:52] and appreciate you, Lord, and ask it all
[2:29:54] in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[2:29:57] Christ. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[2:30:01] Amen. You're going to have to start that
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:18] song. Yes, my
[2:30:22] labor. Oil and tears were
[2:30:26] [Music]
[2:30:29] my prisoner.
[2:30:32] something to
[2:30:36] say. But every day that I told
[2:30:41] you was drawing
[2:30:44] closer, the
[2:30:46] 49 was the
[2:30:49] longest. Then I heard the trumpet sound.
[2:30:54] When I heard that you I
[2:30:59] was
[2:31:00] [Music]
[2:31:01] I was free. When I heard you, I
[2:31:12] won't because Jesus is set
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:31:20] free. He is a spruion.
[2:31:25] I had eyes to
[2:31:29] see. I really had to stop in darkness
[2:31:35] spiritual state.
[2:31:39] Then I heard the prophets
[2:31:43] speak. I heard the voice
[2:31:47] be open up and let the light
[2:31:52] shine. See it all.
[2:31:57] When I heard you
[2:32:01] [Music]
[2:32:15] I because Jesus
[2:32:18] [Music]
[2:32:22] is when I heard the name I want you. I
[2:32:29] want you. I want you when
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:41] I because Jesus has set me
[2:32:48] free. Oh, Jesus has set me free.
[2:32:54] Jesus just set me
[2:32:58] free and
[2:33:00] he sets
[2:33:01] [Music]
[2:33:03] free. He is free in
[2:33:07] me. Oh Jesus has set me
[2:33:12] free. Jesus has set me
[2:33:17] free and
[2:33:19] he sets free.
[2:33:24] [Music]
[2:33:27] When I heard that you
[2:33:37] I believe
[2:33:41] [Music]
[2:33:45] I Jesus
[2:33:51] [Music]
[2:33:53] When I heard about
[2:33:55] the
[2:34:01] I when
[2:34:08] [Music]
[2:34:12] I Jesus is
[2:34:17] Hey Jesus
[2:34:19] [Music]
[2:34:26] [Music]
[2:34:43] is my son.
[2:34:56] They misunderstand the love of God. His
[2:34:59] love is
[2:35:03] like an election. How do you know I'm
[2:35:06] elected? Yo, brother said because
[2:35:08] there's just even as the the most maybe
[2:35:11] the most nearly silent voice something
[2:35:13] saying yes.
[2:35:15] Amen. You know, just a real if even the
[2:35:17] smallest tug, you're elected. And that
[2:35:21] proves you're loved by God. Hallelujah.
[2:35:25] Amen. I feel like we need to just sing
[2:35:28] it is well with my soul.
[2:35:31] Hallelujah. Amen. When peace like a
[2:35:33] river attendeth my way. It doesn't
[2:35:36] matter what happens in life. If there
[2:35:38] was s just even just the most just the
[2:35:40] tiniest thing. I think brother I might
[2:35:41] be wrong, but brother Bam says in one
[2:35:43] place sometimes like a funny feeling
[2:35:45] comes over you. That's God.
[2:35:48] Amen. He's calling you. And why is he
[2:35:51] calling you? Cuz you're elected. He
[2:35:52] doesn't call people just to throw them
[2:35:54] away. He calls you because you're part
[2:35:56] of him.
[2:35:59] Hallelujah. And you can't buy that. You
[2:36:01] can't work it out. You can't earn it. He
[2:36:03] put it there. We praise the Lord.
[2:36:08] Brother Bam says you can't lose being a
[2:36:10] Christian. You just can't lose.
[2:36:12] Hallelujah.
[2:36:13] Amen. I trust this is everyone. It's uh
[2:36:16] also brother Races and Priscilla, it's
[2:36:18] their 18th year uh 18th ann uh uh
[2:36:21] wedding anniversary today.
[2:36:25] Hallelujah.
[2:36:28] Amen. God bless you both.
[2:36:31] Amen.
[2:36:34] Hallelujah.
[2:36:36] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just sing
[2:36:38] this. Amen.
[2:36:40] When
[2:36:42] peace like a
[2:36:47] river are
[2:36:50] [Applause]
[2:36:51] sending my way.
[2:36:56] And
[2:36:58] sorrows was like the
[2:37:01] sea with
[2:37:03] me
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:10] grow.
[2:37:11] [Music]
[2:37:14] Whatever my
[2:37:16] love, thou hast
[2:37:20] told me to know.
[2:37:25] It is
[2:37:27] well. Yes, it is
[2:37:31] well
[2:37:33] with my
[2:37:39] soul. Oh, it is well.
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:47] Oh, with my soul.
[2:37:53] my soul.
[2:37:55] Oh, it is
[2:37:58] well. Yes, it is
[2:38:02] well
[2:38:03] with my soul.
[2:38:12] Oh,
[2:38:14] Satan should
[2:38:18] bit the
[2:38:22] trials should
[2:38:26] come. Let
[2:38:28] this
[2:38:33] [Music]
[2:38:37] bless. Oh yes.
[2:38:42] that
[2:38:44] Christ have
[2:38:48] regarded my
[2:38:53] helpless
[2:38:55] day and has
[2:38:58] shed yes his own
[2:39:02] blood
[2:39:04] for my soul. Oh.
[2:39:10] Oh. It is well.
[2:39:14] [Music]
[2:39:18] Yes. With my soul.
[2:39:22] With my soul.
[2:39:26] It is well.
[2:39:30] It is
[2:39:32] well
[2:39:34] with my soul.
[2:39:42] I
[2:39:44] sing. Oh, the
[2:39:48] bliss of this
[2:39:53] glorious
[2:39:54] [Music]
[2:39:56] Lord. My
[2:39:59] sin not in
[2:40:03] part but the whole.
[2:40:12] is
[2:40:14] nailed to the
[2:40:18] cross and
[2:40:22] I no
[2:40:25] more. Praise the Lord. Yes. Praise the
[2:40:33] Lord, oh my soul.
[2:40:41] Oh, it is well.

[2:40:59] well. Yes, it is
[2:41:03] well
[2:41:05] with my soul.
[2:41:10] [Music]
[2:41:13] And
[2:41:15] Lord hast the
[2:41:18] day when my
[2:41:22] face
[2:41:24] shall be
[2:41:30] [Music]
[2:41:31] sold
[2:41:34] back as a storm.
[2:41:42] Oh, the
[2:41:45] trump
[2:41:46] shall raise
[2:41:49] sound and the
[2:41:52] Lord
[2:41:54] shall be saved.

[2:41:58] healing
[2:42:00] soul. It is

[2:42:44] But Lord, yes, is for
[2:42:50] thee. For thy
[2:42:55] coming we
[2:42:58] wait. The
[2:43:01] sky, not the
[2:43:05] grave is our
[2:43:09] [Music]
[2:43:14] Oh,
[2:43:16] shout on the
[2:43:21] angel.

[2:43:44] It is
[2:43:47] [Music]

[2:44:13] again. Oh my
[2:44:17] Lord is for thee. Yes, for thy
[2:44:25] God we wait.
[2:44:30] The
[2:44:32] sky of the
[2:44:35] grave is our
[2:44:40] [Music]
[2:44:44] go. The
[2:44:47] shout of the
[2:44:51] angel, the
[2:44:54] voice of the Lord.
[2:44:59] Oh
[2:45:00] blessed
[2:45:02] home,
[2:45:03] blessed
[2:45:05] rest oh my
[2:45:13] soul. It is
[2:45:17] [Music]
[2:45:21] well with my soul.
[2:45:26] Oh my
[2:45:29] soul, it is
[2:45:33] well. It is
[2:45:37] well
[2:45:38] with my soul.
[2:45:46] Hallelujah. Glory to your
[2:45:49] name.
[2:45:51] Hallelujah. Praise your mighty name,
[2:45:53] dear Lord Jesus. How thou art worthy, oh
[2:45:56] God.
[2:45:58] Hallelujah.
[2:46:00] Hallelujah. Oh, I praise your mighty
[2:46:03] name. You might say, I don't have too
[2:46:05] much to be thankful for. If you're
[2:46:07] wrestling, just say, "Thank you, Lord.
[2:46:09] You called me. Thank you, Lord. There's
[2:46:11] something in me that wants you." Just
[2:46:13] thank him for that. Amen. If you got
[2:46:15] nothing else to be thankful. Thank you.
[2:46:16] Just say, "Thank you, Lord, that you've
[2:46:18] called me." Hallelujah.
[2:46:21] Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word
[2:46:22] of prayer. Let's thank him together.
[2:46:25] Dear God, we thank you. Lord, it doesn't
[2:46:28] matter what we may wrestle with. Even if
[2:46:31] the devil tries to get us to even
[2:46:33] question our birth, dear God, we can
[2:46:35] thank you that you've called us, Father.
[2:46:37] You've drawn us to yourself, Father,
[2:46:40] that you put something in us, Lord. Your
[2:46:42] prophet called a funny feeling coming
[2:46:44] over us. It's you calling, Father. And
[2:46:47] we want to thank you, Lord, because
[2:46:48] we're called, we are elected, Father. Oh
[2:46:51] God, that your love is proven in your
[2:46:53] election, Father. And you have elected
[2:46:55] us to be free indeed in this hour. Lord,
[2:46:57] you don't want us to be wrestling in a
[2:46:59] cage. Lord, we want to thank you that
[2:47:01] the prison bars are open. Father, you
[2:47:04] have set us free. All we need to do is
[2:47:07] accept what you've done for us. God, I
[2:47:10] pray you give us grace to say, "I accept
[2:47:13] what you've done." Father, there's
[2:47:15] someone here who hasn't said yes. May
[2:47:16] they just say yes. Lord, may they just
[2:47:19] say, "I accept what you've done." and
[2:47:20] walk free. Father, we thank you that
[2:47:23] whom the Son has set free is free
[2:47:24] indeed. Dear God, we don't need to try
[2:47:26] and wrestle the door open, it's already
[2:47:28] open. We want to thank you. It's well
[2:47:30] with our souls, Lord. It doesn't matter
[2:47:33] what wars against us. We can just be
[2:47:35] thankful that you put a a deep in us to
[2:47:37] respond to your deep call. Dear God, we
[2:47:40] thank you for that, Lord, cuz we know we
[2:47:42] couldn't earn it or buy it or be good
[2:47:44] enough for it or somehow obtain it.
[2:47:46] Lord, salvation is not of any human
[2:47:48] merit. It's your grace and your grace
[2:47:49] alone. And father, we thank you for
[2:47:52] that, dear Lord. Bless brother, Lord,
[2:47:54] for pouring his heart out, oh God. Bless
[2:47:57] him abundantly, Lord. We thank you for
[2:47:58] the word that we've heard. And dear God,
[2:48:00] I pray you'd just dismiss us with your
[2:48:03] blessing now, Father. And Lord, we just
[2:48:06] want to linger in your presence. But
[2:48:08] Father, may you just be glorified, Lord.
[2:48:10] We thank you for the service in Jesus
[2:48:12] Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[2:48:16] Somebody I'm
[2:48:20] amazed that you love
[2:48:24] me. I'm
[2:48:28] amazed just how you
[2:48:32] care. Through your
[2:48:35] preious blood I found pardon.
[2:48:41] Oh, and my
[2:48:43] [Music]
[2:48:44] [Applause]
[2:48:47] sil washed
[2:48:49] away. All my
[2:48:52] sins are
[2:48:54] washed away. Verse
[2:48:57] one. No one knew how
[2:49:02] alone I was.
[2:49:07] and the emptiness I
[2:49:13] [Music]
[2:49:15] Oh, I often said my life was fine
[2:49:19] without
[2:49:20] [Music]
[2:49:22] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[2:49:27] I cried.
[2:49:31] And one day someone told me of your
[2:49:38] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[2:49:43] called
[2:49:47] Calary. There
[2:49:50] you purchased my
[2:49:55] redemption. when you broke since fell
[2:49:58] and set my spirit
[2:50:03] free. Oh, I'm
[2:50:07] amazed. Oh, that you love
[2:50:11] me and I'm
[2:50:15] amazed how you
[2:50:19] came. Through your
[2:50:22] preious blood I found
[2:50:28] pardon and my
[2:50:30] sins they're all yes they're all washed
[2:50:36] away. All my
[2:50:39] sins are
[2:50:41] washed
[2:50:44] away. Yes it's true.
[2:50:47] There are days when I've failed
[2:50:52] you, Lord. You know the many times I've
[2:50:57] gone
[2:51:01] astray. But I learned that your
[2:51:05] love my
[2:51:09] weakness and your ear is open every time
[2:51:14] I pray.
[2:51:18] No one else has ever cared for me like
[2:51:23] you,
[2:51:25] Lord. Father could never be as close to
[2:51:33] me. I'm not afraid to face the problems

[3:34:34] You're the boss.
[3:34:36] You're Satan's boss. Tell him where to
[3:34:38] go. So, I can't remember who said it,
[3:34:40] but he said, "If Satan is not under your
[3:34:42] feet, he's out of his position." Amen.
[3:34:45] He's placed under your feet in this
[3:34:46] time. Hallelujah.
[3:34:51] Amen. Can we just um let's just sing in
[3:34:54] Christ alone my hope is found. Amen. If
[3:34:56] something's waring against you, just
[3:34:59] just just say you're done. I'm done with
[3:35:02] you. Satan wants a relationship.
[3:35:05] say, "I'm done." An abusive relationship
[3:35:08] is not of God. That's Satan. Because
[3:35:11] why? Satan abused you before God came
[3:35:14] and, you know, delivered you. Something
[3:35:17] that torments you and tries to hold you
[3:35:19] back. That's not God. God encourages and
[3:35:22] nourishes and lifts up and stabilizes
[3:35:24] and loves, gives himself and appears to
[3:35:27] relate and just takes. Selfish. You
[3:35:30] think that's selfish, is it? Amen.
[3:35:32] That's Satan.
[3:35:34] I would rather serve God and live on the
[3:35:37] street with nothing than have
[3:35:39] everything. Amen. I'd rather just say
[3:35:42] yes and my life was literally hell this
[3:35:44] rest of my days my life. I just praise
[3:35:46] him cuz this life is a vapor. And then
[3:35:49] what?
[3:35:50] Hallelujah.
[3:35:52] That's true.
[3:35:57] What do you want? Temporal things. Oh,
[3:36:00] but I have to let go of a lot of things.
[3:36:02] Just open the door and he'll do it. Just
[3:36:05] open the door and let him come and do
[3:36:07] it. I can't give it up. Open the door
[3:36:09] and let him do it. That's what I need to
[3:36:11] do.
[3:36:12] I'd rather love God than anything. Amen.
[3:36:18] Amen. This is not man's ideas. This is
[3:36:20] God. Hallelujah.
[3:36:22] Sorry. Just Amen. Let's just sing this.
[3:36:26] In Christ
[3:36:28] alone my hope is
[3:36:31] found. He is my light, my

[3:36:37] song. This
[3:36:40] cornerstone with solid
[3:36:44] rock through the
[3:36:47] fiercest

[3:36:54] What dance of

[3:37:02] cease my
[3:37:05] comfort my all and

[3:37:18] alone to
[3:37:21] confession the fullness of God in
[3:37:24] [Music]
[3:37:27] helpless. This gift of
[3:37:30] love and
[3:37:33] righteousness scored by the ones he
[3:37:37] came to save.
[3:37:40] Still on that
[3:37:42] cross as Jesus
[3:37:45] died. The wrath of
[3:37:48] God was
[3:37:51] sisfied for every
[3:37:54] sin. On him was
[3:37:58] laid. Here in the death of

[3:38:14] darkness

[3:38:40] heart. For I am
[3:38:43] his and he is mine.
[3:38:48] with precious
[3:38:51] blood of
[3:38:53] Christ. No guilt in
[3:38:56] life, no fear
[3:38:59] in this is the power of
[3:39:03] Christ in
[3:39:05] me. From life's
[3:39:08] first till final
[3:39:11] breath, Jesus demands my destiny.
[3:39:18] No power of
[3:39:20] hell, no scheme of
[3:39:23] man can
[3:39:26] ever be me from his
[3:39:29] hand till he
[3:39:32] returns. Oh, holy
[3:39:36] Lord. Here in the power of
[3:39:39] Christ I stand.
[3:39:42] No power of
[3:39:44] hell, no steam of
[3:39:48] man can
[3:39:51] ever from his
[3:39:54] hand till he
[3:39:57] returns. Oh, calls me
[3:40:01] home here in the power of
[3:40:04] Christ I
[3:40:08] stand.
