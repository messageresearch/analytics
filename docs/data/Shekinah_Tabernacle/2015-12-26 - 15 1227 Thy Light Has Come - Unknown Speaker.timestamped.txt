[25:45] 60. uh it's good to be home you know we

[25:49] home I mean I trust everyone had a Merry
[25:51] Christmas
[25:52] and um
[25:54] amen so it's wonderful you know I'm so
[25:56] glad he's not a baby in a Manger anymore
[25:59] you know I'm I'm thankful he was but I'm
[26:01] glad he's still you know he's not back
[26:03] there but I'm so glad we can live this
[26:05] side of Calvary you know this side of
[26:07] the atonement that we can rejoice in
[26:09] what he's done and and see it not just
[26:11] talk about it but experience that Saving
[26:13] Grace amen that he is shed abroad in our
[26:16] hearts you know it's so such a wonderful
[26:17] thing so
[26:18] let's go to Isaiah chapter 60 verses one
[26:21] and two and I just we'll just see how
[26:22] the Lord leads today so there's a
[26:26] scripture that that that is speaking of
[26:28] us it says arise and shine for thy
[26:30] lightest come and the glory the Lord has
[26:32] risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness
[26:35] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[26:38] the people for the Lord shall rise upon
[26:41] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[26:43] thee
[26:44] amen we'll go to John chapter one and
[26:46] we'll just want to read the first
[26:48] first 18 verses here just bear with me
[26:51] but um
[26:52] it's incredible just to just to see how
[26:55] the scripture is not only historical
[26:58] but he is the same yesterday today and
[27:00] forever and you know we can just Rejoice
[27:02] that
[27:03] because we know him in this hour
[27:05] how do you know Jesus is real because
[27:07] he's alive today how do you know he died
[27:10] on Calvary because he's alive today how
[27:12] do you know that he was born in a manger
[27:13] because he's alive today and what he
[27:15] says he does in his word he does it
[27:17] today that's how we know he's alive you
[27:19] know sure there's the tomb sure there's
[27:20] gold things but he said we well they
[27:23] just built those things did they you
[27:26] know but I say just bypass all the
[27:28] evidence that people having to say he's
[27:29] alive today because we've experienced in
[27:31] my life that's how I know that Jesus is
[27:33] the Living God now so first so chapter
[27:36] one and we'll just read from verse one
[27:38] down to verse 18. and the beginning was
[27:40] the word and the Word was with God and
[27:42] the Word was God the same was in the
[27:44] beginning with God all things were made
[27:46] by him and without him was not anything
[27:48] made that was made in him was life and
[27:51] the life was the light of men and the
[27:54] light shineth in darkness and the
[27:55] Darkness comprehended it not uh there
[27:58] was a man sent from God whose name was
[28:00] John the same came through a witness to
[28:03] be a witness of the light that all men
[28:04] through whom might believe he was not
[28:07] that light but he was sent to be a
[28:08] witness of that light that was the True
[28:11] Light which lighteth every man that
[28:13] cometh into the world he was in the
[28:15] world and the world was made by him and
[28:17] the world knew him not he came unto his
[28:19] own his own received him not but as many
[28:22] as received him to them gave he power to
[28:24] become the sons of God thought even to
[28:26] them that believe on his name which were
[28:29] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[28:31] flesh nor of the will of of man but of
[28:34] God and the Word was made flesh and
[28:36] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[28:38] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[28:40] father full of grace and truth John be a
[28:43] witness of him and cried saying this is
[28:45] he of whom I spake he that cometh after
[28:48] me is preferred before me for he was
[28:50] made
[28:51] so I thought he was before me and of his
[28:54] fullness have we have all we received
[28:56] and Grace for grace for the law was
[28:59] given by Moses but Grace and Truth came
[29:01] by Jesus Christ no man has seen God at
[29:04] any time the only begotten son which is
[29:07] in the bosom of the father he hath
[29:10] declared him amen may the Lord bless his
[29:12] word you may you may be seated
[29:14] so
[29:16] uh
[29:17] I want to uh I want to speak about
[29:20] eternal life eternal life has come
[29:23] and you know I just want to read I'm
[29:25] going to read a few bits from from the
[29:27] message uh uh Shalom but we just read
[29:30] there in Isaiah chapter 60 is such a
[29:32] great contrast great Darkness covers
[29:34] some people but in the glory the Lord
[29:35] has risen upon some other people so I'd
[29:38] say it's a great contrast but we see
[29:40] that the world is in that condition we
[29:41] see gross Darkness covers this world but
[29:44] then at the same time our light has come
[29:46] the glory of the Lord has risen upon and
[29:48] elect people and so you know we
[29:52] understand that that light you know that
[29:54] is God himself is actually his glory
[29:56] himself his presence has has come upon
[29:58] some people even in this great day of
[30:01] Darkness you know to me we can spend we
[30:04] can spend a lifetime talking about how
[30:05] bad the world is insured is bad but we
[30:08] can we shouldn't look at the negative
[30:10] but we should look at the positive where
[30:12] we say that God has come and his
[30:14] fullness in this hour and he has
[30:15] revealed himself to a people that we
[30:18] don't have to be scared of the darkness
[30:19] but we can say greater that is in us
[30:22] that is in the world Amen then we have
[30:24] Supreme confidence that if our God has
[30:26] called us then he will take us in a
[30:29] Rapture that he will he will by his
[30:30] grace take us into the Eternal Realm and
[30:34] brother Branham sees us and the message
[30:35] Shalom he says the world is in one of
[30:38] the most chaotic times of Darkness that
[30:40] it's ever stood in and yet it's standing
[30:42] again the Most Blessed light that is
[30:45] that it ever shine and there is the
[30:48] difference is just like it was in the
[30:51] beginning when there was gross Darkness
[30:52] upon the earth and the spirit of God
[30:55] moved upon the face of the water and
[30:57] said let there be light and God
[30:59] separated the light from darkness and I
[31:01] believe that we are living in that hour
[31:03] again that when God is separating light
[31:06] from darkness and he's pressing it to
[31:09] the other side of the world that the
[31:11] light might be made manifest and he says
[31:13] and we are the church the reason I say
[31:16] shalom to them is because that it's
[31:19] God's peace that's what I want to bring
[31:21] to you this morning for the new year not
[31:24] looking back but we're looking forward
[31:26] to the breaking of a new day
[31:28] until there is something great laying
[31:31] ahead of us where
[31:33] the years has been the joy that we've
[31:36] been looking forward to the pressing
[31:38] coming of the great light and now we see
[31:41] it breaking over the horizontal realm
[31:44] but breaking he says but breaking
[31:47] between Mortal and immortality we see it
[31:51] breaking between heavens and earth from
[31:53] a sick Earthbound sickness in a troubled
[31:56] world and to a bright shining day of
[31:59] immortal life and an immortal body and
[32:02] an immortal Earth that can never pass
[32:04] away that's why I say it's shalom unto
[32:07] the church peace God's peace be upon you
[32:09] okay he's saying that gross Darkness
[32:11] covers the people but the glory of the
[32:14] Lord has risen upon thee so he's saying
[32:17] because he because you know this was in
[32:18] this was in 64. you know into 64 he
[32:21] preached us the world was in great
[32:23] trouble you know there's a Soviet Union
[32:24] and all the different things going on
[32:26] you know and everyone was trouble what
[32:29] would happen but he's saying Shalom
[32:32] peace God's peace you know be upon you
[32:35] don't be troubled by these things and we
[32:38] can see the world was gearing itself for
[32:40] another War
[32:41] for another great conflict we can see it
[32:43] happening we can see it it's you know
[32:45] it's in the starting blocks and people
[32:47] are perplexed and worried about you know
[32:49] what's happening but to the elect ones I
[32:52] say shalom I say God's peace be upon you
[32:55] amen Don't Fear The Darkness don't fear
[32:58] how bad this world may be getting in the
[32:59] influences out there I say shalom hey
[33:02] man that we have we have God's peace
[33:05] amen we have the presence of God has
[33:07] come upon us not by our choosing but by
[33:10] his choosing I mean not by our own will
[33:12] but his will amen he knew you'd be born
[33:15] he knew you'd be alive in this hour
[33:18] and he wasn't he wasn't worried about
[33:20] how evil the world is he said I'm gonna
[33:23] I'm gonna gather my people and they're
[33:25] going to be my peace is going to be upon

[33:33] and they're gonna yield to me I put
[33:36] something in them to yield to me yes yes
[33:38] Hallelujah yeah we're gonna just Rejoice
[33:40] we sang that song The Deep calling to
[33:43] the Deep if there's a deep in there you
[33:45] didn't put that there I may probably say
[33:47] this every Sunday but I'll just keep
[33:48] saying it if there's a deep in there
[33:51] you didn't put that in there and people
[33:54] say well I've never had a pull towards
[33:55] God but yet they go into the world and
[33:57] they tried drugs and they try women and
[33:59] they try drink and they try Sport and
[34:01] they try business and they try all these
[34:03] different things they're trying to
[34:04] satisfy that deep
[34:08] all these natural things and they say
[34:10] well God's never called me God is
[34:12] calling
[34:13] but people always go to a natural answer
[34:15] when there's only one answer which is
[34:17] Jesus Christ but remember he put that he
[34:20] put that in you and you can't buy it you
[34:22] can't earn it you can't learn it it's
[34:24] there before you're born it's there
[34:27] Hallelujah
[34:29] so now
[34:31] I just I just skip down I want to read
[34:32] this
[34:34] I was so blessed when I read this quote
[34:35] here this is in God's covenant with
[34:37] Abraham and if I jump around I jump
[34:40] around he says yes sir that's he
[34:43] now he was the one back there in the
[34:45] bosom of the Father the logos that went
[34:47] out of God in the beginning was the word
[34:49] and the Word was with God and the Word
[34:51] was God and the word became flesh and
[34:54] dwelt Among Us
[34:55] and he was with Abraham
[34:58] he was the god of Abraham so remember
[35:00] there's the Sons and Daughters of
[35:02] Abraham are alive upon the Earth by
[35:04] faith amen the faith generation are the
[35:07] are thee they have the same Faith
[35:09] Abraham had
[35:10] so they had the same faith that would
[35:12] take them from where they are born into
[35:14] a new land yes and they would be taken
[35:16] to a place where they where God says
[35:18] this all belongs to you and not only
[35:21] that but Abraham was promised a promised
[35:23] son
[35:24] amen and his own flesh couldn't couldn't
[35:27] bring it forth you know Romans Romans I
[35:30] believe chapter four maybe let's just
[35:31] read a little bit
[35:34] um and then I'll come back to I'll come
[35:36] back to this quote but you know he
[35:38] speaks in this
[35:40] you hear Brother Brown say I met God's
[35:42] requirements
[35:44] I've met God's requirements
[35:46] and if we're not careful we will we will
[35:49] make it make that a hamster wheel
[35:51] and we'll say and we'll try and meet
[35:53] God's requirements what does that mean
[35:54] I've met God's requirements and so he
[35:58] and he answers the question in the
[36:00] Square it's beautiful because he about I
[36:02] just want to read this verse because
[36:03] Abraham we have the faith of Abraham
[36:05] the believer has the faith of Abraham
[36:08] and we read this here we'll go down to
[36:10] uh you know Romans 4.
[36:14] and then we'll go down to
[36:18] let's just read from verse 13 we'll go
[36:20] down we'll just read it but let's just
[36:21] read this for the promise that he should
[36:23] be ear of the world was not to Abraham
[36:25] or a seed but through the law that
[36:28] through the righteousness of faith
[36:30] for if they which are of the law be is
[36:33] Faith is made void and the promise made
[36:35] of no effect because the law worketh
[36:38] wrath for where there are no laws there
[36:40] is no transgression therefore it is of
[36:42] faith and that it might be by grace to
[36:45] the end of the promise might be sure to
[36:47] all the seed not only sorry not to only
[36:51] which is of the law
[36:53] but to that which is of the faith of
[36:55] Abraham who is the father of us all for
[36:58] it is written I have made thee father of
[37:00] many nations before him whom he believed
[37:03] even God whom quickened the dead and
[37:05] calleth all things which are not as
[37:08] though they were who against hope
[37:10] believed in hope now there's hope in the
[37:13] Bible is not like I hope I win the lotto
[37:15] it's a it's an Earnest expectation that
[37:17] God is going to do it that is Bible hope
[37:20] so it's not a hope so it's actually I'm
[37:22] under expectation to see it fulfilled
[37:24] so who against hope Believers and hope
[37:26] that he might become the father of many
[37:27] nations according to that which was
[37:30] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[37:33] not weak in faith he considered not his
[37:35] own body now dead when he was yet a
[37:38] hundred years old neither yet the
[37:40] deadness of Sarah's womb he stagger not
[37:42] at the promise of God through unbelief
[37:44] but was strong and faith-giving glory to
[37:46] God and being fully persuaded uh that
[37:50] what he had promised he was also able to
[37:52] perform and therefore it was imputed
[37:55] unto him for righteousness now it was
[37:57] not written for his sake alone that it
[38:00] was imputed to him but for us also to
[38:03] whom it shall be imputed if we believe
[38:05] on him that raised up Jesus our lord
[38:08] from the dead who was delivered for our
[38:11] offenses and was raised again for our
[38:13] justification so Abraham
[38:15] hey yo it wasn't just Sarah's womb that
[38:18] was dead Abraham's body was dead as well
[38:20] he couldn't bring forth the promise in
[38:22] his own you know it wasn't that he was
[38:24] fertile and she was sterile but they
[38:26] were both in that condition
[38:28] and even when they were nearly 100 years
[38:30] old we understand they went down into
[38:32] Korea that you know they went into Egypt
[38:34] and the kings of those countries because
[38:36] two occasions he does it the kings of
[38:38] those countries wanted to marry Sarah
[38:40] and they were old so they weren't they
[38:43] weren't physically when they went down
[38:45] there they weren't old grandma grandpa
[38:47] because why would the king of a place
[38:49] who could have every woman he wants says
[38:51] I want to marry Grandma she's beautiful
[38:54] she was that age but she had been turned
[38:56] young again
[38:57] and that's why that's why she you know
[39:01] that's why the Kings wanted to marry her
[39:04] but we see we are we are much the same
[39:07] way God God makes us new again
[39:09] but we understand that it is not Abraham
[39:12] and himself could not bring forth the
[39:14] promise of God
[39:15] and he tried one time with with Hagar
[39:18] brought forth an Ishmael brought forth a
[39:20] wild man so even man's good intentions
[39:23] cannot bring forth the promise of God it
[39:25] takes God and his season to bring forth
[39:27] the promise and so now but he was fully
[39:30] persuaded that God was able to perform
[39:32] that which he had promised but we
[39:34] understand that Abraham had his own
[39:36] failures you know he there's one time
[39:39] where where where he actually laughs in
[39:41] the presence of God saying how can this
[39:43] be hex he rolls on the ground when God
[39:45] says I'm going to make you the father of
[39:46] many nations you're going to have the
[39:48] son and he's just rolling in the ground
[39:50] and the prince of God laughing at God
[39:51] how can this be so
[39:54] so you could say well he staggered
[39:55] sometimes he sure did but but he was
[39:58] looking when when Paul was writing the
[40:01] Divine commentary of his life he doesn't
[40:03] see those failings he doesn't see those
[40:05] failings Because deep down in Abraham
[40:08] was God is able to do it I don't know
[40:10] how he's going to do it I don't know
[40:11] when he's going to do it but God is able
[40:13] to do it and that is the same faith that
[40:16] that the Seed of Abraham according to
[40:18] Faith have is they may fail they may
[40:20] stumble and I'm not condoning sin but
[40:22] you know we still live in these bodies
[40:24] amen and we fail every day sure we do
[40:27] but there's something in them saying
[40:29] God's able to change this body God's
[40:32] able to take me into Glory God's able to
[40:34] change these atoms and we're looking for
[40:36] a Rapture in this time are we not so and
[40:39] just like Abraham and Sarah their bodies
[40:41] were changed and they had the promised
[40:43] son Hallelujah that's why we have that's
[40:47] why that's why
[40:48] we are we are the same the same walk
[40:51] Abraham had we have because he was
[40:54] looking for a promised son to come he
[40:55] was looking for a body change and and he
[40:58] received both those things
[41:00] so he was the god of Abraham
[41:05] no
[41:07] he was with Abraham he was the god of
[41:10] Abraham he is with you and he is your
[41:13] god
[41:14] if he goes with Abraham he's sure with
[41:16] you amen he was the one
[41:19] that was in the bush with Moses and so
[41:21] forth now notice when God called Abraham
[41:24] he called for a total separation
[41:26] separate yourself from your Kinsmen
[41:29] separate from your father's house
[41:30] separate from all your Associates and be
[41:33] and completely annihilate yourself from
[41:35] all these things and walk with me what a
[41:38] privilege it is when a man is being
[41:39] called like that how happy a real
[41:41] Christian is to separate himself amen
[41:44] separate yourself he says Abraham
[41:46] besides all this not if you will
[41:49] I am I have already settled it remember
[41:52] the Covenant he made with Abraham was
[41:54] not if you're good enough and if you do
[41:56] this then you have the promise son he
[41:58] says I have made you father of many
[41:59] nations I have already done it and he's
[42:01] a man he physically cannot even have a
[42:03] child but God has said I have made you
[42:06] the father of Nations
[42:07] amen and then God comes Upon Our scene
[42:10] however many thousand years ago you know
[42:12] I mean down the road and he speaks to
[42:14] you
[42:15] and and he begins to draw you the same
[42:18] light you know the light has come apart
[42:19] remember I'm talking about God's eternal
[42:21] life coming yeah you know the glory of
[42:23] the Lord Rising upon you and then he
[42:26] comes to you and he and he begins to
[42:28] draw you to himself and you begin to see
[42:30] the the the inability you have
[42:33] amen and and you begin to recognize I
[42:37] cannot you know because you hear such a
[42:38] high calling the bride of Christ to
[42:41] become one with the very king of glory
[42:43] the greatest one there's ever been and
[42:46] he wants to be United with a people who
[42:49] are born and sinned shaped at iniquity
[42:51] come to the world speaking wise who are
[42:53] failures to begin with were born with a
[42:55] fallen sin nature
[42:57] amen
[43:00] he he doesn't even look at that he
[43:03] doesn't look at your first birth he
[43:05] doesn't look at you know this guy
[43:06] because in in you he's he's placed the
[43:10] one he's looking forward in you the real
[43:12] you and then you and you feel the prince
[43:15] of God and you you just you know
[43:18] and then you feel how could I how could
[43:20] I ever do this
[43:22] amen but yet something in you says he's
[43:24] able to do it how could he save a rich
[43:27] like me but he's able to do it how can
[43:29] he set me free from the bondage of sin
[43:31] and spirits and all these different
[43:33] things but he's able to do it
[43:35] hey man I did so
[43:38] because remember the same one
[43:41] is with him is with us he was called you
[43:44] know Abraham and his family especially
[43:46] his dad they came out of Babel
[43:49] Tara Babble is just leaving God you know
[43:52] of course there are languages to change
[43:53] and then they they came out of great
[43:55] Darkness as well
[43:57] it was a great time of Darkness here
[43:59] with Babel and everything you know Tower
[44:00] of Babel
[44:01] so they were called in a time of great
[44:03] Darkness but yet he was but he was he
[44:06] was willing to respond to the call
[44:09] and then he was with God and God walked
[44:11] with him
[44:12] he says now so so I have already settled
[44:15] it I'm gonna make a covenant with you
[44:17] now Abraham and I'm going to make you an
[44:19] heir to the world and to all the nations
[44:21] you'll be the father of every nation I'm
[44:24] going to make a covenant with you and
[44:25] your seed you're coming to me in an old
[44:28] age no doubt about it and you're going
[44:31] to do a great work for me and besides
[44:32] I'm going to give you a child by Sarah
[44:34] your wife and through him all nations
[44:36] shall be blessed it says oh I just get
[44:39] to talking about that I just feel
[44:41] something moving the holy spirit says I
[44:43] will not if you will but I will then if
[44:46] the Covenant he made with man in the
[44:48] Garden of Eden without any strings
[44:50] attached to it he would send a savior
[44:52] God's obligated to do it and he did it
[44:54] and if that Covenant was perfectly
[44:57] fulfilled so will
[44:59] so will the Covenant God gave Abraham
[45:02] and his seed unconditionally be
[45:03] fulfilled as certain as Jesus came to
[45:06] the Earth to fulfill what God had said
[45:08] do it's got to be so what are we worried
[45:11] about there's no need the Christian
[45:13] people seem to be back in a corner say
[45:16] oh I'm afraid what are you afraid about
[45:18] why you ought to be the most freest
[45:20] people in the world
[45:22] amen well brother Branham when I get in
[45:25] the Millennium I ain't waiting for the
[45:27] Millennium I am right now we are now the
[45:30] Sons and Daughters of God we're sitting
[45:32] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[45:34] Jesus when right now what you say how
[45:37] how what do you mean that sounds so
[45:39] abstract
[45:40] no
[45:41] the believer you just see how why are we
[45:45] different I'm not talking about just
[45:46] here all around the world why why are
[45:48] real Christians different
[45:50] why do they think differently why do
[45:52] they look at the same world that
[45:53] everyone else looks at it and see it
[45:55] differently it's not because they're
[45:57] programmed and forced through some seven
[45:59] steps to whatever to be different but
[46:02] God has caused him to walk in a
[46:04] different Realm
[46:05] I mean their thinking is different their
[46:08] mind is yeah they're very high desire is
[46:10] different
[46:11] amen you can't help being different
[46:14] you can't you know because you can take
[46:16] your own countrymen someone who's maybe
[46:18] born
[46:19] same day who lived next door to you you
[46:21] know
[46:22] you know went to the same school has the
[46:24] same job you could have someone who's
[46:26] exactly the same like that but yet God
[46:28] has called you
[46:29] and something in you is is different
[46:33] amen why is that because you're sitting
[46:34] in a different place yeah yeah you're
[46:36] actually seated in Heavenly places
[46:39] amen
[46:41] and you can't help Abraham could not
[46:43] help being what he was
[46:45] you know brother bam says there's
[46:47] nothing special about Abraham but God
[46:49] called him and that made the difference
[46:51] there's nothing special about you and I
[46:53] but God called us
[46:55] and that's what makes it we're no better
[46:56] than the person on the street but God
[46:59] called us
[47:00] amen thank you
[47:02] that's why I believe we shouldn't ever
[47:03] look down on anyone because we're just
[47:05] like them but God called us in in
[47:09] reality we should make we should feel
[47:12] lower than them Jesus came not to be
[47:14] ministered to but to minister and the
[47:17] minister is a servant
[47:19] amen he placed the rest of the world
[47:21] above himself
[47:24] now
[47:26] we're seeing together in Heavenly places
[47:28] right now present tense every man or
[47:30] woman or boy or girl that's been born
[47:32] again of God and receive the holy spirit
[47:34] is now sitting in Heavenly places
[47:37] win as many as two or three gathered
[47:39] Christ promise to be in the midst amen
[47:42] now some people goes by feeling
[47:44] I'm not saved because I feel like I'm
[47:46] saved the devil can beat you around the
[47:49] stump every day on that but I'm not
[47:51] saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm
[47:54] saved because I met God's requirements
[47:57] now what okay I'm saved because I met
[47:59] God's requirements God called me and I
[48:03] accepted it and by faith I believe it so
[48:05] he's actually saying this is what God's
[48:07] requirements are God called me I
[48:10] accepted him by faith I believe it
[48:12] that's what he's saying God's
[48:14] requirements are amen I'm saved because
[48:17] I meet God's requirements you say that's
[48:19] way too simple no it's not God called me
[48:23] I I accepted him by faith I believe it
[48:25] and therefore I've met God's
[48:27] requirements yes
[48:28] yes amen
[48:30] oh it can't be that simple yeah it is
[48:32] God remember no man can come to the
[48:35] father unless I draw him amen no man can
[48:38] come to me so unless the father draws
[48:40] him first
[48:41] so it's not man making a decision for
[48:44] the Lord but God has to draw God has to
[48:47] draw the people amen and that's how you
[48:49] know you've met God's requirements
[48:50] because he's drawn me
[48:52] amen and I've accepted it and by faith I
[48:54] believe it
[48:55] Hallelujah
[48:58] I was just so happy when I read that
[48:59] because people say yo you gotta you
[49:01] gotta oh bang the full word of God and
[49:04] and I'll come to it because we live in
[49:06] an hour where God is making a difference
[49:09] between the believer in the world he is
[49:11] making a difference
[49:14] and
[49:17] maybe maybe let's just let's just go to
[49:19] that so let's just go to Exodus I want
[49:21] to read this now because this is
[49:24] we're living in an hour
[49:28] if we go to Exodus
[49:41] and then we're in verse 11.
[49:44] Exodus Exodus at chapter 11.
[49:48] and then we'll read
[49:50] verse 7.
[49:52] read verses six and seven
[49:54] because
[49:55] Egypt was in a time of Darkness once
[49:58] we're after the plagues the second the
[50:00] last plague was Darkness Came Upon Egypt
[50:02] gross Darkness covered the people
[50:05] and God was saying in that season he
[50:06] says this year says and there shall be a
[50:09] great cry throughout all the land of
[50:10] Egypt such as the as there was none like
[50:14] it nor shall there nor shall it be like
[50:17] it anymore
[50:18] but against any of the children of
[50:20] Israel shall not a dog move his tongue
[50:23] against man or beast that ye may know
[50:25] how the law doth put a difference
[50:27] between the Egyptians and Israel and
[50:30] this is just before if you read the
[50:31] whole chapter God is saying he's going
[50:33] to Smite the firstborn
[50:35] and so so God has actually come down and
[50:37] he's saying I'm going to make a
[50:38] difference between the children of
[50:41] between the Egyptians and the children
[50:43] of Israel I'm gonna I'm gonna make a
[50:45] demarcation now Now's the Time where
[50:48] there's going to be a separation and
[50:50] it's not and God is going to put a
[50:52] difference between them
[50:53] and this is just before the death angel
[50:55] comes into the land this is where we are
[50:58] in the plagues and so he's saying that
[51:00] that and darkness had already fallen
[51:02] over over Egypt and so God is saying I'm
[51:06] going to make a difference
[51:08] and that difference you know we won't
[51:09] read it but if you want to read it later
[51:11] you read you know Exodus chapter 12 and
[51:14] that's when that's when the Passover is
[51:16] first is first done and they had to have
[51:19] a lamb and they had to kill a lamb for a
[51:21] house and they had to put the blood of
[51:22] that Lamb on the door and lintel of the
[51:24] house that when the death angel comes
[51:26] through to kill the firstborn
[51:28] when when he sees the blood he'll pass
[51:30] over you
[51:32] so it wasn't because
[51:34] it wasn't because they were Israelites
[51:36] that the blood I mean the death angel
[51:38] would not pass over them they could say
[51:40] look we're circumcised believers
[51:43] but now is the time for the blood to be
[51:45] applied Now's the Time for a life to be
[51:48] given
[51:49] Now's the Time for a life to be given
[51:51] for a life
[51:52] amen just like Jesus came
[51:55] amen he's our Passover Lamb he's our
[51:57] perfect lamb
[51:59] and then said God now he said at this
[52:01] day now there's going to be a difference
[52:03] between you and the Egyptians and
[52:06] honestly this is just me but I feel if
[52:08] the Egyptians kill the lamb and they
[52:11] followed What Moses said the death angel
[52:13] would have passed over their house too
[52:14] because because it doesn't say when he
[52:17] sees you're an Israelite
[52:19] that he'll pass over he says when I see
[52:20] the blood
[52:21] then I'll pass over you
[52:23] and so now
[52:25] 's a great time of darkness and God made
[52:27] a preparation
[52:29] that when the death angel strikes
[52:31] then it won't affect those who are under
[52:33] the blood
[52:35] but we understand that
[52:37] you know our lord Jesus you know he he
[52:41] is our lamb and he shed his blood on
[52:43] Calvary for you
[52:45] you know we didn't provide our own lamb
[52:47] God provided his own lamb God provided a
[52:50] perfect sacrifice God provided what was
[52:52] needed that we could pass from Death
[52:54] unto life God provided a life that that
[52:57] would that that would die in our place
[52:58] because man man cannot try you know man
[53:01] and his good intentions has created
[53:03] religion man you know and and you go
[53:07] from any any part of the globe man
[53:09] there's because there's something in man
[53:11] to worship God there's something in him
[53:13] doesn't matter if you're in Africa or
[53:14] Papua New Guinea or or America or East
[53:17] Asia wherever it may be you know there's
[53:19] always been something in man to say
[53:21] there's more than life there's more to
[53:22] life than this and man tries to reform
[53:25] himself to try and become more holy and
[53:28] more you know more like God whatever God
[53:30] they believe in
[53:31] but we're we're we're born with a fallen
[53:34] nature to begin with and that's why
[53:36] there's war that's why there's greed and
[53:38] bloodshed and all these things upon the
[53:40] Earth and famine and death you know this
[53:42] world
[53:43] this world if man was not greedy
[53:47] this world could there would be no
[53:49] starvation
[53:50] you know if man wasn't greedy and wanted
[53:52] the dollar
[53:54] there'll be no starving
[53:56] you know people wouldn't be dying with
[53:58] AIDS
[53:59] as they do these epidemics because you
[54:02] see the pharmaceutical companies they
[54:04] have the drugs they have the ability to
[54:06] make the drugs but they hold it back for
[54:08] game
[54:10] they sure do they could put their stuff
[54:12] out like no tomorrow and they don't make
[54:14] any money out of that
[54:16] what is agreed
[54:17] why are millions die needlessly greed of
[54:20] man
[54:21] who put that greed in that they were
[54:23] born with that Fallen nature
[54:25] you see
[54:27] and so if they if that greed was taken
[54:30] out of the way there'd be no famine
[54:33] there'd be no
[54:35] people dying needlessly
[54:38] but man has a fallen nature and they try
[54:41] and reform themselves and do a little
[54:42] bit better you know try and be more
[54:44] moral in these things they want to try
[54:47] and evolve themselves into something
[54:48] greater but no man can do that in a lone
[54:52] strength
[54:53] amen and their sincerity in man's deep
[54:55] sincerity man cannot lift themselves up
[54:58] into any greater State than what they're
[55:00] born in that's why God had to come
[55:02] himself
[55:03] amen and he had to place his hand upon
[55:06] us and change our nature from from
[55:08] unbelief to Faith I mean take that sin
[55:11] nature out of us and the only way he
[55:13] could do that was by the power of the
[55:14] blood
[55:15] I'm in that life that was released at
[55:17] down Calvary comes upon you turns your
[55:20] heart to him
[55:21] and then you're different then you're a
[55:23] new creature in Christ
[55:25] amen amen then it's not him are you
[55:27] trying to reform yourself but now his
[55:29] nature comes into you and now he begins
[55:32] to take control of you
[55:34] hallelujah amen
[55:36] and so he had to come Jesus had to come
[55:40] but we understand now the blood was shed
[55:43] in Calvary and we must believe in that
[55:45] blood but it was the life that was
[55:48] released that day
[55:50] when he died his Spirit came out of him
[55:52] the blood cell was broken his life was
[55:54] released
[55:56] because in animal life doesn't have a
[55:58] soul and so in the Old Testament when
[56:01] they gave a lamb or they gave a bullock
[56:03] or whatever it was a life was given but
[56:06] the nature and the lamb could not come
[56:08] back upon the believer and change him no
[56:11] matter how sincere they were when they
[56:13] did it it couldn't change them because
[56:15] animal life is different to human life
[56:16] because they don't have a soul we have a
[56:19] soul
[56:20] and so
[56:22] so but a life was still given but it
[56:24] couldn't change the person that's why
[56:25] you read the Old Testament there's as
[56:28] soon as the law was given on Mount Sinai
[56:30] there was the blood of bulls and goats
[56:32] and sheep were shared by the multitudes
[56:36] you know all the time peace offerings
[56:38] and sin offerings given all the time
[56:39] because in their sincerity you know they
[56:42] could not change themselves you know
[56:44] someone who came you know they sinned
[56:46] the sin that wasn't to death and and
[56:49] they came and gave the lamb they they
[56:51] offered the lamb but then when they left
[56:54] they still had the same desire in them
[56:56] they couldn't actually change what was
[56:59] in them that actually caused them to
[57:00] bring the offering in the first place
[57:02] and then so
[57:04] but then when Jesus came that blood that
[57:06] was shared that day
[57:08] there was a life that was released just
[57:10] like when the lamb or the Bullock died
[57:13] and that same life but that same life
[57:15] was different because it wasn't just a
[57:17] man dying that was God
[57:19] yeah Emmanuel God With Us the word Jesus
[57:22] became flesh and so it was the blood of
[57:25] God that was shared on Calvary
[57:27] and so that blood was hit and a life was
[57:30] released
[57:32] and then now that life came into the
[57:35] apostles in the upper room
[57:37] and what happened was now God was
[57:39] beginning to make a difference
[57:41] I'm going to show because remember when
[57:43] Jesus was born this was eternal life
[57:45] coming back into the human race this
[57:48] wasn't just a baby in a Manger this was
[57:50] eternal life was made flesh the life
[57:52] that was in the bosom of the father was
[57:54] now declared
[57:55] and so God was God was revealing himself
[57:58] in that way because it was eternal life
[58:00] yeah I was thinking about this last I
[58:02] was pondering it was eternal life as a
[58:05] baby
[58:05] here was eternal life as a young boy in
[58:08] the temple talking about himself in the
[58:10] word he was a he was a he was eternal
[58:12] life as a man age 30 coming down to the
[58:15] river Jordan
[58:16] how was eternal life now going into his
[58:18] ministry after being baptized yeah this
[58:21] is this is God and flesh it wasn't just
[58:23] a man this was the god man and he was he
[58:26] was eternal life Healing The Sick here
[58:29] was eternal life raising the dead it was
[58:32] eternal life setting the captives free
[58:33] you know came down to where you know
[58:35] Legion was thousand devils in him you
[58:38] know he lost the captive here was
[58:41] eternal life speaking
[58:42] saying the words I speak to you thou
[58:44] spirit and their life has eternal life
[58:47] speaking his eternal life breaking
[58:49] you're multiplying the bread and the
[58:51] fish's Creed you're creating
[58:53] eternal life was doing these things
[58:56] and here he was he was eternal life the
[58:58] light of men
[58:59] had come and he came out of the very
[59:01] bosom of the father
[59:03] now the bosom you know if you read you
[59:05] know that's where the heart is
[59:08] and and the definition
[59:10] of that word it has it has a few
[59:12] meanings but it's the space between a
[59:16] person's clothing and their chest where
[59:18] that is used to carry things
[59:20] so he carried a letter in his bosom he
[59:23] put it he put it over his heart
[59:25] it is it is also a place a person's
[59:29] loving care and protection
[59:31] and it can also refer
[59:34] to the seat of emotions
[59:36] how someone feels
[59:38] so you know it can refer to you know for
[59:41] example and it's also synonymous with
[59:44] the soul the being the inner being the
[59:47] very core of someone
[59:49] so now God
[59:50] when when Jesus was born here was he
[59:53] came out of the bosom of the father so
[59:55] this was revealing this is who really
[59:57] who I am this is this is the heart of
[1:00:00] God is expressed in a baby in a Manger
[1:00:04] so this is this is eternal life being
[1:00:06] you know it wasn't just you know Jesus
[1:00:09] you know I was I was very touched by
[1:00:11] this because
[1:00:12] this is a very hard this is God you know
[1:00:14] he couldn't reveal himself like he
[1:00:16] wanted to on Mount Sinai and then here
[1:00:18] it comes as a baby this is me this is my
[1:00:20] very heart yo you know you meet some
[1:00:23] people and and you keep it very surface
[1:00:25] level how are you how's work you know
[1:00:28] and then and then people you know but
[1:00:30] better you maybe go a bit deeper and
[1:00:32] then finally people you really know and
[1:00:35] you speak them well then you begin to
[1:00:36] share what's on your heart you begin to
[1:00:39] real really what you're carrying on your
[1:00:40] bosom
[1:00:42] amen and so now God God may be in the
[1:00:45] Old Testament he has more surface level
[1:00:47] not that you're probably not the best
[1:00:49] way to put it but God was on Mount Sinai
[1:00:51] and the people at the bottom and they
[1:00:53] couldn't come up into the prince of God
[1:00:55] and all these things and so but then now
[1:00:57] now he's going to reveal his heart this
[1:00:59] is this is really who I am this is
[1:01:02] really this is I'm the fullness of Grace
[1:01:04] and Truth I've come to redeem those
[1:01:06] which were lost I've come to find my
[1:01:09] household my children amen I've come to
[1:01:11] find my bride
[1:01:13] hey man you could yeah he's really
[1:01:14] revealing really yo his core being
[1:01:18] as a baby in a Manger
[1:01:21] that's incredible because you know the
[1:01:22] scribes and Pharisees they wanted a
[1:01:25] general they wanted some military genius
[1:01:27] or some politician But Here Come God
[1:01:29] gives them what they need as a baby in a
[1:01:31] Manger
[1:01:32] Hallelujah
[1:01:34] amensanel
[1:01:36] but now through this he's saying I'm
[1:01:38] going to make a difference
[1:01:40] because he wanted to identify himself
[1:01:42] with his people and not just to be next
[1:01:45] to them he wanted to be in them
[1:01:47] and so he wanted and that's why he he
[1:01:50] died on Calvary because there had to be
[1:01:52] blood given that God could dwell in
[1:01:54] people again and so he gave us life that
[1:01:57] that very life that was released on
[1:01:59] Calvary could come into a people and
[1:02:01] then that life coming on the day of
[1:02:03] Pentecost unto the people God began to
[1:02:05] make a difference
[1:02:06] because now eternal life wasn't just
[1:02:08] walking in one person
[1:02:10] eternal life was in 120 people and then
[1:02:13] it as the word was preached thousands
[1:02:15] more came in and then eternal life came
[1:02:17] into them
[1:02:18] Hallelujah and God was identifying
[1:02:21] himself with a bunch of houses a bunch
[1:02:23] of people and say no I'm going to put a
[1:02:25] mark on these people that when the death
[1:02:27] angel comes amen I'll pass over them
[1:02:30] Hallelujah it doesn't matter where
[1:02:32] they're born or what they're from or
[1:02:33] what they did amen as long as the life
[1:02:36] was there
[1:02:37] amen how do you know Jesus died for you
[1:02:40] because the life comes in
[1:02:42] yes amen
[1:02:44] Hallelujah
[1:02:46] now
[1:02:48] yo yo he says in Greater Mighty
[1:02:50] conqueror
[1:02:52] he says
[1:02:55] he says because he was in the beginning
[1:02:56] the Bible said he was the word
[1:02:59] he was the logos that went out of God
[1:03:01] and the logos in the beginning was the
[1:03:03] word and he and he became the word then
[1:03:05] when he ascended up on that glorious day
[1:03:07] of Easter he became not only the word
[1:03:10] but he became the high priest of his own
[1:03:12] word oh what a glorious thing brother
[1:03:13] Neville just think he's not only the
[1:03:16] word but he's the high priest of his own
[1:03:18] word what does that mean you confess
[1:03:20] what he said
[1:03:21] and then his obligated to perform what
[1:03:23] he what he said he would do that's what
[1:03:26] that means
[1:03:27] how could we doubt it how could we walk
[1:03:30] to him and not believe that we receive
[1:03:32] what we asked for for he is the word and
[1:03:34] the intercessors word the logos became
[1:03:36] word and the word became flesh in the
[1:03:38] same flesh that was the word was
[1:03:40] received up into glory and now the high
[1:03:42] priest making intercession by himself to
[1:03:45] his word that's what it takes that's the
[1:03:47] material that the word has got what a
[1:03:49] weapon there's never been one like it he
[1:03:51] was the word and when he come he was
[1:03:54] born in a manger he come to use the
[1:03:56] weapon of l-o-v-e love
[1:03:59] to conquer the world not with army
[1:04:02] bullets not with machine guns and tanks
[1:04:04] but he come in a different manner he'd
[1:04:07] come
[1:04:07] he come in the form of love he was God's
[1:04:10] love he said one time as a little boy I
[1:04:14] used to think that Christ loved me and
[1:04:16] God hated me because that Christ died
[1:04:18] for me but God had something against me
[1:04:21] but I come to find out that Christ is
[1:04:23] the very heart of God
[1:04:24] hallelujah God so loved the world he
[1:04:27] gave his only begotten son that
[1:04:28] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:04:30] perish but would have eternal life
[1:04:33] Hallelujah
[1:04:35] now
[1:04:37] so he said he'd make a difference now I
[1:04:39] just wanna
[1:04:40] and that's why God in this Darkness hour
[1:04:42] he's making a difference
[1:04:45] because that same life that was given on
[1:04:47] the day of Pentecost
[1:04:49] is in The Believer today
[1:04:51] Amen brother Brown said that that life
[1:04:54] was once caught in the doors you know
[1:04:57] stuck at the doors of of denomination of
[1:04:59] creed and Dogma it was actually held
[1:05:02] back from the people they said it's been
[1:05:04] released by this end time message the
[1:05:06] Holy Ghost is released by this entire
[1:05:08] message to the people why because the
[1:05:10] truth of God's word will give you access
[1:05:12] to the to the Holy Ghost
[1:05:15] I mean so because if you believe a lie
[1:05:17] you won't get what you think you should
[1:05:18] get but if you believe the truth you'll
[1:05:20] receive the results of the truth
[1:05:23] Hallelujah that's why you know
[1:05:26] we find out
[1:05:28] that this is why God is making a
[1:05:30] difference
[1:05:32] between the church the believer in the
[1:05:35] world
[1:05:36] amen that even in this dark hour
[1:05:41] if you have the life of God in you
[1:05:44] and that's what God requires he requires
[1:05:46] that token not just it's not blood
[1:05:48] chemistry anymore because you can't get
[1:05:50] the blood chemistry back it was on
[1:05:51] Calvary the rest of life that was in
[1:05:54] that blood comes into you and that's why
[1:05:56] I posed the question before how do you
[1:05:58] know God died for young how do you know
[1:05:59] Jesus died for you on Calvary because
[1:06:01] the life that was in him comes into you
[1:06:03] that's how you how do you know your sins
[1:06:06] are forgiven because a life that was in
[1:06:08] him comes into you yes well then how do
[1:06:10] you and you say well then people were
[1:06:13] going to go down the road has my
[1:06:14] experience been big enough
[1:06:18] no
[1:06:19] you're gonna you gotta I was talking to
[1:06:22] a young brother up in you know up in
[1:06:24] Tauranga
[1:06:26] brother Bram was speaking to a sister
[1:06:28] called sister Bruce
[1:06:30] I'm sure you've read or listened to if
[1:06:32] you haven't go read it's either called
[1:06:33] interviewer sister Bruce or private
[1:06:35] interview and in 1964 and there's a
[1:06:38] sister who who's a Believer and she has
[1:06:40] a private interview with the prophet and
[1:06:42] she's asking when she wants to know that
[1:06:44] God would show him a vision of when did
[1:06:47] I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:49] because she feels like she's just a
[1:06:51] failure and there's no way she could you
[1:06:52] know she wants to know
[1:06:54] and then
[1:06:56] he very much simply says one day your
[1:07:00] life was going this way
[1:07:01] but now your heart all your heart is I
[1:07:03] want to serve the Lord
[1:07:05] and he asked her what did it
[1:07:07] and she said Christ you can hear it on
[1:07:09] the recording and he says there it is
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:13] so you've got to look at you know you've
[1:07:15] got to look at your life
[1:07:17] and you have to now remember if you
[1:07:20] really
[1:07:21] believe you know if we love him we keep
[1:07:23] his Commandments because his God his
[1:07:25] commandment's not Grievous to us
[1:07:27] but you see you gotta strip down
[1:07:29] everything in your life
[1:07:31] and even when you don't feel like
[1:07:33] serving God and even when you don't feel
[1:07:34] like coming to church and even being a
[1:07:36] Believer you're going to come down to
[1:07:37] the very core of you and think has my
[1:07:41] heart turned that deep down even if I'm
[1:07:43] tired and wore out and however the
[1:07:45] devil's warring against you deep down
[1:07:47] you want to serve him because you love
[1:07:49] him above all things I can say according
[1:07:52] to that that that's Christ that did that
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:57] that's Crossing to that because people
[1:07:59] can have great even great Supernatural
[1:08:02] testimonies but yet end up in the world
[1:08:04] someplace
[1:08:05] I believe in the Supernatural absolutely
[1:08:08] but you see so you have to go you
[1:08:10] haven't got to take those layers away
[1:08:12] and come down to the very core of it yes
[1:08:15] yes there's my heart deep down is the
[1:08:17] real me I want to serve him because I
[1:08:19] love him in spite of my failures in
[1:08:22] spite of my weaknesses something is
[1:08:24] being turned with a life I once lived
[1:08:27] there's nothing in me that wants it
[1:08:28] anymore not because I've shared a bunch
[1:08:30] of rules or this is this is the church
[1:08:32] manual we don't have a church manual
[1:08:34] this is the church manual amen that we
[1:08:37] live this way because we love him
[1:08:39] there's not a bunch of thou shall thou
[1:08:41] shall not it's never been that way so
[1:08:43] you've got to look down the very yo go
[1:08:45] go read that
[1:08:47] when you say something is actually
[1:08:48] turned in your life
[1:08:51] that you want to serve him
[1:08:53] in spite of you know whatever goes on
[1:08:55] deep down it's like Peter
[1:08:58] Peter saw a great Shining Light in his
[1:09:00] day Jesus there yes he's but he failed
[1:09:04] he failed so many times
[1:09:07] and yet after the resurrection
[1:09:10] you know yeah you know they're fishing
[1:09:13] Peter just says basically I'm going to
[1:09:14] go back to my old life
[1:09:16] he says I'm just gonna go fishing and
[1:09:18] they're fishing they didn't catch
[1:09:19] anything all night Jesus appears on the
[1:09:21] on the sea Bank children have you caught
[1:09:23] any meat
[1:09:25] and he says and then one of them says no
[1:09:27] you know I haven't caught anything it
[1:09:28] says put your net on the other side of
[1:09:30] the boat
[1:09:31] and probably no doubt they thought well
[1:09:32] we tried that but they tried it anyway
[1:09:34] and then it was full of fish
[1:09:36] and then John that says the apostle that
[1:09:38] loved the Lord or was loved of him he
[1:09:40] whispers to Peter that's the Lord
[1:09:42] and then he throws on his fishing coat
[1:09:45] and he swims yo yo yo swims to the bank
[1:09:47] and they're there and they're having a
[1:09:49] meal and Jesus asked Peter Peter do you
[1:09:52] love me
[1:09:53] yes Lord feed my Lambs Peter you love me
[1:09:56] yes Lord he says feed my sheep Peter do
[1:10:00] you love me
[1:10:01] and Peter says Lord you know I love you
[1:10:05] you see this was the and the Lord knew
[1:10:08] that Peter loved him
[1:10:10] and so I could go down
[1:10:12] to the very core of himself remember he
[1:10:15] cursed he tried to kill the you know guy
[1:10:18] in the garden with the sword with no
[1:10:19] take try and take Jesus away all these
[1:10:21] different things he did but a boiled
[1:10:24] down to
[1:10:25] Peter said Lord
[1:10:27] you know you love me you know all things
[1:10:29] he says feed my sheep
[1:10:31] amen so
[1:10:34] look at what Jesus was looking at
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] you understand yeah
[1:10:41] amen has your heart have you been turned
[1:10:44] from unbelief to Faith
[1:10:46] because if you've done that
[1:10:48] you have to surrender everything you've
[1:10:50] got to surrender every part of yourself
[1:10:53] I mean
[1:10:55] now
[1:10:58] you gotta read that he says your life
[1:11:00] brother man speaking of that well now
[1:11:01] you have to have the own witness in
[1:11:03] yourself that you know the Lord
[1:11:04] amen but sometimes we we we're chasing
[1:11:07] something that's not even what God is
[1:11:10] looking for
[1:11:12] amen yeah
[1:11:14] yeah no I don't believe in easy
[1:11:15] believism
[1:11:17] there'll be a life that's following
[1:11:18] these signs shall follow a Believer Amen
[1:11:22] in God's time and God will do those
[1:11:23] things but people will see a difference
[1:11:25] in you
[1:11:27] amen people sure see a difference in you
[1:11:30] and that's because that life has come in
[1:11:33] I mean you're a new creature in Christ
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:38] so now
[1:11:43] so that life
[1:11:45] we must have that token on display which
[1:11:47] is the life of God in us
[1:11:51] now
[1:11:53] he says in the token of Baker's field
[1:11:55] and maybe we'll just
[1:11:57] I'll see how we go he says this
[1:12:00] is now realizing these things
[1:12:03] now he's talking about Darkness upon the
[1:12:05] world as well
[1:12:06] but just just listen what I'm saying and
[1:12:08] we realize these things and woman
[1:12:10] dressing and acting and doing and Men
[1:12:12] permitting them to do it big bunch of
[1:12:14] sissies it seems like there's not even
[1:12:16] men anymore you see men wearing pink
[1:12:19] shoes and preachers in the Pulpit
[1:12:20] something like that that's a disgrace I
[1:12:23] like to see men again that's absolutely
[1:12:26] men looks like there's a power drives
[1:12:29] them to do it
[1:12:31] uh it's the devil and the pressures of
[1:12:33] this day that's right sometime a man
[1:12:35] weighing 200 pounds and muscles like
[1:12:37] that are not an ounce of man in them
[1:12:39] acts like some big out there let
[1:12:42] men be men let let women be feminist let
[1:12:46] them be ladies he says when the tokens
[1:12:48] applied they turn back to that
[1:12:51] amen so he says when the life comes in
[1:12:54] they turn back to what they're meant to
[1:12:55] be
[1:12:56] amen that's what I'm saying you can see
[1:12:58] a difference in someone because when the
[1:12:59] token when that life comes in
[1:13:02] it actually makes them what they're you
[1:13:04] know what they ought to be
[1:13:06] God made them different and they are
[1:13:08] different man wants to look like woman
[1:13:10] and woman wants to look like men goes to
[1:13:13] show there's a perversion a dark Spirit
[1:13:14] hanging over gross Darkness over the
[1:13:16] people it's the hour of the calling out
[1:13:18] there's a Darkness over Egypt before the
[1:13:22] call before the calling out when the
[1:13:24] token was applied it's time for the
[1:13:26] church to get the token or gross
[1:13:28] darknesses upon the people he says gross
[1:13:31] Darkness yes
[1:13:32] so you say you say that's pretty strong
[1:13:35] words people you know it's a bunch of
[1:13:37] perversion but this world has changed it
[1:13:40] doesn't take you don't have to go back
[1:13:41] that many years to see the world is
[1:13:43] rapidly changed to what it once was
[1:13:45] what's causing that what's influencing
[1:13:47] the people to do that Darkness
[1:13:49] has come upon the face of the people but
[1:13:52] in that hour of Darkness thy light has
[1:13:54] come
[1:13:55] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[1:13:57] and notice it says thy lighters come
[1:14:01] you know when I when two people make a
[1:14:04] contract
[1:14:06] uh especially well this is in the Bible
[1:14:08] days
[1:14:09] they would write the contract down and
[1:14:11] they'd rip the contract in half
[1:14:13] and then during their signing time they
[1:14:16] would actually kill an animal
[1:14:18] and they would say if we break our half
[1:14:20] of the bargain let us be like this dead
[1:14:22] animal
[1:14:23] amen so God was showing that at Calvary
[1:14:27] because he knew because remember this
[1:14:29] this this walk this Covenant we have
[1:14:32] with God is not if thou will it's I
[1:14:36] already have
[1:14:37] I already have so he became that slain
[1:14:41] animal on Calvary because he knew that
[1:14:43] you couldn't keep up your side of the
[1:14:44] bargain if it was conditional yes yes
[1:14:46] amen so he knew that he had to become
[1:14:49] the offering because he knew that you
[1:14:51] couldn't keep your side of the bargain
[1:14:53] and so now when those two people come
[1:14:56] back together
[1:14:57] you could say just like if I had it and
[1:15:00] you had the other piece I'd say you have
[1:15:02] my part you have your part of my
[1:15:03] contract
[1:15:05] I mean it was personal
[1:15:07] you understand so when thy light has
[1:15:09] come is because you are part of God's
[1:15:12] contract you're part of God's covenant
[1:15:15] are you following me yes I mean that he
[1:15:17] says when thy light has come the glory
[1:15:19] of the Lord has come upon you is because
[1:15:21] that is part because you're part of
[1:15:23] Adam's Fallen race
[1:15:25] amen and God made a promise from the
[1:15:27] Garden of Eden I'm going to undo all
[1:15:29] this damage that that Satan has done
[1:15:30] this day and so he's looking for people
[1:15:33] that are part of that Redemption
[1:15:35] I mean he's looking for people that are
[1:15:37] part of that redeeming
[1:15:39] you see so when the Lord comes upon you
[1:15:42] when this word becomes real to you and
[1:15:44] it quickens
[1:15:45] amen you can say my light has come
[1:15:49] because you didn't know as I see in the
[1:15:51] very beginning there's a deep calling to
[1:15:53] the Deep
[1:15:54] amen so there's so there's a contract
[1:15:57] that that you have to become part of
[1:16:00] and God has one half of it and you were
[1:16:03] actually the other half
[1:16:05] and there's a longing because because
[1:16:07] your life is never satisfied until the
[1:16:09] two come together
[1:16:11] amen I trust this this makes sense but
[1:16:15] you see so when that deep calls to the
[1:16:18] Deep
[1:16:19] and the and your light comes when the
[1:16:22] spirit of God comes upon you
[1:16:25] that's actually the other half of the
[1:16:26] contract coming into being I'm in
[1:16:29] joining you both together yes
[1:16:32] Hallelujah
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:37] now I just want to go back and read this
[1:16:40] here this is back in God's covenant with
[1:16:42] Abraham and forgive me for jumping
[1:16:43] around but this is where I just feel to
[1:16:45] go he says now I'm saved because I met
[1:16:48] God's requirements
[1:16:50] God called me I accepted it and by faith
[1:16:52] I believe it whether I feel good whether
[1:16:55] I feel like it or not I am anyhow
[1:16:58] because God said so he says accepting
[1:17:01] your healing lady it ain't how you feel
[1:17:04] it's what you believe Jesus never did
[1:17:06] say did you feel it he said Do you
[1:17:08] believe it amen based solemnly upon the
[1:17:11] finished works of Christ at Calvary
[1:17:13] every Redemptive blessing belongs to the
[1:17:16] believer
[1:17:17] when you become a Christian God gives
[1:17:19] you a checkbook in there with Jesus name
[1:17:22] signed at the bottom of it for anything
[1:17:23] you've got need of while you're in
[1:17:26] life's journey are you afraid to cash in
[1:17:28] amen fill it out send it at the
[1:17:30] headquarters and see what God will do
[1:17:32] about it amen well if I'd known there
[1:17:36] was deposit enough his blood is
[1:17:37] sufficient for what he was wounded for
[1:17:40] our transgressions Bruce for our
[1:17:41] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:17:43] was upon him and with the stripes we are
[1:17:46] healed we were healed it's already
[1:17:48] deposited at Calvary and sickness is an
[1:17:50] attribute of sin and when you touch sin
[1:17:53] you get a touch sickness amen the same
[1:17:55] word saved is translated both ways you
[1:17:57] get saved from sin you get saved from
[1:17:59] sickness hey man so now
[1:18:03] we have met God's requirement
[1:18:05] that's what you know he says in this
[1:18:07] Christians are backed into a corner I'm
[1:18:09] afraid don't be afraid
[1:18:10] Shalom peace God's peace is upon you
[1:18:14] amen if you've come under the anointing
[1:18:15] of this word God's peace is upon you
[1:18:18] Hallelujah sometimes we take it for
[1:18:20] granted you're you're the atmosphere we
[1:18:23] live in
[1:18:24] and what God does for us
[1:18:26] we take it for granted yes yes don't
[1:18:28] take it for granted Amen in those days
[1:18:31] in Egypt the darkness wasn't in Goshen
[1:18:34] amen the plagues never struck Goshen
[1:18:37] amen and so they can actually physically
[1:18:39] see the light in the Darkness
[1:18:41] but it's not a literal it's not a
[1:18:44] literal death that's coming it's a
[1:18:47] spiritual death
[1:18:49] amen it's spiritual Darkness that's upon
[1:18:51] the people you see so we have to look at
[1:18:54] it through spiritual eyes
[1:18:56] where something is has happened
[1:19:00] that this becomes a love letter
[1:19:03] amen I was so happy just you know you
[1:19:06] know driving home yesterday just so
[1:19:08] happy in my you know my salvation
[1:19:11] I was just crying in my heart just so so
[1:19:14] rejoicing our light has come
[1:19:17] I mean we're not looking for a Breaking
[1:19:19] of the day it is breaking we're not look
[1:19:21] you know you know even It's always
[1:19:23] darkest before Dawn amen It's always
[1:19:26] darkest because the light of the sun is
[1:19:28] coming over the horizon you're about to
[1:19:30] break the Horizon and and it actually
[1:19:32] pushes the darkness
[1:19:34] you know you've seen it you know if
[1:19:36] you've ever been up in the dawn you know
[1:19:37] just before Dawn It's always darkest
[1:19:38] before Dawn
[1:19:40] and it is the darkest spiritually this
[1:19:43] world is the darkest it's ever been
[1:19:45] yes why because it's a Breaking of a new
[1:19:47] day where a millennium is coming in to
[1:19:50] be
[1:19:51] Hallelujah and we are beneficiaries of
[1:19:54] that sun rising
[1:19:56] amen amen
[1:19:57] where we're not in darkness God has made
[1:20:00] a difference
[1:20:01] God has made a difference between the
[1:20:02] believer and the unbeliever
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:06] and it's not the Believers choosing it's
[1:20:08] God's choosing
[1:20:09] because Israel he wanted to protect
[1:20:13] because he wanted to deliver them from
[1:20:15] from the Egyptians
[1:20:17] so what's God's doing all of that it was
[1:20:20] God's doing so so he gave the blood
[1:20:22] because he wanted to protect his
[1:20:23] children
[1:20:24] you know in one place he speaks of
[1:20:27] Israel coming out of Egypt he's out of
[1:20:29] Egypt have I called my son
[1:20:31] amen
[1:20:32] so he wanted to protect his children and
[1:20:34] that's why he gave the blood
[1:20:37] you know he didn't want them to their
[1:20:39] firstborn to die like the Egyptians he
[1:20:41] won he won he wanted to make the
[1:20:43] difference
[1:20:44] amen and here we are and we stumble into
[1:20:47] this world and we think this is where
[1:20:49] we're from and this is what we're gonna
[1:20:51] do and then one day God's voice falls
[1:20:54] into our ears
[1:20:55] and Faith Rises
[1:20:57] Hallelujah and our light actually has
[1:21:00] come
[1:21:01] amen and God does that
[1:21:04] because he wants to protect us from the
[1:21:06] darkness he wants to separate us from
[1:21:09] the darkness
[1:21:10] Hallelujah that we can be walking in
[1:21:13] this world but we can be not of this
[1:21:15] world
[1:21:16] Hallelujah
[1:21:18] Glory
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:22] now
[1:21:23] maybe if the musician
[1:21:25] um could come please
[1:21:27] but
[1:21:30] you know we're living in a time of great
[1:21:31] Darkness
[1:21:34] but don't be afraid
[1:21:36] the life
[1:21:38] eternal life that was in the beginning
[1:21:40] with with with God himself has become
[1:21:43] manifest unto men
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:46] and we already have that eternal life in
[1:21:49] us if you really know him
[1:21:51] you have that eternal life in you
[1:21:54] amen yes and we don't have to worry
[1:21:57] about how dark the world is
[1:21:59] sure we shouldn't be ignorant to the
[1:22:01] devil's devices but do not be afraid of
[1:22:03] it
[1:22:04] do not be afraid of it
[1:22:06] don't be afraid that your children you
[1:22:08] know right you know and maybe this will
[1:22:10] be later on but
[1:22:12] teach a child raise a child in the way
[1:22:14] it shall go
[1:22:16] and when it's old it shall not depart
[1:22:18] from it
[1:22:19] so don't just don't just bring them to
[1:22:21] church on a Sunday or a Thursday or you
[1:22:24] know Bible story or Wednesday here
[1:22:26] whatever but raise them in the way that
[1:22:28] they should go
[1:22:30] amen that is more than coming to church
[1:22:32] but it's spending time together praying
[1:22:36] talking about the Lord just show them
[1:22:38] how great God loves us
[1:22:40] you know if they're young like like our
[1:22:43] daughters they try and instill in them
[1:22:45] we love the Lord
[1:22:46] and this is why we live this way because
[1:22:48] we love him and look at this beautiful
[1:22:50] day we have God gave us this beautiful
[1:22:52] day isn't he wonderful to us and God
[1:22:54] gave us the rain because the earth needs
[1:22:56] to rain how good he is to
[1:22:58] how wonderful this food is and how you
[1:23:00] know because God gave us these things to
[1:23:02] enjoy
[1:23:03] and you begin to put in them we love the
[1:23:06] Lord how wonderful he is to us you know
[1:23:09] we know the lord it's so wonderful I I
[1:23:11] fell and hurt myself I'll pray for you

[1:23:21] Christianity everyday living every day
[1:23:25] you know it's not yo yo with children
[1:23:28] it's not about pouring Doctrine into
[1:23:29] them you just put a great thankfulness
[1:23:31] this is God's word
[1:23:33] he has revealed himself in this end time
[1:23:36] yes amen God has sent us a prophet like
[1:23:39] unto Moses
[1:23:40] I mean to that we could really know
[1:23:42] Jesus in this day
[1:23:44] amen raise them in that way
[1:23:47] and when they're old
[1:23:49] they will not depart from it show the
[1:23:52] house struggles they'll have all these
[1:23:54] things
[1:23:55] remember there was a token applied
[1:23:58] they are in Egypt there was a blood
[1:24:00] applied to the house
[1:24:02] this day it's life
[1:24:04] there was the token is the life of God
[1:24:06] himself
[1:24:08] amen and it's not just in your heart it
[1:24:10] should be in your home
[1:24:12] amen that we love the Lord he is so
[1:24:16] wonderful he died on Calvary for us I
[1:24:19] mean we were lost now we're found

[1:24:35] they'll always go to God
[1:24:38] amen
[1:24:40] raise them in the way they shall go
[1:24:43] because we have a response we have a
[1:24:45] promise
[1:24:46] that will not leave one hoof behind
[1:24:49] but that promise has to be lived out
[1:24:51] because Darkness covers the people but
[1:24:53] our lighters come
