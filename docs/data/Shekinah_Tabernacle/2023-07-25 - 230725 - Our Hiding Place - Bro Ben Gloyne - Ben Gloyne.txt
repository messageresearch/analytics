Thank you, musicians. Uh, I'm not meant to be here tonight, but I'm here. So, praise God. Obviously, God has other things on his mind. So, amen. So, here we are unexpectedly here. Praise the Lord. So, let's go to Psalms chapter 32 and we're going to go to verse six. Um, yeah. Praise the Lord. He won it all for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that's a good thing to put on the front of your refrigerator. He won it all for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms uh 32 and verses 6 and 7. So let's just turn there. Amen. So Amen. So yeah, God bless you all. Um so this Friday night and Saturday there's ministers meeting in Roou. So if you could remember that in prayer please, that would be good. There's a few of us. Brother Arman, brother Paul's going and myself, but David. So, it's going to be a blessed time, but yeah, just just keep that in prayer. That'd be really good. Amen. So, Psalms 32 and verses 6 and 7 uh says, "It's good to have uh where's Judah?" Praise the Lord. God bless you, bro. Great to have you here as always. It's great to It was great to be with him in Brisbane. We had a wonderful time. So, good to see you back. You came back to the Eastern Island, I guess, whatever you call. Anyway, Psalms 32:6. For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found. Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me in trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Sealer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow heads in a word of prayer tonight. Amen. Let's just call on the Lord. Hallelujah, Lord Jesus. To think, Lord, we can say the word is open. Sin is broken. You have won the victory, Lord. We're so thankful we can stand in your presence, the great mighty conqueror this night, inviting you, Lord, here to touch all of our lives, Lord God. We love you so much. We thank you for this grand privilege that we can gather together as a people. Lord, we just want to lift you up high, Lord, and give you praise, Lord, due unto your name. I just ask father is um Lord may you anoint speaker and hearer Lord please take control of the service Lord we haven't come to see one another though that is neat to see one another we're encouraged but Lord we've come to see you dear God father I pray you'd take your word anchor it into our souls Lord Jesus not just here but those who are streaming father and I just want to get myself out completely out of the way Lord God prepare my heart just now Lord and may you step in and speak for your glory we love you so much Lord may you meet every need in Jesus Christ's name have your Pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats tonight. So, I want to speak about this. Uh just just take this little thought here. Um he is our hiding place. Now, this photo here, I don't know if you can see it. I'll put in the background. This is So, this is um I don't know if you've heard of Cory Tenboon. Uh you know, in World War II, they um upstairs in their uh in their house in the Netherlands, I believe it was. They they they they made a false uh you know a false uh room or what do you call it like a hidden room so they could hide Jews uh you know from the Nazis and they saved hundreds of Jews from this hiding place. Now they um cut the wall out. It's now a museum. You can go see it but but the um down the bottom left there below where those sheets are stacked was actually the entrance into the hiding place. But they just cut the wall out there just to show you it. It was just about a room. You could about six people could stand there. But they hid many Jews. It was a hiding place that life would be saved. And I just want to take that little thought and take it into the spiritual now there where where where we have a great hiding place. Amen. That this this hiding place that we have, nothing can touch it. No technology of the devil can touch it. Nothing he can do can get into our hiding place. We know that hiding place is Christ, right? If you're in Christ, you're in the hiding place. And you know, it's like, you know, we just had that recent uh, you know, recent war, you could say, of Israel bombing Iran and then the Americans tagged in and they cuz they had the stealth bombers to use those bunker buster bombs to get in and try and destroy the Iranian nuclear uh, facilities and so on. I'll tell you what, they may be able to man may able to develop a bomb that can go through concrete and go through reinforcing, but there's nothing in existence or can be made of the devil's armory that can get into this hiding place. &gt;&gt; There's nothing. Amen. So, I pray that we could we could just just appreciate we're hidden. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our lives are hidden Christ. Amen. that we could really appreciate this because you know if we could think you know the Lord has fortified us behind the greatest reinforcing defense that is in existence you know you can't find anything greater you'll never will in in any dimension right so we are hidden we are hidden in this hiding place now when it speaks about that thou shalt compass about with songs of deliverance it speaks that that word songs of deliverance is escape so this hiding place where we are preserved from trouble trouble and we we know that this is a day of trouble like there's never been upon the earth as tribulation uh conditions are coming in pre-tribulation time is here it's a time of trouble but when David would be inspired to write this psalm I believe that he was speaking of this day he says that thou shalt you are my hiding place and you shall preserve me from trouble that that trouble can't come into our souls unbelief can't rain it's faith that takes control amen and what does he do he compasses us about with songs of deliverance. It's not songs of judgment or wrath or destruction. No, it's deliverance. Amen. If you listen to the message, amen, what you know what's a common thread that you hear through it? You're getting out of here. I'm going to catch a bride away. You're not here alone in this life. Amen. You're not just trudging along trying to find your way and following some blind religion. But no, the Lord is neither. Amen. He's present. He's a present help in time of trouble. Amen. He's not far from any one of us. He's closer than your next breath. And he's come to snatch you out of this trouble. Amen. So, so you know, he compasses about with songs of escape. You're going to get out of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be in a trial right now. You're going to get out of it. Amen. There's escape that's been spoken. Amen. You got to realize that God is God is, you know, it's more than just a nice idea. No, he can passes about with songs of escape. &gt;&gt; He is the way of escape. Amen. He's the way out of every temptation and trouble, but we just need to look for him in the trial. &gt;&gt; But praise the Lord. He doesn't he doesn't he never compasses his people about with songs of it's a dead end for you. God is not a God of dead ends. Amen. No, he's a way of escape. He always is. You look through the Bible, every every trial the believer went into, there was a exit door. Amen. And in God's time, he opened that door and they stepped out. Amen. So, same thing with us. Even you could say for the believer, the death, death is actually an exit door. It takes us to the presence of God. Amen. But we we know that there's nothing can take our lives until God is finished with with us upon the earth. We are here to fulfill a purpose and nothing the devil can do can take us from this world until our purpose is fulfilled. Amen. So if we've got life in our bodies tonight, we got to realize we've got a purpose to fulfill and God is determined that that purpose is done. So we might as well surrender and say, "Lord, use me for your purpose." Amen. So it doesn't matter what how much trouble the devil puts in our way. We have a purpose to fulfill and the devil can't take our lives. He can't stop us until our purpose is done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even you know so our lives are hid in Christ. Now there's um you know brother Brown speaks about the rapture of the bride and he really says it's a secret going. It's a secret going. It's a coming but it's really a going, right? And it's a secret going. He would say it's like Romeo and Juliet. you know, Romeo would get the ladder up and put it up against the uh, you know, Juliet's house in nighttime and, you know, get her off the balcony, whatever, and and and take her away into the night. It was a secret going of Juliet. It's the same thing with you and I. We're living in the time of a secret going. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's why our hearts are so, Lord, I want to walk with you. I want more of you, Lord. I love you, Lord. What is that? That's a draw. That's a deep calling. There's a there's a desire that the Lord put in here. I want more of you cuz he wants to reveal more of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you have that longing tonight, you're a blessed person to hunger and thirst after righteousness, you're blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we know he's he says, "I so see we're at the end now. See, I don't know. I'm looking for him today, but if he isn't here today, I'll be looking for him tomorrow. And if he isn't here there tomorrow, I'll be looking for him the next day. And if he isn't here this year, I'll be looking for him uh looking next year for him. I know he's coming. I don't know the hour or I mean minute or hour, excuse me, but I know everything's fulfilled. Ready for the rapture. The church is called out. It's a secret going just vanish and that'll be all. &gt;&gt; Are you looking for that moment? &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust the Lord's put you in expectation. Soon and very soon the dead in Christ are going to raise and you'll recognize them. They won't be the the the the age that you last saw them. Many of them were up in their up in their years, right? But you'll recognize them as teenagers. Amen. But and you know and then we'll be gone. That's what we're looking for. Now our hiding place as I put here, it's not a it's not a physical building or a location, right? Our hiding place is a person as as I would say in Isaiah. And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a coveret from the tempest as rivers of water and a dry place as the shadows I mean as a shadow of a great rock and a weary land. And the eyes of them that shall see uh shall uh sorry and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim. And the ears of them that hear shall hearken. Blessed are your eyes for you see and your ears for you hear. Amen. Your eyes will not be dim. &gt;&gt; You will hearken. I'm just breaking this down because I want to go slowly through this so you realize you're blessed &gt;&gt; to have spiritual ears in this day. That wasn't you. &gt;&gt; That wasn't your upbringing. That wasn't me. That wasn't this church. That was God &gt;&gt; gave you ears to hear. You're blessed. &gt;&gt; You're a fortunate people. &gt;&gt; Even the angels desired to look into the salvation that's come unto you. They couldn't. They they weren't allowed. They weren't privy to what you have in your souls. The revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. So, we're very blessed. But a man shall be a hiding place from the wind. So, so our hiding place is a person. And we know that person is the Lord Jesus Christ. And he's the biggest of them all. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like my daddy can beat up your daddy. Well, my daddy can beat up all the daddies, right? Cuz my daddy's the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, he's the biggest of them all. So, if he's the hiding place, he ain't some small hiding place. No, he protects you from all the wind, every wind of doctrine, every wind of trouble. You can watch it go by, but you can be hidden behind the rock. Amen. You can be uh in a place of safety in your soul cuz, you know, who's ever just really just sat there, you know, lots of things been going on in your mind, but when you really just meditate on the Lord, there's just something that's solid, &gt;&gt; right? And it's not mind over matter. There's just something in you just that that it's just unmovable. &gt;&gt; What's that? You're in that hiding place. &gt;&gt; You're in that hiding place. This can be going all kind of ways. &gt;&gt; But when you just kind of just, you know, take stock and there's something in there that's just anchored. I don't know how to describe it any better. To me, that's the hiding place. &gt;&gt; Your soul is safe and secure. Amen. You may have all kind of worries going on, but there's something in you just holds on. And it's not you trying to keep everything level. He just he just keeps you. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz you're in the hiding place. He's a man who's a place, you know, he's a hiding place from the wind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, every believer has a desire to dwell in the place of the Lord. To dwell in this hiding place as maybe let's just read Psalms 27 from the first verse. I don't have it here. Uh but you know, Brother Brham would take this scripture and he would he would use it as the as the text when he preaches the rapture. It's interesting how he doesn't go to I probably said this before. I probably say a lot of things before, but you know, he would um he would he would speak about the um you know, when he went to the rapture, he did not go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 as an opening text or he didn't even go to, you know, like Paul's speaking about how we'll all be changed in a moment or twinkling of an eye. He didn't go to those as the opening texts, but but he went to Psalms 27. So really when a when a minister stands up and he takes his opening text is really the foundation or really the whole you know is actually you could say the backbone of the whole service right so so I'm saying that because it's more important he's not just picking a nice psalm he's saying this to me this is the condition of the people who are in the hiding place because those who whose lives are hitting Christ they're ready to go &gt;&gt; right so let's start from verse 1. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked and even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Now, there was a time when your enemy came against you, you stumbled and fell, right? Temptation came or just your carnal nature ruling you completely and you had nothing to oppose it in you because you're just all carnal, right? We all were walking by the spirit of the power of the this world, right? There was no resistance in us once upon a time. But then God came in. Then now there's this there's this force. There's this opposing force. And that's why the believer wrestles between the divine nature and the carnal nature because there's an opposing force. Before that force wasn't there. It was just carnal nature. &gt;&gt; Right? But then when he came in, it changes everything. Right? So now, so there was once upon a time when our enemies came against us, we stumbled and fell. But then when the Lord comes in, he begins to mature and grow us. And the things that once dominated our lives eventually become under our feet. We may have to fight it for a while, but eventually that thing is subdued. &gt;&gt; Right? And then there comes a time when it came to eat you up, you ate it up. &gt;&gt; It became your bread. It became your food. It became your strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. Though a ho should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Isn't it amazing how he's so David is speaking of this end time. He's saying that you know though a host should encamp against me and truly there's an innumerable company of devils that have been released upon this earth. There's more demon power released now than there ever has been in the history of the world. So you're saying this host is encamped against me. Sure the guns of hell are trained against you. But if God before you, who can be against you? Right? But but but notice what he's what what David is is is placing the confidence of the believer in. One thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up. He shall set me up upon a rock. This is the thing that David would say the believer would be confident in. My life is hidden in Christ. He's built me upon the rock of revelation that the gates of hell cannot prevail against what I'm built upon. My foundation is sure which is the word of God. The revelation of the word. He's more than able to perform his word. Whatever storm blows, there's something in the believer says, "God, you're more than able to fulfill your word. Lord, I'm going to look at what I'm built upon. I'm going to focus on that word. Lord, I'm not going to look at the storm. Look at what the devil's trying to do. I'm going to focus upon you. Because even Jonah got to a place in a whale's belly. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. He realized he was a son of Abraham. He realized he was a prophet of God. He realized, sure, he had jumped, you know, tried to escape the presence of God, but God wasn't finished with him. And by faith, he prayed towards the temple of Solomon. God heard his prayer. He got spat out on the bank and he finished his ministry. Right? But you see, he got into a tight spot. But you know what did he do? He realized that his life was set upon a rock. I trust we are too. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're built on the right foundation. And now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me. Therefore, I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I'll sing. Yeah, I'll sing praises unto the Lord. Now, I just want to keep going down to verse eight because I love verse eight. Hear, oh Lord, when I cry with my voice, and have mercy also upon me, and answer me. When thou saidest, seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I seek. Why? Because because when the Lord speaks, where does that voice really come out of? There's a response in the heart. My heart said to thee, Lord, not my head, my heart said, Lord, thy face will I seek. But you see, this is the condition of the believer that is ready for the rapture. not having it all together necessarily, not not not walking like they know it all and they're confident all these well in themselves, but their desire and their confidence is in the fact that their life is hidden Christ. I mean that they are in the secret of his tabernacle. You see it is such a secret you know even you know the devil can't even understand how can God he's seen God he's been in the presence of God. He was the anointed cherub that coverth right? So he had access, he gave access to the throne of God. He's seen God in his great majesty. We have never seen him like that. Right? We have never seen God like that. He's seen God like that. Even the Bible says that the God is so holy even the angels are dirty in his sight. Sinless angels. So So, so he he doesn't understand how on earth could that kind of a being dwell in you and I. &gt;&gt; It's a secret. See, he doesn't it's it's not revealed to him. It's not clear to him. but to us by the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; How could God not dwell in us because of his sacrifice? How could God not dwell in our souls because of what he has done? Amen. The purchasing power of our redemption was the blood of God. Amen. So, if it was a perfect a perfect sacrifice, a perfect blood, a perfect atonement, then how could not how could God not dwell in you and I? &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't think that's too, you know, when you look at your lamb, you think, how on earth could I not overcome, &gt;&gt; right? But when you look at your lamb, you think, "How on earth can I not be victorious?" If you look at yourself, you think, "How on earth can I be victorious? And how could I overcome?" If you look at yourself, but if you look at him, &gt;&gt; it changes everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is this is the thing that that that the believer desires that they would seek after that dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of their life. Amen. Praise the Lord. So now we got to realize that this hiding place, we need to yield to this hiding place. Brother Bam says in the hour has come. He says, "Oh my, always there's um uh when there's anything going on down here, there's something going on up there also." Amen. There's always two sides to it. You know, when Satan's on the job, Jesus is also who um ever who you yield your faith to, that's the way it's going. He says, "Give it to Christ." So when something's going on upon the earth, there's something going on up in heaven also. I mean, God is not surprised when something happens to you and I. He's not shocked and he's not in reactionary mode. Our God never reacts. &gt;&gt; He He preempts. Amen. He warns. Amen. He knows before the time what's going to happen. He's never reactive. &gt;&gt; Even in the garden, he wasn't reactive. He knew exactly what was what was going to happen. Amen. He knows what's going to happen in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so whenever something's happening on the earth, something's going on up in heaven. Amen. So, what we need to do is yield our faith to our hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't yield it to your senses. Don't yield it to the enemy. Yield your faith to your hiding place. And you watch that hiding place step into action cuz he's a man, remember? He's he's not a static thing. He's not some building. &gt;&gt; He's a being. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our hiding place encamps about us. The angel of the Lord encamps around those that fear him and deliverth them. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for those last three words, and deliverth them. He doesn't just encamp about us like some silent onlooker just recording and just observing. No, he encamps about us, but he delivers us. Amen. He says, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man that trusteth in his hiding place." Hallelujah. Why? Because he encamps about us and he delivers us. Amen. I trust you. You know, I trust we could look at every trial we've gone through in life. We've come out the other side. What would our be our conclusion be? He delivered me. Amen. He came on the scene in his time and he delivered me. It's so important in a trial. Wait for God to speak. The devil, you know, God gives his word, then the devil gives his opinion, gives his feelings in temptation, but wait for God to come in and speak in the end. Amen. You can see it in the garden. God spoke, "Don't uh eat the tree." Right? Then the devil came along with his opinion. Yah had God said. Eve should said, "Hold on. Now I need to hear God again." But she didn't. Right? But Job sat there in the trial. God, you know, God gave his word. Lamb sacrifice is what I need. He gave the lamb, right? Then the devil came along, told God that Job is going to um curse him to his face if something bad happens to him. And God had confidence in Job already cuz he's been in Job's future, right? And then so what happens is God allows Satan to do certain things to Job. And so what happens is is calamity befalls him. And then what happens? Job's friends come along. &gt;&gt; And what's really happening? The devil's speaking. &gt;&gt; It's reasoning speaking. Did Job did Job start acting? based on what they were saying. No, he just said basically, I don't understand what's going on, but I'm not a sinner. Right? But he waited until God came on the scene and then God spoke. &gt;&gt; So in every trial, wait for God to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll bring the conclusion of the matter. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Colossians 3, we're just going to go through a few here. He says, "See if if you been uh if ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on the thing things on the earth. For ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. I mean, so we're hidden away. I mean, we're hidden away in the best place that could ever be uh designed because our hiding place, as I said about a bunker before, he's our hiding place and our shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. A shield quenches the fiery darts of the enemy. And he's going to lift up your shield of revelation. You watch it go to work. Amen. You'll be amazed by how many fiery darts you can quench for jealousy, strife, gossip, bitterness, unbelief, reasoning, all these things. Raise up your shield of faith. I'm a son or daughter of God. I've been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. I'm never out of his care. He's mindful of what I'm going through. He cares about me. He's allowed this cuz he wants to prove his word. Amen. He's put me upon the earth to be a witness of his saving grace. Amen. I am not out of his care. I'm working. All things are working for my good. And though even if I'm in the permissive will of God, he'll bring it round to his perfect will. Nothing can go wrong. Everything's going fine cuz he's in control. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So So this hiding place, what is it? It's the greatest thing. How did what did God fortify us behind? He fortified us behind his own word. I mean, as long as you're in that word, you're safe. If you abide in me and my words in you, then ask what you will. That's it. The word. So his word is our hiding place. You step out of that word, you stepped out of the hiding place. That's why we must be always be very careful when something comes up unexpected. Don't react carnally. Don't react emotionally. Emotional decisions are never good decisions. You look at sales and advertising, different things, it always appeals to the emotion. You could have this and you could do this and you could do this. In reality, no. All you do is have an empty bank account or some debt or something. You know, you got to be but never do main things emotionally. Always take it take it back to the word of God. Every every decision should be based on the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, but my uh my circumstances are unique. There's nothing new under the sun. Especially in 2025. We've been here a while. There's nothing new under the sun, right? So, we got to make sure that our because his word is our hiding place. And I'm sure we all know the feeling even of when you're when you're when you're walking in a carnal way compared to when you're walking after the spirit. Who knows what that feels like? I mean, yeah, we're all human, right? &gt;&gt; I wave my hands on behalf of everyone right now. But so, you got to realize if you're feeling carnal and you're making a decision, you got to get back in the hiding place, right? get back and just give it all back to the Lord and just trust him. He's going to bring it all through the right way. Amen. Our hiding place is going to transport us to a new world. Amen. Remember remember Noah's Noah's hiding place was the ark. It was a God constructed boat and it carried him from one world to another world. Hallelujah. Our hiding place is our mode of transport. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to carry us from this world to the next. Amen. And it's not to a world after there's been a, you know, cuz Noah in reality went to a worseer world. The world before the Andolivian flood was a far nicer place, right? We're not going to a lesser place. We're going to a far more supreme place. It's going to take us to glory, not just another place upon this earth, right? I mean, so so our so before I, you know, I love this. He says, look, it could happen any time. There's not one thing left. Coming of the Lord's at hand. We see the uh in the hangers of Russia all the different world bombs and things that would destroy the complete world in one snap. The world could not stand it. And before that takes place, the church is going to glory. Remember before any rain fell, Noah was in the ark safely. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What do we have to fear? Really, if you're safe and secure in Christ, nothing can go wrong. You might, well, this has happened. This has happened. I tell you, in reality, has anything actually gone wrong. Has not God worked it out for his own glory. Has he not brought it out? All things work together for good, for the good. Right? I think I can stand here and say that. I think I qualified at the moment of time what what we're going through. I'm not saying these things flippantly. You got to be you got to take a step back and say, "Lord, I know this is working for my good. I don't need to understand it. I trust you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants a people that have faith in him and trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Job didn't understand everything he was going through, but he trusted the Lord. And in the Lord's time, the Lord came and spoke. Fix the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we not in the same category as Job? &gt;&gt; But under the blood of Jesus Christ, right? Amen. So before before you know any any bomb drops, he says, you know, the church is going to glory. Remember, before any rain ever fell, Noah was in the ark safely. Before any fire fell, the angel said to Lot, "Get thee hence. Get out of here because I can do nothing till you've gone hence. Get away from here." Church going out before the destruction comes. And the scientific world says it's 3 minutes until midnight. The clock's ticked away all the time. Eternity's fixing to set in. The world knows, the scientific world knows. Said it would um scare the people to death. You heard they put it on the radio and so forth. I'm telling you what, we've got the best bomb shelter there is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not lined with reinforced concrete. It's not titanium. It's not some shock absorbing material. It's not some deep down under the earth. No, it's lined with feathers. Amen. Our our place, our bomb shelter, amen, is made of feathers. The feathers of of the wings of Almighty Jehovah himself. Amen. Why? Cuz we have come to trust to be under the shadow of his almighty wings. Amen. So our so our our shelter is not some hard place. It's not some cold and damn. I've been in bunkers before. When my parents were in Papa New Guinea, the Japanese had their headquarters during World War II. I've been and there's a there was a leader of the Japanese forces, you know, of that part of the Pacific. His name was Yamamoto. I've been in his bunker. It's cold. It's damp. It's dark. It's dingy. It's a it was this hiding place cuz what the allies did just a bit of random uh war history there in rebel what they did is they didn't because just east of there a couple of islands east was the battle of Midway the battle of Guada canal right the Americans turned the war there but then what happened is instead of them landing troops in in rebel to take the Japanese headquarters they just cut it off from the outside world and bombed it to pieces that's what they did so that was his hiding place damp camp, bunker, dark, hard concrete, dingy. Our hiding place is doesn't feel that way. If you feel Christ is a dingy, hard place to be with no light, that's not him. &gt;&gt; Okay? That's a perception of him. That's the devil's perception. But he is our bombshell is made out of feathers. It's soft. It's comfortable. It's inviting. It's impeing. It's satisfying. Amen. It's warm. Hallelujah. Amen. It's full of light. Amen. It's opposite to a man-made bunker, hiding place. Amen. Under the shadow of his wings. Amen. That's the shelter. That's the everlasting shadows of his coming in glory. That's the place of refuge. The place to flee to. Amen. Because you got to realize that you know this hiding place when you get in it, you can let off the pressure. you don't need to stress no more. Like like uh you know in the Old Testament when Joshua went into the land he was instructed to to to to delegate six cities as a city of refuge or a hiding place. So if so if a man basic you know basically you know if you killed someone accidentally or something happened you know there was people of that family that tribe had a right to kill you but you could run to those cities of refuge as your hiding place for your case to be uh to be to be judged. And but the thing is when you're outside the hiding place, they had a right to kill you, the avenger of blood. But now when you get into the gate and you get into that hiding place, they can't touch you. So you can let off the pressure. Amen. You can let off the pressure. The hounds of hell can't get my soul. Amen. It is well with my soul. So what we can do, we can let off the pressure in our hiding place. Amen. This hiding place ruin doesn't make us like, you know, like this. You know, the Nazis would try and find and listen for movement through the wall. that, you know, you know, you know, they that that they they'd um, you know, basically do a raid and all these things and they and the Jews that were there, you know, rehearsed how to get into the hiding place quickly. But, you know, the Nazis were always searching for hiding places. And so, so so, so those in the hiding place, they could not even barely breathe cuz the Nazis had listening equipment. They were listening for signs of life. We don't have to be silent in our hiding place. Amen. We can be as loud as loud can be. We can let off the pressure. We can shout. We can dance. We can do a jig. And it wasn't it's not some confined place like that hiding place there where you had to stand. Six men could stand in that little compartment. There's heaps of elbow room to run and shout and scream and dance about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can be you in the hiding place. You don't have to conform and be silent. You can be you. However God's made you to be. Have liberty to be you. &gt;&gt; If you're loud, be loud. If you're quiet, be quiet. That's fine. You just be you in the hiding place. Amen. We don't need to be afraid that any devil's going to hear us cuz he can't get in anyway. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, trust. Oh, well, we better be quick about this. Now, this hiding place go here. There's been a few hiding places through the scripture representing pointing to being in Christ. Now, here we are. We have a family. This is on the night of the Passover. where they've killed the lamb has been instructed by Moses and you know that you know the father is taking the blood. It's his his responsibility to make sure the family's in the hiding place to create an atmosphere I mean where the holy ghost is welcome to dwell and change the lives of the family and make a welcoming warm atmosphere in the home not some stress and starchy kind of place but a place of warmth and love and safety that that that whenever the family comes in under the blood they can they can let off the pressure. And so and so here he is. is he's applying the blood with all sincerity. And his wife is there holding a holding a candle, holding a lamp. Amen. You can see the look on her face. She's happy. She's rejoicing. She's thrilled. Why? Because their house is turning going from a going from a house into a hiding place. Cuz remember, the death angel's going to come down. And if and and if any house is not a hiding place by the blood, that death angel can come in, right? But she is watching her husband apply the blood. Amen. And she is she is happy. She feels at ease. Why? Because she has confidence that their house is now becoming a hiding place. And this blood works because every word of the prophet that he commanded with thus say the Lord came to pass. Frogs, fleas, water turning into blood, boils, whatever it was. So this will work as well. Amen. So she could let off the pressure because why? The blood is being applied. I tell you what, friends, when the blood's applied to your heart, blood, you know, when the blood is applied to your life, you can be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, you know, that that that spiritual death can't strike this thing. He can't get in. He's got to pass over. Amen. And but you see the son's a bit concerned cuz he's not too sure. He hasn't caught the fact that because remember, he's the firstborn. &gt;&gt; So, his life is on the line. &gt;&gt; You know, this is why you can see the look on his face. He's kind of watching this whole spectacle go on. And sure, he's seen what's happened in Egypt. He's seen all these things happen in church. And I'm not paralleling church in Egypt, but you understand. He's seen God move. But now it's it's it's his life. It's not someone else's life. Now his life is on the line. So he's like, "Oh, is this going to work? What's going to happen?" And then finally, you know, if we just skip forward, if I could, you know, the father finishes applying the blood. They go inside there. You know, she's prepared the unleavened bread and they've done everything that they were told to do by the word. And then they hear the screams of the neighbors as the death angel came through the neighborhood. And you know, he would he would be so, you know, he he so worked up. The son was. The father's just sitting there rejoicing. Amen. He's just so, you know, so glad. But then the son's like, "Dad, but can't you hear what's going on down the street? Can't you hear that scream? That's from Johnny's house." I don't know there's any Johnny's here, but you know what I mean. I'm just picking a name. That scream was from Johnny's house. I used to I was playing with him yesterday. How dad what's going to happen to me &gt;&gt; and and and and the father can say look son look we believe in Jehovah &gt;&gt; and we don't just talk about Jehovah we let his word be our hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that he said it's the blood of the lamb will keep us safe. And we've applied the blood. We believe in the blood. and you don't need to worry. &gt;&gt; You're safe. &gt;&gt; And then finally, you know, as the as the screams go down the neighborhood and pass away, then finally he could realize just relax and say, "Dad, what you've told me about a God that changes lives, a God that sets the captive free, a God that fills with the Holy Ghost, a God that transforms, a God that takes a drunkard and a sitter and adulterer and a and a gambler and a liar and a cheat and a stealer and transforms them into sons and daughters of God." I say he could say, "Dad, I finally know what you're talking about." Why? And he could let off the pressure realizing that they are in the city of refuge. Amen. So, whatever you do, come into this refuge. It can't it can't get you if you're in that city of refuge. If you're in Christ, brother say, "Daddy, will it get me?" No, sir, son. He can't get you. Why? That's his promise. When I see the blood, I'll pass over you. Go back and get your toys and start playing, son. There's no need of worrying. We're in God's refuge. Let off the steam. Israel could sit back and read the Bible while the rest of them was screaming and building up steam. Israel was relaxed. Why? Death right at the door. What difference did it make? It can't hurt them. Amen. So when death comes to your door, glory to God, as long as God's requirement, the blood's being placed on the lintil of your heart posts, what difference does it make? It can't bother me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know that that blood, that token is the Holy Ghost in our lives. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm just going to I'm just going to try and find a place to quit because, you know, Rahab Rahab would Yeah. Because this this um this place of refuge, this hiding place isn't just for ourselves. It's for whosoever will. Now, if you look at Rahab, she turned her house, her house was once a a brothel. Let's just say it as it was, right? It was once that. But then when she received those two messengers came in, remember she never met Joshua. She never heard thus sayeth the Lord, take the scarlet rope. She just had the words of two messengers, &gt;&gt; right? And and and they told her, look, hang this out your window, get everyone under it, and you will be safe when we take the city. Cuz she knew that destruction was coming to Jericho. She knew it, right? So, but the thing is a true believer when they hear judgments coming, they know somehow in God there's mercy. There's always mercy with God, right? So, so she heard, you know, you know, she testified to them how they had heard the testimonies of what God did to the Egyptians and Og and the Amorites and different things. And then she said, "But there must be mercy for me." &gt;&gt; Amen. What? So, so she so she was saying basically, there's got to be room in this hiding place. Can I fit in this hiding place somewhere? Amen. And what did the spies say? You can &gt;&gt; just take this scarlet rope that she had the the entire time, by the way. Hang it out your window. And and then she asked the question, "Is there room for more than just me in this hiding place?" Absolutely. Get your parents in. Get your children in. Get your get your relatives. Who whosoever will get them under this hiding place. So the hiding place had room for whosoever will could fit into her house. And I tell you what, friends, you allow this the Holy Ghost to create an atmosphere around you. Amen. It will bring an influence of God upon people's lives that they will want the hiding place that you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. You be salty, they get thirsty. What will they thirst after? I want that hiding place. I mean, I want that same God in my life. Amen. That's why we should be friendly. We should be loving. We should be warm. We should be considerate. Amen. We should be kind. We should be people of integrity. Amen. We should be all those things that people actually want what we have. I mean, but imagine if Rahab went around all all all all sourfaced and grumpy and down and, you know, trying to get her family in cuz they had to line up with this thing. They would never have come in. But she would have had a different look on her face after those messengers left. Begin to speak to them with conviction and passion. Look, just get under this thing. Get into this hiding place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so what did they do? They came under the shadow of mighty Jehovah's wings. Isn't it amazing that uh Rahab's house went from a fourthstory apartment to a ground level &gt;&gt; in one moment &gt;&gt; and the place was exactly as intact as it was up there that it went down there cuz the Bible says the walls of Jericho fell down flat. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the whole world shook apart for Rahab, but she wasn't shaken apart cuz she was in the hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe we can we are in the same hiding place, even a greater one, cuz we got more than a scarlet rope. We've got the King of Kings and Lord of Lords as our hiding place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So what does he he becomes our city of refuge and we can invite anyone to come into the city of refuge. They can let off the pressure and they can realize I can be safe and secure. That it's not a religion looking after me. &gt;&gt; It's not a church looking after me. It's almighty God &gt;&gt; looking after me. Amen. He is my hiding place. Amen. Who's enjoyed the hiding place? Amen. It's the greatest place to live. Amen. I never want to get out. &gt;&gt; I never want to go out into some barren wasteland of a world. I want to stay in this hiding place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the wonderful thing is is the, you know, well, let let's just finish here. I'm just going to finish with this. Maybe the musicians could come. They say, well, what should I do now if I'm in this hiding place? This is one of my favorite quotes. quotes. I know it's one of Christian's favorite quotes. It's from He Swore by Himself. I know I've read it many times, but well, actually, I'm just going to go back here just quickly. Our hiding place is a is an active protection. It's like having the best security detail you could imagine because it's the angel of the Lord, right? So now, we don't need to try and keep the enemy away. He keeps him away. There's a repellent on your life that keeps every bug of hell from you. It may try and bite you. It may try and get in, but there's a there's a thing in you that it just can't stand. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because and then why can I say that is because he is the door to the sheep. He is the good shepherd. Remember, he's our hiding place. Now, the sheep don't need to rely on their own ability to keep the wolves away or the bears, right? They just be sheep. They just follow him. They eat grass. They go back to the corral the next day. They come out. They go out. They eat grass. They follow the shepherd, right? &gt;&gt; He's a good shepherd. &gt;&gt; He's not a hiling. He's a good shepherd. So, we don't need to walk in this world in fear. &gt;&gt; We don't need to fear nothing. And that doesn't mean you got blinkers on and you're, you know, you're just totally oblivious to whatever's going on. No, you can be aware the devil's right in your face, but you don't need to fear him cuz you're in the hiding place. Amen. And it's and and it's God's job to keep him away. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because why? He is the door to the sheep. And brother Bram says this. And the only thing that you can ever do to beat him is rely on Christ. Amen. And humble yourself and let him lead you. See, you'll never do it any other way. You in your intellect just rely on him. He is the shepherd. It ain't the sheep's business to keep the wolf away. It's the shepherd's business. All powers will never do it. I mean, I've got to believe, you've got to believe it. Pardon me. The sheep must stay with the shepherd in order to stay safe. That's my safety zone is in Christ. And Christ is the word. That's the safety zone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm just going to finish with this. If we're in this hiding place, then just walk with that hiding place. Walk with God. He says, ' Listen, I'm going to say something. Look, faith is unconscious. Amen. You believe it. I've learned that in the years of travel around the world and meeting people of all different walks, but faith is unconscious. You've got faith and you don't even know it. That's right. You can be in the hiding place and not even realize it. Sister Bruce was in the hiding place and she went to the prophet for an interview because she wanted to know when did I get in or am I in? &gt;&gt; She said, "I just can't. There's nowhere I can put my foot on an experience to say and and you can read her life through the message being used by God, part of the body, praying for people, all different kind of things. And brother Brown brings it down to a very simple thing. One day you're going that way &gt;&gt; and then you started going this way towards the Lord and and he asked what did it? And and she said Christ. He says there it is. It's your desire. What do you want to be? You want to be a Christian more than anything? Love him. Serve him. What did that? The hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. The hiding place. I say focus on that. You're going through a struggle, a trial, things going on in your life. What's your desire? &gt;&gt; More than a feeling, but what what do you want to be? If you could really just look at your life and say, Lord, what do I want to be? I'm not talking about careers or natural things. What do you as a person want to be? I want to be a Christian. I want God to live. I want to see him prove his word in my life. I want to be a living testimony of his grace. I mean, I want to be a billboard that people would know Jesus Christ lives and he cares and he redeems. I want to be a real solid everyday Christian. That's why brother A said, just go and live a simple Christian life. Amen. Jesus Christ, no matter if he was in the storm and a gale was knocking the boat from one side to another or he was standing in her face, a mess of demons, if he was hanging anywhere, it never moved him. He walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be. Why? He was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him. That's right. Whether it was going to happen, whether it wasn't going to happen, he knowed it was going to happen because God said so. I love that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Oh, is he really going to fulfill his word? Is he going to answer the prayer? That's up to him. We don't need to worry. I mean, we got full confidence just like the Lord Jesus. God said it was going to happen. God said so. He didn't say, "Oh, have I prayed through? Wonder if I fasted long enough. Wonder if I did this." He just walked right on unconscious. That's right. He believed what God said was truth. The words must be fulfilled. And he knowed what he's uh what his life was to fulfill them. That's right. And you're here to fulfill it, too. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of criticism. Walk unconscious unto the world. Walk as you walk in Christ, walk with him. Not paying any attention to the right or the left hand, just keep moving on. If something comes up in the church, walk with God. Hallelujah. If sickness strikes you, walk with God. If the neighbor don't like you, walk with God. Just keep walking on with God. Enoch one day walked like that. You know what he done? He walked all the way home with God. Just got so far up the road, he didn't want to come back anymore. Amen. Walk with God. Doctor says you're going to die, walk with God. Yeah. Doctor says you can't get well, walk with God. Just walk with God, that's all. For God has promised you, I'll never leave you or forsake you. I'll be with you to the end of the world. And he took an oath and by that covenant that he gave you that he would confirm it. Just walk with God. You'll have your ups and downs. Don't worry. You've got to go through bri patches, over sharp rocks, over bluffs, down over the hillsides, up through the mountains, over the waters. But walk with God. Yes, sir. There's so many hills to climb upward. You've heard the old song. But how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way. My my just look at there. All that's been look back at your footprints won't be very much. So just walk with God. Enjoy the hiding place. Amen. Live a life that others want to be in that same hiding place. Being Christ like you are. Amen. There is power in it. If you're in that hiding place, the devil can't touch your soul. Amen. you're safe and secure. So, let's stand tonight, shall we? Amen. I want to sing that song, uh, Speak to the Mountain, I won't be shaking, I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promises are true. Amen. Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? Isn't it actually interesting if you read the story of David and Goliath, it was David that pointed out, he wanted to know who that giant was. Who's that guy? Who's that uncircumcised Philistine that defies the armies of the living God? Why should we worry when the enemy comes against us? They'll fall at our feet. Amen. Let's sing. &gt;&gt; Oh, why would I worry when giants come calling my name? [Music] Oh my God is so much bigger than the troubles I face. Oh, why would I hunger for hours or reaches our way? [Applause] Yes, my God is so much bigger than all of these things. Yes, I won't be sh. [Music] [Applause] Yes, my God is his promise is true. So I sing to the mountain. Oh, it's time to move. Yes, my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. [Music] I encourage [Music] Hallelujah. Yes. My God is gater. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. Our God is faithful. His promise is true. Trust me to [Applause] Oh, it's time to move. [Music] My God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Yes, I won't be sh. I won't be. [Music] My God is faithful. His promise is true. I speak to the mountain. [Music] [Applause] It's time to do. Oh my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. [Music] There's no mountain to hide, no valley to go. There's no fear that I have, nothing. There's no problem to me. There's no weapon to strong. There is nothing for God that's impossible. There's no mountain to hide, no valley to low. There's no fear that I have. He doesn't already know. There's no problem too big. There's no weapon too strong. There is nothing for God that's impossible. [Music] So I won't be shen. I won't be My God is faithful. You are Lord. Your promises. [Music] Hallelujah. So I speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Amen. I speak to that mountain, it's time to move. Brother Brandon says, "When you speak to your mountain, there may be one insignificant grain of sand begins to roll, but that mountain is moving." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, you got to, you know, I felt maybe it was a bit out of balance. I said you just eat. You just follow the shepherd. The Lord wants to use you to speak. Amen. He is the shepherd. He's the hiding place in you, right? You just trust he will take care of all things. But he wants to use your lips to address your enemy. Amen. In the right time, right? So you just walk with the Lord, feed off the word, trust in the Lord. But there's a time you say, "Mountain, be gone in the name of Jesus Christ. We put up with you long enough." Amen. Why? Because there's power in this refuge. this power in this hiding place to conquer every enemy. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's let's just bow heads in a word of prayer. Just say, "Thank you, Lord. Are you glad your life is hid away? No matter what you're facing, what you're going through, you say, Lord, I'm so thankful you brought me into the hiding place." Well, how did I get it? I repented. I was baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I received the hiding place, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Aren't you thankful for that tonight? Amen. Gracious Father, thank you, Lord. We're not hidden behind some in some cave somewhere, some bunkers in Iran, some man-made structure to try and keep the enemy out. Lord, we ain't hid in that place, dear God. We're hidden in in you, Lord. Hallelujah. Lord, under the shadow of your great wings, Lord, you've lined, Lord, you've lined our hiding place with your feathers, oh God. Lord, that we can be safe and secure, dear God. That Father, behind your word, that no weapon of the enemy, no missile, nothing he could devise can get us in that hiding place, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord, we can say that our lives are hid in Christ. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We praise your holy name. I pray, dear God, that when we go out these doors, may we have greater confidence, Lord, in our hiding place in you, Lord. Father, because you said a man would become a hiding place, Lord. You're that hiding place for us, dear God. And may we be so thankful, Lord. Lord, may we just have such a burden, Lord, realizing there's room in the hiding place for others, dear God, for whosoever will, Lord. So may we just live a life that people want to come into the hiding place. Granted, dear God, come into Christ. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this night. We praise your holy name in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you, friends. Uh brother K, I'll turn the service to you. You want to sing a couple of songs. God bless you.

We have a testimony from Sister Maki. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Ka. Um, I wasn't going to come up here and say anything. Um I was just going to put a text message on the brothers and sisters but um what brother Ben said at the end encouraged me to come up. Um so few months ago I asked for prayer for my parathyroid gland. Um it's been quite the levels are high and it affects my calcium levels. It's all to do with my kidneys. Um, and they the doctors had I had met with the surgeon and they were pressuring and talking about cutting out the gland. Um, but with the chances of not having to have the surgery if I had a transplant before then. Um, so I kept kind of pushing it out hoping a transplant would come, but then the levels went over 100 and the medication w wasn't bring it down. So, um it looked like likely that I was going to have a surgery soon and um had prayer up the front and then uh had a blood test at the start of the month and it's I got a call today and it's come down from 100 to 43 which is quite a big difference and they basically taken me off the surgery list. So that was a great answer prayer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a miracle working God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can just stand once again. We just sing one more song. Let's do a fast song. Yeah.
