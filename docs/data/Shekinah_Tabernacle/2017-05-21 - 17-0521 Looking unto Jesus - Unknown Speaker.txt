put the sound disc in the back so we like to thank brother Aran sister Shantel putting a lot of hours Brother Andy came for an evening and there was halfway through it we thought are you sure this was a good idea but thank the lord it's done but we wanted to move it so we could have um more room and that we could um sorry I just got to grab an iPad need to need some traffic signals or something um you know because um we need room to grow and I believe we are this is it's not us forign no more it's us for and whosoever will let them come so you know we we need room amen so if you got your handy let's just go to um Romans chapter 1 and then we'll go to Hebrews chap 12 again Romans 1:18 and then we're going to go to um Isaiah 59 so all of this may seem a bit of a contrast but I just want to um just lay out a few things I want to take a part three of let us run and I want to take a if I can take a subject about looking unto Jesus I we'll see here what man has done and I'll show you let's just read here Romans 1 and from Verse 18 it says for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that which when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were they thankful and became vain in their imaginations and their foolish Hearts was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the incorrupt able God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and forf footed beasts and creeping things whereof God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their woman did change the natural natural use and that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their and their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was met and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness deliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit uh malignancy Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them amen and let's just go to um Hebrews 12 I know that was quite a mouthful but we're going to break it down um a bit by the Lord's help Hebrews 12:1 it says wherefore seeing we see we also are en ENC compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen and then let's just go to Isaiah 59 just I'm sorry to keep you standing so long but we just go to Isaiah 59 and we'll go to verse 19 and then we're going to read into Isaiah 60 as well and I I'm sure this is familiar to um to us all so Isaiah 59 and 19 it says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayith the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayith the Lord from henceforth and forever arise Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising amen may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats so we read quite a a contrasting group of scripture there where in Romans chapter 1 we read that they that there was a people at one stage they knew God God was revealed to them they were not and and they knew exactly who God was but then they changed because they did not retain God and their knowledge in their you know in their mind who he was then they change what they worshiping from who he was as a person to the creation am mean so they fashioned something that substituted God to be you know from from God who he really was to another God right and so this scripture is is actually quite incredible because many times we you know we have read Romans 1 and no doubt when you've read it you think maybe of Before the Flood where God walked with Adam and Eve and then God you know revealed his Plan of Redemption but then it didn't take very long for man to walk from from from Eden till finally God was grieved in his heart that he made man and he wanted to wipe out the whole whole uh creation because they turned themselves they they fashion Idols out of what they saw upon the Earth and they did not retain who God was in them in their in their minds right and so now these people that Paul is speaking about is actually not just back there but is today there's a people there this scripture has been fulfilled in our generation right because you can take or even you go back in Jesus's day you know you read Here Comes Here Comes you know John writes that we've beheld eternal life we've we we're actually taken hold of it first John 1 you know the eternal life that was with the bosom you know the bosom of the father we have beheld amen and then so here was a group of people that actually saw God as the as he was because Jesus was the image of the invisible God so everything Jesus is amen is who God was the invisible one so he became known in Jesus Christ right so everything he liked you saw it in Jesus everything he despised you saw it in Jesus how he treated the sick how he treated the Lost how he treated the demon possessed how he treated the religious people amen whoever it was the proud how he treated them the humble and lonely how he treated them amen the SOP phenician woman came to him Gentile came to him you know she had a daughter that was grievously vexed by a devil and then so you know and and she tried to approach him the wrong way son of David have mercy on me but to her he wasn't he wasn't son of David because that's to the Jews but he said oh Lord have mercy and then and then but then Jesus said to her you know said it's not meat to give the you know the bread to the dogs and then that word dog means someone of impure mind and she didn't actually she just said yeah but the crumbs fall under the table and the dog still get it and and she marveled at he marveled at her faith and she received because she came in humility right she came in humility Lord help me help my need she didn't think she was anything and she received what she needed amen but the scribes and Pharisees the proud and the Arrogant ones who had taken who had taken the you know Moses and his word and corrupted it what did he do you bunch of wi of walls you know woe unto you pronounced you know those woes in Matthew 23 and it's interesting because history in my Bible tells me that when when Israel was taken from from the promised land they went with they went with the Torah that's all they had they went into Babylon and then they came out of Babylon and they had the scribes and the Pharisees they had all the ritical ideas they had the synagogue so going into babon being being sent into Babylon God sent them there but they brought all the stuff that was not in the word originally amen and so now friends we have been called out of Darkness we have been called out of a spiritual Babylon it doesn't matter if you living if you're an atheist or you're in a church God had to call you out am mean God had to speak his word and you heard his word and something said I'll Follow You Lord wherever you're leading me and so he so so he's called us out but then the challeng is now that Babylon or what we' have once believed has to be taken away amen because we don't want a fashion and and I'll show you with we're going to do a quick study through bethl bethl started maybe maybe we'll just go there now let's go to no actually yeah let's go to Genesis chap 28 and then we're going to jump back to Romans 1 but bethl bethl started as an incredible place and this is the story if we go to Genesis 28:13 we read here that Jacob had an incredible visitation at bethl now this might you know this may seem a bit heavy to begin with but then it's going to turn Okay so just just just bear with me right so now bethl it says here we you we'll read from verse 13 and behold the Lord stood above it so this is when he has the dream and he no let's go to verse 12 sorry and he dreamed and behold a lad was set on the earth and the toet reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of a um Isaac a land on thou liest to to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shal uh spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and I behold that I am with thee and will keep thee in all in all places where thou goest and I'll bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of and Jacob waked out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in the place I knew it not and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven so here he was he has this incredible visitation he says this is a dreadful place this isn't an incredible place this is a dreadful place he didn't know it was the Gate of Heaven right he didn't know that this would happen when he laid his head down that night upon that stone he didn't realize this was going to you know he didn't know this was going to happen and then he woke out of the stream he said this is a dreadful place and he called it bethl the house of God so this was the Gate of Heaven I'll put it this way you know this was the entrance to Heaven repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you will enter into the Straight Gate right but then now we'll see what now bethl we'll see what maned to bethl right so let's go to so this this is what Jacob said of it now this is the first generation amen and then we drop down there and it's not too far well I guess it is a few hundred years afterward but we go to First Kings and 12 and 25 and we see here jobal who's an Israelite now remember and and I and I have to go back and talk about the definations but remember they didn't retain God in their knowledge right that's why they went from worshiping the incorruptable god to worshiping something they made cuz they did not hold him in their knowledge so the as a Generations went on the god that revealed himself to the first one these other ones forgot really who he was okay First Kings 12:25 then jeroboam built built um sheim and Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from F and built pineal and jbam said in his heart how shall the kingdom return now shall the kingdom return to the House of David if if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto um rabom king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rabom King of Judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two carves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought pardon me thee up out of the land of Egypt and he set one in bethl and he put the other in Dan and the thing became a sin for the people went to worship before one even unto Dan right so he built now so bethl Jacob said this is the house of God this is the Gate of Heaven and then so a few Generations down the road has one of his natural lineage comes upon the Earth and he says now remember a gate is an entrance right so when you go onto a gate you expect what am I going to find there and then so builds this golden calf cuz when he doesn't want them to go to Jerusalem but he's actually saying to the people this is the god you'll find at this gate are you following me this is the image of the god you'll find if you go into this gate and so man had changed bethl God didn't change it man changed it right because they didn't retain they didn't remember what God was in you previously now and then we'll go to Amos Amos 5 and5 I'm just going to read these two more scriptures because here's a Gate of Heaven and then they put this Idol here and then Amos prophesies it all it'll it'll be destroyed right so Amos 5 and5 but seek not bethl nor enter into gilgal pass not to basba before gilgal shall surely go into captivity and bethl shall come to N Seek Ye the Lord and you shall live least he break out like fire in the house of Joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in bethl so here's the prophecy it'll come to not now why did it come to not because of what there's nothing wrong with the place until what man did with it right there's nothing wrong with the word there's nothing wrong with this or the message until What man does with it amen that's why we must we must have the mind of Christ I me that the same mind that was in the prophet or the same mind that was in the apostles all the Believers down through that mind must be in you amen that when you receive the word you don't fashion it into something that it isn't right amen now let's go to let's go to Romans uh back to Romans 1 again now because we live in a you know we live in a day we live in a day the son of man's being revealed again as it said in Luke 17:30 even thus in this day the son of man shall be revealed and Jesus Christ the son of man was revealed it was was n a prophet making himself known it was Jesus the word declaring himself so here was God manifested in a redeemed son amen here was here was everything you know that same Jesus that we read about in the gospels his body remember we're going to meet him in the air right we're going to meet him physically in the air right but he didn't have to come to Earth in a in that body CU he'd already redeemed us but he took a redeemed son he took someone who was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to World speaking lies just like us amen someone had to give their life over surrender their will amen accept the blood of Jesus Christ and be transformed he took that man amen and he stepped into that man he declared himself right but now we have come down 50 odd years down the road and so they beheld we beheld eternal life this generation has beheld eternal life manifested in in a man right but because they did not glorify him as not the prophet now but the one revealing himself the word through him because they did not glorify him as God God turned them over to Darkness amen now this Romans 1 has repeated itself in this day and hour this generation you know the thing is though you know we have to understand here we are I was born in 1985 this world was already in darkness in 1985 I was born in an age where God has pouring out a pre-tribulation judgments where the world is the world has already fallen apart I was born into it when the world is already fallen apart so my frame of reference is this is normal without God you say actually this is how it should be so then God has to come and actually has to take you back into his word and say this is not how it should be friend amen this is not how you should be thinking this is not what you should be doing am mean you should be loving me and once you fall in love with him it's easy amen you just fall in love with him and give your will over I mean that's the greatest thing because Here Comes God Jesus comes in flesh he comes to he came to his own here the challenge was will they give their will will they will they follow this Man From Galilee will they follow this will this man will they allow this man to have rule over us and they wouldn't give their will they're like Cain we will not surrender to the word even though God gave them the opportunity God gave Cain the opportunity they wouldn't give their will over and then was what 7 uh ad wasn't that long after when Jesus said Jerusalem's going to be destroyed 70 years later maybe I might be getting it wrong Titus comes in you know actually he actually besieged the city three times first two times he had to withdraw and go deal with some other enemy then he came in and then it was the Passover time he just let them all come in and as prophesied it was going to happen and then he just annihilated the place why what happened because they would not had that man crucify him we don't want him to rule over me we don't want him to rule over us because I'd rather worship their own self right they'd only they'd rather worship what they would rather want to do than worship Him amen the god of self is a very prevalent God in this day and hour amen it's all self you know you go to any bookstore self-help books so I can help myself so I can improve myself the whole world every facet of your life you can improve it yourself and you just pan it to your own worbs amen what's happening now you've made yourself a shrine you prostrate yourself I trust you're not in that bracket but people do unfortunately and they're slaves to it amen Romans now so Romans 1 and 21 because when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish Hearts was darkened so when they knew him this world Yo God has declared himself you just take one message you just listen to the prayer line and and God just comes down every heart is naked before him there's no you know the devil hides in secret and you know you should know that if that same God can expose people back then to set them free he sure can do it today amen amen because the spirit of God that same God back there in the you know 1965 is the same God today doing the same thingsall so now this word is going to break this down now so their imaginations they became vain in their imaginations now this word imaginations means actually an eternal internal discussion so something you actually discuss you have a conversation with her in your own mind right and it's a consideration or it's a debate or a dispute so your imagine you actually they actually begin to reason have an internal conversation but because they because they were vain in their imaginations they turned it down right so there remember our internal discussion should always be this amen because we have to remember I'll get to Hebrews 12 looking at to Jesus remember they they stop looking unto Jesus they stop looking unto him because if you look unto him you're your imaginations will not be vain amen because remember we are his workmanship we are we are the work of his hands amen right but if we think anything less than that then our imaginations will become vain because then human reasoning comes in right and man always tries to shrink away you know they don't want to let go and let God have his way amen now now this word imagination no sorry and then Ro and then so and then Romans uh 1 and 28 even so they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient now this word knowledge actually means a recognition or a full discernment or an acknowledgement okay so they didn't so in their knowledge so they didn't give a full recognition this is God revealing himself okay and I'm going a bit laborious but I want this to sink in real real deep I want it to real sink in deep and so now so they didn't retain God they didn't fully they didn't retain what did they think what did they think of the days of Noah oh it's just a man building a boat he's got a woodwork project he's just gone a bit crazy on it you know you know they didn't they didn't retain it in their knowledge that the God that sent their forbears out of Eden that made all things amen because he's a god of judgment he's a god of Mercy but he's a god of judgment amen because the cruelty of sin has to be dealt with and it was dealt with at Calvary where God poured his wrath out upon the man Christ Jesus the Wrath you should have received he was poured out on our lamb amen it wasn't just a nice happy kind of sedate death in a hospital bed God's Wrath was poured out upon Him Hallelujah because sin had to be judged Hallelujah and we might come to that more later but so they thought Noah he's just a crazy man building a boat but his children because he kept laying the vision in front of them and you know and we'll come to that but he kept saying that look this is what God showed me this is what God is going to do we have to start building and they had to they had to walk in faith they had to it it couldn't been a secondhand Revelation to them he following me don't despair am mean don't despair right and so it had to become real to them and it did Hallelujah this they in their knowledge now now this word so and going back to verse 25 who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen now this word creature it means an original formation that is a thing literally or figuratively a building a creation a creature or an ordinance now an ordinance is something you do so they serve the form they begin to serve the form more than the one that the forers used to approach right and so now if I bring it on right on down home to 2017 people will serve a form of godliness or a form of just message religion right instead of serving the god that sent the word amen that people will be caught up in church as and but missing the one that is in the church amen and we don't want to just float along with the message culture saying this is what Mommy and Daddy do this is what they believe and I'm just going along with it you but it's got to be personal to you amen the god of bethl Hallelujah the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob of the Apostles amen the god of William brandom must become real to you amen because otherwise it will just be a tradition now brother Braham says this in world falling apart in 1963 he says as long as it's a system it's a system the whole system World System uh sorry the whole system's rotten get away from the thing that's exactly what we've got to do before it ever comes back you might not believe that but this is taped listen added a few years from today if there is such a thing you'll know whether it's true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking it's too late then you'll say well uh that man could have been right it's too late then just exactly what Jesus said when he come to the Earth he said God had sent them prophets down Through the Ages and every time their world system would fall apart their religious system said what did you do with them God sent the prophet they put him in a tomb that's exactly and then about another generation you wake up and realize that that was a prophet what do you do garnish the tomb now he brings it on to Everyday language for us what do you do make a tradition of his life they make a tradition of his life we must never ever make a tradition out of the prophet's life amen we must never just make a tradition this is what he did this is where he went this what he said it can't just become a tradition oh I just listened to a tape because of tradition you've got to you know you should be feeding on that word amen cuz there's transforming power in that word there's healing in that word there's redemption in that word amen so we should be feeding on it amen but don't let it become a tradition whatever you do oh it's Easter again don't let it become a tradition Hallelujah as should be thank you God this is the time we set aside remember every day is a Resurrection Day Hallelujah we say thank you God we can have a special season we remember what you did for us amen or when he was born or whatever it was but we should never let it become a tradition and that's what they did amen so now let's go down to now we're back in we're back in Romans and it says here now so so they didn't retain God in their knowledge and they worshiped the creature more than the Creator and then now he lists all these things we've read and we said upon the Earth amen we see Sodom Gomorrah out on the streets but then it comes down to verse 32 who knowing the Judgment of God they uh that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but imp pleas in them that do them and then in my Center reference says also consent with them that practice them amen so they actually look upon these things they might not do them themselves but they consent or they have PL pleasure in watching people do these things amen that's why you know it just has to come down to Real Simple Truth anything that is not of God you know this what happens Hollywood has an agenda right it has an agenda it'll Entertain You And in the Love Story there's something slips in underneath and it begins to change your thinking right it Chang it changes your attitude towards things but this person's such a nice person you know and it and it has an agenda because it's actually preaching you a a message amen he say well the story is really awesome but there's but there's sex scenes there's all kinds of things that shouldn't it says it says in the Bible don't even speak about the works of darkness right don't even talk about it but yet we'll enjoy this kind of story such a good movie but yeah there's all this stuff in that's ungodly but we be enjoying it because they're watching it amen so you are so you're actually having pleasure and those people that are acting out an act which is ungodly amen you say but it's just a nice little movie who says it's just a nice little movie you say that's awful extreme it's such a gray World everything's so great what's right what's wrong we need to know what what's right amen because it'll because what'll happen now is people they fashion an idol and they say well God doesn't mind if I do these things are you sure you got to think about it you know because that is now because what does God love God loves righteousness God loves us to love him right and if you give part of yourself to the world you know people have I know a lot of you South African come out of South Africa maybe it's a lot like here you go to church you put on your church face you you know your Roasters in the oven you say the preachers going over 20 minutes what's going on you walk out the door and then God has forgotten about you have no fellowship and you talk about everything else well that just really shows what was in the heart of the people amen and I don't I'm not condemning them because they're just caught up in a culture but we're going to go beyond a culture into a reality amen because what you what's on your what you really love you will do amen what you really love you will do amen and now God isn't looking for someone just giving him lip service or just flirting with them he's not interested in those kind of people he's interested in people that say here is my whole will here is my whole heart make it and take and and make it yours Hallelujah that's what he's looking for amen and there is power in the blood I I guarantee it cuz it happened to me there's Power in the Blood where then when you really give your will over he'll take it and it's a joy it's not a burdensome walk it's a rejoicing walk hallelujah amen it's exactly it's not a burden to be a Christian it's not a drudgery for me it maybe sometimes it's hard sometimes it's easy but even in the hard times you say Glory I don't know where I'm going but Lord I'm looking unto you Hallelujah that's what we must continue to do amen because now looking unto Jesus I might just jump there now Jesus now he has been revealed in this end time right the high priest that so so he came out of the Tomb remember Mary you know he said to Mary he said don't touch me cuz I haven't risen remember here's the high priest he was the he was the blood and he was the high priest that could offer the blood for the sins of the people amen he was the prophet all those things and he was King all those things were in him so he says to her don't touch me cuz I haven't ascended yet so he went up into glory and he offered his own blood Hallelujah and then in the Old Testament when the high priest went in and he offered the blood it was for the sins of the people and when he came out the people could Rejoice I say cuz the cuz the blood's been accepted Hallelujah the sacrifice has been accepted for me and so he rose up into Glory offered his blood friends we have a bleeding religion amen we have a power amen this this this must be a bleeding gospel I mean so he send it on high with his blood and then he came came back down amen and then he so so he came out from the you could say from the holy of holies came back down he said to Thomas handle me touch me touch my side in my hands hallelujah hallelujah cu the sacrifice had been given that's right Hallelujah and then after that now but he's not just our high priest but he's our mediator he's our intercessor amen so every day of our life there's a bleeding sacrifice amen there is a man that's been put in the heavens who was God made flesh and he is there interceding on your behalf Hallelujah so now we have someone who is there pleading your case amen because remember God's Wrath that should have fallen upon you fell upon him at Calvary amen so now he's standing in the gap between you and a and a and a holy God hallelujah he's standing in the Gap there saying father forgive them they don't know what they do Hallelujah there's a blood there amen that is present you say what about when he takes the book and he's off The Mercy Seat no keep that will happen now it's a process of him he's taken the book but he's still our high priest remember when John you know when he looks around in Revelations 5 and he weeps because he doesn't see no one's worthy to take the book then one of the elders says weep not for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed but when when John looks now he sees a lamb he doesn't see a lion that's the same person there's not a lion and lamb two individual people right but when he turns he sees he sees a lamb so when he turns he sees a sacrifice amen when he turns he sees the offering that was placed in his place I say when he turns he sees his high priest Hallelujah so he still these things amen you understand people want you know some people they want Mercy to be over they want it to be done and they take quotes and they make an idol right and they actually try to say no Mercy's over oh just for our families now we don't need to outreach anymore we don't need to pray and and seek and save the lost that's crazy why did Jesus when Jesus came into his ministry what was the first thing he did gathered his disciples Hallelujah hallah I need to go by the way of Samaria he was finding the lost he was finding the last of that Jewish dispensation bring them to himself amen so be the same thing with the Gentiles if that same God is in you amen you'll have a burden God save them redeem them get a hold of them amen fill your house not just here wherever they are doesn't matter where they go as long as they birth into your kingdom amen living in this word h it should always be our heart that Lord I want to see someone saved I want to see someone healed I want someone to have a closer walk with you whatever they do with it it's up to them but Lord I want them to have a closer walk with you am Hallelujah that should be our that should be our heart's cry so now he is our he is our mediator there is one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus amen now job would say and we're going to come back to a few things but job would say in job 9 now a mediator is a go between that's what the word means it's actually a go between so someone that can go between two parties and make reconciliation now we know that Jesus there's not two Gods there's not two Lords there's one amen so God himself had to become a man amen because no man was found worthy to do it he himself had to become a man and be born into the human race suffer everything we suffered tempted as we were tempted amen go through rejection and hardship and trial and be misunderstood and you know lose family members and all kinds of things that he would understand your human frailties amen he would he would he endured you know Joseph died between the time he was born and by the time he went into his ministry cuz he's not mentioned anymore right his own family didn't really believe him amen he was rejected by the ones he came to save amen you know he was you know as a 12 year 12y old boy he went into the temple when they went to Jerusalem he didn't go look at all the stuff that boys would normally look at he went to the temple and not only went to the temple he' opened the Bible and he talked to them about the scripture he wasn't a normal kind of child amen so he would have been made fun of he would have been picked off you know so he understands what it's like what everything we have endureed or endure he knows what it's like amen so but he had to do that because he had to understand what it was like to have human frailties amen because it's one thing to learn about something as I've said probably probably years ago now it's like driving a car you can learn all about the car but it's when you first get in behind the steering wheel turn on the ignition and go down the road it becomes an experience and it's a very different kind of thing so God knew the end from the beginning but he had to put on flesh he had to come down into time to experience what it was like to walk in your shoes amen this is the god remember looking unto Jesus this is the God we serve so he is not he is not a distant Doty Granddad that doesn't care about you amen he's not a distant father that does not care amen he's not indifferent to your need right he you know he isn't some God that cannot be approached amen that is too holy to be approached because the blood of Jesus Christ gives us an approach to his throne of mercy and Grace amen but he understands what you have gone through he knows what it's like to be hungry he knows what it's like to be homeless amen he knows you know he knows everything we have gone through he knows what it's lik Amen Hallelujah because this is our God remember if you do not have confidence in him you'll turn to something else amen you will turn to something else if you do not have confidence in God so if you do not believe that he is able to do it that he understands your need that he he can actually he's walked in your shoes amen that he is a forgiving loving God are you with me amen that his blood is sufficient amen that he is your Shepherd right amen that he is leading you through everyday life if you do not have confidence in him you look to something else amen and that's what they did in Romans 1 is they looked to something else and inad of retaining God in their knowledge they look to something else and they made an idol this is what God really is amen now job 9:24 the Earth is given we have it there the Earth is given into the hand of the wicked he coverthe not where and who is he for my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good they passed away as as the Swift ships ship as the eagle that hastens to the prey if I say I will forget my complaint I will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself I'm afraid of of all my sorrows I know that thou will not hold me innocent if I be Wicked why then I labor I in vain if I wash myself with snow water and make my hands and make my hands Never So Clean yet Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch and my own clothes shall abore me for he is not a man this speaking of God he is not a man as I am that I should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any daan uh betwix us that might lay his hand upon us both let uh let him take his Rod away from me and let not uh his fear terrify me uh then would I speak and not fear him but it is not so with me so job remember they only had animal blood and he is basically saying if there was only someone that could stand between me and God and bring us together this is what this is what his heart desire was amen because you know he did not have he did not have God as we have God right he did not have a living resurrected sacrifice amen he did not have the blood of Jesus Christ he only had the blood of bulls and goats and remember in his trial he only knew give this offering amen cuz God with without blood there's no remission of sin so he gave this offering he didn't know what would happen when he went from this world to the next world he had no confidence that you know that all would be well you know he he offered sacrifices on on the behalf of his children in fear Le they sinned against God he was living in fear he was actually worshiping God out of fear because he did not have confidence you know that all would be well when he comes to the end of the road right and that's why he's looking for if only I had a man that could actually bridge the gap that could reconcile me and this you know you know this angry God but then but then God came down spoke to job and he had a revelation now I know my redeemer liveth he didn't know that before right he didn't know that before and he was a man that was God said was a perfect man right and then so but then he had the Revelation now I know my redeemer liveth and so he could he he recognized that one day the Redeemer would come right a redeemer would come a man would come and actually reconcile me with God hallelujah and he knew amen that he would stand upon the Earth he says in my flesh I'll see God so he had confidence that this now was going to happen this changed his whole life right and it's the same thing with us now when the lamb comes to you you know brother Braham says I think it's in the breach or in um in God hiding himself in Simplicity you know during the start of this um seal series he says if we could just lay aside our own sinful thoughts the lamb would Advance all the way from glory to us I mean speaking of when the lamb came from The Eternity to take the book and so now if we could just lay aside our own imaginations you know you walk in these doors I remember when I was in a I was in a Pentecostal Church you know you know not very long just sat there heard what was going on whatever more but then when I I came amongst Believers then the Mind battles happened then he tried to the devil tries to fill these top two inches up with everything and you begin to plan this is what I'm going to have for lunch this is what I really want to do you know and all this just you just go off on this big train of thought and then the service is over oh the songs are done oh that was a quick service wow it went so fast why CU you're caught up in your own imaginations right because where the truth is you think the devil the devil just doesn't just roll over and play dead amen when you know you know when Jesus arose took the keys of Hell death in the grave of Satan arose triumphant he didn't just wave his white flag and say well I guess it's not going to work out I tried my best he he fights all the harder amen so don't be surprised when the enemy tries to come in and he blindsides you with some thinking that's totally contrary to God's word and you begin to think where did that come from and he tries to make you own the thing you got to recognize it for what it is amen your enemy you know this is not a play fight right there is not some pillow fight everyone's patted up and you know let's just have some fun and we have Hal Time full time that was a neat game that's not like that right it's an allout War amen the devil is hellbent he only has one goal what's his to-do list destroy mankind find God's children and Destroy them that's his that's his to-do list every day that's all he does wake up what am I going to do today oh it's Monday destroy God's children Tuesday what I going to do oh destroy destroy God's children it's Easter time destroy God's children oh wasn't that oh it's my birthday again destroy God's children that's all he does amen he has held B on destroying you right but if we keep God if we know him as as God as his character is right that's what I'm trying to say in Romans they took who God really was and perverted into an image that wasn't God Amen so people will take scripture or take quotes and they'll fashion an idol and they forget who God really is Hallelujah that's why we've got to retain God in our knowledge but now God Moses admonished the children of Israel let's go to let's go to Deuteronomy 6:1 and he says it in three places in Deuteronomy but he tells he tells the families he tells the parents you must teach these things to your children and to your children's children amen when you wake up in the morning speak of him amen when you lay down at the end of the day speak of him amen you must write these things on your door post you know just keep the word before you now the reason that they did these things is because they had to keep the reality of God alive among them that it wouldn't that it wouldn't become you know like Gideon Gideon comes and says if God is with us we're the Miracles he had something in him obviously he has taught in such a way that I'll bring today's language Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so he had longing if he's still the same God where is he amen and it should be the same thing amen that we should teach our children amen that he's a living God Amen that he is the same yesterday today and forever that he's mighty to save he's Mighty to redeem he is our Shepherd amen he will guide us every St of the journey he will sustain us through life's journey amen he is the strength Giver Hallelujah he's our Advocate amen he is our peace that's broken down every wall amen here is our propitiation for sin amen that his blood is still as fresh as it was that day amen the offering is still there for us amen that he's not an Angry God just trying to beat us and make us follow a bunch of rules but he's a god of love and correction that wants to raise us like a father does his children and wants to express himself and reveal himself to us hallelujah that in every situation God is wanting to reveal himself amen whatever you got to look for him though amen look for him in every part of your life and you will see him you Lord hallelujah just look for where he is so they had a burden this was their commission amen let's read Deuteronomy 6 And1 now these are the Commandments the statutes and judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you now I just before we keep reading you see you uh you know I believe brother BR speaks about it he speaks about the Beatitudes and someone gave him a a gift and it was the Beatitudes it was the image of Christ in it and so those be there is the character and nature of God in this is the character and nature of God and so that's why Moses was instructing them teach these Commandments and statutes to your children it wasn't that they would just learn some ritualistic form of religion but that they would know who God really was right now these are the Commandments the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that you might do them in the land whether you go to possess it that thou mayest fear the lord thy God and and keep all his statutes and his Commandments which I have commanded thee thou and thy son and thy Sons Sons all the days of thy life that thy days may be prolonged now this fear is not a um I haven't looked at this one here but it's normally a reverential fear and Trust just not a being in Terror right because you know God wants to be reverenced amen God wants to be treated with respect I mean he you he doesn't want to be treated as just some you know he's not a Genie that you pull out and rub the lamp and say God give me this you know he's not someone that you just is an erron boy you know that just answers our prayers some mascot but he's the true and living God hallelujah amen he created all things now hear therefore o Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee that ye may increase mightily as the Lord God of your fathers has promised thee that the land that uh that floweth with milk and honey here oh Lord the Lord our God is one Lord and brother said the greatest Revelation you can ever have is that Jesus Christ is supreme deity amen he's not a second person of the godhead that's making an idol he is the person amen and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might now if you have the Holy Ghost that becomes easy right because remember he imposes something upon you but he gives you the ability to do it you got to remember that amen amen because if you think because you know people get in their minds it's been in times past this message just rules and it's too hard so people leave that's not a right image amen now the Right image is that God has shed his blood for you he's released his Spirit upon the Earth amen he comes and dwells in your heart when you give your will over to him and then that he lives his word out of you hallelujah hallelujah amen remember it's remember we we just re remember love real love is not what you can give I mean what you can get it's what you can give love is actually a sacrificial thing right so now he gave his he poured his love out on Calvary and this to me this is what this message makes so Supreme it magnifies the cross to me it magnifies Redemption cu the prophet goes you never did it in the first place you're Justified and where was it in the first place in God's mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah so you these things are magnified glory be to God and so so these things they become and so when it when it becomes a greater reality then you love him more yeah and when you love him more you want to serve him more you want to give your life more Lord what can I do yeah cuz worship I I was pondering this worship is not just singing songs in church amen every part of our life should be a worship amen every part how we treat our spouse how we treat our children how we do our job how we dress what ever it is it's just a worship saying glory be to God I'm redeemed amen this is what life should be a worship Hallelujah now um yes and these words sorry verse six and these words which I commanded thee in this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thy house when thou wst by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up amen you should just talk about what bit sure we have to talk about natural things but what should default setting be glory be to God Amen he's redeemed us God loves us he's not an Angry God Amen but he's here to help us through everything hallelujah we're on our way to heaven shouting Victory amen now and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and upon thy frontlets between thine eyes Thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates and it shall be when the Lord thy God has brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give thee great and God uh goodly cities which thou buildest not and and houses full of good things which thou fillest not and Wells dig that thou digest not Vineyards and olive trees which thou plest not uh when thou have eaten and be full then beware Le thou forget the Lord which brought thee out of the land of Egypt eypt from the house of bondage he's saying if you if you stay this way it doesn't matter what Prosperity comes your way you will not forget the Lord amen and to me this is what we must do amen our children shouldn't just it should be more than words coming out of our mouth but my heart's desire is when they read the children's Bible or or they hear something that Jesus would do they'd say that's what Daddy would do that's what that's like Mommy Mommy would do something like that amen cuz they see the same God in print is now actually in in you amen and because that's how remember a lot of how we how we raise our children is actually subconscious amen by our actions by how we say things what we say Amen it's actually training them a lot more than what we say verbally right so now if we if we're going through through a trial and we even though we don't deny the situation we say but God is mighty to help us amen he will he will see us through this or if they're sick and say well God is your healer amen sure brother Bram took his family to the doctors praise God for doctors amen remember he took sister mey she had the tumor that was growing right went to the consultations God had booked in for the surgery he believed that they both believe that God could make it disappear right but they still they still acted the natural way and it was a and it but it changed from a hope so to a it was actually a faith Revelation that he knew that God had would do it ask what you will it shall be done let it disappear when the surgeon goes to touch her am me it wasn't a hope so it became a reality and real faith is not a hope it'll work it's actually you know It's Already Done Right Hallelujah now let's go to Deuteronomy 4 and6 so we should always remember if mommy and daddy have confidence full confidence in the Lord your your children will see it right and so then they will see some conly they'll be trained mommy and daddy turn to God then they'll say well my My Help Cometh From him as well right and that's that's what we need to subconsciously teach them that how we act and how we spend our time right now that now what I'm saying is they they should see our first love should be him and then now that and that will be shown in how we treat our family amen amen Deuteronomy 4 and6 and then that is also how they will how how you how they see you treat your spouse is how they will treat their spouse right because they see an example This Is How Daddy treats Mommy this is how I want to treat one my wife one day when I get married or this is how mommy treats Daddy this is how I want to treat my husband right because actually everyday life and in conversation they pick up what's going on and they may not be able to put it into words but they say this is the example lived in front of me amen Deuteronomy 4:6 keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of Nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people for what nation now remember he's talking to them under the blood of bulls and goats but I could say we could really say these words right for what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto them remember they had God they couldn't even approach him they were at the bottom of Mount Si God came down on the top there was a boundary put around the mountain no one could pass up beyond that and he's saying God Is So nigh unto us but remember the Apostle Paul says but ye have not come unto that mountain where God could not be touched but you have come unto Mount Zion Hallelujah right as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for amen has there any been a people where God Is So nigh unto them Hallelujah where the word of God is nther even in thy mouth amen where that same God dwells in you you can't get closer than that that's what N means amen glory only take heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently Le th forget the things which thine eyes have seen un least they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life so don't let a testimony become common even your own testimony do not let it become common amen we should be more you know to me I'm more thankful I'm saved today than I was when I got saved I appreciate his salvation so much more now than back then I mean I love him way more now than I did back then amen it should get greater it should get richer am amen are you going by feelings no but it brings feelings amen now only take heed to thyself and to keep thy Soul diligently least thou forget the uh things which thine eyes have seen and least they depart uh from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them to thy sons and thy son Sons especially the day that thou s stood us before the Lord thy God in Horeb when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I'll make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire uh un the midst of Heaven into the darkness clouds and I mean Darkness clouds and thick darkness and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire you heard the voice of words but saw no um um similitude only heard a voice see he saying especially that day especially that day when the word came teach that teach that to your sons and your son Sons amen so I say take this this message do not let it become common amen where God revealed his the back parts of his mind he says in Christ the mystery God revealed I'm going to show you what's in the back parts of God's mind that he's had before the foundation of the world and then a three OD hour sermon has preached of what was in the back parts of God's mind amen we should not never take these things just casually amen but we should reverence these things amen we should we should be so thankful remember it says in Romans 1 they weren't thankful that's why they didn't keep them in you know you know in their knowledge so we should actually be so thankful that God would reveal himself in this end time amen that he would speak his word upon the Earth to call you out of Darkness amen that he would declare himself Hallelujah that's incredible it's greater than the days of Moses amen it's greater than you know we read about the pl coming down in the Red Sea opening and you think oh wouldn't that be awesome it's a greater day today amen it's a greater day than when when Jeremiah or Isaiah one of the prophets was here amen I could say it's even greater day when Jesus came the first time amen because the fullness of redemption has come amen we're living in the days of the body change Hallelujah where God would take a man and say this is what I can do this is what my salvation does hallelujah just it's not just that one man is a tradition but the same God comes in us hallelujah and places Us in his body amen amen this is a great day this is an incredible day amen well you say well I've heard those tapes for years go listen to it again amen that's like if they had a recorder in the days of Paul amen you'd say oh listen to the words of the Apostle Paul and we'd all learn Greek or whatever he preached and we would learn that language cuz I want to hear what he said I understand what he said amen you you we should be so thankful that we we we understand English amen we don't just have a handful of translation someplace and that's all you know we are we are spoiled amen we're a spoiled people hallelujah and we have the technology in our hands amen we don't have you know I've seen you know Christine's grandparents they had the big real tooreal tapes imagine a thousand of them you you know you'd have to have a room I want to listen to this today take it out set it up make sure it doesn't become spaghetti you know play it and we have this what do you want to hear I'll I could download it right now and play it for you amen we have this it's incredible God's mind spoken through a prophet Amen to make this live to make this a reality that we're don't just going I don't know what this means and I think it's like this and this is what it says no it becomes plain Hallelujah that we're not walking in darkness there's never been a great day like this day amen what a glorious day so we should teach these things that's why you know just like that photograph there I you know you I've told the children that's God having his photograph taken amen that Pillar of Fire is the Angel of the C that's Jesus Christ in another form Hallelujah and to me that's the main part of that photograph is not the mouthpiece it's the one speaking through the mouthpiece Hallelujah not to take away from the prophet but you understand hallelujah amen and now where were we yes uh and then verse 13 of Deuteronomy 4 and he declared unto you his Covenant which he commanded you to perform even the Ten Commandments he wrote them upon two tables of stone and the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you the uh statutes and judgments that you might do all them in the land where thou go to possess it take you there for good heed unto yourselves for you saw no manner of sim on that day that the Lord spoke unto you in horb out of the midst of the fire so he declared now this I love the book of Deuteronomy it's incredible book but he said he declared unto you his Covenant right which he commanded you to perform now in this day remember we're looking unto Jesus I trust it's in your hearts he's everything I need his word he is his word amen and there strength in his word and so now in that day it was if thou shal I will it was a conditional Covenant amen but in this day it's not if thou shal it's I have already made you it's an unconditional Covenant where he you know it's like in the Old Testament two people would come and make an agreement and then they would write the agreement upon a piece of parchment and they would kill an animal and that animal would would unite them together an agreement they'd rip the thing in half and they and they' take each half and the agreement was if we do not fulfill what we've said we'll be like this dead animal amen and so now here comes our lord Jesus and he makes a covenant between God and man and he's hanging brother B says when he's hanging on Calvary he's writing a covenant with the families of the earth and so here he was here's his Covenant he knows you can't keep your half cuz you're a fallen person anyway Hallelujah and so he says I'll become the slain one which unites us together and then and then he rips the Covenant God ripped the Covenant in two and he sent one half up as the body and he sends the other half down to you amen so the holy spirit is the half of the Covenant which is showing that you are linked with the other half I mean so if the spirit of God is in you I mean you're connected with the sacrifice Hallelujah and so now he is saying now that this is the Covenant he declared unto you his Covenant which he commanded you to perform now it's in the Old Testament but this message has declared unto you God's covenant with you amen are you following me he is he it is declared what God had said would be done in this last days and what he would do to a people amen you see you know you know brother Braham speaks about the sign of the Resurrection he says about people that once in trespassing sins and darkness who once were drunkards and bootleggers and prostitutes whatever more then God gets a hold of them he says those people are the sign of the Resurrection hallelujah amen because they have been passed from Death unto life and it's not them living anymore Hallelujah so when you get up in the morning and you brush your teeth I trust you can brush your teeth and say hello sign of the Resurrection how you doing amen cuz you are the greatest you are the greatest proof the believer is the greatest proof that Jesus died and he rose again and that this message this message is true you are the greatest Vindication people want to say I need to see proof that that you that God exists you say Here I Am case study of one do you want do you want do you want more case studies to prove it you know when they do a you know a study they need they need more than just one amen and so you are the greatest proof that this thing works Hallelujah so now we are living in an age where where man can truly walk with God Amen in a greater way than has been through past ages amen our the reality of the bride's walk you say well I just live and I come to church and but God comes and he speaks to you and he ministers to you amen and this world you see this you see the church you know you just take the last 100 years look where the world has fallen to amen look where it's it's incredible you know and the people living back there if they could see where the world would go they think we got to change we got to stop something right now we can't let it go this way this world is crazy brother Ram said it's just a you not far from Insanity and to me I say this world is insane amen and so now here we are we're living in the darkest age of all the ages this is the most treacherous time to be alive because gross Darkness covers the people amen gross Darkness covers the people but but as we read arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you and then here you are you once in that darkness and then the Lord speaks to your life he lifts you up takes your burden of sin away when you give it to him amen takes your nature changes it and then now you look at the world very differently amen and you're not walking in darkness anymore and the world is falling but the bride is ascending Hallelujah well once you were an enemy of God the scripture says but now you have been reconciled by the blood of Jesus Christ amen and to me that is an incredible thing you know we take we hold the martys in very high regard and we should hey they sold out I mean they couldn't just they weren't living in a day like this day where we could change religion you know like you know in the west I could disappear I could become a whatever you know and there's not a I'd say Stokes Valley you know my my community there's not a community pressure you can't change religion because in a lot of places of the world you can't just change church amen because there's the village pressure there's the family pressure you know I was up in the highlands and you you know up in Papa New Guinea and then this guy pointed this way it's all Seventh Day Adventist and this way is all uh UPC this way is all Catholic that's all this is what it is you can't change unless the Lord gets a hold of you and the Mars were much same way they had to be willing to forsake all they knew it was death potentially they could be burned at the Stak but they weren't half-hearted bunch of jellyfish they knew in whom they had believed they were fully persuaded Hallelujah and so they knew hey this could happen you know imagine imagine if we have a church service you know let's go back to the Roman day and forgive me for jokes but just think about it you know we go back to the Roman day half the church has gone and some new people coming why is this church so empty well actually you know well actually well this half the soldiers got them they're in the arena today you know or you just come in and someone leads us in prayer Lord help half our Saints you have a big long list they're waiting in the arena give them strength help them overcome and this is the religion you want me to sign up to and people did amen they forsook all amen hallelujah they were willing they rejoiced amen because the light the light in their day fell upon them Hallelujah and here we are they were worshiping a bunch of Idols in that day amen and here we are the lights come amen and we are living in a greater day than that day amen and yet we'll let some little thing will some little thing Rob us of a full Victory amen cast off the works of darkness amen cast it off amen don't let your reasoning say well I'm a good person I'm a good boy oh I probably haven't seen in a long time when I started to listen to brother bradam I was lost and undone in the world and it convicted me like nothing else did I just cry and cry and cry then I thought but I'm a good person hello everyone who thinks you're a good person and I had this dream and there was this young guy same age as myself about 21 and he's walking down a long Sandy Beach and he had the little kind of dingy with a um with a with an outboard motor but it was up in the sand it wasn't down the water he was trying to push it into the water to travel somewhere else he couldn't get it to budge and then there's these two brothers natural Brothers walking down the beach he says I'll TR you know we'll try and help you move it it just wouldn't move so so he said to them well you just come live with us then so he lived with them he married one of their sisters then they had children and the guy got older he became a Granddad and he had grandchildren then one day walking along with some buddies at night time and it's just raining a little bit and he walks to across the road and he slips over cracks his head on the pavement and then in the dream there's rain falling on his face gently you see blood coming out the back of his head he smiles to himself he knew he dying but he says I've lived a good life he changed from a normal looking old man to this really evil evil looking fellow you know with these needle teeth and things and there was all this quick scenes of violence through his life ripped the throw out of a person you know terrible things and then there was like a globe and people who looked exactly like him walking out upon the face of the Earth and I woke up and a voice said to me and you and he thought he was good what about you I hadn't killed anyone I hadn't ended up in jail I didn't do hard drugs amen I was a normal student society would say well he's just a student I thought I was a good person amen he thought he was a good yeah yeah so you can't you know you can't just don't reason in your imagination but I'm morally good hey we're born lost but you have to realize you're lost in order to be found amen and even if you recognized hey I'm lost you're a blessed person cuz there's multitudes who don't even know they're lost hallelujah amen so don't just don't just reason it away I'm a good person you got to look unto Jesus amen I think we'll just maybe we have some musicians to come but remember don't just reason away well I give I give Sunday mornings to God and maybe a Wednesday night or maybe I read my Bible read the family altar you know don't just and then I do everything else you got to give everything right you can't just give part of your life it's got to be all of your life amen because how else you know if the martys could do it we have a power in this Blood amen we have an overcoming power brother Braham says he says about how we you know hold the martyrs in such high regard but yet we belittle the faith we have to overcome every day amen because this is a dark World friends but if you keep looking remember he's your high priest amen he's your mediator he's your guide he's your comforter he's your comforter in times that are hard amen he's your Shepherd you got to look under him remember he's your word if you have a question and you don't know where to go look into his word you'll find it on tape or you'll find it in the scripture cuz God will min or you'll find it in the ministry whatever it is or in Fellowship but God will give you an answer and you don't need to guess maybe this is what he's saying he will he will tell you and you don't need to guess it amen you know it's like that dream I don't have to guess what that means God says that he thought he was good what about you yeah amen very simple things but you know you don't have to guess at it God will tell you right so we got to keep looking unto him because this is a dark hour so friends we'll take the opposite of Romans 1 because when they knew God they were thankful they kept them in their knowledge their imaginations were not vain what's not a vain imagination God you always is right your word is true change me to match your word that is not a vain imagination that's a wise person am mean a wise person always says Lord you always right and you always know what you're doing and you're in control of my life doesn't matter what pressure comes on you can always say God you're in control thank you Lord hallelujah mold and shape me to your image that is a good imagination amen and so those people just take the opposite of rans what now those people did not God did not give them over to their Darkness amen and they did not do those things with themselves between themselves but they lived a holy Pure Life Lord hallelujah and they rejoiced in the truth amen hallelujah I trust I can say we're one of them amen amen let's read well I just want to read one more thing now there's a position in Christ in 1960 every man he knew by for knowledge therefore if he by for knowledge knew who would be saved and who would not be saved he could predestinate the word's not such a bad word after all he could predestinate because he knew who would or who would not therefore in order to catch those who he would he made a propitiation for their sins oh if we could just wait I'll just stop here people say oh but God's never done anything for me when John pointed out the lamb he says here's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen so he died for everyone right he died for everyone's sin right but we have to receive we have to accept his sacrifice because some people say well God's never done anything for me while you were yet sinners he loved us and died on the cross and he died for the whole world but he knew who would accept the sacrifice amen so he's already done something for me glory amen oh if we could just uh we want to get um he predestinated us to eternal life not that those who would lay aside everything and no matter how indifferent it would look towards the children of the world it wouldn't mean one thing to them because they were children of God and he called them and He sent Jesus that his blood might be an atonement a blood atonement to make a propitiation or exceptions or a cleansing a cleansing process to continually not just one time at one Revival but ever living making intercessions that the Christian has kept clean day and night there is the blood of Jesus Christ that then makes an exception um on the cross there up in the presence of God that cleanses us constantly day and night from all sin and we are safely tucked in tucked in how by the Holy Spirit into the body of the Lord Jesus and safe Hallelujah we have a we have an atonement amen but you've got to accept it as a pardon right so you've got to accept it that this is your pardon from a world of darkness and being being lost but it's it's your pardon that you can be passed from Death unto life amen amen should we just stand shall we you say well my walk's pretty rugged at the moment I don't know how Victorious I am you have a high priest you have a sacrifice amen got to keep looking unto him in this dark world Amen let's just sing let's sing that song the blood will never lose its power [Music]
