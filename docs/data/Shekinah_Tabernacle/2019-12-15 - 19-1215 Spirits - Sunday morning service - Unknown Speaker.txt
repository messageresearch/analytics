come into your house Lord and worship you not to this this building here Lord but to you a great throne room Lord the holiest of Holies we can enter in by your blood that you shed for us Lord Jesus you made away with it was no way Lord an we come with boldness before the throne of grace this morning knowing Lord that we that you've paid it all Lord this there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Lord and we want to walk after the spirit this morning what we want to walk by faith this morning not an anything that we've done or any any achievements or any good things that we've done a little bit we want to enter in by faith in your shed blood this morning Lord that then we could have true fellowship with you Lord and the the way that you would desire us to have fellowship with you Lord so we just want to come at the service here we just pray you'll continue to be with us here Lord bless those that are streaming and just bless our pastor as he's and so they figure at the moment we just pray your richest blessings upon them and we just want to commit this some service to your hands we thank you for your presence amongst us Lord we thank you for your spirit Lord and we just love you with all of our heart this morning in Jesus name Amen amen praise the Lord god bless you all this morning I mean it's a good atmosphere here who's feeling good praise the Lord let some we'll just start this and then oh you can have your seats I've just got one one verse to read here this morning and the verses from James 4:7 can we let's get the the it's going up the air brother Adam and so the verse we're going to read here this morning as James 4:7 and I have got the slide there brother Adam and it's on the oh hey Caleb happy birthday brother Kayla's birthday today there's the thought that I've got this morning that I want to preach on as a thought called spirits spirits and I'm probably not going to say anything that you don't already know but you know if you just say a whole lot of the same thing people it seems to sink in our mind and we just enjoy fellowship around the Word of God James 4:7 says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you amen you can take your seats this morning I enjoy preaching it this fellowship because I know you will you know we're all like friends it's just like we're sitting around having a Bible study so it's nice and relaxed that I get a wee bit nervous when I preach at other churches not that I try and do it too often but you know you see people staring back in you you don't know who they're although there are a few here nothing I know most actually yeah so um and you know you you also you know me well I know you well I know your intention for me as good and you know well I hope you know that my intention for you was good you know and we are all after the same goal which is to a to make it to the other side and be to to grow in Christ as much as we can on in this life and I think your intention towards me as always to help me to achieve that and my intention towards you as always to help you to achieve it and and and I need a lot of grace in order to achieve that because I fail a lot and therefore I think in my mum well you probably do as well maybe some you're better than me but so I afford you a lot of grace you know so it's in that atmosphere that we can grow together and end and end it it's a nice atmosphere to minister on you know because there's grace both ways and we just enjoy the Word of God so now now I've just got to relax here this morning because the way that I kind of think about things as sometimes a wee bit different but but I get there in the end okay so so this might take a little funny journey but I'll get there in the end but it's the way that I understand it and and it's the way that my mind thinks about it and so I just have to talk about it the way that my mind thinks about it and and and not just my mind but as I think about things of God and then I read the scriptures and I read the message and I it all kind of it comes together in here so let's hope I can explain it you know so that it would you understand it not that it's complicated but it's just how that that my mind operates and I just don't like this so that's my little bit so I guess that's my disclaimer okay now we're gonna talk this morning I thought is about spirits and we're going to deal in the unseen realm this morning so this is we're not dealing with things that we can see and actually all of the things of God essentially are or unseen you know because the eternal things have got or unseen but brother Branham said this the unseen world is more real than this world as this world is temporal but the the unseen realm is eternal so that never passes away so we're better off dwelling on the unseen things then the same things you know I want to dwell on things that are eternal okay so now we're gonna we're going to talk about spirits and about the idea of spirits and if you want to give a natural type of a spirit a natural type of a spirit is like a seed okay and spirits essentially spirits the way that they come into this dimension is via a thought that's how they enter and it's the same as a seed in it they they you know people try and paint pictures of these spirits doing funny things in there but they're powerless in that way in a natural way that they have the most power when they can come into the human mind as a thought because that's when they can start to take hold and they can then operate as a thought well thoughts then become actions right but if they can't get somewhere into the first into the human mind as a thought they really are very very powerless so we want to just a stable state that so this is how spirits work they they're not like come and get you a new you know it's not really like that they don't have power and that regard right and it's like a seed you know a seed a seed has to be planted in the ground and then when it's in the ground then it can come whatever is in the seat can come out but if it doesn't have ground to be planted and it's very worthless useless okay and and seeds bring forth of their own kind whatever the Cedars that's what it will bring forth so a Holy Spirit thought will bring forth a holy fruit and an evil spirit will bring forth an evil fruit at some point may now look like it at the start like the tares and the wheat you know but at some point it will bring forth the fruit of whatever it is it will show what its gonna read a verse here to speak about that Matthew 7:15 to 20 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them fruits to clear who we are and we can't hide our fruits and you know that I often if I'm trying to get the right and wrong of something I don't worry so much about what people are saying I just look at the fruits of what's happening and that tells you what it actually is you know by their fruits you shall know them and it's a we we have to judge what is the fruit of something is that what the word are against the word if it's against the word then it been the origin of that seed is from hell that's essentially the basics of it right the origin of that thought there's a there's a spirit behind there that's driving in a different way but at the if the fruits are in line with the Word of God the in the origin of that thought is from the Word of God because the fruit has come forth in that way right but we're going to now just go to the the type of different spirits this is not necessarily a Bible study about spirits I'm gonna go a different path in a little while but it's just to establish this fact there's so and in this room we've got the Holy Spirit which is which is God and spirit form which is Christ the anointing and it's it's able to be divided up and be in all places at a lot of different places at the same time Jesus the natural man could only be here if he was here he couldn't really be over there or he was over here couldn't be there but we can have the same Jesus dwelling in each one of us but in different places all at the same time that's the nature of spirit they can't be it can be divided up and you'd still be the same thing with the Holy Spirit can be that the Devils don't have that same Liberty because they are individual spirits like angels but the holy spirit which is just which is Christ so we've got that Holy Spirit as one component of the unseen realm which is easy and we've also got angels which are spirits and God has got a lot of angels you know we get people's come in and try and so thoughts in our mind well they're just fallen angels so God's got angels that are not falling it also also thoughts in our mind right that's has to be the way that it works because these things are still these angels are still there Hebrews suit 1 verse 13 to 14 says but which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies a footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation me you so so these ain't is this aside from the Holy Spirit there are angels around that minister to us I don't know what time it was an angel which time was the Holy Spirit but this is what the Bible says about it I just got some quotes here from brother Branham says when you come now people come and just think what if you could step over and open up the gates of heaven look down in there there's people sit right on them same benches we use it you see they're the same opportunity that you have mothers and daughters are weeping fathers and mothers holding each other's hands won't you come you're invited now Christians today we believe that the Holy Spirit's going to fall in here in a few minutes it's a great isn't this wonderful can't you feel their friends day at heaven the atmosphere around the people now angels of God mingling near I think the Angels probably enjoy when people are worshiping and they want to come down and worship as well see God always had ministering spirits I believe in him I believe in ministering spirits sent forth from the presence of God the Holy Spirit ministers lead the church guardian angels that watch over us the Angels always behold the face of my father which is in heaven is that right daddy and angels you know we think there's some sort of eerie fairy thing well the eerie fairy people that doesn't belong to them it belongs to us angels watching over me brother Branham said there's that young children ends disabled people have a special angel to watch over them and wind brother Billy Paul got very angry with his little son that kept on coming in and he go away brother branham said you offended his angel think about it now I want you to know that the angel of God has no more to do with me that it is to do with you then it's an angel sent down from heaven and if you don't believe angels are ministering and if you don't believe angels are ministering spirits in from the presence of God then you don't know the Bible yes sir I've just got a few more of these here some time ago a minister told me see brother Brown there's no such thing as seeing angels angels don't lead the church the Holy Ghost leads the church I said that's right but we still have angelic beings as ministering spirits sent forth from the presence of God so so we are as much as it's you know we've got the Holy Ghost we still have these spirits I've got these angels I've got one more the doctor said to me not long ago Billy don't you think them people the impending coastal people is just excited brother Andy will like this I said no sir I don't he said well what makes them that's nervous because they scream and holler and go on I see a doctor do you mean to tell me that the nerves can be excited without something to excite him something has to excite them so what's there I said the unseen force of the Holy Ghost moving amongst us it excites that born-again spirit right that brings an excitement to that spirit the power of God foams down through faith comes by hearing the Holy Ghost takes the word spreads it out over the people to catch it with a power that reach indicate regenerated born-again life something has got to cry out right so saying when the Holy Ghost comes down it something happens to our spirit and it it's not just getting worked up but there was genuinely something changing our spirit and exciting our spirit okay so now we're going to flip over to the other side and talk about Satan and and his his kingdom because there is another kingdom that as opposed to the kingdom of God that is fighting against everything that God is right now it's on that basis that I'm going to say that there isn't like a spirit of depression or a spirit of anger as such right because because these these that even though someone may be the priests we say well they've got a spirit of depression well I don't think there's actually a spirit of depression because this these angels before they fell they weren't depressed angels that they were angelic beings worshipping God right and that they were a conduit of the the things of God when they became when they fell they now just become a conduit if I've got that here when they fell they became a conduit of evil therefore if if the word they bring us to bring make you depressed then then they're a spirit of depression but they they don't always stay a spirit of depression you know what I mean or like a like a spirit of anger you know they are just they are just caring because it's a seed right though depression starts as a sort in our mind your life it's not that good for you all these things and whatever it might try and make you do and then if you take on that thought and it grows then it's going to produce whatever they're depressed thought is let's say you get delivered of that that you cast that demon out well that demon make it another job to actually dig sky he might might try and make him angry so he's going to come with a thought of anger right and go in there and and sew that seed so he's not they're not really I don't think they're restricted to one particular job otherwise some of these guys will be out of a job you know they just they change and they go to they just they they bring the thoughts of Satan to our mind that's what I mean by that particular thought however but then Jesus did save this one he said when Jesus saw that that people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto Him they are dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter into him no more so he called there's particular spirit that this boy that was some I think he had but you have epilepsy yeah but now Jesus called the spirit he had you deaf and dumb spirit come out of him and then he was delivered I just want to touch on that because brother Brennan talks about that too but it's not really it is a different dumb spur but it's just making them different um so I'll just read you some of these now if you can get the people to see that it's a deaf and dumb spirit that's a spirit now looky here like I explained the other night if something was cutting off the circulation in my hand there's only one way to ever get that out and that is to release it and then nature will take care of itself as long as that binding comes off well that's the way it is when an unseen force binds the ears or the tongue or some limb of a person now you take people that's bound now it's hard to tell that person may be a Christian right now full of the Holy Spirit of God but yet bound I'm gonna leave there this the quote is not to do with the next bit but he's saying so these spirits can can say it may bind something somehow and you can't and it makes you not be able to hear and brother Graham saying that's a spirit now if you get rid of that then Nature will take his course and the whatever-it-was binding will grow back together you might think that's simple but that's the way brother Branham said it and that's what he did and people were healed because he said this is what it was I'm gonna care to say that but okay here's another quote that same thing nothing if there's a truth here is a person deaf and dumb and there's no there's nothing laying dance it'll all stop that then what corset now here's what it is friends and the light of God's word there's an unseen force the devil which comes out and himself just x-ray won't Sean but it cut off the energy it's a supernatural being sitting there that's cut off the energy from the ear drum now in the way of divine healing prayer faith moves us unseen force and if nature has its right way then their eardrum becomes energized again and the patient can hear and Jesus said it was a different dumb spirit do you believe he was right you believe he knew what he was talking about certainly he did so so in a sense we call it a deaf and dumb spirit but it was just something that was holding the ear there for okay you can't hear so let's call it a dumb spirit but it was just a spirit do you understand like if what didn't hold the year it would hold the eye and would it be a blind spirit if you know what I mean okay so yeah so I've put pictures up here in the air mainly for the children because they if I'm going to preach they want to see pictures right so that's why a lot of these don't need pictures but I've made a special effort the berkshires up for the children so they can kind of keep entertained not that they don't listen but when I was a young fellow I used to like I'm seeing pictures can I tell you something brother and he was going to do last week when he preached can I tell you I'm just gonna children don't be deceived by brother Andy right what he was going to do he was preaching last week and he was he wanted to make slides for the children he was just gonna get a whole lot of random photos preachers sermon and be cooking through the pictures to randomly as he was going along at least I put an effort to make my pictures relative to what I'm preaching about man okay so don't didn't win you over he's cheating it's like cutting major corners okay we've had to get that off my chest I'm just gonna go through this like a Bible study okay I'm not really going to preach in such but maybe I will later on but now let's talk about evil now we just touched on this earlier but all evil begins there's a thought okay that's where it all starts it can't start as a tree it has to start as a thought okay so a spirit of lust right what that is it just starts convincing you that you should be looking at the wrong thing and then if you take that on then that spirit will start to grow and that that thought will start to grow in your mind and then it will bring forth you'll be lusting and then you'll do you'll do it we'll just the longer you live there it will just carry on or all this the other guy this the spirit of anger you know it will convince you that you should be angry at that person because of what he's done and then if you act on it that will start growing in your mind and these these spirits are very rude and gentlemanlike spirits they will stay there until they're forcibly removed they won't say oh you know I've tormented you enough I see you're not enjoying this I'll go this stuff doesn't work like that they will not go unless you make them go but they will not leave they're not gentlemanlike whatsoever and we're going to read from James 1:13 to 15 just to confirm that it says let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished brings forth death so this is the this is the process of how this this stuff works right now I want to get into what I actually want to talk about in here scheana's gonna wonder why I got a picture of her milking milking the cow it was just to remind me to speak about a story that she told me that happened to here and I'm not gonna base my doctrine on a on something that she told me but on her experience or a her testimony however the Word of God and a different way does match what she said when you look into it so when she before she moved to New Zealand things were happening in her life she wasn't a Christian and it's like the Lord was guiding her to come to New Zealand to eventually meet her when she was on were here at a church there but she went through a series of I would say spiritual experiences outside of knowing about God in this journey for maybe maybe over the course of six months but especially over the course of a few months when she was here traveling on her own she was doing different spiritual things and getting rid of different spiritual things that she had outside of God and and I don't particularly know what this thing was that she was dealing with at the time but it was some sort of evil thing in her life what what she perceived as evil and she said she told this thing to go she told it just her didn't know God told it to go and she said she saw a black thing leave her and it left is that what happened yeah okay now this is not saying I command you to leave in the name of Jesus Christ this thing left and didn't come back she was she was free from whatever this particular she knew what it was because she knew she wanted it to go she knew why it was there I think what was it something to do with you my grandmother or I when she was a child something happened when she was a child and she yes so now that seems odd in our mind because we think well we know I rebuke the spirit in Jesus name and it leaves you know we get this idea that that's how these we deal with these spirits right but that's not that's not nice that's not the way that it works it doesn't ever have looked into it it doesn't actually work like that it's there's a different story than that but just hold that thought in your mind I'm going to come back to that I want to let's talk about now casting out wrong spirits okay and how how this this actually works because this will help us in our life to realize that we can completely overcome these spirits every day of the week all the time they're actually very very powerless they're very powerless very very powerless it surprised me how powerless they are it it's it's kind of I've thought about it I've looked into it and I realize you the only thing they've got is all settings God has a bluff and he's got these deceptive but that's about all he's got going for him he's deceptive he will deceive you in a certain way buddy but he's got no no power at all very he's got no power over the human Christian or non-christian when you think when you look into it but he's he can deceive the non-christian in a certain way but the Christian he can't deceive but let's just start with us and they'll end up back there we're talking about casting out wrong spirits mark 3 22 to 26 years and the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said he hath Beelzebub and by the Prince of Devil's castle Athiya Devils and it caught on to them and said unto them in parables how can Satan cast out Satan and if a kingdom be divided against itself the kingdom cannot stand and if it has to be divided against itself that house cannot stand and if Satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an end okay so so Satan can't cast out Satan these scribes are saying oh it's by the power of Satan you cast out Satan and and Jesus said Satan cannot cast himself out he will not do that right I'm gonna read this one this is a this is a story from brother Brennan talking about a minister that was that spoke to him and he said I thought you said that the doctor was a healer there's only one hero that's God there's no the devil's know he love the devil can't heal at all shows mental weakness when you think that Jesus said how can Satan cast out Satan if he could as kingdom would be divided and he couldn't stand he firmly said that Satan could not cast that Satan see so he can't do that Satan can't heal you say well I know a person that's got oh yes but people going thinking they were going to God and doing so get healed so you're saying people get go to other places and get healed he said yes sir but that was their faith the individuals faith in God that did that not the witch or the soothsayer or whatever they went to or the OJ Board or what or what you call the devil and that is of the devil sentence of the devil fortune tellings and with him sends her off the devil certainly as anyone knows that who reads the Bible so there are healings and there are things outside of Christianity but Satan didn't do it it was it was someone's faith in whatever they were doing that caused that healing to take place here is a story I was going to read this is a minister that went to brother bear I'm saying that Satan can actually heal and he said and let me tell you why I know that the devil can heal this is a man saying I live in a city with is a woman that has a familiar spirit you know one of the devil spirits and said people come to her for healing and what does she do but pull some here out of your head pluck some no she pulls here out of her here I believe in plucks the veins and bleeds it on the hair from her arm from the arm and goes down for the river behind her house and pushes it over his shoulder and she walks up and if she is constrained to she has to turn around look at it then the disease remains on the person that comes back if she doesn't see it she tells the people they're going to get well she said we've kept count of it and said about 20% of those are healings he said and then you mean to tell me that you stand up here and have the audacity to say that the devil can't heal he's saying because this is what this lady does and one out of five people get healed that go down there for deliverance from this particular whatever they've got right not confusing at all and it's not confusing they are using faith because remember we have we are gods we have we have faith and our faith if we believe it enough we can achieve anything right we can do anything so these people had faith at all because she turned around I thought that if she turned around I would get healed now she did so the offer I'm going to get here with your faith isn't that but they're just tapping into the source of faith and I see justice straighten you up brother I'd like to ask you something I'm surprised that a Lutheran team would base his theology upon some sort of experience why I said and the Baptist Church the first year of school we learn to base everything on the Bible I said all our theology must come off the Bible and you were here trying to base your theology on an experience this happened therefore this is the case well now I said to settle it Jesus said Satan can't cast out Satan that settles that if Jesus seed Satan can't heal then I don't care what you know and I would say that settles that he can't heal that's all okay so that's that's but we know the dynamics behind it are that Satan didn't heal the person's own faith and believing what had happened caused him to be here but it's like my friend of mine he was he got very sick and they went he was a Buddhist and they went to the Buddhist monk and they they asked him you know why am i sick and that the Buddhist monk told him is because you were riding your bike down a hill and you ran over one of the did priests he was crossing the road and you ran over him on your bike you ran over a spirit and that's why you're sick and he said I didn't I ran over a spirit and he he said you must do this in this and then you'll get well so he did that net then he got well but you see he just believed it because he went there in faith he believed if I do what you say I'll get well but it was his own faith that did it it wasn't the priest didn't heal this is why you can't actually base a true doctrine on healing or you can't base a true doctrine on casting out of spirits jesus said many shall come in my name do you meaning wonderful works you know you you you can't base you can't say with these people right because there's a healing there all these people right because the spirit was cast out because these can be done outside of truth you understand outside of the word of God okay now what I want to get to more so as as this idea here this is where this is where it matters as Satan can't cast out Satan okay but he can convince you to replace one spirit with another now I want to base I want to tell you that here because of the power of choice it makes us far more powerful than Satan the power of choice right when a thought comes you have a choice you have a choice do I want to accept that or not the only way you can ever accept the only way Satan can ever ever have power over you as if you accept it if you choose to right so when you think about it unless you accept that he's got no power over you whatsoever he doesn't have any any power what power does he have outside of that what's he gonna do peace do you do all these sorts of things but what can you actually do outside of if you make a choice No now now this is I'm gonna put this out there and say this is human beings now all right this is not just Christians this is human beings human beings are made up here Satan's down here he tried to deceive you make all these movies and make it look like he's a powerful person he's able to override the human he can't if you choose not to he has absolutely no power he's powerless he's powerless that and that's why Joshua said here choose ye this day whom you will serve as for me and my house will serve the Lord he's showing we have a choice serve that devil serve God serve whoever you want it's your choice and they can't make you make a choice they can try and trick you into making a certain choice and convince you but they can't forcibly make you make a choice right and when you get this thought in your mind the human being can choose to resist the devil because he has made more powerful than him now we're not talking we're not talking now Christians now we're talking humans because we're made like gods right we're made up here Satan's down here remember this because this is now Satan's going to try and trick us chemica medicine a roundabout way because of this concept there's ways to submit yourself therefore to God full stop this is another this is another half of the verse resist the devil and he will flee from you I'm going to say that that's not limited to to a Christian it's a full stop they resist the devil what about some of the gives up smoking that's it that's the devil you you should smoke you should smoke you should smoke get that cigarette that so-and-so's got and start smoking yes you enjoying this it's good you like that you need to have another smoke no smoke smoke right there yeah at one point that person can say actually I don't want to smoke anymore right and he can resist that devil and if he resisted enough the devil will slowly eventually have to go because it's like I can't win this as long as the human resists he can't win he has to be pushed back remember we are like gods we've got where were actually a we're actually liked you know if we even though that's the way that we are so we we can actually humans cameras us the devil and he will have to flee eventually this is not just restricted to Christians Genesis 5:1 says this is a book of the generations of Adam and the day that God created a man and the likeness of God created he him Satan's not created in the likeness of God we are for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God ok so I want to establish that fact we we actually have human beings have power over Satan don't let them trick you to think you don't we hold all the cards here we have all the power he doesn't have anything no man can serve two masters for either he will love the one where I see well he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon now we are although we have this power we are also made to submit to something and we choose what we submit to but it's our choice and so if we don't want to make the choice for Satan then he can't do anything he can't he can't forcibly forces what on us unless we accept it right now just to give you an idea of just how cunning this can be though there's this thought here right let's have this let's have someone that Satan is has maybe they've had a bit of a hard life something's happened in there they're all down and depressed because the Spiritist are that they've thought has come into the embassy well you're no good you've had such a bad run in life because your father left when you were a small and your mother didn't really like you when you went here and did this and no one's really ever loved you look when you went to kindergarten look at that boy in that class picked on you and then you went to school and those two people there picked on you and you know you're no good and you'll never really amount to nothing because you never really had any opportunity you've never been it had access to any like money you know got no parents that your foster parents haven't got money and all these this the spirit can come in and start speaking right and and and that person can take that on and and this the spirit can be entrenched in their life and then a and then if it gets entrenched enough they can easily have bouts of depression the spirit can just easily rule him right by a certain thing would happen maybe they might be triggered by I don't know they they they go to wooden some price some competition then they lose some will look there I lost because I'm just no good but their spirit will say there and they could easily get down into this but about right but that's just a spirit because it all started as a thought right and it's coming in now now that person has power over that spirit this is now this person here is a non-christian person we're not we're taking Christianity above us that person has power over that spirit if they desire to now now let's say one day they think I'm so tired of being depressed and down I I want to get you know I just I don't want to live like this anymore no I'm not going to think that I'm not going to think that they start to resist against it right if it's a name to resist they're gonna start resisting now that's per it's gonna know they're resisting they're resisting right and and they may try and fight it fight it fight it this person's resisting no I'm gonna I'm gonna start running and exercising because it makes me feel good then when it comes on I'm gonna go and hang out with friends I'm gonna start doing these things to try and resist that thought to get rid of this thing okay this is called self help and it's deadly if it's outside of the word of God right deadly I'll show you why he starts to he or she is resisting resisting now that spirit is going to be there realizing I'm actually being resisted out of here now he's not going to go down without a fight right this is the war so now he's going to tell whoever over these demons work guys I'm being pushed out here I'm being pushed out oh you are what's he after what does he want oh he wants to he wants to be happy he wants to be successful Oh does he okay that can be arranged right now this person is a self-help now this other spirit comes in yes actually you can you can because you know what no one else thought you could but you can you're actually very good you're good you can you can do it you know you can't achieve yes no you're not only you're not depressed you're not a loser you're so now he let the same dead spirits of Satan that's that's going to that's the start of pride and I can that's the worst spirit a human being can have that's the man I'm going to get to there that's the most powerful spirit of the sages I can and I'm content I'm happy now this person can self help his way to deliverance from that spirit of depression but but now what's it what's that spirit being swapped with he's now in this other spot where he's now he this other spirit has taken hold of him I can I'm awesome I'm the best thing there is I'm great now when he's in that state now he's happy I'm satisfied now he's got still got a demon he's still got a spirit that's enticed him but now he's satisfied he's in a worse state now than what he wants to start with to start with in the other way he was he wasn't happy the understand where I'm going with us the new way he's happy he doesn't want deliverance now I want to show you this because because this this is what has has infiltrated the spirit of contentment and I'm happy has infiltrated especially Western society that's going around the world to where people don't need God and it's an it's the most evil vicious spirit and when you get into that spot that's almost impossible to break free from that look this guy here when he's depressed there's a chance that God could move in his life because he needs something but but when he gets when he gets delivered and this other spirit comes down and he's happy in this new way because he's the best thing yet now I'm achieving things now he doesn't need God that's the way it is with what these countries that we live in they don't need God their spirit is so entrenched so powerful there's almost no deliverance from it outside of a major catastrophic change in someone's life there's almost no deliverance when people start to be successful I think that they've done it they're very very hard to break now and I want to show you by this this scripture now is showing what happened right when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none he says I will return unto my house whence I came and when he cometh he find us that swept and garnished and then he goeth and take it to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first now now this is not just I for Christian does it this is people in this and trying to get self-help can actually end up they can end up with but that guy is still gonna be a little bit depressed now and then but he's got all these other spirits now that have told him all these other things he's in a far worse estate in a second estate then what he wasn't is first and it's now Satan didn't cast out Satan that person in their own because they were made like a God resisted the other spirit Satan just swapped up with another one he swapped that one spirit with another spirit and as his next state because he didn't swap it with the Holy Spirit his nick state is worse so as we think we improve in life if we're improving without the Word of God without the Spirit of Christ we're actually getting far far far worse and even as nations as nations think they're improving and they're getting far worse they're getting less reachable that's why I say the self-help and self-improvement without the Word of God as an evil it's the most evil powerful spirit that we're faced today because if you don't want to be free how can you ever be free if you're content how can you ever be free what Satan wants is to bind us is to take us through hell see we think that Satan wants to give people a miserable life he doesn't he doesn't want to give people a miserable life now when I talk about the spirit here for a while contentment it's one of the most powerful contentment without Christ is one of the most evil powerful spirits that there is Anna sage I'm continuing happy and I don't need God now they're not against God they're just saying why do I need God the Spirit saying you're happy life is going good for you you'll look you've got a nice car you got this you got that you're happy and I'm going to say people and this age are generally content that we like to paint that the everyone's depressed they actually not actually reasonably be satisfied most of the people I know that on Christians are reasonably satisfied I got my job I can go out after work I can go meet friends at the we can go for coffee we can go do this we come home you know I've got my nice home I've got my wiki and hobbies I do I go fishing I play golf with my friends but they're not all it's not all bad they content and they will live their life continue Satan's happy to leave them can't it because when you don't win Christ you lose everything so if you're in that state you're a bigger loser than what we were down in the dumps you said so don't think because Satan doesn't want our life to be he wants to actually make it make life nice so that we don't desire anything else like this you know when you think about it if you don't like leadership and a country if the leadership in the country is bad then they have what they call uprising they they change the leadership right if there's bad leadership in the country the people uprising they changed the leadership Satan doesn't want you to change the leadership and your life you think about it he doesn't want you to change he wants to make the leadership like you're happy you're content now he's not fulfilling your life but he but if he can make you not what not make make you deliver Christ less life content with a crisis life you're totally lost not us but you know this is why Satan offered Jesus all these things you know I'll make you content I'll make life easy for you and he will don't think that all these guys that have got money you're depressed they're not they're not a few of them are but as a majority I know a lot of them they're not that doesn't mean they're for fooled it just means they've been convinced they're happy I'm not saying go enough that life because outside of Christ is no life what is it like Jesus here what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and lose his soul now Satan won't just take it off you at the end you've just that you have it right to the end what does it matter to him he's got the whole lot you keep it long as you long as you show that you're happy you don't need God you can keep it and just preach that yeah hey preach preach that you don't need God you see what the Spirit is evil evil spirit think about this now if we if we flip it around right the most stable believer is one that realizes that I'm nothing you know and he's everything and and that we need Christ you know there's a humble spirit he's everything we're nothing and and we are led by the Holy Ghost in our life and that spirit guides us right that's the most that's the most stable believer in the kingdom of God when someone gets to that state like John said I must decrease he must increase when you can get to be down the bottom where you know you're nothing and he's everything and it's not a put-on then you're a rock solid and you're someone that God can use you in no heaven to get up and preach from you don't want to you know they're gonna force you up there when you the other way you want to get up there it's odd I want to be here now let's flip that around wrote the most Satan has his stable people and his kingdom - he's got to have his stable people the most stable people other people that they think they're fantastic I'm able but I don't need God they're not Satanist they don't think I worship Satan that Satan's not he's powerless but he's not dumb he doesn't come and black and you know it's not how he works he's the only the only thing he's got as deception as his main tool he's got no power over you but he can deceive you and me that's what he's got so so the people they're the opposite of that the thing I'm more sublime great but I don't need God these people are pillars in the kingdom of Satan these people are actors and people that get in the show and they appear like everything's good and they are generally quite happy they're not all depressed they're not all down they're generally quite happy and they go out and they talk on shows and they do this and the world watches even thinks well that's what I want to be like and it's pure convinces them I want to show you this here when someone thinks slowly of themselves well they've failed in their life when they're that way then it's in that state that they're going to desire a different leadership right when everything's going bad for them and it's they're down that's when they would desire leadership and that's when if you have how many testimonies have you heard and probably a lot of you guys hear that I was at rock bottom and things will go and bear me out I thought no one cared for me and all these things came on and the east and their necks when I turn to God God met me right I was on drugs and I went there and I things were just going bad for me my spirit was broken and you know I didn't think much and I and God met me the majority of testimonies are like that okay how many testimonies have you heard like this I had everything and everything was going well and I was happy with my achievements therefore I turned to God and disrupted all that and now I love worse life then I was happy with before you see when you get to a certain state you don't need God it's the grace of God that gets us to the state right but if God leaves us and we have to all the self-help and especially in this age now we the majority of the people in these Western countries have gotten to this point they don't need God they're quite happy without God that's that's and this is what the scripture here here is about for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh shall help themselves up to I'm on to it I know how to run business and I did this and I hurted it I'm good at sports I've achieved things not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called why because they've gotten so entrenched in the spirit that they they they that you can't get them but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and basins of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence okay this is making sense here you right so self-help we've got the ability to cast out spirits out of our life the human being has a choice they can get rid of spirits every day of the week but Satan would just replace it with a more powerful spirit after they're after that till you're so entrenched right can I just quickly segue real quick I just want to talk about a national spirit just to just to speak about this I don't call and then I want to move on to another another bit national spirit now when you think about a national spirit that's just a main thought that has taken root and a majority of the people therefore it starts to have more of an effect on the people because people that's a lot of the times that's a it's a spirit right but it's just a certain thought this that's growing stronger than other thoughts and the in its in terms of being a from the kingdom of Satan it's an easy catch you can easily catch someone then by their national spirit because the already immersed and that thought from when they small they their spirits are familiar spirit right I want to say this your satan exploits it satan exploits this idea I never got significance here but I want to say this about South Africa the national spirits right it's a in your notice it I don't to pick on the woman there but it's like they sits like the woman near spend about three hours in the bathroom and the and the in front of the mirror before they go out anywhere right they can't even walk outside to I don't know hanging the washing out without painting themselves right up and and it's a spirit it's a national spirit it's a prevailing thought that that's gone on and now it's such it's so easy for Satan now to come into anyone that grows up in that country coming in mind you can't go it looking like that look at all your friends they all look like this you can't do that you have to be like that before you go out you just have to it's outrageous that you wouldn't see it's Satan's exploiting that national spirit as a result he's going to have an easier time to get something like that and get them some other way so he's just gonna he'll say look let's let's not waste our time trying to let's just go with what works he knows that works it's eat it's an easy take so national spirits if you don't watch that they're an easy take for our mind to just get caught up in a national spirit because we're immersed in it you know and that thought can easily take hold but better Christian can actually say no no do you see now we discerned that spirit we say no that's the segue there's the seek that's the word segue I didn't know this I don't know but it's there's a different word that's a segue did you know that no it's a funny word a segue it means when you change topic in a conversation and that's when you go on one of those as for the children I want to I want to touch on national spirits real quick because this this also hasn't this is having that says it has an effect on the world you've essentially I'm gonna make this general but it's not you can't apply this all over the anyb situation but however this I want to show you how Satan even exploits national spirits and exploits cultures and ways he just he's deceptive he's not powerful but he's deceptive right so now the cockpit there are what we have conquering nations nations that have gone out and done quite well and they've conquered other nations kinda like in a school you know this guy's in the school that hey they're they're the winners and there's the other guy said nor the other winners you know they're losers you know kindergarten it's the same way and everywhere where we are there's this whole class and I'm the top and like a peaking order that's the way that's the way the world works and the kingdom of God the way up is down right so the more home will you become the more your elevated you know but in the in this natural world they just work like this then you see you see countries having a fascist nothing it's just like a schoolyard tussle you know same old thing just in a grand scale right but you've got conquering nations nations that are that have they'd have gone out and conquered other nations and they've seemed to have been winners so they they start to get this idea that you know the attitude is you know we're the best team and we want to just go and tell everyone how great we are you know because there's no Satan because they start to win Satan their exploits that affect so they know winners that's why you've got the Western countries this is why Western countries are so hard to reach with the gospel because we're winners we didn't don't need God we're we're all winners we're doing so good these other countries need us they're out the evangelizing to the other countries to make them just like them you know be winners like us you know right anti God you wonder why it can't reach these places with the gospel right it's it's that but conquered nations are the opposite you know this is the Satan will exploit a mentality you know you know start to say this is if you lose in a certain you know if you're a few always losing in life you're no good and they did you're wrong and you should hate them and be miserable and they won't even let you get anywhere so you should be depressed and spiteful they get this whole other take on this other spirit that's why a lot of these cultures there's a lot of a conquered nation doesn't matter the skin color it's all around the world they'll turn to like almost self-destruction just give up well we're just a lot of alcoholics there's a lot of society itself is not good because it's a spirit now I want to reiterate though Satan doesn't like people under that condition we think he does or he likes people to be done no he doesn't he wants people to feel like they're winners because if you're down like that you're a candidate your spirit you can actually come to Christ right when you get to the other place you self help yourself and to like I'm a champion you don't need God Satan actually doesn't we think Satan wants people to be down he doesn't he wants people to be up alright and this is why I said this is why I think the spirits change Tec depending on where they are like I see if they're not a the Spirit is not the certain way it just changes tech you know if you go to a conquering country you don't tell him to be all depressed you know you tell them that they're awesome they're just enjoy it you know but if you go to a if you're if he's in a conquered country he's gonna tell the opposite you know you'll never succeed don't worry about it did it you know he'll go that way but like I reiterate a Satan would rather that they were happy and and feel like they were winners because then they don't need God because I asked us here and this day and age where all the revivals happening where where where is the Spirit of God moving is it moving in these countries where we're the greatest very very few one here one there because they're so entrenched with these demons don't need God countries with a different attitude that a better you're gonna call them I'm gonna call this their your unstable they it's still picking which way they go God can move this that this is this is why God's moving and with this countries with a different attitude this is why Satan doesn't want them like that so all the at the moment you've got this push that everyone wants to be like make all these countries like the West give them all the stuff make them like us it's just Satan to to kind of change their attitude so that they think well we're winners too yeah we don't need any of that we can just we're winners that's what Satan wants people like that he doesn't want people down and depressed because they're unstable and they could go either way sir he but down and the press people get frustrated with leadership they want another leader I don't want to be depressed anymore right now now I just want to touch on this and then I've got a few few things after this now the most the the most lost person I could actually think of as a Content deceived Christian I can't when I think about this category I can't think of anybody that is more entrenched and more lost than this one that that is deceived and because now revelations 317 talks about this and a this is a spiritual type of us also for the world exactly what I was talking about but they assess I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing that's that's that's the spirit that's on this world I don't need anything Christian non-christian I don't need God we don't need God why do we need God we're heavy have need of nothing an ass not that they aren't Richard miserable poor blind and naked but we think we don't need anything and the deceived Christian most of these churches these days are just self-help self-help it just replaces a depressed demon whether the theme and you're awesome and they're lucky as the Bible says I've got a scripture here they're twofold more a child of health and they were to start with they were better off being depressed and staying in their state and maybe having a chance of meeting the true God then going and being deceived by a church and oh they loved me it was it was a great family I got brought in and and and they're sowing into you all these these these demons Antichrist demons which are anti word into your life and all that anti word is growing in your life but you think it's right not you but we think it's right I'm gonna read scriptures for such a false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light he's acting like he's light but it's darkness that's why this scripture is so powerful Jesus says but that's not I be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that has only be darkness how great is that darkness if you think that you've come to the right thing and you've accepted as being liked I'm serving God I'm saved I'm happy but that's darkness you've been then how great is that darkness because when you're walking in the light I no longer have any desire for light I've found the light I'm walking in the light I don't need any I'm not searching anymore I no longer will be searched anymore because I found the light and any honest darkness that's why Jesus is how great is that darkness I can't think of anything that's more powerful on a human than being in this particular state at least that there are non Christian thinking they were happy there's a chance that their life could go topsy-turvy and they could think well actually I wasn't happy I need God what is impossible for those who were once enlightened then have tasted of the heavenly gift that were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing their crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put them to an open shame it's in the state that we can actually reject truth and because we go on that Christian circles right and that the we get a chance the truth comes and we we don't want that the genuine the genuine Spirit of God the Holy Ghost can actually come to to actually meet us and we can reject that and then we just go this other way and we get we still be we're Christian we're still doing these things but we're and but there's no hope for us after that here's the one of 103 one to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you compare see and then to make one proselyte and when he is made you make him twofold more the child of Hell than yourselves you have self helped him and to help he's far worse off them than he what he was when he when he met you okay now I want to get on to this right now on a positive note because we're talking about getting rid of demons and spirits the Spirit of Christ will only associate with the true interpretation of his word because I won't be so simple as to say it's just the word right because if I had a this is my Bible here it's on my phone but you know it's not so much to say the Word of God and just hold up the word of god alloh ders true but but it's now it's the interpretation of the word because people can read the same word and there's oh no that means us that means that no it doesn't mean this it means that it's that doesn't matter here there and interpret it all the way so it's not so much the the word itself that God associates with it's the interpretation of that word right that's why see not just the Bible but the true interpretation of that word and we believe in this day that brother Branham came as the messenger of Malachi 4 to bring the true interpretation of the Word of God right now now God's Spirit will associate with that so now now when it comes now to us now we're talking about deliverance now right any any evil spirit in our life whatsoever we're gonna stalk up in our casting them out you get far worse offer for a few just get rid of one spirit and another spirit replaces it like that happens and people get so entrenched but now we have the ability when we surrender to Christ and we come under his word the true interpretation of his word we have the ability God has given us the ability to remove one spirit resist it and to replace that spirit with the Holy Spirit with his word so that the right spirit can actually inhabit that land that that wrong spirit was we don't hit and the light that's in us is light not darkness because if you didn't have the true interpretation you could go along and be replacing that wrong spirit with an even worse the spirit thinking that's right do you not I mean so that's why I say this here when you think about grace when you think about grace how much more grace could you receive then an option to possess by his Spirit in your life you understand what I mean by that like the the option that we have that we can actually that we can remove one spirit but we know the spirit this word is going to replace their intake resonance in my life because if we didn't know that that's what that was then how could we have it in how could our life become overcome by the Spirit of God it wouldn't be able to does that make you understand it right I'm gonna talk about this for a second then I'm done in about ten minutes right let's now forget about all those other things it's taken now from a Christian a Christian perspective in our life because we all we all our land we're going to talk about our land now our land was full of just wrong evil spirits right mine was full yours was full they just they just come in they just did their thing right but we have the ability to now to perceive those to resist those and to replace that spirit with the Spirit of God every single wrong spirit that's in our life which has thoughts and all these things we have the ability now to to possess every area every single area in our life no area goes untouched every single area we've got every means we've got we've got the understanding that we have all the power and then we've got that the the true interpretation of the word of God in that situation to get rid of whatever wrong spirit thought that it was and replace it with the right one and we can go through spirit my spirit battle by battle and overcome every single thing this is not oh if you do this if you do that this is just this is what we do this is not this is not it might work for you it might not know this will work for everybody this is what what we have there's no I may not work no it does work there's no we can't conquer it all you can conquer it all all of those negative thoughts that just Satan telling you you can't he knows you can he knows that if and as God leads you as you perceive it you can actually say well that's a that there's a wrong spirit that's a wrong thought you can start to resist that and God can show you what the right thought is and there's a battle going on but you're one the Bible says if you resist that you can just resist resist resist resist it will just and you can it will flee and and that right spurt that right thought would just come in and take residence there and there was no enemy anywhere that will that could ever resist that if you wanted to and that this that's how it works we don't we're not we're not defeated we're not powerless we're very very powerful and now that we've got the interpretation of the true Word of God we can replace these first with the Holy Spirit exactly the right thing and it's legible by illegible this is how the stuff works it's little by little Jesus is here I'll see my fear before the end will destroy the people to whom they shall come and I'll make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I'll send Hornets before they which he'll drive at the hittite the K night or the hippo at the K night and the Hittite from before thee I will not drive them out from before the in one year less the lamb become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee while little and little I would drive them out from before the until their be increased in here at the land it's just gonna be one thing at a time God's gonna defeat them but I know I'm goin again I just want to take this slow right I've got about 10 more minutes but I want to take the slow so that so that we and just bear with me for another 10 minutes right because when we perceive how easy this is then it just Satan loses his power when we realize this is actually very very easy he's made it seem like it's so hard it's not it's not it's not hard it's easy right now I'm not saying that all you just had it easy now I haven't had it easy I've just perceived Satan as very once you resist him he just he the more you resist him the more he loses his power and he just been eventually he flees but you see what these things I want to put it this way that the Lord doesn't possess he doesn't just walk forward and take it and go or he go take that ground here that I've just possessed right that's not how this thing works so we possess by making a choice by perceiving okay their thoughts wrong that spirits wrong I don't and by a revelation we think this thought is right therefore I'm going to move forward with this thought into that situation right but but but God won't take that thought and walk in and get the devil to flee and then where you go oh well this is great this is so easy and we walk into it do you understand we possess because we like God's - right but we walk forward you say well that's man doing it well no it's not because because we are possessing with the Word of God because we're carrying it so we we then move forward and we resist that thing but what's with us is the Word of God the true interpretation of the word not not and so then we possess it and in it's ours and as as simple as that and and if we see we can kick out any demon out of our life anywhere any time that we want to the human being can buts the grace of God that has allowed us to have true revelation to actually not just kick that demon out another one replace replace with some other evil thing but replace it with the true Word of God and we're there you know and we and we can and it's as easy as just walking forward just when you see it we need to be warriors you know we need to be excited about a fight say well there's another fight yes we need it get the idea that we want us now I know I'm contradicting myself from what I said before but you know in Christ I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me right I'm gonna flick forward out of these ones don't limit how powerful that you are and the end and take advantage of what we have been given now I just want to point out to you though how this stuff works because sometimes we can get a bit down when things don't sort of change the way that we think they should right I'm going to use this as an example of a wrong thought let's say let's say for argument's sake you always had this whenever someone doesn't see me - you got real upset you know you got upset right minutes and you felt I'm gonna say you felt hatred because if you just boil a little down in fetters hatred you felt hatred against him but we wouldn't say it was hatred I don't hate him I just was upset with him but if we boil it down or if you let that thing take hold that's hatred right so now but because at some point there's otters come on and see it you know when they do that to you it's okay to do that back to them and feel that way against them that's alright and it and before you knew bitter you let their thought come and you thought yeah that's how you operate when someone does that to you you just hate them right that's no that's how your mind started to work and I'm gonna put this old house here like because that's how you're used to always operating that thought kind of takes up residence in your life in it it just looks like this right and you're whenever that situation happens it's just your natural way that you would do things as just hate them they did that no I hate them not happy with him that's how you are naturally doing the situation right and and I'm gonna say hatred looks like this run down it's an it evil anywhere where Satan resides in your life though is not majestic he doesn't have the ability to make things majestic it's all just run down and you know tries to make you think you happy about it but it does look like this it's run down right now now you may you may be in perceive this and think man I shouldn't have thought that about brother so-and-so I shouldn't have thought that about this person that was stopping in front of me of the lights and wouldn't go when the light being green and he I waited three seconds you know I shouldn't have thought that I got so angry right and and you know you know you've noticed thing okay that's the wrong there's something there's a wrong spirit here in my life now you're saved this is not your salvation you're saved right but there's a wrong spirit there and you think okay what would be the right spirit to have now so that's a word right because a spirit is just that and you look in the Word of God maybe you know um you'll think of scriptures love learn enemy or you'll think of different ones like you know if you hate your brother without a cause or you'll you'll think of different ones you'll think okay the right attitude is not to the right thought is to will be patient whatever they whatever you think it might be in that situation you see you say okay well that's the one I'm going to apply to the situation then right and then you and then now you've got a battle on you hands right and you'll say okay now because this is how this is what we do every day of the week and we wouldn't when when when when right and then you then resist that other thought you say no I'm not going to think that and so you resist it and now I'm gonna say let's just put it like this right you could resist that thought and then instance and go right you're gone I'm not gonna thank you anymore I'm not gonna think like that anymore I don't want to think like that I want to think about this now you can probably just kick that demon out there and then right okay but I want to show you what happens in their instance of time because now we're humans your picture looks like this so you see so so this guy here is the spirit but this is sort of the effects he's had on your life which are all your emotions and the way you work and everything because he's been here he's sort of taken up residence and has and had an effect on how you operate as a human but but he was only there but he's just made this here right so now when you kick him out and the sick money is actually gone and yet when the next guy doesn't go after three seconds like the lights you know you want to know what's gonna happen you're gonna get upset because because that's how you've because the effects of him being there for so long is still there that doesn't mean he's back it just means he's you know so don't get people say oh I was delivered here then a couple of weeks later it came back and now no you're always delivered don't think like that because what happens is just like it took this guy time to ruin it it takes God time to rebuild something and to get a new a new way that we think about it to get a new way of operating it takes God it takes our mind time to get to that point you see it doesn't happen just overnight like and when we think it happens overnight I'm delivered now therefore I'm never going to get angry again then we're going to get upset when it doesn't happen that way because that's not how this thing works this works like but because we have let the Spirit of God come and replace that thought with the right thought that's going to take residence it may take a month to three but that spirit while residing here is going to change the way that everything works it may take six months right and I have one over there okay but eventually God has got you it's going to become natural when it the next time it happens it's going to be a strain it's gonna feel like this is I'm unusually trying don't be angry don't be angry because your whole mind is used to being angry don't be angry just and it's unnatural I'm gonna say it's gonna be there you know you're gonna be it's gonna be unnatural because your whole being is angry but you're saying I'm not angry it's not really natural you know awkward that's what it's going to be like but but keep pressing on keep pressing on because this stuff this stuff if you press on keep resisting and the Spirit of God is there neat starts making his residence it will eventually go like this till six months down the track it will happen and you'll be halfway up the road again you think man I didn't even blink when that guy took five minutes to leave from the light you know it will become natural because that word of God has taken root in your life in that area and it's bringing forth the fruit of whatever that word is and a tenet because it's taken root and it's had a chance to have an effect on your life maybe six months maybe a year the in Venice now it's things become natural so it's me the to live a Christian life eventually in all areas if your life becomes natural it's it's actually abnormal to go back the other way you know it's it's not it's not in here so that's this that's what I had this morning that was my thought this morning and and my main thing that I want you to realize is just how powerful that you are and that that if you choose to resist you can just resist and and you can don't look at your land and think all these things that will never be overtaken you know we can think that in our mind sometimes just think know everything Kimmy the Word of God is going to overtake single area it's not somewhere far office not like I know it's just all the time battle after battle you're just gonna want everything and your whole land is going to be possessed by the spirit of god and it's going to be natural you're just going to literally just live a natural Christian life without he's going to have full residence Satan will Bluff you - think you can - no it's higher than that but that's all he's got as deception and to make you think that you can't it that's all he has but a few so desire to move forward then you can let some let some stand this morning I'll get their musicians to come so we have that song um I think it's in C we are able to go up and take the country do you know that one who knows that one you don't know that one well we have this song in there
