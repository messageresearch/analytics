[0:21] out there in the distance I see you
[0:25] standing on the shore you said there's a
[0:29] new way you're fishing that I've never
[0:33] tried before
[0:36] I thought you'd call the shots from
[0:40] across the sea
[0:43] but you got down in the ball with me
[0:52] hey Jesus I Really Wanna follow you
[0:57] cause no one's ever done for me the
[1:02] things I've watched you do
[1:06] hey Jesus I really love who you are
[1:11] the love God a ways to go could you walk
[1:16] with me that far
[1:18] I'm so glad you called my name
[1:25] before I could even say hey
[1:31] Jesus I got caught up in some trouble
[1:35] but I'm not putting up a fight cause
[1:39] Justice comes in the morning for the
[1:43] sinning I do at night
[1:47] naked and abandoned embracing for the
[1:51] first storm you touch my face and let me
[1:55] know my accusers are gone
[2:01] I thought you'd take your place and the
[2:05] judges see
[2:08] but you were you wrote In The Sand for
[2:12] me

[2:23] one's ever done for me the things I
[2:27] watched you do

[2:35] I know I've got a ways to go could you
[2:40] walk with me that far I'm so glad you

[3:06] two thieves and a king
[3:10] but can't they see the Innocence
[3:13] hanging here next to me
[3:16] am I too late for forgiveness would you
[3:21] remember me tonight
[3:23] and with your dying breath you welcome
[3:27] me to paradise
[3:31] cause you could have left me in my
[3:35] suffering
[3:39] but you stayed here on the cross with me
[3:48] hey Jesus I Really Wanna follow you
[3:52] cause no one's ever done for me the
[3:57] things I watch you do
