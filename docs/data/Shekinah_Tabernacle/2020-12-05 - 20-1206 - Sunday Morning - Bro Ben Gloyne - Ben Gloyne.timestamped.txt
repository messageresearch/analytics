[11:36] christian hey
[11:42] i always appreciate having hope
[11:45] imagine living with no hope hopeless
[11:48] that will be awful but i don't know what
[11:50] it's like to live hopelessly
[11:53] because by the grace of god i've always
[11:55] because i was brought up a christian
[11:56] i've always
[11:58] known about the concept of god you know
[12:01] and that
[12:01] of faith and that there is actually more
[12:04] to life than just
[12:08] i guess fate
[12:11] in our own effort
[12:13] [Music]
[12:15] but i wouldn't have it any other way and
[12:19] who's got who has brought up a christian
[12:22] here
[12:24] hmm who wasn't
[12:25] [Music]
[12:27] oh interesting yeah it's hard for me to
[12:30] get my head around not understanding god
[12:32] you know not not thinking
[12:33] like one day thinking well maybe there
[12:35] is something more than this
[12:37] because i've never thought that way i've
[12:39] always thought there is something more
[12:40] than this from
[12:41] my earliest memories but you know
[12:44] [Music]
[12:46] god just takes people from all different
[12:48] walks
[12:49] and places and
[12:52] and we all make up this body of christ
[12:55] from all different experiences in that
[12:57] i was overhearing um sister stacy's
[13:01] conversation yesterday when
[13:04] they were doing a puzzle sisters were
[13:07] doing a puzzle and she was
[13:10] talking about how the you know there's
[13:12] all these little puzzle pieces and they
[13:13] they all have a little place to fit
[13:15] within the puzzle
[13:16] and you sometimes don't know where a
[13:18] piece goes
[13:19] until later on after you think where
[13:20] does this piece go but then you have to
[13:22] get all the other pieces and then you're
[13:23] like oh that's where that piece goes it
[13:24] goes in there
[13:25] and you know every one of us here are
[13:27] all part of that we're all part
[13:29] a piece of the puzzle of the body of
[13:31] christ you know and
[13:34] we all came in at different times
[13:35] different different places to make up
[13:37] to make up the body of christ
[13:42] let's um
[13:45] let's um we'll stand this morning i'm
[13:47] just going to open in prayer
[13:48] [Music]
[13:50] i've had a funny thought this morning i
[13:51] was thinking way back to when we
[13:53] we first brother ben first started the
[13:56] fellowship and
[13:57] we sort of turned up we were all quite
[13:59] young fellas back then
[14:02] i think brother ben how old was brother
[14:05] ben was he 27 or 28
[14:08] [Music]
[14:10] well yeah and i was i think i was 30 but
[14:13] i'd actually just finished running a
[14:14] church for a couple of years before that
[14:16] brother andy would have been 28 or 29
[14:21] [Music]
[14:22] we were just young fellows
[14:23] [Music]
[14:26] i don't know why i'm saying this but it
[14:27] was just
[14:30] who's 28
[14:32] [Music]
[14:39] i've been thinking lately looking at
[14:42] some of our young people i'd be thinking
[14:44] i was your age
[14:45] when we started a fellowship and we call
[14:47] you guys young people
[14:51] how old are you brother jeremy
[14:59] [Music]
[15:02] it's an interesting thought that i've
[15:03] been thinking lately
[15:05] you know we we're supposedly the elders
[15:09] now you know i feel like a young fellow
[15:12] and i can actually joke around as i've
[15:13] been in the message for 20 years
[15:16] but i still feel like a young fellow you
[15:17] know but
[15:19] [Music]
[15:22] young super youth you're actually not
[15:25] really youth you're actually
[15:28] adults like you're not youth
[15:33] some of us we were the super youth
[15:35] running the fellowship
[15:36] when it back when it started
[15:40] i'm going to leave it there let's open a
[15:43] prayer this morning
[15:44] [Music]

[48:44] we thank you in jesus christ's name amen
[48:48] amen god bless you friends you may have
[48:49] your seats this morning
[48:51] i was sitting i was sitting in the
[48:53] prayer meeting on
[48:54] on wednesday and and a
[48:58] thought came to my mind and this may not
[49:00] make a lot of sense but i trust it well
[49:01] but three words came to my mind love
[49:03] fought for
[49:04] now something that's fought for after
[49:06] the victory is one it's treasured a lot
[49:08] more
[49:09] than than before the battle you know
[49:11] sometimes we can take things for granted
[49:14] but when it stands in jeopardy maybe you
[49:16] can stand in losing it but you fight a
[49:17] battle and you get it back that's when
[49:19] you can really treasure
[49:20] you know what you have you know there's
[49:22] a saying you know you never miss the
[49:24] water until the well runs dry who's
[49:26] heard that saying
[49:27] so you take you take the well for
[49:29] granted you take the flavor of the water
[49:30] for granted take the
[49:32] take it for granted you can just get a
[49:33] drink whenever you need but when that
[49:34] well
[49:35] runs out then you really begin to have a
[49:38] hunger and a real desire and you really
[49:40] appreciated what you have now
[49:42] i'm not saying for a second the wells
[49:43] run dry we're tapped into an
[49:45] inexhaustible fountain
[49:47] of the lord jesus christ amen he can't
[49:49] run dry he can't run out
[49:50] hallelujah but you know i think we
[49:52] should uh maybe
[49:54] you know we should fight for what we
[49:56] have
[49:57] right we you know we have something
[50:00] worth fighting for
[50:01] we have something worth dying for amen
[50:04] hallelujah
[50:05] now in order you know luke what jesus
[50:08] would say here in the book of luke or
[50:10] what king going to make war against
[50:12] another king sitteth not down first
[50:14] and consulteth whether he be able with
[50:16] ten thousand
[50:17] to meet him that cometh against him with
[50:19] twenty thousand so there's
[50:20] before a uh a war is fought uh
[50:24] you know a king or the government will
[50:25] make a decision can we win this war
[50:28] and you know are we able to win it now
[50:31] the something that has been i'm just
[50:33] going to backtrack a little bit now when
[50:35] something has when a victory has been
[50:37] won
[50:38] that thing that has been recaptured or
[50:40] captured is not taken for granted
[50:43] now before a war is raged there's
[50:45] normally a few things that must be
[50:46] weighed up
[50:48] now this is not a list of importance
[50:50] it's just it's just what i've got here
[50:51] can we win this war
[50:53] let's think about this we're going to
[50:54] war okay the question is can we win
[50:57] do we have a big enough army to win
[51:01] is the cause we have right right is the
[51:04] cost or the price that we must pay worth
[51:06] it
[51:07] right this now i'm just talking along
[51:09] natural lines now what are we fighting
[51:11] for
[51:12] the greater the value that something so
[51:15] just say if we were fighting just say if
[51:17] another country came and invaded new
[51:18] zealand
[51:19] you know they took the south island or
[51:21] they took some part of the country
[51:23] if we put great value on that piece of
[51:25] our country we'll fight for that piece
[51:27] of our country
[51:28] we will make great sacrifices to get it
[51:30] back but if we put a little bit of value
[51:32] on it we'll let them have it
[51:34] or maybe you know compromise and come to
[51:36] negotiations and
[51:37] you know because the value we've put
[51:39] upon it is not as great as maybe it
[51:41] should be
[51:41] but if great value is put upon it then
[51:44] we'll give everything we have
[51:46] we'll give all our resources all of our
[51:48] energy we'll give our lives for it
[51:50] because we'll put great value on it now
[51:52] this is just talking along natural lives
[51:54] but how much more
[51:55] spiritual lines the question is can we
[51:58] win
[51:59] amen our captain's already won he
[52:01] conquered hell death and the grace
[52:03] hallelujah do we have a big enough army
[52:05] too when i say
[52:06] one is a majority with god moses was one
[52:09] man
[52:09] 80 year old man anointed commissioned to
[52:12] go into egypt
[52:12] he went into the superpower of the day
[52:14] said let my people go
[52:16] and the end result was the people were
[52:18] let go
[52:19] hallelujah so one man amen you can be
[52:21] the one that can shake the world
[52:23] holy now i'm not talking about
[52:24] overthrowing governments that's not what
[52:26] we're here to do we're here to overthrow
[52:28] the devil's kingdom in people's lives
[52:30] that satan would be dethroned that
[52:32] unbelief that had its way in people's
[52:34] lives would be kicked out
[52:35] it would be replaced by faith hallelujah
[52:37] and god would live in that person's life
[52:39] so
[52:40] we're here to tear satan's kingdom down
[52:43] and i'll say we have something worth
[52:44] fighting for
[52:46] as the prophet would tell us one soul is
[52:48] worth more than ten thousand worlds
[52:50] hallelujah so we have something worth
[52:52] fighting for is our cause right
[52:54] absolutely it's right we have the right
[52:57] cause
[52:58] and it's not just trying to spin it a
[52:59] certain way to try and sway public
[53:01] opinion to fight a war
[53:03] no we have a right cause hardly because
[53:05] the devil's taking people captive amen
[53:08] but we have we're under a mandate from
[53:10] god
[53:10] i mean to take them back hallelujah we
[53:13] have we have the right cause
[53:15] and is the cost of the price worth it
[53:17] absolutely
[53:19] 100 hallelujah we got to put value
[53:24] higher value and what we have
[53:27] this is maybe i'm talking to myself but
[53:29] when you think when you think about even
[53:31] wednesday you know we can take prayer
[53:32] meetings or even services for granted
[53:34] where god comes down
[53:35] and he begins to speak and touch hearts
[53:37] and change lives
[53:38] we shouldn't take that for granted we
[53:41] shouldn't take it casual or the lord's
[53:42] in the room
[53:44] right we shouldn't take it for granted
[53:45] even when you pray at home in your car
[53:47] he comes and visits you and speaks to
[53:49] your heart and
[53:50] ministers his word makes it alive we
[53:52] shouldn't take that for granted
[53:54] we should treasure that that's something
[53:56] worth fighting for that's worth
[53:57] something defending
[53:59] hallelujah amen now there have been many
[54:03] great feats of
[54:04] heroics on the battlefield down through
[54:06] the ages though i'm just talking about
[54:08] natural battles where men would
[54:11] literally give their lives on the
[54:13] battlefield to defend their homes their
[54:14] families and their children
[54:16] and they would many times know they will
[54:18] never return
[54:19] right they knew this was going to be
[54:20] their last day upon the earth but the
[54:22] cause they were had that was
[54:24] burning in their hearts was so real and
[54:26] so great they said i'm going to give my
[54:28] life
[54:29] you know we know the story of arnold van
[54:30] winkld you know in switzerland where the
[54:32] austrians came in he says
[54:34] brethren are just a bunch of farmers
[54:35] they didn't have the same equipment as
[54:37] the austrians they didn't have the
[54:38] weapons
[54:39] like them but he said brethren i'm going
[54:40] to give my life to switzerland today
[54:42] over that down in that valley's my
[54:44] family i'm never going to see them again
[54:46] this morning i kiss my my wife goodbye
[54:48] my children can buy
[54:49] i'm going to give my life for
[54:50] switzerland and they asked him what are
[54:52] you going to do arnold he said just
[54:54] follow me
[54:55] fight with what you got and he found the
[54:57] thickest part of the spares the thickest
[54:59] part of the army
[55:00] and then he pressed into that said make
[55:02] way for liberty pulled the spares into
[55:04] his own bosom
[55:05] made a bridge you know in their
[55:06] formation and the swiss garden and won
[55:08] the battle
[55:09] but he made up his mind i'm giving my
[55:11] life for switzerland it's worth it
[55:13] he put a value of the freedom of his
[55:15] country
[55:16] greater than his own life hallelujah now
[55:19] our lord jesus now that's just a natural
[55:21] thing that's just a natural thing
[55:23] nations will come nations will go you
[55:25] know
[55:26] at the end of the day there will only be
[55:27] one nation which is the nation of our
[55:30] lord jesus christ in the millennium and
[55:31] in the new heavens and new earth
[55:33] right but he gave his life for
[55:34] switzerland now our lord jesus
[55:37] was much the same way but far greater
[55:39] remember he didn't remember
[55:41] he he didn't try and bypass the devil's
[55:44] you know you know the wall and barrier
[55:45] of sin and death he didn't try and go
[55:47] under it he didn't try and go around it
[55:48] try and find a weak point
[55:50] but he hit the hardest part of it he
[55:52] took death head-on
[55:54] hallelujah he didn't shrink back he said
[55:55] no i'm going to give my life for adam's
[55:57] fallen race this day
[55:58] i'm not going to purchase their
[55:59] salvation i have in my body
[56:02] amen the blood that can free every man
[56:04] woman and child that will believe
[56:06] hallelujah and he took death head-on
[56:08] hallelujah and he bridged the chasm
[56:11] hallelujah now he gives us the same
[56:13] ability to fight with what we got
[56:15] amen jesus would would defeat the devil
[56:17] with the word in the desert
[56:19] hallelujah showing that the weakest of
[56:21] christians aiming can take the word of
[56:23] god and quote it at the devil and defeat
[56:25] the devil any place any time anywhere
[56:28] hallelujah he did not use his great
[56:29] powers he could have he could have
[56:31] spoken the devil out of existence who
[56:33] believes he could have done that
[56:34] amen he could have turned him into
[56:36] anything he could have but he just used
[56:37] the word he said it is written
[56:39] hallelujah and he defeated the devil
[56:41] right there
[56:43] hallelujah there have been many great
[56:46] last stands in the
[56:48] in the history of warfare a last stand
[56:50] is basically going to make your stand
[56:52] and you know you're probably not going
[56:53] to get out of it
[56:54] there would be a time in the texas
[56:56] revolution this may not mean much to
[56:58] anyone but
[56:59] you know there was a there was a there
[57:01] was a series of battles called the texan
[57:03] revolution
[57:04] where the state of texas which was kind
[57:06] of just forming would fight against the
[57:08] mexican government
[57:10] and they and there were a bunch of
[57:11] texans that would that would that would
[57:13] set up a defense in the alamo mission
[57:16] who who's heard of the alamo
[57:18] davy crockett was there who's heard of
[57:20] davy crockett
[57:21] right he would lose his life in this
[57:22] battle but they would
[57:24] just a few hundred of them would would
[57:26] defend this mission against the
[57:28] you know you know thousands of of of
[57:30] texan
[57:31] um uh soldiers and the texans would win
[57:33] this battle and literally wipe out
[57:35] everyone that was in the alamo
[57:37] now it became a rallying cry of the
[57:39] texans after this
[57:41] they would say remember the alamo when
[57:43] they would fight their enemy
[57:45] now if if a defeat could could could
[57:48] rally a people
[57:49] remember what they did did to us there
[57:52] remember how they killed the prisoners
[57:54] remember what they did at the alamo
[57:55] and it rallied them i mean emboldened
[57:58] them to fight
[57:59] amen this you know you know this mexican
[58:01] force
[58:02] and we know the rest is history and
[58:04] texas is now part of america but
[58:06] you know if a if a rallying cry
[58:09] of a defeat could stir a people to fight
[58:13] how much more if we could say remember
[58:15] the red sea

[58:19] across on dry land

[59:35] and resurrection
[59:36] amen if i'm a christian i must be only

[1:00:19] on the
[1:00:20] church door there if i'm a christian i
[1:00:22] must be
[1:00:23] holy if i'm a christian i'm to identify
[1:00:25] with john wesley preaching
[1:00:26] standing on his own father's uh
[1:00:28] gravestone preaching to the masses
[1:00:31] hallelujah if i'm a christian i'm with
[1:00:33] those at azusa street
[1:00:34] amen hallelujah amen if i'm a christian
[1:00:38] i'm to identify with an angel coming to

[1:00:44] coming down on mount sunset
[1:00:46] hallelujah if i'm a christian i've got
[1:00:48] to be identified with all those things
[1:00:50] i mean so we could use any of those and
[1:00:52] say remember
[1:00:53] amen remember the great victories
[1:00:57] hallelujah they're not defeats they're
[1:00:58] victories amen and so we could say
[1:01:01] remember calvary
[1:01:02] amen remember when the son of god took
[1:01:04] our sins that day up calvary's cross
[1:01:07] remember when he gave his life remember
[1:01:09] when he took the stripes amen that
[1:01:10] should stir something in our hearts
[1:01:12] i'll let you stir a rally and cry this
[1:01:14] is worth fighting for
[1:01:16] this is worth dying for i remember when
[1:01:18] he went down to hell hallelujah in our
[1:01:20] place as a sinner
[1:01:21] that we don't need to go there because
[1:01:23] he took your sin down there in your
[1:01:24] place
[1:01:25] i mean that you don't need to go down
[1:01:26] into that place and remember when he
[1:01:28] rose triumphant amen
[1:01:30] hardly over hell death in the grave
[1:01:34] remember those things hallelujah yes sir
[1:01:38] i say we have something worth fighting
[1:01:40] for amen i
[1:01:41] we have something worth dying for
[1:01:43] hallelujah
[1:01:46] hallelujah one soul is worth more than
[1:01:48] 10 000 worlds
[1:01:50] now we can live in such a way
[1:01:54] where the kingdom expands
[1:01:57] amen where god comes and lives now we're
[1:01:59] talking no i almost had to walk away
[1:02:01] from the table yesterday
[1:02:02] i was like get out of my notes everyone
[1:02:04] stop talking about these things
[1:02:06] no but we can either live in such a way
[1:02:08] where we can just go through the status
[1:02:10] quo
[1:02:11] we come to church we do everything
[1:02:12] believers do
[1:02:14] we have family alters at home we pray we
[1:02:16] talk about the lord just but we just go
[1:02:18] through the motions
[1:02:19] we can live that kind of a life and from
[1:02:21] the outside that looks
[1:02:22] pretty good or we can live a life that
[1:02:24] is that
[1:02:25] but god living where divine love is
[1:02:28] projected
[1:02:29] and sovereign grace takes over and god
[1:02:31] supernaturally touches people's lives we
[1:02:34] can live that kind of life
[1:02:35] i mean we can live a life where actually
[1:02:37] we have love one for another
[1:02:38] i mean we can actually enter the burden
[1:02:40] of someone's need hallelujah and more
[1:02:42] than just say a prayer for them
[1:02:44] but pray a prayer for them i mean where
[1:02:46] god actually begins to undertake for
[1:02:47] someone's life
[1:02:49] hallelujah now the reason i'm saying all
[1:02:52] this is because we've got something
[1:02:53] worth fighting for
[1:02:54] do you think the devil likes a people
[1:02:57] that are filled with the holy ghost and
[1:02:58] god lives
[1:03:00] that's the one thing he doesn't mind if
[1:03:03] we believe the message
[1:03:05] he doesn't mind if we actually make a
[1:03:07] profession of faith
[1:03:08] but the one thing he minds is when the
[1:03:10] life of god
[1:03:12] enters into a human vessel and begins to
[1:03:15] live himself out remember
[1:03:16] the devil didn't roll out of bed even on
[1:03:18] the day of pentecost
[1:03:20] but when peter and john were walking
[1:03:22] past the gate beautiful
[1:03:23] and they began to see a crippled man
[1:03:25] that was sitting by the gate of the
[1:03:26] church that no one could help they
[1:03:28] stepped over they couldn't help him
[1:03:30] but they looked down and said look on us
[1:03:31] and say silver and gold we have none but
[1:03:33] such as i have give by thee
[1:03:35] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:03:37] rise up and walk and they just pulled
[1:03:38] him up onto his feet
[1:03:40] i don't know what was going through his
[1:03:41] mind but hallelujah
[1:03:43] amen he was walking and leaping and
[1:03:45] praising god brother ram says
[1:03:47] after that happened then all the guns of
[1:03:49] hell began to turn upon the believer
[1:03:51] because now the one that was in jesus
[1:03:53] was now in the disciples doing what he
[1:03:55] did
[1:03:56] before the before the death burial
[1:03:57] resurrection amen
[1:03:59] hallelujah so the devil hates that kind
[1:04:01] of thing
[1:04:02] the devil hates god living in a people
[1:04:04] he will let you be a message believer
[1:04:06] without a birth
[1:04:07] he will even give you this message
[1:04:08] without a birth i mean but once you're
[1:04:10] born by the spirit of god
[1:04:12] and you can see a book of acts being
[1:04:14] written be sure they'll be opposition
[1:04:17] hallelujah and the more opposition you
[1:04:19] have you should be the happier person
[1:04:22] amen because if you say well the uh yo
[1:04:24] this is a heavy load what's good the
[1:04:26] devil's trying to force you into a
[1:04:28] corner
[1:04:28] but you're going to recognize devil i am
[1:04:30] being forced in a corner
[1:04:32] my god is bigger than you he defeated
[1:04:34] you you're a defeated being you're
[1:04:35] nothing but a block
[1:04:36] i'm not standing in a corner devil i'm
[1:04:38] pressing on
[1:04:40] hallelujah why because this is worth
[1:04:43] living for
[1:04:44] we have a resurrection message it's
[1:04:46] worth living for we actually have
[1:04:48] eternal life not religion
[1:04:50] not church forget about churchianity
[1:04:52] religion this is not religion this is a
[1:04:54] relationship with almighty god
[1:04:56] however he would come and change our
[1:04:58] lives i mean that we wouldn't be drug
[1:05:00] addicts or
[1:05:00] prostitutes or drunkards or gamers or
[1:05:03] whatever more we'll be living
[1:05:04] living people full of the holy ghost
[1:05:07] amen
[1:05:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:11] if he's alive you can meet him who's had
[1:05:15] that experience
[1:05:16] it's real simple if he's out of the tomb
[1:05:18] you can meet him hallelujah
[1:05:19] that's right hallelujah i believe it
[1:05:23] amen easter means more than just a
[1:05:25] tradition
[1:05:26] it is also now for our bodies it
[1:05:28] quickened with him and we're sitting in
[1:05:30] heavenly places
[1:05:31] and this body may rot in the sea it may
[1:05:33] rot in the ground it may
[1:05:35] not be a spoonful of ashes but she's
[1:05:37] coming forth
[1:05:39] for the spirit that raised up my lord
[1:05:40] from the dead has quickened this mortal
[1:05:42] body
[1:05:43] amen it's quicken your mortal body and
[1:05:46] we are beneficiaries of his resurrection
[1:05:49] his policy of eternal life that i talk
[1:05:51] so much about you know
[1:05:52] no wonder he said fear not he says it a
[1:05:56] lot in the bible
[1:05:57] don't fail don't be worried don't be
[1:06:00] scared fear not
[1:06:01] holy because remember when the lord ever
[1:06:03] comes to someone he doesn't come to him
[1:06:05] and say
[1:06:05] stay in your hole stay in your place
[1:06:08] stay in your hole he didn't come to
[1:06:09] giddy and say
[1:06:10] stay in the wine press threshing in
[1:06:12] secret he said no i'm bringing you out
[1:06:14] of this
[1:06:14] you're actually a mighty man of allah i
[1:06:16] want you to see your mighty man of
[1:06:18] fellow
[1:06:18] and now i'm going to prove it in your
[1:06:20] life hallelujah he took that mighty man
[1:06:22] of valor
[1:06:22] hallelujah and defeated a whole host of
[1:06:24] people heaven 300 of his brethren
[1:06:27] hallelujah
[1:06:28] that's right because he said you're a
[1:06:29] mighty man of valor and here he is in
[1:06:31] secret just
[1:06:32] trying to you know look at the bible in
[1:06:34] secret and have a secret oh because it's
[1:06:37] a personal walk with god and
[1:06:39] you know listening to the message in
[1:06:40] secret and not telling anyone about it
[1:06:42] and not
[1:06:42] you know rejoicing not letting it bubble
[1:06:45] forth because of fear
[1:06:47] but there he was a circumcised son of
[1:06:50] abraham
[1:06:51] living in the promised land living in
[1:06:53] his adopted place in the promised land
[1:06:55] but he was afraid of the enemy around
[1:06:57] him
[1:06:59] the devil's whipped he is have you ever
[1:07:01] really read this
[1:07:03] he's whipped amen he's worked yes
[1:07:07] i read in here where he's going to burn
[1:07:08] in the lake of fire
[1:07:10] and i read in here i'm going to be
[1:07:11] dancing on streets of glory
[1:07:13] hallelujah after he's in the lake of
[1:07:15] fire yes sir hallelujah so
[1:07:17] he's his destination has been
[1:07:19] pre-destinated
[1:07:20] yeah that's right you know his end has
[1:07:22] been because god by his full knowledge
[1:07:24] could look through the strands of time
[1:07:26] he could see iniquity in the heart of
[1:07:27] the devil in the beginning and he could
[1:07:29] see also where he would end up in the
[1:07:31] end
[1:07:32] do you know he's predestinated but if
[1:07:34] he's predicted on the negative what
[1:07:36] about the bride of christ on the
[1:07:37] positive
[1:07:38] but if he's been predestinated amen to
[1:07:41] burn
[1:07:42] that's right holy but we have been
[1:07:43] predestined to walk on streets of gold
[1:07:45] i mean when time is no more and eternity
[1:07:47] rolls on we'll still be there
[1:07:50] holly because that is our destiny has
[1:07:52] been predetermined
[1:07:53] i mean so it doesn't necessarily matter
[1:07:54] about our struggles in this life
[1:07:58] hallelujah it doesn't necessarily matter
[1:07:59] about the hardship we may have to endure
[1:08:01] it's all for our good anyway
[1:08:03] it's molding your character god's doing
[1:08:05] your work yes sir holy
[1:08:07] joseph you know joseph spent many years
[1:08:09] in prison
[1:08:10] god was doing a work yes sir hallelujah
[1:08:12] it's the same thing with us you say well
[1:08:13] i'm just going day by day all the same
[1:08:16] god's doing the work god's doing her
[1:08:18] work he's working mildly in you and me
[1:08:21] you may not appreciate what he's doing
[1:08:23] what he's doing
[1:08:25] that's the main thing hallelujah
[1:08:28] we are beneficiaries i love it we are
[1:08:30] and we are beneficiaries of his
[1:08:32] resurrection
[1:08:34] you know i love about the lord he
[1:08:36] doesn't just do something and say isn't
[1:08:38] that wonderful
[1:08:39] he's like no it's wonderful but i'm
[1:08:41] going to show you what it does for you
[1:08:43] hallelujah i mean he died on calvary
[1:08:46] now he's going to show i'm going to show
[1:08:47] you what it does i'm going to show you
[1:08:49] what my blood does
[1:08:51] i rose out of the tomb i was thinking i
[1:08:53] was driving from work and i was thinking
[1:08:54] what would it have been like to be one
[1:08:56] of those soldiers one of those roman
[1:08:58] soldiers
[1:09:01] you find yourself on the third third day
[1:09:04] or third night or
[1:09:05] whenever just before the dawn of the
[1:09:07] opening of the tomb
[1:09:09] and that's your watch nothing's been
[1:09:11] happening
[1:09:13] maybe you're getting a little bit bored
[1:09:15] but then there comes a presence down
[1:09:17] it says they fell down as like dead men
[1:09:20] that's how awesome it was these were
[1:09:22] soldiers that had been trained in battle
[1:09:23] maybe fought some wars
[1:09:25] maybe took some wounds but they never
[1:09:26] stepped into this kind of presence
[1:09:29] and they all fell down as dead men and
[1:09:31] the stone rolled away and angelo came
[1:09:32] and sat on the stone and the lord came
[1:09:34] out of the tomb
[1:09:36] what an experience what an impact
[1:09:39] they couldn't have you know they
[1:09:41] couldn't have forgotten that
[1:09:42] i don't know what they did with it but
[1:09:44] they couldn't have forgotten that kind
[1:09:46] of a
[1:09:47] service they couldn't have gotten that
[1:09:49] kind of a camp
[1:09:51] that's right hallelujah would have
[1:09:52] gripped them so much
[1:09:54] but it's what you've got to give
[1:09:55] yourself to it
[1:09:57] hallelujah that's it you've got to give
[1:09:59] yourself to it we're beneficiaries
[1:10:02] and that's why the prophet's ministry is
[1:10:03] so wonderful to me because god says i'm
[1:10:05] going to show you what the blood does
[1:10:07] i'm going to show you a contemporary of
[1:10:08] yours in this modern world
[1:10:10] and show you what the blood does
[1:10:12] hallelujah and we can have a testimony
[1:10:14] meeting right now
[1:10:15] we can all stand up and say i'll show
[1:10:16] you what the blood has done in my life
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:18] holy how it saved my soul amen healed my
[1:10:21] body quicken my mortal body
[1:10:23] other gay show me things to come amen
[1:10:25] change my heart open the word made it
[1:10:27] alive to me
[1:10:28] yes sir hallelujah amen couldn't we do
[1:10:30] that
[1:10:31] wouldn't that be a cool carnage oh we
[1:10:33] can do that amen
[1:10:35] hallelujah amen fear not
[1:10:39] he would know as for paul said death
[1:10:42] where is your sting
[1:10:43] grave where is your victory i'm full of
[1:10:45] quickening power thanks be to god
[1:10:47] who gives us the victory through our
[1:10:49] lord jesus christ

[1:10:52] alive forevermore
[1:10:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:56] hebrews 13 8

[1:10:59] his bride the messiahettes
[1:11:01] see the anointed one the same anointing
[1:11:04] upon him is now upon her
[1:11:06] i mean to do the same works hallelujah
[1:11:09] so if that's the case now
[1:11:11] we should press the battle amen
[1:11:14] hallelujah
[1:11:14] it's worth fighting for yes sir don't
[1:11:16] you think so
[1:11:19] if that's how you get out of the service
[1:11:20] i pray god just anchor it in your soul
[1:11:22] it's worth living for
[1:11:24] this gospel is worth living for i mean
[1:11:26] it's worth i mean prayer and giving our
[1:11:29] lives completely to it seeing god live
[1:11:31] it's worth it amen oh jesus
[1:11:34] and sometimes it means a lot sometimes
[1:11:36] it costs you something
[1:11:38] anything that don't cost you something
[1:11:40] it and
[1:11:41] sorry isn't worth not having all great
[1:11:43] things have to be paid for
[1:11:45] yeah people would rather pay for
[1:11:46] something and be given to it free
[1:11:49] yeah it's worth something and if it's
[1:11:52] worth something it's worth dying for
[1:11:55] and this religion that we have this
[1:11:56] pentecostal holy spirit that fell on us
[1:11:59] glory bring back to us and resurrected
[1:12:03] jesus christ alive after 1900 years
[1:12:06] it's worth all of our time and our
[1:12:08] efforts
[1:12:09] and everything we do it's worth all to
[1:12:11] us
[1:12:12] hallelujah now that doesn't mean we have
[1:12:14] church 24 7 but that every our whole
[1:12:16] life should be
[1:12:17] the whole theme of our life should be
[1:12:19] his redeeming love amen and it should be
[1:12:21] him his resurrected life it should be
[1:12:23] him living
[1:12:24] amen amen how we treat and very much
[1:12:26] help me lord jesus right now how we
[1:12:28] treat our children
[1:12:29] how we treat our family i mean everyday
[1:12:31] life how we treat our work colleagues or
[1:12:33] or
[1:12:33] school buddies whatever it should be
[1:12:35] that should be the principal theme
[1:12:37] of our whole life because it's worth
[1:12:40] everything
[1:12:43] glory hallelujah brother band would say
[1:12:46] in the great and mighty conqueror
[1:12:48] before any victory can be won there must
[1:12:50] be great prices paid
[1:12:52] oh what prices sometimes they are very
[1:12:54] deep and they make great scars tearing
[1:12:56] down
[1:12:57] but in order to have the mountain you've
[1:12:59] got to have the valley
[1:13:00] before we can have the sunshine we've
[1:13:02] got to get the rain before
[1:13:04] we can have the light we've got to get
[1:13:05] the knight before we can have right we
[1:13:08] have to have
[1:13:08] wrong or you would never know what wrong
[1:13:10] was but in order to conquer and to win
[1:13:13] the greatest battle that was ever won
[1:13:14] one stepped out of glory many years ago
[1:13:17] he did not take upon himself the form of
[1:13:19] an angel
[1:13:20] he did not come as some great person but
[1:13:22] he was going to prove that don't take
[1:13:24] muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to
[1:13:26] win a war
[1:13:28] what a statement amen he clothed himself
[1:13:31] in humility like a little baby and was
[1:13:34] born
[1:13:35] in a manger now just stop right here
[1:13:37] remember the first prayer meeting we
[1:13:38] ever had
[1:13:39] when this church started the lord told
[1:13:41] us if we remain humble
[1:13:43] my word will continue to come forth and
[1:13:45] i'll bring people here and they will
[1:13:47] find my
[1:13:48] rest right what is his rest the holy
[1:13:51] ghost
[1:13:52] now we never got told that's done right
[1:13:56] who came here and found rest hallelujah
[1:13:59] so i say you are better you are the
[1:14:01] product of that prophecy
[1:14:04] but we're not done the lord never said
[1:14:06] no that's finished amen
[1:14:08] so in my opinion god's still going to
[1:14:10] bring people and they're going to find
[1:14:11] rest
[1:14:12] now they might not stay in this church
[1:14:13] that's irrelevant but they will be
[1:14:15] they'll be sealed into the kingdom by
[1:14:17] the holy ghost god might move them on
[1:14:18] somewhere else that's perfectly
[1:14:20] fine but he said i'll bring them here
[1:14:21] and they'll find rest for their souls
[1:14:24] amen hallelujah that's right so thanks
[1:14:26] humility he clothed himself in humility
[1:14:29] like a little baby
[1:14:30] and was born in a manger there was not
[1:14:32] even a place for his birth when he come
[1:14:34] i want you to look at the different
[1:14:36] material of warfare
[1:14:37] that he used what he used now adam's
[1:14:39] race was all in bondage
[1:14:42] there they were without hope without god
[1:14:43] without chance without mercy without
[1:14:45] anything that could help them
[1:14:47] the great enemies of the lower regions
[1:14:49] of the lost had shut them up in darkness
[1:14:51] there was not a way out there was no one
[1:14:53] could help
[1:14:54] nothing could be done it looked like a
[1:14:56] total
[1:14:57] complete loss but our hero
[1:15:00] i love that statement he's my hero jesus
[1:15:03] is my hero
[1:15:04] not someone who creeps around at night
[1:15:05] wearing their undies on the outside
[1:15:07] their clothes with a cape on
[1:15:08] that's not my hero my hero was the
[1:15:11] creator of heavens and earth
[1:15:13] my hero is not someone running around in
[1:15:15] shorts on a rugby field or a sports
[1:15:16] field
[1:15:17] they were once upon a time but not no
[1:15:19] more my hero came from glory and
[1:15:21] revealed himself to me
[1:15:22] and he's my hero harlow he's my hero
[1:15:25] he's the one i love
[1:15:27] hallelujah no one else could ever step
[1:15:29] down and say i am the resurrection in
[1:15:30] the life
[1:15:31] because i live you shall live also and i
[1:15:33] begin to see it in my life happening
[1:15:35] hello
[1:15:35] he's my hero hallelujah my my hero can
[1:15:38] step to a grave a man's been dead four
[1:15:40] days old and he can say
[1:15:41] lazarus come forth and if he did not
[1:15:44] call lazarus by name there would have
[1:15:46] been a general resurrection
[1:15:47] because he is the resurrection and the
[1:15:49] life heller
[1:15:50] my hero can go by a funeral procession
[1:15:53] and it doesn't end a funeral procession
[1:15:56] you know everywhere where jesus went
[1:15:58] where there was death
[1:15:59] the devil was your torment like legion
[1:16:01] it never stayed that way
[1:16:03] there was life there was redemption
[1:16:05] there was healing hallelujah
[1:16:07] there was resurrection that's my kind of
[1:16:09] hero
[1:16:10] my hero can take a tormented individual
[1:16:12] and give them peace in their hearts
[1:16:14] my hero can take someone who's just
[1:16:16] between two opinions this right or wrong
[1:16:18] and show them the way yes hallelujah
[1:16:20] that's my hero
[1:16:21] i mean my hero can take someone addicted
[1:16:23] to all kinds of things and set them free
[1:16:26] hallelujah they're just buried in the
[1:16:28] world floating along he can
[1:16:30] grab a hold of them amen and bring them
[1:16:32] out thank you lord
[1:16:34] that's my hero and i'm not talking just
[1:16:37] about a historical figure i'm talking
[1:16:39] about a present tense god
[1:16:40] i mean because he is a present help in
[1:16:42] time of trouble
[1:16:44] i mean from a time of trouble he's a
[1:16:45] present help what does that mean to be a
[1:16:47] prison help he's here
[1:16:49] if i'm present i'm here i'm not absent
[1:16:52] i'm present
[1:16:53] highly alike at school you'd be waiting
[1:16:55] for your name to be called in the role
[1:16:56] you'd say present
[1:16:57] present present you didn't say absent
[1:17:00] because they're looking and saying no
[1:17:01] you're present
[1:17:03] sometimes it was only present in body
[1:17:05] but you're still there
[1:17:07] i trust you're all president body and
[1:17:08] spirit today hallelujah but you know
[1:17:11] he's my hero hallelujah
[1:17:14] hallelujah amen but our hero who came
[1:17:17] down from the portals of glory
[1:17:19] condescending down
[1:17:20] for there was no man on earth who could
[1:17:22] do the job we were all as worldly
[1:17:24] speaking in the same boat we're all born
[1:17:26] and sinned shaped inequity come to the
[1:17:28] world speaking lies
[1:17:29] and none of us could help each other we
[1:17:31] stood helpless defeated chaos at every
[1:17:33] hand
[1:17:34] all united we could not keep laws and
[1:17:36] ceremonies
[1:17:37] finding their weaknesses and so forth we
[1:17:39] could not do it
[1:17:40] and it seemed like the whole human race
[1:17:43] was laid
[1:17:44] waste but then he came he came down
[1:17:48] hallelujah where i could not when i
[1:17:50] could not go to where he was he came to
[1:17:52] me
[1:17:53] he came to me and then he came he came
[1:17:56] down
[1:17:57] because he was in the beginning the
[1:17:58] bible says he was the word
[1:18:00] and he was the logos that went out of
[1:18:02] god and the logos in the beginning was
[1:18:04] the word
[1:18:05] and he became the word and then when he
[1:18:07] ascended
[1:18:08] up on the glorious day of easter he
[1:18:11] became not only the word but he became
[1:18:12] the high priest of his own word
[1:18:14] oh what a glorious thing brother neville
[1:18:16] just think what a glorious thing
[1:18:18] shekinah tabernacle just think
[1:18:20] he's not only the word but he's the high
[1:18:22] priest of his own word
[1:18:24] how could we doubt it how could we walk
[1:18:26] to him and not believe that we would
[1:18:27] receive what we asked for
[1:18:29] for he is the word and the intercessor
[1:18:31] of the word
[1:18:32] so he didn't just give the word but he's
[1:18:34] here to back up and make
[1:18:36] his own word come to pass i mean if he's
[1:18:39] the high priest of his own word the
[1:18:41] bible says he is the high priest of our
[1:18:43] profession
[1:18:43] amen amen so if we profess his word he
[1:18:46] remember he can only act on our behalf
[1:18:48] if we profess his word to him
[1:18:51] right it's not us professing our
[1:18:52] situation or how we feel
[1:18:54] oh this is going on this is going on
[1:18:56] when we profess his word to him
[1:18:58] then he can act on our behalf and
[1:19:01] remember nothing can stop him from
[1:19:03] acting
[1:19:04] nothing can tie his hands nothing can
[1:19:06] stop him the devil can't stop him saying
[1:19:08] no you can't do that god come on come on
[1:19:10] oh no no no no god just pushes him to
[1:19:13] one side says get out of here satan
[1:19:15] hallelujah these are my children this is
[1:19:17] my people get out of here
[1:19:19] i'm gonna act on their profession
[1:19:23] amen that's why it's always very
[1:19:24] important to just say what the bible
[1:19:26] says
[1:19:27] about you about a situation
[1:19:30] amen there's only virtue in that
[1:19:33] hallelujah amen the logos became word
[1:19:36] and the word made flesh in the same
[1:19:37] flesh that was the word received up into
[1:19:39] glory and now as the high priest making
[1:19:41] intercession
[1:19:42] by himself to his word that's what it
[1:19:45] takes that's the material the church has
[1:19:47] got what a weapon
[1:19:49] there's never been one like it he was
[1:19:51] the word and when he come down he was
[1:19:53] born in a manger he came to use the
[1:19:54] weapon of aloe ve
[1:19:56] love to conquer the world not with army
[1:19:58] bullets not with machine guns and tanks
[1:20:00] but he come
[1:20:01] in a different manner he came in the
[1:20:03] form of love he was god's
[1:20:05] love hallelujah and if he is in your
[1:20:08] heart
[1:20:09] then that weapon's in you he's going to
[1:20:12] let it have its free course
[1:20:14] amen but the devil will try and put
[1:20:16] complexes and pains and hurts and try
[1:20:18] and get us to withdraw
[1:20:20] but it's worth fighting for amen amen
[1:20:22] this faith is worth fighting for
[1:20:24] it's worth contending for amen
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:34] amen but someday when the scripture is
[1:20:35] fulfilled our spirits will be released
[1:20:37] from god we'll pick up the soul
[1:20:39] and the soul to the body and the power
[1:20:41] that will uh that will raise us up is
[1:20:43] right in us now
[1:20:44] we are now in heavenly places we are now
[1:20:46] in the power of the resurrection
[1:20:48] if there wasn't a law to it sons and
[1:20:50] daughters of god could create them a
[1:20:52] world out here
[1:20:53] and go live a private life on it i mean
[1:20:56] we have the power
[1:20:57] you have the power in you to do it if
[1:20:59] you've got a shadow of the power of god
[1:21:01] in you
[1:21:01] you've got power to do it see i'm not
[1:21:04] feeling very strong in faith today
[1:21:05] you've got the power to do it that's
[1:21:07] right amen hallelujah if you've got the
[1:21:09] shadow of the power of god in you you've
[1:21:11] got power to do it god is omnipotent
[1:21:13] see what i mean the power that's in you
[1:21:15] will make you could speak a world into
[1:21:17] existence and go live on it hallelujah
[1:21:20] there you are what if the creator
[1:21:22] remember the holy ghost is the creator
[1:21:23] himself
[1:21:24] it's not a different god a lesser god it
[1:21:26] is the god who said let there be sun
[1:21:28] moon and stars
[1:21:29] comes and dwells in his people so if the
[1:21:31] creator that could create all things
[1:21:32] comes and lives in you
[1:21:33] if there wasn't a law to stop it you
[1:21:35] could say let there be my own private
[1:21:37] world and go and and then you'd go live
[1:21:39] on it
[1:21:40] and don't let your mind go wandering off
[1:21:41] saying i'd have beaches or mountains or
[1:21:43] valleys or what temperature
[1:21:45] but of that law but there's a law
[1:21:46] stopping that from happening
[1:21:48] i mean but the creator is in us
[1:21:51] hallelujah
[1:21:52] omni um god is omnipotent right so he's
[1:21:55] all powerful
[1:21:57] now if if if that is the case now i just
[1:22:01] want to
[1:22:02] jump here you know there's nothing you
[1:22:05] know man is all powerful
[1:22:07] you know there is nothing impossible
[1:22:09] with you
[1:22:11] we think we so many times oh god there's
[1:22:13] nothing impossible with god he can do
[1:22:14] all things
[1:22:15] do you know if that powers in you
[1:22:16] there's nothing impossible to you
[1:22:19] do we know that i'm just going to jump
[1:22:20] to because sometimes people yeah i
[1:22:22] really quote people are i need a
[1:22:23] scripture for that or
[1:22:24] okay well we'll just go the scriptures
[1:22:26] then we'll go to the quote okay and they
[1:22:28] brought him
[1:22:29] unto him and when they saw him so this
[1:22:31] is a member of father's the story of the
[1:22:34] you know the deci jesus comes off the
[1:22:36] mountain these disciples try to cast
[1:22:38] out an epileptic spirit i believe it is
[1:22:40] out of a little boy and you know they
[1:22:41] can't do it
[1:22:42] and and so this is jesus coming on the
[1:22:44] scene here and they brought him unto him
[1:22:46] and when he saw him straight away the
[1:22:48] spirit tear him
[1:22:50] and he fell on the ground and wallowed
[1:22:51] foaming and he asked his father how long
[1:22:55] is it a go since this came on um uh
[1:22:58] unto him and he said of a child and
[1:23:00] often cast him into a fire
[1:23:03] and into the waters to destroy him but
[1:23:06] if thou can us
[1:23:07] do anything have compassion on us and
[1:23:09] help us
[1:23:12] and jesus said unto him if thou canst
[1:23:15] believe
[1:23:15] all things are possible to him him that
[1:23:18] believeth
[1:23:19] so to the believer all things are
[1:23:20] possible not just some things
[1:23:22] all things all things are possible to
[1:23:25] the bride of christ
[1:23:27] not all things we should never limit the
[1:23:28] faith we have we should never limit this
[1:23:31] power that we have i can do this but i
[1:23:32] can't do this no no it can do this and
[1:23:34] do that
[1:23:35] and it can do more besides hallelujah
[1:23:39] amen jesus said unto him if thou canst
[1:23:41] believe all things are possible to him
[1:23:42] that believeth do we have believers in
[1:23:44] the room today
[1:23:45] and straight away the father of child
[1:23:47] cried out and said with tears lord i
[1:23:49] believe helped out my unbelief
[1:23:51] now that's a good way to be if you don't
[1:23:53] you know if the revelation hasn't
[1:23:55] dropped into your heart for something
[1:23:56] say lord help my unbelief
[1:23:58] give me more faith lord take my unbelief
[1:24:00] and when jesus saw that the people came
[1:24:02] running together he rebuked this foul
[1:24:04] spirit saying unto him
[1:24:05] thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee
[1:24:07] come out of him
[1:24:09] and enter into him no more and the
[1:24:11] spirit cried and rent him saw and came
[1:24:13] out of him
[1:24:14] and he was as one dead and so much that
[1:24:16] many said he is dead
[1:24:18] but jesus took him by the hand lifted
[1:24:19] him up and he arose
[1:24:21] and when he was coming to the house the
[1:24:23] disciples asked him
[1:24:24] privately why could we not cast them out
[1:24:27] and he said unto them this kind come can
[1:24:30] come forth by nothing
[1:24:32] but by prayer and fasting now
[1:24:35] i just i just want i wanted to read that
[1:24:37] whole thing just to show you know
[1:24:39] sometimes spirits come out in different
[1:24:41] ways
[1:24:42] but i'll say this if if it takes prayer
[1:24:45] and fasting to cast a demon out
[1:24:48] is it worth the sacrifice if you feel
[1:24:50] led to
[1:24:51] to to do that i'd say it's worth it
[1:24:54] i mean the battle's worth it the
[1:24:56] sacrifice is worth it i mean if we keep
[1:24:58] the goal at the end
[1:25:00] in our minds whatever sacrifice must be
[1:25:03] made to get to that goal i'll say it's
[1:25:05] worth it
[1:25:06] you know olympians or great sports
[1:25:07] people they will have the finals in mind
[1:25:11] they'll have that podium finish they
[1:25:12] will have the world cup or
[1:25:14] whatever you know winning some olympic
[1:25:17] gold
[1:25:17] you know those who are training for the
[1:25:19] america's cup
[1:25:21] they have the victory in mind and that
[1:25:24] is their goal
[1:25:25] and they're not worried what sacrifices
[1:25:27] they have to make
[1:25:28] in order to pick up that old mug as it's
[1:25:31] called it's called the old mug
[1:25:34] you know because they are determined
[1:25:35] we're going to win this
[1:25:37] we're going to win this thing we're
[1:25:38] going to win this you know and so
[1:25:40] their whole lives remember they're not
[1:25:41] amit it's you know it's not amateur hour
[1:25:44] it's 24 7 living breathing sailing
[1:25:48] that's right right and now this is just
[1:25:50] professional sport
[1:25:52] how about eternal things it's worth it
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] it's worth it to god hallelujah
[1:26:00] thank you jesus it's worth it now
[1:26:03] we'll go back here amen
[1:26:07] cut every obstacle from human beings
[1:26:09] that they might be connected like in the
[1:26:11] garden of eden
[1:26:12] now man i'm going to choke it but i'm
[1:26:14] going to say it
[1:26:16] man is omnipotent you don't believe that
[1:26:19] but he is a man fully surrendered to god
[1:26:21] is omnipotent
[1:26:23] did not he say mark 11 22 whatever
[1:26:25] things you say and don't doubt in your
[1:26:27] heart it will come to pass
[1:26:28] you can have what you've said what
[1:26:30] happens when two omnipotents meet and
[1:26:32] god
[1:26:33] and man comes together too omnipotent
[1:26:35] something's got to shake
[1:26:37] i mean whatsoever you would say with
[1:26:39] that creative power
[1:26:40] of the omnipotence of god knowing that
[1:26:42] he promised it
[1:26:43] and he said it in his word it creates a
[1:26:45] power that goes out yonder and brings
[1:26:48] things to
[1:26:48] us things that is not it makes them as
[1:26:50] though they are because two omnipotents
[1:26:52] have met
[1:26:53] there he stands oh isn't he wonderful
[1:26:56] how isn't he wonderful that he yet
[1:26:58] that he won the victory but he just he
[1:27:00] didn't just keep that victory to himself
[1:27:01] he says no i'm gonna
[1:27:02] i'm gonna share it with my wife amen
[1:27:05] hallelujah
[1:27:06] isn't that incredible as as i say
[1:27:09] nothing is impossible
[1:27:11] to you all things are possible to them
[1:27:13] that belief
[1:27:14] but you've got to only believe to only
[1:27:17] believe
[1:27:18] does not mean have faith and then look
[1:27:20] at the circumstances that's not only
[1:27:22] belief
[1:27:23] right that is believing and but he said
[1:27:26] only believe
[1:27:27] so only believers i'm only going to take
[1:27:29] god's word into consideration
[1:27:31] that's only believing nothing else
[1:27:33] abraham did not pay attention to his own
[1:27:35] body dead
[1:27:36] sarah's body past age the impossibility
[1:27:39] hey he he looked old he sounded old he
[1:27:42] felt
[1:27:42] old you know she looked old she sounded
[1:27:46] old they were old but
[1:27:49] abraham only believed he didn't consider
[1:27:51] those things
[1:27:52] he said god's made the promise and if
[1:27:54] god made the promise god's obligated to
[1:27:57] fulfill the promise
[1:27:58] remember it's not us trying to force the
[1:28:00] promise to happen it's actually god
[1:28:02] if he promised it it's going to happen
[1:28:04] then we can go
[1:28:05] rejoicing giving him thanks praising him
[1:28:08] for things you see not because you know
[1:28:09] it's on its way
[1:28:11] because remember faith declares as
[1:28:13] though it is though it is not
[1:28:15] hallelujah you say that's a crazy way to
[1:28:17] be well abraham
[1:28:18] had isaac and maybe he would be juggling
[1:28:21] him on his
[1:28:22] um you know shoulder saying who's crazy
[1:28:24] now
[1:28:25] who's crazy now here he is do you want
[1:28:29] to see the evidence
[1:28:30] this is this is the evidence of my
[1:28:31] insanity apparently is this baby boy
[1:28:34] who's crazy now hallelujah
[1:28:38] and when we're changing a moment of a
[1:28:39] twinkling of an eye who's crazy
[1:28:42] now hallelujah
[1:28:45] who's crazy now oh you're a crazy man
[1:28:48] i'm real happy this way the other way
[1:28:50] didn't make me very happy
[1:28:52] i was depressed i'd cross the road going
[1:28:54] from the island village there at
[1:28:56] university down in canterbury across
[1:28:58] ireland road to go to university
[1:29:00] traffic would come and i would not slow
[1:29:02] down to get hit by cars but i actually
[1:29:04] will like something just hit me
[1:29:06] that's how unhappy i was on the inside
[1:29:08] i've never felt that way like this
[1:29:11] hallelujah i've only been happy this way
[1:29:14] have you had hardships yet but i've
[1:29:15] never been like that
[1:29:17] because i know in whom i have belief i
[1:29:19] know who's in charge of the whole thing
[1:29:22] and i know what he said about me is not
[1:29:23] yeah he said no you're going to make it
[1:29:25] because i'm going to make you make it
[1:29:26] all right
[1:29:27] i died on cross for you i died at
[1:29:29] calgary for you i've seen this message
[1:29:31] to turn your heart back to the original
[1:29:32] faith
[1:29:33] you're going to make it i've opened my
[1:29:35] word to you this book is now open
[1:29:37] hallelujah i've descended to take over
[1:29:39] the battle hallelujah are you going to
[1:29:40] make it

[1:29:44] jesus let it be unto me according to thy
[1:29:46] word
[1:29:47] yes hallelujah glory to god
[1:29:50] now brother brown would tell a story
[1:29:55] i'm i don't think i have it on here but
[1:29:58] but he tells a story of
[1:30:00] of of a bicycle race i just saw it
[1:30:03] whoever
[1:30:04] whoever puts the little snippets of his
[1:30:06] sermons on i think up in
[1:30:08] uh fielding whoever does it i say god
[1:30:10] bless them and
[1:30:11] and they just put on the one about the
[1:30:14] bicycle race where where uh
[1:30:15] a company that made bicycles said we'll
[1:30:17] give you a free bicycle a brand new one
[1:30:19] if you can ride over this bit of wood
[1:30:21] however long it was
[1:30:22] and make it all the way to the end and
[1:30:24] so all the boys in the neighborhood said
[1:30:26] yep let's enter this thing
[1:30:28] and there was one boy who they thought
[1:30:30] man he's a useless writer he'll never do
[1:30:31] it but but he joined in as well
[1:30:33] and one by one those boys got on the
[1:30:36] bike
[1:30:37] they tried to ride across but they fell
[1:30:39] off every one of them
[1:30:40] but then the boy who who had no you know
[1:30:43] they thought no he's never going to win
[1:30:44] he got on the bike and he just went
[1:30:46] straight across
[1:30:48] no wobbles and he got the you know he
[1:30:50] got a new bike
[1:30:52] so all of his buddies who thought he was
[1:30:53] useless they asked him how did you do it
[1:30:56] because they wanted the bike now he had
[1:30:57] the bike now they're jealous of the bike
[1:30:59] right so how'd you do it and he said you
[1:31:01] know i was watching you fellas
[1:31:02] and you're biking along but you kept
[1:31:04] looking down at your pedals and looking
[1:31:06] down at the board
[1:31:07] and you all fell off so i decided no no
[1:31:10] i'm not gonna look
[1:31:11] i'm not gonna look down at my feet or
[1:31:12] the pedals or the board i'm gonna look
[1:31:14] to where i'm going
[1:31:16] and that's how i got across now if we
[1:31:18] look at our faults and our failures and
[1:31:20] our humanity and this brother did this
[1:31:22] assistant did this and this person did
[1:31:24] this and this is doing this
[1:31:25] you know we're looking down at the board
[1:31:27] oh i better stay in the middle of the
[1:31:29] road how's this going to happen
[1:31:30] you know trying to trust in your own
[1:31:32] ability you're going to fall off
[1:31:34] but if you look under jesus at the end
[1:31:36] if you look at the end destination
[1:31:38] if you look at where you're going look
[1:31:39] at the promise amen you will stay in the
[1:31:42] middle of the road
[1:31:43] and you'll stay in a balanced walk
[1:31:46] hallelujah you know my dad told me when
[1:31:49] i was learning to ride a bike and
[1:31:51] being on go-karts he said you know where
[1:31:53] you look is where you end up driving
[1:31:56] you know so you can be riding along if
[1:31:59] you're looking this way you'll start
[1:32:00] turning this way
[1:32:01] you know or you're in a goku even in a
[1:32:03] car why do so many you know
[1:32:04] people sticky beak and rubber neck and
[1:32:06] they crash why because they're not
[1:32:08] looking at the road they're looking at
[1:32:09] some other thing
[1:32:11] so it's the same thing what your eyes
[1:32:12] are towards is what you'll walk
[1:32:15] end up going towards that's why we
[1:32:18] should keep our eyes on jesus on the
[1:32:20] word
[1:32:20] on this message we should keep it on him
[1:32:23] not on this world and other stuff
[1:32:25] because you'll end up going you'll hit
[1:32:26] the gravel and then you'll be
[1:32:28] you know you've got to watch where
[1:32:29] you're going
[1:32:32] hallelujah we should be looking unto
[1:32:34] jesus
[1:32:35] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:32:38] that's the one we should be looking for
[1:32:40] um unto him hallelujah
[1:32:43] if we keep our eyes on him who gave the
[1:32:45] promise he who said i'm a present help
[1:32:48] in time of trouble
[1:32:49] the one who said he will fulfill his
[1:32:50] word then we will keep walking straight
[1:32:53] as sure as there's a heaven to go to
[1:32:54] hallelujah amen that's what we need to
[1:32:58] keep doing
[1:32:59] now as i said
[1:33:02] we can't help anyone i think i was
[1:33:05] saying to the brothers there at the
[1:33:06] table
[1:33:06] i said you know it's like there's a
[1:33:08] difference between sitting in the trench
[1:33:11] and charging forward getting over the
[1:33:13] top and charging forward
[1:33:15] you know when divine love is ruling a
[1:33:17] life
[1:33:18] that person's over the top they have
[1:33:21] gone over the top of the trench and
[1:33:22] they're charging at the enemy
[1:33:24] because they have redeeming love in
[1:33:25] their hearts they are determined
[1:33:28] as he died to make men holy let us let
[1:33:30] us die to make men free
[1:33:32] there's something in them saying i'm not
[1:33:34] staying in this hole just trying to live
[1:33:36] out this
[1:33:37] this wall going through the motions no
[1:33:39] i'm going over the top
[1:33:41] you know we have invincibility whoever
[1:33:44] played a gamer you get the invincibility
[1:33:45] then yo it's just all on we have
[1:33:47] invincibility
[1:33:48] hallelujah we have nothing to be afraid
[1:33:50] of amen
[1:33:52] hallelujah but we can't help anyone
[1:33:54] staying in the trench
[1:33:55] we can go through the motions you know a
[1:33:57] soldier in the trench a soldier on the
[1:33:59] battlefield they're
[1:34:00] they're still a soldier they have the
[1:34:01] same equipment
[1:34:03] they have the same boots the same helmet
[1:34:04] the same gun whatever whatever
[1:34:06] but one is fighting and one is just
[1:34:08] going through the motions
[1:34:10] and we're not called to just go through
[1:34:11] the motions you know the devil if he
[1:34:13] could make us lukewarm formal and
[1:34:15] powerless
[1:34:16] that's his goal so his goal is just to
[1:34:18] make us have church
[1:34:19] and nothing happens but it's worth
[1:34:22] contending for
[1:34:24] that's worth fighting for amen it's
[1:34:26] worth giving ourselves for
[1:34:28] lord i want to see you live lord i see
[1:34:30] you i want to see a word manifested in
[1:34:31] my life lord give me a revelation of
[1:34:33] your word i want to see the reality of
[1:34:35] you in my life
[1:34:36] hallelujah thanks you know you know
[1:34:38] brother brown when he was hunting
[1:34:39] squirrels
[1:34:40] he was meditating on i think it's mark
[1:34:41] 11 24.
[1:34:43] if he sounds to this mountain and he's
[1:34:45] just thinking about it
[1:34:46] and then the lord comes to him and says
[1:34:48] do you want me to show you what that
[1:34:49] means
[1:34:50] you want me to interpret give you the
[1:34:52] interpretation of that scripture
[1:34:55] and he says what do you have need of
[1:34:57] well i'm hunting squirrels
[1:34:59] well where do you want them he says well
[1:35:02] i want one on that limb
[1:35:03] and one appeared and then another
[1:35:05] another another one he shot them
[1:35:07] you know the story but god was
[1:35:09] interpreting that scripture to the
[1:35:11] prophet
[1:35:12] saying this is what it means when ye say
[1:35:14] unto this mountain when you speak to the
[1:35:16] situation
[1:35:17] now i don't need squirrels i don't need
[1:35:20] a storm to be
[1:35:21] spoken out of existence i don't need a
[1:35:23] tumor to be spoken out of the side of my
[1:35:25] wife
[1:35:25] i don't need those things but there's
[1:35:28] situations we have
[1:35:31] amen we say lord interpret that
[1:35:33] scripture see
[1:35:34] it's all very well being someone else's
[1:35:36] story but what about
[1:35:37] our story what about our testimony what
[1:35:40] lord make that scripture real
[1:35:42] to me holy make it alive to me lord
[1:35:45] jesus not just that oh brother this
[1:35:46] happened to brother brown was like what
[1:35:47] about
[1:35:48] our lives hallelujah he said well it's
[1:35:50] just uh you know
[1:35:52] you pray and one grain of sand begins to
[1:35:53] fall off the mountain that may be so
[1:35:55] what about the whole thing just just
[1:35:57] just gives way
[1:35:58] what about the whole thing just gives
[1:36:00] way if you say unto this mountain
[1:36:02] you're the same voice you know god can
[1:36:05] anoint a person in such a way that is
[1:36:06] not them speaking
[1:36:07] it's deity speaking brother it says that
[1:36:10] if a spirit-filled spirit-born man or
[1:36:12] woman
[1:36:12] takes the word of god in faith and
[1:36:14] speaks it across their lips he says
[1:36:16] the same as god speaking deity speaking
[1:36:18] every mountain has to move nothing can
[1:36:20] stand before that man or woman
[1:36:22] hallelujah and this is and
[1:36:25] well why do why would god want to do
[1:36:27] those things he wants to show us the
[1:36:29] power of the blood
[1:36:31] that this power doesn't just save us it
[1:36:33] doesn't just keep us
[1:36:35] but it gives us overcoming power against
[1:36:37] the forces of darkness
[1:36:39] it gives us overcoming power against
[1:36:40] unbelief
[1:36:42] against two opinions and and
[1:36:44] lukewarmness and things it gives us
[1:36:45] overcoming power against these things
[1:36:47] you know the devil just bowls in right
[1:36:50] right
[1:36:51] but we have a right to kick him out we
[1:36:54] have a right if he comes in how does he
[1:36:56] normally come in by words
[1:36:58] by images amen that's how he comes in
[1:37:02] well how is he going to go out by words
[1:37:06] hallelujah by an image of living image
[1:37:08] god living in a people
[1:37:10] amen holy well who's going to speak that
[1:37:12] word you're going to speak that word
[1:37:13] amen
[1:37:14] you've got to address your enemy amen
[1:37:16] just like jesus did
[1:37:17] and you've got to tell them where to go
[1:37:19] yes sir
[1:37:23] well we've had too many disappointments
[1:37:25] don't worry about the disappointments
[1:37:27] don't worry about them if we look at our
[1:37:30] disappointments
[1:37:33] we're going to stay disappointed if we
[1:37:36] look at our
[1:37:36] don't worry about negative thinking
[1:37:38] don't worry about disappointments well i
[1:37:40] thought this would happen joseph thought
[1:37:41] that he was going to get out of prison
[1:37:43] he thought it's going to be all fine he
[1:37:44] stayed there
[1:37:47] but two dreams gripped himself in such a
[1:37:50] way
[1:37:51] his whole life revolved around two
[1:37:52] dreams
[1:37:54] hallelujah and he just kept walking
[1:37:56] according to that
[1:37:58] say well i've been a lot you know weak
[1:38:00] it's very easy to sing that song we're
[1:38:01] looking
[1:38:02] for a city and here in disappointments
[1:38:04] often we so sadly robe
[1:38:06] and earthly friends no longer speak one
[1:38:08] word of love
[1:38:09] isn't it right it's easy to sing they
[1:38:11] say yeah glory i'm looking for a city
[1:38:13] you know but we do have a lot of
[1:38:14] disappointment but that disappointment
[1:38:16] shouldn't make us withdraw
[1:38:18] that's right that disappointment should
[1:38:19] make us press the battle
[1:38:21] i mean because the devil wants to use
[1:38:23] disappointment say i thought you're a
[1:38:25] christian and this didn't happen look at
[1:38:26] this and this and this and this and this
[1:38:28] and he's trying to erode your faith in
[1:38:30] the word
[1:38:32] amen but the devil is brother tazewell
[1:38:34] said it camp he's a liar
[1:38:35] even if he says something that's true
[1:38:37] he's still a liar because it's him
[1:38:39] speaking
[1:38:39] and it's always there's an agenda behind
[1:38:42] what he says
[1:38:43] and the conclusion of his satan you're a
[1:38:44] liar i'm not listening to you
[1:38:47] now i mention this on wednesday
[1:38:53] this is from wait we'll come back to
[1:38:56] that
[1:38:57] don't read it this is from
[1:39:01] the usa today and and this is just the
[1:39:04] article
[1:39:05] a florida man who had been reported
[1:39:08] missing at safe
[1:39:09] was found clinging to his capsized boat
[1:39:11] on sunday morning
[1:39:12] about 86 miles which is mr google tells
[1:39:15] me 1.38
[1:39:16] i mean 138.4 kilometers off the coast of
[1:39:20] cape canaveral which is florida official
[1:39:22] said
[1:39:23] sometime after midnight on sunday the
[1:39:25] man stuart b
[1:39:26] was asleep on his 32-foot sea ray
[1:39:30] called the stingray when he was abruptly
[1:39:32] awakened by water rushing into the front
[1:39:34] cabin of the boat
[1:39:35] said petty officer first class david uh
[1:39:38] milkaf
[1:39:39] a spokesman for the u.s coast guard the
[1:39:41] boat filled up with water almost
[1:39:43] immediately
[1:39:44] petty officer uh milkhoff said
[1:39:47] um adding that the vessel quickly
[1:39:49] capsized and that the force of the water
[1:39:51] pushed him
[1:39:52] out of the front hatch for hours mr b
[1:39:55] 62 climbed to the four feet of the boat
[1:39:59] spell
[1:39:59] that was above water then after sunrise
[1:40:02] mr b
[1:40:02] noticed a ship in the distance so he
[1:40:04] took off his shirt and started waving it
[1:40:06] to get the crew's attention
[1:40:08] he lost his glasses in the process crew
[1:40:11] members
[1:40:11] of the uh angles a 225 meter liberian
[1:40:15] container ship enroute to
[1:40:17] willing uh will millington uh
[1:40:20] i think delaware uh saw mr b around 11
[1:40:23] a.m
[1:40:24] and got close enough to throw him a life
[1:40:26] ring used to pull him to a ladder to
[1:40:28] bring him
[1:40:29] aboard the ship that's an epic rescue
[1:40:33] isn't it now this is the picture
[1:40:36] that this is the picture of of this is
[1:40:39] where he was on his boat so
[1:40:41] so he's there one moment resting in his
[1:40:43] boat everything's fine
[1:40:45] and then this water comes in somehow and
[1:40:47] he's clinging to it like this
[1:40:49] this is a photo from the container ship
[1:40:51] this is a desperate situation
[1:40:54] isn't it you know we can just go along
[1:40:57] in life on our boat everything's fine
[1:41:01] but then something like this happens
[1:41:02] yeah some of us are in this situation
[1:41:05] like this they don't realize they're in
[1:41:06] this situation
[1:41:09] and then so he's there
[1:41:12] waving his shirt trying to get help
[1:41:15] and the coast guard is looking for him
[1:41:16] and everything and so here's someone now
[1:41:19] my question is what if this container
[1:41:21] ship
[1:41:22] was withdrawn just going through the
[1:41:25] motions
[1:41:26] came to church went through the motions
[1:41:28] had no love
[1:41:30] for the brethren or for the lost
[1:41:33] and was just going through the motions
[1:41:34] they would have just continued on route
[1:41:36] because that's what
[1:41:36] was unexpected of them but they made it
[1:41:40] up in their mind we're going to press
[1:41:41] the battle
[1:41:42] we're going to rescue someone who's on
[1:41:44] the verge of drowning
[1:41:46] amen and so here he is this is him
[1:41:50] coming out
[1:41:51] coming up the ladder of that container
[1:41:53] ship
[1:41:54] imagine i don't know what the first
[1:41:56] words that came out of his mouth
[1:41:59] but he would have been so happy i'm so
[1:42:01] glad you came my way
[1:42:03] i'm so glad you saw me waving my little
[1:42:06] my little shirt saying help me i'm lost
[1:42:08] help me i need help
[1:42:09] hallelujah and now he's on terra firma
[1:42:12] safe
[1:42:13] yeah that would have been
[1:42:17] real desperate yeah remember he didn't
[1:42:20] have time i don't think to turn on his
[1:42:21] located beacon like the water just
[1:42:22] pushed him out the front hatch and there
[1:42:24] he is hanging
[1:42:28] but a ship came his way you say i'm on
[1:42:32] course everything's fine
[1:42:34] we're on route to port we're on the
[1:42:36] gospel ship of zion
[1:42:38] heaven is our next destination but
[1:42:40] sometimes we're going to look out the
[1:42:41] port side or the
[1:42:43] starboard side and you know we can we're
[1:42:45] going to have a lookout
[1:42:47] are there some people who are drowning
[1:42:49] yeah they can be sitting right next to
[1:42:51] you and drowning or on the verge of
[1:42:52] drowning
[1:42:53] and they don't know he couldn't get the
[1:42:55] boat out of the water
[1:42:57] he's stuck he's 138 kilometers from
[1:43:00] from from shore that's a long way
[1:43:04] you can't swim that far maybe if you're
[1:43:06] ultra iron man ultra ultra
[1:43:07] but you know i doubt very much with
[1:43:09] currents and sharks and whatever you
[1:43:11] know
[1:43:12] so these ones decided we're going to go
[1:43:15] by and say how are you doing
[1:43:16] yes this is how we should be
[1:43:20] we should have love we should have such
[1:43:23] a redeeming love in our hearts
[1:43:25] is it worth it this is ten thousand
[1:43:28] worlds
[1:43:29] got rescued out of the ocean that's the
[1:43:32] value i don't know what the value of the
[1:43:34] of their shipment was in their container
[1:43:35] ship but they just picked up 10 000
[1:43:38] worlds
[1:43:40] hallelujah that was going to drown now
[1:43:42] this is just in the natural but
[1:43:44] how much more you and i when we see
[1:43:47] people you say hello 10 000 worlds
[1:43:51] and it's not a stock market that goes up
[1:43:52] and down in value i don't know the value
[1:43:54] of 10 000 worlds
[1:43:55] but you know it's a lot there's a lot of
[1:43:57] zeros behind that one
[1:43:59] you know it's not in zimbabwean dollars
[1:44:01] either it's in policy you know but you
[1:44:02] know it's worth a lot of money
[1:44:04] it's worth a lot of money you know
[1:44:07] shouldn't we have this kind of heart yes
[1:44:09] you say well
[1:44:11] they've got to feed an extra mouth on
[1:44:12] the ship it was worth it
[1:44:15] they're going to find a bed for him it's
[1:44:17] worth it amen they're going to look
[1:44:18] after him now
[1:44:19] it's worth it he might have covert 19.
[1:44:22] it's worth it
[1:44:24] he might have something you know i'm
[1:44:25] saying like they had to weigh up the
[1:44:27] is it is the victory worth it and they
[1:44:30] decided
[1:44:31] yes because it's a life it's a man like
[1:44:34] you and i
[1:44:36] maybe he has children grandchildren you
[1:44:38] know he's got struggles he's got hopes
[1:44:39] he's got dreams
[1:44:40] you know he was worth being picked up
[1:44:44] shouldn't we have that same kind of
[1:44:45] heart towards anyone irrespective of how
[1:44:48] they've treated us whatever
[1:44:49] you know the bible says it's easy to
[1:44:51] love those who love you what about those
[1:44:53] who don't love you
[1:44:54] it's very easy to love those well of
[1:44:56] course everyone treats you good it's
[1:44:57] easy
[1:44:58] what about those who don't treat you
[1:44:59] well those are the ones who are actually
[1:45:01] like this
[1:45:03] and those are the ones you know these
[1:45:05] guys weren't concerned about their crew
[1:45:06] mates they're on the boat
[1:45:08] this guy's not on the boat right but
[1:45:11] they decided
[1:45:13] we're gonna pick him up
[1:45:22] i'm not saying you don't but i'm saying
[1:45:24] it's worth it
[1:45:25] well look remember remember in a battle
[1:45:27] you're gonna count the cost and say i'm
[1:45:29] going to give it my all
[1:45:31] amen please go
[1:45:34] now in the book of revelation i'm just
[1:45:37] going to finish
[1:45:38] poly segway but i just want you to think
[1:45:39] about that now in the book of revelation
[1:45:41] jesus is shown as as john is on the isle
[1:45:44] of patmos and he sees
[1:45:45] one like under the son of man walking
[1:45:47] among the seven golden candlesticks
[1:45:49] now we know that this is all symbolic
[1:45:51] it's a prophecy it's also a book of
[1:45:53] symbols
[1:45:53] and and this is the lord walking amongst
[1:45:57] the seven churches down through the
[1:45:59] seven church ages so he was the same
[1:46:00] lord in the first church age
[1:46:02] as he was in the second maybe manifest
[1:46:04] himself in different ways but it's the
[1:46:05] same holy ghost
[1:46:07] all the way down through now those
[1:46:10] remember we can't help someone
[1:46:13] unless we're really converted just like
[1:46:15] i think it was brother asian or or
[1:46:17] brother freddie i can't remember which
[1:46:18] one
[1:46:19] they said when jesus said to peter when
[1:46:21] thou art converted strength in the
[1:46:23] brethren
[1:46:24] so he couldn't even help people in his
[1:46:26] unconverted state though he was a
[1:46:28] believer he had to go to pentecost
[1:46:30] meet the lord that way and then he could
[1:46:31] strengthen the brethren
[1:46:33] so now what happened is there was 120
[1:46:36] people in the upper room and it was like
[1:46:39] a it was like a lamp stand
[1:46:42] that was full of oil the wick was there
[1:46:44] but it needed it in ignition
[1:46:46] it needed a light to come to get the
[1:46:49] thing burning
[1:46:50] hallelujah they were there they were
[1:46:52] ready they were under expectation
[1:46:54] but then the match had to be dropped if
[1:46:56] i can put it that way the match had to
[1:46:57] be dropped into the room and then
[1:47:00] hardly the lord came down cloven tongues
[1:47:03] of fire
[1:47:03] sat upon each one what happened the
[1:47:05] light got lit the candle got lit
[1:47:09] yeah you know there's a song you know
[1:47:10] i've been touched by my by his fire so
[1:47:12] i'm gonna let the whole world come and
[1:47:14] watch me burn
[1:47:16] hallelujah who's been touched by his
[1:47:18] fire then let the whole world come in
[1:47:20] come on watch me burn
[1:47:22] come and watch him live hallelujah
[1:47:24] hallelujah so
[1:47:25] so now the candlesticks gave light
[1:47:29] and a dark time and so it's the same
[1:47:33] lord
[1:47:34] walking through each church age now we
[1:47:36] know we are in a bright age
[1:47:38] but we're still part of the we're still
[1:47:41] in a later cnh
[1:47:42] the world has gone that way but we're in
[1:47:43] a bright age but we're giving light
[1:47:45] remember
[1:47:45] jesus says ye are the light of the world
[1:47:47] amen right we are the light of the world
[1:47:50] amen so now here he is so the
[1:47:53] candlesticks give light in the inner
[1:47:54] corner and the tabernacle in the
[1:47:56] wilderness or in the temple
[1:47:57] and this is a type of the light that the
[1:47:59] believers would give off
[1:48:01] through seven church ages from calvary
[1:48:03] until now
[1:48:04] now i say the believers because we know
[1:48:06] a church or a church age is made up of
[1:48:08] individuals
[1:48:10] right this is not a collective thing on
[1:48:13] one sense it is but it's actually it's
[1:48:14] just all individual
[1:48:16] remember god should be individual to you
[1:48:17] or not right so it's individuals
[1:48:20] that that are actually a wick that their
[1:48:23] feet you could say are in the oil
[1:48:25] and the light is burning and it's
[1:48:27] drawing the oil through their vessel and
[1:48:29] it's now pouring out as
[1:48:31] i mean once it was just a dormant
[1:48:33] substance that had potential
[1:48:35] but now it's got a place to be drawn
[1:48:37] through and give light to the world
[1:48:39] as the oil right so now here we are
[1:48:43] we are here as lights to the world
[1:48:46] we are all now with the seven golden
[1:48:49] candlesticks there was one reservoir of
[1:48:51] oil
[1:48:51] that lit all seven so the same holy
[1:48:54] ghost that
[1:48:55] that was being drawn through paul and
[1:48:57] his light to the world
[1:48:58] was the same one that was through
[1:49:00] irenaeus and martin
[1:49:02] and polycarp and all the believers down
[1:49:03] through columbus different ones
[1:49:05] that same oil was in azusa street that
[1:49:08] same oil is through the prophet of god
[1:49:10] that same oil is in the bride because
[1:49:11] we're adapted to the same reservoir of
[1:49:13] oil amen
[1:49:14] how are you following me amen but now it
[1:49:17] takes it takes a lighting of that whip
[1:49:20] to draw what's in the reservoir to bring
[1:49:23] it forth
[1:49:23] oh god what's good having a having a
[1:49:26] great
[1:49:27] lamp stand that can give light without
[1:49:29] an ignition
[1:49:31] remember there was a whole 120 candles
[1:49:34] or lampstands in the upper room
[1:49:36] they needed an ignition but when they
[1:49:38] were ignited they changed the world uh
[1:49:42] they had something to fight with now
[1:49:44] they had a living god on the inside the
[1:49:45] inside of them that help them fight
[1:49:47] live through them now what is a
[1:49:49] candlestick it's a lamp stand and notice
[1:49:51] how beautiful here
[1:49:52] when he turned he saw this one like the
[1:49:55] son of man
[1:49:56] here standing in the midst of these
[1:49:57] seven golden lampstands
[1:49:59] which means seven church ages to come
[1:50:01] and each pipe or lamp stand
[1:50:04] um hooked into the main oil sensor and
[1:50:07] this oil
[1:50:08] come forth to a little odd-shaped lamp
[1:50:11] that set with a wick in it
[1:50:13] and the wick hung down into the oil and
[1:50:15] they poured the oil into the top of the
[1:50:16] stand which
[1:50:17] filled up the main big stem the big
[1:50:20] branch and it ran out into the stems
[1:50:21] like this
[1:50:22] and the lamp with the wick hanging down
[1:50:25] this pipe and it kept burning day and
[1:50:27] night
[1:50:27] you never had to light it it never went
[1:50:29] out they just had to keep pouring oil
[1:50:31] into the main pipe
[1:50:34] hallelujah we've got plenty of oil
[1:50:36] there's not an oil crisis here
[1:50:38] in this world there's no oil crisis
[1:50:40] there's no shortage
[1:50:41] and these lamp stands would come out
[1:50:43] like this lamp sitting
[1:50:45] uh on top of them the wick from the lamp
[1:50:47] uh run down into here got its life from
[1:50:50] out of here
[1:50:51] oh what difference it is from a candle
[1:50:53] how different it's a lamp stand and it's
[1:50:55] pulling oil
[1:50:57] now these lamp stands the fire that was
[1:50:59] in these lamp stands in the old
[1:51:00] testament
[1:51:01] when they lit one lamp they could not
[1:51:02] light the next lamp with the same fire
[1:51:05] they had in their hand they would like
[1:51:06] one lamp then pick it up and let the
[1:51:08] other lamp
[1:51:09] then set it down and then lit this lamp
[1:51:11] then took the other one
[1:51:12] and lit this lamp with the same fire
[1:51:14] that they started at the beginning
[1:51:16] oh i hope it don't go over your heads
[1:51:18] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:51:20] and forever the same fire of the holy
[1:51:21] ghost lit every one of those churches
[1:51:23] right down through the ages
[1:51:25] so the fire that fell on pentecost lit
[1:51:27] the next stage then it lit the next
[1:51:29] stage
[1:51:29] then it's come down to the seventh age
[1:51:31] and slit the sage up
[1:51:33] hallelujah then he says here oh a real
[1:51:36] wick of god
[1:51:37] is a believer is a wick look he's got a
[1:51:40] fire on one end up here
[1:51:42] and the other end he's dipped into the
[1:51:43] oil joy and oil are making fire what a
[1:51:46] church
[1:51:47] what a power what a place to be
[1:51:49] hallelujah
[1:51:50] even this is what we are we're at work
[1:51:52] come watch me burn i'm on fire
[1:51:54] hallelujah fire fire fire that's what it
[1:51:56] is
[1:51:57] hallelujah and this is this is what we
[1:51:59] need
[1:52:01] you say well i've i know the potentials
[1:52:03] of it
[1:52:04] just like you know i don't have a
[1:52:05] picture but but you know there's been a
[1:52:07] few
[1:52:07] uh space shuttles launched satellites
[1:52:10] and things and
[1:52:11] you know they know the potential of
[1:52:13] what's in the gas tanks
[1:52:15] they know what the fuel can do they know
[1:52:17] the potential of each stage and what it
[1:52:19] can do
[1:52:20] but when it's ignited everything they
[1:52:23] have learned in theory
[1:52:25] is actually in practice and it becomes a
[1:52:27] reality
[1:52:28] when that ignition happens it can sit
[1:52:30] there on the launch pad looking pretty
[1:52:32] so yep this is going to the moon or this
[1:52:34] is going to the international space
[1:52:35] station or this is going wherever
[1:52:37] maybe one day it's going to mars but the
[1:52:40] potential can't just sit as potential
[1:52:42] it's going to become a manifestation so
[1:52:45] what's in the gas tank has to be ignited
[1:52:47] and it's got to go through the
[1:52:49] stratosphere and it's the same thing
[1:52:51] with you and i
[1:52:51] this word is full of this is unlimited
[1:52:54] potential amen
[1:52:55] the power of this word is unlimited amen
[1:52:58] hallelujah but it takes an ignition and
[1:53:01] i'm not saying you're not ignited
[1:53:03] hallelujah but if your eyes you say lord
[1:53:05] just just draw i'm going to draw more
[1:53:07] draw more of your word through draw more
[1:53:09] of your presence through hallelujah to
[1:53:11] give more light to the world that people
[1:53:12] would see
[1:53:13] joy people would see something they
[1:53:15] actually want
[1:53:16] not a not a dry-eyed confession not a
[1:53:18] stiffer stiff and starchy stirred oh i'm
[1:53:21] a christian and prosciutto
[1:53:22] no but a joy and a love and exuberance
[1:53:25] and a fire and a passion
[1:53:27] huh and a real genuine love hallelujah
[1:53:30] shouldn't it be that way
[1:53:32] amen amen he's got one firearm one end
[1:53:36] up here and the other is dipped into oil
[1:53:38] hallelujah
[1:53:49] to see the fire of god live
[1:53:53] that amen could come into this place and
[1:53:56] they could have this kind of look on
[1:53:57] their face

[1:54:01] way
