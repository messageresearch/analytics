[34:52] Lord, we know that
[34:55] many things we can do too much. Lord, we
[34:57] can't pray too much. We can't be as Lord
[35:00] so much. Lord, we continue to praise and
[35:02] worship this morning. We thank you,
[35:03] Lord, for your goodness, your mercy
[35:05] [music] to us. Thank you for your your
[35:08] love, Lord, for the we
[35:12] Lord, where it's a warm atmosphere. It's
[35:14] not a your your spirit is not cold. It's
[35:17] not. We don't feel like we're turned
[35:19] away. We don't feel like we're unwanted,
[35:22] Lord, but it feels warm. It feels like
[35:23] we're wanted. It feels like we belong in
[35:25] your presence, Lord. So, we just thank
[35:26] you for everything that you are [music]
[35:28] this morning. We thank you for blessing
[35:29] us, Lord.
[35:31] Thank you for each one that's come here,
[35:32] Lord, that you've you've worked the
[35:35] supernatural work in each heart here.
[35:37] It's not just an accident, but you've
[35:38] supernaturally
[35:40] worked by your divine power in each
[35:42] heart, Lord. and you've meticulously
[35:44] planned each and every one of our lives
[35:46] from the day that we're born, Lord, to
[35:48] to call us to and draw us to yourself.
[35:50] So, we just thank you for that. We pray
[35:52] you'll bless Brother Ben as he's
[35:53] ministering this morning at the um in
[35:56] the Philippines. You just bless those
[35:58] meetings. May there be a powerful
[35:59] outpouring of your spirit. And may there
[36:02] be a unity and a love amongst the
[36:04] believers there. And may they just be
[36:06] strengthened in their faith, Lord. May
[36:08] the lost be saved. May the sick be
[36:09] healed. May the may those that are bound
[36:12] be set free Lord and those that are

[36:28] &gt;&gt; Good to see you all.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for making the effort to
[36:32] come along
[36:34] to um worship the Lord this morning.
[36:36] Just as you're standing, thank you
[36:37] musicians. Let's go to um John 10
[36:42] verse 28.
[36:48] Used to be that you'd hear hear the
[36:49] rustle of um rice paper,
[36:53] which is the thin um pages of the Bible,
[36:57] but these days you can't quite hear a
[36:59] scroll, can you? People tapping on their
[37:01] screen to get to the scripture. Who
[37:04] still uses who use us? Who uses paper?
[37:08] And who uses modern currency?
[37:14] John 10:28 says, "And I give unto them
[37:16] eternal life, and they shall never
[37:17] perish, neither shall any man pluck them
[37:19] out of my hand. My father which gave
[37:22] them me is greater than all, and no man
[37:24] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[37:25] hand." May God bless his word. You can
[37:27] have your seats this morning.
[37:30] So
[37:33] when I was at the camp on Sunday, I sort
[37:37] of let out that I was heading up to
[37:38] Oakland on the Monday. I had to be there
[37:40] Tuesday, Wednesday
[37:42] for something. And I mentioned to one of
[37:44] the brothers up there that um
[37:47] I was going to be up there for the for
[37:49] the week. And I really wanted to get to
[37:51] brother um Freddy's church RFBF because
[37:55] I'd never actually set foot in their
[37:57] fellowship in forever. I think they've
[38:00] been there maybe 10 11 12 13 14 years or
[38:04] 20 years or a long time but I've never
[38:05] set foot in there. So this was my chance
[38:07] and then um they
[38:12] sort of got wind of that and then they
[38:13] asked me to speak and when when he asked
[38:16] me to speak something said to me to say
[38:18] yes. So I said yes, but I didn't really
[38:22] have much time to prepare. Then I got
[38:23] this little thought
[38:26] that that came on as soon as I had the
[38:29] I the
[38:31] as soon as I was asked to go up there
[38:33] and the thought was an attraction.
[38:36] But this was like a Sunday and I had to
[38:38] still do the Sunday night services and
[38:39] they go till quite late then the Monday
[38:40] then drive to Oakland and work for a
[38:42] couple of days and I realized I had no
[38:44] time to to speak to get anything ready.
[38:47] So, I kind of pulled out an old sermon
[38:49] that I had sitting in
[38:52] in in my computer for that one. But I
[38:55] want I want to speak on the thought an
[38:57] attraction um this morning. So,
[39:02] this is a this is a thought called an
[39:05] attraction.
[39:07] I'm I'm going to teach for a bit, then I
[39:10] want to preach for a bit. Okay?
[39:12] And
[39:15] maybe I won't go the typical way that
[39:16] you go when you hear about a word called
[39:19] an attraction.
[39:21] Um, but I'm going to go somewhere with
[39:23] it.
[39:26] Who's ever had an attraction?
[39:30] &gt;&gt; You got an I can feel a strong
[39:32] attraction from you to me, brother. It's
[39:34] the love of God.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; No doubt in your life you felt
[39:39] attraction somewhere.
[39:41] You brothers, young brothers have seen a
[39:43] car and you've been attracted to it.
[39:47] Or if you've been to a young people have
[39:49] been to a youth camp and been attracted
[39:50] to somebody at a youth camp was no one
[39:54] laughed but everyone knows that's why
[39:55] young people go to youth camps.
[39:57] [laughter]
[39:59] No, they go there for the Lord. But
[40:03] so I want to talk to you about this
[40:04] thought called an attraction.
[40:08] There was a man called Isaac Newton. And
[40:10] he was a scientist, Christian scientist.
[40:14] I think it was in the 1700s. And one day
[40:16] he was sitting under a tree. And no
[40:20] doubt he would be pondering scientific
[40:23] things, but also spiritual things
[40:24] because he was trying to see how it all
[40:26] related. And and and because he was a
[40:29] Christian, he was trying to find God and
[40:31] everything, too. I believe that they
[40:32] they when you base your thoughts on the
[40:35] wisdom of God then science m makes a lot
[40:37] more sense and then an apple fell to the
[40:41] ground. I think the story was
[40:42] embellished as it was told later on that
[40:44] said it fell on his head but I but the
[40:46] people don't believe it fell on his head
[40:49] but have you heard that it fell on his
[40:50] head or fell on the ground?
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Head. Yeah. I think that was made up you
[40:55] know [laughter]
[40:56] but as they say you don't let the truth
[40:58] get in the way of a good story.
[41:01] So this apple fell down and he wondered
[41:03] why did this apple fall to the ground?
[41:05] Why didn't it fall that way? Why didn't
[41:07] it fall up? Why didn't it fall that way?
[41:09] Why did it fall straight down to the
[41:10] ground?
[41:12] And then he came up with this
[41:16] concept or this law, the law of gravity.
[41:19] You could call it the gravitational law
[41:20] of attraction.
[41:22] And and this law states that every
[41:24] particle of matter in the universe
[41:26] attracts every other particle with a
[41:29] force directly proportional to the
[41:31] product of their masses and inversely
[41:33] proportional to the square of their
[41:34] distance between their centers.
[41:37] That make sense? I've got a graph here
[41:39] that will explain it slightly more so
[41:41] you understand it easier. [laughter]
[41:44] You know when you try to explain
[41:45] something and the people are more
[41:47] confused the second time. [laughter]
[41:50] Basically, in a nutshell, it means
[41:53] everything attracts everything else and
[41:55] the biggest object wins
[41:57] and it will attract it towards the
[41:58] center. That's why the apple will fall
[42:00] straight down towards the center of the
[42:02] earth and the center of the apple,
[42:03] right? Cuz the center of the earth will
[42:05] line up that way. And
[42:09] that's also why the apple falls towards
[42:10] the the big earth. The earth doesn't
[42:13] fall up and hit the apple
[42:15] cuz the earth is slightly bigger than
[42:17] the apple, right?
[42:19] And then but then in our universe we've
[42:22] got bigger objects floating around
[42:25] everywhere
[42:27] like the sun is bigger than us. So then
[42:30] it's got this it it's pulling things
[42:32] towards it and other things are pulling.
[42:33] It's like this big sort of pulling match
[42:35] and then in amongst this big pull this
[42:38] big everything is attracting everything
[42:40] else in amongst all this attraction
[42:42] stuff just ends up sitting rocks end up
[42:45] sitting in the sky.
[42:47] You ever thought about that? You look up
[42:48] and you see a rock sitting in the sky.
[42:52] It's hard to believe sometimes, but it's
[42:54] there. That's a big rock, but it's
[42:57] obviously there there's a traction that
[42:59] is pulling this thing and it just
[43:00] happens to find itself. Well, I got I'm
[43:02] being pulled this way, but I'm being
[43:03] pulled that way at the same time. So,
[43:04] I'll just my equilibrium is I just sit
[43:07] here sitting in the sky, right? It's
[43:11] attraction. Things are being attracted.
[43:14] Every everything attracts everything
[43:16] else. There's an attraction, right?
[43:20] Incidentally enough, Isaac Newton's
[43:21] apple tree is still alive.
[43:24] It's been grafted a few times, but the
[43:25] apple tree is still alive. If you want
[43:26] to go and see his tree, you can go and
[43:28] see his apple tree.
[43:30] So, the gravitational law of attraction
[43:31] is every everything attracts everything
[43:34] else and the biggest object wins. Now, I
[43:36] want to get to a spiritual side of this
[43:38] because we are spiritual people and
[43:40] every natural law has a spiritual
[43:41] application all the time. If you want to
[43:44] understand God, you can just look around
[43:45] you, see what laws he's put in place,
[43:47] and you can directly apply those two to
[43:49] the spiritual realm. And it and it just
[43:51] has to work like that because that's the
[43:53] way that God made it. He just he just
[43:54] matched it, right? So now when you talk
[43:57] about it, when you got this concept
[43:58] called attraction,
[44:00] bigger things have more attraction than
[44:02] smaller things. Like like I'll give you
[44:04] some examples. If you've got this man
[44:05] here playing music, nobody knows him. He
[44:08] maybe is okay, but he doesn't really
[44:09] have very good songs. His voice maybe
[44:11] not that good, whatever. He just he's
[44:13] not very good or he's he's not very
[44:15] attractive, right? He people will walk
[44:17] past him and think not much of it. He
[44:19] doesn't have a very strong attraction,
[44:22] although he has some attraction cuz
[44:23] someone's going to listen cuz every
[44:26] everything has some amount of
[44:27] attraction. Even very bad musicians have
[44:30] one or two fans, right?
[44:33] That's why I've got one or two.
[44:36] But [snorts] then if you get something
[44:38] that becomes they write some good music,
[44:41] some songs, the singer is good and then
[44:43] they get promoted, they get played on
[44:44] the radio, they get put on billboards on
[44:47] on TV, people start to like them. These
[44:49] people become larger than life. They
[44:50] become they have a strong attraction.
[44:54] They become attractive and they have a
[44:56] powerful attraction and they attract a
[44:59] lot of people, a lot of things to it
[45:01] because that that's just how this thing
[45:02] works. There's a force happening here.
[45:06] That's not a joke. It's a real thing.
[45:08] All right.
[45:10] Okay. Now, the concept is if it's bigger
[45:12] than you and you get close to it, that
[45:13] will have a powerful attraction.
[45:16] It will. You can't say, "Well, I'll get
[45:18] close to it. It won't attract me." It
[45:19] will attract you. If it's bigger than
[45:20] you, it will attract you. Right? Satan
[45:22] uses this concept. Uh same with say
[45:25] something like sports, like basketball.
[45:26] These guys are running around throwing a
[45:29] ball in a hoop.
[45:32] Kids aren't going to walk past these
[45:33] guys playing here and think, "Well, I
[45:34] want to be the I want to be a basketball
[45:36] player because this is just so
[45:36] attractive what these guys are doing out
[45:38] in the street throwing a ball." It's not
[45:39] overly attractive, but you create
[45:42] something bigger.
[45:44] A whole stadium that people are
[45:45] watching,
[45:47] it's on TV. The the the guys are on
[45:50] photos with Nike shoes and promoting
[45:52] that. And these these become big. This
[45:54] becomes very attractive. These starting
[45:57] five are like gods. the starting five of
[45:59] an NBA basketball team. If you're in the
[46:02] starting five, you're you're at the apex
[46:04] of like a sportsman in America. You're
[46:06] you're virtually royalty.
[46:09] England has kings and queens as royalty.
[46:11] America has actors and movie stars uh
[46:14] actors and singers and sports stars as
[46:16] that's that's their royalty. But it's
[46:18] got such a powerful attraction.
[46:21] Boys and girls as well will watch this
[46:23] and become so attracted. They will want
[46:24] to be like this because it's powerful.
[46:27] It has to attract, right? Uh even in the
[46:30] business world if someone there could be
[46:32] a guy running a little glass business
[46:33] with very good skills and he he he he
[46:35] runs good a good business makes money
[46:37] but he it's just a small little
[46:39] business. No one cares too much about
[46:40] him. But you get someone else like the
[46:42] right place the right time. This guy
[46:43] just happened to come across this idea
[46:45] to stream films instead of hire them and
[46:48] just happened to work at the right time.
[46:49] Then he becomes a an international
[46:52] business just because his concept was
[46:55] he's got smarts but he's not smarter
[46:56] than this guy, right? But his concept
[46:59] seem to work and suddenly he's got more
[47:00] attraction. So, you know, if you're
[47:02] going to have someone speak at your
[47:03] event, you're not going to get the glass
[47:04] guy cuz nobody knows them. They're not
[47:06] attracted to him. But even though he may
[47:08] be just as smart, but but the reason is
[47:11] this guy's got more attraction, right?
[47:13] Because everything attracts everything
[47:15] else. This guy just happens to attract a
[47:16] lot more of it. So you you want him and
[47:18] you're if you know this guy, you're
[47:19] proud I know the guy.
[47:22] We we work on that. We work on that
[47:25] attraction to and it it even comes down
[47:26] to in our everyday life, we have like a
[47:28] like a people can become larger than
[47:30] life and they can have an an attractive
[47:32] power over us. like a a boss or a leader
[47:35] in your circles. They can have an
[47:36] attractive power because they are
[47:37] slightly bigger than you. That's why
[47:39] there are rules against about work
[47:41] employee employee relationships. They
[47:43] have to the laws sometimes have to
[47:45] balance up the power because there's an
[47:48] attraction one way. You understand that
[47:50] that right? That's how this that's how
[47:52] this works. So now you get to this
[47:55] concept of scrolling attraction and
[47:57] algorithms. Right?
[47:59] This is the reason why this is if you
[48:02] design this is very good. If you don't
[48:04] like what it does, it's very bad. Right?
[48:06] But it's a very welldesigned mechanism
[48:09] to attract you and me, right? Because
[48:13] the concept of scrolling is you can keep
[48:14] scrolling forever until you find
[48:16] something that's going to attract you.
[48:18] Because there's a world out there that
[48:19] something is going to eventually attract
[48:21] your attention. You're eventually going
[48:23] to stop on something. The minute you do,
[48:25] the algorithm kicks in. Something has
[48:27] attracted you.
[48:29] And if you stop and read something, then
[48:31] the algorithm kicks in and says, "That's
[48:32] what they're attracted to. I will start
[48:34] feeding them that." So you you're as
[48:37] whatever you stopped on, that will start
[48:39] filling up your feed because that's what
[48:41] you're attracted to. And then it will
[48:42] create th this will lead young people
[48:44] down paths that they weren't going to
[48:46] go, right? This this leads lives because
[48:50] this is powerful attraction because it
[48:51] might show a sports star, might show a
[48:52] movie star, might show something and
[48:54] then it will keep showing it and it will
[48:56] it and and there's such a power of
[48:58] attraction that that pe that we don't
[49:01] when you get older you know what it's
[49:02] about so you stay away but when you
[49:04] don't know what it's about you get close
[49:05] to it and it attracts you. This is this
[49:08] leads people by the power of attraction.
[49:12] But I want to say I want to flip this
[49:15] now because Satan this is how he uses
[49:16] things. He uses his power of attraction
[49:18] to attract people down the way that he
[49:20] wants them to go.
[49:22] If you can take this the way that I that
[49:24] I mean it, the Lord has no attraction in
[49:27] this sense. Like he he's not very
[49:30] attractive. It's not like you look at
[49:32] him walking down the street and you
[49:33] think, "Wow, I want to be just like
[49:35] that.
[49:36] He's unattractive." And even the Bible
[49:38] says, "For he shall grow out before him
[49:39] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[49:42] the dry ground. He hath no form nor
[49:44] comeliness. And when we shall see him,
[49:45] there is no beauty that we should desire
[49:47] him. He's unattractive. He doesn't have
[49:50] the that the drawing power like what an
[49:52] NBA star does or a movie star does or a
[49:55] musician does. He's he's very
[49:56] unattractive in terms of the attraction
[49:58] that that we're talking about. And you
[50:00] might say, well, people were attracted
[50:01] to him.
[50:03] They weren't really attracted to him.
[50:05] They were just attracted to the fact
[50:06] that they could get something out of him
[50:08] because you're attracted to yourself as
[50:10] well. And if you can benefit, you're
[50:11] going to be attracted to that, right? So
[50:13] that so that that's a a big part of his
[50:15] initial attraction was because uh here
[50:18] here's a list of the generally why
[50:20] people were attracted to him. They
[50:21] wanted to be healed or something fixed.
[50:23] I've got a daughter that's sick. My
[50:24] mother's sick. I'm sick. Uh my servants
[50:27] like this. I need this. I need some
[50:29] money here. I need I need something. So
[50:30] they're attracted like that. Or some
[50:32] people are just fascinated by it because
[50:33] they heard he was healed. So what?
[50:34] There's a fascination. This guy's doing
[50:36] healing. I'll go and have a look at it.
[50:37] You know, they're fascinated by this. Or
[50:39] then he had his critics that hated him
[50:41] hang around him because they hated him.
[50:42] want to see what he's up to. What's he
[50:43] saying now to try and catch him out? Uh
[50:46] and then and then there's this group
[50:47] that just want to see what the
[50:48] attraction's about. Why are all the
[50:50] people standing around? So there more
[50:51] people standing around. That's
[50:52] attraction creates attraction. Like if
[50:54] you're at a store at a home show or
[50:56] something like that, a little trick you
[50:58] want to do is we always joke about you
[51:00] want to rent a crowd, you know? So you
[51:01] have people you have supposed people in
[51:03] your store looking at your things that
[51:04] you're trying to sell and that will
[51:05] attract attention. Other people will
[51:07] come. It's a natural phenomenon that you
[51:10] could have nobody in your stall and when
[51:11] you get two or three people stop to talk
[51:13] then suddenly the whole everyone stops
[51:14] and wants to what are they looking at?
[51:16] There must be something good cuz there's
[51:17] a few people attracted to it. That's how
[51:18] we humans work. Okay. So if you're in if
[51:21] you're at a if you're at one of these
[51:23] stores you get a renter crowd work your
[51:25] wonders and within this there was a
[51:28] small amount that actually loved the
[51:29] word of God. A very small amount that
[51:31] were attracted to the word of God. But
[51:33] most of the attraction was was this
[51:35] other stuff.
[51:37] Shan and I when we lived in China we
[51:40] some we lived in this village very poor
[51:42] people you know living on one new a day
[51:44] which is like 20 cents a day and they
[51:46] said to us there's this amazing park up
[51:49] in the hills there and and it's a been
[51:52] there for hundreds of years and it's got
[51:53] all sorts of amazing things there and
[51:54] and uh this weekend is a free day and
[51:57] we're going to all go along say would
[51:58] you like us to take you along to this
[51:59] park you know it's a free day so we not
[52:03] really thinking much of it not really
[52:04] thinking of the dense population of
[52:06] China We thought, "Yeah, we'll go along
[52:07] to this this park." We got there, man.
[52:10] It was like it was like standing room
[52:12] only in this park because it was free
[52:14] that one day of the year. I mean, this
[52:16] park cost you 20 cents to get in. Like,
[52:20] but if you know what the Chinese are
[52:22] like, they they're very thrifty, you
[52:23] know? So, if there's a if I can save 20
[52:24] cents, which is one UN, then the whole
[52:26] it's like the whole of China went to
[52:27] this park that same day. It was it was
[52:31] Shannon actually had Dave. He was a
[52:33] little guy. was even I I shouldn't tell
[52:35] that story.
[52:39] I can't tell it, can I?
[52:42] Okay. So, she's breastfeeding at the
[52:44] time, right? And and so, and there's so
[52:47] many people, there's nowhere to sit. So,
[52:48] she's she sits out in the middle up by
[52:50] this tree in this field and and puts
[52:52] this umbrella over her to to breastfeed
[52:54] Dave. There were so many people around
[52:56] and people are so inquisitive. And also
[52:59] when we lived there, I think it took me
[53:01] three months before I saw one white
[53:03] person because we were way up in this
[53:05] old village in this quite a big city.
[53:07] But there was that back then was no one
[53:08] else there apart from Chinese. And a the
[53:12] place was packed in this park and b they
[53:13] were so inquisitive. People were
[53:16] actually going and lifting up the
[53:17] umbrella to think what's underneath this
[53:19] umbrella.
[53:21] The only word I knew I I knew a few
[53:22] words cuz we hadn't been there long in
[53:24] Chinese. One word I knew was chu, which
[53:26] is go. like go. I felt like someone
[53:29] chasing away I shouldn't say it but it's
[53:31] it was just I'm not saying this in a
[53:32] disrespectful way but I felt like
[53:33] someone was chasing away like seagulls
[53:35] from getting at your food. You know I
[53:36] was going chew chew and these guys would
[53:38] run and they would run and they would
[53:39] run. I say chew chew like [laughter]
[53:43] but they something about us was
[53:45] attractive.
[53:47] We were walking down the street one time
[53:50] and we saw these little puppies for sale
[53:52] on the street and I always like dogs and
[53:55] I was thinking about getting a little
[53:56] dog when I was there. So, we started
[53:58] looking at these dogs and then and then
[54:00] there was a massive crowd around the
[54:03] dogs. And I said to Shannon, "Man, these
[54:04] dogs must be quite popular. People must
[54:06] really like dogs." And Shannon said,
[54:08] "No, they're all basically they're all
[54:10] looking at us." That's that was the
[54:12] [laughter]
[54:13] every time you'd stop, you'd gather a
[54:15] crowd. Then you'd move on and you'd
[54:16] gather a crowd. It's attraction.
[54:20] But with the Lord, when the attraction
[54:22] wore off, most of the people left.
[54:26] When the when the human attraction, the
[54:28] natural human attraction wore off, most
[54:30] of the people left. It was the same in
[54:31] Brother Brandham's ministry when he was
[54:33] healing. When there was something people
[54:34] could get out of it, they could be
[54:35] healed. They could they almost used him
[54:37] like a fortune teller. Can you tell me
[54:38] something about my life because I'm
[54:39] having this problem? Can Can you help me
[54:41] sort it out?
[54:43] When when that wore off, the people
[54:44] left. Most of the people left. It was
[54:47] look at look at this. It was massive
[54:49] because there was such a strong
[54:50] attraction to to this to being healed or
[54:52] to getting something. But overall, the
[54:55] gospel is a small unattractive thing. It
[54:58] really is a it's unattractive. It
[54:59] doesn't have the the the attractive
[55:01] power that these other things have. Like
[55:05] like the apex of it is a man walking
[55:07] around speaking somewhere. You try and
[55:10] promote that in like a a fast-paced
[55:12] video, what are your shots going to be?
[55:14] A person talking talking. It's not like
[55:16] basketball. They're jumping up, slam
[55:17] dunking on music, whatever. It's just
[55:19] it's very
[55:21] Jes Paul even talked about it's he
[55:23] called it the foolishness of preaching.
[55:26] He said the Lord has chosen to to make
[55:28] this mechanism called the foolishness of
[55:30] preaching to to spread the gospel. What
[55:33] the world looks at as foolish. That's
[55:34] such a foolish, unattractive thing. And
[55:36] that's the best you got. You know, it's
[55:39] that's such an unattractive thing. A man
[55:42] just walking around maybe in a little
[55:43] house group and speaking the word of
[55:44] God. It's that that's that that's what
[55:46] this gospel is. It's it's it's very
[55:48] small. It's very very unattractive. I
[55:51] just want to cut back to this for a
[55:52] second, but Satan works on the principle
[55:54] of attraction. That's how he does
[55:55] things. He wants to he works on this
[55:57] power of attraction. And it's called the
[55:59] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[56:00] the pride of life, and those that's all
[56:02] that's in the world really. And they all
[56:05] have attractive power. The lust of the
[56:07] flesh. Your body wants something. And
[56:08] you're even could be sexually the lust
[56:10] of the eyes you look things you want it
[56:11] the pride of life you want to be
[56:13] something it's it's attraction and
[56:15] because in John it says for all that is
[56:17] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[56:19] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[56:20] is not of the father but is of the world
[56:22] and that's the pulling power that that
[56:24] Satan uses but that the rule is that
[56:26] you'll only do something willingly if
[56:28] you were attracted to it I put a person
[56:30] here painting cuz why would anyone want
[56:31] to go and paint you know like this
[56:34] you know it's so boring but yet if
[56:36] you're attracted to it you'll invest
[56:37] money into painting. I say that cuz
[56:40] Shannon's a painter. I'm not going to
[56:42] joke anymore. You But if you're
[56:44] attracted to something, you will you
[56:45] will invest time, you your money, your
[56:47] time, you you'll move towards it because
[56:50] you're attracted to it.
[56:53] And there's money to be made in this
[56:55] thing called attraction. Don't do this
[56:57] if you're a businessman, but that but
[56:59] there's a general rule that if you can
[57:00] tap into this power of attraction,
[57:01] there's money to be made. This is an old
[57:03] adage that it just repackaged all sorts
[57:05] of different ways. But you can sell men
[57:07] lust and they'll buy it. You can sell
[57:09] women beauty. You can sell parents peace
[57:11] of mind. You can sell the elderly
[57:13] health. You can sell the youth dreams.
[57:15] How many times have you seen a young
[57:16] person being sold a dream? Here's a
[57:19] dream. It's going to cost you $100,000
[57:20] in university fees. But here's a dream.
[57:23] And and and they and every year there's
[57:25] a new generation coming to buy it. I'll
[57:26] buy the dream. I'll buy the dream. You
[57:28] sell the rich security. How how are we
[57:30] going to store this money when there's a
[57:32] recession on? It's strange because the
[57:33] things that that go up in value are
[57:35] things like art, an art piece. Cuz where
[57:37] am I going to put my money? The market's
[57:38] down. The if I invested in currency,
[57:41] currency is dropping. I need to put it
[57:42] somewhere. I'll buy a piece of art, a
[57:45] painting. Cuz by the end of the
[57:46] recession, it's still a painting. This
[57:49] you can sell the broken hope. Sell them
[57:51] hope. Sell someone that's broke. Sell
[57:53] them hope. There's hope. Some way if you
[57:55] can get money out of them, even though
[57:56] the guy's broke, you could someway get
[57:58] money to tell him there's hope and
[58:00] invest in this scheme for hope.
[58:04] And what hap what's happened now is the
[58:06] church then tries to make the gospel and
[58:07] make Jesus attractive.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; They they try and package it up like
[58:11] Satan packaged it up his stuff and let's
[58:13] try and make this attractive so so it
[58:15] will attract people. It it will it
[58:18] create an attraction like like we we
[58:20] they have there's attractive music. They
[58:22] they if it was a brochure, they sell
[58:24] hope and reform is your life like this.
[58:25] I'll give you hope and reform. They sell
[58:27] it as an attractive package. You're
[58:30] poor. God will make you rich. I'll sell
[58:31] you prosperity. Um uh you got no
[58:34] friends. I'll sell you a community. You
[58:35] can have friends. They try and package
[58:37] it like it's attractive. Uh I'll sell a
[58:39] good God that's always going to be good
[58:40] to you. Yeah. He's never going to be
[58:42] upset. He's always going to be good.
[58:43] He's always going to think you're the
[58:44] best thing in the world. Uh sometimes he
[58:47] doesn't. [laughter]
[58:49] Sometimes he doesn't. or I'll sell you
[58:51] the idea that everything was always
[58:52] going to work out great for you. You're
[58:53] going to It's like this package that
[58:55] that we try and make it so attractive
[58:57] and yet it's not really the truth. It's
[59:00] it's not really this. Sometimes
[59:04] sometimes things don't go well for you.
[59:05] Some sometimes you you stay dirt poor
[59:08] your whole life. Sometimes all your
[59:10] friends leave you. there might be a
[59:11] trouble in the church and that you many
[59:14] people come and go because they get they
[59:15] sign up to something attractive and then
[59:17] when it doesn't work they're gone
[59:18] because this this isn't what I signed up
[59:20] for. I was attracted to it. Now it's not
[59:22] what I thought I'm gone. And that's the
[59:26] way about music. This is this is a big
[59:29] church in Wellington. I think it's
[59:32] probably the biggest church for a while
[59:34] there. It was the biggest church in the
[59:35] country. Oh, you used to go there?
[59:37] probably.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:41] So, I don't want to say who the guy is
[59:42] because I I like the guy that runs it. I
[59:44] I actually
[59:46] I know him. He when I lived in Oakland
[59:50] in on Wii Island, he they had a big
[59:52] church in Oakland and he would come
[59:54] across we were trying to start some
[59:55] outreach services on Wii Island and I
[59:58] was at the Baptist church at the time
[59:59] and and this guy would come over and and
[1:00:01] his church would help us there. There's
[1:00:03] only like 10 of us at the church there.
[1:00:05] And and he would travel over and be
[1:00:07] helping us to set up these sort of
[1:00:09] Friday night youth outreach things. A
[1:00:12] and look, this is no disrespect to this
[1:00:13] guy because he's he's a nice guy. He's a
[1:00:15] good guy. So, I don't want it's not
[1:00:17] about that. But his concept to make it
[1:00:19] work, he said, "What you've got to do is
[1:00:20] you got to have attractive music."
[1:00:22] That's the main thing. That that's what
[1:00:23] we're going for here because obviously
[1:00:24] musicians. So, it's like the main thing
[1:00:25] is you got to make the music attractive.
[1:00:27] Young people love music. Make the music
[1:00:29] attractive. That's how we're going to
[1:00:30] that's what we're going to base this
[1:00:31] whole thing on is attractive music. So,
[1:00:33] we're going to base the the outreach of
[1:00:34] the gospel on attractive music.
[1:00:37] That's the attraction, but that's that's
[1:00:40] not a keeping power. It's not an
[1:00:41] attraction, but it obviously worked
[1:00:43] here. [laughter]
[1:00:44] But that's that's the concept.
[1:00:47] I've got this up here because Shannon's
[1:00:49] been saying about she likes the word 44
[1:00:50] cuz she's 44. And I think Sister Genie
[1:00:52] turned 44. So, they're saying 44.
[1:00:55] And when I was when she was saying that,
[1:00:57] I thought I'm sure there's something
[1:00:58] that Brother Brandham said about 44. And
[1:00:59] he said this. He said, "You Baptists are
[1:01:01] hollering a million more of 44. What
[1:01:04] have you got when you get what have you
[1:01:06] got when you got them? Just a bunch of
[1:01:08] sinners come in with their names on the
[1:01:09] book. That's right. Say they belong to
[1:01:10] the Baptist church." Not only that, but
[1:01:12] the other Methodists Campellites and the
[1:01:14] whole group just as informal and and
[1:01:16] different and indifferent. Billy Graham
[1:01:18] had that. He said 30,000 converts. He
[1:01:21] said in 6 weeks and 6 weeks later he
[1:01:24] couldn't find 30. Why? They never got
[1:01:27] nothing to start with. just a bunch of
[1:01:29] sinners when they put their name on the
[1:01:30] book under the spell of a revi of a
[1:01:32] revival or under this attraction. They
[1:01:35] just created this big attraction to to
[1:01:37] attract people, but there was really
[1:01:38] nothing to it. And brother Brown calls
[1:01:41] it the spell of a revival. It just you
[1:01:43] you go and try and find people 6 weeks
[1:01:44] later of the 30,000 that were attracted
[1:01:46] you got you can't find 30. And
[1:01:49] unfortunately, that's how that's how
[1:01:51] that's how the the the man in his in his
[1:01:54] carnal wisdom because he's using the
[1:01:56] wisdom of this world is trying to build
[1:01:58] the gospel, build the church and build a
[1:02:00] connection with God and establish
[1:02:02] everything as on this natural power of
[1:02:04] attraction which will never work. And
[1:02:06] brother says, I'm afraid we've made it
[1:02:08] too easy. It's he says, I love I think
[1:02:09] joy. Certainly, I believe that all joys
[1:02:12] lays in Jesus Christ. That's right. I
[1:02:14] believe it's joyful and happy, but
[1:02:15] remember, brother, it's the way of agony
[1:02:17] and suffering in the cross. You must
[1:02:18] realize that too. That's right. I wonder
[1:02:20] if we haven't painted a little too a
[1:02:22] little too smooth. That we've just made
[1:02:24] it so attractive and then people get
[1:02:26] disappointed when it's not actually what
[1:02:27] the brochure says on some weeks and some
[1:02:30] months and some years and some decades.
[1:02:33] But I don't want to make this too
[1:02:35] negative because I'm actually going
[1:02:36] somewhere with this cuz I want to show
[1:02:38] you really the what keeps us attracted
[1:02:42] and what keeps me attracted cuz I've
[1:02:44] been through so much stuff in my life. I
[1:02:45] think, Lord, what why do I keep on going
[1:02:47] with this thing? Half the time things
[1:02:50] don't work out. Everything doesn't go
[1:02:52] the way that it should. It's just I seem
[1:02:54] to be worse off after the time. And I
[1:02:55] think to myself, what is there in me
[1:02:58] that makes me keep doing this? Because
[1:03:00] this doesn't make any sense. I'm not
[1:03:02] attract there's not enough attraction to
[1:03:04] this. And a natural attraction, if I
[1:03:06] could put it that way, if I was honest,
[1:03:08] if that's all there was, I'd be gone.
[1:03:12] If there was just natural attraction
[1:03:13] that I'm attracted to it, I would be
[1:03:15] done with this whole thing. But there's
[1:03:16] something bigger than all that in this
[1:03:18] whole thing. There's a there's a there's
[1:03:20] a more powerful attraction in this that
[1:03:22] actually is what we preach and it's
[1:03:23] actually the gospel and it's the word of
[1:03:25] God. But yet God's a god of attraction.
[1:03:30] This is just I just want to say this for
[1:03:32] five minutes then I want to go into
[1:03:33] something else that I really want to
[1:03:34] talk about.
[1:03:36] But God is into being attracted to the
[1:03:39] right thing. And attraction does bring
[1:03:41] unity and attraction does bring life.
[1:03:43] Like if I give an example, this
[1:03:44] scripture here says, "Behold, how good
[1:03:46] and how pleasant it is for brethren to
[1:03:49] dwell together in unity." Then he goes
[1:03:51] on to say, "It's like the precious
[1:03:52] ointment, the anointed oil that runs
[1:03:53] down Aaron and down his bed and down the
[1:03:56] skirts of his garment." But if you go to
[1:03:58] the first verse here, the the first
[1:04:02] concept in this is the people as
[1:04:04] brethren. It's not saying how good it is
[1:04:07] for an unbeliever and a believer to be
[1:04:10] in unity, right? He's not saying that.
[1:04:12] He says brethren, so it's based on the
[1:04:14] right thing, right? This attraction's
[1:04:16] got to be based on the right thing. And
[1:04:18] then within that, the brethren have to
[1:04:20] have an attraction to each other. Like
[1:04:22] like brother Phil and I do, you know, at
[1:04:24] the start he I felt the attraction.
[1:04:26] There's an attraction. He loves me, I
[1:04:28] love him. Therefore, we're attracted.
[1:04:31] And then it it creates unity. It creates
[1:04:33] togetherness. That's God actually is
[1:04:35] still that, right? So I don't want to
[1:04:37] say God doesn't work in attraction
[1:04:38] because he does. But he wants us to be
[1:04:40] attracted to the right thing. And that's
[1:04:43] why he says by this shall all men know
[1:04:44] that you're my disciples if you have
[1:04:46] love one for the other. This a and love
[1:04:49] is an attraction. I love you. We're
[1:04:51] attracted. We we keep together because
[1:04:53] we're attracted. There's something that
[1:04:54] attracts us. It creates unity, right? If
[1:04:57] you don't like someone, you pull away.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; But if you love them, you go together,
[1:05:01] right?
[1:05:03] I'm going to talk about this for about 5
[1:05:05] minutes. This is a bit of a a byproduct,
[1:05:07] but there's a lot of things in life that
[1:05:09] we are attracted to that we don't even
[1:05:11] realize it. Okay?
[1:05:16] We are very attracted to life.
[1:05:20] Like you wake up in the morning and
[1:05:21] you're attracted to being alive. We
[1:05:23] don't realize it cuz when we die, I
[1:05:25] think we'll realize we were attracted to
[1:05:26] life. But we've got things in our
[1:05:29] natural body that are that's attracted
[1:05:31] to being alive. We don't we don't want
[1:05:32] to just die. We want to actually live
[1:05:34] like like we've got this awesome thing
[1:05:36] called adrenaline which when our body
[1:05:38] gets to a when our mind when everything
[1:05:40] senses that okay I my life may finish
[1:05:43] here my life is in grave danger. This
[1:05:46] thing called adrenaline which is sitting
[1:05:47] in all of you which is attracted to
[1:05:48] being alive it will come out and it will
[1:05:51] work because it wants to be alive. Your
[1:05:53] body is attracted to being alive. It's
[1:05:56] like I don't I don't want this life to
[1:05:58] finish. I want to stay alive. And you
[1:06:01] can't make it happen. It will just
[1:06:02] happen. And it's sitting inside all of
[1:06:04] you because there's an attraction in you
[1:06:05] to stay alive. It'll increase your heart
[1:06:07] rate. Suddenly your heart will go
[1:06:08] faster. It'll accelerate your breathing.
[1:06:10] You'll get more oxygen. It provides
[1:06:11] energy. Your kidneys actually will will
[1:06:13] actually instantly release all of this
[1:06:16] um all of glucose into your body
[1:06:18] straight away to give you instant
[1:06:19] energy. Whereas under normal
[1:06:21] circumstances, it'll just stay in there
[1:06:22] and digest it how it wants to. But it'll
[1:06:23] just instantly instantly release it.
[1:06:26] your your stomach will stop Joe's
[1:06:28] testing because all of the blood will go
[1:06:29] to all the other organs that need to
[1:06:30] fight to survive. Your pain tolerance
[1:06:33] virtually is a man could be running with
[1:06:35] a with his arm cut off and not feel the
[1:06:37] pain because he he's about to be shot
[1:06:39] again whatever is happening and or a man
[1:06:42] or woman and they could run and not feel
[1:06:44] the pain because your pain tolerance
[1:06:46] suddenly is pretty much obsolete. Like
[1:06:48] you you can you can no not obsolete it's
[1:06:50] the other way. You can tolerate any sort
[1:06:51] of pain because in yourself is an
[1:06:53] attraction to being alive. such a
[1:06:55] powerful attraction to being alive. And
[1:06:57] if that doesn't all if if you throughout
[1:07:00] the day too, if you're still under the
[1:07:01] stress, your body gives you like a it's
[1:07:03] called cortisol. It will help you
[1:07:04] throughout the day to actually then
[1:07:05] follow through to make sure you're
[1:07:07] you're still alive. I'm going to make
[1:07:08] sure you see you through the day. You're
[1:07:10] attracted to breathing.
[1:07:13] You're very attracted to breathing. You
[1:07:15] know, you breathe 22,000 times per day
[1:07:18] or 8 million times a year. You wake up
[1:07:20] in the morning and you breathe.
[1:07:23] You're attracted to food.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you why. Because the less
[1:07:26] you have of it, the more you want it.
[1:07:29] Look, we just The Lord's built this
[1:07:32] thing on attraction. We're attracted to
[1:07:33] it. The Bible says, "The full soul loth
[1:07:36] in a honeycomb,
[1:07:39] but to the hungry soul, every bitter
[1:07:41] thing is sweet."
[1:07:43] My last thing on this, you're very
[1:07:44] attracted to energy. Whether you,
[1:07:46] believe it or not, you're attracted to
[1:07:47] energy. Namely, you're very, very
[1:07:49] attracted to this big thing here. Cuz
[1:07:51] that big thing there got you here this
[1:07:53] morning.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for that, you wouldn't be
[1:07:56] here. Like like if you drove your car
[1:07:58] here, that big thing there, the world
[1:08:00] works on energy and it needs it needs
[1:08:02] energy to be pushed into it because it
[1:08:04] gets used up and it cycles through the
[1:08:05] system. And that's the only place we get
[1:08:07] it from.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; That there. If that disappeared, there'd
[1:08:10] be no energy in the world. That there
[1:08:12] grew plants. The plants died. They went
[1:08:14] into the ground. The created this oil.
[1:08:16] There was energy to get the oil out of
[1:08:17] the ground. Then it was put in your car
[1:08:18] and you drove here. And if you walked
[1:08:20] here, it grew the plants and you ate the
[1:08:21] food and you came here using your
[1:08:23] energy. You take that away, you have
[1:08:25] we're done. We love this. We're very
[1:08:27] attracted to this.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; I just want to put this in there
[1:08:32] because the spirit of God is the same as
[1:08:34] that. This world is under decay. It's
[1:08:36] constantly decaying, but there
[1:08:38] spiritually, but there is a there is
[1:08:40] currently now a spirit of God upon the
[1:08:42] earth that is actually putting
[1:08:45] energy is is is keeping this world
[1:08:47] together as we speak. We say, "Oh, the
[1:08:48] world's getting worse. The world's
[1:08:50] getting bad." It's not bad. The spirit
[1:08:52] of God's still here. It's not bad.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; It's actually okay. Like, the sun's here
[1:08:57] and the spirit of God's here. This is
[1:08:58] actually all okay. There is still
[1:09:01] sanity. We think the world's going
[1:09:02] insane. The world's not going insane.
[1:09:04] It's all being held together. You wait
[1:09:05] till the spirit of God leaves
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; because at that same time, it said the
[1:09:09] sun will be darkened around the same
[1:09:11] time because it's a type. You you stop
[1:09:13] the sun, life as we know it here just
[1:09:15] dies. It it doesn't take many days,
[1:09:19] weeks before civilization is dead if you
[1:09:22] take away the sun. Just like you take
[1:09:24] away the spirit of God, spiritually we
[1:09:25] just die. We we have this attraction,
[1:09:28] not even realizing it. This is what I
[1:09:31] want to preach a bit on this morning.
[1:09:32] Have I still got your attention?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Okay, you're very you're you're going to
[1:09:36] think naturally and spiritually with
[1:09:38] with this for a bit. Okay, I'm going to
[1:09:39] slow down. I want to get this through to
[1:09:41] you. Not not through to you that you
[1:09:42] don't understand, but I want to this
[1:09:44] blessed me. So I want to bless you with
[1:09:45] this thought. Okay. There's four what we
[1:09:50] call fundamental forces that exist in
[1:09:53] the universe. One of them is the force
[1:09:56] of gravity which was the the one first
[1:09:59] one we talked about. The next force is
[1:10:01] electromagnetism.
[1:10:03] The next force they call it a strong
[1:10:04] force and the next force they call it a
[1:10:07] weak force. right
[1:10:10] now. I'm not a physicist or a scientist
[1:10:14] or a um
[1:10:17] What are those guys like? Brother
[1:10:18] George, what does he do? He um um
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]
[1:10:25] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:10:27] So, so I may not get this perfectly
[1:10:28] right, but I I do know a small amount.
[1:10:31] All right. So, there are four
[1:10:33] fundamental forces in the world. We've
[1:10:35] talked about gravitation already. that
[1:10:38] that's a force that pulls each other to
[1:10:40] itself here.
[1:10:42] Gravity,
[1:10:44] it's a long range force and it's
[1:10:46] attractive, but it's very weak. Like
[1:10:48] like you can't have a bigger object here
[1:10:49] and a smaller one and they attract each
[1:10:50] other there, right?
[1:10:52] Electromagnetism.
[1:10:55] That's you've seen like magnets that
[1:10:56] will stick together and the other side
[1:10:58] won't come together. That's the that's
[1:10:59] that's an electro
[1:11:01] um magnetism force. That's what makes
[1:11:03] these the north and the south will
[1:11:05] connect. The other ones won't connect.
[1:11:06] There's a there's just a force that
[1:11:08] exists in the universe that if you
[1:11:10] duplicate it to a smaller degree, it
[1:11:12] will happen like that, right? There's
[1:11:14] what they call the weak nuclear force
[1:11:17] which is actually responsible for like
[1:11:19] when when molecules break down, they
[1:11:21] create radiation. It it breaks it down.
[1:11:23] That's that's what a weak nuclear force.
[1:11:25] And and there's this force called the
[1:11:27] strong nuclear force, which is the most
[1:11:31] powerful force in the universe, right?
[1:11:34] It's the most powerful force that exists
[1:11:36] in the universe.
[1:11:38] And the nature of this force is that
[1:11:41] it's attractive.
[1:11:43] Like gravity is attractive.
[1:11:45] Electromagnetism is not really
[1:11:46] attractive. It's more waves. It it will
[1:11:48] do what it does. But this the strongest
[1:11:51] force that exists in the world is a
[1:11:53] force that attracts. It pulls and it
[1:11:56] binds together. Right?
[1:11:59] So within you and me and within
[1:12:01] everything you can see and everything
[1:12:02] you can touch there are these tiny
[1:12:04] things called atoms that you can't see.
[1:12:07] They're minuscule. You can't see these
[1:12:08] things called atoms. They're tiny but
[1:12:10] they they
[1:12:12] we are all little billions and of atoms.
[1:12:16] That's what we are. That's what
[1:12:17] everything you can touch. We are atoms
[1:12:19] right?
[1:12:21] And within these little atoms you've got
[1:12:23] protons and you've got neutrons.
[1:12:27] Okay. So a proton is a positive
[1:12:29] electrical force and a neutron is a
[1:12:32] neutral. Right?
[1:12:37] The nature of these two of these two
[1:12:40] things is that the
[1:12:43] proton and the neut neutron because they
[1:12:45] are different. There's an
[1:12:46] electromagnetic force around a tiny atom
[1:12:50] that will create a force in there. So
[1:12:51] these two will stick together because
[1:12:54] it's like the north and the south comes
[1:12:55] together, right? That's no problem. The
[1:12:58] problem that you have inside an atom,
[1:13:00] the issue that that you have is that
[1:13:02] you've got these you've got neutrons
[1:13:05] trying to stick together and protons
[1:13:07] trying to stick together and they
[1:13:08] naturally want to repel.
[1:13:11] Right? So within the atom, it shouldn't
[1:13:15] hold together because everything within
[1:13:17] it wants to push apart. It doesn't want
[1:13:21] to stay together. It wants to push
[1:13:23] apart. Right? That's the nature of an
[1:13:24] atom.
[1:13:26] And theoretically it should all pull
[1:13:29] apart. Now when an atom pulls apart that
[1:13:32] means we fall apart. That means this
[1:13:36] pulpit here falls apart. That means your
[1:13:39] shoes fall apart.
[1:13:41] If these things come apart the universe
[1:13:44] falls apart,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; right? The this little thing here holds
[1:13:49] the whole universe together. Atoms. the
[1:13:51] these are when you dig right down to the
[1:13:53] building blocks of humanity of our
[1:13:55] existence here, atoms are the building
[1:13:57] block of humanity. Now, if this little
[1:13:59] thing falls apart, everything's done.
[1:14:02] Within this atom, there's this thing
[1:14:04] called the strong nuclear force that is
[1:14:07] attractive that's so attractive that it
[1:14:09] overrides every other force that exists
[1:14:11] in the universe. It overrides the
[1:14:13] electrome force and it pulls everything
[1:14:16] together. And no matter no matter what
[1:14:19] you throw at this little thing, you
[1:14:21] cannot break the force, the strong
[1:14:22] nuclear force, because they didn't they
[1:14:24] couldn't figure out another name for it.
[1:14:25] What should we call it? It's the
[1:14:27] strongest force we know of. Let's just
[1:14:28] call it the strong force.
[1:14:30] It it's attractive and it pulls together
[1:14:33] the atoms and everything that holds it
[1:14:35] that that that actually it it
[1:14:38] essentially holds all of us together as
[1:14:40] a strong attractive nuclear force.
[1:14:43] Right? That make sense?
[1:14:49] The strong nuclear force, also called
[1:14:51] the strong nuclear interaction, is the
[1:14:53] strongest of the four fundamental forces
[1:14:54] of nature. It is 6,000 trillion trillion
[1:14:57] times stronger than the force of
[1:14:58] gravity. This force is immense, right?
[1:15:05] It it's it's absolutely immense.
[1:15:08] The reason why I'm telling you this
[1:15:11] is because it has an attractive power
[1:15:14] that it binds things together that
[1:15:16] shouldn't otherwise be bound together
[1:15:19] that if it didn't work the whole
[1:15:21] universe falls apart.
[1:15:23] Now people have asked a question where
[1:15:25] did this force come from? I've looked
[1:15:27] tried to look into that and the answer
[1:15:28] is always well if we if we want to
[1:15:31] answer that we kind of have to answer
[1:15:32] who are we and why are we here because
[1:15:35] it really is this unique force that sits
[1:15:37] inside the atom that holds everything
[1:15:39] together and we just don't know why it's
[1:15:42] there but it's there and it's holding
[1:15:44] everything together. The reason why I
[1:15:46] say this is because when I go through
[1:15:48] hard times when I go through hardship
[1:15:50] when when things happen
[1:15:52] the gospel everything loses its
[1:15:54] attraction. I'm going to be honest with
[1:15:56] you. It if we're honest with ourselves,
[1:15:58] there are times when it loses its
[1:16:00] attraction. You you get you get so many
[1:16:02] things in life, you think this is not
[1:16:03] attractive. If I was just here attracted
[1:16:05] to being a Christian based on I'm going
[1:16:08] to get friends. I'm going to get things
[1:16:09] are going to go well for me. I'd walk
[1:16:11] away because it's unattractive. And I
[1:16:12] think Lord, why don't I walk away?
[1:16:14] There's something else that's holding me
[1:16:16] together.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a strong force.
[1:16:18] There's something within when I take
[1:16:20] when I break everything away. When I
[1:16:21] take it all away, when I take the music
[1:16:23] away, take take it all away. There's
[1:16:25] something more to this than just my
[1:16:27] attraction to it. There's something so
[1:16:29] powerful that binds me to God that's
[1:16:31] never going to be broken. At the core of
[1:16:33] who I am, there's a there's this there's
[1:16:35] an attractive power that that that pulls
[1:16:38] God and me together and will never be
[1:16:40] separated. That's why Paul says, "What
[1:16:41] shall separate us from the love of God?"
[1:16:43] It's such a powerful force. And we we
[1:16:47] have just started to understand the
[1:16:49] power of this force because we've got
[1:16:50] what they call a nuclear bomb.
[1:16:53] And what this thing is, what man has
[1:16:55] tapped into here is they have tapped
[1:16:57] into reversing this force that holds
[1:16:59] humanity together and sending it the
[1:17:01] other way. And this stuff is so
[1:17:03] powerful. You the mind can't comprehend
[1:17:06] the power in this stuff. the power in
[1:17:09] this force that was there which there's
[1:17:11] no other force like it in the and and in
[1:17:14] in World War II we had we had dynamite
[1:17:16] and we were chucking around dynamite and
[1:17:18] we were we were blowing up like we were
[1:17:21] blowing up whole cities with with
[1:17:23] dynamite and you know we we we go
[1:17:26] through we we fought in World War II for
[1:17:28] 5 years and we'd blow up cities and
[1:17:30] everyone was bombing each other they
[1:17:32] used 3 million tons of TNT and Europe
[1:17:35] was flattened the whole place was
[1:17:37] flattened The Russians designed this
[1:17:40] bomb here which is called the uh SAR
[1:17:43] bomb or the emperor bomb.
[1:17:46] This thing weighs 27 tons but it's the
[1:17:48] equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT.
[1:17:54] Look like we spent 5 years and bombed
[1:17:56] the whole of Europe and we we used up 3
[1:17:58] million. This thing's 50 million and
[1:17:59] that was half strength. This should be
[1:18:02] 100 million
[1:18:05] tons of TNT. What's it using? It's not
[1:18:09] using like a conventional TNT. It's it's
[1:18:11] tapping into the fabric of the very
[1:18:13] force that holds humanity together. It's
[1:18:16] reversing it right down in the very the
[1:18:20] very minuscule core of who we are. Man
[1:18:22] has got right in there and is about to
[1:18:25] reverse the whole thing that holds us
[1:18:27] together and send it out the other way.
[1:18:30] Look at Look at the scope of what we're
[1:18:32] doing. This is insanity.
[1:18:36] It's absolute insanity what we've done.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; But God's got a plan for all this. But
[1:18:41] look, you got Hiroshima and Nagasaka.
[1:18:44] These the little bombs that destroy
[1:18:45] cities. They're babies compared to what
[1:18:48] we've got. Look at the size of this
[1:18:50] thing. It's like 500 km in the like I
[1:18:53] think it's 50 km in the sky. It's it
[1:18:56] towers over Everest.
[1:18:58] The the biggest one over there, the the
[1:19:00] Emperor bomb, that's what it should have
[1:19:02] been. They they set this thing off at
[1:19:03] half strength. cuz they didn't want to
[1:19:05] set up a full strength. It was only
[1:19:06] released, I think 2014, 15, the secret
[1:19:09] footage of this thing that in in Russia
[1:19:11] they they did it up in the North Sea and
[1:19:13] they dropped this thing from a plane and
[1:19:14] got video footage of this massive bomb.
[1:19:18] And the power of this thing is it it
[1:19:21] takes the atom. It takes the atom and it
[1:19:24] takes the force that holds humanity
[1:19:25] together and it reverses it and it sends
[1:19:27] it the other way. and essentially uses
[1:19:29] the whole force against us.
[1:19:32] And it's the most powerful force. And
[1:19:34] that's that's where that's where we
[1:19:37] stand at today as a civilization. That
[1:19:39] this the very force that holds us
[1:19:41] together is about to be used against us.
[1:19:49] And I'm thinking about this and I'm
[1:19:51] thinking, Lord, there's there's a
[1:19:54] there's a type in all this because when
[1:19:55] you when you think about the magnitude
[1:19:58] of what's happening, that's why brother
[1:19:59] Bradom says there won't be one bomb fall
[1:20:02] till the bride's gone,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; right? And there's a reason for that.
[1:20:07] It's not just because, oh, let's get her
[1:20:08] out of there. There's there's there's
[1:20:10] more of a fundamental reason for this
[1:20:11] because if you can see what's happening,
[1:20:13] God works in types. And he's shown that
[1:20:16] that right down when you when you hold
[1:20:18] right down to the core of humanity, I'm
[1:20:20] holding it together.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; I'm holding it.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's the power of God. I've put
[1:20:26] something there to show you I'm holding
[1:20:27] this together when it shouldn't
[1:20:28] otherwise hold when I shouldn't hold
[1:20:30] together. When this shouldn't hold
[1:20:32] together, it it should fall apart. But
[1:20:34] I'm in there holding it all together.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And it's exactly the same. That's that's
[1:20:39] the same in our in our Christian walk.
[1:20:41] It's not me, Lord. I'm attracted. I'm
[1:20:43] going to try and hang on to you. There's
[1:20:45] a force that's there's an attractive
[1:20:47] force within when you take everything
[1:20:48] away that binds me to God. That that
[1:20:51] will never be separated. It it can it
[1:20:54] can never be torn apart. And it it's a
[1:20:57] natural type. So this thing can't be
[1:20:58] torn apart while I'm still on the earth
[1:21:00] because that would mean Lord, can I just
[1:21:01] be torn apart?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. with Lord that this this thing that
[1:21:08] this thing that that holds together
[1:21:10] humanity is going to is going to be
[1:21:12] holding everything together till I've
[1:21:13] gone when I'm gone this very thing that
[1:21:17] held humanity together is going to be
[1:21:20] turned and pull it all apart but I thank
[1:21:23] the Lord that when I'm gone we're going
[1:21:25] to go to another place where there's
[1:21:26] that same attractive that the the
[1:21:29] attractive keeping power of the Lord is
[1:21:31] going to is in eternity is going to bind
[1:21:34] you bind behind me bind it all together.
[1:21:36] We we're not going to be in this whole
[1:21:39] world is going to be done for.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; But I thank the Lord that when we get to
[1:21:42] the other side, there's going to be this
[1:21:44] attractive that that same thing that
[1:21:46] holds me together here, which is which
[1:21:49] is the word of God. It's it's even
[1:21:51] greater than that. It's his word. It's
[1:21:52] everything that he is just he's decided
[1:21:54] you're mine. I'm going to hold you. It
[1:21:56] doesn't matter if you can you can go
[1:21:58] through things in your life and and it
[1:22:00] could all not make sense and yet you
[1:22:01] still carry on with the Lord
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; like like those two these two atoms
[1:22:07] there's an argument to say they
[1:22:08] shouldn't be together and it's a
[1:22:10] legitimate argument this one does not
[1:22:13] bind to that one
[1:22:17] there's good arguments why you shouldn't
[1:22:18] carry on sometimes but this overrides
[1:22:21] all that there's a force that overrides
[1:22:24] that doesn't that doesn't have to make
[1:22:25] sense
[1:22:26] if it can all go bad.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; It it it doesn't there's it Yes, your
[1:22:31] argument is correct, but that whatever
[1:22:33] I'm still going on because there's
[1:22:34] something greater than all that that
[1:22:35] binds me to this. Like like you look at
[1:22:38] Paul, anyone that would you you think
[1:22:41] you think of the life that Paul lived
[1:22:42] that didn't make sense that he carried
[1:22:43] on doing what he was doing.
[1:22:46] Like he would be walking to a place to
[1:22:49] talk to people and he virtually have
[1:22:52] nothing. Very unattractive. If you know
[1:22:54] you want to be like Paul, he had
[1:22:55] nothing. He was poor. Then the small
[1:22:59] amount that he had, he would get robbed
[1:23:00] on the way. Then he would end up in a
[1:23:03] new place, still have nothing.
[1:23:08] He wouldn't suddenly get a Cadillac when
[1:23:10] he turned up or what we call like a nice
[1:23:12] brand new Ford when he turned up. Still
[1:23:15] have nothing when he arrived. No, I
[1:23:17] rephrase that. Less than what he had
[1:23:19] when he left. Then he's got to go and
[1:23:22] speak the gospel.
[1:23:24] Then maybe midway through that, the
[1:23:26] people in town realize he's there and
[1:23:28] they track him down and they if they
[1:23:29] don't stone him, he's got to quickly get
[1:23:31] out of the town. Why is he doing it?
[1:23:35] Like like what's attractive in that for
[1:23:37] him? You think about it?
[1:23:40] What's attractive?
[1:23:43] Like if if you said this is if you put
[1:23:44] that on a sales brochure, no one would
[1:23:46] take it.
[1:23:48] But we don't. That's not what we do.
[1:23:50] There's a there's an there's a an
[1:23:52] attractive force greater than what we
[1:23:54] are. Greater than everything that that
[1:23:55] actually it's God it's predestination
[1:23:56] that God said, "I've chosen you. I'm
[1:23:58] going to I'm going to attract you and
[1:23:59] I'm going to call you. I'm going to bind
[1:24:00] you together." There's an attractive
[1:24:02] force that's greater than all this
[1:24:03] stuff, greater than all your problems,
[1:24:05] greater than all your ups and downs. It
[1:24:06] actually binds us together that will
[1:24:08] that will pull us through everything.
[1:24:09] And I'll just enclose with this because
[1:24:12] you wonder why you get trouble in life.
[1:24:14] You wonder why you get attacks. You
[1:24:16] wonder why stuff happens. It has to
[1:24:18] happen. [laughter]
[1:24:20] because there's another law which is the
[1:24:23] second most powerful force which that's
[1:24:25] where Satan dwells in you know he's he's
[1:24:28] he's not number one he's number two but
[1:24:31] there's a force that says opposites will
[1:24:33] just attract
[1:24:34] but they'll never join they'll just and
[1:24:37] you you wonder the Bible says all that
[1:24:39] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:24:41] persecution
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; right so if you want to live a godly
[1:24:45] life and be connected with the Lord and
[1:24:47] have that when When you exist in the
[1:24:49] world, you're going to become attractive
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; the to the enemy. And you know what?
[1:24:57] He's going to become attractive to you.
[1:24:59] You're just going to clash.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; It try and avoid it. You won't avoid it.
[1:25:05] You're going to It's just these two
[1:25:07] opposites are just going to clash and
[1:25:09] clash and clash. That's why you're going
[1:25:10] to have you're going to have no end of
[1:25:12] trouble from the enemy.
[1:25:14] Does that make sense?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Right. you're going to have no end of
[1:25:17] trouble because that's the way this
[1:25:19] thing's got to work. If you're if you're
[1:25:20] this and he's that,
[1:25:23] no matter where you go, no matter what
[1:25:24] you do, you're just going to go clash
[1:25:26] clash clash clash. It's just going to
[1:25:29] happen. And and and you'll never get
[1:25:31] away from it till it's all over. But
[1:25:35] what I like about this is they never
[1:25:36] join and never they never merge and
[1:25:38] become one. They just But I don't mind
[1:25:40] that because the word of God because
[1:25:42] brother Brandham says, you know, if
[1:25:43] Satan if if he's not at you, then he's
[1:25:46] got you. You're either one side or the
[1:25:48] other.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And that's what the that's what the
[1:25:53] how would I say this? Like
[1:25:56] I lost my train of thought.
[1:26:00] I just want to leave you because it may
[1:26:01] have sounded negative, but I want to
[1:26:02] leave you with this with this thought at
[1:26:05] the end that
[1:26:07] by the end of all this eternity is just
[1:26:10] going to be pure attraction. this
[1:26:11] attraction that actually this attractive
[1:26:13] force that binds everything that we are
[1:26:16] together that that binds me to God when
[1:26:18] we get to this other place is going to
[1:26:19] be such an attraction and we minus all
[1:26:21] of the worldly attractions that we that
[1:26:23] we have here that that young fellas that
[1:26:25] they they get attracted to this all
[1:26:26] these things are trying to pull them and
[1:26:28] pull them in every which way. I'm glad
[1:26:30] that there is an attractive power of the
[1:26:32] Lord that actually will will pull us
[1:26:34] that's the strongest force that's going
[1:26:36] to that through all of this other mess
[1:26:38] that's stronger than every other
[1:26:39] attraction. Yeah,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; the the attractive power of God that
[1:26:42] this force and it's just going to it'll
[1:26:44] start pulling if you're one of God's. No
[1:26:46] matter where you go, what you do, it's
[1:26:47] just going to start pulling. It's just
[1:26:49] going to pull pull and then it's going
[1:26:51] to bind you together. And that's why
[1:26:53] I'll close with a scripture. That's why
[1:26:55] that's why Paul said,
[1:26:58] "Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:27:01] Christ?"
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because now you're talking about
[1:27:04] this this the strongest force that's
[1:27:06] bound everything together. Shall
[1:27:09] tribulation, will that break it? Uh or
[1:27:12] distress, will distress have enough
[1:27:15] power to undo this force? Or persecution
[1:27:19] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[1:27:22] sword? As it is written, for thy sake we
[1:27:24] are killed all the day long. We are
[1:27:26] accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[1:27:28] But Paul says, "Nay, in all these things
[1:27:30] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:27:32] that loved us." He says, "For I am
[1:27:34] persuaded that neither death nor life,
[1:27:38] nor angels, nor principalities, nor
[1:27:41] powers, nor things present, nor things
[1:27:44] to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
[1:27:48] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:27:50] from the love of God, which is in Christ
[1:27:51] Jesus our Lord."
[1:27:53] This attractive force that binds me with
[1:27:57] God, there's nothing that can break it.
[1:27:59] There's nothing the world can throw at
[1:28:01] me. There's nothing the enemy can throw
[1:28:02] at me. There's nothing I can go through
[1:28:03] that can ever break this attractive
[1:28:06] force
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; that I that God has with me. And that's
[1:28:10] how I think, Lord, everything's going to
[1:28:11] be all right. It don't matter what gets
[1:28:13] thrown at me. I'm just going to
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to carry on through all this.
[1:28:16] And you are as well because I can see
[1:28:18] that in your life. Let's have the
[1:28:19] musicians. We'll just stand this morning
[1:28:21] and we'll just pray as the musicians
[1:28:23] start to play.
[1:28:29] Lord, I just want to thank you, Lord,
[1:28:30] that as I look back in my own life,
[1:28:34] Lord, and when the
[1:28:36] when, Lord, when our own ideas of what
[1:28:38] we think things should be, when when
[1:28:40] they wear off, Lord, and we begin to dig
[1:28:43] deeper into this this whole thing that,
[1:28:47] Lord, that we that's you and everything
[1:28:49] about we we start to see, Lord, that
[1:28:51] there's something greater at play here
[1:28:52] than than than us and our circumstances
[1:28:55] than than anything like that, Lord.
[1:28:56] There's this there's something greater,
[1:28:58] Lord, there's a predestination, there's
[1:29:00] a calling, there's there's an
[1:29:02] attraction, Lord, that that is greater
[1:29:04] than all this, Lord, that that
[1:29:06] regardless of
[1:29:07] height or depth or distress or famine or
[1:29:10] regardless of what might happen, Lord,
[1:29:12] there's this Lord, there's a force
[1:29:14] that's you, Lord, that's that's holding
[1:29:16] us that's that's just holding me to you,
[1:29:19] Lord. And I I just I thank you for that,
[1:29:21] Lord. And I just thank you for that
[1:29:23] seeing that in each one here, Lord.
[1:29:24] Knowing a little bit about what
[1:29:25] different ones here go through, Lord.
[1:29:29] And we we we understand that naturally
[1:29:32] sometimes it doesn't make sense, Lord.
[1:29:33] And yet there's there's even a force
[1:29:35] that overrides our overrides reason
[1:29:37] itself or or or or that overrides
[1:29:40] arguments. It overrides all of that.
[1:29:41] It's more powerful than all of that,
[1:29:42] Lord. And it it can't be broken by a an
[1:29:45] argument or it can't be broken by a
[1:29:47] situation, Lord. this this bond that we
[1:29:49] have with you. It can't be broken by any
[1:29:52] hardship, Lord, but it's a Lord, it's
[1:29:54] this eternal force, Lord, that that
[1:29:56] binds us to you. And I just thank you
[1:29:57] for that, Lord Jesus. I pray you bless
[1:29:59] each one here this morning, Lord. May
[1:30:01] you continue to um just go with us,
[1:30:03] Lord, as we we walk this journey, Lord,
[1:30:05] and we see in this end time, you said
[1:30:07] perilous times shall come. Lord, we but
[1:30:09] we thank you for placing us here, Lord.
[1:30:11] We could have been placed in in another
[1:30:12] age where it maybe wasn't so perilous.
[1:30:14] But we thank you, Lord, that we are here
[1:30:15] at this time and we can we can just
[1:30:17] serve and love you in this time, Lord.
[1:30:19] So, I just want to pray a blessing upon
[1:30:20] each one. May you just be with us this
[1:30:22] morning. I just pray in Jesus name.
[1:30:23] Amen. Amen. Jimmy,
[1:30:29] [applause]
[1:30:34] thank you Isaac for that.
[1:30:36] [clears throat] I just want to say sorry
[1:30:38] guys. I can't sing. You know me. I'm
[1:30:40] just trying to give my best for it.
[1:30:43] Okay, let's just sing. Um, I know it was
