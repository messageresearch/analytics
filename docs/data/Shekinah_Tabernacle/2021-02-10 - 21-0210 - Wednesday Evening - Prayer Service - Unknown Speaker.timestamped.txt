[1:14] [Music]
[1:26] [Music]
[1:42] [Music]
[2:20] so
[2:26] [Music]
[3:08] [Music]
[3:16] about i was talking to a young fella
[3:20] today at a work site he was
[3:22] sort of a monk looking fella and uh he
[3:25] was trying to give me some tracks and
[3:26] stuff of their religion
[3:27] and um and um after we talked a little
[3:31] bit and
[3:31] i told him i was a question and stuff
[3:33] and just before he left he said yeah
[3:35] um all the questions they seem to be
[3:36] happy if anybody everybody has a
[3:38] christian that he meets that they're
[3:40] happy so uh
[3:41] and uh i thought yeah it's a pretty good
[3:43] testimony because
[3:45] we have something to be happy about we
[3:47] we have the answer to
[3:49] all of life's questions and whatever
[3:50] that might throw at us personally so
[3:52] and uh just so you all know i'm in my
[3:55] socks okay you see that
[3:57] i didn't have time to bring my shoes so
[4:01] [Music]
[4:04] can we just bring up the first song
[4:06] delight yourself on the lord
[4:16] [Music]
[4:40] regardless
[4:43] [Music]
[4:53] [Applause]
[4:54] is
[5:02] he is
[5:11] [Music]
[5:22] myself
[5:26] [Music]
[5:36] hey
[5:42] [Music]
[6:04] is
[6:06] [Music]
[6:26] myself in here
[6:34] [Music]
[7:00] yourself
[7:02] [Music]
[7:14] everybody
[7:18] [Music]
[7:28] myself
[7:35] [Music]
[7:42] everybody
[7:48] [Music]
[7:51] [Applause]
[7:55] [Music]
[8:08] yourself in the lord
[8:14] [Music]
[8:24] yourself
[8:27] um this may seem uh like a bit of an odd
[8:30] song
[8:30] to sing um at a service but um i just
[8:33] felt to sing it
[8:34] and um i just would like us to sing it
[8:36] with a mindset of
[8:38] um whatever harvest we sow will reap
[8:41] and um whether that's just sowing in
[8:44] your own life
[8:45] sowing to righteousness you will reap
[8:47] that down the track even the
[8:48] goat may go through a winter season um
[8:52] or if you uh if you're um sowing into
[8:54] somebody else's life
[8:56] nothing might seem to happen but but
[8:58] what you sow
[8:59] you will reap and um so by the isaac
[9:02] song reap the harvest and just like to
[9:03] sing that
[9:04] i won't do it justice you probably all
[9:07] listen to the youtube version
[9:26] [Music]
[9:33] into it
[9:35] [Music]
[9:48] so
[9:50] [Music]
[10:02] all the precious
[10:14] to see all these
[10:18] [Music]
[10:29] wants to kiss his face
[10:33] as they reached up to heaven
[10:36] they raise up their arms rejoicing
[10:44] and as

[19:50] things
[19:54] [Music]
[20:02] to you
[20:08] [Music]
[20:17] i mean just as the musicians playing
[20:19] let's just um
[20:20] it's just open in prayer
[20:24] this evening lord we thank you for that
[20:27] promise that we know lord that you make
[20:29] all things beautiful in your time
[20:32] that sometimes it's not quite our time
[20:35] lord but
[20:37] we've learned lord that you are almighty
[20:40] god lord and that you're in control of
[20:41] every situation
[20:43] lord and that we are confident in your
[20:45] time
[20:47] lord maybe we'll never see your time on
[20:48] this earth lord maybe things
[20:50] may happen after we're gone lord but
[20:55] we're confident that you have a perfect
[20:56] plan and a perfect time for everything
[20:57] lord jesus so we just thank you for that
[20:59] lord and we rest assured lord that you
[21:03] you know the plans that you have for us
[21:05] lord plans to prosper us
[21:08] plans to bless us lord and to do us no
[21:10] harm so we just thank you that we can
[21:12] trust in your lord we just pray you'll
[21:13] continue to bless the service
[21:15] this evening and we just thank you for
[21:17] your presence amongst us lord in jesus
[21:18] name
[21:19] amen amen thank you
[21:23] musicians thank you brother marion
[21:34] apparently i've just been repromoted to
[21:36] the job of running all the music
[21:40] [Applause]
[21:47] you know the bible says cast your bread
[21:48] upon the waters and it will turn after
[21:50] many days
[21:51] i i tried to cast this one on the waters
[21:53] and it returned back
[21:54] [Laughter]
[21:57] um the reason why i say that is because
[21:59] i then would allocate who song leads
[22:02] [Laughter]
[22:06] and i'm adding you to the list you've
[22:09] got the job
[22:12] i liked what you said about the monks
[22:15] well what they said about the christians
[22:17] you know that that
[22:20] we've already found the pearl of great
[22:21] price you know we're not they they say
[22:22] would you like to have peace
[22:24] i've already got it um
[22:28] praise the lord so so tonight what we
[22:30] are going to do we've got one of these
[22:31] sort of old-fashioned
[22:32] prayer meetings um so i've got just only
[22:35] a small
[22:36] thought that i want to share this
[22:38] evening and then then i want to just
[22:39] have a little
[22:40] chance for the different ones if you've
[22:41] got a testimony in your heart you would
[22:42] like to share
[22:43] because um sometimes you know we we see
[22:46] each other
[22:47] in in church format but we don't really
[22:48] get a chance to sometimes sit down and
[22:51] just find out what someone's going
[22:52] through a little testimony or something
[22:53] you know so
[22:55] sometimes i feel like these this sort of
[22:56] format of a meeting we get a chance to
[22:58] hear something from the different
[22:58] brethren and just have that
[23:00] and then any prayer requests you have
[23:02] you can after that just
[23:03] you you can um speak those and then and
[23:07] then but we are going to do the
[23:08] modern way and all pray together once we
[23:11] um go to prayer
[23:12] and i'm going to switch my mic off when
[23:14] that happens so that i'm not just
[23:16] echoing through the sound system
[23:18] [Laughter]
[23:20] um yeah so that so so if you've got a
[23:23] testimonial or something or a prayer
[23:24] request then that's we're going to have
[23:25] a little time after that
[23:26] so i'm only going to be really short
[23:28] tonight because
[23:30] i've got to keep to the format that i've
[23:32] set for myself
[23:33] so i'm going to be about 10 or 15
[23:35] minutes let's um stand i've got
[23:38] um
[23:41] a few scriptures i want to read and then
[23:42] we can sit back down
[23:47] my first scripture is hebrews 5 verses
[23:49] 11 to 14.
[23:50] sorry children i don't have any slides
[23:52] today
[23:54] i know you're all sitting there to watch
[23:55] the screenie
[23:59] hebrews 5 11 to 14 says of whom we have
[24:02] many things to say and yet
[24:03] and hard to be uttered seeing you dull
[24:05] of hearing for when the time came you
[24:06] ought to be teachers you have need that
[24:08] one teach you again
[24:09] which be the first principles of the the
[24:12] oracles of god
[24:13] and i become such as have need of milk
[24:15] and not of strong meat
[24:17] for everyone that uses milk is
[24:18] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[24:20] for here as a babe
[24:21] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[24:22] of full age even those who by reason of
[24:25] use have their senses exercised to
[24:27] discern both
[24:27] good and evil i
[24:31] also want to read from second peter
[24:32] verse chapter 3 verses 14 to
[24:35] 16.
[24:45] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[24:47] for such things be diligent that you may
[24:49] be found of him
[24:50] in peace without spot and blameless and
[24:52] account that the long suffering of the
[24:54] lord is salvation even as our beloved
[24:56] brother paul
[24:58] also according to the wisdom giveth
[25:01] given unto him hath written unto you
[25:04] as also in all his epistles speaking in
[25:06] them
[25:07] of these things and which are some
[25:09] things hard to be understood
[25:12] which they that are unlearned and
[25:13] unstable rest or wrestle
[25:16] as they do also the other scriptures
[25:17] unto their own destruction
[25:20] may the lord blesses where you can have
[25:21] your seats um this evening
[25:24] so although it may look like i've got a
[25:25] few notes here i don't really have many
[25:27] notes
[25:28] i'm more just going to speak and
[25:30] probably not really follow these because
[25:31] i don't really have a
[25:34] streamlined thought as such that i kind
[25:36] of usually do because it didn't really
[25:37] happen that way
[25:38] so i've just got a scattering of
[25:40] thoughts
[25:44] this evening but the two scriptures that
[25:47] we read uh
[25:50] they talk about they talk about someone
[25:52] that doesn't quite you know someone that
[25:54] eats
[25:56] that's not quite where they should be or
[25:57] just not quite things aren't quite
[25:59] working out for them
[26:01] but let me start off with a little story
[26:02] and then i'll we'll move on from there
[26:06] i didn't know it but i've always had
[26:07] this funny little tongue tie thing that
[26:08] was annoying to me
[26:10] that shannon used to make fun of me
[26:12] because i couldn't really poke my tongue
[26:14] out you know
[26:15] like if i it just wouldn't really work
[26:17] and it was kind of
[26:19] i didn't really care about it but i went
[26:22] to the dentist
[26:24] a little while ago to get some work done
[26:26] on my teeth my annual checkup
[26:28] there was nothing wrong just cleaned
[26:30] them then when i was there
[26:33] i said to my dentist
[26:36] i've heard that you cut these tongue
[26:38] ties he said yeah i do
[26:40] cut tongue ties you know we do that i
[26:42] said i i have a bit of a tongue tie
[26:44] there
[26:45] he's and he looked at he said no you
[26:47] kind of do it's not real bad but you do
[26:48] have one
[26:50] i said oh can you just cut it out then
[26:54] and he said yeah we can do that like
[26:56] let's look around for next week
[26:58] i said okay let's do it bad move
[27:06] i was slightly worried on the day
[27:08] because that night i had to
[27:11] i was meeting all these actors and
[27:13] soundies out at our place to um
[27:16] re-record some of the parts in this
[27:17] little thing i'm making you know when
[27:20] you go to the dentist they inject all
[27:21] the stuff into your mouth and you it's
[27:22] like you're like
[27:24] for the rest of the day i thought man
[27:26] the appointment was in the morning and i
[27:27] thought hopefully by the end of the day
[27:29] my mouth is back to normal otherwise i'm
[27:30] going to be like
[27:32] trying to talk to these guys and i'm
[27:33] trying to run this operation you know
[27:35] this has been planned for a long time
[27:37] but it kind of all worked i went there
[27:39] and he injected all the
[27:41] anus the local anesthetic and cut this
[27:44] thing out showed me what he did
[27:46] and it was all kind of going well and
[27:47] then he gave me this stuff to rinse my
[27:49] mouth
[27:49] every once in a while to supposedly make
[27:51] the pain go away but it was really
[27:52] painful
[27:54] so painful it was so painful like
[27:58] but i didn't know how painful it was
[27:59] because the anesthetic was still there
[28:02] and then the day went on and i was
[28:06] like yeah feeling this is kind of
[28:07] getting a bit painful and i was drinking
[28:09] this stuff every two hours to
[28:11] supposedly it makes the tongue go a bit
[28:12] numb
[28:14] and i didn't eat any food that day
[28:16] because i kind of wasn't planning on
[28:17] eating food anyway but i didn't not eat
[28:18] food because of that i just thought
[28:19] i just need food today you know i
[28:22] usually
[28:23] i don't sometimes on fridays i don't but
[28:25] i thought i'd transfer it to thursday
[28:26] because i can
[28:27] and then we did all the stuff and the
[28:29] actors came that night and i could
[28:30] actually talk and everything and then
[28:31] come about nine o'clock 9 30 i was so
[28:34] hungry i was like man i'm really hungry
[28:35] i just want to eat some food
[28:37] shannon had gone into town and she'd got
[28:38] my favorite fast food which was
[28:40] turkish um uh
[28:43] eskender mixed skinned with salad no
[28:45] rice just salad on
[28:47] so good and she laid this fast food
[28:50] on the table and i was like man i'm so
[28:52] hungry i'm going to devour this fast
[28:53] food
[28:54] this turkish i put what i stuck i put a
[28:57] mouthful in my mouth
[28:58] that spoonful in my mouth and started
[29:00] what
[29:02] i'd had chili in it yeah yeah chili
[29:04] chili sauce
[29:05] and i tried to bite the stuff and it was
[29:07] so painful
[29:08] but i loved that this food i was like
[29:10] i've just got to eat this
[29:12] and i took another bite and i'm trying
[29:14] to chew this and when you can't move
[29:15] your tongue you don't realize how much
[29:16] work your tongue does when you're eating
[29:17] food
[29:18] do you realize it like it pushes the
[29:19] food around it pushes it under your
[29:21] teeth
[29:22] and you chew that and then if you've got
[29:23] other bits it moves it
[29:26] it's like they say you don't know what
[29:27] you've got till it's gone
[29:29] man i'll tell you when it was gone i
[29:30] just and i couldn't push the food to one
[29:32] side so i'd have to
[29:34] shake it and every time you chew
[29:37] it was so painful but i love this food
[29:40] so much i took about
[29:42] after about four mouthfuls i think i was
[29:45] fainting almost in pain because i was
[29:46] thinking this is so painful i was
[29:47] getting sick like
[29:48] and i just said to shannon i can't eat
[29:50] any more of this food i'm done man i
[29:52] just can't eat it but i'm so hungry
[29:54] it was such a disappointing experience
[29:56] you couldn't eat the food you know like
[29:57] that's
[29:59] it was so good i couldn't eat it so then
[30:03] i was like man i've got to eat something
[30:04] i'm hungry so we had to go into town and
[30:06] we
[30:07] looked around there was a curry place
[30:08] open and we got the softest curry we
[30:11] could find which was some sort of weird
[30:12] fish
[30:13] curry or something laska with a bit of
[30:15] fish in it
[30:16] so basically soup so i could just drink
[30:19] the soup and even you don't realize with
[30:20] your tongue too that stops all the food
[30:22] from falling out of your mouth too
[30:23] you realize that you put it in your
[30:25] mouth and the tongue sort of
[30:28] slurps up and because i've got food i'm
[30:30] trying to eat this food and it's just
[30:31] dripping down my
[30:32] it's all over my shirt and i'm
[30:34] explaining to the lady look i've got
[30:35] this funny tongue i can't eat much and
[30:36] you
[30:37] you've got to pour it in and eating food
[30:40] was such a
[30:41] boring experience because it took so
[30:43] long to eat a bowl of soup
[30:44] you know and then i had to live on soup
[30:47] and
[30:48] smoothies for like three days you know
[30:50] how awful that is
[30:52] like i don't mind eating not much food
[30:53] but i got so tired of having
[30:56] soft food in my stomach just soup and i
[30:59] thought man
[30:59] i can't wait till i can eat something a
[31:01] bit more solid some decent food because
[31:03] i was starting to feel weak like when
[31:05] this stuff's not sustaining me
[31:07] i'm feeling weak it's not working for me
[31:09] this
[31:10] soft food you know that that got me to
[31:14] thinking about
[31:15] about when the bible talks about you
[31:18] know like
[31:20] milk where there's a that milk is for
[31:23] babes and
[31:24] you need strong meat you need something
[31:26] to sustain you
[31:28] we can't now we're talking spiritually
[31:30] now we can't live off soft
[31:32] things we actually need something we
[31:34] need meat we need
[31:36] we need meat to sustain us and we need
[31:38] the
[31:39] the deeper things of god and things like
[31:41] that to actually sustain us spiritually
[31:44] we you try living off smoothies in like
[31:47] soup it just doesn't quite work you know
[31:50] and then
[31:52] milk and that sort of stuff and and you
[31:55] know as christians
[31:58] we are
[32:03] seven more minutes to go as christians
[32:09] we need to have we need to be sustained
[32:12] by this
[32:13] by by the the deeper things of god
[32:16] and the more i thought about this i
[32:19] thought you know
[32:21] sometimes we think we think the deeper
[32:23] things of god are like
[32:24] things that i understand when i get more
[32:26] i understand more mysteries which in a
[32:28] sense they are
[32:30] but sometimes they are actually harder
[32:34] things
[32:34] that we understand that we have to go
[32:36] through the word of god tells us and we
[32:38] think yes lord i'll
[32:39] i'll go through that it's not always
[32:41] just like oh
[32:42] now i understand that this symbol means
[32:44] that and this one means that and this
[32:46] one is there and there
[32:47] it's actually equipping us with things
[32:50] we need in order to carry on
[32:52] to keep going because i don't want to
[32:55] make it sound bad but
[32:57] the christian walk is very hard we're in
[33:00] a
[33:00] raging battle and
[33:04] we have a we have a ruthless enemy that
[33:06] is out to destroy us
[33:08] and he has and i've seen it more and
[33:11] more lately
[33:12] and young guys i've seen it now with
[33:14] young people it's it's a
[33:15] it's been an eye-opener that we satan is
[33:18] a ruthless
[33:19] enemy well with the
[33:22] with war we have what they call the
[33:24] geneva conference so there are rules
[33:26] even in when
[33:27] countries fight countries they now have
[33:30] although it seems like it's just as
[33:32] disorganized
[33:33] chaos where everyone fights each other
[33:34] there are rules to war
[33:36] you fight and then if people break the
[33:37] rules after the war they say hey you
[33:39] broke this rule you broke that rule and
[33:40] they
[33:41] they they get done for war crimes they
[33:44] they're punished you know but so even in
[33:47] our even
[33:48] humans we have what was that was that a
[33:51] phone call
[33:53] oh reminder for me to finish
[33:56] no there are rules to rules of rules of
[33:59] war
[34:01] even in the so we you can't just if
[34:04] someone surrenders
[34:05] you're not allowed to shoot that person
[34:06] things like that there are there are
[34:07] rules to keep
[34:08] even war civil you know but i want to
[34:12] say
[34:12] this satan doesn't play by any rules
[34:15] whatsoever
[34:17] he's a he's a ruthless enemy the bible
[34:18] says about him that he goes about like a
[34:20] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[34:22] he and and he stops at no there's
[34:24] nothing that
[34:25] he won't that he thinks i better not do
[34:28] it that way
[34:28] like he'll he'll start lying to these
[34:30] little guys here
[34:32] he'll lie to little guys to destroy
[34:33] their life to make them hate their
[34:34] parents
[34:35] to make them go off there these are just
[34:37] little people that are barely even
[34:38] learning how to do anything and he will
[34:39] ruthlessly put
[34:41] evil thoughts in their mind to make them
[34:42] start to hate what's right and hate good
[34:44] and that
[34:45] he when their minds aren't even really
[34:48] right enough to even process it he's
[34:49] firing it in there
[34:50] that that's the sort of ruthless enemy
[34:52] that we serve
[34:53] and the reality is because we serve an
[34:56] enemy like that
[34:57] we can't be babies in this walk
[35:00] we can't be soft people we can't
[35:03] we can't just be like we can walking
[35:05] around
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] now god doesn't make life hard for us
[35:09] but because we live in a world where we
[35:11] have a
[35:11] ruthless enemy we have got to actually
[35:14] be
[35:15] tough we have got to be there is no
[35:18] other way we will actually
[35:20] survive unless we have unless we
[35:22] understand a bit about how things work
[35:24] and
[35:24] that it's going to be rough it's going
[35:25] to be tough you know these are sometimes
[35:27] i think these are more the media things
[35:28] of the word like hey
[35:29] prepare yourself you're going to have
[35:31] major disappointments you're not going
[35:32] to know what's going on and you're going
[35:33] to have to press on
[35:35] you're going to pray and ask the lord
[35:36] for things and it ain't going to happen
[35:37] it's going to go the opposite way and
[35:38] you're going to wonder what's going on
[35:39] you've got to press on
[35:40] and satan's going to be there to throw
[35:42] all sorts of stuff at you and tell you
[35:43] this and then lie to you and
[35:45] throw you off the track you've got to be
[35:47] making sure you're you're eating the
[35:48] right meat and have the right
[35:50] understanding to think i don't care what
[35:51] it looks like it's all going to be all
[35:52] right everything's going to work out
[35:54] i don't care if i can look back and see
[35:55] all my faults have brought me here and
[35:56] it's a big mess up
[35:58] it doesn't matter the lord's in control
[36:00] thank you
[36:01] you understand we we have to understand
[36:03] this is how it works if we don't
[36:05] understand that way then we're going to
[36:07] start complaining
[36:08] we're going to start we're just like
[36:09] weak babies you know we complain and
[36:11] it's
[36:14] i'll tell you a little another little
[36:15] story you want to hear a little story
[36:18] so there's a new craze went through the
[36:21] church real bad one
[36:22] you know what it was people started
[36:23] buying little dogs
[36:27] these little fluffy dogs i think sister
[36:29] case started
[36:31] then everyone followed her and started
[36:33] getting little fluffy dogs you know
[36:35] before you know it i think were you
[36:37] first
[36:39] jenny got a little fluffy dog and then
[36:42] the cliffords had to follow
[36:43] they got these fluffy dogs
[36:47] i don't like fluffy little dogs
[36:51] you don't know why i don't like these
[36:52] little fluffy dogs because they remind
[36:54] you just something that's soft
[36:56] and all like like a you know
[36:59] i don't like if you'll get to know me i
[37:01] don't like things that are soft and
[37:03] and
[37:04] soft attitudes others don't like it so
[37:06] when i see these little dogs these
[37:07] little soft little things you know
[37:09] i think i look at these silly little
[37:10] dogs you know give me a real dog that's
[37:13] like cuffed these little dogs are
[37:14] wimpy little things you know not all of
[37:17] them okay
[37:19] now i'm not saying they are this is just
[37:20] my perception i'm probably wrong right
[37:22] but
[37:22] these things seem like they and they sit
[37:24] around and sleep and they get carried
[37:26] around these little handbags by people
[37:27] and you know
[37:28] hey sister kale never talked to me again
[37:34] now and do you know what happened after
[37:36] that
[37:37] we got a little dog could you believe we
[37:40] ended up with a little dog i couldn't
[37:42] believe it i'm like man this is like
[37:45] this is all gone we're this is we're in
[37:47] the gutter now
[37:50] we're done it's all over
[37:53] but we didn't get a little fluffy dog no
[37:56] no no we got this little thing called a
[38:00] fox terrier at first i thought
[38:04] i had this stolen this thought in my
[38:05] mind i don't like these little dogs you
[38:07] know
[38:07] silly little dogs little soft little
[38:09] things
[38:10] but this little dog over the weeks and
[38:12] months i watched this little dog and i
[38:14] thought
[38:14] it grew on me i'm like there's something
[38:16] about that little dog that i like
[38:18] that walks around like it's all tough
[38:20] look going around and it's like
[38:22] and then as it's grown a bit it starts
[38:24] like it's now protecting the house you
[38:26] know
[38:26] that's the first protector of our
[38:28] property now if a car comes near it
[38:30] that's going to attack the car right
[38:32] there's a car here and it
[38:34] really genuinely is going to attack that
[38:36] car like right car you could not come
[38:38] closer
[38:39] beware and it walks around like it's
[38:42] this the most powerful little
[38:43] thing in the world you know
[38:46] and i thought what is it about that
[38:48] little dog that i really i'm starting to
[38:50] admire
[38:51] about this little dog what is it
[38:54] and i kind of clicked i realized the
[38:56] thing that i like about that little dog
[38:59] is that it thinks it's a lot better than
[39:00] what it actually is
[39:02] to the rest of us it looks like a silly
[39:04] little dog but not to that little dog
[39:05] that's this powerful awesome thing
[39:07] that's that can do all things you know
[39:10] and it's and i've got so much respect
[39:13] for that little dog because i think you
[39:14] know
[39:14] i respect things people like that
[39:16] someone that it might look like they're
[39:17] not much but if their attitude is you
[39:18] know i can do all things
[39:20] i kind of like that i don't like a soft
[39:21] attitude and i look at this little dog
[39:23] thing
[39:23] okay then you are what you think you are
[39:25] it's you are a tough little dog
[39:27] even though most of the ventures it goes
[39:29] to try and do it cannot achieve
[39:31] it tries to ward people off it can't but
[39:33] it doesn't
[39:34] think that it just thinks i can i can do
[39:36] it
[39:37] and i think that's what we have to be as
[39:39] christians you know it's we have to be
[39:40] actually tough and like we've got to
[39:42] have that
[39:42] we can't be like these little soft
[39:44] fluffy dogs that are we've got to have
[39:46] backbone to us you know and be
[39:47] and be be tough be strong you know
[39:50] that's
[39:51] i know it sounds harsh but sometimes the
[39:53] thing to say to people is
[39:55] you actually need to toughen up now
[39:59] i'll give you an example like with a
[40:00] little child you know a little child
[40:01] falls over they do things and you you
[40:03] won't say toughen up but you'll say hey
[40:04] little buddy you'll be right you know
[40:06] they cry you say it's all right you know
[40:08] but as it go off a bit
[40:09] when they get a little bit bigger and
[40:10] they cry because they get a sore knee
[40:12] you know
[40:13] break their knee and they start crying
[40:15] you don't say oh
[40:16] sorry you know sorry buddy
[40:19] you say actually hey hey you're a bit
[40:22] bigger now bro well
[40:24] you need to stop crying like you can't
[40:27] just cry every time you get hurt
[40:29] you otherwise you're going to go through
[40:31] life when things are hard on you you're
[40:32] going to cry you've got to learn that
[40:34] hey
[40:34] even if you're hurt you stop crying
[40:37] now it sounds harsh you think oh i
[40:39] should really comfort them
[40:42] but that's not really what you should do
[40:45] and look and the lord actually does it
[40:46] with us he doesn't
[40:47] you notice he's not soft some of the
[40:50] the a man said lord my father's died let
[40:54] me go and bury him
[40:56] he said let the dead bury the dead come
[40:57] follow me
[41:01] but that's my father you know we were
[41:03] boss and buddies
[41:04] oh we'll stay then see you you know it's
[41:07] hard he said
[41:08] he warned he warned the disciples of
[41:10] what's going to come up because he said
[41:11] they're going to persecute they'll throw
[41:13] you in prison they'll do these things
[41:14] i've warned you so you won't be offended
[41:16] so you'll actually be able to handle it
[41:17] when it happens
[41:18] oh that's what he told us about this
[41:19] we're ready to
[41:21] to take it on you know he doesn't make
[41:24] us soft
[41:25] he actually doesn't want us to be soft
[41:27] he doesn't want us to
[41:28] and the first bit of resistance we get
[41:30] the trouble in the fellowship we get
[41:32] you know we've got to be tough we've got
[41:34] to actually
[41:35] we've got to have a tough attitude
[41:38] and we've got to not complain you can't
[41:41] complain you know like
[41:44] paul when he after a while you'd think
[41:46] if he went preached got beaten up and
[41:48] nothing went his way and then he ended
[41:49] up in prison he had every right to
[41:51] complain
[41:53] but you imagine if you didn't know what
[41:54] was happening to him and we had cell
[41:56] phone he had cell phones in that time
[41:57] and then
[41:58] you thought oh out of the blue he was in
[42:00] another country i got brother paula
[42:01] ringing
[42:02] and you rang him up and he and you could
[42:05] hear
[42:06] singing in the background you're like oh
[42:07] hey brother so just catching up how are
[42:09] you doing
[42:10] and you can hear someone singing on the
[42:12] other end of the line not him but
[42:13] someone else he's like oh yeah we're
[42:14] just singing some songs in that
[42:15] having a good time you'd think oh he
[42:18] must be with the brothers at the church
[42:19] you know they're having a
[42:20] prayer meeting awesome where are you i
[42:22] said i'm in prison
[42:23] just finished being beaten up that's
[42:25] where we are
[42:29] you didn't hear him complaining well how
[42:32] often do we we get a bit of hardship in
[42:33] our life we say why lord why is this
[42:35] happening to me
[42:36] it's such a soft attitude don't say that
[42:39] don't say that you can say it if you
[42:41] want to but i'm telling you it's not the
[42:43] right response to the situation
[42:45] so the sooner you take that out of your
[42:47] vocabulary the better off you'll be
[42:49] because if you
[42:50] have that attitude you'll it'll be hard
[42:52] for you to find the victory in the
[42:53] situation
[42:54] now this might seem hard but that's the
[42:56] reality of the way that it works
[42:59] the the to be a mature strong christian
[43:01] you've got to
[43:02] put away that crying and stuff and you
[43:05] know
[43:05] why is this happening to me oh no i hope
[43:07] this would happen
[43:08] we often like to share testimonies you
[43:10] know i prayed for this
[43:12] and then i got it and praise the lord
[43:13] now you can share that afterwards if
[43:15] you'd like to
[43:16] but you know why not we pray you know i
[43:19] really wanted a promotion
[43:20] and then it was all looking like i was
[43:22] going to get it these guys said yep
[43:23] you're pretty much going to get it and
[43:24] then
[43:26] and then and i was going to get this new
[43:27] position and it was all going to work
[43:28] and then so i went there and then
[43:30] i didn't get it praise the lord you know
[43:34] i'm so happy i just
[43:36] he said no you you're not going to get a
[43:37] promotion in fact we're going to cut
[43:38] your hours
[43:40] and i said awesome thanks so much that's
[43:42] great
[43:43] you know praise the lord that was my
[43:45] testimony folks i'll sit down next
[43:46] person share
[43:47] you know we think that's not much of a
[43:49] testimony but
[43:52] but what of it you know what of it
[43:55] it the bible says endure join with me in
[43:59] suffering like a good soldier of christ
[44:01] jesus or other words says
[44:02] thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[44:04] soldier of jesus christ
[44:06] hardness means when it's nothing's
[44:08] working for you still just praise the
[44:09] lord you just
[44:10] you're happy you're moving on therefore
[44:13] my dear brothers and sisters stand firm
[44:16] let nothing move you
[44:17] this is a different version always give
[44:20] yourselves
[44:20] fully to the work of the lord because
[44:22] you know that your labor and the law
[44:23] does not in vain gonna share one last
[44:36] little bit and then we're gonna i'm
[44:37] gonna stop because
[44:38] my time is up
[44:42] i'm just gonna get the scripture this is
[44:44] slightly on the same thought but um
[44:46] i don't know why i want to share this
[44:47] but this thought has always intrigued me
[44:51] and it's this will be a little food for
[44:53] thought to think about
[44:56] ecclesiastes 1 17 and 18 says and i gave
[44:59] my heart to no wisdom and to no madness
[45:01] and folly
[45:02] i perceived that this also is vexation
[45:04] of spirit
[45:05] foreign much wisdom is much grief and he
[45:08] that increaseth
[45:09] knowledge increaseth sorrow
[45:12] in other words he's saying the more that
[45:14] you start to understand the more
[45:16] sorrow and the more down you're going to
[45:18] get because you're just going to start
[45:19] to notice things
[45:21] and it's going to start looking more and
[45:23] more like
[45:25] it's going to start to affect you and
[45:26] it's going to bring you down
[45:29] and you know we say lord fill me with
[45:31] all wisdom and lord may i grow in wisdom
[45:34] the reality is as you grow in wisdom
[45:37] the the you're going to go this other
[45:39] way you know
[45:41] that's the reality that's what it's like
[45:44] if you didn't care about foolishness
[45:46] foolishness wouldn't affect you if you
[45:47] see foolish things you'd say this is
[45:49] great
[45:50] but when you perceive it as follow you
[45:51] think i've got to sit this in my mind
[45:54] and i've got to look at this and
[45:55] understand this
[45:56] and i think it's silly you see you start
[45:58] to see things but
[45:59] so so what's the solution as you
[46:01] understand the lord more
[46:02] it brings you down more you just got to
[46:04] get stronger and you know you
[46:07] life becomes harder as you go on trials
[46:09] become longer people think wow
[46:11] one day this you know i'll be glad when
[46:12] i'm out of this trial there'll be
[46:13] another one harder than that on its way
[46:15] never you mind that's the way that this
[46:18] is
[46:19] but to to just to close it off on
[46:23] something a bit more
[46:26] positive
[46:29] so that it doesn't sound like all
[46:31] drudgery it's only drudgery
[46:33] because we have a raging enemy but the
[46:35] lord hasn't made it drudgery for us on
[46:37] purpose
[46:38] like oh i'm going to create this earth
[46:39] and then put these guys here and just
[46:40] make it miserable for them
[46:42] he his heaven is not going to have
[46:44] trials his place doesn't have trials
[46:46] he is only doing this here because he
[46:49] knows i have to make you like this to
[46:50] overcome that enemy
[46:52] because he's ruthless i've got to train
[46:53] you this way it's not too i'm going to
[46:54] give
[46:55] make your life hard just just because i
[46:57] get enjoyment out of
[46:58] seeing your life miserable it's not like
[47:00] that but he said
[47:02] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[47:05] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[47:07] light
[47:09] that's actually what he says and you
[47:11] know why that is it's because
[47:12] his intention for us is good his yoke
[47:15] will never break us it'll never
[47:17] it will never it will never crush us
[47:20] down to where
[47:21] we no longer can be satan's yoke
[47:24] breaks people to eternally finish them
[47:28] that's that's the end of his yoke is to
[47:30] eternally finish somebody
[47:34] the lord's yoke is to make us eternal so
[47:37] his yoke will never
[47:38] that's why he says it's easy oh you
[47:39] might have hardships and things his yoke
[47:41] is very easy
[47:42] his burden is light and
[47:46] i'm going to close on this that as much
[47:48] as i say i don't complain you no one
[47:50] really hears me complain much
[47:51] to you guys but i do i don't complain to
[47:55] the lord but
[47:56] the bible says cast all your cares upon
[47:58] me on him for he cares for you
[48:00] and i've found that when i get in a
[48:02] situation
[48:03] i can just go before the lord and say
[48:05] lord i'm just finding this very very
[48:07] hard
[48:08] and i can just i can cast my cares upon
[48:11] the lord
[48:12] and somehow something happens the peace
[48:16] that passes all understanding and
[48:18] something changes and somehow it just
[48:20] becomes easy i don't i don't i can't
[48:22] explain
[48:22] what happens but suddenly it becomes
[48:25] easy and
[48:27] and you understand you you you receive
[48:29] the care of the lord you you understand
[48:31] what it is
[48:32] so i pour out my complaints to the lord
[48:34] say lord
[48:35] and sometimes when i'm in the hard
[48:37] situation i just say lord i just don't
[48:39] know what to say here and i just
[48:41] i just say lord i'm in i'm hurting i'm
[48:43] hurting here
[48:45] that's a that's all i have to say in the
[48:47] situation i'm hurting
[48:49] but you know he's the great comforter
[48:50] and he comforts you know
[48:52] you go and try and tell satan you're
[48:53] hurting and see if you get comfort
[48:56] you you'll you'll get more and more
[48:57] depressed he'll lead you down this road
[48:59] of chaos but
[49:00] you go into the lord and say lord i'm
[49:01] hurting he's a comforter
[49:04] and that's where the christians get all
[49:06] their strength from they that wait upon
[49:07] the lord shall renew their strength
[49:09] that's where we get all of our strength
[49:10] from that's why the monk realizes these
[49:13] people are happy
[49:14] you know because we get all of our
[49:15] strength from the lord and and
[49:18] and that's actually the thing that makes
[49:20] us tough
[49:21] the spirit of god is unbreakable never
[49:24] will break it never will fold it never
[49:26] will
[49:26] back down it's it's just powerful you
[49:29] know and that's the sort of god we serve
[49:31] so
[49:32] i'm gonna close now and i'm gonna um if
[49:35] you have a little testimony
[49:36] or anything you'd like to share you can
[49:38] share good things
[49:40] and then um if you have any free
[49:42] requests i i am
[49:44] i have one um
[49:47] i know i'll chew that in the
[49:51] pre-request time
[50:10] is
[50:32] it's funny not funny it's not a
[50:35] coincidence if you pray about something
[50:37] and if
[50:37] everything happens today so now we never
[50:40] pray for our neighbors
[50:41] we never ever since we moved into
[50:44] ricky rang we never prayed for our
[50:46] neighbors i mean my wife
[50:48] would know this morning we woke up and
[50:50] we're always just praying and we prayed
[50:52] for our neighborhood and we prayed for
[50:55] protection and and specifically we said
[50:58] lord and also the people there
[51:00] which is doing the wood works and all
[51:02] those things just protect them
[51:03] and that was the guy that fell down the
[51:05] cliff now never before have we prayed
[51:08] for that
[51:09] and then when we saw the helicopter
[51:10] because the the respect helicopter came
[51:12] in and it was hovering there and we
[51:14] could see
[51:15] there was something going on and i said
[51:17] to chantal because we didn't i don't
[51:18] think it
[51:19] was strange it looks like it's at the
[51:21] woodwork place
[51:23] and yeah that's that's where the
[51:24] accident happened so
[51:26] there's a reason that a christian would
[51:28] pray no you don't even know why you're
[51:30] praying
[51:31] god knows that he's already making an
[51:33] intercession for that situation through
[51:35] you
[51:36] and so we're not as weak as you think
[51:39] you are
[51:40] even just by praying in sincerity for
[51:43] someone
[51:44] the lord can answer that prayer so yeah
[51:47] it made me very humble again and think
[51:48] about what
[51:49] power and it matches so beautifully with
[51:51] dove tells what you say what power a
[51:53] christian really has
[51:54] that we're not aware of and has that
[51:57] spoken word being returned right
[52:00] so yeah true testimony and i see prayer
[52:02] and are totally different
[52:04] so when that brother that's got that
[52:07] high blood pressure
[52:08] the pre-request came through you
[52:10] actually then said lord this is my duty
[52:12] you know as a christian i need to jump
[52:13] in here i need to pray now because it
[52:15] works you know because it worked for him
[52:18] so it works so and and then you take
[52:20] that pretty more sincere
[52:23] yeah even with just decay with your
[52:26] husband
[52:27] you see a prayer request come through
[52:28] and then you you feel duty bound you
[52:30] know you feel like that little
[52:32] dog you know i have to go and i have to
[52:33] now go give everything i have because
[52:35] somebody has to hear this the lord has
[52:37] to hear this so you can intervene
[52:39] so yeah make me think about it
[52:58] um
[53:10] a week
[53:26] just
[53:31] but i think everyone can hear me right
[53:37] lovely thank you brother
[53:40] um it's kind of a an interesting
[53:44] thing i was listening to last night and
[53:45] just followed on you know sometimes
[53:47] you're listening to the message and then
[53:48] the testimony comes
[53:49] or something strikes you and you think
[53:51] that's interesting
[53:52] and so it just made me think of it today
[53:54] with what isaac's saying it's a
[53:56] um a family had called brother brennan
[53:58] to come and pray for their
[54:00] daughter and i think she'd either died
[54:02] or she was near death on the bed
[54:04] and um and brother brennam came in and
[54:06] he was there for a little bit and then
[54:08] he says
[54:09] um because there was some unbelieving
[54:11] family around and he said that they were
[54:13] just
[54:13] crying and crying and he said um all the
[54:16] people need to stop crying because when
[54:18] you cry it weakens you
[54:19] it weakens the face in the room i was
[54:21] like wow
[54:23] just something that struck me and i
[54:25] thought you know sometimes we can be
[54:26] overwhelmed with emotions and it can
[54:27] take us away from the path that the
[54:29] lord's got for it
[54:30] and so i think either the people left
[54:31] the room and then the lord's able to
[54:33] deal
[54:34] and i was like wow lord help us but um
[54:38] i was having a little chat with a small
[54:40] person today and i was just
[54:42] it got me thinking about a few things in
[54:44] life and how
[54:45] um in
[54:48] the denominations that i've been in my
[54:50] walk with the lord that's always been
[54:52] in the past before i heard about the
[54:54] message i was just
[54:55] it got me thinking about how much it was
[54:56] so much works based
[54:58] and have i been good enough have i done
[55:01] enough have i
[55:02] and it's sort of subconscious because
[55:03] you know you can't earn your salvation
[55:05] it's a gift but it was always this
[55:07] have i read enough have i prayed enough
[55:09] have i fasted enough have i
[55:12] even just been sincere enough or
[55:14] sensitive enough to the lord or kind
[55:16] enough to people you know you always
[55:17] have a standard enough enough enough and
[55:19] you're working so hard
[55:21] towards this and it's all this pressure
[55:22] that comes on and um
[55:26] it was just interesting i the
[55:28] conversation that i had
[55:29] with a little person it was just saying
[55:32] you know what
[55:32] all of that that's not that actually
[55:35] doesn't take you to heaven that actually
[55:37] doesn't
[55:37] that doesn't that's not what's going to
[55:39] get us there on that day
[55:41] and um then the little quote come
[55:42] through from god provided a lamb and
[55:45] brother branham says
[55:46] you love him and more you love him the
[55:50] more faith will accumulate
[55:52] i was like wow and it just got me
[55:53] thinking about them
[55:55] about that really lovely song um
[55:59] falling in love with jesus
[56:02] [Music]
[56:03] falling in love with jesus
[56:08] falling in love with jesus
[56:12] it's the best thing i've ever ever done
[56:17] and it just goes on in your arms i feel
[56:19] protected and your arms never
[56:20] disconnected
[56:22] in your arms i feel protected there's no
[56:25] place i'd ever rather be
[56:27] and it just takes all the pressure off
[56:30] when you just fall in love with him and
[56:32] even listening to that song
[56:34] reap the harvest tonight like breaking
[56:36] up the the ground sometimes it can get
[56:38] hardened
[56:39] like there's areas that get hard and
[56:40] there's a hard season you know
[56:42] and just just keep up breaking up the
[56:45] ground just stay soft of the lord just
[56:47] keep your relationship close with him
[56:49] fall in love with him over and over
[56:51] again that's that's all
[56:56] i guess i'm sharing a testimony too
[57:00] that's just a small one i'm so glad that
[57:04] we have
[57:05] the lord in every situation
[57:10] whatever i am facing once that's how
[57:13] that course
[57:14] you know i put my trust in jesus amen
[57:17] he will never put me to shame amen and
[57:20] like
[57:21] so i had we had a situation
[57:24] just a it was just a conflict of
[57:26] interest
[57:27] um situation in the professional sector
[57:32] and um
[57:35] i needed direction and i just want to
[57:37] encourage
[57:38] everybody here that no matter how hard
[57:43] the whatever the challenge is in front
[57:46] of you
[57:47] if you sincerely talk to the lord about
[57:50] it
[57:52] and now this is a different type of cry
[57:54] it's a spiritual
[57:56] fervent cry of to the lord
[57:59] and and like it's like a it's like a
[58:03] your heart
[58:04] speaks and it speaks a request with
[58:07] fervency
[58:08] and i came to you and we will come to
[58:10] these points where we
[58:12] fervently need an answer
[58:15] you can't go without an answer there is
[58:18] only one thing that you can
[58:20] you you it's either answer or stop right
[58:24] and i need it and when you get to that
[58:26] point because if you're really serious
[58:27] with the lord and i was
[58:29] in this situation where um well
[58:32] i had to find out what to do with
[58:34] business
[58:35] and um and how to
[58:39] manage a situation between an employee
[58:41] and
[58:42] and um and our standards as christians
[58:45] but without being you know you don't
[58:48] want because people don't understand
[58:50] christianity if they're not christian
[58:51] right you've got to manage people
[58:54] in a way that they can understand that
[58:57] and
[58:58] so i come and i can't just go and say
[59:00] it's just this big religious thing and
[59:02] all of that with
[59:03] without baby compromising everything
[59:06] and so i had to i asked the lord i said
[59:09] lord what do you want us to do
[59:11] and you know and i really meant that and
[59:13] i was praying in my car and it was just
[59:15] like the thoughts
[59:16] just came sweeping in and it was the law
[59:18] basically said
[59:19] you if you just you know like it was
[59:22] basically
[59:23] you know with the businesses that we're
[59:24] doing there's industries
[59:26] that are fine like in promoting
[59:29] industries and
[59:30] promoting and marketing industries
[59:33] there's questionable ones and then
[59:34] there's industries that are just
[59:35] complete
[59:36] no-go zones right as a christian as a
[59:38] conflict of interest
[59:40] and i i was like well we've got guys
[59:42] that are going out looking for stuff
[59:43] that i would consider a no-go zone where
[59:46] they are trying to be good
[59:47] so in their mind they're thinking i know
[59:49] i'm working for a christian company i've
[59:50] got to be good or i'm going to try and
[59:52] behave myself and
[59:53] i'm not going to do things that are
[59:55] going to be aggravating
[59:56] my christian bosses and so you know
[59:59] their intentions are right and it's like
[1:00:00] well lord what do we do i don't want to
[1:00:02] just go and you know just pulverize
[1:00:05] somebody with
[1:00:06] my my faith which is fine you if you
[1:00:08] want to do that but
[1:00:10] for me you have to be wise in the way
[1:00:11] that you administer your
[1:00:13] you know your faith and everything and
[1:00:15] um and so i prayed to the lord i said
[1:00:17] lord what do i do
[1:00:18] and the lord gave me the thoughts
[1:00:20] straight away clear
[1:00:21] as they categorize all the industries
[1:00:25] into three industries into three
[1:00:27] sections
[1:00:28] and one first section is green second
[1:00:31] section is yellow and third section is
[1:00:33] red
[1:00:34] so it was definitive answer to a
[1:00:36] question i had no idea what to do
[1:00:38] like i was ready to just give it all up
[1:00:40] and do nothing right i'd rather do that
[1:00:42] than go and compromise and go and allow
[1:00:45] satan into my business and satan to
[1:00:47] just laugh at me and laugh at everything
[1:00:49] and just destroy
[1:00:51] and and so the lord gave me an answer
[1:00:54] and he said do that and he said
[1:00:57] now when i say he said i'm not talking
[1:00:58] about like hearing an audible voice but
[1:01:00] this was just thoughts
[1:01:02] coming and but you know it's god and he
[1:01:04] said
[1:01:05] he said give me the green you'll never
[1:01:08] need the yellow or the red and he said
[1:01:11] and he said like
[1:01:12] if you just focus on the green and that
[1:01:15] green stuff is just like
[1:01:17] industries that are fine as christians
[1:01:19] don't even you'll never need to worry
[1:01:21] you you guys won't even need to go into
[1:01:23] the yellow and questionable stuff or
[1:01:25] read just watch what i can do
[1:01:28] and so i just want to encourage you like
[1:01:30] that was for me and we will all
[1:01:32] come up against things now don't give up
[1:01:36] don't just stop and pull back pulling
[1:01:39] back is
[1:01:40] not the answer to progress as a
[1:01:43] christian
[1:01:45] dormancy is not the answer but god will
[1:01:48] give you the answer
[1:01:49] he gave me the answer and it's the
[1:01:52] wisdom of god
[1:01:54] that passes our understanding amen
[1:02:09] um i didn't really want to
[1:02:13] share this publicly but um
[1:02:16] just in regards to going back to work
[1:02:18] one of the challenges
[1:02:20] with my work situation over the last
[1:02:23] year or so has been
[1:02:25] just what i feel is the morals of the
[1:02:28] employer
[1:02:29] not being as what we would see as a
[1:02:32] christian not being very fair and
[1:02:34] haven't really felt that good about
[1:02:37] working for him
[1:02:38] but when i took the job i had a
[1:02:40] distinctive voice
[1:02:42] speak to me sort of like how andy said
[1:02:44] not an audible voice but
[1:02:45] just a definite leading that that was
[1:02:48] the job to take
[1:02:50] and so having this time off and
[1:02:53] considering these things and wondering
[1:02:54] what to do whether i should find another
[1:02:56] job or
[1:02:57] but every time i look at other jobs or
[1:03:01] start to think about it it just always
[1:03:04] come to me like the lord
[1:03:05] said i told you to take this job but i
[1:03:07] haven't told you to leave it
[1:03:09] and if he ever says to leave it then
[1:03:10] i'll leave it you know it's
[1:03:12] but i just even though i feel bad
[1:03:14] working for the guy
[1:03:16] i've never had i know the lord said to
[1:03:18] take it and i don't know why
[1:03:20] but i've never felt to leave but so i'm
[1:03:23] going to be going back
[1:03:24] for return to work program starting
[1:03:27] tomorrow for
[1:03:28] four hours a day or something and i went
[1:03:31] and had a meeting with
[1:03:32] my manager clay who had been trying to
[1:03:36] buy the business ever since we started
[1:03:38] he sort of started it but
[1:03:39] was not the owner not the funder behind
[1:03:42] it and
[1:03:43] so he's done a deal to buy the company
[1:03:45] outright off the
[1:03:46] guy that owns it which is the one with
[1:03:48] the bad morals and the one that's been
[1:03:49] difficult to work for so
[1:03:51] going forward it looks like we're no
[1:03:54] longer going to have to deal with that
[1:03:55] situation of
[1:03:56] this guy that's been the real issue the
[1:03:59] whole time so
[1:04:01] that's looks good trusting the lord
[1:04:04] until he leads otherwise
[1:04:08] um i hadn't intended on sharing this at
[1:04:10] all either but um
[1:04:12] just because brother isaac asked um and
[1:04:14] i felt the lord put on my heart like
[1:04:16] right when he asked um you might
[1:04:18] remember my mother-in-law
[1:04:20] james's mum came down at the start of
[1:04:22] december angie
[1:04:24] and so this is actually not my testimony
[1:04:26] this is her testimony of
[1:04:27] you all so technically it's all of your
[1:04:30] testimonies
[1:04:31] i just wanted to tell this and say that
[1:04:34] as from her perspective she told us this
[1:04:36] on the weekend or told me that
[1:04:38] you know each one of you really spoke to
[1:04:41] her when she was here
[1:04:43] so i just wanted to say thank you for
[1:04:45] being such a testimony to the
[1:04:46] unbelievers that come through here
[1:04:49] and she mentioned pretty much everyone
[1:04:51] almost by name
[1:04:52] just going through the children the
[1:04:54] young ones the parents the sisters the
[1:04:57] fathers
[1:04:58] everyone she just she would ask me
[1:05:00] what's this sister's name or what's this
[1:05:01] brother's name
[1:05:02] she just went through all of you and
[1:05:04] just said i really appreciated this one
[1:05:06] or that one or
[1:05:07] whatever so i just wanted to say thank
[1:05:09] you for being a testimony to
[1:05:11] out some of our unbelieving family at
[1:05:13] the moment um
[1:05:15] and that thank you and yeah
[1:05:18] praise the lord for being a testimony
[1:05:21] just add to that quickly as well
[1:05:22] um it was funny you know like when you
[1:05:25] take you go around somewhere with your
[1:05:26] kids where like you're always
[1:05:28] bragging on your own kid or your your
[1:05:31] sister's kid like your nephews or your
[1:05:32] nieces and
[1:05:33] or something like that you know but
[1:05:35] we're around at my cousin's
[1:05:37] place and um mum would always be
[1:05:39] bragging about their kid or about
[1:05:41] one of my other cousins kid or something
[1:05:43] but she brought it up with the other
[1:05:44] family around and
[1:05:46] we felt a bit there but she was just
[1:05:48] saying about how wonderful the youth
[1:05:49] here are and she's
[1:05:50] i've never never known so just such a
[1:05:53] happy healthy
[1:05:55] bunch of kids they all they're all
[1:05:56] healthy and they're all just so happy
[1:05:58] and they're just such wonderful children
[1:06:00] she just kept bragging on about
[1:06:02] the family god here almost the point we
[1:06:03] felt bad but you know so
[1:06:05] the kids are a testimony as well
[1:06:13] um i okay so
[1:06:16] about where um isaac this is what you
[1:06:20] just basically said you don't need to
[1:06:22] talk um give your testimony about you
[1:06:25] prayed for it and god gave it to you
[1:06:27] um anyways that happened um
[1:06:32] um i just want to um when um marion
[1:06:37] sang um as to sing reap the harvest that
[1:06:39] was actually really really
[1:06:42] in good timing because i was thinking
[1:06:44] about
[1:06:45] something like we've had no clinical
[1:06:48] manager for most of the time that i've
[1:06:49] been at my
[1:06:50] at my current job now and that makes it
[1:06:54] really rough on a lot of
[1:06:56] like yeah i'm not not even going to go
[1:06:59] into details
[1:07:00] um but we've recently gotten a clinical
[1:07:03] manager and that's something i've been
[1:07:04] praying about
[1:07:05] for the almost two years that i've been
[1:07:07] there and like
[1:07:09] yeah just different things and i knew
[1:07:12] that that could
[1:07:13] fix a lot of problems um so we've
[1:07:15] recently got a clinical manager who
[1:07:17] is i think she's gonna be incredible
[1:07:21] um but i was thinking about that today
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:25] i was also just thinking how i just lost
[1:07:29] my train of thought
[1:07:33] oh yeah i was thinking about how once i
[1:07:36] listened
[1:07:37] there was a minister who talked about
[1:07:39] david and how he just
[1:07:41] before he became a king or god anointed
[1:07:44] he just he'd go out to the fields and
[1:07:46] he'd
[1:07:47] he'd um go water the feet water the
[1:07:49] sheep
[1:07:50] take them into the pasture go practice
[1:07:52] my sling
[1:07:54] play a few songs on the harp next day do
[1:07:56] the same thing over again and the next
[1:07:57] day do the same thing over again and
[1:07:59] sometimes it feels like you're doing
[1:08:00] that at work it's like
[1:08:02] you just go water the sheep i mean brush
[1:08:05] the teeth and
[1:08:07] feed and water your people and do the
[1:08:10] same thing over again
[1:08:12] practice on the on the on my harp or
[1:08:14] whatever
[1:08:15] and it just feels like that's all repeat
[1:08:17] repeat so um
[1:08:19] yeah i just wanted to give god the glory
[1:08:20] for that and i think i was going to say
[1:08:22] something else too but my mind just went
[1:08:24] blank
[1:08:25] um also i would um if we could maybe
[1:08:28] just
[1:08:29] keep brother george smith and um
[1:08:32] okay so i went to israel a few years ago
[1:08:36] and
[1:08:36] on tour with brother george smith and
[1:08:41] a jewish man named rovin
[1:08:45] reuven and he passed away a few days ago
[1:08:48] and i think brother george smith was
[1:08:51] very
[1:08:52] close to him so if we could maybe just
[1:08:53] keep ruben's family
[1:08:55] and brother george smith in prayer also
[1:09:03] one more
[1:09:19] so we're driving down the road once and
[1:09:21] then
[1:09:23] um my door wasn't closed properly so
[1:09:26] then
[1:09:26] um um i opened my door to close it
[1:09:30] um to open it and close it again and
[1:09:32] we're still on the road and then
[1:09:34] two cars came past when i did it and
[1:09:37] then i was like a
[1:09:38] little child so i opened it wide and
[1:09:41] then i closed it
[1:09:42] and then um two cars um fitted in
[1:09:46] just and i don't know how that happened
[1:09:49] um and it was a miracle
[1:09:52] it was a miracle otherwise my door had
[1:09:55] been ripped off
[1:10:04] thank you um
[1:10:07] my my testimony is around
[1:10:10] um you know ever since we came here
[1:10:14] to this church the lord has done
[1:10:17] tremendous things
[1:10:19] personally in my life and
[1:10:22] but what really stands out for me as i'm
[1:10:25] sitting here
[1:10:26] you know i never i never used to preach
[1:10:29] in my life
[1:10:31] and even when i came here i never asked
[1:10:34] the pastor to
[1:10:36] i never raised my hands that i can
[1:10:38] preach
[1:10:39] so i was amazed when he asked me
[1:10:42] but but what i knew is that
[1:10:46] the lord has done something through the
[1:10:48] same ones that brother ben has preached
[1:10:50] you know
[1:10:51] to me personally and i always treasure
[1:10:54] it so much
[1:10:56] so uh
[1:10:59] my testimony is more in line with what
[1:11:02] brother isaac said you know like
[1:11:04] then i started to read the scriptures
[1:11:07] and
[1:11:08] i pray for god to help me
[1:11:11] then when i saw the enemy starting to
[1:11:13] attack
[1:11:15] um uh what what i'm doing
[1:11:19] for the children of god then i i knew
[1:11:21] that
[1:11:23] perhaps it was it was a good idea for me
[1:11:25] to to agree to read the bible
[1:11:28] so but but i knew that i'm not a
[1:11:30] minister
[1:11:32] so and then then the devil tries to
[1:11:35] attack
[1:11:36] in all france you know all different
[1:11:40] sorts of ways and
[1:11:41] and what isaac said earlier on you know
[1:11:43] just confirmed to me that you know
[1:11:46] no wonder the bible says uh counted all
[1:11:48] joy
[1:11:49] when all sorts of things happens to you
[1:11:51] you know and
[1:11:52] to be honest with you brothers and
[1:11:56] sisters we are better off
[1:11:58] with trials because they bring character
[1:12:01] and
[1:12:02] and to be honest with you we don't get
[1:12:05] too spoiled
[1:12:07] but the spirit of laodicea is the spirit
[1:12:09] of being spoiled
[1:12:11] and just getting things easy and
[1:12:14] until someone said you know easy come
[1:12:16] easy go
[1:12:18] so we we we are in a situation where
[1:12:22] we have to pray for god to to allow the
[1:12:25] devil
[1:12:26] to to bring it on because that helps us
[1:12:29] to
[1:12:30] to really be closer to god and
[1:12:33] you know bring the the time to go home
[1:12:36] even much closer
[1:12:38] so pray for me i don't claim to be any
[1:12:42] any sort of a preacher or anything but
[1:12:44] one thing that the lord confirmed to me
[1:12:46] was that
[1:12:48] even if even if the whole church cannot
[1:12:50] hear you but
[1:12:51] i'll have someone who will hear and will
[1:12:54] get
[1:12:54] will get blessed and i said lord maybe
[1:12:57] that also includes me
[1:12:59] to hear that and so i just want to thank
[1:13:02] god
[1:13:03] for all his trials and temptations and
[1:13:07] um that we must not be ceases you know
[1:13:11] we must not allow the devil to to take
[1:13:13] us for a ride because he knows that
[1:13:15] we are actually above him but he makes
[1:13:17] it as if he's above us
[1:13:20] you know all the time and and we fall
[1:13:21] for it so may god
[1:13:24] just bless each one of you
[1:13:28] praise the lord we've enjoyed having you
[1:13:30] enjoyed your sermons
[1:13:33] hello everybody hope everyone's having a
[1:13:36] good week i just want to take a quick
[1:13:37] opportunity to um
[1:13:39] thank god for everything he's done in my
[1:13:40] life over the last two years since i've
[1:13:42] been here
[1:13:43] um i can't say i knew any of you
[1:13:46] sexually or
[1:13:47] okay and jenny but um um
[1:13:50] yeah i'm a lot of i'm a different fellow
[1:13:52] since i came here and god's really um
[1:13:55] really worked on me i'm a lot happier um
[1:13:58] i've got a lot more forgiveness and
[1:14:00] character for people
[1:14:01] i stick things through and um do my best
[1:14:03] to them before
[1:14:05] i i definitely wasn't the same sort of
[1:14:07] person i didn't have the same sort of
[1:14:08] character i have now
[1:14:09] i wouldn't really have cared about many
[1:14:11] things
[1:14:13] um and yeah just wanted to say all the
[1:14:15] young people too
[1:14:16] just keep fighting um
[1:14:20] i've been noticing that the devil is so
[1:14:23] angry and he doesn't
[1:14:24] play by any rules so you know it doesn't
[1:14:26] matter what
[1:14:28] he has to do to get him between somebody
[1:14:30] he'll do it and um
[1:14:33] the thing that struck me a couple of
[1:14:34] weeks ago is he'll he'll get him between
[1:14:36] friends
[1:14:37] and he'll get in between people and
[1:14:38] he'll he'll just kill them he'll just
[1:14:40] kill them he wants to take life
[1:14:42] from everything and he doesn't care just
[1:14:44] laugh at you
[1:14:45] you know someone will scream the last
[1:14:47] death scream and be gone forever
[1:14:49] and he just laughs he doesn't care he
[1:14:51] doesn't play by any rules but
[1:14:52] god does and he loves us all and he
[1:14:55] wants us to forgive
[1:14:56] and have compassion keep fighting guys
[1:15:05] we haven't had testimonies
[1:15:09] i just remembered i've the most
[1:15:11] important part of my testimony
[1:15:13] what i was gonna say i missed the most
[1:15:17] important part
[1:15:17] um actually about the man
[1:15:21] having a manager that was that's cool
[1:15:23] but that wasn't actually what i wanted
[1:15:24] to say
[1:15:25] is that um what i had been praying for
[1:15:28] is that god would just give me a joy
[1:15:30] that i hadn't felt in a long time
[1:15:32] like just going to work and um what
[1:15:35] brother um
[1:15:37] reminded me that
[1:15:41] um i just want to thank god for
[1:15:42] restoring that joy that
[1:15:44] i haven't felt in a long time
[1:15:51] [Laughter]
[1:15:59] but i want to say thank you lord even an
[1:16:02] importance of just having a good sleep
[1:16:04] at night
[1:16:05] you don't know what you're missing when
[1:16:06] you don't have it for a long time
[1:16:09] and um for me it's been off and on over
[1:16:11] a few years but
[1:16:13] with the housing situation it's been
[1:16:16] really hard
[1:16:17] with the last house we've had was a lot
[1:16:20] of stuff that was just hard on the lungs
[1:16:23] and then every time you go in there it's
[1:16:24] just even in a few moments
[1:16:26] it's just really hard to breathe so we
[1:16:29] finally moved
[1:16:30] into otaki beginning of february and i
[1:16:33] just struggled
[1:16:34] every night to breathe in that place
[1:16:37] as well because they just had painted it
[1:16:39] new everything's new so they got
[1:16:41] all the glue and everything i don't know
[1:16:43] what it was but maybe because my lungs
[1:16:44] are already kind of like damaged maybe
[1:16:47] so i was like oh no now we finally moved
[1:16:49] and i still can't um
[1:16:51] can't be in this place and it was like
[1:16:54] that it was woe is me it was crying and
[1:16:56] all that sort of stuff but you know
[1:16:58] the lord also says that we can do these
[1:17:00] things and brother branham says you know
[1:17:03] it's like a baby you cry out and the
[1:17:05] lord will answer and he has done that
[1:17:07] for me he has answered my prayer
[1:17:09] last night i slept so well i haven't
[1:17:11] done it for years
[1:17:12] i had such a good sleep and i just want
[1:17:14] to encourage everyone that might feel
[1:17:16] down sometimes
[1:17:18] and can't get up by themselves go to
[1:17:21] somebody
[1:17:22] ask somebody pray for me ask somebody
[1:17:24] talk to me just
[1:17:25] fellowship something like that helps as
[1:17:28] well
[1:17:29] don't get downcast yes the lord is on
[1:17:32] our side
[1:17:32] praise the lord
[1:17:36] thanks mate um
[1:17:40] i had a dog like your sponge too
[1:17:43] and like you said it was hard it's it's
[1:17:45] it's a miniature doberman type of thing
[1:17:47] so it's got those
[1:17:48] brain waves of i don't mean so you got a
[1:17:50] good dog but i'll buy you a fluffy bag
[1:17:52] right
[1:17:53] my testimony is still what we're just
[1:17:55] talking about belinda and i and
[1:17:58] the last house that we left up nakata
[1:18:00] was
[1:18:01] really really severe we paid almost six
[1:18:04] thousand dollars
[1:18:05] for rent for not living there and and
[1:18:08] that's
[1:18:09] we don't have that sort of money so we
[1:18:10] went to the
[1:18:12] tribunals and the process was it
[1:18:15] that we were released from that one-year
[1:18:18] bond
[1:18:19] the whole rent but we haven't got any
[1:18:22] money back that's still in process
[1:18:24] okay but what i wanted to say is what i
[1:18:26] spoke to the pastor and
[1:18:28] and by the impo about a bit um
[1:18:31] almonds place is money is replaceable
[1:18:34] all right money is replaceable if you're
[1:18:36] chasing money
[1:18:38] don't it's replaceable because your
[1:18:40] health is you cannot replace your health
[1:18:43] right as i've seen the process of
[1:18:45] bacterium
[1:18:46] attacking my wife the whole concern is
[1:18:49] let's get out of here i'm not worried
[1:18:51] about what happens whether they throw
[1:18:52] you in jail
[1:18:54] your health is really really important
[1:18:56] it's just like your character your
[1:18:57] character you cannot replace
[1:19:00] all right but money you can replace so
[1:19:03] god
[1:19:04] is on our side amen
[1:19:10] do you have one i knew you did
[1:19:16] i just have to do it thank you
[1:19:19] okay so since last year in i think
[1:19:23] may my husband david
[1:19:26] his eye start is quite iterated and they
[1:19:28] are
[1:19:29] got a double vision so would
[1:19:32] he go somewhere i have to take him
[1:19:36] and it wasn't easy for me and sometimes
[1:19:38] i have to out of you know my workplace
[1:19:40] and i
[1:19:41] have to go with them and
[1:19:45] after then it's quite you know it takes
[1:19:48] time to you know heal
[1:19:49] his eyesight and so every
[1:19:53] four weeks and yeah
[1:19:56] six weeks and eight weeks i have to go
[1:19:59] to willington hospital
[1:20:00] to check with the i mean the specialist
[1:20:04] oh and uh yeah
[1:20:08] even though just take a time someone
[1:20:10] actually yeah he
[1:20:12] now he has our you know the prism lens
[1:20:16] so he can he can drive and yeah
[1:20:19] yeah god is so good and then also
[1:20:23] on the other side actually on the left
[1:20:26] side
[1:20:26] he had a frozen shoulder it's nothing
[1:20:29] happened as well
[1:20:30] so yeah it's quite tough
[1:20:33] and what you know he tried to exercise
[1:20:36] and
[1:20:36] this thing you know some massage to
[1:20:38] being there to
[1:20:39] you know check his shoulders
[1:20:44] but i don't know just in my heart
[1:20:47] sometimes and most
[1:20:51] talking about yeah god is you know god
[1:20:54] is real
[1:20:55] and god is looking after us as well so
[1:21:00] just keep going i can say that yeah god
[1:21:03] is in helping me
[1:21:04] and go through all the destroyers
[1:21:08] yeah but yeah also on the other hand you
[1:21:10] know sometimes it doesn't you know stop
[1:21:12] me
[1:21:12] yeah so my workplace was quite getting
[1:21:16] harder and harder because then we opened
[1:21:18] two more practices
[1:21:19] in last year february it's gotten
[1:21:23] getting busier and i have to look after
[1:21:25] other clinics about accounting as well
[1:21:28] and sometimes what my you know my boss
[1:21:31] said oh yeah 40 hours is enough for me
[1:21:34] and then i have my assistant and she has
[1:21:36] about 40 i'm
[1:21:37] 20 20 hours per week stay part-time job
[1:21:42] but it's getting it's too much yeah
[1:21:45] of a bit of my workplace and my
[1:21:48] circumstance
[1:21:50] as i end up five weeks ago i mentioned
[1:21:53] my boss you know it's enough so
[1:21:57] i rejoined my workplace so after that i
[1:22:00] feel
[1:22:00] so much better i don't care about my
[1:22:02] work in my circumstance
[1:22:04] even though my husband is not working
[1:22:07] i just i was so happy so i had such a
[1:22:10] good sleep when i make a decision
[1:22:13] so i came to i mean my research i handed
[1:22:16] into my
[1:22:17] resignation to my boss and he said
[1:22:20] you're quite so shocked because i've
[1:22:21] been there for nine and a half years
[1:22:25] but yeah he said oh i think hannah i
[1:22:27] think you made the wrong decision
[1:22:29] so can you think of it i'll give you 24
[1:22:31] hours just you know
[1:22:33] often just let me know okay so
[1:22:37] i already made the decision so okay so
[1:22:39] my answer is
[1:22:40] you know okay that's it yeah done
[1:22:43] well following day he didn't come to
[1:22:46] workplace
[1:22:47] so okay so i mean i text him you know i
[1:22:50] want to
[1:22:51] mention this one to you in person but
[1:22:53] you are not here so
[1:22:54] i text them yeah i did i resigned
[1:22:57] this workplace you know today so yeah
[1:23:01] okay so he takes me back okay yeah if
[1:23:03] you made decision that way okay
[1:23:05] i accepted that after then about 30 days
[1:23:08] later
[1:23:09] he actually came to me because everyone
[1:23:12] i have to mention to my
[1:23:13] you know staff members and i'm resigning
[1:23:16] here
[1:23:17] when they say some people are crying and
[1:23:19] some people couldn't believe that you
[1:23:21] know end of you know
[1:23:22] how many i'm sorry i shouldn't mention
[1:23:24] his name
[1:23:27] probably need you know maybe three four
[1:23:28] people have to cover yours you know
[1:23:30] your jobs well end up he called me
[1:23:35] hannah actually you know i think about
[1:23:37] it what shall i do
[1:23:39] my you know my audience can be our
[1:23:41] full-time and also
[1:23:43] as much as you have your i mean your
[1:23:45] task you can delegate to the accountants
[1:23:47] as well
[1:23:48] so he gave a more opportunity to give me
[1:23:50] a you know
[1:23:51] delegate task to other staff members and
[1:23:53] to accountant as well so
[1:23:55] it's always a procedure doing the stuff
[1:23:57] as i have to talk with
[1:23:59] our content some of tasks i can give you
[1:24:01] know delicate tasks
[1:24:03] to them as well so god is so good and
[1:24:06] the
[1:24:07] i don't know
[1:24:10] i can see that what god is moving and
[1:24:12] you know the situation
[1:24:14] so think about them all the time you
[1:24:16] know no matter what you go through just
[1:24:18] you know praise the lord and
[1:24:19] you know give glory to god and the god
[1:24:21] will do you know handling all the
[1:24:23] situation
[1:24:24] you can move on all the mountains and
[1:24:26] even though sometimes
[1:24:27] you are in the valley you can still you
[1:24:30] can look up the sky
[1:24:31] and the god is watching over you yes
[1:24:34] praise the lord
[1:24:39] amen praise the lord
[1:24:44] i've just got one pre-request and then
[1:24:46] we can
[1:24:48] go we'll just pray it's
[1:24:52] that's what i like about this fellowship
[1:24:53] you know like that everyone wants to
[1:24:54] share it's nice it's just
[1:24:56] it's easier to stop something and start
[1:24:58] and try and get people to talk you know
[1:25:00] and i'm not too bashful that i can't
[1:25:04] say stop but everyone's happy
[1:25:07] no praise the lord i enjoyed that and um
[1:25:10] i just won't pray i've got two
[1:25:12] my um mother's mother passed away on um
[1:25:15] sunday
[1:25:16] that's it wasn't a shock so it's not you
[1:25:19] know
[1:25:21] that wasn't the request but um
[1:25:24] i found out that i have to um shed about
[1:25:27] five years ago before she got dementia
[1:25:29] she actually
[1:25:30] um nominated me in her will or her
[1:25:34] funeral wishes i suppose you'd say
[1:25:37] to do the eulogy and my father was to
[1:25:40] read a scripture she said kevin leaves
[1:25:43] scripture reading and brackets not too
[1:25:44] long
[1:25:46] and then isaac lee eulogy and um
[1:25:50] and it's you know of all the people she
[1:25:52] could have chosen you know
[1:25:54] in the whole family she she chose me now
[1:25:56] my grandmother's
[1:25:57] she's catholic she was brought up
[1:25:59] catholic and she
[1:26:00] she but she was a woman of faith i think
[1:26:02] she'd just been sidetracked by the
[1:26:03] catholic church but she was a real woman
[1:26:04] of faith and we had a
[1:26:05] we went to see her on the monday last
[1:26:07] week before she passed away and it was a
[1:26:08] real supernatural time
[1:26:10] there and she was she had a little
[1:26:12] crucifix there and she was saying i
[1:26:14] can't
[1:26:14] believe what they've done to this man
[1:26:16] look what they did to him and
[1:26:18] little aby went to give her a hug and
[1:26:19] she she she doesn't know who we are or
[1:26:22] anything you know she's got dementia she
[1:26:23] doesn't know who we are and she's saying
[1:26:24] to abraham
[1:26:25] do you believe in god and he'll say yes
[1:26:27] i do and she'll say you've taught him
[1:26:29] well you know
[1:26:30] as much as you forgot a lot of things
[1:26:31] she didn't forget the lord but
[1:26:34] the reason why i want asking for prayer
[1:26:36] for i suppose is because
[1:26:39] my family situation has been reasonably
[1:26:41] tough for a long time because my my
[1:26:43] family sort of a lot of them don't
[1:26:44] really serve the lord and they've always
[1:26:46] been anti-me for a long long time you
[1:26:47] know
[1:26:49] so i i avoid family get-togethers
[1:26:51] because i just don't enjoy this big
[1:26:53] booze up and that and i'm just like i
[1:26:54] don't i just don't go for years news i
[1:26:55] haven't gone so i don't really enjoy the
[1:26:57] environment and they probably think you
[1:26:58] know you're just
[1:27:00] shunning us you know but i went to one
[1:27:02] over christmas and it was just weird but
[1:27:04] um
[1:27:05] christmas before but um i went to one
[1:27:10] the last one we went to we went i can
[1:27:11] share this because just say give some
[1:27:13] backstory we went to another it was
[1:27:16] actually someone's birthday quite a
[1:27:17] prominent person on the family's
[1:27:18] birthday and we all made an effort to go
[1:27:19] there and then
[1:27:21] after about four hours of bar hopping
[1:27:24] whatever they call everyone's drunk and
[1:27:25] then we're at this other place and
[1:27:27] you know we're now talking about this
[1:27:29] person whose birthday it was i don't
[1:27:30] want to see how it is but
[1:27:32] and then and saying nice things and
[1:27:34] people saying i
[1:27:35] like this about you and that and so
[1:27:37] they're all drunk and everyone's going
[1:27:39] yeah and then
[1:27:40] i get up and you know to say my little
[1:27:41] bit about what i like about this person
[1:27:44] and it was like a it was an unbelievable
[1:27:47] scene because
[1:27:48] the person i was saying it to said was
[1:27:51] drunk and they're like
[1:27:53] they started attacking me it was it was
[1:27:55] real spiritual it was a demon you know
[1:27:56] and then
[1:27:57] and then they started saying things like
[1:27:58] who made you the pastor over us
[1:28:00] and all this stuff you know and and they
[1:28:02] were all drunk and they were i was and i
[1:28:04] was standing up in the
[1:28:05] at this big table and they're all just
[1:28:06] starting to then attack me spiritually
[1:28:08] it was the strangest thing
[1:28:10] i mean i i didn't really i thought this
[1:28:12] is why i don't come to these things i
[1:28:13] just don't want to be here
[1:28:14] i was actually a naughty boy and i was
[1:28:16] like hey guys look i appreciate
[1:28:18] that i'm out man i'm done i'm like i
[1:28:20] probably should have just said like i
[1:28:22] was going to sit down and i was like hey
[1:28:23] you guys just have you i've been here
[1:28:24] four or five hours already you guys have
[1:28:26] drunk on you know have a good rest of
[1:28:27] your party bye
[1:28:29] so it's kind of hard now like so i've
[1:28:32] got to go up on fr
[1:28:33] on friday and like oh who's this guy i
[1:28:35] think he's now he's
[1:28:37] no you know sort of like joseph you know
[1:28:39] like yeah
[1:28:41] do you know there's a bit of that going
[1:28:42] on and but you know after visiting nan
[1:28:44] on the on the weekend just before she
[1:28:46] passed away we were sort of the last
[1:28:47] people to see her and the family before
[1:28:48] she went
[1:28:49] and couldn't really talk or do anything
[1:28:50] she fell unconscious after
[1:28:52] the next day but you know i know that
[1:28:55] she
[1:28:56] chose me because she knew that i would
[1:28:57] tell the people she was a woman of faith
[1:28:59] you know she she loved the lord and that
[1:29:00] was that was her story
[1:29:02] and i know that's why she chose me and
[1:29:04] so
[1:29:05] i just want wisdom to it's a catholic
[1:29:07] church this is a catholic thing you know
[1:29:08] but
[1:29:09] she she's relying on me to tell the
[1:29:10] people i was a woman of faith you know
[1:29:12] and
[1:29:14] so she didn't want someone just talking
[1:29:15] about her life or anything she wanted
[1:29:16] someone to
[1:29:17] to say that so yeah that's
[1:29:20] just remember me on friday at about two
[1:29:23] o'clock and this

[1:29:26] blasting the catholic church when i'm up
