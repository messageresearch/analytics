[33:21] brother Moses thought as he Labor's for

[33:41] of you Lord that you could work through
[33:43] him and and that that that fellowship
[33:45] would be fruitful and prosperous and
[33:47] your kingdom Lord so we just pray this
[33:49] in just with ourselves to you Jesus name
[33:51] Amen
[33:52] thank you
[33:57] okay well you're standing it's um bring
[34:03] up my fight feels like a nice intimate
[34:08] service this morning it's nice actually
[34:13] I kind of like it when there's just a
[34:14] few people you can kind of just talk to
[34:16] the people look at each one in deal
[34:20] individually I like it good lord
[34:24] so the thought that I've had on my heart
[34:26] today is unconditional love and it's
[34:31] been quite a blessing for me to get this
[34:32] one together and it may may seem like
[34:38] now we often just talk about
[34:40] unconditional love and you hear it and a
[34:41] lot of it's a bit of a feel-good it
[34:45] could be a feel-good theme and you can
[34:49] just sort of you know make it up wish
[34:51] you wash you think and in some ways
[34:54] there's a bit of truth to that what it
[34:55] is but you know there's a there is a
[34:56] deep drunkenness or love that when we
[34:58] realize that young conditional love
[35:00] towards us personally
[35:03] it's been a nice experience for me and
[35:06] I've just got a few of my controlling
[35:08] this now I just want to read a few a few
[35:12] scriptures during one of our first on 4
[35:20] verse 8 says he that loveth not knoweth
[35:23] not God for god is love and first John
[35:29] 4:16 says and we have known and believed
[35:33] the love that God hath to us god is love
[35:37] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[35:39] God and God and him
[35:41] you can take your seats under Steve he
[35:43] made a little bless the reading of his
[35:44] word praise the Lord
[35:48] now that's something that the world
[35:50] needs more of but unfortunately it's not
[35:52] going to get more of as we reject Christ
[35:56] we ultimately reject love that's this
[36:00] the way that this thing works you know
[36:02] we try and go about this process some
[36:08] other way and yet there is really no
[36:09] other way apart from bidding the love of
[36:12] God come in and dwell on us and manifest
[36:15] that love and as the world gets darker
[36:17] they'll be listening this love but there
[36:18] will never be no love at all but
[36:23] unfortunately what we we see events
[36:26] happen we see things happen that a just
[36:28] seemed to be void of love you know and
[36:30] it's a it's it it said it said mister
[36:36] brings our sadness know when we see
[36:38] these but I want to read a scripture I'm
[36:47] just gonna get into the hook that's I've
[36:48] got a few to get through but I want to
[36:50] read the scripture and this is when
[36:53] Jesus was meeting with the Pharisees and
[36:59] it sees a nezzie spake cousin Luke 11
[37:01] did he seem him to 42 as he spake a
[37:03] certain Pharisee besought him to dine
[37:05] with them and he went in and sat down to
[37:07] meet when the Pharisees saw it he
[37:09] marvelled that he had not first washed
[37:11] before dinner and the Lord said unto Him
[37:16] now do you Pharisees make clean the
[37:19] outside of the cup and the pleasure but
[37:21] your inward part is full of ravening and
[37:23] wickedness he fools did not he that made
[37:26] that which is without make back with
[37:27] chisel then also but rather give arms of
[37:30] such things such things as you have and
[37:32] behold all things are clean unto you but
[37:35] woe unto you Pharisees we tithe mint and
[37:38] Rue and all manner of herbs and pass
[37:41] over judgment and the love of God
[37:44] these ought ye to have done and not to
[37:47] leave the other undone you pass over
[37:51] judgment in the love of God now who
[37:53] doesn't wash your hands before they eat
[37:56] I've got a bad habit of doing that and
[37:58] my argument is like the Lord says I say
[38:01] well the disciples ate with unwashen
[38:03] hands hey when you're from the bush you
[38:08] know you just kind of hey you know you
[38:11] just you kind of fuzzy you the hands are
[38:13] all dirty anyway you just kind of get
[38:15] into it but it's actually it's probably
[38:17] a bad habit to do like like um maybe
[38:21] study photos from the city here Saudi
[38:25] folk her but more proper rate country
[38:27] folk her a bit more rough and rugged I
[38:32] don't know why I'm saying it but hey but
[38:35] that's that's where I come from no got
[38:38] in the bush we kind of just get into it
[38:41] but but you to these Pharisees it was
[38:44] such a big deal that the Jesus it was
[38:47] they they they must have rated this
[38:51] quite high in their and their things
[38:53] they thought were important and that but
[38:55] you know it wasn't really overly
[38:57] important Jesus he looks ultimately it
[38:58] doesn't really matter you know just
[39:00] hands you know that's not the thing that
[39:02] really makes you unclean but I like it
[39:05] how he said you pass over judgment and
[39:06] the love of God and the to actually go
[39:08] together because judgment God's love
[39:14] drove him to take judgment right so
[39:17] judgment and the love of God go hand in
[39:18] hand
[39:19] pass over judgment in the love of God
[39:21] now we're going to be talking about love
[39:24] this morning but different facets of
[39:26] love and then I want to get into
[39:28] unconditional love but we want to talk
[39:30] this idea called love love who enjoys
[39:34] love makes you feel good a love like if
[39:40] I didn't live I had to live with that
[39:42] love would be very very unhappy
[39:44] I enjoy love I enjoy being involved in
[39:47] love I enjoy loving situations with us
[39:50] with this love now were you're involved
[39:52] in it in a moment where there's a lot of
[39:54] love thank you do you like that you know
[39:56] when you feel and it makes you feel good
[39:58] it's love God is love and I think as a
[40:02] Christian we enjoy love we enjoy being
[40:05] in an atmosphere of love and we can we
[40:08] can we can recognize what love is in
[40:11] open up your heart to love know who's
[40:14] quite an emotional person I'm actually
[40:19] believe it or not I'm actually a very
[40:20] emotional person I get overwhelmed my
[40:23] stuff all the time I may not seem like I
[40:25] do but I get overwhelmed most up all the
[40:26] time I'm an emotional person and I
[40:28] actually like emotion I like embracing
[40:31] emotion I like embracing love I like
[40:33] being in situations where you feel
[40:35] things and when you can with someone
[40:37] achieve something in you you think man
[40:39] I'm so happy they achieved it you know
[40:40] and I've actually had tears in my eyes
[40:43] and I've here keys and wires and the
[40:44] most silliest of places like events and
[40:47] things you know that you crying about I
[40:49] actually do
[40:50] sometimes I try and hide it but I the
[40:52] emotion of these things into seeing
[40:55] someone do stuff to well or seeing
[40:57] things
[40:59] I like I like love right now I got the
[41:03] set of the Strongs definition of love as
[41:05] lovers to love to be full of goodwill
[41:08] and exhibit the same to have a
[41:09] preference for which well to regard that
[41:11] well Thomas liked it it's like this good
[41:13] feeling right that we love it is it it's
[41:17] just a nice thing and I think when
[41:20] you're a Christian more and more you
[41:21] like you appreciate love if you want to
[41:24] give me more love just give me more love
[41:25] I like it now I'll do the same for you
[41:27] to be full of goodwill and exhibit the
[41:29] same hey that's what we say you know in
[41:32] a nice relationship with somebody as as
[41:34] love back and forth I love you You Love
[41:36] Me we you know we we do that towards
[41:38] each other and we appreciate each other
[41:40] company and we grow together and we
[41:41] we're happy right that's that's love now
[41:46] just bear with me as I go through these
[41:47] things this is where Paul talks about
[41:51] love and it's from first Corinthians
[41:53] 13:1 and he says though I speak with the
[41:55] tongues of men and of angels and have
[41:56] not love I am become as sounding brass
[41:59] or a tinkling some I got another
[42:01] translation here just sometimes it's
[42:03] easier to get the idea of different
[42:05] words if I speak in the tongues of men
[42:07] or of angels but do not have love I am
[42:09] only a resounding gong or a clanging
[42:11] cymbal
[42:12] he knows what gong is Fritsche note of
[42:15] gong is one of those things down there
[42:19] by the Japanese thought phone to
[42:22] announce some sort of event happening or
[42:24] something Gong makes a whole lot of
[42:26] noise you know a symbol like this but
[42:29] you know all says if I could all my
[42:32] talking that I could do if I didn't have
[42:33] love I'm just like a whole lot of noise
[42:36] with no real substance to it right love
[42:39] has got a life to it love is something
[42:41] richer then just a natural thing it's
[42:45] actually got life and he's saying if I
[42:46] could speak all with different tongues
[42:48] and I could know everything and if I
[42:49] talked about this but didn't have love
[42:51] don't forget that as we go through have
[42:53] love not feel love but have love I'm
[42:55] becoming this flame brother and you and
[42:58] I were talking about it the other day
[42:59] it's just like chitter-chatter
[43:00] chitter-chatter you know brother Brown
[43:02] talks about right and he says and though
[43:07] I have the gift of prophecy and
[43:09] understand all mysteries and all
[43:10] knowledge and though I have all faith so
[43:12] that I could remove mountains and have
[43:14] not love I'm nothing
[43:15] so I could do all these wonderful things
[43:17] even have faith to work all sorts of
[43:21] miracles and have not love I'm still
[43:23] nothing that's it would do me no good
[43:28] then he says even if I do loving things
[43:31] right and though I bestow all my goods
[43:33] to feed the poor who's given all the
[43:36] goods away to feed the poor at some
[43:37] point in time and you'd have to be quite
[43:40] a loving guy to do their day you give
[43:41] boy all your stuff to feed the poor he's
[43:43] saying even if I give all my goods to
[43:45] feed the poor and though I give my body
[43:47] to be burned and have not love it
[43:49] profits me nothing or if we say the
[43:52] other one is and if I give all wife is
[43:53] to feed the poor and if I surrender my
[43:56] body to be burned but do not have love
[43:57] it profits me nothing but that's
[44:00] actually a loving act and yet he's
[44:01] saying up I don't have love it's not
[44:03] really any value to me because get into
[44:07] it a bit later but you know true love is
[44:09] actually the Holy Ghost right that's
[44:12] what actually true lovers are these
[44:14] saying so Paul in these verses is
[44:16] actually saying I could do all these
[44:19] things you know if I don't have love
[44:20] itself dwelling in me then what benefit
[44:22] is that all to me at end of the day what
[44:24] what benefit is this whole thing it
[44:25] really is of no value if I don't have
[44:27] that have love itself okay that's the
[44:30] that's the truth behind this verse so it
[44:33] would appear like you're doing a loving
[44:34] deed and yet how can you do a loving big
[44:36] with no love he's not talking about that
[44:39] love he's talking about the love of God
[44:42] which dwells in us by the Holy Ghost
[44:47] but now let's just get into this idea of
[44:50] love now for a minute and the emotion of
[44:52] love because I want to talk about that
[44:53] for a bit to kind of get into this
[44:54] concept of this feeling of love Matthew
[44:58] 9 verse 10 to 13 says it came to pass as
[45:01] Jesus said it meet and their house
[45:02] behold many publicans and sinners came
[45:05] and sat down with him and his disciples
[45:07] I'm just gonna stop here and tell you he
[45:09] remembers brother Joseph barley from
[45:12] Tauranga now he came out of it yeah he's
[45:16] a real nice guy he came out of a like a
[45:18] rough background and I think I don't
[45:23] know if he meet brother Andy and
[45:24] prisoner was brother I think was brother
[45:25] Ian do you know if he was he got saved
[45:28] in prison here's testimony maybe here or
[45:30] maybe was at that but he's a he had a
[45:33] rough life growing up and then God had
[45:35] mercy upon him and when he's preached
[45:37] this testimony it was actually back in
[45:39] Gisborne this was the verse he used and
[45:42] when he read the lines that I've
[45:44] underlined here he said it so powerful
[45:46] that I knew he meet what he was reading
[45:48] so well this verse has always struck me
[45:50] because this was the basis of what his
[45:51] testimony was like he read through this
[45:54] and he said and when the Pharisees saw
[45:55] it they stood unto his disciples why
[45:57] eateth your master with publicans and
[45:59] sinners but when Jesus heard it he said
[46:01] unto them they that be whole need not a
[46:04] physician but they that are sick but go
[46:07] and learn what that meaneth I will have
[46:09] mercy and not sacrifice for I am come to
[46:12] call for I'm not come to call the
[46:14] righteous but sinners to repentance I
[46:16] will have mercy not sacrifice so God is
[46:22] coming down and he's saying I'm here to
[46:26] actually have mercy mercy it's such a
[46:29] nice feeling isn't it
[46:30] mercy like a night when you think about
[46:32] the concept of mercy who's ever asked
[46:36] for forgiveness for something for
[46:37] someone maybe you've missed up with even
[46:39] your husband or wife or something you've
[46:41] missed that and you've said look you're
[46:43] so remorseful of it and you feel so bad
[46:45] and you say look I'm sorry
[46:46] and they genuinely tell you look it's
[46:49] alright
[46:50] they have mercy who's had that happen to
[46:52] you before you feel good I feel good
[46:55] because you receive mercy mercy is such
[46:57] a nice thing and mercy and love are all
[46:59] wrapped up together it's this desire
[47:01] that you would want someone to be built
[47:03] up rather than torn down because if you
[47:05] say to them look it's alright don't
[47:07] worry about it I forgive you I eat it
[47:09] let's move on you you're actually
[47:11] encouraging me to grow and she'll learn
[47:13] because you know that they've learned
[47:14] from whatever mistake that they've made
[47:15] or whatever it was you think I don't
[47:17] want you to wallow there I want you to
[47:18] just learn from it move on move up you
[47:22] know mercy such a wonderful feeling in
[47:25] Jesus the Heart of Jesus is actually
[47:27] mercy mercy and love he's here and he's
[47:31] saying I will have mercy and not
[47:32] sacrifice but so I want to just tell you
[47:37] a few just to get our mind thinking
[47:39] about there's good good thoughts of this
[47:45] heartwarming type of thing called love
[47:49] right because we we can be involved in
[47:51] situations that half woman would do
[47:53] stuff to someone and we we we feel good
[47:55] about it or we can have someone do
[47:57] something to us and it's heartwarming
[47:59] this this story here there were there
[48:02] were two boys walking along the road and
[48:07] they see a pair of boots on the side of
[48:10] this road and they look out in the field
[48:12] and there's an old man working out in
[48:14] the field and they see the boots there
[48:19] and the young boy says hey I've got an
[48:22] idea what we should do we should hide
[48:24] his boots and then we'll sneak up in the
[48:27] tree and we'll watch him and when he
[48:29] comes back we'll watch them be all
[48:30] confused them flex this dude where are
[48:32] my boots who's taken my boots then we'll
[48:34] watch them walk around try and find his
[48:35] boots in well we have a bit of a laugh
[48:37] and then when he goes we'll sneak off
[48:39] and the older boy that was with him he
[48:43] said to the young boy he said no I don't
[48:47] think that's such a good idea by the
[48:50] looks of these boots these are these are
[48:54] old boots these are worn down boots by
[48:57] the looks of these boots this man looks
[48:58] like a poor man
[48:59] it looks like he's struggling why don't
[49:02] we do something different why don't we
[49:05] take one of our dollars and why don't I
[49:08] take one of my silver dollars and I'll
[49:09] put one in one boot and you put one in
[49:11] the other boot then we'll go hide in the
[49:13] tree and we'll watch him and we'll see
[49:16] what he does when he sees that he's got
[49:17] an extra $2.00 and his boots and the
[49:21] young boys okay let's do that so they
[49:24] put the dollar in each booth and they
[49:25] win and they hit man the old man comes
[49:28] in from working in the field and he goes
[49:30] to put his boots on he puts one on and
[49:32] he feels something under his heel so I
[49:35] reaches down and he sees a silver dollar
[49:39] and a small comes on his face and he
[49:42] goes to put his other boot on and he
[49:44] sees another it was another lump under
[49:47] his other heel and he puts his hand and
[49:49] his boot and he sees the other dollar
[49:51] and then the the boys are watching this
[49:54] man and tears start to come to his eyes
[49:56] and he drops down to his knees this is
[49:58] old god you know how much I'm struggling
[50:00] you know how much that I've got a wife
[50:03] and little children you know and there
[50:05] we don't have much food and I'm just
[50:06] doing all that I can to survive and yet
[50:08] you've now given me two dollars and he
[50:11] raises hands up he said thank you Lord
[50:13] for doing this for me and whoever's
[50:15] whoever's actually put that in there may
[50:17] god bless him and he went on his way
[50:19] rejoicing is happy and the older boy
[50:23] said to the young boy walking away he
[50:25] said didn't your heart get warm when you
[50:28] watch that situation that's called hot
[50:31] woman
[50:32] and exit Bluffs make our heart warm
[50:34] right there's a hot woman and that's
[50:37] that's love that's what we can
[50:41] experience when we receive or give acts
[50:44] of love the betterment of someone else I
[50:54] want to tell you another of the story
[50:58] who knows just the Cure is
[51:01] sister Shannon Tina we're free to
[51:03] experience in America Virginian so this
[51:11] is during the Civil War and the the
[51:14] Confederate troops were in
[51:17] Fredericksburg and the Union troops they
[51:22] had been given orders to attack free
[51:24] Pittsburgh and they had to because they
[51:27] thought if they can get that in that's
[51:28] their main headquarters and and then it
[51:30] could defeat the the Confederate Army so
[51:34] the the Confederate Army they were well
[51:38] fortified in this town because they got
[51:40] word that the trip coming so they had a
[51:42] chance to fortify themselves and up on
[51:44] the back Hill here you can see they had
[51:45] all their cannons up along the back then
[51:47] they had a big rock wall right around
[51:49] the front and all the men stood around
[51:52] the wall who said of Stonewall Jackson
[51:55] here was commanding the guys that were
[51:57] on that wall and robert e lee was there
[51:59] as well and I don't I can't remember the
[52:02] other guys names that were attacking and
[52:04] then the guys on the rock wall they
[52:08] would have a system where there would be
[52:09] two or three lines of them and so the
[52:11] front guys would the plan was the front
[52:13] guys would shoot then they would step
[52:14] back and reload while the guys behind
[52:15] them stood up and they shot well the
[52:17] other guys reloaded so it was that it
[52:20] was just bang bang bang so they they
[52:23] were attacked one day by the Union
[52:25] troops that was in late December so it
[52:27] was winter and the Union troops got
[52:31] massacred they just keep going wave
[52:35] after wave all day to try and attack
[52:36] these guys but the cannons were getting
[52:38] shot at them from up on top of the hill
[52:39] on them and then as soon as they got
[52:40] close they were just getting mowed down
[52:42] one guy that we
[52:43] and gave a report back to I think was
[52:46] Abraham Lincoln and said it was that was
[52:48] a it was a butchery what happened there
[52:50] I think there were 12,000 men that died
[52:52] in one day out on this open battlefield
[52:55] so at night they all pull back and you
[52:59] can imagine that night the people on one
[53:02] side and on the other side all they
[53:03] could hear what just sick wounded people
[53:06] out in the battlefield moaning in just
[53:10] because they're all just sitting out
[53:11] there bullets and then there's an awful
[53:16] situation and you can imagine the night
[53:18] as a war went on and that silence of the
[53:20] night came down or you could hear what
[53:22] these men and that thousands of men in
[53:24] the field moaning in the morning in the
[53:29] morning there was a Confederate soldier
[53:32] that I think by the by the time the
[53:35] morning came around he just something
[53:37] came over him he thought this is the
[53:38] whole situation just wrong not this is
[53:41] not right and so he could hear these
[53:45] guys out there just crying out for water
[53:49] dehydrated in just that maybe lost all
[53:52] their blood in it and so this man said
[53:55] to all his comrades give me all your
[53:57] water canteens so he loaded himself up
[53:59] with water canteens he hopped over the
[54:02] wall and he the first man he saw he
[54:04] started giving him some water
[54:05] well the Union guys on the other side
[54:08] thought that here's a man trying to rob
[54:09] the dead bodies so they took a few shots
[54:11] at him but he just stayed out there and
[54:13] when they looked through their telescope
[54:16] at this man they realized he's not
[54:18] actually stealing their guns and things
[54:21] he's actually going around giving them
[54:23] water and for three hours for three
[54:25] hours this man went and gave water to
[54:28] all these soldiers for three hours or
[54:30] just by himself went all around all
[54:32] around because he felt you know we
[54:33] shouldn't just be leaving these guys he
[54:34] did if you're gonna shoot me shoot me I
[54:36] don't care I'm gonna give I'm gonna help
[54:37] these guys out in and it was a
[54:44] selfless act of love that he did and I
[54:46] think that the people on both sides just
[54:48] sit and watched and saw this one man
[54:49] just in the midst of hate and the midst
[54:52] of all this hate someone could just show
[54:54] some love and it touched the touch thing
[54:57] I don't think they think they're both
[54:58] was true after that but his name was
[55:01] Richard Kirkland they called him the
[55:03] angel of Mary's Heights and you know
[55:07] when we do acts of love they live on you
[55:09] know that it's a saying hero never dies
[55:13] but a coward dies a thousand times now
[55:16] if you die as a coward you just get your
[55:18] name you strung down every time someone
[55:19] talks about you here's the coward it was
[55:21] this he was that but they hear I never
[55:22] dies they even made a monument for him
[55:25] right by where the stone wall was and it
[55:28] says at the risk of us his and memoriam
[55:31] Richard Roland Kirkland at the risk of
[55:34] his life this American soldier of
[55:36] sublime sublime compassion brought water
[55:39] to his wounded foes at Fredericksburg
[55:45] the fighting men on both sides of the
[55:48] line caught in the angel of Mary's house
[55:50] as legacy lives on because he showed an
[55:52] act of love and no doubt it would have
[55:54] touched the people that were watching
[55:55] would have touched their hearts about
[55:56] what this man did right that's love now
[55:59] it makes you make sure you ponder it
[56:00] makes you feel good and would have made
[56:03] the mean Fonda when they are watching as
[56:05] to what they were seeing right so we
[56:08] just we're just trying to talk about
[56:09] this emotion of love and these other
[56:14] ones I can't really um I have to play
[56:16] you some video because I it's hard to
[56:18] describe these different situations I
[56:21] can talk about those stories but that's
[56:23] this here these here
[56:25] I like moments where someone was happy
[56:30] or they became bitter and they were they
[56:32] felt good and then the emotion of the
[56:34] moment overcame then there was a and it
[56:38] wasn't a moment of hate it was a moment
[56:40] of love and different in different forms
[56:41] right because I want to try and just
[56:43] paint a picture for you and get an idea
[56:46] of this thing called love and how how it
[56:48] affects us right
[57:07] who said some is it really different
[57:53] there's just flowers we got for him
[57:55] how about landed no we just put them
[57:58] there cuz it's winter
[58:01] look at your kids eyes Petey they're so
[58:04] pretty
[58:23] [Music]
[58:29] [Music]
[58:35] [Music]
[58:43] [Music]
[59:04] [Music]
[59:14] the fries buddy
[59:24] mommy did good job surprises gonna take
[59:29] your goggles off real quick
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:01:26] funny can you look at the case they look
[1:01:33] up at the frisbee
[1:02:36] so that's you know as a Christian we
[1:02:40] should be able to embrace they'll be
[1:02:44] scared to embrace the emotion of love
[1:02:45] you know a cold stony heart it's hard
[1:02:49] for him to to embrace love right but as
[1:02:52] a Christian we should be overwhelmed a
[1:02:55] lot of the day yeah when we spend time
[1:02:58] with friends with believers and that and
[1:02:59] just different things because we're we
[1:03:02] can be recipients of the emotion of love
[1:03:04] because it's a part of us brother
[1:03:07] branham I think was a very emotional man
[1:03:09] know he would be maybe go back to his
[1:03:12] old childhood place and it'd be just
[1:03:13] tears flowing down his cheeks and now
[1:03:16] that's that's just to be able to feel
[1:03:18] Italy let the beauty of life you know
[1:03:21] life is a beautiful thing the beauty of
[1:03:24] love come and embrace it we're not crazy

[1:03:38] what my secret of the greatest how do
[1:03:42] you like to tell tonight what I think is
[1:03:44] the greatest most powerful force it was
[1:03:46] on earth would you like me to tell you
[1:03:49] about it and a few minutes you might not
[1:03:51] love me so well after this because I
[1:03:53] would just tell you all the mightiest
[1:03:56] force errors on earth is love that's
[1:03:59] exactly it is nothing that would break
[1:04:01] down love no matter what it is whatever
[1:04:03] you are or what you you might have seen
[1:04:05] you might have danced in the spirit you
[1:04:07] might have spoke with tongues you might
[1:04:09] have shook the oldest hand you might
[1:04:10] have been baptized three times this way
[1:04:12] backwards face wood anywhere you want
[1:04:14] but until love anchors in your heart you
[1:04:16] saw out of God that's right that's right
[1:04:19] you've got to have love and the Bible
[1:04:20] said God is love and God
[1:04:23] love is the strongest force no tear me
[1:04:28] down a bit bro now I want to read you
[1:04:30] just another another passage you'd know
[1:04:32] the story but I want to read it again
[1:04:33] just to now start getting the sort of
[1:04:35] the most powerful force there is a sort
[1:04:37] of few weeks ago where there was a big
[1:04:39] teeny richter not slamming God forgive
[1:04:40] we're a man city who cast out evil
[1:04:42] spirits which I have no doubt of that
[1:04:44] but evil spirits are not cast out by
[1:04:46] cruel and different living the most
[1:04:48] powerful weapon there is in the world is
[1:04:50] love I stood by a lady the other night
[1:04:53] we are husband was fixing to leave here
[1:04:54] and marry another woman very fine known
[1:04:56] couple I looked at her and said she said
[1:04:58] well I'm going to leave brother Brennan
[1:05:00] I said don't do it sister told me oh my
[1:05:03] husband has ministry ministry will be
[1:05:05] ruined now what can I do I'm going to go
[1:05:07] to New York and I'm going to get me a
[1:05:09] job I said don't do it don't do it
[1:05:11] sister what can I do brother Brennan go
[1:05:14] up to him see oh I found the lady's
[1:05:21] picture and I broke it up I done so and
[1:05:24] so I said I see that but I see go to him
[1:05:28] and put your arms around him and say
[1:05:29] sweetheart no matter what you've done I
[1:05:31] still love you that'll do it that's
[1:05:33] right the most powerful force in the
[1:05:36] world a young couple young fella came to
[1:05:40] me not long ago now you all know the
[1:05:41] story he was a Pentecostal it seen too
[1:05:43] much of these meetings then he goes his
[1:05:45] wife was a staunch Lutheran he said oh I
[1:05:47] guess you're with young and shouted last
[1:05:49] night said I guess you was all speaking
[1:05:51] in tongues and doing all this last night
[1:05:52] he got down on the floor said god I cast
[1:05:55] the devil out of here I cast the devil
[1:05:57] out of here almost a divorce case the
[1:05:59] man a fine man he came to me he said
[1:06:01] brother Brennan we're going to heaven
[1:06:02] divorce like this he said I just can't
[1:06:05] get the devil to move out of here I said
[1:06:07] brother you're going at it the wrong way
[1:06:09] when she starts like that sake all right
[1:06:11] there bless your heart honey and be real
[1:06:13] kind to her just see how much you can do
[1:06:15] for her see a brother Brennan well how
[1:06:18] will they ever get the devil out I said
[1:06:20] you do as I say and just keep praying in
[1:06:22] your heart see and I see it and God will
[1:06:25] take care of the rest of it he called me
[1:06:26] up about two or three weeks later he
[1:06:28] said my home has revolutionized he said
[1:06:30] my wife was a different person I said
[1:06:33] which is the most which is the most
[1:06:34] powerful screaming and kicking in
[1:06:37] or putting your arms around here and
[1:06:39] love God is love if you also love the
[1:06:41] world yes since my faith I saw the
[1:06:43] stream dye fly wound supplied redeeming
[1:06:46] love has been my theme and shall be till
[1:06:48] I die okay now now he's saying you can
[1:06:53] do all the shouting and carrying on and
[1:06:54] all the stuff but ultimately the most
[1:06:56] powerful forces love this this force
[1:06:59] called love now when we watch those
[1:07:01] videos before me this
[1:07:02] there was an emotion that came with it
[1:07:03] right and it was a force and if you're
[1:07:07] an emotional person that probably makes
[1:07:08] you cry it's a force that has it doesn't
[1:07:12] just sit there and do nothing it has a
[1:07:14] bit yes right so if you administer true
[1:07:17] love it actually has an effect on human
[1:07:19] beings and it's powerful it can break
[1:07:22] down things you can break things down
[1:07:24] they can overcome things it overcome
[1:07:27] hate that's what the Bible says be not
[1:07:29] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[1:07:31] good overcome with love that's why the
[1:07:33] Bible says love your enemies right it's
[1:07:36] a powerful force another quote here if
[1:07:40] you love them you know love is the
[1:07:41] greatest force here we have the most
[1:07:42] powerful force do you believe that love
[1:07:44] would just do things that nothing else
[1:07:47] will do do things that nothing else will
[1:07:52] do just think about that now here's
[1:07:56] where you might think I'm going but
[1:07:57] eerie fury here right but I'm not but
[1:07:59] ultimately God's love fills the whole
[1:08:02] earth right it actually it actually
[1:08:07] feels it's it's everywhere God's love it
[1:08:11] actually fills the earth right now now
[1:08:15] the reason why I say that it's because
[1:08:18] now take this picture here right when
[1:08:21] it's all said and done when everything's
[1:08:22] over and you've got people and eternity
[1:08:25] with God and people souls in hell you
[1:08:30] tell me that you can have a heartwarming
[1:08:31] feeling in hell it's going to be void of
[1:08:35] any emotion of love right void of
[1:08:37] anything you couldn't say oh you look
[1:08:40] hurting over there is anything I could
[1:08:42] do to help you there won't be any any
[1:08:45] part of this heartwarming anything to
[1:08:48] either receive or give and
[1:08:50] it's gonna be void of that right you
[1:08:53] understand void of all love therefore if
[1:08:55] you can actually feel love here even a
[1:08:59] non believer and unbeliever you can then
[1:09:01] what is that
[1:09:01] it's got to be God it's got to be God
[1:09:04] it's just it's it's it's everywhere and
[1:09:07] it just fills the whole earth because
[1:09:11] God is actually still here working in it
[1:09:13] and if he's around he's a God of love
[1:09:16] then this this emotion of love and all
[1:09:19] different forms is going to manifest
[1:09:20] itself you understand and in heaven what
[1:09:23] it's going to be as perfect love this
[1:09:25] perfect doesn't love of goodwill and
[1:09:28] everything you measure in a place like
[1:09:29] that with it's no evil no no negativity
[1:09:31] right but but here that's why I say
[1:09:34] God's love actually fills the whole
[1:09:36] earth at the moment it's it's just here
[1:09:39] right happening and has the same it's
[1:09:42] the same as this concept as as power
[1:09:45] does through faith it's same concept you
[1:09:47] don't need to be a Christian to have
[1:09:50] faith to get something to happen even a
[1:09:52] miracle right because the Bible says if
[1:09:56] you can believe there's a concept of
[1:09:57] faith that will say if you can't believe
[1:10:00] this then this will happen and it works
[1:10:02] for anybody as power is not oh well you
[1:10:06] don't you haven't done what I say
[1:10:07] therefore I'm not going to answer your
[1:10:09] desire of faith you can be a
[1:10:12] non-christian anything I want to achieve
[1:10:13] this great thing and if you have faith
[1:10:15] enough in that you'll achieve it right
[1:10:17] that's that's just the way this thing
[1:10:19] works it just it's just here on earth
[1:10:21] that's just the principle that's here
[1:10:22] it's the same as love it's just here and
[1:10:25] we can experience it whether we're a
[1:10:27] loving person or not we can experience
[1:10:28] love a sort of funny photo and in a
[1:10:32] certain example of it it's a the photo
[1:10:35] it was a little little two-year-old kid
[1:10:37] giving a this gangster guy a toy phone
[1:10:40] and the caption said it doesn't matter
[1:10:42] how gangster you think you are if a
[1:10:44] two-year-old gives you a toy phone you
[1:10:45] answer it you know that's that's a is
[1:10:53] the little thing somewhere that just
[1:10:55] puts all this I'm a bad guy side and
[1:10:58] answers that little phone for the little
[1:10:59] guy you know it's it's still love here
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] on really this quote here you know I'm
[1:11:07] getting into unconditional love shortly
[1:11:09] and Jesus meets with men in different
[1:11:11] circles in a different numbers one time
[1:11:13] he met with 500 another time he met with
[1:11:15] 70 once with his 12 once with three and
[1:11:17] he will come to 100 sold no matter what
[1:11:20] size the circle is we how many peoples
[1:11:22] gathered Christ is omnipresent and he is
[1:11:24] the only being there IRA's that's
[1:11:26] omnipresent which means everywhere at
[1:11:29] the same time he's an omnipresent being
[1:11:31] he's everywhere at the same time the
[1:11:34] devil cannot be omnipresent God is the
[1:11:36] only one who's omnipresent it's
[1:11:38] everywhere he fills all the heavens in
[1:11:41] all the earth there's omnipresent God at
[1:11:44] this point time is everywhere and the
[1:11:46] whole earth right so incest and and you
[1:11:49] can you can embrace them or experience
[1:11:54] them in any part of the earth at any
[1:11:55] point time it's everywhere and this
[1:11:58] verse here says there's one God and
[1:12:00] Father of all who is above all and
[1:12:01] through all and in you all there's just
[1:12:03] this almighty great spirit of love and
[1:12:06] there's one of their to be just love
[1:12:08] right soaps everywhere it was they what
[1:12:16] they picture was maybe it's a little bit
[1:12:17] my mind as I don't mind the stuff but it
[1:12:22] was these these men that we were during
[1:12:24] the civil rights movement these the
[1:12:27] African Americans couldn't go on the
[1:12:29] buses so they headache to protest a
[1:12:31] group of African Americans and white
[1:12:33] people went on these buses they called
[1:12:34] them the Freedom Riders and they rode on
[1:12:36] these buses and sat in the seats in and
[1:12:39] it was just pure evil what was heading
[1:12:42] to them they would turn up into a place
[1:12:43] and mobs of these obviously what people
[1:12:45] would be in these southern towns to beat
[1:12:48] up all these guys as soon as they got
[1:12:49] off the bus there and the police would
[1:12:51] say no we give you 15 minutes to do what
[1:12:53] if you want they will turn up 15 minutes
[1:12:54] later and they would just beat these men
[1:12:56] up I'll show you right and some of them
[1:13:03] are Christians some are not but they
[1:13:04] were just fighting for a good cause this
[1:13:05] man on the man on the right I can't
[1:13:08] remember his name is the African
[1:13:10] American and the other men here's a
[1:13:12] testimony where he said when he was
[1:13:14] about to get off the bus he prayed nurse
[1:13:16] how they said Lord how
[1:13:17] me not to fight back with these people
[1:13:20] any city had a spiritual experience then
[1:13:22] unlike anything he's ever had to that
[1:13:24] point board afterwards he said he felt
[1:13:27] such an overwhelming love and peace come
[1:13:29] upon him and he just knew everything is
[1:13:31] going to be aright and he and with with
[1:13:32] this feeling he just walked off and he
[1:13:34] got beaten up and he actually got in the
[1:13:36] paper and actually what he did changed
[1:13:38] from his image being in the paper before
[1:13:40] heaven determined they began to the
[1:13:43] cycle of change for that situation but
[1:13:45] an overwhelming feeling of love and
[1:13:47] pieces he just took over him that was
[1:13:49] just
[1:13:49] God just Kaman and embrace the situation
[1:13:54] and he just could go through what he
[1:13:56] went through now but to move on so it
[1:14:00] doesn't become a lyric area we think God
[1:14:02] is just love and everything is just you
[1:14:03] know because this is the deceiving thing
[1:14:06] about this emotion of love right now we
[1:14:10] know these scriptures that God is love
[1:14:11] but then there's another scripture down
[1:14:13] the bottom of 1st John 1:5 Allah says
[1:14:14] and this is the message which we have
[1:14:16] heard of him and declare unto you God is
[1:14:18] light and in him is no darkness at all
[1:14:22] now when you think of light you think of
[1:14:25] God which is purity light holy right and
[1:14:28] when you think of darkness you think of
[1:14:30] sin and perversion and and anything that
[1:14:34] is not of God right as darkness is
[1:14:36] that's why we call it the kingdom of
[1:14:38] light the kingdom of darkness so now
[1:14:39] well then this great being as well as
[1:14:43] being a God of love he's actually also
[1:14:44] as well as being loved he's actually
[1:14:47] he's also light right and him is no
[1:14:49] darkness no sin no no no nothing now I
[1:14:54] want to know why I say that was I want
[1:14:56] to now start painting a picture so now
[1:15:01] put a balance on this emotion of love
[1:15:03] which is a genuine godly thing we
[1:15:07] experienced and I've got this picture
[1:15:08] here because I could say a situation
[1:15:10] where a let's say one girl has a friend
[1:15:17] and she knows that her friend has always
[1:15:20] wanted to get her hair done at this
[1:15:21] particular hairdresser but it's it's so
[1:15:23] expensive there and she can't afford it
[1:15:25] and her birthday is coming up and she
[1:15:27] wants to surprise her friend
[1:15:28] and so she gathers her other
[1:15:31] she says look this is what we'll do
[1:15:32] we'll well um we'll all go as a group
[1:15:35] and we'll meet her there for her
[1:15:37] birthday and we'll all put in and we'll
[1:15:39] pay for her to get the best haircut that
[1:15:41] she's ever wanted you know she can get a
[1:15:43] hit guide and this you can get a cat and
[1:15:45] get it all looking real nice and no
[1:15:47] friends say oh that's such a nice thing
[1:15:48] to do you let's do that for her right
[1:15:51] hot woman yeah let's go and and then
[1:15:57] they they they say I'll meet us for
[1:15:59] coffee summary so they're gonna surprise
[1:16:01] her and then they that sexually the
[1:16:02] coffee place is actually a they're
[1:16:04] hideous and they say surprise we've
[1:16:05] actually we're going to pay to get your
[1:16:07] haircut we know your boys wanted to get
[1:16:10] it down here and oh come on oh she's
[1:16:13] overwhelmed with what the love they
[1:16:16] showed you well that's so nice
[1:16:17] I love you all they're hugging right
[1:16:20] right now this is real love this is not
[1:16:24] this is real love but this is how Satan
[1:16:26] can start to actually use love to
[1:16:29] deceive people use this emotion to
[1:16:31] deceive people so then the next thing is
[1:16:33] she goes in there and wrapped up within
[1:16:37] that act of love it's a hair cut off
[1:16:39] which is actually an act of hate right
[1:16:42] it's darkness you know it's it's not god
[1:16:45] that's darkness and they to actually
[1:16:48] encourage it to do that hate you so so
[1:16:53] we'll then this emotion of love within
[1:16:55] this time is hate comes with it it's
[1:16:58] darkness now you can say that's not God
[1:17:00] because because in him is no darkness at
[1:17:02] all so within their situation they were
[1:17:04] portions of God if I could put it that
[1:17:06] way but it there was darkness in it so
[1:17:08] it's not fully God right so with Satan
[1:17:14] always he uses the emotion of love to
[1:17:16] deceive people because we now we think
[1:17:18] our this thing could be Christians eyes
[1:17:20] is such a good friend to me my other
[1:17:22] friend doesn't agree with all of us but
[1:17:24] look at this good time we're having here
[1:17:25] look at how loving it is and you're
[1:17:28] doing an act of hate right now here's
[1:17:31] another one for the guys you know no but
[1:17:34] he loved me but then I met the boys and
[1:17:36] the gang
[1:17:37] and they they live like now they were so
[1:17:39] good to me they booked me in in my
[1:17:41] brother's arms are any show that we
[1:17:43] family now bro and it's genuine maybe
[1:17:46] they were maybe they came from a rough
[1:17:48] time and they had a rough life and and
[1:17:50] some other men and frase then see if we
[1:17:53] look after you and it was it's a genuine
[1:17:56] actual act of love will embrace you will
[1:17:58] care for you were your family now
[1:18:00] no doubt that man would have been
[1:18:02] overwhelmed and I feel like I've got
[1:18:04] family now hear me I've never had these
[1:18:06] guys care for me and now because we love
[1:18:10] you we're going to go and here have a
[1:18:11] cigarette that's going to kill you this
[1:18:13] get drunk that's gonna you know ruin
[1:18:15] your kidneys leach there's all these
[1:18:16] things that's actually going to kill you
[1:18:18] well then this love will kill you at the
[1:18:20] same time see if they're deceiving it's
[1:18:22] using the emotion to deceive right so so
[1:18:25] this is just to keep a balance so we
[1:18:26] don't get all caught up on the see
[1:18:28] motion and then we churches use God
[1:18:33] Satan uses the same thing through
[1:18:34] churches you know just tell me if you
[1:18:37] are God loves you as you are and you can
[1:18:39] just stay as you are any way that you
[1:18:40] are now that's the truth right because
[1:18:42] God is a he's an embrace and God and he
[1:18:45] says come all you that are weary come
[1:18:47] you that are thirsty come right then
[1:18:50] it's and you feel good if someone if
[1:18:51] you're weary and someone says come I'll
[1:18:53] help you you're gonna feel good so you
[1:18:56] come but but you see they bring them in
[1:19:00] by love they use Satan uses the emotion
[1:19:03] of love to bring them in and they say
[1:19:05] all this church really embrace me and
[1:19:07] made me feel like family and they helped
[1:19:09] me I was I didn't have many things and
[1:19:12] then they came and they gave me things
[1:19:14] for my house and they just they just
[1:19:15] love me and and and I'm so happy there
[1:19:18] and at the same time the church is
[1:19:21] teaching them things that I that doesn't
[1:19:23] matter in the Word of God that doesn't
[1:19:24] matter that doesn't matter if it's okay
[1:19:25] forget about this but there's love there
[1:19:28] right it's because of such a powerful
[1:19:31] force Satan actually uses it uses that
[1:19:35] powerful force to deceive people because
[1:19:38] it's so powerful
[1:19:39] he's gonna have more luck trying to use
[1:19:41] that emotion then use the emotion of
[1:19:43] hope you're somewhat
[1:19:44] swimmers laughs let me see you heard
[1:19:45] some say I came into the truth because I
[1:19:47] said don't come we don't want you here
[1:19:48] we never want to see your face here and
[1:19:50] that really made me want to go now they
[1:19:52] use the emotion that Satan uses this
[1:19:54] emotion of love right but if there's
[1:19:57] darkness in it it's not you got to watch
[1:19:59] it it's not all it's not all right these
[1:20:05] guys here are beginning now to preach
[1:20:07] our gospel Love Wins what did I read
[1:20:11] about brother Graham says love is the
[1:20:13] most powerful force on the earth love
[1:20:15] conquers all right love always wins now
[1:20:18] the now the homosexual people are saying
[1:20:20] loved ones others most powerful force
[1:20:23] love will win and it's getting so much
[1:20:26] momentum because they've been they've
[1:20:27] tried you Satan's got this idea of love
[1:20:29] so why can't I just love whoever I want
[1:20:31] to love of ones that's what we see and
[1:20:35] yet it's so it's a perverted way because
[1:20:37] what they're saying that it should one
[1:20:38] end is sin right and now if we now
[1:20:44] oppose it we are called a hater
[1:20:46] right but but but they actually the
[1:20:54] thing they're doing is darkness so it's
[1:20:56] all it's very deceiving here to see
[1:20:59] loved ones that's the new it's a new
[1:21:01] hashtag loved ones now we could say Amen
[1:21:05] to their right because it we don't know
[1:21:07] we see this stuff and it puts you off
[1:21:09] what it you love you know you think that
[1:21:10] I just but don't let it put you off
[1:21:12] because true that there is still true
[1:21:15] love right but we for sometimes we can
[1:21:17] get so discouraged by all the stuff we
[1:21:18] see we think I'll I'll just become a bit
[1:21:20] cold don't do that stay emotional they
[1:21:23] love him stay still let love embrace you
[1:21:25] and do these things but temper it with
[1:21:28] light which is what we're gonna go to
[1:21:31] you I'll just give you one more example
[1:21:32] of us here's a here's a this man winning
[1:21:37] with a baseball bat to Robert a shop and
[1:21:41] the guy behind the counter he always
[1:21:43] carried a gun under his counter this is
[1:21:45] the miracle obviously and so he comes
[1:21:47] out with this gun and when the man
[1:21:48] realizes that the guy's got a gun he he
[1:21:51] immediately said look please don't shoot
[1:21:53] me don't shoot me I'm look I just I
[1:21:56] don't hear
[1:21:57] food I've got children that are starving
[1:21:59] I was actually coming here just to get
[1:22:00] something so I could get some food and
[1:22:02] he was this man was crying the sudden me
[1:22:04] I said please and don't tell the police
[1:22:06] because I'll just end up going through
[1:22:07] the court system I'm gonna I'll be even
[1:22:09] a worse estate to look after my family
[1:22:11] just please just let me go and this man
[1:22:14] was genuinely remorseful and he was it
[1:22:16] tears down his eyes and the shopkeeper
[1:22:19] said he must have seen the emotion of it
[1:22:22] and he said look okay I can see you
[1:22:25] you're genuine I can see you actually
[1:22:27] meant that you you weren't a bad guy
[1:22:29] coming to do harm to me you were just
[1:22:30] trying to steal something to feed
[1:22:32] yourself and feed your family nest even
[1:22:34] scripture the Bible says you know that a
[1:22:36] man won't despise a thief if he's
[1:22:38] stealing to feed his family you know but
[1:22:41] then any piece gets caught in it to pay
[1:22:42] it back but he actually won't think you
[1:22:43] know he's a bad guy if he's actually
[1:22:45] doing it for someone else that's a funny
[1:22:46] concept right and and so the man gives
[1:22:50] some $40 in a loaf of bread he sees here
[1:22:52] go and take that and I won't tell the
[1:22:53] police will do nothing nice story right
[1:22:56] now that now the man of the ground says
[1:22:59] on one other thing because you've shown
[1:23:02] me this love I want to become a Muslim
[1:23:04] just like you they said you can become
[1:23:07] Muslim you recite the one of the five
[1:23:10] pillars of a lie for cyclists there's no
[1:23:12] god but Muhammad Muhammad is the
[1:23:13] Messenger of God he recited that now I'm
[1:23:16] a Muslim and he converted to Islam
[1:23:18] through that act right yeah now and and
[1:23:24] now the Muslim community we use this and
[1:23:26] say that's what a true Muslim is he
[1:23:28] shows love and this is how we can
[1:23:29] convert people right now don't we say
[1:23:33] the same thing see see it's a it's a
[1:23:37] it's used in different forms because
[1:23:40] it's such a powerful force now I just
[1:23:46] read this again I've got this one again
[1:23:48] you know love is the greatest force we
[1:23:49] have the most powerful force do you
[1:23:50] believe that love local will just do
[1:23:53] things that nothing else will do so now
[1:23:58] here's here's a statement I want to make
[1:23:59] then I want to I want to bring another
[1:24:00] concept God's unconditional all-powerful
[1:24:05] undefeatable redeeming love as we've
[1:24:09] talked about acts of love now we get
[1:24:10] into this
[1:24:11] force of love itself the pure form of
[1:24:13] love itself that's just so powerful you
[1:24:15] you think of the power in this love the
[1:24:18] overcoming power that exists within this
[1:24:22] embodiment of perfect love itself think
[1:24:25] of how powerful that thing is we just
[1:24:27] have snippets of it here and there but
[1:24:29] here is the very center point of the
[1:24:31] thing itself my statement is it has to
[1:24:35] be specifically limited to certain ones
[1:24:37] otherwise the whole world will be saved
[1:24:40] and overcome by it right I'll show this
[1:24:45] picture here right now we say love is
[1:24:47] everywhere you know this because God is
[1:24:49] actually as it stands as existent right
[1:24:52] but there's a center point is that
[1:24:55] there's a center point of this great
[1:24:57] love that is housed somewhere right now
[1:25:01] and that's that's in the heart of God
[1:25:03] that's God right now my statement is of
[1:25:05] that if that love just flowed towards
[1:25:08] the earth unrestrained towards everybody
[1:25:12] who could possibly be lost ever how
[1:25:16] could any soul ever be lost because this
[1:25:19] is the most powerful force there is
[1:25:20] there would be no force that could
[1:25:22] combat it that was strong enough to hold
[1:25:24] back something that it was after it's
[1:25:27] the most powerful force that there is so
[1:25:29] it has to somehow be it has to be
[1:25:32] directed specifically somehow otherwise
[1:25:35] it would just be a whitewash you
[1:25:37] understand that this most this powerful
[1:25:40] thing called love when we get to the
[1:25:42] source of love itself the actual source
[1:25:45] that that fun point now here's the
[1:25:48] answer to that right now this is where
[1:25:50] unconditional love where the redeeming
[1:25:52] love of God begins to touch my heart and
[1:25:55] overwhelm me the Bible says according as
[1:25:58] he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:26:00] foundation of the world that we should
[1:26:02] be holy and without blame before them
[1:26:04] and love now I mentioned before God's
[1:26:07] love has got to be specifically directed
[1:26:10] his unconditional love not just his like
[1:26:13] we can have parts of it on the earth and
[1:26:15] we can get these good feelings and we
[1:26:16] can do all these things and now we're
[1:26:18] talking about a specific choice
[1:26:22] that my love is going to go directly to
[1:26:25] you unconditionally and it's going to
[1:26:29] keep at you right and it's a
[1:26:33] relationship who does it go really who
[1:26:36] does it go to right his children this
[1:26:42] it's it's specifically directed although
[1:26:45] he's on earth and he he's a good god and
[1:26:47] he does all these things and you can
[1:26:48] experience love in different forms the
[1:26:51] direct source of his love as for his
[1:26:53] children I don't know if this will work
[1:26:56] because I don't know who's here right
[1:26:58] but I want to just use this just look at
[1:26:59] this picture who have we got in this
[1:27:00] room I know you if you're looking at it
[1:27:06] you've seen yourself in me right because
[1:27:08] we all like ourselves right we love
[1:27:10] ourselves so you know whenever you see a
[1:27:12] picture you look through it and you look
[1:27:14] for yourself think all these me who does
[1:27:16] that be honest
[1:27:18] hey hey the Bible says no man hates
[1:27:22] their own body they love themselves you
[1:27:23] know that's what we should care for
[1:27:25] ourselves other place we would run
[1:27:26] ourselves into the ground and maybe you
[1:27:28] know maybe die but we love ourselves
[1:27:30] right now when you have a child it's
[1:27:34] like if it's kind of a similar love you
[1:27:36] you would you almost would love that
[1:27:38] child more than you love yourself so
[1:27:41] when you see a photo you'll glance over
[1:27:44] other people's children if you've got
[1:27:45] children first you look at yourself then
[1:27:47] you'll glance over other people's
[1:27:48] children and you find your own obvious
[1:27:50] my children hey if you now if you
[1:27:54] haven't got children you can just say
[1:27:55] that that's what you do for yourself if
[1:27:57] you've got children you like if I went
[1:27:58] back to here and I could sister Hannah
[1:28:00] you know we were your children in that
[1:28:01] picture you could probably tell me
[1:28:03] roughly where they would hey we were
[1:28:05] they yeah
[1:28:07] on the right thing be on the right side
[1:28:09] of the back see then and where we and we
[1:28:12] were your children but over yes these
[1:28:17] are as a as a parent there's a specific
[1:28:20] love you have for your children it'll
[1:28:23] pass over other children and your love
[1:28:26] as specific towards them right no I've
[1:28:30] been at events even to achieve its you
[1:28:32] know and I'm studying with one of the
[1:28:33] we're just sitting in a group talking in
[1:28:35] one of the sisters will say ah he's so
[1:28:37] cute we're both looking out at the same
[1:28:39] children playing out and somewhere and
[1:28:42] you say what she says look at my son
[1:28:45] look what he's doing
[1:28:46] Oh oh yes - but I'm not now I like
[1:28:51] children and that right but but I'm not
[1:28:53] specifically interested in his son you
[1:28:55] know what I mean so I'm not my eye isn't
[1:28:57] watching them maybe I'm saying oh that's
[1:28:59] all right but look what my son's doing
[1:29:01] over here
[1:29:01] hey right that's how we that's this
[1:29:06] relationship it will pass over other
[1:29:08] people but it's specific this love is
[1:29:12] specific so now now this is where we get
[1:29:16] into the this idea that the the
[1:29:21] all-powerful redeeming love of God it's
[1:29:24] got a specific channel and a conditional
[1:29:26] love in its towards this children well
[1:29:29] though it's whosoever will now these
[1:29:32] scriptures are hard to take sometimes
[1:29:33] but it's the truth of the matter romans
[1:29:35] 9 13 says as it is written Jacob have I
[1:29:38] loved but Esau have I hated Jacob as my
[1:29:41] son this was not now Paul says that when
[1:29:45] you think of it as he say what is your
[1:29:46] unrighteousness with God God for but he
[1:29:50] says on whom he led moose Elliot moose
[1:29:52] on whom he'll harden he hardens who are
[1:29:55] you to argue against God this is the way
[1:29:57] God does it if you're a son or his
[1:29:59] daughter then you are going to get
[1:30:03] unconditional love directed at you now
[1:30:05] it comes in different forms but directed
[1:30:07] at you from the day you were born even
[1:30:09] before you're born right I want to read
[1:30:12] you these scriptures just to get get it
[1:30:16] get this can a woman forget her sucking
[1:30:19] child that she should not have
[1:30:21] compassion on the son of who won the
[1:30:23] answer actually is yes it is possible
[1:30:24] for a mother sometimes they forget their
[1:30:26] child right yes they can they may forget
[1:30:30] yet well I not forget thee behold I have
[1:30:34] graven II on the palms of my hands thy
[1:30:36] walls are continually before me he's
[1:30:38] talking about his son Israel I will not
[1:30:40] forget you I'm gonna read these
[1:30:44] scriptures then I'm going to get into
[1:30:45] something then jesus answered them
[1:30:48] I told you in Berlin you believe not the
[1:30:51] works that I do my father's name they be
[1:30:53] a witness of me but you believe not
[1:30:55] because you're not of my sheep as I said
[1:30:57] unto you my sheep hear my voice and I
[1:30:59] know them and they follow me and I give
[1:31:01] unto them eternal life and they shall
[1:31:03] never perish neither shall any man pluck
[1:31:05] them out of my hand my father which gave
[1:31:08] them me is greater than all and no man
[1:31:10] is able to pluck him out of my father's
[1:31:12] hand I and my father are one
[1:31:15] now he's confident in his ability of his
[1:31:18] love to get those things that he desires
[1:31:23] right it's the most powerful force there
[1:31:25] was nothing if someone's a son of God
[1:31:27] there is nothing a predestinate a seed
[1:31:30] of God there was nothing they could ever
[1:31:32] stop God's redeeming love from getting
[1:31:36] them right but I want to show you in a
[1:31:37] little but he doesn't just go off I save
[1:31:39] you right man's got to make a free world
[1:31:42] but that's the beauty of this love how
[1:31:44] it works here's another one
[1:31:46] and this is the father as well of what
[1:31:48] she has sent me that all of which he had
[1:31:51] given me I should lose nothing but
[1:31:53] should raise it up gain at the last day
[1:31:55] yeah here they are go and get them right
[1:31:59] go and redeem them with your love and
[1:32:02] there's powerful force of love here are
[1:32:05] my children
[1:32:07] one more for I've given unto thee in the
[1:32:10] words which thou gave us me and they
[1:32:12] have received him and if non surely that
[1:32:14] I came from out from thee and they had
[1:32:17] believed that they had seen me I pray
[1:32:19] for them I pray not for the world but
[1:32:20] for them which thou has given me I pray
[1:32:22] not for the world but for them which
[1:32:24] thou has given me for they are thine and
[1:32:26] all miner thine and thine or mine and I
[1:32:29] am glorified in them I pray not for the
[1:32:32] world I just pray for the ones you've
[1:32:34] given me now to put it in a softer
[1:32:37] context I don't really care about your
[1:32:38] children it's just my children I'm
[1:32:39] interested hey
[1:32:46] now now we come back to this one and
[1:32:49] this is the message which we have heard
[1:32:50] of him and declare unto you that God is
[1:32:52] light and in him is no darkness at all I
[1:32:55] want to get this concept back in our
[1:32:57] mind and now this concept of love right
[1:33:01] this this this redeeming love because
[1:33:04] now we've got this being that's that's
[1:33:06] total right and total love pursuing us
[1:33:08] how is it going to pursue us because we
[1:33:12] talk about Paul talks about in
[1:33:13] Corinthians about love it says charity
[1:33:15] but it's love love suffers long and is
[1:33:17] kind love Envy it's not love or it's not
[1:33:19] itself is not puffed up does not behave
[1:33:21] itself unseemly seeketh not her own is
[1:33:23] not easily provoked thinks no evil
[1:33:24] rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices in
[1:33:27] the truth believes all things fearful
[1:33:29] things hopes all things endures all
[1:33:31] things
[1:33:32] so this love rejoices not an iniquity
[1:33:35] but rejoices in the truth it doesn't
[1:33:37] have an ability to ever accept iniquity
[1:33:40] it doesn't even have the ability it
[1:33:43] doesn't ever have the ability to embrace
[1:33:44] any sort of darkness right you'll see
[1:33:47] where I'm going with us right now here's
[1:33:52] a statement now the unconditional this
[1:33:55] love of God is pursuing your free will
[1:34:01] through what bring you into a into a
[1:34:03] church that's the zhibing church bring
[1:34:06] you into just have a good time somewhere
[1:34:08] now because it's full of life and truth
[1:34:10] it can only bring you until it wants to
[1:34:13] pursue your free will for you to accept
[1:34:16] Christ for your day because it knows
[1:34:18] where's the truth it's Christ as the
[1:34:20] truth and the truth of your day that
[1:34:23] Christ and your day the actual the
[1:34:26] Christ walking in your time right
[1:34:30] because in him is no darkness at all and
[1:34:33] this love is pursuing you concealing
[1:34:35] your free will it's gonna by this force
[1:34:38] of love it's gonna pursue you to bring
[1:34:42] you through the truth
[1:34:44] it's tampering you any other place to
[1:34:46] the real truth right that's why the Holy
[1:34:49] Ghost is actually truth and it's love
[1:34:51] right it's it's the it's the real thing
[1:34:55] now now I want to just
[1:34:57] think about this talk about this for a
[1:34:59] moment we talk about our freewill right
[1:35:03] we're born with the freewill okay
[1:35:06] now true love won't override your free
[1:35:11] will because it doesn't want you to do
[1:35:12] anything you don't want to do is that
[1:35:13] true if you love someone then and I have
[1:35:16] a funny thing we witnessed it was a
[1:35:18] family member that was um having a bit
[1:35:22] of a dispute with their wife right and
[1:35:26] we were we were there and they were
[1:35:28] having an argument and then we heard
[1:35:32] this voice say all angry look hold my
[1:35:35] hand and you know like in other words
[1:35:43] like heartache and an act of love
[1:35:46] towards me but do it against your will
[1:35:49] and that's the whole a joke whenever we
[1:35:51] have a fuss you know love true love
[1:35:55] won't say look if you don't I will say
[1:35:57] if you don't want to hold my hand you
[1:35:59] know I don't want you to hold my hand I
[1:36:00] only want you to hold my hand if you
[1:36:02] really want to I'm not going to make you
[1:36:04] hold my hand right that's that's this
[1:36:07] concept of love right it won't make you
[1:36:09] do anything you don't want to do as a
[1:36:12] world yeah it's like you've you know and
[1:36:14] and and this side of the equation you
[1:36:16] understand and love will actually give
[1:36:18] you all all the facts before you make a
[1:36:21] choice who's been deceived by a sneaky
[1:36:23] salesman a they they they quickly tell
[1:36:26] you what's great about this thing but
[1:36:28] they know they're not telling you the
[1:36:29] dumb things about it they know it's
[1:36:31] probably not going to suit your purpose
[1:36:32] they just want to get your money so they
[1:36:33] just they tell you it's good it's this
[1:36:35] in that year year year and then you get
[1:36:36] it and it doesn't work for what you want
[1:36:38] it to do and falls apart it's rubbish
[1:36:39] you've been deceived haven't told you
[1:36:41] all the facts right but now now this
[1:36:45] love it can't deceive you and it will
[1:36:48] actually tell you all the facts that's
[1:36:51] why when when you hear them with that
[1:36:53] the message all men of God speaking they
[1:36:56] speak you the absolute truth give you
[1:36:58] all the facts this is what you're going
[1:37:00] to be this is what you are getting
[1:37:03] involved in right and it scares most
[1:37:06] people away but it's the hundred percent
[1:37:08] facts this is the truth it's not a
[1:37:09] watered down
[1:37:11] see other churches will water down the
[1:37:12] truth to get you in not tell you all the
[1:37:16] facts and when you get under you think I
[1:37:17] didn't realize almost like that's all
[1:37:18] they say no that doesn't really matter
[1:37:19] they'll deceive you but they but true
[1:37:23] love that's why we've got it's got to
[1:37:25] come to the messenger of that time which
[1:37:26] is actually telling the truth and now
[1:37:28] it's it seems unattractive right that
[1:37:31] the gospel seems so unattractive to the
[1:37:33] unbeliever they think what could you
[1:37:34] possibly be interested in going into
[1:37:35] something like that right that's the way
[1:37:39] that this thing works but Satan will
[1:37:41] trick you into a green is something you
[1:37:43] really didn't want right that's what
[1:37:44] hate does it will deceive you okay now
[1:37:47] now the reason why I said that was
[1:37:50] because God pursues that let me go this
[1:37:53] first right firstly you've got this
[1:37:56] you've got a you've got God you've got
[1:38:00] this love that that wanted to come out
[1:38:03] and redeem somehow right when man was
[1:38:07] lost this love you think about it it was
[1:38:10] sitting there and it wanted to actually
[1:38:12] come out and it knew that the only way
[1:38:16] that it could actually come out as by as
[1:38:19] by God knew here to become one of us
[1:38:21] take our sins in order for that love to
[1:38:23] be expressed to us I'm gonna go into
[1:38:26] this one yeah this is what I'm gonna get
[1:38:27] to because this is this is what I was
[1:38:29] talking about before right
[1:38:30] let's talk about free will right free
[1:38:33] will and free will and and God's hewing
[1:38:39] love for you yeah we're all different
[1:38:41] right you're all different everyone's
[1:38:44] made different now I'm gonna put it this
[1:38:45] way before you're born God studies you
[1:38:53] think about this he studies you before
[1:38:56] you're born who is he st. let's say you
[1:38:59] can do this say you've been just
[1:39:00] conceived right the hennas being
[1:39:03] conceived now now God gets word no I'm
[1:39:08] gonna dramatize it slightly God gets
[1:39:10] word that one of his children has been
[1:39:15] conceived this may be a an alarm goes
[1:39:17] off someone gives God a message there's
[1:39:20] someone on their way right someone's on
[1:39:24] their way
[1:39:25] now I put this picture up here because
[1:39:28] it shows a builder studying maybe
[1:39:29] studying a job before he starts he wants
[1:39:31] to learn the facts what am i building
[1:39:34] what am i making here right now God
[1:39:38] study is sister henna ok he won't even
[1:39:42] ask
[1:39:44] boy or girl knows that any word on what
[1:39:52] they're thinking about calling her you
[1:39:53] ever decided you okay now let's see how
[1:39:59] she's made I want all the data on her
[1:40:01] own all the information whose appearance
[1:40:05] okay who's your grandparents who's their
[1:40:08] great-great grandparents what components
[1:40:10] of mankind have gone into here to form
[1:40:15] the way that her mind works and to form
[1:40:18] how her free will operates what are all
[1:40:21] the different components of it how does
[1:40:22] she what will she respond to see that's
[1:40:27] the way now love according to exactly
[1:40:32] how she is this love from the day she's
[1:40:34] born will begin pursuing her and
[1:40:37] different ilk for you brother Eden
[1:40:39] different way of us uses the henna right
[1:40:42] but it's studied here
[1:40:43] studied brother yet it's study sister
[1:40:45] Shannon on because it what it knows
[1:40:48] you've got a free will and it's not
[1:40:51] going to make you make up your mind but
[1:40:53] it's going to pursue your free will and
[1:40:55] do all sorts of things within
[1:40:56] circumstances who eventually get you to
[1:41:00] surrender your free will you understand
[1:41:04] that it's going to one and it's just
[1:41:07] suit against you but it's not going to
[1:41:08] make you make a choice it's not going to
[1:41:10] but it knows sister Hannah's mind works
[1:41:12] like this therefore I'll fight bring her
[1:41:15] if she has these situations happen in
[1:41:18] her life this will start to change here
[1:41:19] that cool I know how she works in God
[1:41:21] sis great masterbuilder he will begin to
[1:41:24] know there may be things that he knows
[1:41:26] if that happens that here it will be
[1:41:27] really bad so he'll stop it but he might
[1:41:29] think that person needs this bad thing
[1:41:32] to happen to them because their mind
[1:41:33] works this way that it's only through
[1:41:35] that that eventually later on down the
[1:41:37] line I can get
[1:41:38] and here with us he's pursuing your free
[1:41:43] will who won't accept him well that's
[1:41:47] that's that's the unconditional love
[1:41:49] that he has towards those children
[1:41:50] because you at some point in your life
[1:41:51] have to say Lord I surrender
[1:41:53] you understand you you can't just get
[1:41:56] saved we're not surrendering but you
[1:41:59] have to make their choice yourself but
[1:42:00] it's this unconditional pursuing love
[1:42:03] for you that's working specifically in
[1:42:06] your life before you were born you
[1:42:09] understand this has to be the way that
[1:42:12] it works and and now we think we do that
[1:42:17] and then and then when sister Hannah
[1:42:19] makes that choice whatever situation it
[1:42:21] was it says but as many as received him
[1:42:24] to them he gave power to become the sons
[1:42:25] or daughters of God even then they
[1:42:27] believed on his name she this this love
[1:42:31] regardless of what any ever did
[1:42:34] you might have pushed it away done all
[1:42:35] the stuff but it's it's it's never gives
[1:42:38] up it's always pursuing it will never
[1:42:42] ever stop and say oh I give up that
[1:42:43] one's too hard it will never ever ever
[1:42:45] do that it will always pursue and will
[1:42:49] always win
[1:42:49] what does children but now now you get
[1:42:54] to another another thing about this
[1:42:57] unconditional love towards you as if you
[1:43:00] get to a point where you surrender you
[1:43:02] say Lord I surrender my well because
[1:43:03] that's what we want to do right we sweet
[1:43:05] lord I surrender my will to you and I
[1:43:09] surrender to the crisis of my day I
[1:43:10] surrender all okay and you've been given
[1:43:13] all the facts your but but God has
[1:43:15] worked in your life and whichever way
[1:43:18] whatever situation to bring you to that
[1:43:21] place it was God drawing you it wasn't
[1:43:24] you like I one day I decided it was God
[1:43:27] working hard sometimes for 30 40 years
[1:43:32] working working working he never stops
[1:43:34] working
[1:43:35] doesn't from from the day you are
[1:43:38] conceived he starts working
[1:43:39] you're his job I'm gonna work and he's
[1:43:43] not lazy he's diligent
[1:43:45] how does she work Carnegie knew who her
[1:43:47] parents are they going to cause a lot of
[1:43:48] trouble not trouble
[1:43:50] we're friends all we need
[1:43:51] just but he's counteracting every
[1:43:53] situation from Satan he's just doing it
[1:43:55] all to get you but then when you get to
[1:43:57] a place where you where you at Rousseau
[1:44:00] daughter of God surrender to the Christ
[1:44:01] for your day right you surrender your
[1:44:04] will now now you've got a different way
[1:44:09] that this love is predicted to you now
[1:44:11] because you say because God says I came
[1:44:13] now that you have surrendered your will
[1:44:15] by your own choice
[1:44:16] now I'll override your will right
[1:44:20] he won't override your will before
[1:44:23] you've surrendered your will he won't
[1:44:24] say well even though you don't want to
[1:44:25] come I'm gonna make you come come now
[1:44:27] right when you surrender your will he
[1:44:32] will actually now override your will
[1:44:34] right because that's this is now a
[1:44:36] continuation of perfect love towards you
[1:44:39] and now this is where we get into our
[1:44:43] walk where it becomes now training where
[1:44:45] it becomes you know we do something
[1:44:47] wrong we get chastised yeah it's not my
[1:44:51] will that God put this on my life and
[1:44:52] make my life miserable for a short
[1:44:54] amount of time
[1:44:54] that's not my will but but God knows
[1:44:58] even though you don't want this I'm
[1:45:00] going to do it to you because it's going
[1:45:01] to be better for you right that's now
[1:45:04] that's now unconditional love working in
[1:45:06] our life it's you know we heard a
[1:45:09] chastisement this is it never stops
[1:45:12] working on us and it begins to put us
[1:45:17] through situations in our life there
[1:45:19] actually we don't want to go through its
[1:45:21] seemingly unfair to us or hard on us you
[1:45:24] know because we think I really don't
[1:45:25] want to go through this but God says no
[1:45:28] because I love you I know this is better
[1:45:31] for you and I own you and because you've
[1:45:34] told me that I can override your will
[1:45:36] because you've surrendered it then I'm
[1:45:38] going to put you through this because I
[1:45:39] know it's been a few even though you at
[1:45:41] the time don't feel good about this
[1:45:42] whole thing
[1:45:42] you may even question why I'm doing it
[1:45:44] but I'm going to endure that because I
[1:45:46] know it's better for you and I've got to
[1:45:47] put you through this you've been to
[1:45:48] situations where you say lord I can't
[1:45:50] take this anymore
[1:45:50] God might think now you can take this
[1:45:52] this is only twenty five percent of what
[1:45:54] you can take you can take this for
[1:45:55] another seventy five percent and even
[1:45:58] though you think you can't I know you
[1:46:00] can and even though you might say God
[1:46:03] take this away I'm not going to take
[1:46:05] because I might the same love that I did
[1:46:08] to pursue you to pursue your will is now
[1:46:10] the same love that's gonna change and
[1:46:12] mold and make you and make you grown and
[1:46:14] bring you into the sketch of a perfect
[1:46:16] man the same love is going to do it
[1:46:17] because you've said that I can that's
[1:46:19] that's the way this this unconditional
[1:46:22] love works towards us it's more than
[1:46:25] just a good feeling it's actually a true
[1:46:28] true love for us I've just got these
[1:46:31] ones he talks about temptations you know
[1:46:33] when we go through things you need us go
[1:46:35] through things this way no I'll let you
[1:46:38] go through right and it's its purpose
[1:46:42] the purpose of this is to bring us into
[1:46:47] a place of of a sinless life right here
[1:46:49] if things were doing wrong he wants to
[1:46:51] get those out because we've seen you can
[1:46:53] the purpose of this love is to is to
[1:46:55] mold and make us the purpose of
[1:46:57] chastisement is to stop us from going
[1:46:59] this way and go this way the purpose of
[1:47:02] testings us maybe there's a wrong
[1:47:04] attitude in us and he says right I've
[1:47:06] got to put you through this to get rid
[1:47:08] of that attitude it might be four years
[1:47:09] and it might break us down but I love
[1:47:12] you it's unconditional love towards you
[1:47:14] it's a continuation of unconditional
[1:47:15] love towards you that in spite of your
[1:47:18] world I'm going to do whatever I want to
[1:47:19] do in your life because I love you and
[1:47:21] you've entrusted me you've entrusted to
[1:47:24] me with that to you give see God mold
[1:47:26] and shape me you've entrusted that's
[1:47:28] mean I'm not going to let you down right
[1:47:31] so I'm gonna do what's right for you
[1:47:32] even if you don't want it now this is
[1:47:36] why Paul says not as though I had
[1:47:37] already attained either we're already
[1:47:39] perfect perfect but I follow after that
[1:47:41] if then I may agree him that for which
[1:47:43] also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[1:47:48] you understand what that means
[1:47:50] now what truly apprehended us was
[1:47:54] actually this great love apprehended us
[1:47:57] right that's what it pretended us now
[1:48:00] that's Christ but that's love it it
[1:48:03] consistently fought for us till it got
[1:48:06] us and apprehended us now Paul saying
[1:48:09] that thing I want to pretend that thing
[1:48:11] that I pretended me see and that's our
[1:48:15] as believers we want to every
[1:48:17] in Christ which is proof we want to take
[1:48:19] on this whole thing right when we accept
[1:48:23] Christ for our day I'm almost done I've
[1:48:24] got two more slides we accept the Holy
[1:48:26] Ghost which is perfect and unconditional
[1:48:28] love
[1:48:29] now this is this is now we say God is
[1:48:32] love and God is lighter that comes into
[1:48:34] us then that's exactly what we've got in
[1:48:36] our heart right that's what that's what
[1:48:39] we have by this shall all men know that
[1:48:42] ye are my disciples if you have love one
[1:48:44] for the other I've got the scripture
[1:48:47] here I want to read and then I've got
[1:48:48] one more slide after that I know it's
[1:48:51] serious our quote from brother Brennan I
[1:48:56] am more convinced than ever in my life
[1:48:59] that it will take perfect love to enter
[1:49:01] their place this has been brother
[1:49:02] Brennan went beyond the curtain of time
[1:49:03] it was no jealousy no tiredness no
[1:49:05] sickness no old age no death only
[1:49:08] supreme beauty and joy whatever you do
[1:49:11] lay aside everything else until you get
[1:49:13] perfect love it to where you can love
[1:49:15] everybody even the enemy no matter if
[1:49:17] the plane is rocking the Lightning is
[1:49:19] flashing or the guns of the enemy are
[1:49:21] upon you these things do not matter
[1:49:23] perfect love now I'm going to close this
[1:49:29] brother Bell says I only saw perfect
[1:49:32] love there now don't forget we were
[1:49:34] pursued by perfect love and this perfect
[1:49:36] love every ended us now that's what we
[1:49:39] want to every end right this perfect
[1:49:42] perfect love now I have to make a
[1:49:45] statement then in light of this
[1:49:47] unconditional love towards God's
[1:49:49] children that if only perfect love can
[1:49:51] enter being God and as unconditional
[1:49:53] love towards us will continue to bring
[1:49:57] us to a place of perfect love he has -
[1:50:01] yes - and whether you go through this
[1:50:05] one life will that it's all for this
[1:50:07] purpose through that the love of God
[1:50:10] might be fully manifested in our hearts
[1:50:13] and then we would become a people filled
[1:50:15] with perfect love because that's what's
[1:50:17] redeemed us we might have pretend that
[1:50:19] thing which I met we ended off there's
[1:50:22] perfect love
[1:50:22] I don't know if this consequent goes a
[1:50:27] different way than just feelings and yet
[1:50:29] when you break down
[1:50:31] the love of God it's specific
[1:50:34] conditional for his unconditional love
[1:50:37] is conditional for his children right
[1:50:39] and if you're a recipient of it that's
[1:50:41] the most powerful force on earth and it
[1:50:44] will overtake you and then it will be so
[1:50:47] faithful to you that it will actually
[1:50:48] mold and make you and shape you into
[1:50:51] what it knows you should be in spite of
[1:50:54] you because it and regardless of what
[1:50:57] you do it loves you so much that it's
[1:50:59] just going to going to bring you up
[1:51:02] that's why the song we sing at the end
[1:51:05] was putting for the occasion grace grace
[1:51:08] God's grace when you look at it like
[1:51:10] this you realize it's actually God's
[1:51:12] grace that's been pursuing me from
[1:51:14] before I was born
[1:51:15] if I'm anything is because of his grace
[1:51:17] it's not because I suddenly was good guy
[1:51:20] it's by His grace and a fireman has
[1:51:25] graced in his his unmerited
[1:51:27] unconditional love as towards me and
[1:51:30] it's not going to stop us because none
[1:51:34] of his children are going to be lost and
[1:51:37] that's the if you believe it receive it
[1:51:42] right people walk it you know
[1:51:46] predestination I receive it
[1:51:48] Lord have that's the case then how could
[1:51:51] I possibly even be lost how could this
[1:51:53] love they're so powerful to be happy to
[1:51:55] how could I possibly ever be lost it's
[1:51:58] um this standest warning we're just pray
[1:52:00] anymore sing sing a song or two let's
[1:52:04] ask the musicians to come as
