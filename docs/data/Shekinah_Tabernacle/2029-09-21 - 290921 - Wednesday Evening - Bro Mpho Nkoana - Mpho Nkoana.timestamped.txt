[37:07] let's pray again father father god we
[37:09] thank you for the reading of your word
[37:12] father anyone can open
[37:14] the bible
[37:16] and even read it
[37:18] but father were taught that it takes you
[37:20] to interpret your weight low
[37:22] and we believe that the interpretation
[37:24] of your weight father is when your
[37:26] weight comes into manifestation when
[37:29] your weight leaves the one that you
[37:31] spoke when it comes to live in the lives
[37:34] of your children that is the
[37:36] interpretation and that is the
[37:37] fulfillment of your weight father i pray
[37:39] therefore that you bless this word as we
[37:42] read it to our hearts may you pour your
[37:45] spirit your presence in the heart the
[37:48] eyes the ears the mind
[37:50] and the body of each and every one of
[37:52] your children they have come from
[37:53] different directions lord with different
[37:56] needs
[37:57] with different testimonies with
[37:59] different requests with different trials
[38:02] with different test temptations and i
[38:05] pray dear father that may you be the one
[38:07] who is the center post of each and every
[38:10] one of their knees i pray my father as
[38:12] we commit the service into your hands
[38:15] asking for thy grace and for that mercy
[38:18] these things will ask in the wonderful
[38:20] name of our lord jesus christ amen
[38:23] you may enjoy the comfort of your sins
[38:25] and
[38:26] as we
[38:27] start
[38:29] um
[38:30] god bless you richly so
[38:33] i somewhat not don't know where to start
[38:35] but uh
[38:36] i would like to start a little bit just
[38:39] with that image there
[38:42] that image that we are looking our title
[38:44] tonight
[38:45] will be
[38:46] will you marry me ask the lord amen
[38:49] the lord is asking will you marry me
[38:52] you know that question is a very
[38:54] important question
[38:56] because each and every young girl each
[38:59] and every young lady
[39:01] throughout all her life
[39:03] as far as i know they look forward to
[39:05] that isn't it
[39:06] ah my girl tell it
[39:10] i always
[39:11] confuse her sister in her
[39:14] tiana
[39:16] isn't it
[39:17] i hope little is also watching there
[39:20] there at the snow isn't it so sister
[39:22] elizabeth yeah every young girl
[39:25] looks forward to that question in her
[39:27] life once upon a time
[39:29] and every young man
[39:31] look forward
[39:32] to express that question isn't it
[39:35] brother marion brother ben that is true
[39:37] isn't it
[39:38] each and every young man
[39:40] look forward to ask that question one
[39:42] day
[39:44] the reason is that it is a very
[39:46] important question
[39:47] and that is the question tonight which i
[39:50] need you to flip it a bit more away from
[39:53] the kernel side to the spiritual side
[39:57] because that is the question that the
[39:58] lord asked you
[40:01] will you marry me
[40:03] he asked
[40:05] you know what your answer was i know
[40:06] what your answer was you know what did
[40:08] you say you said yes i do i will that's
[40:13] what you said
[40:14] am i right is there anyone who did not
[40:16] say so
[40:17] anyone who did not say yes i do
[40:20] come on
[40:24] you may be shy to express it by raising
[40:26] of your hand
[40:27] but the fact of the matter is this you
[40:30] said yes i do
[40:32] that's what you said to the to that
[40:34] question and that's what we are going to
[40:36] talk about tonight because as our
[40:39] subject as our supportive statement
[40:41] below there says his love showing daily
[40:44] in her life
[40:46] when
[40:47] from the day that she said yes i do
[40:50] now she
[40:52] changes everything about her changes
[40:56] she becomes a new person
[40:59] all right that's the context that i want
[41:01] us to take looking more at what happens
[41:05] after will you marry me
[41:07] what actually happens because
[41:10] there is before will you marry me
[41:12] and after will you marry me something
[41:14] happened there that changed
[41:17] the life of this young woman
[41:19] and this is the one that i'm talking to
[41:22] this woman who's standing in front of me
[41:25] that's the one i'm talking to because
[41:28] paul says i have espoused you
[41:30] you are the bride right even so in the
[41:33] book of revelation he says we are the
[41:36] bride he's our husband
[41:38] right and we are the bride we are
[41:40] singing a song
[41:42] that we are going
[41:43] for a meeting in the sky
[41:46] but that meeting the preparations of
[41:48] that meeting begins where
[41:51] after will you marry me after you said
[41:53] yes it starts here i have never heard of
[41:57] a girl who start to prepare a wedding
[42:00] two days three days one week before she
[42:03] gets married i've never had
[42:07] right so let's just continue that's a
[42:09] beautiful picture and you see
[42:12] you see
[42:13] you see
[42:14] that one that's the sim is the most
[42:16] beautiful thing
[42:17] that a young woman will ever receive
[42:20] you know
[42:21] one of my children showed me something
[42:24] about
[42:27] this finger
[42:29] this one is a very special finger
[42:33] in both hands you can try
[42:35] this exercise and you will see how it
[42:37] works you can raise up this one
[42:41] you can raise up this one
[42:43] you can raise up this one
[42:45] you can raise up this one but that one
[42:49] how did it work era i forgot
[42:52] that you know that there was a place
[42:55] where you couldn't raise this one what
[42:57] did they say
[43:00] i forgot the exercise but
[43:02] it was time to demonstrate
[43:06] whatever the head is doing
[43:08] after service go to brother a
[43:12] he's going to demonstrate what i want to
[43:13] tell you now
[43:16] demonstrating the weakness of that
[43:18] finger
[43:19] that that finger cannot function by
[43:22] itself that finger
[43:24] it cannot function by itself that's the
[43:26] fingering it can't function it's weak it
[43:29] needs to function with another finger
[43:31] right
[43:32] we without christ we are
[43:35] us
[43:36] that is why he put that golden ring on
[43:41] our finger
[43:42] after we have agreed i want us to
[43:44] proceed with our lesson and i'll try my
[43:46] best not to be long
[43:48] will you marry me you can see her she's
[43:51] wearing a gown
[43:53] is the word bright
[43:55] that did not take place
[43:58] a week or two before
[44:00] from the day that she agreed she started
[44:03] to prepare because she became a new
[44:05] person are we together
[44:08] now i just want to read for you before
[44:11] we we continue
[44:13] brother branham in that message of the
[44:15] invisible union of the bride and of
[44:17] christ
[44:18] he says the illustration here
[44:21] where
[44:22] here
[44:23] right
[44:24] i'm the one who's referring to that one
[44:26] but that illustration here showing the
[44:28] relationship of bride
[44:31] to christ the elect lady
[44:35] and how she was to be brought to him
[44:39] where she will come from and how that
[44:42] should be brought to him the church here
[44:45] in illustration that we go in view is
[44:48] illustration by a woman
[44:50] which
[44:51] a woman is always a type of the church
[44:55] because the church is considered a bride
[44:59] a bride she is the bride of the lord
[45:02] jesus the son of god
[45:05] that is who you are
[45:07] paul
[45:08] all across the bible he speaks about the
[45:10] love of christ to his bride from genesis
[45:14] to revelation that is about it so
[45:17] brother brendan is trying to tell us
[45:18] there just as if as a foundation
[45:21] he was you know he was trying to show
[45:23] who we are to christ right
[45:26] columbrite
[45:28] shalom right
[45:30] now
[45:32] we have read that scripture i want us to
[45:34] read matthew 25 i would like everyone
[45:37] just to be comfortable relaxed
[45:40] and then don't focus on me the minister
[45:43] just focus on the word because it is him
[45:47] who said will you marry me to you
[45:49] i'm just conveying and reminding you
[45:52] and refreshing
[45:53] your hearts and your minds of what you
[45:56] said
[45:58] right
[45:59] let's read matthew 25
[46:01] 1-10
[46:03] the bible says
[46:06] then shall the kingdom of heaven be like
[46:08] an end to 10 visions we know the story
[46:10] right
[46:11] and then
[46:12] which took their lambs and went forth to
[46:15] meet at the bridegroom
[46:17] there's two and five of them were wise
[46:19] and five were foolish
[46:22] they that were foolish took their lamps
[46:24] and took no oil with them
[46:26] the foolish ones they took their lamps
[46:30] right
[46:31] while the bridegroom turret they all
[46:33] slumbered and slept
[46:37] i've underlined limbs and i've
[46:39] underlined
[46:40] slept in my about i don't know why
[46:42] and at midnight
[46:44] there was a cry made behold the
[46:46] bridegroom coming goi out to meet him
[46:50] then all those visions all of them
[46:53] arose
[46:55] and trimmed their limbs
[46:57] and the foolish
[46:59] said unto the wise give us your oil for
[47:02] our lambs are gone out
[47:05] why
[47:07] why are they asking such a question
[47:10] you can already see that the foolish
[47:12] ones went in there at unprepared
[47:15] they did not prepare what they were
[47:17] supposed but they said i do
[47:20] are you together they said i do
[47:23] they they took long months and months
[47:26] probably preparing their gowns
[47:29] you know a wedding is a project you know
[47:32] you know
[47:33] sister sister
[47:36] sister priscilla you do decorations
[47:38] right you know probably you have some
[47:40] experience of how on the day of the
[47:42] wedding we decorate
[47:44] many of you here who are married you
[47:46] have been bryce before it take it's a
[47:47] big project arrangements
[47:50] everything
[47:51] but the main focus on the day of the
[47:54] wedding we are looking at the bride
[47:56] that's where our focus is
[47:58] we are looking we are we are not much
[47:59] looking at the man he can wear a suit
[48:02] like me today that is not meshing with
[48:04] the pants but the bright that's where
[48:07] the center of attraction is
[48:09] right
[48:11] now
[48:12] let's just read those last
[48:13] two verses
[48:15] but the wise answered saying not so
[48:19] left there be not enough for us and you
[48:22] but go ye
[48:24] there
[48:25] uh sorry but go eat them to be um but go
[48:29] either rather to them that sell
[48:32] and buy for yourselves
[48:35] right
[48:36] and while they went to buy the bread
[48:39] room came
[48:40] and they that were ready they that way
[48:43] let's say ready
[48:45] went in
[48:47] with him
[48:48] to the marriage
[48:50] the door was shot
[48:53] you see so
[48:54] the story
[48:56] of
[48:56] of of these girls
[48:59] five wives five foolish it goes deeper
[49:02] to the point where you if you just
[49:04] practicalize it you'll realize that they
[49:06] took a long time preparing for this
[49:09] medium of the bread groom i would
[49:11] imagine that each and everyone went and
[49:13] bought a special pair of shoes each and
[49:16] everyone wants when to buy a perfume
[49:19] each and every one of them went to
[49:20] prepare their hair
[49:22] they prepared everything
[49:25] they prepared they bought new new lamps
[49:28] hopefully and they came with everything
[49:33] within them
[49:35] and the day arrived that they were
[49:37] supposed to go and hurry and wait for
[49:40] the bridegroom the only thing that they
[49:42] did not do they did not take the oil
[49:47] they were coming to service
[49:50] every day
[49:51] they were coming for for a long time
[49:54] probably for all their lifetime they
[49:56] were coming to church
[49:58] they were born in the house where my
[50:01] father and the mother are message
[50:02] believers they were born
[50:04] they had the message and the message
[50:06] brought them and they were pulled by the
[50:08] first pool
[50:09] they were pulled by the second pool they
[50:11] came in
[50:14] i'm not talking about
[50:16] those girls
[50:17] the the ones not of the ten those that
[50:20] did not even respond to the invitation
[50:22] no i'm not talking about those ones i'm
[50:24] talking about the ones that came in
[50:26] but the problem the difference with
[50:28] these two they were foolish these ones
[50:30] were wise the only distinctive feature
[50:33] that we see why they were foolish
[50:34] because they did not bring the oil
[50:36] right
[50:38] so they prepared
[50:39] everything
[50:42] right
[50:42] now let let's take this old story that
[50:45] you all know of a girl
[50:48] in the land afar off
[50:50] can you see it a girl in a land after of
[50:52] living in a family where
[50:55] she's actually an orphan he's living
[50:56] with her aunt and her aunt has got
[50:58] daughters also you know this little girl
[51:01] she does not have parents she was just
[51:03] adopted and she came and she's living
[51:05] with this family now now she's being
[51:07] abused she's being given hot jobs she's
[51:09] doing all the chores alone she's a talk
[51:12] she's a laugh because she does not have
[51:14] nice dresses like them she's titted like
[51:17] an outcast
[51:19] simply because she is an orphan
[51:22] their rights are more higher and nicer
[51:24] and important than hairs she's less of a
[51:27] human being than them huh
[51:29] them they are important i read a book
[51:31] called animal farm
[51:34] many years ago
[51:35] you know
[51:36] so but let's let's not go there that's
[51:38] not where we are i was just thinking
[51:39] about when those boxer and and those
[51:42] pigs said you know no no no no no no it
[51:45] looks like oh we are not all equally
[51:47] here and they made a resolution that all
[51:50] animals are equal
[51:51] no anyone why it seems like all other
[51:54] animals are more equal than others
[51:56] so that lady was not really equal with
[51:58] those girls in that house that is why
[52:00] she was treated like that
[52:02] but she was working and she was working
[52:05] and one day a priest a prince came to
[52:08] that village
[52:10] and that man came and then he he came
[52:13] and to see you know the village and then
[52:15] he saw the chief there and visiting and
[52:18] and then and
[52:19] because that that village was part of
[52:21] his kingdom and then uh he was coming
[52:24] also to look for a wife at the same time
[52:27] and when he was there the girls prepared
[52:30] they did exactly like the 10 visions
[52:33] right they prepared and then they went
[52:35] to the ball
[52:37] they went there to to
[52:39] to express their interest
[52:42] when you go on the website of
[52:43] immigration they say there's expression
[52:44] of interest they want to express their
[52:47] interest
[52:48] so that the king can hopefully the chief
[52:50] the prince can choose them
[52:53] and they did all they were supposed to
[52:55] do each and everyone walking passing
[52:58] passing passing but the prince never
[53:00] chose one of them
[53:01] the prince got bored in state it was
[53:03] blossom
[53:04] because of the mannerism so he took a
[53:07] walk he just took a walk
[53:09] he said to his body guys no no i'll just
[53:11] take your walk alone he took a walk and
[53:13] went on the outskirts of the village and
[53:14] he was just walking taking a walk
[53:16] thinking where is he going to get this
[53:18] virtuous woman that he's looking for and
[53:20] then as he was walking then he
[53:22] he was caught up in the eye by a girl
[53:24] who was just throwing water you know in
[53:26] a basin you know you know in my country
[53:28] in the rural areas we don't have running
[53:30] water like where you wake up water just
[53:32] come up from the trap no we put water in
[53:34] the basement we wash dishes then we go
[53:36] through it outside so he was just
[53:38] throwing water dirty water from the
[53:40] dishes wearing an a wreck and an apron
[53:43] that is torn and little dirty and then
[53:45] he he looked at there
[53:47] and then when he saw it he saw a
[53:49] character
[53:50] when he saw he saw he he connected with
[53:53] this girl when he saw her she's here
[53:56] while all other girls are there didn't
[53:57] she know that i'm coming in this village
[54:00] what was wrong with you with her
[54:02] then and then he greeted her then she
[54:04] was shy she didn't want to talk he said
[54:06] hi hi i cannot just have just a word
[54:07] with you then he started to talk to her
[54:10] to engage her and talk and talk to her
[54:12] and then she started to fall in love
[54:14] with him but she knew that she is
[54:17] unworthy if her auntie can just come
[54:19] from that corner there in her mercedes
[54:22] she'll run so the prince said you know i
[54:25] love you
[54:26] and the prince proposed to her and the
[54:29] priest the prince asked her that
[54:31] question will you marry me
[54:33] is that me
[54:34] say yes i love you
[54:38] please and the principal probably did
[54:41] this and said please
[54:43] you know everybody's at the ball they're
[54:45] drinking they think maybe the prince has
[54:47] just gone to the bathroom or just one
[54:49] you know they're waiting to do for the
[54:50] second round of the of the passing
[54:52] before the prince
[54:54] then he says he said it would be my
[54:56] privilege i will
[54:58] but you know in here she said she just
[55:00] thought
[55:01] is this a dream or what
[55:04] he said he said to her listen i want to
[55:06] give you something i'm going to come
[55:08] back in one year from now one year
[55:12] i'm gonna come back to fetch you
[55:14] and i want you to be ready
[55:16] on that day
[55:17] on such and such a day i'm going to come
[55:19] and you must be ready
[55:22] only her she knew only her had the
[55:25] revelation of what the priest the prince
[55:28] said omg it was only revealed to her
[55:32] only her she knew she couldn't talk
[55:35] anybody to convince them
[55:37] because they wouldn't believe it
[55:39] that that word
[55:40] was her only sustenance
[55:43] and that very same way it was
[55:45] something that destroys them that did
[55:48] not get the revelation
[55:50] you see
[55:51] so she told them the friends she told
[55:53] them but they couldn't believe it they
[55:55] ridiculed her they just mocked her and
[55:58] but she knew that the more they do that
[56:00] is because she know that me i have seen
[56:03] the prince
[56:05] so
[56:06] one day he came to fetch it you know the
[56:08] rest of the story but the moral of the
[56:10] story is that from the day that the
[56:13] prince spoke to him from that day she
[56:16] was a different girl
[56:18] from she moved from being a slave
[56:20] she moved from being a nanny she moved
[56:23] from being a dishwasher in her heart
[56:26] she was continuing to watch dishes she
[56:28] was continuing to wear the rest but from
[56:31] that day she was normal
[56:33] from that day she was normal they could
[56:35] give her more work
[56:37] that would be a joy for her because the
[56:39] more they give her the work
[56:41] the more in her she says i'm your queen
[56:43] by the way
[56:45] i
[56:46] i'm going to be the one that i'm going
[56:48] to be giving instructions
[56:50] all those troubles what were they doing
[56:52] to him they were propelling him they
[56:54] were exciting that is why the bible says
[56:57] count it all joy
[57:00] when all these things fall unto you
[57:02] because those things should remind you
[57:05] a christian should not be someone who is
[57:07] brought down and down and down every day
[57:10] the enemy come when the enemy come it's
[57:13] an opportunity to say my you are doing
[57:17] that because you don't know that i am
[57:19] the queen
[57:20] ah you don't have the revelation because
[57:23] the prince never came and spoke to you
[57:26] the prince of peace
[57:28] you see so so so the issue is that from
[57:30] that day she changed she started to
[57:33] prepare
[57:34] every single day her life now surrounded
[57:38] her life everything around her life was
[57:41] about what the prince said
[57:44] every single day i'm sure 99 of her
[57:47] thoughts 98 of everything she was doing
[57:51] it was about what the prince says she
[57:54] will just sit down and just start
[57:55] talking to herself
[57:57] listen here my dear i'm coming in one
[57:59] year he will just repeat those words
[58:02] every day just repeating them
[58:04] they thought he's mad he starts
[58:06] repeating this thing every day she's
[58:09] saying why because she had the prince
[58:11] speaking
[58:12] that my dad my dear one be ready i'm
[58:15] coming to fetch well you know what she
[58:17] did everything in her power
[58:19] she went extra she went and grabbed
[58:22] everything to to prepare to get a dress
[58:25] to get a dress to prepare everything
[58:28] to get ready it was the theme of her
[58:31] daily life
[58:33] after that revelation that way was given
[58:37] to her the word of promise that will you
[58:40] marry me
[58:42] and she agreed from that time she
[58:44] changed
[58:45] now the question that i want to ask you
[58:48] is that uh
[58:50] what does she do daily in preparation
[58:53] for this big day
[58:55] what does she do
[58:58] he's busy preparing for the coming back
[59:01] of the
[59:02] prince she's not worried anymore about
[59:06] her future here in her aunt's house
[59:08] she's not worried anymore about what's
[59:11] going to happen to her
[59:13] she's not worried about their beautiful
[59:15] dresses she's not worried about
[59:18] everything
[59:19] around him
[59:20] anymore
[59:22] right
[59:23] now listen to the korean things for i am
[59:26] jealous
[59:28] i'm jealous over you with godly jealousy
[59:31] for i have espoused you to to one
[59:34] husband that i may present you as a as a
[59:38] chaste vision of christ did you hear
[59:41] that you are being espoused
[59:45] matthew but he he answered and said
[59:48] it is written
[59:49] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[59:53] every word that proceedeth out of the
[59:55] mouth of god you see that that that lady
[59:58] each and every day
[1:00:01] the sustenance of her life all her
[1:00:04] problems you can think of her history
[1:00:07] and how her sufferings were but only one
[1:00:10] word
[1:00:11] i'm coming back for you i promise that
[1:00:13] is what was keeping her every day
[1:00:16] now
[1:00:18] there was food there in the house of
[1:00:19] auntie there was things she had a room
[1:00:22] she had but those things mattered less
[1:00:26] in her life one thing was mattering in
[1:00:29] her life she was not living by bread
[1:00:32] alone
[1:00:33] every single day he was living on the
[1:00:36] weight of the prince
[1:00:38] every day
[1:00:39] so it is it is the issue here brothers
[1:00:41] and sisters you are the bride
[1:00:44] and i want to to bring the you know in
[1:00:46] science they give you formulas and they
[1:00:48] write them so i want to bring this
[1:00:49] formula in reverse
[1:00:51] i want to reverse it we say a plus b
[1:00:55] is c
[1:00:56] right so i want to say a minus b
[1:00:59] is a i mean c minus b is a
[1:01:03] are we together that's how they do
[1:01:04] formulas right brother
[1:01:06] that's how they do mathematics isn't it
[1:01:07] honey they say a plus b is c but c minus
[1:01:10] b is a
[1:01:12] so i want to take it from i want to say
[1:01:15] you are the bright
[1:01:17] you've been chosen
[1:01:18] you agreed you are preparing
[1:01:21] right the question is uh the
[1:01:24] manifestation of your preparation your
[1:01:27] daily preparations your daily lives
[1:01:30] should reflect
[1:01:32] that which you are
[1:01:34] are we together because you
[1:01:36] you are the bride you agree right you
[1:01:38] are greed
[1:01:39] this man is coming man
[1:01:41] this man is coming to take all your
[1:01:44] horror on earth whatever you are that
[1:01:47] you ever know in your life is going to
[1:01:50] end
[1:01:51] it is actually begun to end
[1:01:53] so how should my daily life be
[1:01:56] it should be c minus
[1:01:59] b is equals to a
[1:02:01] because we said a plus b c
[1:02:04] it can be that a plus b is c and then
[1:02:08] c
[1:02:09] minus x is a no it can't
[1:02:12] it must be in reverse it must give us
[1:02:15] the same answer
[1:02:16] the same results so you are the bright
[1:02:19] you are the lady
[1:02:21] you are preparing but how is your daily
[1:02:24] life
[1:02:25] is it reflecting
[1:02:28] it's our daily life every day showing
[1:02:31] that which we are professing
[1:02:32] every day that's the question and that's
[1:02:35] the thought that i would like us to look
[1:02:37] into not judging you not uh trying to
[1:02:40] prove that you are not you know you are
[1:02:43] but the question is is it if it's not
[1:02:46] reflecting that which you have agreed to
[1:02:48] then that's what we need to deal with
[1:02:51] that's what that's what we need to sort
[1:02:53] out
[1:02:54] because we are greed you are the bright
[1:02:56] enjoy and love you are in love you have
[1:02:59] agreed to go to the marriage supper
[1:03:02] but how come every day you are not
[1:03:04] preparing for the merit stop
[1:03:06] how come am i not
[1:03:09] how come am i easily
[1:03:11] this upset
[1:03:16] do you think that lady was anything that
[1:03:17] was going to really really really upset
[1:03:19] her brother ben
[1:03:21] that girl
[1:03:22] that the way they were upsetting her
[1:03:23] before the prince and the way they upset
[1:03:26] her now do you think was just the same
[1:03:28] not any longer
[1:03:29] there was nothing that could really
[1:03:31] touch her i could come to you and say
[1:03:33] and tell you about your past and say hey
[1:03:35] brother you say oh brother listen oh i
[1:03:38] love you brother you know what my past
[1:03:40] is not an issue anymore the issue is my
[1:03:43] present and my future
[1:03:45] the devil will come and say hey
[1:03:48] a year you are getting married

[1:03:54] you must have seen some sochi sorry in
[1:03:56] south africa eh

[1:04:03] and so she is you know this useless guy
[1:04:07] who just work here robbing people
[1:04:09] maybe it was just a criminal working and
[1:04:11] you thought it was the prince

[1:04:16] you understand what you're talking about

[1:04:31] me and hitting me every day and
[1:04:33] ridiculing me those things i don't
[1:04:35] matter anymore because it's the past
[1:04:38] what matters is what i'm doing now
[1:04:40] and what i'm going to be that's what
[1:04:43] matters i love what brother john and he
[1:04:45] said the other day he said you know it's
[1:04:47] not what the past that matters anymore
[1:04:49] no the past is not it is it's actually
[1:04:52] the past is the past
[1:04:54] [Music]
[1:04:55] he took his your sin and threw them in
[1:04:58] god's sea of forgetfulness if god can
[1:05:01] forget those things god
[1:05:05] if he can forget
[1:05:06] why is it not easy for us to forget
[1:05:09] huh
[1:05:11] are we preparing for the wedding
[1:05:13] because we are supposed to be preparing
[1:05:15] for the wedding we've got no time to
[1:05:17] think about my aunts daughters what they
[1:05:19] are doing to me how they are treating me
[1:05:22] no no
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] let's see what the prophet say there
[1:05:27] lord he was praying there lord
[1:05:31] of taking this text
[1:05:32] as is placed upon my heart to send out
[1:05:35] across the nations for people
[1:05:38] that they might know what type of life
[1:05:41] is required of them to live
[1:05:43] you see
[1:05:44] what type of life is required for you
[1:05:46] and me to live
[1:05:48] we do come to church brothers and
[1:05:49] sisters we do we are christians we are
[1:05:51] god's children we are
[1:05:54] the children of god that were chosen
[1:05:56] the only question that we are asking is
[1:05:59] is our life on a daily basis reflecting
[1:06:02] back to every iota
[1:06:06] isn't it
[1:06:07] it's not used for me to come and tell
[1:06:08] him i don't worry brothers and sisters
[1:06:10] we are all going
[1:06:11] that is true that is correct
[1:06:14] but your going is not depending on what
[1:06:16] i'm saying your going it's not depending
[1:06:18] on what you are saying i can say until i
[1:06:20] am i won't be blue because i'm already
[1:06:22] brown until i'm i'm black
[1:06:26] i can say you can say it until you turn
[1:06:28] blue
[1:06:30] that will not make you to go what will
[1:06:31] make you to go is the life
[1:06:35] on a daily basis
[1:06:37] the manifestation what comes out of you
[1:06:40] the preparations huh the living of the
[1:06:44] word that the prince promised you that's
[1:06:46] what matters
[1:06:47] it's not what i say
[1:06:49] yes what you're saying is important he
[1:06:51] did come in and propose to you
[1:06:53] did you agree yes you agreed
[1:06:55] wholeheartedly yes so the life must show
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:58] right
[1:07:00] for so many has asked me the prophet is
[1:07:03] praying
[1:07:04] is the christian's life a life of church
[1:07:07] service
[1:07:08] is it helping the poor
[1:07:10] the needy or is it a constant member
[1:07:14] those things we are all we are all we
[1:07:16] are doing a shakina tabernacle we are
[1:07:18] leaving a christian church service
[1:07:20] church church life we come to church
[1:07:22] every sunday and every wednesday we are
[1:07:25] helping the poor the pastor himself go
[1:07:27] there to take the food to the poor
[1:07:29] people we help those that we can we help
[1:07:31] across the pacific and even up to africa
[1:07:34] we help the people right
[1:07:36] now
[1:07:37] is it a loyal
[1:07:39] loyalty to the church we are loyal even
[1:07:43] the tithes we pay every sunday every
[1:07:45] month every week
[1:07:46] we do those things
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:49] to the church
[1:07:52] and such questions
[1:07:53] father may the correct answer come
[1:07:55] tonight through these ways as we we make
[1:07:59] and and and
[1:08:01] endeavorance
[1:08:02] to to bring them to the people in the
[1:08:06] name of jesus christ we ask it amen he's
[1:08:09] praying for the people because they were
[1:08:11] asking him questions he said those
[1:08:13] things are very important but that's not
[1:08:16] what we call the word of what the prince
[1:08:20] said
[1:08:21] the prince said get ready now that life
[1:08:25] must manifest itself what the prince
[1:08:27] said
[1:08:27] your preparations the way you conduct
[1:08:29] yourself the way you do things the way
[1:08:32] you are no more angered you are no more
[1:08:33] upset you are no more you have changed
[1:08:36] since the day the prince told you the
[1:08:38] wait
[1:08:39] right you can say it but you will you
[1:08:42] need to leave it
[1:08:44] every day right
[1:08:46] let's go further
[1:08:48] then jesus said visions went out to meet
[1:08:50] christ some of them fell asleep
[1:08:53] huh
[1:08:54] the first watch second one
[1:08:56] and the second third fourth fifth sixth
[1:08:59] to the seventh watch but in the seventh
[1:09:02] watch then came before the sound behold
[1:09:04] the bridegroom comet
[1:09:06] going out to meet him and the ones that
[1:09:09] that were sleeping awakened all the age
[1:09:12] back to pentecost woke up
[1:09:15] see from the seventh age the seventh
[1:09:17] such age all the way back through woke
[1:09:20] up and
[1:09:21] this that way in the church age living
[1:09:25] they were changed and they went in
[1:09:29] and the very time and every time they
[1:09:31] went in the sleeping visions came and
[1:09:33] said we want to buy some of your oil
[1:09:38] and they said no ways
[1:09:40] your preparation is out you cannot tell
[1:09:43] me now in the 11th hour it's not even
[1:09:45] the 11th hour anymore
[1:09:48] you are still wanting to buy oil
[1:09:52] that's that was a right decision
[1:09:55] right
[1:09:56] that comes from the the sermon called is
[1:09:59] your life with you of the gospel
[1:10:01] right let's go forward
[1:10:04] is your life worthy of the gospel again
[1:10:06] we cannot do that we've got to follow
[1:10:08] every day every hour of the day every
[1:10:11] step of the way
[1:10:14] can you see
[1:10:15] why we've got to be led by the lord
[1:10:18] jesus christ if we don't we take an
[1:10:21] organizational life
[1:10:23] if we don't we just take shakina
[1:10:25] tabernacle life
[1:10:28] beautiful people you know when you come
[1:10:31] to their country they'll even bring you
[1:10:32] dishes and food and everything wonderful
[1:10:35] people
[1:10:36] you know they'll drive you with their
[1:10:38] cars from the airport they'll do
[1:10:40] anything for you
[1:10:41] that's wonderful
[1:10:43] right
[1:10:44] but
[1:10:45] and a life that doesn't follow christ
[1:10:47] daily
[1:10:48] those things are not worthy
[1:10:51] i'm not worth doing they're good those
[1:10:54] are good deeds
[1:10:56] but
[1:10:57] at the bottom of those things
[1:10:59] there must be a day hourly life
[1:11:03] of me
[1:11:04] preparing to meet my prince
[1:11:07] right no matter the circumstances
[1:11:09] he can come from all the angles the
[1:11:11] devil that must be my preparation amen
[1:11:14] well
[1:11:15] i'm gonna read for you now from another
[1:11:17] spoken word why is it that so many
[1:11:19] christians find it so hard to live a
[1:11:21] christian life that is a question of a
[1:11:23] ceremony the prophet told i like that i
[1:11:25] like the titles of the prophet
[1:11:27] don't you like that
[1:11:29] why is it that so many christians find
[1:11:32] it so hard to live the christian life
[1:11:35] why
[1:11:37] he's not saying why is it that so why is
[1:11:39] it that unbelievers find it hard
[1:11:41] people who are drinking no it's not
[1:11:43] asking about them
[1:11:44] he's asking about christians
[1:11:48] why is it
[1:11:49] that christians
[1:11:51] you hear visions who went to meet him
[1:11:55] why is it
[1:11:56] that they did not prepare the oil didn't
[1:11:58] they know that lamp uses oil
[1:12:02] didn't they know
[1:12:04] they knew
[1:12:06] and they were told i'm sure they were
[1:12:08] told get enough oil
[1:12:11] for without the oil no lamp will go
[1:12:13] bright without the oil no bridegroom
[1:12:17] how will you meet him
[1:12:19] with a lamp that is
[1:12:20] dark don't kill you out
[1:12:23] because in those days it was just the
[1:12:25] arrangement come with the oil
[1:12:28] i can't come to my wedding i said
[1:12:29] brother ben we must come with a black
[1:12:31] suit and a red tie then you come with a
[1:12:33] yellow tie you you want him to mix up
[1:12:35] with
[1:12:37] you must come with red one
[1:12:41] amen so the point is
[1:12:44] they knew they were supposed to have the
[1:12:46] oil but they did not prepare it
[1:12:49] and we don't want to find ourselves in
[1:12:50] that predicament and and the worst part
[1:12:53] of it is that we say we have the oil
[1:12:57] how ignorant can that be
[1:12:59] we need to make sure
[1:13:01] and double
[1:13:02] sure that we have the oil
[1:13:05] why
[1:13:06] because no man can be pregnant and not
[1:13:09] know that he's pregnant you have to know
[1:13:11] that you have the holy ghost and the
[1:13:13] holy ghost in you will manifest its life
[1:13:16] every day
[1:13:17] it cannot be that everywhere every year
[1:13:20] every month we are struggling from the
[1:13:23] same thing every sunday in sunday out
[1:13:27] yeah in year out
[1:13:29] you still have the problem of temper
[1:13:32] huh
[1:13:33] why
[1:13:35] i had problems of temper before all of
[1:13:37] us
[1:13:38] no one because we were born with it
[1:13:40] when we were born you were an orphan
[1:13:43] like that girl
[1:13:45] but the prince came
[1:13:48] my temper was no more an issue
[1:13:51] no more
[1:13:52] hallelujah
[1:13:55] let's let's hear what the prophet says
[1:13:57] and today i'm not gonna keep you low i
[1:13:59] promise you you get a new spirit now
[1:14:02] let's go back to ezekiel the prophet he
[1:14:04] wants to talk about that this is
[1:14:05] beautiful
[1:14:07] the pastor priest about it here some
[1:14:08] time ago oh was it brother indy it i i
[1:14:10] almost jumped over
[1:14:12] my chair because that's what the prophet
[1:14:14] says he says you see
[1:14:17] the lord gives you
[1:14:19] a new spirit
[1:14:22] huh
[1:14:23] a new nature
[1:14:24] then on top of that he pulls his spirit
[1:14:28] on top of it because you see with this
[1:14:31] nature i won't be able
[1:14:33] i won't be able to live for him so now
[1:14:35] now we don't want to end up where
[1:14:38] we're just good people we are just
[1:14:39] changed we're just morally good people
[1:14:42] why there's so many good people out
[1:14:44] there brother marion some of them are
[1:14:46] better than me and you
[1:14:48] why good good people you think you can
[1:14:51] just take them and pluck them in heaven
[1:14:54] the way they are so nice
[1:14:56] better than me and you
[1:14:58] but
[1:14:59] that's just up to where god changes and
[1:15:02] give you a spirit
[1:15:05] his spirit now he must give you his
[1:15:07] spirit and then from there poor his
[1:15:09] spirit
[1:15:10] it sounds confusing there while we were
[1:15:12] reading that as again i'll change give
[1:15:14] you a heart of flesh and a flesh
[1:15:17] you know so you need to read it not with
[1:15:19] these eyes
[1:15:21] with the new eyes
[1:15:22] now the prophet says is you get a new
[1:15:25] spirit
[1:15:26] you quit your drinking you see what the
[1:15:28] new spirit does you get the new spirit
[1:15:31] you quit your drink you quit you're
[1:15:33] lying you get a new spirit you see you
[1:15:35] can do most anything with that spirit
[1:15:37] most
[1:15:39] anything
[1:15:40] but that isn't what god is talking about
[1:15:43] it's not me my brothers and sisters it's
[1:15:45] not me that's what the prophecy
[1:15:47] he says
[1:15:49] but that is not what god is talking
[1:15:52] about
[1:15:53] just coming to church doing what i can't
[1:15:56] tell you about drinking none of you is
[1:15:57] drinking i can't tell you about those
[1:15:59] things those are
[1:16:02] there
[1:16:03] we cannot just come to church we cannot
[1:16:05] just talk about the message and say we
[1:16:08] and just say we believe it
[1:16:10] no it's not that there must come a time
[1:16:13] where he said
[1:16:15] a new spirit
[1:16:16] he said i will give you now watch i'll
[1:16:19] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:16:24] a new heart
[1:16:26] a new spirit come why because they say
[1:16:29] in the olden days when they were making
[1:16:31] wine
[1:16:32] you know you know they say that says you
[1:16:34] can't put new one in an old uh
[1:16:37] an old uh
[1:16:39] skin because the whole skin is going to
[1:16:41] when that wine the stimulation of the
[1:16:43] one because that new spirit when it
[1:16:45] comes not coming to play he's not coming
[1:16:48] for jokes just to talk and say i'm a
[1:16:50] believer no he's going to tell people in
[1:16:52] the train and say hey my sister
[1:16:54] you know tonight i tell the lady i was
[1:16:56] sitting next to him
[1:16:58] i worked with you i said hey today i'm
[1:16:59] going to she said what is your plan what
[1:17:01] what what is because you know people
[1:17:03] want to know every friday they ask what
[1:17:05] is your plan what are you going to do
[1:17:07] i said no no tonight i'm going to church
[1:17:08] and i'm and you know what i'm going to
[1:17:10] preach
[1:17:13] i said hey tonight i'm
[1:17:15] joined on my youtube and my phone was
[1:17:17] off i wanted to give her the youtube
[1:17:18] link to watch right she said i'm going
[1:17:21] to say it was a strange thing for
[1:17:23] but he didn't want to appear surprised i
[1:17:25] said tonight i'm going to church
[1:17:28] she said three times a week i said no no
[1:17:30] wednesdays
[1:17:31] wednesdays and sundays every every day
[1:17:34] every week i go there so now
[1:17:38] the point i was trying to say is that
[1:17:40] you can't take a new wine
[1:17:43] and put it in old skin
[1:17:45] when
[1:17:46] the fermentation comes in fermentation
[1:17:49] when it comes the stimulation of that
[1:17:51] wine when it start to really get closer
[1:17:54] to where quality wine is supposed to be
[1:17:57] that skin the old skin of that
[1:18:00] bottle
[1:18:01] is going to break
[1:18:03] it's going to pop
[1:18:04] the prophet says somewhere and you lose
[1:18:06] the bottle and the wine
[1:18:10] so it must be a new heart that god gives
[1:18:13] you
[1:18:14] then so that when he pours his spirit in
[1:18:16] there it's in a new bottle
[1:18:18] when the wine spawns that spirit can
[1:18:21] contain it
[1:18:22] you see it can manage it can take it and
[1:18:25] get ready for the prince to come i'll
[1:18:28] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:18:31] why he would have to give you a new
[1:18:34] spirit to live for him
[1:18:37] you see
[1:18:38] that one you can do almost anything
[1:18:40] you're a wonderful boy you're a
[1:18:41] wonderful girl wonderful brother and
[1:18:43] sister
[1:18:44] you see so now
[1:18:47] let's let's let's just continue there
[1:18:49] and see how far am i
[1:18:52] why you have had
[1:18:55] an awful spirit
[1:18:58] so he has to give you a new spirit
[1:19:01] it is that's continuation of the
[1:19:02] previous one why is because you have an
[1:19:05] awful spirit me and you were born with
[1:19:07] awful spirits from the day that we were
[1:19:10] born
[1:19:11] we were born with it
[1:19:12] but he has to give us a new spirit
[1:19:16] i'll give you a new heart a new spirit
[1:19:18] now watch and i'll put my spirit in you
[1:19:22] there's the that's the difference
[1:19:23] there's the difference
[1:19:25] i'll put my spirit in you and that's
[1:19:27] what we are after
[1:19:29] because it does it is that spirit that
[1:19:31] is going to manage or live in you every
[1:19:36] minute
[1:19:37] every hour without you even doing
[1:19:39] nothing
[1:19:40] it is that spirit working inside you
[1:19:43] bride because you are great he gave you
[1:19:46] a new heart
[1:19:48] amen notice now i'll give you a new
[1:19:50] spirit and i'll put my spirit notice the
[1:19:52] new heart is to put right in the middle
[1:19:55] of you
[1:19:56] and the new spirit is to put right in
[1:19:58] the middle of your new heart
[1:20:00] did you hear that
[1:20:02] that new spirit is going to sit right in
[1:20:04] the middle of the new heart and his
[1:20:06] spirit is put right in the middle of
[1:20:08] sorry i'm just i just pissed it twice
[1:20:10] there
[1:20:11] i must have been excited so it it's the
[1:20:14] holy spirit that does it god holy spirit
[1:20:17] in the middle of your new spirit it
[1:20:20] makes the middle church operate it makes
[1:20:22] the whole church
[1:20:24] that whole church we move now from you
[1:20:26] as a person the whole church that is
[1:20:29] comes the center post of the church that
[1:20:32] spirit when it comes
[1:20:34] huh as the church we've got a new spirit
[1:20:37] and then he put a new spirit we've got
[1:20:39] previously wherever we were gathering we
[1:20:41] were not behaving the way we are now we
[1:20:43] were not
[1:20:44] we're behaving according to the
[1:20:45] traditions according to the upbringing
[1:20:48] of our churches if you could gather us
[1:20:50] like this then and just happen to
[1:20:52] coincidentally bring us together
[1:20:55] oh man come on we would
[1:20:57] we wouldn't spend two hours
[1:20:59] together
[1:21:00] back then
[1:21:02] god had to bring us and give us a new
[1:21:03] spirit and put us here and say change
[1:21:06] our nature the way we look at things
[1:21:08] and then he pour his spirit in there
[1:21:10] right in the center of our hearts let's
[1:21:13] read the yellow part it's our life
[1:21:15] ticking
[1:21:16] and that the prophet is talking about
[1:21:18] the watch
[1:21:19] you know he says the watch a watch it's
[1:21:21] got all the tools around it inside the
[1:21:24] watch for the bench called that
[1:21:25] beautiful one there is that watch inside
[1:21:27] it it has got a lot of things and
[1:21:28] machines and but there's a spring that
[1:21:31] is on the center of the watch that is
[1:21:33] actually taking and controlling every
[1:21:35] mechanism in that watch
[1:21:37] that's what you're talking about every
[1:21:39] other thing that is important but
[1:21:40] without that spring that watch my
[1:21:43] brother will get laid to work
[1:21:45] it won't work it's holding everything
[1:21:48] tight together
[1:21:50] on time every day every second
[1:21:54] every hour
[1:21:55] that's how important that spring is and
[1:21:57] that is the holy spirit that spirit god
[1:21:59] puts it on top
[1:22:01] right right
[1:22:03] do do you understand
[1:22:05] my thought brothers and sisters i just
[1:22:07] want to be very slow for you to get the
[1:22:09] point that
[1:22:10] it is
[1:22:11] not about just coming to church
[1:22:14] it is not that i'm going to get married
[1:22:17] it is not just i'm going to i'm going to
[1:22:19] get married no
[1:22:21] when he come if you're going to get
[1:22:22] married it must be seen that you are
[1:22:25] preparing to get married
[1:22:27] what is the use because he's going to
[1:22:28] come here and he will be embarrassed
[1:22:31] he's going to come here with messengers
[1:22:34] with karaokes with
[1:22:36] cars nice everything prepared and he
[1:22:39] find that you are not ready when he is
[1:22:41] coming i told you let me prepare i told
[1:22:44] you i'm getting married and you are
[1:22:45] starting to get prepared to look for the
[1:22:46] oil at the time
[1:22:48] but all this time you have been telling
[1:22:50] people that you are a believer and you
[1:22:52] are going to heaven telling them about
[1:22:54] the rapture in faith telling them about
[1:22:56] spiritual food in jew season but not
[1:22:58] eating the food
[1:23:00] that's that's that's detrimental
[1:23:03] if you operate yourself in closing
[1:23:08] let's read john
[1:23:10] you see
[1:23:12] at the center
[1:23:13] of this woman
[1:23:15] it's relationship with the prince
[1:23:18] at the center that spirit i'm talking
[1:23:20] about is god himself
[1:23:23] that spirit i'm talking about is love
[1:23:26] huh that spirit i'm talking about it is
[1:23:28] centered around love
[1:23:30] it is love is god himself you cannot be
[1:23:33] able to separate the holy spirit god and
[1:23:36] love you can't because he's one and the
[1:23:38] same he's him
[1:23:40] the holy spirit love that is at the
[1:23:42] center
[1:23:44] she didn't just say oh i love you prince
[1:23:46] and no is it you no no she felt truly
[1:23:49] fell in love with him
[1:23:51] she loved him they connected
[1:23:54] huh one day i asked a friend of mine and
[1:23:56] then i said man when are you getting
[1:23:58] married i think you must get married he
[1:23:59] says no no no no no i must get a spark
[1:24:02] first see
[1:24:04] that girl got a spark
[1:24:06] a spark came
[1:24:08] from that day he didn't look to him as a
[1:24:11] prince he looked to him as a
[1:24:14] my lover
[1:24:15] the one that is everybody was looking at
[1:24:18] him as a prince the rich guy the son of
[1:24:20] the king
[1:24:21] no that's not how he
[1:24:23] he knew he's like that
[1:24:25] he knew but he was looking at him at
[1:24:27] personal level
[1:24:29] a relationship
[1:24:30] that the one that i love the ma the one
[1:24:32] who means the world to me
[1:24:34] that's how she was looking at him that's
[1:24:37] how she was talking about him when they
[1:24:39] said the prince he says no no my
[1:24:41] sweetheart
[1:24:42] so
[1:24:45] yes
[1:24:46] i mean my hobby
[1:24:49] they were tired of her and she was not
[1:24:51] tired of telling them
[1:24:54] love not the world
[1:24:56] neither the things that are in the world
[1:25:00] if any man love the world
[1:25:02] the love of the father is not in him
[1:25:06] you see it's about love brothers and
[1:25:08] sisters it's about our manifest the
[1:25:11] manifestation of
[1:25:13] god's love in us
[1:25:15] that's the one not much about what we
[1:25:17] say every day our life must reflect what
[1:25:20] we say
[1:25:21] if he does everything we take the
[1:25:23] reverse formula and we find that it does
[1:25:25] not give us c minus b is not giving us a
[1:25:28] then that's where you need to be honest
[1:25:29] with yourself
[1:25:32] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:25:35] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[1:25:38] the pride of life is not of the father
[1:25:42] but it is of the
[1:25:43] world
[1:25:45] so what is the love of the world we all
[1:25:47] know is the things of the world nowadays
[1:25:49] the enemy is subtle
[1:25:51] very subtle
[1:25:53] he won't come and bring you make you
[1:25:55] you'll be a good person
[1:25:56] but no life
[1:25:58] he'll just make you to go and just you
[1:26:01] know he set up the world and the earth
[1:26:03] we are living in set it up in such a way
[1:26:05] that you will be trapped
[1:26:08] believer
[1:26:09] just to keep you until they say oh wake
[1:26:12] up
[1:26:13] the prince is here
[1:26:15] then you say oh then he said oh he's
[1:26:17] here are you ready now the devil he's
[1:26:20] gonna say are you ready
[1:26:22] you said you are the bride
[1:26:25] that's a painful thing eh
[1:26:27] oh
[1:26:28] don't we need it friends
[1:26:30] what to examine ourselves
[1:26:33] today
[1:26:34] to make our salvation and our calling
[1:26:37] sure
[1:26:39] examine ourselves today
[1:26:41] examine it by the weight
[1:26:44] not what brother paul says not by one
[1:26:47] brother then saying sorry brother you're
[1:26:48] in the front out also people won't marry
[1:26:50] you not bible brother marion says no no
[1:26:53] not what brother phil says
[1:26:55] but what brother phil leaves
[1:26:58] he examines himself according to the
[1:27:00] word he takes the way he lives he takes
[1:27:03] the weight
[1:27:04] take the way he leaves nobody's gonna
[1:27:06] examine you nobody must examine me i
[1:27:09] must examine myself
[1:27:11] according to the word
[1:27:14] and how can i examine myself according
[1:27:16] to do it if i'm not digging in the
[1:27:18] weight
[1:27:20] you know people there's some people that
[1:27:21] when you talk to them they they hear you
[1:27:23] selectively my wife says i used to
[1:27:26] struggle with that he tells me something
[1:27:28] then i tell her something because
[1:27:30] because i selectively chose what
[1:27:33] i wanted to hear and i tell it no we
[1:27:36] cannot selectively eat the word of god
[1:27:39] no no no just to find a scripture to
[1:27:42] tell brother chris that ever the christ
[1:27:44] you see they said you can't sit like
[1:27:45] this you see this but the prophet said
[1:27:46] no no no
[1:27:48] giving me a head of a chicken you're not
[1:27:50] giving me a chicken
[1:27:52] give me the old chicken
[1:27:54] give me the old chicken then i'll take
[1:27:56] the feathers myself
[1:27:58] do not give me a fair say see this this
[1:28:00] is this is no no no no give me the whole
[1:28:02] thing and by the way each and every one
[1:28:04] of you here have eaten full chicken
[1:28:07] hello one
[1:28:09] if you have ever eaten an egg
[1:28:11] you have eaten a full chicken hello
[1:28:15] sorry that's not relevant to what i'm
[1:28:17] saying but we need to examine ourselves
[1:28:20] according to their weight
[1:28:23] now sorry this might the next slide
[1:28:25] might be a little hard
[1:28:27] but the prophet always said you see
[1:28:29] brother and sister this is also hard for
[1:28:31] me i i don't mean to be hard to you it
[1:28:34] is because i love you
[1:28:36] it is because you are so important to
[1:28:39] god to a point whereby the way you know
[1:28:43] well in the world a young man kneels and
[1:28:45] says can i marry you him he he humbled
[1:28:48] himself well more than that
[1:28:51] and he came to earth and he became a
[1:28:53] filthy and well like us he was poor than
[1:28:57] most of us
[1:28:59] poor did not even have his own place
[1:29:02] where they say he can go and sleep there
[1:29:04] but today we have got a king bed
[1:29:06] you just press it and then the pillow
[1:29:08] comes
[1:29:10] today the lord was not like that he
[1:29:12] didn't have those things
[1:29:14] he did not have
[1:29:15] an iphone
[1:29:19] and he came
[1:29:21] why because that was an important lady
[1:29:24] there was an important lady that he
[1:29:26] wanted to come and say will you marry me
[1:29:29] he even died
[1:29:31] just look at what kind of a proposal is
[1:29:33] that one he even dies and say i'm dying
[1:29:36] because i've come to fetch you
[1:29:40] the way that you are seeing me going
[1:29:42] just know i'm gonna come the same way
[1:29:44] will you be ready
[1:29:47] hallelujah may god help us
[1:29:50] sorry
[1:29:52] now and a man or woman that professes to
[1:29:55] be a christian and don't live that kind
[1:29:57] of life by the grace of god is is a
[1:30:03] jim son jameson weed i don't know what
[1:30:05] is that it's not any dictionary
[1:30:10] this is i'm sure it's kentucky in
[1:30:12] language
[1:30:14] is that jameson weight
[1:30:16] must be a bad thing that wheat
[1:30:19] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:30:23] and i'm saying to you by your fruits you
[1:30:26] will know yourself
[1:30:28] nobody will come and know you you will
[1:30:30] know me me you we must know ourselves by
[1:30:33] our fruits the fruits of the word must
[1:30:36] manifest in ourselves and that's how we
[1:30:38] examine ourselves according to the word
[1:30:40] don't be soft on yourself when it comes
[1:30:42] to the word of god no no no no i know i
[1:30:44] understand that they say there's
[1:30:45] legalistic people and they say liberal
[1:30:48] people we are not none of those things
[1:30:50] we are god children
[1:30:52] whether legal whether liberal
[1:30:55] but we are walking in the middle of the
[1:30:56] road
[1:30:57] right we cannot shy away from talking to
[1:31:00] one another and say no no we we we we in
[1:31:02] chicago we are we are not like other

[1:31:45] we
[1:31:47] we don't want to tell sorry i'm just
[1:31:48] picking on the country because i've
[1:31:50] observed that we don't want just to be
[1:31:51] direct
[1:31:53] and say no no my friend this this is not
[1:31:55] according to the word of god don't do
[1:31:57] that do you the prophet here do you
[1:31:59] remember the prophet said this this
[1:32:00] unless i don't understand you my brother

[1:32:23] fruit is our daily life
[1:32:25] that we people are eating from us
[1:32:28] are they sweet are they the fruits of
[1:32:30] the spirit
[1:32:32] from me
[1:32:33] and not
[1:32:34] week in
[1:32:35] week out
[1:32:36] you know the papa chris works we in we
[1:32:38] regard
[1:32:40] not like that no no full time shift
[1:32:45] first to the 31st
[1:32:48] monday to friday 24 hours by the grace
[1:32:51] of god and me and you we can't do it
[1:32:54] brothers and sisters only the spirit of
[1:32:56] god can do it in us what we need to cry
[1:32:58] for and i tell my children i say hey
[1:33:01] be wise the bible says be wise if you
[1:33:04] don't have something and you see you are
[1:33:05] lacking in this area isn't it the bible
[1:33:08] said ask for anything
[1:33:11] now what is anything
[1:33:13] yeah
[1:33:16] and you realize that amen i'm even
[1:33:18] failing to ask the lord
[1:33:20] what should you do you should ask the
[1:33:21] lord to help you to help you to be able
[1:33:24] to ask
[1:33:26] the lord i'm failing to just to sit and
[1:33:28] ask you
[1:33:29] can you help me to ask you
[1:33:32] the lord god does anything
[1:33:34] he's gonna help you to be able to ask
[1:33:38] lord help me it is very difficult for me
[1:33:40] to accept when when when the word is
[1:33:43] preaching along this area lord can you
[1:33:46] with an open heart open my eyes open my
[1:33:48] heart for me to see
[1:33:50] right let us be bendable by the word of
[1:33:53] god right ask anything and he will give
[1:33:56] it to you
[1:33:57] if that thing isn't in your heart
[1:34:00] there's no record of what you are
[1:34:01] somewhere else if that thing is in your
[1:34:04] heart best record of
[1:34:06] so what is the prophet saying he's
[1:34:08] trying to say
[1:34:10] everything that is in your heart that
[1:34:12] comes out it is a reflection of what you
[1:34:15] are
[1:34:17] that's why i was saying it's hard
[1:34:19] because sometimes like you can't say ah
[1:34:21] you're talking to me like that that's a
[1:34:22] reflection of who you are no no no you
[1:34:24] don't talk like that but the reflection
[1:34:26] of what comes out of my heart by myself
[1:34:30] that is a reflection of what comes from
[1:34:32] in here and we should be able to say hey
[1:34:34] yes brother don't don't don't be soft on
[1:34:36] yourself and say no no no no no that's
[1:34:39] not just
[1:34:40] white washi
[1:34:42] it must be that hey yes the word of god
[1:34:44] is correcting me as an individual
[1:34:48] if
[1:34:50] sorry
[1:34:52] i wanted to point you if is evil it best
[1:34:55] record that you are down here when you
[1:34:58] die you'll you'll have to go to you'll
[1:35:01] have to go to where you are already
[1:35:04] if you are good and you are you are your
[1:35:07] good because god has made you good you
[1:35:10] are you are born again you are bound to
[1:35:12] go that way because the life
[1:35:15] will have to bear record with this place
[1:35:19] if it bears record here of here
[1:35:22] that's where you go
[1:35:24] there's no two ways about it it's either
[1:35:26] left
[1:35:27] or right
[1:35:28] i'm not being legalistic it's either
[1:35:30] left or right
[1:35:32] if it bears record up there that's where
[1:35:35] you go
[1:35:36] is either there
[1:35:38] good dog
[1:35:39] or the dead dog
[1:35:42] right side of the good or the bed dog
[1:35:45] the one that i feed the most goes
[1:35:47] now amen means
[1:35:50] let it be so
[1:35:51] may god bless us and may god help us
[1:35:54] that we can think of that young lady
[1:35:58] in the words of the prince
[1:36:00] and to us
[1:36:02] every day
[1:36:03] and our formula to give us the same
[1:36:05] answer that way or that way
[1:36:08] same answer and in that way i can assure
[1:36:11] you
[1:36:12] that when he comes because the world
[1:36:14] that we are living in now is finished
[1:36:17] in that spoken word of is the is your
[1:36:19] life worthy of the gospel the prophet
[1:36:21] was saying the word reality is finished
[1:36:24] it's gone and the prophet was saying
[1:36:25] this in one spoken word in 63 but it is
[1:36:28] done
[1:36:29] it is done i think it was a
[1:36:35] it was this one this spoken word is your
[1:36:37] life your life with the gospel says it's
[1:36:39] finished
[1:36:40] and and i was reading about these
[1:36:42] countries china and them it's just
[1:36:44] coming to a point where it's going to an
[1:36:46] end
[1:36:47] now and what the prophet said is
[1:36:48] happening and it's going to happen
[1:36:50] all these things have covered and
[1:36:52] everything these are just the beginning
[1:36:55] it's the beginning we are at the end of
[1:36:57] the end
[1:36:59] and when that girl head
[1:37:02] realized let's say the princess is going
[1:37:04] to come on the 25th of december when
[1:37:06] that girl realized that i'm now going

[1:37:48] little circle for himself there you draw
