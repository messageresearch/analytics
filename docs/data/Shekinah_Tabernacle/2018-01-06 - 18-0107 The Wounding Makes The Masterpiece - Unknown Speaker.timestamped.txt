[33:12] large portion of this so C is here and I
[33:15] was a fifty three and one it says who
[33:19] hath believed our report and to whom as
[33:22] the arm of the Lord revealed for each
[33:24] shall grow up before him as a tender
[33:25] plant and as a root out of a dry ground
[33:28] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[33:31] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[33:34] we should desire him he is despised and
[33:37] rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[33:39] antiquated acquainted with grief and we
[33:42] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[33:44] despised and we esteemed him not
[33:47] surely he has borne our griefs and
[33:49] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[33:52] him stricken smitten of God and
[33:54] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[33:59] transgressions he was bruised for our
[34:01] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[34:03] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[34:06] healed all we like sheep have gone
[34:08] astray all we like sheep have gone
[34:11] astray we have turned every one to his
[34:13] own way and the LORD hath laid on him
[34:15] the iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[34:18] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[34:20] his mouth
[34:21] he has brought as a lamb to the
[34:23] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[34:25] Shearer's is dumb so he opened openeth
[34:29] not his mouth he was taken from prison
[34:32] and from judgment and who shall declare
[34:34] his generation for he was cut off out of
[34:37] the land of the living for the
[34:39] transgression of my people was he
[34:41] stricken and he were and he made his
[34:43] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[34:45] in his death because he had done no
[34:47] violence neither was any deceit in his
[34:49] mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[34:52] him and he hath put him to grief when
[34:56] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[34:58] sin he shall see he shall see his seed
[35:01] he shall prolong his days and the
[35:03] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[35:06] his hand amen my lord
[35:08] Lycia spray-in gracious father we have
[35:11] read your word lord I just pray you
[35:13] just take it Lord and bless your word
[35:15] now father we commit the service unto
[35:17] your hands have your way please in every
[35:19] life we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[35:21] amen god bless you friends you may all
[35:24] have your seats this morning I'd like to
[35:27] approach a subject if I may about divine
[35:32] character divine nature now we
[35:35] understand that there's only one thing
[35:37] we take with us and that's our character
[35:39] we don't take our riches our gold our
[35:41] education our anything that we have in
[35:43] our human ability you know gathered or
[35:46] done we take our character with us
[35:48] that's all we take and God is looking
[35:51] for a people that have his character
[35:52] he's not looking for anything else he's
[35:56] looking for character brother Brahim
[35:57] said when Eliezer went to go get Rebecca
[36:01] well went to go get a bride for Isaac
[36:03] and found Rebecca that he was looking
[36:05] for character and God is looking for
[36:07] character and a people and we understand
[36:10] that all of this the scripture we have
[36:12] the message we have this is the
[36:14] revelation of Jesus Christ it's a person
[36:16] being made known it's more than
[36:18] doctrinal and you know just a school of
[36:22] thought but it is a person being
[36:23] expressed and now Christianity is that
[36:26] same person being expressed not just in
[36:29] one person anymore as God the fullness
[36:31] of God here bodily in a man but now it's
[36:33] in a many membered body so as a city
[36:35] just being in one it's in many so the
[36:37] same character that was in him has to be
[36:39] in you the same life that was in him has
[36:42] to be in you this is Christianity to be
[36:45] a Christian is to be christ-like amen so
[36:48] we're we are called to live out the
[36:49] definition of being a Christian is to be
[36:52] christ-like now we understand that the
[36:54] only way this can happen as if his life
[36:57] comes unto you now brother Branham and
[37:00] I'm gonna this is just my words wait
[37:02] where are we this is just my words this
[37:03] may not make sense to you but in my
[37:05] notes this is how I kind of right now we
[37:08] read in the scripture it said but it
[37:09] pleased God to bruise him that pleased
[37:13] God to brew some now in him was eternal
[37:15] life this is Jesus in him was eternal
[37:17] life all of salvation was in him healing
[37:20] was in him deliverance was in him
[37:22] overcoming power over everything was in
[37:24] him but it had to be released and
[37:27] to be released it wasn't just for Hermes
[37:29] is for this cause I've come into the
[37:31] world so for this course the reason he
[37:34] came into the world as his life would be
[37:35] poured out it would be given it wouldn't
[37:38] just be bottled up he didn't just want
[37:39] to be all by himself the whole plan of
[37:42] redemption is not just God dwelling by
[37:43] himself but redemption is I have a
[37:45] family I have a wife I have children and
[37:49] I want them to be gathered to where I am
[37:51] I want to express myself to them that
[37:54] they would love me in return this is
[37:55] redemption and so now God the brother
[37:59] bremen and and I'll fight you know we'll
[38:01] get down to the courts but he here II he
[38:04] sees a sculpture of Moses that
[38:07] Michelangelo sculpted and he said that
[38:11] the reason it's a masterpiece is because
[38:13] Michelangelo after what he had seen in
[38:16] his mind was now in marble in a statue
[38:19] as he was so struck by what he saw what
[38:23] he saw his mind had become material he
[38:25] took this hammer and he cried out speak
[38:27] and he struck it on the knee and there's
[38:29] a there's a gash there's a small mark in
[38:31] the in the it would be the statues right
[38:34] knee and brother BAM said the reason
[38:36] it's a masterpiece is because of the
[38:38] mark is because of the wounding the
[38:41] wounding makes it the masterpiece it's
[38:43] not the it's not the incredible
[38:44] sculpture work though that is incredible
[38:46] but it is it is the mark in the knee and
[38:49] he said when God when when Jesus what
[38:52] made Jesus the masterpiece is the wounds
[38:54] as the wounding because the wounding the
[38:58] wounding released a life and it's the
[39:01] same I'm just going to come right down
[39:02] to your address what's in US has to come
[39:05] out and it comes out by wounding it
[39:08] comes out by affliction it comes out by
[39:11] hardship doesn't come out by the good
[39:13] times your real character comes out in
[39:16] hardship and trial and you don't know
[39:18] which way is up or down or left or right
[39:20] that's when your real character comes up
[39:22] that's when your real nature comes out
[39:24] and and if you don't have that life
[39:27] whatever comes out of you is what's in
[39:29] you so I say the wounding allowed his
[39:33] life to come forth now and that life
[39:37] really was a divine character this is
[39:38] just my words now
[39:40] this this is this is what has to happen
[39:46] with us I'm just gonna read some
[39:48] scriptures as a background because we
[39:50] take our character with us God is going
[39:53] to have a people that are made in His
[39:54] image that's what he that is his purpose
[39:57] because in order
[39:59] I'll just black this out for a second
[40:01] remember a a man when he gets married he
[40:06] doesn't marry he marries the same specie
[40:08] and reality when when when whenever we
[40:11] were looking for a spouse we're looking
[40:13] for any what was our heart what's in us
[40:15] what's the river like you know what's
[40:17] really we can say a whole bunch of
[40:19] things but when we got married we're
[40:20] looking for something that was
[40:21] complimentary they mean so we were
[40:25] looking for a fit so for myself I was
[40:27] looking for the feminine side of me the
[40:29] feminine part of me hallelujah I believe
[40:31] I struck gold hallelujah that's just a
[40:35] very unbiased opinion but I was looking
[40:39] for the the revelation of of what what
[40:43] is my really what does my heart really
[40:45] want to express amen
[40:47] and then I found Chris to eat and here
[40:49] we are glory to God I mean but God but
[40:53] we're looking for their revelation
[40:54] that's in us and so now if God is if God
[40:58] is looking for a for a wife if God is
[41:04] looking for a wife he's not looking for
[41:06] people that just join a club or have a
[41:08] religion or heifer well this is our way
[41:11] of life he's looking more beyond that
[41:12] he's looking for a people that are him
[41:16] he's looking for the feminine part of
[41:19] him that's what he's looking for he's
[41:22] not looking for anything else he wants
[41:23] to find a people that have his character
[41:26] have his nature that's what he's looking
[41:28] for because the marriage is his in the
[41:30] book of Revelation that the marriage of
[41:32] the lamb has come now
[41:34] I can't marry an animal I have to marry
[41:37] the same specie
[41:38] so in order for him to marry for a lamb
[41:41] has to marry another lamb right you know
[41:45] and so he's got to marry someone who's
[41:47] exactly like him and that's why now but
[41:51] the thing is when we're born we have a
[41:53] part of
[41:54] that's the real part as dormant it's a
[41:57] seed that's just laying there that's the
[41:59] real us it has a divine character it has
[42:02] potentials in it are you following me it
[42:05] has potentials it has the potential to
[42:07] be loving and long-suffering and gentle
[42:11] and meek and have meekness and faith and
[42:13] and all those things it has it but it's
[42:16] just laying there but in it but then
[42:18] when we are born this kind of flesh
[42:20] begins to live but that's not what God
[42:22] is God's not looking for carnal flesh
[42:23] he's not interested in where we're from
[42:26] what color skin we have what nationality
[42:29] what language we may speak those things
[42:31] as God is a God of variety but but if
[42:34] you boil it all down he's looking for
[42:35] that for that seed he's looking for his
[42:37] children and we can be buried in all
[42:40] kinds of concrete and unbelief and and
[42:42] and complexes and pains and hurts and
[42:45] misunderstanding that can be buried away
[42:47] but as soon as the light strikes that
[42:49] seed hallelujah it has to live because
[42:52] there's a life in it
[42:54] it's a living seed it must come to life
[42:56] amen and I trust you can say and it did
[42:59] hallelujah and it did begin to lose and
[43:01] it did begin to grow and what was laying
[43:04] as a potential on the inside that seed
[43:06] began to manifest itself hallelujah and
[43:09] that's what he's looking for that's what
[43:11] he's looking for and so this is why
[43:13] you've been I trust that's why you can
[43:15] say God spoke to me there's something
[43:18] more it's just more than religion more
[43:20] than a nice idea I may not be able to
[43:22] understand it but that's why there's a
[43:24] pool there's a call and it's a call to
[43:28] God is calling you whether you recognize
[43:31] it or not I want to manifest my
[43:33] character in you
[43:34] I want to manifest my life in you that
[43:37] win at all whether it's all said and
[43:38] done and you gathered around the throat
[43:40] he looks at himself in a people amen
[43:45] this is what this message is to produce
[43:47] and this award does the word will
[43:50] produce what it's meant to produce we
[43:52] don't have to cook it up sugarcoat it
[43:55] whatever you know it will produce what
[43:58] we'll produce and that's why we can have
[44:00] such confidence Lord if this word has
[44:02] been seen to produce you and a people
[44:04] like never before then it will
[44:07] I accept it I believe it I walk in it I
[44:10] don't understand all things but I see
[44:12] Jesus and that's the main thing and
[44:14] you'll beget you because you got to look
[44:16] deep down into yourself and say do I see
[44:19] the character of God in me and the good
[44:22] times but mainly in the bed because
[44:27] there has to come it's like Jesus he was
[44:30] called The Rose of Sharon and the lily
[44:31] of the valley now in order to get the
[44:34] fragrance out of the I may get it
[44:36] because I normally get things mixed up
[44:37] if I have to either one the Rose of
[44:41] Sharon I believe it is it's got to be
[44:43] crushed to get the fragrance out in
[44:46] order to get that sweet smelling perfume
[44:48] it's got to be crushed it's got to be I
[44:51] can't just sit there in an advice and
[44:53] look nice or be sitted there you know in
[44:55] a garden looking beautiful it's got to
[44:56] be taken it's got to be cut down
[44:58] it's got to be crushed that's why it's
[45:01] called the Rose of Sharon and now we are
[45:04] called remember we have to be crushed
[45:07] there's a life that has to be expressed
[45:09] out of you it's got to be a crushing
[45:11] there's got to be a wounding in order
[45:15] for a life to come forth if you wanted
[45:19] to this is a different kind of service
[45:22] but here we are God is looking for
[45:24] character we can shout we can scream we
[45:26] can dance we can do all kinds of things
[45:28] but if the character of God is not in us
[45:30] we've missed the mark we must have his
[45:34] character that's what that's what he's
[45:35] looking for because these people in
[45:37] Matthew chapter 7 they come to Jesus
[45:39] they say have we not cast out Devils in
[45:41] your name every not prophesied in thy
[45:42] name have we not done many mighty works
[45:44] and he never says no you never did those
[45:46] things he said I just never knew you
[45:48] depart from me ye that work iniquity so
[45:51] they did all those things that are
[45:52] anointed they did supernatural things
[45:54] but he never knew them never intimately
[45:56] became one with him because our workers
[45:59] of iniquity they wouldn't take his word
[46:01] see and so he's looking for himself and
[46:04] a people now according s as this is in
[46:08] 2nd Peter
[46:09] according as his divine power hath given
[46:13] unto us all things that pertain unto
[46:14] life and godliness through the knowledge
[46:16] of him that hath called us to glory and
[46:19] virtue whereby a given
[46:21] was exceeding great and precious
[46:22] promises that by these ye might be
[46:26] partakers of the bad me divine nature
[46:29] having escaped the corruption that is in
[46:31] the world through lust so there's a we
[46:34] are called to be partakers of his divine
[46:36] nature now it's season Philippians 3:8
[46:42] 2:11 yea doubtless I count all things
[46:45] but the loss for the excellency of the
[46:48] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[46:51] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[46:53] things and do count them but dung this
[46:55] is how I've gotta weigh up your past
[46:56] life I counted it but dung that I may
[47:00] win Christ all the good and the bad you
[47:02] did many times we count the bad but
[47:04] dying you've gotta count the good right
[47:07] that I may win Christ the Apostle Paul
[47:09] did do some good things as a Pharisee he
[47:13] lived a holy life outwardly he looked
[47:15] good he was very devout he was sincere
[47:18] those are good things but he had to
[47:20] count it all but none that he may win
[47:22] Christ and be found in him not having
[47:24] mine own righteousness which is of the
[47:26] law but that which is through the faith
[47:28] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[47:30] God by faith that I may know him and the
[47:34] power of his resurrection and we all say
[47:36] hallelujah we know him in the power of
[47:38] his resurrection and and the Fellowship
[47:41] of his sufferings being made conformable
[47:44] unto his death effort by any means I
[47:47] might obtain and to the resurrection of
[47:49] the Dead so he's saying that we have to
[47:51] be and the Fellowship of his sufferings
[47:54] because the it's through hardship and
[47:56] trial that we are that his character has
[48:00] molded and shaped into us he says this
[48:05] this is in first Peter 4 beloved think
[48:08] it not strange concerning the fiery
[48:10] trial which is to try you as though some
[48:13] strange thing happen unto you but
[48:15] rejoice and so much as ye are partakers
[48:17] of Christ's sufferings that when when
[48:21] his glory shall be revealed ye may be
[48:24] glad also with exceeding joy if ye be
[48:27] reproached for the name of Christ
[48:29] happier ye for the spirit o spirit of
[48:32] glory and of God rest upon you
[48:35] on their part has evil spoken of but on
[48:38] your part he is glorified so we are
[48:43] partakers of Christ's sufferings there
[48:46] is a measure of suffering for the church
[48:49] but there's a reason for it it's not in
[48:52] vain all the hardship you know
[48:55] everything would go through
[48:56] it's a wounding but it's to release a
[49:00] life it's to release a life it's not
[49:03] just that he can deliver you and heal
[49:05] you and you know be your comforter and
[49:07] God through those things that's all part
[49:08] of it too but there's a it's a release
[49:11] it's a wounding amen it's a wounding and
[49:16] we have to be willing friends maybe he
[49:19] doesn't do a vain thing we may not
[49:22] understand what's going on but you have
[49:24] to have confidence Lord you're in
[49:27] control you've allowed me to be wounded
[49:29] you've allowed me to be afflicted
[49:31] because there's a life on me and it has
[49:34] to be released
[49:34] it's got to be a character that's got to
[49:36] be expressed amen there's a job but he
[49:42] not the way that I take when he hath
[49:44] tried me I shall come forth as gold now
[49:47] gold in the scripture represents the
[49:49] eating so when he has tried amen he
[49:53] knows he knows that when he hath tried
[49:55] me I shall come forth as gold now in the
[49:57] New Testament the word I may get it
[50:00] wrong but there's a the root word over I
[50:03] think
[50:03] tried or tempted I may be totally wrong
[50:06] but it comes down to the definition of I
[50:08] mean the word means to be assayed to be
[50:12] tried now an essay when you think of a
[50:15] like in geological terms as they take a
[50:19] big column of rock that they've drilled
[50:21] out and they take sections of it and
[50:23] they pummel it in a ball mill so it
[50:24] becomes powder and then they begin to
[50:26] look at what's in this rock that's being
[50:28] assayed and that's like us we get s8 you
[50:33] know we get ground down gada lads are
[50:36] grinding to go on we get thrown in a
[50:39] ball mill and if you've ever used a ball
[50:41] mill I have but not for rock but for but
[50:44] for kiwifruit testing it's a very
[50:46] violent thing
[50:48] it's it's got a ball bearing and it
[50:50] shakes very fast and and when it's all
[50:53] said and done the key for it doesn't
[50:55] look like key for it anymore how much
[50:57] more a rock that's been ground down to
[50:59] powder but the reason is now there's an
[51:01] essaying going on and the part of the
[51:04] essaying is not only Galkin see what's
[51:06] in you but you can see what's in you
[51:08] they meant because you got to be able to
[51:10] see you gotta be able to see hey this is
[51:12] God and me I would have I would have
[51:15] reacted to this to this very differently
[51:17] before I met him but now after I've met
[51:20] him I'm responding in a way that even
[51:22] surprises myself hallelujah this is what
[51:26] he's got to do and so because he has to
[51:29] prove her salvation amen
[51:32] time-tested memorials of God brother
[51:34] Brown speaks about we're going to be
[51:35] time tested amen still loving the Lord
[51:38] still serving him still praising him
[51:41] amen and the good and the bad in the up
[51:44] and the down when everything's wonderful
[51:46] when everything's very unone derful
[51:48] hallelujah can you praise him in the
[51:50] storm I mean can you praise him when
[51:52] things look look like your backs against
[51:55] the wall in your in front of you is a
[51:56] firing squad can you praise them can you
[51:59] that's the see there's now a wounding
[52:02] what's in you what's in you will come
[52:04] out we can may full one another and put
[52:07] on a church face and a and an officer
[52:10] and say everything's peachy but God
[52:12] looks beyond that we may be able to fool
[52:15] one another but God looks beyond that
[52:16] and he sees what's in you amen there
[52:22] will be no actors in heaven no Pharisees
[52:27] in heaven only the genuine will be there
[52:29] now this is brother Bernie speaking he
[52:32] says and I stood up there speaking of
[52:35] michelangelo's Moses and I stood there
[52:38] Los Angeles at Forest Lawn oh there's a
[52:40] replica of Forest Lawn the real ones in
[52:41] the Vatican one day and my heart jumped
[52:44] how many has ever been to been in Forest
[52:46] Lawn that's a great that's a famous
[52:47] cemetery if you're not sure there's a
[52:49] statue of Moses by I believe it's
[52:51] Michelangelo it's a perfect statute all
[52:54] but on the right knee there's a Knick
[52:56] about half an inch deep and the guide I
[52:57] was looking he pointed out to me said
[52:59] Michelangelo spent a lifetime of trying
[53:02] to make he was a sculptor is trying to
[53:03] make the image of Moses back in his mind
[53:05] he had in his mind what Moses should
[53:08] look like he had that in his heart what
[53:10] Moses should look like and when he spent
[53:13] his life time a chisel but here Robert
[53:16] stand back looking at year after year
[53:18] after year he worked on it finally it
[53:20] was completed he stepped back and he
[53:22] laid down his rag and his hammer and he
[53:24] looked at the statute was so perfect the
[53:26] image of Moses that he had in his heart
[53:28] till he got so beside himself he grabbed
[53:30] the hammer and struck at holid speak
[53:32] it's called Michelangelo's masterpiece
[53:34] that great something in that sculptor
[53:36] that vision that he had of what Moses
[53:39] ought to be with was only portraying and
[53:41] type the Great Father God he had anis
[53:45] half before the foundation of the world
[53:47] a son because he is a father but it was
[53:50] still in the genes of his word and he
[53:51] created a man and he had I had to put
[53:55] him on free moral agency but that man
[53:57] fell but the great sculptor God who made
[54:00] man from the dust of the earth he didn't
[54:02] settle for that he started making man
[54:04] again he made a Noah he died drunk he
[54:07] made a Moses that failed to keep his
[54:08] word he made prophets that run in time
[54:10] of trouble
[54:11] he kept building and moulding until
[54:13] after all he wanted a masterpiece to
[54:15] reflect him his nature what was in his
[54:19] heart what a son should be now don't
[54:22] just put this on Jesus when I read this
[54:24] or singing his nature to reflect him
[54:26] that's you as well that's me amen
[54:30] because that's what we are to reflect he
[54:36] says and there is a broken piece on his
[54:38] leg knee of Michael knee of Moses where
[54:40] Michelangelo struck it with his hammer
[54:42] for he was so inspired see there was
[54:44] something inside of him at the beginning
[54:46] that he drew a mental picture of what he
[54:48] thought Moses ought to look like and
[54:50] when he had seen that reflected before
[54:52] him the very thing that he had on his
[54:54] mind what he thought Moses should look
[54:56] like he carried that vision with him all
[54:58] them years and years as he took the
[55:00] great piece of granite and a chip of
[55:02] piece here and there and Mark it down
[55:04] because it had to come perfectly and
[55:06] when it was perfected before him he seen
[55:09] the reflection of what was in his mind
[55:10] and that's what inspired him so to
[55:13] strike the image and cry out speak for
[55:15] all his years of toil had paid off his
[55:18] great handiwork had been fulfilled now
[55:21] we see that and I got inspired by it
[55:23] because I thought of that really the
[55:24] mark on the league was what made it to
[55:27] me
[55:27] the masterpiece it's the wounding we
[55:32] cause that wounding a ment we all caused
[55:35] the wounding but it was the wounds that
[55:36] made it the masterpiece because the
[55:38] wounds allowed the release of the life
[55:40] and it's the same thing with us it's the
[55:43] same thing with us we can't just be
[55:46] walking around you know with this
[55:48] eternal life it's going to be expressed
[55:50] his character has got to be expressed
[55:52] I mean his nature has to be expressed
[55:55] and you see God God in the scripture
[55:57] main part of his character when it's
[55:59] expressed as when his children go
[56:01] sideways when they're lost and undone
[56:03] when redemption has to happen why did
[56:07] Jesus come he's the image of the
[56:09] invisible God he came to seek and seek
[56:13] and find that which is lost he came to
[56:15] redeem amen he didn't come to the ones
[56:19] who had it all together he came to the
[56:21] woman at the well he had to express
[56:22] Redemption she was wounded she was
[56:25] wounded by this world and he had the
[56:28] answer to those wounds hallelujah Legion
[56:31] was wounded by this world and then just
[56:33] he didn't just suddenly one day wake up
[56:34] with a thousand demons in them I mean he
[56:37] took a step off the road maybe by some
[56:39] influence of someone anybody found
[56:41] himself eventually in these terms and he
[56:43] wouldn't have been happy there but there
[56:45] was wounds there amen but in the master
[56:48] winners way hallelujah the master
[56:50] winners way I mean because he had an
[56:52] answer to those words amen Peter James
[56:55] and John all them they were wounded
[56:58] Matthew the textbook that he was willing
[57:01] to do no one liked him he wasn't
[57:03] accepted because he was a tax collector
[57:04] he's working for the Romans
[57:06] there was a wounding but then Jesus came
[57:09] and he was the answer to those wounds
[57:12] he's the answer to our wounds friends
[57:15] he's the answer to our words I mean
[57:18] here's the balm in Gilead he is the
[57:21] restorer of our souls he is our healer
[57:24] glory to God I'm glad before there was
[57:26] the wounds there was the healer
[57:29] before there was a lost and broken
[57:31] people there was a redeemer before that
[57:34] was manifest that he was there with
[57:35] these potentials and now they are so
[57:37] wounding now we become believers and
[57:41] it's very easy sometimes we come out of
[57:43] the world and those things God just
[57:46] heals it's very easy sometimes right but
[57:49] then it's when we come in among the
[57:50] house of our friends come in among
[57:53] believers and it's really the wounds of
[57:55] the believers are the ones that cut the
[57:57] deepest hallelujah isn't that right it's
[58:02] the it's the misunderstandings and
[58:04] fellowships and between brother and
[58:06] sister things that maybe not even really
[58:09] have an answer sometimes you know iron
[58:11] sharpens iron I mean we're a one big
[58:15] ball mill hallelujah sometimes we had a
[58:18] thing being ground sometimes we're the
[58:20] ball bearing because we hit us you know
[58:24] mold each other but it's but it's the
[58:26] wounding from from the ones who are
[58:28] closest to us those the ones that can be
[58:31] the deepest now but now here it comes
[58:34] that there's a purpose in that God saw
[58:37] that coming God knew it was going to
[58:39] happen and it had to actually be that
[58:41] ways because there's a life in you
[58:44] there's a life and it's not your natural
[58:47] life that he's looking for to be
[58:49] expressed he's not looking for that he's
[58:51] looking for that eternal life he's
[58:53] looking for his nature what's really in
[58:56] you it's gonna be proof you know God is
[59:06] in man and he's identifying himself
[59:09] today in his church and the born-again
[59:11] Christian God identifies himself that he
[59:14] remains God and the outside world will
[59:17] only know God as they see God in you and
[59:19] I that's the only way they'll know God
[59:22] is when you are written epistles epistle
[59:26] of the Scripture we are rid of all men
[59:28] and the life that we live for reflects
[59:31] what's on the inside of us a man is
[59:34] identified by the works that he does so
[59:38] our works should be good see always good
[59:40] because we are representing
[59:42] Lord Jesus Christ so the life we live
[59:44] reflects what's in you and when I'm born
[59:50] of the Spirit of God I'm a part of God
[59:52] that's all I am identified with him see
[59:54] that he is my father then my life should
[59:58] reflect him as my life reflects my
[1:00:00] earthly father and the image that he is
[1:00:02] and that's why you see you know if I put
[1:00:05] those photos through and brothers and
[1:00:07] sisters of their of when they are young
[1:00:08] and the appearance and grandparents
[1:00:10] sometimes and it's like everyone says
[1:00:12] time-travelling because naturally we
[1:00:15] look so much like our parents because
[1:00:17] it's a physical manifestation of a you
[1:00:19] know life but then there's also the
[1:00:21] character is passed down and their
[1:00:23] natures passed down now that's just
[1:00:26] natural life where so much you know
[1:00:28] whether we like it or not we become our
[1:00:30] parents on the natural level we do we
[1:00:34] start to speak like them we have
[1:00:36] mannerisms like them you know and it's
[1:00:39] you know you know I wasn't expecting a
[1:00:42] big hallelujah chorus right there but
[1:00:45] but it's true on the natural side we do
[1:00:48] because it's passed down but and if that
[1:00:52] is the case now naturally how much more
[1:00:55] eternally amen
[1:00:57] because we're not really called here to
[1:00:59] express our natural sure God uses that
[1:01:02] there's there's good qualities that he
[1:01:04] passes down but that's not all he wants
[1:01:06] us to express he wants us to express his
[1:01:08] divine nature if we are Christians that
[1:01:11] old life is dead and buried I mean it's
[1:01:14] dead and it stays did him that is dead
[1:01:16] is free from sin the scripture says so
[1:01:18] if you really did you're free from sin
[1:01:20] Alleluia and I'm talking about not
[1:01:23] naturally dead but if your old life is
[1:01:26] dead then you're free from sin so your
[1:01:29] life is reflected in you and and God our
[1:01:32] fathers reflected in us when we are born
[1:01:35] and conformed here to us so much now
[1:01:40] this is go to a scripture it's go to
[1:01:42] Ephesians I don't have this in my notes
[1:01:44] let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 I trust
[1:01:48] this little study is helpful in some way
[1:01:50] what are we looking to become what are
[1:01:53] you looking to become you know because
[1:01:55] all of us are behold
[1:01:56] something when I was young enough she
[1:01:58] had this probably me you know me talks
[1:02:01] about when I was young I loved cricket
[1:02:03] and I wanted to become Danny Morrison
[1:02:05] all who remember her a few generations
[1:02:08] back he's a fast bowler and I wanted to
[1:02:10] bawl like him I wanted to run up to the
[1:02:12] wicket like him I wanted to if there was
[1:02:14] an UMP I wanted to basically take his
[1:02:16] ear off every time I bowled like he did
[1:02:17] I want to be exactly like him cuz I was
[1:02:19] beholding an image this is what I wanted
[1:02:21] to be and of course it chops and changes
[1:02:24] as you go through the years but you'll
[1:02:25] be holding something and you want to
[1:02:27] become that now when you become an adult
[1:02:30] you're still be holding an image you're
[1:02:32] still be holding an image but which one
[1:02:34] are you beholding are you beholding
[1:02:36] someone successful in the world and the
[1:02:38] ideal you know what New Zealand dictates
[1:02:41] is this is how you know this is what
[1:02:42] family should have and be in things in
[1:02:44] this in the society is that where you'll
[1:02:46] behold it or are you beholding what is
[1:02:48] the image of God what do you want to
[1:02:51] become because if you whatever you
[1:02:53] behold you will become others very
[1:02:56] successfully or not very successfully
[1:02:58] but you'll you'll start becoming like
[1:02:59] that I don't want to become like this
[1:03:02] world I want to become like my maker I
[1:03:04] want to become like my father I want to
[1:03:07] be I want to do them proud here's my
[1:03:10] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased I
[1:03:12] mean here's my beloved bride and whom
[1:03:14] I'm well pleased she's the apple of my
[1:03:16] eye
[1:03:17] I mean she's wonderful she's the one
[1:03:19] I've been waiting for all these
[1:03:20] thousands of years and here she is
[1:03:23] hallelujah so I can express my love to
[1:03:25] her and she can love me in return that
[1:03:28] we want to behold that kind of image I
[1:03:30] mean this great this great romance
[1:03:33] between us and God hallelujah this is
[1:03:37] what we want to be you know I want to
[1:03:38] become him and if we read in Ephesians
[1:03:40] here let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 and
[1:03:43] we'll read we'll just start from verse
[1:03:45] 12 but brother Brown speaks I think in
[1:03:50] the scripture I mean in the mrs. paradox
[1:03:52] cases we've come to an Ephesians again
[1:03:55] now that means who have come back with a
[1:04:00] Ephesian Church was when Paul was
[1:04:02] writing to it we've come back to that
[1:04:04] spot again but the only difference now
[1:04:07] is the Ephesian Church aimed at the mark
[1:04:09] of the high calling
[1:04:10] to becoming mature form of him but they
[1:04:15] relaxed and Avista the church went from
[1:04:17] there down to the dark ages we've came
[1:04:19] back to that spot but we are not
[1:04:21] anointed to just a mat and relax and go
[1:04:23] down
[1:04:24] we're anointed to a mat and become
[1:04:26] that's what the bride is called to be we
[1:04:29] don't just aim at becoming him we become
[1:04:31] him everything he is we become by his
[1:04:34] grace he became me the scripture says he
[1:04:37] became a sinner
[1:04:38] he became you know rejected afflicted he
[1:04:41] became a sinner he became a sinner for
[1:04:43] me and he took my sins to hell
[1:04:46] hallelujah that I do not need to carry
[1:04:48] them to hell he took them to hell on my
[1:04:51] behalf it means that he became a sinner
[1:04:53] that I would become him by His grace
[1:04:55] so I become I'd become righteous perfect
[1:04:59] hallelujah everything God is everything
[1:05:02] all of his nature all of us how he looks
[1:05:05] at things his mind everything he is as
[1:05:07] hard
[1:05:08] I would I would manifest that Amen let's
[1:05:11] just not put Jesus as just a man in a
[1:05:14] robe that walked on the shore of Galilee
[1:05:16] he had a character like none other
[1:05:18] I mean you read the Sermon on the Mount
[1:05:20] and there's God he's expressing his
[1:05:23] character in the Sermon on the Mount
[1:05:24] blessing to the meek listen to the
[1:05:26] humble listen to the you know listen to
[1:05:29] the merciful and all those different
[1:05:30] things he's that's his character being
[1:05:32] expressed hallelujah and I believe he
[1:05:35] started with that is because he's saying
[1:05:37] this is what I'm going to produce into
[1:05:38] people hallelujah this is what we're
[1:05:42] growing - this is what we should be
[1:05:43] looking Lord make me more like me make
[1:05:47] me more likely so in Ephesians 4 and 12
[1:05:49] for the perfecting of the saints now
[1:05:53] that word perfect thing it actually
[1:05:54] means a maturing because his blood makes
[1:05:57] us perfect by what an offering it says
[1:05:59] in Hebrews he has perfected them forever
[1:06:02] that is sanctified he is by one offering
[1:06:05] he has perfected us in that way so we
[1:06:07] are perfect as in sinless perfection we
[1:06:09] are that way if we walk in the light as
[1:06:12] he is in the light then we have
[1:06:13] fellowship one with another and the
[1:06:14] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:06:16] all sin and if we confess our sins he's
[1:06:20] faithful and just to forgive us it's
[1:06:22] first John right so
[1:06:24] the believer that's walking in the light
[1:06:26] as he is it alight amen
[1:06:28] his blood cleanses you from all sin
[1:06:30] that's why it's so important to walk in
[1:06:33] the word for your day because you have
[1:06:35] fellowship it's not just you were to
[1:06:37] walk in the light you can't walk next to
[1:06:39] it
[1:06:39] you can't just sympathize what you got
[1:06:41] to be in it because he is in that light
[1:06:43] you won't have fellowship with God walk
[1:06:45] in the light for your day that's what
[1:06:47] first John 1:7 says and then he his
[1:06:50] blood cleanse us from all sin and then
[1:06:52] if we confess our sins he's faithful and
[1:06:54] just to forgive us hallelujah and so now
[1:06:58] his blood poor fix us but then there has
[1:07:00] to be a maturing that's why this word
[1:07:03] perfecting actually means to be it
[1:07:04] doesn't talk about being sinlessly
[1:07:06] perfect it means a maturing for the
[1:07:08] perfecting or the maturing of the body
[1:07:11] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:07:14] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:07:16] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:07:18] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:07:20] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:07:22] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:07:25] stature of the fullness of Christ this
[1:07:27] is what we're pressing to be this is
[1:07:30] what we're going to become they meant
[1:07:32] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:07:34] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:07:36] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[1:07:38] men and the cunning craftiness whereby
[1:07:40] they lie in wait to deceive but speaking
[1:07:43] the truth in love may grow up into him
[1:07:46] in all things which is the head even
[1:07:48] Christ from whom the whole body fitly
[1:07:50] joined together and compacted by that
[1:07:53] which every joint supplieth according to
[1:07:55] the effectual working in the measure of
[1:07:57] every part maketh increase of the body
[1:08:00] unto the edifying of itself and love
[1:08:02] this I say therefore and testify in the
[1:08:04] Lord that ye henceforth walk not as
[1:08:07] other Gentiles walk and the vanity of
[1:08:09] their mind having the understanding
[1:08:10] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:08:13] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:08:15] them because of the blindness of their
[1:08:17] heart who being past feeling have given
[1:08:20] themselves under the Sevilla sness to
[1:08:22] work all uncleanness with greediness
[1:08:24] I mean greediness but ye have not so
[1:08:27] learned Christ and you can keep reading
[1:08:30] down he says this is what we're aiming
[1:08:32] to be this is this is what this is the
[1:08:35] mark of the high calling that we will
[1:08:37] grow
[1:08:38] to the fullness it sees into the
[1:08:40] fullness of the the measure of the
[1:08:43] stature of the fullness of Christ this
[1:08:45] is what we're growing into and this is
[1:08:47] what this age is called to become
[1:08:49] hallelujah I'm so glad that that's the
[1:08:51] case this is this is a every individual
[1:08:53] member it's going to grow into the
[1:08:56] measure of the fullness of Christ
[1:08:58] hallelujah
[1:09:00] whatever God dictates that to be I do
[1:09:02] not know but this is what we're called
[1:09:03] to become that's why that's why in this
[1:09:05] age we're not called just to Plato and
[1:09:07] and now we're used to everything and
[1:09:09] this is just how does when Luther came
[1:09:11] by the just shall live by faith
[1:09:13] that's as high as they could live and
[1:09:15] then Wesley came with the second worker
[1:09:17] of grace sanctification they saw they
[1:09:19] believed in justification by faith
[1:09:20] within our sanctified that's as high as
[1:09:22] they could look and then the restoration
[1:09:24] of the gifts just added to that but
[1:09:26] that's as high as they could live but
[1:09:27] now the fullness of the word is open
[1:09:29] Christ is revealed and the fullness of
[1:09:32] his word hallelujah so we don't just
[1:09:35] plateau we're not called the plateau
[1:09:37] we're called the grounds of the fullness
[1:09:38] of his image individually and that's
[1:09:41] what we should be beholding Lord you've
[1:09:44] sent your word and it says it as Jesus
[1:09:46] Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:48] it means we should be holding that
[1:09:50] revelation Lord your word you have
[1:09:52] expressed you in your word and we should
[1:09:55] lay before that and say Lord make us
[1:09:57] into this image amen this remember
[1:10:00] reading the Bible listening to the
[1:10:01] message it's not it's not just trying to
[1:10:03] find find things that make you happy or
[1:10:05] trying to remember it in your mind it
[1:10:08] should you should be laying before it
[1:10:09] prayerfully saying Lord the character
[1:10:12] that's in this book this is a love
[1:10:13] leader this is a love leader this is not
[1:10:16] just Lauzon and different things it's a
[1:10:19] love letter to you and so now as we read
[1:10:21] that love letter should be Lord what
[1:10:23] what you are speaking to me may I become
[1:10:26] may my character be become like this
[1:10:29] word that's what we need to do now
[1:10:34] here's something that I've that really
[1:10:36] struck me the other day now remember
[1:10:40] there's a wounding it will Express
[1:10:43] what's in you remember we have a we have
[1:10:47] this nature it has to stay dead
[1:10:51] amen and so when a wounding comes your
[1:10:53] way what is going to respond is it gonna
[1:10:56] be this guy or is it gonna be him what
[1:10:59] are you gonna let they meant he says now
[1:11:03] I have constantly done in my very best
[1:11:04] to try to and disagreeing with man in
[1:11:07] religious terms but if I couldn't take
[1:11:10] his hand afterwards no matter how sharp
[1:11:11] the thing might be and take a hold of
[1:11:14] his hands and say this is in the light
[1:11:17] of a better understanding between us and
[1:11:18] still love the person not just say it
[1:11:21] from my looks from my heart then I'm no
[1:11:24] subject at all to go out there and try
[1:11:27] to talk to people because see we must do
[1:11:30] that we must love the person see and
[1:11:32] going amongst the people of all kinds of
[1:11:35] classes and different cults and clans
[1:11:37] and religious and so forth and trying to
[1:11:40] lay the Bible down and say let's discuss
[1:11:42] it
[1:11:43] not from your Creed but or from your
[1:11:45] book of ethics but from the Bible and
[1:11:47] then not maybe some time man get real
[1:11:49] sharp but if I got one thought that I
[1:11:54] didn't like that person then I know one
[1:11:56] thing the Spirit of Christ is departed
[1:11:59] from me if I can feel that I don't like
[1:12:01] that person there's something wrong with
[1:12:03] me because the Spirit of Christ when
[1:12:06] they are at crucifying him and his own
[1:12:09] people driving the nails and his very
[1:12:11] creation he created was putting the
[1:12:13] nails that he created back into his
[1:12:15] human flesh and yet with all this heart
[1:12:17] of full of love he cried Father forgive
[1:12:19] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:12:22] you see if I don't like that person I
[1:12:27] know one thing the Spirit of Christ is
[1:12:31] departed from me
[1:12:32] that's a very powerful statement they
[1:12:36] say see if we disagree on religious
[1:12:38] terms and you still don't like the
[1:12:40] person God has departed you have grieved
[1:12:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:12:46] remember there's got to be a wounding
[1:12:48] and that wounding is to express what's
[1:12:50] really in you and if it expresses your
[1:12:53] carnal nature you got to say Lord take
[1:12:55] it from me may it truly be under your
[1:12:58] blood because when I'm wounded when he
[1:13:00] was wounded there was deity that was
[1:13:02] expressed I mean it was only
[1:13:05] getting he could have died an angry man
[1:13:07] he could have died a bitter man he could
[1:13:09] have died or his in for man he came to
[1:13:12] his own his own received him not
[1:13:14] but when it was all said and done he
[1:13:16] said Father forgive them they don't know
[1:13:18] what they do and these were the
[1:13:20] religious people that should have known
[1:13:21] what they are doing they read the
[1:13:22] scripture they knew the prophecy but
[1:13:25] they just rejected him and when he said
[1:13:28] that he truly he truly meant it he
[1:13:31] didn't have one bit of goodness in him
[1:13:33] or resentment or unforgiveness he's
[1:13:39] looking for character friends and he
[1:13:42] will not he will not substitute he will
[1:13:46] not receive something that's half done
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:50] he will only receive his full his
[1:13:54] character now sorry for all the reading
[1:13:58] but I trust this is this means something
[1:13:59] but his own divine character predicted
[1:14:02] this Tabernacle to express himself and
[1:14:04] speaking when he came in his first
[1:14:06] coming and yet he took himself away from
[1:14:10] the great thing that he was and had his
[1:14:12] birth he could have come with a full
[1:14:14] angel salute he could have come with the
[1:14:16] chariots and the angels of heaven but he
[1:14:18] came by the way of a bomb that's his
[1:14:21] love bringing himself down to the lowest
[1:14:23] now you study the that character a
[1:14:26] little bit and then look at yourself and
[1:14:28] I look at myself but that's what he was
[1:14:31] that's who he was and that's the way he
[1:14:35] was to save you he took he became you
[1:14:37] that you might become him he took your
[1:14:40] load of sin therefore when you come when
[1:14:43] we come to meet him we will not have to
[1:14:45] stand we could not stand in the presence
[1:14:48] of God there's not way for one of us to
[1:14:50] do it but when we stand in him he's
[1:14:52] already recognized the sacrifice this is
[1:14:55] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:14:57] he recognized it there was no blemish on
[1:14:59] him and yet he suffered temptation like
[1:15:02] any other man and yet he was scorned he
[1:15:04] was made fun of he was persecuted from
[1:15:07] the hour who is born into the hour that
[1:15:08] he died
[1:15:10] amen wouldn't none of us have suffered
[1:15:13] like him he died with a broken heart he
[1:15:17] was rejected he was despised
[1:15:19] but yet it pleased God to Bruce him it
[1:15:23] pleased God this is pleasing to me and
[1:15:26] he's a man hanging on a cross my God my
[1:15:28] God why has thou forsaken me and if I
[1:15:31] could dramatize a little but there's the
[1:15:33] there's the father in heaven saying this
[1:15:35] pleases me this pleases me to bruise my
[1:15:38] son on the cross his wounding is
[1:15:41] pleasing to me there's what the
[1:15:43] scripture says but it pleased God we
[1:15:45] were in Isaiah 53 it was pleasing and so
[1:15:48] now when you come and you are wounded it
[1:15:52] please God there's a I hope I'm not
[1:15:55] leaning too far but you gotta think it's
[1:15:57] actually pleasing when you go through a
[1:15:58] trial God has allowed that trial and for
[1:16:03] you to express him in that trial that's
[1:16:05] pleasing to God that's pleasing look at
[1:16:07] my workmanship look at my children look
[1:16:10] at my bride she's being crushed she's
[1:16:13] being pressed she's being afflicted this
[1:16:16] is now this may sound strange it's
[1:16:18] pleasing to me because out of that trial
[1:16:22] I'm being expressed out of that trial
[1:16:25] I'm being manifested out of that trial
[1:16:27] I'm being made known hallelujah so it's
[1:16:30] actually a privilege it's actually a
[1:16:32] privilege to be crushed and to be rent
[1:16:35] and to be misunderstood and ill treated
[1:16:37] and it's a privilege because God has
[1:16:40] allowed you gods and trusted you in that
[1:16:42] trial I know when you walk in there
[1:16:45] Amen you'll express me hallelujah
[1:16:47] because you're dead and your life is hid
[1:16:49] in Christ with God Amen now where were
[1:16:57] we
[1:16:57] see there's no okay there's no blemish
[1:17:00] on him yet he suffered temptation like
[1:17:02] any other man and it was he was scorned
[1:17:05] he has made fun of he was persecuted
[1:17:07] from now he was born to the re died and
[1:17:08] yet he returned good for evil you cannot
[1:17:12] no way ever produce a character like
[1:17:15] that only accepting that character in
[1:17:18] you see no man can produce that
[1:17:20] character of Christ and their own
[1:17:22] ability I mean this goes beyond
[1:17:24] psychology and learn behavior this is
[1:17:26] not psychology or learn behavior it's
[1:17:28] when his character his nature comes into
[1:17:30] you
[1:17:32] he says a church cannot do that a creed
[1:17:36] cannot do that a denomination cannot do
[1:17:39] that an education cannot do that it must
[1:17:42] be a birth it's got to be a dying out
[1:17:45] and let God in it by the grace of Christ
[1:17:49] mold this type of character in you that
[1:17:52] you become him and your life and his is
[1:17:55] the same then you are sons and daughters
[1:17:59] of God then when he was going up the
[1:18:01] mountain and his cross was dragging out
[1:18:03] the footprints he says I wish I was an
[1:18:06] artist I wish I could speak so that you
[1:18:08] could mentally paint you a picture of
[1:18:09] Calvary of the most dreaded out of the
[1:18:12] world ever knew and yet they were not
[1:18:14] conscious of what was going on millions
[1:18:16] would are conscious and could I turn
[1:18:19] that pictures of that what I've said
[1:18:20] this week we're entering again a dreaded
[1:18:23] hour a fearful time and Phoenix and I'll
[1:18:26] say in Wellington and the world is
[1:18:28] bathing and the churches is bathing
[1:18:29] themselves and worldly ism and in
[1:18:31] Hollywood showmanship wine out doing the
[1:18:34] other and our members are becoming
[1:18:35] worldly and it seems they don't catch
[1:18:38] the picture and the seriousness and the
[1:18:41] revelation of the appearing of the Son
[1:18:43] of God in this last days amen I just
[1:18:50] find this very striking you say well
[1:18:53] this was 50 years ago this is more
[1:18:55] up-to-date today than it was being this
[1:18:57] is way more up-to-date the world is
[1:18:59] slumbering and sleeping but we know that
[1:19:01] these are people feet see don't be
[1:19:03] caught up on what you see upon this
[1:19:05] earth don't be caught up with the five
[1:19:07] senses what are you becoming what have
[1:19:10] you given yourself to what have you
[1:19:12] really not not consciously
[1:19:13] subconsciously what have you given
[1:19:15] yourself to have you given yourself to
[1:19:17] be made in that image out there or a
[1:19:19] religious image or even given yourself
[1:19:21] he made into his image what have you
[1:19:25] given yourself to see it takes a birth
[1:19:28] education can't do it denomination creat
[1:19:31] a church cannot do it this may sound
[1:19:34] strange but this church cannot do it
[1:19:37] physically that this church cannot make
[1:19:40] you into him it takes him to come home
[1:19:42] super Desha to come and make the word
[1:19:44] alive that's what it required
[1:19:46] him to come and do it his character to
[1:19:49] be injected into you hallelujah that's
[1:19:52] what it has to happen and so now I'm
[1:19:56] gonna read you one more thing because we
[1:19:59] all want to reign with him it's from the
[1:20:05] church age book the Smyrna and church
[1:20:07] age AC is now the reason no way I gotta
[1:20:12] say this first because I seat some
[1:20:14] statements you may find a bit strange
[1:20:16] about how it would please him
[1:20:17] that is bright bride has wounded now his
[1:20:21] love is not like our love for our
[1:20:22] children our love for our children is
[1:20:25] like parental care love which is we want
[1:20:27] to keep them from every hardship
[1:20:29] that's not his love his love is elective
[1:20:31] love his love is elective this is why he
[1:20:34] said before esau jacob aboard he says
[1:20:37] Esau have I hated Jacob have I loved and
[1:20:40] that has brought out through the
[1:20:42] scripture he's before they're born I
[1:20:43] loved one and I didn't love another one
[1:20:45] this is God's choosing so his love for
[1:20:48] you is actually an elective love it's
[1:20:50] not like parental care that's why he
[1:20:52] allows us to go through hardship because
[1:20:55] because as lovers I have chosen you I
[1:20:58] have chosen you that's his election I
[1:21:00] have chosen you and you'll become made
[1:21:03] in my image I will unite myself with you
[1:21:06] you'll be my wife that's his choosing
[1:21:08] that's his choosing that's not your
[1:21:10] choosing many times we think all we we
[1:21:13] received him know he just put something
[1:21:15] on the inside of you to to to search for
[1:21:17] him that says to he put that there first
[1:21:20] and you're just really responding to his
[1:21:22] call I'm glad that that's the case
[1:21:24] because of it was me after him then I
[1:21:27] could just change my own and go
[1:21:28] somewhere else but if it's him drawing
[1:21:30] me and his will is stronger than my will
[1:21:32] Amen his his purpose is way stronger
[1:21:35] than my purpose because his purpose
[1:21:37] doesn't change if he's called me I'm
[1:21:39] going to be there but then I have to
[1:21:41] give myself to that call cuz he gives
[1:21:44] every man a chance he gives every man
[1:21:46] woman or child and we have to respond
[1:21:48] because he does like in the days of Noah
[1:21:51] he says God will not always strive with
[1:21:53] me so it came to an end I'm not striving
[1:21:55] with you anymore
[1:21:56] I've pleaded are big of spoken I've
[1:21:59] given my word
[1:22:00] a living witness of Adam and Eve upon
[1:22:02] the earth and different ones he said I'm
[1:22:04] not gonna strive with you anymore and
[1:22:05] I'm done so there is that part of it but
[1:22:08] if your tea that's why John when he's
[1:22:10] writing me a I think third John he says
[1:22:13] to the elect lady and he's not talking
[1:22:16] to one person he's talking to the body
[1:22:18] of Christ amen so he said well that's
[1:22:22] kind of elitism well maybe it is I don't
[1:22:25] know but if God says I'm elected to walk
[1:22:28] on streets of gold oh I'll take that and
[1:22:31] say thank you I'll just be happy with
[1:22:34] that this is for me hey if you've you
[1:22:35] know it's just like if someone came here
[1:22:37] and said I give you 10 billion dollars
[1:22:39] are you can ride your thermal that's not
[1:22:41] fear what about everyone else you just
[1:22:42] say I'll take that money and I'll use it
[1:22:44] for God's glory
[1:22:45] you won't argue with the person what
[1:22:48] about these people what about this no
[1:22:49] you just say thank you and then go and
[1:22:52] joy
[1:22:53] why don't you that's very natural thing
[1:22:55] but you know same thing with God and his
[1:22:57] election feces here at us his eternal
[1:23:00] life here's my work here's me I'm gonna
[1:23:02] join myself to you you say thank you
[1:23:04] thank you lord I take you I mean I'll be
[1:23:08] your lawfully-wedded wife
[1:23:09] hallelujah and you're in control and
[1:23:12] you're my head and you love me and I
[1:23:13] love you Amen so I'm pretty happy about
[1:23:18] that
[1:23:19] that's a man if that's okay he says now
[1:23:23] why does he stand by the reason is in
[1:23:26] Romans 8 17 and 18 and if children then
[1:23:29] is is of God and joint-heirs with Christ
[1:23:32] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:23:35] may also that we may be also glorified
[1:23:38] together for I reckon that the
[1:23:40] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:23:42] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:23:44] which shall be revealed on us I mean
[1:23:47] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:23:49] reign with him we must suffer to reign
[1:23:51] the reason for this is character simply
[1:23:54] is never made without suffering this is
[1:23:57] a law of God character is never made
[1:24:00] without suffering you have to suffer to
[1:24:02] reign way so character is a victory not
[1:24:05] a gift that's easy to say these words
[1:24:08] but it's true character is a victory you
[1:24:11] actually wouldn't character
[1:24:14] trial you win it but in order to win in
[1:24:18] order to okay I'll just keep reading
[1:24:20] this it's not a gift a man without
[1:24:23] character can train because power
[1:24:25] apart from character is satanic but
[1:24:28] character I mean but power with
[1:24:30] character is fit to rule and since he
[1:24:33] wants us to share even his throne on the
[1:24:36] same basis that he overcame and sit down
[1:24:38] and his Father's throne then we have to
[1:24:40] overcome to sit with him and little
[1:24:43] temporary suffering we go through now is
[1:24:45] not worthy to begin to be compared to
[1:24:49] the tremendous glory that will be
[1:24:51] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[1:24:54] treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:24:56] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:24:57] through much tribulation think it not
[1:25:01] strange concerning the fiery trials
[1:25:03] which are to try you that's what Peter
[1:25:04] said is it strange that God wants us to
[1:25:07] develop a christ-like character that
[1:25:08] comes through suffering no sir and we
[1:25:10] all have trials we are all tried and
[1:25:12] chasing the sons but not one of us but
[1:25:15] not not one but goes through that the
[1:25:19] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:25:22] being tried hasn't got it it doesn't it
[1:25:25] isn't of God hallelujah glory we have a
[1:25:31] bit of hardship we get some speed
[1:25:32] wobbles we kind of are in the gravel
[1:25:35] half of the time things are going bad
[1:25:38] that's of God isn't that isn't that
[1:25:42] wonderful we've got to look beyond human
[1:25:44] because you know and our human mind want
[1:25:46] everything just fine and there's no
[1:25:48] trouble and just a life of ease and you
[1:25:52] know we don't really want that humanly
[1:25:55] we want that we've got to drag this
[1:25:57] thing into a body change your body will
[1:26:00] thank you one of these days but it
[1:26:02] doesn't want to go through these things
[1:26:03] right now but it'll thank you you're not
[1:26:07] schizophrenic but you know what I mean
[1:26:08] just an illustration but this thing
[1:26:10] doesn't want to you know the flesh
[1:26:11] doesn't want to serve God you know
[1:26:14] that's why we used to pander to the sky
[1:26:15] before you were born again but then God
[1:26:17] came and in his his life is stronger
[1:26:21] than this desire of this natural thing
[1:26:26] where was I it isn't of
[1:26:31] no sir so see ya the church that is not
[1:26:34] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[1:26:37] got it it isn't of God Hebrews 12:6 and
[1:26:39] eight for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:26:42] chasteneth and scourges every son which
[1:26:44] receipt he receiveth
[1:26:46] but if you be without chastisement
[1:26:48] whereof all are partakers then you are
[1:26:51] bastards and not sons that's what he
[1:26:53] says because the church says not
[1:26:55] suffering is not of God it hasn't got it
[1:26:58] well because there's a reason now he
[1:27:03] wants you to express him and your
[1:27:06] expressed in the trial I mean he is
[1:27:08] expressed in your trial and in your
[1:27:10] hardship amen and that is when he gets
[1:27:14] glory I want him to get glory don't you
[1:27:17] I want him to be manifested upon the
[1:27:19] earth don't you a man of taro sorrows
[1:27:22] and agony that's who he was
[1:27:24] amen and if he was that way and he was
[1:27:27] acquainted with grief amen no that
[1:27:30] doesn't mean God was never displeased
[1:27:32] with him as a man this is my beloved Son
[1:27:35] in whom I'm well pleased
[1:27:37] this is the God who knows all things he
[1:27:39] was never displeased not a single thing
[1:27:41] he did he was always pleased with him
[1:27:43] but it he is a man of sorrows tears and
[1:27:45] agony and that's the same thing now if
[1:27:48] life is going well or if life is going
[1:27:51] bad that doesn't mean if life is going
[1:27:53] well that doesn't mean God is pleased
[1:27:54] with you and now life is going bad and
[1:27:56] God is displeased with you that's not
[1:27:58] how it works and the good and the bad
[1:28:00] remember God's lovers is constant
[1:28:03] he has fully expressed his love for God
[1:28:06] so loved the world he gave His only
[1:28:07] begotten Son that ever should believe in
[1:28:10] him amen should have eternal life that
[1:28:12] was God's love the fullness of God's I
[1:28:14] was manifested that day on Calvary amen
[1:28:17] and then the reason he sent you elijah
[1:28:19] for the Grainger's will day the Lord
[1:28:21] that's God's love too because there's a
[1:28:23] second part of redemption
[1:28:24] hallelujah this is God's love people say
[1:28:27] God's never love me well we were yet
[1:28:28] sinners he loved us the scripture tells
[1:28:30] us his love doesn't change our love can
[1:28:33] change because it's just human love so
[1:28:35] we try and put that in to God now and
[1:28:37] think well things are going bad
[1:28:39] he must not love me or things are going
[1:28:41] well he must really
[1:28:42] of me now because we're looking through
[1:28:44] human eyes with the go beyond our human
[1:28:46] understanding amen we have some
[1:28:49] musicians just a yeah just now you know
[1:28:52] but we have to go beyond human
[1:28:53] understanding if everything is going
[1:28:55] well he loves me if things that look
[1:28:58] like we're it's all done and
[1:29:01] everything's terrible he loves me if
[1:29:04] it's in between somewhere he loves me
[1:29:06] hallelujah but he allows us to go
[1:29:09] through because he's got to be a
[1:29:10] wounding there's got to be a wounding I
[1:29:13] don't have the quote but you go listen
[1:29:14] to masterpiece and brother Brahim says
[1:29:17] now as as Jesus was the second Adam
[1:29:20] there has to be a second Eve and so now
[1:29:24] the bride is the part of that
[1:29:25] masterpiece we are part of we are God's
[1:29:29] masterpiece this day the bride round the
[1:29:32] world we are part of God's masterpiece
[1:29:34] and just like Michelangelo God was
[1:29:36] molding through through the prophets
[1:29:38] rebuilding a man then finally he had
[1:29:41] Jesus upon the earth and it pleased God
[1:29:44] to bruise him please God to strike him
[1:29:47] that a life would come out now if that's
[1:29:50] the man the woman we'll go through the
[1:29:52] same thing amen because he wants that
[1:29:55] divine nature to come out to be
[1:29:58] expressed and so counted all joy count
[1:30:04] it all joy when you have fiery trials
[1:30:06] and hardship and wounding because God
[1:30:10] wants to be expressed through that
[1:30:11] wounding Amen to bow heads in a word of
[1:30:14] Prayer gracious father Lord this may
[1:30:20] have been very different kind of service
[1:30:21] but father I pray that these things
[1:30:24] would just anchor down in our souls Lord
[1:30:26] please you win Oh Lord when when your
[1:30:31] son went up that day up Calvary Oh Lord
[1:30:33] Jesus when you went up Calvary that day
[1:30:35] it was pleasing for you to be wounded
[1:30:39] that a life would be expressed and
[1:30:42] father we thank you for that wounding
[1:30:44] Lord we needed that wounding Lord that's
[1:30:47] a man you didn't want to go through the
[1:30:49] wounding but you gladly
[1:30:50] there was a joy set before you there was
[1:30:52] us around your throne made in your image
[1:30:56] redeemed sinless and perfect Lord but
[1:30:59] father may we just as we go through life
[1:31:01] now Lord we have to be wounded we are
[1:31:05] like the Rose of Sharon there's like you
[1:31:07] were look as husband and wife or one
[1:31:09] they have to be crushed and molded that
[1:31:11] a fragrance would come forth Lord may we
[1:31:14] just be yielded to you Lord that in
[1:31:17] every situation you would be manifested
[1:31:19] you would be expressed you would be
[1:31:21] declared Oh Lord may we just rejoice
[1:31:25] father Lord that you place us upon the
[1:31:27] earth that you would be manifested to a
[1:31:29] dear and dead and dying world
[1:31:31] and father may one see Jesus and father
