[44:26] we all have a place and when we're in
[44:28] the right atmosphere
[44:30] it's like a flow of river you don't have
[44:32] to make it flow
[44:34] it flows from god amen
[44:37] hallelujah today by the lord's grace
[44:42] we've been led to a thought here and i
[44:45] want to speak
[44:46] on condemnation will
[44:49] not disable me just think about that
[44:53] condemnation will not disable me
[44:58] and you need to believe that you need to
[45:01] have that in your own
[45:02] heart condemnation will not disable me
[45:07] amen guilt will not disable me
[45:10] shame will not disable me my mistakes my
[45:14] shortcomings will not disable me because
[45:17] my god is greater
[45:18] than my problems your god is greater
[45:22] than your problems
[45:23] and he sees a bigger picture than what
[45:26] your heart sees what your mind sees what
[45:27] the devil tells you
[45:29] amen so we're going to speak on that
[45:31] today and i really
[45:32] believe that the lord has given us
[45:36] a blessing amen hallelujah because it's
[45:39] him amen
[45:41] amen turn to revelation chapter one with
[45:43] me please
[45:44] and then we'll go to romans 8 1.
[45:49] oh my i feel his presence my goodness
[45:54] wow i might as well get the water ready
[46:02] in the towel hallelujah it is summer
[46:05] right
[46:06] does anyone believe that hallelujah
[46:10] my goodness my snowing
[46:14] in summer okay well
[46:17] that brings the gets the conspiracy
[46:19] theorists going doesn't it
[46:20] what are they doing to our weather
[46:24] oh my we won't go down that route though
[46:26] will we amen revelation chapter 1 verse
[46:28] 5 and it says here
[46:30] and from jesus christ who is the
[46:33] faithful witness
[46:35] and the first begotten of the dead
[46:38] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[46:44] unto him that loved us
[46:47] and washed us from our sins
[46:51] in his own blood hallelujah
[46:54] amen and romans 8 1 it says there
[47:00] say amen when you're there amen
[47:03] there is there for now
[47:07] and i've underlined now and if there was
[47:08] a powerpoint it would be bold and
[47:10] underlined
[47:10] there is therefore now no condemnation
[47:15] to them which are in christ jesus who
[47:18] walk not after the flesh
[47:20] but after the spirit may the lord add
[47:23] his blessings to the reading of his word
[47:25] you may be seated hallelujah
[47:30] condemnation will not disable me
[47:33] and you see this is a big problem
[47:37] that we face anyone that's got an
[47:39] element of sincerity in their life
[47:42] will struggle in some way shape or form
[47:46] with condemnation or maybe disablement
[47:49] because of something else that's related
[47:51] to condemnation
[47:52] or related to your own humanity you see
[47:55] it's our humanity
[47:58] that gets us down there's gifts in our
[48:01] lives
[48:02] there's offices there's callings major
[48:04] callings minor calling doesn't matter
[48:05] they're all callings
[48:06] and they all play a part in god's great
[48:09] scheme
[48:09] his great plan of redemption and
[48:13] see these gifts and this is where we run
[48:16] into the challenge right
[48:18] and the challenges that that gift is
[48:20] placed in here
[48:22] right and what surrounds that
[48:26] this and this is the problem the
[48:29] challenge
[48:30] but remember god is greater than our
[48:32] problems
[48:33] god sees a bigger picture god's not
[48:36] small fry
[48:37] you know he doesn't get he's not going
[48:39] to get into all entangled up
[48:41] and petty about a little issue in your
[48:43] life
[48:44] now before i go too much further i don't
[48:46] want to
[48:47] come across in this service because it
[48:49] may do but we'll try and
[48:51] by the lord's help stay balanced but we
[48:54] don't want to condone
[48:55] sin right grace is not a bandage for our
[48:58] sinfulness
[48:59] grace is the power to overcome that
[49:03] grace will look beyond the grace will go
[49:05] you know what i know you're in a
[49:07] very bad condition right now i know that
[49:08] you're doing all of these things
[49:10] but i don't want you to stay condemned i
[49:12] don't want you to be beaten down
[49:14] by a proud boastful devil huh
[49:18] i want you to be walking with me through
[49:21] it all
[49:23] and so do you see the lord he overlooks
[49:26] these well he doesn't overlook it he
[49:29] deals with it
[49:30] but he has to overlook things to deal
[49:32] with it and he has a program
[49:34] he has a schedule amen and our schedule
[49:38] is
[49:38] this one then this one then this one
[49:40] then this one just deal with it all lord
[49:41] actually i want to go to camp and i want
[49:42] all my problems gone
[49:44] i want to leave camp perfect but the law
[49:46] says hold on a minute
[49:47] no i'm going to deal with that there and
[49:49] i'm going to time that one and then that
[49:50] one
[49:51] and i'm going to leave that there
[49:52] because that's going to play a purpose
[49:53] seven years down the track you're going
[49:55] to fail there and it's going to cause a
[49:56] revival over there or whatever
[49:58] we don't understand why but he does
[50:02] you see we're just in the infantry amen
[50:05] you know we're just fighting in the on
[50:06] the front line
[50:07] hallelujah and sometimes we're fighting
[50:09] in the
[50:10] in the down at the back you know
[50:12] sometimes we get beaten down
[50:14] you know the devil comes down he just
[50:16] says no but you can't operate under
[50:18] god's supernatural
[50:19] because you did this you're doing this
[50:22] you struggle with this
[50:23] you're having problems with that god
[50:26] can't use you
[50:28] but i'm going to share with you yes he
[50:30] can
[50:31] god can use you he'll use you
[50:34] right as you are but what he's looking
[50:37] for
[50:39] is the right mental attitude
[50:43] he's looking for the right motive
[50:47] there's certain prerequisite
[50:50] requirements
[50:51] and one of them but not one of those
[50:54] requirements is
[50:55] a perfect life perfect behavior
[50:59] okay does everyone is everyone following
[51:02] amen amen i pray that the lord
[51:06] will liberate and enable
[51:10] because grace is an enabling power that
[51:13] is it's not subject to our behavior it's
[51:15] not based on our merit
[51:17] it's unmerited favor it's unmerited help
[51:21] to to enable us to operate
[51:24] in a supernatural experience
[51:27] so that we can change people's lives by
[51:30] the god that's inside us
[51:32] despite ourselves despite our humanity
[51:36] because we're worthless humanity all the
[51:37] way through and little by little we'll
[51:39] get deliverance of different things and
[51:41] we'll get mastery over the elements
[51:42] right
[51:43] adam when he was in his unfallen
[51:46] condition
[51:46] he had mastery over the elements of the
[51:48] earth the reason he had
[51:50] mastery over the elements of the earth
[51:53] is because he had mastery over the
[51:55] elements of his own earth
[51:56] because he wasn't fallen and therefore
[51:58] god couldn't trust him
[52:00] with that godness that power
[52:03] to have mastery over the elements and he
[52:05] could just speak and these things would
[52:06] happen
[52:07] because he could be trusted with it but
[52:09] the moment that he fell and became
[52:11] subject
[52:12] to the elements of his earth in a fallen
[52:15] condition
[52:16] god couldn't trust him with that power
[52:19] anymore amen
[52:25] let's go to 1 john 3 verses 19
[52:30] to 24. and i ask you this question
[52:36] do you want god's supernatural power
[52:40] to flow through your uncondemned
[52:44] life i put that there i wrote that down
[52:49] do you want god's supernatural presence
[52:53] his unction do you want that does
[52:56] everyone want that
[52:57] do you desire that hey man well as you
[53:01] see
[53:02] even that desire makes you a candidate
[53:05] for it
[53:07] i just it's actually the more i when i
[53:09] see that of this thought's been with me
[53:11] for
[53:11] for quite a few years and but it just
[53:14] became you know
[53:14] things get illuminated at different
[53:16] seasons and and then i realized how much
[53:19] this theme was in the message and
[53:21] through the scriptures and
[53:24] it's amazing how god can use anyone
[53:28] how much more the redeemed bride
[53:32] now we're no different in the flesh
[53:35] to any of these people that god's used
[53:37] throughout time
[53:39] but it's because of the covenant of god
[53:41] that gives god the liberty
[53:44] right and when we realize
[53:47] now i want to get ahead of myself but
[53:49] when we realize that god can use us
[53:52] even if we fail 10 minutes ago
[53:55] and you just make it right you don't
[53:57] have to have a guilt trip
[53:59] you have to stay guilty for a while it's
[54:01] finished
[54:02] and he can use you because your heart is
[54:04] now in an atmosphere
[54:06] it's all about an atmosphere that's
[54:08] going on inside you
[54:10] and that even right now there might be
[54:12] somebody in this room
[54:14] that's got a negative atmosphere going
[54:15] on inside them because of something
[54:17] that's happened
[54:18] all you need to do right now in your is
[54:21] just say lord forgive me
[54:22] help me lord you know i i don't want to
[54:24] have that
[54:26] you all automatically can come straight
[54:28] back into an atmosphere
[54:30] where god can use and operate in your
[54:32] life
[54:33] so here in one john 3 19 to 24 it says
[54:36] and hereby we know that we are of the
[54:38] truth
[54:39] and shall assure our hearts before him
[54:42] for if our
[54:43] heart condemn us
[54:48] god is greater than our heart oh my
[54:51] life that's liberating in itself if
[54:55] our heart condemn us god is greater than
[54:58] our heart
[54:59] and knoweth all things he knows the
[55:01] bigger picture
[55:02] he knows what is what is your life about
[55:06] what is the projection of yourself what
[55:09] do you want in life
[55:10] no one wants to just struggle along and
[55:13] and fail all the time perhaps
[55:15] but we do we do we don't want to do that
[55:19] if you want to do that
[55:20] i'm not talking to those people okay
[55:22] those are out
[55:23] that's not but there is grace for those
[55:25] people too
[55:26] there's grace for everybody right but
[55:28] i'm addressing the people today
[55:30] this was a little bit further down but
[55:32] i'm addressing the people
[55:34] who actually want to please the lord who
[55:37] want to do right for him
[55:39] but struggle and they feel like they
[55:42] can't because they get
[55:43] beaten down by condemnation by guilt by
[55:45] fear
[55:46] by by these attributes of unbelief and
[55:49] sin
[55:50] which is not even their portion it's not
[55:53] our portion
[55:54] right it's not our portion that's why
[55:56] that body of sin was destroyed when
[55:58] christ went down into hell
[56:00] and preached to the lost it said that
[56:02] body of sin would be destroyed and it is
[56:04] destroyed
[56:05] and it's just hovering just behind you
[56:07] that old nature in a rendered state of
[56:10] disablement but what it wants is that
[56:12] wants to be enabled that wants to take
[56:14] over that wants to actually
[56:16] rule and so that your old nature teams
[56:19] up with the devil
[56:20] to try and bring you down because when
[56:23] you
[56:24] are under a condemnation when you find
[56:27] yourself in a state of guilt
[56:29] there's no faith there you can't have
[56:32] faith
[56:33] and therefore there's no supernatural
[56:35] there's no grace
[56:37] really there is grace because you're not
[56:39] going to hell
[56:40] or anything for it it just means that
[56:41] you're rendered useless really i'm sorry
[56:44] to use plain terms but
[56:46] and that was going to be the title was
[56:48] condemnation
[56:49] will not make me useless but i thought
[56:51] well it's a bit too much but
[56:53] you become when there's fear inside you
[56:56] and when there's
[56:57] doubts inside you and it's all not
[56:59] necessary it doesn't have to remain that
[57:01] way
[57:02] there is a real condemnations conviction
[57:04] of the spirit right
[57:05] and you make it right and the devil can
[57:07] condemn you and you can condemn you and
[57:09] oh my
[57:10] it just puts you down into a state and
[57:13] when you're in that state you become
[57:14] useless
[57:15] supernaturally you might be a great help
[57:17] in the church you might do all these
[57:19] good things
[57:20] for people and arms deeds and all of
[57:22] that to help people
[57:24] and you may be a great musician or a
[57:25] great this or that or whatever
[57:27] preacher at all but supernaturally
[57:32] that's the key to our victory
[57:35] it's faith and it's it's this is the
[57:39] most it's so
[57:39] simple it's so easy it's not hard it's
[57:42] all been provided for
[57:44] so that we can be in an atmosphere of
[57:46] faith in the midst of our own
[57:48] human dysfunction we
[57:51] god had to make it that way he knew that
[57:53] we would be
[57:55] struggling with this and he knew that he
[57:57] would have a program
[57:58] that little by little those things would
[58:00] be overcome
[58:02] but not all at once otherwise you would
[58:04] not be able
[58:06] by character and experience to handle
[58:09] what adam had before the fall
[58:10] right so he will little by little
[58:13] give you the mastery of the elements of
[58:17] the earth
[58:18] this clay and your spirit right little
[58:22] by little you will
[58:23] gain those things so it says for if our
[58:25] heart condemns not god
[58:27] is greater than our heart and knoweth
[58:30] all things
[58:31] beloved if our heart condemn us not
[58:34] then have we confidence toward god you
[58:38] see
[58:38] the moment that condemnation's dealt
[58:40] with and it can be dealt with very
[58:42] easily
[58:43] it's not a groveling thing it's not a
[58:45] catholic idea of
[58:46] you've got to do penance and go on and
[58:49] on and on god finally
[58:50] forgives you right no it's it's the law
[58:53] just
[58:53] if you just make it right right then and
[58:56] there
[58:57] the moment it's brought to your
[58:58] attention i was wrong i'm sorry lord
[59:00] forgive me
[59:02] condemnation guilt all the tactics of
[59:05] the enemy
[59:06] to render you useless as null and void
[59:10] and you are now a candidate where the
[59:13] supernatural
[59:14] can manifest in your life again whether
[59:17] you're three or whether you're
[59:18] 63 or however old
[59:22] right wherever we're at whatever age
[59:25] we're at
[59:26] we're free and the supernatural can
[59:29] operate because
[59:30] faith is in the vessel and that's what
[59:33] changes the whole atmosphere
[59:35] and it's little things that niggle at us
[59:38] and things that people do and do to us
[59:40] and whatever
[59:40] that can block up those channels but the
[59:43] moment those things are dealt with the
[59:45] moment that you put them right
[59:47] now god can work in your life now
[59:50] when you pray things start to happen
[59:53] hallelujah this is disabling the devil
[59:56] i i pray that he gets really disabled
[59:58] today really disabled
[1:00:01] i mean he's already disabled but let's
[1:00:03] make him any more disabled
[1:00:05] you know because his the only ability he
[1:00:07] has is lies
[1:00:09] and he lies to us he says you can't do
[1:00:12] this because of that
[1:00:13] and you can say yes i can because of the
[1:00:15] blood
[1:00:16] the blood's there amen there's a song
[1:00:19] it's called the blood is still there
[1:00:21] and it's an old good oldie and i can't
[1:00:23] sing it but
[1:00:24] it's a real good song the blood is still
[1:00:28] there
[1:00:29] who's glad for the blood still there you
[1:00:32] know it says in the opening scripture
[1:00:34] his blood cleanses us from our sins
[1:00:37] not our sin sin was dealt with at
[1:00:40] calvary in your first
[1:00:41] moment that you accepted christ but our
[1:00:44] sins
[1:00:45] plural is our behaviors as our
[1:00:47] shortcomings as our failures as all of
[1:00:49] those things that we keep doing over and
[1:00:51] over
[1:00:51] and we think the more i do it the
[1:00:52] further i get from god no
[1:00:54] it's not you can't get any further
[1:00:57] you're already connected
[1:01:00] the devil comes to you and says yo you
[1:01:01] did this and you did that so you can't
[1:01:03] do this
[1:01:04] but you can just make it right just say
[1:01:06] lord i'm sorry
[1:01:07] oh forgive me 70 times he said 70 times
[1:01:10] 7.
[1:01:12] not them if if god says 70 times 7
[1:01:17] you can't do 490 bad things in a day i'm
[1:01:20] sure about it
[1:01:21] but even if you did 500 he'll still
[1:01:23] forgive each
[1:01:24] single one of them because he said that
[1:01:28] amen he said that so be enabled
[1:01:33] don't let fear don't let condemnation
[1:01:34] don't let guilt
[1:01:36] keep you on the ground you're an eagle
[1:01:38] you can fly
[1:01:39] hallelujah
[1:01:44] 22 it says and whatsoever we ask we
[1:01:47] receive of him because we keep his
[1:01:49] commandments
[1:01:50] so hang on now we want to see what this
[1:01:52] means and do those things which are
[1:01:54] pleasing in this site
[1:01:56] so here as you read this we're going to
[1:01:58] get a we're going to have a devil on
[1:02:00] this shoulder an angel on that shoulder
[1:02:02] because the devil will say see you've
[1:02:04] got to keep the law you've got to keep
[1:02:05] everything that he says you've got to be
[1:02:06] perfect you've got to live right then
[1:02:08] he'll hear your prayers
[1:02:09] that's not right that's out of balance
[1:02:10] that's legalism
[1:02:12] that's that's legalism on the other side
[1:02:15] you have an angel you have the truth
[1:02:17] which says
[1:02:18] this and this
[1:02:23] underline and capital please is his
[1:02:26] commandment
[1:02:27] that we should believe on the name of
[1:02:29] his son
[1:02:30] jesus christ and love one another
[1:02:33] oh my it's coming right back to the
[1:02:36] greatest theme of our life and of our
[1:02:38] fellowship here
[1:02:40] love amen divine love
[1:02:43] it's all about atmosphere and love
[1:02:46] covers a multitude of
[1:02:48] sins so not only do we need to deal with
[1:02:51] condemnation in our own life
[1:02:52] but it's now to deal with condemnation
[1:02:55] or from
[1:02:56] our opinion of other people's lives
[1:02:59] you know what i mean because we can look
[1:03:01] and yes it's we can justly say there's a
[1:03:03] fail there's a fail
[1:03:04] that's wrong that's wrong right but love
[1:03:07] covers a multitude of that
[1:03:09] because when we realize that love covers
[1:03:12] a multitude
[1:03:13] of sins right the failures the mistakes
[1:03:16] the shortcomings of each other
[1:03:18] we can see the bigger picture and become
[1:03:22] just like god who's greater than our
[1:03:23] heart
[1:03:24] who's not small fry but he's big fry
[1:03:28] i'm just using colloquial terms
[1:03:31] he's big fry he sees the bigger picture
[1:03:33] he's like you know what yes
[1:03:34] but look at that and look what i've done
[1:03:37] and the devil says they're guilty god
[1:03:39] says no
[1:03:41] no they're not no because i've got my
[1:03:43] blood over them
[1:03:44] i've got a purpose for them and i need
[1:03:47] them to operate in the supernatural
[1:03:49] i need prophecies to unfold i need
[1:03:51] tongues and interpretation
[1:03:53] i need the gifts to operate i need the
[1:03:55] pastors to pass i need the dads to dad i
[1:03:58] need the monster mum
[1:04:00] supernaturally there's nothing like a
[1:04:03] good
[1:04:04] mother that knows what their children
[1:04:06] are doing behind their back
[1:04:07] and can say hey i know what you've done
[1:04:10] and then the child's like whoa
[1:04:12] how do they know that because i saw it
[1:04:14] in a vision
[1:04:15] i saw it in a dream this is a
[1:04:17] supernatural mum
[1:04:19] it's better than a natural mum that just
[1:04:20] tries to lay down the law and smack down
[1:04:22] and try and push it down but
[1:04:23] what about a prophetic mom amen what
[1:04:26] about a prophetic dad
[1:04:28] you can be and we are that because we're
[1:04:31] in a prophetic age
[1:04:32] it doesn't make us that we're prophets
[1:04:34] but we are in a prophetic age under a
[1:04:36] prophetic anointing
[1:04:37] to operate at the what's the word
[1:04:41] the very peak of god's church
[1:04:44] the very capstone of all that christ
[1:04:47] is and all the revelation of who he is
[1:04:51] to be given to his church we're not in a
[1:04:54] reforming age anymore
[1:04:55] we're not in the restoration agenda
[1:04:57] we're in a restored age
[1:04:59] under divine love it's beyond all of
[1:05:02] that now
[1:05:03] we all individually wherever we're at
[1:05:05] but the age is coming out into the
[1:05:07] rapture now
[1:05:08] we're going to be taking off the earth
[1:05:09] soon living
[1:05:12] so let's deal with condemnation not in
[1:05:15] only in ourselves now but in others as
[1:05:17] well
[1:05:18] because you see what does that provide
[1:05:21] what it does is it provides
[1:05:22] an atmosphere the moment that we get
[1:05:25] into an atmosphere of condemnation
[1:05:27] is and do not condemnation is a strong
[1:05:30] disapproval
[1:05:31] a strong disapproval i looked it up
[1:05:35] and so yeah we can strongly disapprove
[1:05:36] of behaviors in ourself and others
[1:05:38] but are we going to let that destroy the
[1:05:42] atmosphere in the church
[1:05:43] are we going to let that destroy the
[1:05:44] atmosphere and fellowship in our homes
[1:05:46] are we going to let that destroy the
[1:05:48] atmosphere and our parenting are we
[1:05:50] going to let that destroy the atmosphere
[1:05:52] in our workplace no love covers a
[1:05:55] multitude of sins
[1:05:56] for a purpose and that's why brother
[1:05:59] branhammy says when he got taken over
[1:06:01] into
[1:06:01] but beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:06:03] was shown the saints in eternity and he
[1:06:06] came back he says
[1:06:07] lay aside everything until you have
[1:06:09] perfect love
[1:06:11] lay aside everything
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:14] it's just it just pales in comparison
[1:06:17] and here we see it
[1:06:20] we see you know we want favor with god
[1:06:23] we want to walk with god we want to be
[1:06:24] in a supernatural condition
[1:06:27] here it is believe on the name
[1:06:30] of his son jesus christ we know what the
[1:06:32] name is right
[1:06:33] the name is the uh it's
[1:06:37] an identity of his legacy
[1:06:40] what he stands for his inheritance
[1:06:43] and the revelation of his word
[1:06:48] that's the it's the i am right
[1:06:53] believe it's so simple
[1:06:56] and you'll be fought for that and
[1:06:58] condemnation and guilt
[1:07:00] and all these tactics of the enemy he's
[1:07:03] a leverage you know
[1:07:04] he levers off certain things that you go
[1:07:06] through he leaves off your failures and
[1:07:08] mistakes
[1:07:09] and when you're down in the dumps and
[1:07:10] you've gone through something and you
[1:07:11] just miserably done something wrong
[1:07:13] and you you're down there and then he
[1:07:15] says see god's not real
[1:07:16] god doesn't exist right there when
[1:07:18] you're negative
[1:07:20] you know when there's negativity going
[1:07:22] on inside
[1:07:23] and he just says that especially the
[1:07:24] young people anyone that's not born
[1:07:25] again
[1:07:26] you know and even people that are born
[1:07:28] again i mean he still tries it on me
[1:07:31] he still tries it i'm like are you
[1:07:32] serious come on devil
[1:07:34] honestly really mate he doesn't give up
[1:07:38] hey
[1:07:39] he doesn't give up he's a 24-hour devil
[1:07:42] but we have a
[1:07:43] 28-hour god amen he's an eternal god
[1:07:48] he's bigger than 24-hour devil amen and
[1:07:51] when we get caught up in a small fright
[1:07:53] condition
[1:07:54] in a small-minded condition then we
[1:07:57] realize that god's greater than that
[1:07:59] condemnation shall not disable me
[1:08:03] condemnation will not disable you
[1:08:06] you shall not be disabled by your
[1:08:09] failures
[1:08:11] this condemnation or you will not be
[1:08:13] disabled
[1:08:15] from your ministry from your calling
[1:08:18] from operating in a supernatural
[1:08:20] because his blood is there
[1:08:23] and you believe on the name of a son
[1:08:27] and you love and if you're struggling
[1:08:30] with love
[1:08:31] you know it may be a family trait it may
[1:08:34] be
[1:08:35] well we never know there's many hurts
[1:08:37] that happen right
[1:08:38] whatever it may be today is the day
[1:08:42] for you to really lay that down at the
[1:08:45] cross
[1:08:47] you know we don't have to have a big
[1:08:48] glorious camp meeting for this it can
[1:08:50] happen right now
[1:08:52] right when it's all warm and toasty
[1:08:54] right up in the you know we
[1:08:56] these things might come down into your
[1:08:57] very home
[1:08:59] and i don't i've got no personal
[1:09:00] ambition against anybody
[1:09:02] and whatever comes we'll just say it
[1:09:05] right
[1:09:06] and there's nothing personal but if it
[1:09:08] does come to your home
[1:09:09] then you just say lord here i am this is
[1:09:11] easy eh
[1:09:12] right no one's against anybody you know
[1:09:15] we're all in a battle right
[1:09:16] we're fighting together we're fighting
[1:09:18] the devil hallelujah
[1:09:21] amen amen so you see now this love
[1:09:24] is so important especially now
[1:09:28] you know back in the days when the lord
[1:09:30] was dealing with
[1:09:31] um you know in the lutheran days and
[1:09:35] the early reformers he was dealing with
[1:09:38] justification
[1:09:39] he was tired of people trying to earn
[1:09:41] their salvation
[1:09:43] you know the lord around luther and
[1:09:46] zwingli and all of those reformation
[1:09:48] times
[1:09:49] it was all about i'm justified by faith
[1:09:52] but their life didn't change
[1:09:54] but god was dealing with that they were
[1:09:56] probably horrible to each other
[1:09:58] i mean they probably had some good times
[1:09:59] too but there wasn't a real change in
[1:10:02] the way
[1:10:02] in that love and then as the ages moved
[1:10:04] on and as denominational tree grew and
[1:10:07] all these different things started to
[1:10:09] open up and different moves of god he
[1:10:11] was dealing in those
[1:10:13] capacities but now now he's calling his
[1:10:17] church
[1:10:18] to perfect love he's calling us to love
[1:10:21] like never before and if he's calling us
[1:10:24] to love like never before
[1:10:25] that means that there's a provision to
[1:10:27] make us love like never before he never
[1:10:30] calls of people without anointing them
[1:10:32] he never calls of people without
[1:10:33] providing
[1:10:35] and he actually comes
[1:10:38] i always you know i'm some
[1:10:41] you know i need a bible because anyone
[1:10:43] got an actual
[1:10:46] there is always a use for the paper
[1:10:48] bible you know that just doesn't work
[1:10:50] the same
[1:10:51] you know the lord has come in this
[1:10:54] generation
[1:10:56] and for all generations he's given
[1:10:59] the bible's been there and there's been
[1:11:01] portions of it revealed
[1:11:03] to different people different reformers
[1:11:05] different restorers different ministries
[1:11:07] and different moves of god
[1:11:08] each denomination they had you know most
[1:11:10] a lot of them the ones that god actually
[1:11:13] um used the leaders of you know he would
[1:11:15] give a portion
[1:11:16] but in the end time in the end time
[1:11:19] the lord would come in his fullness of
[1:11:21] his presence and he would open the whole
[1:11:23] thing and say here
[1:11:24] i'm going to provide for you the way
[1:11:27] that
[1:11:27] you can love i'm going to reveal my name
[1:11:31] and not just my name but your name
[1:11:33] actually i'm going to take you
[1:11:35] which is in this and i'm going to open
[1:11:36] you and you're going to know
[1:11:39] and you're going to be there with me and
[1:11:41] the inheritance
[1:11:43] i'm going to read it out to you every
[1:11:44] sunday every wednesday
[1:11:46] on the tapes i'm going to read my
[1:11:47] inheritance out to you and you're going
[1:11:49] to receive that by faith
[1:11:50] believing on the name of his son right
[1:11:53] this is what it's about
[1:11:55] it's not just i believe that his name is
[1:11:57] jesus that's
[1:11:58] that's just a title but believing on the
[1:12:01] name
[1:12:02] is deeper it's greater you're believing
[1:12:05] on the inheritance that he's reading out
[1:12:06] to you and he's shining his light
[1:12:08] and he's making it personal to you and
[1:12:10] some things you may not understand but
[1:12:12] you say i believe it lord
[1:12:13] reveal it to me let a transaction take
[1:12:16] place
[1:12:17] what's that that is absolving you
[1:12:21] from all your condemnation that's
[1:12:24] absolving you
[1:12:26] from all your guilt or your fear
[1:12:29] or your pain or your worry all your
[1:12:32] uncertainty or your anxiety or your
[1:12:34] depression
[1:12:36] which is a result of all of those things
[1:12:39] if anyone feels emotionally disconnected
[1:12:41] this morning
[1:12:43] there is an inheritance in here to
[1:12:45] reconnect
[1:12:47] human spirits back to their
[1:12:51] where they belong because we can
[1:12:53] disconnect
[1:12:54] and it's a that's a natural thing to
[1:12:57] happen if someone is going through
[1:12:59] consistent turmoil in their mind
[1:13:02] stress mental strain
[1:13:06] there's the reason that what happens is
[1:13:08] you go through that for too long your
[1:13:10] body says you know what
[1:13:11] i'm not liking these chemicals in the
[1:13:12] bloodstream right now all these hormones
[1:13:14] that are just so negative all the time
[1:13:16] that just flips off the switch you
[1:13:18] become disconnected
[1:13:20] it takes a while to get back but there's
[1:13:23] a grace in this room
[1:13:24] we we serve a god who can reconnect
[1:13:27] emotions
[1:13:28] amen hallelujah you know we go through
[1:13:31] trials
[1:13:32] and you might go through condemnation
[1:13:35] i'm not saying that the condom going
[1:13:37] through condemnation is fine it's what
[1:13:38] you do with it
[1:13:40] it's meant to get you to your knees it's
[1:13:42] meant to bring you straight to your
[1:13:43] knees and say lord
[1:13:44] i'm sorry i did that but if you don't
[1:13:48] and the devil beats you down and you
[1:13:49] feel like you can't even talk to god
[1:13:51] you're in a crippled state and it's in
[1:13:54] that state
[1:13:55] where he starts to get you further and
[1:13:57] further and entrenched in troubles
[1:14:02] so i just want to ask this question is
[1:14:03] there somebody in here
[1:14:05] that desires to serve god
[1:14:10] everybody desires to serve god you know
[1:14:12] there is a real
[1:14:14] just that just that little desire is all
[1:14:16] we need
[1:14:18] we can work with that little desire you
[1:14:20] know i mean there's probably you know
[1:14:22] people in here
[1:14:23] young fellas whatever i don't know and
[1:14:25] i'm not going to say what people think
[1:14:27] but
[1:14:28] there's people maybe on the stream i
[1:14:30] don't know that
[1:14:32] they've got a bigger desire for some
[1:14:33] other stuff right
[1:14:35] bigger desire for cars or a bigger
[1:14:37] desire for job work
[1:14:39] school life whatever there's a bigger
[1:14:41] desire for that
[1:14:42] than there is for god but even that
[1:14:45] little desire
[1:14:46] for god that's treasure
[1:14:49] you know there might be 99 desire
[1:14:52] for football or rugby right
[1:14:55] and one percent for god god can use that
[1:14:58] one percent
[1:14:59] and we're gonna capitalize on that one
[1:15:01] percent today so if anybody in here
[1:15:03] has got one percent only just one
[1:15:06] percent
[1:15:07] let's capitalize on that one percent you
[1:15:10] like that boy that gave us lunch
[1:15:12] he had five bars five loaves and two
[1:15:15] fishes or whatever he had
[1:15:16] and it fed five thousand people right
[1:15:18] just a tiny little thing
[1:15:19] maybe there's a thin thread left
[1:15:23] a thin thread left of desire for god
[1:15:26] today god will use that desire
[1:15:29] hallelujah amen
[1:15:30] to remove all condemnation to remove all
[1:15:33] fear to
[1:15:33] remove all the bondage and anything that
[1:15:35] holds you down so you can become a queen
[1:15:37] a king
[1:15:38] again and operate where you're meant to
[1:15:43] oh my we're eternal people right we
[1:15:45] never began and will never end
[1:15:47] in god's mind we were already there and
[1:15:49] somehow in his mind we're worshiping
[1:15:51] already
[1:15:52] in eternity okay now that's a very big
[1:15:54] thing to swallow but this is our reality
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:56] because it didn't begin so when we get
[1:15:59] there we'll we'll
[1:16:00] experience an unbeginning experience
[1:16:02] [Laughter]
[1:16:04] we'll experience something that never
[1:16:06] begun but because we began on the earth
[1:16:08] and because we were born and we started
[1:16:10] and we're going to end
[1:16:11] if we the lord tarries you see we we
[1:16:14] think of ourselves as
[1:16:16] beginning but no and so right now you
[1:16:20] may be going through stuff you may not
[1:16:21] even be wanting to listen to me
[1:16:23] you know i don't know some people now
[1:16:27] you're gonna you're shouting in heaven
[1:16:30] right now
[1:16:31] amen shouting if there's a little desire
[1:16:35] i want you to just offer that little
[1:16:37] desire that thread
[1:16:38] to god now i don't believe i believe
[1:16:41] that you know there's people in here
[1:16:42] that it's just
[1:16:43] they're just overflowing with desire to
[1:16:45] serve god right
[1:16:47] but i'm but we've got to we've got to
[1:16:49] find that thread as well
[1:16:51] because you see that thread is so
[1:16:53] important
[1:16:54] if that thread's not there there's big
[1:16:56] trouble
[1:16:57] that's the worst condition a human can
[1:16:59] ever be in is to have no desire to serve
[1:17:01] god
[1:17:02] now i'm not talking about having a child
[1:17:04] having a tantrum
[1:17:06] i don't want to serve god in one arm but
[1:17:08] if you take that child and when they're
[1:17:09] in their nice condition and they're
[1:17:11] happy they'll want to serve the lord
[1:17:13] right because they're
[1:17:14] but because the children's emotions are
[1:17:16] on their sleeve whatever's
[1:17:18] triggering that right now is just up and
[1:17:20] down and up and down and all my
[1:17:22] you know you know how it is but
[1:17:25] that thin thread let's work with that
[1:17:26] let's capitalize on that today and and
[1:17:30] the big thread
[1:17:31] in the rope three cut three quartered
[1:17:33] rope who's got a three-quarter rope
[1:17:35] a big rope lord jesus oh
[1:17:38] you just want to worship him and serve
[1:17:41] him you see that
[1:17:42] and you know you've got that right it's
[1:17:45] just such a desire such a longing
[1:17:47] there's no way that condemnation can
[1:17:50] stick to you
[1:17:51] there's no way that fear can stay on you
[1:17:54] there's no way that you can remain
[1:17:55] guilty
[1:17:56] hallelujah there's no way that you can
[1:17:58] stay disabled
[1:18:00] it's impossible to keep you disabled
[1:18:02] impossible to keep you on the ground as
[1:18:04] a natural christian
[1:18:06] impossible because you desire god
[1:18:09] oh my let's read i'm going to read this
[1:18:11] quote here it's very powerful
[1:18:13] it's one i'm actually probably you know
[1:18:14] this stood out for me one of the
[1:18:16] greatest quotes that's ever stood out
[1:18:18] for me
[1:18:19] says here and look at that little
[1:18:23] old ill-famed woman the woman at the
[1:18:27] well
[1:18:28] she recognized it she wasn't
[1:18:31] undocumented or indoctrinated i believe
[1:18:34] he was talking about
[1:18:37] she was morally wrong of course no one
[1:18:40] would endorse that
[1:18:43] you know we find ourselves maybe we're
[1:18:45] morally wrong
[1:18:46] we're doing something completely morally
[1:18:49] wrong
[1:18:50] you know and we think oh my this is just
[1:18:52] so bad i can't even go to church anymore
[1:18:54] i can't i can't be
[1:18:55] i can't operate i feel like i'm just a
[1:18:58] hypocrite
[1:18:59] god is greater than that god is greater
[1:19:02] than
[1:19:02] all sin he's greater than our heart
[1:19:06] he just wants he just said just make it
[1:19:08] right and come and follow me
[1:19:10] i'll deal with those things there's a
[1:19:12] time when that will be dealt with
[1:19:14] and you'll be humbled and all of those
[1:19:17] things will disappear
[1:19:18] but it may not be now but don't let that
[1:19:20] disable you
[1:19:22] don't let what you would class as great
[1:19:25] sin
[1:19:26] disable you just put it right with the
[1:19:28] lord
[1:19:29] you failed get back up come to church
[1:19:32] operate in your gift and your calling
[1:19:35] because god is not looking at your
[1:19:37] behavior now
[1:19:38] he wasn't looking at the woman at the
[1:19:39] wells prostitution and behaviors
[1:19:43] he knew he was going he felt a thin
[1:19:45] thread oh my
[1:19:47] there was a thread of desire over there
[1:19:50] at the well and he's
[1:19:51] and and and there was a vision in the
[1:19:53] open and said i gotta go
[1:19:54] to samaria i've gotta go
[1:19:58] there's someone there that desires me
[1:20:00] they're stuck in pornography they're
[1:20:02] stuck in sin they're stuck in some
[1:20:04] horrible multiple marriage situation and
[1:20:07] stuck somewhere and they can't get out
[1:20:10] but they want the messiah they're
[1:20:13] looking for me
[1:20:15] so he went there and he spoke to this
[1:20:19] woman
[1:20:20] he spoke to that little desire just
[1:20:23] started off
[1:20:23] talking about jacob's well and answering
[1:20:25] the questions and conversation
[1:20:27] got deeper and deeper and deeper until
[1:20:29] the word was discerning
[1:20:32] the hearts of the people the hearts of
[1:20:33] the heart of the woman
[1:20:35] and the word was going down into her
[1:20:37] heart until that desire was capitalized
[1:20:40] on
[1:20:40] until that desire became it just it just
[1:20:43] enlightened her
[1:20:45] because god can work with the thinnest
[1:20:46] thread god can work with that desire
[1:20:50] he looked beyond her faults he looked
[1:20:51] beyond the prostitution
[1:20:53] he looked beyond all the mistakes he
[1:20:55] looked beyond all the condemnation he
[1:20:57] says i
[1:20:57] am here to liberate you i am here
[1:21:00] to enable you so that you can function
[1:21:03] as a real redeemed son and daughter
[1:21:07] so that you can function woman at the
[1:21:09] well so that you can function so that
[1:21:11] you can go and
[1:21:12] share the gospel and cause revival
[1:21:16] so she she heard it
[1:21:19] brother branham says this she
[1:21:23] no one would endorse that what she was
[1:21:25] doing the laws of god condemn that
[1:21:28] she was morally wrong see
[1:21:31] god don't judge you upon what you are
[1:21:34] he judges not how big you are or how
[1:21:38] little you are
[1:21:39] he judges your heart what you want to be
[1:21:44] i've read this before but may it just
[1:21:47] sink down deeper
[1:21:48] today he judges your heart
[1:21:51] what you want to be
[1:21:54] i'm sure if i asked and sat down with
[1:21:56] each one of you and asked you what do
[1:21:58] you want to be
[1:21:59] you would say i want to be closer to god
[1:22:01] i want to i want to be happy
[1:22:03] i want to serve him i want i want to
[1:22:05] know my purpose
[1:22:06] i want to know why i'm here you know i
[1:22:09] want to meet him
[1:22:10] there would be not one sane person in
[1:22:12] this room that wouldn't want to meet the
[1:22:13] lord right
[1:22:15] really meet him and be in his presence
[1:22:16] you know we've read and
[1:22:18] listened to brother branham's testimony
[1:22:19] about beyond the curtain of time and how
[1:22:21] he couldn't even describe how wonderful
[1:22:23] it is there's not no one in here
[1:22:26] that wouldn't want to be there right
[1:22:29] children and all
[1:22:30] who wouldn't want to be there i mean i
[1:22:33] asked my children a lot
[1:22:35] you guys want to come to heaven right
[1:22:38] who doesn't i mean it's a simple
[1:22:40] question but
[1:22:41] you know who doesn't who doesn't want to
[1:22:44] meet him right
[1:22:45] that's a desire for god
[1:22:48] now there are insane people or that girl
[1:22:50] that criticized and ridiculed the
[1:22:52] prophet's ministry and
[1:22:54] then said her mother's soul could fry in
[1:22:56] hell and she wouldn't even should laugh
[1:22:57] right
[1:22:58] there's people you can cross that line
[1:23:01] so we won't lean too far
[1:23:02] on you know the other side you can cross
[1:23:05] the line but
[1:23:07] if there's a little desire just a small
[1:23:10] one
[1:23:12] because you might be clowning down with
[1:23:13] all of these failures and you think oh
[1:23:15] i'm just
[1:23:15] i'm just so worldly now i can't serve
[1:23:17] the lord anymore my mind is just filled
[1:23:19] with all that stuff
[1:23:20] just make it right with a simple prayer
[1:23:23] lord
[1:23:24] forgive me i've done all these things
[1:23:28] the moment you make it right there is
[1:23:31] nothing between you and your savior
[1:23:34] nothing
[1:23:38] all condemnations dealt with all bondage
[1:23:41] everything the prophet says see god
[1:23:45] don't judge oh he judges you what you
[1:23:47] want to be
[1:23:48] he didn't want she didn't want none of
[1:23:50] that stuff
[1:23:52] and deep down you know the things that
[1:23:55] we struggle with
[1:23:56] the things that we go through as a human
[1:23:57] being in the natural the things that
[1:23:59] bind us
[1:24:00] and bring us down we don't want that no
[1:24:03] one wants to be that way
[1:24:05] no one wants to have a struggle with for
[1:24:08] certain things
[1:24:09] no one wants to struggle with pride or
[1:24:11] struggle with lust or struggle with fear
[1:24:13] or struggle with lying
[1:24:14] no one wants to struggle with those
[1:24:16] things and you see we don't have to be
[1:24:18] condemned when we do
[1:24:21] there will come a conviction when you do
[1:24:23] it
[1:24:24] and you just make that right but don't
[1:24:27] let that disable you
[1:24:29] continue walking walk on god
[1:24:33] walk in the supernatural with him amen
[1:24:36] because you see
[1:24:37] he's got a plan
[1:24:45] the supernatural flow requires faith
[1:24:50] despite a person's overall performance
[1:24:53] it requires confidence towards god
[1:24:56] all fear and condemnation must be dealt
[1:24:58] with by grace
[1:24:59] and that's where graciousness comes in
[1:25:01] that's where the love when divine love
[1:25:04] is projected sovereign grace takes its
[1:25:06] place
[1:25:06] the grace of god the enabling power of
[1:25:09] god is
[1:25:09] able to operate it's able to
[1:25:12] supernaturally inspire it's able to
[1:25:16] birth people into the kingdom it's able
[1:25:18] to transform lives it's able
[1:25:21] because of love
[1:25:25] because there's love it's that
[1:25:26] atmosphere
[1:25:28] you want to be sticky right
[1:25:31] sticky with the love of god because you
[1:25:34] see the capstone's coming down
[1:25:36] the lord is descending upon his church
[1:25:39] divine love
[1:25:40] needs to amalgamate with divine love
[1:25:44] and the more divine love is in the
[1:25:47] church
[1:25:48] the more the capstone can really
[1:25:50] fellowship with us
[1:25:51] the more he can come down so please
[1:25:55] don't let condemnation rule you
[1:25:59] don't let condemnation disable you
[1:26:08] you know the devil's a bully the time
[1:26:12] has come to stand up to fear and
[1:26:13] condemnation
[1:26:16] when i lay down he says i fell asleep
[1:26:19] instantly and dreamed this dream i saw a
[1:26:22] man that i supposed was my father
[1:26:25] he was a great big burly man i also saw
[1:26:29] a woman
[1:26:29] who was supposed to be my mother but she
[1:26:32] didn't look like her
[1:26:34] even as the man did not look like my
[1:26:36] father
[1:26:39] the man was a very mean was very mean to
[1:26:41] his wife
[1:26:42] he had a large club with three corners
[1:26:44] on it
[1:26:45] you know when you take a log and set it
[1:26:48] up on end and hit it with an axe
[1:26:50] it makes a three cornered wedge
[1:26:53] wedge-like piece of wood
[1:26:54] firewood it was like that
[1:26:58] he would take this club and hit her with
[1:27:00] it
[1:27:01] and knock her down as she would lie
[1:27:05] there crying
[1:27:08] you know have you found yourself in that
[1:27:09] condition before where you're just
[1:27:11] beaten down
[1:27:12] by your thoughts you're beaten down by
[1:27:13] condemnation you're beaten down by
[1:27:15] your failures and you're just lying on
[1:27:17] their crime
[1:27:19] disabled unable feeling like you're just
[1:27:23] not worthy to serve the lord
[1:27:25] you see that's not our portion we don't
[1:27:27] have to remain in that condition
[1:27:31] says here he would walk around with his
[1:27:33] chest stuck out and his face was such
[1:27:35] a proud boastful look that he appeared
[1:27:37] to take great pride and satisfaction
[1:27:40] and beating up a poor little woman every
[1:27:43] time she tried to get up
[1:27:45] he would hit her i did not like what he
[1:27:48] was doing
[1:27:48] but as i considered stopping him i
[1:27:52] thought you see now this is the problem
[1:27:55] here
[1:27:55] sometimes we think but it's not what god
[1:27:58] thinks right
[1:27:59] so now here the prophet says i thought
[1:28:02] i can't tackle that man he's too big and
[1:28:05] sometimes you think your problems are
[1:28:06] too big and you're
[1:28:07] your failure is just this great thing
[1:28:09] against you right
[1:28:11] your humanity's too big god is greater
[1:28:14] than that
[1:28:15] greater is he who is in you than he who
[1:28:18] is in the world
[1:28:19] who's he that's in the world your old
[1:28:21] nature's in the world your old nature is
[1:28:23] a sinful nature
[1:28:25] but the god that's in you and the new
[1:28:27] life the new nature that's in you is
[1:28:29] greater than the nature that's behind
[1:28:31] you trying to drag you down
[1:28:33] all that condemnation all of that
[1:28:34] failure does not have to rule you
[1:28:37] i will not let condemnation disable me
[1:28:41] amen i want you to say that i will not
[1:28:44] let condemnation
[1:28:45] disable me amen there is blood
[1:28:49] there is provision for us to walk free
[1:28:52] to stay free
[1:28:53] and to live free and to set others free
[1:28:56] because when you are free
[1:28:58] you have the ability by supernatural
[1:29:00] inspiration to set
[1:29:01] others free amen is there anyone in here
[1:29:05] that doesn't want
[1:29:07] the supernatural in their life any hands
[1:29:10] anyone doesn't want the supernatural of
[1:29:12] god oh good
[1:29:13] so everybody wants the supernatural of
[1:29:15] god amen well i encourage you now
[1:29:18] from this time deal with condemnation
[1:29:21] wisely
[1:29:22] deal with guilt wisely you're not guilty
[1:29:26] you are free you are justified
[1:29:29] as if you never sinned amen there is a
[1:29:32] bleach for you
[1:29:33] that bleaches out all amen
[1:29:36] when the book came open hallelujah it
[1:29:39] was revealed
[1:29:41] who caused it all who caused it
[1:29:45] who caused it satan
[1:29:49] he's the cause he's the first cause of
[1:29:52] all of these world events that are
[1:29:53] problematic and antichrist
[1:29:56] he is the cause when this came open
[1:29:59] it revealed that you never did it in the
[1:30:02] first place
[1:30:04] it revealed the power of the blood
[1:30:09] did you notice when the seven seals were
[1:30:11] preached and seal number one was
[1:30:12] preached
[1:30:13] and this was the book coming open and
[1:30:16] you know what he preached
[1:30:17] about bleach he preached that the blood
[1:30:20] is like bleach
[1:30:21] and when your sin goes into the blood
[1:30:24] it's like it goes back
[1:30:25] to gases and cosmic light it goes back
[1:30:28] to where it came from
[1:30:31] the devil and he
[1:30:34] will take all the sins of the redeemed
[1:30:37] and all the things that they ever did
[1:30:39] and will do
[1:30:41] they're all allotted to lucifer and he's
[1:30:43] going to take them to the lake of fire
[1:30:46] so just think about that next time you
[1:30:48] make a mistake
[1:30:49] boo devil boo devil amen
[1:30:53] my sin those things that my mistakes
[1:30:56] they're on your head satan you caused
[1:30:58] that you're the one that
[1:31:00] infested the human race with all these
[1:31:02] sinful things you're the one that
[1:31:04] tempted
[1:31:04] you're the one that's in my own nature
[1:31:07] but i'm not that anymore
[1:31:08] because i was born again hallelujah
[1:31:12] if there's someone in here that needs to
[1:31:14] be born again the altar is open
[1:31:17] the altar is open if anybody i'm not
[1:31:18] looking at anybody that isn't i'm just
[1:31:20] looking at people because i like looking
[1:31:21] at people
[1:31:22] so don't think i'm looking at you for
[1:31:24] any reason
[1:31:27] you got to be careful you know people
[1:31:29] think oh no he's looking at me
[1:31:31] ben looks at me you know and i'm like
[1:31:33] what are you looking at
[1:31:35] what did i do ben gets a trajectory you
[1:31:40] know and he's like going from here to
[1:31:41] here and i'm like
[1:31:42] i'm right in his line of sight i'm like
[1:31:44] try and move over now
[1:31:46] oh mate yet but you see
[1:31:51] god has made provision for us
[1:31:55] more than enough his blood is so
[1:31:57] powerful
[1:31:58] it's so bleaching you don't have to be
[1:32:01] condemned
[1:32:02] you can operate in your ministry you can
[1:32:05] operate in your calling
[1:32:07] you can operate in supernatural there's
[1:32:09] nothing between you and your savior
[1:32:12] because of the blood because of calvary
[1:32:16] and because it's been magnified
[1:32:19] by an open book because it's all come
[1:32:22] open
[1:32:23] it's like oh god says you know right the
[1:32:25] devil's come out on the earth
[1:32:27] through television and radio and all the
[1:32:29] ether waves and the internet and all the
[1:32:31] youtube and all the sin
[1:32:33] and all the super sports stars and all
[1:32:35] of that to
[1:32:36] idolize and steal the minds of boys and
[1:32:39] girls
[1:32:40] steal their minds steal their heart from
[1:32:43] the true hero
[1:32:45] of every boy and girl which is jesus
[1:32:47] christ
[1:32:50] the lord needed something better
[1:32:53] it was no longer just suffice to have
[1:32:58] denomination it was no longer sufficient
[1:33:02] for churchianity and religion it was no
[1:33:05] longer sufficient just
[1:33:07] to believe on the cross that your sins
[1:33:10] are saved and live
[1:33:11] still live a sinful life it was no
[1:33:13] longer sufficient
[1:33:14] just to have a holy life and it's no
[1:33:17] longer sufficient just to have a
[1:33:19] supernatural life
[1:33:20] but it's only sufficient to receive the
[1:33:24] bleach
[1:33:25] to receive the fullness of the word
[1:33:28] to receive the opening of the word
[1:33:31] because you're believing on the name
[1:33:35] of the son of god you're believing on
[1:33:38] the name

[1:34:24] because he's here in the fullness of his
[1:34:25] presence
[1:34:27] we may not feel any different the more
[1:34:29] we get closer to him
[1:34:31] he will allow us to see things if we
[1:34:33] remain in condemnation
[1:34:35] you're not going to feel nothing right
[1:34:37] unless the sovereign grace overlooks
[1:34:39] that to get you out of it
[1:34:41] but he's here today to tell you you
[1:34:42] don't have to remain in it
[1:34:44] you don't have to be condemned you don't
[1:34:46] have to be guilty of nothing

[1:34:52] you don't have to have depression don't
[1:34:54] have to have anything
[1:34:55] nothing can all be dealt with but as he
[1:34:59] reads the open book to you
[1:35:01] it starts to expose things in your life
[1:35:03] that need to be dealt with right
[1:35:06] not to condemn you to clean you
[1:35:09] to change you to show you actually yeah

[1:35:25] wherever you're at
[1:35:27] he's looking at your heart he's looking
[1:35:28] at the desire of your heart and you're
[1:35:30] like lord
[1:35:31] i heard something today that has it it's
[1:35:33] convicted me
[1:35:35] lord i just i'm sorry for that and lord
[1:35:38] i i believe lord this is my time
[1:35:40] for this to be dealt with in my life
[1:35:42] because you see puts it on your heart
[1:35:44] and you might have in your memory and
[1:35:46] our memory can be a big problem for us
[1:35:48] because we remember all of our problems
[1:35:49] right
[1:35:50] we remember all the things we do and
[1:35:52] then you think oh my i've got to deal
[1:35:53] with all of it
[1:35:54] and then you know you you have this
[1:35:56] whole lineup of stuff that's got to be
[1:35:58] dealt with
[1:35:59] and in your mind and the way you think
[1:36:01] is like okay
[1:36:02] i'm condemned because i can't i'm it's
[1:36:05] just weighing me down
[1:36:07] don't let it weigh you down god's
[1:36:08] dealing with those things
[1:36:10] he's got his finger of judgment on every
[1:36:13] sinful attribute in your life
[1:36:15] he's got his finger of judgment on every
[1:36:17] trait of your family that is not of god
[1:36:20] he's got his finger of judgment on every
[1:36:22] cultural misfit
[1:36:24] you know when i say a cultural misfit
[1:36:26] there there's things that we bring from
[1:36:28] every culture
[1:36:29] that's not fitting to the spirit of god
[1:36:32] it's not
[1:36:32] message it's not openly it's not
[1:36:34] heavenly it's earthly it's stuff that's
[1:36:37] been contracted
[1:36:38] by the fallen world it's misfitting
[1:36:41] he's got his finger of judgment on every
[1:36:43] single one right
[1:36:44] he's got a season when it will be dealt
[1:36:46] with
[1:36:48] so he says here every time
[1:36:52] she tried to get up
[1:36:57] he would hit her i did not like what he
[1:36:59] was doing but i considered stopping him
[1:37:01] i thought i can't tackle that man he's
[1:37:06] too big
[1:37:07] then he's supposed to be my father but
[1:37:09] down inside i knew he wasn't my father
[1:37:12] and i knew that no man had the right to
[1:37:14] treat a woman like that
[1:37:15] i went over and grabbed him by the
[1:37:18] collar and turned him around and said
[1:37:20] you have no right to strike her
[1:37:24] and when i said i love that
[1:37:27] his blood has brought us back on
[1:37:28] speaking terms
[1:37:30] remember that speaking terms that means
[1:37:34] you can speak to god
[1:37:35] and god can speak through you and you
[1:37:37] can speak
[1:37:39] under his inspiration for him
[1:37:43] and so your words become omnipotent
[1:37:46] under his inspiration
[1:37:48] when i said that my muscles grew and i
[1:37:51] looked like a giant
[1:37:53] that man saw them and he was scared of
[1:37:56] me
[1:37:57] you know you're a devil chaser you're a
[1:37:59] devil chaser
[1:38:01] he's scared of you if you just lie on
[1:38:04] the ground crying
[1:38:06] he's bigger and bigger and bigger but
[1:38:09] the moment you take a stand
[1:38:11] and you say my god is greater than this
[1:38:13] failure my god is greater than my heart
[1:38:16] he's greater than this deception he's
[1:38:18] greater than all these things that i see
[1:38:21] all the failures that have pinned me
[1:38:22] down and disabled me
[1:38:24] i'm unable today i'm gonna stand and i'm
[1:38:27] gonna say devil
[1:38:29] no longer are you going to keep me down
[1:38:33] no longer am i going to hold back no
[1:38:36] longer am i going to stay home condemned
[1:38:39] no longer am i going to
[1:38:42] down on the ground and i say
[1:38:45] satan we're through
[1:38:52] condemnation not today
[1:38:55] guilt not today fear not today
[1:38:59] you stand for it stand up against it
[1:39:02] stand up against it
[1:39:04] that's a bluff he's a bluffing bully he
[1:39:08] don't ever meet a bluffing bully
[1:39:10] they're more scared but they they
[1:39:13] cover over their fear by being a bully
[1:39:17] that's the devil he's scared the moment
[1:39:20] you stand you're bigger
[1:39:22] but if you don't he's bigger
[1:39:26] remember that so address your enemy
[1:39:30] you know we find ourselves beaten down
[1:39:32] by our own failures and rendered useless
[1:39:34] in our own
[1:39:36] self-image as a result
[1:39:40] we are often bound by a condemnation and
[1:39:43] fear
[1:39:44] which is not designed for believers to
[1:39:46] remain under
[1:39:48] we shouldn't remain under fear or remain
[1:39:50] under condemnation or remain under guilt
[1:39:53] yes they are real emotions yes they
[1:39:55] serve their purpose
[1:39:57] but not to remain under now we have to
[1:40:01] realize now
[1:40:02] the power of the blood the
[1:40:05] power of restoration
[1:40:09] the power of the blood to restore our
[1:40:12] relationship
[1:40:13] with god so that we can live in an
[1:40:15] atmosphere
[1:40:17] of faith so that now when we're in that
[1:40:20] atmosphere of faith and his love comes
[1:40:22] and we say lord
[1:40:24] you know when you're praying and his
[1:40:26] presence comes down
[1:40:28] it's building that love if you don't
[1:40:31] have that
[1:40:32] you struggle to love and you feel like
[1:40:35] you're just snowballing under all of the
[1:40:37] weight of the world and the weight of
[1:40:38] the troubles and the problems
[1:40:40] god is greater than those problems god
[1:40:42] is greater than your heart
[1:40:44] he sees the bigger picture he sees a
[1:40:46] perfect person
[1:40:48] he's not he's not gonna be you see that
[1:40:50] wasn't god with the three-sided club
[1:40:52] that was not god doing this sometimes we
[1:40:55] think god's like this you know
[1:40:57] the angry father and the loving son
[1:41:00] he's the same person he's a loving god
[1:41:04] he's a gracious god and his grace
[1:41:07] is there to equip us to keep us
[1:41:11] in fellowship we are to remain
[1:41:14] in fellowship lord forgive me
[1:41:18] i'm not gonna be subject to condemnation
[1:41:20] no more
[1:41:21] i ain't gonna let no proud boastful
[1:41:23] devil club me down
[1:41:25] and i'm sure as the heavens not gonna
[1:41:28] let
[1:41:29] him hammer down my friends and family
[1:41:31] our fellowship
[1:41:33] amen so we stand for ourselves
[1:41:36] and we stand for our families and we
[1:41:37] stand for each other
[1:41:39] amen hallelujah and you see now because
[1:41:42] of condemnation it gets dealt with
[1:41:44] because fear gets dealt with
[1:41:46] because guilt gets dealt with and all of
[1:41:48] these things get
[1:41:49] dealt with in your experience now
[1:41:52] your heart condemns you not right you
[1:41:55] don't feel condemned in your heart
[1:41:56] anymore you have confidence towards god
[1:42:00] now you can talk to him now you can't
[1:42:02] expect
[1:42:03] a visitation and i am going to encourage
[1:42:06] you today
[1:42:08] as a new year this year 2021
[1:42:12] class of sunday 27th of december
[1:42:18] this is your homework when you pray
[1:42:21] tonight
[1:42:23] expect a visitation if there's
[1:42:26] condemnation and you've done something
[1:42:28] make it right and expect a visitation
[1:42:32] i'm preaching to myself man it's hard to
[1:42:35] pray sometimes
[1:42:37] there's a wall of devils making you need
[1:42:40] to get up you got to go do this
[1:42:42] gotta go do that not just honestly
[1:42:45] just want to sit there and go his
[1:42:48] presence is just so good
[1:42:50] that's what's going to build your
[1:42:51] relationship it's what will build your
[1:42:54] love
[1:42:55] is quality time with god you watch
[1:42:59] and then when the things go on that love
[1:43:02] will be like a buffer
[1:43:04] to buff out all the sins that you commit
[1:43:07] and the sins that each other's failures
[1:43:09] and whatever they do
[1:43:11] i mean we're not i don't see all that
[1:43:12] but you know it happens
[1:43:15] but you see what does that do
[1:43:18] that's the divine love projected over
[1:43:20] the church
[1:43:22] so that sovereign grace who loves
[1:43:24] sovereign grace
[1:43:26] sovereign grace is our friend sovereign
[1:43:29] grace is what will change lives
[1:43:31] sovereign grace is an enabling power
[1:43:34] and we need to be enabled today because
[1:43:37] condemnation
[1:43:38] fear guilt doubts all of that stuff will
[1:43:41] disable us
[1:43:43] and when we're disabled we're not lost
[1:43:45] but we're useless
[1:43:47] and i don't want to be a useless pew
[1:43:48] sitter sorry about the language but
[1:43:51] and i'm not meaning it in a very
[1:43:52] derogatory way i just mean we don't want
[1:43:54] to be useless in his body right
[1:43:56] we want to be useful it may not be a
[1:43:59] public thing
[1:44:00] but it's useful because there's
[1:44:02] something going on in my prayer time
[1:44:04] there's something going on when i'm
[1:44:05] playing that thing and when uh
[1:44:08] deborah you know there's an anointing
[1:44:12] there's an anointing because there's
[1:44:13] faith right you believe
[1:44:16] we're not up there just you know
[1:44:19] doubting we're up there believing and
[1:44:21] when we play this
[1:44:22] the more these you know you play the
[1:44:25] bass you play this drums and the
[1:44:27] piano and whatever singing preaching
[1:44:30] down the back there is an atmosphere
[1:44:35] there's a supernatural component when
[1:44:37] we're sitting there and the preacher's
[1:44:38] preaching
[1:44:40] we're not sitting there just saying i
[1:44:41] wonder he's going to say next you know
[1:44:42] like we're actually going oh lord
[1:44:44] i'm pulling on that thing i'm touching
[1:44:47] the hem of christ's garment through that
[1:44:49] gift
[1:44:50] you know there's an active if you've got
[1:44:52] a need right now paul
[1:44:54] lord meet my need right now i need speak
[1:44:56] to me about this confirm this
[1:44:58] lord i need direction you watch what
[1:45:00] will happen
[1:45:01] the minister will be pulled to that and
[1:45:04] and
[1:45:05] you just if you got you know and you'd
[1:45:06] be alert
[1:45:10] man i i get inspired you know and then i
[1:45:12] forget that i'm
[1:45:13] thinking about you know i have a
[1:45:15] question and
[1:45:16] maybe you know we go through the service
[1:45:18] and i've just had a glorious time
[1:45:20] and then bronwyn will say afterwards did
[1:45:22] you hear that did you hear that
[1:45:23] did you hear that i'm like oh no i
[1:45:26] didn't
[1:45:27] but now i get it because i've just had a
[1:45:30] good time but sometimes we've got to
[1:45:31] really focus and think okay
[1:45:33] you know you you you're listening for
[1:45:35] something
[1:45:36] and maybe you're listening for something
[1:45:38] today you know the i think brother
[1:45:40] albert preached here
[1:45:41] a while ago he says incline your ear to
[1:45:42] the lord we need to incline our air
[1:45:46] you know he wants to say something
[1:45:49] and you know that's that pull so you're
[1:45:52] not
[1:45:52] just a passive part of the service
[1:45:56] sitting down there you're actually fully
[1:45:58] engaged and active
[1:46:00] young children you can say lord speak to
[1:46:02] me
[1:46:04] speak to me i'm not too young samuel was
[1:46:07] what seven eight and the word came to
[1:46:10] him
[1:46:10] yes he was a prophet but you're in a
[1:46:12] greater age you're in the age of prophet
[1:46:15] prophetic age and eagle age
[1:46:19] he was all the way down there way way
[1:46:22] way way back
[1:46:23] and now we're here at the culmination
[1:46:26] the consummation of everything
[1:46:29] hallelujah
[1:46:33] where we are to be enabled today
[1:46:38] be enabled don't let the devil beat you
[1:46:42] down
[1:46:43] you know god's blood voids the need for
[1:46:46] condemnation
[1:46:48] now when i say that i mean prolonged
[1:46:50] condemnation
[1:46:52] because there is a god can strongly
[1:46:54] disapprove of things that we do
[1:46:56] right strongly disapprove of it
[1:47:00] but that doesn't mean that we have to
[1:47:02] stay guilty
[1:47:04] we don't have to stay in a condition of
[1:47:06] guilt or fear or worry or uncertainty
[1:47:08] does god really want to use me yes he
[1:47:10] does he'll use anybody
[1:47:13] whose heart doesn't condemn them i
[1:47:15] pondered this because i go
[1:47:17] when i first became a christian you know
[1:47:19] i was i knew the message was true
[1:47:22] but i was going into pentecostal
[1:47:23] churches and going into these
[1:47:25] denominations and looking
[1:47:26] meeting people and whatever you know and
[1:47:28] making bible studies and
[1:47:30] i and i'd see these people and they're
[1:47:32] living lives that i would
[1:47:34] consider very sinful right doing
[1:47:37] drinking and whatever
[1:47:38] but the spirit of god is using them
[1:47:41] huh and you think wow and it made me
[1:47:44] think
[1:47:45] and i thought well okay so how but do
[1:47:48] you know what it was
[1:47:49] wasn't their behavior it wasn't the fact
[1:47:52] that they know all the doctrines of the
[1:47:53] bible
[1:47:54] it was the fact that their heart was not
[1:47:56] condemning them
[1:47:57] and they had faith and they believed
[1:48:00] that god would use them and he did
[1:48:02] so how much more you think your things
[1:48:05] are wrong and oh i've slipped up today
[1:48:07] oh i just keep thinking that thing
[1:48:09] oh these memories i just try and pray
[1:48:11] and and all these filthy
[1:48:12] images come into my mind or all of these
[1:48:15] memories just
[1:48:16] press me down oh and you think oh god
[1:48:19] won't use me
[1:48:21] god will use you he wants to use you
[1:48:24] he doesn't want those things to render
[1:48:26] you useless
[1:48:28] he has provided blood
[1:48:32] for all past present and future sins
[1:48:35] in revelation 1 5 remember we read
[1:48:39] this needs a clip on today i'm going to
[1:48:41] tuck this under my collar
[1:48:53] all sins all our sins are dealt with
[1:48:58] so all of those things that you think is
[1:49:00] rendering you to a
[1:49:01] natural prayer life i'm sorry lord all
[1:49:03] the time
[1:49:05] it's not like that god is your father
[1:49:08] he's your
[1:49:09] bridegroom he loves you with
[1:49:11] unconditional love
[1:49:13] it's like you know he just wants to
[1:49:15] really operate in your life
[1:49:18] he wants to utilize the resource that
[1:49:21] he's placed within you
[1:49:24] powerful treasures are inside each one
[1:49:26] powerful treasures
[1:49:28] abraham powerful and you
[1:49:31] mate you just see you know we
[1:49:35] we know you know we see children and we
[1:49:36] think my good boys
[1:49:39] you know and they just want to play and
[1:49:41] all that stuff but you know there's
[1:49:42] treasures inside there
[1:49:44] ready to be just to come forth
[1:49:47] and we we we can't judge a book by its
[1:49:49] current stage or
[1:49:51] anything we just have to sow the seed
[1:49:54] and you sow and you sow and you sow
[1:49:57] and then the quickening power comes amen
[1:50:00] the quickening power comes to quicken
[1:50:02] what's inside to bring it out
[1:50:04] and that's the same as us but we cannot
[1:50:07] let
[1:50:08] the devil beat us down we cannot let the
[1:50:11] devil team up with that old nature
[1:50:12] that's
[1:50:13] down behind us that's always wanting to
[1:50:16] rule
[1:50:17] always wanting to come back always you
[1:50:19] know forming alliances
[1:50:20] with all sorts of demons and devils
[1:50:24] to try and win you back over to try and
[1:50:26] bring you down
[1:50:28] because you see when you are useful in
[1:50:29] the hands of god when god gets a hold of
[1:50:32] you and your channels are open
[1:50:35] he's very scared you are a real threat
[1:50:37] but you're also a real blessing
[1:50:39] to the kingdom of god and it goes beyond
[1:50:42] natural blessing it's
[1:50:43] it becomes a spiritual blessing it
[1:50:46] becomes a supernatural
[1:50:47] part of the body you are supernatural
[1:50:53] addition to the house of god
[1:50:56] just in the simplicity of all of this
[1:50:59] and i maybe this may be super elementary
[1:51:02] but i believe
[1:51:03] that we need this we need to hear i
[1:51:05] don't have to be condemned
[1:51:07] i don't have to be guilty amen
[1:51:10] you know you because if you do if you
[1:51:12] feel that way
[1:51:13] because sometimes we're living in sin or
[1:51:16] living in us
[1:51:17] we've got we're not living in it but
[1:51:19] it's just
[1:51:20] crippling us down and it's you can't
[1:51:23] find a way out
[1:51:25] you see god can look beyond that and he
[1:51:28] wants to get you back into service
[1:51:30] he wants to use you he wants you to
[1:51:32] function again
[1:51:34] and all you need to do is say lord i'm
[1:51:36] sorry forgive me
[1:51:38] now try me i just want to get into
[1:51:39] action you may find
[1:51:42] that that's the very thing that will
[1:51:44] bring your deliverance
[1:51:46] not sitting back not withdrawing not
[1:51:48] saying i'll deal with this later
[1:51:50] you'll go further back you you pull back
[1:51:53] you know the ember you take the ember
[1:51:55] out of the fire it gets cold
[1:51:58] if you take the ember out of the fire it
[1:52:00] gets cold
[1:52:01] you know and that ember just gets colder
[1:52:03] and colder and the devil gets bigger and
[1:52:05] bigger
[1:52:06] but the moment you say here's the line
[1:52:10] devil
[1:52:11] that's it and you stand and you say just
[1:52:14] like the prophet says i said
[1:52:16] he saw the devil was real big right then
[1:52:18] but something rose up
[1:52:19] and i pray that something would rise up
[1:52:22] in you
[1:52:23] whoever's struggling with these things
[1:52:25] and you say no to my mo
[1:52:28] you have no right to hit me down anymore
[1:52:30] you've got no right to have my brethren
[1:52:32] down
[1:52:33] she's not made to cry on the floor
[1:52:36] her position is the scepter's extended
[1:52:39] and
[1:52:39] she has coheir with the king hallelujah
[1:52:43] she's got the king signet
[1:52:46] amen amen full authority and power
[1:52:50] unto half the kingdom amen that's what
[1:52:52] you've got
[1:52:56] win
[1:52:59] when you're in an atmosphere
[1:53:03] it's all about an atmosphere it's all
[1:53:05] about your knowing your position

[1:53:28] theophany in eternity

[1:58:09] to have fellowship with these people on
[1:58:13] a good note to liberate people

[1:59:11] so that you can operate and you can pray
[1:59:13] and god can listen and hear and
[1:59:15] it's just about fellowship where you get
[1:59:18] down in your bed
[1:59:19] and you get down in your closet down in
[1:59:21] your dining table
[1:59:23] sit down in the pew and his presence
[1:59:25] just comes down
[1:59:27] it's real simple real simple
[1:59:31] but it's very essential it's the utmost
[1:59:34] essential thing
[1:59:35] of our experience despite not despite
[1:59:39] you know on accumulatory to our
[1:59:42] salvation is fellowship with god
[1:59:47] fellowship with him where we're at he's
[1:59:50] ever present
[1:59:51] wherever you go even when you're down in
[1:59:53] a condition that you would class as hell
[1:59:55] oh my he's there psalm 139 says if i
[2:00:00] make my bed and he'll behold thou
[2:00:01] out there they'll know us my goings my
[2:00:04] thoughts everything
[2:00:06] he knows everything he it even says in
[2:00:08] that psalm he knows
[2:00:10] that when he was forming the earth this
[2:00:13] is how much god knows
[2:00:15] he says he knows all things right
[2:00:17] straight after we talk about
[2:00:18] condemnation in the scripture he says
[2:00:20] i he knows the earth the clay
[2:00:23] that your body would be made out of he
[2:00:26] knows that
[2:00:27] and when he was forming that his mind
[2:00:29] knew that that bit of clay molten rock
[2:00:31] or whatever was going to be the clay
[2:00:32] that you would be made of
[2:00:34] and he knew when your body would consume
[2:00:36] that clay out of dust
[2:00:37] out of fruits and vegetables and meat he
[2:00:40] knew that
[2:00:42] he knew what scotch fillet it was that
[2:00:48] am i doing something naughty
[2:00:58] he knew he's got it really covered
[2:01:03] he's got this whole plan covered he's
[2:01:06] got his redemption covered
[2:01:07] he's got your life covered he's made
[2:01:09] provisions so that you
[2:01:11] despite your humanity can stay in
[2:01:13] fellowship with him
[2:01:15] you can stay uncondemned you can stay
[2:01:18] guiltless who likes the idea
[2:01:22] of remaining guiltless who likes the
[2:01:24] idea of remaining fearless
[2:01:27] see when god comes to you and i was
[2:01:30] watching this cartoon last night and i
[2:01:31] was getting frustrated at the character
[2:01:33] and there because she was just
[2:01:34] doubting everything and i thought my she
[2:01:36] just needs to
[2:01:37] have an experience with god and then
[2:01:39] that moment she got an experience with
[2:01:41] god and then everything was faith again
[2:01:42] she was now
[2:01:43] talking about how good he is no matter
[2:01:45] what the circumstances you know
[2:01:47] i thought man we need that
[2:01:51] and it's that transaction that
[2:01:54] transaction that can take place in our
[2:01:55] life where we go
[2:01:57] you know because you can read your
[2:01:58] atmosphere and be a thermometer
[2:02:01] you can read your condition and you can
[2:02:04] take on that temperature
[2:02:06] but i don't believe that's our portion
[2:02:09] we've been given faith
[2:02:10] to overcome this world faith is the
[2:02:13] victory that overcomes the world
[2:02:15] right but you can't have faith if your
[2:02:17] heart's condemning you
[2:02:19] so therefore you need to believe that
[2:02:21] his blood is sufficient for my sins
[2:02:24] that what was spoken of was to enable me
[2:02:27] freedom from that so that i can have
[2:02:30] faith
[2:02:32] to overcome this world because otherwise
[2:02:35] i'll be a thermometer
[2:02:37] and i will take on the temperature
[2:02:39] faithfully
[2:02:40] faithfully read the atmosphere of greed
[2:02:44] fear lust whatever it may be
[2:02:48] read the atmosphere of hatred malice
[2:02:51] envy bitterness what's that word
[2:02:53] resentment oh my
[2:02:55] you know when i hear that word
[2:02:56] resentment i think oh
[2:02:58] that's like as that's as bad as it gets
[2:03:00] when it comes to
[2:03:02] just a resentment you know how much that
[2:03:05] cripples the atmosphere when you resent
[2:03:09] oh man if that could get any worse
[2:03:13] resentment and hatred
[2:03:16] god is greater than that you know we get
[2:03:19] ourselves
[2:03:19] in a thermometer if you're a thermometer
[2:03:22] and i believe i'm looking at
[2:03:23] thermometers
[2:03:24] but if we if we end up in a condition
[2:03:26] where we're reading the atmosphere
[2:03:28] we get guilty because of all the
[2:03:30] circumstances you're looking at it
[2:03:32] and yes it's there but they
[2:03:36] that observe lying manatees
[2:03:39] all lying vanities forsake their own
[2:03:41] mercy
[2:03:43] do you understand jonah said that
[2:03:47] now if anyone had symptoms it was jonah
[2:03:51] jonah was in the bottom of the sea in a
[2:03:55] belly of a big fish and it was probably
[2:03:57] not very didn't smell very good down
[2:03:58] there
[2:03:59] and it was probably not very nice but he
[2:04:01] was there
[2:04:03] there's not many ways there's no way out
[2:04:05] and he decided i'm gonna refuse this
[2:04:08] he if he was a thermometer he would have
[2:04:10] just laid down
[2:04:12] and became lunch because he was already
[2:04:14] lunch
[2:04:15] but faye said i'm not lunch and you
[2:04:18] don't want to be the devil's lunch
[2:04:20] we don't want to be the devil's lunch
[2:04:23] and no matter you might be getting eaten
[2:04:25] alive by the mosquitoes
[2:04:27] and plagues of this earth and all of the
[2:04:29] sinful
[2:04:30] attributes just coming at you condemning
[2:04:33] you guiltifying you and bringing you
[2:04:35] down and pressing you to the ground
[2:04:37] crying on the floor like the woman at
[2:04:40] the well
[2:04:41] probably cried every day longing for
[2:04:44] something real
[2:04:45] and then one day you know but something
[2:04:48] had to happen and jonas stood up and
[2:04:50] said
[2:04:50] no i'm not going to read this atmosphere
[2:04:53] i'm not going to read this condemnation
[2:04:55] i'm not going to read this guilt i'm not
[2:04:58] going to read my failures
[2:05:00] i'm not going to read my shortcomings
[2:05:02] i'm not going to read my family
[2:05:04] traits that are bringing me down i'm not
[2:05:06] going to read
[2:05:07] the disgusting things that are going on
[2:05:09] out there i'm not going to read all this
[2:05:11] stuff that's condemning me down
[2:05:14] i'm not going to be a thermometer
[2:05:16] faithful to my atmosphere
[2:05:18] the atmosphere can be negative and dark
[2:05:20] and black
[2:05:21] all around you
[2:05:25] i'm not going to read that anymore make
[2:05:27] that resolve in your heart
[2:05:29] resolution i'm not reading the
[2:05:31] atmosphere anymore
[2:05:33] i'm going to hope against hope i'm going
[2:05:36] to call the things that is ours so they
[2:05:38] won't
[2:05:40] and i i'm going to look silly and i'm
[2:05:42] going to testify
[2:05:44] and i'm going to sound real dumb to a
[2:05:46] natural-minded person
[2:05:48] but to a spiritual person that i'm going
[2:05:50] to be cheered on
[2:05:51] by the great cloud of witnesses come on
[2:05:53] we can see you the race is almost over
[2:05:56] we're about to go and they're all
[2:05:58] carrying around the banisters of heaven
[2:06:00] come on come on stop reading the
[2:06:02] atmosphere around you
[2:06:04] stop being thermometers now it's now
[2:06:07] time
[2:06:08] to be a thermostat it's now time to set
[2:06:10] the temperature
[2:06:11] it's now time by faith when it's 17
[2:06:14] degrees
[2:06:15] and too cold i'm going to say no it's
[2:06:17] dirty
[2:06:19] amen and when it's 100 humidity and i
[2:06:22] can't sleep it's all sweaty and yuck
[2:06:24] it's perfect it's going to be perfect
[2:06:27] and i'm going to change that who
[2:06:29] believes they can change that
[2:06:31] who believes they can change that how
[2:06:35] when your heart condemns you not so if
[2:06:38] anyone
[2:06:38] suffered from condemnation in their
[2:06:41] hearts
[2:06:43] now i can we can all just put our hand
[2:06:45] up right now
[2:06:47] today i just want to encourage you
[2:06:52] don't stay in that condition don't stay
[2:06:55] there
[2:06:56] it was a greater thing for you you know
[2:07:00] god used rahab god used
[2:07:03] tamar samson gideon
[2:07:08] jl who knows who jl is
[2:07:14] statement her husband made a covenant
[2:07:15] with with the enemy
[2:07:18] but god used her to put a nail in the
[2:07:21] captain of the enemy's host head
[2:07:23] hallelujah god used her
[2:07:28] she was in a very bad condition was god
[2:07:32] too proud to use her no our god is
[2:07:35] willing to stoop
[2:07:36] to the lowest place and look up to the
[2:07:39] shortest
[2:07:40] man amen has
[2:07:43] has his love is boundless
[2:07:47] god can do whatever he wants and he
[2:07:50] wants to use you
[2:07:52] he wants you to operate in his kingdom
[2:07:55] despite yourself
[2:07:56] despite your failures despite all your
[2:07:58] humanity
[2:08:00] rest assured this shall be dealt with
[2:08:03] brother branham says this you know and i
[2:08:05] just wanted even this last
[2:08:07] group of people that he used the wise
[2:08:09] men you know we're just so used to that
[2:08:11] story but you realize that these men
[2:08:13] were astrologers they read the stars and
[2:08:16] they
[2:08:17] and they were magiz but
[2:08:21] they actually really wanted to meet the
[2:08:22] messiah there was a seed sown maybe
[2:08:25] through generations
[2:08:27] now this is why i'm the reason i'm
[2:08:29] saying this is
[2:08:30] that desire is a very important thing
[2:08:32] that you've got in your heart
[2:08:34] if you just just have a little desire
[2:08:36] for god
[2:08:37] that can bring an omnipotent experience
[2:08:39] in your life
[2:08:41] just a little desire that god can
[2:08:44] capitalize on that so if you find
[2:08:46] that you've got that i would be getting
[2:08:49] on my knees and crying out things
[2:08:51] thank you jesus oh thank you lord
[2:08:54] because you see many people don't have
[2:08:56] that
[2:08:57] but if you've got that today a little
[2:09:00] desire is what the magi's had
[2:09:02] the astrologers the wise men
[2:09:06] and god saw that and he granted their
[2:09:09] desire
[2:09:10] it says here you say here then brother
[2:09:12] branham do you think that god would deal
[2:09:14] with those magis
[2:09:16] the bible said in hebrews the first
[2:09:18] chapter and the first verse
[2:09:20] that god in sundry times and in diverse
[2:09:22] manners all kinds of manners
[2:09:24] he spoke unto the fathers
[2:09:27] it's also written in acts 10 35 that god
[2:09:29] is no respecter of person
[2:09:31] but he honoreth those in every nation
[2:09:33] who desire
[2:09:36] to serve him in righteousness though you
[2:09:39] be an error
[2:09:41] yet in the righteousness
[2:09:44] of the projective of your heart that you
[2:09:47] desire
[2:09:48] to serve god god will honor that
[2:09:53] amen so therefore denominations
[2:09:56] has no lines that they can sit that will
[2:09:59] stop god
[2:10:00] to any certain creed because god will
[2:10:03] look upon the motives of the human heart
[2:10:05] and there he will work from that
[2:10:08] spot isn't that powerful
[2:10:13] right and i believe god's got many
[2:10:14] categories and i believe that god will
[2:10:16] call people to their category
[2:10:18] god will call people to their calling
[2:10:20] god will call people to a tribulation
[2:10:22] god will call a bride out of it before
[2:10:24] it happens
[2:10:25] right and if you're being called to that
[2:10:27] just surrender
[2:10:28] just submit to that calling and let god
[2:10:31] call you
[2:10:32] and just oh lord let me be a magnet
[2:10:36] i just want to be magnetized to that
[2:10:38] purpose
[2:10:40] amen we don't want to put down those
[2:10:42] that are believing for a tribulation
[2:10:45] and and they have prophecies and all
[2:10:48] sorts prepare
[2:10:51] hey i'm not going to say that isn't the
[2:10:52] lord because god has
[2:10:54] people going through a tribulation a
[2:10:55] foolish virgin right
[2:10:57] he's got a he's got those people and
[2:10:59] they're preparing and they believe and
[2:11:00] their faith
[2:11:01] is to prepare so he's calling them to
[2:11:04] that
[2:11:05] and he's got people out in the world
[2:11:07] that he's using
[2:11:08] in some way shape or form calling them
[2:11:10] to a purpose
[2:11:13] but what is your purpose now if god can
[2:11:16] use those people
[2:11:17] and we look and we see the things that
[2:11:20] they do and the stuff that they allow
[2:11:24] and then god and we think oh well if god
[2:11:26] can use them and operate in a
[2:11:27] supernatural
[2:11:28] how much more you and i
[2:11:32] just as human as anyone else but with a
[2:11:35] high calling
[2:11:37] a calling to operate in a supernatural
[2:11:39] realm
[2:11:40] how much more can he use us amen
[2:11:47] what do you want to be there's a timing
[2:11:50] for deliverance the battle in the land
[2:11:54] and the importance of not rushing ahead
[2:11:56] of the battle plan
[2:11:58] in exodus 23 20 it says
[2:12:01] behold an angel i send an angel before
[2:12:04] thee to keep thee in the way
[2:12:05] and to bring thee into the place which i
[2:12:07] have prepared
[2:12:09] i will send my fear before thee and i
[2:12:12] will destroy all the people
[2:12:13] to whom thou shalt come and i will make
[2:12:16] all thine enemies
[2:12:18] turn their backs unto thee and i will
[2:12:20] send hornets before thee
[2:12:22] which shall drive out the hybrid the
[2:12:24] canaanite and the hittite
[2:12:26] from before thee now we read then we
[2:12:28] think oh my
[2:12:29] they're going to just take that land
[2:12:31] right then and there right it looks like
[2:12:32] it
[2:12:33] and yes god's made the provision for it
[2:12:36] but watch now there is a clause there's
[2:12:38] a catch
[2:12:40] it's timed it's seasonal right
[2:12:45] i will not drive them out from before
[2:12:47] thee in one year
[2:12:48] lest the land become desolate and the
[2:12:50] beasts of the field multiply against
[2:12:52] thee
[2:12:52] by little and little i will drive them
[2:12:54] out from before thee
[2:12:56] until thou be increased and inherit the
[2:12:58] land
[2:12:59] so you see the lord
[2:13:03] in our own life because you see they
[2:13:05] crossed the natural jordan
[2:13:06] and then a captain came down with a
[2:13:08] sword into the land to lead them in the
[2:13:10] battle right
[2:13:11] and he led them and they went to jericho
[2:13:13] and they set the bride free so she could
[2:13:15] marry
[2:13:16] that's first and foremost right is that
[2:13:18] the first and foremost in your life
[2:13:20] when the captain when you really died to
[2:13:22] yourself or maybe you need to do that or
[2:13:24] you've already done that and you've
[2:13:25] received the holy ghost who came down
[2:13:29] the captain came down into your life
[2:13:31] with an open book
[2:13:32] that's the holy ghost the holy spirit
[2:13:35] today
[2:13:36] amen do you understand do you follow
[2:13:38] that
[2:13:40] that's the holy ghost you crossed over
[2:13:41] jordan
[2:13:43] come into the promises of the father
[2:13:45] right
[2:13:46] under the prophet's ministry the ark led
[2:13:48] you across
[2:13:50] and the minister has carried on the
[2:13:51] shoulders of the ministry and you
[2:13:53] died to yourself and you're you know
[2:13:55] down to jordan you know jordan
[2:13:56] carries your sins carried the water goes
[2:13:59] to the dead sea
[2:14:01] you know that the lowest place on the
[2:14:03] earth the dead sea
[2:14:05] the saltier sea you float in it what a
[2:14:07] salt do it preserves
[2:14:10] so what is happening now when you die to
[2:14:12] yourself when you surrender
[2:14:14] absolutely everything that you know you
[2:14:16] the lord knows when you surrender he's
[2:14:18] he might you might not know all the
[2:14:20] things that's going on in your life
[2:14:21] there's still battles ahead but
[2:14:22] whatever is going on in your life right
[2:14:24] then your will
[2:14:25] yourself your ambition you
[2:14:28] as a person and you say lord i give up
[2:14:32] here i am i'm absolutely done
[2:14:35] i'm sick of living in this wilderness
[2:14:37] i'm sick of an emotional
[2:14:39] turmoil i surrender all i surrender all
[2:14:42] my entertainment i surrender all my
[2:14:43] belongings i surrender all my work i
[2:14:45] surrender my dreams my plans
[2:14:47] everything because i am through
[2:14:50] with it all and you follow the word
[2:14:55] as it opens and it takes you across you
[2:14:58] follow it
[2:14:59] and washed in baptism in the name of
[2:15:01] jesus christ
[2:15:03] it washes your sins down
[2:15:07] you got baptized in the red sea come
[2:15:09] through the wilderness now you come to
[2:15:11] jordan
[2:15:12] and all those sins that you carried get
[2:15:14] washed down
[2:15:16] where to the dead sea
[2:15:19] that's where your old nature is to stay
[2:15:21] under preservation until you receive
[2:15:23] your body change
[2:15:24] in the dead sea right that's where
[2:15:26] you've got to pre
[2:15:27] but it doesn't die it's there it's
[2:15:30] destroyed you know that we're destroyed
[2:15:32] means
[2:15:32] dormant what keeps it dormant the dead
[2:15:35] sea
[2:15:36] salty man it gets preserved in salt
[2:15:40] this is all types right it's not literal
[2:15:42] but
[2:15:43] you see your old nature's still there
[2:15:46] and it still tries to rise up
[2:15:47] it says let not sin rain in your mortal
[2:15:50] body to obey it
[2:15:51] and the lusts thereof it desires things
[2:15:53] it wants to come forth again
[2:15:56] let it not so you cross over jordan
[2:15:58] right you cross over and your
[2:16:00] old nature gets washed down and you come
[2:16:03] into the land
[2:16:04] who comes down into your land
[2:16:07] the mighty angel with the open book
[2:16:11] what for he opens
[2:16:15] and he reveals the mystery
[2:16:18] do this reveal these things
[2:16:22] go around the city seven times open the
[2:16:25] book
[2:16:26] to this person he opens the book to you
[2:16:30] why because the rahab inside you
[2:16:33] there's a rahab in each one of us that's
[2:16:36] stuck in a babylonian prison
[2:16:38] stuck but there has to come a time where
[2:16:42] that one's released
[2:16:43] now that gets done first
[2:16:46] you believe that you believe that your
[2:16:49] bright identity your
[2:16:51] identity has to be released so he breaks
[2:16:54] down your jericho walls inside you
[2:16:56] he does that that's his first thing he
[2:16:58] does he has a ceremony in your life
[2:17:01] rolls away the reproach
[2:17:03] and gilgal they called it gilgal it was
[2:17:05] a rolling it means
[2:17:06] and it's the they had the second
[2:17:07] circumcision there where they
[2:17:09] circumcised
[2:17:10] the flesh of egypt that was left for
[2:17:14] years and they they they stopped
[2:17:16] sanctifying themselves
[2:17:17] spiritually speaking and and yet now
[2:17:20] when you come into the land
[2:17:22] you get a re-cleansing it cleanses you
[2:17:25] to prepare you and then the captain
[2:17:27] comes down
[2:17:29] and comes into your life what does he do
[2:17:31] he breaks down that wall
[2:17:33] is that it no he's in the land now
[2:17:36] though
[2:17:37] the spirits in the land who likes that
[2:17:40] who says
[2:17:40] amen the spirits in the land now
[2:17:45] this land the holy ghost with an open
[2:17:48] book
[2:17:49] and that story the sword was drawn he
[2:17:51] was ready to fight the enemy
[2:17:52] he says i send an angel before thee to
[2:17:54] go before thee to send hornets and send
[2:17:56] all these things why
[2:17:57] because i'm delivered these enemies but
[2:18:00] i'm not going to just get rid of them
[2:18:01] all
[2:18:02] at once you're going to deal with these
[2:18:03] things little by little
[2:18:05] but you rest assured don't get condemned
[2:18:08] now
[2:18:08] the moment you get condemned and under
[2:18:10] condemnation you get under fear get
[2:18:12] under guilt
[2:18:12] your campaign stops right there and you
[2:18:15] stand still
[2:18:16] and i can and all those things start to
[2:18:18] come on
[2:18:19] and then you get to fasting like joshua
[2:18:21] and you get to going real serious why is
[2:18:23] there no action in my life what's going
[2:18:25] on lord
[2:18:26] i haven't grown for years i've just
[2:18:28] warmed up you
[2:18:29] oh i've just gone backwards what's going
[2:18:32] on
[2:18:33] what's happening in your heart what's
[2:18:36] happening inside there
[2:18:37] is there faith because it takes faith
[2:18:39] and then you deal with that condemnation
[2:18:44] so that faith can take its place then
[2:18:46] the captain begins to move again
[2:18:48] and the acans get destroyed and all of
[2:18:50] those golden wedges and everything
[2:18:51] starts to happen
[2:18:52] is that the end no there's another one
[2:18:55] then there's another one
[2:18:57] then there's another enemy then all of a
[2:18:58] sudden the gibeonites come and try and
[2:19:01] deceive you and you make it
[2:19:02] make a covenant with the wrong thing
[2:19:04] right like they did
[2:19:06] they deceived they they pretended they
[2:19:09] were
[2:19:09] from far away this happens to us
[2:19:13] this happens in our own land do you
[2:19:15] realize that
[2:19:16] these things happen to us we're going
[2:19:19] through these things
[2:19:20] we sometimes make the covenant with the
[2:19:23] wrong thing
[2:19:24] we think it's right but it's not right
[2:19:27] if we've done that
[2:19:28] just just surrender it to the lord now
[2:19:32] is that the end no all of a sudden you
[2:19:35] think man
[2:19:36] you know then you know what happened to
[2:19:38] israel the all of the amalekites
[2:19:40] confederated
[2:19:41] they had like five nations at them at
[2:19:43] the same time has anyone ever felt like
[2:19:45] you've had
[2:19:46] five troubles come at you at once
[2:19:49] five troubles you know you're one's
[2:19:51] enough and you get five
[2:19:53] and you think man what have i done lord
[2:19:57] how did i go get to this level where did
[2:19:59] i go wrong
[2:20:00] you ain't got wrong they didn't go well
[2:20:02] you know they made a covenant with the
[2:20:03] gibeonites but
[2:20:04] they didn't go wrong god knew he said i
[2:20:07] sent hornets
[2:20:08] he didn't take back his hornets he
[2:20:11] hasn't taken back his hornets by the way
[2:20:13] you can still have hornets you can still
[2:20:15] have pestilences for the on the enemy
[2:20:17] you can send bees and wasp to them you
[2:20:19] know i've sent bees and wasps to the
[2:20:21] enemy
[2:20:22] i sent pestilence upon him
[2:20:25] he makes me angry righteous anger
[2:20:29] have i done something again every time a
[2:20:31] man leaves that desk i'm like oh no
[2:20:33] i've done something bad
[2:20:37] he hasn't taken back what he said he's
[2:20:40] got all of these things ready
[2:20:41] to deliver your enemies and he will
[2:20:45] and he is and you just got to keep
[2:20:47] walking
[2:20:48] and you come up to those five
[2:20:49] confederate amalekites
[2:20:52] and you might fall on the ground a few
[2:20:53] times and you might get
[2:20:55] you might get stuck there for years i
[2:20:58] know that sounds bad but
[2:21:00] it does happen you might get stuck there
[2:21:02] for years at one spot
[2:21:04] israel dude says in joshua man this one
[2:21:07] here
[2:21:07] dan and they just slobbed slothed around
[2:21:10] you know
[2:21:11] they took they didn't inherit the land
[2:21:13] and it reads out the report of
[2:21:15] you know joshua is almost ready to be
[2:21:17] passed away
[2:21:18] and it reads out the status the current
[2:21:20] status and
[2:21:21] that none of them really hardly took all
[2:21:23] of their inheritance right
[2:21:25] they were still heats to take but it was
[2:21:27] too hard
[2:21:29] it was hard they had to do something oh
[2:21:31] my they had to believe
[2:21:33] but what happened was they made they
[2:21:35] made confederate with this one and they
[2:21:37] made a little covenant there what
[2:21:38] happened god says stop doing that
[2:21:41] but you see now what is that and if we
[2:21:44] bring that into our own experience
[2:21:46] you made a confederate with fear you
[2:21:49] made a confederate with condemnation
[2:21:50] guilt you made a confederate with lust
[2:21:52] you made a confederate of jealousy you
[2:21:54] made a confederate with
[2:21:55] whatever despair depression whatever
[2:21:58] these things that comes down and what do
[2:22:00] you do
[2:22:01] you stay on the ground and you sit and
[2:22:03] you lie on the ground crying
[2:22:05] and you don't move for years and all of
[2:22:08] a sudden someone preaches something
[2:22:10] and they say no you stand up now stand
[2:22:12] up and address your enemy now
[2:22:15] it's time to stand up and address your
[2:22:17] enemy you'll become big again
[2:22:18] hallelujah humble but big huh
[2:22:22] real humble but big they humble
[2:22:24] themselves shall be exalted
[2:22:26] and exalt themselves should be abased
[2:22:28] but you've got to stand
[2:22:30] against your enemy of condemnation
[2:22:33] because condemnation will not disable me
[2:22:36] it will not disable you if i let
[2:22:40] condemnation disable me
[2:22:41] i would not be doing this if i let
[2:22:44] condemnation disable me
[2:22:47] i would just sit in the pew and do
[2:22:49] nothing
[2:22:50] that's right because i do things wrong i
[2:22:53] make mistakes
[2:22:55] and i don't and i know the lord doesn't
[2:22:57] like it and i make it right
[2:22:58] i make it again does the lord go are you
[2:23:01] making too many i'm not going to forgive
[2:23:02] you now
[2:23:03] no but the lord will deal with those
[2:23:06] things
[2:23:07] but i can't make him deal with it right
[2:23:09] now i do
[2:23:11] you know he said that to israel i will
[2:23:13] drive them out when i want to drive them
[2:23:15] out
[2:23:15] when i see you're ready to handle the
[2:23:17] because you see when you get victory
[2:23:19] over that thing
[2:23:20] that's another portion of power
[2:23:24] that you have in your inheritance and
[2:23:26] you begin to be able to do something
[2:23:27] more
[2:23:27] in christ a little bit more power gets
[2:23:29] allotted or you get access to more
[2:23:32] you know like when you i shouldn't do
[2:23:34] use video games but you know the more
[2:23:35] you go through a game
[2:23:36] the more access you get to its things
[2:23:39] and powers and whatever
[2:23:40] well it's kind of you know the devils
[2:23:42] that's just the devil's perversion
[2:23:44] of the real christian because you see
[2:23:48] the more you go through the game of life
[2:23:50] that god has allotted to you
[2:23:51] and this is a better game than sitting
[2:23:53] on a stupid little plastic thing
[2:23:55] in front of a tv that just that's just
[2:23:59] boring man
[2:24:00] boring what about playing the real game
[2:24:03] this is better graphics this is far
[2:24:06] better graphics caleb
[2:24:08] i'm telling you now no man can create
[2:24:10] these graphics
[2:24:11] this is real good these eyes have got
[2:24:13] the best graphic enhanced
[2:24:15] you know technology and like virtual
[2:24:18] reality you know this is reality reality
[2:24:21] and we're walking through this and as
[2:24:23] you grow in christ
[2:24:24] he unlocks more power as that next enemy
[2:24:28] now don't get condemned because the
[2:24:29] enemy is still there
[2:24:31] don't get condemned because that family
[2:24:32] traits still pulling you
[2:24:34] down and getting you down on the ground
[2:24:37] don't be condemned by it stay in an
[2:24:39] atmosphere of faith
[2:24:40] stay in faith even though that's
[2:24:42] happening stay in faith stay in the
[2:24:44] ministry stay walking
[2:24:46] continue on continue walking
[2:24:49] because you're gonna if you get if you
[2:24:52] stay still
[2:24:53] the encampment for that enemy for that
[2:24:55] amalekite might be 10 kilometers that
[2:24:57] way
[2:24:57] in um type world
[2:25:01] yeah like it might be just over there
[2:25:03] and if you're not walking you'll never
[2:25:05] get to that encampment
[2:25:06] but it will continue condemning you
[2:25:07] condemning you condemning you because
[2:25:09] you've seen your life
[2:25:10] it's in your land but you've got to
[2:25:12] advance
[2:25:13] and you've got to walk up to those
[2:25:14] amalekites and now the trials come
[2:25:17] now the battle gets an array now it gets
[2:25:20] hot and heavy
[2:25:21] now all that stuff that was condemning
[2:25:23] you now you're facing it now you're
[2:25:25] really failing
[2:25:26] now you're really going through it now
[2:25:28] is the time
[2:25:30] now great jehovah eagle comes down and
[2:25:32] swoops down and
[2:25:33] and he crushes them with hornets and
[2:25:36] crushes them and the angel of the lord
[2:25:37] which is in you
[2:25:39] comes and he says
[2:25:42] here devil get out of here
[2:25:46] amen and everything gets destroyed
[2:25:50] and you take that portion you take that
[2:25:51] embankment you take that land
[2:25:53] now it's yours now all of a sudden your
[2:25:55] prayer life becomes
[2:25:57] you just become like you've just got
[2:25:59] more status
[2:26:01] more more more levels you know no i
[2:26:04] don't mean
[2:26:05] that people are like this or levels
[2:26:06] everyone's the same of god and there's
[2:26:07] no respect they're a person
[2:26:09] but on a inheritance level
[2:26:12] why settle for that much
[2:26:17] when the land is that much all yours
[2:26:21] and he says i'll give you this and i'll
[2:26:23] give you this and i'll give you this
[2:26:25] you see now you haven't got this part
[2:26:28] yet the devil's still squatting on that
[2:26:30] but you've got this and all the power
[2:26:32] and all the access and all the arcade
[2:26:34] that brother ben was talking about
[2:26:35] is here and here but you haven't got to
[2:26:38] that yet
[2:26:39] now there's things in this part that you
[2:26:41] haven't got to yet
[2:26:42] that you're failing at still because the
[2:26:44] enemy's squatting
[2:26:46] and you're getting condemned by that but
[2:26:48] hold on a minute
[2:26:50] who's leading the battle who is leading
[2:26:54] the battle
[2:26:55] he just the head is this one right this
[2:26:57] is part of your inheritance
[2:26:59] just ahead but you're getting condemned
[2:27:02] by it and you're not even facing it yet
[2:27:04] you need to walk so you need to get up
[2:27:07] address the enemy
[2:27:08] say devil i'm through with this
[2:27:11] condemnation
[2:27:12] i'm sick of just sitting here i'm going
[2:27:13] forward and i'm going to walk forward
[2:27:15] and all of a sudden
[2:27:16] i'm facing that now the thing that was
[2:27:19] condemning me
[2:27:20] sitting there sitting pretty they call
[2:27:22] it it's just sitting pretty in the land
[2:27:24] no no no nothing you might pray a little
[2:27:26] bit about it and it might cause a little
[2:27:28] bit of something on him but you're not
[2:27:30] facing it yet
[2:27:31] you see to face the enemy the enemy's
[2:27:32] got to surface
[2:27:34] to face that complex in your land to
[2:27:37] face that family trait that's got to
[2:27:38] surface
[2:27:40] you might go through council to face it
[2:27:42] and the pastor will sit there and talk
[2:27:44] and you'll explain a story and as you
[2:27:46] explain it you break down
[2:27:48] and you wonder why am i crying it's the
[2:27:50] holy ghost
[2:27:51] and in a pastoral ministry and in
[2:27:53] council
[2:27:54] the holy ghost brings it out it's like
[2:27:57] drawing it out of you
[2:27:58] and it's right up here in the room now
[2:28:00] this demon and the demons there that's
[2:28:02] been troubling you all your life but
[2:28:04] you're facing it now
[2:28:05] it's there it's real and the reason you
[2:28:07] got there is because you started walking
[2:28:10] and you got closer and closer to the
[2:28:11] embankment all of a sudden the captain
[2:28:13] says now
[2:28:14] and you read the urum of them or
[2:28:15] whatever you call it you read in the
[2:28:17] word
[2:28:18] it says now you know the lord he you
[2:28:20] consult the lord and you're reading and
[2:28:22] all of a sudden something illuminates
[2:28:23] with you
[2:28:23] you're like well that's actually
[2:28:25] something i've been struggling with and
[2:28:26] then you get to church and the preacher
[2:28:27] preaches exactly on that thing
[2:28:29] and you're like man i'm undone then the
[2:28:31] next monday you're calling the pastor i
[2:28:33] need a meeting
[2:28:34] i need to talk about this and you sit
[2:28:36] down and you talk about it and you go
[2:28:38] through and
[2:28:38] and the lord brings it out and you say
[2:28:41] oh my
[2:28:42] and you pray through for something and
[2:28:44] that and then all of a sudden you take
[2:28:45] it right
[2:28:46] so you've got a little bit more and then
[2:28:49] you
[2:28:50] and and now there's still stuff here
[2:28:52] squatters in your land right and they're
[2:28:54] still troubling
[2:28:55] they're still doing things that are
[2:28:56] every now and again the devil cycles
[2:28:58] around and he's cycling around these
[2:29:00] things that you haven't conquered yet
[2:29:01] and you just keep cycling around that
[2:29:03] and you just what he wants to do
[2:29:05] he doesn't want advancement he doesn't
[2:29:08] want you to advance
[2:29:09] further in your inheritance so what does
[2:29:11] he do he wants to keep you
[2:29:12] here he knows he can't take that back
[2:29:14] from you he you
[2:29:15] you've got that and your level with god
[2:29:18] and your
[2:29:18] your power with god you know jacob he
[2:29:22] wrestled with the angel and he got power
[2:29:24] with god right
[2:29:25] this is a level with god this is an
[2:29:27] experience with god where he
[2:29:29] and now he had power how much more now
[2:29:32] under the new testament can you get
[2:29:34] power with god right
[2:29:36] so this is your power with god but here
[2:29:38] which is your land and it is your
[2:29:40] inheritance and it is the opening of the
[2:29:42] word it is all yours but they're still
[2:29:45] in in your land
[2:29:46] is still some troublesome enemies and
[2:29:49] they're
[2:29:50] causing you to feel guilt when you fail
[2:29:52] at that one and fail at this one and
[2:29:54] fail at this one
[2:29:55] and and and what he wants to do is
[2:29:57] render you
[2:29:59] useless even with all the stuff you've
[2:30:01] already got
[2:30:03] can you think about that just think
[2:30:04] about that here's a person and i'm
[2:30:07] speaking to people in here
[2:30:08] that maybe you know some people are
[2:30:10] probably here
[2:30:11] and they've still got just this little
[2:30:12] bit and then it's a rapture body change
[2:30:14] here you know
[2:30:15] let's just look at it like that now this
[2:30:18] is just my own little analogy but
[2:30:20] let's say the body change is here i'm on
[2:30:23] this map
[2:30:24] yeah we're going to leave the earth so
[2:30:26] there's the body change
[2:30:28] we might some of us might be there but
[2:30:30] if you're under condemnation
[2:30:32] all the stuff that's in here that's
[2:30:34] yours is not used
[2:30:36] because you're in condemnation you've
[2:30:37] got no confidence with god
[2:30:40] so but and what's condemning you is one
[2:30:42] last little devil on this side here
[2:30:44] not in the book okay don't let me don't
[2:30:46] it's not in the word
[2:30:48] that's on your land and it's stopping
[2:30:50] your access to this part of the word
[2:30:52] right
[2:30:53] so i'm not talking about the word having
[2:30:54] enemies in it the word doesn't have no
[2:30:55] enemies in it
[2:30:56] it's your land that has the enemies in
[2:30:58] it but it's covering over
[2:31:00] that portion of your inheritance right
[2:31:01] you've got to conquer that
[2:31:03] now you need to
[2:31:06] this here this here this is still a
[2:31:09] squatter
[2:31:10] and he's just causing you that grief and
[2:31:11] he's the last one so he's going to go
[2:31:13] real hard on you
[2:31:14] he's like real angry like the devil now
[2:31:16] it says in the book of revelation that
[2:31:18] he's
[2:31:18] real angry because he knows his time is
[2:31:20] short right so he's just putting all of
[2:31:21] his
[2:31:22] effort and he's trained his eyes on us
[2:31:24] his target hears his crosshairs are on
[2:31:26] you
[2:31:27] but fear not the angel is before you
[2:31:31] amen and so the purpose of the devil is
[2:31:34] to take
[2:31:35] this last squatter that's causing you
[2:31:37] trouble
[2:31:38] and condemn you so that you still become
[2:31:40] useless and he's going to try that all
[2:31:42] the way down until one day he's all been
[2:31:44] delivered
[2:31:46] amen that's why the book came open to
[2:31:48] you here
[2:31:49] open one day open genesis serpent seed
[2:31:52] open all of the abraham open all of
[2:31:54] jacob open all of
[2:31:55] moses open all of exodus open all of
[2:31:57] deuteronomy show what the laws and
[2:31:59] all of that open all of joshua and all
[2:32:01] of samuel
[2:32:03] amen and you can see open all of the
[2:32:05] books of the kings and all
[2:32:06] you see yourself in all of it right and
[2:32:08] all those prophets and all
[2:32:10] the prophecies and you see yourself in
[2:32:11] mark matthew luke and john the lion the
[2:32:13] ox the man the eagle
[2:32:14] through to revelation 4 and you're
[2:32:16] caught up by a prophet's message up into
[2:32:18] revelation chapter 4 and you understand
[2:32:19] all of that stuff given your inheritance
[2:32:21] right through to the
[2:32:23] things that are to be through to the end
[2:32:26] it's all there right and you're getting
[2:32:29] little bits
[2:32:30] but if you get under a condemnation in
[2:32:34] your heart or a fear or whatever a weary
[2:32:37] and it's not dealt with you stay right
[2:32:39] there
[2:32:40] and then you lose that you don't lose
[2:32:41] access but it becomes
[2:32:43] they call it um i don't even know the
[2:32:46] word
[2:32:46] there's a term where or it's like a
[2:32:49] caveat
[2:32:50] you lose the access to your inheritance
[2:32:53] because there's a
[2:32:54] when you get under condemnation it
[2:32:56] places a caveat on what you've already
[2:32:57] got
[2:32:58] and it stops you from gaining anything
[2:33:00] more right
[2:33:02] what is that fear condemnation devil's
[2:33:05] tactics
[2:33:06] leveraging off your old nature does
[2:33:08] everyone
[2:33:09] understand what i mean was that a good
[2:33:11] analogy to understand
[2:33:13] what i'm talking about i'm nearly about
[2:33:16] to close by the way
[2:33:18] i'm about to close josh
[2:33:21] sorry i might do the same thing
[2:33:24] i'm about to close becca
[2:33:28] children eh i love me
[2:33:32] okay i've got one more quote if we can
[2:33:35] have the musicians please
[2:34:00] so
[2:34:04] can you play that song not today isaac
[2:34:07] are you ready
[2:34:11] not today
[2:34:21] which is the basic version
[2:34:27] you know the devil can try condemn us to
[2:34:29] a crippled state
[2:34:31] for enemies in our life that will only
[2:34:33] be dealt with later
[2:34:35] in the battle there might just be a few
[2:34:38] more stations to conquer
[2:34:40] before such a time you know so we we
[2:34:43] don't want to get condemned by
[2:34:45] enemies that aren't yet to be delivered
[2:34:49] right does everyone follow and the
[2:34:52] messiah
[2:34:57] prophet says this now when a man is
[2:34:59] converted say
[2:35:00] just like that little white button
[2:35:02] starts in his heart
[2:35:04] now that part is god god
[2:35:07] when he's born again with the spirit of
[2:35:09] god god's spirit dwells in him
[2:35:13] now as he can let that spirit grow and
[2:35:16] take out
[2:35:16] all the roots of bitterness don't you
[2:35:18] love that
[2:35:19] you know we sometimes think that you get
[2:35:21] the holy ghost after all that's done
[2:35:23] right
[2:35:24] but no the holy ghost comes in to begin
[2:35:26] that real internal battle that i've just
[2:35:28] been speaking about in your land inside
[2:35:30] your body
[2:35:31] right this is what he's talking about
[2:35:34] he's talking about the holy ghost coming
[2:35:36] into you like a little white button
[2:35:38] the size of that button there see just a
[2:35:41] little bit of light
[2:35:42] comes in but now you feed listen here
[2:35:46] you feed him on the word
[2:35:49] it says now as he can let that spirit
[2:35:51] grow and take out all the roots of
[2:35:53] bitterness
[2:35:54] and press god's way through him again he
[2:35:57] can become back
[2:35:58] in the same condition that he was when
[2:36:01] he was in the garden of eden
[2:36:03] don't you love that that god will create
[2:36:05] an identity condition in your life
[2:36:08] can you imagine like the paradise
[2:36:10] unfallen
[2:36:11] paradise inside you there your flesh
[2:36:15] will still be raging enemies and
[2:36:17] just dealing with the world in that way
[2:36:20] but inside is a as an ethernet condition
[2:36:23] ruling in love amen
[2:36:29] i mean who doesn't want any genetic
[2:36:30] condition inside them i mean how this is
[2:36:32] as great as it gets
[2:36:37] jesus said in mark 11 24 verily verily i
[2:36:40] say unto you if you say to this mountain
[2:36:42] be moved and don't doubt it in your
[2:36:43] heart
[2:36:44] but believe that you've you have what
[2:36:46] you said will come to pass
[2:36:48] you can have what you said that puts him
[2:36:51] right back supreme again
[2:36:53] it puts him right back in the condition
[2:36:57] now we're made up of light meters inside
[2:36:59] of us as cosmic light
[2:37:01] now that cosmic light is a light that
[2:37:03] they can take an x-ray with
[2:37:06] the x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray
[2:37:08] light it comes from your own light
[2:37:10] and then if that cosmic light say could
[2:37:12] be pushed to a place
[2:37:14] to with not cosmic light but eternal
[2:37:16] light god could dwell supremely
[2:37:20] to do our thinking do our walking do our
[2:37:22] talking
[2:37:23] then it's no longer the man it's god
[2:37:27] in the man
[2:37:34] this is the final quote here has and i
[2:37:37] just want to ask you this question
[2:37:40] has the lamb step forth
[2:37:46] with the bleach
[2:37:51] to you to you personal
[2:37:55] if he hasn't today is the day that you
[2:37:57] need to settle the account
[2:37:59] with god has he
[2:38:03] it's a personal contact that's a
[2:38:05] personal revelation
[2:38:07] and i ask you has he if he hasn't today
[2:38:11] is the day for you
[2:38:15] it's here but here is the mediator
[2:38:18] standing there if you just want to play
[2:38:21] okay sweet
[2:38:25] but here is the mediator standing there
[2:38:28] amen
[2:38:28] the kinsmen redeemer amen stand there
[2:38:31] with the blood
[2:38:33] that can take the vilest sinner's heart
[2:38:35] and change it
[2:38:37] the mediator is on the throne yes sir
[2:38:41] satan said but they're guilty
[2:38:44] he can say they're not
[2:38:47] that clorox was invented who knows what
[2:38:49] clorox is
[2:38:51] bleach clorox is bleach
[2:38:55] that bleach was invented or manufactured
[2:38:57] to take
[2:38:58] stain to take the coloring out of ink
[2:39:02] or any other stain they got it
[2:39:05] it'll break up so you never will find it
[2:39:08] again it goes back to gases
[2:39:10] and all the way back to cosmic light
[2:39:13] and past molecules and everything else
[2:39:16] till it turns back to the original
[2:39:18] where it come from
[2:39:23] is he your lamb i ask you this question
[2:39:26] today
[2:39:27] young and old is he your lamb
[2:39:32] has he stepped forth into your heart
[2:39:36] opened his word and said take
[2:39:40] and eat for this is my body
[2:39:44] that is given to you has he done that
[2:39:48] and has he become a lion to your enemies
[2:39:53] because when he he's your lamb but he's
[2:39:56] got to be a lion to your enemies
[2:39:58] amen you understand when he comes into
[2:40:02] your heart

[2:40:06] enemies
[2:40:07] that a lamb to you see the lamb is on

[2:40:18] heart
[2:40:19] so that intercession can happen for you

[2:51:54] say from that time
[2:51:57] i'll never be the same again not because
[2:52:02] of the preacher not because of the music
[2:52:06] but because of the word of god who's
[2:52:09] come to declare a jubilee
[2:52:11] it is jubilee time it is time
[2:52:16] that we make a stand
[2:52:20] that we will not let fear doubt
[2:52:24] pay lust
[2:52:28] envy resentment
[2:52:32] backbiting
[2:52:35] all of these evil traits find us anymore
[2:52:40] we may struggle with these things
[2:52:43] but today if there's someone in here
[2:52:46] that has drawn a light in the sand and
[2:52:48] said no more devil
[2:52:51] i want you to pray with me we're going
[2:52:54] to pray together
[2:52:56] we've sung this song and i really wanted
[2:52:58] to sing this song because
[2:53:00] we can really toe the line with the
[2:53:03] enemy
[2:53:04] say i'm not going to live a natural life
[2:53:06] no longer
[2:53:08] alone i'm gonna walk with god in my land
[2:53:13] i've got a little bit or maybe i've got
[2:53:15] a lot
[2:53:16] but there's more because i haven't had a
[2:53:18] body change yet
[2:53:20] we're somewhere along the line things
[2:53:23] where are you
[2:53:25] who are you what do you want
[2:53:28] what is your desire my desire
[2:53:33] is a rapture my desire is to leave
[2:53:36] and be part of this eternal kingdom i'm
[2:53:39] sick of this world
[2:53:40] to be right beautiful brutally honest
[2:53:42] i'm tired of this world
[2:53:44] this world's got an end this world is a
[2:53:46] fail
[2:53:47] and if anybody thinks that they're
[2:53:49] having fun you've got
[2:53:51] nothing compared to what is fun up in
[2:53:54] him
[2:53:55] this is nothing we think we're holding
[2:53:58] on to our little creature comforts
[2:54:00] our little hobbies they're nothing
[2:54:02] compared to what we're having
[2:54:04] and we're going to go there soon and so
[2:54:08] who are you eternal beings
[2:54:11] who are you who never began and will
[2:54:13] never end

[2:54:17] scheme

[2:54:23] but this is all yours all of it
[2:54:27] this whole inheritance is open
[2:54:30] to you not because you're anything
[2:54:33] different than any other saint of any
[2:54:35] other age
[2:54:36] but because of the time that you're
[2:54:38] living in the messes you were born under
[2:54:41] the signs that you were born under the
[2:54:43] time
[2:54:44] of the fullness of all things you just
[2:54:47] happen to be chosen

[2:56:39] day that condemnation is dealt with
[2:56:41] today is the day that doubt has dealt
[2:56:43] with today's the day that
[2:56:45] your heart no longer condemns you
[2:56:48] today's the day that you stand up to the
[2:56:51] proud boastful devil
[2:56:52] that's been wandering around you and
[2:56:54] every time you try and get up
[2:56:56] he beats you down with a three-sided
[2:56:58] club until you're crying on the floor
[2:57:00] unsure of who you are but today is the
[2:57:03] day
[2:57:04] toe the line draw it in the sand and say
[2:57:07] my
[2:57:08] little desire is going to be turned into
[2:57:09] a fire

[2:57:13] mine
[2:57:14] today i'm going to let it show there is

[2:57:36] this desire
[2:57:38] and turn it into something beautiful i'm
[2:57:41] gonna let god i'm gonna let that little
[2:57:43] white button of light that came into me
[2:57:45] at some camp at youth camp or at
[2:57:48] wherever it was
[2:57:50] i'm gonna let or or some great moment
[2:57:53] in my life where that light came in i'm
[2:57:56] gonna let that light just push out a bit
[2:57:58] more now
[2:57:59] because i'm not condemned anymore i
[2:58:01] realize that the blood is more powerful
[2:58:03] god is greater he sees more he wants me
[2:58:05] to function
[2:58:06] i'm not going to pull back anymore i'm
[2:58:08] not going to just pull back
[2:58:09] because i'm condemned by my habits i'm
[2:58:12] going to be part of this vision
[2:58:14] because now i can move and advance to
[2:58:16] the next portion of my inheritance

[2:58:20] never get to that thing that's troubling
[2:58:21] me
