[7:12] [Music]
[7:58] Praise the Lord. God bless you all this
[7:59] morning.
[8:02] We are we must be a reasonably young
[8:04] church
[8:06] because um we have a we have a youth
[8:09] banquet and half the church is gone
[8:14] which is a good thing.
[8:16] I love young people. I like the
[8:20] there's a there's a bit of a pliableness
[8:21] about a young about young people. Yeah.
[8:24] And a
[8:28] they can be influenced,
[8:31] you know, and know you can actually when
[8:33] when when you think back you into your
[8:35] sort of teenage years or late teens,
[8:37] early 20s, I guarantee there were
[8:39] probably people that changed your life
[8:41] that maybe they didn't know that they
[8:43] did, but in a good way, they they
[8:44] influenced you a certain way. I know
[8:46] there are in my life and these people
[8:47] didn't know they were, but because we're
[8:48] influential, you know, we can go we can
[8:51] be influenced either way. And
[8:54] yeah, I know that we all there are
[8:56] probably people in your life at the
[8:58] moment that you're influencing and and
[9:00] you're going to influence the course of
[9:02] their life, younger people. So may we
[9:06] get to the end of the road and our
[9:07] influence on life on the world has been
[9:09] a good influence, you know, to to it's
[9:12] been to encourage people, to help
[9:13] people, and to to lead people on along.
[9:17] Not not you don't lead everyone to
[9:19] Christ. Some you do, but other people
[9:21] just wherever you can try and lead
[9:23] people in a good way and and influence
[9:25] the world in a good way. So, let's um
[9:26] let's stand this morning. We'll pray for
[9:28] the youth. We'll pray for us here. We'll
[9:29] just pray for the service. I believe the
[9:31] Lord's going to bless us this morning.
[9:33] Lord, we thank you, Lord, that we've got
[9:34] so many youth in our midst.
[9:37] Lord, that there's life amongst us and
[9:40] and even it's a miracle in this age
[9:42] where there are so many distractions,
[9:44] Lord. the the world is engineered.
[9:46] Satan's engineered the world to capture
[9:48] the youth, Lord, to do what he can to
[9:50] capture them. And he's got so many
[9:53] devices and they they have so much
[9:56] against them, more so than probably
[10:00] a lot of the generations that have ever
[10:02] walked upon the face of the earth, Lord.
[10:04] And yet here we are, Lord. There there
[10:07] are a lot of youth here serving you,
[10:09] wanting, desiring to serve and love you,
[10:11] Lord. And we thank you so much for that.
[10:13] We thank you for a great fellowship. We
[10:14] thank you for a great pastor and his
[10:16] wife and family and and brothers and
[10:19] sisters here, Lord, that that are that
[10:20] have stood up and willing to fight the
[10:22] good fight of faith, Lord, to to make a
[10:24] ground for you, Lord, to what we can
[10:26] call holy ground, Lord, and to claim it
[10:27] for your kingdom, to stand, Lord, to
[10:30] resist against the evil, to Lord, to
[10:32] push back against lies, against the
[10:37] the ways of Satan that he would try and
[10:40] put upon man and and the roads he would
[10:43] try and lead people down. Lord, we we've
[10:45] made a stand and we we desire, Lord, to
[10:48] set ground to gain ground for you to to
[10:50] impart your word into people's lives,
[10:52] into young people's lives, Lord, and to
[10:54] lead people down the paths of
[10:56] righteousness,
[10:57] Lord. I thank you for each one here,
[10:58] Lord, that that's doing that for this
[11:00] fellowship, Lord. And we can see the
[11:01] influence that it's having, Lord, and
[11:03] that and that there are the young people
[11:05] want to have a desire to walk down the
[11:07] same paths of righteousness,
[11:09] Lord. And we know that it's not
[11:10] man-made. It's not just because we can
[11:12] cunningly do it a certain way. We know
[11:14] it's by your spirit, Lord. And yet,
[11:15] you've called us to to to act and to do
[11:18] and to stand, Lord, and to preach and to
[11:21] fight the good fight of faith, Lord. So,
[11:22] I just pray a blessing upon each one
[11:24] here this morning that continues to
[11:25] fight the good fight of faith. Lord, at
[11:27] the end of the road, I think we'll see
[11:28] the influence that we had, Lord. Even if
[11:30] people here don't realize that they're
[11:32] so influential to every person here and
[11:34] to those around them. So, I just want to
[11:35] pray a blessing and just pray your bless
[11:36] this morning, Lord, in Jesus wonderful
[11:38] name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We're
[11:41] going to have a good service this
[11:42] morning. I can feel the presence of the
[11:44] Lord here already. Some glad morning
[11:46] when this life is over, I'll fly away.

[11:53] over, I

[26:29] worship the Lord before we call up Ben.
[26:33] [Music]
[27:01] In Christ alone
[27:04] my hope is found.
[27:07] He is my light, my strength, my song.
[27:13] This corner storm,
[27:15] this solid ground,
[27:19] firm through the fiercest drought and
[27:22] storm.
[27:24] What heights of love?
[27:27] What depths of peace?
[27:30] When fears are still,
[27:33] when striving cease.
[27:36] [Music]
[27:39] hide all in all
[27:42] here in the love of Christ
[27:46] I said
[27:48] [Music]
[27:51] in Christ alone
[27:54] who took on flesh
[27:57] fullness of God in helpless
[28:01] faith
[28:03] this gift of love
[28:06] and righteousness
[28:09] scorned by the ones he came to save.
[28:15] Till on that cross
[28:18] as Jesus died,
[28:21] all the wrath of God
[28:24] was satisfied
[28:27] till every sin
[28:30] on him was laid.
[28:33] Here in the death of Christ
[28:37] I live.
[28:44] His body laid
[28:47] a flight of the world by darkness.
[28:51] [Music]
[28:53] Then bursting forth in glorious day.
[28:59] Up from the grave he rose
[29:03] again.
[29:05] And as he stands
[29:08] in victory,
[29:10] sin's curse has lost its grip on me.
[29:16] For I am his and he is mine.
[29:23] Walk with the precious blood
[29:26] of Ben as he stands. And as he stands
[29:31] in victory,
[29:34] sin's curse has lost his grip on me.
[29:40] For I am his
[29:43] and he is mine.
[29:46] Bought with the precious blood
[29:49] of Christ.
[29:54] No fear in g,
[29:57] no fear in death.
[30:00] This is the power of Christ in me.
[30:06] From life's first cry
[30:09] till final breath.
[30:12] Jesus commands my destiny.
[30:18] No power of hell,
[30:21] no scheme of man
[30:24] can ever pluck
[30:27] me from his hand till he returns
[30:33] or he calls me home
[30:36] here in the power of Christ. No power of
[30:40] hell,
[30:41] no power of hell,
[30:44] no scheme of man
[30:47] can ever block
[30:50] me from his hand
[30:53] till he returns
[30:56] or calls me home.
[31:00] Here in the hour of Christ
[31:03] I stand.
[31:07] [Music]
[31:16] There is a source
[31:20] in times of need
[31:23] that gives me hope.
[31:27] That brings me peace
[31:31] in every trial.
[31:34] Through every tear

[31:46] There is a source
[31:50] in times of need
[31:53] that gives me hope.
[31:57] that brings me peace.
[32:01] In every trial,
[32:05] through every test,
[32:08] my Savior stands
[32:12] in my defense.
[32:15] So when the road you walk
[32:20] leaves you tight and warm,
[32:23] all your strength is gone.
[32:27] and your heart feels.
[32:31] Remember God
[32:34] is greater than the storm.
[32:39] Take courage.
[32:42] The battle is the Lord.
[32:46] And when the waters rise,
[32:50] he calls my name
[32:53] and bids me calm
[32:57] out of the waves.
[33:01] And he holds my hand,
[33:05] lest I should fall

[41:05] the banquet's on. Or was last night.
[41:06] Everyone looked fancy from the photos I
[41:08] saw. So thankful that they could go
[41:10] enjoy that. Amen. Um let's go on the
[41:13] scripture um this morning to 2 Timothy 3
[41:17] and um yeah we're going to just have a
[41:20] good time in the Lord this morning I
[41:21] believe so good to have everyone here.
[41:27] Amen. Everyone feeling well?
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. Good.
[41:33] Amen. So 2 Timothy 3 and we'll read
[41:36] verses 1 to5
[41:38] and says know this also that in the last
[41:41] days perilous times shall come for men
[41:44] shall be lovers of their own selves
[41:46] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[41:49] disobedient appears unthankful unholy
[41:52] without natural affection truce breakers
[41:54] false accusers incontinent fierce
[41:57] despisers of those that are good
[41:59] traitors hyminded lovers of pleasure
[42:01] more than lovers of God having a form of
[42:04] godliness but denying the power of from
[42:06] such turn away. My what a description of
[42:09] a I pray none of us are in that category
[42:12] this morning. Amen. But and and then
[42:14] also we're going to read, you don't need
[42:15] to turn to it, but we're going to read
[42:16] Matthew 24 and 24 here. It says, "For
[42:20] there shall arise false Christs and
[42:23] false prophets and shall show great
[42:25] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[42:27] were possible, aren't you glad it's not
[42:28] possible?" Amen. They would deceive the
[42:31] very elect. Amen. So, let's uh let's bow
[42:34] heads in a word of prayer this morning
[42:36] and um yeah, amen. Let's commit our
[42:38] lives to the Lord to and and this
[42:39] service. Amen. Lord Jesus, we're so
[42:42] thankful, Lord, that we can truly sing.
[42:44] Lord, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Lord,
[42:47] we give you glory this day, Lord. Thank
[42:48] you. We can gather as a people today. I
[42:51] pray, Father, that your great presence
[42:52] would be very tangible, very real. Lord,
[42:55] I pray you'd take your word, anchor it
[42:56] into our hearts, Lord. I pray go beyond
[42:59] language barriers today, Lord. May your
[43:01] anointing speak to every life Lord and
[43:03] not only here but Lord also those who
[43:05] are away Lord. We think of the youth
[43:07] Lord up in Tanaki for the banquet Lord.
[43:09] I just pray they would have had a
[43:10] blessed time last night. Blessed time
[43:12] this morning Lord. May you bring them
[43:14] safely home to us dear God. And Father
[43:16] be with all those who are traveling Lord
[43:17] Jesus be with those who are unwell in
[43:19] body who couldn't be here today. I ask
[43:21] dear God may your presence be so real
[43:23] with them too. Lord you're a personal
[43:25] God. You said I'll never leave thee nor
[43:26] forsake thee. I'll be with you even in
[43:28] you to the end of the world. So I pray
[43:30] father that Lord you'd speak to their
[43:31] lives too Lord then those sick and body
[43:33] may you raise them up Lord may you meet
[43:35] every need Lord God we want to commit
[43:38] our lives into your hands Lord take
[43:39] complete control Lord of speaker myself
[43:42] and hear Lord those who are listening
[43:43] Lord for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[43:46] name amen
[43:48] God bless you friends you can have your
[43:49] seats this morning so I want to speak
[43:52] about perilous times today and we're
[43:55] going to go it's not all going to be
[43:57] negative as such it's going to go
[43:58] positive positive. But you know, I find
[44:00] it very interesting uh the arrangement
[44:03] that that the scriptures laid in. You
[44:05] know, it's like, you know, when you read
[44:06] the gospels, there's a reason why
[44:09] certain things happen, then a parables
[44:10] taught, then another thing happens. It's
[44:12] all in a certain order of events. It's
[44:15] like the same with brother's ministry
[44:17] is, you know, you know, there's a reason
[44:19] certain messages were preached at
[44:20] certain times. You know, for example,
[44:22] like there's a statue of a perfect man,
[44:24] then there's a guide, and then there's
[44:25] all these different sermons that are
[44:27] clumped together, and it's actually
[44:28] telling a story or it's an unfolding of
[44:30] a truth. Now, we've, you know, I read
[44:33] here 2 Timothy 3 cuz isn't it
[44:35] interesting when, you know, you think
[44:37] about how when the Apostle Paul, he was
[44:39] inspired to to, you know, God anointed
[44:42] him to forewarn us that perilous times
[44:44] were coming in the last days. And but
[44:47] isn't it amazing that he did not he did
[44:49] not um he did not list that there will
[44:51] be a great rise of atheism science would
[44:55] corrupt people's minds that it was not
[44:57] entertainment that would be the thing
[44:59] which would cause the peril it wasn't
[45:01] communism it wasn't fascism it wasn't I
[45:04] don't know whatever ism or spasm that's
[45:06] going on in the world he didn't list any
[45:08] of those things that none of those
[45:10] things make the world perilous he did
[45:12] not say that the economy was going to
[45:14] fall apart like it was He didn't list
[45:16] any of those things. But yet, we look at
[45:18] those things and we think that's the
[45:20] reason there's peril. But that ain't the
[45:22] reason at all. You see, no, it's not
[45:24] it's not those things that make it a
[45:26] perilous time. It's actually that people
[45:28] that men would be lovers of their own
[45:31] selves. Amen. That really this to me uh
[45:35] and and and I find this even interesting
[45:37] as well is that why did the apostle Paul
[45:39] lay this as the foundation or the
[45:42] beginning of this description of this
[45:43] people that we just read? He did not
[45:45] start with lovers of pleasure more than
[45:47] lovers of God or even hidey or
[45:49] high-minded or no he started with lovers
[45:51] of their own selves. And to me he's
[45:54] saying this is because this is the
[45:55] foundation at which all of these
[45:57] descriptions here of a people that uh
[46:00] that cause peril stem from that they
[46:03] love their own selves. And isn't this
[46:05] the opposite of a true Christian where
[46:07] because remember it says having a form
[46:09] of godliness. So these people here are
[46:11] are are believers. Amen. They they
[46:14] profess Christianity. They profess the
[46:16] cross. They profess that God, you know,
[46:18] is their savior. Jesus Christ is God.
[46:20] All those things. But yet there's
[46:21] something in them that is that is not
[46:23] actually manifesting this word. No,
[46:25] they're actually manifesting the spirit
[46:26] in the last days. Amen. Because we know
[46:29] that we live in a time where it is the
[46:30] time of self self, you know, exaltation.
[46:34] You know, even, you know, we know we
[46:35] live in the age of the selfie. And
[46:37] there's nothing wrong with taking
[46:38] selfies, but it's really the motive of
[46:40] why people do it. You know, people get
[46:42] addicted when they, you know, social
[46:44] media has this way of gra gripping
[46:46] people that where instead of, you know,
[46:48] out of just a happiness or a joy that
[46:50] they share their lives, they share their
[46:52] lives to see how many likes they get or
[46:55] how many comments they get or hearts or,
[46:57] you know, different emoji responses. It
[46:59] becomes an addiction to it's actually a
[47:01] self worship. It's a selfex uh
[47:04] exaltation, you know, lifting self up.
[47:06] And even there's been studies shown that
[47:08] different generations will take selfies
[47:10] at different angles.
[47:12] They've been stud people study these
[47:14] things. So older generations hold their
[47:16] phone higher up and you can see more of
[47:18] what's behind them. The younger
[47:19] generation is more like this and all you
[47:21] see is them, right? And it's and that
[47:24] spirit isn't just on and it's to me it's
[47:25] not actually just a younger generation
[47:27] change. It's just a spiritual shift
[47:29] because at first you know it starts
[47:31] where a selfie began with this is where
[47:33] I am. Amen. I'm sharing where I I am
[47:36] here, right? I'm actually you're putting
[47:38] personality into the photo cuz here I
[47:40] am. This is what I'm doing. But now it's
[47:42] look at me. There's a shift going on.
[47:44] Why? Because there's a time when people
[47:46] would become lovers of their own selves.
[47:50] And this does not exclude Christians.
[47:52] Amen. Because this actually the peril
[47:54] that we live in, the danger that we face
[47:56] is actually the reason why this time is
[47:58] so perilous is because people who claim
[48:01] to be Christians are lovers of their own
[48:03] selves instead of lovers of God. I'm
[48:05] sure I've got everyone's attention by
[48:07] now. Amen. Because this does not exempt
[48:09] us. And by no means Amen. No, we are we
[48:12] are people like anyone else's people,
[48:13] you know, but we got to realize that
[48:15] this is the this is the pressure of this
[48:18] age. This is this is what the world
[48:19] wants to conform us into is that we are
[48:22] selfabsorbed.
[48:24] And that's not even just people have a
[48:26] good life. People can have a hard life
[48:28] and become very self-absorbed. People
[48:30] who live under a pity party and poor me
[48:32] and it's not fair and all those things.
[48:34] It's actually their own pride lifting
[48:35] themselves up. Not and look how great I
[48:38] am, but look how hard I've had it and
[48:40] it's not fair and life is wrong. And
[48:42] their focus is upon themselves. Friends,
[48:44] our focus should never be upon
[48:46] ourselves. Amen. No. The focus of our
[48:48] lives should be upon the Lord Jesus.
[48:49] Amen. The one who purchased, redeemed us
[48:51] by his blood. It's not about us. But I'm
[48:54] sure you can see how this could deceive
[48:56] the very elect if it was possible.
[48:58] Because someone can act like a
[49:00] Christian. Someone can dress like a
[49:02] Christian. Someone can quote the quotes
[49:03] and quote the scriptures and have the
[49:05] right lingo as a believer, but yet they
[49:08] love themselves.
[49:10] Oh my.
[49:12] Amen. So this word lovers of their own
[49:14] selves is actually one Greek word and it
[49:16] means to be fond of self that is selfish
[49:19] lover of own self. So, as we go through
[49:22] this, I'm going to contrast I hope uh
[49:24] later on as we go, you know, there's
[49:26] there's a good self-love,
[49:28] right? And there's a bad selflove. This
[49:31] is a bad selflove cuz it's look how
[49:33] great I am. But you should actually love
[49:35] yourself in the fact that I'm a child of
[49:37] God. I've been redeemed by his blood. I
[49:40] have value. Amen. When the Lord Jesus
[49:42] died for me on Calvary, he put greater
[49:44] value on me than he did his own life.
[49:46] Otherwise, he would never have purchased
[49:47] our salvation. Right? So there should be
[49:49] good selflove. I'm here for a purpose.
[49:52] Amen. I'm here to be made in the image
[49:54] of God. I'm here that God can live
[49:55] through me to to the world. I'm not just
[49:57] a bunch of DNA walking around on two
[49:59] feet. No, I have value. I have purpose.
[50:01] That's good self loveve. And God can
[50:03] live through that. But you see, someone
[50:06] who loves themselves doesn't look how
[50:07] great I am. It's all about me. You know,
[50:10] isn't it interesting? We can really
[50:11] trace that back. We know where that came
[50:13] from, right? That came from Satan
[50:14] himself. Look how great I am. I'm made
[50:16] perfect. I'm so amazing. Amen. And it's
[50:18] an attribute of Satan that's come into
[50:20] the human race that is so deceptive.
[50:25] Amen. And even even this whole um thing
[50:27] here where it says having a form of
[50:30] godliness. Now the form is the
[50:31] formation. It's the it's the appearance.
[50:34] It's the outward shape, but it's not the
[50:36] inside piece, right? It's like this like
[50:38] you know there's concrete forms where uh
[50:42] where where builders will put wood
[50:44] around, right? Where the concrete's
[50:45] going to be poured. That's a form,
[50:47] right? But the form is not the concrete.
[50:49] The form is not the foundation. The form
[50:50] is got nothing to do with the building.
[50:52] If you just have that form there, you
[50:54] will not be able to build nothing. And
[50:56] see, and that's why it's Christianity
[50:57] can be just on the outside quoting the
[50:59] quotes, saying the right thing,
[51:02] conforming to a message culture, but
[51:04] that's just a form. That's not the
[51:06] believer, right? The believer is filled
[51:07] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. A powerhouse
[51:09] of God. God dwells in that person. Amen.
[51:12] Deity dwells in you. Amen. Where it's
[51:14] him living his life out of you. That's
[51:16] no longer a form. That's the reality. I
[51:18] don't want form, friends. I want the
[51:20] real deal. I mean, I'm not interested in
[51:22] just quoting quotes and having an
[51:23] appearance and a this is how we do
[51:25] church and this is how things should be.
[51:27] It's just a structure or a formation or
[51:29] even a formula
[51:32] correct doctrine. You know, oh, we've
[51:34] got the right formula. We've got the
[51:35] right formula for baptism in the name of
[51:37] Jesus Christ. Or we've got the right
[51:39] formula of how to approach God. We're
[51:41] going to go beyond that. You see, Balam
[51:43] had the right formula to approach God in
[51:45] the book of numbers. He knew the right
[51:47] sacrificial system. You know, if you con
[51:49] you, if you compare Moses sacrifices
[51:51] with with Balam sacrifices, both had the
[51:54] right same approach to God. Balam knew
[51:56] how to get in contact with God. But he
[51:58] was a lover of his own self. He loved
[52:01] money. He was merely being letting God,
[52:04] you know, he he would use that gift in
[52:06] his life to further his own ends. He was
[52:09] a lover of his own self. You see, and
[52:12] the big difference between Balam and
[52:13] Moses is Moses had the shout of the king
[52:16] in the camp. He had the pillar of fire.
[52:18] They had the brass serpent. Amen. They
[52:19] had the power of God. Amen. They walking
[52:21] according to prophecy. Maybe turn myself
[52:23] down a bit, brother Ed. I feel like I'm
[52:25] in a fishbowl or something. I don't mean
[52:26] to be shouting, but you know, um I don't
[52:28] want to deafen anyone, but you see, you
[52:30] know, he had but Balam just had an
[52:32] approach. Moses had the So, so Bam just
[52:36] had a form, but Moses had the form and
[52:38] the inside.
[52:40] Amen. He had the for both had the same
[52:42] formula. Who's with me today? Okay.
[52:46] Don't put up a shield. Let's just, you
[52:48] know, we're not made this way, right?
[52:50] God has made us, Amen. not to be a love
[52:52] of our own self, but to love the Lord
[52:54] with all our heart, soul, mind, and
[52:55] strength. Amen. But you see, so Balum
[52:57] had the form only. Moses had the whole
[53:00] package. Aren't you glad you can walk
[53:02] with the pillar of fire today? Amen. The
[53:03] revealed word that he's taken you from
[53:05] this world to the next world. Amen.
[53:07] Praise the Lord. So, so you know people
[53:09] can have an outward appearance. But you
[53:11] see what is the whole purpose of you
[53:13] know people who are lovers their own
[53:14] selves. The reason it's perilous is
[53:16] because that person or a person like
[53:19] this will bind the people to them not to
[53:22] the word. Amen. They will always try and
[53:24] usurp authority. They'll try and be
[53:26] greater than everyone else. And my when
[53:28] you come into a presence of a believer
[53:30] that's like that you feel like you're
[53:31] useless. You're hopeless. You're never
[53:33] going to get anywhere. You
[53:34] discouragement comes in. I'm sure we've
[53:37] all spoken to people like that who who
[53:38] profess to be believers but yet amen
[53:40] they make you doubt your you know you
[53:42] feel so unspiritual you feel so you know
[53:46] not not not firm in your walk you don't
[53:48] even know in whom you have believed
[53:49] anymore because you begin to doubt
[53:50] yourself why is that because someone
[53:52] with a form of godliness has come along
[53:54] who's a lover of their own selves and
[53:56] what to do they project a superiority
[53:59] that you are nothing and they are
[54:00] everything
[54:02] this is this is where the deception can
[54:03] come in this is why it's perilous
[54:05] Amen. Because they can look the same.
[54:07] You can take two believers, you know,
[54:09] they can dress the same, act the same,
[54:11] speak the same, go to the same church.
[54:12] Even brother says that, you know,
[54:14] speaking of when Cain Cain would worship
[54:17] by knowledge and and Abel would worship
[54:19] by revelation, he'd say those t same
[54:21] spirits are in the tabernacle this
[54:22] morning. People worshiping by knowledge
[54:24] and people worshiping by revelation.
[54:26] Those who just worship by human
[54:27] knowledge, they become a lover of their
[54:29] own selves because it's carnality. Those
[54:31] who worship by revelation, you can't be
[54:33] a love of your own self when God reveals
[54:35] himself to you. It's impossible. Amen.
[54:38] Why? Because revelation has an
[54:39] outworking. Amen. Amen. Of a humble,
[54:42] yielded, surrendered life. Now,
[54:45] Amen. You see now so so what happens is
[54:48] those who if I can just find myself here
[54:50] is that
[54:54] perilous times don't appear to be
[54:56] perilous or you know when this comes in
[54:58] you you know we can take Abselon here
[55:02] Abselon was was after he murdered his
[55:05] older half brother he was next in line
[55:07] for the throne so he was handsome he was
[55:11] tall he was the whole package and the
[55:13] thing is he became he was a lover of his
[55:15] own self. Now this man would this man no
[55:19] one really knew what was in his heart
[55:21] until it came out in the open. And sadly
[55:24] when you know those ones who are lovers
[55:26] of their own selves they will have an
[55:27] agenda. And that agenda is always to
[55:30] exalt themselves above the rest. Those
[55:32] those who are lovers their own selves I
[55:34] mean feel entitled.
[55:36] And you could say well a true believer
[55:38] feels entitled to two two but it's two
[55:40] different entitlements. One, one is is
[55:43] those because Abselon felt entitled
[55:45] based on his birth, based on what he
[55:47] looked like, based on his mind and his
[55:49] plans that he was entitled to be the
[55:51] next king. He felt and you know people
[55:53] get entitled, they feel no, you know,
[55:55] I'm entitled to certain rights. You take
[55:58] someone who's not really a minister but
[56:00] tries to be a minister, they feel
[56:01] entitled that they're above the people
[56:04] that that that manual work going, you
[56:05] know, doing doing setting up, packing
[56:08] up, doing all those things, it's beneath
[56:10] them.
[56:11] Why? Because they're a lover of their
[56:12] own selves. Pride has lifted them up.
[56:14] That that you know the common ley work
[56:16] is is beneath them. But friends, we're
[56:18] all the same.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. There ain't there ain't no big
[56:22] eyes and little use in the kingdom of
[56:23] God. It's all us the same people, right?
[56:26] But you see someone doesn't, you know,
[56:28] someone who's it feels entitled, they
[56:29] feel no, I shouldn't have to I shouldn't
[56:31] have to just do manual mind-numbing work
[56:34] and grind through for the kingdom. No, I
[56:36] have my own position and I'm better than
[56:38] those things. What is that? because they
[56:40] have lifted their head. They have an
[56:41] inflated self opinion of themselves
[56:43] thinking that they're better than the
[56:45] common believer. We're all common
[56:46] believers here.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Abselon felt entitled to to to
[56:52] take the throne. Now, now how did he do
[56:54] this? You see, he started off see his
[56:56] agenda was he's going to take his father
[56:59] to this throne and he's going to use
[57:01] he's going to use charisma to do it. Oh
[57:04] my. Amen. And it came to I had such a
[57:08] good time with these things that Lord
[57:10] help us all. Amen. It came to pass after
[57:12] this that Abselon prepared him chariots
[57:14] and horses and 50 men to run before him.
[57:16] Now before this in the story, he's
[57:18] killed his brother. He's finally been
[57:20] reconciled to his father. He's back in
[57:22] Jerusalem. His exile's over. But you
[57:24] see, this is all his cunning plan
[57:26] because he had he loved himself more
[57:28] than the word. Because those that truly
[57:30] love the word, they will let God place
[57:32] him in the body in his time. I mean,
[57:34] they're not trying to push themselves
[57:35] forward. No, not at all. Amen. No, they
[57:38] want God to place them in a season.
[57:40] Sometimes that season may be in many
[57:41] years. It may be very soon, but God's
[57:44] people who do not love themselves but
[57:45] love the Lord, let God place them in
[57:47] places. Amen. But those that love
[57:49] themselves want to place themselves in
[57:51] those places. And we can see this in
[57:53] Abselon, how a contrast he was to his
[57:56] father. Amen. David had a uh he was a
[58:00] man after God's own heart.
[58:03] He wasn't a lover of his own self. Amen.
[58:05] He was on the run from Saul for many
[58:06] years. He had two chances. He could have
[58:09] killed Saul, taken the throne. But what?
[58:11] He did not lift himself up. Amen. He let
[58:14] God place them in his season. And those
[58:17] who are lovers of their own selves do
[58:19] not respect gifts of God. Amen. Unless
[58:22] it's their own, right? Because David had
[58:25] respect of Saul saying, "I will not
[58:27] touch the Lord's anointed." Amen. God
[58:29] will move him out when it's God's
[58:32] season. See, but you see, Abselon was
[58:34] not like his father at all. No, he was
[58:36] so lifted up in his pride of what he
[58:37] thought him thought he himself was, he
[58:40] begin to scheme. I'm going to get rid of
[58:43] my father. I'm going to become king. I
[58:44] And and what does he do? He uses
[58:46] charisma to sway the people. Imagine,
[58:49] you know, I couldn't find a good picture
[58:51] of it because, you know, but I would
[58:52] have loved to have found it here with,
[58:54] you know, I've just got Abselon here
[58:55] talking to this guy and we'll come to
[58:56] that soon. But imagine you're you're
[58:58] you're going through the streets of
[59:00] Jerusalem and then you hear this big
[59:02] fanfare. You hear the thundering of of
[59:03] of of horses hooves on the on the
[59:06] pavement. You hear chariot wheels and
[59:08] you see 50 men run before proclaiming
[59:10] here comes Solomon. I mean sorry here
[59:12] comes Abselon. Solomon was coming later.
[59:14] But you see here comes Abselon. So what
[59:16] is he doing? He's he's using this to to
[59:20] project himself as a great person. And
[59:22] how people want to use their own
[59:24] charisma to project. See, instead of
[59:26] pointing people to God, they'll point
[59:28] people to themselves. Amen. Because
[59:30] those who love their own selves want
[59:32] everyone to love them. Those who don't
[59:34] love the but those who love themselves
[59:35] the right way want everyone to love the
[59:37] Lord.
[59:39] Amen. But then what happens is people
[59:41] will use will use um will use the word
[59:44] for their own ends to make people be
[59:46] bound to them. So here's Abselon and you
[59:49] know he's there. He had raised up early.
[59:51] So what's he doing? He's trying to
[59:52] become noticed in what he's doing. He's
[59:55] trying to make it very public. If he had
[59:57] a, you know, if he had social media in
[59:58] that day, he'd be live streaming. I'm at
[1:00:00] the gate again. Another good day talking
[1:00:03] to the people and have selfies with
[1:00:04] people and he'd have his, you know,
[1:00:06] social media program going out
[1:00:08] projecting pointing people to him. Oh
[1:00:11] my. But you see here he is now. And then
[1:00:13] so and then so what he does is he uses
[1:00:16] and then what does he do? He tries to
[1:00:17] get between the people and the king. You
[1:00:20] see, the reason they would come to, if I
[1:00:22] have it there, I do have it there. The
[1:00:23] reason they came to Jerusalem is if
[1:00:25] there's any controversy, they would go
[1:00:27] to the king because the king was the
[1:00:29] final authority in Israel. He's more
[1:00:31] than just a king. He was the supreme
[1:00:33] judge there in Israel. So, people would
[1:00:35] come, there was a fuss, there was a
[1:00:36] fight and maybe the, you know, local
[1:00:38] magistrates or whatever couldn't
[1:00:40] couldn't resolve it. So, they went, they
[1:00:41] would appeal. It was like their high
[1:00:43] court or their privy council or whatever
[1:00:45] we have these days, Supreme Court was
[1:00:47] the king. And then so there they would
[1:00:49] go and then and then Absilon would you
[1:00:51] know people were walking this path he
[1:00:53] was and he would get himself between
[1:00:55] God's given counselor
[1:00:58] and the people
[1:01:00] and isn't it interesting people who love
[1:01:02] their own selves will always not speak
[1:01:04] to the people in in in positions they'll
[1:01:06] always go among the people and be very
[1:01:09] much in contact with everyone but their
[1:01:11] motive is to actually belittle those who
[1:01:14] are actually in place in God's offices
[1:01:17] and draw people to themselves.
[1:01:21] Amen. This is perilous, man.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; This is perilous. Why? Because the
[1:01:25] motive is I'm gonna swing all these
[1:01:26] people under my leadership instead of
[1:01:28] under the leadership of the word.
[1:01:29] Because you can all agree what Abselum
[1:01:31] was doing was contrary to scripture. I
[1:01:33] mean, if we could take this into today's
[1:01:35] setting, it would be someone who's
[1:01:36] trying to swing the church from the
[1:01:38] pastor under their own leadership, make
[1:01:40] a split, make their own group, and do
[1:01:41] their own thing. Not God inspired, not
[1:01:43] god led, but it's someone who loves
[1:01:45] their own self. wants to be lifted up
[1:01:47] and have their name great among the
[1:01:49] world. There's only one name that we
[1:01:51] should lift up. That is the name of
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ. Amen. This revealed word.
[1:01:55] That's the only name we should exalt.
[1:01:57] Amen. God ain't interested in lifting up
[1:01:59] people's names. That is the one name we
[1:02:01] should lift up. Amen. So here the people
[1:02:05] come along. They've got this problem and
[1:02:07] you know you know you they want to come
[1:02:08] see the king. But then what does Abselon
[1:02:10] say? You know he would he would exalt
[1:02:12] them, ask who they are, show interest in
[1:02:14] their lives. But his interest in their
[1:02:16] lives was only for his own ends. And
[1:02:18] isn't it amazing? You can you can know
[1:02:20] believers and as long as your friendship
[1:02:23] with them benefits them, they're your
[1:02:24] friend, right? But as soon as it begins
[1:02:27] to come the other way, you know, and and
[1:02:29] and and when when your friendship
[1:02:31] doesn't benefit them anymore, they just
[1:02:32] drop you. I'm sure we've all experienced
[1:02:35] these things. What is that? That person
[1:02:36] is a lover of their own selves. They're
[1:02:38] not really interested in you. They're
[1:02:40] interested in furthering themselves.
[1:02:43] And so here was Absilon pretending to to
[1:02:45] show interest in people's needs and
[1:02:47] cares, but his motive was selfish. He
[1:02:49] wasn't interested at all in what the
[1:02:52] people were going through. Actually, he
[1:02:53] was only interested in winning their
[1:02:54] hearts that he would become king one
[1:02:56] day. And then he would say in verse
[1:02:58] three says, "See, thy matters are good
[1:03:00] and right, but there is no man deputed
[1:03:02] of the king to hear thee." So you're
[1:03:04] saying, "Man, it's such a shame. You've
[1:03:06] got such a good case. I I I I feel what
[1:03:08] you're going through. I can relate with
[1:03:10] what you're going through. But there's
[1:03:11] no the king has not made a way for your
[1:03:13] case to be heard. The king was there.
[1:03:17] There was a way made. But yet Abselon
[1:03:20] twisted the word to say actually no one
[1:03:22] can hear you. Your voice will not be
[1:03:24] heard. Your your worry, your concern
[1:03:27] does not matter. That's what he's
[1:03:28] basically saying. He says, "If only I
[1:03:30] was a judge in the land that everyone
[1:03:32] would, you know, you know, if only, you
[1:03:34] know, if I was a judge, then everyone
[1:03:36] man u which hath any suit or case might
[1:03:38] come unto me that I would do them
[1:03:41] justice." So what is he doing? He's
[1:03:43] swinging the people
[1:03:45] to himself. Why? Because he was a lover
[1:03:48] of his own self.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; My
[1:03:53] Isn't it a shame that the pastor is too
[1:03:54] busy that no one can seem to help you at
[1:03:56] this time?
[1:03:59] There's things in place. But this is a
[1:04:02] person whose agenda is selfish. They
[1:04:03] want to lift themselves up. Abselon was
[1:04:06] interested in building his own kingdom.
[1:04:08] He was more interested in that than
[1:04:10] building the kingdom of God. And this is
[1:04:12] someone who's a love of their own
[1:04:13] selves. They will build their own
[1:04:15] kingdom. They will actually what their
[1:04:17] hobbies, what their what their thing
[1:04:18] that they enjoy most in life, they'll
[1:04:20] build their life around it. They'll
[1:04:21] isolate their family from church. They
[1:04:23] won't they won't change their lifestyle
[1:04:26] to further the spiritual growth of their
[1:04:28] family or themselves. They want to build
[1:04:30] their own little kingdom.
[1:04:32] Amen. It's a sad thing. But a person
[1:04:33] who's a lover, oh, but they, you know,
[1:04:35] people want to build a comfort zone that
[1:04:37] is such a rigid thing that they say, I
[1:04:40] am safe in this little place. They
[1:04:42] actually just love themselves and love
[1:04:44] what they do in that comfort zone. God
[1:04:45] doesn't want us to have a comfort zone.
[1:04:47] God wants us to go beyond our comfort
[1:04:49] zone. Amen. He wants us to walk out into
[1:04:52] the unknown with him. Amen. See, see,
[1:04:54] but people will build their own little
[1:04:55] world. They'll, you know, people will
[1:04:57] build churches, will build
[1:04:58] denominations. It's their own kingdom
[1:05:00] upon the earth. Oh, yeah. We know
[1:05:02] brother was the prophet of the age, but
[1:05:04] now I'm here to tell you what he meant.
[1:05:08] What's that person? Now, this is what
[1:05:10] people say. That's not what I'm saying.
[1:05:12] Okay? But people say that. Why? Because
[1:05:15] they're a love of their own selves. They
[1:05:17] want to lift themselves up above the
[1:05:19] message, above the word of God. Oh,
[1:05:22] don't listen to that group of churches.
[1:05:23] They don't have a right. This is how
[1:05:25] things should be. What are they doing?
[1:05:26] They're actually tying people to
[1:05:27] themselves instead of to the word.
[1:05:30] Amen. This is what happened. People are
[1:05:32] lovers of their ownelves. They want to
[1:05:33] be number one. They don't want God to be
[1:05:35] number one. They want him. They want
[1:05:37] themselves to be number one. They want
[1:05:39] to be the final authority on everything.
[1:05:43] Friends, we have one authority.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. which is the word.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is our final authority. It's
[1:05:49] not it's not my opinion don't matter.
[1:05:51] His word counts. Amen. And but someone
[1:05:54] who loves their own selves thinks well
[1:05:55] no no I have I have the wisdom. I have
[1:05:58] the ability. I have it all. SW together.
[1:06:00] And they will project that to the people
[1:06:02] that you have to listen to this. I trust
[1:06:04] we're all following together this
[1:06:05] morning. Amen. Now and so what did
[1:06:08] Abselon do? He swayed the hearts of the
[1:06:10] people. And then I think I've broken the
[1:06:13] projector. No. And then what happened?
[1:06:16] He started a civil war all by good in
[1:06:20] what appeared to be good intentions. But
[1:06:22] his motive was selfish.
[1:06:25] You know what God will do?
[1:06:28] If someone tries to build a kingdom, God
[1:06:31] will bust that kingdom up. If God's
[1:06:32] children are in that kingdom, he'll bust
[1:06:35] it up to get them out to make them so
[1:06:37] that they can walk with him. If there's
[1:06:39] anything that shields or gets in the
[1:06:41] way, God's going to take that person out
[1:06:42] of the way. Amen. Uzziah, Isaiah. Now,
[1:06:46] this is just totally off my notes
[1:06:47] because, you know, but you see, Uzziah
[1:06:49] was so caught up. He wanted to be a
[1:06:51] priest and, you know, went beyond his
[1:06:53] office of king and and and he died with
[1:06:55] leprosy. And Isaiah was a young man, but
[1:06:58] he was leaning too much on the influence
[1:07:00] of of the king. And what happened? God
[1:07:03] had to take the king out of the way.
[1:07:05] That you that Isaiah could come into the
[1:07:07] temple, cry unto the Lord. They'd have
[1:07:08] that heavenly vision. Amen. because God
[1:07:11] wanted to reveal himself in a greater
[1:07:12] way to the prophet. Amen. And it's the
[1:07:15] same thing with you and I, friends. If
[1:07:16] there's anything that hinders our walk,
[1:07:18] God's going to move it.
[1:07:21] Amen. He's going to make it
[1:07:22] uncomfortable. He's going to stir up the
[1:07:24] nest. Amen. Because he does not want you
[1:07:26] to stop. He doesn't want you to get you
[1:07:28] comfortable. He doesn't want you to make
[1:07:30] your own little kingdom and live in it.
[1:07:31] No, he wants you to walk with him. Amen.
[1:07:34] There is experiences, there's word,
[1:07:35] there's revelation that we have not even
[1:07:37] touched yet. Amen. And you say, "Well,
[1:07:39] I've been with the Lord for a long time.
[1:07:41] There's still more of him to be revealed
[1:07:42] to us." Amen.
[1:07:46] Praise the Lord. Now, he says this. So,
[1:07:48] so that's very perilous. Now,
[1:07:51] we can just read this here. He says,
[1:07:53] "Jesus would ask a question after after
[1:07:56] the uh speaks of the parable of the
[1:07:58] unjust judge and the widow woman." And
[1:08:00] he says, "I tell you that he will avenge
[1:08:02] them speedily," speaking of the elect.
[1:08:04] Nevertheless, when the Son of Man
[1:08:06] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[1:08:09] earth. Now, this faith he's speaking
[1:08:11] about is not just a belief in God, but
[1:08:13] it's actually a faith in the entire
[1:08:14] revelation of the word. Will he find
[1:08:16] this when he comes? I say, "Yes, he
[1:08:17] will." Amen. Why? Because he's deposited
[1:08:19] in you and I through the message of the
[1:08:21] hour. Amen. So, he will find that faith
[1:08:23] that he's looking for. And and then then
[1:08:25] he spake of this parable unto certain
[1:08:27] which trusted in themselves that they
[1:08:29] were righteous and despised others. This
[1:08:31] is a perilous time. Amen. Two men went
[1:08:34] up into the temple to pray, one a
[1:08:36] Pharisee and the other a publican. The
[1:08:38] Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[1:08:40] himself. God, I thank thee um that I am
[1:08:44] not as other men are, extortioners,
[1:08:46] unjust, adulterers, or even as this
[1:08:48] publican. I fast twice in the week. I
[1:08:51] give tithes of all that I possess. And
[1:08:53] the publican standing a far off would
[1:08:55] not so lift up as much as eyes unto
[1:08:57] heaven, but smoke his breast, saying,
[1:08:59] God, be merciful to me a sinner. I tell
[1:09:01] you this man which uh went down to his
[1:09:04] house justified rather than the other.
[1:09:06] For everyone that exaltth himself shall
[1:09:08] be abased and he that humbleth himself
[1:09:10] shall be exalted. Now this is very
[1:09:13] perilous
[1:09:16] because here is here is two images put
[1:09:18] before us in a church. Okay, we do not
[1:09:22] tell by this picture really what's going
[1:09:24] on in both their hearts because you can
[1:09:27] see the Pharisees got his hands raised
[1:09:28] up and he prays with himself. There's
[1:09:31] not even a great outward manifestation
[1:09:33] of his prayer. But, you know, you could
[1:09:35] say, well, one's just in victory, the
[1:09:37] other one's not in victory. The other
[1:09:39] one's broken. And and one was broken and
[1:09:41] one was not. See, the publican was
[1:09:43] crying out for for mercy, right? But you
[1:09:46] see, if we look at that scene, we'd
[1:09:48] think, well, they're both real
[1:09:50] believers. They're both, you know, just
[1:09:51] worshiping God in their own way, and
[1:09:53] one's had a breakthrough. The other
[1:09:55] one's just happy that, you know, you
[1:09:56] know, victorious. But really, only one
[1:09:58] was victorious. But you see what happens
[1:10:00] is is is when this comes into a church
[1:10:03] and you see someone who's like the
[1:10:04] Pharisee and you know they think that
[1:10:06] like within their heart they're just
[1:10:07] thinking I'm so great. This man was a
[1:10:10] lover of know of his own self. Right?
[1:10:12] This is where the peril comes in because
[1:10:14] because the publican could look at this
[1:10:16] man and he could say how on earth can I
[1:10:19] become like him? And it's a false image
[1:10:22] of a believer put before the people. And
[1:10:24] then so this publican looks at this
[1:10:26] Pharisee thinks he's so great, he's so
[1:10:28] wonderful. He's such an amazing
[1:10:29] believer. And but the thing is, if the
[1:10:32] publican could see what's in the
[1:10:34] Pharisees heart, he'd be running a mile.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; He'd be because he doesn't want what the
[1:10:40] what the Pharisee has really if he knew
[1:10:42] what it was. You see, but because it
[1:10:44] looks outwardly he had a form of
[1:10:45] godliness. Amen. But inwardly, what? He
[1:10:48] was full of pride. He was building. He
[1:10:52] was a lover of his own self.
[1:10:55] See the Pharisee loved what he did and
[1:10:57] how it made him look. And people will
[1:11:00] become believers
[1:11:02] because they love themselves and they
[1:11:04] want to have some special niche within
[1:11:07] society of being elite, being a called
[1:11:09] out of the called out, being a special
[1:11:11] group of people. And we are a special
[1:11:13] group of people. We've been saved by the
[1:11:15] grace of God. I mean, we're the apple of
[1:11:17] his eye. We're his redeemed ones. We're
[1:11:18] his we're we're his people. So, we are a
[1:11:21] special class of people, right? But that
[1:11:24] doesn't make us think that we're better
[1:11:25] than anyone. No, sir. No. No. Because
[1:11:27] the same blood that that Jesus shed for
[1:11:29] me is the same blood he shed for
[1:11:30] everyone on the street. Amen. And the
[1:11:32] only reason I'm here is cuz God called
[1:11:34] me. He found me. He pursued me. He went
[1:11:36] after me. He grabbed me. Amen. And then
[1:11:38] I had to make a choice and say, "Lord,
[1:11:40] I'm going to serve you." Amen. And thank
[1:11:42] God I did that. But you see, what's the
[1:11:43] difference between me and someone on the
[1:11:45] street? Actually, just God finding me.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; What's the difference between you and
[1:11:49] someone on the street? God found you.
[1:11:50] God called you. You say, "Well, I was
[1:11:52] raised in the message. I was raised in a
[1:11:53] Christian home. All those things are
[1:11:55] good. But there must come a time when
[1:11:57] God gets a hold of you. He begins to
[1:11:59] deal with your life." Amen. That you
[1:12:00] just say, "Lord, I need you. I need
[1:12:02] salvation." Amen. And you give your
[1:12:04] life. There must come that season,
[1:12:06] friends. And so now, but you see this,
[1:12:08] but people will join the message because
[1:12:10] of selfish motives. I always believe the
[1:12:14] Catholic Church is what the Bible says
[1:12:15] it was. or men, you know, you you take
[1:12:18] warped ideas of men being doineering
[1:12:20] over their homes and all these things
[1:12:22] and it's things they already believe,
[1:12:23] but now they've got a vehicle to really
[1:12:26] make it go.
[1:12:28] Amen. And so what they they love the
[1:12:30] idea of being a believer and then they
[1:12:32] love what people think of them instead
[1:12:35] of what God thinks of us. Are we all
[1:12:37] together this morning? I mean this what
[1:12:39] you people come different motives.
[1:12:41] People have many different motives being
[1:12:42] in the message. Some are selfish, some
[1:12:45] are selfless.
[1:12:47] Amen. The selfish is like the Pharisee.
[1:12:49] Look how great I am. Look at my family.
[1:12:50] You know, they get embarrassed when
[1:12:52] their children act like children because
[1:12:53] it makes them look bad.
[1:12:56] It's all about self-image. See, someone
[1:12:58] who's got a bad kind of selflove is all
[1:13:00] about image. It's all about look how
[1:13:02] holy I am. Look at look at my life. It's
[1:13:04] impeccable and all these things. But
[1:13:06] inwardly, it's all about pride. It's all
[1:13:09] about me. It's a selfie. It's a selfie
[1:13:11] mentality. Amen. But those who are just
[1:13:14] walking by the grace of God, they know
[1:13:16] they don't deserve nothing, but yet God
[1:13:18] has given them all things. And they're
[1:13:19] just happy they're saved. And you know,
[1:13:21] they're not they're not like the
[1:13:22] Pharisee at all. No, they're like the
[1:13:24] publican. Lord, be merciful to me. I
[1:13:26] want more of your mercy, Lord. I want
[1:13:28] more of your grace to come and influence
[1:13:29] my life. I want you to come and live me
[1:13:31] in a greater way, Lord. Lord, what can I
[1:13:33] do that you'd be glorified upon the
[1:13:35] earth? Amen. But the people are like the
[1:13:37] Pharisee. They're like, "Lord, I want to
[1:13:39] be glorified. I want to be lifted up."
[1:13:43] Amen. People people like the idea of,
[1:13:46] you know, a public part in the body of
[1:13:48] Christ. You know, brothers get the idea
[1:13:50] of being a minister, a deacon or a song
[1:13:52] leader because, you know, they like the
[1:13:54] idea of it because of the status. Oh,
[1:13:56] brother so and so. Oh, he can really my
[1:13:59] fireball and he's really he can really
[1:14:01] he's deep or whatever and, you know,
[1:14:02] he's really spiritual and all these
[1:14:04] things. They like the status of it.
[1:14:07] That's a person who's a love of their
[1:14:08] own. I tell you what, friend. Someone
[1:14:09] who's really called of God runs. Amen.
[1:14:12] And some can run for a long time, but
[1:14:14] they'll run from it. They're not wanting
[1:14:15] to be here. They're not they they don't
[1:14:17] want, you know, they don't want to be
[1:14:19] any kind of public thing. They're not
[1:14:21] interested in it. They want to but but
[1:14:23] God will deal with that life and they'll
[1:14:25] have to come to a place where they fully
[1:14:26] surrender and say, "Lord, not my will
[1:14:28] but thy will be done."
[1:14:31] Amen.
[1:14:34] Now,
[1:14:36] see this Pharisee lifted up his hand
[1:14:38] saying, "Lord, I'm I'm glad I'm not like
[1:14:40] other people. I'm so deep, Lord. I know
[1:14:42] the seven everythings. I know I know all
[1:14:44] the mysteries of God. Lord, look at how
[1:14:46] fast I've matured. And my brother here
[1:14:48] is, you know, he, you know, he's getting
[1:14:50] nowhere. He seems to be going through a
[1:14:51] cycle and doesn't seem to be breaking
[1:14:53] free. But which heart was really the one
[1:14:55] that was free? The publican's heart was
[1:14:57] freer than the Pharisees heart. Amen.
[1:15:01] Praise the Lord. I'm so my See, a person
[1:15:04] who's a love of their own selves would
[1:15:05] always compare themselves with others.
[1:15:07] Well, my family's better than Oh, I'm so
[1:15:09] glad my children aren't like those
[1:15:11] children. And I'm so glad that my job is
[1:15:13] better than this person's job, and my
[1:15:15] car is better than this car, and my
[1:15:17] church is better than that church, and
[1:15:18] all these things. That's a love of their
[1:15:19] own selves cuz they want to look better.
[1:15:25] And what does he do? He projects a
[1:15:27] religious superiority that everyone
[1:15:30] around them are actually treated like
[1:15:31] servants. Who's the main one in the
[1:15:34] temple here?
[1:15:35] The Pharisee thinks it's him. Lord, I'm
[1:15:38] the epito epitome of Christianity. Look
[1:15:40] how great I am. Look at how revelated I
[1:15:42] am, Lord. It's what it's all about. A
[1:15:44] lover of of his own self. Amen. But you
[1:15:47] see the publican with his head bowed,
[1:15:49] sminging his breath, breast, crying unto
[1:15:51] the Lord. What is he? He's not drawing
[1:15:53] attention to himself. He's drawing
[1:15:55] attention to the one he's trying he's
[1:15:56] asking mercy from.
[1:15:59] Praise the Lord. But you see this is
[1:16:02] very perilous because you know people
[1:16:05] can people who project that they they
[1:16:08] are the epitome of Christianity of what
[1:16:10] a believer should be and how great they
[1:16:12] are. It causes those around them who are
[1:16:14] sincere in heart yet maybe struggling to
[1:16:18] become discouraged because they think I
[1:16:20] cannot be like this guy.
[1:16:24] This is why it's a very perilous thing
[1:16:28] to compare. They compare their walk uh
[1:16:31] with Christ to others and feel superior.
[1:16:34] Amen. They they will violate boundaries
[1:16:36] of of friendship, of families, and
[1:16:39] they'll try and impose their views on
[1:16:41] others. And woe unto you if you don't
[1:16:43] listen to what they have to say. Why?
[1:16:45] What is it? That's a superior love of
[1:16:48] self that basically my thoughts are the
[1:16:50] absolute. There's only one absolute
[1:16:52] thought in this day. This is the message
[1:16:53] of the hour, right?
[1:16:56] Amen.
[1:16:58] They'll expect others to admire them to
[1:17:00] agree with them and to support them
[1:17:02] unquestionably.
[1:17:03] And and and if anyone does question
[1:17:06] them, maybe maybe challenges them a
[1:17:07] little bit, then that person will
[1:17:09] despiritualize the person doing the
[1:17:11] questioning.
[1:17:14] It is pride disguised as confidence.
[1:17:17] They boast about their gifts,
[1:17:18] ministries, or good works instead of
[1:17:19] pointing people to the word.
[1:17:22] I know we've gone quiet, but I just want
[1:17:24] you to think about this. This is of
[1:17:25] someone who loves their own self.
[1:17:31] But you see,
[1:17:34] but the Lord Jesus never said to be
[1:17:36] lovers of your own self. This is where
[1:17:37] I'm going to try and make a switch in
[1:17:38] the sermon now. He said Jesus would be
[1:17:41] asked, "What is the great commandment in
[1:17:42] the Lord?" Jesus said unto him, "Thou
[1:17:44] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:17:46] heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
[1:17:48] mind." This is the first and great
[1:17:49] commandment. The second is like unto it.
[1:17:51] "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:17:53] thyself." On these two commandments hang
[1:17:56] all the law and the prophets. Amen. So
[1:18:00] Jesus said to if see Jesus said there's
[1:18:03] actually a right kind of selflove and
[1:18:06] that's to love thy neighbor as thyself.
[1:18:08] Amen. To do unto others as you'd have
[1:18:10] done unto you. Amen. So it's it's so
[1:18:13] it's not a it's not a lover of your own
[1:18:15] self. It's actually if you want to you
[1:18:17] know you you want to love the Lord with
[1:18:18] all that you are and love your neighbor
[1:18:20] as yourself. You see, someone who's not
[1:18:22] full of self-love is wanting others to
[1:18:26] do better without any recognition,
[1:18:28] without any it was them, without any
[1:18:30] accolades. They just want to live for
[1:18:32] others. They want to see God live in
[1:18:34] someone else. They want to see someone
[1:18:36] get along further with the Lord and not
[1:18:38] try and take any credit for themselves.
[1:18:41] Not say, "Look, I did all this. This is
[1:18:43] my work." No, it's the Lord's work.
[1:18:45] Amen. It is God that gives the increase.
[1:18:48] You know, we may water or plant or
[1:18:50] whatever, but it's the Lord that gives
[1:18:51] the increase. It's not it's not a man
[1:18:54] none. Okay, I'll just speak personally.
[1:18:57] I will never get anyone in the rapture
[1:18:59] humanly,
[1:19:00] right? It takes the word to step in and
[1:19:03] do it.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not it's not human ability,
[1:19:07] you know, but you see, someone who loves
[1:19:09] himself has such a such a wrong opinion
[1:19:11] of their own ability, they think, man, I
[1:19:13] have to do this in my own strength. And
[1:19:15] they will try and push their push their
[1:19:17] family into a mold. Try and make them to
[1:19:20] become a certain way. And when they grow
[1:19:22] up, those children have got to stay in
[1:19:24] that mold because they're building their
[1:19:26] own kingdom. They will they'll try and
[1:19:27] keep their children around them to the
[1:19:29] extreme. They won't let them grow. They
[1:19:31] won't let them become their own family.
[1:19:33] No, because they're a love of their own
[1:19:35] selves. They have it their opinion. My
[1:19:37] family's going to stay by me. And if
[1:19:38] they don't, they won't amount to
[1:19:39] nothing.
[1:19:41] Friends, my heart's desire for all of us
[1:19:44] is that we'll have an individual walk
[1:19:45] with the Lord. Amen. That if this church
[1:19:48] ceases to be, we will still be in the
[1:19:50] faith. Amen. That that we will that
[1:19:53] we'll walk with him. We'll know him in
[1:19:54] the power of his resurrection. Amen. Are
[1:19:57] we all together this morning? Amen. That
[1:19:59] we'll have an individual relationship
[1:20:00] with our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[1:20:03] what we will do, we'll pass it on to our
[1:20:04] children that they will not know him
[1:20:06] through us. No way. They will know him
[1:20:09] themselves. Amen. That we're not the
[1:20:11] intermediary between us and us and them.
[1:20:13] You know, God and them, but no, it's
[1:20:15] them and God alone. Amen. It's always
[1:20:18] got to be this way. But someone who
[1:20:19] loves themselves wants to be the
[1:20:21] go-between. They want to be the one that
[1:20:23] is the one who gives thus sayith the
[1:20:25] Lord to someone. And they actually push
[1:20:27] people down there. Actually, if you want
[1:20:28] to hear from God, you got to hear
[1:20:29] through me.
[1:20:31] That's a sad state of affairs. God never
[1:20:34] intended people to work through someone
[1:20:37] else to speak to someone all the time.
[1:20:39] Sure. Sure. God uses ministry. God maybe
[1:20:42] put something on your heart for someone
[1:20:43] else and God will work through the body.
[1:20:45] But when it comes to your walk with God,
[1:20:47] it must be you and God.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's you and the word walking
[1:20:51] together. Amen. It's not it's not me,
[1:20:53] you and God walking together, though
[1:20:54] I've got my place. But yet, it's you and
[1:20:56] God that if I cease to be, you won't
[1:20:59] fall apart as a believer. Oh no, you
[1:21:01] will be strong. You'll walk on. Sure,
[1:21:03] you know, you'll be wondering, why did
[1:21:05] that happen? All those look, I'm not
[1:21:06] planning on going anywhere, but you you
[1:21:07] got to understand that. But you got to
[1:21:09] realize if I was vaporized this very
[1:21:11] second, my heart's desire would be Lord,
[1:21:13] may everyone here keep walking. Keep
[1:21:16] knowing him, Lord. Keep walking with
[1:21:18] them, Lord Jesus. May they not be so
[1:21:20] dependent on a human to be a Christian,
[1:21:22] but may they be so dependent on you,
[1:21:24] Lord, that they would that that that all
[1:21:26] they care about is Lord, I'm walking
[1:21:27] with you. It's me and you, Lord,
[1:21:29] together in this. Amen.
[1:21:33] Amen. You see, so those so we're
[1:21:37] commanded to love our neighbor as
[1:21:38] ourselves. You know, isn't it? Wait,
[1:21:40] let's just let's just drop here first.
[1:21:42] Well, I'm just going to read this quote
[1:21:43] here from that day on Calvary. See, now
[1:21:44] the first thing I want to say is this.
[1:21:46] Jesus never lived for himself. His life
[1:21:48] was spent for others. That's perfectly
[1:21:50] eternal life. When you say you go to
[1:21:52] church, you do good things. That's fine.
[1:21:54] But when you live your life for
[1:21:55] yourself, you have an eternal life. So
[1:21:58] remember those who are lovers of their
[1:21:59] own selves live for themselves. Amen.
[1:22:02] But those who live for others, they have
[1:22:04] eternal life. Eternal life is living for
[1:22:07] others. You know why this world is so
[1:22:09] unhappy? Cuz people are so
[1:22:11] self-absorbed.
[1:22:13] My life, my career, my family, my free
[1:22:16] time, my hobbies, my image, my mind, my
[1:22:20] my my. It's all this me and people.
[1:22:23] Because we're not built to be just
[1:22:25] inwardlooking ourselves. We're built for
[1:22:28] each other.
[1:22:30] Amen.
[1:22:31] Man, it's like God created us and what
[1:22:33] did he do? He made a people upon the
[1:22:35] earth that he could express himself to.
[1:22:38] Amen. And same thing, we are here if
[1:22:40] we're made in the image of God, we're
[1:22:42] built for one another. Amen. We're not
[1:22:45] here for ourselves or what we can get.
[1:22:48] Amen. No, we're here for one another.
[1:22:50] That's why the body is so powerful when
[1:22:51] we come together is that we when we
[1:22:53] genuinely love the Lord, that love will
[1:22:55] flow through us to one another. Amen.
[1:22:58] that God can can pour in virtue,
[1:23:00] strength, prayer, you know, you know,
[1:23:04] exhortation, you know, strength through
[1:23:06] one another to his body. Amen.
[1:23:10] Hallelujah. Why? So, so, so if you're
[1:23:12] just living for yourself, you have an
[1:23:14] eternal life. You can have the form of a
[1:23:16] believer, but if you're just living for
[1:23:17] yourself, what you can get, you have an
[1:23:19] eternal life.
[1:23:21] Amen. But if you're living for others,
[1:23:24] praise the Lord. That's eternal life is
[1:23:25] living for others. And he says, "Listen,
[1:23:28] here's a lovely thing. As you serve one
[1:23:29] another, you're serving God." See, the
[1:23:31] love of God is in every Christian heart.
[1:23:34] And be kind to one another. Forgive one
[1:23:36] another. If you don't see the scriptures
[1:23:37] just as like, well, you believe anyhow,
[1:23:39] pray for the other person and just love
[1:23:41] one another. You'll find there's no
[1:23:43] greater evidence of a Christian in the
[1:23:44] world than love. You say, "I thought
[1:23:47] brother said receiving the word."
[1:23:48] Absolutely. But what does it produce?
[1:23:51] Amen. If it's just in the top two
[1:23:53] inches, it becomes someone who's a love
[1:23:55] of their own selves. But if it's in the
[1:23:56] heart, it will the love of God will come
[1:23:58] in and flow out.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Why? Because
[1:24:04] we're not here for ourselves. We're here
[1:24:05] for one another. And you see if people
[1:24:08] actually you know you take um you know
[1:24:10] there's TV shows and things where you
[1:24:12] know where where they take selfish
[1:24:14] children that are bratty that are
[1:24:15] fussing fighting tant temper tantrums
[1:24:18] and all these things and they'll take
[1:24:19] them to other families and take them to
[1:24:22] and places like serving soup kitchens
[1:24:25] helping orphanages all these things and
[1:24:27] they become happy they become calmer
[1:24:29] they become more caring. Why? because
[1:24:31] they're forced into a situation where
[1:24:34] they have to live for someone else, but
[1:24:36] they become happier people. That's just
[1:24:38] showing that humanly we're built to help
[1:24:41] one another.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're grumpy and upset all the
[1:24:45] time and fussing and fighting, maybe
[1:24:47] turn your focus to someone else. Oh, but
[1:24:50] you don't know the thing I've gone
[1:24:51] through, all this big problems I have
[1:24:52] and all these things. You focus on the
[1:24:55] Lord and let God live through you to
[1:24:56] someone else. That thing will take care
[1:24:58] of itself. Amen. Don't let it become
[1:25:00] some big idol, some big thing, some big
[1:25:02] mountain in your life. When what is it
[1:25:04] compared to the grace and transforming
[1:25:06] power of our Lord Jesus Christ? Amen.
[1:25:10] It is nothing.
[1:25:15] The Apostle Paul, as I said, it's
[1:25:16] interesting how things are written, the
[1:25:19] order of it. He says, "Let him that is
[1:25:20] taught in the word communicate unto him
[1:25:22] that teacheth in all good things. Be not
[1:25:24] deceived. God is not mocked. For
[1:25:26] whatsoever a man seweth, he shall also
[1:25:28] reap. He that sweth to his flesh shall
[1:25:31] of his flesh reap corruption. But he
[1:25:33] that sweth of the spirit shall of the
[1:25:35] spirit reap life everlasting. Be not
[1:25:38] weary and welloing. For in due season ye
[1:25:40] shall reap if we faint not. Now many
[1:25:42] times we just take that and think, well
[1:25:43] that's just about me and what I do and
[1:25:46] what I sow I'm going to reap in my own
[1:25:48] self. But he's not just talking about he
[1:25:51] says as we have therefore opportunity.
[1:25:53] So we have now because of what we've
[1:25:55] just read, we have this opportunity. Let
[1:25:57] us do good unto all men, especially unto
[1:25:59] them who are of the household of faith.
[1:26:02] Amen. So he's saying what you sow,
[1:26:04] you're going to reap. Amen. So if you're
[1:26:06] sowing a love of your own self, what are
[1:26:08] you going to reap? What are you going to
[1:26:10] produce when it's selfishness, with
[1:26:12] negativity, when it's being
[1:26:14] condescending, tearing people down? What
[1:26:16] are you going to get out of the people
[1:26:18] around you? It's not going to be love.
[1:26:20] It's not going to be joy. It's not going
[1:26:22] to be the Holy Ghost living. It's going
[1:26:23] to be that carnality that you've seown,
[1:26:25] right? But someone who is not a love of
[1:26:27] their own selves, what do they want to
[1:26:28] do? They realize, Lord, I have an
[1:26:30] opportunity today to be good to my
[1:26:33] family, to speak good things. I'm sorry,
[1:26:35] this is very simple, but this is where
[1:26:37] we are. Amen. Because we can know all
[1:26:39] the revelations of the all the seven
[1:26:41] everythings and rainbows and whatever
[1:26:43] more. But this is the character of God.
[1:26:45] Amen. And God is looking for a people
[1:26:47] that have his character, have his divine
[1:26:49] nature. Amen. Today he says this is
[1:26:51] where this therefore this opportunity
[1:26:52] let us do good unto all men especially
[1:26:55] to them who are the household of faith.
[1:26:57] So what should be our motivation
[1:26:59] motivating factor? Lord I want to do
[1:27:02] good to all men.
[1:27:04] I want to be friendly. Lord I want to I
[1:27:07] want to be a positive impact on everyone
[1:27:10] I come across. I mean it doesn't matter
[1:27:12] if it's just passing in the street or
[1:27:14] maybe at the checkout counter in the
[1:27:15] supermarket or at school or someone. I
[1:27:18] want to be a positive influence. Amen.
[1:27:20] Where they can see, well, at least that
[1:27:22] person's happy. Amen. At least that
[1:27:24] person is actually, you know, I want to
[1:27:27] have what that person has. I don't know
[1:27:28] what he's drinking, but I want some of
[1:27:30] it.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is that? That's being good to
[1:27:33] all men. How can I help? Be be
[1:27:36] thoughtful of others,
[1:27:38] not just thoughtful about yourself.
[1:27:40] Amen. And he says, especially to them
[1:27:42] who are the household of faith. Now, why
[1:27:45] is it so important to do good unto the
[1:27:48] household of faith? Well, it's because
[1:27:49] this to me ties in with brotherly
[1:27:51] kindness. You know, we've gone through
[1:27:53] some of the virtues of the statue of the
[1:27:54] perfect man. And the last one before
[1:27:57] divine love, Christ himself comes down.
[1:27:59] It is brotherly kindness. Amen. And this
[1:28:02] is such a thing the devil loves to fight
[1:28:05] is brotherly kindness. Cuz he knows if
[1:28:07] he can knock that virtue out of the
[1:28:09] church, then divine love can't descend.
[1:28:12] You say, "Well, I've got divine love.
[1:28:13] I've got the Holy Ghost. But what about
[1:28:15] those around us? Cuz I hate to say it,
[1:28:17] not all of us are sealed to the day of
[1:28:19] our redemption yet. Amen. I believe it's
[1:28:22] going to happen. I believe it's on its
[1:28:23] way. But what about those who don't know
[1:28:25] the Lord yet? Amen. So, what kind of
[1:28:28] atmosphere should we be projecting and
[1:28:30] brotherly kindness should we we let God
[1:28:32] produce in our lives that that capstone
[1:28:35] can descend upon them?
[1:28:38] Amen. See, this is very important. You
[1:28:39] say, "Well, I'm just coming to church.
[1:28:40] I'm just on a WhatsApp chat. I'm just
[1:28:42] part of the band. I'm just part of the
[1:28:44] youth group or the couples or whatever
[1:28:46] part you I'm just I'm just part of it.
[1:28:48] No, you are very important. Amen. Your
[1:28:50] influence Amen. can bring people into
[1:28:53] eternal life. Amen. I tell you what,
[1:28:56] friends. I say this why we should do
[1:28:57] good to the household of faith is that
[1:29:00] that they who are struggling, those who
[1:29:02] are hurting, we don't project how great
[1:29:03] we are, but we say, "Look, there's a
[1:29:05] bomb and Gilead. I care for you. We're
[1:29:08] in this together. Amen. We're in the
[1:29:10] same trench. We're in the same bunk. You
[1:29:12] know, we're fighting the same enemy. I
[1:29:14] mean, we're not here fighting each
[1:29:15] other, but we're going to do good to one
[1:29:17] another. Why? Because we want each other
[1:29:19] to gain ground. Amen. We may be like,
[1:29:22] you know, there's the 12 tribes of
[1:29:23] Israel, but you know that, you know,
[1:29:25] they had to realize what one tribe did
[1:29:27] affected what the other tribe did. Or
[1:29:29] the blessing of Judah had to come. You
[1:29:31] know, if if they are living according to
[1:29:32] the word, then that blessing will go to
[1:29:34] the other tribes. Or if there was
[1:29:36] something that they doing wrong will
[1:29:37] come into the other tribes. Like
[1:29:38] Jeroboam when he built the two golden
[1:29:41] calves, he was a lover of his own self.
[1:29:43] How can I build my own kingdom? How can
[1:29:44] I protect protect this thing? And so
[1:29:47] those two calves were built there in
[1:29:48] Ephra and Dan, I think it was. And what
[1:29:51] it do, it brought that curse of idolatry
[1:29:53] into the whole nation. Wouldn't it be
[1:29:55] good if we could do the opposite?
[1:29:58] I believe we are doing that where we can
[1:30:00] live a life, amen, where God's blessings
[1:30:03] can flow into someone else. Is this okay
[1:30:06] this morning? Our lives have impact.
[1:30:08] Amen. Our lives have eternal value.
[1:30:10] Amen. How we treat one another. Sure,
[1:30:12] we'll be misunderstood sometimes cuz
[1:30:14] we're human, right? But we got to look
[1:30:16] beyond that and actually say, "No, no,
[1:30:18] that's my brother. That's my sister. I
[1:30:20] want them to go forward." You know, it's
[1:30:22] it's such a horrible thing in this
[1:30:23] country. This jealousy, this revenge
[1:30:25] spirit, utu, whatever they call it in
[1:30:27] Moldi, you know, wanting to to to see
[1:30:29] people be cut down and be and be brought
[1:30:32] to the bottom of the cliff. It's such a
[1:30:33] terrible thing where people get this
[1:30:36] attitude in their mind that person
[1:30:37] deserves what they got.
[1:30:40] We should never have that kind of thing.
[1:30:41] That's a love of their own self who has
[1:30:43] that kind of mentality. We must never
[1:30:45] ever think that about any world. They
[1:30:47] deserve that. Well, look at what they
[1:30:48] did. And if they if they listen to me,
[1:30:49] well then that would never have happened
[1:30:51] to them. We must never have that
[1:30:52] mentality. Amen. We must that must be so
[1:30:56] foreign to our thinking. And I know some
[1:30:58] of you look at me like, "Why would I
[1:30:59] think like that?" Absolutely. Why would
[1:31:00] you think like that? Why would you think
[1:31:02] that, oh, they're going to get their
[1:31:03] comeuppants and they deserve those
[1:31:04] things? That is wrong. That is not
[1:31:07] Christian. That is not doing good unto
[1:31:09] the household of faith. Amen.
[1:31:15] Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:31:18] trust we're all good today. Right now,
[1:31:21] amen. All right. Now, now when we get to
[1:31:23] that brotherly kindness, put yourself in
[1:31:25] his place.
[1:31:27] Someone who loves himself will never put
[1:31:29] themselves in their brother or sister's
[1:31:30] place. Amen. But put yourself in his
[1:31:33] place on the matter. You say, "Well, my
[1:31:34] brother sinned against me." And Peter
[1:31:36] said, "Shall I forgive him?" He said,
[1:31:37] "70 times a day." He said, "70 time
[1:31:40] seven." See, brotherly kindness. Now,
[1:31:42] you see, if a brother is all out of
[1:31:44] tune, don't be impatient with him. See,
[1:31:46] no. See, be kind to him. Go anyhow.
[1:31:48] Somebody said not long ago, "How can you
[1:31:51] believe these things the way you do and
[1:31:53] still go to the Assemblies of God and
[1:31:54] oneness and all the rest?" Then put see
[1:31:57] brotherly kindness, see hoping someday,
[1:31:59] see patient with him, see temperant,
[1:32:01] enduring with him, knowledge to
[1:32:02] understand what he believes. Remember
[1:32:04] what's in his heart. I mean, it's in his
[1:32:06] heart. That's what is virtue in yourself
[1:32:08] to let it go out with kindness, meekness
[1:32:11] to him, having faith that someday God
[1:32:14] will bring him in.
[1:32:16] Amen. That's brotherly kindness. You got
[1:32:18] to put yourself in their shoes, you
[1:32:21] know, and don't just don't just cut
[1:32:24] people off. Don't have a knee-jerk
[1:32:26] reaction. You know, something, you know,
[1:32:28] there's a misunderstanding between some
[1:32:30] brethren. You jump on one side of the
[1:32:32] other. We're not here to do those
[1:32:33] things. We're here to look beyond those
[1:32:35] riffs, aren't we? Aren't we, family?
[1:32:38] Can't we look beyond misunderstandings?
[1:32:40] I mean, misunderstanding should just be
[1:32:41] a, "Well, Lord, forgive them. Forgive
[1:32:43] me, Lord. We want to serve you better,
[1:32:45] Lord. Just put it under the blood."
[1:32:47] Don't don't don't harbor those things.
[1:32:48] You see, someone who loves themselves
[1:32:50] feels entitled to be offended. I have a
[1:32:53] right to hold this grudge because of X,
[1:32:56] Y, and Zed. What h what happened to me?
[1:32:58] They feel entitled because they're a
[1:32:59] love of their own self. But those who
[1:33:02] love the Lord say, "Lord, I I want this
[1:33:04] off my hands, Lord. I don't want this in
[1:33:06] my spirit. Lord, I don't want this thing
[1:33:07] to affect anyone. Lord, take it from me,
[1:33:09] Lord Jesus. Cleanse me, Lord. Wash me in
[1:33:12] your blood."
[1:33:14] Amen. Now, you say, "Look, I don't like
[1:33:15] Brother Neville." Oh, or I sure don't
[1:33:18] like Brother Jones. I don't like Brother
[1:33:19] so and so. and someone be like, "But
[1:33:22] just let something happen to him,
[1:33:23] brother. Your heart is broke. It just
[1:33:26] nearly killed you." See, you can obtain
[1:33:28] brotherly kindness and feelings for one
[1:33:32] another. Have you ever had that?
[1:33:35] When something really happens to
[1:33:37] someone, your heart goes out to them.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; I don't like that person, but when it
[1:33:42] really hits home
[1:33:44] that Lord, help them. Lord, undertake.
[1:33:49] That's how we should feel. Not the
[1:33:51] dislike part, but the whole when
[1:33:53] something really But then if it's in
[1:33:54] your heart, well, they deserve it. Well,
[1:33:56] you ain't got no brotherly kindness
[1:33:58] there. When you really have a feeling
[1:34:00] for that person. Amen.
[1:34:03] And feeling one for another. See, but to
[1:34:05] maintain in a group of people, why do
[1:34:07] you care for that brother? Because we've
[1:34:10] broke bread with him here at the altar
[1:34:12] as you will tonight. Your fellowship
[1:34:13] with him. You shook the his hands. You
[1:34:15] worship with him. He's your brother. He
[1:34:17] might do something in the flesh that you
[1:34:19] would disagree with because uh you just
[1:34:22] kind of stay which of you ought to do
[1:34:24] but shun him a little but in the bottom
[1:34:26] of your heart it's something happened to
[1:34:28] that brother it would nearly kill you or
[1:34:30] that sister.
[1:34:33] Amen.
[1:34:35] I trust we feel that way that we really
[1:34:37] care about one another. Amen. That we
[1:34:39] can say why do you like why do you love
[1:34:41] that person? We've been through battles.
[1:34:44] We've been serving the same Lord Jesus.
[1:34:46] We're on this journey together. It's not
[1:34:48] me and them following. No, we're all in
[1:34:50] this together. Amen. We've been through
[1:34:52] things. We've been through hard times.
[1:34:54] We've been through good times. Amen.
[1:34:56] We've been through times and the Lord's
[1:34:57] undertook in marvelous ways. And we are
[1:35:00] in the same journey together. Tell you
[1:35:03] what, friends, you feel like that and
[1:35:04] you know they do something you disagree
[1:35:05] with, you won't shun them. You realize,
[1:35:07] no, no, we were in this together back
[1:35:09] then. We're in the same faith today.
[1:35:12] We're going to walk on.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:19] I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:35:21] finish that there. Could we have the
[1:35:23] musicians, please, this morning?
[1:35:27] But can you see the peril? You see how
[1:35:30] this can be perilous?
[1:35:32] Amen. People who are lovers of their own
[1:35:34] selves grows into this horrible thing
[1:35:37] that we read this list here.
[1:35:41] But those who love the Lord
[1:35:43] shine as the sun. I mean those who love
[1:35:46] the Lord with all their heart, soul,
[1:35:48] mind, and strength. Those are the ones
[1:35:51] that God is looking for. They don't love
[1:35:53] themselves. No, they love him. Amen. And
[1:35:56] they have the right kind of selflove
[1:35:58] because they know their value. You see
[1:36:00] someone someone the devil has twisted in
[1:36:03] their mind that they're worthless, that
[1:36:04] they don't mean anything to anybody.
[1:36:08] That's a lie.
[1:36:10] Okay, I'm just finishing with these
[1:36:11] remarks. That's a lie. We should love
[1:36:13] ourselves but in the right way. This is
[1:36:15] this is my summary. If you love yourself
[1:36:18] in the wrong way, it's all about you.
[1:36:20] Okay? If you love the Lord with all your
[1:36:22] heart, it's all about him. And if it's
[1:36:25] all about him, you'll live for others.
[1:36:27] If it's all about him, you want people
[1:36:28] to go forward. If it's all about him,
[1:36:30] you forgive. If it's all about him, you
[1:36:32] love. Amen. If it's all about him, you
[1:36:35] put yourself in their shoes. You can try
[1:36:38] and be understanding. Lord, why did they
[1:36:39] do that to me? Why' they say those
[1:36:41] things? Because you're caring about
[1:36:43] them. You care about their soul and
[1:36:45] their eternal destination. But if it's
[1:36:47] all about you, just a love of your own
[1:36:49] self. It's all a selfie thing. If they
[1:36:51] do something wrong to you, you cut them
[1:36:52] off. I mean, if they do something that
[1:36:54] you know, you know, that hurts you, you
[1:36:56] hold a grudge. That's someone who's a
[1:36:59] love of their own self. We should love
[1:37:00] the Lord so much that doesn't matter
[1:37:03] what someone does to us, we say we want
[1:37:05] to intercede for that person, not in a
[1:37:07] condescending way. said, "Lord, they
[1:37:08] deserve, but Lord, help us. Lord, you
[1:37:11] helped me. Lord Jesus, you brought me
[1:37:13] through. Now, my brother or sister's
[1:37:15] going through something, Lord. You know
[1:37:16] the backstory. I don't know what they're
[1:37:17] going through, but Lord, you understand,
[1:37:20] Lord. Help me, Lord Jesus, to be a
[1:37:21] strength and encouragement, dear God.
[1:37:24] Because why? I'm not a lover of my own
[1:37:25] self. I'm a lover of you, Lord Jesus.
[1:37:27] And I want to see you shine to this
[1:37:30] world."
[1:37:32] Amen. Let's stand, shall we?
[1:37:34] Amen. Let's sing that song. I'm amazed
[1:37:36] that you love me.
[1:37:41] I'm amazed
[1:37:45] that you love me.
[1:37:49] I'm amazed
[1:37:52] how you care.
[1:37:56] Through your preious
[1:37:59] blood, I found pardon.
[1:38:04] And my sins
[1:38:06] are washed.
[1:38:08] They're all washed away. All my sins
[1:38:14] are wash away. I'm amazed. Oh, I'm
[1:38:19] amazed
[1:38:22] that you love me.
[1:38:26] I'm amazed
[1:38:29] how you care.
[1:38:33] Through your preious
[1:38:36] blood I found pardon
[1:38:41] and my sins
[1:38:43] are washed. They're all washed away. All
[1:38:48] my sins
[1:38:50] are wash away. Verse one. No one knew.
[1:38:55] Oh, no one knew how alone I was feeling.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[1:39:07] hide.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Though I laughed and said my life was
[1:39:13] mine without you.
[1:39:17] I was covering up the secret tears I
[1:39:22] cried.
[1:39:24] Then one day someone told me of your
[1:39:29] mercy
[1:39:31] and of the love you showed on a hill
[1:39:34] called Calvary.
[1:39:38] There you
[1:39:41] purchased my redemption
[1:39:45] when you broke sin's power and set my
[1:39:49] spirit free.
[1:39:53] I'm amazed
[1:39:57] that you love me.
[1:40:00] I'm amazed
[1:40:04] how you came.
[1:40:08] Through your graious
[1:40:10] blood, I found pardoned
[1:40:15] and my sins are washed.
[1:40:19] They're all washed away. All my sins are
[1:40:25] washed
[1:40:27] away.
[1:40:30] Yes, it's true. There have been days
[1:40:33] where I failed you.
[1:40:37] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[1:40:41] astray.
[1:40:44] But I've learned your love is stronger
[1:40:47] than my weakness.
[1:40:51] When your ears are open every time I
[1:40:56] pray,
[1:40:58] oh no
[1:41:01] for me like you.
[1:41:05] Other friends would never be as close to
[1:41:10] me.
[1:41:12] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[1:41:16] tomorrow.
[1:41:20] Knowing you are everything I'll ever be.
[1:41:27] I'm amazed
[1:41:31] that you love me.
[1:41:35] I'm amazed
[1:41:38] how you feel. Through
[1:41:42] your graious
[1:41:45] blood I found pardon
[1:41:49] and my sins
[1:41:52] are washed. They're all washed away. All
[1:41:57] my sins
[1:41:59] are washed
[1:42:01] away.
[1:42:05] Praise the Lord. You're amazing. He
[1:42:06] loves you. Amen. Let's pray together
[1:42:09] this morning. If you're going to slip up
[1:42:11] your hand, we're going to put both hands
[1:42:13] up. Just ask, Lord, I don't want to be a
[1:42:15] lover of my own self. Be a lover of you,
[1:42:18] Lord Jesus. Almighty God, as we bow our
[1:42:21] heads this morning, we don't want to be
[1:42:23] lovers of our own self, caught up in
[1:42:25] ourselves, oh God, in the wrong way,
[1:42:28] Lord Jesus, just have a form of
[1:42:29] godliness, but denying the power
[1:42:31] thereof, Lord, to be hitty and
[1:42:33] high-minded and just so caught up in
[1:42:35] what we think we are. And Lord, we don't
[1:42:37] want to be like that. We want to be Lord
[1:42:39] a lover of you Lord Jesus to love you
[1:42:42] with all our heart soul mind and
[1:42:43] strength that we can love our neighbor
[1:42:45] as ourself dear God that we can treat
[1:42:47] others how we want to be treated Lord
[1:42:49] God not in a condescending way not in a
[1:42:52] negative way but Lord to uplift one
[1:42:54] another to encourage one another to
[1:42:56] strengthen one another Lord Jesus I pray
[1:42:58] dear God for all of us here Lord we live
[1:43:00] in this age of the age of self the
[1:43:03] selfie generation I pray dear God that
[1:43:05] that spirit would not affect us Lord And
[1:43:08] if it has, I ask it be taken from us in
[1:43:10] the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, that
[1:43:12] that we wouldn't be caught up in
[1:43:14] ourselves. But Lord, as we read the
[1:43:16] quote, eternal life is living for
[1:43:18] others. We want to live for others, oh
[1:43:20] God. May we look to our children, look
[1:43:23] to our spouse, look to our friends, our
[1:43:25] loved ones, Lord. Look to fellow
[1:43:27] brothers and sisters. And Lord, may we
[1:43:29] may we desire, Lord, how can we be a
[1:43:31] blessing to the body, Lord? How can we
[1:43:33] be an encouragement, dear God? How can
[1:43:35] we live a selfless life that care that
[1:43:38] only desires that you'd be glorified and
[1:43:40] known? Grant it, dear God. We thank you
[1:43:43] for your blood. Thank you for your
[1:43:44] mercy, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for your
[1:43:46] Holy Ghost living in us, Lord, that we
[1:43:48] can live a life that is for you, Lord,
[1:43:50] that is selfless, Lord, live for others.
[1:43:53] Thank you so much, dear God. I pray you
[1:43:55] you'd bless each one here, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:58] We truly do live in perilous times, but
[1:44:00] I'm so thankful, Lord. Doesn't matter
[1:44:02] how perilous it gets, Lord. Your word is
[1:44:04] still true, Lord. You've manifested
[1:44:06] yourself in this day, dear God. The
[1:44:08] light is shining, Lord. We can trust in
[1:44:10] you, Lord. We know that you're greater
[1:44:11] than all the peril, Lord Jesus. You're
[1:44:13] the one who calmed the Sea of Galilee.
[1:44:15] Lord, you're the one, Lord, who brought
[1:44:17] Lazarus from the grave. Lord, you're the
[1:44:18] one who's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:44:20] forever. You're the one who conquered
[1:44:22] hell, death, and the grave, my God.
[1:44:24] Father, there's nothing, no place, no
[1:44:26] condition too difficult to you that you
[1:44:28] can, Lord, that you retreat from, dear
[1:44:30] God, but you walk in boldly, my God. So,
[1:44:33] Father, may we just trust in you like
[1:44:34] never before, Father, and live a life
[1:44:36] that is for you, oh God, that you'd be
[1:44:38] glorified. Grant it, Lord. We love you,
[1:44:40] Lord. We thank you so much in Jesus
[1:44:43] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[1:44:47] friends. Amen. Brother Isaac, I'll turn
