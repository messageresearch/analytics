you don't come it is worth nothing so please father we invite you in in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you said we two them more together in your name they you are in our midst father we welcome you in and we just ask your blessing over over this service in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen thank you musicians Hallelujah I like this new church man you got some wingspan when you sing hey there's no nobody around you the other when we were in the old church you know and and it was it was a good place for us and I really enjoyed it man it sounds yeah I understand what you say brother Ben you're all so far away feels like I have to shout at you guys but but in the old church you always had to worry about who's the guy next to you you know because you don't want to poke them in the eye or you know give them a a slap or cuz it it it kind of brings you out of that anointing you know you get so in the song service and then the very first thing you do is you knock someone and you're like oh sorry and and it brings you back down to earth we don't want to be Earthbound we want to be Heavenly bound so so I encourage you make space and use your arms okay defy gravity hallelujah amen now it's a privilege to be able to speak to the Bri of Christ and I love all of you and tonight we got a couple of little things uh the Lord has placed on my heart and I asked that you know I always say this the more you pull there's always the devil on the one side of the rope and you on the other side of the rope and he wants to pull you into that Lake of Fire that's all he wants to do he just wants to destroy you he he really doesn't like you very much and that's fine we don't like him either okay if you look a bit around you in the world today he's done enough damage okay um can you turn me down on that fallback if there is a fallback just sounds like I'm going to little okay that that's just me it's my exing um but if you start pulling if you can start pulling and and you get that word for you you're actually gaining ground and you're pulling him closer to where he's going to end up anyways it's the Lake of Fire and sometimes it's hard because you had a big day but don't stop pulling because there's a blessing in it for you fight fight all the way boys okay if you have no teeth coming to death so uh we're going to turn our Bible to 1 Samuel and we're going to read there from the third chapter amen I almost so nervous standing here right Hallelujah I don't have a slideshow so I'll try to speak in pictures how's that sound I'll try my best I don't know how to do it brother Andy does it really well but I'll try as well and we're just going to read a couple of verses there and then you can have your seat before we pray first and then you can have your seats and it's it's called a call from the Lord we really want to hear God's voice in our day we we really desperately want to hear his voice amen but not just us but you as an individual so I encourage you don't stop until you hear his voice don't stop asking don't stop praying don't stop ever for a second until you hear his voice okay that's my encouragement for you tonight I'll try to keep it as lighthearted as possible it was a bit heavy some of it but don't worry we're going to get through it okay it says and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass that at that time where Elias was laid down in his place his eyes began to wax them oh Lord help us and he could not see and here the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep amen let's just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word Lord Jesus we ask you know we can read these verses my Lord but it's only you that can open it up for us so we just ask tonight Lord would you bless this word take my lips it's yours Lord I fully surrender to you Lord I ask that everyone here as well Lord if there's any hindering spins anything keeping them back lord may you just take that in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord and just rebuke those spirits send them away father and just give them a time of your presence in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you can have your seats so for you I've got a couple of nice definitions so open Vision it says here in verse two verse one it says and the word of the Lord was precious in those days days there was no open Vision so that means they were at a place where they had no Revelation so a open vision is showing you who you are where you are and where you're going to go it's it's God directly coming to your address now stay with me we we only started now you have to stay here I want to see eyes God coming straight to your address and actually personally starting to talk to you that's an open Vision now what Eli did here is he started to go into his old you know just into works you know I I just work I'm just a preach I I preach a sermon I just work and my sons get the offering and they do the sacrifices and they'll get the best meat out the sacrifices turn a little bit of a blind eye to it and he just started getting used to his day-to-day churchgoing member Sunday we're at church Wednesday we're a church you know we do church because we church goers just get used to it but the Bible says there he says his his eyes began to wax dim so I don't believe it's out of old age I believe it's out of routine cuz I've seen some people look back at me from the the congregation and their eyes wax dim have you ever seen it with brother V I don't know if you ever seen it you know and and I'm not listen just follow me they're like this and you speak to them and you look at them and they're like they're a million miles away their eyes are waxing them because remember we're in a very very evil time if you really go out there and you go to different churches the word of God is not there there is no there is no Revelation to help them overcome you know they keep pleading Grace they keep pleading Grace they keep pleading Mercy they they keep sinning and it's a it's this this whole thing the whole time it's just the whole cycle of sin and and Mountain experience and Valley and sin and forgiveness and sin and all those things and they just cannot they can't push through because see the word is not there and that's why God had to send us a prophet to to open the word again to us to show us who we are Hallelujah because see the word is so precious and he says in the end times people will look for that word and they will not find it and they'll go to Great extent to find it brother Ben and I we were today at a place he came and helped me to to clean a a temple and these these people pay a lot of money and they are very sincere very sincere and they spend millions of dollars we're not talking small money Millions I don't want to tell you how much but if I would say I give you 10 million to build us a church brother Ben you already got the plans going you're like what can I work with what can I not work with we talking major money and sincerely seeking God but see the word is close to to them how fortunate are we we got the word open to us huh you I don't have to spend a million bucks I can rent a church and get the full revelation of Jesus Christ for my day doesn't matter where we are we can go from house to house we've got god with us we we don't need to work up into some some state of Glory or some state of prayer to break through and get it yes that's all needed but we don't have to work ourselves into into the the revelation of Jesus Christ we can rest so when you come here tonight rest don't fall asleep but rest let the Lord Minister shake the tension off you know the worst thing when you get into a rugby game is and I used to play rby you stand there and the guy next to you is like your head and shoulders bigger than you and you're standing there in the line brother Ed will know all about this and uh you're going to run up to the field now and you're so tense you're so tense and you get next to this guy and you go oh dear like mate I shouldn't have looked and now you're tense all of you boys know what it's about and you get on the pitch and I used to kick off and they give you the ball and you look at the ball and you go to the line and you bounce the ball and all you want to do is I just need to kick this ball and you think man it's tension you're like okay forwards you're there and I don't really know what I'm doing and the reef looks at you and go are you ready and you're like yeah inside you're like nah that guy's going to kill me man he's bigger than me but then what happens is as those nerves are as as you get nervous there's an expectation coming and then muscle memory starts taking over then training starts taking over you young people then training in the word starts taking over now don't lose me now we're talking about open Vision then the prophet's message comes back as you walk as you get nervous and those type of things the message says calm down calm down I've got you I've got you I send a prophet to give you all these Mysteries that the people wonderand and grasp about calm down and you can take the ball and something just happens you go and he Blows the Whistle it goes and you go well boys time to play and you kick the ball and the moment you kick the ball you're in game mode so when we get to church that's the nervousness that's today you had a horrible day yeah fine today you struggled out there you you couldn't figure things out you come here you're all nervous but when the preaching and the song leader start singing it Is Well with My Soul you go it off it's going to be a good day it's going to be a good day God's going to talk to me and he's going to help me with whatever I struggle now now that wasn't in my notes that was for free so have it but see uh Eli he started dimming over because it started just becoming a ritual it's just we go to church we sing a couple of songs he ministers he preaches we all stand up when he says I'm about to close we're all happy we go home it it became like that yeah and then God said no says I I don't want this because it's now becoming a tradition so I'm going to remove myself from him and and the word of the Lord departed from Israel and and he said to Samuel listen Samuel I'm going to let you complete the work I'm going to let you you go on with the word but he wasn't very happy with that situation now I'm not saying he's not happy with our situation I I honestly think shakina is the best place to be I'm I'm sorry you know I love all of you so much I I cannot go to heaven with not not one of you not being there you know it's a love I can't describe to you I I cannot man I just I can think about anyone even Josh B bad hairstyle I can think of and I can have a smile okay you know all of you I don't look at Abes and go oh Abes I don't look at you know brother fish and go he's got a better chin than me or anything like that it's not like that yeah sorry fish but you know I don't look at that type of thing oh look at there's my brother Ben the Lord Has Done much in his life he's gone so far and he's still going so far so so when I get here I don't think I have to preach you into heaven I just know you're coming anyways how can I go without Lilia come on man huh brother all your daughters here we've got we're so fortunate we're so fortunate but now what happens to know is you need to know what God wants for you for your life now this is where the rubber hits the road and I want to talk a little about about influence tonight but before we get there I want to just talk about where you're going to find the will of God for your life you can play a million message tapes and miss it you can learn this message and recite it from A to Z you'll still miss it it is a personal relationship with Christ the the the one thing I want to bring back and I want you to listen to this this is the best English I have okay because I'm not officially a kiwi as well I got good English now individual Uno walk no other person gets between you and Christ yeah no no other enticing Spirit no other I'm so of my nose but I'm enjoying it no other person has a right to become between you and God Amen Hallelujah it must be so personal that you must fight for every inch of being with God and he fights every inch to be with you amen because when you when you when you're in fellowship with God little things don't matter you know little Shenanigans and snake bites and all these things that wants to hit you you know you think about those brass serpent guys that's the Lord taking two services and putting them together that's not these men yes but now you start seeing hey God's getting my attention because he's talking to me if you can start saying God's talking to me in the service and not Peach falking it then you're in relationship with God am amen when it becomes the Pitchfork goes away you know so as you Pitchfork the last Pitchfork just let go of the handle it goes and then all you do is Lord it was for me you know what brother Ben he always preaches at me every Sunday every Wednesday thank you Jimmy thank you brother M they always preach at me so I'm sorry you guys have to be here for them preaching at me but the message is so personal that God's talking to me and if you can take every message like that yeah where would we be yes sir it's so easy to go oh yeah no that brother and that sister and oh surely yeah know they need a bit of vision and that needs Direction and no no no no no let's come home Hallelujah God comes to your post box and he takes the mail and he puts it in your mailbox what are you going to do with it open it up tonight amen okay so we go on and we go to acts 10 cuz I want to give you the answer go to acts 10 book of Acts see I I read I Don't Preach a lot out of the New Testament because the message is the old and the new and I like the Old Testament because it's very dramatic sometimes I just love it hey people die there's Wars you know arrows going rocks flying it's just cool the New Testament it's Miracles but man sometimes I just like fighting it's this is that African me I'm sorry don't say Amen Love Don't Say Amen please don't okay so we know yeah we we'll start at um acts 10 and we're just going to read from verse 1 to8 I'll do it in my best best of English and it's cornelius's Vision so so see how the Lord Works he's going to say Cornelius I'm going to send you I'm going to send you a little message from me but but I want you to experience it yourself so brother Armand brother Ben brother Jimmy brother Ed brother M brother Isaac I'm gonna I'm gonna throw you today with a a quote or a sermon but it's just for you can you take it and he says there was a certain man in uh oh ch ch or whatever called Cornelius a centurion um of the band called The Italian band I didn't know he was in a band that's cool see you guys you know there's there's the musicians in the Bible already but we're not making fun he's in a band a devout man one that feared God with all his house wow sincere feared God really with all his house and he prayed to God always so man this guy was in fellowship with God something had to happen something had to happen amen and he saw a vision uh evidently about the 9th hour of the day an angel of God coming to him and saying to him Cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord he knew who his God was and he said unto him thy prayers and thy arms are come up as a memorial before God so when you pray when you have fellowship with God might take a while you know you might think God don't hear you you might think yes man I've been on my knees I've got calluses there already just stay there God hears Amen in in his time Sovereign and now I send a man to Jaa and I called him Simon whose surname is Peter he lodged with Simon the tenner whose house is by the seaside and he shall tell thou what thou oughtest to do so he's telling him because you love me so much I'm going to send the brother and sister from shakina Tabernacle to come and visit you by your work your school your place of residence to come and tell you about the seventh um Church Messenger to come and tell you about what God is doing in this time I want to make it personal he needs hands and feet yeah and he's now reached a very sincere Christian somebody that loves God and it's praying and asking him for Revelation and for showing where he is in time and he says I'm going to send you a vision so I want you he saw the vision nobody else and then he said so directly in the vision that I'm going to send the man to come and tell you what you need to do wow huh think about it how how important are you people it's important it's not bad don't feel sad about it listen God can send you anywhere to be a testimony for him and he works on both sides not just once both sides and he wants to send you there and he wants you to go hey go tell that man I love him right go tell that man he's one of mine just bring him in no matter and Donnie Reagan brother um Ed sent me a a little clip of brother Donnie Reagan that was preached about how should we be about the Sinners that come into our church that God goes and touches that Sinner and saves that man how should we bring him in you know no don't judge the sin or sinner just get the sin out of it and let's talk to the person let's get a little bit more personal in our walk with the Lord amen because he wants to use you yeah so bad cuz these guys like Cornelius out there waiting for you to come around their path and say hey the Lord showed me a vision and you were in it and he said your bride come and see huh he's been sitting next to you at work how long how long but today is his day of visitation amen oh Lord help us okay we're going to drop down there to verse 34 now Peter gets this and he goes and visits Cornelius and now he starts telling Cornelius how is this how's this going to work because Cornelius really wants a relationship with God but he's going to tell Cornelius this is how I think it should go this is what the Lord told me to tell you and we go there verse 34 it says preaching to Cornelius then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of person so I want to hammer on this there is no ranking with God there's no lead musicians or or big pastors or big deacons or sisters that's been in the message still the message started in 1954 45 or there's nothing like that God don't don't don't you ever get off on a tangent like that you know oh I came from a minister that was in this country and he ministered this certain way and he said this certain thing and get all of that out of your books straight away he's no respector of person and no matter how you put a person on that table or on that platform he's going to knock him down y we'll get to there we are not allowed to lift a brother up above any other brother or a sister God does send people and big oak trees and you can clean off them you know people that been been coming in like brother Colin he's got how many years under him and I can just sit in fellowship with him and get good gleanings off him and you respect those Brothers amen but he's is my brother and guess what in the Rapture he's going to be 21 and I'm going to be 21 who's older then come on man we all are going to be family so don't don't do that thing because what happens is when we and I'm going to get to it now but when you do a ranking you you start lifting people up and then when that that person uh disappoints you you know you you fall in your walk with the Lord because you base your walk on the Lord and with the Lord on what a person's opinion or way they conduct themselves or how they see the word you you major on that and not the word of God so Cornelius here picks it up and he says no no no no God doesn't respect the person he doesn't respect the persons well let me tell you what he does he says but every nation that fearth him verse 35 and worketh righteousness is accepted with him the word which God sent to the children of Israel the word remember he sent Jesus Christ to Israel okay the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory I'm going to send the word to them this book in flesh form and then look he goes on to it and he says preaching peace of Jesus Christ he is the Lord of all that word I say ye know which was published throughout all of Judea so he says this word of Jesus Christ all the Miracles that followed him all the wonderful thing he done everything it preached the Beatitudes all those things it was published and it's available so get into your word he says Cornelius no matter how much you jump up and down go find it out for yourself I can only lead you that far but the rest of it you need to go you need to get into the word amen so that means that it's a it's a such a personal thing that he has to become one with his word he has to become one with this book he has to eat this book for it shall be sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly cuz some of these words oh man they're just beautiful hey you can have whatever you want you just ask God it's all good and then other times he says please don't do this and you're like o it's a OD saying but all he wants you to do is just stay in my word are are you still here amen okay okay because he says if you do that you'll be accepted in the Beloved God just will accept you and that's in verse 35 he says there um but every nation that e fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him so just on the basics that you have respect for who's ever standing on this by this Pulpit not lifting them up respect the one that's sitting next to you the one that's sitting in front of you the one that's sitting behind you the one that's not here if you keep your respect for for them you keep your love for them amen God will just go let's move on cuz it becomes a one-on-one walk with God we go on and I'll use the example of it let's turn mate these Pages go everywhere hey that one's done Isaiah let's go to the book of Isaiah amen Isaiah 6 it's a little bit of a little bit of homework but it's good amen amen Isaiah 6 I had it here so now one day and I want to read you this quote I see to read this and I want to read this I I I want you encourage you to go and listen to brother bram's uh tape on y um I'll send the the link on brothers and sisters if you want to do it brother Ben if that's okay go listen to it man it will just encourage you it encouraged me man it just when when when things go so crazy all of a show he just goes hold on hold on here you go just go go chew on this for a while oh man it has been a blessing and he says here in the book of Isaiah and I want to start with this quote and we'll read the first verse he says the year that King Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and he trained fill the temple so what happened here now is we know that that Isaiah he he really he loved this King Uzziah and brother Brandon picks this up here and he says he loved him so much that he he was he was he was leaning on his arm he said so Isaiah he could lean upon the the king's arm this is quote number 99:99 and he was a young man of favor a fine spirit in this young man so the king loved him and one day the props got knocked out from under under him so he looked up to this King but God didn't want him to be under a headship of a man God don't want you to be under just the headship of a man if you don't if you don't follow what any man preach or any angel or any Minister preaches and it's not in the word stay clear of it because you you don't want to go on the headship of a man though brother brother Ben is Our Shepherd and I shared the message a little bit with him and he didn't look at me too funny and so I know he's not too worried about this one but he but just remember brother Ben if he's deciding tonight to walk out of those church and said I'm done and he walks out and brother Isaac said you know what if he walks I walk too I want to ask you where you're going to go what did you base your relationship with Christ on your pastor cuz I've seen churches fall apart when pastors die yes sir completely fall apart sorry I Pat no serious they fall apart the deacons wants to run the show and this one and we heard about bit of testimonies and I saw chaos absolute chaos I need to maybe drink some water but and it hurts me to see that men build men up and then when those men leave churches or die or pass on and God's done with him the whole church falls apart yeah it just tells me they were never based on the word of God they were only based on a concept of the message sorry it's hard we had people out of this church as well devastated us but we still here because there's more there's more holding me than just a couple of good scriptures that a pastor says off the pulpit though we have the most amazing Pastor in the world and I'll always stick with him as M but if he leaves this door and he says it's over with a message brother man I'm coming for you I'll knock some sense into you because the thing is I can see what the message prod produces this is a 11 testimony you asked me 30 when I was at the age of 32 would I be doing this I would tell you never in my life promise the words of brother Isaac Brother Andy he said all he could talk about is cricket and smoking that was what filled this until I meet him but see now with Uzziah and now I'll leave I'll leave that just for the we we'll go on with it but Uzziah when he got removed Isaiah looked at this thing and then brother Brandon picks up it says and he looked around him go listen to that sermon and he realized that the world was not everyone like King Uzziah and that it were evil place a place where people speak unclean because remember he was only in the presence of mom and dad the whole time you home school children listen listen to me no no this is good for you listen I want to encourage you Mommy and Daddy not every mommy and daddy is like them you children that stay at home or that has a mom and dad that's filled with the Holy Ghost not all parents are like them I came from a house where there was no holy ghost in that house I can tell you they not all like that the holy ghost is now in that place praise the Lord but before then it wasn't in there and it's not a nice place to dwell because you never know where you stand you know we never know where you are there's always tension there's always fighting there's always that the depression it's all it so makes you so nervous we need more of God because it makes a house wholesome so you might think your parents are all boring because they put all these Gates everywhere boys and girls but they want to stop certain influences in your life from influencing you to do the wrong stupid thing that we did too yes sir because guess what When We Were Young we also made mistakes and when you're young you going to make mistakes but we here we want to go to the children and say I don't mind you making a mistake but how do we fix it how do we get over this because we're Overcomers so God goes and removes Uzziah away and Isaiah the props get knocked out of him and he starts realizing he's a man with unclean lips and he's now just seen that these two cherin that comes and they they got their faces covered with two wings and they got their feet covered with two wings and with two Wings they fly it's a it's a it would have been such a vision and the one cries out to the other one holy holy holy and the temple shook oh man it was it would have been something for him to see so he got some sense knocked into him right there but he had to get under under the influence of the king had to get away from it and the moment that friend of yours at school is out of the scene the the one that so makes you do all the things you shouldn't do the moment you can get away from that guy and have a little bit of time with the Lord and spend some time there things happen you start realizing I'm a man with unclean lips and I dwell amongst the people that has unclean lips and Lord how am I going to do it how am I going to do it and the angel goes and he grabs this coal of the fire and he takes it to Isaiah and he touch his lips and he says I'm going to sanctify you because you already realized you need me amen you're already justification I need Christ ABCs always believe Christ I need Christ but then the Angel takes that call and he touches his lips and he becomes whole and but the Bible says there the iniquity and the sin is getting taken away so iniquity children if you didn't know I didn't know either iniquity is doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing where God has revealed for you something he's busy talking to you he's busy drawing you and you willingly look away it's a worker of iniquity you know you ought to do it you know it's not right not willfully sinning hold on you just turn a blind eye to that and say hey if I don't know it then God won't judge me on this that's iniquity you know so God wants to remove that iniquity away from you wants to remove the sin from you and then what he said to Isaiah he says I want to send you to go preach to a people but they're going to reject your message but I first need to clean you up they did they rejected his message he says you're going to make their hearts fat and marry what did he say listen listen to this so beautiful he says I heard the voice of the Lord say who shall I send and go forth and then he said Lord you cleanse me send me here I go but now he says to him Ye Ye indeed but understand not he said oh no sorry it says and he said go and tell this people he he indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes morning let them see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be um healed but they won't listen they're going to reject your message cuz they don't want the truth in this hour they don't want to come out of the sleep that they don't want to come out of the lullaby they want to have the YouTube videos and all those things and you know they want to be in the influence of of a international rugby player or a box or they want that influence in their life they want that influence they don't want to hear you and Mom and Dad has been preaching it how long and now it's coming over the pulpit now you don't want to hear that then you're a worker of iniquity and that's not a good place to be because then God goes I have to now take gloves off because you're my child and I'm going to have to get your attention somehow and now your trial start but don't worry do is a light we get we're getting somewhere just follow me so then Isaiah realized he's unclean and then Isaiah jumped into an action and he wrote the whole Bible cuz God he met God he got clean and then he got the inspiration of God and he wrote the Bible from Genesis and Revelation in 66 books huh yes man 66 chapters or is it 68 one of the two I think it's 66 I'll go to the end of the book I'll tell you hanging there 66 yeah so thank you Lord but the thing is he had to be cut from those friends those people they lean on too much his favorite preacher especially the guys that's on YouTube that loves all this YouTube preaching hey nothing against it my mom and dad streams our services hello Mom and Dad I love you they love being here they don't have Fellowship where they are so there is a place for it but be careful where you lean because brother Ben has been ministered and placed in a certain area for a certain people and there is nobody that's going to pray for you like that man I can tell you now I hurt my back when I was still working in a tow shop and I I lifted up some tiles and it was just before camp and as I turned I just I just pinged my back but really bad and the boss said to me you will keep on working and because I wanted to go to Camp I just kept on working and I just pushed through the pain but when I got home I just crumbled and brother Ben heard it and he was on his way home basically kicked the for the front door down to come and pray for me it's the first time a man a pastor came and knelt by my bed and prayed for me it was one of the awesomest experiences I had wasn't suddenly healed don't don't get me wrong he's still God's a miracle working God and sometimes it just takes a little bit of time but I made it to Camp I made it to Camp so that man God bless you brother Ben you have done so much for us and keep doing it and you Sister Christine as well thank you so much for your sacrifice but now here here we go so Uzziah now gets into Fellowship now I want to ask you something this is the other side of the coin you you're in fellowship with God you you're sincerely praying about something and you want God to give you his Direction and you've been praying and praying and praying and praying and praying and it just feels God ain't hearing you at all can I tell you something hello Daniel how you doing Daniel lived in Babylon have you looked around you where we are we're in Babylon the most evil age there's ever been we are in right now am you can't even look in the mall or hate Mall man you walk into the very first doors open up and you go f not the people the posters I'm not even getting to the people yet people are blind they got naked girls everywhere guys and don't know what that is but and they're all nice and buff and cool and and the whole mall would you walk through it's glasses no clothes we cool have we lost our minds I want to ask your children this is a very and you think it's funny but it's not would you like your mom and dad to walk like that next to you in town Reuben would you like that cuz I'm cool cuz he's doing it and you're looking at them and you're drooling cuz you think wow look at the body what about if I show up there next to you and go hey Reuben we're going to town huh you I got my Budgy thing on hey let's go to town and my and my jandals huh let's go to town would you go with me but you go to the mall and you say that's fashion yeah are you crazy man where is the state of this world they are insane am so if I have this underwear on and I stand at the beach it's Beach Clos I walk it to the mall hey bro you're wearing underwear oh but a second ago it was Beach clothes come on girls and we all look at it and we go oh she's got such a nice body she's committing adultery and you wouldn't want your mom and dad next to you like that you will never allow yourself like that on a sober mind out there but we look upon it every day and it becomes normal and Daniel had enough of this and he's walking in Babylon and he's looking at the normal and he says he gets desperate he says God I need a word from you when will this end when are we getting rid of all this when is this whole thing coming to end cuz I can't stand Babylon it's shiny it's beautiful it's cool it's all this happening stuff it's got Facebook and Twitter and all this nonsense with it and every video that you can see on the phone it's got It's got movies and TVs and connections and cars and laptops and oh it's so cool when is this going to stop I'm tired of this and he goes to a river to pray now I want you to know the key here he rejects everyone he takes the calans has been pushed The Magicians has been pushed away all the guys that's around him he just pushes them away and he goes and he gets so Billy minded and he goes to a river and he starts praying and he says Lord if you don't come I ain't moving here but I need your voice in this time cuz I'm tired of it all I don't want to be like these guys I don't like walking in the malls I just had enough when does this end and what would you like me to do and for 21 days he stayed praying and praying and praying and he does why is God not coming he said I'm Healed why is God not coming he says my children is mine I don't see nothing happening why is the depression not leaving me why have I got this anxiety when is my business turning all these things that you have that's so easily besetting your mind and you think God's not answering he goes hold on you live in a very evil age and there's very evil stuff going around you get out of it for a while get into my presence I want to visit you but the prince of the power of the air the Prince of Persia is busy hindering your visitation cuz you get so busy and I want to come and visit you and Gabriel wants to come and see you and give you your message for your day he wants to but there's the Prince of Persia holding him back but you keep praying don't stop I encourage you don't stop because Michael is coming Michael's coming and he's going to take that Prince of Persia and he's going to push him out of your life so that you can hear the voice of God and Gabriel will give you your instruction and it is a battle every single day 21 days when I quit smoking took me 21 days and every day was hard but I just kept telling me I'm not a smoker I will not and I heard and this is strange this before I even read this a guy over some program said takes 21 days to break a habit I said it takes God to break a habit but it takes 21 days because it's scriptural amen because 7421 God is 7 years every seven years something happens Shantel and I is just going through a lot of these things and and the Lord's showing us so many other things every seven years there's something major happening in someone's life that's where when girls when they're 14 year old you guys are crazy man boys when they 14 they think they walking exells and you cannot man sometimes you just want to go and but there's a change in their body and it's normal yeah you just have to bear with them and pray brothers and sisters Pray when your wife gets a certain age and it's 7:14 21 my wife's 21 and and and and you see something happens and she starts telling me I don't know why I'm tired all the time time I don't know why my body is doing these things I'm doing weird stuff I'm feeling just not myself it's okay Prophet said it's okay it's just the time of life just move on but see the thing is that don't let that hinder the work of God in your life your body is just going through stuff and teenagers there is no teenagers in the Bible you show me the scripture for it I tell you you can be a teenager there's no teenagers in the Bible you young men and Daughters of God you're either a child or you spoke like a child now you're a man or a daughter of God that's it there's no teenagers so there's no excuse to tell me I'm a teenager doesn't work you're a young person you got choices to make and if you make the wrong choice guess what you reap what you sew done boom CL jump out of the tree gravity sucks does don't don't expect to fly when you jump out of a tree and you're a big man is I can fly you're going to fall on your face it's going to hurt okay so when you're a young man and you want to act like a young man your words have power your decisions have consequences your prayers count and God wants to come and deal with you as a young man not a child anymore he doesn't come and give you a spanking every time you did something wrong he wants to say okay just tell me what you did wrong man up let's get over it let's move on you know and here Daniel comes and he says I'm going to get so desperate and I want you to get so desperate too because I'm getting that desperate as well say Lord show me where I am in the body show me where I am in your plan show me where I am in my daily walk show me where I am with my wife show me where I am with my sons and my daughters show me where I am and not I want favor just show me how you see me Hallelujah and you'll quickly realize that sometimes you'll be with unclean lips and God just just needs to come and deal with it let him deal with it let's move on don't stay 14 please don't stay 14th it's hard enough musicians you can come up it's a short one tonight don't worry I don't want to preach you to sleep yet um but I want to encourage you see because remember Daniel he waited for his visitation and and nothing was going to move him and it doesn't matter matter how shiny the world is around you brother and sister we don't need that shiny you don't need it you need the word of God you need to stay in your word you need to feed of the word of God I'll close with this he says when this Prince of Persia comes in like a flood when when we prayed for sister Robin and the Devil comes in and says you're not going to get you healing when we pray for someone here coming for for and they say anoint them with oil and pray for them and they shall be healed when it when it GES gets to day 18 or or when you are depressed for long enough or just discouraged for long enough just hang in there 21 days if you need to 21 years if you need to I've seen people that God didn't answer their prayers for 21 years I'm a witness to it but God willor answer if you just stay on your knees don't lose the battle remember you're living in an evil age and it does affect this it doesn't affect this but it does affect this and sometimes you just need to pray a little bit harder amen but don't lose courage God doesn't answer you but I can tell you young people all you young people hear what brother Arman tells you tonight there everyone here cut the influence of bad people in your life it will be the best thing you do and get on your knees and start reading this I didn't say start understanding this am because why did I start smoking bad friends why did I start drinking bad friends why did I walk away from God bad friends if they loved me that much they would have point Ed me to this church yeah or a message church I want you to understand if they love you so much you know there was one of santel's friends listen to this she said if you love me if you really care for our friendship you'll smoke too and she said I never had the words to answer this lady back until now she said if you really did love me and you really cared for me you wouldn't ask me that because where's my will in the story where's my my I want to be clean I want to be holy where's my plan in your life cut those friends with whatever you can do cut those things and don't go to the mall no I'm joking amen who wants to cut those things who who wants to cut them okay I don't say don't be a lightful people you'll have people that's really bad in your life and God has placed you there for a reason to catch them don't let them catch you no the standard he says cuz when the enemy comes in like a flood when this Prince of Persia comes in when the friend asks you all these things that you shouldn't be doing or trying to entice you let God raise the standard and keep your eyes clean amen cuz then you won't wax them and do silly stuff Hallelujah there was a song that we sang that one I think there one is a touch by a fire that one can we sing that one please brother Josh you can come up God bless you Saints I'll let brother Josh um end in a word of prayer but maybe I'll just I just want to pray for you tonight anyways let's just close our eyes and say Lord Jesus we come here before you Lord and we want to come and say Lord we want your influence in our life Lord we just want to walk with you we want our joy
