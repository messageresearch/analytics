we again Victorious it's Wednesday and we made it to church amen everything else didn't want you here but you're here thank you musicians God bless you give them a hand of Applause amen Jos took the song service and showed me how to sing God is tremendous because last time I was K that song I tried he but thanks Josh for for surrendering yourself to see his gift he could have given it to two he could either give it to the world or we going to give it to G God I'm so glad he gave it to God hey because it's blessing me so all your musicians thank you so much stay surrendered just letting you stand a little bit so you don't fall asleep on me no I'm joking God bless you all let's go to the Book of Exodus and we're going to go to Exodus 14 um a very powerful thing that brother M said in Simplicity and it just stuck by me brother M God bless you richly he said if you want everything you get God first and then you'll have everything amen because what you maybe see before you meet God and you think that is everything that ain't nothing until you come into His presence then you have everything amen so we're going to go um Exodus 14 we're going to start there at verse 10 and uh we're going to go and it was the fear of the people so now what happens I'll just quickly run you into the story and we know that Moses you know was was the mighty deliverer that God used to get to get pharaoh to to move the people out of Egypt to get the Hebrew people out of Egypt the Israelites going on the 40-year journey which took a long time you know 40 years it's a long time and uh what happens is but the people always feared they there was always fear in the camp yeah no matter what God did there was always fear in the camp man a tough crowd if he ever would say hey and Moses he just wants to do his job but this is this fear now I'm not talking about fear but it is a thing that is very real when you're in that situation but we shouldn't be governed by this thing called fear it is not our boss not a boss of us and the best of English I can tell you it's not your boss he says and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid which of course you would be because they're coming with a lot of weapons and you have nothing they're not they're not now thinking on a spiritual level they're just thinking hey they're coming to get us we're doomed so remember they were in a very real situation this wasn't just like they seen the Miracles oh you should just believe and move on hold on guys they were going to get murdered Massacre that's what's coming their way and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt with us with this with us to carry out us out from Egypt is this not the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone so wait hold on I thought all of Israel was happy to put on their shoes and March out the door isn't that the story the world says we're just happy yeah just like oh let's Supply the blood and everybody's just happy and we're just going to March out no it wasn't that way there was a lot of a lot of stuff going on in the camp and that's why God had to send all those miracles to get them and persuade them that there is a bigger thing happening and with all that going on they were still not happy where they are right now that's not my sermon but just I just thought about it man they're still not happy with where they are um and then they said for it's been better better for us to serve the Egyptians than we should die here in the wilderness and it's true and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which I will show unto you today this day for the Egyptians who you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever Hallelujah period full stop amen there's prophecy right there and the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace remember that verse 14 and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward amen you can have your seats may the Lord just bless the reading of his word I just once more pray and say Lord Jesus as we read the scripture I ask that now you would just come and make it real to us Lord Lord because we can have this Bible Lord but we need you to make it real to us Lord and if you don't do that we have failed so I pray that you would just step forth in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen so we we see now that God says to Moses why cry speak and you think but hold on God wants us to ask him things God wants to to get us to a place where we can actually cry out and say help me I'm in a situation where I need help because remember he's got attributes he wants to display so we we find this a bit contradictory if to go like Moses comes and and he's crying to God for help and he he needs Deliverance right now and it's a very real moment and God goes hold on why cry speak and you're like whoa that's a bit just what's going on here but see God knows what's going on Moses don't Moses is walking where God says I'll lead you and he's just following what the Lord is telling him but God knows the beginning from the end that's right God knows how the events is going to unfold Moses is just standing in time so God says don't worry about it I got tomorrow just just hold position but while you're there you got a duty you need to speak address your enemy so my my sermon title for night tonight is why cry speak speak very important not think Ed and I had a bit of Fellowship about it today but not think not deliberate not not keep it to yourself speak your outcome let it be known get that word out there cuz there's an anointing released on that word and that word that you speak under that anointing will bring fruit back to you but somebody's going to have to say it brother Andy said every time the devil attacks him is when he brushes his teeth because he knows he can't chase him away it is cuz now his mouth is busy and it's true and he says every time I'm brushing my teeth the devil will give me these random thoughts and like he knows it because I can't rebuke him because I can't speak devil knows when to attack so now we're thinking about predestination so God looks at Moses and he rebukes it and it seems harsh but remember predestination means the forn knowledge of God knows when you get to a certain situation what you're going to do you still have to do it amen this is where the rubber hits the road but he knows what you're going to do because because he knows your character and he knows when he designed you he knows everything he put inside of you CU inside of you is something that you might not know these a this called predestinated seed of God children if you listen tonight oh my Lord you better listen cuz I'm going to ask you 10 questions we go I'm serious amen okay cuz this is for you this is not for the older people they they I'm preaching to the young ones man this is the story of Moses we all should know this shouldn't we okay so so I hope your pencils are sharp and you're on it cuz it's coming so he's asking God to help him but God has Place something in Moses that Moses don't know it's there yet so remember he's only and we're going to go a little bit forward he comes and and he is a type of Christ so what if you if you think about it it really dve Tales night when was Moses born when they were persecuting the babies when when was Jesus born when they were under persecution Jesus was born to be a prophet Moses was born to be a prophet you see there's types coming out here Moses was to be a deliverer Jesus was our deliverer you know so it all just the Bible scripture just Dove Tales it just works out and um there's a couple more he was the lawgiver Jesus was on Earth and he took and he took magnified the law and he says even if you look at your brother with anger yeah then you have committed murder don't do those things you look at another woman so he came and magnified the Lord but Moses brought the law so it's such a beautiful time so you can see God in every life in in in every life of a Christian you can see it these are not stories this is God displaying in the Old Testament a shadow of what's going to happen in the New Testament but what's actually happening now as well yeah there's many of things it's not just one layer God is perfected in three yeah okay so remember three is perfection and then he was also to be a leader Christ is our leader cuz he had to lead them through the Wilderness when they needed healing where did they go to God they went to Moses and God said to Moses do it and God Moses would raise up the serpent and there it is they look on the serpent but Moses had to be the healer so see it was such a beautiful type that Moses was to be but Moses didn't know he was that when he was born you know he was a miracle of his day if you really think about it all the other twoyear olds and down they were fed to the the crocodiles correct the Nile crocodiles ugly things man really but Moses made it and not just that he got picked up by Pharaoh's daughter and got raised by the enemy got fat and strong and trained and and everything in the enemy's Camp God knows how to to do things don't you try to figure it out Moses didn't ever think it was going to be in that situation Moses's mother would never think that was going to happen and that she would be able to still have him as a son you know been paid for while he's been fed and then she can go to him and say Hey you know God said he's going to send a deliverer 400 years will be in Egypt well according to our watch we're there and she would tell him all these stories but Moses did not know it but he knew what his mom was telling him it was still just a head knowledge the message is sometimes still just a head knowledge I want you to think about it between the lines it's just another scripture that's been fulfilled and the prophet came and he open some scriptures and we know the mysteries of God and the Seven Seals and the Thunders and they know everything but it's still just the head knowledge so now Moses finds himself still with the head knowledge it hasn't really become Revelation yet so now see before the plagues fell Moses was still in Pharaoh's house and he looks out the window and he and he has a look at the Hebrews and the Hebrews are getting whipped and they're getting beaten and it's going hard it's pretty much like this day today we look around the church and everything is getting a whipping isn't it yeah you know economy is all falling apart everything is going you can see that we can't rely on on this monetary system as Believers this is not our go we have to be on God's monetary system Hallelujah we have to be on God's economy we can't be on the world's economy right now if you're on the world's economy that will fail amen V's economy will not fail there is a place we just as Believers if we stop a little bit and we just have a look around now she will all fail like Isaac showed those graphs it was shocking the debt and everything is just going up somewhere that thing must hit a ceiling oh yes and once it hits the ceiling what's coming down a lot of stuff we can't be then on that system we need to be on God's systemen so it's the same with the message you can't just understand the message as a head knowledge you can't just just think I'll figure out what brother brandom said and I know what he said and I know all the quotes and I know all this stuff but it's it hasn't become tangible or Revelation to you yet it's still just a message and you still refer it to it as a message but it can't stay a message it has to put on flesh it has to manifest in someone but the more you read the message and the more you try to push it and here the further you'll walk away from God because you're still putting it into a intellect you're not putting it into a life Lord you can listen to all the sermons of brother Brandon non-stop play audio like people that do chain smoking they light one after the other of the other after the other if I can just break this habit it can become a habit I come home I put on a tape I don't even hear what he's saying I come back oh there's a nice point and make a quote and because I can use that one day and it still hasn't put on flesh but see God knows what he's placed in this message God knows what he's placed in the messenger he wants you to dis playay what this message can do but now what happens is he's going to put Moses through some test so of course Moses gets to the first Egyptian and he sees how he handles it and he's having a bit of a conversation pots the guy guy's dead buries him and all of a sudden he's running for his life yeah because he wanted to deliver Israel his way yeah he knew who he was he was told who his was he was identified that it was a peculiar birth his mom told him you would be that Mighty hand that will deliver us he just didn't know the how he said the message is true he just didn't understand the how and the why and the why me right so God said okay I got you I'm going to put you through a couple of Trials so he gave him an angry wife send him to the desert say could chill out there for a while right and she gave him the beans why are we here I don't want to be here I wanted to be there it's just hard but God's Building character amen amen so who finds it easy when it's easy it's good oh but when it's hard it's when you dig for character yeah you go God why me why now you know why always me why now why again why not you you you're really you're so in fighting with God but you're still not walking in Revelation you're still only fighting you're still only in the top four inches where the battle is but we haven't really stepped out of your trial so God goes to to Moses and he says to him okay I'm going to meet you in a Burning Bush Moses walks past and he see a bush burn and that bush keeps burning and it keeps burning and it keeps burning and he's like surely still burning a man is still burning there's something about that bush I'll go and see and as he walks there the Lord says take off thy shoes yeah and something comes real before that he was the mighty deliv and now all of a sudden hey bro let's get humble take off your shoes this is Holy Ground Hallelujah now something speaking to him which he can't explain now when the the prophet of God says good morning or good evening friends and he's starting to talk he goes actually's speaking to me how many of us and this is a true testimony listen to a tape and would receive healing while you're listening to a service or Revelation or overcoming or a sin that besets you so much and you're listening to it and all of a sudden is like brother brandom just speaks to you straight away directly only to you and you're like man this is so much perfect timing what's that the tape no it's God getting your attention amen it's God giving you an experience it's God telling you this is not just a letter okay this is life yeah amen so but he has not met God yet he understood God he knew about God he knew where he was he knew his identity as a message believer but he had not not yet that experience so he's still on first base so the pitch is lined up he gets to the base he swings the bat and there's not even a ball coming yet right he doesn't know what he's doing there kids he's still just thinking I know what I'm doing no Revelation but then the pitcher steps up and he throws the first ball and he goes man that was fast I blinked I didn't see it God came on the scene and said Moses I've got a job for you now Moses go okay Lord you got my attention I'm going to be with you now I want you to it's going to this has to take place in all our lives I'm going to be with you I will explain to you I'll I'll show you miracles I'll walk with you but I want you to just do what I tell you to do so now he's a good message believer and he steps in and and as the prophet he walks and he says I want you to go to pharaoh and say Let My People Go and he goes to Pharaoh after he had a heaps of excuses he's Let My People Go whose people is it God's people yeah he just says I will go with you and you speak what I tell you to speak and he speaks it but still he's now working miracles are happening but he's still just walking in the message he's still not is God's with him I want you to understand it but God's not within him yet and God has got something in Moses he wants to display to Moses but Moses is still just following orders which is good but that's not where we ending tonight he wants Moses to realize who he really is so he says whatever you say if I say there's flies there will be flies you just say it I'll bring it I'll vindicate you as a prophet brother brandom came and there was healing revivals and prayer meetings and prayer calls and he would say this is your name and you are healed and thus sayth the Lord and it would happen every time every time and every time he said haven't I done this in the name of the Lord has any of this not come to pass you you stand up right now if it is like this you tell me cuz we need to fix this then nobody ever challenged him amen so God was with him but see even brother brandham had to face some battles in his life to know what he was talking about and same with Moses amen so now Moses walks out and they starting and and and eventually there's 10 plagues kids hands up what was the first plague do you know yes blood water into blood so Vindication hey the blood comes water it's great and Pharaoh goes oo good trick okay I believe you but I'm not convinced yet do you know what the second one was yes frog the frogs M waking up with a couple of frogs in your bed that will be a bit uncomfortable but this wasn't like two or three this was hundreds man it was like there was frogs Galore you think frog frogs is bad this is not these type of Crocs there was frogs everywhere and they they slippery and they're disgusting okay who likes frogs no okay and then what was the next one I had to write them down just to make sure I don't lose my time who knows the next one they're irritating those things they're everywhere especially in the summer flies flies and you're like SWAT SWAT no this was not you couldn't miss you just do this and you get like 50 20 hundreds of them it would have been so annoying and still look Pharaoh's heart is still hard Moses sees the signs the Egyptians see the signs the Hebrews see the signs everybody believes the message everybody sees the message everybody criticize the message God vindicates God vindicates still just flies they don't see the hand of God in it yet it still just flies it's not here yet and then he sent the next one he plagues the kettle and the horses and then they die they start dying so now the livestock gets affected not really good the kettle the kettle the kettle and then after that it's hail and then after the hail he had fleas in there as well but then it's the Locust Locust eats up everything destroys it and then it's the darkness yeah and it's the death of the firstborn yeah okay so I just thought i' bring it to you but I want to explain you something Moses and all the Israelites saw every plague yes was part of it all correct yes now they walk out of Egypt and as they walk God says to Moses I want you to take them to a certain place where there's a lot of water in front of you and a mountain to your Loft and guess what behind you is going to be the Egyptians yeah now remember all these Miracles just happen every tape I listen to I hear God come down every every time brother brandom speaks I go man no man speaks like this but it still has not anchored anywhere inside here because you first have to meet him you have to have that experience Hallelujah so see they get to the the the the sea and here they in front of it and they look behind them and there's a big mountain and they look here and here comes the Army and now they start crying yeah and God says you don't have it yet you don't have it yet because you're still you're still crying you're still fear you're still worry about tomorrow I hold tomorrow and he says to him why C I speak just take your Rod lift it up walk through speak it will be dry ground and so he goes through but the story doesn't end there now Moses gets through on the other side and then what happens is when he gets to the other side and it's me very he he gets there and they see the wonderful things that God has done and it's like that cycle just keeps repeating just keeps repeating after everything but see when God saw Moses he knew that there was more in Moses that he put there and that's why he said to Moses I want you to speak your outcome amen I don't want you to cry I want you to realize that you are a son of God Amen and that you have a position and authority over your enemy over your trial over everything that you do there is a place for you when I anoint you and I bring you up there's a place for you I won't be long tonight kids just hang in there we'll get there and every other believer in the Bible he does exactly the same but see he had to meet God in the burning bush himself before he really knew who he was because before then he was just a prophet living out a tide if you don't meet God yourself this message will always just be a bunch of written quotes dos and doubts it's the long and short of it you young men you want to pray for a wife it's all good brother Bram SE pray for a wife you want to pray for uh uh overcoming over anything or you want to pray for a release on anything you can pray as much as you like but if you know God yeah if you really know him intimately know God and you struggling with addiction or anything that is sin that's besetting you you got authority to speak but I want you to realize you need to meet him first amen hallelujah there must be a experience with God that anchors in that I know that I know that this what I'm talking about is real and this force behind me is not just a hope so or a little promise in the Bible but it's thus sayith the Lord because he says he says I am the vine and you are the branches that meaning God wants you to realize that I can live completely through you I can take every burden away I can break everything off your life I want to use you to do it amen I'll be the force behind you pushing you Just Surrender but I need you to show up for the battle so Joshua we're going a little bit ahead he was under the ministry of Moses and now he comes and he is now standing there before Jericho and it's the same he saw all the Miracles he is a Believer a devout man really good believer but he needs that confirmation he needs that experience God you got this and you are there and the captain of the host shows up when he looks at The Impossible God comes on the scene and he has a meeting oneon-one with God and he talks to God and he says to that captain of host are you for us or against us he says I come to take over this is my show this is not you this is my show I stepped into this burden now I stepped into this trial now I've stepped into what you can't overcome it is real I'm here now but I want your hands and feet yeah come on Joshua I want your hands and feet because if I'm going to defeat your enemy I'm going to need you to do it amen I ain't going to fight your battle for you I'll send more forth my angels I'll protect you I'll encamp around them I'll slay a mighty host if I need you can you show up Hallelujah can you show up amen are you ready to show up or are you still just going to say I don't understand it do you want really to meet the end of that enemy do you want to cut off his head I need you to show up and Joshua gets there and he goes to Jericho and the captain of the host gives him the instructions to do he does it exactly as but it hasn't really sunken in yet I'll explain to you something that same Lord comes and he says to him now I've got AI in front of you I want you to destroy them I'll send forth I will destroy them utterly but please just show up to the battle go for the battle so it's rigged Ed brother Ed it's all rigged he gets to the battle it's all rigged AI gets utterly destroyed it's just they just destroy them and and Joshua starts seeing what Listen Hold on God's got this I need to show up because men we've got this AI King you know this this artificial intelligence you know all these computer stuff that's happening now the smart knowledge and everything but God says I got the battle that's it he says so guys I know we're not going to swing much with the sword and you're not going to get that tired but God said put on your full armor go to the battle and wait for orders first guy goes ah everybody go ah and they go and fight and they win the battle not worried God said I've got that but see now what happens is and I'll close with this I'm not long this is easy stay in it now Joshua goes further and he fights the the five Kings they go and they go to gibian and because he made a league with gibian which they tricked him into he now has to keep his word now the five Kings they fight the of I think of their amorites but all the five kings came and they fought now against Joshua but gibian lets Joshua know hey we you need to protect us we got a deal so this is not really his fight yeah God didn't send him there this is not your trial you just happen to find yourself in a trial where everything is spun out of control and course you done something it has a consequence on the consequence on the consequence and you find yourself in this battle and it's actually not where you should be but you're there things are happening your trial is real amen but see Joshua remembers one thing he remembers God saved me when he saved me at Jericho he helped me with AI I'm fighting an enemy the sun's going down I need more time and now what he does is he speaks yes he doesn't go in a corner and praise he's in battle he's fighting a very real thing and he says what instead instead of admitting defeat I'm going to say sun stand still hold your place we need time Moon you go stay over that Valley I need time right now and God knows because he's in his position and he's now spoken anointing was released and guess what the elements Stood Still and they utterly destroyed the enemy Jesus hlu so here's my do you know what force you have because you've come in contact with a living God Amen do you know that this thing called your mouth is the most powerful weapon you could use and all the devil wants to do is keep it quiet right he wants to hinder your prayer life he wants to hinder your children's prayer life your family altar he wants to take the praise out of you he wants to take the joy out of you he wants to take the testimonies out of you but yet this is the most powerful weapon you can go I had enough amen that's it I had enough this stops tonight amen this besetting sin I had enough this I can't overcome I had enough amen this depression I had enough amen you know I had enough I know what's my position I know who's my God I'm going to push back Hallelujah son you stand still he wasn't angry with the son he was busy fighting he just spoke it so I want you to realize us as Christians have such a a powerful weapon called this and we can we can bring life with it and we can bring death with it but life is so much easier to bring if you just surrender to the one that met you that gave you the Holy Spirit and said I will be in you and with you till the day don't you don't think what you're going to say I'll put the words in your mouth amen but be prepared to speak it and believe it because as God said he says if you say to this mountain to be moved removed into the sea and believe it yeah you can have it amen so challenge is not just to speak but to speak and beli amen and God will come behind that and back it up and that was the same with Moses it was the same with Joshua it was the same with Daniel it was the same with sedra mesach and abedo he he'll Deliver Us he can it was the same with all the Believers there was no doubt so the situation that goes into your carnal flesh shouldn't be affecting what's coming out of your mouth this should this should be the opposite you would go okay this is hell for I'm going through it but blessed be the name of the Lord I will win I will overcome amen you won't get it I will overcome praise the lord it's done but the thing is we choose the low ground and we try to reason this thing out and work it out and how's it going to work and how's tomorrow going to work and is it going to do and this and you got all this going on the women they got lots of that going on men's pretty much but it's still going like that but just that way women go that way and woman man but the thing is God don't want you to think about it God wants you to speak what he says and believe it and move onu that's it brother maram that's it because the battle has showed up on your doorstep he's just asking you Joshua what are you going to do yeah I want king of AI I want that guy's head yeah I want depression's head I want I want whatever is killing you sister Vanessa everything that's that's here on the heart I want it but I want you to use your sword I want you to use your word I want you to speak it believe it receive it and walk on I don't want you to display I'm a a a defeated God I want to display myself through you I am the vine can you surrender speak and move forward and that's how Joshua Wan the campaign the moment they started reasoning that's when the achens happen the moment they started thinking on their own way that's when the trouble goes wrong but if you can just speak and believe and walk God's got it amen don't worry Hallelujah he's got it he could bring them he can let walls fall he can help you amen there is nothing too great for God amen amen I mean I I'll give you a testimony and I'll I'll close with that it's not a big one tonight I started a business and when I started a business I had to learn to surrender fully every second of every day because boy when the devil climbs in man he's punching left right and Senter telling me everything I cannot do and continuing he's pouring it on he just comes and comes and comes until God said what are you going to do about it I say hey tomorrow will be a good day blessed be the name of the Lord you have no work for the whole week praise the Lord he wants me to do something else I had to physically speak it and say well if I don't have a work for that then I'm going to do something something for the Lord or I'll I'll work on his business because it's his place and I I started changing the way I speak I want you to realize to reflect his word not to reflect my feelings Amen to reflect this every promise he gave me Hallelujah he's taken so much time to write this book and give it to us and yet we can't take one of the promises and say hey that's for me but we want to argue and fuss and worry and he goes yeah but it's written yeah there it's written yeah I've got the plans for you plans to prosper plans to do good to be healthy I want you to succeed you're my son you display me I want you to go forth and and Conquer that thing but we don't take the time to stand on this no we reason oh man and we can reason so I want to encourage you if you feel yourself outweighed and and you feel really that that this has become a dead letter you haven't met the Living God I want to say it again I feel really inspired saying that if this is a dead letter you haven't met the Living God that wrote this because for him nothing's impossible amen and every story that people thinks is a story is actually a real life testimony he brother Jimmy every life in here is a testimony it's not a story if you make it a story you make the letter dead yeah right you tell God he tells stories he doesn't tell stories tell the truth huj so everything written in here I believe it if it worked for Daniel works for me if it worked for Cedric M it works for me the thing is if I can accept this then he's going to come on the scene and says you know this one you always wanted to meet when they say the Rapture is on and there's a a calling away and you're going to meet this I'm going you're going to meet me amen my dad was was so challenged on this I called God I talked to God and he knows I share this testimony a lot I want that phone that when people said I spoke to God I want that phone brother Ben is a witness we've got witnesses here yes sir he says with the sincerity of heart he says I want to talk to that God and a little two-year-old girl girl spoke to him he said God just spoke to me through a 2-year-old girl his very thing that he was looking for God says I'll answer but I won't answer it in your way I'll answer it in my way and when he identified this was God working through a 2-year-old that didn't say one word yeah but spoke the world and changed his life forever change his life forever so you don't need to figure out how the battle's going to go just take the Living God with you speak the word and work forward don't figure it out it's not your job this is not your battle he's the vine you're the branches just reflect what he's telling you don't forget that hallelujah amen the Lord amen that's it that's our service tonight don't forget who's with you but don't forget that you need to do the work he will push you just go fruit fruit fruit fruit amen hallelujah fruit I like fruit my mom called me a fruit fly I love fruit but the thing is now you ask and this is where brother Ed and I had like a juice some people's trials are hard I understand it some people are in offices where God wants to really make them understand the burden of the people underneath them pray for our deacons pray for our pastor these people have different fights than we have here I promise you trust me I know I've seen it I've got one as the best friend I have that knows me the back of his hand cuz he gave me a couple okay but when the trials hit them it gives them a sincere heart for all of us yeah so what they going through they're going through for a reason to understand us you pray for them their battles are bigger ours might not be so big but if it's a big battle don't worry you've got a big God Amen and you just your fruit's just going to be more so your branches may be a bit heavier and a lot more fruit on it but that's fine you're just going to have more fruit on it and if it's heavy to carry just go Lord love it give me more fruit because at the end of the day the fruit is the thing that counts what comes out is what counts it's not that bronze won't break God will not teas you see you don't know what is your line God knows what your line so when we get in a comfortable place we go oh man if this goes wrong more there's my line God goes no hold on hold on hold on hold on Sir n still not hold on hold on hold on there's your line you're still sitting over there thinking oh this is too much he goes no bro you still have to f a whole Army to get there amen this is not your place this is where we starting all right so yes some battles are real some battles are heavy some battles feels like you're just failing all the time great there's the line not here get out of your comfort zone amen you meant to fight Giants you meant to overcome them but let your testimony be God did it because how would God get Glory if every little battle would just go big onone Satan ah I'd beat you depression ah where does God get the glory but when the battle is hot and it looks like you're outnumbered and you're tired and you you on your knees and you're like I had enough God comes yep let's go now we start now we start and you're like oh I don't don't we know just speak it amen may the Lord bless the word and and may it be a blessing to you you can all stand up musicians come forward amen don't don't get discouraged we serve a mighty God if you just if you just know what he can do for you like he really wants to with all inside wants to do it for you but you have to speak it you have to believe it and you have to walk it or else ain't going to come to pass God wants some branches eh so if somebody calls you a branch it's they say you're a branch it's not an insult it's a good thing be fruit bear fruit I wonder Joshy do you have a song for

God has a purpose of you being here if you could only get into that place how much trouble you would save God and yourself amen that's what the prophet said if you can just read realize God has a purpose for you he doesn't make mistakes and you are not a mistake and you're not just here for the fact of being here so if you can realize that in a young age you'll save yourself and God a lot of
