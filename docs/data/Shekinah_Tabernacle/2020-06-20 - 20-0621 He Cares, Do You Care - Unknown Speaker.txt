bless you [Music] well as you all know last year we spent like the first four months of the year praying for me to get a job and then i got a job in may which was a six month contract and when it was four months bef i mean two months before the contract ended i then got an extension so it was supposed to be finishing in may this year and around much the first week of march i had a meeting with my manager's manager's manager and then because he's the one who hired me and told them you're going to work with this person so i said to him it's much my contract is ending in may i don't like to wait until the end should i start applying for a job or is there going to be an extension but then he had moved to another team altogether he said you know what but i know the other team is looking for a business analyst around the same time when your contract is over so i've already given them your name don't look for a job at all you've got a job you covered i said okay thank you then covet 19 hits and my manager says to me did you confirm i said well we had a meeting we spoke it was a verbal agreement he said is it in writing i said no is it going him and then when i went back he said well it was not inviting and we tried to get approval there is no approval therefore there is no job i said okay that's fine no problem he said let's meet before you go there wherever you're going to go i said not a problem and the week when i was finishing up uh he sent me an email just saying goodbyes and all that not a problem then the agency calls me and said you know what your hr has actually just told me that there's two managers who are interested in having you let's just wait and see it's not a good buy yet i said not a problem then eventually attended interviews then they absorbed me but there was no contract it was just everybody they said because you don't have a contract let's give you two weeks extension okay no problem they gave me the two weeks extension when the two expression finished they gave me another two weeks extension in the middle of the two weeks extension we had a meeting where they said okay we are struggling so almost half of the contractors are leaving these are people who have contracts until next year most of them and then their jobs were cut and here am i i've got another two suspension they say no you are staying you're not going anywhere when i looked i could only see god's work because i don't even have a contract and then actually just backtracking a bit in april just when we stayed at home i had prayed and asked the lord to guide me to get a position the same way that he did with this one because i did not apply for this one i got a call to say there is a job so even in april i prayed and said lord i don't want to be out there looking around begging if there's a job for me please let it come through to me so early in april around three people contacted me for one position so i had to give my cv to the one who first came the other two i had to tell them i already gave my cv for the same job and it was quiet all the time when the two extensions were happening so by around the second extension i think so that's when they called me for the interviews i did the interviews and then they called me for the test i did the test everything is happening during lockdown so everything was happening from the house but the way the interviews were going i was not even too sure that they'll be interested because when you're not confident when you are only i just told myself i can only rely on god because it's just too technical and some things you can hear that you're not even to show what you said afterwards then when i wrote the test it was even worse but god just guided me because i'm used to writing tests before a job is offered but somehow i just thought you know as much as the same in america let me just check is the numerical that happening here the same one as the one that i did in south africa then whenever i would check there would be this link that keeps on popping up i said you know what let me just try this one but it was difficult for one i had never seen those and most of them were more accounting based not my normal meds pure mess that i'm used to but then it would keep on coming up i said okay it's fine let me just keep on practicing these ones then when they gave me the samples for the tests it was similar questions to the one that i had been practicing i said lord i can only thank you because i only have about 48 hours to do this and if i had not been practicing them all this time i wouldn't know what to do so when i wrote the test i think it was about 25 questions or so i only managed to do eight and the time was up i said lord just make your way as the submission goes just make your way i don't know what they're going to find there because okay i've written all the other tests the one that is that i couldn't finish is the numerical one which is where i'm supposed to be having the strength that's my strength i love numbers but that was difficult but i just held on to the fact that they said to me you know what we're not looking for the quantity looking for the quality so don't rush to finish just make sure you do everything correct so i said if i wrote only 8 out of 25 i'm not even too sure if i got the 8 correct but hopefully the 7 is correct i left the i was actually surprised when they called me and said you know what you've passed the test i said it can only be got i only wrote eight questions out of 25 and then on the other side it keeps on being two weeks extension studios and nothing is coming up then eventually they said you know what actually your contract was approved a long time ago but it got lost along the way so we're still looking for it i said okay lord here am i i've got a contract that is coming which is even getting lost along the way i've got no clue what's happening and here am i it looks like i'm getting an offer i need you to be the one guiding me because personally i would have obviously preferred a contract because that's where my money is but with the way things are going it doesn't look like there's any certainties one moment you just get told no there's no more contracts anymore so i said look be the one guiding me then on the side of the contract they would give me a task today tomorrow when i'm trying to start they say you know what it's blocked we're going to do it next year try this one just when i get started no actually this one you realize that we don't actually need it we just buy a new solution to resolve this issue so it's solved another task no it's actually blocked then i realized that nothing that i'm trying on the side works so god is answering my prayer that no this is no way this is not the way i want you i want you going this side of a permanent position so i would really just like to thank the lord for guiding me for being the one who is there for me even when i know that i have failed it's not according to my knowledge or my education or anything it can only be him who guided the process all the way and i'm starting a new job on the 8th of july and it is a permanent position so i'm just relieved that it's not the thing that every six months i'm looking for a position i would really like to give honor and lord to the lord thank you amen glory to god amen he loves your faith my sister and you stood upon his word and he's seen you through amen hallelujah and we have another visitor brother marty can you raise your hand for us god bless you god bless you brother good to have you here [Applause] amen so shall we stand and let's just create an atmosphere of worship um before the preacher comes to deliver the word of god amen can you give us a key for

lord amen it's great to have everyone here today i trust you'll feel at home um let's just go to the scripture shall we just uh um just a reminder that we're having church lunch after after service i mean welcome officially welcome to milan's down here amen and they also um yeah so so god bless you all um let's we're just gonna go to first peter five and seven and um let's see if you just open the slideshow there by the caleb it's in the in the list here we are first first peter 5 and 7 we're going to read down to to verse 10 amen casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a roaring lion walketh about seeing whom he may devour whom resisteth us who whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the great god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you i like the last part of that amen to make you perfect to establish to strengthen and to settle you i mean so if you're worried or if you're weak he'll strengthen you if you're worried he'll settle you amen if you're not perfect he'll perfect you amen so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning dear lord jesus we want to thank you we can come into your presence lord as as a as a redeemed people lord we have so much to be thankful for lord that you have washed us lord you you shed your blood upon the earth to redeem us lord to ransom us from the from the cruel clutches of sin and hell and death and the devil lord and i want to thank you lord that we can announce this morning we're a free people and you lord we have been redeemed lord we're not our own lord we are yours we've been bought with a price which is the precious blood of jesus christ and just asking father may you come down into the service lord may your word find beating ground lord in every soul lord to bring forth a hundred fold and lord may you meet every need here oh god father may you come and touch each life touch my life lord lord we all need you lord jesus lord just pray you come take the service under your divine control lord the troubles and the and the worries and the strife maybe we walked in with lord may we not walk out with them father i pray you'd expose the devil in every hand lord may be cast out maybe under our feet lord and may you raise us into heavenly places in christ jesus for your glory lord we commit the service into your hands lord those who are sick and body may touch their bodies make them well lord because we know by your stripes they were healed lord we just want to come by the blood of jesus christ and claim their healing and thank you for it lord those who are troubled in spirit lord you're the comforter lord you're the one who gives peace father those who couldn't make it lord this morning be their portion father as well lord we're just asking these things in your wonderful name and name the lord jesus christ amen and then god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning if i could take a uh title i want to speak about he cares but do you care that's the big thing do you care that's the big thing he cares he's proven he cares but do you care amen because if you care a man you'll get his care yeah and and if i could subtitle this i feel this is just going to go all over the place but we'll end up somewhere you know it's like a guided tour you sometimes why do you go here and why do you go here but there's a purpose i guess i mean so let's just just hold on and let's just you know anyway so and if i can subtitle this i want to ask you the question what does your care produce what kind of atmosphere does it generate because there's certain levels of care you know there's there's there's kind of a very superficial level of care which actually is not care but it appears to be care you know especially with the lockdown i'm sure you saw it going to the supermarket people were kind of keeping distance and following but they really just cared about themselves they weren't friendly you know all the all the friendliness just kind of evaporated somewhere you know everyone was all stressed and worried about things and you know there's no real care and unfortunately in this day and age there is very little real care but he cares for you but do you care that's the question so now i just want to kind of mix in do you care and what kind of atmosphere does it generate and now we know the atmosphere around around a person is produced by what's going on in their spirit realm so what's going on in their heart will produce an atmosphere around them someone who's tense and troubled and worried and full of anxiety it will produce a very tense atmosphere around them someone is very unforgiving and rigid you'll know you know what's going on in them by the atmosphere around them but someone who's loving and kind and thoughtful you'll feel that kind of atmosphere when you come into their presence so so it's really when i say do you care it's really what's in your heart i mean so you know we just want to just just kind of go through these things but you know my question today is you know do we just care enough to look down our nose at people who are in sin or those who are struggling or those who are self-righteous do we just have that kind of care that we just look down our nose at them or do we really care for their souls really care for their struggles and their hardship and what they're going through and you know we want to not just have a outward appearance of caring without really having a heart of care because remember if you care he cares but you've got to care first amen if you really care first he'll care for you i mean so now definition of care uh it's the provision this is just mr google told me so says the provision of what is necessary for the health or the welfare the maintenance and protection of someone or something so that's what care means it's also an object of concern or attention so if you care for something or someone it's an object of concern or attention you're focused on it because you care if you don't care you're not focused on it right so it's just like with the lord you know people can pretend to care they can come to church but it's more than coming to church it's more than reading the bible you know going through a religious motion it's not that it can appear very religious but where's the care because if it's really care if you really care about the lord you love him you want to serve him because he's so wonderful and good then he'll be your object of attention he'll be your object of concern and i'll say if he is your object of concern and attention then his people will sure be your object of care and care and um concern and attention and so will this dying world amen because really his care will manifest in your care i want you to think about it because we don't just want to float in and float out and watch the world go by and come to church and go to church and read and just you know but do you care because it's more than just learning things we're not here this is not a lecture hall this is not a university arena or a school arena or a classroom this is where god comes down this is where our faith can pull them down and say lord i have a needle my brother has a need my sister has a need my children have a need and you create an atmosphere around you and god can come down and meet their need it's more than just me standing here and talking to you i pray god would come in behind it you know i've been thinking very seriously we need to go higher we shouldn't be comfortable you say well we have a great church it's got to be more than just a great church i want a wonderful bunch of people more than that i say oh we all get along it's got to be more than that i mean we need the supernatural god i mean why did what is the cross meant to produce the cross is meant to produce god living in a people that's why he died for you and me not just our sins would be forgiven he said i want to dwell in my children i want to walk in them i want to be their god not that they i don't just want to be with them i want to be in them that's the whole purpose of the message that god would dwell in people holy and that's why we gather that god would dwell in people i mean that's why we raise our children to love the lord that god would dwell in them and that's why we care for one another that god would dwell in one another that's how harsh desires or not i want to see people filled with the holy ghost i have power powerhouse of god walking down the street doesn't matter if you're a mother or a father or a child i mean you're a powerhouse of god this is what this is said to do not just a bunch of rules and regulations you know i got a sub clause 5 b c d e who cares you know it's not just that no it's a relationship this is a love letter but you gotta fall in love with the author and if you fall in love with the author i mean you'll show you really care then he'll care for you but the question is do you care you know what's going to happen to some people they'll float in they'll float out others will take a rapture they'll keep floating and they'll realize it's been too late we don't just want to float be caught up in a church culture and you know say the right things and dress the right way and just conform without knowing him because we've missed the whole point we don't want to miss the point knowing him is getting the point but it's really is see don't look at your struggles we all have struggles and trouble but do you care see it's not him that falls it's him that gets back up because if you really care you'll get back up say lord i fail i've sinned i've done wrong but lord try me one more time i want to get up and walk with you that shows you care amen so don't look at your failures and how many times you fall on them just get back up say lord here i am amen it's like a boxing ring yo yo it's like fighting the devil in a boxing room just keep getting back up well he really just floored me with that one get back up i'm still here devil i'm walking with jesus i'm in respect of what's going on so don't get bowed down by oh you know we all fail we're human newsflash you're human you know but god is divine amen hallelujah and he gives us overcoming power remember it's not that him that wins the you know it's not him that wins the battle it's him that wins the war napoleon won a lot of battles but he lost the war he ended up he ended up on some island there in the middle of the atlantic wherever it was a failure because he lost the war i mean you take anyone you know great great people if they if they lose the war who cares about all the battles they won oh what about this and this no no but you lost the you lost the war we may lose battles we might be absolute you know wreckage but if you win the war amen amen hell louise we want to win the war don't we amen says the kind of atmosphere around us is produced by what's going on in our spirit many times people have issues they open a door and the devil comes in and just takes them on a crazy ride and if they just expose the devil for what he was doing then they'd be free i mean remember it's not it's not us that you know causes all the trouble necessarily it's him but if we just you know sympathize you know people sympathize with spirits and they try and you know now we're going to stand on the word of god say hold on hold on this is not you this is not this is not your care this is the devil trying to rob you or something i just exposed the devil you know i was thinking what would we what would happen if we came into this place prayed up under expectation confess all our sins to god not just you know and i'm not saying you don't do that but what if we really came with an expectation with a greater expectation amen we want to think about it now here here is um here is the account of the two uh the the pharisee and the public and going into the temple to pray it's amazing jesus all of his all of his um a lot of his parables is on relationship it goes beyond the outward appearance because he's really uh you know god became a man to ask the world do you care i care here i am i've proven i'm caring but do you and the pharisees before jesus came you'd say they really care about god they study the word they do all these things they outwardly they pray and they they do these great religious acts but when god came down they actually their lives proved they didn't care they cared about their religion but not about the lord himself so the one that they claimed to be worshipping they actually proved they didn't care because they crucified him we don't want to be those kind of people we don't want to fit into that kind of bracket i mean we want to say when god is manifested we say we care holy and because we care he cares and and manifests himself so so the parables many of them to me they reach down to the heart of people amen and he spake this parable under certain which trusted in themselves that that they were religious and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee the other republican the pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i'm not as other men are extortion unjust adulterers or even as the republican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and republican standing afar off would not lift up so much as eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breasts saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted so this pharisee cared about him it was all about him he he didn't go to the temple to worship god he went to worship himself look at what i can do look what i can achieve he didn't care but the lord cared about this publican and he went away justified so we want to go away like that i mean if we're really honest with god god is honest with us you know when you really mean business and it goes beyond what other people will think of you and you really get honest with god that's when god can come upon the scene for you amen brother brahman listen uh he cares do you care when he was here on earth as i say he cared for the people so much till he healed their sick he comforted their hearts told them about a place where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them and notice he cared so much until when he knowed he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll send the holy spirit and he shall can he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's there's no one cares like jesus knowing that his body is a high priest in a meditorial work that he's doing now that body must be in the prince of god at all times for intercession that god cannot see the sin of sin he sees only the blood of his own son aren't you glad about that and knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care certainly he cares now he was to continue to care for the people his people here on earth in the same manner that he cared for them when he was here amen he says he made this directly sure i'll he will speak in my name the works that i will that that i do will you do also when he's upon you speaking about the holy ghost see he could comfort in the same way by forgiving all our sins healing all our sickness speaking to us of comfort of a kingdom that is to come see proving himself among us as god proves himself among us by jesus christ first timothy 3 16 is written this way we know about god without controversy we realize that great is a mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh we saw god in flesh that was god's comfort to know that he come so much he cared for us until he became one of us god manifested in the flesh not just another person but god himself and now to make it another step closer he sends the holy spirit to care for our comforts he abides in us oh he does care amen he cared so much for us he became one of us i mean to take our sin upon himself i mean he cares he cares for the child he cares for the elderly cares for the parent who cares for the teenager he cares for all of us but the question is do you do you care this is an age of of not caring speaking of our age it would say of of the age we live in i know thy works thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot i'll spew the out of my mouth so what does he mean just so so you're not religiously just ice cold you're not on fire for him just kind of lukewarm just a little bit of religion here and there just you know a little bit of tepidness you know in between but god says i wish you either hot or cold because the lukewarm they can justify themselves but those who are called when i came to the lord i was lost as lost as lost could be out in the world i knew i was lost when i heard the message i had no defense i knew i didn't know him i was just honest lord i don't know you i'm lost i am i'm dead and trespassed and says lord help me i cared when i heard his word and he cared for me hallelujah but i so i had no luke warmness no kind of a bit of religion to just justify well i'm a good person i'm a christian editor i even thought i was a good person and the lord gave me a dream of a of a young man my age and he was trying to you know you know he's on a beach with a little boat he tried to push it out of the sand into the water to travel somewhere i know i've told this many times i'll tell it one more time maybe as i get older i'll tell it more you know and then but then he couldn't get the boat to move and then these couple of brothers from her family were walking down the beach and they tried to help him to get at the budget just wouldn't move so they said to him just come live with us so he went and lived with them they had a sister he married the sister then he had children then they had great grandchildren now he's an old man he's walking down the street one night it's raining he goes to cross the road slips over cracks the the back of his head on the pavement and he's dying and in my dream i'm looking down on him blood's coming out the back of his head and he says to himself i've lived a good life then he turned from a normal looking old man to a very evil looking person and all these scenes of violence real rapidly throughout his life then there was a globe and people like him walking out upon it like his descendants i don't normally have dreams like that by the way but i woke up and and the lord said to me now he thought he was good what about you so even in my rank state i was justifying but i'm a good person because i never killed anyone never shot anyone never robbed anyone didn't end up in prison but no no god kid i had no that was my defense it just evaporated because we're all riding our own eyes but i didn't have any lukewarmness to any religion to to to hide behind that's why god says i wish you are the hot or cold amen because i can work with that amen so help us lord now now now notice here verse 17 because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing this is the condition of of this world even even when i was in papua new guinea a few times ago you know i heard a uh it was a pentecostal church of you know a uh preacher was preaching from this verse he says look we're rich in christ with goods and in our eyes we'd say no they're not but relative them relatively to where they've come from to where they are they are right so this is around the whole world it doesn't matter if it's in this world or a developing world whatever but it says i have need of nothing if you don't need anything you don't have a lot of care right you're not worried about people caring for you or what you're careful because i'm content right we don't want to be caught up in this kind of spirit i don't really need the lord i i what do you mean i i i come to church i read the bible i go through the you know but but you know have need of nothing we have to go beyond this we can't never ever get into this kind of bracket that you don't need him i mean it doesn't matter how long you've been walking with him i mean i just i i needed more today than i when i first started the journey i needed more every day to direct my steps and guard my tongue and help me lord of everything i do i need him more now amen hallelujah but you know so i pray we never come to this state we need him amen just like sheep doesn't matter how old the sheep gets still needs a shepherd it can be the oldest ram in the herd but it still needs a still need a shepherd amen we still need a shepherd amen so because of this though there's not real a lot of genuine care he says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire what's gold tried in the fire this deity that's proven that's a revelation that's proven amen that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that's the righteousness of saints that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see amen i'm glad we can get eyes out we can see that we're not just everything's fine and dandy everything's going good no we can we actually see our spiritual condition amen we can see even if we're saved we can still see it and when given praise lord you you save me you redeem me be washed in your blood i'm a new creature hey we've got something to shout about hallelujah as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent you want to be zealous in this hour it's it's repentance behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me so if you really care he's going to come in you're going to have fellowship hallelujah amen but we know the uh another problem in this age we live in is because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold so because iniquities are bounded in this age i mean the love of many will wax cold but so if love if if love goes cold care goes down amen but the lord has given us the holy ghost that we don't become like this i mean because the love and the care that we have is not a human love and care because human love and care is based on how you treat me right but divine love and care is not how you treat me amen is what god has done for me it's how i'll treat you hallelujah so this is what we gotta lord help us i mean i like this we're reading we uh you know we're reading through the book of corinthians as a family he says i beseech you brethren that you know the household of stiffness which is the first fruits of acacia and they that have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints i like that word they've addicted themselves to the minister saying so they've been consumed it's been driving you see someone who's an addict they can be you know an alcoholic or a smoker or whatever a gamer whatever it may be a sports fiend whatever it may be they're addicted to the thing because the spirit of them is driving them to feed off that thing baby you become addicted you know people will you know you know people leave university because they get caught up in online gaming because they they actually they actually ruin their future basically just to play a game amen people do it you know why because they become addicted so the desire the thirst they have for the game or whatever you know actually becomes first place in their life and everything takes secondary place amen but these ones addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints i'll say the reason they did it is not that they'd get brownie points this is not this is not brownie point country this is not about brownie points you know we're not gonna walk up into heaven with a bunch of merit badges look what i did no it's lord look what you did i mean he's the one with the merit badges because because he purchased our salvation he washes white as snow when we were his enemies he reconciled us back to god hallelujah so he's the one with the browning points i'm glad it's that way otherwise it'd be a lot of pressure on me to perform and you know who would fail that'd be me so you know i'm glad it's not the pressure's not on me the pressure's on him but if your cares upon him he'll care for you amen to these ones they addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints why because they cared they cared they cared for the people's welfare i mean if they're hungry they fed them if they were troubled in spirit they'd pray with them they would you know they were they were addicted consumed and they could i believe they couldn't help but it was just their nature yeah god comes and it just changes your nature i mean it's not selfish anymore we're not worried about your problems you worry about other people's problems amen because you care hallelujah this is not a self-centered gospel right the only one that's centered around is our lord jesus christ amen but he they they addicted themselves to the ministry of saints i i pray lord in an age of self-help and youtube and everything you can do for yourself let's let's do the opposite amen you know i always preach to myself too you know you guys just maybe i'm just talking to myself and you guys are here anyway you know but we can have a greater walk we can have a greater experience individually and collectively we can have a far greater experience in the lord than we do have now why should we plateau and get comfortable i say let's let's let's go beyond the comfort zone you say i'm not comfortable doing those things the first time you do anything you're not comfortable right but then it gets it becomes a habit you get used to it hallelujah let's burst the bubble you know i'm born in july so my star sign is cancer now there is some truth to the zodiac because you see certain people born certain months of certain characteristics so i'm a crab very comfortable likes this little shell you know likes just to have his nest or as whatever they have i don't know and you're you know in the rock pool and anyway that's my nature right but the lord but the thing is you know even in your conversion god uses your nature for good there's good and bad for every nature just because okay july is the best month let's just let's just clear that right now you know i'm sorry for everyone else but you know that's all right you know it's peak is july over yeah i'm glad i got my ambient corner anyway you know no but but there's good you know one personality doesn't have an easier ride to heaven than the other right there's good and bad to all personalities and the lord wasn't surprised when you were born he wanted you with a certain nature and he wanted to use that nature for the kingdom of god i mean so you know but so i have to be but i have to be very aware that i'm a bit of a crab right one person didn't say big loud amen right there that's fine i'm glad anyway that was a silent amen but you know you've got to be aware of your weaknesses and your strengths right you got to be aware of you know because by the way i'm saying you know that yo you've got a weak point and you've got to keep it covered right you've got to keep it constantly covered by prayer otherwise the devil can get you in that weak point amen so lord help us that we're not walking around with a bunch of blinders on blinkers on and the devil just just flanks us and takes us out and we say well how did that happen you know we need to be aware of these things but it's the lord that will show us so don't become all paranoid and what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong no just walk with the lord and love him and he'll show you in his time amen you just keep your focus on the right thing amen you keep your focus on yourself well i'm sorry that won't end up all that happy amen he cares do you care you say this is very elementary today he preaches after the seals opened so i think it's good this just struck me so here i am yo i can't help but i listen something anchors in my heart can't get rid of it you know you've got to get it out of your system so i'm just going to i you know i listened to this this week i got to get it out of my system you know so please just bear with me anyway who cares do you care he said he also cared for them to bring them out this is speaking of them coming out of egypt and he cared for them in the journey after they came out amen as they were in the physical this is the in the spiritual realm he cared why he provided everything they had we are yes he provided everything they had need of while they were in the journey did he he healed them when they were sick he provided healing he provided a way for their sickness he provided a bra serpent what they could look upon that bra serpent a symbol of sin and be healed he fed them while they were in the way where there was no bread he rained bread out of heaven he fed them not only that but he clothed them showing he cares for those who care amen they were they were here here's a picture of them and you know this is their condition they are in but there were there were people in that condition that they were praying we had um let's just go back let's just blank this out could we blank it out of it anyway they were in this condition they were slaves but there came a time when the word of god was going to be fulfilled and brother brown dramatizes about moses's parents and they were slaves in the field but some of them begin to care see some just got used to life while we're slaves is our portion well yes there's a promised land to go to but at some time and you know you know and they just got acclimatized they adjusted to being slaves we don't want to be adjusting anything the devil put on us right we don't want to adjust well i just you know we need wisdom and some things but in terms of being under a spiritual oppression and being bowed down and the devil telling us we're never going to make it we're never going to be christians you're never forgiven and you know you just can't overcome you're going to withstand that thing right you don't withstand there was some there that really cared because the word of god was about to be fulfilled and moses parents brother brown just dramatized it to make it a bit more real he says that amram which was moses dad he would he would come home from the fields after being beaten and whipped and hungry and whatever he'd go up into the roof of his house and call out to jehovah god and say oh god when are you going to send this deliverer oh god when are we going to leave this egypt when are we going to go to the promised land lord it's nearly 400 years amen the promise was four hundred years we've been here but he's gonna take us out almighty jehovah god the god of our fathers abraham isaac and jacob the god of joseph i mean where are you in this time of need he began to care because the word of god was about to be fulfilled and he began to call out god when are you going to fulfill the word in my life hallelujah because he cared and then eventually you know his wife said to him we're tired we've been slaves you know why do you have to do all the praying when he is let someone else pray but he had a burden see he had a bird well what if no one else prays and then eventually the angel lord came and said deliver us coming hallelujah why because he cared about the word of god being fulfilled right and because he genuinely cared about the word being fulfilled then god showed his care to abram and it's the same thing with us see it's more than just caring about you know our house or our job our education all those things we should care about you but the genuine care amen is god's word being fulfilled right if you have a genuine care lord i want to see your work manifested in my life i mean i don't just want to complain and worry about things but lord i want to see you live i mean i care lord i care i want to see you manifested i want to see you more than a story more than history i want to see this word become flesh hallelujah and he cared amen we can we can turn that back on i just want to put okay david cared about god here's a man after god's own heart and he came to a stage in his life where he had he was no longer a future he was no longer fighting a war you know but finally he was king over israel and he any any and he had his palace but his care was always about god man after god's own heart and then he would he would sit there in his house and he would speak to the prophet nathan and said and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest around about all his enemies that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains see it seemed that god had you know god had blessed him he was now king he had a palace all these things but his care was for the ark of the lord because to him that was the greatest thing in his kingdom it wasn't his palace it wasn't his armies it wasn't his mighty men but it was the presence of god in the nation that's what he cared about remember he was a man after god's own heart and he didn't want to be sitting in a big fancy palace where where where the ark of god will just was just dwelling in a tent it didn't seem right for him because because to the human eye people would say well david thinks he's better than the ark because look why is the ark in this tent and he's in this palace and so he wanted he wanted the people to know this is my care this is this is how i esteem god more than just a errand boy sometimes we make god an errand boy god do this and heal this one and fix this and help me here and do it and you give him a list you give him a to-do list but he's god amen that's not that's not real care that's just using him for his own you know for your own ends what about genuine care lord come live come make your abode i want to feel your presence around me i want you close i want you dwelling here i don't just want to talk about you i want to feel your presence and i want to worship you i want to create an atmosphere and i want to give you glory because you're so worthy oh i want to praise your name and hallelujah david was that kind of man amen and he would he would he would say this because he had a care because he knew that the lord dwelt between the cherubims beloved um above the mercy seat on that ark see it's the i'm just gonna i'm gonna jump forward and jump back a bit now the same care the same care came to solomon because remember god actually told um god actually told david because he's a man of war he couldn't build the temple but he would have a son who would be a man of peace and he will build that temple so now this care was now transferred down to solomon and because that because i believe the care that that david had for for god so impacted solomon's life amen david wasn't a man just to go through the motions his heart was lord i love you as a deer painter for the water brook so my soul longs after thee i want to dwell in the house of the lord forever he was an unusual man i mean but he had a heart for god god i want to be where you are i don't want to see you a far off lord you know you call out to god and have a genuine hunger and this i believe so impressed his son oh boy you think about the kind of influence we can have on someone i mean where they can see that your heart is more than you know it's more than just having a religion but they see the love you have for god the care you have for him and it can so inspire them and so now solomon came to this place where where where he was instructed that he would build this temple that his father wanted to build hallelujah amen he had a care now to me imagine this moment let's just go back there the temple's built it's time for the dedication they're going to bring the arkhan the burden of david had become the burden of solomon and now it had become material it was more than just plans on paper or parchment now it was manifested and here they would have been on that morning they were under expectation i believe they didn't know what was necessary going to happen they didn't know what would happen when the ark went into the holy of holies they didn't know but they had an expectation the same god that gave the blueprint as the same god here today and no doubt solomon would instruct the singers now you know wash yourselves be prepared be sanctified to the levites and think this is an important day we're going to have church today we're going to have church today like we never had it before i mean we're going to have a worship like we've never had it before and the musicians were all ready and they were all in their places and the people were ready and solomon was there and you know it's amazing we have here you know these these people here you can't quite see it they're they're prostrate on the ground you know here's the trumpeters and the you know you know the ones on the symbols and there and they're playing and they're ready and they're blowing their trumpets and then finally but here comes the arkhan now what is going to happen when this goes in is going to be a direct result of the hearts of these people amen it's not how shiny the symbols are it's not how clean the whatever whatever is it's not how clean their clothes are it's not how well they sing it's their hearts do they care do they care that their god gets the worship he deserves amen because remember they he brought them out of a mighty long way in the wilderness he brought them out of great affliction great trouble great strife many enemies round about them i mean they were it was it was nearly a you know a very close-run thing will they survive as a nation will they continue on and god brought them through and it's the same thing with you and i many times you say lord how are we ever going to survive this how am i ever going to get through this i've got my enemies round about with the devil's on my case what's going to happen i mean then god comes down i mean because you care for him he cares for you hallelujah and then you get through those mighty long ways in the world as you come into the land of the word hallelujah and you begin to see your enemies are come under your feet hallelujah those spirits of which ward against you now are under your feet hallelujah then and then what happens hallelujah brother jesus hallelujah so it's all now this what happens now is based on the hearts of them not on what you see on the outside that's why we could have the greatest church the perfect acoustics the the the greatest uh sound uh equipment known to man it could be perfect perfect the the greatest musicians known to man that have ever stood on two feet upon the earth we're going to have them right here the greatest singers everything but if the heart of the people if the heart of the people is not prepared if the heart of the people does not care for god it can just be a great performance but yet outwardly it could go so well we could have the most perfect preacher that doesn't stutter and and spit and slobber and jump around and whatever you know the most eloquent speech but if the heart of the people is not ready i mean we could have the most perfect families in the world but if the heart of the parents of the heart of the children amen is not prepared amen if their hearts weren't ready that would have gone in there and it just would have been it but because the heart of people were caring here comes our god we built him a house because he wanted him because he because in our human mind this is what he deserved i mean not to be intense but to be in the highest place i mean to be the most focal point of the city is the temple of god amen they and they and they took the ark in hallelujah brother andy mentioned this on wednesday then then the lord came down after the priest came out of the holy of holies aiming up they dropped the ark off and the lord came down and the ministers couldn't even minister because the lord filled the temple and then he filled the temple then he went on to the outer court hallelujah he went out there all over the prince of god amen and i say this this morning what if we came the same kind of way i mean we don't live under the blood of bulls and goats we live under the blood of jesus christ i mean we are a new creation i mean we are not like them i mean we live in a greater reality than they ever had i mean so what if we came to church oh amen prayed up not not we need to get right here we're already right i mean we've confessed all our faults to god amen we've poured out our heart said lord forgive me of my sins and we've made everything right hallelujah i mean there we come an expectation oh boy we'd have a different service we'd have a different service and then the devil says well he's just trying to talk it up no no no no we'd have a different service amen but we've had church for years and for years and for years it doesn't have to stay the same amen amen i challenge you this morning we can have even even family alters we can go through a motion and we can read and we can pray and no i want more than that i want god to come down hallelujah it should be remember we're a supernatural people we offer a supernatural praise supernatural worship hallelujah amen how we come to church could save someone else's life how we come our attitude when we come sure the devil fights us we're not immune from that we can't be removed from the devil of devil's attacks but how we you know you want to resist it says the devil's against you draw nigh to god resist the devil and he shall flee so it's not just standing saying i resist you know draw nigh to god call out to your source of strength amen our own human mind is not our source of strength i mean a nice just a quote or something on the fridge is not just our source of strength god is our source of strength and his word is our source of strength hallelujah amen draw night to him resist the devil and he shall no the devil shall flee hallelujah amen what kind of where have i have i been pushing buttons yeah i have think about it what could we have oh we've had great times before that was in the past we can have greater we're gonna have greater right now amen right now remember the burden now comes upon he cares but do you care i mean when you get the burden lord i care right now not someone else caring what about me what about me why not you as brother christopher says why not now hallelujah it should be the burden of our heart not just to carry on go through the motions but lord you live the tomb's empty i can still go there and see an empty tomb i mean i can still see the tomb is still empty the stone is still rolled away god is alive forevermore i mean he's not just to be a god that lived in the book of acts and he's gone someplace oh no he's the same god today he's the same god right now hallelujah i mean we're going to just push the push the devil back he said well i've had too many disappointments who cares about disappointments i mean the allies in world war ii had a lot of disappointments but they won i mean even even the coalition against napoleon had a lot of disappointments but they won it's they that win the war amen never wasted good failure what do you mean by that if you fail you don't just continue on the same way that caused you to foul say lord how do i why did i end up this way show me something because he wants to teach you amen but it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at pentecost they had to go up in an upper room and pray until the holy ghost come because they got in one place and one accord let's get in one place and one accord who wants to see a rapture who wants to see all of us there who want to see our children there who want to see god come down who wants to see people receive the holy ghost they want to see hearts mended because their lives change forever i mean that's one accord that's one heart lord we want to see you live lord burn out all the unforgiveness burn out all the unbelief lord forgive us all our wrongs and our sins lord come down among us change our lives hallelujah that's what we want don't don't we want this place to be empty when the rapture comes hallelujah hallelujah all of us where'd they all go oh no they're just as a bed we're up in glory hallelujah that's that's that should be the thrust of our life why because we're addicted to the ministry of the saints and we become addicted to it hallelujah say well i can't feed people i can't do this but you can pray i mean you can call out to god lift people up before the throne of god call upon god say lord help this one help this one doesn't matter who they are lord change their lives get a hold of them amen i challenge you to do it remember we live in an instant age god is not always instant amen hallelujah amen why are you putting this on us because i believe we can do it because i believe god is here to enable us to do it remember he doesn't put something on the people and say now you figure it out now you do it in your own energy no it's god's energy let god energize the branch bring forth the fruit amen because they see it's the atmosphere that brings results you believe it let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the lord jesus i mean to anything that's not the lord jesus right now kick it out i've got a lot of things to do tomorrow who cares tomorrow will take care of itself there's a lot of to-do list don't worry about the to-do list the to-do list is the lord jesus christ the to-do list is loving him hallelujah isn't he lovely let's just let's just really take stock i was lost and undone in the world who was there who remember being there didn't know him maybe knew about him maybe raised in church he wasn't real maybe some other people shout and cry and you think what's wrong with those people it just it's just embarrassing but one day but one day because he knew deep down you really cared and it went beyond your mind but he knew down in your soul you really cared then he began to brood over you he began to call you you were gonna get stirred up and you realize there's more to life there's more to the god than what i have experienced and you had a hunger and you had a longing oh leah remember remember those who are you know we can't help people pray through you've got to pray through you've got to seek god people have a burden even for years but they're keeping that burden they keep praying they keep seeking him that seeketh findeth him that knocketh not just knock hello no i'm not knocker let me in lord let me in lord of y'all you're calling me help me oh god remember he put that desire in you not to make you miserable but to bring you all the way in that's why god calls it a heart not just to make you miserable and just be convicted no god wants to bring you all the way in that's why it gives you the burning desire him that seeketh findeth keep looking amen but then eventually somehow not by your own ability when you got i remember i got to the end of myself you'd go i'm doing well and then crash and burn and you do well again it's like a roller coaster and you knew you just go down and up and down and up and then you just get sick of it lord i can't do this why because because you wonder because remember you know humans are always like well what can i do what can i do and that's the problem words go what can i do and god's like no no what have i done what have i done and and then you've got to come to say lord it's not what i can do it's what you have done and then when you just take him at what he has done then he takes you then he breaks that cycle hallelujah do you remember being in that cycle remember being in that cycle and then god pulled you out of that cycle you don't necessarily know how he did it but he did even if you didn't realize you needed more but you needed more and god found you there if we just kept those things on our minds he brought me out of the my reclaim he set my feet on the rock to stay hallelujah did he not i was nearing despair when he came to me there he told me i could be free he lifted my feet gave me glory complete when he reached down his hand for me hallelujah you say there's just a bunch of emotion this is not emotion emotion comes and goes but this endureth forever get everything from our minds but the lord jesus and believe that he's standing right present now his word says where two or three gathered in my name there i am in the midst so he's between me and you sister hannah's between me and your sister maggie between you and you and you he's right here if we were just conscious of his presence many times we're conscious of everything but his presence it's too hot it's too cold it's too loud it's too quiet let's do this you know forget it if we were conscious of his presence he's standing here right now brother says you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning that's right it's atmosphere i i don't believe in joking from the pulpit because the pulpits no place to joke it's a sacred place i'm quoting something and after this here mr bosworth had a very good sense of humor and he said brother branham to prove that its atmosphere said you could take a hen egg and put it under a puppy and tie him down and it will hatch a chicken see it's the warmth of the puppy's body that would hatch the chicken it doesn't have to be under the hand it could be under the puppy it could be in an incubator it's the atmosphere that's why when we come or even when you pray or you know in your own time or family prayer time whatever you do i trust you do it or you come to church you have an atmosphere of faith non-atmosphere of problems we all have problems but your faith will produce the results it's not your problem it's your faith right so we must come to him believing that he is and he's here to meet our needs and he's so wonderful and he's so good and he cares he cares for us in all of our situations all of our problems he cares hey man sophia yo he cares if we're happy if we're sad if we're troubled if we're not he cares i mentioned create an atmosphere of faith you say well we're going through this honey but i believe he's going to get us out we're going through trouble but i believe he's going to get us out of this sure the children may be doing this but i believe the lord's going to bring them back believe on the lord jesus christ for your children amen i mean so the same faith you have for yourself have for them don't look at what they're doing say no lord i claim that i believe lord you save me the same faith now i'm applying on them and i'm lifting them up before your throne saying oh god you saved me now go save them amen i i release your holy spirit upon their lives that you'll go and get them hallelujah and you lift them up before the throne it works yes i'm too discouraged no no you just look at god see the devil wants you to look at failure but look at the promise i mean the devil wants you to look at your disappointments and maybe what appears to be wrong look at the promise of god don't look at nothing else when jesus said only believe he didn't say only believe and look at the problems he said only believe so that means all you bring into consideration is your faith that he has done it amen all things are possible to them that believe only belief what are you believing in the finished work of calvary amen if the same blood washed you to wash them the same holy ghost called you to call them amen you'll be steadfast in the faith lord and if god doesn't answer your prayer he's obligated to give you an answer why not on the day of judgment amen he always answers prayer [Music] only belief it's faith that'll do it not human reasoning now you've got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it they were all in the upper room with one accord when suddenly there came from heaven as a sound of a rushing mighty wind the atmosphere was right it takes an atmosphere to do anything you know the regular procedure to hatch chickens is to put them under the hen but get the egg in the right atmosphere it will produce anyhow listen brother if god love if a man loves god and the right kind of an atmosphere he could get into it'll produce a newborn babe just as certain as i am here remember it's the atmosphere you create it's not necessarily oh now they're behaving now everything's gonna be just right no no no it's the atmosphere you create right remember this is not oh well these people are gonna get right then something will happen no no what about you it's the individual right it's the individual amen brother abraham says that two or three real consecrated people in a church will do more for that church than 40 revivals amen says not necessarily oh these people are doing this this is this what about us what about the individual amen who wants more than 40 revivals worth of good i say lord use me take me lord sanctify me lord for for other people's sakes not for me but for others hallelujah amen all things are possible to them that believe we're gonna have a season of a great jubilee amen amen if you're ready to confess and repent and believe and accept god cares but you've got to care first you've got to accept what he sent you you'll accept the holy ghost that he sent you he so cared for them that they'd be sure that there would be no mistake he vindicated his prophet by a sign of a pillar of fire and let the people see that it wasn't just this man walking along here that's what this message is not just a man preaching god came down and proved himself hallelujah allah that it was god right above him he was the one that was leading the way god cares for people who cares god cares for those who care for him amen amen let's just take a couple of people that cared i've already spoken about moses parents they cared that the word of god would be fulfilled amen and god cared for them god god sent into their own house the one that would be the deliverer amen rahab cared rahab cared for her own salvation and her own family and then when she knew jericho was under judgment they all knew that they were doomed but she cared she can't say lord there must be salvation in this judgment time i mean she cared not just for herself but for her family and she got what she needed because she cared i mean god cared for her amen one day shamgar was there in israel and the philistines were marching up and down his land and taking his crops and but one day he got enough care one day when he looked into the eyes of his of his family and they were already skinny and gaunt and the harvest had just been brought in they were going to face another winter and and then he heard the stomp of the philistines coming up the road he began to get the right kind of care and he saw the plight of his family he wasn't worried about himself i mean he's worried about the plight of his family and he began to recognize that he was a circumcised son of abraham i mean dwelling in his land hallelujah he began to recognize that and he got enough care that god cared i mean god anointed his life he killed 600 uh armed soldiers i mean why because he cared how many kid god you gave us this land you gave us this land this is your word being fulfilled i'm i'm a circumcised son of abraham i'm dwelling in my land lord i care god says i care for you sham god jumped out there with an ox god and killed 600 men hallelujah i mean when we when we look into the eyes of our children of our family our brothers and sisters and we see their plight even if they may not think they're in anything of any kind of hardship spiritually i mean but you see their need amen they say lord i care for them i'm addicted to the welfare of them hallelujah everything god will come down and show us he cares amen but you have to care first hallelujah the centurion kid he cared for his servant who was sick and nearly dying he went to the source of all health because he cared he put his care into action amen he put his care he didn't just you know console him and and feel sorry for him no no he manifested his care he went himself he went to the lord jesus and say i have a sick servant and jesus said okay i'll come i'll come pray for him he said no i'm not worthy you come under my roof but i'm a man of authority you know i tell me to go here and do this they go here and do that just like you're a man of authority as well and jesus marveled i haven't seen a faith like this in israel but because the centurion cared jesus cared and that was gentile faith that the centurion understood by jesus speaking a word was exactly the same with him physically going into the room laying hands on his sick servant amen and god has sent his word into this age hallelujah he sent his word to this age amen and we must recognize that he is present just as if he is physically present now amen in his corporal body the same one that walk the shoulder of galilee is the same god today i mean he can heal the same way he can deliver the same way he can set free the same way he can pardon the same way i mean because the same god is still walking on the earth today highly why because he sent his word upon the earth and him and his word are one see hallelujah so the centurion cared and jesus cared darius cared for his daughter sure he was a he was high up in the synagogue and they had already told everyone if you go if you guys see this jesus of nazareth you'll be excommunicated from the synagogue but then he and then so finally he's trying to keep his station among the people but then he realized what he really cared about was his daughter and sometimes god's got to get us into a place where we really got to show our colors do we care about what people think of what god thinks and he saw the plight of his daughter and he knew that there was a god of of history that it was now walking upon the earth again so he put on his preacher's kindness hat and he went out to where jesus was fell down at his feet said master my my daughter's sick he cared he went to the right source of care hallelujah and then even though when jesus was coming back with him to the house and then and a servant came and said don't trouble him no more she's dead and sometimes god will take us beyond our care because he was just expecting her to get well but now she was dead but now the great carer stepped into the house they were all crying and things he cast them all out went and just spoke to her she arose all because jarius amen cared about the welfare of his daughter hallelujah blind bartimaeus scared hallelujah he had heard about a god of history but then he realized that god of firster is now walking in front of him holy and because he really cared jesus cared amen amen now what about you and i do we really care amen do we really care or do we just care enough because we worry about what other people think about us in the church or do we really care if we really care then he will care jesus would say the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had brought found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it why because his care rested upon the right one amen it wasn't just attack on of his life it was his entire collection was now that one pearl why because he cared is this message just to tack on to your life something you just connect on or do you really care because it's very easy to just have attack on religion and outwardly look right but where's god living god cares for those who care first amen so it's the same thing with you and i he cares for us i'm just going to leave it there as i said we end up here we go this way and we end up over here somewhere but i want to leave you the same i want to leave you with the question that i started with he cares but do you really care about his word is his word the most important thing to you in your life is it really the most important thing or is just a tack on to make you feel good because you've ticked the religious box or is it the most important is it the central thing of your life because if you really care i mean then he really cares amen let's have the musicians come please don't come forward he careth for you through sunshine or shadow are you glad he cares yes he cares for us gotta say lord i care when i heard that i was driving home you know and all week is my heart to me lord i care i care lord i care i prayed the lord would take this chopped up bitter words and by his holy ghost you'd really think do i care i want him to care for me but do you care for him it's not one-way traffic you've got to care first then he'll care for you [Music] amen let's let's stand shall we let's sing that song he careth for you [Music] you gotta care first [Music] hey man let's let's look at that shall [Music] we careth for
