[8:20] the the reign of your spirit bring it to
[8:22] life, Father. Lord, I pray you'd touch
[8:24] every life here, Lord God. May you move
[8:26] in our midst, Lord Jesus. I pray, dear
[8:28] God, when you come down into our into

[8:38] control, Lord. We surrender all that we
[8:41] are into your hands, Lord. That you'd

[8:47] and our wrongs. Cleanse us of our secret
[8:49] faults and iniquities. Lord, cover us in

[9:20] [Music]
[9:25] Praise the Lord. Good evening.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; You can just have your seats for uh a
[9:31] minute. I just want to say something
[9:32] real quick. So, there's a a should I
[9:36] call him a young man?
[9:38] There's a young man in the back called
[9:40] Raymond.
[9:41] He's just sorry to put you on the spot,
[9:43] bro, but just stand up for a second.
[9:45] This is Raymond.
[9:52] So,
[9:55] so I tell you a little story. We Raymond
[9:57] is about similar age to me,
[10:00] hence the young man thing.
[10:02] [Music]
[10:02] [Laughter]
[10:05] I grew up in a small um tiny little
[10:08] country school about an hour south of
[10:11] Oakland towards the like out just out in
[10:13] the country out in the coast. And um we
[10:16] would have these like a Huntley
[10:18] district. So the quite a big district
[10:20] would get together and have big sports
[10:21] days and um one of them was like a big
[10:23] cross country race that we would do and
[10:26] all the schools around the district will
[10:28] come to this one particular year it was
[10:29] at our country school. So there were
[10:31] hundreds of kids all from the
[10:32] surrounding districts and we would have
[10:34] this big cross country race. Um and
[10:38] funny thing was Raymond was there at the
[10:41] cross country race. Now that particular
[10:43] race that day was won by um
[10:51] so that day I was the victor. Okay. But
[10:54] I was talking to Raymond out here and he
[10:56] said I'm victorious.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:01] And this weekend in Christ, Raymond is
[11:03] victorious.
[11:05] [Applause]
[11:05] [Music]
[11:10] [Music]
[11:12] &gt;&gt; And we are victorious.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; So, let's stand tonight and
[11:17] just worship the Lord. We're in for a
[11:18] good time tonight.

[15:55] have been there
[15:57] when he s my soul.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; You would have been there
[16:04] on the road.

[24:37] I wonderful.
[24:39] [Music]
[24:41] Does he see me in my trouble? Does he
[24:45] understand?
[24:48] Sometimes I question if he's able.
[24:52] Can he rescue? Can he save me? Again and
[24:56] again.
[24:58] But when I look back,
[25:02] did he move every mountain? Did he part
[25:06] every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.
[25:13] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[25:16] deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.
[25:23] Oh, yes, he did.
[25:26] So yes, he can.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes those voices try to tell me
[25:34] I'm forgotten and I'm falling too far
[25:37] from his hands. But I know what kind of
[25:41] God he is and I'm trusting in his
[25:44] promises. I'm believing and I'm singing.
[25:48] Yes, he can.
[25:51] Did he move every mountain? Did he part
[25:55] every seed? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.
[26:02] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[26:05] deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.

[28:03] [Music]
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, God bless you believers. Um
[28:12] Kim doesn't really have a voice, but if
[28:15] she did, I know she would say it's such
[28:17] an honor and a privilege um to be here
[28:21] and it feels like a family reunion.
[28:25] But really, I just want to say thank you
[28:27] to Shakina Glory Tabernacle for hosting
[28:29] these meetings. It is just been such a
[28:32] refresher for me. Um these services have
[28:35] just been a blessing. Um, and when
[28:38] brother John preached this morning, um,
[28:40] yesterday morning about um, the sheep
[28:42] calling and the lambs bleing, it made me
[28:45] think of a time when I was outside and I
[28:48] saw the lambs in our neighbor's yard and
[28:50] one of the lambs lost his mom and he was
[28:53] crying. And I remember just thinking,
[28:56] "Oh, that was such a helpless cry." And
[29:00] that was me. I came here as a lamb with
[29:03] helplessly crying out. And um God is so
[29:07] gracious and so faithful that he he
[29:10] always answers.
[29:12] And um this song is just about when I'm
[29:16] losing my way, I hear the shepherd's
[29:19] call
[29:21] and I trust it's a blessing.
[29:23] [Music]
[29:41] I wanded far
[29:46] from the fold where I was safe.
[29:56] And it wasn't long
[30:01] till I found I'd lost my way.
[30:07] [Music]
[30:11] And I cried with fear
[30:16] as the night began to fall.
[30:23] [Music]
[30:27] One more lost lamb.
[30:30] [Music]
[30:32] Then I heard the shepherds
[30:35] call.
[30:38] [Music]
[30:43] He saw my steps
[30:47] as they walked right into the dark.
[30:52] [Music]
[30:58] And though I went astray,
[31:03] I never once left his heart.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:12] [Music]
[31:14] That night long ago,
[31:18] how I still recall
[31:25] [Music]
[31:28] when I lost my way.
[31:33] I heard the shephers
[31:36] call.
[31:42] And he left the fold
[31:47] to search out that one last.
[31:55] Thank you, Jesus.
[31:57] He left 99
[32:02] for there was one to be saved.
[32:12] And there on that ledge,
[32:17] one step would have ended
[32:20] it all.
[32:22] [Music]
[32:27] But I felt the hesus
[32:32] and I heard the shepher
[32:36] [Laughter]
[32:38] [Music]
[32:42] because he saw my steps
[32:47] as they walked right into the dark.
[32:58] And though I went astray,
[33:02] I never once left his heart.
[33:13] And that night long ago,
[33:17] how I still recall
[33:24] [Music]
[33:28] when I lost my way.
[33:32] I heard the sheepers
[33:36] call.
[33:38] [Music]
[33:41] And that night long ago,
[33:46] [Music]
[33:47] how I still recall
[33:52] [Music]
[33:58] when I lost my way.
[34:03] I heard the shephers
[34:07] call.
[34:08] [Music]
[34:17] [Applause]
[34:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. What a very
[34:29] fitting song that was. Amen. Let's just
[34:31] stand tonight.
[35:03] [Music]
[35:08] [Music]
[35:38] The Lord bless you
[35:42] and keep you,
[35:46] make his face shine upon you, and be
[35:51] gracious to you. The Lord turn his
[35:58] face towards you
[36:01] and give you peace. The Lord bless you.
[36:09] The Lord bless you
[36:13] and keep you.
[36:17] Make his face shine upon you and be
[36:22] gracious to you. The Lord turn his
[36:28] face towards you
[36:32] and give you peace.
[36:36] Amen.
[36:39] Amen.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:49] Amen.
[36:52] Amen.
[36:54] Amen.

[41:48] Praise the name of the Lord.
[41:52] Why don't we just bow our hearts in a
[41:54] word of prayer.
[41:59] Heavenly Father,
[42:02] we exalt the name that is above every
[42:04] name.
[42:06] He's above every sickness, every
[42:08] disease, every heartache, every
[42:11] struggle,
[42:13] anything that the devil could throw at
[42:14] us that would try to weaken our hands
[42:18] and weaken our hearts, weaken our
[42:20] vision,
[42:22] but we exalt the name of Jesus Christ.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you are our king.
[42:30] The world may not recognize you, but we
[42:33] have set you upon the throne of our
[42:35] hearts.
[42:37] And we set you above every complex and
[42:39] every struggle. We set you above this
[42:43] age of gross darkness, of wickedness and
[42:47] perverseness, godlessness.
[42:50] But Lord Jesus, you are our king. You're
[42:53] the amen of our lives.
[42:56] You're our absolute. You're our
[42:58] strength. and you're our courage. You're
[43:01] our vision.
[43:03] And oh God, we ask that you would reign
[43:05] supreme and have preeminence in this
[43:08] service as the atmosphere has been
[43:11] created. The songs have been sung. Songs
[43:15] of victory.
[43:17] Songs from the lips of the redeemed.
[43:20] Hearts of gratitude. Worshippers that
[43:24] realize that they're not what they used
[43:26] to be, but they have been changed and
[43:29] they've been set free. And it's all
[43:31] because of your divine favor upon our
[43:34] lives. Oh God, we worship you, oh God.
[43:39] We exalt you, oh God.
[43:42] And oh father, I pray that you would
[43:44] bless your children.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you died for this purpose to
[43:50] sanctify us and consecrate us with a
[43:52] holy calling that you can move and work
[43:56] among your people and to manifest
[43:58] yourself as the living God. Now, oh God,
[44:02] we give this service over to you,
[44:04] Father.
[44:05] Lord, you move among your children the
[44:08] way that you want to move, Lord.
[44:11] We invite you, Father. We welcome you,
[44:14] oh God. We welcome you as our champion.
[44:19] Oh Lord Jesus. Thank you for these
[44:22] musicians.
[44:24] Thank you, Father, for the song leader.
[44:27] Lord, as they have just tirelessly in
[44:30] the mornings and the evenings just
[44:33] created an atmosphere, we pray that you
[44:35] bless them, oh God. Bless all the
[44:38] singers, fathers, Lord, the
[44:41] congregation,
[44:43] Lord, all of the families that have come
[44:46] from far and wide and they've come to
[44:50] just put their licks of fire together,
[44:53] Lord, to make this meeting a success.
[44:56] And oh God, I pray a real special
[44:58] blessing upon them and all of their
[45:01] churches and the pastors and the
[45:03] ministry, Father, that is preaching the
[45:06] message of this hour, Lord. Oh God,
[45:09] we're confident that it's what is needed
[45:11] in this hour to change our bodies, Lord,
[45:15] to change our attitudes, change our
[45:17] vision. And I pray, oh God, a special
[45:20] blessing upon our our pastor, our host
[45:24] pastor here and his wife and his family
[45:26] and their church. Father, I pray God
[45:29] that you would strengthen their hands,
[45:31] Father. Lord, as you've given them this
[45:34] vision, I pray God that you would
[45:37] continue to to strengthen them and bless
[45:40] them, oh God, and just pour out your
[45:42] blessings upon them. And now father as
[45:46] we come to this last this last evening
[45:50] service and Lord so many things have
[45:54] already been said and Lord we've seen
[45:57] you already do great things among us and
[46:00] now father we would ask Lord that just
[46:03] once more you would move among us and I
[46:07] pray God that you would discern our
[46:09] hearts and just change lives and move as
[46:12] only you can move Father For Lord Jesus,
[46:15] I am but a man and I I'm not a prophet
[46:19] and I'm not the son of a prophet, but
[46:22] Lord Jesus, you're the prophet of the
[46:24] hour. Your word is here to discern the
[46:27] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[46:29] oh God, we ask Lord that you would go
[46:32] and you would just divide between soul
[46:35] and spirit and that you would touch
[46:38] hearts and men lives and restore and
[46:41] just move. Let your desires be made
[46:44] manifest in your children, Father, and
[46:48] we'll give you the glory and the praise
[46:50] for it, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[46:54] Amen. And amen. God richly bless you.
[46:58] You can have your seats for just a few
[47:00] moments. We just want to say what a an
[47:04] honor and privilege it has been minister
[47:08] to you. You've just been in such a
[47:10] lovely audience and uh been so attentive
[47:14] and respectful to the word and uh we see
[47:19] the uh we see the fire that is burning
[47:21] in your hearts and uh the zeal and and
[47:26] the passion that you have for our our
[47:30] husband which is our lover Christ Jesus.
[47:33] And uh it has just been a real uh a real
[47:37] privilege to be here and and uh to
[47:40] witness the harmony uh that that only
[47:43] God can can produce and in the hearts
[47:46] and lives of his children. And uh it's
[47:50] just been a real uh honor to get to know
[47:53] Brother Ben and Sister Christine and uh
[47:56] just see the spirit of Christ uh in
[47:59] their lives and and uh see their heart
[48:02] and uh you know uh it's very evident the
[48:06] the heart that brother Ben has and and
[48:09] that is to uh just to promote the
[48:11] message and to see a unity in the body
[48:14] of Christ. And I salute our brother for
[48:17] that. And uh uh you know it shows that
[48:20] his heart is in the right place. And uh
[48:23] you know our brother uh it's very
[48:25] evident that he's not trying to build a
[48:27] kingdom for himself but he's trying to
[48:29] just promote the kingdom of God. And I
[48:32] admire men like that. And I I say God
[48:35] richly bless you, Brother Ben, and and
[48:37] your family and your church and just all
[48:39] of the pastors that have come and to
[48:42] support the meeting and all of the
[48:44] ministry and and uh you know uh
[48:47] dismissing your services and bringing
[48:49] your flocks here. It shows uh your heart
[48:52] as well and your vision for uh for
[48:54] harmony and unity and and um and uh you
[48:59] you know you you have confidence uh to
[49:02] to bring your churches here. And I I
[49:04] just say God richly bless you. And I
[49:06] pray that uh you you leave here more
[49:10] strengthened and better Christians and
[49:12] and uh in greater harmony than ever
[49:15] before and and uh just have greatly uh
[49:20] just appreciated uh brother John's
[49:22] ministry and and uh the opportunity just
[49:25] to minister with brother John. We've
[49:27] known each other for a number of years,
[49:29] but this is our first uh time getting to
[49:32] minister together and and uh just to see
[49:35] his love for the people of God and and
[49:38] uh wanting to just uh give you something
[49:41] that will help you and encourage and
[49:43] strengthen you and and I I know you've
[49:46] been greatly blessed by the ministry of
[49:48] our of our brother and and uh you know,
[49:52] as as he says, he's got he's got money
[49:55] in the bank and and uh you know I think
[49:59] someone was joking around and saying his
[50:01] his balance is getting to zero and uh
[50:08] but uh you know I there was a little
[50:10] joke there but uh I I see his love for
[50:14] for you and the people and and uh I tell
[50:17] you we won I I think that's the spirit
[50:20] of Christ in this hour as we hold the
[50:23] baton in our hands that uh I just think
[50:26] the body of Christ is is uh has has
[50:30] drawn a line in the sand, if you will,
[50:32] and saying we we're we're tired of the
[50:35] clicks. We're tired of the fighting, and
[50:38] we're tired of the kingdom building.
[50:40] We're tired of uh one man trying to take
[50:43] a piece and say, "Well, I've got the
[50:46] kingdom of God, and you know, and I've
[50:48] got the ministry, and I I I I think
[50:51] we're just a little tired of it, to be
[50:53] honest with you." And uh I think we need
[50:56] to get back to promoting what the
[50:58] message is all about and that is Jesus
[51:01] Christ. And it's a living gospel. It's a
[51:04] living word. It's the it's the power of
[51:06] Jesus Christ moving and working among
[51:09] his people. And uh it's not my people.
[51:12] It's God's people. and and uh and you
[51:16] know we're just uh we're just uh
[51:19] shepherds and and uh we're just
[51:22] ambassadors of Christ trying to preach
[51:24] the message of the hour to strengthen
[51:26] the people. We want to get out of here
[51:29] and uh I think we're crying for one uh
[51:32] you know as the the more we go we just
[51:36] we've we've got one voice and that is
[51:38] even so come Lord Jesus. I don't know
[51:41] about you, but I don't want to be here
[51:43] another year. Uh it it wouldn't offend
[51:46] me at all if uh the Lord would just take
[51:49] us in the next five minutes, and I I
[51:51] didn't even have to preach. I you know,
[51:53] that just means that we've already we've
[51:55] done what we're supposed to do. And and
[51:58] uh we're just ready. And uh but you
[52:01] know, uh if we knew that the Lord was
[52:04] coming in the morning, we'd still plant
[52:06] our potatoes tonight. and uh we we want
[52:09] to try to get souls to Christ and we we
[52:12] know that there's uh bleeding sheep and
[52:15] and lambs and that are needing a real
[52:18] touch of God and and uh and we're all a
[52:21] part of that, aren't we? Uh it doesn't
[52:23] matter your age. It doesn't matter if
[52:26] you're uh well, the prophet of God said
[52:28] it like this. We're all ministers and uh
[52:31] so we're all trying to reach the lost
[52:33] and you know uh it's been the greatest
[52:36] privilege of my life to be able to
[52:38] preach this message and uh you know uh
[52:43] it doesn't mean that it's been easy.
[52:45] There's been a lot of trials and a lot
[52:46] of struggles and the devil's tried to
[52:49] derail us along along the way and and uh
[52:53] you know I've I've reached uh I guess I
[52:56] don't know if I'd say it like like this
[52:58] but I'm 43 and I I guess I've kind of uh
[53:03] hit a milestone in my life that I'm not
[53:05] I don't think I'm old and but I'm not
[53:09] &gt;&gt; young and uh but you know I I think I've
[53:13] hit a milestone stone in my life that I
[53:15] can say that I can look back through
[53:18] through life and say, you know, the
[53:21] devil just doesn't have enough.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; He He's tried to defeat me. He's tried
[53:25] to discourage me, tried to get me to
[53:27] quit. And, you know, there was those
[53:29] times that I thought I would, and there
[53:32] was times that I I I grew a little
[53:34] discouraged, and I I thought that I
[53:36] wouldn't have enough to do it. But but
[53:38] you know, we we've come through uh
[53:41] enough hardships now that we can just
[53:43] simply say, you know, devil, you just
[53:45] don't have enough.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you know, the devil's just
[53:50] whooped. He's defeated. And uh it's just
[53:54] uh the greatest privilege that that I've
[53:57] got in life, and that is to just
[53:59] proclaim this good news to the children
[54:02] of God that the devil doesn't have
[54:04] enough over your life either. He can't
[54:07] defeat you. Amen. He He doesn't have
[54:10] enough to defeat you. The purpose of God
[54:13] is already settled in heaven and it's
[54:16] now being made manifest in earth and and
[54:19] that's this earth. And and uh so you
[54:22] know this message changed my life as a
[54:25] as a young person. Uh I was raised up in
[54:29] Pentecost and but then the message found
[54:32] me when I was just about uh 12 13 years
[54:36] old and and it got a hold of my life.
[54:38] And you know as a young person it
[54:41] changed my life and uh set me free from
[54:45] so many things. And you know, I I I see
[54:49] the effects of this message and just
[54:52] just preaching it, just saying what a
[54:54] prophet said and knowing that it's the
[54:57] words of of life that can liberate God's
[55:01] people. And it did it for me and I'm I'm
[55:04] seeing I'm seeing it do it for God's
[55:07] people as well. You know, we're in a
[55:09] season where uh I I'm seeing prodals
[55:13] come home. Uh I I've I've been able to
[55:17] witness it uh just over and over. uh
[55:21] young people that were hurt by church
[55:24] splits and things of that nature and
[55:26] went into the world and and just just
[55:29] God in his sovereign grace coming down
[55:32] and and uh see the makeup and the
[55:35] worldliness and fight trying to hold
[55:38] back the tears and then they lose the
[55:39] battle and the tears begin to flow and
[55:42] they come back and give their heart to
[55:44] God and I you know I I'm seeing it over
[55:48] and over again the prodals coming back
[55:52] to God. And again, it just shows the
[55:55] devil doesn't have enough. I I know he
[55:58] tries to he tries to, you know, puff
[56:01] himself up as if he's something and he's
[56:04] got, you know, he's got the final say
[56:06] over our lives, but you know, in the
[56:08] leodys church age, the Bible shows us
[56:11] that that the the amen of God, the
[56:14] faithful witness of the word comes among
[56:17] the church. and he's the amen. The
[56:20] devil's not the amen over your life.
[56:23] It's God that is the final amen. And uh
[56:26] so, you know, there's a lot of things
[56:28] that we can look at and grow discouraged
[56:30] and fearful and all of those things, but
[56:34] you know, the prophet of God told us to
[56:36] look and he never he never pointed us to
[56:40] the the the problems that is in the
[56:42] world. He never pointed us to the church
[56:45] problems. He never even pointed us to uh
[56:48] Leoa necessarily. He just pointed us to
[56:52] Jesus Christ. And he said he just said
[56:55] that if you'll look, you'll live. And if
[56:58] you can't find him, look again. And I I
[57:02] think that's where we're at. We're in
[57:04] the season of looking again. This
[57:07] message has been vindicated. It's
[57:09] powerful. It has the power to change
[57:12] lives. It's the answer. And I think we
[57:15] just need to look again. I I think as
[57:18] our brother said it this morning, Amen.
[57:21] Let's just put the past behind us and
[57:23] let's get a fresh vision of this message
[57:26] because we are it's a special season
[57:29] that we're living in. And uh I believe
[57:32] it. And so, you know, uh this is my last
[57:35] service, so I just want to take a few mo
[57:37] of these moments, you know, and we're
[57:39] we've we've uh we've we've got to see
[57:42] make new friends. And I say God richly
[57:45] bless you. Uh we've we've got to renew
[57:48] old acquaintances. It's hard to believe
[57:51] that uh we come to New Zealand the first
[57:53] time. I think it was about 10 years ago
[57:56] and I feel like I was a kid. And some of
[57:59] you are looking and saying, "You're
[58:01] still a kid." And uh uh we we pray we've
[58:03] grown a little bit and uh but there's
[58:06] one thing we we have grown in and that
[58:09] is confidence in this message. And uh so
[58:13] we just pray for you, you continue to
[58:16] pray for us. And I know that uh if we
[58:18] never see each other again on this in
[58:20] this life, we'll see each other in
[58:22] eternity. And that's what we're longing
[58:25] for is the rapture and the change of our
[58:27] bodies. And I just want to say to you
[58:29] young people, press the battle. It's
[58:32] your time. It's your season. Amen. Take
[58:35] courage. And uh and you you just look to
[58:38] some of these elders. Uh they didn't get
[58:41] here by accident. They've weathered a
[58:43] few storms, a whole lot of storms. And
[58:46] there's some oak trees that you can just
[58:48] uh come under their shade. And they'll
[58:51] tell you, son, daughter, it's because we
[58:54] just surrendered our life to Jesus
[58:56] Christ and we're witnesses of what this
[58:58] message can do. And so, amen. We just
[59:01] want to say God richly bless you. I, you
[59:04] know, I want to read this quote and
[59:06] we're going to then we're going to turn
[59:07] to our in our scriptures, but the
[59:09] prophet of God is referring to Mark
[59:11] 11:24 and he says, "Whatsoever things
[59:13] you desire when you pray, believe you
[59:16] receive it." Lord, we prayed for a
[59:19] meeting. We've been fasting for a
[59:21] meeting. We've been crying for a
[59:23] meeting. Yes, Lord. I believe the
[59:25] meeting's on the road. Then stand there
[59:28] like, "Oh, till the power of God comes
[59:30] down." When it hits it says, "Yes." Next
[59:34] man says, "Yes." Look, you got double
[59:37] power. Yes. Yes. Triple power. Yes. Four
[59:42] times power. Yes. First thing you know,
[59:45] it becomes thousands powers of yes. Then
[59:48] the Holy Spirit moves in and confirms
[59:51] the word of God with signs and wonders
[59:54] following. That's it. That's what we
[59:56] need. An expectation. And so as we
[59:59] minister the word of God, I just want
[1:00:02] your heart to begin to agree with the
[1:00:04] word and just simply say yes to the word
[1:00:07] of God. Amen. All you need is one person
[1:00:11] to say yes. Then if another person will
[1:00:14] say yes, you've got two powers of yes.
[1:00:17] then the three power and a four power.
[1:00:19] And if we could all get together and
[1:00:22] begin to say yes to the word of God,
[1:00:25] then omnipotence is coming to
[1:00:27] omnipotence and something has got to
[1:00:30] take place. I just want to encourage
[1:00:32] you, get your eyes off of your
[1:00:34] situation, off of your problems, off of
[1:00:37] what you're going back to when you go
[1:00:39] home, and just look to Christ this
[1:00:42] evening. Amen. And so, Zechariah the 4th
[1:00:45] chapter, we read this uh last night and
[1:00:48] we're just going to read the same
[1:00:50] scriptures again if you don't mind. And
[1:00:52] we're just going to take uh our text,
[1:00:55] faith and grace.
[1:00:57] Faith in grace. And we're just going to
[1:01:00] take a part two of this if you'd like to
[1:01:02] stand to your feet with us.
[1:01:08] Zechariah 4 and verse one.
[1:01:12] And the angel that talked with me came
[1:01:14] again and waked me as a man that is
[1:01:18] wakened out of his sleep and said unto
[1:01:21] me, "What seeest thou?" And I said, I
[1:01:24] have looked, and behold, a candlestick
[1:01:26] all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of
[1:01:29] it, and his seven lamps thereon, and
[1:01:31] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[1:01:34] upon the top thereof, and two olive
[1:01:37] trees by it, one upon the right side of
[1:01:39] the bowl, and the other upon the left
[1:01:41] side thereof. So I answered and spake to
[1:01:45] the angel that talked with me, saying,
[1:01:47] "What are these, my Lord?" Then the
[1:01:50] angel that talked with me answered and
[1:01:53] said unto me, "Knowest thou not what
[1:01:55] these be?" And I said, "No, my Lord."
[1:01:58] Then he answered and spake unto me,
[1:02:00] saying, "This is the word of the Lord
[1:02:03] unto Zerubabel, saying, Not by might,
[1:02:06] nor by power, but by my spirit, saith
[1:02:10] the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh
[1:02:13] great mountain, before Zerubable? thou
[1:02:16] shalt become a plain and he shall bring
[1:02:19] forth the headstone thereof with
[1:02:21] shoutings crying grace grace unto it and
[1:02:26] then Psalms 110 and verse three reads
[1:02:29] like this thy people shall be willing in
[1:02:34] the day of thy power if I should ask who
[1:02:37] is thy people. Amen. How many can say
[1:02:41] that you are that people? Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Thy people shall be willing in the day
[1:02:47] of thy power. Now, let's just bow our
[1:02:50] heads in a word of prayer. Father, we
[1:02:53] just express our appreciation for all
[1:02:57] that you have done for us thus far. And
[1:03:00] now, Lord, we just ask that you would
[1:03:02] move by your spirit. Take us, Father, in
[1:03:05] your hands and speak through us, Lord.
[1:03:09] And fathers, just take the people in
[1:03:12] your control and in your hands, Lord.
[1:03:15] And Father, let us be willing this
[1:03:18] evening to receive what you would have
[1:03:20] for us by your grace. And now, Father,
[1:03:23] we give you all the glory and the praise
[1:03:25] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[1:03:29] amen. God richly bless you. You can be
[1:03:33] seated.
[1:03:34] And so again the prophet would say do
[1:03:37] you see the message will not come by
[1:03:41] some great might or powers but by the
[1:03:44] spirit of God and this is not an
[1:03:48] ecumenical move that we are in but this
[1:03:51] is a Holy Ghost move. It's not by might
[1:03:55] it's not by power but it's by my spirit
[1:03:58] saith the Lord. And in the day of his
[1:04:02] power, the people shall be willing and
[1:04:06] be they'll be willing to be placed that
[1:04:10] the Holy Spirit can flow through the
[1:04:13] church of the living God through
[1:04:14] individuals where God can say there goes
[1:04:18] my spirit flowing freely. And uh you
[1:04:22] know the prophet of God would say the
[1:04:24] secret to the success of his mis
[1:04:27] ministry was what he surrendered himself
[1:04:31] to. He would actually say that it's not
[1:04:34] me the son of man. It's only what I am
[1:04:38] surrendering myself to. And his ministry
[1:04:42] was to introduce us to the son of man
[1:04:46] Jesus Christ the word. And so, brother
[1:04:49] Brandham would say that it's only what I
[1:04:52] surrender myself to. And the success of
[1:04:57] the bride in this last days is going to
[1:05:00] be the surrender of herself to the grace
[1:05:03] of God. That it's not by might, it's not
[1:05:06] by power, but it's by his spirit, it's
[1:05:10] by the grace of God. We would find that
[1:05:14] in 2 Corinthians the 3rd chapter the
[1:05:16] 17th verse Paul would say now the Lord
[1:05:20] is that spirit and where the spirit of
[1:05:23] the lord is there is liberty. So he is
[1:05:28] identifying that the lord himself is
[1:05:31] that spirit and we find these scriptures
[1:05:35] so so relevant to our age. Amen. that we
[1:05:40] find there in 1 Thessalonians the 4th
[1:05:42] chapter the 16th verse that the Lord
[1:05:46] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:05:49] shout or with a message and what is that
[1:05:53] message to do is to gather the bride
[1:05:56] together. Amen. Because where the body
[1:06:00] word of the son of man is there the
[1:06:03] eagles will gather together. But then
[1:06:06] there is the voice of the archangel and
[1:06:09] the prophet would identify that as the
[1:06:11] voice of the resurrection and with the
[1:06:14] trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:06:17] shall rise first. So we're we're seeing
[1:06:20] that the Lord himself shall descend and
[1:06:24] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[1:06:28] spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
[1:06:31] to the children of God. Then we can go
[1:06:34] to Revelations the 10th chapter and in
[1:06:37] the in the first verse and how that
[1:06:39] there is a mighty angel and he's got a
[1:06:42] he's got a rainbow over his head and the
[1:06:45] prophet of God identifies that this is
[1:06:47] the covenant angel and this is Christ
[1:06:51] none other it can be. It is the anointed
[1:06:55] one. It is Christ. And what is he doing?
[1:06:59] He is descending unto the earth. Amen.
[1:07:03] So, it's like Elohim descended the word
[1:07:08] made flesh and he and he's got dust on
[1:07:11] his clothes and he comes down to Abraham
[1:07:14] and Sarah and he and he begins to let
[1:07:17] them know, I remember my covenant. I
[1:07:21] remember my promise that I have made to
[1:07:24] you. And it's a grace covenant. It was
[1:07:28] not what you can do, Abraham. But I I'm
[1:07:32] actually going to bring you to a
[1:07:35] condition that you can't fulfill it.
[1:07:38] There there was a season, amen, that it
[1:07:41] looked like they could fulfill it in
[1:07:43] their flesh. But God allowed them to go
[1:07:47] to go years and years until after 24
[1:07:50] years, Sarah's womb is dried up.
[1:07:53] Abraham's uh uh life is dried up.
[1:07:57] They're old people and yet they still
[1:07:59] have a promise. And it's in that season
[1:08:03] that God descends and reminds them that
[1:08:07] I am come and I remember my promise. You
[1:08:11] see, it was a season of grace that you
[1:08:15] can't fulfill it, but my favor is upon
[1:08:18] your life. And I am here to take away
[1:08:21] your complexes. I am here to take away
[1:08:25] the the the the the humanity that you're
[1:08:28] seeing in the mirror. I I'm coming to
[1:08:31] change your view from what you see to
[1:08:34] what I see. And what I see is a divine
[1:08:38] promise. Now, that's exactly what has
[1:08:42] been prophesied over this bride is
[1:08:45] Malachi 4. I'm going to turn your faith
[1:08:47] back. You are identified in Malachi 4.
[1:08:51] the faith that has been restored back. I
[1:08:54] say our faith has been restored back.
[1:08:57] Amen. We're identified. Amen. In all of
[1:09:00] these scriptures and the promises, the
[1:09:03] works that I do shall you do also. For I
[1:09:06] go unto my father, but I've got a
[1:09:08] portion of ministry in the last days
[1:09:10] that only the bride can fulfill.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's going to take the Lord
[1:09:17] himself stepping in on the scene and
[1:09:20] saying, "I remember my promise." Now,
[1:09:24] Abraham, I swore by myself. I didn't
[1:09:27] swear by you. I didn't swear by a creed.
[1:09:30] I didn't swear by church. Amen. A man is
[1:09:33] full of mistakes and failures. But I
[1:09:35] have swore by myself, by my power, that
[1:09:39] I will keep my word. Amen. Now you see
[1:09:43] there was a a a cloud and a
[1:09:45] constellation of angels and and how many
[1:09:49] remembers that the prophet of God
[1:09:51] actually says that's my Lord up there.
[1:09:54] Amen. Do you remember? Amen. If you can
[1:09:56] just put that that first picture of the
[1:09:59] cloud up on the screen. Amen. Remember
[1:10:02] they they they had the picture of the of
[1:10:05] the of the first one there that says a
[1:10:07] high cloud ring of mystery. and and
[1:10:10] everyone's looking at that and and
[1:10:12] they're turning it this way and they're
[1:10:14] turning it this way and and the prophet
[1:10:16] of God is saying it's seven angels up
[1:10:19] there and he's saying that there's one
[1:10:21] with the swept back wings and and
[1:10:23] they're all looking at it. But then the
[1:10:25] prophet of God in 65 in it's the rising
[1:10:29] of the sun. remember that he begins to
[1:10:32] take you to Revelations 1 and how that
[1:10:35] there was the son of man and that he had
[1:10:39] uh he had white hair and he says it's
[1:10:42] like the it's like the old judges how
[1:10:45] that they put a wig on which is symbolic
[1:10:48] of supreme authority. Amen. That they've
[1:10:50] got the final say. And and and and he
[1:10:54] begins to take you through all of that
[1:10:56] and then he says, "Now we've been
[1:10:57] looking at it. We've been wondering how
[1:11:00] to look at it. But you see, it was God
[1:11:04] that spoke to his prophet and said,
[1:11:06] "You've got to look at it the right
[1:11:09] way."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; You see, for for a couple of years,
[1:11:13] they've had the picture, but they didn't
[1:11:16] know how to look at it. So, God came
[1:11:19] down and told his prophet, "You've got
[1:11:22] to turn it to the right way." And when
[1:11:25] he turned it to the right way, he said,
[1:11:28] "That is my Lord up there." So what was
[1:11:32] promised is that the Lord himself shall
[1:11:36] descend. And he is descending through a
[1:11:40] message that is going to catch the
[1:11:43] attention of a bride. And it's the bread
[1:11:46] of life that is going to manifest a word
[1:11:48] bride in the last days. And it's going
[1:11:51] to be the grace of God to her. Now you
[1:11:54] say, "Well, now now I don't know about
[1:11:57] all of that." Well, let's just take what
[1:11:59] a prophet says. If you'll turn the
[1:12:02] picture like this and look now, there he
[1:12:04] is. And he says, "See, it's Christ."
[1:12:10] See his eyes looking here just as
[1:12:12] perfect as it could be wearing the white
[1:12:15] wig of supreme deity and judge of all
[1:12:18] heavens and earth. Can you see his eyes,
[1:12:21] his nose, his mouth? just turn the
[1:12:24] picture from this the way they had it
[1:12:27] this way the way it's supposed to be.
[1:12:31] Oh my. It takes a prophet just to fix
[1:12:34] things and put it in its right order.
[1:12:36] Just take it put it the way it's
[1:12:38] supposed to be. Can you see it? He is
[1:12:41] supreme judge. There is none other but
[1:12:44] him. And that is a perfect
[1:12:47] identification again of vindication that
[1:12:50] this message is the truth. This is the
[1:12:55] truth. It is true. And making him not a
[1:12:58] third person but the only person. Now
[1:13:01] watch how the prophet he's going to take
[1:13:04] it now a little step further. He's
[1:13:07] already identified that this is the
[1:13:09] judge with supreme authority. But now he
[1:13:13] says with the white you see the dark his
[1:13:16] face his beard and his eyes and notice
[1:13:19] he is looking from him comes this light
[1:13:22] shining on the right side right hand
[1:13:25] side to which he's looking to and on the
[1:13:29] cross that's where he looked to the
[1:13:32] right where he pardoned the sinner in
[1:13:36] the light of his resurrection we still
[1:13:38] go forth in his name so He's letting you
[1:13:42] know that the message is the light of
[1:13:45] his resurrection. And this message is a
[1:13:48] pardon to the church of the living God.
[1:13:52] Those that are bound in sin and
[1:13:54] trespasses, this message has come as
[1:13:57] grace to pardon you of all your sins.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God would say that
[1:14:05] he looked to the right. And you can see
[1:14:08] he's looking to the right just like he
[1:14:11] did on the cross. Now, the prophet of
[1:14:14] God would actually tell us that grace is
[1:14:17] sovereign and it's got to come from a
[1:14:20] sovereign one. And he's identifying that
[1:14:23] that sovereign one is a king. So, it
[1:14:26] takes a king or someone with supreme
[1:14:29] authority to give grace. Now, you take
[1:14:34] the thief on the cross. You've got two
[1:14:36] of them. one on the left, one on the
[1:14:38] right, but the one on the right is the
[1:14:41] one that's saying the right thing. And
[1:14:44] what he's saying is, remember me when
[1:14:47] you come into your kingdom.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Now, there was something within him,
[1:14:53] though he was vile, though he was dying
[1:14:56] on a cross, though he was sentenced to
[1:14:59] death, and there was no way he's getting
[1:15:01] out of this mess.
[1:15:03] There's no way that he can change his
[1:15:06] condition.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; But he's in a season of grace.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; There's no preacher there saying this is
[1:15:16] what you need to do and you need to do
[1:15:18] this and there's no prophet there. It's
[1:15:20] Christ the word. And they've rejected
[1:15:23] Christ the word and they put him to an
[1:15:26] open shame. And there is an elect there
[1:15:29] that is saying, "I know who you are.
[1:15:34] Now the prophet of God would actually
[1:15:37] let us know that this thief that God had
[1:15:41] never come across his mind in his life.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Now what I'm trying to do is let you
[1:15:48] know the season of grace you're in.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; And this thief between the groves
[1:15:58] there came a sound. Lord
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; be merciful to me.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And there come another one back through
[1:16:06] blood, tears, agony. Grace took a hold
[1:16:09] and said today thou shalt be with me in
[1:16:12] paradise. Grace did that.
[1:16:15] How could that thief thief help your
[1:16:18] help himself? I just want to ask how can
[1:16:21] how can we help ourselves?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; But you see the prophet of God is
[1:16:26] showing us that's our pardon.
[1:16:29] And that's our Lord up there. And where
[1:16:31] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[1:16:33] liberty.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And you know what that liberty is going
[1:16:37] to do? It's going to change you. It's
[1:16:40] going to change you. Transform you from
[1:16:42] glory to glory to glory to glory. I'm
[1:16:46] not what I want. I I'm not what I want
[1:16:49] to be, but thank God I'm not what I used
[1:16:51] to be. There's something that has got a
[1:16:54] hold of my life. There's an inspiration.
[1:16:56] It's changing me into his very image.
[1:17:00] It's grace that's doing it. You see?
[1:17:03] Amen. In the visitation of the son of
[1:17:05] man, will will I find faith when the son
[1:17:09] of man comes? We preached on that on
[1:17:11] Friday. Will I find faith to go to that
[1:17:14] judge
[1:17:16] in the season of grace and ask what you
[1:17:19] will?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Will I find faith? Will I find a
[1:17:24] recognition that that is my judge and my
[1:17:28] judge has become my attorney? And the
[1:17:31] prophet of God and the token says that
[1:17:33] you know you did it. You know you're
[1:17:35] guilty but yet you've got an attorney
[1:17:38] and the attorney knows the law and that
[1:17:41] eternity and that attorney amen knows
[1:17:44] that he can get you off.
[1:17:48] It's because the judge become Jesus
[1:17:51] Christ. And the prophet even would say
[1:17:54] he become judge, attorney, and jury.
[1:17:58] It's a stack deck. It's a stack court.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Then let me ask you in this season of
[1:18:06] grace, how can you lose?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; I know the devil's been trying to derail
[1:18:14] us. He'd been trying it for the last 50,
[1:18:17] 60 years, but we're still here.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; I know he's tried to put scars in your
[1:18:22] life, but you're still here.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And you're trophies of grace. And when
[1:18:28] you get up there on that day, you will
[1:18:30] stand there not as a know-it-all. You'll
[1:18:32] stand there as Mrs. Grace, and you'll
[1:18:34] begin to say, "It's amazing grace that
[1:18:37] saved a wretch like me. I once was lost.
[1:18:40] I was so lost in hybrid religion, in
[1:18:43] some man-made creed and dogma, but I'm
[1:18:46] here by grace.
[1:18:50] [Applause]
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; You're not going to get there because
[1:18:52] you were under some great preacher.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And yet, we thank God for great
[1:18:57] ministries.
[1:18:59] But I think anyone that preaches this
[1:19:00] min this message has a great ministry.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; But it's grace.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's a grace covenant.
[1:19:10] And Christ is God's covenant. And it's
[1:19:12] not if you will, but it's I already
[1:19:15] have.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And so, Revelations 10:1 is Christ. It's
[1:19:19] God's covenant coming into full
[1:19:22] strength. It's the son of man, the Holy
[1:19:25] Ghost, not as a baptism, not in his
[1:19:27] emotion, but it's the covenant of the
[1:19:30] Holy Ghost. It's Christ himself coming
[1:19:33] in full strength. Not partial light,
[1:19:36] partial revelation, partial
[1:19:38] understanding, but it's a full
[1:19:40] revelation of who you are in Christ
[1:19:43] Jesus.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "All that the father
[1:19:47] hath given me will come to me, and I
[1:19:49] will not lose one."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; That is the confidence this bride has in
[1:19:54] the son of man. He will not lose you.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's coming into full
[1:20:00] strength. Everything he died for is
[1:20:04] coming into full effect.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan is doing everything in
[1:20:09] his power to kill the effects of this
[1:20:11] message.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; He's tried to make the blood
[1:20:14] ineffective. He's tried to make the word
[1:20:17] a cold, powerless, ineffective gospel.
[1:20:20] But you see, we're living in the calling
[1:20:22] out time of the bride. We're living in
[1:20:25] the pulling out time. We're being
[1:20:26] magnetized to the headstone.
[1:20:29] Come out of all unbelief. Come out of
[1:20:31] fears of failure. Come out of the
[1:20:34] condemnation that tries to keep you,
[1:20:36] Amen, keep you under fear and complexes
[1:20:39] and tormenting you of your past. Come
[1:20:41] out of those skeptic spirits that is
[1:20:43] always criticizing the move of God and
[1:20:45] criticizing this and criticizing that.
[1:20:49] Hallelujah. Come out of those earthbound
[1:20:53] senses. Amen. of what you see and hear
[1:20:56] and and how you feel and your
[1:20:58] imagination and what you reason and your
[1:21:00] conscience come out of it.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God said that he
[1:21:07] went to a certain factory and there was
[1:21:08] a magnet
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; and it would go over the workplace and
[1:21:13] everything that was that was magnetized
[1:21:15] was pulled up.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; He said then there were some other
[1:21:19] things that weren't pulled up and he
[1:21:20] said because it was aluminum. But then
[1:21:23] he seen some things that was should have
[1:21:24] been magnetized. He said, "What's the
[1:21:26] problem with those?" He says, "Well,
[1:21:29] they're too I was going to say they're
[1:21:31] too earthbound.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; They're too bolted down."
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, what the message has come
[1:21:37] to do is cut the bolts.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; All that the Father given me will come
[1:21:42] to me, and I'm not going to lose one. So
[1:21:45] God brings a power to break the
[1:21:48] strongholds of these earthbound senses.
[1:21:54] Grace is doing that, friends.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Grace is breaking the strongholds of
[1:21:58] unbelief over your life.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Come out of it. You see, the greatest
[1:22:03] draw is the power of the gospel.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; The word of God is in full effect. It
[1:22:12] still heals, delivers, sets the captives
[1:22:15] free, breaks generational curses.
[1:22:18] The devil says, "Well, you know, things
[1:22:20] that was in your family tree and it's
[1:22:22] just passed down from generation to
[1:22:24] generation, you're stuck with it." No,
[1:22:26] you're not.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; The greatest draw that this that this
[1:22:30] generation has is the power of the
[1:22:32] gospel.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, young people.
[1:22:35] Amen. This Holy Ghost new wine is
[1:22:38] greater than any alcohol you'll ever get
[1:22:40] a hold of.
[1:22:43] the sensation of the revelation of the
[1:22:46] Holy Ghost just stimulating our souls.
[1:22:49] It's greater than drugs. It's greater
[1:22:51] than sex. It's greater than anything the
[1:22:54] world has to offer. And I say it's
[1:22:56] drawing. I say come unto this living
[1:23:00] Christ and he'll make you so drunk on
[1:23:03] the Holy Ghost you'll love everybody.
[1:23:06] You'll want to you'll you'll pray for
[1:23:08] your worst s your worst enemy.
[1:23:11] It's the drawing of the word that does
[1:23:13] it. It's because it's effective.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; This gospel is effective.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a season of grace.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying to save my voice a little
[1:23:30] bit. You forgive me.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:23:37] it'll be out by the end. I promise.
[1:23:40] I try to be dignified. I really do. I I
[1:23:44] I try to be all dignified and it ain't
[1:23:47] in me.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; It just ain't in me.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; I see Brother John preach and I'm
[1:23:52] thinking, why can't I do like that?
[1:23:57] Some some of us just sweat and slobber
[1:23:59] and everything else. And I that's just
[1:24:02] my lot in life.
[1:24:04] the prophet of but but the prophet of
[1:24:07] God would bring us to the scripture
[1:24:09] there in
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; there at the pool of shalom
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; and how that there was a certain season
[1:24:15] that the angel of the Lord would would
[1:24:17] trouble the waters
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; and there were sick people and diseased
[1:24:21] and and and all kinds of ailments and
[1:24:23] they're all by the by the thousands
[1:24:25] they're all around this water
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; and they're waiting for this water to be
[1:24:30] troubled
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; you see because in the Old Testament,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; there was a brazen serpent
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; and that the angel would come. He came
[1:24:39] upon that brazen serpent and the prophet
[1:24:41] told him, "If you'll look, tell the
[1:24:43] people to look, they'll live."
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; But you see, they they made that into
[1:24:48] some idol worship and then they had to
[1:24:49] destroy it.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; God forbid that we turn this message
[1:24:53] into something idol worship.
[1:24:57] But you see, then God's always made a
[1:25:00] propitiation for the for the sick and
[1:25:03] and and and to help his people. So he
[1:25:06] sent an angel upon the water.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; And they knew that the angel was on the
[1:25:11] water when it turned from the natural to
[1:25:13] the supernatural.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; The current, how they knew the current
[1:25:16] was going one direction, but when the
[1:25:18] angel of the Lord moved upon the water,
[1:25:20] the current reversed and went backwards.
[1:25:23] And they knew it moved from the natural
[1:25:25] to the supernatural.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God would he you see
[1:25:30] you see water is a type of humanity
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; and the angel of the Lord moving upon
[1:25:38] the waters. Now there it was a natural
[1:25:41] water and the B and the prophet of God
[1:25:44] would say that the people would test
[1:25:46] their faith with the angel of the Lord
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; fighting. Sometimes they would stab one
[1:25:52] another trying to get into that water.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, I love how he
[1:25:57] said that, test their faith with the
[1:26:00] angel of the Lord.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And whoever could get there in there
[1:26:04] first, they were healed. But you see,
[1:26:06] now it's changed
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; because the water is now humanity.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible and the prophet of God in
[1:26:14] the sermon, looked, he says, "What are
[1:26:15] you looking to church?" Oh, these last
[1:26:18] days, he's been right among his people
[1:26:20] and we forget it. He's sit right among
[1:26:23] us and we didn't know it. The Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit is here this morning and maybe
[1:26:27] many will go away and forget it. Maybe
[1:26:29] many that sick will forget to believe
[1:26:31] and anchor their faith right where it
[1:26:33] should be. Now, truly, the pool is
[1:26:36] troubled. The waters are whirling
[1:26:39] backwards from the natural, showing the
[1:26:41] supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here
[1:26:44] taking a normal bunch of people
[1:26:46] intelligent sitting here well-dressed
[1:26:48] well educated looking the Holy Spirit
[1:26:51] fall among them and something whirls
[1:26:54] around them they holler glory to God
[1:26:56] hallelujah what's the matter the
[1:26:58] troubling of the water sinners sitting
[1:27:02] there backsliders prostitutes drunkards
[1:27:04] and everything else are saintly godly
[1:27:07] you can't put a finger on their lives
[1:27:09] anywhere since they receive it what Is
[1:27:12] it the troubling of the waters? What are
[1:27:16] you looking at? The Holy Spirit fall
[1:27:18] among us. I was sitting there a while
[1:27:20] ago with brother Outlaw pointing people
[1:27:21] to him here with diseases and things and
[1:27:24] could be done right now. Showing the
[1:27:26] different things that's happening in
[1:27:28] lives and things. What is it? It's the
[1:27:30] Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ. The same
[1:27:33] yesterday, today, and forever. What are
[1:27:35] we waiting for? The troubling of the
[1:27:38] water. It's already troubled. Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; I say it's still troubled.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I say the Holy Ghost is still moving
[1:27:49] upon humanity.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I say the Holy Ghost has been troubling
[1:27:53] our hearts and stirring us to believe
[1:27:56] for all things all throughout this
[1:27:58] meeting.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would give us another
[1:28:03] example. and would tell us about Paul
[1:28:05] Rider and how that he was had a sickness
[1:28:08] and he looked like he was going to die
[1:28:10] and he couldn't get past it and over it
[1:28:12] and but then God put him to sleep and he
[1:28:14] and he dreamed a dream
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; and Paul Rder was a logger and in this
[1:28:19] dream his boss told him to cut down a
[1:28:21] certain log with a certain size and so
[1:28:24] he's a logger he knows what he's doing
[1:28:26] he knows how to do it so he goes down
[1:28:28] there and he finds the log he cuts it
[1:28:31] down but then he tries to move it and he
[1:28:33] can't move it.
[1:28:36] He moves and all of his best efforts and
[1:28:38] all of his best, all of his strength, he
[1:28:41] can't move the lock. But then all of the
[1:28:44] sudden he hears a voice and he thought
[1:28:46] it was the voice, Amen, the sweetest
[1:28:48] voice. It was like the voice of his
[1:28:50] boss. But when he turns around, it was
[1:28:52] the Lord Jesus.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Paul, why are you fighting
[1:28:56] against it?" He said, "There's a stream
[1:28:58] right there. Roll it in the stream and
[1:29:01] ride on it." And Paul, amen, be to
[1:29:05] scream, "I'm riding on it. I'm riding on
[1:29:08] it."
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "Amen." He
[1:29:12] says, "Brother, sister, Jesus Christ
[1:29:14] promised these things to happen in the
[1:29:16] last days. I believe that we are living
[1:29:18] here. I believe that he's the same
[1:29:20] yesterday, today, and forever. I don't
[1:29:22] know how it's happened, but I'm riding
[1:29:24] on it. I believe that it's the truth
[1:29:27] because it's the gospel, God's provided
[1:29:30] way. I believe it's the message of the
[1:29:32] hour, the time that we're living in.
[1:29:34] It's God's provided way. I'm riding on
[1:29:37] it. Oh, live or die. I'm riding on it.
[1:29:41] I'm not fussing with it. I'm not trying
[1:29:44] to fuss about it. I'm just hook I'm just
[1:29:47] hooking. I'm riding on it. Let the
[1:29:49] critics rise. I shoot every riffle. I'm
[1:29:51] coming into camp one of these days
[1:29:53] riding on the word of God. I'm certain
[1:29:56] to arrive there.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, it's grace.
[1:30:01] Don't have to fuss about it. Don't have
[1:30:03] to argue about it. Just get in it.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to debate with the
[1:30:08] message. We're not debating about the
[1:30:10] message. We're not fighting this one
[1:30:12] about this one about the message. We're
[1:30:15] getting in the message.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And the message is the power of Jesus
[1:30:19] Christ under redemption, under
[1:30:22] salvation, under rapture,
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; riding on it.
[1:30:28] I can look at my family and say, "I know
[1:30:30] we're going to make it." They say, "How?
[1:30:32] How, honey? How, Dad?" I'm riding on it.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; God promised me my wife. God promised me
[1:30:37] my home. God promised me my children.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something that may
[1:30:42] blow some people's socks off. I don't
[1:30:44] have serpent seed. I've got sons and
[1:30:47] I've got a daughter.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; And they are they are predestinated
[1:30:52] seed. And you can't talk me out of it.
[1:30:55] I'm riding on it. I claim their souls. I
[1:30:59] claim their souls. I hold it. I am
[1:31:02] holding up my token with my Godgiven
[1:31:06] faith. And I know it's going to be by
[1:31:08] the grace of God.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I've towed the line with every devil in
[1:31:15] hell.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And I say Satan is defeated.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; The sword is in my hand.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We're fighting a battle.
[1:31:25] And we're Christian soldiers
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; trampling every devil under our feet.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would give us another
[1:31:33] example
[1:31:35] of grace.
[1:31:37] He would say in the sermon, "Humble
[1:31:39] thyself."
[1:31:41] He would say, "How that was a minister
[1:31:45] and he told one of his congregation, he
[1:31:47] said, you know, you think that I can
[1:31:50] walk this log?" And he said, "Yeah,
[1:31:52] sure, pastor. The Lord is with you.
[1:31:54] How many of us house ministers heard
[1:31:57] that you pastors? Oh, sure,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; pastor. You can do anything.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's that's kind of the way everyone
[1:32:05] looks at the prophet. Oh, if the prophet
[1:32:07] was here, if the prophet was here,
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; it's only with the prophet.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; The bride's revival is the prophet's
[1:32:13] revival. Well, I I'm I'm sorry. I I
[1:32:17] don't mean to be confrontational, but it
[1:32:19] it's just not true. Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; I I the problem of it is I may be
[1:32:24] ignorant, but I'm not that ignorant.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I can read the Bible. I read the message
[1:32:31] and I see that the spirit is bearing
[1:32:33] witness with my spirit is for me.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; This bride's revival is my revival.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; So much so that I heard a prophet say
[1:32:42] that I am the revival.
[1:32:45] If you want to see the bride's revival
[1:32:47] in action today, and you're looking at
[1:32:49] it,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; you're looking at an overcomer, you're
[1:32:52] looking at a son of God that has stepped
[1:32:54] into my dispensation, and I'm saying,
[1:32:56] "Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:32:58] that is in the world." I'm riding on
[1:33:00] this victory.
[1:33:03] I'm riding on this power.
[1:33:06] It's taking me to my bridegroom.
[1:33:10] All I've got to do is just keep watering
[1:33:12] it. Keep watering this camel. Keep
[1:33:14] watering this p this power and my and my
[1:33:17] eleaser is telling me everything I need
[1:33:19] to know and I know him in the power of
[1:33:23] his resurrection.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Well, sure pastor, you can do it. Then
[1:33:33] the pastor says, "Well, I I can pack a
[1:33:35] log across my back when I go across."
[1:33:37] Sure. The Lord is with you, pastor.
[1:33:41] He says, "Well, I I can pack a log and
[1:33:44] and and and and will a wheel will be
[1:33:46] barrel across at the same time." Oh,
[1:33:47] sure, pastor. The Lord is with you. Your
[1:33:50] faith can do anything.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "I can put you in the
[1:33:55] wheelbarrow and pack the log." Wait a
[1:33:58] minute.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet says it's different
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; when you're included in it yourself.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Let that sink in real deep. It's
[1:34:10] different when you're the revival.
[1:34:14] You're the overcomer. You've got the
[1:34:17] sword in your hand. You're the one
[1:34:19] that's overcoming those giants in your
[1:34:21] life. You're the one that is a part of
[1:34:25] this third pull. I don't see myself in
[1:34:28] the first two pools. I don't have a sign
[1:34:30] of Messiah. I don't have the sign in my
[1:34:32] hand. But I do see myself in that third
[1:34:35] pull. I see myself a part of this word
[1:34:38] vision. I see myself going from glory to
[1:34:42] glory, from victory to victory.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Now, some people want to point out all
[1:34:49] of the valleys. And let me tell you
[1:34:51] something. I'm the guy in the valley. I
[1:34:53] know all about the valley.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; I know about all of those demons telling
[1:34:57] me I can't make it. I know about all of
[1:34:59] the sickness and the discouragement
[1:35:01] telling me that I'm never going to make
[1:35:02] it. I know all about the ba the valleys.
[1:35:05] So, don't try to drag me back into the
[1:35:07] valley. But I just want to tell you the
[1:35:09] faith in my soul is upon a mountain pe a
[1:35:12] mountain top and that mountaintop is not
[1:35:14] in the valley but it's it's it's
[1:35:17] standing tall and it's saying I'm an
[1:35:19] overcomer devil. Greater is he greater
[1:35:22] is this conqueror. Greater is this uh
[1:35:25] lily of the valley that's just opium the
[1:35:28] anointing of the Holy Ghost bubbling in
[1:35:30] my soul.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I don't need someone telling me all
[1:35:36] about the valley.
[1:35:38] I know the burdens on my shoulders. I
[1:35:41] know the sickness. I know about the
[1:35:43] discouragement. But what about the faith
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; that'll get me out of this leashia
[1:35:50] mess?
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; It's different when you're included in
[1:36:00] it.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; You know, well, you can't shout. you
[1:36:03] know, you just you're shouting too much
[1:36:05] because your fruits will freeze up
[1:36:06] there.
[1:36:08] Why do we have to have preachers tell us
[1:36:10] of that all the time?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; We're the ones living it.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; You're the ones living in it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, it's it's it's in
[1:36:21] the valley and it's up on the mountain.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; But you know what the scripture has
[1:36:26] taught me? I can shout and I can dance
[1:36:29] on the mountain. And I can dance and I
[1:36:31] can shout on the valley.
[1:36:34] The Bible didn't tell me that I stop
[1:36:36] being a priest when I'm in the valley.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; It's a sacrifice of praise.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And it didn't say that you stop being
[1:36:44] victorious when you're in the valley.
[1:36:46] And dancing is a sign of victory. And I
[1:36:48] think we need to dance the more when
[1:36:50] we're in the valley.
[1:36:53] Let the devil know whose side you're on.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That you're not just a mountaintop
[1:36:59] Christian.
[1:37:02] I'm
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; so sick of people trying to say I'm just
[1:37:04] a mountaintop Christian. I am a
[1:37:07] Christian.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I am a Christian in the valley. I am in
[1:37:11] the Christian when I'm trying to keep my
[1:37:12] head above the river. I am a Christian
[1:37:15] on Monday, on Tuesday. I don't need
[1:37:18] someone trying to tell me you need to
[1:37:20] tone it down. I'll just say this. The
[1:37:22] concord that is in me refuses to knock
[1:37:26] down for the devil.
[1:37:30] Ah.
[1:37:32] I I I just Sister Christine, you've been
[1:37:34] a blessing to me. I just want you to
[1:37:36] know I never even knew that she was
[1:37:38] going through a trial.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; The smile on her face, the bubble in her
[1:37:43] spirit.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Why? Why someone had to actually tell me
[1:37:46] that she almost died
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; and the devil's been trying to destroy
[1:37:49] her life?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It's because there's something within a
[1:37:53] believer.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Now, now do whatever you want to with
[1:38:00] that. That was free of charge.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you, finish this
[1:38:06] what a prophet says. It's different when
[1:38:08] you're included in it yourself.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Now that it's mighty good for us to stay
[1:38:13] to say here, amen. It's mighty good for
[1:38:16] us to say, "I believe that's true." But
[1:38:19] then put it in action.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to put it in action. It's
[1:38:23] it's it's wonderful to hear about the
[1:38:25] opening of the word and the seals. And
[1:38:26] we are not mystery preachers. Every
[1:38:28] mystery concerning this bride has been
[1:38:29] revealed.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; There has been an understanding. The
[1:38:33] wise shall know their God, and they
[1:38:35] shall do great exploits.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; But with that, you got to put your faith
[1:38:41] into action.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God put us in the
[1:38:45] wheelbarrow.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Now, you put your faith into action.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; You got to get in the message. Yeah.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; You see, the bride has recognized her
[1:38:55] message
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; and has recognized this is her hour of
[1:38:58] visitation and this is her season of
[1:39:00] deliverance. Quite frankly, it's her
[1:39:02] season of grace.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; She realizes that the grace of God is
[1:39:07] the inspiration over her life.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; To empower her.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That word empower means to liberate.
[1:39:15] is to liberate her to to believe to to
[1:39:19] release that that deep calling unto the
[1:39:22] deep
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; to realize that that everything that God
[1:39:25] put in her before the foundation of the
[1:39:27] world now it's her time to manifest
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; you see it's a it's a conquering grace
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; and as we heard this morning you can't
[1:39:38] have grace without love
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; because they're the same thing the
[1:39:42] prophet of God says that that that that
[1:39:44] grace is love and love is grace and and
[1:39:47] and this this capstone is charity.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; It's grace.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; And we're in this season, the anointing
[1:39:56] of grace.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I know the world has turned grace
[1:40:00] into disgrace.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; But the bride is the one who's needing
[1:40:04] grace. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; The rest of everyone is going to go
[1:40:08] through the tribulation period
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; and they're going to be washed
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; through trump through through the
[1:40:14] tribulation.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; And we believe that there's going to be
[1:40:19] thousands, maybe even millions that make
[1:40:21] it.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; That are not even bride.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; But it's the bride of Christ that needs
[1:40:27] the blood. Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; It's the bride of Christ that needs
[1:40:31] grace
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; because it's her responsibility to
[1:40:35] manifest the promised son.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, prove that." Okay. The
[1:40:41] prophet of God would say, notice elect
[1:40:45] come from the word elected lady. One
[1:40:47] lady amongst all the other ladies was
[1:40:49] elected.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; And then he says, like the virgin was to
[1:40:53] bring forth the body of God on the
[1:40:56] earth. She was an elected woman.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; God chose Mary. And also God has chose
[1:41:03] an elected lady which is his bride.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says there's got
[1:41:10] to be a place prepared for the word to
[1:41:13] be made manifest. And I say that's what
[1:41:16] this son of man anointing is grace that
[1:41:19] has prepared our hearts to believe for
[1:41:22] all things to manifest the promised son.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a place that has been
[1:41:30] prepared. I believe that I've been
[1:41:31] prepared for this time.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; I I I believe that the baton there
[1:41:36] there's been brothers that have been
[1:41:38] running the race over the last 60 years,
[1:41:40] but I believe it's my turn.
[1:41:44] I believe the baton is in my hand.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I believe that I just believe, amen,
[1:41:50] that there's a generation that is going
[1:41:52] to finish the race.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And it's when you're going to finish the
[1:41:58] race. It's the last leg of the race.
[1:42:01] That's when you're exhausted.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; That's when you want to quit.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; That's when your muscles are trying to
[1:42:07] seize up. at that that's when all of the
[1:42:12] training kicks in.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; The training doesn't kick in at the
[1:42:16] beginning,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; not even at the middle, but it's the
[1:42:20] last section of the race. I tell you
[1:42:22] friends, the preparation of this
[1:42:24] vindicated message has got us to this
[1:42:27] point. And now is the time you got to
[1:42:30] dig down deep and say, "I'm a son of
[1:42:32] God. I've been birthed under this
[1:42:35] vindicated message. It's not by my
[1:42:37] might. It's not by my power. But it's by
[1:42:40] the spirit of grace that is working in
[1:42:44] my life.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; As I've already told you, we're under
[1:42:49] the greatest vindication of omnipotent
[1:42:51] omnipotence the world has ever known.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We've heard omnipotence speaking and we
[1:42:57] are the miraculous that has taken place.
[1:43:01] Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; And in this day there will be a will
[1:43:06] willing people in the day of his power.
[1:43:09] Amen. That is spontaneous. That's that's
[1:43:11] what that word willing means.
[1:43:13] Spontaneous. Our little sister when I
[1:43:15] held up that do that money. But someone
[1:43:17] else was spontaneous. It even surprised
[1:43:19] me.
[1:43:22] Someone else had had done this program
[1:43:24] before.
[1:43:26] And I tell you that's exactly our
[1:43:28] expectation. There should be something
[1:43:30] down in our heart while the word is
[1:43:32] being preached. There should be
[1:43:33] something that says, "Yes, that's me.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's mine. Yes, that's my
[1:43:38] promise."
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; And as we're reaching out, healing's
[1:43:41] taking place. Joy is being restored.
[1:43:44] Salvation is being ministered. It's
[1:43:46] because there's omnipotence.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Omnipotence is coming to omnipotence
[1:43:52] through the power of your agreement with
[1:43:54] the word.
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:43:57] Now, I'm getting to somewhere because
[1:44:00] the prophet of God says the seven
[1:44:02] thunders
[1:44:03] of Revelations 10 has unlocked the
[1:44:06] mysteries of the entire Bible.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of people have made
[1:44:10] false doctrines out of that, the
[1:44:12] thunders, but let's just make it very
[1:44:14] simple. A thunder is the voice of God.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And the thunders are the mysteries that
[1:44:23] were contained in the seals. And now we
[1:44:26] see oursel in an open book
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; because it's no longer thundering. It's
[1:44:31] the voice of God personally to you.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; No mystery, no confusion. It's just God
[1:44:38] speaking to his wife.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Now, now why did John have to seal it
[1:44:44] up? Why did Daniel seal it up?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Because he was waiting for this time.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And God did it for the purpose. Now, now
[1:44:52] I want you to catch this now. giving
[1:44:55] faith for that rapture rapturing grace
[1:44:58] for that church.
[1:45:00] The thunders were revealed in the last
[1:45:03] days to give faith for rapturing grace.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; You see, it's going to take grace.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; But not just any kind of grace. It's
[1:45:14] going to take rapturing grace.
[1:45:18] It's going to take something so powerful
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; that'll take your humanity
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; and it'll be a bleach of his blood that
[1:45:25] washes you spotless white that you can
[1:45:28] stand there under the freedom of the
[1:45:31] Holy Ghost and say, "I am free. I am
[1:45:34] clean. There is therefore no
[1:45:37] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:45:39] Jesus. I am made perfect by one
[1:45:43] sacrifice
[1:45:46] and the blood of the word just keeps
[1:45:49] washing.
[1:45:51] When I find out there's something else
[1:45:53] that needs to be out of my life, I'm
[1:45:54] under the blood and I just say, "God,
[1:45:56] forgive me of it." And there's a grace
[1:45:59] that washes me.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; There's a grace that allows myself to
[1:46:05] see when I'm needing to make something
[1:46:08] right. It's grace that shows me that.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's grace that is changing me.
[1:46:14] It's changing my direction. It's
[1:46:15] changing how I view my situation. It's
[1:46:18] grace that changes how I'm viewing life,
[1:46:20] how I'm viewing my trial, how I'm
[1:46:22] viewing my family, how I'm viewing my
[1:46:24] own complexes. It's grace that has
[1:46:28] worked in the supernatural in my life.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, the opening of the
[1:46:39] word came to give faith for that rapture
[1:46:42] in grace.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And the world can't understand it.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; But Christ came to show you, to show the
[1:46:49] bride how to prepare for the great
[1:46:53] translation, faith.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; He's showing you how to prepare
[1:46:59] to be changed,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; to have a faith
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; that'll change you in the moment, in the
[1:47:04] twinkling of an eye.
[1:47:06] Okay. Okay. I I'm I'm ready. I want to
[1:47:09] be a scholar.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; I want to be taught.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be prepared for this great
[1:47:13] translation faith.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Well, the prophet of God would begin to
[1:47:17] teach us just only believe.
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; brings us to a a message called perfect
[1:47:32] faith.
[1:47:33] And he starts out not in confusion. He
[1:47:37] just starts out simply saying just take
[1:47:38] God at his word.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Let's just simplify the whole thing. You
[1:47:43] want translation faith, say what the
[1:47:46] word says.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You want to be prepared to be changed in
[1:47:49] a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[1:47:51] just go through life saying, "Yes to the
[1:47:53] word. Yes to the promise. Yes, I'm a son
[1:47:56] of God. Yes, I'm a daughter of God. Yes,
[1:47:59] I'm an overcomer. Yes, greater is he
[1:48:01] that is in me. Yes. Yes, my family will
[1:48:04] be saved. Yes, this trial is to mold
[1:48:07] character in my life. Yes.
[1:48:11] Yes.
[1:48:13] Yes. I'm healed. Yes. The joy of the
[1:48:15] Lord is my strength. Yes. I am not a
[1:48:19] part of dark denominationalism.
[1:48:21] I'm a part of the liberated bride that
[1:48:24] is stimulated with the new wine of the
[1:48:27] Holy Ghost.
[1:48:30] [Applause]
[1:48:33] You don't need a great education. You
[1:48:35] don't need to be a scholar at the
[1:48:36] message.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Seminary,
[1:48:41] you just got to listen to this message
[1:48:43] and say yes to it.
[1:48:48] Enoch walked with God and was not for
[1:48:50] God took him. He just was simply saying
[1:48:51] yes,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; yes. He was the seventh from Adam. He
[1:48:56] was your type. You're not a type of
[1:48:58] Enoch. He was your type.
[1:49:01] And God put it in the scripture so you
[1:49:03] could go back to your type and say,
[1:49:05] "Well,
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; all Enoch did was just walk with God."
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "If you're
[1:49:12] going through sickness, walk with God.
[1:49:14] You're going through trials, walk with
[1:49:16] God. Your family's falling apart, walk
[1:49:19] with God. The devil's trying to defeat
[1:49:21] you, walk with God. The devil says,
[1:49:23] "Hey, I've got you now." Walk with God.
[1:49:26] Just walk with God. Footsteps means
[1:49:28] possession. Victory upon victory,
[1:49:30] possessing your promised land
[1:49:32] inheritance, and all the sudden
[1:49:35] translation faith.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Don't have to work it up. Don't have to
[1:49:41] work it down. Don't have to pray it into
[1:49:43] existence. You are what you are by the
[1:49:46] grace of God.
[1:49:52] Let me look at you young people. You you
[1:49:54] young men for a second. You're going to
[1:49:56] make it.
[1:49:58] You're the overcomers of this age.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; And I say this that with the utmost
[1:50:03] confidence, not because I'm looking at
[1:50:05] your hairstyles. Amen. You got longer
[1:50:07] hair than him, so he's got a he's he's
[1:50:09] got to be. And I'm jealous of your hair,
[1:50:10] by the way. Why can't I have hair like
[1:50:13] that? But anyways, getting off subject.
[1:50:19] I'm not over here looking at the sister
[1:50:20] saying, "Well, you know, her her skirt's
[1:50:22] a little bit longer than hers, so she's
[1:50:24] definitely going." And uh you know what?
[1:50:26] And uh oh, she got a beautiful smile. So
[1:50:28] I bet I bet God's looking at her and
[1:50:32] I'm looking at a promise.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at your hang-ups. I'm
[1:50:40] not looking at at how the devil is
[1:50:43] entrapping you and and going to pull you
[1:50:44] out this way or pull you out this way. I
[1:50:47] am looking at a at a covenant.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; It is unconditional and it's by the
[1:50:53] grace of God.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; And it's Christ the descendant as the
[1:50:57] covenant of God to make good every
[1:51:00] promise. I have a bride without spot,
[1:51:04] without wrinkle, without blemish. And
[1:51:06] it's his responsibility to save you,
[1:51:09] rapture you, fill you with the Holy
[1:51:12] Ghost.
[1:51:17] I can't work it up. I can't work it
[1:51:19] down.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Be careful. I'm starting to feel good.
[1:51:31] You see, he's he's he's preparing you to
[1:51:34] believe for all things.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; You got to He's preparing you to break
[1:51:39] through your own sound barrier.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Some people get scared of noise. I'll
[1:51:44] tell you what that noise is about. It's
[1:51:46] an atomic blast. It's an aon sonic boom
[1:51:49] because some people are breaking through
[1:51:50] their own sound barrier.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; They've come in contact with angels.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; They've come in contact with grace.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Half of the time people are shouting and
[1:52:01] rejoicing and you don't even know what
[1:52:03] they're shouting about. It's because
[1:52:05] last week the devil was dragging them
[1:52:07] into Leosa. But now they're free by the
[1:52:10] grace of God.
[1:52:15] If you got your old critical spirits,
[1:52:18] let that old hateful spirit. Why? Look
[1:52:21] at them. You know what? I pray to God
[1:52:24] that we all break past our own sound
[1:52:26] barrier.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Break past our own dogmas. Break past
[1:52:30] our own reasoning. Break past our
[1:52:32] circles. Break get into the message.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Get into Christ. Get into the passion of
[1:52:38] Jesus Christ, which is having a love for
[1:52:41] one another.
[1:52:46] If we said what a prophet said, we'd
[1:52:47] find out that maybe sometimes we don't
[1:52:49] have enough victory.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Ah, man. I told you I'm feeling good. I
[1:52:57] don't have money in the bank,
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; but it's my last service.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; You better be scared. It's my last
[1:53:07] service.
[1:53:17] denominational strongholds.
[1:53:21] You say, "Oh, we we've come out of those
[1:53:23] denominations." Yeah. Well, nickelanism
[1:53:27] is a spirit.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; And it's preachers trying to conquer the
[1:53:31] ley,
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; telling them what they could believe,
[1:53:35] what not to believe, who could to listen
[1:53:37] to.
[1:53:38] Well, that's just with a prophet.
[1:53:41] Nickelanism.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just for our church.
[1:53:45] Nicoleism.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God came here to
[1:53:49] break the strongholds. And where the
[1:53:51] spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[1:53:54] And the Lord himself has descended.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And the covenant is in full effect.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Which means I can believe for anything
[1:54:04] that is in my covenant promise.
[1:54:08] I don't need permission.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I don't need a pope.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I don't need a high priest other than
[1:54:15] Christ Jesus.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I don't need someone to come and beg for
[1:54:19] their for their permission to believe
[1:54:21] for my body change, to believe for my
[1:54:24] revival.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; I'm in grace
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; and I can believe for anything that I
[1:54:30] see in this word.
[1:54:34] Now you see I told you the other night
[1:54:37] we're under an eagle anointing
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; and this then the prophet of God said
[1:54:42] don't forget this church
[1:54:44] cuz how could men do anything else
[1:54:46] besides the power of God that had been
[1:54:47] released to them.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; This is an earth not an earthbound
[1:54:51] anointing.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; This is not a I'll box you in anointing.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; This is a I'll make the circle bigger
[1:54:59] anointing.
[1:55:01] Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; This is anointing that we see in
[1:55:04] Revelation the 4th chapter that the same
[1:55:07] voice in Revelations 1 is saying now
[1:55:10] come up higher John.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Come out of that lukewarm condition.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Come where the power of God is falling
[1:55:18] and revelation is stimulating.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; You see, we've we've heard a and
[1:55:24] received a message of grace and this
[1:55:27] message didn't come like a motivational
[1:55:29] talk.
[1:55:31] Have y'all ever heard of those TED
[1:55:32] talks?
[1:55:35] You know, every everyone wants a good
[1:55:36] TED talk to motivate them. And and and
[1:55:41] if you're want to be a good businessman
[1:55:42] and have business smarts, then you find
[1:55:44] someone that's successful and then you
[1:55:46] go listen to it and and and and you make
[1:55:49] your notes and and then you try to go
[1:55:52] live that carry it out. But you see, the
[1:55:56] message didn't come as a good TED talk.
[1:55:58] It's not something trying to motivate
[1:56:00] us.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; The message came in power and
[1:56:05] vindication.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; To convince you, the bride of your
[1:56:09] position.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; You see, the power of God recognizing
[1:56:15] your day in this message will put the
[1:56:17] people in the bride.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; The world forces this way and the world
[1:56:22] forces that way, but God forces upward.
[1:56:24] The spirit of God, which is the word of
[1:56:26] God, my word is spirit and life, will
[1:56:28] put the bride in her place, her
[1:56:31] adoption.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; That's what placing is. It's your
[1:56:35] adoption. She'll cause she'll recognize
[1:56:38] her position in the word. Then she's in
[1:56:42] Christ will put her in her place.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; You see, I I I'm looking at a grace
[1:56:50] woman.
[1:56:51] I know that's not proper English, but
[1:56:53] it's just the way that I'm trying to
[1:56:54] convey it in my heart. I'm looking at a
[1:56:56] grace woman. I'm looking at what the
[1:56:59] prophet of God would say. You are Mrs.
[1:57:02] Grace.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; You see, you have been endowed or
[1:57:06] empowered
[1:57:08] with unmmerited
[1:57:11] and unlimited.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; You say unlimited?
[1:57:17] Well, yeah, because the bride can't even
[1:57:21] blasphe
[1:57:24] now. You're saying you're stepping out
[1:57:25] on a limb. No, I'm in the message.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said that there
[1:57:30] is so much confidence that God has in
[1:57:32] this bride that she is going to be in
[1:57:35] the bride and in the rapture. This bride
[1:57:38] will not fail.
[1:57:40] Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a season of grace
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; that you can have faith in grace like we
[1:57:50] have never had before.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; You say you're just making that up. No,
[1:57:53] I'm not. It's the message of the hour
[1:57:57] and it's the season of maturity to be
[1:58:00] able to look at grace and see in your
[1:58:04] heart. I'm wanting to manifest all of
[1:58:06] these promises, but I keep getting it my
[1:58:09] own way.
[1:58:11] But there's a deep calling to the deep
[1:58:14] and the and the spirit of God is saying,
[1:58:16] "Look at my message. I've already
[1:58:19] prepared the way."
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Quit looking at the different pastors.
[1:58:24] Quit looking at the past. The prophet of
[1:58:26] God says, "You look at the past, you're
[1:58:28] going to wreck up.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's coming."
[1:58:37] The prophet of God gave us another
[1:58:39] little illustration about a about a bike
[1:58:41] race. Y'all y'all remember that?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; And how that if if if they win a city
[1:58:46] block riding a plank about six inches
[1:58:49] wide and and if they could do this this
[1:58:54] deal this ride this plank without
[1:58:56] falling off, they would win a brand new
[1:59:00] Swin bicycle.
[1:59:02] And all of them were good riders. Y'all
[1:59:05] like riding bikes? Does anyone like
[1:59:06] riding bikes still? Yeah. And and and
[1:59:09] and they could they could go to the
[1:59:10] store and get groceries for mama and
[1:59:13] they could hold those groceries in their
[1:59:14] arms and and they didn't even have to
[1:59:16] hold on to the hold on to the uh what do
[1:59:19] you call that thing?
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Handlebars.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Don't even have to hold on to the
[1:59:26] handlebars. And they're just making the
[1:59:28] corners and they're just riding. Don't
[1:59:30] even have to worry about it. There was
[1:59:32] another boy. He was just kind of the
[1:59:36] kind of the nerd
[1:59:39] kind of kind of the kid that you know he
[1:59:41] wasn't the cool guy
[1:59:44] and he had to hold on to his handlebars
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; and everyone were like well he's he's
[1:59:50] going to come into the race but we're
[1:59:51] not worried about him.
[1:59:54] And he began to watch him and one by one
[1:59:57] all of these good riders fell off. One
[2:00:00] by one fell off. But when it was his
[2:00:03] turn, he grabbed those handlebars extra
[2:00:05] tight.
[2:00:07] But you know what? He finished.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; He went all the way.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; They all came to him as a celebrity and
[2:00:14] said, "How did you do it?"
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "We know we're better writers
[2:00:18] than you." He said, "That's right, boys.
[2:00:19] You're better writers than I am." He
[2:00:21] said, "But I'm going to tell you the
[2:00:22] secret.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; I had the privilege of watching you,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; and I noticed that you kept looking
[2:00:30] down.
[2:00:33] You were, now I'm going to tell you how
[2:00:35] the prophet said it. You were worried
[2:00:37] about this one. You were worried about
[2:00:39] that one.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; You were listening to what this preacher
[2:00:41] was saying.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; You were listening to what that critic
[2:00:44] was saying.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "But when I got on there, I
[2:00:48] learned from your mistakes."
[2:00:51] Well, I just want to say that there is a
[2:00:54] season of riders that we have learned
[2:00:57] from the past,
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; but we are not fearful of the past. We
[2:01:01] are the riders that have the baton in
[2:01:04] our hand and we're going to finish the
[2:01:06] race.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the secret of it is we're
[2:01:10] not looking at what this one says and
[2:01:13] what that one says. Our ears are plugged
[2:01:16] to what the critic says. We believe this
[2:01:19] message.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; We know that we are anointed to finish
[2:01:24] as the mighty victorious conquers of the
[2:01:28] age.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; We've been endowed with unmmerited
[2:01:34] favor.
[2:01:36] It's that very favor that changed Ra
[2:01:38] Rahab's status
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; from a harlot to a lady that was married
[2:01:43] to a famous general
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; that she was no longer Rahab the harlot.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Her status had been changed.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; It was this unmmerited favor that came
[2:01:53] upon Tamar that even though it looked
[2:01:55] like she played the part of a harlot and
[2:01:57] she did but it was God grace to give her
[2:02:00] seed
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; and it was grace that put Rahab in the
[2:02:04] lineage of Christ. Tamar and the lineage
[2:02:06] of Christ and everyone else could point
[2:02:08] their fingers, but it was grace.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; It was grace when Sarah part of the
[2:02:15] lineage of Christ. But yet with all of
[2:02:17] her complexes, unbelief, and yet son of
[2:02:19] man came and told her, "You're not
[2:02:22] church any longer. You are Sarah, a
[2:02:25] princess with God."
[2:02:29] It was Esther who was an orphan girl but
[2:02:33] yet came with the right attitude to the
[2:02:35] chamberlain.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; All the other ladies wanted to wear
[2:02:38] whatever they wanted to, but not not not
[2:02:41] Esther. She had a she had a spirit that
[2:02:45] said, "I want to be dressed the way that
[2:02:47] you say the king likes it."
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; And when she stepped into into the
[2:02:52] presence of the king, she found grace.
[2:02:56] And then she found out what it was all
[2:02:58] about. She was there for such a time as
[2:03:00] this.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; The king positionally placed her in a
[2:03:05] place where she could intercede for her
[2:03:06] people for such a time as this.
[2:03:12] Now,
[2:03:14] Satan has tried to hybrid this bride,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; but but again, the prophet of God says
[2:03:19] the power of God will raise the bride
[2:03:21] into glory out of all the denominations,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; all the high breeding.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; You see, I'm I'm going to skip way down.
[2:03:31] We could go into a lot of good stuff,
[2:03:34] but I've been having too much fun.
[2:03:38] You see this ministry,
[2:03:43] the son of man ministry
[2:03:46] is to make the word so real
[2:03:50] to bring an invisible union.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call has come through
[2:03:57] this message
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; to unite you to the capstone
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; and that is the that is your husband.
[2:04:08] And it's grace grace over your life.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't marry you and then try to beat
[2:04:15] you into submission.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; He married you out of love. He married
[2:04:22] you because you were in the hundred
[2:04:24] parts of his mind before the foundation
[2:04:26] of the world. And he's been waiting for
[2:04:28] this season of grace to reveal who you
[2:04:30] are.
[2:04:34] We we have come into such a perfect
[2:04:37] union.
[2:04:39] Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and
[2:04:41] his church when the flesh is becoming
[2:04:43] word and the word is becoming flesh
[2:04:46] manifested vindicated.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say there's
[2:04:50] been churches, churches, brides, brides,
[2:04:52] churches, brides, brides. But there has
[2:04:54] got to come one. There has to come a
[2:04:57] real bride. There must come one that's
[2:04:59] not only got the mechanics but the
[2:05:00] dynamics of it makes that church live
[2:05:04] move in the power of his resurrection.
[2:05:07] The move is on.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at this mighty move of God.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for a bride to come. I'm
[2:05:16] saying you're it.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Now we're fighting a real devil.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Will you give me just a little bit more
[2:05:26] time?
[2:05:28] We're fighting a real devil.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says in the
[2:05:32] sermon, "How can I overcome?" He says,
[2:05:34] "You've got to recognize him real."
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; This is not mind over matter.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; It's not psychology.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; It's not, well, I'm just going to ignore
[2:05:43] my problems and it'll go away.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; And my mind is stronger than than what
[2:05:48] I'm going through. It's stronger than my
[2:05:50] symptoms. And one of these days, it's
[2:05:52] just going to disappear. Disappear.
[2:05:54] Nothing.
[2:05:56] You are fighting a real devil.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Let let let's just face the reality of
[2:06:01] this. There's a devil after your souls.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; There's a devil that's trying to wreck
[2:06:06] you up and destroy you and drag you to
[2:06:08] hell. It's a real devil.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "Now, the
[2:06:12] secret to overcoming is first you got to
[2:06:15] recognize that he's a real devil."
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; You can't say, "Well, you know, uh, you
[2:06:21] know, you're diagnosed with cancer."
[2:06:22] Then you say, "Nope, I don't have
[2:06:24] cancer.
[2:06:25] No, you got cancer.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; And that cancer is a demon that's trying
[2:06:31] to take your life.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Now, these the prophet's words.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "But then at the same time that
[2:06:37] you recognize that the devil is real and
[2:06:40] he's out to destroy you."
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Then you've got to recognize that Jesus
[2:06:46] Christ has already did battle with the
[2:06:49] devil and he has already overcome the
[2:06:52] devil. and greater is he that is in you
[2:06:56] than he that is in the world.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; So to recognize that the devil is a real
[2:07:04] devil is not to give him preeminence
[2:07:06] over your life. It's just only
[2:07:09] recognizing your adversary.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Now that's why when John was weeping, he
[2:07:17] was weeping because
[2:07:20] there was no one worthy to open the
[2:07:22] seals. Revelation the 5th chapter he
[2:07:25] said but then that then there's an angel
[2:07:27] a messenger that says weep not John for
[2:07:29] the line of the tribe of Judah hath
[2:07:31] prevailed and when he turned to see a a
[2:07:33] lion he saw a lamb
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; it was the prophet of God says it was a
[2:07:37] lamb that had been in battle.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; It was a lamb that was bloody. It was a
[2:07:42] lamb that had been torn and he did it
[2:07:45] all for you.
[2:07:47] The lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[2:07:51] prevailed.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; So it's a real devil, but the lamb took
[2:07:57] your place and he has already conquered
[2:08:01] death, hell, and the grave. And if you
[2:08:05] can by the message of the hour, give the
[2:08:08] word preeminence, you can see that
[2:08:12] greater is this mighty conqueror in you.
[2:08:17] than your symptoms,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; then your struggles,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; then your heartaches.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Y'all see that?
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a real devil.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to go, you you came to this
[2:08:29] camp fighting battles and you're going
[2:08:31] to go back and still fight battles.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; But the revelation
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; is that there's omnipotence on the
[2:08:39] earth, all powerful,
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; and the power of God is greater than the
[2:08:43] power of the devil. And that mighty
[2:08:46] conqueror is living in you,
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; giving you grace
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; to defeat the devil in your flesh.
[2:08:57] [Music]
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God says, "You got to
[2:09:00] tow the line." You know what to the line
[2:09:01] is? Can you stand up for a second? I'm
[2:09:04] not trying to embarrass you, but
[2:09:07] you're there and you're you're trying to
[2:09:09] bluff me and you probably could do it.
[2:09:14] But I've got to believe
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; that it's not by my might. It's not by
[2:09:18] my power,
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; but it's by my spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; And I've got to tow the line. You know
[2:09:24] what that You know what that means? It
[2:09:26] means that you got your fist up. I've
[2:09:29] got to put I got to stand there right
[2:09:31] there
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; and I got to put my fist up and I got to
[2:09:35] have a revelation that you're a bluff.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Now, you're trying to get me to back up,
[2:09:41] but I know is he that is in me than he
[2:09:44] that's in you.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; And even though you're saying I can whip
[2:09:47] you any day of the week,
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; I've got to tow the line and say you're
[2:09:52] a bluff
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; and I challenge you.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, I challenge you
[2:09:57] to a duel of faith.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; I believe that my God
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; is greater
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; than any power of hell that would try to
[2:10:06] defeat you.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; that's what you got to do. Yeah.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; So, you got to tow the line.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; You got to step up to the plate.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; And you got to say, "Satan,
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; in myself, I'm no match for you.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; But recognizing that that I am the
[2:10:25] dwelling place of Almighty God."
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look what the prophet of God
[2:10:30] says. We are dealing
[2:10:33] with a defeated enemy.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to get to it.
[2:10:38] Everything is defeated. Say everything.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Sickness is defeated. Death is defeated.
[2:10:46] Hell is defeated. Temptation is
[2:10:49] defeated.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against you shall
[2:10:53] prosper.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Because we are dealing with a defeated
[2:10:56] enemy. He conquered the gate of the
[2:10:59] grave and rose up on the third day for
[2:11:02] our justification. And now we are more
[2:11:05] than conquerors. We just walked right
[2:11:08] into it as an inheritance. More than
[2:11:11] conquerors, we are dealing with a
[2:11:13] defeated enemy. Sickness defeated, death
[2:11:15] defeated, hell defeated, everything's
[2:11:18] defeated. The prophet says, "I wish I
[2:11:20] was twice my size. Maybe I'd feel twice
[2:11:23] as good." Well, I'll tell you, that's
[2:11:24] the way I feel right now.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; We are disputing with a conquered enemy.
[2:11:31] But not only did he conquer it for us,
[2:11:33] but after 2,000 years, he now stands
[2:11:37] among us, vindicating that what he
[2:11:40] conquered on Calvary is in full effect.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; He is identifying himself the mighty
[2:11:48] conqueror. He's still alive here. He's
[2:11:51] still here alive, vindicating his
[2:11:54] promise, royal seed of Abraham. He'll
[2:11:57] conquer the gates of his enemy. He
[2:11:59] stands here alive to vindicate himself
[2:12:02] to who? Those predestinated seeds that
[2:12:06] can see it.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God. Now those
[2:12:10] possessing the gate of the enemy after
[2:12:11] trial. Now the prophet of God and the
[2:12:13] mighty God unveiled before us. He says
[2:12:16] he's he says doomed devils are on the
[2:12:20] run. He's the mighty conqueror. Doomed
[2:12:24] devils are on the run. They always are
[2:12:27] when he's around.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; That's what I've been trying to tell you
[2:12:31] for three services now. He's here.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Omnipotence is here.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And if you can believe in the grace of
[2:12:38] God that has been that has been
[2:12:40] propitiated, the headstone has come down
[2:12:43] and it's grace. Grace doomed devils.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Sickness is doomed. Hell is defeated.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Discouragement is defeated. Oppression
[2:12:55] is defeated. Fear is defeated.
[2:12:59] Homosexual spirits is defeated. Pride is
[2:13:02] defeated. Hate is defeated. Jealousy is
[2:13:05] defeated.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; This bride is not like the first Eve.
[2:13:11] She has predestinated to receive grace.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; She's predestinated not to fall. She's
[2:13:19] predestinated to prove to the devil
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; trial after trial and test after test.
[2:13:28] But she's anointed by grace
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; to put her shoulders back to the line,
[2:13:36] have the sword in her mouth and say,
[2:13:40] "Greater is he that is in me."
[2:13:43] Hebrews 13:80 is the same yesterday,
[2:13:46] today, and forever. The same anointing,
[2:13:48] the same word, the same Christ, the same
[2:13:52] covenant that was with William Brham,
[2:13:54] that he would not let one word fall to
[2:13:56] the ground is the same anointing that's
[2:13:59] upon this bride. That as long as you are
[2:14:02] confessing this message with the right
[2:14:05] attitude, with the right Holy Ghost
[2:14:08] anointing, it will not fall to the
[2:14:11] ground.
[2:14:13] [Applause]
[2:14:17] Doomed devils.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Doomed devils. What are you facing
[2:14:22] tonight? It's a doomed devil.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; You ready for some more?
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Now, what I'm doing is I'm giving you
[2:14:34] some ammunition.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; He's absolutely
[2:14:39] legally defeated in every place.
[2:14:44] legally.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Well, the prophet of God is showing us
[2:14:50] that when he was tempted by the devil,
[2:14:55] Jesus did not bypass the word.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; But he told the he told the line with
[2:15:02] the devil with it is written.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; He did not come to do away with the law.
[2:15:06] He come to fulfill the law.
[2:15:09] It was God the judge becoming our
[2:15:12] attorney. And he was skilled in the law
[2:15:15] to know how to defeat the devil.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And he knew that by the law he had to
[2:15:21] offer himself up on Calvary.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; The only way he could save you is
[2:15:27] through his blood.
[2:15:30] And because the lamb prevailed,
[2:15:33] he absolutely
[2:15:35] legally
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; defeated the devil in every place.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; The devil
[2:15:45] Oh, I feel like shouting.
[2:15:47] The devil hasn't got one legal right at
[2:15:51] all. Nowhere.
[2:15:56] He's just a devil
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; and a password. That's all.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; He hasn't got no legal right to any man
[2:16:04] that'll accept the promise of Jesus
[2:16:06] Christ. He's whipped. He's whipped in
[2:16:09] sickness. He's whipped in
[2:16:11] disappointments. He's whipped in
[2:16:13] everything. He's whipped in death. He
[2:16:16] can't scare me. He can't scare you.
[2:16:19] That's all he is is a big old shadow.
[2:16:22] So, he just might as well get on down
[2:16:24] the street.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; I just seen his red light go over the
[2:16:31] hill a while ago. Didn't you? He's gone.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Well, if the prophet of God said that, I
[2:16:38] say that's the word of the Lord for my
[2:16:40] life. The devil is defeated.
[2:16:46] I've seen his red lights. He cannot stay
[2:16:50] in the presence of God.
[2:16:53] But now listen,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; this is where your faith comes into
[2:16:57] action.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; You're in the wheelbarrow.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; You're a part of this third pull.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; You're a part of this faith in action.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Now the devil's left.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Let the sick say, "I'm healed."
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; I seen his red tail lights
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; go over the hill. You're healed.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got a demon of depression.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; It's already left you.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "What gives you the right?" Do
[2:17:33] I need to read it again?
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; He might as well get on down the road,
[2:17:40] down the street. I just seen his red
[2:17:42] light go over the hill a while ago,
[2:17:43] didn't you? He's gone.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; He can't stay in the presence of our
[2:17:48] mighty conqueror.
[2:17:52] And he can't stay in your presence
[2:17:53] either because you realize who you are.
[2:17:56] You're the dwelling place. You're a
[2:17:58] powerhouse of the dynamics.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he will flee from
[2:18:06] you.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Why don't you go ahead and put your
[2:18:10] faith into action? You're a part of this
[2:18:12] third pull.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; My children are saved.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; My children are going to make the
[2:18:17] rapture. Sir,
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; I say my children are going to receive
[2:18:20] the token.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; I am the revival.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; It is for my pastor. It is for my
[2:18:30] pastor's wife. It is for my pastor's
[2:18:32] family. It's for my family. It's for my
[2:18:34] church.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Now listen.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it too, buddy. You
[2:18:48] go confessing it.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; In the day of my power, my people will
[2:18:58] be spontaneous.
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; My people
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; will be willing
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; to take a step upon the water. Amen.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Can't you hear the savior call? Come.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of spooks.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of looking at the Holy Ghost
[2:19:21] move as spooks.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of seeing Christ walking on
[2:19:25] the sea of humanity in my life and
[2:19:28] getting scared. I say step out of the
[2:19:31] boat.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Get out of your comfort zone. Get out of
[2:19:35] your complex. Get out of your fear. Get
[2:19:38] out of the confusion. Claim it for your
[2:19:41] as your inheritance. Walk into it.
[2:19:46] Speak to the sun.
[2:19:49] Speak to your mountain.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you're sure bold."
[2:19:55] I'm telling you, we're in the season of
[2:19:56] it.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I'm not under justification.
[2:20:00] I am not a stalk. I'm not a tassel. I'm
[2:20:04] not a shock. I am weak.
[2:20:08] The same ministry of Jesus Christ that
[2:20:11] was waved over us through a vindicated
[2:20:14] word prophet is now in my life. And I
[2:20:17] say it's my inheritance.
[2:20:21] Let the prodals come home. Let the
[2:20:24] marriages be healed. Let the let the
[2:20:27] churches receive revival. It's rapture
[2:20:30] time.
[2:20:32] Rapture faith in rapture grace.
[2:20:37] Don't be feared of the past.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; That was another season.
[2:20:42] [Applause]
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; I wish I could preach it the way that I
[2:20:46] see it.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Quit being fearful of repeating the
[2:20:50] past. This is another season.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; You know why people make so many
[2:20:57] mistakes? Because they get fearful.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; But perfect love came to take out fear.
[2:21:03] And perfect love is grace.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; And we are made perfect in love.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; And faith works by love.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; And I release my faith in God's perfect
[2:21:16] love for my life. And I say the grace of
[2:21:19] God
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; is all over me.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; It's all over you.
[2:21:30] Now,
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; now we're we're we're still getting
[2:21:33] somewhere
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; because the prophet of God says,
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; he says that Joshua
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; when he stopped the sun, he didn't even
[2:21:43] think about it. Amen.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; He just knew that
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; he was told to defeat these this enemy.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; And that if they could go regroup,
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; he'd lose more men.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; So just spontaneous in the day of my
[2:22:02] power, my people will be willing. And so
[2:22:05] just because he understood his position
[2:22:07] as a Joshua generation,
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; you're a Joshua generation.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; He simply just says, "Well, I can't have
[2:22:22] this,
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; and I'm anointed as the leader,
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; so I'm just going to say, son,
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; stand still. Moon, you stay where you're
[2:22:32] supposed to be.
[2:22:34] and it stayed there for 24 hours
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; and he didn't even think anything of it.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Now maybe on maybe later on he went whoa
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; but right then he had a need for it.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; There's some of us that's got needs
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; that are that are as high as Mount
[2:22:55] Everest
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; and you're so scared to speak to that
[2:22:59] thing
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; because it's got you bluffed.
[2:23:02] But I'm here to tell you that Mount
[2:23:04] Avarest demon is nothing
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; but a whoop devil.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; And the prophet and Jesus told us how to
[2:23:12] get rid of that thing and that is to
[2:23:14] speak to it.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Quit cowering to it and speak with the
[2:23:20] faith of God and cast it into the sea.
[2:23:23] [Applause]
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I tried but nothing
[2:23:26] happened." It happened. It was just only
[2:23:28] a teaspoon.
[2:23:31] And then the devil came back and bluffed
[2:23:32] you into unbelief again because you
[2:23:35] didn't see anything happen. And the
[2:23:37] prophet of God says God never promised
[2:23:39] me us miracles. He promised us results.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; And that could be a teaspoon at a time.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; But it'll get to a shovel
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; and then it'll get to a wheelbarrow and
[2:23:52] then it'll get to a semi.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; It may not happen in one day. It might
[2:23:58] not be one year. It may not be in 10
[2:24:00] years. But it's going to happen.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; I'm so
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; And here I go again.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; I'm so sick of preaching about the third
[2:24:14] pull, which is the opening of the word,
[2:24:16] which is to give us rapturing faith in
[2:24:19] grace.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; And there's always a hashtag, be careful
[2:24:26] with it.
[2:24:31] That was free.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; You see the prophet of God says where
[2:24:37] the ministers failed.
[2:24:41] He says in this last revival where the
[2:24:43] ministers there is where we fail. There
[2:24:46] is where the church fails. When this
[2:24:49] revival that we just had, now this is 63
[2:24:52] in paradox.
[2:24:54] He says, "This revival that we've just
[2:24:56] had, this great campaigns that started
[2:24:58] across the country, when we had the
[2:25:01] enemy running,
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; we should have kept him on the run."
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm telling you, the prophet of God
[2:25:09] says, "I've seen his tail lights go over
[2:25:12] the hill."
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; A prophet said that. A vindicated word
[2:25:17] prophet told you that your enemy is
[2:25:19] nothing but a bluff and he's defeated
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; and he's running from you.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; And then here the prophet of God now
[2:25:27] that was in that was in 53. Now he is
[2:25:30] telling you 10 years later the problem
[2:25:32] with this last revival is we had him on
[2:25:35] the run
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; and we let up. Amen.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you know the prophet of God also
[2:25:43] said
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; he says that he will weep with those who
[2:25:48] weep.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; He will laugh with those who laugh
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; and he's in victory with those who is in
[2:25:53] victory. Let's keep him in victory.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; I just want to say that when I read that
[2:26:00] quote, I took a vow. God,
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep the devil on the run.
[2:26:06] Right.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; I believe the devil's defeated.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; I believe that cancer's defeated.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Discouragement's defeated.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Spirits that are trying to wear you down
[2:26:18] and oppress the saints is defeated.
[2:26:23] [Applause]
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; And I say this bride's revival has got
[2:26:27] the devil on the run. And for one, this
[2:26:30] preacher is going to keep him on the
[2:26:33] run.
[2:26:35] I say let's keep him in victory.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to if you want to have a sob
[2:26:40] story about your blues and about all the
[2:26:42] problems in life, he'll actually come
[2:26:44] along and he'll cry with you.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; If if if you want to say, you know,
[2:26:49] everything's falling apart and and
[2:26:51] that's the kind of high priest you're
[2:26:53] wanting, then that's what he'll be to
[2:26:55] you. But if you're looking for victory
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; and you're and you're looking to wave
[2:27:00] this bloodstained banner and say this is
[2:27:03] the mighty conqueror. He's already
[2:27:04] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[2:27:06] Then that conqueror is here.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; I say let's keep him in victory.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan, you lost.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; We're coming over now. We're marching
[2:27:21] over into the promised land. What is
[2:27:24] that? What is this mountain before
[2:27:26] Zerubabel? Who is this stands before
[2:27:28] there? You'll become a plane. Why with a
[2:27:31] two-edged sword will chop her to the
[2:27:33] ground?
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; We're under the ministry of Zerubab.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; How do you defeat the devil? With the
[2:27:44] word.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God says as much
[2:27:49] faith as will be released, that's how
[2:27:51] much power you can have. Now, I I'm
[2:27:55] closing. I built it all up to this.
[2:27:59] The prophet of God, Brother John, I read
[2:28:02] this the other day, and I
[2:28:04] I I I've read it many times, heard it
[2:28:07] many times. But when I read it, it did
[2:28:10] something to me. The prophet of God in
[2:28:12] the message of grace, if you haven't
[2:28:13] heard in a while, it probably do you do
[2:28:15] you good. Go listen to it.
[2:28:19] Brother Brandham says that he was
[2:28:20] hunting. He went out hunting and
[2:28:23] it was still dark out.
[2:28:26] He said it was rainy.
[2:28:28] He said as he was going out in the woods
[2:28:30] there he said he seen three rainbows
[2:28:32] come up. He said went about 30 feet tall
[2:28:36] and he goes through that.
[2:28:39] He said and then after that experience
[2:28:40] there he was in the presence of God. He
[2:28:42] said then something turned him around.
[2:28:44] He said he looked. He said and there was
[2:28:46] that tree that the year before he spoke
[2:28:49] those squirrels into existence. Y'all
[2:28:50] remember that?
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; You remember when the prophet of God
[2:28:54] said that he was thinking on that
[2:28:55] scripture
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; that if you say under this mountain,
[2:28:58] he's meditating upon that, how could
[2:29:00] that be? And that was before redemption,
[2:29:02] all these things. And and then he took
[2:29:05] him to Moses speaking the word
[2:29:09] and then all of a sudden he heard that
[2:29:10] voice
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; and brother Bam's talking to that voice
[2:29:13] and then all of a sudden he gets he
[2:29:15] spins around and says, "Who's there?
[2:29:17] Who's there?" Y' y'all remember that?
[2:29:18] Yeah,
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; he was so beside himself.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "What do you need your
[2:29:24] hunting game? What do you need?" And he
[2:29:26] speaks the squirrels into existence, he
[2:29:28] tells them, "Well, exactly what it's
[2:29:30] going to how it's going to happen." And
[2:29:32] remember, he said he got so excited that
[2:29:35] that squirrel ran down and before it got
[2:29:37] to the place that he said, he just
[2:29:39] pulled the gun up and shot and he
[2:29:40] missed.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that?
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; He said and and he shot and then he Oh,
[2:29:47] wait. I said that it'll happen this way.
[2:29:50] And he then he went over there and he
[2:29:51] shot and he hit the squirrel.
[2:29:54] That was a year earlier. Now the prophet
[2:29:57] has come to that same tree and he's and
[2:29:59] he's described the tree and he said all
[2:30:02] of a sudden here comes that same voice
[2:30:06] and he says, "What would you have now?
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; What do you have need of?" He said, "Oh,
[2:30:13] now notice he doesn't spin around now.
[2:30:16] Now he's confident.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I guess just like last
[2:30:21] year,
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; the limit."
[2:30:24] He said, he said, "Then speak it." He
[2:30:26] said, "I'll have the limit by 10:00."
[2:30:30] He said, "And then he said there was
[2:30:34] there was just a nest of of of of uh
[2:30:40] what are those?" Mosquitoes.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Not one of those will
[2:30:44] trouble me the rest of the day.
[2:30:46] He said, "And then in 30 minutes the sun
[2:30:49] will come out." He said, "Every single
[2:30:51] one of those things happened." Exactly.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; He said later on in the day, he said, "I
[2:30:56] I I I heard a a noise." He said, "Oh,
[2:30:59] there's one, a mosquito." He said, "I
[2:31:01] stopped and I listened." He said, "It
[2:31:02] was just a truck on a road way off in
[2:31:04] the distance,
[2:31:06] the word."
[2:31:10] But he said no sooner than he had spoke
[2:31:13] that he said all the sudden he heard
[2:31:15] something behind behind him and he said
[2:31:18] it was a chatter chatter chatter.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; He said oh he said I turned around. He
[2:31:23] said there was a young red squirrel just
[2:31:26] like last year.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; He said it was about 70 yards away. He
[2:31:31] said I just put up my gun. He said with
[2:31:34] that high powered scope, he said I could
[2:31:37] barely even see the eye. He says I just
[2:31:42] through those powerful scopes see his
[2:31:44] eye. He said just shot. That's all. I
[2:31:48] didn't even have an aim at no more than
[2:31:51] over the squirrel and the bullet was
[2:31:54] just exactly smack at the eye where it
[2:31:57] was the other time.
[2:31:59] Brother Ben, when I read that, I went,
[2:32:01] "Whoa,
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; wait a minute.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Who told the prophet, how did the
[2:32:07] inspiration strike his heart
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; that he didn't have have to calculate
[2:32:11] the distance?
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to measure how far he's
[2:32:15] going to have to aim over that squirrel
[2:32:17] to hit it in the eye. He can barely even
[2:32:19] see the eye. But the prophet says, "All
[2:32:22] I had to do is no aim. just raised it
[2:32:26] over the squirrel and pulled the trigger
[2:32:28] and it hit it exactly in the eye.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; I thought, "My goodness." Last year he
[2:32:35] was wondering, "How's this going to all
[2:32:37] happen?" Even missed a squirrel. This
[2:32:40] year he doesn't even hardly aim.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; Just push it up,
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; pulls the trigger,
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; and shoots the squirrel in the eye. And
[2:32:50] you know where he's telling us this now?
[2:32:53] He's going to take us to Zerubabel,
[2:32:55] Zechariah the 4th chapter,
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; and he's going to preach
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; a message of grace from this experience.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord, the spirit of the
[2:33:07] Lord, as I begin to meditate on that,
[2:33:09] the spirit of the Lord just quickened.
[2:33:12] He says, you know, that's scriptural.
[2:33:14] I began to think of David and how that
[2:33:17] when David just a little old ruddy boy.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a part of the army.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; They didn't want him because he was too
[2:33:25] scrawny.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; But God had him on the back side of the
[2:33:29] desert.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; And he was he was entertaining
[2:33:33] omnipotence.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; The presence of God would come down and
[2:33:38] David would begin to sing songs while he
[2:33:41] was watching over the sheep. And then
[2:33:43] all of a sudden, here come a lion and
[2:33:44] took one of the sheep and something
[2:33:46] quickened David and he grabbed that and
[2:33:48] he didn't run. He was a shepherd boy
[2:33:51] anointed with the presence of God and he
[2:33:54] took that slingshot and he ran after
[2:33:56] that lion and he and he slung that stone
[2:33:58] and he smoked that lion and he killed
[2:34:01] it. Another experience came with the
[2:34:02] bear. He chased that bear, he killed it.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Now he's also been anointed king.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's still a secret.
[2:34:14] But there he comes into the presence of
[2:34:15] his brethren. And his brethren, which is
[2:34:18] supposed to be the mighty army of the
[2:34:19] living God, is all cowarding down,
[2:34:22] hiding behind rocks.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; And David is looking around saying,
[2:34:25] "What in the world is this?"
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with y'all?
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh, David, you better get
[2:34:31] down and hide because there's a giant
[2:34:33] over there." And about that time, that
[2:34:35] old big big old ugly giant
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; stands up and begins to make his boast.
[2:34:41] Notice how he makes his boast. I
[2:34:43] challenge the armies of Saul.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Now, David turns around and says, "We're
[2:34:48] not the armies of Saul. We're the armies
[2:34:49] of the living God."
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Who is this uncircumcised Philistines?
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; That he would defy the armies of the
[2:34:55] living God. You know what the rest of
[2:34:57] them were doing? They were they were
[2:34:59] identifying themselves with the head of
[2:35:01] their organization. Yeah.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; And it took David to recognize a cause
[2:35:07] to tell his brethren, we are still the
[2:35:10] armies of the living God.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And about that time, Amen. Goliath is
[2:35:17] saying it's been 40 days. 40 days is
[2:35:20] judgment. 40 is judgment.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; 40 days they've been under that thing,
[2:35:26] hiding day after day. Day after day. But
[2:35:30] all the sudden, David says, "I'll go
[2:35:32] fight him.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't do that. They're speaking
[2:35:36] naughty. They're speaking against him.
[2:35:37] We know your hearts. We We know that
[2:35:39] you've you've got you've got a motive."
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "Is there not a cause to see a
[2:35:45] living God in action today?"
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Saul tried to put his armor on him and
[2:35:51] says, "I've not tried that
[2:35:53] ecclesiastical armor.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; I'll go with what I'm trained in."
[2:35:57] The prophet of God says the anointing of
[2:36:00] the Holy Ghost was upon David and he be
[2:36:03] to dance.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up, friends. David
[2:36:09] be to dance in the spirit into the
[2:36:12] battle.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; He said that by faith he saw that giant
[2:36:21] falling down and he spoke it.
[2:36:26] You will fall at my feet.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; David just began to dance.
[2:36:33] [Music]
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; He danced all the way to the brook.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; So anointed of the Holy Ghost that he
[2:36:41] knew he couldn't fail. He couldn't lose
[2:36:44] because he was anointed for this season
[2:36:46] of grace.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; And he reached down there and he got
[2:36:50] five smooth stones. And then he just
[2:36:52] went on dancing to the battle.
[2:36:55] This is what your prophet said David
[2:36:58] did.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; And he danced all the way to the battle.
[2:37:02] He put that stone in that sling. And
[2:37:05] David said, "Oh, a scrawny little runny
[2:37:08] boy." Amen. Coming to do war against me.
[2:37:11] I'm going to put you on the end of my
[2:37:13] spear and I'm going to put you up for
[2:37:14] the fowls of the air. And David said,
[2:37:16] "You're going to be like one of them."
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; He spoke it.
[2:37:24] Prophet of God. Why cry? Speak. He spoke
[2:37:27] it.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; And then he went forward to make good
[2:37:30] what he spoke.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God said by faith
[2:37:36] he already saw the victory.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; All of his brethren.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Look at him. Look at that holy roller.
[2:37:49] Look at that fanatic. Does he know he's
[2:37:51] in the valley?
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; Doesn't he know he should be
[2:37:54] discouraged?
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:37:57] [Applause]
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; The bigger they are,
[2:38:02] the harder they fought.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet of God says that
[2:38:08] when he released that stone,
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost got a hold of that stone.
[2:38:14] [Music]
[2:38:16] and the Holy Ghost. Amen. That stone
[2:38:19] went a thousand miles an hour and it hit
[2:38:22] the only place it could hit that was not
[2:38:25] armored, right between the eyes.
[2:38:29] When I seen that, I thought, "Oh my
[2:38:31] goodness, he didn't even have to aim."
[2:38:35] All he had to do is have confidence in
[2:38:38] grace. All he had to do is to believe
[2:38:41] that this is his season of grace. This
[2:38:44] is his season of victory. Just let it
[2:38:47] go.
[2:38:51] You know what the prophet of God says?
[2:38:54] He says, "Why are you putting the gun
[2:38:56] over the mantle and saying, "Oh, look at
[2:38:58] my gun. It's a pretty gun." He says,
[2:39:00] "Get the gun off of the mantle. Put it
[2:39:02] on the devil and squeeze the trigger."
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; Why are we scared to pull the trigger?
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got my complexes. Well, I
[2:39:14] just don't know all the quotes just
[2:39:16] right. When are you ever?
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; When are you ever?
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; Please tell me.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz I want to go to your school so I can
[2:39:24] get better.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Because we are not under law.
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; We're under a season of grace
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; and we need to believe that we're in a
[2:39:34] Holy Ghost move. And if you will stay on
[2:39:37] the stay in the word and speak the word,
[2:39:40] the Holy Ghost will get a hold of it.
[2:39:49] Well,
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; I'm just so uncertain.
[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I just, you know, I just
[2:39:55] little old me. I can't fulfill the
[2:39:57] promise, and I don't know if I can pull
[2:40:00] the trigger.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; Well, it's for the pastor. Get in the
[2:40:05] wheelbarrow.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Well, the pastor's got all faith. That's
[2:40:08] not what the prophet said. He said, "You
[2:40:10] get in the third pole. You get in the
[2:40:12] wheelbarrow and put your faith into
[2:40:14] action.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not joking.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; We've got we we're so tied up in fear.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; I just don't know if I can do it.
[2:40:36] And just like those denominations
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; that have caused the people to live a
[2:40:40] million miles below their privileges
[2:40:42] that they're still the people of so many
[2:40:44] people are still wondering if we got
[2:40:46] rapturing faith.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; And they keep going back to the same old
[2:40:51] quote. Well, we can't have faith for a
[2:40:53] headache hardly. How are we going to
[2:40:54] have faith for the rapture? They
[2:40:56] couldn't have faith for a headache
[2:40:57] because the denominations were saying
[2:40:59] they couldn't believe for it.
[2:41:01] But we've been liberated.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[2:41:06] is liberty. And he sent the spirit of
[2:41:08] truth to get into our hearts to teach us
[2:41:12] to believe for all things.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; But not only that, this is a different
[2:41:18] kind of a grace. This is rapturing
[2:41:21] grace.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; It's time to pull the trigger.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; Put another bullet in it. Pull the
[2:41:28] trigger. Put another promise in the
[2:41:30] barrel. Pull the trigger. Just keep
[2:41:32] pulling it. Just keep pulling it.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; It's time to get our dance back.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; It's time to realize we're in the
[2:41:43] victory.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; I I I I just want to read this because I
[2:41:53] think it'll help someone. You see,
[2:41:57] you see, Goliath made his boast and then
[2:41:59] he said, "Here I come in the name of the
[2:42:00] Lord." And the prophet of God says,
[2:42:02] "David didn't have to get all prayed up.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to pray through.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; He was already prayed through.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; God prayed him through before the
[2:42:13] foundation of the world."
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I know that hurts legalist,
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; but I got to say what a prophet says. We
[2:42:24] believe in fasting.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; We believe in prayer meetings.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; But quit trying to label that
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; as if that's how we're going to get our
[2:42:34] victory.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't fast, so
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; no victory for you.
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that is an
[2:42:44] enticing spirit
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; that is trying to hinder your faith.
[2:42:49] that is trying to get you under law
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; that well I've got a chart here
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; and I got to check this off and check
[2:42:56] that off and check this off. That is not
[2:42:59] grace friends.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; But everything we do is out of love
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; and God gave us the secrets to victory.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you right now, I'm
[2:43:11] prayed up.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; I'm prayed up before the foundation of
[2:43:14] the world for this great victory. Amen.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was anointed for the job.
[2:43:23] He had to speak and go forward. That's
[2:43:26] all there was to do about it. Just speak
[2:43:29] and go and speak and go forward. That's
[2:43:31] all there was to it. Now, the prophet of
[2:43:33] God says he spake and took over the
[2:43:36] situation that day. If there ever was a
[2:43:40] time that man should speak,
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; it's now.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; You see, God, now the prophet of God
[2:43:50] said that God has raised up a generation
[2:43:54] for the last great kill.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; And I believe that the power of the Holy
[2:44:01] Ghost is the word in flesh in you and I.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; And I believe that I am looking at a
[2:44:07] generation
[2:44:09] of Goliath killers.
[2:44:12] I'm looking at a generation that is more
[2:44:14] than conquerors.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at a generation
[2:44:20] that knows that they can take this
[2:44:22] message and this word and push it out
[2:44:25] there with a perfect faith and a perfect
[2:44:27] confidence that the Holy Ghost will take
[2:44:30] a hold of it because you don't have the
[2:44:32] wrong motive.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; You don't have the wrong objective. Your
[2:44:35] heart is pure
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; and you believe that God has sent you a
[2:44:40] message
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; for your victory
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; and your overcoming grace.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; Then speak.
[2:44:52] Speak. You say, "Brother Jonathan, I
[2:44:53] just get so scared. What am I supposed
[2:44:55] to speak?" Well, okay.
[2:44:58] Let's just let's just line us up on the
[2:45:00] target
[2:45:02] because the prophet of God's
[2:45:05] took us through a little life example.
[2:45:09] You remember he he had a he had a 22 and
[2:45:12] he shot it through the same hole nine
[2:45:14] times
[2:45:15] and actually had it sick ass signed as
[2:45:18] proof and then he went and he went to
[2:45:21] shoot a squirrel and he hid in the body
[2:45:23] or missed and he got all tore up
[2:45:26] and then come to find out that his wife
[2:45:28] was saying well the Winchester company
[2:45:31] says that that that it's not supposed to
[2:45:33] do what you're saying it's to do and
[2:45:35] brother Blam says but I've always I've
[2:45:37] already proved it and there He was
[2:45:40] sitting in the woods. All the other
[2:45:42] brothers could hit a squirrel anywhere.
[2:45:45] And he's crying and he's saying, "God,"
[2:45:48] he was so tore up and nervous. He said,
[2:45:49] "God, why did you make me this way?" And
[2:45:52] God said, "I made you thus
[2:45:55] because you you're made this way because
[2:45:57] you know that if it hit once, it'll do
[2:45:59] it again." And you know, if Paul hit the
[2:46:03] mark
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and you line it up on the same
[2:46:06] gospel that Paul preached, it'll hit the
[2:46:08] mark.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Now, Revelation 10:7, the mysteries are
[2:46:12] revealed, but Revelation 10:8-11, the
[2:46:15] bride is go to is to go to that covenant
[2:46:17] angel and take that book of redemption
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; and is to eat the book
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; and is to prophesy again. So, I'm I'm
[2:46:27] I'm telling you, you want to know what
[2:46:29] to speak?
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; We have got a vindicated message. Amen.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Start speaking it.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Start confessing it.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; Because confess is to say the same thing
[2:46:41] as. And if God vindicated this prophet,
[2:46:44] he's going to vindicate this bride.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; And I say we've got every right. It's
[2:46:49] our inheritance.
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; Step into it.
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; You're anointed for this last great
[2:46:56] kill.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; You're anointed to kill devils.
[2:47:06] You see, the prophet of God says, "And
[2:47:08] let the musicians come to give you some
[2:47:10] hope."
[2:47:17] He says, "You know, it's a true shooting
[2:47:19] gun. I hang it up on the wall and oh
[2:47:21] sure, I got a gun." I just paraphrased
[2:47:23] this. He says, "What do you do with it?"
[2:47:25] He says, "It hangs on the wall." Said,
[2:47:27] "That's faith." People say, "Oh, I'm a
[2:47:29] Christian. Oh, I believe God can." But
[2:47:31] what do you do about it? Put it to work.
[2:47:34] Turn it loose. Do something with it. Get
[2:47:37] out
[2:47:38] and hunt up the devil where he says you
[2:47:42] still hurting.
[2:47:44] You got to hunt him up and say you're a
[2:47:46] liar.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; Pull the beat on him. Get him in the
[2:47:51] scope. Don't be afraid to pull the
[2:47:55] trigger cuz it'll go off as sure as
[2:47:58] anything.
[2:48:00] You know what you got to have? You got
[2:48:02] to have this kind of an attitude. I
[2:48:04] didn't say arrogance now, but a kind of
[2:48:06] attitude. The right mental attitude
[2:48:08] toward any divine promise will bring it
[2:48:09] to pass.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Just take the word of
[2:48:14] God and cut your way through every
[2:48:16] doubt."
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; You see it? Sure. That's it. If that's
[2:48:20] the next job, let's get it done.
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; Next thing I know to do is get away from
[2:48:25] my doubts. Cut it down. That's my next
[2:48:27] job is get all my frustrations away. If
[2:48:30] my senses tell me, well, you feel bad.
[2:48:33] The next thing to do is cut that thing
[2:48:34] away. That's right. You say, "Well, they
[2:48:37] tell me, you know, my conscience tell
[2:48:39] me, Brother Brandon, that I can Well,
[2:48:41] you might as well cut that thing away.
[2:48:43] You ain't going to get no further than
[2:48:44] that. Just get your next job done. Take
[2:48:48] off your coat and barrel right into it.
[2:48:51] Just keep on going. One objective. I'm
[2:48:54] going to win. I can't lose. I'm going to
[2:48:59] win.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; Now, that's your prophet in the greatest
[2:49:04] battle ever fought telling you
[2:49:06] how to deal with symptoms,
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; how to deal with discouragement, how to
[2:49:11] deal with imagination, conscience,
[2:49:13] reasoning, affections, what you see,
[2:49:15] what you hear, all your feelings. you
[2:49:19] you know the this may not mean a whole
[2:49:21] lot to you but but the prophet of God
[2:49:23] says how you uh uh brother John was
[2:49:26] talking about the civil war
[2:49:29] and and one of the generals was General
[2:49:31] Grant and he's actually the general the
[2:49:34] last general that that actually overcome
[2:49:35] General Lee's army in the south but when
[2:49:38] he come to Richmond
[2:49:42] the the prophet of God says how did
[2:49:45] General Grant
[2:49:48] overcome Richmond.
[2:49:51] He says, "Well,
[2:49:53] he overcome it just how he came to it."
[2:49:58] What the prophet of God was trying to
[2:50:00] tell us
[2:50:01] is the next devil that comes up to you,
[2:50:05] the next situation in your life,
[2:50:08] you just defeated.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:12] And then you're going to want to shout
[2:50:14] the victory and praise the Lord because
[2:50:16] God's given you a testimony.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; And to keep that testimony hid in your
[2:50:20] heart and not tell someone else, that's
[2:50:23] being ashamed of him.
[2:50:25] &gt;&gt; So you got to you got to you you got to
[2:50:27] let the praises out and say, "God's a
[2:50:29] mighty conqueror." But then you're going
[2:50:30] to come against a you're going to come
[2:50:32] against another enemy. And you know how
[2:50:34] you conquer that enemy? Just the way you
[2:50:36] come to it.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; You see, you're not fearful. You're not
[2:50:40] wondering if you're going to fall.
[2:50:41] You're not wondering if you're going to
[2:50:42] be defeated.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; You defeat the demons that come against
[2:50:47] you.
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; Is that simple? Am I just too simple?
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; So tonight, there's some real situations
[2:50:57] in your life.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; But you know how you're going to
[2:51:00] overcome that thing?
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; Just the way you come to it.
[2:51:05] If you've got a if you've been fighting
[2:51:07] a spirit of depression,
[2:51:09] then you just stand up to that thing and
[2:51:11] say, "Satan, I'm taking my unwavering
[2:51:14] faith
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; and I'm saying, Satan, you're not coming
[2:51:18] back anymore."
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "It's too simple." Well, I'm
[2:51:22] telling you, he's already left.
[2:51:26] But it's your faith that's got to stand
[2:51:29] up to him and say, "Satan, you're a
[2:51:31] bluff and you're not welcome here any
[2:51:34] longer."
[2:51:39] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and just just play something
[2:51:41] softly.
[2:51:42] [Music]
[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:51:47] this is a real spirit of grace, and you
[2:51:49] forgive me for taking too long. I I I
[2:51:53] I'm sorry for
[2:51:56] for wearing you out tonight. I I hope I
[2:51:58] didn't too much,
[2:52:02] but
[2:52:05] I it it's it's something that has just
[2:52:07] been so bubbling up in my soul
[2:52:10] that I I I'm I'm so overwhelmed by it.
[2:52:15] You say, "Well, Brother Jonathan,
[2:52:17] apparently you don't have too many
[2:52:19] battles."
[2:52:20] No.
[2:52:25] I'd say the last couple of years have
[2:52:27] probably been the greatest battles one
[2:52:29] after another after another after
[2:52:31] another
[2:52:33] that I've ever faced in my entire life.
[2:52:37] But God has revealed his grace to me and
[2:52:40] my wife,
[2:52:41] my children like never before.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; There's people that would have thrown in
[2:52:48] the towel for me and just said, "Well,
[2:52:52] looked like that I was going to lose my
[2:52:54] daughter.
[2:52:58] Looked like that my wife was being
[2:53:00] diagnosed with some kind of thyroid and
[2:53:04] and and and the devil trying to take her
[2:53:06] out.
[2:53:08] [Music]
[2:53:10] But I stand here as a testimony
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; of grace.
[2:53:16] You say, "What gives you the right to
[2:53:18] preach it that way?" Well, first of all,
[2:53:20] a vindicated message
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; that everything I preached is right here
[2:53:24] in this message.
[2:53:27] But I've also experienced it.
[2:53:31] I've experienced the power of
[2:53:34] omnipotence.
[2:53:37] You see, I I've went through that season
[2:53:39] as well as, well, look at the failings
[2:53:42] here and look at those over there and
[2:53:45] look look what they're trying to do.
[2:53:48] But I've come to a point in my life,
[2:53:50] Brother Ben,
[2:53:53] that whatever people's going to do, they
[2:53:54] can do it.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; But as for me in my house, we're in this
[2:53:58] promised land,
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; and we're going to serve the Lord. Amen.
[2:54:04] [Music]
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; If if if I if if I just if I'm always
[2:54:10] worried about what everyone else is
[2:54:12] doing,
[2:54:13] if I'm just pushing against what other
[2:54:15] people are doing, then you know what I'm
[2:54:17] going to do? I'm going to lose my
[2:54:18] balance.
[2:54:20] [Music]
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; But you see, I'm standing for something.
[2:54:25] I'm not fighting against something. I'm
[2:54:27] standing for something. Amen.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; I'm standing for Jesus Christ and the
[2:54:32] power of his resurrection.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here as a witness. I've
[2:54:38] seen God filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; I I I've seen the Holy Ghost take a hold
[2:54:47] of young people and so transform their
[2:54:50] lives and change their natures. And
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, people would have would
[2:54:55] was actually want to give up on them.
[2:54:59] I've got a cousin that
[2:55:02] that ever since he was a young boy had
[2:55:05] been in had went in drugs and and and
[2:55:08] had become a heroin addict.
[2:55:12] Got married to a girl that for a
[2:55:15] birthday present I I believe it was a
[2:55:17] birthday present. Her grandmother gave
[2:55:18] her uh drugs as just a little girl.
[2:55:24] teeth all rotted out, liver bat,
[2:55:29] just an addict.
[2:55:32] But when they were homeless,
[2:55:36] something happened
[2:55:38] and my cousin said, "You know, I know I
[2:55:41] know I have a cousin and told him about
[2:55:43] my brother and his church." And they
[2:55:46] were over there
[2:55:49] a thousand or so miles away, homeless.
[2:55:51] He said, "But I if we could just scrape
[2:55:53] up enough money to get a bus ticket, I
[2:55:56] believe if we go there, we can get some
[2:55:57] help."
[2:55:59] And and and and they come there and I'm
[2:56:02] tell
[2:56:04] we had been through a whole a whole lot,
[2:56:07] many years,
[2:56:09] but grace came down
[2:56:13] and my brother and the church there
[2:56:15] began to love him. And it didn't happen
[2:56:16] overnight, but by the grace of God,
[2:56:19] that's been about eight years ago. And
[2:56:22] they've been sober. God took away the
[2:56:24] addiction out of their life.
[2:56:27] [Applause]
[2:56:32] Not only that,
[2:56:36] but she needed a liver transplant.
[2:56:39] And when she went back to the doctor,
[2:56:41] the doctor had been her doctor for a
[2:56:43] long time. And the and the doctor the
[2:56:46] doctor's just frustrated with her,
[2:56:50] but she says, "I I want you to check
[2:56:51] me." And says, "I I've already checked
[2:56:54] you before." And D, just aggravated.
[2:56:57] Said, "Oh, I want you to check me
[2:56:58] again." He says, "When when she went and
[2:57:01] checked her liver," he said, "I got to
[2:57:03] check this again."
[2:57:05] And he went and did another test. He
[2:57:07] says, "I
[2:57:09] don't know what happened, but your liver
[2:57:10] is brand new.
[2:57:13] [Applause]
[2:57:20] says, "Well,"
[2:57:22] she's about to leave and she says,
[2:57:23] "Well, you know, this medication that
[2:57:25] you've got me on, you know, I I guess I
[2:57:28] need a refill." She He says, "You don't
[2:57:29] understand. You didn't hear me. You
[2:57:31] don't need it any longer. You've got a
[2:57:33] brand new liver. I don't know what's
[2:57:36] happened." She said, "I know what's
[2:57:37] happened. I gave my life to Jesus Christ
[2:57:40] and he's changed my life.
[2:57:46] [Applause]
[2:57:48] I I just feel like sharing just a few uh
[2:57:51] just just another testimony. I I was
[2:57:53] there in Canada a few months ago and I'd
[2:57:56] had my sermon all ready and I went to
[2:57:58] bed and then the Lord woke me up in the
[2:58:01] middle of the night and I I I had a
[2:58:04] little story that was just playing in my
[2:58:06] head and it was just the lines of you're
[2:58:09] twice mine. You're twice mine. you're
[2:58:11] twice mine." And I I'm I'm jogging and
[2:58:14] I'm thinking, "What what is that about?"
[2:58:17] And I thought, you know, it seems like I
[2:58:19] heard a story like that. And so I
[2:58:22] actually Googled it and it's about a
[2:58:24] little boy that built a sailboat and
[2:58:27] then he took it into the into the stream
[2:58:29] and he loved that sailboat and and then
[2:58:32] it got in the current and it took it a
[2:58:34] long ways away and he lost his sailboat.
[2:58:37] Then a couple of months later, he was
[2:58:40] walking down the street and he seen his
[2:58:42] little sailboat in the pawn shop and he
[2:58:46] ran in the pawn shop and he and he said,
[2:58:48] "Hey, that's my sailboat." He said, "Oh,
[2:58:51] no. That's my sailboat. I'm the one that
[2:58:53] found it." He said, "How much is it?" He
[2:58:55] said, "It's $5." He said, "I want you to
[2:58:58] hold it for me. Please hold it for me."
[2:59:00] He ran and and he got he got his piggy
[2:59:02] bank and he broke it open and he counted
[2:59:04] it exactly $5.
[2:59:07] He took that money and he went to the
[2:59:10] pawn shop and he paid for it. He took
[2:59:12] the boat and he said, "You're twice
[2:59:14] mine. You were mine when I made you and
[2:59:18] you're mine now when I bought you."
[2:59:23] Hallelujah.
[2:59:26] I thought, "This is strange. I've not
[2:59:29] heard that story for years."
[2:59:33] I told the pastor that morning, I said,
[2:59:35] "As we were driving to church, he I told
[2:59:37] him, I said, 'You know, something odd
[2:59:38] happened last night. I had my sermon
[2:59:40] already, but God changed the whole thing
[2:59:42] around." He said, "It's God. He's going
[2:59:43] to do something this morning." As as we
[2:59:46] were going to the front, he said, "I
[2:59:48] told you God's going to do something.
[2:59:50] I'll tell you later."
[2:59:53] I got up there. I preached. We had a
[2:59:56] powerful powerful service. But I be I
[2:59:59] began to notice that there was a young
[3:00:00] lady over there in the back and my she
[3:00:04] was trying. She was resisting. She had
[3:00:05] makeup all over, cut hair. I mean, she
[3:00:08] had so much makeup on her face and eye
[3:00:10] shadow and bless her heart. As I be to
[3:00:14] preach and I noticed that her lip was
[3:00:16] quivering, but she was fighting it. And
[3:00:19] it come to the very last part of that
[3:00:21] sermon. And I told about that story at
[3:00:24] about that time the floodgates open. She
[3:00:28] come to the front. She had lost the
[3:00:29] battle. The tears, the eye shadow, the
[3:00:32] makeup was all just, it was just a runny
[3:00:34] mess. But she she was a part of a church
[3:00:38] split
[3:00:41] and her life had become a wreck and she
[3:00:43] lived about six hours away.
[3:00:46] But it just so happened that it was her
[3:00:48] birthday
[3:00:49] and she wanted to come into this town in
[3:00:53] St. John's, Newfoundland.
[3:00:56] and she wanted to come into town to go
[3:00:58] to dinner for her birthday. So, she told
[3:01:00] her family, "I want to go to that little
[3:01:03] church and go to eat." And God got a
[3:01:07] hold of her life.
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:15] Praise the name of the Lord.
[3:01:18] Just another just another testimony.
[3:01:20] Amen. I preached again. I was in Canada
[3:01:22] and I was at brother Ed Hammermeister's
[3:01:25] church and as I preached and and and and
[3:01:27] the anointing was just so thick and just
[3:01:30] the people worshiping. I had just went
[3:01:32] over there and I sat down and I was just
[3:01:34] worshiping and then here come a young
[3:01:36] lady. She'd come to the front. She had
[3:01:38] piercings on her face and everything
[3:01:40] else. But then she began to just she's
[3:01:43] weeping and come to find out her
[3:01:46] testimony and how that she had been
[3:01:48] running from God and but God got a hold
[3:01:51] of her and she repented and came back to
[3:01:53] God and said, "I'm tired of this. I'm
[3:01:55] tired of running. I want to serve Jesus
[3:01:57] Christ."
[3:02:01] We're in a season of grace.
[3:02:03] Amen.
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne Lawson was preaching at
[3:02:06] Tim at Brother Tim Puit's church and and
[3:02:08] and he was actually it was when they
[3:02:10] were building his church, Brother Tim's
[3:02:12] church, and brother Wayne knows how to
[3:02:15] work do dirt work and and he he was
[3:02:18] there on a Wednesday and he had come in
[3:02:20] to do some of their dirt work and it was
[3:02:23] getting late and it was later than than
[3:02:25] he was anticipating and he had to preach
[3:02:27] that night and he was thinking, "My I've
[3:02:29] got to get this done and I got to get
[3:02:30] some notes prepared." And all of a
[3:02:32] sudden he said that God spoke to his
[3:02:34] heart. Something supernatural is going
[3:02:36] to happen tonight.
[3:02:38] Just rest. He said, "Brother Wayne just
[3:02:41] went on." He said, "Okay." Then just
[3:02:43] went on went on and did the dirt work.
[3:02:45] Barely made it made it back home. Got
[3:02:48] dressed for church and came in. Didn't
[3:02:50] even look at any notes. But the power of
[3:02:53] almighty God fell that night on a
[3:02:56] Wednesday night. Had an impromptu prayer
[3:02:58] line.
[3:03:00] There was a young lady that came up and
[3:03:02] said, "My brother,
[3:03:04] I've got a burden for my brother. He
[3:03:07] He's in a rock and roll band. He's ran
[3:03:09] from church. He don't even go to church
[3:03:11] any longer." And they prayed right then.
[3:03:16] Said that young man, unbeknownst to
[3:03:18] them, that young man was home in bed.
[3:03:22] And because that the service
[3:03:25] had had ran, it actually ran over five
[3:03:28] hours on a Wednesday night
[3:03:31] and he woke up and mom and dad wasn't
[3:03:33] home and and he panicked and you know
[3:03:36] what his first thought was? The raptures
[3:03:39] took place and I've missed it.
[3:03:42] He said he got a hold of the he got a
[3:03:44] hold of I I I got the phone and he
[3:03:46] called a deacon and the deacon didn't
[3:03:48] answer and he said I've missed it.
[3:03:51] He said there he was in his pajamas and
[3:03:54] he got in his in his feet to a vehicle.
[3:03:56] He began to sobb and cry. He said, "I
[3:03:59] can't miss the rapture." And he began to
[3:04:01] he began to run to the church and he
[3:04:03] actually missed a turn and went and went
[3:04:06] off the road and went into a fence and
[3:04:08] knocked the fence down and wiping tears.
[3:04:10] and he got back on the road and he came
[3:04:11] back and and he got into the church
[3:04:13] parking lot and there just so happened
[3:04:16] to be a deacon that had stepped outside
[3:04:19] and he seen that young man turning that
[3:04:22] corner flying came into the parking lot
[3:04:25] threw it in park and and and he got out
[3:04:29] and he's like well there's that young
[3:04:32] man and he went out there and that young
[3:04:34] man just fell on his knees and he said I
[3:04:37] got to get right with God I don't want
[3:04:38] to miss the rapture.
[3:04:40] I want to get right with God.
[3:04:44] They had just prayed for him 30 minutes
[3:04:46] ago.
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; And that young man comes walking up the
[3:04:50] aisles in his pajamas.
[3:04:52] [Music]
[3:04:54] &gt;&gt; And that whole family comes to the altar
[3:04:56] and they rededicate their lives to Jesus
[3:04:59] Christ. And he's still serving God,
[3:05:01] filled with the Holy Ghost, married and
[3:05:03] having a victorious life.
[3:05:09] That's the gospel we're proclaiming.
[3:05:12] Let the dead bury their dead. But as far
[3:05:15] as the church of the living God, we are
[3:05:18] proclaiming the good news. We are
[3:05:20] pressing. We are pressing toward the
[3:05:24] mark. And we can't miss. Are you hearing
[3:05:28] me, church? It's time to let your faith
[3:05:30] loose. Believe for the impossible. Pull
[3:05:33] the trigger. You can't miss.
[3:05:38] I'm just wondering if you need prayer
[3:05:40] tonight.
[3:05:42] I invite you to come.
[3:05:46] You need prayer. You've got something in
[3:05:48] your life. You say, "Well, you you've
[3:05:50] taken on We're at a camp meeting.
[3:05:53] &gt;&gt; We're a family camp."
[3:05:57] If you've got something that you've been
[3:06:00] struggling with, I'm telling you, doomed
[3:06:03] devils are on the run.
[3:06:06] and this is your hour and this is your
[3:06:08] season of grace.
[3:06:10] But you've got to turn your faith loose.
[3:06:13] But I believe
[3:06:16] that if there's something in your heart
[3:06:18] that says, I I'm going to come in with a
[3:06:20] heart of faith, a perfect faith, saying,
[3:06:23] "God, I believe your word. I believe
[3:06:26] you'll come up here and you'll leave
[3:06:28] here totally different.
[3:06:31] You'll be totally changed.
[3:06:34] I don't care if it's pornography
[3:06:35] addictions or any other addiction. I
[3:06:38] don't care if it's alcohol, it's drugs.
[3:06:40] I I I don't care if it's a religious
[3:06:43] spirit.
[3:06:45] [Music]
[3:06:48] If you need to pray through at an altar
[3:06:50] and receive the Holy Ghost, then come
[3:06:53] and pray through.
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; Why wait?
[3:06:58] &gt;&gt; But come knowing it's a promise.
[3:07:03] The prophet of God said that when I pray
[3:07:05] for someone needing the Holy Ghost, he
[3:07:07] said, "I don't I don't shake them. I
[3:07:09] don't beg for it. I don't demand it. I
[3:07:11] just simply say, God, you promised it.
[3:07:14] It's a promise." Ministers, why don't
[3:07:16] you come? Brothers and sisters, I'm
[3:07:19] telling you, this is your season of
[3:07:21] grace. It's time to have faith in grace.
[3:07:26] I'm telling you, it's time to have faith
[3:07:29] in grace. It's not by your works. is not
[3:07:31] by your power, but here in the season of
[3:07:34] the son of man, will he find faith to
[3:07:38] come to that judge,
[3:07:41] that wicked one with supreme authority
[3:07:43] over your life and say, "God, I believe
[3:07:45] the promises."
[3:07:49] If you want to if you're if you're if
[3:07:52] you got a need,
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to beg you,
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; but I'm telling you, there's a special
[3:07:57] anointing there.
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, it's grace.
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
