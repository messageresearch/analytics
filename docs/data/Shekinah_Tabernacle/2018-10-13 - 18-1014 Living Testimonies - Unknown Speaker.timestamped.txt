[36:21] I sing a song amen has anyone ever been
[36:27] to a theme park or an amusement park or
[36:30] anything and then I'm the kind of guy
[36:33] who when he's on the chair
[36:35] usually grips onto the bar to hold on
[36:37] for dear life because the fear leaves me
[36:40] unbelievably stiff and frigid and
[36:42] whatever and you get other people who
[36:44] just throw their arms up in the air and
[36:46] scream and shout and yell and express
[36:50] whatever the strange part of that is
[36:54] that me who has my hands to the bar I
[36:57] feel those dips and those plunges and
[37:00] those insane madness and roller coasters
[37:03] are way more than those who have their
[37:05] hands screaming out loud and letting all
[37:09] of that out and it just feels like that
[37:13] in this season that God has
[37:15] intentionally put maybe you may relate
[37:18] additionally put me in a rollercoaster
[37:20] right whether it's dips and his rises
[37:23] and there's dips so that I can take my
[37:28] hands off the bar for once I can take my
[37:30] hands off the bar and raise them up and
[37:33] say Jesus I need you because you're my
[37:38] strength when I am weak Lord you're the
[37:41] treasure that I seek do you feel that
[37:44] way this morning do you feel that or you
[37:46] or you can ever be all you're ever will
[37:49] ever be is a a person to worship God but
[37:54] you don't have anything else in life to
[37:56] the point worship God you may have your
[37:57] job you may have your children to look
[37:59] after but ultimately our existence in
[38:03] this life is to live like God to be like
[38:06] him so we need him so if you feel that
[38:09] way this morning just raise your hands
[38:10] just close your eyes as we sing this
[38:13] song just let him hear you just let him
[38:15] come into your heart as whether been

[44:08] across the Red Sea for the horse of
[44:11] Pharaoh went in with his chariots and
[44:14] with us Horseman into the sea and the
[44:15] Lord brought again the waters of the sea
[44:17] upon him but the children of Israel went
[44:20] on dry land and the
[44:22] of the sea and Miriam the prophetess the
[44:24] sister of Aaron took a timbrel in her

[44:39] sea hallelujah let's go to let's go to X
[44:43] I'll see if this is this is working I
[44:48] mean this got to Acts chapter 4 and
[44:51] verse 23 hallelujah that says and being
[45:01] late goes the apostles they went to
[45:04] their own company and reported all that
[45:06] the chief priests and the elders had
[45:07] done unto them and when they heard that
[45:12] they lifted up their voice to God with
[45:16] one Accord and said Lord thou art God
[45:19] which has made heaven and earth and the
[45:22] sea and all that all that in them is who
[45:26] by the mouth of thy servant David had
[45:28] said why do the heathen rage and the
[45:30] people imagine vain things the king
[45:34] kings of the earth can you turn I can
[45:36] can you turn this thing down a bit
[45:38] sorry the kings of the earth stood up
[45:42] and the rulers were gathered together
[45:43] against the Lord and against his Christ
[45:46] for of a truth against the Holy Child
[45:48] Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod
[45:51] and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and
[45:53] the people of Israel were gathered
[45:54] together for to do whatsoever thy hand
[45:56] and thy counsel determined before to be
[45:59] done and now Lord behold their
[46:04] threatenings and grant unto thy servants
[46:07] that with all boldness they may speak
[46:11] thy word by stretching forth I hand to
[46:13] heal and that signs and wonders may be
[46:16] done by the name of thy Holy Child Jesus
[46:18] and when they had prayed the place was
[46:20] shaken where they were assembled
[46:21] together and they were all filled with
[46:23] the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word
[46:25] of God with boldness amen may the Lord
[46:27] bless his word this morning you may have
[46:29] your seat so can you I think there's
[46:31] been a yeah yeah I yeah yeah it's better
[46:34] yep
[46:35] amen so I wonder if I could if I could
[46:39] take a title I'd like to speak about
[46:41] being a living testimony oh that that
[46:44] just went the other way
[46:47] that's all good praise the Lord
[46:49] now we read here how's your fun this
[46:56] morning if I'm well Alou yeah now we
[47:01] read here with an ex chapter four we
[47:04] have a group of believers we understand
[47:07] that the book of Acts is not the Acts of
[47:09] the Apostles but it's the Acts of the
[47:11] Holy Ghost and the Apostles it was the
[47:14] and we know that the Bride of Christ is
[47:17] writing another book of Acts so your
[47:19] life is writing another book of x-a my
[47:21] brother Bram said if that via never puts
[47:23] forth another branch it will write
[47:24] another book of Acts
[47:25] so the Bride of Christ around the world
[47:27] is writing another book of Acts now we
[47:31] know that the book of Acts I said it's
[47:32] the acts of the Holy Ghost and the
[47:33] Apostles it's God living in his body
[47:36] it's the it's God living through his
[47:38] bride and already the Antichrist spirit
[47:41] is war warring against the bride notice
[47:44] that that if you know if you read the
[47:46] whole account from Acts for not the
[47:49] whole church was dragged before the
[47:50] Sanhedrin before the elders and the
[47:51] chief priests it was just a few but in
[47:54] those ones they were threatened not to
[47:56] preach and his name anymore they are
[47:57] intimidated but then they gathered back
[48:00] to to have a prayer meeting and they are
[48:03] under expectation that God would come
[48:05] and meet their need I mean that they
[48:07] didn't just gather just for a religious
[48:10] ceremony but they religion they gathered
[48:12] that God would meet them and that should
[48:15] be our expectation for every service it
[48:18] should be God what are you going to do
[48:19] today what are you gonna do it's more we
[48:22] don't gather just to learn something
[48:23] just to hear some intellectual speech or
[48:26] some more kind of an idea but God would
[48:28] come anoint his word for every soul and
[48:31] he would live among us they had an
[48:33] expectation Lord the enemies come
[48:35] against us here we are one Accord one
[48:37] mind one heart and God came down and
[48:40] shook the place and they will fill with
[48:42] the Holy Ghost hallelujah so every part
[48:45] of us now every every one of us has a
[48:49] job to doing the service right each
[48:51] every one of us now brother Brandon
[48:53] tells us that we are a amateur creator
[48:57] that we can create an atmosphere around
[48:58] us right we can create an atmosphere
[49:00] around us and we know that that is more
[49:02] than just saying you know more than just
[49:04] I wasn't it lovely but God you can
[49:06] create an atmosphere around you that God
[49:08] can step down as the atmosphere for not
[49:10] only yourself but for others hallelujah
[49:13] that you can create an atmosphere that
[49:14] God comes in twelves as his word says he
[49:17] he inhabits the praises of his people to
[49:20] where God's people are praising him and
[49:22] worshiping him more than nice singing we
[49:25] know you're more than just saying nice
[49:26] things and saying praise but God comes
[49:28] anoint you creates an atmosphere he
[49:31] inhabits that around you hallelujah and
[49:33] that's what we want we aren't going to
[49:35] inhabit our praise go to inhabit our
[49:37] lives here in heaven the church here
[49:39] dwell among us hallelujah that's what we
[49:42] want because we have to recognize your
[49:44] we're free people I mean we can't let
[49:46] the devil try and put us back in bondage
[49:48] and tell us to shut up and sit down and
[49:50] the bride's not going to shut up the
[49:52] bride's not going to sit down we're
[49:53] going to take our god-given rights we're
[49:55] going to take everything in the land we
[49:57] are not going to formalize and settle
[49:59] down we're going to take everything God
[50:01] has given us and we should not settle
[50:03] for anything less than possessing the
[50:05] whole Word of God hallelujah that's so
[50:08] we should be dead interest I want it all
[50:10] I don't want to put up with the devil on
[50:12] my land and I want squatters I want to
[50:14] drive them off I want him to be trophies
[50:16] on my wall I want to possess all things
[50:18] if he has given us all things to possess
[50:20] I mean we have the title deed everything
[50:23] Adam lost in the guard and the bride is
[50:25] received the mighty angel is descended
[50:27] with an open book that book is in the
[50:29] hands of the Prophet anymore it's in the
[50:30] hands of the bride father in this
[50:32] everything Adam lost has been given into
[50:34] our hands again so we have our god-given
[50:36] right to possess the contents of the
[50:39] book hallelujah we shouldn't settle back
[50:42] for anything less I mean doesn't matter
[50:45] what other people don't live below your
[50:46] privilege we should live according to
[50:48] our privilege hallelujah so we should
[50:51] always have an expectation God what are
[50:53] you going to do today I mean not just in
[50:56] church but every day God what are you
[50:57] going to do
[50:58] in my life what are you gonna do when I
[51:00] get up out of bed this morning what are
[51:02] you gonna do in my life
[51:03] we should have expectation hallelujah
[51:07] Amen no sure it's going to be some
[51:12] battles as as the first church they were
[51:14] you know they had to fight fight some
[51:16] battles but we know that this is not a
[51:20] battle against flesh and blood but it's
[51:22] against teaming power amen but we have
[51:26] to recognize when Jesus died on Calvary
[51:29] he loosed the life of God was loosed
[51:32] upon the church he comes in dwells in
[51:34] you there's nothing between you and God
[51:36] anymore he breached the chasm he bridge
[51:39] the gulf hallelujah that he can dwell
[51:41] and walk with you every day of your life
[51:43] amen he's not some distant gods anymore
[51:47] now so we don't battle against demon
[51:50] power but I mean sorry we don't battle
[51:54] against flesh and blood but against
[51:55] demon power most of which comes in the
[51:58] form of religion and when it's all
[52:01] boiled down it doesn't produce the life
[52:03] of God and a people right but what
[52:06] religions are religion a religious
[52:09] spirit does not produce the wood and
[52:11] flesh it does not produce Jesus Christ
[52:14] and flesh now Satan can copy anything
[52:16] but he can't copy the word right so
[52:19] there's going to be a battle a contest
[52:21] is going on right now there's actually
[52:24] faith and doubt a fighting in this place
[52:25] in your mind is faith and doubt fighting
[52:27] and depends what you agree with what you
[52:30] agree with is where who's going to win
[52:32] so ever you cast your vote with unicast
[52:35] it was Satan and his doubt or faith in
[52:37] God right and that's who's going to win
[52:39] in here right so these are battle going
[52:42] on right now it depends what you pander
[52:46] to is what's going to win so now there's
[52:49] going to be a battle but we but we
[52:51] understand from revelations 12 at thee
[52:53] it says and I heard a loud voice so I
[52:55] don't have this on there I heard a loud
[52:57] voice saying in heaven now is come
[52:59] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[53:01] of our God and the power of us Christ
[53:03] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[53:05] down which accused them before our God
[53:09] day and night
[53:11] and they overcame him by the blood of
[53:14] the Lamb and the word of their testimony
[53:15] and they loved not their lives unto the
[53:18] death so it says that there was a war in
[53:20] heaven Satan was cast down but now
[53:23] there's some over coming upon the earth
[53:26] and so and how they overcame him was by
[53:29] the word of their testimony and by the
[53:31] blood of the Lamb was how these people
[53:32] overcame you're the devil doesn't care
[53:34] if we come to church he doesn't care if
[53:38] we say we believe the message he cares
[53:40] when the life in that word comes and
[53:42] dwells of you when the word becomes
[53:44] flesh that's when he that's when he has
[53:46] a problem with you
[53:47] he never you look at Jesus you know he
[53:50] gathers his apostles quite a few times
[53:52] in the scripture they tried to stone
[53:54] jesus the apostles were there wasn't
[53:57] they have a God who them because the
[53:59] life of God wasn't anemia the wood
[54:01] hadn't become flesh and them you they
[54:03] were gathered to the word they believe
[54:04] that word but hadn't become one with
[54:06] them yet and then after the day of
[54:08] Pentecost who are they trying to kill
[54:09] who they're trying to intimidate with
[54:11] the word had become flesh right so it's
[54:14] the same thing with you and I I mean we
[54:16] can just look on the devil doesn't
[54:18] really bother but then when we really
[54:20] become one with our Lord Jesus then he
[54:21] really tightens them it tries to bind us
[54:24] down and keep us quiet and that's when
[54:26] we're going to stand up so I know my God
[54:29] has put me here for a purpose as to
[54:31] manifest his word to be a final voice to
[54:34] a final age and Here I am this is what
[54:37] I'm here to do this is my job I'm going
[54:38] to do my job
[54:39] hallelujah glory to God so now to
[54:44] overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
[54:46] allah where do they testimony
[54:47] this is talking of you right and so the
[54:50] word of their testimony now a
[54:51] testimonies evidence given and you can
[54:55] only give evidence if you're there when
[54:57] it happened right you can't give you
[55:00] can't give testimony unless you're there
[55:02] unless you saw it unless you experienced
[55:05] it then you can really give testimony
[55:06] right so you can overcome now if you're
[55:10] if you were there you have a testimony
[55:12] so I was there when Jesus saved me right
[55:15] I was there when he washed all of my
[55:17] sins away I was there it happened to me
[55:19] right I was there when he filled me with
[55:21] the Holy Ghost I was there when he
[55:24] healed me hallelujah I was there it
[55:26] happened to me it's my testimony right
[55:29] hallelujah now we need to recognize
[55:34] sometimes you know we journey on and
[55:39] sometimes we need to look back at what
[55:42] God has done
[55:43] relive it and it increases our
[55:46] expectation of what he'll do because
[55:49] sometimes we sometimes forget him moving
[55:52] and we take it for granted just all we
[55:55] come to church and we believe the
[55:56] message it's all wonderful you know but
[55:58] the reality see we have we don't just
[56:01] have mechanics right brother I've seen
[56:03] as the rising the son the bride has both
[56:06] the mechanics and the dynamics he said
[56:09] it's like you have two Cadillacs and
[56:11] they can be the best cars they just
[56:13] rolled off the assembly line perfect in
[56:15] every way one has a spark like one
[56:17] doesn't have a spark plug the one with
[56:19] the spark plug can prove what the engine
[56:21] can do can't prove there's gasoline in
[56:23] the tank can't prove what the car can do
[56:26] because it's going to spark like it's
[56:27] got a fire to ignite what's in the tank
[56:29] right and unless that fires you can say
[56:32] anything you want you can't prove it
[56:34] right but the Bride of Christ doesn't
[56:36] just have the mechanics doesn't just
[56:37] have the Cadillac but it has the fire in
[56:40] it to prove what's in the tank to prove
[56:42] what the engine can do hallelujah is the
[56:45] same thing with you and I friends we
[56:46] don't just talk about the cross we have
[56:49] the life that was released so we can
[56:51] prove the victory that he won because he
[56:53] manifested in our life right that's why
[56:56] I love I love you know how these two
[56:57] parts of redemption the first body he
[57:00] purchases his bride and the second party
[57:02] claims his bride the second part you get
[57:05] to enjoy and live out everything you did
[57:07] in the first part right so now he
[57:09] purchased it it's like mention if I had
[57:11] a whole bunch of money and I went and
[57:13] bought some island someplace tropical
[57:14] island so I purchased it but what's good
[57:17] at just buying it unless you go to live
[57:18] there and enjoy it right what's good so
[57:21] honey we're going to holiday island or
[57:24] something and and what if she just tells
[57:27] if I forgot this island we got this
[57:29] island I forgot this island and people
[57:30] say have you ever been to it
[57:32] well no but we've got this island you
[57:35] know but then when you go and enjoy it
[57:37] you go and experience it that's very
[57:40] different cuz now yeah we're up this
[57:42] island and Here I am enjoying the island
[57:44] hallelujah
[57:46] it's the same thing now this message we
[57:48] just enjoy what he did for us that's
[57:50] what the message does opens up gifts to
[57:52] you
[57:53] redemption gives Hugh Watson
[57:58] the power of the blood is manifested in
[58:00] a brave I mean so he he died that he'd
[58:02] become one with God and man and that's
[58:04] why God's Spirit moves among us
[58:06] hallelujah that's why it comes and
[58:08] dwells in you maybe because you're
[58:09] enjoying his what he purchased on
[58:11] Calvary you're enjoying in your life he
[58:13] comes and heals you hallelujah he gives
[58:16] you peace of passes all understanding
[58:17] right hallelujah
[58:20] you know I'm so glad I was thinking
[58:22] about he say well I'm not we had now the
[58:28] frogs are leaving Oh Amy I think it's
[58:34] like we we shouldn't live below
[58:36] expectation you know when we say the
[58:38] Spirit of God moves it's not something
[58:40] we imagined right you had talked I've
[58:42] had times I felt drunk under the under
[58:45] the power of God I felt I felt drunk I
[58:48] used to be a drunk so I felt that way
[58:51] but there's no perverse part of it and
[58:52] if once praying we're just rejoicing and
[58:55] God was there staggering like a drunk
[58:57] person hallelujah you you get a drink of
[59:00] this wine and it's way better than even
[59:02] two drivers ride in the world how long
[59:05] it just gives you peace and you never
[59:07] regret the next morning at all what
[59:08] happened to me you say hallelujah it
[59:11] happened to me I wouldn't do it again
[59:13] and you become an addict hallelujah you
[59:15] become hooked you gotta make up to the
[59:18] Spirit of God hallelujah we maybe you
[59:21] say well you know people sometimes just
[59:23] think they just they just can find God
[59:26] to moving in church God doesn't just
[59:28] move in Church got to move outside of
[59:30] church he said I never leave you nor
[59:32] forsake you I mean we used to have youth
[59:34] meetings down in Christ Church and we
[59:37] would watch brother cloud ratings
[59:38] brother wrong Spencer you know and at
[59:40] the end God always moved the spirit ago
[59:43] I just came down SiC him on you he was
[59:44] there
[59:45] and we were praying well a lot I think
[59:47] the last one we had we're praying as
[59:49] like a beam came down to the room we all
[59:51] had our eyes closed we could literally
[59:52] pick it come down it came anointed
[59:55] tongues interpretation happen God moved
[59:58] hallelujah that's just in our house they
[1:00:02] meant we've had times I thought the
[1:00:04] pillar of fire is right there feel like
[1:00:06] you could literally leave this world go
[1:00:08] to the next world hallelujah God lives
[1:00:11] he's a being I mean Abraham Moses met
[1:00:15] God in the burning bush that same God is
[1:00:17] here to be met he's not far away
[1:00:19] someplace he's present that's why we're
[1:00:22] going to create an atmosphere around us
[1:00:23] I mean that we we try be true human we
[1:00:27] try and keep order and different things
[1:00:29] if God is anointing it's always an order
[1:00:31] as I say brother Bram burly pull tells a
[1:00:33] testimony there's a sister and your
[1:00:36] brand tabernacle gets excited against
[1:00:38] the swinger handbag throws it across the

[1:01:51] learn as I said we don't just learn
[1:01:52] about the cross and how jesus paid it
[1:01:54] all but we actually experience it I mean

[1:01:59] washed away you know what it's like you
[1:02:01] know what it's like to be free you know
[1:02:03] we have to go back like the children of

[1:08:10] John had her John was weeping when he's
[1:08:13] up in heaven so he's standing on
[1:08:15] mas right he's standing he's on the Isle
[1:08:18] of Patmos he's carried up by the Spirit
[1:08:20] of God into eternity and he any and he
[1:08:23] sees the four and twenty elders he sees
[1:08:25] the book the book sealed in the right
[1:08:27] hand of him that sat on the throne and
[1:08:29] he's weeping he's the one who leaned on
[1:08:32] Jesus bosom is the one who soon him
[1:08:35] resurrect right here's the one who's our
[1:08:38] there on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:39] but he's weeping because this is the
[1:08:41] book in the right hand of the original
[1:08:43] owner he doesn't see anyone worthy to
[1:08:46] take the book he went much but then one
[1:08:49] of the Angels will the elders he don't
[1:08:51] weep John the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:08:55] is prevailed holy and the turning saw
[1:08:58] him come out of the eternity wounded
[1:09:00] bloody overcome the Lamb he saw Eterna
[1:09:04] saw a lamb holy that's why when you see
[1:09:06] God in this message it's not as not a
[1:09:09] judge to judge this world you should see
[1:09:11] a lamb because we are the Lambs wife how
[1:09:14] they see your sacrifice your mercy your
[1:09:16] high priest your intercessor your
[1:09:18] Redeemer that's what you should see
[1:09:20] hallelujah and any sturm take the book
[1:09:22] and in the four and twenty elders cast
[1:09:25] down their crowns and they begin to
[1:09:27] rejoice and then John began to rejoice
[1:09:29] is it everything in heaven and on earth
[1:09:31] under this whom acquire glory blessing
[1:09:34] honor hallelujah to the lamb and brother
[1:09:37] Brahim says John got excited because
[1:09:39] John saw John John saw himself beyond
[1:09:42] the curtain of time he sees it in the
[1:09:43] breech message he said John got happy
[1:09:46] because he saw himself beyond the
[1:09:48] curtain of time so when the book came
[1:09:50] open he began to rejoice even though he
[1:09:52] is with the one who who was going to
[1:09:54] take that book it's wheat because in you
[1:09:57] have no man will show him where they
[1:09:58] take the book everything stuck and God
[1:10:01] doesn't like stuck God doesn't do stuck
[1:10:04] he does redemption he does full
[1:10:07] restoration that's how that's what our
[1:10:10] God does
[1:10:10] polio so he looked beyond here he is
[1:10:13] standing on Patmos he looks beyond the
[1:10:14] curtain of time he sees himself up there
[1:10:16] rejoicing redeemed hallelujah and that's
[1:10:20] the bride's revival John represents the
[1:10:23] bride in the book of Revelation right
[1:10:25] and that is the bride's revival when we
[1:10:27] see the word come open the
[1:10:28] else come off the book and the mighty
[1:10:30] onion says you earned this book this is
[1:10:32] you hallelujah this represents you and
[1:10:36] then we begin to realize well we're part
[1:10:37] of redemption
[1:10:38] I mean God's focuses are sexually you
[1:10:41] know God's focus is you and the sour
[1:10:44] hallelujah you're not just to tack on
[1:10:46] your the whole thing over here we need
[1:10:53] to I pray we could just
[1:10:55] he's on Patmos though I was thinking
[1:10:56] about this the other day because we
[1:10:58] think he's there but he's actually he's
[1:10:59] in a prison
[1:11:00] he's on a prison island do you think he
[1:11:03] was the same John after that
[1:11:06] hallelujah we we're still here right
[1:11:10] we're still in this body but we
[1:11:12] shouldn't be the same old people when it
[1:11:15] becomes more than horse riders you see
[1:11:18] the lamb because more than tribulation
[1:11:20] two witnesses the semen seal comes open
[1:11:23] to you that's Christ Himself coming to
[1:11:25] you right showing you that you're part
[1:11:27] of the plan because he's seventh seal
[1:11:28] winds up all things that's the end of
[1:11:30] time the end of the world systems the
[1:11:32] end of sin the end of all things it's
[1:11:34] all wound up in the seventh seal right
[1:11:37] and when you find yourself God reveals
[1:11:39] it to you that that seal is him as
[1:11:42] Christ Himself then you begin to realize
[1:11:44] we're at the end and I'm part of the
[1:11:46] winding up and my in destination of
[1:11:49] streets of gold hallelujah and the devil
[1:11:53] can't dance their holy hallelujah will
[1:11:56] be dancing he'll be burning hallelujah I
[1:11:59] think we should I think we should keep
[1:12:01] that on our hearts don't you think I
[1:12:02] like the end of the book come over here
[1:12:05] glory to God now you say but we're not
[1:12:09] Pentecostal people not by organization
[1:12:13] brother Brahim says that Pentecost is an
[1:12:15] experience right an experience so we are
[1:12:18] Pentecostal in that way but we're not
[1:12:20] living in a Pentecostal age we're living
[1:12:22] in the bride age while we everything
[1:12:24] that Adam lost has been restored we've
[1:12:26] been taken back to the original faith
[1:12:28] hallelujah glory to God brother a season
[1:12:32] spoke of where the original seed he says
[1:12:34] high breeding first started an Eden
[1:12:37] started in Genesis it's the beginning
[1:12:38] that's where it ends up over here in
[1:12:40] Revelation at the scene
[1:12:42] coming of Christ but now remember
[1:12:44] quickly he says that's why each
[1:12:46] generation has its own revival it gets a
[1:12:49] chance at the word then they highbreed
[1:12:52] it instead of taking it on they go
[1:12:54] somewhere else that's why every jet
[1:12:55] that's why God opens his word to to
[1:12:58] every generation because the previous
[1:12:59] generation gets off to the wrong thing
[1:13:01] about hybrid if they add man's ideas but
[1:13:03] this is the end you were going to
[1:13:04] realize we're the end of that cycle the
[1:13:07] cycle of revival and death has been
[1:13:09] broken hallelujah that we are not here
[1:13:11] to have revival than death and then
[1:13:13] another group raised up and revival and
[1:13:15] death as has happened you read the book
[1:13:17] of Judges revival and death revival and
[1:13:19] death even through the kings revival and
[1:13:22] a holy a down through church history
[1:13:23] revival and death that's the end of
[1:13:26] those things we're living at the
[1:13:27] breaking of that cycle where it's not
[1:13:30] revival and death it's just revival
[1:13:32] that's a quickening and awakening holy
[1:13:35] that we don't go down to death we just
[1:13:36] keep growing on and on but every
[1:13:38] generation has its chance at the word
[1:13:40] for every generation has a chance for
[1:13:43] God to live in them God to manifest his
[1:13:45] word in them I mean when they when when
[1:13:48] when you begin to realize hey God is
[1:13:50] here have we realized God is here ever
[1:13:53] realized that he walks among us I mean
[1:13:55] we shouldn't put a limit on what he can
[1:13:57] do hallelujah he can do all things as I
[1:13:59] said on Wednesday there's a voice came
[1:14:01] out of the throne window third horse
[1:14:03] rider was riding forth touchy not the
[1:14:05] oil and the wine so do not put a limit
[1:14:07] on my revelation then I put a limit on
[1:14:10] the stimulation by revelation touch it
[1:14:12] not devil you can't touch this I'm gonna
[1:14:14] pour it out in full hallelujah and
[1:14:17] that's where we are aren't we I mean
[1:14:19] we're not here just to have a bit of a
[1:14:20] feast
[1:14:21] just like when when Jesus you know you
[1:14:23] know it's Jesus first miracle six
[1:14:26] waterpots of purification turns the
[1:14:28] water into wine he's the seventh those
[1:14:31] ones you can drink empty you can't drink

[1:15:01] having a revival see it's jumping and
[1:15:03] shaking why there's a Russian mighty
[1:15:05] wouldn't coming down on it I thought
[1:15:06] well you know what

[1:15:09] there right now than it was when it was
[1:15:11] perfectly still no more water in it

[1:15:21] bank that's what we need a washing out
[1:15:23] of unbelief on the bank let the Word of
[1:15:25] God have preeminence that's what we need
[1:15:27] a revival to and wash out all the
[1:15:29] unbelief all the bugs and superstitions
[1:15:31] and things come out and see God is still
[1:15:34] God that's what we have revivals for and
[1:15:36] that's what the brides revival is washes
[1:15:38] all the trash out of your life Spirit of
[1:15:40] God sweeps through the church moves over
[1:15:42] your soul sweeps all the bugs and
[1:15:44] superstition hallelujah that we can be a
[1:15:46] cleared clear lake hallelujah Amy but
[1:15:50] that's what we have revivals for that's
[1:15:51] what God does he sends a spirit upon the
[1:15:53] earth blows over the place holy it
[1:15:56] transforms lives remember he is the same
[1:15:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:16:00] brother Bram says the Ephesian Church
[1:16:02] age he says the key given to me this is
[1:16:05] when he's looking at what the church
[1:16:06] ain't messengers are who they were
[1:16:09] rather the key given to me the Lord
[1:16:11] whereby I was able to determine the
[1:16:12] messenger for each age as a most
[1:16:14] scriptural one in fact it's called the
[1:16:16] keystone of the Bible that's the
[1:16:19] Keystone the holds it all together it is
[1:16:21] the revelation that G that God never
[1:16:23] changes and that his ways are as
[1:16:25] unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8
[1:16:28] says Jesus Christ the same little say
[1:16:31] that the same the same yesterday today
[1:16:33] and forever Ecclesiastes 3:14 15 I know
[1:16:38] that whatsoever God doeth it shall be
[1:16:41] forever nothing can be put to it nor
[1:16:44] anything taken from it and God do with
[1:16:47] it that men should fear before him that
[1:16:50] which hath been is now and that which
[1:16:52] hath already been and God requires that
[1:16:56] which is passed here it is an unchanging
[1:16:59] God with unchanging ways what he did at
[1:17:01] the first he will keep on doing until
[1:17:04] we're down for the last time there will
[1:17:06] never be a change apply that to the
[1:17:08] church ages
[1:17:09] is the kind of men that God chose for
[1:17:11] the first stage in how God manifested in
[1:17:13] that man's ministry would be the example
[1:17:14] for all the other ages what God did in
[1:17:16] the first church age is what he wants to
[1:17:19] do in all other ages
[1:17:21] he says the keystone of the scripture
[1:17:22] he's the same he doesn't change so when
[1:17:26] I read when I read the New Testament
[1:17:27] he's the same God when I read about
[1:17:30] Moses when I read about Enoch taking a
[1:17:32] rapture he walked with God he's the same
[1:17:35] God Elijah on Mount Carmel same God God
[1:17:39] will fight for you yeah God of God
[1:17:41] backed up his word you know as word as
[1:17:43] as bright as his word I mean God defends
[1:17:46] his word hallelujah we're not here to
[1:17:48] fight the battle he fights the battle he
[1:17:50] he backs up who he will hallelujah God
[1:17:54] fights the battle so he's the same God
[1:17:56] with Moses same God he's the same with
[1:17:59] Joshua the same hallelujah all the way
[1:18:03] down through the same down to the New
[1:18:06] Testament era the same so when I read
[1:18:09] about God and the boss that you're the
[1:18:10] same one today you're not a different
[1:18:12] one I mean if you could if you can cause
[1:18:14] people will come out of prison like you
[1:18:15] did Peter you're the same God today if
[1:18:17] you can heal Legion to deliver Legion
[1:18:19] you you still deliver today if you can
[1:18:21] come down the day of Pentecost and fill
[1:18:23] your church they stagger around like
[1:18:24] drunk people
[1:18:25] amen as the fulfillment of prophecy has
[1:18:27] happened he's the same God today

[1:19:28] because I give water in the wilderness
[1:19:30] and rivers in the desert to drink to

[1:19:36] people I fall for myself they shall show
[1:19:38] forth my praise hallelujah sir I will
[1:19:41] bring I will bring waters in the desert

[1:19:50] water that never runs dry we are not we
[1:19:53] don't have some broken system someplace
[1:19:55] where that artesian well of the Holy
[1:19:57] Ghost that is gushing forth hallelujah
[1:20:00] so we have drink I mean who is drank
[1:20:03] from the fountain and found it to be
[1:20:05] good hallelujah and there's no wiggle
[1:20:08] tails in it it's not lukewarm it's not
[1:20:11] you don't have to scrape all this
[1:20:12] whatever off the side of centrifuges
[1:20:15] down to get water it's clear hallelujah
[1:20:18] it's not got anything bad not anything
[1:20:20] man-made it's just clear rivers of
[1:20:22] living water get it what I'm glad about
[1:20:24] we have the wood and the spirit we have
[1:20:27] an open wood and we have God to quicken
[1:20:29] that word to us I mean we don't have one
[1:20:31] or the other we are both I mean both are
[1:20:33] running together hallelujah that's why I
[1:20:37] said before we have the mechanics and
[1:20:39] the dynamics you're gonna have all the
[1:20:40] mechanics you want but you neither
[1:20:41] dynamics to make it to go down the road
[1:20:43] and by the grace God supreme grace the
[1:20:47] bride has both the mechanics and the
[1:20:49] dynamic Alleluia amen so now we have
[1:20:54] these this people are formed for myself
[1:20:57] they shall show forth my praise
[1:21:00] hallelujah and you and we praise God
[1:21:03] because the revelation he has given us
[1:21:05] that's why John could praise God when he
[1:21:07] saw the book open he began to really
[1:21:09] worship God because he received a
[1:21:11] revelation you're part of the plan of
[1:21:13] redemption you're part of the winding up
[1:21:15] of the plan and he's a symbol of you I
[1:21:17] trust when you see John in the scripture
[1:21:19] in the book of Revelation you see
[1:21:21] yourself like us here's John he's
[1:21:23] standing on there all of Patmos he is a
[1:21:25] voice behind him God's going to put him
[1:21:27] and put you in time put the bride in
[1:21:29] time his a voice behind him he turns
[1:21:31] around he sees seven golden candlesticks
[1:21:33] he says one like the Son of Man
[1:21:35] walking among candlesticks see he's
[1:21:37] already advanced past the church ages
[1:21:39] and hears a voice behind me to show this
[1:21:42] is what's happened this is what's going
[1:21:43] to happen or what is happening this is
[1:21:45] what will happen
[1:21:46] helllooo you it's like we've come the
[1:21:49] bride has come out of lady I see and the
[1:21:50] will saloon lady ousia right but the
[1:21:53] bride has lifted up into a bride age
[1:21:55] because God is not there anymore he's
[1:21:57] not in the church world anymore he's
[1:21:59] with his bride hallelujah so now John is
[1:22:02] representing you because God wants you
[1:22:03] to say this is where you are and I'm
[1:22:06] because at the end of that time what
[1:22:07] he's lifted up the heaven in a rapture
[1:22:10] lujah so that and you see brother
[1:22:12] Branham whenever the angel says to John
[1:22:13] come and see go look into the message
[1:22:16] and the things that John was told to
[1:22:19] come and see that's the messenger
[1:22:21] himself preaches on those things go have
[1:22:24] a look it's a personal book it's a
[1:22:25] bride's book it's not a book of mystery
[1:22:28] book of symbols to us I miss God says
[1:22:31] this is where you are this is what the
[1:22:32] devil's doing we're not ignorant of his
[1:22:34] devices this is where you are this is
[1:22:37] where I am this is where I'm going to
[1:22:39] thank you hallelujah so we should just
[1:22:42] rejoice Allu you as sees in Luke 15 it's
[1:22:50] a parable of the of the woman that had
[1:22:55] ten pieces of silver she lost one now
[1:22:58] and then she looked lights of candles
[1:23:00] she sweeps the house trying to find that
[1:23:02] which she has lost and then when she
[1:23:04] finds that she rejoices tells everybody
[1:23:06] looked at which I have lost I have found
[1:23:08] now those coins is like a wedding band
[1:23:11] they the ten coins and they're here and
[1:23:13] if they lose one they're considered an
[1:23:15] immoral wife so now it she's got a
[1:23:18] redeemed Church and redeemed that which
[1:23:21] she is lost right so she lights a candle
[1:23:25] we have a candle we have a light and you
[1:23:28] begin to search now what belongs to me
[1:23:30] because you know blows you there's a
[1:23:32] place for it right there's a place she
[1:23:35] knew she meant to have ten coins right
[1:23:37] and what I'd lost you knew one two three
[1:23:40] four five six seven eight nine is a hole
[1:23:43] I'm missing something there should be
[1:23:46] something in here
[1:23:47] if the devil has taken your joy right if
[1:23:51] the devil's taking your peace if the
[1:23:53] devil's taking your long-suffering your
[1:23:55] faith your rejoicing your first love
[1:23:57] that's your inheritance that belongs to
[1:24:00] you I mean a real prayer life joy just
[1:24:02] to walk with God joy unspeakable full of
[1:24:05] glory that's what we have we don't just
[1:24:08] cabbage down you know God doesn't God
[1:24:11] has never called anyone to come in with
[1:24:12] a full zeal and a rejoicing and then
[1:24:15] just well I'm mature now I just calm
[1:24:17] down and you know we're just a bit more
[1:24:19] no the fire should get greater I mean
[1:24:22] the love should get more holy the piece
[1:24:24] should get greater you should be more in
[1:24:26] love more happy with Jesus more
[1:24:29] rejoicing in his word that's how we
[1:24:30] should be that's how we should be Amen
[1:24:33] it's just like a like a real marriage
[1:24:35] more low hallelujah because you know
[1:24:38] each other better you understand each
[1:24:40] other more you appreciate how the more
[1:24:42] how this gets great it doesn't just
[1:24:44] plateau and well this is my role and I'm
[1:24:46] the husband and she's the wife and these
[1:24:48] are children and this is our job
[1:24:50] description and I'm just doing a job and
[1:24:52] no mercy ma oh god help us no no way
[1:24:56] it's not like that it's not like with
[1:24:58] God well he's my Savior and I see the
[1:25:01] plan of redemption I can take you
[1:25:03] through the message from from the first
[1:25:05] one to your all the way down to future
[1:25:07] home into Communion and put it all
[1:25:09] together
[1:25:09] oh this is those things are good both at
[1:25:12] the life without the life it's good to
[1:25:15] quote it you're the devil actually oh
[1:25:17] I'll tell you something this thing can't
[1:25:20] quote me the message and the Bible way
[1:25:23] better than me and it can do it in
[1:25:26] multiple languages I can only do it
[1:25:28] billion one so this thing can out quote
[1:25:32] me it can say brother Brahim says way
[1:25:34] more than me or Jesus says this or the
[1:25:37] Bible says this but this is never going
[1:25:39] to produce the life of God this will
[1:25:42] never ever this was not ordained to
[1:25:44] produce the life of God this the soul of
[1:25:47] man is ordained that God would dwell in
[1:25:49] there to produce the life of God so it's
[1:25:52] more than just quoting it's lived it's
[1:25:54] going to live in you I mean that God
[1:25:56] would quicken and I always pray Lord
[1:25:58] when we hear this mess
[1:25:59] clicking it to my soul to produce a life
[1:26:02] of God in me telling it when I read the
[1:26:04] scripture I'm not here to learn
[1:26:05] something but you would take your word
[1:26:07] quicken into my soul that I would become
[1:26:09] the living manifestation of that word
[1:26:11] hallelujah Moses received the law what
[1:26:16] did it make him the meekest manual the
[1:26:18] earth that's an attribute of Christ's
[1:26:19] character cause he received the law by
[1:26:21] revelation the scribes and Pharisees
[1:26:23] they learn the same law they are proud
[1:26:25] arrogant people and when people come in
[1:26:27] or they leave and they say well I was
[1:26:29] proud on the message I'll say very
[1:26:31] simply they never meet him they learnt
[1:26:33] it they learnt it or people are living
[1:26:36] in fear they never meet him because when
[1:26:38] you really meet him there's no fear
[1:26:39] there's no fear I'm not afraid I'm not
[1:26:42] afraid of him he's not my judge to
[1:26:44] condemn me guilty
[1:26:45] he's my judge to previous hallelujah
[1:26:50] just like the woman taken in adultery
[1:26:52] where are thy accusers he's the supreme
[1:26:55] judge he it just yeah well let's just go
[1:26:59] back a bit he preaches the Sermon on the
[1:27:01] Mount
[1:27:02] he's the lawgiver that was with Moses
[1:27:05] gave him the law the same lord give us
[1:27:07] now in flesh he preaches the Sermon on
[1:27:09] the Mount he magnifies the law you have
[1:27:12] heard of old time he shall not commit
[1:27:14] adultery I said you he seven looks upon
[1:27:16] a woman to lust after and as hard as
[1:27:17] commit adultery already you shall not
[1:27:19] commit murder I say but I say to you if
[1:27:21] your anger with your brother had a cause
[1:27:23] you're guilty he magnifies the law and
[1:27:27] then now in the days of Moses the leper
[1:27:29] was thrust out of the camp right wasn't
[1:27:32] even allowed near the same law givers in
[1:27:35] flesh he comes off the mountain he comes
[1:27:37] a leper Lord a foul will make me clean
[1:27:40] he says I will be their hole hallelujah
[1:27:44] son of the blood of bulls and goats that
[1:27:46] leper was cast out but now the lawgiver
[1:27:50] who just magnified the law who's full of
[1:27:51] grace and truth
[1:27:53] hallelujah comes and that lip actually
[1:27:55] is allowed to come to him and he's no
[1:27:57] longer a leper hallelujah because grace
[1:28:00] overshadows the law right but if there's
[1:28:02] no grace then you're in fear but when
[1:28:04] grace comes upon your heart you're not
[1:28:06] afraid anymore
[1:28:07] the woman's caught in adultery here's
[1:28:08] the supreme judge riding in the sand
[1:28:11] with his
[1:28:12] hee hee servers without sin let him cast
[1:28:14] the first we probably would have been
[1:28:15] right-handed I don't know
[1:28:16] and then if one drops their stones walks
[1:28:20] away and he says to her woman where sine
[1:28:23] accuses and she says there's none my
[1:28:26] lord supreme one hallelujah neither do i
[1:28:30] condemn thee go and sin no more see the
[1:28:33] devil he wants to bring us to a trial he
[1:28:37] wants to bring us to a trial but you
[1:28:39] know who he proves guilty himself who
[1:28:43] does he prove innocent it's God that
[1:28:47] justifies it's God that calls X God that
[1:28:50] glorifies it's not man we're not we
[1:28:53] don't sell I don't justify myself or do
[1:28:56] those no dude that's him right and
[1:28:59] someone who's really coming to that
[1:29:00] relationship knows it's him
[1:29:01] it's not me that's the Christian he's
[1:29:03] the Christian and me he's the one that
[1:29:05] keeps his word in me I don't have to say
[1:29:08] well I've got a you know I never waked
[1:29:10] well well you wake up in the morning you
[1:29:14] know yeah I'll leave it but I don't
[1:29:18] think in my mind well I have to behave
[1:29:20] this way and I have to do this I got to
[1:29:22] keep myself from this I shouldn't do
[1:29:24] this I've got a dress this kind of way
[1:29:25] and you know I just get up that's how
[1:29:29] men you right you shouldn't be trying to
[1:29:32] keep the word that's where people fall
[1:29:33] apart they try and keep the message well
[1:29:35] I'm a message believes over two doesn't
[1:29:36] let us know if he's in you he keeps it
[1:29:39] that's why it's actually you enter into
[1:29:42] rest you are not striving anymore you
[1:29:45] enter into rest and eternal Sabbath
[1:29:48] right so the bride is now resting it's
[1:29:52] not me that do it the works it's my
[1:29:54] father dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:29:57] that's why a lot of people get so that's
[1:30:00] why I say Oh God just bring them a full
[1:30:01] birth stop travailing just just birth
[1:30:04] the child give yourself to him
[1:30:06] hallelujah don't hold back otherwise you
[1:30:08] always be stressed just just give let go
[1:30:12] and let God
[1:30:13] that's why brother Jeremy said take your
[1:30:15] hands off the bar
[1:30:16] enjoy the ride hallelujah
[1:30:19] Buffalo earlier and maybe some corkscrew
[1:30:22] and loop the loop and you can't see your
[1:30:24] you know whatever let go Lord this is
[1:30:28] going to take me up holy hahaa just
[1:30:31] enjoy the ride but you've gotta enter
[1:30:33] into rest
[1:30:35] hallelujah he that enters into rest
[1:30:38] ceases from their own works their own
[1:30:40] works of trying to be a believer no let
[1:30:42] him be the believer in you that's all
[1:30:44] you need to do that's what the missus
[1:30:46] came to do take us from traditions
[1:30:48] brother I said Pentecostals were good
[1:30:50] legalists as that part of the body but
[1:30:52] now we have the mind of Christ right
[1:30:55] that doesn't mean we don't do away with
[1:30:56] sanctification
[1:30:57] we don't do away with holiness but he's
[1:30:59] the one who makes us holy if you're
[1:31:01] going to give you a will hallelujah I'm
[1:31:05] so glad it's such a freedom hallelujah I
[1:31:07] mean your own flesh is dead I mean you
[1:31:10] know we're living is dead only you don't
[1:31:12] need to worry about oh I've got to do
[1:31:13] this this and you know he pleases
[1:31:16] himself in you you know with faith they
[1:31:19] says let's go to Hebrews 11 holy let's
[1:31:22] go to Hebrews 11 and one Kolia
[1:31:26] we know faith is a revelation c is here
[1:31:38] now faith is the substance of things
[1:31:42] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:31:45] seen
[1:31:46] now we know the word hope in the Bible
[1:31:48] is to have expectation with pleasure
[1:31:51] right you're under it's not a stab in
[1:31:53] the dark hope you have an expectation
[1:31:55] it's a hope so you're expecting it's
[1:31:58] going to happen hallelujah
[1:31:59] you're under expectation it's on that's
[1:32:02] why we have expectation for the rapture
[1:32:04] because there's a hope faith has given
[1:32:06] you the expectation for a body change
[1:32:09] hallelujah now for by it the elders
[1:32:13] obtained a good report for through faith
[1:32:16] we understand that the worlds were
[1:32:17] framed by the Word of God so that things
[1:32:20] which are seen are not made of things
[1:32:23] which sorry things which are seen were
[1:32:26] not made of things which do appear by
[1:32:29] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:32:31] excellent sacrifice
[1:32:33] then that have came by which he obtained
[1:32:35] witness that he was righteous God
[1:32:37] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:32:39] being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch
[1:32:43] was translated that he should not see
[1:32:45] death and was not found because God had
[1:32:48] translated him for before his
[1:32:50] translation he had this testimony that
[1:32:52] he pleased God for without faith it's
[1:32:56] impossible to please him now let's just
[1:32:59] stay right let's just stop right there
[1:33:00] let's turn that around so see it's here
[1:33:03] but without faith it's impossible to
[1:33:04] please him I say but with faith it's
[1:33:07] impossible not to please him right so if
[1:33:11] you have real faith God has quickened
[1:33:14] his word to you you have real faith
[1:33:16] revelation faith as he become real to
[1:33:19] you I'd say yes then if you have that
[1:33:23] kind of faith it's impossible not to
[1:33:25] please him hallelujah hallelujah to God
[1:33:30] hallelujah for he that cometh to God
[1:33:34] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:33:35] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:33:37] Him hallelujah it's impossible not to
[1:33:41] please him now aren't you glad about
[1:33:44] that if you have real real faith not
[1:33:45] just trying to believe or some well my
[1:33:47] daddy told me my mommy told me it
[1:33:49] becomes real to you
[1:33:50] he becomes personal to you hallelujah
[1:33:54] glory to God they season Deuteronomy
[1:33:58] let's just jump through this a bit he
[1:34:00] said in Deuteronomy 6 and 20 and when my
[1:34:03] sons
[1:34:03] ask thee in time to come saying what
[1:34:05] mean the testimonies and the statutes
[1:34:07] and the judgments which the Lord our God
[1:34:09] hath commanded you now then shall say
[1:34:12] unto thy son we were pharaoh's bondsman
[1:34:15] in Egypt and the Lord brought us up out
[1:34:17] of Egypt with a mighty hand and the Lord
[1:34:20] showed signs and wonders great and so
[1:34:22] upon Egypt upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[1:34:25] house her household before our eyes and
[1:34:27] he brought us out from thence that we
[1:34:30] might bring that he might bring us in to
[1:34:33] give us the land which he sware unto our
[1:34:35] fathers and the law commanded us to do
[1:34:37] all these statutes to fear the Lord our
[1:34:39] God for our for our good always that he
[1:34:42] might preserve us alive as it is at this
[1:34:45] day
[1:34:46] and it shall be our righteousness if we
[1:34:48] observe to do all these Commandments
[1:34:50] before the Lord our God as he doth
[1:34:52] commanded us so notice what they begin
[1:34:55] with what mean all these things and they
[1:34:59] go into the testimony we were in
[1:35:00] Pharaoh's house we were his bondsman as
[1:35:04] slaves but then the Lord came and
[1:35:06] brought us out
[1:35:07] he brought us out so we were one slave
[1:35:09] that's why we've got to keep our
[1:35:10] testimony shouldn't be some dead
[1:35:12] memorial right we should always keep it
[1:35:15] alive right this is what God has done
[1:35:17] for us this is why we're here this is
[1:35:20] what we've been called out because God
[1:35:22] called us out and now we're a free
[1:35:24] people in the land and God gave us this
[1:35:26] word Pylea to keep us victorious in this
[1:35:29] place it's not - yeah the law I know
[1:35:31] I've said it before but the law wasn't
[1:35:34] really something just to bind the people
[1:35:36] down the purpose of the law is that they
[1:35:38] would dwell in their land that they
[1:35:40] would be victorious every man would
[1:35:42] dwell under the earnest vineyard and
[1:35:44] under his olive tree whatever more and
[1:35:46] that possessed the fullness of the land
[1:35:47] and if the enemy ever tried to come and
[1:35:49] they'd be killed that was the reason for
[1:35:51] the law that God would come and dwell
[1:35:52] among his people and many times we just
[1:35:55] look at the negative of people that the
[1:35:56] devil always loves to anointing the
[1:35:57] negative he never ever says well you see
[1:36:01] that person he was once a drunk and that
[1:36:02] person was once an adulterer and that
[1:36:04] person was in the sin and that person
[1:36:06] was this way and she was a prostitute
[1:36:07] but then but then God came and delivered
[1:36:09] them and they became new creatures and
[1:36:11] their old life was dead and you know he
[1:36:13] never points that out
[1:36:14] he never points out what the word does
[1:36:16] for the believer never ever has he ever
[1:36:19] done that he always points at all but
[1:36:22] you got to do this and you got to do it
[1:36:23] you look at the wrong things
[1:36:26] Allu you what is it done for you I'm not
[1:36:29] the person I used to be hallelujah and I
[1:36:32] thank God that I'm not that person and
[1:36:35] you should bow it doesn't matter how
[1:36:36] long you've known the Lord for you say
[1:36:38] thank God I wasn't I'm not that person
[1:36:40] anymore thank God I'm not part of that
[1:36:42] group thank God I'm not walking in
[1:36:44] darkness anymore thank God I'm not
[1:36:45] trying to Pat it to my friends and
[1:36:47] please them and whatever who cares about
[1:36:49] that well I want to look cool who cares
[1:36:51] about looking cool I want to look cool
[1:36:53] with God
[1:36:54] hallelujah I wanna be in his team
[1:36:57] hallelujah doesn't that matter Amy
[1:37:02] glory to God now I want to just go into
[1:37:08] this so we are we're anointed to speak
[1:37:12] as I say just rejoice the devil wants to
[1:37:17] bind us down you know if I you don't
[1:37:20] have to raise your hands
[1:37:21] but 9 times out of 10 before you come to
[1:37:25] church is it all peaceful and happy at
[1:37:27] home you know you just you know just
[1:37:31] like a perfect day it's like okay kids a
[1:37:33] symbol yes and they get ready and
[1:37:36] they're waiting for you in the car and
[1:37:38] there's no trouble
[1:37:39] everything's fine between you and your
[1:37:40] spouse 9 times out there never like that
[1:37:43] because the devil knows if you're just
[1:37:46] get in contact with God if you just get
[1:37:48] into his presence one time and really
[1:37:50] rejoice and God can take over your vocal
[1:37:53] cords and speak things into the earth
[1:37:55] amen a manifest in South Korea he's in
[1:37:58] trouble the temples in a lot of trouble
[1:38:00] hallelujah and that's wasters he tries
[1:38:03] to cause trouble and then we have the
[1:38:05] soy our mind you know I heard it I know
[1:38:09] a brother said it but there was a I
[1:38:11] think from America someone in there and
[1:38:13] there's a some people came to some
[1:38:15] special meetings and the wife and the
[1:38:18] husband they had such a big fight before
[1:38:20] church and then they're in service and
[1:38:22] he's just rejoicing and he's praising
[1:38:24] God and he's giving him glory and she's
[1:38:26] all like this inside and she's so angry
[1:38:29] at him and she's half the service how
[1:38:31] can you do that you just said that to me
[1:38:33] and this will happen how can you do that
[1:38:35] in church and the husband just says God
[1:38:37] never did anything bad for me he never
[1:38:40] did anything bad to me
[1:38:41] I made a worshipper you understand what
[1:38:43] I'm saying he didn't have a grudge
[1:38:45] against him they may have things they
[1:38:47] need to sort out but Heath that was
[1:38:49] already sorted out the blood of Jesus
[1:38:51] Christ made that right that's way just
[1:38:53] worshipped him hallelujah
[1:38:55] so just this coat hooks up there hang
[1:38:58] you trouble up
[1:39:00] forget forget to pick it up when you
[1:39:03] leave
[1:39:03] forget to pick it up when you leave but
[1:39:05] just hang it trouble up doesn't matter
[1:39:07] what's been going on I'm facing a
[1:39:10] mountain hallelujah hallelujah I mean
[1:39:13] the children of Israel they face the
[1:39:15] Jericho they just must surround it with
[1:39:17] the word and trumpets in at the time
[1:39:18] they blew and shouted then they won only
[1:39:21] so just just leave it there
[1:39:24] take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[1:39:26] it there Allu yeah you may find that's
[1:39:31] why you know we always try and fix I
[1:39:32] think it's a man thing we try and fix
[1:39:34] things you know thing you know you hear
[1:39:37] about things you're amazing under how do
[1:39:38] I fix it mode but sometimes that you
[1:39:41] they just want to tell you you know and
[1:39:43] the problem is we we you know the best
[1:39:48] way to fix things
[1:39:49] thank God come down did God come down
[1:39:52] anoint you God come down and aren't you
[1:39:54] and he'll fix it sure maybe you got to
[1:39:56] say things and whatever more but he's
[1:39:58] the fixer hallelujah glory to God now
[1:40:02] and Jesus answering them saith unto them
[1:40:06] have faith and God fulfill I said to you
[1:40:09] that who service shall say unto this
[1:40:11] mountain be thou removed shall be cast
[1:40:15] into the sea and shalt and thou shalt
[1:40:19] because he and shall not doubt in his
[1:40:20] heart but shall believe that those
[1:40:23] things which he hath said shall come to
[1:40:25] pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:40:29] therefore I say to you what thing what
[1:40:31] thing soever ye desire when you pray
[1:40:33] believe that you receive them and you
[1:40:36] shall have them so saying if you believe
[1:40:39] and pray for this to happen then you
[1:40:42] have to have confidence in your prayer
[1:40:44] you have to have faith in your prayer
[1:40:47] that you have prayed it and it's going
[1:40:49] to happen slowly God you know you know
[1:40:51] brother I said about when God made the
[1:40:53] heavens and the earth he just said let
[1:40:54] there be and and the prophesied he
[1:40:57] believed his own word and it came to
[1:40:59] pass we're made in God's image right we
[1:41:02] have to do the same thing you have to
[1:41:06] have confidence that he has heard your
[1:41:08] prayer and and your prayer will come to
[1:41:10] pass now
[1:41:13] he says this you know and the reason I
[1:41:17] want to say this I'll just say it now
[1:41:19] there's nothing impossible with you
[1:41:21] right many times you say god there's
[1:41:24] nothing impossible with God but he
[1:41:26] accesses there's nothing impossible with
[1:41:28] you whatsoever things you ask it shall
[1:41:31] be all things are possible to them that
[1:41:35] belief do we have believers today all
[1:41:39] things are possible to them that believe
[1:41:40] so God doesn't limit some things are
[1:41:43] possible all things all things you know
[1:41:47] brother Berman right and I'll read the
[1:41:48] quotes but I just want to put it out
[1:41:50] because you're kind of looking at me
[1:41:51] saying where are you going with this so
[1:41:52] I'll just give you the conclusion then
[1:41:54] we'll go through the first and second
[1:41:56] act of this okay brother Ram says that
[1:41:58] man is omnipotent all-powerful man is
[1:42:04] omnipotent that's why Jesus said nothing
[1:42:08] is impossible with all things are
[1:42:10] possible then that belief so there is
[1:42:12] nothing that man cannot do man is
[1:42:15] all-powerful okay now I'm going to read
[1:42:17] this but there were this is this is from
[1:42:22] the Patmos version 1960 but there was
[1:42:25] another young man who came into the
[1:42:27] world one time he died at 33 he
[1:42:29] conquered everything that could be
[1:42:30] conquered when he was on earth he
[1:42:31] conquered passions pride he conquered
[1:42:33] sickness he conquered devils when he
[1:42:35] died he conquered death when he arose he
[1:42:37] conquered hell he went up and conquered
[1:42:39] everything that was against mankind and
[1:42:42] winnowed the winepress of God and
[1:42:43] crushed it down and conquered death how
[1:42:45] grave sickness formalities everything
[1:42:48] else and overcame at all and rose on the
[1:42:50] third day and conquered all the
[1:42:51] atmospheres above and cut that mess
[1:42:53] between God and man and connected heaven
[1:42:55] and earth together glory oh my there he
[1:42:58] stands the mighty Conqueror since he
[1:43:00] rent the Velen - there he is he has the
[1:43:02] keys of both death and hell hang on on
[1:43:05] my side fear not laid his right hand his
[1:43:08] power upon him and raised him up by the
[1:43:10] power of his right hand said fear not I
[1:43:12] am he that was that is which is to come
[1:43:14] I'm the first and the last he that lived
[1:43:17] and died and is alive again forevermore
[1:43:19] amen oh lo behold the mighty Conqueror
[1:43:22] lo behold him in plain view there he
[1:43:24] stands the mighty Conqueror since he
[1:43:26] rent the
[1:43:27] falen - amen cut every obstacle from
[1:43:29] human beings that they might be
[1:43:31] connected like in the Garden of Eden now
[1:43:33] man I was going to choke it but I'm
[1:43:35] going to say it man is omnipotent you
[1:43:38] don't believe that but he is a man fully
[1:43:41] surrendered to God is omnipotent right
[1:43:44] did he not say in Mark 11 whatsoever
[1:43:46] things you say and don't doubt in your
[1:43:48] heart it will come to pass
[1:43:50] you have what you've said what happens
[1:43:53] when to omnipotence meet this is the
[1:43:55] same quote when God and man comes
[1:43:57] together to omnipotence something's got
[1:44:01] to shake whatsoever you'd say with that
[1:44:03] creative power of omnipotence of God
[1:44:06] knowing that he's promised it and he
[1:44:08] said it in his word it creates a power
[1:44:10] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:44:13] to pass things that is not it makes it
[1:44:15] seem as though they are because to
[1:44:18] omnipotence have met there he stands oh
[1:44:20] isn't he wonderful she says when when
[1:44:23] man is fully surrendered to God he
[1:44:25] becomes omnipotent all-powerful so in to
[1:44:27] omnipotence meet something's got to
[1:44:30] shake so in God and man become one
[1:44:33] something's got to shake something's got
[1:44:34] to happen hallelujah he says this and he
[1:44:38] says this in the uncertain sound he says
[1:44:42] now first I'm just I'm I want to raise
[1:44:45] your faith I want to raise your faith
[1:44:48] you've got to realize who you are what
[1:44:50] you have in your position there same
[1:44:52] creative power that said let there be
[1:44:54] Sun Moon and stars that same God comes
[1:44:56] and dwells in you right and that same
[1:44:58] God wants to speak that creative power
[1:45:00] out of your lips that that he will take
[1:45:02] control of the situation there what you
[1:45:04] have need of will become material I'm
[1:45:06] not talking about money and prosperity
[1:45:09] I'm talking about God manifesting his
[1:45:10] word in your life that's the important
[1:45:13] thing
[1:45:13] I mean your brother Marie spoke Scrolls
[1:45:15] into existence spoke a storm out of
[1:45:17] existence that tumor the size of a
[1:45:19] grapefruit was spoken around existence
[1:45:21] out of his wife's side life was given
[1:45:23] back to a fish all those things happen
[1:45:25] now I don't need squirrels right
[1:45:29] I don't need squirrels I don't need a
[1:45:31] Bluth to be spoken out of existence a
[1:45:32] storm I don't need those things but we
[1:45:35] need redemption right we need healing
[1:45:38] we need deliverance I mean we need the
[1:45:40] power of

[1:45:42] before and then we need to write another
[1:45:45] book of Acts the reality of God to be in
[1:45:47] the presence of the burning bush again

[1:48:04] wife never seen tongues and prophecy and
[1:48:05] things before God came down she knew was
[1:48:09] real holy and it happened her I never
[1:48:12] meet someone you know I just had the
[1:48:14] message in my Bible you know I was going
[1:48:16] to a Pentecostal church there way more
[1:48:17] formal than you people you people would
[1:48:20] be out of order compared to what they
[1:48:21] were like but you know I never seen
[1:48:25] anyone meet God I never knew what the
[1:48:28] Holy Ghost was him transforming a life
[1:48:31] but I heard it on tape I read it in here
[1:48:34] something in me said why not me this is
[1:48:36] for me I will know my sins are washed
[1:48:39] away I never found some testimony who
[1:48:41] what's it like I just had a burden Oh
[1:48:43] God give me that holy Lord I want your
[1:48:45] Holy Ghost I want you to come and dwell
[1:48:47] in me take over my life do things I
[1:48:50] could never even imagine
[1:48:51] hallelujah why not God here he is
[1:48:54] hallelujah we should not just hold back
[1:48:56] we don't and we have enough you say whoa
[1:48:59] and there's enough testimonies up there
[1:49:01] anyway i am i saw someone put on
[1:49:06] facebook a short clip of jack cole jet
[1:49:10] coat and maybe i'll read it next Sunday
[1:49:13] but he said when he first went to
[1:49:15] brother Browns minute he was preaching
[1:49:16] he was a is a healing evangelists he
[1:49:19] went to brother barons meeting because
[1:49:20] he heard about the sermon things he
[1:49:22] thought it wasn't true and a man came up
[1:49:25] in the prayer line he couldn't get in
[1:49:27] the pillow himself a man came up without
[1:49:29] eyeballs and brother Brahim prayed from
[1:49:33] he said in three days you'll have your
[1:49:34] sight and then Jack Cole somehow brother
[1:49:40] Brown service finishes they're kind of
[1:49:42] standing outside Brown goes past Jack
[1:49:44] Cole Crace room and says we're fighting
[1:49:48] the same devil this is God and something
[1:49:52] just ignited in him and then he thought
[1:49:55] about the man who brother I said you
[1:49:56] have eyes you'll see in three days
[1:49:58] anyway to see him he actually found them
[1:50:01] two days I think it's
[1:50:03] two days he had eyeballs by the third
[1:50:06] day he could see that same God is here
[1:50:11] that same God is here hallelujah you
[1:50:15] should go read the contemporaries
[1:50:16] there's not people never do they never
[1:50:18] go read the contemporaries whether when
[1:50:19] the messenger was here they never go see
[1:50:21] what they said about him even if they
[1:50:23] never agreed with what he taught at the
[1:50:25] end they would say God look Tommy Othman
[1:50:28] said God put on flesh once again in this
[1:50:30] generation
[1:50:31] hallelujah many of them said the same
[1:50:33] kind of thing he's go see what but
[1:50:35] people don't look at those things they
[1:50:37] just see the people throwing stones from
[1:50:39] 50 years ago it's easier to throw stones
[1:50:41] at something that's on a memory for us
[1:50:43] something living that's very different
[1:50:45] hallelujah and that's why I thank God I
[1:50:48] see you people God transformed us going
[1:50:51] through nuda God's trained us we're
[1:50:53] living we are living witness of the
[1:50:55] resurrection I mean brother Han says
[1:50:57] that a living witness to the people who
[1:50:59] once did and said drank prostitution
[1:51:02] whatever in the world have become living
[1:51:03] and they're new creatures in Christ you
[1:51:06] want evidence of this message you see
[1:51:08] look at yourself in the mirror I am a
[1:51:09] living witness living evidence I mean
[1:51:12] that this message is transforming that
[1:51:15] this is the work I mean we haven't
[1:51:16] settled down you see the movements down
[1:51:18] through the ages they always point back
[1:51:20] to their founder well our founder did
[1:51:21] this and God moved in the founders life
[1:51:23] but they created the denomination that
[1:51:25] will then do is point back they don't
[1:51:26] point back and one way we do because
[1:51:30] they will God live there but the same
[1:51:32] God we have testimony I mean we have a
[1:51:36] Living God the same God that was with
[1:51:37] the with the messengers with the bride
[1:51:40] hallelujah and that's why we can say
[1:51:43] it's not just well that happened 50
[1:51:44] years ago it's happening today
[1:51:46] hallelujah and that's the evidence just
[1:51:49] like Timothy you're the next generation
[1:51:50] from Paul in the book of your the
[1:51:52] original Pentecostal I mean the book of
[1:51:56] Acts churchy original they had the same
[1:51:58] file they had the same life
[1:52:00] they weren't just pointing to what the
[1:52:02] what had been on the day of Pentecost
[1:52:04] they had it they weren't even there but

[1:52:55] uncertain about that no see that's when
[1:52:58] two positives meet see that's when two
[1:53:01] omnipotens meet see when one omnipotent
[1:53:04] she had she had perfect omnipotent faith
[1:53:07] in Christ hello hello Martha how are you
[1:53:11] today
[1:53:12] and he and Christ was omnipotent see she
[1:53:15] had perfect infinite faith in Christ
[1:53:17] that he was the Lord and knowed whatever
[1:53:20] he asked God God would give it to him in
[1:53:22] other words she said you just speak the
[1:53:24] word and that's all you have to do
[1:53:26] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:53:28] you that's omnipotent all-powerful cuz
[1:53:31] he just said so see all right he was
[1:53:34] all-powerful and went to Powell's with
[1:53:36] two omnipotent powers meet together it's
[1:53:39] a contact then hallelujah when a lion
[1:53:43] here has got 150 volts and this one's
[1:53:46] got a hundred fifty volts when they come
[1:53:48] together you've got a hundred and fifty
[1:53:50] volts both way see and when you've got
[1:53:53] supreme power when Jesus said lay hands
[1:53:55] on the sick and they shall recover and
[1:53:56] you've got supreme faith in that being
[1:53:59] the truth you need a supreme God to make
[1:54:02] a supreme promise and a supreme result
[1:54:05] will come I mean that's it now watch her
[1:54:07] she comes she said lord if thou would
[1:54:09] have been here my brother would not have
[1:54:11] died but even now whatever you ask God
[1:54:13] God will give it to you he said thy
[1:54:15] brother shall rise again she said truly
[1:54:17] Lord he'll rise in the last last days
[1:54:19] why she had heard that word she know
[1:54:21] that that was a certain sound sure Lord
[1:54:24] he'll raise the last days he was a good
[1:54:25] boy he'll come up in the general
[1:54:27] resurrection of the last days
[1:54:28] Jesus said I am nothing I certain about
[1:54:31] that I am both the resurrection life why
[1:54:34] I am the resurrection and the life
[1:54:37] either believeth in me though he were
[1:54:38] dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth
[1:54:40] and believeth in me he shall never die
[1:54:42] nothing is certain about that believeth
[1:54:44] all this she said yes Lord I believe
[1:54:46] you're exactly what you said you were I
[1:54:48] mean you're the son of God that come
[1:54:50] into the world to save us and I believe
[1:54:52] that's whatever you do or say it's just
[1:54:55] perfect
[1:54:55] there's nothing uncertain about that I
[1:54:57] mean about you at all hallelujah now
[1:55:01] we're gonna jump through this real quick
[1:55:03] jesus said unto him if thou canst
[1:55:05] believe all things are possible to him
[1:55:06] that believeth and straight away the
[1:55:08] father the child cried out with T said
[1:55:10] lord I believe help thou my unbelief and
[1:55:12] the child will still be see that if you
[1:55:14] can believe all things are possible
[1:55:15] how loose there's nothing impossible now
[1:55:19] brother Brahim says in the in the church
[1:55:21] age book this is the Pergamon church age
[1:55:24] he says the evidence of receiving the
[1:55:26] Holy Ghost today is just the same as it
[1:55:28] was back then in the day of our Lord it
[1:55:29] is receiving the word of truth for the
[1:55:31] day in which you live jesus never did
[1:55:33] stress the importance of the works as he
[1:55:35] did the word he knew that if the people
[1:55:37] got the word the works would follow
[1:55:38] that's the Bible we have to work right
[1:55:40] we have the all we've got the word yeah
[1:55:42] now jesus knew that there was going to
[1:55:45] be a terrible drift away from the word
[1:55:46] and the Pergamon age which was as yet
[1:55:49] 200 years from the Patmos vision he knew
[1:55:52] that that drift would cause them to go
[1:55:53] into the dark ages he knew that the way
[1:55:56] man originally got away from God was by
[1:55:58] first leaving the word if you leave that
[1:56:00] word you have left God thus he is
[1:56:03] presenting himself to the church at
[1:56:04] Pergamos and D to all churches of all
[1:56:06] ages I'm the word if you want deity in
[1:56:09] your myths then welcome and receive the
[1:56:11] word don't ever let anyone or anything
[1:56:13] get between you and that word this which
[1:56:16] I'm giving you the word is a revelation
[1:56:18] of myself I am that word remember that
[1:56:20] and then he asked the question I wonder
[1:56:22] if we're sufficiently impressed with the
[1:56:24] word endowments let me give you a
[1:56:26] thought here how do we pray we pray in
[1:56:29] Jesus name don't we every prayer is in
[1:56:31] his name or there isn't any answer you
[1:56:33] know first John 5:14 we're told this is
[1:56:35] the confidence we that we have in him
[1:56:37] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:56:39] will he heareth us
[1:56:41] and if we know that he hears us
[1:56:43] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:56:46] the petitions that we have desired of
[1:56:48] him now we ask what is the will of God
[1:56:50] there's only one way to know his will
[1:56:52] and that is by the Word of God
[1:56:54] lamentations 337 who is he that saith
[1:56:57] and it cometh to pass when the Lord
[1:56:59] Commander that not there it is if it
[1:57:01] isn't in the word you can't have it so
[1:57:03] we can't ask unless it's in the word and
[1:57:05] we can't partition I mean I mean I mean
[1:57:08] I mean petition or ask unless it's in
[1:57:10] his name there it is again Jesus the
[1:57:12] name is the word willed you can't
[1:57:14] separate God in the word they are one
[1:57:16] now this word he is left behind on the
[1:57:18] printed page is part of him when we
[1:57:21] accept it by faith into a spirit-filled
[1:57:23] life he said that that his word was life
[1:57:27] John 6:63 the be part that that is
[1:57:30] exactly what he said in John 14:6 I am
[1:57:33] the way the truth and the life Romans
[1:57:34] 8:9 If any man have not the Spirit of
[1:57:37] Christ he's none of hers there it is he
[1:57:39] is the spirit and he is life that is
[1:57:41] exactly what the word is that is exactly
[1:57:43] what Jesus is he is the word so when a
[1:57:46] spirit born spirit filled man and faith
[1:57:49] takes the word into his heart and place
[1:57:51] it upon his lips why that's the same as
[1:57:53] deity speaking every mountain has to go
[1:57:56] Satan cannot stand before that man right
[1:58:00] so when a spirit boy I know I know I've
[1:58:02] seen this before by practice anchors
[1:58:04] into our souls I mean we're a spirit
[1:58:06] born spirit filled man or woman right
[1:58:10] and faith takes that word into us heart
[1:58:12] and place it upon his lips that's why
[1:58:14] that's the same as deity speaking every
[1:58:17] mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[1:58:20] before that man or before that person
[1:58:23] that's how powerful it is hallelujah and
[1:58:27] we're anointed to speak right it says in
[1:58:30] 2nd Corinthians 4 and 13 we having the
[1:58:32] same spirit of faith according as it is
[1:58:35] written I have believed and therefore I
[1:58:37] have spoken we also believe in therefore
[1:58:40] speak hallelujah so if you have received
[1:58:43] if you have that same spirit of faith
[1:58:45] right we have believed therefore we have
[1:58:48] spoken Amy I'm not doing about preaching
[1:58:51] - about you claiming your mountain right
[1:58:54] you speak
[1:58:55] and faith and prayer what belongs to you
[1:58:58] hallelujah
[1:58:59] you cannot but Speak hallelujah cos is
[1:59:03] therefore I've spoken we also believe
[1:59:05] and therefore speak hallelujah so
[1:59:09] nothing is impossible with you I mean
[1:59:13] nothing is impossible with the bride
[1:59:15] because man is omnipotent and when God
[1:59:19] and man come together to how many
[1:59:20] pundits meet something's got to take
[1:59:22] place hallelujah and that's why it's so
[1:59:24] important when we gather or even at home
[1:59:27] when you gather you have a family altar
[1:59:29] time don't just don't just expect to
[1:59:32] just go through emotion expect God to
[1:59:34] come expect God to meet you expect God
[1:59:36] to anoint your prayer and knowing what
[1:59:38] you're reading and knowing why you're
[1:59:39] talking about then he'll come down to
[1:59:41] the family hallelujah that's what we
[1:59:43] should have expectation for I mean we
[1:59:46] should have expectation for the
[1:59:47] supernatural hallelujah amen Oh God but
[1:59:55] more he sees this he says that he sees
[2:00:05] in the church age book of the revelation
[2:00:06] of Jesus Christ he says let me show you
[2:00:10] another reason why Satan hates this book
[2:00:12] of revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[2:00:13] church he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[2:00:15] same yesterday today and forever and he
[2:00:16] changes not he knows a whole lot more
[2:00:19] than do 90% of the theologians knows it
[2:00:21] since God is immutable in his nature
[2:00:23] then he's just as immutable in his ways
[2:00:26] the Satan knows it surely that the
[2:00:28] original church at Pentecost with the
[2:00:30] power of God mark 16 in action is the
[2:00:32] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[2:00:35] all houses false it has to be but now
[2:00:37] remember us Christ and the true church
[2:00:39] is a continuation of the book of X but
[2:00:43] the book of Revelation shows how the
[2:00:45] Antichrist spirit will come into the
[2:00:46] church and defile it make it lukewarm
[2:00:48] formal and powerless that exposes Satan
[2:00:51] revealing his works which is the
[2:00:53] attempted destruction of God's people
[2:00:54] and the discrediting of God's Word
[2:00:56] that's why people come against the
[2:00:58] message because Satan trying to
[2:00:59] discredit God's Word right right down to
[2:01:02] the time when he's cars in the lake of
[2:01:03] fire
[2:01:03] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[2:01:06] knows that if the people get the true
[2:01:07] revelation
[2:01:09] the true church and what she is and what
[2:01:11] she stands for that she can do the
[2:01:13] greater works I mean that if they get
[2:01:15] the revelation of the true church and
[2:01:16] what she is what is she she's the Word
[2:01:18] made flesh I mean she is the female part
[2:01:21] of Jesus Christ she's the Word made
[2:01:22] flesh and what does she stand for God
[2:01:25] living upon the earth hallelujah we
[2:01:28] don't need to put up with Satan and his
[2:01:29] and his devices right we're a free
[2:01:32] people
[2:01:32] hallelujah and what she stands for that
[2:01:35] she can do the greater works she will be
[2:01:37] an invincible army if they can get a
[2:01:40] true revelation of the two spirits
[2:01:42] within the framework of the Christian
[2:01:43] Church and by God's Spirit discern and
[2:01:46] withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan
[2:01:49] will be powerless before her he will be
[2:01:51] definitely thought definitely throated
[2:01:53] today as when Christ was stood as every
[2:01:55] effort to gain power of him in the
[2:01:57] desert yes Satan hates revelation but we
[2:01:59] love it with true revelation in our
[2:02:02] lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[2:02:03] against us but we will prevail over them
[2:02:07] hallelujah amen friends it's not sit
[2:02:13] back amen
[2:02:16] how God is here we're here too that he
[2:02:20] would live we should believe for the
[2:02:23] impossible right we should believe for
[2:02:26] the impossible I mean we're not you know
[2:02:28] we shouldn't just believe for well some
[2:02:29] things we should believe for the
[2:02:30] impossible how can it be done I don't
[2:02:33] know but it's going to be done
[2:02:34] hallelujah all things are possible to
[2:02:36] them that belief hallelujah amen we have
[2:02:42] the musicians place
