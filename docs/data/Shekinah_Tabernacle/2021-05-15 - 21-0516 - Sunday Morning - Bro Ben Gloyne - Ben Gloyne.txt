we bring it we could we could pray the whole week but when we get here and you really have a need we can lay before the lord and we all can pray together as saints and if one prayer can change the heart of god how many more if we all get together and we pray as a family together so um we've got sister deborah walker um she's got breast cancer on both her breasts and we want to come and stand against it in the name of our lord jesus christ if you have a need this is where you bring it before the lord and this is where we pray and we say lord just come now and and take this battle because the doctor he can only do what he do but god brings the healing he brings the supernatural he brings that element where when we get to our end he takes over so let us just bow our heads and if emily has a prayer request just lift up your hands to the lord and ask him to just come in and help where it's needed our gracious heavenly father lord we know that when we pray father your ear is open to every word that we say lord lord we know that when we pray we don't just pray into some ceiling or some far-off dimension father but lord you said we two or more gather in my name there i am in the

not more to ask the sovereign god lord to just come in and and lord stand in the gap lord between our our human flesh lord and our faith father lord we ask that you would go to our lord jesus lord that you would go to sister deborah lord and minister unto her and lord we know you don't put anything on someone lord if it doesn't achieve something for your kingdom so lord may you speak with

know why i just had a thought anybody near has a testimony they want to share don't want to put you on the spot sister belinda god bless you i feel like when the lord tells you to do something you don't do it you get in trouble yeah that was on my way this morning i thought lord if someone asks i think it was a few weeks back at one of those meetings we have on a saturday night and brother cuban was there as well and it was just a prayer meetings and you know sometimes you can just think okay lord are we doing the right thing and all this there's all these thoughts happening anyway but he always comes on the scene so one of the prayers was um oh someone says has anyone else got a prayer request and i just hit on my heart i just thought lord i would really need a job and then i thought nice too trivial to ask you know like more i'm more likely to ask maybe if they need someone healing or something i just had it on my heart anyway and then i didn't speak out that prayer request but it was right at the end and then by the cuban prayed that final prayer and he said lord hear also the unspoken prayer requests and my hand just went up like that and and then um and then sister baba came in late on that day on that saturday and so we just spoke to her afterwards i said how was your day you see that i was extra busy why are the receptionists couldn't be there and so she just expressed these things and i said well i can't do that and she said are you serious yes so basically straight after the meeting the lord made a way answered that request and so it took a little while before i actually got to meet the boss and things but on the same night on that saturday night sister barbara was messaging me i sent her my cv she sent it to her boss and i'm starting on the 25th and praise the lord so thank you for the prayers and thank you for the prayers and i know says the baba only said to me yesterday there was a lot of people applying for that job which i didn't know because when i got there for the interview the the boss lady that interviewed me didn't actually express that part um so there was obviously that that is just the lord you know so we just give him the thanks and praises and uh i think my husband also has a testimony it has he has one now it has to do with um with food the lord supplies us with food the lord supplies us with firewood and all these things that we need in a time when we don't have the availabilities to get these things easily but it's his testimony of how that came about god bless you all husbands i put on the spot by the way yeah things have been going well at the um outreach it's been a real wonderful time it's just a triple effect because when you drop the stone in the bucket it's a ripple effect that goes out and it's only those ones and twos that are coming in praise the lord every saturday there's been just an extra one coming in amen and the testimony about food is that when we did the barbecue out side uh the butcher shop the butcher shop actually gave us a lot of veggies from living we know levin is a place of veggies and so we have to give it out to the community and at the same time on the way home there's about three or four cows on the main road everyone's driving around the cows there's poor little ladies trying to get the cows into the driveway so i stop in the middle of the road typical lights on doors wide open no one can get past you and then i have to hood the cows in and then about a week later which was the other day we were talking about firewood talking about food and the farmer rang me up and asked me to come over and he gave us all this firewood heaps and heaps of firewood for free and also the wife came out which i then recognized and she gave us a huge leg of pork so that was good to go towards all the food or the soups that we make out there and yeah it's just a triple effect you know we're the bride we get blessings and i'd like to thank you all for your prayers and just looking forward to a sign we have to get a sign being made up saying the supper room it is still the supper room and i'm just blessed that the church is behind it right financially supplying us with food i'd just like to thank brother ben and also especially brother andy for his input as well he's a sign maker and last night one of the brothers came and most of you had been to to the birthday party i had had met this guy tainui well he came along last night and he fell in love with sister barbara and brother honest right and he called him family it's the first time he comes from a dysfunctional family so it's the first time he felt that this is actually whanau this is actually family and he plays the chauffeur the horns the rams horns and all this and he's designed to

serve an exciting god amen one that when we think we think this way and he thinks this way brothers god bless you amen my testimony is a song so i don't have much to say whoever wrote this song said

chapter 7. and we're going to read from verse 28. i'm going to go down to verse 39 for i say unto you among those that are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john but the pharisees and and lawyers rejected rejected the council of god against themselves being not baptized of him and the lord said where unto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you you say he hath the devil the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say behold a gluttonous man and a wine bibber and a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified to all her children and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and had wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed her his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman is this that toucheth him for he is sorry for she is a sinner amen let's just pray this morning if you ever need you want to raise your hand to the lord amen as we go to the lord and pray together gracious heavenly father thank you lord that is such a what a joy it is to surrender all to you lord thank you we can place our lives in your hands dear god that lord that no matter what happens in life lord we know it lord it's it's under your control father if our lives are completely surrendered into your hands lord we know that you will lead us lord and i want to pray for the service this morning lord just ask dear god may you come anoint not just speaker but here also lord i pray we'll get into the into the rhythm of the word and may just come and speak to our hearts lord speak to my heart as well dear god we just want to come into your presence this morning with thanksgiving in our hearts what you've done for us and just want to worship you in spirit and truth and give thanks and praise unto your great name for what you've done and we ask that you'd be magnified in our midst this morning lifted up and praised and placed in the highest place lord may you grant it for your glory we lord you see all the hands that have been raised lord jesus you know the needs and the desires and the questions and the burdens lord that are behind that raised hand so father i pray you'd meet those knees today for your glory lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands we thank you lord for this opportunity to be gathered together we always lord want to remember those who couldn't make it today be their portion be their strength lord may your presence fall upon them lord may minister there to their hearts also grant it please in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning i want to speak about being identified in bible characters now it's you know we were we were talking christie and i were talking about this the other day and it really kind of got me going you know in a good way you know it's very easy you know for people to to say yes i would have been with joshua and caleb or i would have been with you know noah and the ark or the disciples or you know it's very easy to you know but it's our attitude towards the word which really dictates what kind of character we are now you know it's it it all boils down to that it's our attitude towards the lord jesus that you know that that that dictates what kind of character we would be webster would give the definition of attitude one of the definitions is a position assumed for a specific purpose so an attitude is a position assumed for a specific purpose that's what an attitude really is you know you can you can have a threatening attitude and what is the what is that position assumed for to threaten someone right because so it's an assumed position for a specific purpose now so it's our attitude we come with an assumed position when we come to church some of us come now let's just be honest right some of us come and say lord i want you to speak to me i want you to change my life make me more like you take the take the weaknesses out of my life mold my character take sin out of my life mold me minister to my heart change me you know that's a specific attitude or a specific position that that someone assumes when they come to the house of god irrespective of the trouble they have in their life the trials the strife whatever's going on you know but but people have a have have that kind of position assumed and the purpose is if we have that kind of attitude towards the lord then he can minister and change our lives amen but then some people come with an assumed position if it's boring when's he going to quit i've heard that before you know what's for lunch you know what am i going to do monday i've got to do this for tuesday this wednesday and they think about that whole week and you know that's an assumed position and unfortunately the specific purpose of that and even unwillingly is you can miss your blessing so we don't want to come with that kind of position the devil wants us to sit in that position he wants us to worry about tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself and then tuesday we'll roll on on wednesday and you know so it'll take care of itself we don't need to get too worried about tomorrow tomorrow god's got tomorrow hallelujah amen so we can just rest in that so we ask the question now what is our specific purpose in in coming to church today have you have you come with an assumed position oh my you know i i trust our assumed position as lord transformed my life give me a moment in your presence that i'm never the same oh that's what we want so you know i was i was driving you know sometimes i i i dropped the girls off at school and we're driving up carlson hill and you know we all pray around and when i was praying the thought came into my heart this may be the last prayer you ever pray in your life it really made me a lot more sincere you know you know because you think about it because sometimes we just go through the motions and but then that thought just flashed across my mind what if this is the last prayer you ever pray in your life it makes you a lot more sincere you know and because the reality of it is there will come a day when i do pray my last prayer and then i'm done right you know so we've got to have the attitude what we need so we're just gonna we'll just see how this goes today but yeah i trust we can really just enter in because this is more than all the gospels some people just take the gospels oh that's just a story it's more than a story because how people reacted to the son of man then is the same way they react to him now because he's the same god and so we'll find ourselves in a in a character in the scripture now the reason we started you know it's amazing how the how the scriptures arranged we were talking about this brother and paul and brother andy out here remember on friday the arrangement of scripture because how how how the gospels are arranged as a specific reason it's arranged in a certain way that this story is given now and this and then and you know and so it's amazing where jesus was likening that generation to a to a group of children sitting in the marketplace and one group is playing to the other or mourning to the other and and and they're not receiving it in the same spirit it's given him so they're sitting back like this and he's saying that there's one group of children he says we're piped here and you have not danced you know we mourn mourn to you and you have not wept so you're saying this is how the generation is that you have not responded in the same spirit that it's given in right because because that's why i'm saying that the that you know what happens with people is they don't receive the word and the same spirit that it's given and because the spirit of the word is given is is a spirit of mercy it's a spirit of deliverance a spirit of healing it's eternal life it's deliverance salvation you know it's it's for the devil to be cast out that's that's the spirit that the word has given him but he's saying that the other group are not responding in the same spirit because you think if someone starts playing music to dance now i didn't realize i was a musician until i read this last night because there's a there's a song coming forth there's a song coming forth i mean when someone stands up there and preaches the word you hear your pastor preach or whoever preaching there's a song being played there's some sheet music that's being played and and god's desire is that the same inspiration that comes upon the minister falls upon you and your life begins to dance and dance amen that's the same as the word hallelujah amen because we know that this message is sent to produce a body change this is a message of rapturing faith amen it's not a reformation it's a transformation message to changes from this you know mortal to be that will put on immortality that will be built in the image of christ that's why this message came i mean so now if that is if that is it now so i'm now singing a song or every sermon i say preach you know what i'm singing i'm walking right up into a body change i feel it coming on and it might be today that's every service you'll ever sit in in this church i'm singing that song to you you've got to come under the inspiration of them of this of the song hallelujah and start dancing to that beat hallelujah now brother abraham says in the mighty god available for us he says now the only way he says no we can't live in the light of luther he is a reformer we appreciate his part but we played that out we're way over here at the back of the book now we can't play it out like that so we can't play it out like what the lutherans did now the only way we're ever going to be able to do it my brethren is this and the and brethren of the world of different parts of the world i might say there's only one way for that director to do he has to get in the same spirit that the composer is in then he's got it so it's like an orchestra someone writes some music and then that music's given to the you know given to the director and then he directs all the musicians to play that music the only way that the director can play or get the um get the musicians to play that is if he's in the same spirit as a composer he must be in the same spirit of the composer then he's got it and when the church the symphony itself where the world is at watching for these signs and wonders when the church and the composer and the director all get in the spirit of the composer that means we've got to get into the spirit of the lord jesus christ he's the great composer we've got sheet music here hallelujah you say well i don't have a very big part no god wants all of his musicians to be playing you know you know sometimes in orchestras we watch the lead violin or the lead something but you know everyone has a role maybe you can just be the man who just plays the triangle you know he goes to every practice you know he dresses the part he gets prepared and he's standing there watching the music maybe he only makes one ting in the whole thing and maybe many in the audience would have missed it but if the composer's sitting there and the man doesn't think at the right time he says there's something wrong here because to the composer that thing is important because he put it there for a purpose we may be the triangle player in the band but hey it's important to god i mean we've got part of the word to play out harley every part of the symphony is important hallelujah hey if i'm a triangle player praise the lord i'm going to play that triangle one shot 10 hallelujah you know they stand there how they do and they just you do this they still if i've got to stand there the whole time for the last movement of the music wouldn't just go ting hallelujah hey there's going to be a ting one day and the body's going to be changed maybe that's the part we've got to play harley we're going to be standing ready lord okay when's it going and you're watching the composer and you're watching he begins to nod and do all the indenting and then what does he do he puts his triangle away he goes home gets changed but he's done his job that's what we want to do amen and when they say the day of miracles has passed it didn't hit the right note but when it gets in the right swing of it the right spirit of it how how are you going to do it until the spirit comes down of the composer amen then you say the day of miracles never pass the symphony cries out amen when we hit jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the symphony cries out amen what's the symphony that's your life crying out amen you shall receive power after this holy ghost has come upon you the symphony cries out amen i got it there's no more guesswork about it then the whole symphony is right in harmony with the word it's going that's it oh it's a magnificent thing the director and the composer must be in the same spirit and so must the musicians be in the same spirit to act it all out the world is wondering what's going on now it's interesting how jesus would say that this would be like children in a marketplace a marketplace in the scriptures the town square it's a public part of the um place you know there's a lot of things going on there people are selling people are buying you know we know that you know new zealand we're not very big on people trying to get in your face and sell your things but other parts of the world they uh yo that's normal you know your brother antipa knows about that from israel you know they try and get in your face and sell these things and do this and you know people don't really change a lot so no doubt back in jesus day it was the same kind of thing they had their bread they had their food they were selling whatever they'd be on the you know they're trying to get everyone's attention and there's a lot of hustle and bustle going on and you know and there's here's these children there now so it's in a public place and one group starts playing so they had so you think about it the reason people play a song is because they've got it on their heart and they start playing the music they start piping so there's a song on their heart and they want the others to join in this is what god wants he wants us to join in with the music he wants us to dance along amen but then you see but the other children aren't responding now now why would people not respond in a public place because of the pressure of the place because of the atmosphere of the place now i'm going to go into atmosphere it's not some vague thing it's not like seeing some clouds up in the sky oh that's the atmosphere you know no no that's not about the atmosphere of an age but we'll get to that later but you know here here they are you know the children are dancing or playing and they want the other group to dance they're calling to them why don't you join in with us but you know there's a there's a pressure that comes on for people to conform to what's going on around them so in a marketplace you know you know if you go to the riverside market here you want to keep your children close don't let them wander off too much you know because you've got to go here and buy this and get this here and get this here and get lunch here and you know you don't want them just wandering off you know there's a certain atmosphere in the market but these children playing you know they want to change the atmosphere and god wants us to change he wants our atmosphere to be changed he wants the anointing upon us not to be the anointing of the age but to the anointing of his word upon us and then so there they are they're playing but the others aren't responding and maybe they had in their minds well you know this is not a place for dancing or for weeping you know what if daddy sees me what if what if so and so sees me what if this one tells me off you know there's a pressure comes on and they don't respond to the piping you know it's not a convenient time not a convenient place i'll respond at another time another place that's the wrong attitude when god starts piping we should start dancing hallelujah amen and yes the same thing he says yo yo they said we have mourned if i can find it here he says we have mourned to you and you have not whipped if someone's weeping or rejoicing they want to convey an emotion to someone hallelujah now now the gospel doesn't make us well we may weep over our sins but we don't stay weeping you know but when someone preaches i trust that you know the love i have of the lord jesus in my heart you want to convey that to your audience the people around us that we talk to on the street you know my houses are if people would only fall in love with him that's what we want done we want we want people to fall in love with the word fall in love with jesus christ you know we just convey the emotion you say well well the gospel is not about emotion but brother brahm said very clearly anything without emotion is dead you bury it so you know this is a heartfelt religion we're not led by our feelings but love is a feeling hallelujah it's a manifest hallelujah you know so you know you can't say you love someone but not feel it that's just an intellectual conception of love it's got and you say you love the lord jesus there should be a feeling there however we know we are sure our walk is based on the word or not our feelings our feelings and beat us around but there should be love there should be a feeling of love so he's saying that these children say you're not entering into the same emotion we have because of the condition of the marketplace they were afraid to step out of the status quo and dance or weep what if daddy sees me weeping here i'll get in trouble you know these pressures and things going on so people are atmosphere generators everyone here is creating an atmosphere it's not some vague thing you know it's like people talk about economics oh it's just market forces at work hold on it's not some vague thing there's actually things at work but people use it as an excuse i'll just market forces in the market yeah well who dictates the market this is not a vague thing it's like oh an atmosphere it's not a vague thing it's a very concrete thing and so people are atmosphere generators now it's what we the things that we think on the things that we do our actions the things we talk about it creates an atmosphere motherboard says it is your life is worthy of the gospel he says well we've seen those that every time you shun them all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody and say oh my here they come they're going to criticize somebody here here he he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to be around them people like that why because they're creating an atmosphere see they create seemingly nice pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and as i said the atmosphere is the things we think on the things you do our actions the things we talk about it creates an atmosphere right you know i i debuted as a netball coach yesterday literally here at annelise's netball coach now what kind of atmosphere would i have created if i tell those girls they're not going to win what's the point of trying you know and especially even kids i don't know well it doesn't matter for my own or other kids what if i tell them girls let's face it you're going to lose you can't catch it to save yourself you know that would create an atmosphere it would create an atmosphere of unbelief that they couldn't win right but i told them girls you're going to win that's a real good pass that you're you're doing well that's a good shot you're doing good keep it up you know and it creates an atmosphere hey we can do this hallelujah so you know our words have power our actions have power what we think about has power you say well i'm just in my own little nothing box in my head no no that nothing box spreads out around us hallelujah that's for the brothers by the way apparently sisters don't have nothing boxes but you know yeah but but it actually it actually has ramifications of of of the people around us i just wanted people say i just want to live in my own little world now that'll have ramifications because you're withdrawing and that will hurt someone around you man is not made to withdraw within himself or within herself so jesus saying that that generation was like that and history repeats itself this that same son of man has been revealed in this day amen through the prophet messenger so many times the reason that people do not respond today the way they really should if they are in their right mind is because of the influence of an atmosphere amen now we must go beyond that now i'm just saying all this is a background to simon's house because there's a there's a reason why the scripture's arranged this way jesus didn't just tell this com you know tell how that how the generation is now he's going to show why that generation's that way and it's going to be lived out we're going to be real careful we're not we're not we're not reading off the wrong script you know no doubt if simon could have redone his lines again he wouldn't have done those lines he would have been the woman washing his feet you know we're going to be real careful what kind of life that we're projecting now simon simon was a pharisee we know he was a very rich man brother brown tells us that that this was an annual feast that he would he would host and he would you know call all the great dignitaries and try and show off his wealth and you know but there's a whole agenda that he had behind it you know you see the way he treated the lord really reflects to us the kind of man he was because he had a purpose in inviting jesus and that was not to give him the best place at the feast that was to make fun of him ridicule him he says basically i'm just going to put a whole damper on this thing and i'm going to show you really what kind of stuff this man is made out of and so he had a so so no doubt he would have maybe you know if he treated jesus a guest this way how do you think he would have treated his servants you know maybe they put a foot wrong he would have ridiculed them publicly made them feel embarrassed you know run them down this is the kind of man he was he wasn't a sweet humble nice kind of a boss you know some people it's amazing what kind of conditions people live in and i'll just talk about work life we'll just you know it's amazing the the the stuff people put up with just for a dollar you know because i doubt this is my opinion i doubt the foot wash flunky loved his job you know how's your job satisfaction this year 10 out of 10. i love washing feet i love washing the grime and the stench and the manure and the dust and you know i love i just enjoy it i doubt very much he had that kind of mindset you know he saw one maybe maybe he would grimace when he see people come to the door you know but he had in his mind you know but at least i'm getting paid something at least i'm earning a wage and sure you know not all jobs you know if work was always fun it wouldn't be called work it'd be cool fun you know and it moulds our character a certain way if we persevere so i'm not you know but the foot wash flank flankie came under the influence of simon and he had to you know put up with probably a lot of abuse but because of his because well he reasoned with it himself or at least i'm earning something you know sure i'm at the bottom of the ladder but hey a promotion is going to come someday you know maybe i won't just be the foot wash flank you all the time maybe i'll be cleaning the dishes or i'm not doing some marking out the stables whatever a promotion would be in that kind of you know and so he had this in his mind and the other servants would have been much the same way see people are attracted to riches and it's not always for a good intention many times it's actually a selfish motive people attracted to certain people you know so here he is no doubt most of his servants didn't really like simon but there's prestige in working for an up and up in society right people say you know they work for a certain company i work for so-and-so and they think they've made it somehow but you know it doesn't really mean too much at the end of the day but you know so they were thinking no doubt he was singing well at least i'll work for this guy and you know he's well known and you know but the atmosphere you know how he would have how he would have been treated no doubt it would have become quite hollow that he was working for simon maybe at first it would have been exciting i don't know i'm just let's just step into a story because there's a lot of reasoning goes on you know many times we read the scriptures and we just kind of this person did this and this person did this we just think it's just a scripted play that there's no emotion there's no reasoning there's no you know but there's a lot of things going on but the challenge is can these people step out and actually give the lord the right kind of worship he deserves you know so so here's the footwash flunky he has this kind of way and then you know there's a lot of you know other attendants there that you know that are there in simon's house there's bakers there's cooks there's maids there's cleaners you know there's security there's all kind of different people and there's also there's also the ones who go personally to give the invitations now this was a very fancy kind of job because you get to go talk to people face to face you know you're not just washing feet you know you're not just just in the kitchen you're not just cleaning afterwards you know you get to you know you're a diplomat now i'm just a lower scale so now this is a bit of you know you can really sell yourself you know you know what i mean you can make a name for yourself how you how you how you give the announcement and how you give the invitation and you know you can brush up on your oratory skills and you know you can and then so people can get so caught up in these things and they they can get so focused on their task at hand we can misread the big picture you know simon the pharisee because this was a was a was a a calendar day you know in his you know you know very important part in his in his calendar he would have overseen the whole arrangement of this feast yes right so he didn't just say what's for dinner tonight i invited some people over and you know no no he would have had the guest list he would have gone through it all because he wanted to impress certain people and a lot of those people probably came to the feast but didn't even like him but they came because they were invited and his name was well known we all following me yeah so you know a lot of these people would have come and they would have not necessarily liked him but they came but you know he would have gone over the guest list and then he would have talked to his talk to his servants about this is how i want the people welcomed and he would have gone through now when their carriages come you servants you take the horses and things put them in the stables make sure they're fed and now you and the guest list you stand here you know and when they come you know they'll give you you ask their name and they'll give the name then you'll announce who's coming through the door and then the footwash flunky you're here with the towels and the bowl you make sure that's ready you're ready and then the person who anoints and kisses mike welcome this is the procession of them coming into the feast but he would have said now now this is the guest listen know that he would have read it out and he says now everyone's going to get this kind of treatment but one jesus of nazareth has been invited foot wash flunky you don't wash his feet don't anoint him you don't make him welcome you and and the person will no doubt they would have been ushered to a certain seat make him sit in the corner this would have all been arranged it wasn't an accident simon didn't just look up in the face and say hey this is wrong it was all orchestrated because there's way that people can come to church and we can put jesus in the corner and make him unwelcome but we can just be stuck in a certain mode of things and you know we don't want to be that kind of people remember what bible character are we today now so so he sends out his his his his couriers that have got everyone's invitation and now here's the one who's given the task you have to give this to jesus of nazareth and because he wants to impress his boss he makes his journey and you know he's got a journey you know a couple of days he's on foot that's a long way to go he doesn't just get in his car and go he's got to walk and he's going to find out where jesus is because jesus is always moving around he's having a meeting here healing people here going here you know but eventually he came to where the crowd now wherever jesus there's always a crowd you know and maybe maybe he walked over the last hill and he heard the hum of the noise of the people and he sees a group of people gathered up on a hill and he says there he is and no doubt there would have been a bit of relief in his heart i finally found him sweat running down his down his brow heat of the day you know he's tired maybe a bit dehydrated but you know he begins to walk through the crowd up to where jesus is now no doubt as he's walking through he would have heard testimonies of what just happened that morning hallelujah someone who has crippled is now walking carrying crutches the lord took me off these this morning and they would have testified he would have heard the hum of the meeting afterwards you know isn't it wonderful we can sit down after a good meeting and talk about what god just did and what ministered to our hearts and what he did for us and you know that hum would have been going on but he's so caught up in what he has to do he's really missing his moment because remember he has an audience with jesus he's not just going to talk to anyone and now he's coming under an atmosphere of faith amen but because he's so caught up in what he's doing he's missing it may we never be numb to an atmosphere of faith and so he comes up and you know jesus had his inner circle and you know he had the other disciples and there was layers of security around him because he's tired and he's busy and you know and he maybe comes to philip or one of the other disciples he said you know and he announces who he is and this is why i've come and try and look all important and here i am and you know he says yeah i've got to see jesus and philip's like well he's busy and he's tired and you know he goes to talk to some of the other disciples and this guy is really insistent i've got to see him i've got a schedule to keep you know we can get so caught up in schedules and then so finally he's led in and then finally he steps into the presence of more than a man he looked like everyone else jesus wasn't dressed up any different kind of way he looked like a common man but when he looked into those eyes he was looking to the eyes of eternal life and he and he had an audience a one-on-one audience you know many people would have wanted that wouldn't you want that wouldn't that would have been wonderful not just to be at the back of the back it would have been amazing to see him from the edge of the crowd it would have been amazing to be in the middle of the crowd or be close but to get a one-on-one audience because you don't know how much longer he's going to be on the earth for here's an opportunity where all the prophets and the wise men all the believers through the ages have been looking for this moment and you're living in the moment and he finally gets into the prince of jesus he says jesus i am the courier of simon the pharisee and i have come to invite you to his feast it's going to be an excellent feast so and so it's going to be you know he paints a real good picture you know you paint a good picture if you want people to come and jesus looks at him and no doubt in the back of his mind he's thinking what this is such a sad thing going on he jesus knew who he was he says i've come i'm the lamb of god take away the sin of the world he knew he was emanuel so when he knew he was god he wasn't making himself something he wasn't he was the fountain of eternal life he was the one who could have given this man what he really needed and he would have thought in the back of his mind what a shame and and and and the courier is saying this to him and no doubt the disciples are kind of gathering around listening to what's going on and they're probably thinking simon the pharisee he's not good enough he's not going to accept this what a waste of time you know but then jesus because he always comes where he's invited he always comes where he's invited he'll say sure i'll come such and such a date yeah i'll be there yeah sure thing tell your master i'll be there and then then the courier now he lets out a sigh of relief or maybe something in his heart a joy because remember the whole reason that jesus he's going to be the entertainment it's going to be a different feast this year he's going to be the entertainment he's got an important job to invite jesus and now he's just heard he'll come no doubt satisfaction rose up in his heart yes i'm going to get promoted maybe i'll get a bonus maybe i'll get something from simon and he turns around feeling satisfied and he walks back down the hill and no doubt jesus would have looked at him as he walked down and thought what a pity he had an opportunity to talk to me and that's what he said he relayed what someone else said as opposed to really what should have been on his heart what would have we done when we went there wouldn't you get down at his feet say lord be merciful to me a sinner lord change my life you're the founder we know you're christ hallelujah remember what jesus did was not done in a corner paul would say to king agrippa these things weren't done in a corner speaking of the death burial resurrection of jesus christ and everything he did and that was about 20 i have it here somewhere about 20 odd years after the fact so even king agrippa knew what happened they knew they knew jesus had a name they had heard stories and rumors about what he did sure they heard a lot of bad things about him but they did here blind bartimaeus he's no longer called blind bartimaeus legion no he's no longer legion where is he went back to his family healthy well than normal hallelujah yeah dries his daughter yeah she's well remember he was he was a religious man as well are the lepers yeah no longer lepers hallelujah you know hey that storm that blew up on the sea of galilee the other night that was wild and it just stopped what happened i heard jesus was going across yeah they would have heard those kind of things but yet because he was so caught up under simon's leadership he thought he had done his job and he walked away it was 29 years after the death burial resurrection of jesus that the apostle paul said to king agrippa i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner it hadn't gone away even even even that long afterwards now so here comes jesus no wait the courier runs back down he's got a spring in his step he goes to simon simon oh great simon pharisee master i've done my errand and here i am and in good time and you know and jesus said he'll come and simon's saying excellent the entertainment's coming this is going to be a special time and then now jesus makes his way with his disciples slowly or however they walked and they got there on the evening of the feast others other guests are arriving before he arrives no doubt they come in their fancy chariots or on their mules or whatever their horses and there's a lot of pomp and ceremony because here comes the great chief rabbi of so and so and this is a great pharisee of this bible school and you know because they're trying to impress one another and the trumpets tooed and all the things go on and you know here come here come the guests and just as just as um simon told his servants this is how you're gonna do it and it was all and it was just carried out perfectly because all of the servants are trying to get something out of simon they want to be noticed that they're better than the others yet they don't really like him but they want something from him but then finally a ragtag if i can say a ragtag mob of common looking peasants walks down the street here comes jesus he doesn't come in some great big trumpet blast and a great big pomp and fanfare and ceremony here comes a meek humble way and then he be he comes forward and then normally the ones with the guest list that see some fancy guy with a big hat and stuff coming they say oh sir great sir what is your name it's so nice to see you here you know it's i'm pharisee jones from hebron pharisee jones oh yes pharisee joseph here please come this way sir it's so nice to have you here and you know and there'll be a lot of flattery and all that stuff going on but then but then they see this group of men coming and they look like common peasants and then that same one says and who are you what are you doing here because because they think they're here just to try and get food or just cause them cause a disturbance because we've got this great entrance way going on and jesus steps forth and says i'm jesus of nazareth jesus yep sure come there's no big welcome mat remember attitude i'm talking about attitude here you know and so jesus comes in and no doubt when simon gave the orders to the footwash slunky and the person who anoints and kisses makes welcome all those people no doubt something would have flashed through their minds when he instructed them don't wash his feet don't anoint him don't make them welcome same with a flash through their minds jesus what's he done i heard he healed the sick i heard he raised the dead i heard he set this person free i heard he did this he's only done good to people and something would have flashed through their minds but this doesn't seem quite right because pharisee jones came he spat on me the other time that one doesn't give me time of day this one doesn't care about me and yet i've got to wash their feet and all these things but all because they weren't willing to go beyond what simon the pharisee said they would have tried to reason with it but then no doubt maybe the footwash flankie said well i've got the lowest paying job here first in first out so so so i just started last week i can't yo this is too important i've got a job now and the others would have thought well i really want to anoint him i really want to make him welcome but i can't stick my neck out above these others if they're not going to do it well i can't do it we can't go with the crowd are you all following me and they would have had this battle in their minds but but but we should but well we can't but we should but we can't and well if well if the person in front of the fort wash flunky makes him oh no no if the man with the guest list you know gives him some great flattery then i'll know yes it's right to anoint you know wash his feet we can't respond to the word because of how others are responding we can't just say oh yeah well if no one's going to cry and praise god well i'm not going to do it or you know if everyone's going to fall asleep well i can't be happier yeah we yeah we can't respond because of how it what what everyone else is doing you know the first convention i ever went to was was up in auckland brother ron spencer and brother harold hildebrand were preaching and and i i i went with um brother emerson to go get jose from the bus or wherever so we turn up to the first meeting late and the deacons of the ushers put me on the front row and i sat there i thought praise god because there's no there's no distractions in front of me i can't see what all the monkeys are doing i don't care about it that's me and god hallelujah isn't that right and and i thought well i'm just going to sit here for the rest of the you know so i didn't what sorry you're not monkeys but you know what i mean you know who cares about this but some people they want to sit in the back and they want to sit now don't feel bad where you're sitting but it's motive and objective sure if you've got little kids here but you know some people they want to sit in the middle of the back though and see what everyone else is doing she's wearing this and he's wearing that and look at him do this and doing and they're missing god god wants to pour himself in and change your life and they're really missing what he wants to do to them and then so you know so i just decided i'm just going to sit in the front and i didn't it was a glorious time but that's the problem the footwork slunky thought well if he reads out his name a certain way then i'll wash his feet and then the one anointing they don't talk about it they say well if the foot was flunky because he's before me if he washes his feet then i'll anoint him then the one making welcome said well if if if the one reading the guest list says it this way footwork slunky does it this way this person anoints i'm going to make him welcome but there's the pressure but simon what about my boss jesus is the best boss and so jesus comes in and i don't know how but therefore was slunky he saw those feet walking and he pulls the ball to one side i i just i just i just don't know how you could do it you think about how could you how could you be there this is your opportunity here comes this man you've heard he raised the dead healed the sick cast out devils he's only done good and you've got an opportunity to wash those feet you know and then so here he is he pulls the bowl away because of his reasoning he says no no i'm going to keep church order if it's the anointing of god doing it it's an order that is church order man's control is not church order that's man's control so he says well i better keep pharisee jones church order he pulls the ball away and jesus just keeps walking and the person with the anointing maybe they turn around try and act busy trying to do something because they can't look the word in the face and turn it down that way you know we should just be honest sometimes but somebody yeah they try and do different things and you know they don't want to you know but realize you just come out and say no amen yeah you know the rebuke of this age is i worry you're hot or cold but you're lukewarm you know the definition of lukewarm from webster is is one of them is actually a lack of conviction that's that's being lukewarm a lack of conviction so you have a bit of conviction but there's a lack of it there's not enough to it so these people you could say well lukewarm they didn't have they lacked conviction to really welcome the lord in even if they reasoned we should really hey this is this is more than a teacher more than a rabbi he's done incredible things bible days are here again we can have a different kind of you know but they reasoned it away and then he walks in and then now here comes the one who's going to usher him to his seat puts them in the corner with unwashed feet all because of reasoning bubble characters but there was someone standing outside remember there's always someone where jesus is someone's going to anoint him someone's going to make him welcome someone's going to do the job hallelujah it doesn't it yeah and the thing is this woman she wasn't worried about what everyone else thought see that's the big problem everyone else thought well pharisees simon will think this so i can't do this and the foot wash flunky thinks this so i can't do this and they're all worried about and that's why i gave that about the first convention i went to i don't care what everyone else was doing i'm gonna have a good time i'll let god change my life hallelujah wasn't that a good time hallelujah brother chris wasn't a good time amen you know and then so there was someone standing on the outside she wasn't invited hallelujah she wasn't on the guest list she wasn't even included but yet something stood up in her heart that's wrong that's wrong that he's been not made welcome look at him sitting in the corner there you know with those kind of feasts people would kind of gather around the outside to see who's there in the music and try and get some free food and whatever more and you know but she went there and she looked and she thought this is wrong this is wrong that he's not been made welcome this is wrong that this church surface is a bit stale and cold and starchy this is wrong i want to do him a service i want to anoint him i want to make him welcome and she stood up in her heart hello she didn't look at what well well if he does it if he makes a move first then i'll make my move or if she says this i'll do this or you know well maybe if they put him in a better seat then i'll then i'll go in no no she didn't consider any of that hello she went home the prophet says she got all of her money not just some of her money all of her money now this woman was a prostitute we know that don't we so she got all of her earnings from her ill-gotten game not just some of it whole thing goes under her mattress grabs the bag out picks it up puts it into her dress and then she runs through the apothecary door bangs open sweat on her brow no doubt she comes in and there's the and there's the apothecary owner guy and he turns around sees who walks in the door as the you know you know the bell jingles as the door comes open he says oh you what do you want why are you here you know looks down his nose at her and oh yeah okay he says and and she's looking and she says i want your best my best and he takes her money back pulls it out on the on the bench and no doubt his eyes lit up as oh well ma'am welcome to my shop you're so welcome to be here i'm so welcome but please what can i get you and he reaches up to the very best puts in a verified alabaster box and gives it to her and she puts it in her robe and then she makes a beeline straight for the feast there's a lot of obstacles in her way [Music] there's guards there's servants there's only one door in there's only one door into the feast she's got to get in there hallelujah we can come to church there can be a lot of obstacles we just had a busy week the devil's been jumping down up and down on our heads we've had trouble sickness strife going on and different feelings whatever more they're gonna be a lot of things in the way but she was determined i have this alabaster box i'm gonna i'm gonna i want to anoint him hallelujah she had no idea how she was gonna be received somehow she got past the guards i don't know how she did it but you know if there's a if there's a desire there's a way through if there's a burden there's a way through it may seem impossible but there's a way through god just somehow opens doors where there seems to be no door he makes a way where there seems to be no way so somehow she slipped past the guards slipped past all these ones and you know if we can backtrack a little bit can you imagine the attitude of the even even even the even the thought when simon said don't wash this man's feet no doubt some of the servants would have been getting a bit upset in themselves he's going to traipse all that dirt and that mud in here and he's going to make these pillows messy and the carpets messy and all the job you know and maybe i think in their mind well what if we wash his feet so he doesn't do this or make our life easier afterwards but they're all worried about simon anyway she grabs her alabaster box she gets through and she's looking for someone and she sees him locks you know sees them no doubt maybe some people are turning around looking to who she is who's this one coming to my feast who's this one you know and she makes a beeline straight for his feet she has no idea how she's going to be received hallelujah she has no idea remember this man's a prophet he can look straight through someone and see their heart and their condition but that's the kind of people god wants at his feet amen it's not those people who have who have the attitude i've got it all together look i've been in the message four billion years i'm fine you know i know all the quotes and all the doctrine and you know you know my phone can out quote me and in many languages that can out quote me right it can my phone can out quote me with the scripture but god i'm taking this in a rapture the devil cannot quote me hallelujah he can't but he can't produce the life right so we must never get an attitude well i know it all no we don't know it all we're on our journey god is still ministering to us and making us more like him so she runs in she has no idea am i going to be received by the is he going to pull his feet away what's he going to do but there's something when you get into the prince of god you begin to act a little bit hysterical she began to cry hello she wasn't all stoic and and you know lifeless but you know she something moved on her heart because she as she began to pour her life out at his feet she realized here i am stepping into the holiest of holies hear me blackened out a sinner lost to begin with but now i'm standing in the prince of more than just a man hallelujah she wasn't waiting for what everyone else was doing she didn't care about everyone else she said i've got to get to him i've got to anoint him and she takes the alabaster box now winner alabaster box is broken you can't put it back together hallelujah it's broken so she came past but the thing is when she looked in and she saw that he wasn't made welcome she had already crossed a point of no return she had already crossed the point of no return what do you mean by a point of no return or maybe i won't do this today maybe it's a bad idea she crossed the point of no return she made up in her heart i'm going to anoint this man i'm going to anoint this prophet and she gave all of her money she yeah because what that was a manifestation when you cross a point of no return i don't care what the world says about me what my friends say about me what my family says about me what anyone says about me i don't care what they say i've crossed the point of no return i'm going all the way jesus i'm going all the way what your word says to do i shall do how i shall be i shall be i mean like ruth she came to a point naomi your god is my god your people my people will you die i'll die she passed a point of no return hallelujah isn't it glorious to break through that sound barrier you just make up your mind somehow god makes up your mind for you a lot of wrestling going on and this but then god just makes up your mind no you're going to cross this point hallelujah hallelujah so she goes in she breaks her alabaster box she pulls her whole life out of his feet hallelujah and then she begins to weep because we get a bit hysterical when we get into the prince of god and there she is pouring her life out you know it's amazing in the presence of god when someone thinks something an answer comes because her whole worship didn't just stay in a corner she hadn't asked permission to do it either but the fragrance that ointment filled the whole house and her weeping and her crying and her losing thank you jesus and forgive me i've lost it forgive me lord and here i am fill the whole house and it interrupted their third course and maybe some others were looked over and some others who would have thought i should do that yes but they didn't step up and join her see it's an individual affair with god it's not me and everyone else and if they're doing it well everyone else is doing it that's probably the silliest silliest reason ever but no one else got up even though they probably would have thought i'm glad his feet are being washed you can't just sympathize with us with the gospel you've got to partake of the gospel hallelujah so here they are and the whole whole whole thing's being interrupted because of this woman and then simon thinks within himself if he really was a prophet if he were see this just proves me this man is not what he claims to be he would have known what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner as he's thinking that an answer is going to come and jesus answering said unto him no he didn't say this out loud he thought it in his heart and then he said simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master sayon there were certain creditors which had two debtors one owed 500 pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will he love love him most simon answer said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto and said unto simon see us thou this woman i entered into thy house that gave us me no water for my feet for she hath washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head she thou gave us me no kiss but that but this woman since the time i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou does not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven now you think about that really our sin debt is all the same it may be on paper on our human mind someone's more of a sinner than the other but really sin is sin we're all born in sin the wages of sin is death it's the same wages right so in reality if we are forgiven much we will love much so if we're really forgiven who knows they're forgiven today amen the lord has washed all your sins away amen so therefore if he's done that irrespective of your past it doesn't matter what past we came came from but he's forgiven it all other so if he's forgiven at all then we love much but if someone legally tries to justify their old life and who they are then they'll begin to quantify things well my old life wasn't as bad as that guy and that protocol and this one and what happens is they begin to quantify it therefore they'll love little because they think they were forgiven of less than the other guy who is forgiven of more are you following me amen amen but those who are truly know the forgiveness of god as brother ahmad said this morning a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon and those who have truly accepted that part and they know they will love much because they have been forgiven much hallelujah amen and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him begin to say within themselves who is this the forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith is safety go in peace hallelujah see there'll always be someone who will anoint the word yes there'll always be someone who'll anoint the word that will go beyond the status quo of life and you know they'll actually go beyond what everyone else is doing everyone else is thinking oh will this be okay she didn't ask anyone she had to anoint the word that was her burden this word must be anointed i must put it but i must sit at its feet hallelujah and that's what she did amen and she as a true believer receives hallelujah she left that place she didn't know maybe she didn't she didn't sneak out she just probably would have walked out i've been forgiven i've been washed in the blood of the lamb hallelujah she had no more money to her name but she didn't care because she had given it all to the right hallelujah hallelujah and she walked out forgiven now let's just bring this down on home what bible character are you amen are you simon the pharisee tries to put a dampner on on god living now i'm not just talking about i'm not really even talking about him i'm talking about what about in your home we can be simon the pharisee in our own home where it just becomes a religious order and gods can't even get in there and you know because of attitudes and so on and you know are we like that oh see the biggest problem people have is letting go and letting god do us do what he wants to do are we like that or are we what like the foot wash flunky or the other servants that they'd rather hold on to their next coin hold on to job security i'm secure in my little life this is all i know my dad was a foot wash flunky his his dad was a foot washed slunky i come from a great line of footwash slunkies and and and two and to go against my boss i'll now get fired and that means i've got to step into the unknown it's worth stepping into the unknown with god because he knows the unknown so are we that kind of people or what about the one who anoints and they say well if that person does it first then i'll just i'll just join in are we that kind of people remember your life is like brother brahm says your life that you're currently living shows you who you are in the scripture or are we like the woman with the alabaster box hallelujah where wait hey i wasn't invited to this thing do you think about this i'm not talking about simon's house now i'm talking about the spiritual feast of the word i wasn't invited i wasn't on the first guest list but then there came a call where god said go to the highways and to the byways get the good get the bad get the maim to halt the blind whatever they are doesn't matter what condition they are go get them and compel them to come and one day the lord came my way and said you're you're made by the world you're blind you can't see amen your halt amen you're you're bad hallelujah he said get the good and the bad hallelujah so it doesn't matter what condition and and the spiritual compelled me and i found i wasn't on the first guest list but i ended up in the feast if i can put it that way i'm using the parable of the wedding feast we all know where i am hallelujah she's having to find ourselves here she wasn't invited but she was the one who really made the party the party hallelujah and i'm going to leave that with you what is your life is your life anointing the word that it lives hallelujah giving it first place that he lives or they say well if this person breaks through then i'll break through if that person gets the holy ghost then i'll get the whole i'll just join right in with it we don't want to be like that oh look we have the musicians please this morning hey man yeah hey man let's um yeah i'm just going to leave it there who are you in your life today the religious one at the feast or the one with the alabaster box or the servant just doing what you know you know a big excuse that they had at the nuremberg trials the nazis at the war crimes they said we were just following orders they all gave that excuse it didn't stand eichmann years later got caught and argentina got taken to israel and and he was put on trial he just said i was just following orders the fort wash flunky's excuse what is it going to be at the great wine throw judgment missed this opportunity i was just following orders it doesn't stand we don't want to be like that amen hallelujah let's just stand this morning don't hold on to your alabaster box of your life break it at his feet give your all amy what song you got this that yeah amen yeah touching jesus that really matters amen oh yeah the words that touching jesus is all that really matters amen a woman tried many physicians [Music] yet growers so to jesus and when they could try to restrain her oh she whispered these words through her face oh touching jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same there is only one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name they said jesus could meet my every need [Music] and when this prisoner finally touch jesus [Music] he set me free praise his name i'm free indeed [Music] o touching jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same there is only one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name oh touching jesus oh touching jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same there is only one way to touch him just believe when you call out his name hallelujah oh jesus hallelujah hallelujah lord god amen let's let's pray together in sincerity this morning gracious heavenly father oh lord i don't want to be like a footwash flunky

hearts you're welcome lord lord if we come before people lord me and brother ben spoke about it the other day when we come before people lord you will speak it's if they can receive it or not lord but let you keep speaking through your bride let you keep testifying through all of us lord let our lives be so sincere and so surrender lord that they can see christ again displayed on this earth lord for there's no hope there's no life outside of you lord lord it doesn't make us anything special it makes us a privileged people a humble people lord a priesthood chosen for you for this age lord a place where you chose to dwell when you chose to speak from that you chose to deliver that you chose to heal that you chose to restore that you gave back our sight of eyes lord a sincerity a true worship lord a heart of feeling the softness the pliable that you made us lord that we will not look at any other person but through the love of god let us not measure to any measurement but the measurement of christ lord that we see that life being lived through our word and no lord that we should tailor to that and that alone lord and if our lives don't match up with that help us lord have mercy father teach us lord train us lord lord if we need to be broken break us lord because lord we know that it might look like a big old-fashioned mess it might look like lord nothing's happening in our life lord but god that's just what the enemy points out but my god is sovereign my god is almighty and he is here to change lives to go in a rapture lord to take a walk and to make a body change lord lord we didn't come here to plateau off we didn't come here to not manifest the word and the promise for our age lord we came here to be time-tested memorials epistles written and read about all men reads us lord lord where can people find jesus if we don't manifest you lord how can people find love lord if we don't love how can lord people see joy if we're not joyful lord please give us that in our lives regardless of our situation let go regardless of like brother ben said that pleasure lord regardless even of who supplies our needs naturally you are the true provider lord help us lord may we leave this building a changed people may we leave this building just a little bit closer to you lord a little bit closer to one another a little bit closer lord and with more patience and a bit more love and a bit more understanding lord may you just add precept upon precept and line upon line lord and hear a little and there a little lord but let us not be little let us not belittle anyone that is around us let us never raise up like that pharisee lord like brother ben said he had audience with you he could ask you anything he could sincerely seek his salvation with fear and trembling lord that man simon would have asked you lord you hold the words of eternal life what do i need to do lord to enter the kingdom of heaven oh father let us not be like that lord bless every brother and sister here lord may this week be a week of joy of peace oh lord just of walking with you in such a place lord above all this earth lord in heavenly places where whatever happens we will see it as spiritually and as you speaking to us and lord and you training us and teaching us every single thing lord that happens this week may we see the god of this creation working through that to get us in opposition so that we all can come to your supper table lord and sit and rest and worship and just be how we was when you thought of us the first time lord let us be like that this week i pray in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen amen amen you know what he's so good brother ben this week he just proves himself over hey man we had some fellowship i have to share a little testimony me and brother ben speak about a couple of things the next morning on the daily altar it comes out ben comes preach on it this morning's daily out there comes out god just does that because he wants everyone to be there so he just wants to go hey there's more and as we're willing to receive that every little bit of manner every day he'll keep adding don't throw anything away and don't say anything's not for you because god has a nice way of bringing it back because you ask a question god himself is going to give you the answer it might not be in the way you think but he will give you that answer because he's not a god of confusion but sometimes we get so busy in our minds trying to fight these things we forget just to to take out a bible read and sister robin that always god bless his soul always shares the daily altar every morning you read that and then when you start reading it just ask the lord is this this lord is this what you're talking about and then once you start doing it now you have a two-way conversation with god and he starts helping you and guiding you on what is actually the truth for your day but but don't get hard don't get busy life is busy enough take time to stop and say lord speak to me how many of us has ever went and sat on a couch just for our i know we don't have it and say lord speak to me and just sit there you don't have to try to figure it out you don't have to try to over pray everything just sit there and think on him and he will come just take time to spend time with god amen i think let's sing the final song and as we go you can go after this one but i think we should sing this one with brother isaac wrote the body change it's not this long it's just one so amen who's going to walk do a body change amen it's going to happen it's going to happen the scripture says it it is our time you're going to find yourself just one just keep walking walking i'll just keep walking a bit higher amen let's go to heaven hey amen i'm gonna walk right up into a body change i feel it coming on and it might be today i'm gonna walk right up into eternity and i'll step into my theophany enoch was a walking walking with the lord
