[30:46] to10. And it says here, "But which of
[30:48] you having a servant plowing or feeding
[30:50] cattle will say unto him, by and by when
[30:54] the morning comes, Amen.
[30:57] when he has come from the field, go and
[31:00] sit down to meet, and will not rather
[31:02] say unto him, make ready wherewith I may
[31:04] s myself, and serve me, till I have
[31:08] eaten and drunken, and afterwards thou
[31:10] shalt eat and drink." Does he thank that
[31:13] servant because he did the things that
[31:15] were commanded of him? I tro not. So
[31:18] likewise you when you have shall have
[31:21] done all those things which are
[31:22] commanded you say we are unprofitable
[31:25] servants. We have done that which was
[31:27] our duty to do. Amen.
[31:30] Amen.
[31:30] Hallelujah. In 1 Peter 1:es 22, it says
[31:33] here, "Seeing you have purified your
[31:37] souls in obeying the truth through the
[31:39] spirit unto the unfeigned love of the
[31:42] brethren." Amen. See that you love one
[31:45] another with a pure heart fervently.
[31:48] Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to
[31:50] his word. You may be seated. Amen.
[31:53] Hallelujah. Amen. But you know that word
[31:56] there in 1 Peter 1:22, it says there
[31:58] unto the unfeigned love of the brethren,
[32:01] that love of the brethren is
[32:02] Philadelphia. And it's yeah, brotherly
[32:05] fraternal kindness, brotherly kindness,
[32:07] fondness. Amen. Hallelujah. And yet it
[32:10] says, "But see that you love agapeo one
[32:14] another with a pure heart fervently."
[32:16] Amen. And so you see it's calling for a
[32:20] twocorded love. Amen.
[32:22] Amen. It's calling calling for not just
[32:25] agapeo love, but it's calling for a
[32:28] Philadelphia love, a felio love. Amen.
[32:31] And so I want to speak in the importance
[32:34] of the two loves coming out of our
[32:37] lives. Amen. And that we need to have
[32:39] both of them. Amen. Hallelujah. We will
[32:43] get into some things soon, but let me
[32:44] just lay a little foundation first.
[32:46] Hallelujah. So from Matthew chapter 10
[32:49] verse 37. Amen. And I just want you to
[32:52] see that we are called to file love
[32:55] Jesus more than any other. You know that
[32:58] yes, we're called to agape o love Jesus
[33:00] and agape love God and God agape love
[33:03] us. And there to be agape love. Amen. Do
[33:06] you know the agape love is a feast of
[33:08] love. Amen. It's not just a small little
[33:11] bit of love. It's not just a trickle of
[33:12] love, but it's actually a feast. It's
[33:14] actually an inexhaustible fountain of
[33:16] love. And that the essence and the very
[33:19] origin of that is God himself.
[33:21] Hallelujah.
[33:22] Amen.
[33:22] Amen. But yet we're still called to have
[33:25] a felio love for God. And so in Matthew
[33:27] 10:37 and a felio love for each other,
[33:31] of course. Amen.
[33:32] Hallelujah. But it cannot stop with one.
[33:34] And it cannot just be the other. But it
[33:36] must be both. Amen. For it to work and
[33:39] to be optimized. Am I speaking your
[33:41] language tonight? Who knows what
[33:42] optimized means? Hallelujah. who's had
[33:44] to optimize their program or optimize
[33:47] their work ethic because it's just not
[33:49] working very well. Well, if you want to
[33:51] optimize your love tonight, then you
[33:53] need to love with aio love and agape
[33:55] love. Amen. But there's reasons why
[33:58] sometimes we can't love with both loves.
[34:00] There's reasons why we're fearful to
[34:02] release love to people. Amen. Because
[34:05] some love has condition and some love
[34:07] doesn't have condition.
[34:08] Oh, my Jesus.
[34:09] Amen. Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself
[34:11] now.
[34:12] Let me lay the foundation. Hallelujah.
[34:14] Amen. Start pulling soon. Amen.
[34:16] Hallelujah. Amen. He that loveth father
[34:19] or mother more than me is not worthy of
[34:22] me. And that word love is felio. So he
[34:24] that fileo loveth father and mother. So
[34:27] if you're filelio, human love. Now the
[34:30] human love that you have the emotional
[34:32] love. The love that has conditions.
[34:34] Amen. That love of connection and
[34:36] brother brotherhood and fatherhood and
[34:38] sunship. a real connection amongst
[34:41] people. That love, if you love, if you
[34:43] love your father or mother in that way
[34:46] more than you love Jesus, then you're
[34:48] not even worthy to be his disciple.
[34:50] Because something will happen and it
[34:52] when it does, if your love is higher for
[34:54] anything else other than him, it can
[34:56] cause corruption in your motives.
[34:58] Yes, Lord.
[34:59] And then God can't actually really use
[35:01] you until the love is correct and it's
[35:05] placed in the right place. Amen.
[35:07] Come on.
[35:07] Hallelujah. Amen.
[35:08] So, he's not worthy of me. And he that
[35:10] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[35:13] not worthy of me.
[35:16] He's not asking much because he's
[35:17] actually worthy of more love than any
[35:19] other. Hallelujah.
[35:20] Hallelujah.
[35:21] And actually, if you're going to cast
[35:22] your investment in something, you might
[35:24] as well cast your investment in God.
[35:26] Amen. Don't cast your investment in some
[35:27] man that's gonna fail you.
[35:29] Amen.
[35:29] Hallelujah. Although we're called to
[35:31] love them. Amen. And you want to cast
[35:34] this, you want to cast a investment, but
[35:36] your greatest investment, your soul,
[35:39] your whole life, everything that you are
[35:41] must be in him first.
[35:43] Amen.
[35:43] Praise the Lord.
[35:44] Hallelujah.
[35:45] Amen.
[35:46] Amen. 1 Peter 4:8, it says, "And above
[35:48] all things, have fervent charity."
[35:51] That's agape. Now, now we're moving into
[35:52] a higher love. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[35:56] above all things, have fervent charity.
[35:59] Agape love feast among yourselves
[36:03] for charity. Agape love feast shall
[36:06] cover the multitude of sins. Hallelujah.
[36:10] Amen. That's very challenging. So if
[36:12] you're a person that gets upset about
[36:13] the faults of your brothers and sisters
[36:15] all the time and they're just welling up
[36:17] within you, maybe you just need a feast.
[36:19] Maybe you just need some love in your
[36:21] life.
[36:22] Hallelujah. Maybe you just need an
[36:24] outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
[36:25] Hallelujah. And you know what? I tell
[36:27] you what, if you get an outpouring of
[36:29] the Holy Ghost, no, no one's faults or
[36:31] anything going to trouble you no more.
[36:33] Amen. You're going to be so happy all
[36:34] the time.
[36:35] That's going to neutralize the enemy.
[36:37] It's going to neutralize the effect of
[36:38] the faults of everyone else around you.
[36:40] Won't even think about it cuz you're
[36:42] just so full of love because there's a
[36:44] feast for you.
[36:47] A feast for you. A feast for you,
[36:49] brother and Paul.
[36:50] A feast.
[36:50] Hallelujah.
[36:51] Hallelujah. Oh, I I I need a feast.
[36:54] Who's looking for a feast?
[36:55] Yes, sir. Well, there's a feast for you
[36:57] and it's called divine love, agape.
[37:00] Hallelujah.
[37:00] And it's God himself. It's the highest
[37:03] essence form of anything. It's him.
[37:06] Hallelujah.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:07] He's made of that. You want to know what
[37:08] God's made out of? He's made out of
[37:10] agape.
[37:11] Hallelujah.
[37:11] And he says it's ready for you. You can
[37:14] have that. It says above all things.
[37:17] Amen.
[37:18] Very important that this agape is love
[37:21] is expressed and agape love. It's a love
[37:24] that doesn't have conditions. It's a
[37:26] love that doesn't have limits.
[37:28] Hallelujah.
[37:29] And yet there is an attribute of this
[37:32] love that requires felio love as well.
[37:35] There must be felio love. There must be
[37:38] a human love. There must be a
[37:39] connection. You cannot exist just with
[37:42] divine love alone
[37:44] in this world
[37:45] cuz we're humans. We're natural. And
[37:47] there must be emotional connection.
[37:49] Hallelujah.
[37:50] Divine love can disconnect. It can be
[37:52] you can actually have this love that has
[37:54] no conditions. Then no one can hurt you.
[37:57] You're protected by unconditional love.
[37:59] So you can do all the service. You can
[38:01] do all the great things and be the
[38:03] blessed man of duty, valor, valiant and
[38:07] gallant and so gallant, but you don't
[38:09] even feel your love people.
[38:10] Oh my. because you don't want to be hurt
[38:12] because something happened to you maybe
[38:13] in your past and you don't want to
[38:15] release that feelio love anymore because
[38:17] it's got conditions and it's you become
[38:20] vulnerable when the emotion is connected
[38:22] to other people but hallelujah when you
[38:26] are in a feast of divine love amen it
[38:29] just changes everything amen it becomes
[38:31] fearless because perfect love casts out
[38:34] all fear
[38:35] yes sir
[38:35] amen so don't be afraid to love your
[38:38] brothers and sisters don't be afraid
[38:40] that You can emotionally connect to
[38:42] people.
[38:43] Amen.
[38:44] Amen.
[38:44] Don't be afraid, saints.
[38:47] Glory.
[38:47] Hallelujah.
[38:48] Man, I just got that's right to the end
[38:49] of my sermon already.
[38:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Wow. Amen. Sometimes
[38:53] you just need to share what you're going
[38:55] to go to. Is that right?
[38:57] Amen.
[38:57] Hallelujah.
[38:58] Hallelujah.
[39:00] You know, sometimes these ministers,
[39:02] they're so good, they can hold
[39:03] themselves back and they can build right
[39:04] up into a crescendo and it it's just a
[39:07] huge effect at the end. But I just can't
[39:09] do it.
[39:11] I just can't do it. I can't help myself.
[39:13] Amen. But God
[39:15] rich in mercy. Amen.
[39:17] Amen.
[39:17] Hallelujah.
[39:19] Among yourselves for charity, agape
[39:21] shall cover the multitude of sins.
[39:24] Amen. So here it says now, now you want
[39:27] to now you've got it. Now you've got
[39:30] this love. You've got this charity. Now
[39:31] it's got to be expressed. It says now
[39:33] use hospitality. It says and hospitality
[39:36] is a fondness of guests. You know that
[39:39] hospitality is to be fond of guests.
[39:42] Hallelujah. So you don't want to be
[39:43] fond. You want to bring people over. You
[39:45] want to be fond of them and you want to
[39:47] shower blessings upon them. What are you
[39:49] doing? You're actually now you're you're
[39:51] because this felio, this brotherly love
[39:54] is conditional. So what you do is you
[39:56] create conditions to make it grow.
[39:58] You create conditions to kindle fire.
[40:01] Real love fire.
[40:02] Amen.
[40:02] Amen.
[40:03] Amen.
[40:03] That's why you bring people over. That's
[40:04] why you open your house. That's why you
[40:06] you become vulnerable and you open to
[40:08] them and connect to them and you become
[40:10] their friend, best friend like Jonathan
[40:12] and David. What if we were all best
[40:15] friends like Jonathan and David?
[40:17] Oh my,
[40:17] what sort of atmosphere can God work
[40:20] then?
[40:21] If we're all like Jonathan and David,
[40:23] our soul love each other, you know, real
[40:26] love,
[40:28] real connection. Hallelujah. If if felio
[40:31] love is conditional based on situations
[40:34] and things then you make the conditions
[40:37] so that your friends will love you.
[40:39] You bring them over. Use hospitality.
[40:41] You've got to then you know there's
[40:42] these things that must be done to create
[40:44] a an atmosphere.
[40:46] Amen. To make someone feel love because
[40:48] that human love needs something to help
[40:51] connect.
[40:52] Amen.
[40:53] But don't be afraid to agape here. I've
[40:55] got some um Hallelujah.
[40:58] Hallelujah. I've got some uh some
[40:59] definitions here that we'll get to. Now,
[41:02] agape, it's um it says love, that is
[41:05] affection or a benevolence,
[41:09] specifically
[41:11] plural, a love feast. Amen. Charity
[41:15] and God is agape. And then agapeo
[41:19] because they're two different um words.
[41:22] And it says here that it is to love in a
[41:26] social or moral sense.
[41:29] So now if you go down to filio because
[41:33] you know I've been looking at this and
[41:34] actually you know this I wasn't even
[41:37] going to preach on this but you know I
[41:39] stepped aside from my series that has
[41:41] been placed on my heart and I just
[41:42] prayed for a moment and said Lord do you
[41:44] want me to preach something else and
[41:46] then this just went boom just just
[41:49] downloaded. So here we are. So anyway,
[41:53] Felio, it says here to be a friend.
[41:56] Hallelujah. Fond of
[41:59] Amen. an individual or an object that is
[42:03] have affection for a personal
[42:05] attachment. Hallelujah. That's what we
[42:08] need today, saints, is personal
[42:10] attachment.
[42:11] Hallelujah. We need to be attached to
[42:13] each other on a friendship level. We
[42:15] need to be fond of each other. And Amen.
[42:18] Sometimes it's hard to be fond of
[42:19] people. Hallelujah. But if you get a
[42:21] love feast, it'll just cover all the
[42:23] faults. It'll cover all the differences
[42:25] and you'll just love them with yourself
[42:27] and you'll love them.
[42:29] Hallelujah.
[42:30] Amen.
[42:30] Amen. You know, I don't want to say it
[42:32] yet. I'll say it later. I'll be good as
[42:34] a matter of sentiment or feeling. It
[42:36] says, now this is now Felio is very much
[42:39] feelings, right? There's a lot of
[42:41] sentiment and feeling behind this.
[42:43] There's a connection. There's an
[42:44] adoration. There is a worship.
[42:47] Yeah.
[42:48] Hallelujah.
[42:49] Amen. It's different. Divine love is is
[42:52] is more it's it's an obligation almost.
[42:55] It's more of a moral order.
[42:58] It's more keeping the bigger picture and
[43:01] seeing the whole thing and then acting
[43:03] out of responsibility
[43:05] and love.
[43:06] Hallelujah.
[43:06] That's a big love. It's hard to
[43:08] understand. It's hard to comprehend.
[43:10] Amen.
[43:11] Amen.
[43:11] Hallelujah. But that's God. But yet God,
[43:14] rich in his mercy, while we were yet
[43:17] sinners, loved us.
[43:18] Amen. And so when that love is expressed
[43:21] now divine grace can take over.
[43:24] Amen. Divine grace when divine love is
[43:27] expressed sovereign grace can take its
[43:29] place.
[43:30] Amen.
[43:31] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[43:32] Hallelujah.
[43:32] Amen.
[43:34] Now, now it's talking when we're reading
[43:36] in Felio, it says here to denoting a
[43:38] personal attachment as a matter of
[43:41] sentiment or feeling. Now while agapeo
[43:44] is wider embracing especially the
[43:49] judgment and the deliberate now this is
[43:51] I'm just reading this and it's the
[43:53] deliberate ascent of the will as a
[43:56] matter of principle
[43:59] duty and propriety
[44:02] proper things to be done properly
[44:05] redemption must be proper
[44:07] there is a duty of a redeemer to carry
[44:09] it out
[44:10] a great gallant soldier will carry out
[44:12] his calling and election
[44:14] and he's garlic in his force and he will
[44:16] do it just right. But he can do that
[44:18] without even loving people on a human
[44:20] level.
[44:20] Do you know that
[44:22] you've got to have the connection down
[44:24] here too?
[44:25] Hallelujah. For God himself could not
[44:28] stay lofty.
[44:29] Couldn't stay way up in the heavens un
[44:32] imaginable and unreachable.
[44:35] But our God, he condescended.
[44:37] Hallelujah. He condescended so we could
[44:40] understand him and he manifested himself
[44:42] in felio love.
[44:44] You know that
[44:45] I never knew it until two days ago. I
[44:49] started researching with and there's
[44:51] many scriptures of God expressing felio
[44:53] love as well.
[44:54] I never knew it. I thought it was just
[44:55] us.
[44:56] Oh, I believe it.
[44:57] But no, something he revealed something
[44:58] so powerful
[45:00] to meow
[45:01] in that
[45:02] and I thought wow it's powerful. How
[45:05] this amazing love of God Jesus.
[45:08] But you you've to to reach it, to
[45:10] understand it, he condescended.
[45:13] Hallelujah.
[45:14] Praise God.
[45:14] You hear this song, what condescension,
[45:17] bringing us redemption.
[45:19] He took the form of man, revealed the
[45:22] hidden plan. Hallelujah.
[45:23] Amen.
[45:24] To reveal
[45:26] filelio love.
[45:27] Oh. And he says that you you and he says
[45:30] after I can't remember where in John 16
[45:33] he says now the fatherio loves you
[45:37] because you felio loved me and you
[45:41] received me as coming forth from the
[45:44] father.
[45:44] Yes Lord.
[45:45] So there's a connection on a human
[45:47] level.
[45:48] So that the divine love can be
[45:51] manifested but connected.
[45:54] Yes.
[45:54] Are you following me?
[45:55] Yes. It's because otherwise we can hide
[45:59] in fear of releasing emotional
[46:02] connection to people.
[46:03] But don't do it cuz you're not alone.
[46:07] Your felio love when you connect to
[46:09] people is not alone. It's backed up by
[46:12] gape love.
[46:14] It's backed up by gave love.
[46:15] Hallelujah.
[46:16] It's backed up by the love of God.
[46:17] Praise the Lord.
[46:18] Hallelujah.
[46:19] Amen.
[46:19] So you can't there's no need to fear.
[46:22] Amen.
[46:23] Hallelujah. And it's more than just
[46:25] fear. It's also family traits, culture,
[46:28] you know, stalwart soldiering soldiers
[46:31] in the of the cross, gallant old school
[46:33] men. And they're too too too hard and
[46:36] too high and lofty to connect even with
[46:38] their children. It's all about duty.
[46:41] It's all about this is my
[46:42] responsibility. I'm a provider. I'm a
[46:44] real man. But actually, a real man is
[46:47] able to feel your love.
[46:49] Yeah.
[46:49] It's able to connect on a friendship
[46:51] basis. It's able to have feelings.
[46:54] Feelings for people.
[46:56] Real feelings.
[46:56] Yes, sir.
[46:57] Hallelujah.
[46:59] Are you with me?
[47:00] Amen.
[47:01] Hallelujah.
[47:02] Glory.
[47:04] Hallelujah.
[47:05] Praise the Lord.
[47:06] I just when I heard when I read that the
[47:10] the the agapeo not agape now because
[47:13] agape is the essence, the fullness of
[47:15] it, the feast. But agapeo is us loving
[47:19] with that love. Did you know that? It's
[47:21] two different. It's the expression of
[47:23] it. It's it's yes, you can even express
[47:25] ag but that's on a that's the greatest
[47:29] that's above all things. Hallelujah.
[47:31] But agal
[47:33] [Music]
[47:35] love that must accompany felio love.
[47:38] Yes, Lord.
[47:39] The two are intertwined. The two are
[47:41] connected. The two together bring the
[47:44] resurrection. They bring healing. They
[47:47] bring sympathy. they bring for you to
[47:50] feel for the people that you're praying
[47:52] for.
[47:52] You need to
[47:53] Yes, sir.
[47:54] It's not It's not just some objective
[47:56] thing.
[47:57] When you're praying for people, when
[47:58] you're thinking about people,
[48:00] oh Lord, dear Lord, please heal them. Oh
[48:02] Lord, Lord, you know, and but you don't
[48:04] even feel for them,
[48:05] nothing's going to happen.
[48:06] Oh, mercy, my father, my God.
[48:08] Why would it happen if
[48:10] you've got to have a connection?
[48:11] Yes, sir.
[48:12] That connection has to be human
[48:13] connection and divine connection. I'll
[48:16] tell you, I'll show you.
[48:17] Oh, yes. Come on now.
[48:18] Amen. Hallelujah. We're going to pray

[48:30] Let this be mine.
[48:32] Amen.
[48:32] Amen.
[48:33] Let this be mine.
[48:34] Praise the Lord.
[48:35] I'm taking this. I'm not going to let
[48:36] the devil rob me.
[48:38] I'm not going to let the devil try and
[48:40] dissuade or anything. I'm going to take
[48:42] this because it's going to revolutionize
[48:44] my life.
[48:45] Amen.
[48:46] Hallelujah.
[48:46] Amen. You know, we need revolution in
[48:48] our life. Hallelujah.
[48:50] Revolution against the devil. Revolution
[48:52] against the old nature.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:54] Hallelujah.
[48:55] Praise the Lord.
[48:56] Amen.
[48:57] Amen.
[48:58] Glory.
[48:59] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[49:01] Thus they uh and it says here, duty and
[49:05] propriety. The two loves. I put loves in
[49:09] there. The two must stand related. The
[49:12] two thus stand related very much. This
[49:15] is Felio and Agapeo
[49:18] because they are connected together.
[49:21] Hallelujah. Felos is where you is the
[49:24] start of Philadelphia and all the other
[49:26] felo anything apart not felo pastry. So
[49:30] don't get that mixed up. That's with an
[49:32] F. But felos so I don't know if that's
[49:35] even part of philosophy but felos is to
[49:38] and I love this this this definition
[49:40] here properly dare. That is a friend.
[49:46] Amen. And here it is. This is what
[49:48] really spoke to me was actively fond.
[49:51] It's not just some idea.
[49:54] I'm not bringing a doctrine to you. This
[49:56] is not a doctrine. This is active love.
[49:59] This is active fondness.
[50:01] Yes, sir.
[50:01] Hallelujah. The idea of it's good. We
[50:04] can all agree it's good to be fond. But
[50:06] be fond.
[50:08] Have fondness to people.
[50:10] Hallelujah.
[50:11] Amen. Let that felio love
[50:14] truly be the pilot,
[50:16] the pilot flame of your agape
[50:18] expression.
[50:20] It's got to be there's got to be
[50:22] something on the ground.
[50:23] Amen.
[50:24] How can you reach people if you don't
[50:25] care for them and are friends with them
[50:28] and are connected to them and are and
[50:30] are brave enough
[50:32] to let your heart go to them?
[50:34] How brave was David letting his heart go
[50:37] like that to Jonathan? I always marvel
[50:39] at that and it challenges me
[50:41] cuz I and in my own honesty it's hard
[50:43] for me to do that.
[50:44] I find that hard.
[50:46] Maybe it's just the way I was brought
[50:47] up, you know, or whatever I've gone
[50:49] through in my life and I pray and I'm
[50:51] even preaching to myself cuz when I was
[50:53] seeing all this, I was like praying
[50:55] through the whole thing. Lord, I need
[50:58] this. I need to be able to love like
[50:59] this.
[50:59] Yes.
[51:00] I need my brothers and sisters to be my
[51:02] friends like this.
[51:02] Hallelujah.
[51:03] I want to be also open.
[51:06] Hallelujah. So
[51:07] that's why I said are you brave enough
[51:10] to release your heart.
[51:12] Amen.
[51:13] To the brethren.
[51:14] Hallelujah.
[51:14] On the human level,
[51:18] you know, divine level is is is dare I
[51:20] say it, it's easier
[51:23] because there's no comebacks. You love
[51:25] them. No matter what they do to you, you
[51:27] just love them. You know,
[51:28] come on.
[51:29] Hey, you just love them and it just
[51:32] keeps fountaining flowing. Yes, Lord.
[51:34] You don't get hurt by if they just
[51:36] reject you or if they turn you down or
[51:38] whatever it may be or they make a
[51:40] mistake, it doesn't stop that. But when
[51:42] you begin to connect with them on a
[51:44] human level,
[51:45] they can hurt you a little bit more.
[51:47] But that love is not alone.
[51:48] Oh my Jesus,
[51:49] that love is not alone. It's accompanied
[51:51] by God's love.
[51:52] Hallelujah.
[51:53] This is where fear must be dispelled.
[51:56] When you realize that it's actually the
[51:59] perfect love casts out all the fear of
[52:01] you being able to truly connect with
[52:03] your brothers and sisters puritally
[52:06] purely.
[52:07] Amen.
[52:08] Actively fond that is friendly.
[52:11] Hallelujah.
[52:12] Amen.
[52:13] Amen. Hallelujah. Agapeo love will
[52:18] see you selflessly carry out God's
[52:20] commands. Be a good and faithful
[52:23] steward. Serve people regardless of how
[52:26] they treat you. This is agapeo love. Now
[52:29] bring you to bless those around you
[52:31] without grudging.
[52:32] Yeah.
[52:33] Testlessly, tirelessly and fearlessly
[52:37] live and pray for others. This is agapeo
[52:40] love now.
[52:41] Amen. And it never it just keeps going.
[52:44] Bring timely correction based on the
[52:46] greater good. Amen.
[52:48] Amen.
[52:48] Now these I'm just reading out notes now
[52:50] because I believe it's going to help me
[52:52] stay on to the track here. while agapero
[52:54] love is expressed unconditional
[52:57] without caution of or fear of
[53:00] consequence. And when I was reading
[53:02] that, I was like, you know, I ended up
[53:04] cuz I when I was when I under the
[53:06] inspiration, I was writing it out and I
[53:08] almost burst into tears when the word
[53:10] came out, even this love is reckless.
[53:13] And you know that song reckless love.
[53:16] Well, actually to me from this what I've
[53:19] seen, it's not the agape love that's
[53:20] reckless. It's the felio love. It's that
[53:23] human love that can be because that word
[53:25] reckless in the positive is is to
[53:28] release love without caution or fear of
[53:31] consequences.
[53:33] Are you are you able to release that
[53:36] love knowing that you may be let down
[53:39] knowing that you may be betrayed?
[53:42] Can you?
[53:44] And I say yes, you can.
[53:46] Amen.
[53:46] Because it's not alone.
[53:49] Not alone. There's divine love. a feast
[53:51] of divine love for you. And as you
[53:54] express that love and as the atmosphere
[53:56] changes and as sovereign grace begins to
[53:58] lift the congregation into heavenly
[54:00] places and and and change the whole
[54:03] dynamic of every relationship you have
[54:05] because you're full of love and you're
[54:08] able to release that love. So I tell you
[54:10] now in the name of the Lord, fear not.
[54:13] Amen.
[54:13] Amen.
[54:14] Don't fear to love.
[54:15] Hallelujah.
[54:16] Don't fear to be a true friend like
[54:18] Jonathan and David.
[54:19] Amen. Amen.
[54:21] Hallelujah.
[54:22] Praise the Lord.
[54:22] Who knows the friendship of Jonathan and
[54:24] David? Is everyone familiar with what
[54:26] I'm talking about?
[54:27] The friendship of Jonathan and David.
[54:30] Hallelujah, mate. Powerful.
[54:34] We must. So while agape lover is agapeo
[54:37] love is expressed unconditional without
[54:39] caution or fear of consequence, we must
[54:42] never reserve, we must never hold back
[54:45] felio love with its conditional
[54:49] affection.
[54:51] But there must be an affection
[54:53] towards each other.
[54:56] Hallelujah. pure, healthy with its
[54:59] nurturing family connections,
[55:03] its much needed transparency,
[55:06] vulnerability
[55:07] and human fondness which is manifested
[55:12] on the human level.
[55:14] Amen.
[55:17] Prophet says this. He says, now I want
[55:18] to just, you know, this is quite
[55:20] powerful. He says, I just think that's
[55:22] the most grandest word, love. It's broke
[55:24] down in two different words. There's a
[55:26] love that's called fileo filio love.
[55:29] That's the love that we have one for
[55:31] another natural. And then there's a gapo
[55:34] love which comes from God. That's a
[55:36] godly respects in love. And I'm so glad
[55:39] to be here in this fellowship this
[55:41] afternoon or can I say this evening
[55:43] where both phases of love is operating
[55:46] fellowship one with another and the love
[55:48] of God shared abroad in our hearts by
[55:50] the Holy Ghost.
[55:52] Amen. Hallelujah.
[55:53] Amen. you know and defining the call of
[55:56] duty remember now I'm I'm speaking now
[55:59] the call of duty when it is just powered
[56:02] it can just it can actually be
[56:03] isolatedly powered by agapeo love here
[56:06] and so from that angle let me read it
[56:08] says here something that you must do
[56:11] this is the call of duty now who knows
[56:13] what I mean by the call of duty anyone's
[56:14] heard of that saying before
[56:16] amen the call of duty it's a it's a duty
[56:19] of a soldier it's a duty of a calling of
[56:21] an office amen it's something that you
[56:23] You know, it's it's what entails to be,
[56:25] let's say, a deacon or a or a teacher or
[56:28] whatever it may be and a missionary or a
[56:30] father or a brother or or someone some
[56:33] sort of leadership or any position,
[56:34] office or calling within that is a call
[56:37] of duty.
[56:37] Yeah.
[56:38] Within that is a parameters of what that
[56:40] is. Amen.
[56:42] Hallelujah.
[56:43] And you see, we can carry that out and
[56:45] be disconnected.
[56:47] But we don't want to be disconnected.
[56:48] Amen.
[56:48] Praise the Lord.
[56:49] Hallelujah. And we can be filled with
[56:51] the love of God.
[56:52] Amen. And it can be glorious, but yet
[56:55] there's more.
[56:57] God wants us to connect on a real human
[56:59] level as well,
[57:00] as a divine level.
[57:01] Amen.
[57:02] When we go up into our glorified bodies,
[57:04] it'll be different. It'll be far beyond
[57:06] anything we could ever imagine. But
[57:07] right now, right now, when we're dealing
[57:09] on a human level,
[57:10] hallelujah,
[57:11] we must condescend. Oh yes.
[57:12] Amen. It says in the Bible in Romans, it
[57:14] says condescend to men of lower state.
[57:17] Don't look from up here down.
[57:19] Lord,
[57:19] hallelujah.
[57:20] Amen. There must be a real love for
[57:22] those unloving.
[57:23] Amen.
[57:24] A real connection, a real love for them.
[57:27] Hallelujah. Don't look from way up, but
[57:29] come down.
[57:30] Y
[57:31] Amen.
[57:32] Praise the Lord.
[57:34] Call of duty is something that you must
[57:36] do or feel compelled to do. To do
[57:39] something that is morally right. The
[57:42] feeling that you must do something
[57:43] because it is your duty. A requirement
[57:46] or an expectation. to be steadfast and
[57:49] gallant as a soldier,
[57:52] a good steward powered by agapeo,
[57:55] taking responsibilities very seriously.
[57:59] Amen. This is all good things. I'm not
[58:00] putting this down. This is actually this
[58:02] is this is good stuff. Amen.
[58:04] Taking responsibilities very seriously.
[58:06] Ownership of office and duties.
[58:09] Diligently carrying out tasks expected.
[58:13] Sacrificing self and time to serve.
[58:17] Always at the post of duty.
[58:18] Yeah.
[58:19] Positive attitude and service anywhere.
[58:22] Amen.
[58:22] Anytime. Amen. A zealous soldier in the
[58:25] army.
[58:26] Hallelujah. Hello. Zealous soldiers in
[58:28] the army.
[58:29] Hallelujah. Reporting for service. Yes,
[58:31] sir. Amen. You know this is gallantry.
[58:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Regardless of
[58:37] circumstances.
[58:38] Hallelujah.
[58:39] Amen.
[58:39] Praise the Lord.
[58:40] Hallelujah. Because God, our captain, is
[58:42] always worthy. He never lets us down.
[58:45] And we serve him with absolute valor.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:48] Hallelujah.
[58:49] Hallelujah.
[58:49] Praise the Lord.
[58:52] Hallelujah. So now what is beyond this
[58:55] call of duty? What is the thought here?
[58:59] To go deeper than just living for others
[59:03] by daring to love with felio love which
[59:06] opens us up to vulnerability and
[59:08] emotional accountability
[59:11] to go beyond our duty of unconditional
[59:13] love. Just add human love and add
[59:16] expressed affection.
[59:18] Yeah.
[59:19] Amen.
[59:20] You know sometimes all our children need
[59:22] is affection. They don't want they don't
[59:25] they don't always need our towering
[59:28] leadership skills and our duty doing all
[59:31] the service for them and and and
[59:33] supplying all of their needs and being a
[59:35] great father and a gallant prayer
[59:37] warrior. But what they need is love.
[59:40] What they need is friendship. Amen.
[59:41] What they need is connection. What they
[59:43] need is for you to get down and start
[59:45] connecting with them as a friend.
[59:48] Hallelujah.
[59:49] Amen.
[59:49] That's what they need. Hallelujah.
[59:51] Amen.
[59:52] And all the rest. But that's very
[59:54] important. It's like the pilot. Why? How
[59:58] could they, you know, if if if they grow
[1:00:00] up and they're never connected to their
[1:00:01] daddy or their mommy because she's so
[1:00:04] caught up in the duty and the
[1:00:07] responsibility and you can get fearful
[1:00:10] of of breaking that tie.
[1:00:13] Yeah.
[1:00:13] To to your responsibility by actually
[1:00:16] becoming a friend to those because it
[1:00:18] takes time and it takes vulnerability
[1:00:21] and it takes effort.
[1:00:22] Yes. And it hurts when you get hurt
[1:00:25] big time.
[1:00:26] Jesus.
[1:00:27] But that love that I'm talking about is
[1:00:30] not alone.
[1:00:31] It's not alone, saints. It's it's it's
[1:00:33] it's enshrouded. It's brooded over with
[1:00:37] divine love.
[1:00:38] Amen.
[1:00:39] Amen. Just believe it.
[1:00:41] Amen.
[1:00:41] Believe it.
[1:00:43] Hallelujah. I believe there's healing
[1:00:45] for you tonight.
[1:00:46] Amen.
[1:00:46] If there's anyone here or hearing on
[1:00:48] this,
[1:00:49] there's healing. And for me,
[1:00:52] healing.
[1:00:52] Amen.
[1:00:53] To be able to love like that.
[1:00:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:55] To connect like that deeper than ever
[1:00:57] before.
[1:00:58] Hallelujah.
[1:00:59] To be able to open my heart and be a
[1:01:01] true friend.
[1:01:02] Hallelujah.
[1:01:02] To be able to connect and open up and be
[1:01:04] transparent and trust.
[1:01:06] Hallelujah.
[1:01:06] Hallelujah.
[1:01:08] Hallelujah.
[1:01:09] Amen.
[1:01:10] Hallelujah.
[1:01:10] Are we together?
[1:01:11] Amen.
[1:01:12] Amen.
[1:01:16] It means now what is beyond this call of
[1:01:19] duty.
[1:01:20] Now when I say beyond this I'm not this
[1:01:23] should be right. This should just be
[1:01:25] part of it.
[1:01:26] But I'm just bringing a thought out
[1:01:28] because sometimes we we we kind of pull
[1:01:30] back and we might be doing our service.
[1:01:33] We might be doing our duty. We might be
[1:01:34] a faithful and as all things but pulled
[1:01:36] back
[1:01:37] and that pilot of of of felio love
[1:01:40] should be right up here intertwined.
[1:01:42] Amen.
[1:01:43] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:01:44] Then the effect will be more stronger.
[1:01:47] Amen. And I'll read some quotes soon how
[1:01:49] the prophet talks about how important it
[1:01:51] is to feel and have sympathy and
[1:01:53] actually be connected to those you're
[1:01:55] praying for. And actually, he it
[1:01:57] actually is a channel of God's
[1:01:59] anointing. When you begin to enter into
[1:02:01] that burden and his anointing comes,
[1:02:03] who's been there?
[1:02:05] Who's been there?
[1:02:05] Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] When you just start and you enter into
[1:02:08] that and you become you just you can't
[1:02:10] you can't even stand. You just break
[1:02:12] down, right?
[1:02:13] Yeah.
[1:02:14] Because now the very burden is getting
[1:02:17] you're becoming part of that
[1:02:18] and that is real divine love and feel
[1:02:21] love starting to come together because
[1:02:22] now you're connect connecting with them
[1:02:24] on an emotional level as well.
[1:02:27] Amen. Remember any religion without
[1:02:29] emotion is what
[1:02:31] is dead.
[1:02:32] We can't just have a big ceremonious
[1:02:35] religious message. Amen.
[1:02:36] Amen.
[1:02:37] It's got to have some real God with skin
[1:02:39] on. Amen.
[1:02:40] Hallelujah. real human love as well.
[1:02:42] Let's not cast that down. You know, I I
[1:02:45] don't know. I mean, you know, sometimes
[1:02:46] we forget about it and we think it's not
[1:02:48] important, but it is because because it
[1:02:51] now, you know, now more than ever, it's
[1:02:53] shown to me how important this love is.
[1:02:55] Yes, my Lord.
[1:02:55] I never knew God loved with this love,
[1:02:57] but now I do. And now that I know that
[1:02:58] he loves with this love, then I'm going
[1:03:00] to love with this love even more than
[1:03:01] ever.
[1:03:02] And make an effort. Hallelujah. And say,
[1:03:05] Lord, heal me if there's any
[1:03:06] restrictions in my life. And that should
[1:03:09] be your prayer tonight.
[1:03:10] I challenge you
[1:03:12] to pray
[1:03:13] and say, "Lord, heal me so that I can
[1:03:16] love like this."
[1:03:17] Hallelujah.
[1:03:17] Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] Amen. I believe it'll revolutionize your
[1:03:21] walk, your prayer life, your your your
[1:03:22] your connection with God cuz if you you
[1:03:26] know and this is just coming now but if
[1:03:27] you if you can pray that for the people
[1:03:30] but then when you begin to love God like
[1:03:32] that
[1:03:33] you know
[1:03:34] he says if you don't love me Felio more
[1:03:37] than your father mother son or daughter
[1:03:40] then you're not even worthy of me and so
[1:03:42] there's got to be if and if you're
[1:03:44] struggling to love with Felio because of
[1:03:46] emotional hurt or something you've
[1:03:48] carried cuz under his conditions, then
[1:03:50] be healed of that.
[1:03:52] That your spirit be healed so that you
[1:03:53] can love God more. Who wants to love God
[1:03:55] more?
[1:03:56] Amen. That's one of my biggest prayers
[1:03:59] in my life is that I would love him
[1:04:00] more.
[1:04:01] Hallelujah.
[1:04:02] And I prayed, Lord, let me love you with
[1:04:04] all the loves there is. Amen.
[1:04:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Why not? Amen. Stop
[1:04:09] loving all the things of the world and
[1:04:11] start loving God before everything.
[1:04:13] Amen. or my mind or my strength or my
[1:04:15] spirit or my soul or whatever else is
[1:04:18] me.
[1:04:18] Amen.
[1:04:18] Then all of it love him. Amen.
[1:04:21] Oh yes.
[1:04:22] Oh glory.
[1:04:24] That's it.
[1:04:25] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:04:28] Even you know he's still worthy.
[1:04:30] Amen. Regardless of the situations or
[1:04:32] the circumstances.
[1:04:35] Thank you.
[1:04:36] Glory to God.
[1:04:38] It means to go beyond the camp of our
[1:04:42] own culture,
[1:04:43] our hang-ups, our own ways to love and
[1:04:49] personally connect with the people that
[1:04:51] we are living with and fellowshipping
[1:04:53] with and that we're caring for, that
[1:04:56] we're parenting, that we're leading,
[1:04:59] teaching, and praying for. Hallelujah.
[1:05:03] The reason that sounds so good is
[1:05:04] because I wrote it all down. Amen. You
[1:05:07] know me.
[1:05:07] [Laughter]
[1:05:09] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:05:10] Hallelujah.
[1:05:11] I believe I was led to do that. So, it
[1:05:13] was so clear.
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:14] And and I just pray that that would be
[1:05:16] your portion. That's why I said at the
[1:05:18] start, if you want this, just take it.
[1:05:20] Hallelujah.
[1:05:21] Just take it. I believe God gave that to
[1:05:23] us.
[1:05:23] Amen.
[1:05:24] I'm nothing. But I just prayed, Lord,
[1:05:26] give me a give me if you want me to
[1:05:27] preach something else cuz I was going to
[1:05:29] preach on the power of the tree of life
[1:05:31] and the weakness of the tree of
[1:05:32] knowledge. And then I but I I just felt
[1:05:35] impressed just stopped that which I'd
[1:05:37] studied for weeks and pray Lord is there
[1:05:39] anything else? Is there something else
[1:05:41] you want me to preach on? And that came
[1:05:43] and so this is what's come.
[1:05:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:45] Hallelujah.
[1:05:45] So don't take it from me. Just receive
[1:05:47] it as a gift to you.
[1:05:49] Amen.
[1:05:50] Go beyond the call of duty.
[1:05:52] Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] Amen.
[1:05:54] This is what it means. Beyond the call
[1:05:56] of duty. This is what it means. It means
[1:05:57] condescension.
[1:05:59] Amen. To condescend a men of lower
[1:06:01] state. to come down to where your
[1:06:04] children are at. To come down to where
[1:06:06] the drunkard is at, to come down to
[1:06:08] where the diseased is at. This is where
[1:06:11] that reckless that reckless felio love
[1:06:14] comes. And you look at Jesus when he's
[1:06:16] walking the earth and he just he would
[1:06:19] go up to these like infested people that
[1:06:22] everyone was like, "Stay away."
[1:06:25] And he would just walk up and he would
[1:06:27] put his arms around them.
[1:06:28] If that ain't reckless feel love, I
[1:06:30] don't know what is. He didn't care of
[1:06:32] the consequences.
[1:06:33] Yeah.
[1:06:34] Because he knew that divine love was
[1:06:35] with him. And no matter what, he didn't
[1:06:37] care about no diseases. He was over
[1:06:39] that. He was above the disease. He was
[1:06:41] above sickness. And he cared for those
[1:06:43] that no one would want to touch.
[1:06:45] Amen. Condescend. And now when I say
[1:06:48] condescend, it's not a negative
[1:06:50] condescending. That's a proud
[1:06:51] condescending. I'm talking about a
[1:06:53] humble. you know that if you're in a
[1:06:56] good place or you're strong in
[1:06:57] something, don't come and tower over to
[1:07:00] try and help somebody. Don't even tell
[1:07:02] them that you're good at it. Don't even
[1:07:04] let you know a real true character is
[1:07:06] that person will think that feel like
[1:07:08] they're equal. That's
[1:07:09] right.
[1:07:10] No matter how low they are,
[1:07:11] no matter how decrepit, how dark they've
[1:07:15] gotten into, doesn't matter that they
[1:07:17] would always feel equal.
[1:07:19] Amen. And I believe that that is where
[1:07:22] God wants us to be. Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] Amen.
[1:07:24] Unafraid.
[1:07:26] Reckless in the positive sense now.
[1:07:29] I mean, it took me a while to try and
[1:07:31] get my head around that.
[1:07:32] But I was like, "Wow, this is powerful."
[1:07:36] I know that guy um Tony or Asbury or
[1:07:38] whatever his name is, he wrote that song
[1:07:40] and he's he's actually suffered a lot of
[1:07:42] flack for that song. There's a lot of
[1:07:43] stuff going out against that and a
[1:07:45] forward and everything. It caused a lot
[1:07:47] of stir because of that word reckless
[1:07:49] love. And they're judging him because
[1:07:52] they're seeing they're looking at the
[1:07:53] divine love of God, but not realizing
[1:07:56] that God actually has a felio love too.
[1:07:59] Amen. And God made was made a man. He
[1:08:01] condescended down and he became a man so
[1:08:04] that so that this divine love could
[1:08:06] become felio and and we could touch him
[1:08:08] and we could connect with God.
[1:08:11] Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:13] Amen.
[1:08:13] And glory.
[1:08:15] My We're running out of time.
[1:08:17] Amen.
[1:08:19] It also means vulnerability,
[1:08:22] connection, deep friendship like
[1:08:25] Jonathan and David. Transparency.
[1:08:28] Who wants to be transparent, you know?
[1:08:30] Amen. You don't want to be ashamed of
[1:08:32] who you really are.
[1:08:33] If anyone in here or on that tape is
[1:08:36] ashamed of who you really are and you
[1:08:38] put on something in front of everybody,
[1:08:41] the altar is open.
[1:08:42] Amen.
[1:08:43] The altar is open.
[1:08:44] You don't have to come here. It's right
[1:08:46] here.
[1:08:47] The altar is open. Amen.
[1:08:49] If you're ashamed of who you really are
[1:08:50] and you can't be yourself because you
[1:08:53] see there's healing. And when you really
[1:08:55] when the love of God comes and it
[1:08:57] neutralizes all fear and you realize,
[1:08:59] you know what? I've got nothing to be
[1:09:00] afraid of and I've got nothing to be
[1:09:02] ashamed of Jesus.
[1:09:03] The real me is ready to be revealed.
[1:09:05] And I'm going to get down and I'm going
[1:09:07] to say, Lord, I want the real me to be
[1:09:09] lovely. Oh God, let let the real me love
[1:09:12] like you.
[1:09:13] Hallelujah.
[1:09:14] Unblock all the channels.
[1:09:16] Amen. heal all the the the broken
[1:09:19] pieces.
[1:09:20] Amen.
[1:09:20] Right now, he says, "Fall on the rock
[1:09:23] and you shall be broken."
[1:09:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:25] And then he will build your life.
[1:09:27] Amen.
[1:09:28] Amen.
[1:09:28] Don't let the rock fall on you.
[1:09:31] That's judgment.
[1:09:32] But there is an opportunity
[1:09:35] for us as a believer or as a son or
[1:09:38] daughter of God. He's calling the people
[1:09:41] fall on the rock.
[1:09:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] Fall on him and let him break you down
[1:09:47] and rebuild you.
[1:09:49] Don't come to him and try and build
[1:09:51] yourself and have a big coalition
[1:09:52] government with him. It doesn't work. It
[1:09:54] will never ever ever ever work. You'll
[1:09:56] never get anywhere. It has to be a
[1:09:57] complete surrender and a complete
[1:09:59] falling on the rock. Otherwise, it will
[1:10:01] never work.
[1:10:04] It will never work because we don't
[1:10:05] know. We know nothing.
[1:10:08] We absolutely know nothing in the in the
[1:10:10] sight of God. our good works, everything
[1:10:12] is up but filthy rags.
[1:10:14] That's it.
[1:10:15] He says, "My thoughts are higher than
[1:10:16] your thoughts. My ways are higher."
[1:10:18] Amen.
[1:10:19] And he never said you can't have them.
[1:10:20] He just said they're way higher before
[1:10:23] you get the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:24] Amen. But then when you start to when
[1:10:26] you get the Holy Ghost, then he begins
[1:10:27] to give you the mind of Christ.
[1:10:29] Amen.
[1:10:30] Wonderful.
[1:10:31] Hallelujah.
[1:10:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:32] Start downloading the real thoughts and
[1:10:34] you start thinking like him and you
[1:10:36] start judging like him. Amen. Yeah.
[1:10:39] When I say judging, I mean discernment,
[1:10:41] not condemnation.
[1:10:43] Hallelujah.
[1:10:45] Deep friendship, transparency, empathy.
[1:10:47] Oh my, that's a big word. Empathy.
[1:10:50] Hallelujah. Feeling for the others,
[1:10:52] entering into their burden,
[1:10:56] fearless of consequence.
[1:10:58] Agape love, you know, I put this here.
[1:11:01] Agape love is easier to give be because
[1:11:04] there is no hurt from rejection or
[1:11:07] abuse.
[1:11:09] Hallelujah.
[1:11:10] In one John 4, it says, "There is no
[1:11:11] fear in love, but perfect love cast out
[1:11:14] fear."
[1:11:16] Because fear has torment, but he that
[1:11:18] feareth is not made perfect in love. But
[1:11:22] let me tell you, the opportunity is here
[1:11:26] for you to be made perfect in love.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:29] And for him to drive out the fear.
[1:11:31] Amen.
[1:11:31] To loose the restrictions,
[1:11:33] to loose the grave clothes of your old
[1:11:35] nature.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah. so that you can walk free as
[1:11:38] a resurrected believer now.
[1:11:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:40] Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] Amen.
[1:11:41] Amen.
[1:11:42] Amen.
[1:11:42] Glory.
[1:11:45] Beyond the call of duty
[1:11:48] is to open to is open to be open to
[1:11:50] communicate true feelings. Amen.
[1:11:54] Not be ashamed.
[1:11:55] Honesty and transparency.
[1:11:58] Stop letting the past hurts dictate the
[1:12:00] criteria for your connection to other
[1:12:02] people.
[1:12:03] You know, this is a big thing for us.
[1:12:06] We've been all been hurt by things and
[1:12:08] people in the past,
[1:12:10] whether it's pre-Christian days or in
[1:12:11] the Christian church, whatever it may
[1:12:13] be, in the different seasons of your
[1:12:14] life,
[1:12:15] but never let that be a criteria.
[1:12:18] You should always be daring.
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:21] Yes, sir.
[1:12:21] To let your heart go to people.
[1:12:23] My Jesus.
[1:12:24] Help us, Father.
[1:12:26] If you go through suffering for it, it's
[1:12:27] for your own good.
[1:12:29] God will bring you forth.
[1:12:30] Amen.
[1:12:31] He will develop character in your life.
[1:12:33] It's necessary. Don't reserve your
[1:12:36] heart. Amen.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah.
[1:12:39] Amen.
[1:12:40] Glory to God in the highest.
[1:12:43] Felio love can be reckless. This is
[1:12:45] where that moment came in. Felio love
[1:12:47] can be daring even if adversity is
[1:12:51] certain. Do not be afraid to love,
[1:12:53] saints. Don't be afraid to be friendly.
[1:12:57] Don't be afraid to let your heart
[1:13:00] go to the people.
[1:13:02] Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] Amen.
[1:13:04] take up your cross.
[1:13:06] Amen. A cross is not a is is is not
[1:13:09] painless. A cross carries pain.
[1:13:12] Hallelujah.
[1:13:12] Amen.
[1:13:13] He says that we should be found in the
[1:13:14] likeness of his resurrection and in the
[1:13:17] likeness of his
[1:13:20] anyone know suffering.
[1:13:23] That's part of it. But are you willing?
[1:13:26] I believe I'm looking at people that are
[1:13:28] willing.
[1:13:29] Are you willing?
[1:13:30] Amen.
[1:13:31] Amen, Lord.
[1:13:32] Oh, man. the honor of it all.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:36] However, you know, brother Gary Walker,
[1:13:37] he he was going through his accident,
[1:13:40] who knows the story, and he was coming
[1:13:42] through the hospital and he was very
[1:13:45] angry and upset. And it came to a point
[1:13:48] where he was now really upset and he was
[1:13:50] upset that the Lord had allowed him to
[1:13:52] go through this. And then the Lord spoke
[1:13:53] to him and said, "If you only knew the
[1:13:56] bigger picture, you would have opted for
[1:13:58] this."
[1:13:59] And it broke him down and it changed
[1:14:01] everything and it changed his perception
[1:14:03] because
[1:14:04] there's a bigger picture.
[1:14:06] Amen. If we only knew the bigger
[1:14:08] picture. And I believe the Lord can
[1:14:09] begin to show us.
[1:14:13] If we allow him to do it so we can die
[1:14:15] to our own limits and estrangements, die
[1:14:17] to our complexes and truly express human
[1:14:20] love again.
[1:14:21] Amen.
[1:14:21] Amen.
[1:14:22] Just start now. Start now.
[1:14:26] Ye that has been hurt, start. Just love,
[1:14:29] release it and trust God. Amen.
[1:14:32] Give up your rights to a narrow comfort
[1:14:34] zone.
[1:14:36] Amen.
[1:14:37] Yeah.
[1:14:38] You know, we like to get in. Someone
[1:14:40] preached on this. Might have been at the
[1:14:41] Easter camp, but I thought it was very
[1:14:43] great. They said, you know, as you get
[1:14:46] older, your comfort zone gets smaller
[1:14:48] and smaller and smaller and smaller and
[1:14:50] smaller. And some people end up in their
[1:14:51] house and they don't want to go
[1:14:52] anywhere. and their comfort and if you
[1:14:54] get and and anytime you antagonize or
[1:14:57] aggravate that they're grumpy and become
[1:14:59] crabbed.
[1:15:00] Amen. But I I just challenge you. Don't
[1:15:03] let your comfort zone implode.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:07] Let the borders of your comfort zone be
[1:15:09] extended.
[1:15:10] Hallelujah.
[1:15:11] Amen.
[1:15:11] And God will give you grace.
[1:15:13] Hallelujah.
[1:15:14] Amen.
[1:15:15] Step outside of it. Yes, it's
[1:15:16] uncomfortable, but just keep going. It
[1:15:18] will become familiar to you.
[1:15:20] Amen. And you will realize that there's
[1:15:21] a blessing
[1:15:23] in releasing your heart.
[1:15:25] There's a blessing in expressing love.
[1:15:27] Amen.
[1:15:27] Using hospitality. Sorry my if I'm
[1:15:30] shouting, but man, it's just exciting.
[1:15:31] Amen.
[1:15:32] This is this is real, saints. This is
[1:15:34] real.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:36] Amen.
[1:15:39] Amen. Give up your rights to an easy
[1:15:42] emotional experience because it's not
[1:15:44] going to be that.
[1:15:46] But you can hold that. You know that you
[1:15:48] can reserve your life. You can be
[1:15:49] reserved and you can hold it all back
[1:15:51] and have an easy emotional experience or
[1:15:54] you can get prayed for and you can be
[1:15:56] healed and you can be free and God can
[1:15:58] use you in a mighty way. 30, 60, 100. I
[1:16:02] go for 100fold. Who here wants 100fold
[1:16:04] fruit in their life?
[1:16:06] Hallelujah. You want 100fold?
[1:16:08] Yes, sir.
[1:16:09] Amen. Lord,
[1:16:10] that's what it's going to take. It's
[1:16:11] going to take some character
[1:16:12] development. That's going to take some
[1:16:14] fe fearlessness. It's going to take some
[1:16:16] bravery. I believe I'm looking at brave
[1:16:18] people today.
[1:16:19] People that are brave enough to love
[1:16:22] people that are brave enough to connect
[1:16:23] with the the brethren and connect with
[1:16:25] the unloly
[1:16:26] and put your heart there
[1:16:28] and and and come down and and and be
[1:16:30] part of it
[1:16:31] and share their burden. Hallelujah.
[1:16:34] Amen.
[1:16:35] Amen. Human love is a pilot flame and a
[1:16:37] bedding ground for the balance of divine
[1:16:40] love. The two go hand in hand.
[1:16:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:44] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's go beyond the
[1:16:46] call of duty, saints. Amen.
[1:16:48] Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] Romans 12:9 says, "Let love be without
[1:16:51] hypocrisy or dissimulation."
[1:16:54] Amen. That's what it says in the old in
[1:16:56] the King James, dissimulation, which is
[1:16:59] to not simulate it correctly.
[1:17:00] Dissimulation.
[1:17:02] Amen. So, you know, you can put on a
[1:17:04] love, you can put on this great pious
[1:17:06] act and be so loving in the church, but
[1:17:08] really you're thinking that you don't
[1:17:09] even like that person.
[1:17:11] That's bad.
[1:17:12] Real bad. And the reason you don't like
[1:17:14] them is cuz you're scared.
[1:17:16] Fear.
[1:17:18] Scared to love people.
[1:17:19] Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] Amen. But that divine love that comes in
[1:17:23] behind, all you need if you're like that
[1:17:26] is a love feast.
[1:17:27] Amen. Yes, Lord.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah. If there's anyone like that
[1:17:30] tonight or anyone that'll ever hear
[1:17:32] this, if you are like that, then just
[1:17:35] kneel down right now and just say,
[1:17:37] "Lord, I want a love feast.
[1:17:40] I'm sick of being critical. I'm sick of
[1:17:42] having critical thoughts. I'm sick of
[1:17:44] being negative. I'm sick of having
[1:17:46] resentment.
[1:17:48] I'm sick of unforgiveness.
[1:17:49] Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] I'm sick of holding grudges.
[1:17:52] I just need to be free. I want to love
[1:17:54] again.
[1:17:55] Yes, sir.
[1:17:56] I want to come back to my first love.
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:17:58] Do you know that first love is agape?
[1:18:01] God is saying come back to agape.
[1:18:04] Oh, don't even leave it.
[1:18:06] That's our That's our portion. Who
[1:18:07] believes? If you're going to grab
[1:18:08] something, grab that. Say, I'm grabbing
[1:18:10] my agape. my first love.
[1:18:12] Amen.
[1:18:13] I'm going to have a feast and it's never
[1:18:14] going to run dry.
[1:18:15] Lord,
[1:18:16] hallelujah.
[1:18:17] That's the shikina presence. Amen. You
[1:18:19] put something in the shikina of
[1:18:20] presence, it always comes back to its
[1:18:22] original nature.
[1:18:23] Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] You put a dead stick in there that had
[1:18:24] been a judgment stick, a judgment rod
[1:18:26] for the world. Hallelujah. You put that
[1:18:28] in the shikina present, it turned back
[1:18:29] into a tree.
[1:18:31] Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] It turned back to its original nature.
[1:18:34] I love that. It's one of the most
[1:18:36] powerful things.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] Oh my Jesus.
[1:18:38] Why did it do it,
[1:18:40] Lord? Why? Because it was a tree to
[1:18:43] begin with.
[1:18:44] And whatever you were to begin with, you
[1:18:47] just you just get a love feast.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] You just get a love feast.
[1:18:53] Take it. Grip that.
[1:18:56] Lay hold of your love feast tonight.
[1:18:58] Amen.
[1:18:59] Oh, it just covers a multitude of sin.
[1:19:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:02] Amen.
[1:19:03] Amen.
[1:19:03] Amen.
[1:19:04] Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus.
[1:19:06] Oh my.
[1:19:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:09] Hallelujah. Be kindly affectionate one
[1:19:12] to another with brotherly love and honor
[1:19:14] preferring one another. Kindly affection
[1:19:17] is the love of family blood relation.
[1:19:20] But he's saying now he wants us to love
[1:19:23] each other like that.
[1:19:25] And even more because he says now love
[1:19:27] each other like that but also love each
[1:19:29] other with a god they love.
[1:19:30] Amen.
[1:19:32] So let there be a feast in this place.
[1:19:34] Call for it. Amen. Who's calling for a
[1:19:37] feast?
[1:19:38] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:39] I'm calling for a feast tonight.
[1:19:41] Hallelujah.
[1:19:41] I'm calling for a feast in my life, but
[1:19:43] I'm going to call for a feast over each
[1:19:44] one.
[1:19:45] Amen.
[1:19:45] Amen. So, we're going to pray in a in a
[1:19:47] very short while. Amen.
[1:19:50] Now, please forgive me, Brahman, but I'm
[1:19:53] going to share a little story.
[1:19:56] Christine's been through many stories
[1:19:57] that Ben's told, so I'm going to tell
[1:19:58] one.
[1:20:01] Amen. No, it's a good story. It's a very
[1:20:03] good story. So um before we got married,
[1:20:05] this is the story where so um
[1:20:09] I might I I hope I tell this right.
[1:20:13] So now we're talking about being scared
[1:20:15] to love. So Brahman was in Africa. Well,
[1:20:18] see Brahman's been through a certain
[1:20:20] life um where certain circumstances in
[1:20:24] her life brought her to a place where
[1:20:26] she was scared to release her heart and
[1:20:28] love and to be married ever. So, she was
[1:20:32] ready to be a missionary and go through
[1:20:34] Africa and be a a missionary and a and a
[1:20:36] midwife over there forever and never be
[1:20:39] married. And yet, while she was there,
[1:20:42] God was waking her up in the night to
[1:20:43] pray for her future husband and all
[1:20:45] these things. And so, somehow there was
[1:20:47] a different plan. Amen. Here we are. But
[1:20:51] praise the Lord.
[1:20:52] So, we we I we had an interchurch Bible
[1:20:54] study. I think we talked about this at
[1:20:56] the 10 year anniversary, but we had an
[1:20:57] interchurch Bible study. And um this was
[1:21:00] before that there was any pastors or
[1:21:01] anything in Wellington and like so you
[1:21:05] know we just did our own thing and we
[1:21:07] just went out there and we just went
[1:21:08] around and all the different churches
[1:21:10] and whatever and just had Bible studies
[1:21:12] and you know and then so Bronin ended up
[1:21:15] invited to this group and and then we
[1:21:17] got to know each other and then one day
[1:21:19] you know lo and behold she had
[1:21:21] affections towards me and she was not
[1:21:24] very happy about these affections. She
[1:21:26] was very upset because the past hurts
[1:21:29] would become stirred up and now um so
[1:21:33] she's now praying now and this is what I
[1:21:34] believe we we need to do right this is
[1:21:38] you may be anxious at the thought of
[1:21:41] really loving and really connecting and
[1:21:43] Brahman was having a real a a time she
[1:21:46] was having a spell amen of of of anxiety
[1:21:50] and panic cuz now she feels like oh my
[1:21:53] okay this has got to be okay Lord just
[1:21:55] give me a yes or a no.
[1:21:57] That's it.
[1:21:57] You know, give me a yes or a no. And and
[1:22:00] so and and if it was yes, then and it
[1:22:02] failed, then she'd blame the Lord. But
[1:22:04] if she said no, then she's free. So she
[1:22:08] prays and she prays and she cries and
[1:22:10] she does her thing and really enters in.
[1:22:12] And then God takes her into a vision or
[1:22:14] uh in her, you know, whatever you want
[1:22:16] to call it. And here is two young
[1:22:19] children
[1:22:21] hand in hand with Jesus in the middle
[1:22:23] and they're doing ring a rosie in the
[1:22:25] vision. And she and she knew that each
[1:22:28] of the children was me and her and Jesus
[1:22:31] was in the middle. And she was like,
[1:22:32] "Ah, great. It's a no. It's a no because
[1:22:35] Jesus is in the middle. We're just to be
[1:22:37] friends." And then Jesus says this and I
[1:22:40] believe that we can apply this to our
[1:22:42] own life
[1:22:43] forever in marriage any relationship now
[1:22:45] so that you don't have to fear anymore.
[1:22:47] Okay? He says if you keep me central you
[1:22:50] will always be connected.
[1:22:53] If you keep me central
[1:22:55] you will always be connected. So if you
[1:22:58] can love with felio love and let agape
[1:23:01] be central you will always be connected.
[1:23:04] Hallelujah. It will sustain you in the
[1:23:06] ups and downs. It will sustain you when
[1:23:08] you're rejected and your feedio love is
[1:23:10] challenged and the conditions are
[1:23:12] challenged.
[1:23:12] Oh blessed father,
[1:23:14] he will sustain you through the thick
[1:23:16] and thin, through the storms, through
[1:23:18] all the variables of life.
[1:23:20] Hallelujah.
[1:23:21] When you're completely betrayed, broken
[1:23:24] by people, whatever it may be, that
[1:23:26] agape love will keep you constant and it
[1:23:29] will never fail.
[1:23:30] Jesus.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah. And so then the two children
[1:23:34] and Jesus went walking off into the
[1:23:36] future.
[1:23:37] Amen. And she came out and that was the
[1:23:39] end. We were she in her eyes we were
[1:23:42] already married. It's ready to go. I
[1:23:44] thought, man, I'd just gone to go get a
[1:23:46] Christian DVD. We're going to go watch a
[1:23:47] DVD, you know. And we all came back and
[1:23:50] my it was all on, wasn't it, honey?
[1:23:55] Beautiful.
[1:23:55] It was all on. She was like in her mind,
[1:23:57] we're going to get married. My I didn't
[1:23:59] know. Oh, man. But praise the Lord. But
[1:24:02] what the Lord did and I believe it's a
[1:24:04] word in season for us tonight as well is
[1:24:07] that if you keep him central, you will
[1:24:10] always be connected and your
[1:24:11] relationship will always be un it'll
[1:24:14] it'll it'll be uh what's the word?
[1:24:16] Bound, not bound, but like gilded and
[1:24:18] and bolstered by the unfailing God.
[1:24:21] Amen. You know Isaac's song, he says, "I
[1:24:23] may fail, but in me is the unfailing
[1:24:25] God."
[1:24:25] Yes, sir.
[1:24:26] Amen. Who's glad for the unfailing God?
[1:24:29] Amen. Can we have the musicians, please?
[1:24:31] Um, and then we will, um,
[1:24:34] bless.
[1:24:34] We'll just sing a song maybe or whatever
[1:24:36] and then we'll just pray. Amen.
[1:24:38] Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:40] Amen. And amen. And amen.
[1:24:41] Amen.
[1:24:42] Hallelujah. You know, in G, do you know
[1:24:44] Jes I'm just going to just while the
[1:24:45] musicians are getting ready, I'll just
[1:24:46] read a couple of quotes here. But you
[1:24:48] know, in John 11, um, this is an amazing
[1:24:51] thing that happened here when Jesus came
[1:24:53] to his the disciple came to Lazarus and
[1:24:56] came to Bethany. And Martha actually
[1:24:58] says to Jesus, she says, "Lord, behold
[1:25:01] him whom you love, Filelio, is sick."
[1:25:06] And then Jesus, when Jesus heard that,
[1:25:08] he said, "This sickness is not unto
[1:25:09] death, but for the glory of God, that
[1:25:11] the son of God might be glorified
[1:25:12] thereby." Now in verse 5, John 11:5, it
[1:25:16] says, "Now Jesus loved agape love
[1:25:18] Martha, Mary, and her Martha and her
[1:25:21] sister and Lazarus." So here you have
[1:25:23] now in the same passage of scripture the
[1:25:26] testimony of a of a fileo love and
[1:25:28] agapeo love coming together. Then
[1:25:31] through that love becomes a voice of the
[1:25:34] resurrection. And so I want to bring
[1:25:35] your attention to this love, this
[1:25:38] connection, this atmosphere, this
[1:25:40] projection of divine love and the felio
[1:25:43] love that we have for each other and the
[1:25:45] daring nature to be able to connect
[1:25:49] will bring forth the power of the
[1:25:51] resurrection in our lives. It will bring
[1:25:53] forth an atmosphere where grace can take
[1:25:55] over and can change people's lives.
[1:25:58] Amen.
[1:25:58] Hallelujah. Can take people. This is why
[1:26:00] the prophet said when he was praying for
[1:26:02] people, you must love them. must connect
[1:26:04] to them because he says without love
[1:26:07] healing. How can you do it?
[1:26:09] I'll read a quote. Can we play um Oh
[1:26:12] love of God, how rich and pure. Nice and
[1:26:14] slow in 44, please. Amen. It says here,
[1:26:18] I think it's in D
[1:26:20] in D or G.
[1:26:23] It says here, the prophet says this, and
[1:26:25] I'll just read this quote and then we'll
[1:26:26] finish. Amen. We'll get into prayer.
[1:26:28] Sorry, I've taken a little bit long. uh
[1:26:30] love and prayer, genuine love is the
[1:26:32] perfect motive for self-sacrifice. It
[1:26:34] says here now, now brother Brandham,
[1:26:35] he's in he's in a healing service,
[1:26:37] healing meetings, and he says, "Ask my
[1:26:38] brethren that's with me this week. I've
[1:26:40] eaten nothing but crackers of milk."
[1:26:43] That's true. Fasting, waiting, seeing
[1:26:45] which way the spirit will lead me. The
[1:26:47] boys at the door said, "There's a big
[1:26:49] smoker board down there, Brother
[1:26:50] Brandham. How you love to go to a
[1:26:53] smoker's board, man. I'd probably fall
[1:26:56] right there." But he didn't. And I
[1:26:58] believe that it was there was a love.
[1:27:00] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:01] I said I do not I I do I do love smokers
[1:27:04] more but not in healing services. You
[1:27:07] wait on the Lord. This comes out only by
[1:27:10] fasting and praying. Here comes tomorrow
[1:27:12] night when cripples and hospital cases
[1:27:15] and dying people will be sitting there.
[1:27:17] Be ready for it. Here it is. You love
[1:27:20] people.
[1:27:22] This is the motive. Not I want to be a
[1:27:24] big shot and want to be seen as this big
[1:27:26] healer. No. He genuinely truly loved
[1:27:30] people.
[1:27:30] Yes, sir.
[1:27:31] This motivated him to sacrifice his own
[1:27:34] pleasures of food
[1:27:37] so that he could be in a place where God
[1:27:39] could use him to heal and raise the
[1:27:42] dead, heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
[1:27:44] whatever. And I just pray, Lord, make me
[1:27:47] willing and full of love like that where
[1:27:49] I'm willing to sacrifice my own creature
[1:27:52] comforts.
[1:27:52] Hallelujah.
[1:27:53] My own food. Now, I'm not saying I'm not
[1:27:55] advocating you go become pastors all the
[1:27:57] time and everything like that, but I'm
[1:27:58] talking now. Let this love be driven by
[1:28:03] love.
[1:28:03] Hallelujah.
[1:28:04] Amen.
[1:28:04] Amen.
[1:28:05] I'll just keep reading this quote. It
[1:28:07] gets more powerful. And if you don't
[1:28:08] love people, you might as well get out
[1:28:10] of the ministry. That's all. Because if
[1:28:12] your heart don't burn for them, and I
[1:28:16] was very challenged by this. I said,
[1:28:17] "Lord, I need to be like that. Yeah,
[1:28:20] I need to have such a love for people
[1:28:22] that it burns for them.
[1:28:23] And if it's burning, it's not just a
[1:28:25] spiritual lofty love somewhere up in the
[1:28:27] sky. It's not, as brother Ben say, not
[1:28:29] pie in the sky. This is pie in my heart.
[1:28:31] Amen.
[1:28:32] Amen.
[1:28:32] Amen.
[1:28:33] This is reality now. This is rubber on
[1:28:36] the road. Love, true love that burns
[1:28:39] for my brothers and sisters. And I want
[1:28:42] to give you something. If you begin to
[1:28:43] pray for people and you just start
[1:28:45] praying for everyone, you just pray for
[1:28:47] people and you just with all your heart
[1:28:49] and don't rush it. Don't be in a hurry.
[1:28:51] You'll begin to connect with people and
[1:28:52] love them. Becomes personal cuz you know
[1:28:55] you're investing your heart and life
[1:28:56] into them and God begins to give you a
[1:28:58] love for them. Hallelujah. So I
[1:29:00] encourage you if you want to grow in
[1:29:02] love, just start sacrificing your time
[1:29:04] and praying for people
[1:29:06] and you will develop a love for them and
[1:29:08] a connection to them. And he says here,
[1:29:10] "If we can't love one another, how are
[1:29:12] we going to love God whom we haven't
[1:29:14] seen?" See, we must find the vein.
[1:29:17] Hallelujah. The vein is where the life
[1:29:19] runs through. Amen. Who believes that?
[1:29:21] Amen. We've got to love one another,
[1:29:24] though we different. Hello, difference.
[1:29:26] We all got different personalities.
[1:29:28] We've all got different natures. We've
[1:29:29] all got different family traits that may
[1:29:31] annoy each other. But let's see. But,
[1:29:34] but you're going to love anyhow.
[1:29:36] Amen.
[1:29:37] Amen. And I, like I said, I'll go back
[1:29:39] to the love feast. If you get a love
[1:29:40] feast, it doesn't matter anyway.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] You just get so full of joy.
[1:29:45] It's unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:48] Hallelujah.
[1:29:49] You can't bluff it. You've got to really
[1:29:51] do it. You got to Amen. Okay. So, when
[1:29:56] sometimes there's options, right?
[1:29:58] But now there is no option. I'm not
[1:30:01] leaving you an option. Now you have to
[1:30:04] love.
[1:30:05] Amen. There's lots of options in your
[1:30:07] walk. You can ch choose paths. God
[1:30:09] doesn't force you to do anything. He
[1:30:12] won't even force you to do this. You do
[1:30:13] have an option if you want. But if you
[1:30:15] really want to succeed, you really want
[1:30:17] to be connected, you really want to
[1:30:19] grow, then love.
[1:30:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:23] Are you brave? Who's brave here? Amen.
[1:30:27] And that the greatest power I found in
[1:30:29] healing is love.
[1:30:32] When you have sympathy and love for the
[1:30:34] people trying to help them.
[1:30:39] Amen.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] Love conquers anything. Let's stand.
[1:30:43] Where there's tongues, they shall cease.
[1:30:45] Where there's prophecies, it shall
[1:30:47] vanish. But when love comes, it conquers
[1:30:49] everything.
[1:30:50] God so loved the world. There's where
[1:30:53] you're failing. Friends, don't practice
[1:30:55] so much of whether you've got gifts or
[1:30:57] not, but practice that one real gift of
[1:30:59] love. Then you'd be better. Amen.
[1:31:04] Let's just pray.
[1:31:09] I'm just going to pray the prayer and
[1:31:11] then we'll go to actual group prayer
[1:31:13] after we sing this song. Okay. So, but I
[1:31:15] just want to do a little bit of an altar
[1:31:17] call here, but I'm not calling you to
[1:31:19] the front because we've got the prayer
[1:31:21] meeting, but right where you're at. And
[1:31:25] if anyone's on that tape there,
[1:31:28] if something has triggered in your heart
[1:31:30] or has spoken to you that you really
[1:31:33] want or a calling or you needing a touch
[1:31:37] of the spirit in your affections or in
[1:31:40] the place where you love or your
[1:31:41] subconscious somewhere where it's
[1:31:42] blocked and you really need that God to
[1:31:46] touch you so that you can be unlocked,
[1:31:48] so that you can love more, so that you
[1:31:50] can connect with people, so that fear
[1:31:53] can be dealt
[1:31:55] Then I just want you to just raise your
[1:31:56] hands to the Lord.
[1:31:58] Amen.
[1:31:58] And and we're going to pray. And I
[1:32:01] believe that God tonight will touch you.
[1:32:04] If he's given this for us, then I
[1:32:08] believe that there is grace here. Not
[1:32:10] just for us to hear what has been spoken
[1:32:12] and go, "Wow, that sounds nice." Or, "I
[1:32:15] I I like that." A mental ascent. Let's
[1:32:18] This is beyond mental ascent. that this
[1:32:21] is something for you to be touched in
[1:32:23] your heart, in your spirit, so that you
[1:32:25] can be healed or so you can be restored
[1:32:26] or so you can love more so that Felio
[1:32:29] love can be can be revealed in your
[1:32:31] life.
[1:32:32] Amen. I believe that God is here to
[1:32:34] heal. And so we'll just pray and if you
[1:32:36] want to pray in your own way I'm going
[1:32:38] to pray but we'll just pray together and
[1:32:40] then we'll sing this song and then we'll
[1:32:42] go to our actual full prayer meeting
[1:32:45] just for actually you know what because
[1:32:47] of the time let's just pray now but you
[1:32:49] can pray for yourself and I'm going to
[1:32:51] pray over you and and and if anyone's on
[1:32:53] the tape you just reach out your arms to
[1:32:55] the Lord and and you just say Lord I
[1:32:57] really need healing in this area cuz I
[1:33:00] want to love like that. Amen. Let's just
[1:33:03] pray in Jesus name. Father, Lord, I I
[1:33:06] thank you for this this word that you've
[1:33:07] given us, Lord. And I believe, Father,
[1:33:09] it's something for us to grow. It's time
[1:33:12] for us to be healed. My spirit, Lord, I
[1:33:14] need to unlock, Lord, and to unblock any
[1:33:16] channel, Lord, that would hinder me from
[1:33:18] loving. And Lord, the congregation, I
[1:33:20] believe, hands were raised. And people
[1:33:22] are are needing, Lord, a touch from you,
[1:33:24] a healing in their human spirit or in
[1:33:26] their mind. Something from the past has
[1:33:28] blocked them and they scared to love or
[1:33:30] scared to connect. But I pray Lord that
[1:33:33] love would come in such a powerful way
[1:33:34] that we would receive a feast of love
[1:33:37] and that love feast would just descend
[1:33:39] upon us Lord Jesus. And Father we would
[1:33:41] just Father Lord just be so saturated in
[1:33:44] your divine
[1:33:47] what I feel.
[1:33:50] No matter what I hear
[1:33:55] I believe.
[1:33:58] No matter what I'm told,
[1:34:01] no matter how it seems,
[1:34:05] no matter what it costs,
[1:34:10] I believe.
[1:34:14] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:34:18] broken,
[1:34:21] I'll lay a hallelu
[1:34:24] on the altar.
[1:34:28] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:34:32] over,
[1:34:36] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:34:39] on the altar
[1:34:42] because he's a miracle. He's a miracle.
[1:34:48] He's a miracle working God. He's a
[1:34:52] miracle. He's a miracle. He's a miracle
[1:34:56] working God. He's a miracle. He's a

[1:35:28] no matter what I'm told,
[1:35:32] no matter how it seems,
[1:35:35] no matter what it costs,
[1:35:39] I believe.
[1:35:43] And if I look and it seems like it's
[1:35:47] broken,
[1:35:50] I'll lay a hallelujah
[1:35:53] on the altar.
