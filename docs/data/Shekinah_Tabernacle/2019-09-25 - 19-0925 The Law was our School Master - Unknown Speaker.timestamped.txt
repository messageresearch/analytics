[30:46] yeah
[30:47] [Music]
[30:51] miss lourd
[30:52] [Music]
[31:02] right now
[31:04] [Music]
[31:26] amen
[32:18] some reason I'm getting nothing up on
[32:20] that spring I've just the skinniest
[32:38] let's write a script
[32:42] but before faith hang we would keep that
[32:46] under the law shut up unto the faith
[32:48] which should afterwards be revealed
[32:50] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[32:52] to bring us unto Christ that we might be
[32:56] justified by faith but after that faith
[32:59] has come we are no longer under a
[33:01] schoolmaster
[33:04] my thought was evening as we are no
[33:07] longer under earth under a schoolmaster
[33:09] and I can't get my slideshow to work
[33:13] some reason it's just the devil that's
[33:16] just every time I don't know why I
[33:17] bother
[33:20] after you can try and cancel that and
[33:23] plug in my teeth ii will try that the
[33:27] last time i you can be seated
[33:31] so i try and gain any of all times last
[33:36] time i preached i preached on divine
[33:39] love or perfect love for perfect faith a
[33:42] perfect killing and something was
[33:44] speaking to me since then something a
[33:47] bit more to that and that's what i want
[33:48] to talk about tonight so i thought what
[33:51] is a schoolmaster who knows what a
[33:52] schoolmaster is i mean and some of the
[33:56] older people may know what a
[33:57] schoolmaster was that was maybe a bit
[34:00] different than what your kids know as a
[34:01] schoolmaster oh my and the schoolmaster
[34:04] would bring correction and if you had to
[34:08] be brought before their headmaster it
[34:09] was not a pleasant thing because we knew
[34:12] did something wrong that schoolmaster
[34:13] brought correction and it wasn't nice it
[34:16] was hard but we're not we're not under
[34:20] that same anointing right now
[34:22] something's taking place
[34:24] amen because that that schoolmaster that
[34:27] that pained that what that cane would
[34:29] bring pain will bring scars and
[34:33] sometimes those scars would last and
[34:35] that's what's happened in a previous
[34:37] generation of what's come up and the
[34:40] message as we've had people that have
[34:42] tried to take the place of school must
[34:43] and then what the bride and caused scars
[34:46] pain but with we're in a different
[34:49] dispensation now something's something's
[34:51] changing and something's changing in the
[34:54] believer because it's going to
[34:56] got to bring some more life out of the
[34:58] believer man the Lord never justified us
[35:02] the law brought us price that we might
[35:05] be justified by faith and then after
[35:09] that faith has come we are no longer
[35:10] under a schoolmaster so we shouldn't be
[35:13] serving God out of fear we should be
[35:14] serving him out of love rather next
[35:21] slide give it boss I want to read you
[35:27] this quote because this quotes really
[35:28] where I I drew my inspiration from you
[35:33] can't have faith without perfect love
[35:36] Bible teaching is usually a little trick
[35:39] teacher Asst rigorous a little you know
[35:42] kind of walking out on the nice we call
[35:45] it but we just feel that maybe at this
[35:47] point and at this time it might be good
[35:49] to kind of bring the church to what I
[35:51] think to a complete understanding
[35:53] positionally of what we are in Christ
[35:55] Jesus and sometimes I think that
[35:58] preaching is a wonderful thing but I
[35:59] believe sometimes brother bila that
[36:01] teaching goes beyond that and especially
[36:04] to the church now preaching usually
[36:06] catches the sinner brings them under
[36:08] condemnation by the word but teaching
[36:10] places the men positionally what he is
[36:13] and we can never rightly be able to have
[36:15] faith until positionally we know what we
[36:18] are so I my prayer is that everybody
[36:23] would know where they are positionally
[36:25] placed in Christ because then you can
[36:27] help me but the promises that are
[36:30] written in the word and everybody's in a
[36:34] different stage not irrelevant in their
[36:37] promised land right now what I'm gonna
[36:39] say tonight is nothing new you've been
[36:41] there for 10 years seven years you know
[36:43] I've maybe been there for two or three
[36:45] years everyone starts off and and they
[36:48] grow into this as a process and I want
[36:52] to show that we're a free people
[36:53] hey man and there's something that makes
[36:55] this church this bride different from
[36:58] other believers you are a different
[37:01] Church you're not like the pinna coastal
[37:03] Church you're not like the Baptist
[37:05] Church there's something that is
[37:06] different in this body of people hey man
[37:09] thank you
[37:10] peculiar people that's going no man can
[37:23] be saved by the law the law doesn't save
[37:26] anybody no matter whatever you do how
[37:29] good you look how many good deeds you do
[37:31] you're lost that's all you've got
[37:33] oh you say brother Brennan might give so
[37:35] much to the read father I give so much
[37:37] to charity I feed the widows I clothe
[37:39] the orphaned children and I go to church
[37:41] Caine done as good as that any time and
[37:45] was lost it's not by good works that we
[37:48] are saved that's by the grace of God we
[37:50] are saying the law was not a savior
[37:53] after all the law was a prison house the
[37:56] law only made you know you was a sinner
[37:58] the law pointed out your sin but it
[38:01] doesn't have any remedy if the policeman
[38:03] comes and arrest you and throws you back
[38:05] in jail that's the law that shows you
[38:09] you are a sinner but how are you going
[38:11] to get out that's the next thing the law
[38:14] was just a schoolmaster that pointed out
[38:16] then the law was just a policeman it had
[38:20] absolutely no grace you say this I want
[38:25] a speeding ticket a few weeks or a few
[38:27] months back and I was coming up over the
[38:29] Hayward's Hill I knew the cops they
[38:31] radar there all the time
[38:32] I'm looking at my speedo I'm going yep
[38:35] sweet doing ATK's I go fast maybe I was
[38:38] doing 82 where either I go past and I
[38:41] look at them as I go fast the next thing
[38:43] I see this guy run to his car and then
[38:45] jump and his carrying come and chase me
[38:46] I thought oh yeah maybe he's gone for
[38:48] the next person and he pulled me over he
[38:50] goes you know how fast are you going
[38:52] I'll swab ya about ATK's I was watching
[38:54] my speedo and I had my cruise control on
[38:57] I was just watching it he goes you're
[38:58] done 94s no I wasn't doing 90 a speeding
[39:02] I'm sorry I broke you know I broke your
[39:04] roll and I'll pay the fine I wasn't
[39:05] stealing and so he said well obviously
[39:08] you want to debate this they will put
[39:10] you're a leader and the nails so the
[39:12] leader come through and I wrote a nice
[39:14] email up and explained to them the
[39:17] situation on top of that the next
[39:20] morning I rang my boss as our vehicles
[39:23] have a real
[39:24] accurate GPS system that tracks and logs
[39:27] everything and tell you we how fast you
[39:30] were going where so I rung the boss and
[39:32] told him what happened and I said was I
[39:34] speeding and he brought up the record he
[39:36] said no you weren't speeding it wasn't a
[39:38] single point on that Haywood wrote that
[39:39] here were over the speed limit and so I
[39:42] put this on the leader and everything
[39:44] and sent it off to the place and I get
[39:45] an email back and it was harsh because
[39:48] it was the law as a policeman there's no
[39:50] Grayson at all and it said I'm sorry
[39:52] games are over I'm not willing to pardon
[39:56] the Sun thus the speeding ticket its way
[40:00] and a law and then have you bring this
[40:02] to court the judge in the jury will
[40:04] always take the policeman's word over
[40:07] any uh Nick Garrett untested GPS system
[40:12] I thought that just unjust you know
[40:16] there's no way I could get out of it I
[40:18] have to pay the fine I get the demerit
[40:20] points but I didn't thought but I'm glad
[40:23] that our God's not like Amen that he's
[40:26] made away he's made away the law pointed
[40:32] out there couldn't let me go but Jesus
[40:35] hallelujah he forgives every seven
[40:39] remember the harlot that was caught in
[40:41] the act and brought unto Jesus and all
[40:44] those men that they were righteous in
[40:47] himself and they wanted to cast the
[40:49] first I wanted a stone it Lord she
[40:51] should be stoned and Jesus said ye that
[40:54] are without son you cast the first stone
[40:56] how guilty do you think they felt ye
[41:00] that are without sin nobody's without
[41:04] son not in their flesh unconverted flesh
[41:07] and so he starts drawing in the sand and
[41:10] i wonder what he was drawing in the sand
[41:13] I've often wondered what he was drawing
[41:15] in the sand you know was he writing out
[41:17] the ten commandments or was it like a
[41:20] discernment line where he was calling
[41:23] out his name and then he started saying
[41:26] which road he walked down that night the
[41:29] previous night and then which door he
[41:31] knocked on and that one quickly got up
[41:33] and left before the story went any
[41:35] further
[41:36] son will always catch you
[41:40] you know Paul was a man that thought he
[41:44] was a pretty good pretty good by the law
[41:46] there weren't many people in the land
[41:48] like all he was he was up here I want to
[41:52] read this Philippians 3:5 circumcised
[41:56] the eighth day of the stock of Israel of
[41:58] the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the
[42:01] Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee
[42:03] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[42:06] touching the righteousness which is in
[42:09] the law blameless blameless he was a man
[42:12] that was right there with the law but
[42:15] what things were gain to me those I
[42:17] counted loss for Christ yea doubtless
[42:19] and I count all things but loss for the
[42:22] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[42:23] Jesus my Lord
[42:24] the whom I have suffered the loss of all
[42:27] things and do count them but dung that I
[42:29] may win Christ and be found in him not
[42:33] having my own righteousness which is of
[42:35] the law but that which is through the
[42:38] faith of Christ the righteousness which
[42:40] is of God by faith that I made I love
[42:43] that I may know him in the power of his
[42:45] resurrection and in the Fellowship of
[42:48] the sufferings and they made conformable
[42:50] and to us here
[42:52] a me my righteousness comes from my
[42:55] faith that's then God not my own action
[42:59] but if the love of God's and me those
[43:02] things will come anyway man Abraham was
[43:07] not justified by his actions but by
[43:09] faith in the promises and we have a
[43:11] promise that will take us on this day
[43:14] from a newborn baby right the way to an
[43:17] adopted son I want to know Jesus Christ
[43:21] and the power of his resurrection not
[43:24] and not an Noddin not on as in his order
[43:28] as doctrine I don't want to know him as
[43:30] a man that beats his wife with a stick I
[43:33] want to know him in the power of his
[43:35] resurrection oh no no I'm honor on a
[43:37] one-to-one basis I want to know him when
[43:41] I can't find the answer in the scripture
[43:42] than my problem that's how I want to
[43:45] know him then I can go straight to him
[43:46] and he can give me that answer
[43:51] I want to know what he likes Hebrews
[43:56] 5:12 but when the time you ought to be
[43:58] teachers you have need that one teach
[44:00] you again which be the first principles
[44:02] of the Oracles of God and I become such
[44:05] as have need of milk and not strong me
[44:07] but everyone that uses milk is
[44:10] unskillful and the word of righteous
[44:12] here's a babe but strong meat belongeth
[44:14] them that are of full age even those who
[44:18] by reason of use have their senses
[44:21] exercised to discern both good and evil
[44:25] and that's what I'm going to come to a
[44:26] bit later as what's taking place in us
[44:30] as giving us the power to discern right
[44:32] and wrong everyone starts this journey
[44:38] as a baby and if that baby doesn't grow
[44:43] that baby doesn't get a bit taller you
[44:46] start going what's wrong with my baby
[44:48] there's something wrong with my baby
[44:50] it's not growing am I not feeding at the
[44:52] right food as it got a disease is
[44:55] something the baby has to grow and a
[44:57] healthy baby when it grows and it comes
[45:00] off milking it's its appetite starts to
[45:02] change and these son needs a different
[45:05] kind of food to grow that to that next
[45:07] stage and then you find it grows up into
[45:10] a teenager and then it just eats
[45:11] everything because as consistently
[45:15] growing and it's consistently changing
[45:18] its appetite and that's the way we
[45:20] should be the more we grow into God the
[45:22] more our hunger changes and hungers for
[45:25] the Word of God and what the more I want
[45:26] to die then and find out what the
[45:29] mystery is for me yes amen
[45:34] you should desire for more revelation
[45:36] brother Branham says pray for Revelation
[45:38] pray for Revelation he really drives to
[45:42] them but if we get too busy that's what
[45:46] happens we get too busy and it robs us
[45:49] of our time that we've been to God but
[45:51] you are pulled to have a revelation of
[45:53] this message that's your right it's not
[45:56] too complicated you know the devil wants
[45:58] to tell you that it's too common it is
[46:01] not complicated at all
[46:04] right show this Daniel 12 10 meaning
[46:10] shall be purified and made white and
[46:11] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[46:14] and none of the wicked shall understand
[46:16] but the wise shall understand you know
[46:22] God God works through the fivefold
[46:25] ministry right and he gives a minister a
[46:28] revelation maybe a tithe and the Old
[46:30] Testament and he opens up and he shows
[46:33] that and it reveals something and it
[46:34] reveals who you are and it reveals
[46:36] something to you
[46:37] you go man you know he needs us
[46:39] rejoicing do you think God gives that
[46:41] revelation to that Minister so he can
[46:43] enjoy that revelation by himself if God
[46:46] gives the mystery to that Minister to
[46:48] understand he's only giving it to
[46:50] channel it through him to us that you
[46:52] would understand that mr. Washington's
[46:57] 1:9 for this cause we also since the day
[47:00] we heard it do not cease to pray for you
[47:02] and desire that he might be filled with
[47:04] the knowledge of his will and all wisdom
[47:07] and spiritual understanding that he
[47:09] might walk worthy of the Lord and to all
[47:12] pleasing being fruitful in every good
[47:14] work and increasing in the knowledge of
[47:16] God I mean I believe that I believe that
[47:20] everything that God wants to show to his
[47:22] bride he wants to show you if he has put
[47:25] something in your heart he wants to show
[47:27] it yeah it's given a fivefold ministry
[47:32] wife yes and that's God's a number of
[47:34] brace because it's His grace to you that
[47:37] you would understand this that you would
[47:39] get a revelation you have an attitude
[47:42] you know every believer as a wintered as
[47:47] a pointer to come to that adoption yeah
[47:49] if you have started there's an appointed
[47:51] time when you will get it maybe it's
[47:53] right now right tonight maybe it's not
[47:56] for another couple years but if you've
[47:58] started your journey there's an
[47:59] appointed find that you will come have
[48:02] been a full adopted son of God
[48:09] having predestinated us unto the
[48:12] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[48:15] himself according to the good pleasure
[48:17] of as well so it's heads good pleasure
[48:19] that you would be prison predestinated
[48:22] unto adoption because he's the author
[48:24] and finisher of your faith not just the
[48:25] author that has finisher Donna door just
[48:29] a little bit of an overview of adoption
[48:31] because I know it will have been taught
[48:33] but I just want to go over it I just
[48:35] felt to go over it from the adoption
[48:41] message now what is adoption listen your
[48:44] adoption is not your birth your adoption
[48:47] is your placement when you were born
[48:49] again John 1:17 I believe when we were
[48:52] born of the Spirit of God we are the
[48:54] sons of God but we are predestinated now
[48:58] here's what I'm trying to get but the
[49:00] sons of the last state see we're
[49:02] predestinated unto adoption now here we
[49:07] are now this is what hurts inter crossed
[49:10] a little they say I got born again
[49:11] praise the Lord got the Holy Ghost fine
[49:14] you're a child of God that's right but
[49:16] yet that ain't what I'm talking about so
[49:18] you were predestinated unto the adoption
[49:20] that's a placing of a son so your
[49:22] baptism was not the time when you became
[49:25] an adopted son that just started your
[49:27] journey that was your birth and now
[49:29] there's journey you have to go through
[49:32] but there's an appointed time when it
[49:33] all had the first stage of your adoption
[49:38] as justification because it comes in a
[49:41] three-stage process God's perfected
[49:44] entries and he perfects his bride and
[49:46] three and brother Branham types up to
[49:49] Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan
[49:52] zli and he said this is this is the
[49:54] three stages of adoption in the first
[49:58] stage under justification is believing
[50:01] Moses and coming out of Egypt and
[50:03] sometimes that can be the hardest thing
[50:05] to come out of Egypt I'm gonna show just
[50:07] in a minute why this is so hard even
[50:12] Jesus when he was baptized he had the
[50:15] hardest temptation in his ministry
[50:17] and after he came up out of the waters
[50:20] that devil takes it and now that dealing
[50:22] bevel gives him all the temptation at
[50:25] the time of his baptism it's a dangerous
[50:27] time at the time to pilot through the in
[50:31] Egypt the death angels coming to strike
[50:34] the firstborn there's people coming out
[50:36] and at birth out of Egypt and Pharaohs
[50:38] army is chasing chasing he he doesn't
[50:41] want to let you go as you're coming out
[50:43] of sin you're coming out of the world
[50:44] and he's right behind you chasing you he
[50:47] doesn't want you to make it across the
[50:49] river doesn't want you to cross the sea
[50:51] he's not just going to let you leave
[50:53] gonna put up by ya and you have to be
[50:56] prepared to lay everything down so
[51:01] there's a song a worldly song and I just
[51:04] want to bring up the lyrics because this
[51:05] is I've really identified the song in
[51:09] the past and I just think well because
[51:11] you know we have a song that the Lord
[51:14] and that's anointed but year every
[51:16] spirit has a song and even Satan can
[51:20] anoint and this song really shows one of
[51:25] these fallen angels that was deceived by
[51:27] Satan when you weren't deceived by his
[51:29] life before the foundation of the world
[51:31] there were people that were to see and
[51:33] they didn't want to be deceived they one
[51:35] of the worship God God created the
[51:36] angels to worship but Satan to see and
[51:39] now there's these spirits in the earth
[51:42] that have fallen angels
[51:44] you know or not sure so this is a song
[51:46] written by the Eagles as funny it's
[51:49] written by the Eagles been there their
[51:51] real Eagle anointing is for the bride
[51:53] and they wrote the song Hotel California
[51:56] and I want to show you how each up to
[51:58] such a threat it says on a dark desert
[52:02] highway cool wind in my hair warm smell
[52:04] of colitas rising up through the air up
[52:06] in the head and the distance I saw a
[52:09] shimmering light and this is what
[52:11] brother Brennan was saying about the
[52:13] gospel the gospel doesn't shine it glows
[52:15] a Hollywood shimmers like that snake
[52:17] that gets up it does it dancer it
[52:20] catches your your attention at the hid
[52:23] in the distance I saw a shimmering light
[52:24] my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[52:27] I had to stop for the night there she
[52:30] stood in the doorway I heard them
[52:32] in Bell and I was thinking to myself
[52:34] this could be heaven or this could be
[52:36] hell then she lit up a candle and showed
[52:39] me the way there were voices down the
[52:41] corridor I thought I heard them say
[52:44] welcome to the hotel california such a
[52:47] lovely place such a lovely place
[52:49] face plenty of room at the hotel
[52:51] california any time of the year you find
[52:54] it here it's sin it's this is a place
[52:58] that looks good it looks attractive such
[53:01] a lovely place such a lovely face and it
[53:04] draws you in but you're going to see
[53:06] what happens this that was the first
[53:11] verse and I've skipped out a bit I want
[53:13] to show you the last verse just so I can
[53:14] show you a trap of this mirrors on the
[53:18] ceiling the pink champagne on ice and
[53:20] she said we are all just prisoners here
[53:23] of our own device and in the Masters
[53:26] chambers they gathered for the face they
[53:29] stab it with their steely knives but
[53:31] they just can't kill the Beast the last
[53:33] thing I remember was running for the
[53:35] door I had to find the passage back to
[53:37] the place I was before relax said the
[53:40] night man we are programmed to receive
[53:43] you can checkout any time you like but
[53:45] you can never leave that's what Egypt
[53:48] does you can never leave once you once
[53:52] you give over to Satan and you go and
[53:55] you get to a point where you can't come
[53:57] back and look at the spirit saying it's
[53:59] saying last thing I remember was running
[54:03] for the door I had to find a passage
[54:05] back to the place I was before you think
[54:08] son looks attractive you will find you
[54:11] do not want to be it's a trap that it's
[54:14] a little shimmering light and it drew
[54:16] you in but then you find that wasn't
[54:18] where you wanted to be at all and it
[54:20] says they stab it with their steely
[54:23] knives but they just can't kill the bees
[54:26] they don't want to be there they want to
[54:28] kill this base and a stealing knife will
[54:31] not kill it a devil because our weapons
[54:33] are not carnal but we have a we have a
[54:36] sword that is not made of steel and it's
[54:39] sharper than any two-edged sword
[54:42] and it will kill the devil and we'll
[54:44] tell the beasts and we can use that
[54:49] don't be caught up in this trap as this
[54:52] as a trap
[54:53] I actually have passion for this person
[54:58] writing the song I feel so bad for them
[55:00] because I know it's it's an anointing as
[55:02] a spirit trying out of something that
[55:05] was happening beyond a dimension we can
[55:06] see you know and and the devil can
[55:11] anoint our flesh because as brother
[55:14] Nathan was saying our souls converted
[55:16] you know but the spirit and the flesh is
[55:18] still subject it's still subject to this
[55:21] fallen world and so now you'll see young
[55:25] people when they come up into that time
[55:27] of life and then things are happening
[55:28] and the devil can anoint your flesh and
[55:30] you have to be so careful because you
[55:33] know you'll see you'll see a girl and
[55:36] she and she thinks this boys so cute and
[55:38] attractive you know and it looks like
[55:40] he's headed here depth on a deep fryer
[55:43] and been dragged through the bush
[55:44] backwards you know and and she and she
[55:47] guys doesn't he's so cute you know and
[55:49] we all think he looks like a deep-fried
[55:50] rooster it's but it's insanity it's it's
[55:54] an anointing upon the flesh when when
[55:57] when you know you're looking at
[56:00] something and it looks so pretty and
[56:01] everyone else is going what do I don't
[56:03] see what are you looking at yeah that's
[56:05] an anointing that comes on the fish and
[56:07] that's why brother branham see we should
[56:08] be filled with the Holy Ghost before we
[56:10] even start looking for a part because we
[56:13] need to be able to discern between good
[56:15] and evil if you've heard something in
[56:24] your heart saying come out of Egypt
[56:26] that's Moses speaking to you leading you
[56:27] unto justification that's just your
[56:30] first step and adoption you know I was
[56:36] talking to brother Ben we were out
[56:38] fishing and it's as fresh over the boat
[56:41] we've just been talking about winner
[56:43] when a Christian comes into church you
[56:45] know and and like Nadine and I when we
[56:47] first come into church and I've probably
[56:49] come in a hoodie and she was wearing her
[56:50] jeans and Ben and I were talking about
[56:52] this and and you know he
[56:54] let's fish over the boat I said when was
[56:56] a lot less at fish clean you know
[56:59] especially not cleaner it's as dirty and
[57:02] slimy and it's just coming the boat and
[57:04] it's it's gone and why kill even its
[57:06] Karlovac it's as a table fish but it's
[57:09] got something that's got a process of
[57:11] time before that becomes a clean fish on
[57:13] my plate and at this stage of your
[57:17] journey when you are under justification
[57:20] a child a child is not responsible for a
[57:23] sentence because it doesn't know the
[57:25] Senate that's just justified you come to
[57:27] the Lord and things cling to you and
[57:29] they come with and you don't actually
[57:31] realize those things as sin and God
[57:34] Betty says you know well right now at
[57:36] this stage of my child's life maybe the
[57:38] child is just young there's a small
[57:40] trial and daddy's is taking here a small
[57:42] child and daddy takes upon the son of
[57:45] that child he's responsible for that
[57:46] child he doesn't want to see as as child
[57:49] go astray he that he teaches it right
[57:52] but he's responsible for that child
[57:54] responsible for what that child does
[57:56] that's and as that child is growing he's
[58:02] under a tutor he's and brother branham
[58:05] said the Holy Spirit is our tutor so
[58:07] when you were born again we knew when
[58:10] you were baptized you received the Holy
[58:12] Spirit there's something as it's going
[58:15] to change along your journey in there
[58:16] you still have the Holy Spirit the whole
[58:18] way that's something when you become an
[58:20] adopted son changes and I'll get to that
[58:23] soon Scripture I don't have it written
[58:27] down
[58:32] lations for this one now I say that a
[58:38] year as long as he has a child differeth
[58:41] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[58:43] of all
[58:44] but as under tutors and governors until
[58:46] the time appointed so an ear is as long
[58:52] as he has a child he different nothing
[58:54] from a servant I don't want to be a
[58:55] servant of price I want to be his bride
[58:59] so I want to take the next step in my
[59:02] journey and move on to sanctification
[59:10] so once you've come out of Egypt and you
[59:13] come to that red sea and you go through
[59:16] the Red Sea and the Devils dying and the
[59:19] river as you come through because you're
[59:21] about to walk through a new stage under
[59:22] sanctification and sometimes this is the
[59:25] longest period and a person's journey
[59:28] from birth to adoption as Israel spent
[59:30] such a long time in the desert wandering
[59:33] in the desert and a time of Saint
[59:34] Haitian and you know this this is the
[59:40] time when some people maybe receive
[59:42] every think they needing and wash
[59:44] themselves and go straight into adoption
[59:46] but it's a time when we can you know
[59:50] these things that happened in the desert
[59:52] a lot of complaining and and and I was
[59:56] thinking about this this week and I
[59:58] thought you know the people that would
[1:00:02] get in complained it were generally the
[1:00:03] people that were in charge you know
[1:00:05] Moses is not the only one not the only
[1:00:08] holy one beause you know
[1:00:11] his other holy men that was always going
[1:00:13] towards the hid and I don't even want to
[1:00:16] get to a place where all I can do is
[1:00:18] complain about church you know my
[1:00:20] brother Andy was singing this song I was
[1:00:22] glad when they said let us go into the
[1:00:24] house I love God it's a joy to go to the
[1:00:26] house of the Lord I don't come to the
[1:00:28] house of the Lord the fine fault I have
[1:00:32] made a conscious decision in my mind
[1:00:35] that I do not want to come to the house
[1:00:37] of the Lord the find fault I want to
[1:00:38] come here to worship God my purpose is
[1:00:40] to come here and worship God I don't
[1:00:44] want to look
[1:00:47] and you think well when on baptize
[1:00:51] everything's going to be good from now
[1:00:52] on everything's gonna be fine you know
[1:00:54] and you find out that your troubles only
[1:00:56] begin this is a hard fight because God
[1:01:02] really wants to kiss you and see what
[1:01:04] you're made of so we know look at
[1:01:06] adoption I like to face it by that color
[1:01:11] Hebrew child would be placed and around
[1:01:15] the age of 12 to 13 a child comes to a
[1:01:18] ceremony called Barnet's and I thought I
[1:01:22] wonder what Bar Mitzvah means so when I
[1:01:24] was looking at this ayat I looked at the
[1:01:26] meaning of the word brother Tuen Bar
[1:01:35] Mitzvah it means one who was subject to
[1:01:39] the law so at that time when you were a
[1:01:43] small child daddy was responsible for
[1:01:45] you under justification daddy took upon
[1:01:47] yourself he forgives you but then you
[1:01:50] come to a time maybe about 12 or 13
[1:01:53] where now you're getting an
[1:01:55] understanding of what what is good and
[1:01:57] what's wrong and now you become one that
[1:02:00] is subject to the law you come under
[1:02:02] sanctification now daddy's no longer
[1:02:05] going to be responsible for your son's
[1:02:07] here if you sin you're going to start to
[1:02:09] pay there are consequences of some of
[1:02:11] those things that you're doing so every
[1:02:14] believer comes into this period of
[1:02:16] sanctification and you are now
[1:02:20] responsible you're coming to a point in
[1:02:22] your walk with the Lord that you're
[1:02:23] responsible for your action and it's a
[1:02:26] second stage in your journey to adoption
[1:02:33] and Jesus you know I was thinking when
[1:02:38] Jesus was twelve years old as they went
[1:02:41] to Jerusalem and his parents when they
[1:02:43] leave they're like we're where's our son
[1:02:45] and Jesus was in the temple teacher and
[1:02:48] as he when his parents come to him they
[1:02:51] said well what are you doing he said
[1:02:53] don't you know I should be about my
[1:02:55] father's business because about this
[1:02:58] time and the Hebrew tradition their
[1:03:00] child had been under atutor up until
[1:03:03] this time dad was too busy to look after
[1:03:05] the child though mom or auntie's whoever
[1:03:08] had been looking after the child now he
[1:03:10] comes up to a point where he's going to
[1:03:12] start to learn the trade of his father
[1:03:13] so now the child would learn what that
[1:03:16] is like and under the sanctification we
[1:03:18] begin to learn what there's life and
[1:03:21] Jesus was saying don't you know I should
[1:03:23] be about my father's business but his
[1:03:26] natural family were saying well he's
[1:03:28] going to start to be a carpenter and
[1:03:30] he's going to build tables or do
[1:03:32] whatever they do but he was about his
[1:03:34] father's business
[1:03:41] and the only thing that kept me from
[1:03:44] being saved when I was 12 was because a
[1:03:47] spirit hung over me a devil saying wait
[1:03:49] a little while longer that's the reason
[1:03:52] you wasn't saved when you become the age
[1:03:54] of accountability a spirit you got in a
[1:03:56] crowd that hovered over you and kept
[1:03:58] hanging over you you wanted to do right
[1:04:00] it's not a man got it in his right mind
[1:04:03] that what wants to do right is something
[1:04:05] that won't let you do right that's that
[1:04:07] right that's the devil right you say I
[1:04:10] want I want to make this decision now
[1:04:13] and I'm not just talking about a 12 and
[1:04:15] a 13 euro but you've been living under a
[1:04:17] period of sanctification for a long time
[1:04:19] you've been in Egypt you've been
[1:04:20] wandering around in circles and you
[1:04:22] couldn't quite get their vote and
[1:04:24] there's something that's just stopping
[1:04:26] you from doing it and he says it's the
[1:04:27] devil but you can have the book you
[1:04:30] don't have to be stuck by that devil his
[1:04:34] time is up giving in those eviction
[1:04:37] notice
[1:04:47] you know when they were stuck there and
[1:04:50] they were complaining you know what were
[1:04:51] they really saying there was you know
[1:04:56] they came to the mountain to Mount Sinai
[1:04:58] and there was a trumpet sounding on that
[1:05:01] mountain and I was looking at the Hebrew
[1:05:05] meanings of the word because there was
[1:05:06] there was a trumpet that sounded for war
[1:05:08] and there was a trumpet that sounded for
[1:05:10] Jubilee they were they were a secret
[1:05:11] trumpet they had a different meaning but
[1:05:13] this trumpet that was sounding on Mount
[1:05:15] Sinai was a jubilee trumpet trumpet of
[1:05:18] Jubilee and they were saying well we
[1:05:20] don't we're afraid Moses we don't think
[1:05:23] we can speak to God but but we want to
[1:05:25] pass there but we we want a man we want
[1:05:28] a denomination we want we want a bore of
[1:05:31] looking a book of law and order you know
[1:05:34] Moses you speak you speak the God but
[1:05:37] God wants us bright to come to a place
[1:05:39] where it's direct and line communication
[1:05:41] between you and Christ that's where I
[1:05:45] want to come behold I Paul say unto you
[1:05:53] that if ye be circumcised Christ shall
[1:05:55] profit you nothing brightest afire
[1:05:57] game.the every man that is circumcised
[1:05:59] that he is a debtor to do the whole law
[1:06:02] Christ has become no effective effect
[1:06:05] unto you whosoever of you are justified
[1:06:07] by the law you have fallen from grace
[1:06:10] but we through the spirit wait for the
[1:06:13] hope of righteousness by faith so if you
[1:06:17] want to be stuck under the law and be so
[1:06:19] critical on that thing you have to be
[1:06:22] responsible for all of them yeah and I
[1:06:26] can say myself I'll fail
[1:06:29] I just couldn't do it I can't be
[1:06:30] responsible for that so I'm glad that
[1:06:33] the law was only my schoolmaster I would
[1:06:37] be in big trouble
[1:06:43] you know these people didn't know how to
[1:06:45] be a free people they come out of Egypt
[1:06:47] they've been slaves they didn't know how
[1:06:49] to be a free people and many message
[1:06:52] people with being slaves to under man's
[1:06:54] tradition because they doesn't know
[1:06:55] they've come out of the nomination a
[1:06:57] time and denomination when Pentecost
[1:07:00] really sprung up from Azusa Street and
[1:07:02] then it big
[1:07:03] what CLE quickly began to denominator
[1:07:05] you know it was only a few years after
[1:07:07] the Pentecostal revival that it started
[1:07:09] to denominator and to baptize free times
[1:07:12] faced board backwards five God's all
[1:07:16] these different things then men became
[1:07:17] slaves under bondage and then when this
[1:07:20] jubilee trumpet sounded we're like the
[1:07:23] people in Egypt we'd been slaves and we
[1:07:25] didn't know how to be a free people but
[1:07:28] Christ is leading us to be a free people
[1:07:35] my brother sister we are trying to make
[1:07:38] denominations we're trying to build
[1:07:40] churches we're trying to organize people
[1:07:41] educate it's all in vain until the love
[1:07:44] of God comes you want to speak with
[1:07:47] tongues you want to clap your hands you
[1:07:49] want to jump you want to dance you want
[1:07:51] to do certain things to make yourself a
[1:07:53] Christian you'll never be until the love
[1:07:55] of God takes over in your heart that
[1:07:57] tears the middle out of them that makes
[1:08:00] you feel for your brother that'll make
[1:08:02] you act like a man like a child of God
[1:08:04] and put Christ and knew the hope of
[1:08:06] glory amen let's move on here on our
[1:08:11] journey because I don't want to get
[1:08:12] stuck in the desert I want to enter into
[1:08:16] Kanaan's land glory and you know the
[1:08:18] longer you spend under that time the
[1:08:20] more you get eaten with a stick tired
[1:08:23] the law was necessary for a time but
[1:08:25] that was a past age and the pillar of
[1:08:27] fires moved on the pillar of fire is not
[1:08:30] an Egypt anymore and I'm following that
[1:08:32] that pillar of fire so they come to the
[1:08:35] Jordan River and Canaan's lands just on
[1:08:37] the other side there's another step of
[1:08:39] faith you have to have to take to get in
[1:08:42] the devil does not want you to that but
[1:08:44] one foot in that land something a step
[1:08:49] that you have to pay and as you go
[1:08:52] through the Jordan River all those last
[1:08:55] little things that
[1:08:57] that really nagged you for years and
[1:08:59] years you couldn't shake off they just
[1:09:00] somehow get washed down the river as you
[1:09:03] go through its brother handy said right
[1:09:06] down into the Dead Sea because your old
[1:09:09] husband has to die you know you cannot
[1:09:11] if you are a married person you cannot
[1:09:14] get remarried if you have another
[1:09:16] husband so their old husband has to die
[1:09:19] that old suddenly nature you were
[1:09:21] married to has to die go into the Dead
[1:09:23] Sea as you can't just be divorce insta
[1:09:26] go into the Dead Sea and then you can
[1:09:29] come into Canaan slain because in
[1:09:30] Canaan's land as where you get married
[1:09:32] to Christ hallelujah amen and you know
[1:09:40] Canaan's land as this is the bride age
[1:09:43] that we call Taleban on the other side
[1:09:45] and Egypt that's Laodicea but we're
[1:09:48] coming over into the space and to this
[1:09:50] bride age and and and it really is just
[1:09:52] an anointing that lets you love above
[1:09:56] the son of a Jew you have to come to a
[1:10:01] place where you're you know you're
[1:10:03] you're only one-third converted right
[1:10:05] your soul is converted it's taking a
[1:10:07] rapturous and a bride ages it's in this
[1:10:10] breach between this sinful horrible
[1:10:12] place we are in the Millennium your
[1:10:14] souls of sinning that we're stuck we
[1:10:17] have to come out of it amen amen
[1:10:22] and so by the time this Hebrew son is
[1:10:27] around 33 naturally speaking because I'm
[1:10:30] talking this a natural spiritual type
[1:10:32] this child's growing now that's
[1:10:34] progressing it's been in an
[1:10:35] apprenticeship up till the time he's a
[1:10:38] young man and he's been learning his
[1:10:39] father's trade he's getting pretty good
[1:10:41] at his father's trade and dad's getting
[1:10:44] it but older dad wants to retire now and
[1:10:46] he wants to be able to pass everything
[1:10:48] down to son and sons names gonna be as
[1:10:51] good as his name on the cheek this is
[1:10:54] the third stage so when Jesus was
[1:10:58] adopted on Mount Transfiguration he was
[1:11:00] 33 years old and God was saying this is
[1:11:03] my son and whom I am well pleased he him
[1:11:05] and when you can't enter this adoption
[1:11:09] your work is just
[1:11:11] began to because you become a final
[1:11:12] voice to the final age and thus 33 I
[1:11:16] just kept seeing its significance and
[1:11:19] dates and events so it was 19 and 33
[1:11:22] when the seventh angel messenger was
[1:11:24] standing in that High River baptizing
[1:11:27] the seventeenth verse them was seven
[1:11:29] thousand people standing on the bank as
[1:11:31] a witness and that pillar of fire come
[1:11:34] down over him and said as I was most was
[1:11:37] with Moses so will I be with you and
[1:11:38] your foreign the second coming of Christ
[1:11:41] 19:33 god ties his word together with
[1:11:46] numbers like you know I've seen that and
[1:11:48] there's word for quite a while so a
[1:11:53] Hebrew son by the time he's 33 is
[1:11:55] reached maturity but there's still a
[1:11:57] work to be done I want to show you a
[1:12:06] scripture that I just it just spoke to
[1:12:08] me and I know with a sort of mind if I
[1:12:11] just wanted to bring it out if it will
[1:12:18] count me out I think I could stop
[1:12:23] working oh there we go
[1:12:26] first kings and the days that David
[1:12:30] reigned over Israel for forty years
[1:12:32] seven years reigned here in Hebron and
[1:12:35] 33 years reigned here in Jerusalem so
[1:12:39] now David's reign was like a type of
[1:12:42] Christ reigning and through seven Church
[1:12:45] ages in Hebron because he wasn't in this
[1:12:47] promised land of Jerusalem but he was
[1:12:50] still raining he was still the son of
[1:12:52] God and he was raining through those
[1:12:54] seventh Church ages but there was a time
[1:12:56] that he was going to be raining and the
[1:12:58] promised land just as we are going to be
[1:13:00] in the promised land we come into a
[1:13:02] promised land when we can him to
[1:13:04] adoption and his reign was 33 years in
[1:13:07] Jerusalem
[1:13:12] go right back to genesis of the original
[1:13:15] what is earth now the world and nature
[1:13:17] is groaning crying everything's moving
[1:13:19] what for the manifestation of the sons
[1:13:22] of God when true sons born son build
[1:13:25] sons speak and their word is back I
[1:13:28] believe we're on the border of it right
[1:13:30] now
[1:13:30] yes sir say to this mountain let it be
[1:13:33] so brother I desire so and so certain
[1:13:37] thing I am a believer in Jesus Christ I
[1:13:39] give it to you in the name of the Lord
[1:13:41] Jesus Christ amen there's a
[1:13:43] manifestation
[1:13:45] oh brother my crops are burning out
[1:13:47] yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send
[1:13:49] you a raining in the name of the Lord
[1:13:51] there shall come I waiting groaning all
[1:13:54] nature waiting for the manifestation of
[1:13:56] the sons of God God ordained it at the
[1:13:58] beginning
[1:13:59] he gave a man the domain he gave Jesus
[1:14:01] Christ and Jesus gave it in his name
[1:14:04] with assurance ask the father anything
[1:14:07] in my name and I'll do it
[1:14:08] oh brother Palmer waiting for the
[1:14:10] manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:14:13] position of the church I want to come to
[1:14:17] a time in my walk with the Lord we are
[1:14:19] I'm a man of peace of the Son of God I'm
[1:14:22] not just a head and son of God there
[1:14:24] that there's no power you know I've been
[1:14:27] writing a song brother brother Isaac
[1:14:29] trying to help me you know if you want
[1:14:31] to see his power within stay around me
[1:14:33] as the same things he did I am
[1:14:35] manifesting as someone is going to
[1:14:38] manifest it and I'm holding on to that
[1:14:43] we're not living under a law in this
[1:14:45] land where our holy people a royal
[1:14:48] priesthood and what makes us this way if
[1:14:52] it's not the law what makes us a holy
[1:14:54] people that that's not the law on a go
[1:14:59] back to the scripture that strong meat
[1:15:01] belongeth to them that are of a full age
[1:15:03] even those whose who by reason of use
[1:15:06] have their senses exercised to discern
[1:15:09] both good and evil and the adopted son
[1:15:12] as one that's of a full age beam has
[1:15:15] sense as they exercise but discern both
[1:15:17] good and evil
[1:15:26] though he were a son yet he learned
[1:15:29] obedience by the things which he
[1:15:31] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:15:33] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:15:35] unto all them that obey so when you run
[1:15:39] the speck in there and Greek meanings of
[1:15:41] this word all age that's the same word
[1:15:44] that's used here that Jesus was made and
[1:15:47] being made perfect booking about the
[1:15:50] Lord as the same word for age and
[1:15:52] perfect and it means it means to finish
[1:15:56] to fulfill to concentrate to make
[1:16:00] perfect the complete the carry through
[1:16:02] completely we accomplished the finish to
[1:16:05] bring to an end strong meat belongeth to
[1:16:08] them that are of a full age for them
[1:16:10] that are complete in Christ that's the
[1:16:13] same as and you have to come to a place
[1:16:17] where you've got your complete with that
[1:16:18] stature of that perfect man has come up
[1:16:20] and it's now it's in the headstone and
[1:16:23] we're living right there's an adopted
[1:16:25] son now you don't need a law because the
[1:16:29] Spirit that is within you will soon good
[1:16:32] and evil you've come to that plate of
[1:16:34] face of being weak positionally place
[1:16:40] Luke 6:40 as if the disciple is not
[1:16:43] above his master for everyone that is
[1:16:45] perfect shall be as has mastered the
[1:16:49] answers Master amateur God's this bride
[1:16:53] age is for mature adopted sons of God to
[1:16:56] be manifested you know you may be the
[1:17:00] only Jesus Christ of this world sees
[1:17:03] they might not see him in his word
[1:17:05] they'll see him when he when they stand
[1:17:08] before the judgment every man or seeing
[1:17:10] then but you may be before the rep's of
[1:17:13] the only manifestation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:15] see as he is you are in this world
[1:17:19] brother Branham said she is him adopted
[1:17:23] caught up into his likeness just like
[1:17:26] him
[1:17:27] be like Jesus and when the Hebrews son
[1:17:31] was adopted into the family the garment
[1:17:35] that father made a big scene of us if
[1:17:38] this is my son he's kind he looks just
[1:17:40] like
[1:17:40] we here is exactly what I wanted them to
[1:17:42] be when he was just a child
[1:17:44] and I had this thought in my mind of
[1:17:47] what my child would look like and that
[1:17:49] he would take over my family business
[1:17:51] and now he's here and so this is a big
[1:17:54] thing too far and so now father will
[1:17:56] take him out
[1:17:57] and he packs a finest garment and he
[1:17:59] arrays him in his finest garment this is
[1:18:02] my son he's going to take over hit that
[1:18:04] he has my inheritance and it was what
[1:18:07] was taking place on Mount
[1:18:08] Transfiguration when Peter James John
[1:18:12] and Peter they've Jesus was and his
[1:18:14] glorified body God was showing this is
[1:18:16] my this is my son and whom I am
[1:18:19] well-pleased and when the bride comes to
[1:18:22] this place is this should be arrayed in
[1:18:23] fine linen gamma because it's a wedding
[1:18:26] garment when you come to the place of
[1:18:28] adoption it's your marriage to Christ
[1:18:30] you come as just as he as you're in home
[1:18:36] and when you come to this position you
[1:18:39] are a very peculiar these people very
[1:18:42] strange very strange to the world nobody
[1:18:45] understands you and you were a royal
[1:18:48] priesthood there's something other than
[1:18:51] the law that makes you live a clean life
[1:19:00] and the Lord just gave me this little
[1:19:02] thought and it's an exodus 2830 and now
[1:19:05] shall put in the breasts place
[1:19:07] breastplate of judgement the Urim and
[1:19:10] Thummim and they shall be upon Aaron's
[1:19:12] heart when he goeth them before the Lord
[1:19:14] and Aaron shall bring the judgment of
[1:19:16] the children of Israel upon his heart
[1:19:18] before the Lord continually now in the
[1:19:21] Old Testament when somebody had a dream
[1:19:23] or a vision and they would bring it
[1:19:25] before Aaron and he had this it was like
[1:19:27] some lights that were on his chest and
[1:19:29] they would they would tell the vision
[1:19:31] and it was bright they would light up
[1:19:32] and they would know that it was right
[1:19:34] but we are called to be a royal priest
[1:19:37] and now when you come into this place of
[1:19:40] adoption there's something in your heart
[1:19:42] and when something's brought before you
[1:19:44] by the minister or somebody sharing and
[1:19:47] and it lights up and it sees a me and
[1:19:49] that's the truth or or it doesn't flash
[1:19:52] it's the person's telling you what
[1:19:54] they're believing and it doesn't flash
[1:19:56] because now there's something in your
[1:19:58] heart is a urine thumb and it's telling
[1:20:01] you whether this is right or not and
[1:20:03] it's it's letting you discern both good
[1:20:06] and evil
[1:20:07] not because you're scared that you're
[1:20:09] going to get a beating up from the Lord
[1:20:12] that's something that's within you I
[1:20:17] don't live a holy consecrated life
[1:20:19] because I feel the law as only my
[1:20:22] schoolmaster I love a consecrated life
[1:20:26] because I love God I want to know what
[1:20:29] he liked
[1:20:29] you know Easter when she when when she
[1:20:34] was just learning what the King likes
[1:20:36] you there were many girls there were
[1:20:38] many woman that were a spouse a Solomon
[1:20:42] there they were training to that poppy
[1:20:45] potential wife and they were probably
[1:20:49] all been silly and and wanted you know
[1:20:51] they had a image in their own mind of
[1:20:53] what the king would like you know they
[1:20:55] probably thought well if I just wear my
[1:20:57] top a little bit lower and this you know
[1:20:59] certain dress in a king will like me
[1:21:03] more but Esther didn't listen to what
[1:21:06] was in her own head she wanted to know
[1:21:09] she wanted a man to tell her what the
[1:21:13] King liked
[1:21:14] she wanted to know from her heart what
[1:21:16] the King liked and she found out what
[1:21:18] the King liked and the King chose her to
[1:21:21] be be his bride not because she had to
[1:21:23] do it she didn't have to do it but she
[1:21:26] wanted to know what the King liked and
[1:21:29] that's paid off later on because when
[1:21:33] all of Israel was in trouble and they
[1:21:35] were going to die and she hadn't been
[1:21:37] before the King for a long time and she
[1:21:39] was now again going to have to go before
[1:21:41] the presence of the king she could go
[1:21:43] and before the king and make a decision
[1:21:45] because she knew what the king was
[1:21:47] looking for she knew have I coming
[1:21:50] before the king that he's going to
[1:21:51] receive me I want to know that when I
[1:21:54] come and before the king he's receiving
[1:21:57] me because I'm manifesting what he has
[1:21:59] in his mind
[1:22:00] I'm manifesting the image that he wants
[1:22:02] me to look like I just pray that you
[1:22:10] know we can all come to that place of
[1:22:12] adoption because when the church comes
[1:22:14] to a place where it grows up from a
[1:22:16] little baby and to an adolescent and
[1:22:18] then it comes it's learned of God it's
[1:22:21] been through a period of justification
[1:22:23] it's been through a period of
[1:22:24] sanctification now it comes all the way
[1:22:26] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we
[1:22:29] get the church in that place where
[1:22:31] everybody is living under the baptism of
[1:22:33] the Holy Ghost I see it before you had
[1:22:36] the bat you have the Holy Ghost right
[1:22:37] from your birth you receive the Holy
[1:22:39] Ghost even a child when it is born it
[1:22:42] receives its spirit brother Brennan see
[1:22:43] but when you come up to that place of
[1:22:46] adoption now you become a manifestation
[1:22:48] of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[1:22:51] inside you is coming forth and making
[1:22:53] manifestation just like your father
[1:22:57] so don't think the devil hold you back
[1:23:00] don't they don't only don't trap you in
[1:23:03] Egypt don't mean don't stay there too
[1:23:05] long you stay there too long and you
[1:23:08] stuck that's somewhere that you can you
[1:23:10] can check out in check out anytime you
[1:23:13] like you can you can come to church for
[1:23:15] a few weeks but he'll never let you
[1:23:17] leave it has to be a consecration made
[1:23:22] from your heart as you love amen
[1:23:26] I love brother Andy would you come up
[1:23:33] and the musicians and we'll sing some
[1:23:34] songs and let's just make a consecration
[1:23:37] to the Lord say Lord receive me Lord I
[1:23:40] consecrate my life to you not because I
[1:23:43] have not because I fear you know not
[1:23:46] because I'm scared i i i worship you
[1:23:49] because I love you and I just want to
[1:23:51] express my love you and I want to learn
[1:23:55] of you not because you're beating me
[1:23:56] with it with a cane not because you're a
[1:23:59] schoolmaster and you're beating me but I
[1:24:01] want to serve you because I love and I
[1:24:07] want to walkin out I want to walk in the
[1:24:10] power of his resurrection so I just

[1:30:14] bless you so much for other james and my
[1:30:19] testimony is very big very very big but
[1:30:22] I'll make it short I mean that is the
[1:30:28] Wednesday night until now the Lord has
[1:30:32] has been wonderful to us and Dave I just
[1:30:37] yesterday sister Robin Cynthia daily a
[1:30:43] daily devotional from the book and it
[1:30:46] was reading the scripture was Psalm 1 1
[1:30:50] 6 I don't know if any of the few ready
[1:30:52] it was 1 1 6 and the verses that blessed
[1:30:56] me so much was from verse number 10 if
[1:30:59] I'm not mistaken amen
[1:31:01] I don't read it every day and and I know
[1:31:05] you do and also but yesterday's one the
[1:31:08] Lord made me to read it all of these and
[1:31:11] it touched my heart I don't know why but
[1:31:13] he just talked to my heart I was busy
[1:31:17] studying and I read that and he just
[1:31:20] stuck to my heart only later on I
[1:31:23] understood why the Lord wanted me to
[1:31:26] read it it was talking about giving
[1:31:29] thanks to God and making to appreciate
[1:31:35] all his benefits that he has given you
[1:31:37] and you know and he says I'm just
[1:31:40] paraphrasing that I was seeing and I'll
[1:31:42] praise him and I'll thank him in the
[1:31:44] midst of your people I'll and worship
[1:31:46] you or I'll thank you in Jerusalem can
[1:31:50] you remember that one so later on my
[1:31:56] wife sent me a message here that the
[1:31:58] immigration people have just approved
[1:32:00] our residence okay
[1:32:04] so I thought it was a joke
[1:32:08] so I thought it was not I thought she
[1:32:11] didn't see properly
[1:32:12] then she sent me a screenshot of her
[1:32:16] profile that has got to to deserves one
[1:32:20] my current work visa that shows that
[1:32:23] when I finished my studies in much sorry
[1:32:28] the visa was granted until twenty first
[1:32:32] twenty twenty one much so now it shows a
[1:32:36] new one that says residents approved so
[1:32:45] I thought the first thing that came to
[1:32:48] my mind was that that that this a
[1:32:50] scripture that I read in the morning
[1:32:52] that says from us give thanks to the
[1:32:54] Lord and and and and before his people
[1:32:58] and ensure glory to the Lord for all his
[1:33:00] benefits because I realized that he's
[1:33:05] the wonderful God and he's got so many
[1:33:07] ways to show you how much he loves us
[1:33:09] like my brother was preaching tonight
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:12] so it looks like the Lord is slowly he's
[1:33:15] slowly making as part of you sing we are
[1:33:25] now stuck with you looks like it's Muse
[1:33:33] now start with you but it's wonderful to
[1:33:38] to be stuck with one another because
[1:33:40] you're going to be stuck with each other
[1:33:42] through all eternity
[1:33:44] so with those few ways brothers and
[1:33:46] sisters it may not be such a big thing
[1:33:48] but for us it means a lot because so
[1:33:51] many people come to this country and
[1:33:54] they look for resilience and therefore
[1:33:55] this and that and there are much better
[1:33:57] people much better qualified people know
[1:34:00] eloquent than us so they can rest they
[1:34:03] don't get residuals some go home
[1:34:06] some get frustrated different things
[1:34:09] happen some of them they just approved
[1:34:11] the one partner and they disapproved a
[1:34:14] partner some of them they said no I
[1:34:16] discharge why are the eyes red you don't
[1:34:21] approve this one is sick
[1:34:23] so there's so many dynamics around the
[1:34:25] issue of residence we haven't received
[1:34:27] the letters yet we only saw the profile
[1:34:29] that said approved and we are taking it
[1:34:32] by faith that the Kiwis are too slow
[1:34:35] they'll send a letter C they'll send a
[1:34:40] letter soon but all we can say is that
[1:34:43] we want to give glory and honor and
[1:34:45] thanks give him to the Lord and the only
[1:34:49] place where we can do that is to come
[1:34:52] before his people according to that
[1:34:54] scripture of Psalm 1:1 six just from
[1:34:57] verse 10 to make its praises and glory
[1:35:00] and known before his people but this is
[1:35:03] where we meet God is an omniscient
[1:35:05] omnipresent God but if you want to meet
[1:35:08] him and talk to face him you see right
[1:35:12] now on facing him I'm talking to him
[1:35:14] because you are part of him
[1:35:17] so with those few words I want to thank
[1:35:19] you all of you for your for your an
[1:35:23] ending prayers and your life in prayers
[1:35:26] let's continue to pray for one another
[1:35:28] and I believe God is going to do more
[1:35:31] all these things they are happening in
[1:35:33] our lives it's not much about our
[1:35:37] worldly well-being of course it's about
[1:35:40] our worldly welfare but it is really
[1:35:43] about our heavenly welfare if if God can
[1:35:49] do anything to help you to see that
[1:35:52] we've got a home we need to come to that
[1:35:54] stage of adoption so that we are ready
[1:35:58] when the lifeboat come we'll jump in and
[1:36:00] we have gone if the Lord can do anything
[1:36:03] you know if if we can do anything you
[1:36:06] will do it for you to see that he loves
[1:36:09] you and your journey doesn't end up here
[1:36:12] so thank you so much and may God richly
[1:36:14] bless you and there we are happy
[1:36:22] I'm a Kingdom priests to God amen
[1:36:26] hallelujah to the lamb list and we'll
