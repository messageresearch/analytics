refuge and strength amen thank you brother Jos thank you musicians amen welcome to this communion evening amen praise the Lord great to have everyone here amen Let's uh let's just turn into the scripture sorry I don't have a slideshow I thought I made one but evidently no so um let's go to Exodus chapter 12 I want to continue I want to speak about applying the token which um which is really where I should have got to uh on Sunday but any who so Exodus 12 I'm going to read just 21 and 22 and then we're going to as a context we're going to go to Esther chapter 7 and so let's just read Exodus 12 and 21 and 22 um I can find it here and it says here then then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take your lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of hsip and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out uh at the door of his house until the morning amen and then we're going to go to uh uh Esther chapter 7 and and verse one just as a bit of a um context here so Easter Easter 7 and one and this is just the context he says so the king is there all there he says so the king and hmon came to came to banquet with Esther the queen remember Queen Esther invited them to this banquet and the King said again unto Esther on the second day of the banquet of wine what is thy petition Queen Esther and it shall be granted then and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to half of the Kingdom yeah to half the kingdom then Esther the queen answered and said if I have found favor in thy sight oh King and if it pleased the king let my life be given uh let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request for we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we have been sold for Bond men and Bond woman I had held my tongue although the enemy could uh not countervail the king's damage then the king of hazaras answered and said unto Esther the queen who is he and where is he that does presume in his heart to do so and isther said the adversary and in enemy is this wicked hmon then hmon was afraid before the king and the queen and the King arising from the banquet of wine and his wrath went into the palace garden and hmon stood up to make requests for his life to Esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king then the king returned out of the palace Garden into the place of the banquet of the wine and hmon was Fallen upon the bed where where on Esther was then said the king will he Force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of the king's mouth they covered Hon's face and habon one of the chamber I mean yeah chamber said before the king behold also the Gallow 50 cubits High which hmon had had made for Mori who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of hmon then the king said hang him thereon so they hanged hmon on The Gallows that he prepared for morai then was the king's wrath pacified praise God Amen so let's bow heads in a word of prayer this night amen Lord Jesus thank you Lord truly there's none like thee Lord there's nothing no one anywhere comp pi to Lord who you are and the promise we have in you and father as we approach your communion table Lord I pray you prepare our hearts father Lord we just commit Our Lives completely into your hands once again we ask you to forgive us of our wrongs our sins our iniquities Lord cover us in your blood Lord father I pray this would be a very special communion night for each and every one of us Lord and I pray you'd bless the reading of your word which we have just read Lord For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to I want to speak about applying the token now we know brother Braham he speaks about apply the token with your prayer who's you know anyone who's heard the message the token or anything you brother BR makes these statements you got to apply present your token with your prayer now we know this is not a a just a phrase you say as you pray but the token we know is the Holy Ghost and so to apply the token is to let God take over your life and the situation you're in because if we look at uh where we read there in Exodus the Israelites had two options they could either apply the blood and be safe under the blood because when the blood when the lamb was killed and when the when the blood was applied to the house they were actually giving preeminence to the lamb in their home the lamb was number one he was the head of the home and when they applied the blood the saving power and delivering power and protecting power in that blood of the Lamb came into manifestation so they did not have to do anything else but to apply the blood that's all they needed to do now so there was two options one they could they could apply the blood and let off the pressure and let the blood do the work they could do that or they could stand on the outside of the house and say I'm going to defend my house from the death angel cuz I'm a I'm a circumcised Covenant Jew one would have died and the other would have lived the one who tried to protect the house in their own strength would have died right because they came out from outside the blood those who are under the blood were safe and this is what happens with Believers unfortunately is what happens is people try and protect their house in their own strength have they prayed long enough have they been dilatory enough have they done what they required to do in their own strength and it tears people apart because instead of trusting in the blood of the Lamb they're trusting in their own ability to keep living out of the home to keep the token applied and it's all about them have they prayed enough Have you listened enough have you read enough we all know the pressure that comes right but but but that's a humanistic pressure of human ability trying to keep the death angel away God never intended your ability to keep the death angel away God intended the blood of the Lamb to keep the death angel away that's why he said apply the blood Amen in the evening time so you have those two options now Jesus uh if I can find it he would he would rebuke the scribes and Pharisees speaking about how they they devour widow's houses let's see if I can find this here if my if my uh yeah Matthew Matthew 23 and4 he says W unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you devour widow's houses and for a pretense which is a show make long prayer therefore you shall receive the greater damnation now to to devour a Widow's house we know he was Naturally Speaking of basically he devoured the Widow's house taking all the Widow had right so really it is what it is it's it's actually targeting the vulnerable able making them to do something instead of applying the blood cuz when something is devoured like have you ever see like a I mean you see a a pride of lions devour a wilderbeast or something it was a wilderbeast then it gets chewed up so what it was is not what it becomes it gets devoured right so what happens is when people try and they come under a a a Pharisee Spirit trying to in their own uh you know what do you call it sincerity trying to protect their house In Their Own Strength their Joy gets devoured their peace gets devoured their Victory gets devoured why because they've come under the wrong way of doing it but those who are under the blood amen doesn't mean You' stop praying doesn't mean you just become indifferent doesn't mean you become LAX but it's different when you pray under the blood than when you pray Through Your Own Strength because your own strength is you know I see a timer and I pray have I prayed long enough have I done this enough have I you know it turns into almost like like a Muslim kind of tradition of I got to pray five times a day prayer is not NE it can be long it can be short but the main thing is you touch Heaven amen right because remember prayer is a mighty weapon I think you it's a it's a lyric from um I can't remember her name but she wrote the song it'll take a stronger wi than this right and and and prayer is a mighty weapon but it puts God in control so real prayer puts God in control of your situation amen amen because really prayer is Lord change my mind to match your mind in the Battle of in that's right and you and you let God take control so when you're applying the token you're praying in faith committing the whole situation into the Lord's control because remember when they killed the lamb the lamb became the head of the house the lamb the blood had preeminence right amen so this is this is really what applying the token means is you let you let the Holy Ghost take over your battle amen amen it's I mean it's very it's very it's very uh straightforward but you can either do it in your own strength and be devoured or you can trust the blood and let off the pressure and rejoice amen right you can either be under the token of the Holy Ghost Rejoice or you can be devoured busting apart because it's the the pressure is on you the pressure is not on me the pressure is on the lamb amen amen the blood's been applied the Holy Spirit abides amen hallelujah hallelujah so you can now trust now in his ability praise God H so we don't want to stand on the outside the door of our house to protect our family with our own strength I'm going to be dilator I'm going to be devel I'm going to be sincere we can be all those things but don't step outside the blood see we're not looking for the devil to fight that's right the devil come and fight you he'll become looking for you right but the thing is we don't I'm not on a mission humanly to uh storm hell because if I do anything in My Own Strength it's going to miserably fail right like brother bam uh makes a statement here and if I'm sorry I don't have it up here but um he says now he says he says um he so he's talking about a a a young ladies um come for prayer and and and he instructs her now just drive down a post right there in your mind on this platform tonight the prayer of faith was prayed for me and Satan the blood of the Lamb was put between me and you so you might as well go Hallelujah you can come up to that post and yeah but the thing is you here will come a sip uh them he says don't punch at it don't punch in it you punch a snake see you if you just keep saying I rebuke you I rebuke you he'll bite you see just ignore him walk away from him he's defeated anyhow there you are don't punch at him see oh and say oh the Lord rebuke him the Lord rebuke him h no no don't do that see you're weakening what you really believe by doing that right you got to realize when when when the prayer of faith is made right you got to put a steak down God you heard my prayer I'm under the token you hear my prayer it's done go on Victorious AML right but if you keep looking it because what happens is the devil wants you to keep rebuking him and that weakens what you really believe is because your focus goes from the one who brings Deliverance to the one who's tormenting you right so it actually makes the devil a lot bigger than what he really is ien so we've got to keep our focus on the blood of the lamb and not the enemy amen but people get you know I'm going to rebuke the devil I'm going to deal with them you know when you come under the anointing that's the time to speak amen because remember we read that there in um we read that there in ether because E before this banquet of wine she knew hmon had had had had caused a death sentence to be signed upon herself and her people but she was going to apply the token you see she was going to bring the king into her battle see she did not decide well are my servants I'm going to storm Hon's house and we're going to deal with with them she would have died she would have failed am mean Hon's guards would have wiped her out and wiped her servants out but what did she do she didn't humanly fight it but she came under the blood amen how did she come under the blood she called the token the king amen into the battle right she had a banquet of wine amen and that moved the heart of the king so what happened now the enemy was there she came in prayer to the king I'm just kind of bringing into our language right we know the story she invited hmon and to a banquet of wine right a banquet of wine we know is the stimulation of the revelation of the Holy Ghost right so when the spirit of God begins to move we begin to Rejoice maybe a song maybe a message maybe at church whatever you know and we get inspired we get in you know we begin to Rejoice God anchors Revelation our heart that's the time to speak to your enemy that's the time to talk to your king your token amen and and tell him what the enemy is doing in your life right so she applied the token by bringing the king into her battle amen and then the king said what's your request Esther so what's she doing she's not moving carnally now she's moving in the spirit right and now she speaks under the inspiration of what's needed for that moment saying this man yeah this wicked man hymon is against me he's trying to destroy me and you know destroy my people amen what' she do she applied the token right she did not try and do it in her own strength yeah you'd say of course that'd be ridiculous for to grab a sword and try and take out hmon himself but that's just as ridiculous as us humanly trying to protect our family you'll drive yourself mad yeah you will drive yourself mad if you're so you get so concerned about the age we live and our families and all these things don't don't go mad by it apply the token amen trust the protecting delivering power of the blood of the Lamb amen amen that he will he will intercede and he'll work on your behalf amen and he will take the battle under his control you say well what about here well that's nice for Esther what about here well I remember one prayer meeting a few years ago sister Vanessa replied the token and having prayer prayer meeting here you just here in the in you know in the house brother kabin wasn't even saved them what happened the presence of God came down she called out what was she doing claiming her family claiming her husband what was happening she was applying the token Hallelujah here he is and yubin praise the Lord Amen brother arand we know the story his parents came here the first time fighting with his dad and walked outside and he said God your Prophet said I can call you on a conference what was he doing he was applying the token by inviting God into the battle Hallelujah e I'm just going to use the just the different examples but the same thing because you'll see this is how you apply the token right so now what so so what did he do he he called God on the scene he was applying the token and we know the rest of the story God dealt with his parents they got baptized and before they flew back to South Africa you know they're they're different people today why because someone applied the token right and maybe didn't know the mechanics of it but the Dynamics is the important thing Hallelujah we know dve is not here tonight but what happened begin to apply the token the token the Holy Ghost begin to work through different parts of the body Hallelujah and he's been transformed by the Holy Ghost you know one day he said to his dad I'll never serve God what's he doing now serving God what happened the token was applied amen hallelujah you know brother Braham when he was grounded there he's flying and he's grounded at the airport in Memphis there's a there's a woman there and she and she's got a son who's on his deathbed what is she doing you know no doubt growing up you know she would say to him now come on you know come to church let's pray together she was living her life in front of him and brother Braham says here if I can find it he says now he says then you apply the token at wait he says get Ready Clean Up believe it let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take effect yes sir then applying the token in prayer with consideration with with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take it's it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband when you talk to your wife you talk to this loved one believing it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord apply it and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it oh you are you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around your of power that when you walk people know you're a Christian amen they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it see that's it see the token has a power it's the it's the presence of God himself in your life and when you walk around the world you go to your job you go to school you wherever you are people know there's a difference what's this guy's different she's different and it's more than how we dress there's a life amen that's on display Hallelujah and even it says in Timothy 3 it says not a novice L being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are without least he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil so he must have a good report of them without amen so when people see you they see that's a Christian I may not agree with what they believe I might think they've gone off the deep end but that's a Christian how they conduct themselves what they do what they say their honesty Integrity all those things is a proof amen so so she no doubt was living a life in front of her son but the son went Wayward now it's amazing God will allow things it looks like things are going wrong but they're actually going right amen humanly we say man this is this is bad but God says no he's actually right on schedule she's right on schedule amen she's where I need her to be amen the thief on the cross he had to end up there he wasn't falsely charged and ended up there he he he was really a thief he really deserved he said we deserve to be here to the other Thief right so his life was actually programmed that way for him to end up there to see the lamb before amen the Lord Jesus gives us life so God knows what he's doing so you know no doubt she would have told him come on you know let's go to church let's pray together let's read the Bible and do the best she can at his mom but you know it seemed like he was just going the other Direction anyway but then but then she she she applied the token and so she brought God into the battle she brought God into the battle maybe it was when when when he was young started to call upon God that God would come on the scene but God answers in his time God answers in his time amen so you may appli the token years ago don't don't ever let it in your mind saying it hasn't taken effect it's not working God in his season he may let someone run a long time for many years but he'll get them am amen do we not believe that amen hallelujah so now she's she's praying and you know she prayed through Hallelujah she sees a vision of brother Brown walking down her Street in front of her house with a briefcase you know her suon he has no idea that's just taking place he's on a plane it's you it's grounded there at the airport you know he starts walking cuz you know there's a big delay or whatever and he leaves his briefcase here at the airport or wherever he's staying and you know he's just looking at a hunting uh shop he's he's window shopping you know then he hears a voice say keep walking he hears it again he starts walking it's a lot of miles apparently from where he heard the voice to where he ended up at her house but he just started walking what was happening because she applied the token Elijah was on her on his way amen because what happened is when she applied the token she identified herself in the scripture I'm that shite woman amen and then she's leaning there over the gate there's joing her back because before on she got that dream or that Vision she's waiting for it to be fulfilled she's waiting she's waiting and then he's walking down the street ends up in this colored District way from wherever he is but he's just following that voice and then and then and then you know he says good morning Auntie you and and she says good morning Parson he stops how do you know I'm a Parson well I had a dream and you know here you are and where's your briefcase I saw you with a briefcase it's it's back at the hotel and you know he comes inside he says I've been in King's palaces but this house was a home little shotgun Shanty but God was in that place and you know he be you know she be to Sor describe to brother Brown the situation CU her son was on the bed crying it's dark and here it's dark and on his deathbed because of a social disease he picked up and you know but but then you know um she she said you know I'm like the shunamite woman in the Bible but where's my Elijah there he was right in front of her amen and then she and then you know she said well will you pray and you know she prayed first and he said you've you could tell he has she sorry has talked to the Lord before yeah amen and then brother Braham started to pray and then when he was praying Amen brother BR said he uh put his hands on the uh son's feet started praying for him and he started praying and then the boy was saying it's dark and he said it's getting lighter mama and he came to healthy normal and well years later he bumped into brother bumped into on a train station he said I'm not only healed I'm saved amen hallelujah what happened she applied the token in spite of what was going on she didn't let that make her burst because the pressure wasn't on her it was on her token Hallelujah it was on the Lord himself right so she did not she did not know the mechanics of it but she sure knew the Dynamics of it amen praise the Lord that's why we must present our token with our prayers which is that's why let the Lord take over your prayer life let him pray through you Amen Let Him inspire you What's happen then it's no longer you praying it's God praying amen hallelujah amen then we can stand with confidence saying Thank You Lord the answer is on its way or rather you've given the answer but it's going to come into manifestation the Lord amen I'm going to leave it there right but that's how that's applying the to you say I've been doing that for years good praise the Lord amen but you see what it is in summary amen you you let God take over your battle just like Esther did that's applying the token I know it's a simple thing but it's a powerful thing so you got two choices you can go outside and fight the death angel or you can stay under the blood trusting the power the saving delivering power of the blood of the Lamb what are you going to do I think I'll stay under the blood am cuz it works amen praise the Lord amen so let's turn to let's turn to 1 Corinthians 11 shall we because I'm so thankful I still you know brother arand and I were talking as we were we were we were bring tonight this token Works am this message Works Hallelujah we are we are living proof that's right that it works it's not an empty thing brother good many here sister Shannon one of those same prayer meetings called where's the god of Elijah that's right he brought she invited the Lord of hosts into her battle amen that works Hallelujah we are so many testimonies of the token coming and working God's delivering power the power of that token grabbing lives saving lives delivering lives amen so this this ain't a this a this ain't just a you know Pie in the Sky kind of deal this is it really does work and I'm so thankful you know we sing a song maybe we'll sing it um before we actually uh well after the communion or yo but yo the blood will never lose its power I mean we never ever have to come to a day where the blood just vanishes from our lives and we're going to go fight this battle in our own strength no the blood will never lose its power it doesn't matter what the what comes out of the pit of Hell it cannot conquer the blood of Jesus Christel amen Lord amen so let's go to First Corinthians amen and let's um let's let's go to verse 23 of uh 1 Corinthians 11: 23 he says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup which he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you drink this bread and eat sorry for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we sh we are chastened of the Lord and we that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so we want to examine ourselves before we come to the communion table we got to say Lord examine my life Lord if there's any sin in my life take it from me Lord forgive me Lord cleanse me of my iniquity Lord this is not a small thing that we come together and take the communion because the Lord paid a great price for us to receive the token of his life amen to protect us from the death angel to keep us from from you know from The Works of the enemy amen that he would deliver us that the the blood of the Lamb came at great price for us so all I can say is thank you Lord L amen so let's um if the deacons could come forward or amen or or just brother kabin I guess he's working there and we just want to stand we want to pray for the pray for the um bread unle bread and pray for the wine amen we [Music] know Jesus Son of God we bless your name come abide with us and fill this place give To Us forgi by your [Music] Gra e
