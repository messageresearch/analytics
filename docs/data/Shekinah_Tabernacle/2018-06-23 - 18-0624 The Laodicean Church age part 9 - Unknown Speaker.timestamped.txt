[19:48] well
[19:49] [Music]
[19:54] [Music]
[19:59] Singles annecy just the people
[20:11] goes on I see
[20:13] [Music]

[20:23] [Music]
[20:24] we all in my
[20:31] [Music]
[20:45] see Hosanna well sing
[20:50] yes
[21:01] [Music]
[21:08] Hosanna to the king
[21:11] Thank You Lord hallelujah glory well at
[21:15] this time I would like to invite brother
[21:16] Andy to the pulpit to give his report so
[21:19] he may be seated
[21:37] amen praise the Lord
[21:41] well do you know you already saw the
[21:45] reports that I was led to sin which was
[21:50] actually quite fun I enjoyed that it
[21:53] helped a lot and and being able to share
[21:59] what was happening and that the church
[22:01] could be with me on the trip and we
[22:03] could we could fight the battle together
[22:06] amen because it was a field that and as
[22:10] a field of work that has got many
[22:14] challenges on every level and you know
[22:20] the Lord really undertook for this trip
[22:23] and you know the itinerary so I don't
[22:25] need to tell you what happened because
[22:26] you've heard all of the things that
[22:28] happen but more it may be just a
[22:32] personal note on some of the things that
[22:38] actually the from my heart rather than
[22:43] just the facts so we obviously we got
[22:50] into the country and you know brother
[22:52] Adrian had been always telling me and
[22:54] sharing openly with everybody how this
[22:58] was the hardest field that he's ever had
[22:59] to work in because of the culture of the
[23:04] people and the culture of the Christians
[23:08] in Vietnam is as they want two things
[23:13] they want money and they want to build
[23:15] their Kingdom and then but I've filtered
[23:17] all through there as the bride and and
[23:22] you it's very difficult to find because
[23:26] they all act like the bride they all act
[23:28] like they want the word they want the
[23:30] truth and but they're actually
[23:35] professional swindlers you could say
[23:40] mixed all one through there and so you
[23:43] have to be your tact it has to be
[23:46] different and so this trip when we got
[23:51] there because Adrienne brother Adrienne
[23:53] has been working in that field for three
[23:55] years and really hasn't seen no one's
[23:58] really seen any substantial fruit that's
[24:03] lasted because things just get torn up
[24:05] all the time but this this trip when we
[24:10] arrived there were people that had
[24:15] previously been of a different nature
[24:19] had been changed and there were people
[24:24] and groups that the fruit of the Holy
[24:28] Spirit was starting to show and so that
[24:32] was really awesome I we one of the there
[24:37] was a few highlights and four and I'm
[24:43] just going on by the history of what
[24:45] brother Adrian had told me what it was
[24:48] like because I can only judge by what I
[24:50] see and and plus what I did on the Skype
[24:56] meetings with the people but being on
[24:58] the Skype meeting and being there in
[25:00] person is like a million times different
[25:02] because you can see the people who hang
[25:05] out with the people and you can really
[25:08] get a feel for the atmosphere and the
[25:10] church and groups and the living
[25:14] conditions and the culture and their
[25:17] challenges because it really is not like
[25:20] here really isn't like it this is we're
[25:24] really blessed really blessed man we are
[25:28] and you know nothing like a bit of
[25:29] contrast to make you appreciate what you
[25:31] have man but the unity is a
[25:35] responsibility that we have worthless
[25:38] blessing and God uses countries like
[25:41] this to take the message all over the
[25:43] world because we have the resource to do
[25:45] it and he we have been exposed to the
[25:49] message firsthand and the Lord has
[25:54] worked in our lives so that we can
[25:56] participate in the different forms of
[25:59] how we participate
[26:00] whether we're on the field or we're
[26:02] praying or we're giving or we're
[26:03] whatever we're doing to support the work
[26:07] that goes on all around the world God
[26:10] uses nations like this to actually go
[26:12] there because he and he's given that
[26:15] advantage not for our comfort not for us
[26:17] to just sit here and get fat on the word
[26:20] you know it's actually there's a purpose
[26:22] for us like to be what would to have
[26:26] what we have it's because God is going
[26:28] to use us for different things and I
[26:31] realized that so much when we went there
[26:33] because these people 1,000 percent
[26:37] disadvantaged and every area than us and
[26:42] but do you know when the word comes when
[26:46] the word comes things all change for
[26:48] them and when they get the holy spirit
[26:52] everything changes and when and the the
[26:58] the real the when they get the Holy
[27:03] Spirit but to get them to a point where
[27:05] they can get the Holy Spirit they have
[27:08] to really throw away that old culture
[27:10] that culture of I want money you guys
[27:13] pay me you know because that really was
[27:16] a it's been a privilege issue as like
[27:19] this is this is this is basically the
[27:21] expectation of a Vietnamese Church and
[27:23] these guys are spiritual people and they
[27:25] have testimonies and they they go back
[27:29] ties ins of people and do all the stuff
[27:31] and they've baptized correctly right but
[27:34] their expectation is that when we come
[27:37] we not only bring the word but we bring
[27:39] the food and we bring the supply of all
[27:42] of the resource and pay our own way pay
[27:44] everything pay everybody's petrol to get
[27:46] there this is what it's like and so you
[27:50] know when you turn that tap off and all
[27:53] you're bringing is the word at sins a
[27:55] real ripple effect and and so brother
[27:58] Adrian of Falcon is hard about a year
[28:00] ago to turn that tap off really well
[28:02] actually since he was there he slowly
[28:05] moved towards turning that tap off of
[28:07] giving the money and it's caused storms
[28:09] but now the storms are just settling and
[28:12] now the people
[28:14] they the the people that were all about
[28:17] money are kind of gone into the
[28:18] background and tried to cause
[28:20] revolutions and all the stuff but the
[28:22] true people the true children of God
[28:26] that want the word they want Christ they
[28:28] want the reality those people came
[28:31] forward those people came those people
[28:34] invited us back those people we had
[28:36] meetings with and brother Adrian see
[28:37] that's finally turned a corner where
[28:39] that whole atmosphere has been pushed
[28:43] back and the people that even stirred up
[28:46] these revolutions against the work the
[28:50] people that work because they Overlord
[28:51] at other people when there were groups
[28:53] under guys and they keep people under
[28:55] them and they didn't they felt because
[28:57] they we were connected to these people
[28:59] that they couldn't approach us directly
[29:02] but and then these people that because
[29:04] they were about money they started
[29:06] trying to push against us these people
[29:08] said to them would bring us directly and
[29:12] say I feel happy to ring you now because
[29:14] you're not dealing with this brother all
[29:15] that brother I feel happy to call you
[29:18] directly and so these and they were true
[29:20] and they want it all they want is the
[29:22] word and so it cut off these people
[29:25] because they were actually you know over
[29:28] lording all these other groups that cut
[29:30] them off and push them out so that these
[29:33] people that really didn't want the word
[29:34] could come forth hear the word and get
[29:37] born again because they were there was
[29:40] no other motive in their mind they
[29:43] weren't sitting in the pew because they
[29:46] knew they were going to get paid
[29:47] something for it they were there because
[29:49] they want the word and now that that's
[29:52] happening there is fruit starting to
[29:55] come and and I just want to thank you so
[29:58] much for your prayers because you know
[30:00] there was situations there where it was
[30:02] a showdown it was a real showdown and at
[30:05] what they weren't pulling that God's
[30:07] Spirit was anointing and pushing and
[30:10] ministering under a great Liberty
[30:13] actually amazing Liberty you know you
[30:16] wouldn't think you'd have liberty in a
[30:17] hostile environment and for me it was a
[30:20] it was a you know probably on a larger
[30:24] scale you know when when preaching in
[30:26] the pulpit that was the fear
[30:28] time for me to experience how in a
[30:31] hostile environment God can you can be
[30:34] an absolute Liberty to minister the word
[30:36] under such a powerful anointing and it's
[30:39] just opening these things up and and
[30:42] he's dealing with us right and out of
[30:44] the groups you'd find like two people
[30:47] that were really you know actually
[30:50] connected and they and those are the
[30:53] ones you could see them though the ones
[30:55] that invited us back took our minister
[30:57] and their churches so yeah that was that
[31:01] was one of the awesome highlights
[31:03] actually was that meeting in Sapa which
[31:06] was right at the top by the Chinese
[31:07] border and there was 40 ministers and
[31:12] these were ministers from like a
[31:13] denominational the Church of Vietnam one
[31:19] of the government style churches that
[31:20] are under government control basically
[31:23] and they're very kind of they're kind of
[31:25] a formal church and they have the Roman
[31:27] Catholic baptism and things like that
[31:29] but the way you know the Lord just
[31:33] opened his word to them and revealed
[31:35] himself and it was there it was it was a
[31:38] very special time and yeah we got two
[31:41] invitations back all of them got the
[31:43] message given to them on SD cards so we
[31:46] have the six hundred messages of
[31:48] Vietnamese translated onto into
[31:51] Vietnamese on the SD card and that's
[31:53] both in written and audio plus the Bible
[31:56] an audio and we were able to give them
[31:58] out so that's just awesome because you
[32:01] know everyone's working together the the
[32:03] giving that people give to these works
[32:06] and things like that that all helps to
[32:08] support these works and to be able to
[32:10] give the message out into these people's
[32:12] language as amazing because they need to
[32:14] hear the voice they've got to hear they
[32:17] need to have something that's outside of
[32:19] their usual teaching because once
[32:24] they're tapped into that and God's the
[32:26] bridegroom call comes through the
[32:28] message you know and it's going to bring
[32:30] the people out so that was one of the
[32:33] highlights another highlight was there
[32:35] was a brother who's been basically
[32:39] twenty years now now this is this is
[32:42] this will give you an idea of what it's
[32:44] like there 20 years he's been listening
[32:46] to the message his there's been
[32:48] missionaries going in there bringing the
[32:50] message only three months ago he changed
[32:55] that's 20 years of money taking money
[33:01] taking money putting on a front to get
[33:05] money and you end and it's it's very
[33:07] clear because of being under other
[33:09] people that were higher you could say in
[33:11] a hierarchical system that they put in
[33:14] place that was basically transferring
[33:19] that culture down and making sure that
[33:21] they're always calling for money three
[33:24] months ago this this brother and went
[33:29] from being in that money type of mode to
[33:33] coming into a Holy Spirit mode and
[33:36] actually we were we had a meeting and
[33:40] brother Adrian ancestor fall were both
[33:43] pleasantly surprised at the change of
[33:46] the whole church everyone there there
[33:49] was like seriously I felt like you know
[33:51] the three angels that came to Abraham
[33:54] and Abraham just did all the stuff with
[33:56] him I felt like that it was like wow
[33:58] there's something special here and I was
[34:00] surprised because they were telling me I
[34:02] we're only going there out of a token
[34:04] you know because they were expecting to
[34:06] them to be the same but go here and
[34:09] minister the word and was almost like
[34:11] one last time almost you know and we get
[34:13] there and it's changed and it was like
[34:15] you were welcomed and they wanted you
[34:17] there not because of us but they wanted
[34:19] the word and we were and we had the
[34:22] service and the Holy Ghost just came
[34:23] down into the service during the worship
[34:25] and from there it was just Liberty and
[34:29] they were rejoicing in the word and it
[34:31] was amazing and that shows that just
[34:34] shows you what it's like there that's 20
[34:36] years of ministry going in there for
[34:40] years and years and years and then
[34:42] finally through the the reason the Lord
[34:45] dealt with them and he's telling us his
[34:47] testimony how he went through basically
[34:50] heavy heavy trial so six months he went
[34:54] through heavy trials and then
[34:55] came out a son of God came out converted
[34:59] came out from something real and not
[35:01] didn't want us there to try and take
[35:03] money and the Lord was able to minister
[35:06] there on honor on a heavenly economy you
[35:11] know and because this is liberating to
[35:13] people
[35:14] a heavenly economy Matthew 6 you know
[35:18] the economy of Matthew 6 don't worry
[35:19] about all these natural things put God
[35:22] first and all the stuff will be added
[35:25] because he doesn't want our worship to
[35:27] be contaminated with worry about natural
[35:29] things he wants us to be completely
[35:32] putting him first being generous and our
[35:37] giving to the to the Lord and then
[35:40] everything else will be added and these
[35:43] you know obviously in a lot more detail
[35:46] in ministry that came out but they were
[35:51] really capturing that because the
[35:54] opposite way that they were doing was
[35:56] cursing them financially because they
[35:59] were taking using ministers instead of
[36:01] giving to missionaries to help them they
[36:04] were taking from them and then they
[36:06] can't come under the blessing of of
[36:09] God's provision like that and now this
[36:12] this brother and his church they've
[36:15] changed and now God can actually
[36:18] supernaturally provide for them and and
[36:20] they've come into a new economy but not
[36:22] just financially but spiritually as well
[36:25] and so that was another highlight a real
[36:28] blessing especially for brother Adrian
[36:30] who's been here for a long time to see
[36:33] the change and then another brother
[36:37] brother fook his name is David he's got
[36:42] a piece I mean there's lots of other
[36:45] stories but I you know you've heard them
[36:47] already and I'll put them in the I'm
[36:49] gonna do a proper report in the beer now
[36:50] but I'll just do another highlight well
[36:54] you know the story of the of the sister
[36:56] that had the dream you know that was
[37:00] awesome it was so called we were you
[37:02] know I was actually you know we need to
[37:05] know that it's already happened you feel
[37:06] like menaces we're
[37:07] happen I'm I'm in this it was like that
[37:10] it was like we were inside the vision
[37:13] and it was really cool it happened about
[37:15] three times at least two times on the
[37:17] trip well I was actually sitting in a
[37:19] cafe in Saigon somewhere just north of
[37:25] Saigon and I'm sitting in this cafe
[37:27] having a jasmine tea and it was like I
[37:33] said to brother Adrian already I was
[37:39] like you know when that happens it's
[37:40] like you're you're in the mind of God
[37:42] you know and the intern of mine and yeah
[37:45] it was there that we discovered this
[37:48] this brother so he had been opposed
[37:52] not opposing the message but resisting
[37:54] the message and he had his eyes on
[37:57] another man being Elijah and this is a
[38:00] Negro man from somewhere in Africa very
[38:06] prosperity very prosperity preaching and
[38:13] by the Adriane three months ago preached
[38:15] the five comings of Elijah and the power
[38:18] of God came down into the church so
[38:20] strongly that the whole church was on
[38:22] the ground screaming out to God under
[38:25] the power of God and repenting of this
[38:28] other Elijah but the pastor wasn't the
[38:32] pastor was the only one that didn't and
[38:33] then since Adrian left the Lord put her
[38:38] on Adrian's heart know he knew that this
[38:40] guy is this man's gonna go through some
[38:42] heavy correction by the Lord and he did
[38:45] the Lord just dealt with him for three
[38:47] months he went through absolute trials
[38:50] and and then survived so when we came
[38:54] back he started translating for us at
[38:56] the start of the trip
[38:57] brother agency if this guy has changed
[38:59] he's completely different I even noticed
[39:01] it and because he had translated for us
[39:03] on skype but then he had gone off and
[39:05] furnished because of all the stuff that
[39:07] was going on he had finished and he had
[39:09] put his businesses and everything first
[39:11] before the work of the Lord and so and
[39:13] then and and and so when we came back
[39:16] brother you said this brother is
[39:18] different
[39:19] something's happen and he was all
[39:22] completely changed and so we he we left
[39:27] him and did our big tour of Vietnam
[39:29] right up to the top came right back down
[39:31] through and then we got we came back to
[39:34] him and in the process of that trip
[39:38] since the fall you know the Lord had led
[39:41] it in such a way that sister Phan would
[39:43] no longer be going on any more trips
[39:45] with us because it's just too hard for
[39:47] her and she was under this Vietnamese
[39:50] attack because of the climate that you
[39:53] work under there the political climate
[39:56] is very hard and there's a lot of
[39:59] opposition and so she was she's under
[40:02] like super attack from all these people
[40:04] and just directly insulting her and
[40:06] everything that's really intense and so
[40:09] she said she just can't do it anymore
[40:10] so from basically from her doing all of
[40:13] that because she's got an administration
[40:14] gift she can organize all the hotels and
[40:16] everything really and translate for us
[40:18] to get us around and wait from her to
[40:23] now here's this brother David who's got
[40:25] two big 18-wheeler trucks in a bear taxi
[40:28] business we said to him we asked them
[40:32] will you come with us on our trips full
[40:34] time and he said yes and that's like a
[40:37] miracle because you know this for him to
[40:39] say yes he's got to put down his whole
[40:40] business and do it out of love for the
[40:44] Lord and and he and it was just amazing
[40:47] that the Lord actually because of all
[40:50] the stuff he went through he realized
[40:51] that to put God first was like it
[40:55] doesn't matter what it what you think if
[40:57] God's calling you to do something you do
[41:00] that because he's going to actually
[41:02] supernaturally undertake for your life
[41:05] and he's and he said yes oh I'll come
[41:08] with you
[41:08] on all of you right around the country
[41:11] so that was an awesome development then
[41:13] we had some meetings at his house and
[41:15] found out that he has accepted that
[41:18] brother branham is Elijah and his church
[41:22] is listening to the message their Bible
[41:24] studying and you can see the character
[41:27] and the church you can see the condition
[41:31] of the fellowship and
[41:32] the character of the sisters and the
[41:35] fellowship as just that's amazing
[41:37] Annie and brother agent said if you
[41:40] would be as six months ago you would not
[41:41] even recognize them this is the change
[41:44] that job God has made and he said this
[41:46] is a corner this is like something
[41:48] that's happened he said this country is
[41:50] going into a new season it's going it's
[41:53] coming into a new season finally after
[41:56] all of the bloodbath that it's been
[41:59] through because it's been very hard so
[42:01] keep praying for them and just keep
[42:04] praying that the Lord will because these
[42:07] these churches those just the highlights
[42:10] but there was about four three other
[42:11] fellowships or two other fellowships
[42:13] that are starting up now as a real godly
[42:18] biblical church there's a church like
[42:21] this but and it's anticipable
[42:24] some of them have pastors and some of
[42:26] them don't have pastors yet so but they
[42:29] are they have a vision and there might
[42:31] only be eight of them but they've got a
[42:32] vision and they they they know what's
[42:35] right and so it's just starting and
[42:38] these people are not in it for the money
[42:39] these people are in it because of the
[42:41] heart of God
[42:42] and so please pray that the Lord just
[42:45] keep praying that the Lord will just
[42:48] develop these people and keep them safe
[42:50] because yeah you know it's not easy it's
[42:53] not easy at all and yeah praise the Lord
[42:57] I'll leave it there you can read the
[42:59] beer now

[55:28] we're going to go to Genesis 41 says now
[55:31] Israel loved Joseph more than all his
[55:34] children because he was the son of his
[55:37] old age and he made him a coat of many
[55:39] colors and when his brethren saw that
[55:41] their father loved him more than all his
[55:44] breather and they hated him and they
[55:46] could not speak peaceably unto him and
[55:48] Joseph dreamed a dream and told it his
[55:52] brethren and they hated him yet more

[58:09] I mean god bless you friends you may
[58:11] have your seats this morning so I want
[58:13] to so we're going through the later see
[58:16] in church agent and last Sunday we were
[58:20] talking about how society is changing
[58:24] and it's
[58:25] so much compared to what it once was and
[58:28] and you know a families are broken up
[58:31] the nation's broken up you know there's
[58:33] you know those world is falling apart
[58:35] but we know God is in control of
[58:37] everything and and he has restored us
[58:39] back to an original faith or the
[58:41] original faith and but I want to just
[58:45] kind of change I'm going to continue
[58:48] into what I was talking about last
[58:50] Sunday but I'm gonna talk about Joseph a
[58:53] little bit today the Sunday maybe go
[58:54] back to it Nick Sunday all right so
[58:57] Joseph we see as a Joseph as a perfect
[59:01] type of Christ as we read therein in
[59:04] Genesis 37 he was loved of his father he
[59:08] was head of his brethren he was
[59:10] spiritual you know he had dreams they
[59:13] and they came to pass his his brethren
[59:15] hated him
[59:17] you know without a cause it seems you
[59:19] know he's given a coat of many colors
[59:21] which is a covenant coat he had the
[59:23] Covenant just like Jesus is the catio he
[59:26] is you know here's the covenant you know
[59:28] between God and man he was hated by his
[59:31] brethren without a cause all he did was
[59:33] heal the sick raise the dead cast out
[59:35] devils do good you know open the
[59:38] people's eyes to you know what you know
[59:40] more than just religion but a true and
[59:42] living God because he was God made flesh
[59:44] and but they hated him they wanted
[59:46] nothing to do with them because they
[59:47] wanted to keep the just Indian religion
[59:49] and so he was hated without a cause then
[59:53] he was sold like a Judas sold Jesus for
[59:56] thirty pieces of silver Joseph was sold
[59:57] for about twenty pieces of silver it was
[59:59] a price of a slave in those days and so
[1:00:02] did he wait down into Egypt and God
[1:00:04] caused him to to go down there because
[1:00:07] in your famine would come and life had
[1:00:09] to be preserved and so while he was down
[1:00:12] in Egypt he was he was eventually cast
[1:00:14] into prison just like Jesus was on the
[1:00:16] cross you could say his prison one thief
[1:00:19] was saved the other one was lost it was
[1:00:21] there was the butler and the Baker one
[1:00:22] was your the Baker died and the butler
[1:00:25] was restored he was saved and then after
[1:00:28] that Joseph was you know after that
[1:00:31] Joseph now Pharaoh had a dream any any
[1:00:34] and none of his wise men could could
[1:00:36] answer that dream
[1:00:38] so then the butler remembered oh there's
[1:00:41] a Hebrew in prison and he told me what
[1:00:44] my dream would be and what the Baker's
[1:00:46] dream would be and it came to pass
[1:00:47] exactly the interpretation of it and so
[1:00:49] he remembered it and he says to Pharaoh
[1:00:51] Pharaoh there was a man in prison he
[1:00:53] told me my dream I'm sure he could tell
[1:00:55] you yours
[1:00:56] and so joseph has now taken from prison
[1:00:58] and he's come up before Pharaoh Pharaoh
[1:01:00] explains his dream of the you know
[1:01:03] seeing seeing the seven fat cows and a
[1:01:06] meadow then seven think cows come and
[1:01:08] they eat up the fat cows but they stay
[1:01:09] thin and in this seven big fat sheaves
[1:01:12] of corn in seven withered ones I've come
[1:01:16] up and devoured the fat ones but they
[1:01:18] say wizard and he says the
[1:01:19] interpretation is you have seven years
[1:01:21] of plenty than seven years of famine and
[1:01:23] so and then and then because Pharaoh can
[1:01:28] see that that bet the Spirit of God has
[1:01:30] and Joseph he he gets him to be in
[1:01:32] charge of of storing up all the food for
[1:01:35] the time of famine and so he has exalted
[1:01:37] now from being in present to the right
[1:01:40] hand of our Pharaoh no one was above
[1:01:42] Pharaoh I mean you know Joseph was
[1:01:45] second-in-command in all of Egypt and
[1:01:48] when and when Joseph went somewhere the
[1:01:50] Trumbull will blow every knee had to bow
[1:01:52] because Joseph was coming same thing
[1:01:54] with our Lord now he said their right
[1:01:55] hand the Majesty on high or power and
[1:01:57] heaven earth was given to him and then
[1:02:00] now here he is but now during this time
[1:02:01] when he's in this Gentile and he takes a
[1:02:04] Gentile bride and all Christ types in
[1:02:07] the Bible take a Gentile bride Moses
[1:02:10] took a Gentile bride
[1:02:12] Boaz took a Gentile bride Salman took a
[1:02:15] Gentile bride right and so these ones
[1:02:18] all took Gentile prize because God was
[1:02:20] showing in these stories as a pattern as
[1:02:22] after the Jews reject him then he takes
[1:02:25] a Gentile bride that's what's been going
[1:02:27] on for seven church ages was there as a
[1:02:29] rejection off of their Messiah and it
[1:02:31] had to be done that way because even
[1:02:32] when Jacob came to bless
[1:02:35] Josef's two sons Joseph places all the
[1:02:39] senators right at Jacob's right hand to
[1:02:41] receive the main blessing but the in
[1:02:43] answer is going to bless them God cross
[1:02:44] his hands and Joseph was angry at him
[1:02:47] saying what are you doing you're putting
[1:02:48] the main bliss
[1:02:49] the younger son but then Jacob says I
[1:02:52] know but God crossed my hands and God
[1:02:54] has shown through the cross that the
[1:02:56] blessing would come to the Gentile to
[1:02:58] the younger who shouldn't have received
[1:03:00] it instead of going to the Jew
[1:03:02] hallelujah so all the life all the lives
[1:03:05] of the believers you read through the
[1:03:07] Bible God is manifesting himself God is
[1:03:10] manifesting his life he's showing this
[1:03:11] character is showing us nature amen he's
[1:03:14] showing himself all through these Bible
[1:03:16] stories and so now there is a so he
[1:03:20] takes as we read there he takes a
[1:03:22] Gentile bride while he's in Egypt and
[1:03:25] then now when the famine strikes when
[1:03:30] the famine strikes then of course his
[1:03:34] brothers have to go get grain everybody
[1:03:36] knows the story I trust you do and there
[1:03:39] comes a point where God as Joseph test
[1:03:43] as brothers to see if they've changed
[1:03:44] and they had changed and so now becomes
[1:03:47] a point where he where where he sends
[1:03:49] all men from him and then he reveals
[1:03:52] himself to his brethren so instead of
[1:03:54] speaking through an interpreter to speak
[1:03:56] to them he begins to speak their mother
[1:03:58] tongue and they're astonished told us
[1:04:00] this one who's dressed up like a Gentile
[1:04:01] who looks like a Gentile but he's
[1:04:04] speaking our language and he and he
[1:04:06] begins to say I'm your I'm your brother
[1:04:08] Joseph that you sold into slavery but
[1:04:11] now when he reveals himself to his
[1:04:13] brethren everyone's from him his bride
[1:04:16] is in the palace his bride is not there
[1:04:19] because she isn't his Gentile wife is in
[1:04:22] the palace when he reveals himself to
[1:04:25] his brethren and that is showing to us
[1:04:27] that when we're in glory
[1:04:28] we're in glory first then he reveals
[1:04:31] himself to the 144,000 Alleluia so now
[1:04:35] we're in the space of time now because
[1:04:38] because the life of Joseph encompasses
[1:04:40] the first and second coming of Christ
[1:04:42] it's all in that story so we're living
[1:04:47] in the in the between time you say well
[1:04:54] that's where we are now Romans 11:25 for
[1:04:59] I would not brethren that you be
[1:05:00] ignorant of this mystery that you should
[1:05:03] be wise in your own conceits that the
[1:05:05] blindness and the part has happened to
[1:05:07] Israel until the fullness of the
[1:05:09] Gentiles be come in so so they'll come a
[1:05:13] time when the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:05:14] God knows how many of you'll be there
[1:05:16] God knows the number when that fullness
[1:05:18] comes in when they really come into
[1:05:20] Christ not just come to the message but
[1:05:23] come to the God that set the message
[1:05:25] right there's more than learning of
[1:05:26] doctrine and conformity do some man's
[1:05:29] idea but God comes and lives in them
[1:05:31] just like brother ND was saying 20 there
[1:05:33] you're their brother was twenty years
[1:05:34] twenty years trying to say the right
[1:05:36] thing and conform and try and please
[1:05:38] these people from overseas doesn't do
[1:05:40] them any good just a dead we're religion
[1:05:42] I mean but their God got us too quick in
[1:05:45] the word to you right it has to be alive
[1:05:47] this message is living I mean it's a it
[1:05:51] has its own life we don't need to worry
[1:05:53] about how it's all going to work out God
[1:05:55] puts it in the predestinated hand and
[1:05:57] got quickens that word to that person
[1:05:59] God does the work I've seen it in
[1:06:02] Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea you know
[1:06:05] I've seen it I've seen it in this
[1:06:07] country your God knows how to get his
[1:06:09] word to his children right it has a life
[1:06:12] but you've got to let it live if you
[1:06:15] don't let it live you just getting in
[1:06:17] the way
[1:06:18] right so until the fullest it Gentiles
[1:06:20] comes in now this is um we're part of
[1:06:24] that hallelujah
[1:06:26] see if on all right this morning amen
[1:06:30] let's just blow the devil away right
[1:06:32] what why should we put up why she had to
[1:06:35] put up with you know the devil doesn't
[1:06:37] want you to fulfill the word he doesn't
[1:06:39] want you to fulfill the word he'll he'll
[1:06:41] allow you to be religious he'll that you
[1:06:44] even say you have a testimony you say
[1:06:46] you know to to say yes I remember
[1:06:48] scripture and whatever more but he but
[1:06:51] he doesn't want you to live it and the
[1:06:53] world is full of people arguing about
[1:06:55] scripture but what about the life what
[1:06:57] about it manifesting and a people that's
[1:06:59] why the devil always just like baptism
[1:07:02] brother Alba your Christine's then knew
[1:07:04] that the his first baptism and the
[1:07:06] titles of God was wrong then he was
[1:07:07] going
[1:07:08] this battle because he knew the baptism
[1:07:10] name of Jesus Christ is right then he
[1:07:11] realized what's stopping me from
[1:07:13] fulfilling the word there was the devil
[1:07:16] stopping him so he kicked it to one side
[1:07:18] he got baptized it's really that simple
[1:07:21] I mean so we shouldn't just you know we
[1:07:26] God wants to see his word lifts the
[1:07:28] devil doesn't want God to live in people
[1:07:30] I mean that is yeah you know I'm sure
[1:07:33] you should say well that's pretty
[1:07:34] obvious but sometimes we're gonna think
[1:07:35] about it the devil doesn't want God to
[1:07:38] live in me he doesn't want God to
[1:07:41] manifest through me I mean and when
[1:07:43] someone when a the difference between
[1:07:46] you know and you know the reason I'm
[1:07:48] bringing out about Joseph's wife is
[1:07:49] because the wife is very different to a
[1:07:52] girlfriend or a fiance I mean because a
[1:07:54] wife now can legally be a child can
[1:07:58] actually produce a life in the image of
[1:08:00] the husband right and it's very
[1:08:02] different out here she is being married
[1:08:04] to Joseph and she has his she has a sons
[1:08:07] and those sons are made in His image
[1:08:09] hallelujah and it's going to be the same
[1:08:12] thing with us when we're really united
[1:08:14] with him we don't just talk about it it
[1:08:16] lives right there produces the image of
[1:08:19] the son hallelujah
[1:08:22] are you following me Christianity is a
[1:08:24] living thing
[1:08:25] this message is living is not a dead
[1:08:28] religion it's not a bunch of reasoning
[1:08:30] right hallelujah
[1:08:32] this word lives in every generation
[1:08:35] there's been a people that the word is
[1:08:37] manifested through right and you're
[1:08:40] going to say Lord make me one of them
[1:08:42] doesn't matter what people say about me
[1:08:45] or whatever God manifests through me
[1:08:47] right and if there's something that
[1:08:50] takes that sweetness out of your life
[1:08:51] you got to say God restore the joy we're
[1:08:55] still that sweetness we shouldn't have
[1:08:56] walls up and shields against each other
[1:08:58] in the word and who are we fighting
[1:09:00] we're fighting the devil not one another
[1:09:03] without fighting our Lord hallelujah
[1:09:07] Amen so we don't just want to sit back
[1:09:09] you know I want God to live not for my
[1:09:14] glory someone wants to taste the money
[1:09:16] for their own glory is too puffed up
[1:09:18] shed and God will put them to one side
[1:09:19] right we want to see God manifests in
[1:09:22] everyday life not just here in these
[1:09:25] four walls oh we go to church and God
[1:09:27] lives what about in your house God come
[1:09:30] down in your house
[1:09:31] I pray does he should do a lujah so now
[1:09:36] she she had his children they were made
[1:09:39] in His image she didn't just have gifts
[1:09:43] she had the life amen
[1:09:47] gifts are good God is a God of addition
[1:09:50] he doesn't subtract I will restore say
[1:09:54] at the Lord all the years the palm woman
[1:09:56] that came to him the locust the
[1:09:57] caterpillar has eaten I will restore so
[1:10:00] I will restore those things I won't add
[1:10:02] one then take away one that have the
[1:10:04] next one take away the previous one I'm
[1:10:06] going to add the whole thing right so
[1:10:08] now we have the gifts and we have the
[1:10:11] giver right so we have the gifts just
[1:10:14] like a fiance gets gifts a girlfriend
[1:10:16] gets gifts but the wife gets married and
[1:10:19] she has the husband and the gifts amen
[1:10:23] exactly now we're in this time God is in
[1:10:29] control he knew where you were
[1:10:31] that's why I said there's a supernatural
[1:10:32] gospel right we're supernatural people
[1:10:36] there's a supernatural walk of faith
[1:10:38] it's not a natural look we walk by faith
[1:10:41] and not by sight I mean we walk by faith
[1:10:44] and not by sight right and when someone
[1:10:48] brings in a yea hath God really said
[1:10:50] you've got to look now where will that
[1:10:52] question take me where will it take me
[1:10:55] Eve didn't stop to think when the
[1:10:57] Serpent's ETA has God said she didn't
[1:10:59] think do you think this will take me out
[1:11:01] of Eden this will take me out of union
[1:11:03] with God this will take me into sin she
[1:11:06] didn't stop to think about that and you
[1:11:07] got to think about that when people say
[1:11:09] does it really mean this where will that
[1:11:12] take you right you always got to think
[1:11:15] about that where will it take you we
[1:11:20] want life right not just a nice religion
[1:11:25] not just nice families you know the
[1:11:28] promised land was more than milk and
[1:11:30] honey it was more than milk and honey
[1:11:32] the real
[1:11:33] spiritual believer you was more than a
[1:11:35] nice a nice place of milk and honey I
[1:11:37] mean it was a place of Resurrection
[1:11:40] that's why Joseph said when you leave
[1:11:42] take my bones bury me there Jacob told
[1:11:46] told his son son swear swear by him will
[1:11:49] you just promise to me you will not bury
[1:11:51] me here but you'll bury me right in the
[1:11:53] in the Promised Land because there's a
[1:11:56] resurrection in that place that's why
[1:11:58] the spiritual ones knew they had to be
[1:12:00] in that place right and it's the same
[1:12:02] thing this message will give us good
[1:12:04] families it will give us good children
[1:12:07] it will give us good Church right it
[1:12:10] will give us good people but it's more
[1:12:13] than that it's a place of resurrection
[1:12:15] there's a resurrection power just like
[1:12:18] this is why you know a psychologist
[1:12:20] worth half of this you know anything
[1:12:23] decent he can see that the principles
[1:12:25] laid out in the scripture makes a good
[1:12:26] sound person but it's more than just
[1:12:29] being good sound person right hallelujah
[1:12:33] I want a place don't bury me in some
[1:12:38] religion bury me in Christ hallelujah
[1:12:42] because if I'm in him I'll come forth
[1:12:44] but if I'm in some religion old I'll say
[1:12:46] did Amen that's why we're going to be
[1:12:50] more than quotas right because remember
[1:12:53] on the day you know I just been
[1:12:55] listening to brother BAM up in heaven a
[1:12:56] Jubilee preach y'all the restoration of
[1:12:58] the Brad tree and he says when the day
[1:13:00] of Pentecost was fully come it wasn't a
[1:13:03] priest coming into the Upper Room you
[1:13:06] know it wasn't coming off some local
[1:13:08] church it came from heaven there's a
[1:13:10] sound came from heaven I wasn't a priest
[1:13:12] coming into the room saying you know
[1:13:14] have the wafer and do this and whatever
[1:13:16] more put your name on the book shake the
[1:13:18] pastor's hand it wasn't that it was God
[1:13:20] coming down hallelujah was the presence
[1:13:22] of God coming and dwelling and his
[1:13:24] people and it has to be the same if he
[1:13:26] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:28] that same thing should happen to you
[1:13:30] right and brother Graham says I think
[1:13:33] it's a visible union he says that you
[1:13:35] know the modern church does not want
[1:13:37] screaming shouting boohoo crying at a
[1:13:41] time speaking acts 2:38 young uns
[1:13:43] miserable creatures she thinks they are
[1:13:47] but they glorious so does that mean well
[1:13:49] that means the church doesn't want
[1:13:51] people to get next to themselves maybe
[1:13:53] actually breakthrough once in a while
[1:13:56] and have a rejoicing time amen
[1:14:00] we have something very precious that
[1:14:04] which was from the beginning which we
[1:14:06] have heard which we have seen with our
[1:14:09] eyes which we have looked upon and our
[1:14:12] hands have handled of the word of life
[1:14:14] for the life was manifested and we have
[1:14:17] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[1:14:20] you that eternal life which was with the
[1:14:23] father and was manifested unto us that
[1:14:28] that which we have seen and heard
[1:14:30] declare we unto you that ye also may
[1:14:33] have fellowship with us and truly our
[1:14:36] Fellowship is with the father and with
[1:14:38] the son Jesus Christ and these things
[1:14:42] right we unto you that your joy may be
[1:14:45] full so he's saying here that life he's
[1:14:51] not talking about just a religion the
[1:14:54] life that was that life they said
[1:14:58] they've handled the word of life that's
[1:15:00] a person right it's not just a bunch of
[1:15:03] leaders on a you know an argument on a
[1:15:05] bit of paper it's a person for that life
[1:15:08] was manifest that we have seen it and be
[1:15:10] a witness and show unto you that eternal
[1:15:12] life which was with the father and was
[1:15:14] manifested unto us now how do you be a
[1:15:16] witness of something really you have to
[1:15:19] experience it you have to be there right
[1:15:22] you have to personally be part of the
[1:15:24] part of the scene not just a bystander a
[1:15:28] bystander can get all confused but
[1:15:30] someone who was there and it happened to
[1:15:32] them right John was not saying well this
[1:15:35] is just something that happened this
[1:15:36] happened to me and that's how you can be
[1:15:39] a witnesses of that life when his life
[1:15:41] comes into your manifest then you are a
[1:15:43] real witness that's the only way you can
[1:15:46] be a true witness that Jesus lives
[1:15:48] because it happened to you you're
[1:15:50] resurrected from the dead you was dead
[1:15:53] in trespasses and sins now he's quick
[1:15:55] and you made you alive hallelujah
[1:15:58] just like the
[1:15:58] of Joseph well how do I know you're
[1:16:00] married to him look at one's the ring
[1:16:02] and one's the life once the child looks
[1:16:05] just like him I meant that's why I want
[1:16:10] to emphasize it's very important he
[1:16:12] married a Gentile that Gentile produced
[1:16:14] his life upon the earth now we have to
[1:16:22] understand this is where we are I trust
[1:16:25] we know him say you know we will read
[1:16:27] that script you gotta say he's talking
[1:16:29] about me I'm amazed that I'm in the
[1:16:32] Bible even back in Genesis there I am
[1:16:35] hallelujah amen
[1:16:38] no first Peter why donate he says having
[1:16:44] not seen ye love and whom though now you
[1:16:48] see him not yet believing you rejoice
[1:16:52] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:16:55] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:16:57] salvation of your souls of which
[1:17:00] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[1:17:02] searched diligently who prophesied of
[1:17:05] the grace that should come unto you so
[1:17:08] he says even though you don't see him
[1:17:11] you believe and what does it produce joy
[1:17:15] unspeakable and full of glory I mean
[1:17:19] that there's an actual it's it's not
[1:17:22] just saying we have joy and we don't
[1:17:24] have joy right that's like saying I've
[1:17:27] got a million dollars butter and have I
[1:17:29] actually don't have it but if I had it I
[1:17:31] would have it right and if you really
[1:17:34] got joy in the Holy Ghost you really
[1:17:35] have joy and you're really feeling it
[1:17:38] now we don't go by feelings you
[1:17:40] understand that it will whip us around
[1:17:41] but it should be a manifestation just
[1:17:43] like love if you really love someone but
[1:17:45] you don't feel it you don't really love
[1:17:47] them it's just lip service right but if
[1:17:50] you really say you love them you feel it
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:54] and that's just natural love how much
[1:17:55] more just you know divine love but you
[1:17:58] see now we better see this is what the
[1:18:03] devil fights the devil fights against
[1:18:05] our joy he tries to take away our
[1:18:08] fellowship the first thing he does is he
[1:18:12] away the leaves of fellowship right so
[1:18:16] because you know how man is like a tree
[1:18:18] planted by the one river of I mean
[1:18:21] multiple rivers of one water
[1:18:23] samms one right he sees that bug you're
[1:18:27] the locust problem caterpillar whichever
[1:18:30] one I must go Rijal it's the four stages
[1:18:33] of the same bug chewing on the tree as
[1:18:36] the devil comes along but I'm saying
[1:18:38] it's like you're the you know you're the
[1:18:40] early book of X Church they're all
[1:18:42] rejoicing one mind one accord you know
[1:18:44] he says then this little bug just creeps
[1:18:46] along this little devil
[1:18:47] he starts chewing at the tree amen and
[1:18:51] what did you start to do first takes the
[1:18:53] joy away takes the fellowship away
[1:18:56] people don't fellowship anymore people
[1:18:58] run away and hide what's happening the
[1:19:00] Devils chewing the Devils chewing you
[1:19:03] know people can tell fellowship anymore
[1:19:05] caudillo
[1:19:06] and you have to get the really look at
[1:19:08] yourself and say no because the devil
[1:19:11] doesn't want you to be growing he
[1:19:13] doesn't want you to be a big strong tree
[1:19:15] planted by the rivers growing he doesn't
[1:19:19] want he wants you to be a little stump
[1:19:20] an effective little stump I mean so you
[1:19:24] gotta really identify now if something's
[1:19:26] actually in you saying I I just I can't
[1:19:28] handle the people I just got to stay
[1:19:30] away
[1:19:31] well what's happening we're really on
[1:19:35] home aren't we but we you know the devil
[1:19:39] tries to end it and in this what happens
[1:19:41] he comes in he causes clicks in the
[1:19:43] church over things that don't matter
[1:19:45] really and there's a separation what's
[1:19:48] happening the the bugs in he's chewing
[1:19:51] right but we've got a Holy Ghost
[1:19:54] repellent I mean we'll get a real bug
[1:19:56] spray and and and it should be in the
[1:19:59] plant right more than just a sprite it
[1:20:02] should be a life in the plot where the
[1:20:04] back tries that the devil tries to chew
[1:20:06] he just dies whatever crawls up and dies
[1:20:08] I mean because it's the piss poison I
[1:20:11] mean that that he can't take a loo here
[1:20:16] we don't don't need the devil steal your
[1:20:18] joy
[1:20:19] and the world can be upside down you can
[1:20:21] still be rejoicing Paul and Silas had
[1:20:23] had a wonderful time in a prison that
[1:20:26] just been beaten and they were put there
[1:20:27] in the inner prison hey man I don't know
[1:20:31] what that was singing but it was
[1:20:33] wonderful to god he was having a
[1:20:35] glorious time only very few of us have
[1:20:38] been in prison and I think any of us
[1:20:40] have been in prison for the word of
[1:20:41] God's sake he there in the firing line
[1:20:44] you know they're going forth they find
[1:20:46] themselves in that place they begin to
[1:20:48] pray and sing and rejoice oh yeah I mean
[1:20:54] don't let the devil get you down now
[1:20:59] searching what or what manner of time
[1:21:02] the Spirit of Christ which was in them
[1:21:04] did signify when it testified I didn't
[1:21:07] read the end of that receiving even the
[1:21:10] salvation of your souls verse 10 of
[1:21:12] which salvation the prophets have
[1:21:14] inquired and searched diligently who
[1:21:16] prophesied of the grace that should come
[1:21:18] unto you these people you know believers
[1:21:23] in the Old Testament they were searching
[1:21:25] they were seeking when what we have
[1:21:27] received when would it come and they
[1:21:30] didn't live to see the day and here we
[1:21:32] are just enjoying the you know the
[1:21:34] wonderful season that we're in and they
[1:21:38] were Dylan they were diligent about it -
[1:21:40] I believe searching what or what manner
[1:21:43] of time the Spirit of Christ which is
[1:21:44] intended signify when it testified
[1:21:47] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[1:21:49] the glory that should follow and to whom
[1:21:51] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[1:21:53] but unto us they'd administer the things
[1:21:56] which are now reported unto you by them
[1:21:59] they have preached the gospel unto you
[1:22:01] with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:22:03] heaven which things the angels desire to
[1:22:05] look into haloo yeah the things that
[1:22:11] they were you know they're administering
[1:22:12] it to us and we just receive it we're
[1:22:15] living in the greatest time I mean we're
[1:22:18] not living just in a you know we're not
[1:22:20] living under the blood of bulls and
[1:22:21] goats or even Matt Martin Luther's day
[1:22:24] wears these day early Pentecostal day
[1:22:26] we're living it when all of Jesus's made
[1:22:29] on we're living with the full word
[1:22:31] restored
[1:22:32] I mean a full Union hallelujah you know
[1:22:37] this is the greatest time to be alive I
[1:22:40] mean this is the greatest time to be
[1:22:42] alive I mean as a believer this is
[1:22:44] wonderful I mean where I can have you
[1:22:47] know where there's nothing between my
[1:22:49] soul and my Savior everything that they
[1:22:51] had in the early book of Acts Church we
[1:22:53] have hallelujah I mean we shouldn't have
[1:22:56] to you know you know you know we
[1:22:59] shouldn't have to read that and say well
[1:23:01] wonder what that's like we should say we
[1:23:03] know what that's like we can in
[1:23:04] fellowship together I mean because we
[1:23:07] know what it's like when he comes down
[1:23:08] like that when he changes us like that
[1:23:12] amen now I'm gonna jump ahead a bit
[1:23:18] because there's a restoration of the
[1:23:21] bride tree brother he speaks about a law
[1:23:22] a law that's in people now now we have a
[1:23:31] right to enforce that law and the
[1:23:34] lawgiver the Holy Spirit himself is here
[1:23:36] the agent of God to see that it's done
[1:23:38] that way I mean now the only way he
[1:23:41] could work is when you let him work see
[1:23:43] you've got to believe it there's a law
[1:23:46] oh if I ever get to my text now here's a
[1:23:49] law there's a law given amongst
[1:23:52] everything you know a fish has a law and
[1:23:55] that law and that fish can jump up here
[1:23:57] in water and here's a law within him if
[1:24:00] he will just let go of let go of that
[1:24:04] law that's in him he can sink plumb to
[1:24:06] the bottom of the sea
[1:24:07] won't bother him a bit won't break one
[1:24:10] cell you try to do it that law is not in
[1:24:13] you you can't do it but the fish can he
[1:24:16] defeats himself of it in such a way that
[1:24:18] he can there's nothing in him to burst
[1:24:20] open and he's made that way he knows it
[1:24:23] and he can enforce that law to make to
[1:24:26] take him plumb to the bottom of the sea
[1:24:28] then race him back up again oh there's a
[1:24:32] law in Christ that laws and man you can
[1:24:37] bury him to the deepest grave or or the
[1:24:39] deepest sea or the lowest hell there's a
[1:24:41] law of the spirit of god that'll raise
[1:24:43] him up again see
[1:24:45] a bird has a law now its body's material
[1:24:49] it's earthbound set on the earth here
[1:24:51] but it has a law within it that the way
[1:24:54] it spreads its wings it can fly plumb
[1:24:56] out of sight it's against science they
[1:24:59] claim its earthbound gravitation has to
[1:25:01] hold it there but it can defy
[1:25:03] gravitation lift itself right off of it
[1:25:06] and go right on out because it has to
[1:25:09] put that law that's in it to work and
[1:25:13] it's built to possess that law now I
[1:25:16] begin to feel religious now we have a
[1:25:19] law the law of life in us only no we
[1:25:24] don't only one thing you have to do
[1:25:27] you're made and born and placed in the
[1:25:30] body of Christ as sons and daughters of
[1:25:31] God you don't have to knock down to the
[1:25:34] devil you've got a law that's the law of
[1:25:37] the Holy Spirit the only thing you have
[1:25:39] to do is know how to let go and let God
[1:25:43] you keep fighting at it see and it won't
[1:25:46] never work when you let go and let God
[1:25:49] that's all see if the fish shed weight
[1:25:51] I'll catch my breath real good I'll
[1:25:53] breathe up a little oxygen on me and
[1:25:55] I'll see if I can go down no he does
[1:25:58] that he'll burst open sea and the bird
[1:26:00] says I'll see how fast I can run down
[1:26:02] here and maybe I'll take off no he won't
[1:26:04] do it he'll fall down see he's got to
[1:26:07] know how to control know that law can't
[1:26:10] control him and the same way it is with
[1:26:12] us it isn't what we fight and pull and
[1:26:15] hurry and off I don't get this of it I
[1:26:17] don't get that it's not a it's the know
[1:26:19] that the law of life is in you and you
[1:26:22] just let go and make God then he takes
[1:26:24] you to your healing takes you to the
[1:26:26] baptism of the Holy Spirit well anything
[1:26:29] he's promised any claim that he's given
[1:26:31] us yours and by letting go and letting
[1:26:33] God now if the officer was going to take
[1:26:38] the fellow that stole your property was
[1:26:40] going to take him to court and you keep
[1:26:43] pulling him back saying well I don't
[1:26:44] know just whether he should do this or
[1:26:46] not
[1:26:47] he will never get him there just let him
[1:26:49] go that's the way you do let Satan just
[1:26:52] let Satan just get away all the doubts
[1:26:55] and everything flee from your mind then
[1:26:57] God will raise you
[1:26:58] up amen it's like a bird saying I
[1:27:01] believe I can fly but they don't
[1:27:04] actually let go and just let it happen
[1:27:05] I mean and the proof they can do it as
[1:27:08] they fly right the proof of fish can
[1:27:11] swim down to the dips as they do it and
[1:27:13] they just do it naturally because it's
[1:27:15] part of the makeup that law is worth in
[1:27:17] their brother where I'm saying right but
[1:27:19] a same thing with a born-again believer
[1:27:21] now they have a law of life in them
[1:27:23] right they're happy the law of eternal
[1:27:25] life in them hallelujah that it doesn't
[1:27:29] matter you know what happens to this
[1:27:31] it'll be risen again but that life also
[1:27:34] has healing in it it has Redemption it
[1:27:37] has your restoration
[1:27:39] you know how it's like is us doing that
[1:27:40] last Sunday the head of the houses is
[1:27:42] the husband right and they man got sorry
[1:27:46] the devil has broken fatherhood has
[1:27:49] broken motherhood and now children don't
[1:27:52] know how do you know they don't know how
[1:27:56] to your children growing up these days
[1:27:58] cannot emotionally develop the right way
[1:28:01] because they have no relationship with
[1:28:03] parents right but now and the problem is
[1:28:08] as you know I was reading this thing on
[1:28:10] seeing in a few weeks ago this persons
[1:28:13] put out this you know child psychology
[1:28:15] thing they're saying now we have to
[1:28:17] change it used to be in the urine
[1:28:19] history yet he always knows beasts but
[1:28:22] now we've changed from that to daddy
[1:28:24] doesn't always know beasts now if you
[1:28:26] teach that to children then they will
[1:28:28] because what happens as a child how they
[1:28:31] relate to their father is how they'll
[1:28:33] relate to God
[1:28:34] subconsciously so if the father is
[1:28:37] distant and mean and never being policed
[1:28:39] by anything the child us then the child
[1:28:42] will begin to think God is distant and
[1:28:44] mean and I can never please them right
[1:28:46] so if you're teaching the children that
[1:28:48] daddy doesn't always know best then that
[1:28:50] we're going to think God doesn't always
[1:28:51] know best
[1:28:52] and I'll do my own thing yet being
[1:28:54] religious right we can't have that kind
[1:28:57] of mentality God is always right
[1:29:00] he is always always 100 percent of the
[1:29:04] time in every condition every
[1:29:06] circumstance no matter how you cut it
[1:29:09] slice
[1:29:10] whatever look at the argument God is
[1:29:12] always right daddy
[1:29:14] always knows best God is our daddy right
[1:29:18] I mean so now the we so the thing is now
[1:29:25] with a husband Jesus Christ as the
[1:29:29] husband of the church right so now he
[1:29:33] manifested Redemption to his family
[1:29:36] right he redeemed us just like Joseph
[1:29:40] and and redemption is through marriage
[1:29:42] right by our union with Christ we are
[1:29:44] redeemed he preaches our salvation and
[1:29:47] that redemption is manifested in a union
[1:29:50] right because he died to cleanse us of
[1:29:52] our sins wash your lessons away make us
[1:29:55] new creatures and we become one oh yeah
[1:29:59] right
[1:30:00] so now Joseph now by marrying you taking
[1:30:04] a Gentile bride now you'd say was
[1:30:06] redeeming her out of Egypt that she was
[1:30:09] no longer the daughter of a priest but
[1:30:11] she became the wife of Joseph hallelujah
[1:30:15] her identity changed by the Union okay
[1:30:19] so in a way Joseph was manifesting
[1:30:21] Redemption to his wife taking her from
[1:30:23] Egypt and now sheis she was him what
[1:30:28] because they became one now that is true
[1:30:31] is it not especially with Jesus
[1:30:32] redeeming us so redemption was
[1:30:34] manifested through the husband okay
[1:30:37] now that should be the same thing with
[1:30:40] us right that redemption should be
[1:30:44] manifested through us to our children
[1:30:49] okay are you following me so when
[1:30:52] they're all scattered and wherever and
[1:30:55] if we have been redeemed by him yeah the
[1:30:59] law of life comes in to us right so that
[1:31:02] same life that was in him as now on us
[1:31:04] so what he did we do not now I'm not
[1:31:08] talking about shedding our blood for
[1:31:09] salvation that's not talked about the
[1:31:11] attributes that were in him are in us
[1:31:14] right that's what the last thing that
[1:31:17] Adam did is his position as God in the
[1:31:19] earth was he tried to redeem his wife by
[1:31:22] falling with her
[1:31:23] that was his last act as God over this
[1:31:27] earth but then his first act as a fallen
[1:31:30] man as he passes the buck God the woman
[1:31:33] you gave me cause me to do this God it's
[1:31:35] actually your fault there's no one else
[1:31:36] around here right so that was his that
[1:31:39] was now fallen man manifesting passing
[1:31:42] the buck but God God takes
[1:31:45] responsibility of his children I mean
[1:31:49] that's why Jesus God became a man the
[1:31:51] son of God he became flesh you know I'm
[1:31:54] gonna take responsibility
[1:31:55] I'm gonna it's not just gonna be words
[1:31:58] of a prophecy that I'll come and redeem
[1:32:00] I'm gonna do it so he came he took
[1:32:02] responsibility over his household
[1:32:04] gathered them to himself hallelujah
[1:32:07] redeemed them amen gave them a new
[1:32:10] identity in him oh yeah right took
[1:32:13] responsibility and now that's that's
[1:32:15] been gunned down 37 church changes God
[1:32:17] takes responsibility of his children
[1:32:19] right and so now as men we must take
[1:32:23] responsibility of our own house and the
[1:32:26] life of God should manifest through us
[1:32:29] that redemption could happen for our
[1:32:31] children for our family right program
[1:32:35] says about applying the token you
[1:32:36] created that token creates an atmosphere
[1:32:38] around you it's the same thing with
[1:32:41] sisters as well but you see God has
[1:32:43] manifested through the man you know
[1:32:45] different to through the woman now you
[1:32:47] understand what I mean but this is this
[1:32:48] should be if there is redemption if we
[1:32:51] have been redeemed just like as
[1:32:52] ministers if we have been redeemed the
[1:32:54] in redemption should be manifested in
[1:32:56] the people we talk to right because it's
[1:32:58] in us if it's not in us then they cannot
[1:33:01] really become one with him they'll just
[1:33:03] become religious people right and so now
[1:33:08] if we've been redeemed then that will
[1:33:11] begin to affect their family I mean but
[1:33:17] you see you've got to let go let God he
[1:33:19] says yeah yes oh brother since that
[1:33:21] token the Holy Ghost the life of God in
[1:33:23] the person creates an atmosphere around
[1:33:25] them he says it you just that's just got
[1:33:28] a your family is just going to come
[1:33:29] under the influence of it that's why
[1:33:32] it's so important I'm so glad we can
[1:33:35] don't don't
[1:33:36] don't look at me like how's this going
[1:33:38] to happen let go and let God make God
[1:33:40] manifest let him have his way in your
[1:33:43] life that's what you got to do then try
[1:33:44] and work it out you say God take this
[1:33:46] thing get me out of the way come dwell
[1:33:48] live
[1:33:50] Alleluia you going to give yourself you
[1:33:52] have to feed on the right things right
[1:33:54] your to feed all the right things talk
[1:33:56] about the right things a mint doesn't
[1:34:00] mean you can yo you should talk about
[1:34:02] natural things but you know what's the
[1:34:05] what's the theme of your family what's
[1:34:09] the theme if there was the theme of your
[1:34:11] family what would it be
[1:34:13] is it is it my cultures that were on
[1:34:15] from is that my natural lineage or is it
[1:34:17] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:34:19] and forever
[1:34:20] we live for him because we love Him
[1:34:23] because he's wonderful
[1:34:24] I mean I believe we can have a meaning
[1:34:27] in our homes I believe we can have an
[1:34:29] atmosphere we walk through the door oh
[1:34:31] we're in paradise hallelujah I believe
[1:34:35] we can have it that way I mean hey if
[1:34:38] the devil could make his hell out here
[1:34:39] in different places we could have heaven
[1:34:42] so there's a law the law of eternal life
[1:34:46] has got to be in you right you can't
[1:34:48] just talk about it it's good in you I
[1:34:50] said about a bird they just fly you know
[1:34:53] I've never seen like a bird just kind of
[1:34:56] work it out first when they become fully
[1:34:58] grown they just flapping they're off
[1:35:00] right because they know it works
[1:35:03] hallelujah and we have to have the same
[1:35:06] I trust not in here but in here this
[1:35:09] thing works it produces what it says
[1:35:12] what Jesus said the word will produce it
[1:35:15] will produce it amen it says let every
[1:35:18] seed bring forth after its kind in
[1:35:20] Genesis 1 right and so now if that word
[1:35:23] is in the right ground it will produce
[1:35:25] what does in the in the seat now you
[1:35:30] mean I'm glad to stay away now I won't
[1:35:37] be too much longer but we can't we can't
[1:35:40] become cold this world is a cold world
[1:35:43] it's a it's a very dark it is a dark
[1:35:46] world whether we like it in this first
[1:35:49] world
[1:35:49] people are you know they doubt in their
[1:35:52] you know indifferent about many things
[1:35:55] we can't become like that it's not our
[1:35:58] portion it's not the apportion - you
[1:36:01] know that's living below privilege and
[1:36:03] we shouldn't just put up with well this
[1:36:06] is just how life is
[1:36:07] you know going to be we should you know
[1:36:10] we have to go back to our first love if
[1:36:13] we've lost it right
[1:36:17] okay just cool off and I'm glad that
[1:36:21] there's a power in this word that we do
[1:36:23] not call off I mean that he should mean
[1:36:25] more to you you know you have to really
[1:36:28] when when when your walk is becoming
[1:36:31] cold then you've got to look now well
[1:36:33] what has changed what has changed in me
[1:36:36] because the devil will batter in here
[1:36:38] any any any will try and knock us off
[1:36:41] the road right and then but then we have
[1:36:44] to because it's like Joshua was told
[1:36:47] meditate upon the whole word and you'll
[1:36:50] be successful so don't major on this and
[1:36:52] minor on this but take the whole Word of
[1:36:55] God right and you'll be successful and
[1:36:58] then Moses said you shall not diminish
[1:37:02] you you shall not take court of the word
[1:37:06] right let's just go to Deuteronomy
[1:37:13] judo chop before there's a reason I'm
[1:37:20] saying these things because we have to
[1:37:22] keep her we have to keep a balance and
[1:37:25] everything right so humanly well let's
[1:37:29] just read this you'd already for and one
[1:37:31] so I don't have this on the overhead he
[1:37:37] says now therefore hearken o Israel on
[1:37:40] to the statutes and unto the judgments
[1:37:42] which I teach you for to do them that
[1:37:45] you may live and go in and possess the
[1:37:47] land which the Lord God of your father's
[1:37:50] giveth you ye shall not add unto the
[1:37:52] word which I commanded you neither shall
[1:37:55] you diminish aught from it that you may
[1:37:58] keep the commandments of the Lord your
[1:38:00] God which I commanded you now
[1:38:03] would diminish the the definition it
[1:38:07] means to to scrape off by implication to
[1:38:11] shave remove listen withhold to take
[1:38:16] away keep back restrained make small
[1:38:19] withdraw so it's like just to scrape it
[1:38:21] off like you take a piece of toast and
[1:38:24] it's and it's been in the taste of too
[1:38:27] long you're scraping off so whoever you
[1:38:29] scrape off some of the cabin you have
[1:38:31] diminished that toast you have taken
[1:38:34] away from but just by a little bit you
[1:38:36] have diminished that toast we don't want
[1:38:39] to diminish the Word of God right we
[1:38:42] don't want to diminish the Word of God
[1:38:44] we're you know we're we listen some
[1:38:48] things and major on some things and vice
[1:38:51] versa
[1:38:51] and the reason I say that is because
[1:38:53] what happens is we're walking with the
[1:38:56] Lord
[1:38:56] then the enemy comes in and humanly
[1:39:00] humanly we will pull the other way if
[1:39:03] you were done that someone comes against
[1:39:05] you or something humanly you're on the
[1:39:06] other side and you take up your position
[1:39:09] and then now you'll find there on one
[1:39:11] side of the road and now you're on the
[1:39:13] other side of the road you're not in the
[1:39:15] middle anymore
[1:39:16] you've been pushed to one side right and
[1:39:18] then now if you go too far one way now
[1:39:21] you're in a ditch and they're on the
[1:39:22] other ditch and you say well they're
[1:39:24] wrong over there but what about what's
[1:39:26] affecting you now what's the feet thing
[1:39:29] you know because if you don't keep it
[1:39:31] under prayer and actually forgive and
[1:39:35] give it over to the Lord actually let go
[1:39:37] of it I mean real forgiveness is when
[1:39:41] you surrender the right to hold it
[1:39:43] against that person that's actually
[1:39:44] forgiving them right but if you don't
[1:39:47] actually figure in that way you're still
[1:39:48] holding on to it and they've given me
[1:39:50] this and now it's pulling me this way
[1:39:52] and then you end up in the ditch and
[1:39:54] then if you stay there now you dig then
[1:39:56] you have a trench and then you can build
[1:39:58] a bunker and then Here I am in my
[1:40:01] position but I'm not walking right and
[1:40:04] now what is the I need so so what
[1:40:07] happens to someone who lives in a bunker
[1:40:08] they don't see much sunlight they stay
[1:40:12] in their little bunkers aren't very big
[1:40:13] I went into the soso Papua New Guinea
[1:40:17] we are in rebels where the Japanese had
[1:40:20] their headquarters one of the main
[1:40:21] headquarters for the for the Pacific
[1:40:23] Theater for world war ii and i was an
[1:40:26] admiral yamamoto who's in charge of the
[1:40:28] invasion i was in his bunker and it was
[1:40:31] maybe not even the this big it was two
[1:40:37] rooms this is the Admirals bunker who's
[1:40:40] in charge of the invasion of the South
[1:40:41] Pacific it's a small place it's dingy
[1:40:44] wouldn't have been much nicer winner was
[1:40:46] actually operating and so people get
[1:40:49] used to their little four walls and this
[1:40:51] is you know because they're in there
[1:40:52] banker and you can see it in people but
[1:40:55] someone who's walking on the road you're
[1:40:58] enjoying the sunshine they're seeing new
[1:41:00] sights right the scenery changes when
[1:41:02] you walk right so then you see now
[1:41:05] there's a mountain here now there's a
[1:41:06] plane now there's this and this and you
[1:41:08] know and you can have fellowship as you
[1:41:09] walk look at this isn't this amazing
[1:41:11] isn't this wonderful and you walk
[1:41:13] through here and it's glorious and you
[1:41:15] walk through here and it's glorious and
[1:41:17] then you see how it ties back into here
[1:41:19] and it's glorious and you see him
[1:41:21] reflecting himself through the word all
[1:41:24] the Sun shines wonderful but someone's
[1:41:26] in a bunker they don't see sunshine if
[1:41:28] they pop out of their bunker they may
[1:41:30] get shot by who-knows-who
[1:41:32] but they there and it could happen and
[1:41:34] they become all cold hard and defensive
[1:41:40] because whatever affected them to build
[1:41:42] that bunker has caused them to build the
[1:41:44] bunker right we can't and that's why I
[1:41:48] say you got to look at yourself now we
[1:41:50] should still have joy we should still
[1:41:52] rich it like genuinely rejoice it's not
[1:41:55] a put-on but Oh Lord I'm so glad I'm so
[1:41:58] glad you died for me I'm so glad you
[1:42:00] paid my redemption in full I'm so glad
[1:42:03] that your spirit comes into me I mean
[1:42:05] I'm not under the law but I'm under you
[1:42:07] I'm in this rural Liberty and you I mean
[1:42:10] I don't have to conform to anything but
[1:42:13] it's you changing me hallelujah when you
[1:42:15] say Lord help me change me he says yes
[1:42:17] I'll do it for you amen hallelujah you
[1:42:20] don't have to push yourself through and
[1:42:21] truck
[1:42:22] he just doesn't you say I believe I'm
[1:42:24] free and you're free I believe that
[1:42:26] addictions God and it's gone hallelujah
[1:42:30] manifests a man and it gets sweeter and
[1:42:33] sweeter every day
[1:42:35] hallelujah gets more glorious all the
[1:42:38] time that's how it should be
[1:42:40] shouldn't it be that way and you're glad
[1:42:42] he means more for me I'm just gonna wrap
[1:42:43] up with this you know love should
[1:42:46] increase I mean we should love our
[1:42:49] spouses more now than when we first
[1:42:51] married them I mean we should love them
[1:42:55] so much more hallelujah sorry such a
[1:42:57] deeper richer more wonderful
[1:42:59] relationship how you been through some
[1:43:01] battles you been through some trials

[1:43:06] you're still there and you still love
[1:43:09] each other I mean I trust you do and if
[1:43:13] you don't you say well go back to when
[1:43:14] you first fell in love yeah amen you
[1:43:18] can't go back to that time if you let
[1:43:21] yourself if you actually surrender the
[1:43:23] right to hold it against them you can't
[1:43:25] go back amen and so it should be the
[1:43:29] same with the Lord all we've been
[1:43:30] through some wonderful things we're been
[1:43:32] through some trials holy you mean so
[1:43:35] much more to me now that you first time

[1:44:24] stuck in this is just a routine you know
[1:44:26] sometimes they start you you know

[1:44:33] know why do you do this you know why are
[1:44:38] you here I've been here for a long time
[1:44:39] I've been here 40 years
[1:44:42] praise the Lord my chest is not because
[1:44:46] the only reason you've been here 40
[1:44:47] years is because you're here 39 years
[1:44:49] beforehand what should be a bursting of
[1:44:52] a life hallelujah I know people in their
[1:44:56] eighties and they're rejoicing I mean
[1:44:58] they're so glad partly they praise them

[1:45:36] say Lord you're wonderful I remember
[1:45:40] that day you gotta let that look that's
[1:45:43] how you let them go that's how you let
[1:45:45] go and let God
[1:45:46] because if you if you lose your
[1:45:48] confidence in him then because you know
[1:45:53] if you lose your confidence at home

[1:47:37] whatever the devil fires against you

[1:47:41] the fire that's the enemy have in your
[1:47:44] faith will quench the doubts doesn't
[1:47:46] matter where they come from
[1:47:48] amen this word is true this whole word

[1:48:06] never let me down he knows what's best
[1:48:08] for me he's guided me through he stayed

[1:48:15] faithful he remains faithful as his word
[1:48:17] says he is always faithful and true
[1:48:20] you're the first thing I I know you're I
[1:48:22] remember reading in your was a
[1:48:24] revelations 19 he's called faithful and
[1:48:26] true said Lord you're faithful and true
[1:48:29] doesn't matter you know
[1:48:31] I'm me but you're faithful and true
[1:48:33] you've got to keep your eyes on him
[1:48:35] don't take your eyes on to other things
[1:48:38] what normally happens sometimes you get
[1:48:40] married and then your eyes are on each
[1:48:42] other and it's lovely
[1:48:44] it's the gloriously and then but then
[1:48:46] now life happens and then what happens
[1:48:49] when your eyes go on to life and then
[1:48:54] what happens those things can bog you
[1:48:55] down right but if you keep your eyes on
[1:48:58] each other then you remain strong
[1:49:01] and you go back in the X remember you
[1:49:04] know you know I'll probably say to every
[1:49:06] service the devil is a historian he's
[1:49:09] not a good one cuz he only lead he
[1:49:10] weighs leave the other part where you
[1:49:11] get set free and he and he got kicked
[1:49:14] out but gods are historian - not in all
[1:49:18] the bad things that you've done but he
[1:49:22] remembers the day hey when when he went
[1:49:25] up Calvary you were on his mind
[1:49:28] your honors mine he knew what he was
[1:49:31] going there the joy that was set before

[1:49:39] don't know who she is it's got to be
[1:49:41] wonderful that wasn't him he knew he saw

[1:50:06] specific ones hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:50:12] that wasn't a vague think that he knew
[1:50:14] you'd be there right and so now he takes
[1:50:19] us through me anything so he's a
[1:50:21] historian he remembers that day and he
[1:50:24] also knew when you would actually meet

[1:53:37] hide in a bunker of religion or pain
[1:53:40] they're full of spiders and they're cold

[1:53:45] there's no sunshine in a bunker bunker
[1:53:47] doesn't really have obvious expose
[1:53:49] points right because if there's an
[1:53:52] expose point someone can get a shot at
[1:53:54] or or fire a bomb on or missile whatever
[1:53:56] they are sealed as possible don't hide
[1:54:01] in what you're used to if you're in a
[1:54:03] bunker get out of the bunker get back on
[1:54:06] the road why am I in this place I should
[1:54:10] be you shouldn't be in that place Jesus
[1:54:12] didn't die for us to make religious
[1:54:14] bunkers he died that we would walk with
[1:54:17] him up into glory hallelujah
[1:54:20] so you gotta think now why am I in this
[1:54:22] way what happened will that happen all
[1:54:24] that happened no it should be yes but
[1:54:27] Lord you brought healing into my life
[1:54:29] and it's gone shouldn't it be that way
[1:54:32] Moses brings it up and I'll close with
[1:54:35] this Moses brings the children israel
[1:54:36] like they come through the Red Sea
[1:54:39] mighty victory then they're walking
[1:54:41] three days they have no water they come
[1:54:42] to a place where the waters bitter they
[1:54:44] come to a bitter experience in their
[1:54:46] walk we all have come to those waters of
[1:54:50] marrow of bitterness and thence they
[1:54:54] came to this place it would trees
[1:54:56] growing around the water I don't know
[1:54:57] how big the tree was that Moses cut down
[1:54:59] but God told them that tree cut it down
[1:55:01] there's specific tree cut it down put
[1:55:04] that tree in the water it became sweet
[1:55:07] now what does that represent
[1:55:09] take the cross take redemption take what
[1:55:13] he's done for you right
[1:55:15] take redemption it's been cut down mix
[1:55:17] it into the experience right
[1:55:20] amen and it will make it sweet it won't
[1:55:24] be a bitter memory anymore oh yeah you
[1:55:28] got to do it you say well there's been
[1:55:30] massive things happen to me there's
[1:55:32] nothing too big that cannot be made
[1:55:35] sweet
[1:55:36] well why did it happen to me I don't
[1:55:38] know the woman at the well had to be at
[1:55:41] the well she had to be in that condition
[1:55:43] to meet the Lord right the maniac in the
[1:55:47] tombs whatever caused him to open a door
[1:55:49] one spirit an expert an expert in up in
[1:55:51] the tombs I don't know but he had to be
[1:55:53] there he had to be there Mary Magdalene
[1:55:56] had had to have seven devil she had to
[1:55:58] be in that condition I don't know why it
[1:56:00] doesn't seem to make sense
[1:56:02] but God is showing it doesn't matter
[1:56:04] what condition you come to me in right
[1:56:07] it doesn't matter what condition you may
[1:56:09] be in I mean Paul was a Pharisee of the
[1:56:11] Pharisees and that's even a worse a
[1:56:14] condition because it's it's religious
[1:56:15] but yet God made him hallelujah and then
[1:56:20] now he could relate to the religious
[1:56:22] ones he knew how to speak to them the
[1:56:25] world well could speak to those who came
[1:56:27] from broken homes broken relationships
[1:56:30] she could relate right she could relate
[1:56:33] and so we have to God uses those things
[1:56:38] God uses those things brother Graham
[1:56:40] said you know Sharon Rose died her on
[1:56:42] her her eyes crossed and pain and then
[1:56:46] he said after that cross our children
[1:56:49] will come across the platform they would
[1:56:51] never leave with cross-ice because he
[1:56:54] could relate because he had been here
[1:56:56] and had her own child suffering so he
[1:56:58] could enter into that burden
[1:57:00] God wants to manifest himself through us
[1:57:03] if you haven't really caught up with the
[1:57:05] program that's what he wants to do but
[1:57:07] if we're cold and callous and
[1:57:08] indifferent if we can't relate to the
[1:57:11] person you can't enter into their burden
[1:57:13] we're not meant to just say a prayer
[1:57:15] we're mean to pray a prayer and when
[1:57:17] we're really prayer prayer it's not you
[1:57:19] praying it's him right that's how it
[1:57:22] should be and he said not one child left
[1:57:24] with cross eyes because of that
[1:57:26] experience Amen God could use it to help
[1:57:31] others right and it has to be the same
[1:57:34] thing with us you say well I've been
[1:57:36] through some terrible things God can use
[1:57:38] that amen
[1:57:41] and God wants to use it but get out of
[1:57:44] your bunker
[1:57:46] is the cross mix it with the bitter
[1:57:48] water mix it with that bitter memory do
[1:57:53] it what do you do do it don't you say
[1:57:55] that's a nice idea one day no take it
[1:57:58] makes it drink it and become sweet get
