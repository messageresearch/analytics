lord jesus thank you lord amen praise the lord god bless you all you can um you can have your seats now this evening praise the lord thank you brother martian i like brother martian [Applause] thank you musicians brother martian is a likable person i don't know if that's just me maybe i'm biased towards him but i just like the guy he is a yeah he's like likeable people can sort of do anything and get away with it you know isn't that the truth you know after a likeable guy i drove down the driveway the other day and i don't know if you know marion lives behind our place and he parks the van down the bottom and he's got some little scheme he has to do to swap vehicles each morning and i'm not sure what happened but in the middle of this paddock there's like it's like some young fellow's been out there doing burnouts all through this paddock it's just it's like a mud pit and he he said i apologize bro i may have dug in up the ground a bit down there i don't know how so i'm still here to determine how a vehicle got to that particular spot but he's such a likable guy i just had a laugh about it you know i saw all the skid marks and i just imagine marion in there trying to get his vehicle out of this all this mud praise the lord praise the lord that we can like people that we can have love in our hearts for people you know we would be if we couldn't express love to people how what an awful life that would be that we couldn't just love you know it's a lot nicer more enjoyable to love even though you might be going through a hard battle it's easier to love because the outcome is always better so it's easier just to love it's not what your flesh wants to do but when you just try it and do it the outcome is very good you know and and is that just the tone yen in the background in there it is hello sorry to interrupt my trade before but i didn't see you there praise the lord so tonight is um i've got just a small thought because tonight is actually a pre-meeting so this is like a 20 minute little sermon at 15 20 minutes so i'm it's um it's only a very very simple thought tonight so we're just going to speak about this and then we're going to go into prayer and i i there are scriptures coming up but they aren't right now so we just we can start already with this and i just had a funny word on my heart which was the table i had always got this little word coming back to me called the table and you know the table is quite a significant place when we think about it we all have some connection to i'm going to call it the table the table is generally a place in your home where you sit down and eat and generally speaking most people eat i've got a you know there's a simple motto in life eat or die that's pretty much one of there are very few things that if you don't do it you die anything is one of them so it's common to mankind we all eat you know and i'm so happy how the lord has made food isn't food a wonderful thing you know people that think that this is a mistake that we're all just here by chance and that we just evolved and it all just happened to happen is beyond me how you could think that when even you think about food and the flavors in food you can have different foods they have different flavors and you can mix different flavors together and you eat it and it just tastes so good but even that in itself the fact we can experience food and flavors it's such an enjoyable thing and and um there's a place called the table at home that that it's a significant place in the home it's probably the place where we probably spend as a as a group as a family as the people in the home you would gather around the table probably more so than any other place in the house like you wouldn't all gather in somebody's bedroom or you gather in the lounge now and then but you know you always kind of everyone at some point gets hungry and they need to eat so they they have to end up back at the table to to eat that so it's quite a significant place the table i just want to talk about food for a little bit because i was talking to brother andy when we were driving in the car the other day and i've had this thought lately about it's amazing how quickly how people will sell out for money for for not so much money but a little bit of gain when you think about it not everyone has a low selling point but but it's a flaw of mankind that we will sell out for gain we we will we will forget about our principles if there's money in it you think i know i won't all you people won't but i'll give you an example if i could use an extreme example then i'll use an extreme one just to really get a point across i'll talk about food shortly but i want to say this if i told you could you or the general public would just talk about the general public right if i said could you go and murder somebody for me most people would say no maybe one not one odd person psychopathic person may say yes i'll just go and do it because that's you know we have those people in society right but but most of us would think that's the wrong thing to do right now if i said to you okay i've got a hundred dollars here if you just go and deal to this guy still probably not a lot of people would do it but there may be one one extra person other than the person that would just go and do it for farmingdale for a hundred dollars this is reality right now if i still give you thousand dollars i might get another two takers if i got up to like 100 million and and look no one's going to know it's just going to keep it all under under wraps 100 million dollars here's the cashier if you just sort that out how many people you think that would put their hand up and how many people would entertain that thought for 100 million dollars oh let me think about that you know now see that i like brother ben because he's honest but hey many many people would entertain that thought oh it's 100 million dollars you know maybe the guy's a bad guy he has probably deserves it you know you know but that's and that's why the bible says the love of money is the root of all evil because it's it's that it's when we want to gain something everyone slowly has a sellout point that they will sell out a principal that i don't murder they will sell it out at some point for money except for the lord he was offered the whole world here take the whole world all you gotta do is bow down and worship me not interested that's the keeping power of a christian we we won't sell out but but back to a more wholesome subject of food it's unfortunate now that if you look at the way that mankind has become man has done evil to other men by producing a product that they know is bad for them and they're selling it to them to make a bit of money it's an evil thing it's evil it shouldn't actually someone's conscience should say i don't want to manufacture a product that i know is going to kill people and do them serious harm to their body right because you look at the health of mankind is deteriorated and it's solely based on what we eat solely based on what we eat what we put into our body because what you put in produces it makes it what it is and and food manufacturing companies are sitting around and they're devising plans to get their product into people and they will come up with any scheme and if they and if they prosper they think i'm wise i'm smart and yet they are they are operating something that's harming mankind someone in the room should stand up and say look guys we're all a bunch of crooks here you know these board meetings let's let's address the elephant in the room guys this product is killing people we're all a bunch of crooks we just should shut down this whole business and not sell it this stuff anymore that's what they should do if you're if you were god in head principles you'd say shut the business down but it's making so much money there's so many jobs i don't care shut it down we're destroying people you think they will no because there's money involved and and we'll we'll gloss over it and think we're okay and we'll all be involved in it too you know because there's money involved oh well it's the i just work for the company that's the reality of this guys that's how this whole that's what keeps this world going is the desire for more and it's an evil thing don't even let don't ever get like that you know be willing to follow the lord and just follow him no matter what don't don't sell out for nothing don't sell out brother brown many times was offered a lot of money here's a whole lot of money he didn't take it and we're the same we're the same back to food so we have now the table and it's there's a the natural types are spiritual because at our natural table now we've got not we've got there's a whole lot of junk ends up on our natural table these days when we go when we sit down to eat sometimes we're just forced to because there's actually not very much else on offer you know you try and eat good it's very very hard it takes a lot of effort to try and get something half decent you know that's that's where we're at it's it takes a lot of effort to get something decent and unfortunately it's like that in the spiritual too that there's a lot of there's the spiritual realm is now filled with junk just junk and it's very hard to not taken junk like i'll i'll give you some reality on it like like brother branham said oh if i ever had a tv in my home i'd blast it out with a shotgun who's who's heard that quote right so we walk around with tvs there's reality i don't hate to bring jesse up in the summer but jesse says to me dad i want to get a phone and so i've switched around lately because i'm like oh so okay i'll get your phone so you want the phone that can phone somebody and maybe send the text that's the phone there's probably phones that can just do that i'll get you one of those sorry buddy but it's not about you man i'm just saying this as an example oh no i want a real phone no oh you mean you want a tv so after a tv or a phone because the phone is what you ring people with this this is the tv you know you watch you watch tv on this you know but you see it's just it's hard to get and operate in life without getting junk in you everywhere you go you know there's that it's it's just very hard it's very hard to live live i'm not saying it as an excuse but it's very hard to live wholesomely just like it is to get wholesome food every day you have to make a very very big effort to get wholesome food every day you can't just go to the usual places it doesn't really work like that you go to the fruit and veggie department and pack and save it's all full of pesticides so if you really want to get healthy sometimes eating that stuff is as bad as eating like a processed food it's got so many pesticides in it that is slowly killing us you know it's but and the spiritual has become the same you know we what when we go to our table our spiritual table you know as humans it's it's slowly it's deteriorating what we have to our intake is that all right to say that i need a tissue bro i've got a runny nose sorry oh thank you just the next one up please so here we have a table and this is a natural table but you know we have a spiritual table as well we've got the the natural always types of spiritual this place where we meet and we we get sustenance for life you know this we go to the table in it and we get to we eat and we try and eat as well as we can and a lot of things happen around the table go to the next one i want to read this because i want to just segue this just a little bit and may as you give this is brother adam speaking as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food find healthy looking vegetables that i saw in the vision being stored here in this tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that granted lord or a tape load that it might reveal jesus christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength the spiritual strength for the task that laser head granted father so now we're now going to just talk about spiritual food i think the lord the lord foresaw the situation that we would be in we're all around us is just there's all these pesticides and everything is just infested with things that that the lord actually made an effort the lord made an effort well he still could to actually provide us with some nice wholesome organic pure food that we could actually live on and be sustained by and and that's what the lord has blessed us with to serve at our table as the wholesome word of god and the the revealed word of god for this age and in his brother brown saw the vision and it was store up all this food so that we now can actually go to the table of the lord and eat some wholesome food we don't have to you know we hopefully we get more of that than all this junk this junk everything that's all around us you know imagine if we didn't have this wholesome food to feed on where would our spiritual state be you know imagine if you couldn't find wholesome natural food if it was if you just had to buy all this processed stuff you would mankind is eventually going to just die die naturally that will actually kill them and it's spiritually it's the same we just the the the diet of the the spiritual diet of human beings is causing the minds to actually die like not work properly it's not designed the mind isn't designed to have their stuff the mind is designed to have the word of god the pure word of god fit into it and thrive on that that's that's what it needs so this is one thing that we get from the table of the lord is we've got his we've been there's been food stored up to serve at his at his table for us so there's a call it a banquet of all this he saw healthy looking vegetables who likes healthy vegetables you all have to put your hand up now yeah he didn't see like soda you didn't get a vision of fizzy drink or chips when you saw the vision you just saw these wholesome these healthy vegetables you know because it's because it's not tainted by man you know man can take all these different ingredients and mix everything together and and it might taste nice but it's not good for you but the way god designed a piece of food he's like his his fruit his vegetables his natural products he's specifically designed to that we can have it and it works well in our body and it just sustains us and this the pure word of god is exactly the same it's just it's not tampered with it's just fresh off the the tree of god and the tree of life and we just eat it from the tree of life just nice and fresh wholesome this is not a this is not a talk about food you eat it's just for the sermon can you go to the next one please now i want to bring another thought about a table because eating from a table is not just it's more than just eating a wee bit of food from a table there's actually a bigger concept in this idea of eating from a table and i'm just going to read you this one then zeba then said zebra unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy seven do as for me said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the king's sons now this was um so this is david speaking and mephibosheth was jonathan's son and david always loved jonathan and he i love loyalty david was he whenever he thought of jonathan he always thought in his heart i love jonathan and and they had a loyal bond with each other and that's a godly thing to be loyal to have a to have a loyal bond that never breaks you know even when jonathan was gone when he did go david was so upset he was so upset and he he even cried out to god and he said publish it not in death you know don't let anyone know unless the daughters of the philistines rejoice don't let anyone know that these mighty men have fallen like it really touched his heart and he he he began to speak about they were like hinds feet in high places they were just these amazing people sword and jonathan they were powerful warriors you know the sword of the sword of sword didn't return empty you know the bow of jonathan never turned back so he had this such a feeling of loyalty to jonathan maybe he got busy with things his life went on but then one day that that loyal feeling came up again and he thought what's what's happened to what of jonathan's family and then he found out that he had this um was it his son yeah mephibosheth his son but they had gotten to trouble when that when when the hen the his mother i think was running away and he had fallen they had fallen over and this refugee couldn't actually walk because he had this injury when he was a baby so he was a his whole life but then one day david thought about jonathan then he wanted to track down does he have any offspring and he tracked down mephibosheth and the loyalty in him said i want to do something good for jonathan so mephibosheth is is his son and so he and he said to him if she you can come and be with me and eat at my table come and sit around my tables and and be as one of the king's sons now i want to explain to you what this means this isn't just like oh um refurbished um we breakfast at um eight o'clock and then lunch is about 12 30 and then dinners at six o'clock so just wait out there and at eight o'clock the the guards will open the gate just so you can whiz in breakfast is serve for half an hour then you just go back out you know and then lunch time quick meal you know we generally don't stop for long dinner we'll stretch it out for an hour maybe but you know we'll invite you in and once it's done you gotta walk back out again and you know wait outside it was more than that it was like you come you come and eat at my table you come and you come and be with me and everything i have is yours you know this is my table this is there's a room there there's you there there's there's a servants there's there's everything you can come and come and dine at my table it meant more than just eat food i mean come and be as one of my sons my my wealth my belongings everything that i have my empire my my umbrella just come under my umbrella it's it meant more than just come sit at my table it's like come under come under my blessing come under everything that i am i wanna i wanna bless you with everything that i have it was almost just symbolic to say come at my table but that was just the that was more symbolic to say come and dine with me you know live with me enjoy everything that i have and that's really to the next one please that's really go back sorry that's really what it means when we dine at the lord's table it's actually his whole his his the lord's table for us is more than just it's it's like what i just described you know it's actually a bigger it's coming under his umbrella when we dine at the lord's table and the table in i'm just going to talk about this for a minute the table when you think about a table there's a sign that says bring it all to the table you ever heard that saying bring it all to the table that means when is the situation happening when something's got to be worked out or you're not happy with something or you need to work through something you say look look let's just meet up this time meet at a certain place over a meal just bring it all to the table you know whatever whatever concerns you've got anything that it is come let's meet together come let us reason together saith the lord the table is not just a place where you go and eat food it's actually where you can meet together come and meet together we'll bring it all to the table let's talk about this let's reason together let's tell me about what you're going through tell me tell me what's happening tell me how your day's been tell me the tell me your ups tell me you're down tell it all to me and that's actually what the table of the lord is it's not just coming for you actually bring it all to the table lord this is how my day's been this is what's happening to me at the moment it's the table of the lord it's more than just you get some food but you actually can express your life at the table you know lord this is this is how my day was this is what this is what i'm going through any any need you got you bring them all to the table don't forget that you bring it all to the table but there's also a another side to that as well which we have to keep in inside a relationship who's and i think i can say this who's heard the other saying don't bite the hand that feeds you you know this works both ways we don't just come and bring all our needs and bring it all to the table and eat food and walk away you you're actually there's somebody that's feeding you at the table like i think mufaba sheth would have had respect for david well david's a great guy this is the best thing's ever happened to me i love david you know he's tell you what i was living out there i had nothing now i'm here and i get to live live with david all the time i love david he's such a great guy you know he he wouldn't have cursed david i wouldn't well if he was not a good person he would have but if he had any outs of dignity and a more good character he would have actually really respected dave and thought i'm so happy for what david's done for me you need anything from me david i've only got i crawled along the ground but if you need anything i'm here you know i can use my hands i'm here to help you know you don't bite the hand that feeds you and that's the relationship with god sure we can we all talk about bringing all our needs to the lord but it also works both ways lord you you provide this great spread for us lord you provide all of this lord i really i really appreciate that i really appreciate the spirit you've provided i really appreciate the umbrella i can come under you know anything you want from me you just ask you know i really appreciate it i'm not going to bite the hand that feeds me go to the next one i just got this verse here because i like this verse and i like it more now that i've been through a few things better as a dinner of herbs where love is than stalled than a stalled ox and hatred there with and as you go on in life you realize it's better to have not much but have an environment of love and be amongst people that love you then have a lot and be in turmoil and strife and be in an atmosphere with this hate because our body is an easy thing to just you know if you can't get much food we can kind of go oh well i'm a bit hungry no it's okay it's not such a bad thing but when you're an environment where your mind is not happy that's a lot harder to take than to than your stomach to be a bit hungry at that that that destroys your whole life if your mind is if you're in a place of hate and strife then everywhere you go there's just hate and strife in your mind if you notice that when there's a bad atmosphere but when there's love when you've got when you can be an atmosphere of love things are so much easier you can be happy even if you're a little bit hungry you can be happy and that's what this verse is it's better to have not much food but be in a be involved with around a table with these loving people and you just there's love rather than have a whole lot of food and but your mind can't rest it's all turmoil and this hatred amongst the people that's you can't live like that and you know sometimes when we walk with the lord i don't want to put it like we sometimes only get herbs but you know sometimes things don't go our way you know we walk along and life ain't going too grand for us you know sometimes maybe the spread on the table isn't as grand as what it could be you know but there's always but we can always just fellowship in the love of god and just be happy through all of our trials or anything we can say lord i'm just i just rejoice whether i've got little or a lot i'm just rejoicing lord now i'm not saying the table of the lord doesn't provide a lot it does spiritually but i'm just using it as an analogy i'd rather have not much at the table of the lord than a whole lot with the with with hatred and strife that's why brother brown said i'd rather drink soda water and eat dry crackers you know and be serving the lord i'll be happier there just give me that you know that's that's what we'd rather have next one please i'm going to cover two more thoughts then we're going to pray sir we only live by dead substance i don't care what you eat you eat vegetables you eat you eat bread the wheat died if you eat corn the corn died if you eat beans the beans died whatever you eat you can only live physically because something died that you could live something has got to die for you to partake of any table to enjoy some food at any table something has to die for you to be there otherwise you can eat cardboard no even cardboard eventually had to die the men in world war one had eight boot leather when they got very hungry because it was skin they could boil the boot leather up and eat it but in order for you to live like you can't eat you can't you couldn't live off rocks or some substance that doesn't have life to it you couldn't live off that you need to have something with life has to die for you to partake of of of the table every single day something's dying for us naturally something has to die if you want to live and if nothing dies for you you die next one i've got a thought coming here but we've had our fellowship with each other as we have served this wonderful meal tonight across the table as we fed our physical bodies and now we'd like for god to feed our soul on his manner that's hid only for those preachers entered into the whole list of holies is permitted to eat of his food i put that quote in there because spiritually if we want to eat from the table this benefit that we have to eat from the table of the lord we have only gotten that benefit because somebody has died that we could go and pay be a partaker of that table like when the priest went into the holiest of holies something had to die in order for them to enter into that place and then they could partake of that hidden manner but something had to die in order for them to enter in and this table of the lord that we we we eat from somebody had to die in order for us to enjoy that it didn't come for nothing something had to die and all for in order for us to live spiritually something else something's got to die and the lord actually died for us so that we could partake of that table if he didn't we couldn't partake of it we couldn't enter in that that's that's what the lord has done in order for us to even pray tonight life has been given that we could go and pray that we can pray this evening life has been given that we could live last one i've got here jesus says in revelation behold i stand at the door and knock i like this verse if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me we'll come we'll have a meal we'll sit down we'll have a meal together we'll talk about it we'll talk about things we'll we'll build a relationship you can let's talk let's fellowship and i'm so glad that the lord the lord has
