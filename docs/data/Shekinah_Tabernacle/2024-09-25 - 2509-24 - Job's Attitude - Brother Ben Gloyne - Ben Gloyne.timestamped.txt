[24:21] have
[24:22] um just a bit of a just a bit of a
[24:24] thought here we um it's prayer meeting
[24:26] night tonight I want to go to I want to
[24:29] go to job uh chapter
[24:31] 1 and we're just going to read a couple
[24:34] of scriptures so I don't have a um I

[24:38] we're going to do it old
[24:41] school job
[24:44] 56 you'll have different page numbers to
[24:50] me amen so Job chapter 1 and vers
[24:56] 13 and
[25:03] 14 1 and
[25:05] 14 yep here we are
[25:07] now and there was a day when his sons
[25:11] and his daughters were eating and
[25:12] drinking wine in their eldest brother's
[25:14] house no sorry that's not the right one
[25:17] it's what happens when you drop things
[25:18] down on your phone now we're going up to
[25:20] verse sorry verse six now there was a
[25:23] day when the sons of God came to present
[25:25] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[25:27] came also among them and the Lord said
[25:29] unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan
[25:31] answered the Lord and said from going to
[25:33] and fro in the earth and from walking up
[25:36] and down in it and the Lord said unto
[25:38] Satan hast thou considered my servant
[25:40] job there is none like him in the earth
[25:42] a perfect and an upright man one that
[25:44] feareth God and esth Evil then Satan
[25:48] answered the Lord and said do job fear
[25:50] God for not Hast not Thou made an hedge
[25:53] about him and about his house and about
[25:55] all that he hath on every side thou H
[25:57] has blessed the work of of his hands and
[25:58] his substance is increased in the land
[26:01] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[26:02] all that he hath and he will curse thee
[26:05] to thy
[26:07] face amen may the Lord bless his word
[26:09] you may have your seats uh tonight I
[26:12] want to talk about you know you see here
[26:15] uh in this in the scripture we see the
[26:17] devil's attitude and we see God's
[26:19] attitude and then we'll come into job's
[26:21] attitude now we understand from
[26:24] historians they say that the Book of Job
[26:26] is the oldest uh book It Was Written
[26:29] even before Moses was inspired to write
[26:31] the first five books of the Bible and
[26:33] people say that uh job lived at the same
[26:35] time as uh Abraham did so around that
[26:37] time and there's many different uh uh
[26:40] takes on it but but to me it's the
[26:41] oldest book in the Bible and to me it's
[26:43] very interesting how it is the oldest
[26:44] book because uh it is showing the
[26:47] devil's attitude towards the believer
[26:48] it's showing God's attitude towards the
[26:50] believer and it's showing the believer's
[26:52] attitude in the trial amen and and and
[26:55] we know uh the Devil is a creature of
[26:57] habit so how he starts is how he's going
[26:59] to finish so if he thought about
[27:01] Believers like that then he's going to
[27:02] think about Believers like that now amen
[27:05] so we can see his attitude was is uh
[27:07] that we read is that you know the
[27:09] devil's attitude was you know the only
[27:11] reason that job served God is because
[27:13] God blessed him and how how how uh how
[27:18] how that is the same thing today where
[27:20] where you can even hear some people's
[27:22] attitudes you know where people say well
[27:23] if God is really God and if God is
[27:26] really a good God then why why does he
[27:30] allow suffering and hardship and if he's
[27:33] really the God of all glory the most
[27:35] powerful one why does he allow suffering
[27:37] to come into the Earth and you know
[27:38] there's always this question that that
[27:40] that lingers around and you know even
[27:43] even the uh disciples or rather when
[27:45] Jesus was on the cross you know the
[27:46] Pharisees and said said if you're really
[27:48] the son of God come off the cross and
[27:49] we'll believe you you know trying to
[27:51] trying to get God to fulfill his word
[27:53] how they wanted him to fulfill it but
[27:56] you see now um but God God God is uh
[27:59] greater than our understanding in one
[28:01] sense because we got to realize the
[28:03] reason that the world is in chaos is
[28:05] because of the accuser has made it that
[28:07] way so the one who's saying if God is
[28:09] really such a good God and why does he
[28:10] allow these things is the one who
[28:12] actually engineered this whole thing now
[28:13] we understand that God knowing the end
[28:16] from the beginning knew the fall would
[28:17] take place right he wasn't surprised
[28:19] when Adam and Eve fell he but he he
[28:22] allowed it to happen because God wanted
[28:24] to manifest the fullness of his
[28:26] character and nature to his children
[28:28] because we understand God does not want
[28:30] robots through eternity saying holy holy
[28:32] holy sure the S seraphim they they you
[28:35] they Praise Him day and night but God
[28:37] wants more than just a robotic learned
[28:40] behavior he wants a sincere relationship
[28:43] a Thanksgiving amen because remember
[28:46] when when when we're GED gathered around
[28:48] the throne who are really going to be
[28:49] the worshippers not the Angels like
[28:51] brother Braham says that when the Great
[28:53] redeemed of all ages go out March up
[28:55] into glory and we begin to sing Amazing
[28:57] Grace how sweet the sound the angels
[28:59] will bow their heads and they won't be
[29:00] able to join us because they don't know
[29:01] the meaning of that song they never
[29:03] receed the revelation of that because
[29:05] they were never lost they were never
[29:06] redeemed am mean God never shed his
[29:08] blood upon the Earth to redeem them but
[29:10] he redeemed you and I amen so we can
[29:13] sing such songs like that and amazing
[29:14] love how great it be that my God would
[29:16] die for me and you know Swing Low Sweet
[29:18] Chariot coming forward to carry me home
[29:20] and you know uh we can sing many you
[29:22] know I'm going to walk right up into a
[29:24] body change amen the Angels can't sing
[29:26] that but we can sing that amen there's
[29:28] many songs they cannot sing because they
[29:30] never had the experience so God wants
[29:32] people to worship him out of experience
[29:35] out of Revelation amen that's why God
[29:38] allowed this you know the fall to take
[29:40] place is because there's a lot of
[29:41] attributes of God that Adam and Eve
[29:43] could never know in a perfect world Amen
[29:46] it took see see all the devil did was
[29:48] release God in his fullness upon the
[29:51] Earth everything the devil does
[29:52] backfires amen we got to understand that
[29:54] everything he does backfires on himself
[29:57] amen you even look at you even Jesus
[29:59] dying on Calvary if if the devil really
[30:02] knew this is going to be my worst day in
[30:06] my existence is this day worse than
[30:08] being cast out of Heaven worse than
[30:10] being defeated on every Hand by the
[30:12] prophets this is going to be my worst
[30:14] day I'm going to regret this day major
[30:17] if he really knew that he would never
[30:19] have touched him he would never have
[30:20] laid one stripe upon Jesus's back he
[30:22] would never allowed one nail he would
[30:25] never have let one Pharisee rip any
[30:26] beard out spit it him mock none of that
[30:28] would have happened you see so
[30:30] everything the devil does backfires upon
[30:32] Him amen and it's the same thing today
[30:35] friends he's made this this Eden that we
[30:37] live in but it's actually going to
[30:39] backfire on him and it is backfiring on
[30:41] him because God has a people upon the
[30:43] Earth presently that I'm looking to I
[30:45] mean that God has created to walk in
[30:48] this chaos of a confusion of a world but
[30:50] yet walk with God hallelujah but yet
[30:53] walk with God so you see so Satan always
[30:56] thinks well the only reason that that um
[30:59] now we know rather go uh backtracking
[31:01] you know God put man on free moral
[31:03] agency so when he put Adam and Eve
[31:05] having dominion over the Earth he put
[31:07] them on free moral agency that whatever
[31:09] they did was up to them and they because
[31:12] of the the deceitfulness of the devil
[31:15] they actually gave him dominion over the
[31:17] Earth the Dominion they had they lost it
[31:20] became slaves that the Fallen Angel
[31:23] would become the king and that's the
[31:25] reason why we have sickness disease
[31:27] sorrow pain pain death destruction you
[31:30] know typhoons hurricanes tsunami
[31:32] Cyclones all these things is because the
[31:34] prince of the power of the air so he
[31:36] causes it then he comes you and says if
[31:39] God's really
[31:40] God why does he why does he allow these
[31:42] things why does he do this if he's if he
[31:45] really loves you he asks you that
[31:47] question does he not why are you in the
[31:49] stat you and why why is he allowed you
[31:51] see and the thing is we don't understand
[31:53] like brother B says God's love is far
[31:55] greater than what we think love really
[31:57] is amen like brother Arman preached a
[31:59] couple of Wednesdays ago his love is far
[32:02] more Supreme because we think that that
[32:05] love is like a parental care right you
[32:07] see your children they're about to fall
[32:09] off a precipice or hurt themselves
[32:10] whatever you'll scoop them up you won't
[32:12] let them get injured
[32:14] none okay most of the parents are like
[32:17] that yeah you don't want to see your
[32:18] kids get hurt cut themselves whatever
[32:20] more and scrape and make mistakes and
[32:22] all these things but brother Bram says
[32:24] God's love is not like that God's love
[32:26] is elective love I mean even when in the
[32:28] Book of Malachi where where Israel would
[32:30] say how do we know God loves us you know
[32:33] and and then and then Malachi would
[32:34] speak about these things that God's love
[32:36] is elective the reason he he's proven
[32:38] his love is because he has chosen you he
[32:42] has chosen you and he says he loves you
[32:44] that's his love he'll let you go all
[32:46] through kind all through he'll let you
[32:48] go through all kinds of things but that
[32:50] doesn't mean he doesn't love you that
[32:52] doesn't mean he's not proud of you that
[32:53] doesn't mean that you're you're not his
[32:55] child or he displeased with any way no
[32:58] God is allowing you to go through these
[33:00] things because God wants to reveal
[33:01] something to you in that trial that you
[33:04] never would have received amen amen just
[33:06] like job here now so that's the question
[33:09] God you the devil always says the only
[33:11] reason people worship you God is because
[33:13] everything's going fine for them and and
[33:16] and the devil said look just just put
[33:18] just just touch him touch all he hath
[33:20] and he'll curse you to your face and God
[33:22] basically said I don't believe you he
[33:24] doesn't believe Satan right and God and
[33:28] God showed Satan that he was wrong okay
[33:31] now job did not understand that this
[33:33] conversation had taken place but God had
[33:36] confidence in job right but not in his
[33:39] mental ability not in his ability as a
[33:42] human to serve God but God put conf had
[33:45] confidence in the soul of job the inside
[33:48] of the inside which is greater than
[33:50] because remember job would have had a
[33:51] lot of Mind battles you read the book of
[33:53] Job his friends came along to him you
[33:55] think the ones who would give him
[33:56] Comfort the ones that would open the
[33:58] word and actually give him consolation
[34:00] and stability and his trial and they
[34:02] were doing the opposite it' be hard
[34:04] because they were his closest friends
[34:05] they weren't his enemies they weren't
[34:07] the ones that actually hated job were
[34:09] jealous of job they were job's friends
[34:11] right so so all of this would have been
[34:13] playing in his mind where one by one
[34:14] they accused him basically job let's
[34:17] just summarize this real quick job
[34:18] you're a secret Sinner and you deserved
[34:20] everything you've
[34:21] received and they came with all
[34:23] different kind of angles you know right
[34:25] but then but something in job said no
[34:28] I don't understand this I don't know
[34:31] what's going on but I know I'm righteous
[34:35] I and the reason the reason that he
[34:37] could stand there that way is because he
[34:38] had complete confidence in the blood of
[34:41] the Lamb that he offered he didn't have
[34:43] confidence in himself he had confidence
[34:45] in his lamb amen and that's and that's
[34:48] how he could stand the way he could
[34:50] stand now job would come let's go to uh
[34:53] job 13 and I'm going to read verses um
[34:56] 14 and 15 I hope I got this this
[34:58] time if not well we'll find it we'll
[35:02] start reading job
[35:04] 13 and verses 14 and 15 now this is this
[35:08] is the believer's attitude we come to a
[35:10] place we come to this
[35:13] place job 1314 and
[35:18] 15 he says wherefore do I take my flesh
[35:22] in my teeth and put my life in my hand
[35:24] though he slay me yet will I trust in
[35:27] him but I will maintain my own ways
[35:29] before him so he came to a place as
[35:31] though he slay me I'm still going to
[35:32] trust him anyway so whatever's going on
[35:34] in my life I'm going to trust him he's
[35:36] going to see me through am I going to
[35:38] come out the other side I don't know but
[35:39] I'm going to trust him that's the main
[35:41] thing amen amen that's the main thing
[35:43] that was job's attitude and we know that
[35:45] through through job's great trials he
[35:47] could stand there and said now I know my
[35:49] redeemer liveth right now I and I will
[35:52] stand I said in my flesh I see God I'll
[35:54] stand with him on the latter part of the
[35:56] you know in the last days he'll stand
[35:59] upon the Earth with him these
[36:00] Revelations struck him because he stood
[36:03] there in the trial see it's amazing how
[36:04] God will use hardship for us to be drawn
[36:08] closer to him cuz God wants to reveal
[36:10] himself in all the trouble now we're
[36:12] going to realize now I'm going to do a
[36:14] massive segue to to Lake Michigan right
[36:16] now and then we're going to then we're
[36:17] going to wrap up now well actually we'll
[36:19] go here first brother Braham said that
[36:22] God wanted to show Abraham who Abraham
[36:24] was he makes that statement he wanted to
[36:26] show Abra AB who Abraham really was now
[36:29] when you read through the life of
[36:31] Abraham there's a lot of spots that if
[36:33] Abraham could have stood next to Moses
[36:35] when Moses is writing down the account
[36:37] of his life he would have taken the
[36:39] quill out of Moses's hand and said don't
[36:41] write
[36:42] that here's the father of the faith
[36:47] okay I don't know I I was thinking about
[36:50] this the other day here is this man he
[36:53] goes he backslides out of the promised
[36:54] land not once but twice he uses his own
[36:57] wife as a
[36:58] shield tell you're my
[37:02] sister and then and then he actually
[37:04] unless God intervene not the you know if
[37:07] God did not intervene on both those
[37:09] times she would have ended up marrying
[37:11] the king of that land can you
[37:16] imagine the emotion the
[37:20] feeling of after the first time and then
[37:23] after the second time and then Moses
[37:25] writes that down as he's inspired to
[37:27] write about your life see and then there
[37:29] was a time when God came to and said
[37:31] you're going to be the father of Nations
[37:32] and and Abraham rolls on the floor in
[37:36] the presence of God laughing at God who
[37:39] just gave the
[37:42] promise all of those things was not God
[37:46] showing Abraham who Abraham was right
[37:49] are you following me many times we just
[37:51] remember those kind of moments that the
[37:54] moments we're really not proud of the
[37:56] moments that we wish we could just just
[37:57] rewind the tape and do a whole different
[38:00] kind of you know you learn what not to
[38:02] do after you've done it right but that's
[38:05] that that was not God allowed Abraham to
[38:07] go through those things but he wanted
[38:09] Abraham to realize that's not really you
[38:11] Abraham that may be the human part of
[38:14] you but that's not the part I have
[38:15] confidence in the confidence I have
[38:18] Abraham I've got the the confidence I
[38:19] have in you Abraham is that seed I've
[38:21] placed inside you amen that when God
[38:24] actually gave him the promise he said
[38:25] and Abraham beli God and it was
[38:28] accounted to him for righteousness right
[38:30] so there was a lot of there was a lot of
[38:32] other things that were covering Abraham
[38:34] but it wasn't who Abraham was now if
[38:37] you've ever I sorry I didn't get any
[38:39] photos but you go Google a a lake or a
[38:42] river or something that's that's that's
[38:44] just full of trash and and you know logs
[38:46] floating and you know who's ever seen
[38:48] that kind of a you know storm comes down
[38:49] and you know the lake and there's
[38:51] there's rubbish and there's logs and
[38:53] there's all the stuff floating around
[38:55] none of that is the lake none of that is
[38:58] the lake but many times people look at a
[39:00] lake and they see all the debris and the
[39:02] rubbish and they think that's the lake
[39:04] just like the bad parts like Abraham you
[39:06] know when he laughed at God he you know
[39:08] hid behind his wife that's like the
[39:10] that's like the sticks and the logs and
[39:12] the rubbish in the lake but that but
[39:14] that wasn't Abraham right that's like
[39:16] you and I we've got a lot of things like
[39:17] that that's not us right and the devil
[39:19] wants those things to pile into us like
[39:21] fear and worry and regret and and um you
[39:25] know feeling like guilt and things he
[39:27] wants those things to cover up our Lake
[39:30] right but then God sends a Revival he
[39:33] sends a wind blowing amen and then you
[39:36] see things that were submerged in the
[39:38] lake you see it blowing up on the on the
[39:41] beach on the shore and then you can see
[39:43] man I can't believe that was in the lake
[39:46] there's a shopping trolley you know
[39:47] there's a car you know there's this big
[39:49] log that looked like nothing but when it
[39:51] comes out you really see it for what it
[39:52] was but remember none of that is the
[39:54] lake it may be in the lake for a certain
[39:56] season but then the wind begins to blow
[39:59] because God doesn't want the lake to
[40:01] stay all filled with trash and rubbish
[40:02] it's like us we're like the lake I mean
[40:05] we're like the lake brother Ram says you
[40:07] know when he saw Lake Michigan all the
[40:08] waves are jumping the wind is blowing
[40:10] and you know he asked a question what's
[40:12] happening with that Lake and he says
[40:13] that lake is having a Revival I mean the
[40:16] same amount of water before the wind
[40:18] blows and after blows is in the lake but
[40:20] what happens is the wind comes down
[40:22] blows over that Lake and all the trash
[40:24] and all the stuff that's submerged in
[40:25] there that shouldn't be in there that's
[40:26] not part of the the lake is blown up
[40:28] over onto the onto the seashore onto the
[40:31] onto the beach of the lake Hallelujah so
[40:33] so what does God want to do he wants the
[40:35] his wind to blow because many times we
[40:38] see this big log floating in
[40:41] us some something has happened in our
[40:44] life you know I imagine uh Abraham and
[40:46] Sarah when they leave I can't remember
[40:48] where they went through Egypt or the
[40:50] Philistines I can't remember which
[40:51] account was the first but I imagine when
[40:54] they rode out of that country after God
[40:56] has Paul actually intervened and said
[40:59] this man uh this this woman that you're
[41:01] going to marry is actually Abraham's
[41:03] wife you know and then and then the king
[41:06] gets mad at Abraham and all these things
[41:07] but yet God says he's my prophet he
[41:09] he'll pray for you who's read the
[41:11] accounts I imagine when they are riding
[41:13] out of that country I don't think they
[41:15] were having a nice Ticky tour and
[41:18] enjoying the scenery it would have been
[41:19] a real
[41:21] tense real maybe it would have been a a
[41:24] long silence
[41:27] and then the second time it probably
[41:29] would have been a little bit longer cuz
[41:30] she would have been thinking I can't
[41:32] believe he did it
[41:34] again you
[41:37] see but that wasn't who Abraham really
[41:40] was amen I'm I believe you're getting my
[41:43] point there's a lot of things like log
[41:44] that that would have been a big log that
[41:46] would have been not just little twig
[41:48] floating around on Abraham's leg that
[41:49] was a massive thing right but God
[41:52] brought his Holy Spirit and blew that
[41:54] out of Abraham amen blew that fear of
[41:57] man and that worry and all those things
[41:59] God wanted Abraham to see no I've made
[42:01] you father of Nations amen he allowed
[42:04] lot to be caught up in a war going on
[42:06] and Abraham to arm his servants because
[42:09] God wanted Abraham to see who Abraham
[42:11] really was he wasn't a coward amen he
[42:14] was a mighty conqueror because God made
[42:16] him thus right so I believe at the
[42:20] moment God is really wanting us to see
[42:22] who we really are not your Humanity not
[42:25] Abraham's Humanity I mean that's why
[42:27] Paul would write Abraham's um let's go
[42:29] to it shall we I think it's Romans 4 or5
[42:32] let's go sword drill four oh my there's
[42:36] a master swordswoman right there amen oh
[42:40] you often tell Christine her reactions
[42:41] are faster than mine I'm like I'm glad
[42:43] we don't have a
[42:44] shootout I'd be
[42:46] dead that's true anyway Romans the Swiss
[42:50] you got to watch
[42:54] them Romans 4
[42:57] let's go down to verse I believe it is
[43:00] um let's read from verse 17 actually
[43:03] let's read from verse 13 let's read a
[43:05] bit shall we am see because
[43:07] remember Moses would read would would
[43:10] write the commentaries of a of a lot of
[43:12] saints lives through the blood of bulls
[43:14] and goats where the blood of bulls and
[43:15] goats just covered up sin right it
[43:17] didn't take away sin so all the humanity
[43:20] of the Believers are very much written
[43:21] in the Old Testament which to me they're
[43:25] they're an example so I'm glad they're
[43:26] there but but when when but when the
[43:28] Apostle Paul would write about the same
[43:30] Believers lives you don't see those
[43:32] things written why because the blood of
[43:34] Jesus Christ has cleared that debt amen
[43:37] amen completely not just covered it
[43:39] annihilated it taken away that the true
[43:42] them can be written down remember the
[43:44] true of them was already there but it
[43:45] was I will follow me okay I trust I'm
[43:47] making sense to me I'm well I'm happy
[43:50] okay so anyway um Romans 4:13 for the
[43:53] promise that he should be the ear of the
[43:54] world was not to Abraham or to a SE
[43:57] through the law but through the
[43:58] righteousness of faith for if they which
[44:01] are of the law be ears faith is made
[44:03] void and the promises of none effect
[44:06] because the law worketh wrath for where
[44:09] no law is there is no transgression
[44:11] therefore it is of faith that it might
[44:13] be by grace to the end the promise might
[44:16] be sure to all the seed not to that only
[44:20] which is of the law but to that which is
[44:22] of the faith of Abraham who is the
[44:24] father of us all as it is written I have
[44:27] made thee a father of many nations
[44:29] before him whom he believed even God who
[44:31] Quicken the dead and calleth those
[44:33] things which be not as though they were
[44:35] who against hope believed in hope that
[44:38] he might become the father of many
[44:40] nations according pardon me to that
[44:42] which was spoken so shall thy seed be
[44:45] and being not weak in faith he
[44:46] considered not his own body now dead
[44:48] when he was about hundred years old
[44:50] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[44:52] he staggered not at the promise of God
[44:54] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[44:56] giv glory to God and being fully
[44:59] persuaded that what he had promised he
[45:01] was also able uh able also to perform
[45:04] therefore it was imputed to him for
[45:06] righteousness now it was not written for
[45:08] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[45:10] him but for us also to whom shall be
[45:13] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[45:16] up Jesus our lord from the dead who was
[45:20] delivered for our offenses and was
[45:22] raised again for our
[45:23] justification so that's that's Paul and
[45:26] SP remember Paul knew Abraham's life in
[45:29] the Book of Genesis but when God
[45:32] inspired him to write it he didn't write
[45:34] about what came into his Lake he wrote
[45:37] about Abraham who he really
[45:39] was right and God is God is I believe
[45:43] through the messages come to show us
[45:46] there'll be a lot of dead branches
[45:48] coming to you coming to your Lake that's
[45:50] not who you are that doesn't don't let
[45:52] it Define you hallelujah amen you say
[45:55] well I've got a lot of debris floating
[45:57] around just let the Holy Ghost blow it
[45:59] out amen let him take the guilt and the
[46:02] shame and the anxiety and the whatever's
[46:04] happened in the past then say Lord blow
[46:06] it out of me it's not part of me it's
[46:09] it's causing me trouble but it's not
[46:11] me amen amen and then let and then
[46:14] because remember the lake is the same
[46:16] before the storm and after the storm
[46:17] instead of in Terms of contents of water
[46:20] what's happened the trashes are blowing
[46:21] up on the on the beach then what can you
[46:25] do say praise God I can't believe it was
[46:28] that bad but it's not in me anymore and
[46:30] that's the main
[46:32] thing amen I think I'm just going to
[46:34] leave it there tonight I trust that
[46:37] would help somebody amen but you see
[46:40] now may God show us who we really are
[46:44] hallah not not this guy this guy amen
[46:48] job went through incredible trials but
[46:51] God wanted to show job who he really
[46:54] was amen and we go through incredible

[46:59] show himself in those trials to show who
[47:01] you really are you're made of Greater
