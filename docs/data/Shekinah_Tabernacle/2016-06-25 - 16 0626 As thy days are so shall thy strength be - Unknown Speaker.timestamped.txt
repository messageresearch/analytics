[40:47] amen
[40:50] hallelujah amen let's just turn
[40:52] to I want to go to a Song of Solomon
[40:55] Chapter 6 where we're just going to read
[40:56] one verse there and then we're going to
[40:59] go to Deuteronomy chapter
[41:08] 33 it's the Song of Solomon Chapter 6
[41:11] and verse
[41:20] 13
[41:25] amen
[41:28] H you love this
[41:31] morning he says now return return oh oh
[41:37] shunamite return return that we may look
[41:41] upon thee what will you see in in the
[41:44] shite
[41:46] shite and the answer is as it were the
[41:49] company of two
[41:51] Aries we got to Deuteronomy chapter
[41:53] 33 now you say that's a pretty obscure
[41:57] kind of piece of
[41:58] scripture
[42:03] well got to Lord willing I'll see what
[42:07] the Lord will do now Deuteronomy 33 and:
[42:13] 25 now we understand that that the
[42:16] scripture this isn't just to Ash of the
[42:18] tribe it's to every believer all
[42:21] generations it says thy shoes shall be
[42:23] iron and
[42:24] brass and as thy day so shall thy
[42:27] strength be there is none like unto the
[42:30] god of of of jaram which is actually
[42:33] Israel who rideth upon the heaven in thy
[42:36] help and in his Excellency on the sky
[42:38] the Eternal God Is Thy refuge and
[42:40] underneath are the Everlasting Arms and
[42:42] he shall Thrust out the enemy from
[42:44] before thee and shall say destroy
[42:49] them amen let's just keep reading uh
[42:52] Israel then shall dwell in safety alone
[42:54] the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon the
[42:56] land of corn and wine also his Heaven
[42:58] shall drop down due happy Art Thou o
[43:01] Israel who is like unto thee Oh people
[43:03] saved by the Lord The Shield of thy help
[43:06] and who is the sword of thy Excellency
[43:08] and thine enemies shall be found Liars
[43:10] unto thee and thou shallal tread upon
[43:13] their high places may the Lord bless his
[43:15] word you may be
[43:17] seated
[43:20] Hallelujah
[43:22] now I want to read a couple other parts
[43:26] of scripture if you want to go to Isaiah
[43:27] chap 59 with
[43:30] me you know it's
[43:34] incredible where if you look really what
[43:36] we
[43:37] have look who you
[43:39] are you know I want to I want to take a
[43:43] wait let's just read this and then I'll
[43:45] let's just read this Isaiah 59 very very
[43:48] uh familiar piece of scripture
[43:50] here if we read from um Isaiah
[43:54] 59 and and verse
[44:00] 19 it says so shall they fear the name
[44:04] of the Lord from the west and from the
[44:06] glory of from the rising of the Sun and
[44:08] we know the sun is risen in this day
[44:10] when the enemy shall come in like a
[44:12] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[44:14] up a standard against him and the
[44:16] Redeemer shall come to Zion remember the
[44:18] Zion is remember Zion is the bride and
[44:20] unto them um and unto them that turn
[44:23] from transgression in Jacob sayeth the
[44:25] Lord as for me this is my Covenant with
[44:27] them sayth the Lord my spirit that is
[44:29] upon thee and my words which I have put
[44:32] in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy
[44:34] mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed
[44:37] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[44:40] sayth the Lord from hence forth and
[44:42] forever I want to I want to talk about I
[44:45] want to take a I want to take that
[44:47] second part of the verse 25 in
[44:48] Deuteronomy 33 and as thy days shall so
[44:52] shall thy strength be and I want to I
[44:56] want to pose a question now now the
[44:59] reason I read that is because because as
[45:00] your days are so how evil the enemy is
[45:03] how evil the your your opponent is so
[45:05] shall your strength be to overcome that
[45:07] enemy amen hallelujah and now we read
[45:11] that scripture and and I'm just trying
[45:13] to gather this all together but we read
[45:14] that scripture in the Song of Solomon
[45:16] because there was a a question went
[45:18] forth because this this this this
[45:20] shunamite here the shulamite forget
[45:22] about I pronounce it properly that is
[45:24] actually speaking of you speaking of of
[45:26] of the bride of Christ and and we see
[45:28] the question now is the question now
[45:30] what will you see you know what will you
[45:33] see in in the shunamite and the answer
[45:35] is as it were the company of two armies
[45:38] and now this company of two armies is is
[45:41] very important because the question is
[45:43] posed what do you see in yourself you
[45:45] know it's all very well to look at maybe
[45:47] brother brandom and say what a mighty
[45:49] you know God live through his life in an
[45:50] incredible way and you may look at a
[45:52] brother or sister in church and say and
[45:55] and admire how how God lives in their
[45:56] life in an incredible way but what do
[45:58] you see when you see yourself I mean
[46:01] what do you see when you look down in
[46:02] yourself because we must understand that
[46:05] is not just us this is not just a
[46:07] religion this is just not just a club
[46:09] this is not just a natural Gathering of
[46:10] man but there is a supernatural power
[46:13] behind the bride of Christ amen that all
[46:15] power is behind the believer we must
[46:17] understand this all power of Heaven is
[46:20] is is backing you up if you stand for
[46:22] God in his word God will sure stand for
[46:24] you and so now the question is what do
[46:27] you see when you look at yourself
[46:29] because this company of two armies this
[46:31] word armies here in my Bible there's a
[46:34] CR CR reference to to uh Mahan in in
[46:39] Genesis chapter 32 and verse two we have
[46:43] Jacob and and and Jacob went on his way
[46:46] and the angels of God met him and when
[46:48] Jacob saw them he said this is God's
[46:51] host and he called the name of that
[46:53] place Maham so he he recognized that
[46:56] that it was a place of of of two camps
[46:58] or two armies because there was there
[47:00] was an Angelic host that came to meet
[47:02] him so there was a realm was open to him
[47:04] that he had no there about there were
[47:06] Angels there and not just was there a
[47:08] host of angels there was there was his
[47:10] people there so it was a place where
[47:12] Heaven and Earth United together and
[47:15] this is the same word of this of this
[47:18] company of two armies so the bride now
[47:21] what do you see when you see yourself do
[47:23] you see a natural person do you see a
[47:25] natural believer do you see a natural
[47:26] family or do you see that unseen one
[47:30] hallelujah amen do you see that unseen
[47:32] one that's with
[47:33] you what do you see I just want to throw
[47:36] that question out because what you see
[47:38] is what you'll lean upon if you see God
[47:40] you'll lean upon God you'll draw your
[47:42] strength from him but if you just see a
[47:44] natural understanding and reasoning and
[47:46] this is what I think I should do in life
[47:47] and I've got to work things out you'll
[47:49] lean that way our our strength comes
[47:52] from the Lord amen amen our strength
[47:54] does not come from our top two inches in
[47:56] this little Noggin amen our strength and
[47:59] and our and our leadership and our
[48:01] understanding comes from him amen
[48:03] hallelujah amen we are and this this
[48:06] place of of Mahan name is very
[48:08] significant I know I've talked about
[48:10] these things before but just very
[48:12] briefly we know King David when he was
[48:14] on the run from Absalon he went to Mahan
[48:18] and then he went there and then after
[48:19] that he sent out his army and his army
[48:21] defeated Epsilon he was and it's
[48:23] significant where they go in the you in
[48:25] the scripture it's significant the
[48:27] places they go to and so he was going to
[48:29] a place where Heaven and Earth were
[48:31] present together he went to a place to
[48:34] draw strength for the battle ahead he
[48:37] was a fugitive from the throne
[48:38] everything looked like it was lost but
[48:40] he didn't depend upon
[48:41] himself amen he depended upon God and he
[48:44] went to a place Hallelujah where there
[48:47] was a company of two armies there the
[48:49] visible and the
[48:51] invisible in time of trouble you say
[48:54] well that's neat that's a nice story
[48:55] that's not a story friends right David's
[48:58] living out you amen that's right amen if
[49:01] he went to a place where he could draw
[49:03] Supernatural strength you ought to go to
[49:05] that same kind of place amen amen
[49:08] remember he is the strength of our life
[49:10] amen hallelujah Glory I don't know
[49:13] what's going on don't draw
[49:15] natural understanding natural uh this is
[49:19] how things should be you draw you draw
[49:21] strength from him amen
[49:23] amen now so but I want to pose this
[49:27] question to you now we understand as I
[49:29] said the shunamite is the bride and the
[49:32] question really poses what do you see in
[49:34] you see the devil I just I just throw
[49:37] this out here the devil all he wants to
[49:39] do is cut that
[49:40] Lifeline he wants to take you away from
[49:43] the supernatural presence of God that's
[49:45] right that's what he wants to do not
[49:46] just at church if he can he'll keep us
[49:48] all away from this place because there's
[49:50] a spirit of Deliverance in this place
[49:52] there's God's anointing in this place
[49:53] we're Washed by the Water of the word
[49:55] the devil tries to clamp things upon us
[49:57] then the word comes forth and it washes
[49:59] us so he wants to keep us away from
[50:01] hearing the word of God the anointed
[50:03] word of God he wants to keep us from our
[50:05] prayer life amen he wants to keep us
[50:07] from drawing strength from the word of
[50:09] the hour right because we don't us we're
[50:13] not drawing physical things you got
[50:15] understand if you really know him you
[50:17] have a spring of living water coming out
[50:19] of you amen and and and that is a spirit
[50:21] of God coming out of you you got to tap
[50:23] into that yes am don't let a log Jam get
[50:26] in there of circumstance or resentment
[50:28] or or or or unforgiveness don't let
[50:31] those things get caught in there draw
[50:32] from what's in you
[50:34] amen I trust you have that in you amen
[50:38] there's more I I probably said it a few
[50:40] times there's more there's more in this
[50:42] building than what you see with the
[50:44] natural eye all of God is here Heaven Is
[50:47] Here angels have come to work what you
[50:49] worship God they don't know what it's
[50:51] like to be redeemed we know and there's
[50:54] come a time and and and and now is where
[50:56] where where they have to watch and they
[50:58] can't sing the songs we sing cuz they
[51:00] don't understand
[51:01] Redemption amen remember angels are sent
[51:03] to minister unto the ear of Salvation
[51:05] there's angels in this room God's in
[51:07] this room amen we're two or three
[51:10] gathered in my name there I am in the
[51:12] midst that's not just nice that's not
[51:14] just nice language it's a reality am
[51:16] hallelujah
[51:18] amen
[51:20] now I want to go into what's been
[51:22] happening this week I want you to
[51:23] understand what's been happening now
[51:26] amen we read well it says we yeah we
[51:28] read there in Isaiah well sorry this is
[51:30] in Isaiah chapter 10 remember well we
[51:32] read in 59 when the enemy comes in like
[51:35] a flood I'll raise up a standard that's
[51:37] what he said he said he will and he has
[51:40] he has hallelujah amen and then Isaiah
[51:43] 10:27 and it shall come to pass in that
[51:46] day that his burden shall be taken away
[51:48] from off his shoulder and his yoke from
[51:51] off thy neck and the Yoke shall be
[51:53] destroyed because of the anointing amen
[51:55] this is what God's promised because of
[51:56] his anointing the Yoke will be broken
[51:59] the Yoke will be destroyed amen
[52:00] hallelujah hallelujah and this is what
[52:02] we have seen I just want to you know
[52:05] maybe have a bit of Liberty but you know
[52:08] you know sister Vanessa put on the
[52:09] WhatsApp she was she was afraid but
[52:12] hesitant to go to go witnessing now a
[52:15] yoke inhibits real movement cuz because
[52:17] it's a burden you got to pack and if
[52:19] you're packing a burden you can't run
[52:20] like you want to run so it's a yoke Y
[52:24] and then what we have is is you know but
[52:27] as long as there's a desire in the heart
[52:29] you understand if there's a desire God
[52:31] will come and break whatever's holding
[52:33] that desire back and then so we prayed
[52:37] and then God came down amen took that
[52:40] fear away Hallelujah and then God Came
[52:43] Upon the scene and then the testimony
[52:45] came forth and that's exactly what has
[52:48] happened you read in the book of Acts
[52:51] and it says that they threatened the
[52:53] disciples you shall not preach in his
[52:54] name anymore they threatened them what
[52:56] were they trying to do put fear upon the
[52:58] Believers trying to intimidate them
[53:00] trying to yoke them that they couldn't
[53:01] live how they want to live and then they
[53:04] prayed and then it says now and it says
[53:07] and when they prayed the place was
[53:08] shaken where they were assembled
[53:10] together and they're all filled with the
[53:12] Holy Ghost and they spake the word of
[53:14] God with boldness so the anointing came
[53:16] down and broke that yok and if it's good
[53:18] back then it's good today Hallelujah to
[53:21] prove it's the same God do you
[53:24] understand what's going on in this place
[53:26] friends not just here but all over the
[53:27] world there's a book of Acts being
[53:29] written behind the bride of Christ
[53:31] Hallelujah he says he says in Christ is
[53:33] a mystery of God revealed but if that
[53:36] original vine ever puts out another
[53:38] Chute yes amen it'll bear grapes like it
[53:42] did the first time and if the life of
[53:45] Jesus Christ ever puts out another body
[53:47] of Believers hallelujah amen it'll bear
[53:50] the fruit that the first one did they'll
[53:52] write a book of book of Acts behind it
[53:54] called it's the same life see what I
[53:57] mean you just can't get away from it
[53:59] it's the Life of Christ in you being
[54:01] injected In You by the Holy Spirit
[54:02] itself living its life through you and
[54:05] that's exactly what we've seen am and if
[54:08] you and you say I don't really
[54:09] understand what's going on just open
[54:11] yourself and say Lord come and live in
[54:12] me Hallelujah cuz that's exactly what
[54:14] happened this week God came and broke
[54:16] the Yoke Hallelujah and then sister Nomi
[54:19] receives the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[54:21] hallelujah and I was talking to my wife
[54:23] on Saturday I said that's the indication
[54:25] that this is real because it births
[54:27] people into the kingdom it doesn't make
[54:29] them religious it changes their nature
[54:31] it changes their life and it lives out
[54:32] of them that's a Vindication that this
[54:34] message is the truth of the word because
[54:36] it produces the life that's in this word
[54:39] hallelujah you know people can try and
[54:41] argue it away I say just come look at
[54:42] some life come look at what it does to
[54:44] people and it doesn't make them love the
[54:46] prophet it makes them love Jesus Christ
[54:48] the word hallelujah yes sir that's
[54:51] exactly what it does so we must
[54:53] understand that there's more for us than
[54:54] against us I want to encourage you
[54:56] friends don't look at what you may be
[54:58] going through you got to recognize
[55:00] there's more than you in this battle me
[55:02] there's more than you in this walk and
[55:04] it's worth every inch of the way
[55:05] hallelujah hallelujah it's worth every
[55:07] struggle it's worth every disappointment
[55:10] it's worth every burden and everything
[55:11] you've got to carry it's worth every
[55:13] battle against the enemy every inch of
[55:16] the way it's worth itj Hallelujah just
[55:18] keep pressing friends don't feel you
[55:21] know oh I get so discouraged of myself
[55:24] just just just conf confess it to the
[55:25] Lord and walk on amen amen walk on with
[55:28] God he wants you to walk on with him
[55:30] amen hallelujah amen another book of
[55:33] Acts is being written yes sir
[55:36] now we have I'm just going to throw some
[55:38] statements out we have the mechanics and
[55:41] the Dynamics amen so you know you know
[55:44] brother baham says he says it's in the
[55:46] rising of the sun he uses the analogy of
[55:48] having two cars and they can be exactly
[55:51] the same and they can have all the
[55:52] finest you know engine and everything
[55:55] everything can be finally tuned but then
[55:57] if one doesn't have the spark plug I me
[56:00] because it's like he says well you pour
[56:02] gasoline in the tank how do you know
[56:04] it's gasoline because when you turn on
[56:05] the car it runs down the road to prove
[56:08] it's gasoline yeah he says he says you
[56:10] can have two cars perfectly the same but
[56:13] if one doesn't have the spark plug to
[56:15] fire the engine to prove that it's
[56:17] gasoline amen then that that car is
[56:20] useless that's right all the mechanics
[56:22] can be there but if there's not that
[56:24] thing that ignites the fuel that gets
[56:26] the engine turning over and going that's
[56:28] a waste of time that's right amen so we
[56:31] have we have the mechanics and the
[56:33] mechanics is the pure word of God Amen
[56:37] we have the perfect interpretation of
[56:39] the scripture amen we not looking for it
[56:42] we have
[56:43] it amen because in the days of the voice
[56:46] of the seventh angel all the mysteries
[56:48] of God should be finished and they are
[56:50] we're not wondering who we are we're not
[56:52] wondering who he is we're not wondering
[56:54] where we're going or where we are in
[56:55] time we knowen amen we know what he
[56:58] likes and what he doesn't like we're not
[57:01] guessing amen it's the Revelation now
[57:05] the Revelation contained in the message
[57:07] that is what is perfect it's not every
[57:10] single word it's the Revelation
[57:12] contained because he you know repeats
[57:15] himself the the and and all these things
[57:17] but if you take the revelation of it is
[57:19] this okay the revelation of it is
[57:22] perfect amen amen how do I know which is
[57:26] God and which is him just take it all
[57:27] from the Lord just take it all from the
[57:30] Lord yep that's right so the Revelation
[57:32] contained in the message that is perfect
[57:35] and that Revelation reveals Jesus Christ
[57:38] in the scripture not another Gospel of
[57:41] Jesus Christ but Christ in the Bible
[57:43] from Genesis to Revelation amen it's not
[57:46] another gospel we don't need a whole
[57:48] bunch of manuals to say well this is
[57:50] this it it is what it is yeah the
[57:53] message reveals Christ Here Am
[57:57] amen and this is proven we say well how
[58:00] do you know this because we're not here
[58:02] just to argue well this man says this
[58:04] this person says this this Bible School
[58:05] says this it goes beyond that it is
[58:09] proven because the Lord supernaturally
[58:12] backed up the prophet messenger and I'll
[58:14] say by scriptural
[58:16] Vindication now well what does
[58:18] scriptural Vindication mean it means
[58:20] that the Supernatural part of the
[58:22] ministry was shown in scripture to
[58:25] promised for the end time in which we're
[58:26] living in yeah that's why the prophet
[58:30] over and over repeated Luke 17 in the
[58:32] days of Noah as it was the days of lot
[58:34] so shall it be when the son of man is
[58:35] revealed he repeated it over and over
[58:38] again and then he would go back to
[58:40] Genesis 18 and when the Lord came down
[58:42] and and and appeared to Abraham and
[58:44] Sarah and Sarah was in the tent behind
[58:46] them and he says where is thy wife and
[58:48] you know Abraham says she's in the tent
[58:50] behind you and he says according to time
[58:51] of life I'm going to visit you you can
[58:53] have the promised son
[58:55] you know and then and then of course the
[58:56] Lord knew what she was thinking in her
[58:58] heart he repeats this over and over
[59:02] again and quite a few times now now
[59:05] there's a reason he's saying these
[59:07] things as is and thy seed shall possess
[59:09] the gates of his enemy in
[59:12] 59 he says let you know it's the same
[59:15] Angel I'll turn my back and he says
[59:19] right right straight behind me is a man
[59:22] he's praying for mother and father heart
[59:24] trouble and arthritis they come from our
[59:26] Kansas their name is Smith you believe
[59:28] with all your heart back there Mr and
[59:29] Mrs Smith go home and receive your
[59:31] healing and be made well in the name of
[59:33] Jesus Christ amen if you believe it with
[59:35] all your heart then go and receive it
[59:37] now just just keep praying somebody in
[59:39] this section there's a woman sitting in
[59:41] this Direction She's Got trouble with
[59:43] her back with her hip uh Mrs Kirby
[59:46] believe with all your heart do you then
[59:48] you go home and be well Mrs Kirby Jesus
[59:51] Christ makes you well do you believe the
[59:53] same angel of God SE of Abraham what's
[59:55] the matter there's a woman right out
[59:57] from that woman here looking at me she's
[59:59] praying for somebody it's her son he's
[1:00:02] an a mental hospital and she's praying
[1:00:04] for him that's right lady you believe
[1:00:06] Jesus Christ will make him well if you
[1:00:08] do raise your hand all right may it be
[1:00:10] so as you have believed have faith in
[1:00:13] God what do you think honey that little
[1:00:14] girl mommy in her arms around you there
[1:00:18] you believe you believe Jesus will heal
[1:00:20] you from that sugar diabetes and let you
[1:00:22] get well you do if you do stand up on
[1:00:25] your feet all right go home and be well
[1:00:27] in the name of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:00:30] there's countless times he says now now
[1:00:32] I'll turn my back so he relates Genesis
[1:00:34] 18 He says now I'm going to turn my back
[1:00:36] to show he was clowning he was proving
[1:00:39] the same God that was there was standing
[1:00:42] there where he was amen and then he also
[1:00:45] would go to Jesus and the woman at the
[1:00:46] well because the same God was in Genesis
[1:00:48] 18 became flesh in Jesus Christ and he
[1:00:50] did exactly the same things amen he says
[1:00:53] as it was the days of lot so shall it be
[1:00:54] when the son of man is revealed so it's
[1:00:57] scripturally Vindicated you understand
[1:00:59] this goes beyond well these people have
[1:01:01] healings these people have healings but
[1:01:03] this is scripturally Vindicated a unique
[1:01:05] Ministry am mean to prove that it was
[1:01:08] God God was standing there backing up
[1:01:10] what he said amen hallelujah and he says
[1:01:14] a few times now if I be a servant of God
[1:01:16] and if I have said the truth now let him
[1:01:19] come forth and prove that it's true amen
[1:01:22] you got to think about this now this
[1:01:23] goes beyond argument reasoning and these
[1:01:25] people say this this person well what
[1:01:27] what was God backing up right amen amen
[1:01:30] because whatever God's backing up I want
[1:01:32] say Lord I want to walk with that amen
[1:01:35] hallelujah amen he was not clowning amen
[1:01:38] and this was to prove that what was
[1:01:40] being said was the mechanics the truth
[1:01:42] of the word but we understand that the
[1:01:44] scripture says that we must worship Him
[1:01:46] in spirit and in
[1:01:48] truth now I just want to throw this in
[1:01:53] here he says this this is in
[1:01:57] um this is in
[1:01:59] reason reasoning
[1:02:01] versus what's
[1:02:03] happened this is in wisdom versus
[1:02:06] Faith but everyone agrees we have to
[1:02:08] Worship in spirit and in truth yeah
[1:02:12] now he says this and Jesus said your
[1:02:16] name is in the palm of my hand remember
[1:02:18] what do you see when you look at
[1:02:20] yourself so how how is it going to be
[1:02:22] forgotten can't be all right now if
[1:02:25] Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith of
[1:02:27] knowing who he was
[1:02:30] yeah amen amen now remember it's who you
[1:02:34] are you got to know who you are not what
[1:02:37] you think your performance should be but
[1:02:39] who you are remember the apostles they
[1:02:42] said to whom shall we go they'll have
[1:02:44] the words of eternal life there was
[1:02:46] something drawing them to his words to
[1:02:48] him amen so it wasn't their performance
[1:02:51] that they were resting upon it was more
[1:02:53] they should have been resting ing upon
[1:02:55] God had called them something had
[1:02:56] anchored in their souls this is the word
[1:02:58] of eternal life you understand don't
[1:03:00] look at your performance amen look at
[1:03:02] what you are amen amen Lilia I mean
[1:03:06] Gabriela can barely run that doesn't
[1:03:09] mean she's not my child you understand
[1:03:11] she's my child because of blood because
[1:03:14] of life that's why she's my child amen
[1:03:17] so as long as there's life there
[1:03:18] hallelujah amen as long as there's life
[1:03:21] there right and if there is that means
[1:03:23] that you're a son of daughter of God you
[1:03:25] hear me now you're a son or daughter of
[1:03:27] God by birth amen and that's all that
[1:03:30] matters if you fall just say Lord
[1:03:32] forgive me try me one more time
[1:03:34] Hallelujah that's all you need to do and
[1:03:35] walk on amen amen this has been burning
[1:03:39] in my bosom friends you got to recognize
[1:03:41] what we have who you are don't just
[1:03:44] count to the devil say oh I'm just a
[1:03:46] useless unworthy thing God's made you
[1:03:48] worthy we're more than conquerors amen
[1:03:52] we have this message I'll come to it at
[1:03:55] the end again we have the only thing
[1:03:57] upon this Earth that can actually cause
[1:03:59] people to live overcoming lives am mean
[1:04:01] we have the power of the Cross we don't
[1:04:03] just talk about Calvary we see Calvary
[1:04:05] am we see what he was doing has achieved
[1:04:08] in US amen hallelujah we see the power
[1:04:10] of the blood yes amen no other church
[1:04:12] has that that's why they compromise with
[1:04:15] s and they just let the church go every
[1:04:17] way you can do whatever you want
[1:04:19] basically it's all Grace Grace enables
[1:04:21] you to live the word amen Grace forgives
[1:04:24] you absolutely and then if and if Grace
[1:04:25] has truly come upon you then your life
[1:04:27] will be different because you recognize
[1:04:29] you've been
[1:04:31] forgiven Allelujah now knowing who he
[1:04:35] was he was a predestinated creature then
[1:04:38] he asked are you
[1:04:40] ready what about the predestinated Bride
[1:04:42] of Jesus Christ now you believe the
[1:04:44] bride is
[1:04:45] predestinated yes the predestinated
[1:04:48] bride of Christ now the church the word
[1:04:51] seed with everything that God promised

[1:05:59] he called he is Justified those he had
[1:06:02] Justified he has already glorified
[1:06:05] predestinated and now in the last days
[1:06:07] with every seed sowed everything in
[1:06:09] order the world in its order the time
[1:06:12] shaped up the church in its order the
[1:06:14] seed the evening lights the signs like
[1:06:16] he said as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:06:19] an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming
[1:06:21] down moving performing the signs that
[1:06:24] did then Malachi 4 promised he would
[1:06:27] send in the last days what he promised
[1:06:29] and we see all that right here amen he
[1:06:33] says where where he says amen amen amen
[1:06:36] do you love him amen hallelujah sure
[1:06:38] right here in the last days a
[1:06:40] predestinated church I'm sure you can

[1:06:47] where they're standing swed with the
[1:06:49] seed the holy spirit in the church he
[1:06:51] says Satan be careful what happened just
[1:06:54] a minute now what happened with
[1:06:55] everything just promised to it even the
[1:06:58] promises of Malachi 4 what did Satan do
[1:07:01] when he met Jesus he flew into him with
[1:07:03] all the ecclesiastical Force he had I
[1:07:07] know the word also flew into him that
[1:07:10] denominational dust that he had they
[1:07:13] throw it right onto him but it didn't
[1:07:15] have any life uh did he ever fly off he
[1:07:19] came off a lot quicker than he flew on
[1:07:22] Amen Satan did why he hit that 100
[1:07:24] billion volt wire there he singed his
[1:07:27] feathers he come off amen he he come off
[1:07:30] of them he come out of him because that
[1:07:33] wire had vault in it remember Satan has
[1:07:35] a had a wire too but no matter how nice
[1:07:38] the CPP of the wire is it if if it
[1:07:41] hasn't got no life in it is is dead she
[1:07:44] won't act the same wire one's got
[1:07:46] energized with the Dynamo the other has
[1:07:49] no connection at all that's right that's
[1:07:52] the connection it'll work in a predes
[1:07:54] ated vessel that's the reason the the
[1:07:56] word will work where it's
[1:07:59] connected
[1:08:01] Glory connected where with the
[1:08:03] denomination no sir that's a dead socket
[1:08:05] having a form of godliness denying the
[1:08:07] power but connected with the word which
[1:08:09] shall never pass away and can produce
[1:08:12] the same power at every time oh where is
[1:08:15] it at he says Oh
[1:08:17] Glory Hallelujah he says Jesus was
[1:08:20] predestinated we talk about this during
[1:08:22] the week it's easy to see in someone
[1:08:24] else's life and it's easy to look at
[1:08:26] someone else's life and say well they
[1:08:28] had to go through this and face this and
[1:08:29] do this and it molded them like this and
[1:08:31] here they are like this you take brother
[1:08:33] braham's life it's easy to see well he
[1:08:35] had to turn down the invitation the
[1:08:37] first time you know when he got in you
[1:08:40] know he got invited you know to go
[1:08:42] preaching but but pressure of the family
[1:08:43] he stayed at home and he lost his wife
[1:08:45] and his baby and all these terrible
[1:08:47] things happened and then and then he how
[1:08:49] he how he buckled to the pressure in
[1:08:50] South Africa and he didn't listen to
[1:08:52] what God Said but he listen to the min
[1:08:53] ministers and all these things we see
[1:08:55] why he had to go through these things
[1:08:57] cuz God was molding a character into him
[1:08:59] that when the sword came down when the
[1:09:01] open word came into his hand he had the
[1:09:03] character to now give it out to the
[1:09:05] people it's easy to see it in his life
[1:09:07] but when you look back at your life and
[1:09:09] we wrestle why did this happen and why
[1:09:11] did this have to happen and why did I
[1:09:12] have to go through this it's the same
[1:09:14] purpose that's right amen none of God's
[1:09:17] work is in vain I don't really see God
[1:09:19] in those things one day you'll
[1:09:21] understand that's right amen amen but
[1:09:23] God was God was allowing things to
[1:09:25] happen cuz God was molding a character
[1:09:27] for a purpose am we just have to have
[1:09:29] peace in that just just just just L at
[1:09:32] his feet and walk on Lord I don't
[1:09:34] understand why that happened to me but
[1:09:36] here it is I'm just going to walk on you
[1:09:38] allowed it to
[1:09:39] happen
[1:09:41] ultimately amen so we need
[1:09:43] now we need the spirit of God you can't
[1:09:47] just remember this message is not just
[1:09:49] mentally agreeing to a doctrine that is
[1:09:51] not how you become a believer you become
[1:09:54] a Believer by the spirit of the word
[1:09:56] coming into you you become a Believer by
[1:09:58] a real birth am not a mental Ascent well
[1:10:01] now I agree he's a prophet it's not that
[1:10:03] sure you have to agree but you don't
[1:10:05] just stay there you've got to meet the
[1:10:06] person of the word Jesus Christ is the
[1:10:09] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:10:11] and if he was a real being back then he
[1:10:13] sure is the same today if he was the
[1:10:15] same God that met Paul is present today
[1:10:17] amen and you got to meet him you got to
[1:10:20] meet him if you don't meet him you've
[1:10:21] missed the whole thing it's really that
[1:10:24] simple now he says and believest thou
[1:10:27] this I'm still on my subject if you say
[1:10:29] where are you going I'm still on my
[1:10:30] subject now the Holy Ghost is good for
[1:10:33] you it'll straighten you out that's what
[1:10:36] the matter with down in these countries
[1:10:39] now and all over the world we got too
[1:10:42] many cold formal churches having a form
[1:10:45] of godliness and denying the power
[1:10:47] thereof what we need today is get a
[1:10:50] little starch out of the church and that
[1:10:52] goes to Pentecost cost to and I'll say
[1:10:54] that goes to the message realm as well
[1:10:56] amen you know it cuz you're
[1:10:59] afraid amen don't be
[1:11:02] afraid you say well I'm not afraid but
[1:11:05] actually if you're not willing to let go
[1:11:08] and let God then you are afraid yes amen
[1:11:11] if you're not willing to let go and let
[1:11:13] God have his way you're scared that is
[1:11:16] afraid Don't Be Afraid amen fear is a is
[1:11:19] is is a great paralysis that tries to
[1:11:22] people up don't be scared
[1:11:24] step out in faith it belongs to you amen
[1:11:26] that's right amen well you say you know
[1:11:29] cuz people they want to they want to
[1:11:32] keep uh you know we're we're refined you
[1:11:35] know they want to keep their themselves
[1:11:38] you know they want to be dignified all
[1:11:40] the time dignified is dead that's right
[1:11:44] amen you got to have life about you
[1:11:46] brother bar Master a question how yeah
[1:11:48] he says and how can I overcome you got
[1:11:50] to keep life about you that's how you
[1:11:52] overcome yep so people are afraid to let
[1:11:54] go now the scripture says in Psalms
[1:11:59] 126:5 they that se and tears shall reap
[1:12:02] in
[1:12:03] Joy amen and then verse six he that
[1:12:05] goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious
[1:12:09] seed shall doubtless come again with
[1:12:11] rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him
[1:12:14] so there's got to be a time you know
[1:12:15] it's not say a sinner's prayer and move
[1:12:17] on you got to have a broken time God
[1:12:20] there has to be a death before life
[1:12:22] comes forth it doesn't matter what god
[1:12:24] well God did that for me years ago but
[1:12:26] now you're in amongst the truth now
[1:12:28] you've got to be born again to this
[1:12:30] present truth yes sir oh but I I'm
[1:12:32] afraid what people will think of me if
[1:12:34] they have anything of God about them
[1:12:35] they'll rejoice and they'll pray for you
[1:12:38] and they'll be happy about itah amen you
[1:12:40] don't become that's why I say you have
[1:12:42] to be willing if you don't want to lose
[1:12:45] control of yourself then God can't work
[1:12:49] it's really that simple if you're not
[1:12:51] willing to lose control you say well I'm
[1:12:53] not I'm not that kind of person you see
[1:12:55] people they sit in church and they just
[1:12:57] they're as rigid as a piece of stone but
[1:13:00] get them out in other environments maybe
[1:13:02] to the rugby or some kind of SP thing
[1:13:04] and they're shouting and they lose their
[1:13:05] voice and they're enthused and and they
[1:13:07] even sometimes got tears coming down
[1:13:08] their cheeks what to try oh I can't
[1:13:10] believe he did that wasn't that amazing
[1:13:12] but I'm not that kind of person I don't
[1:13:15] know friend you got to come under the
[1:13:17] right atmosphere you got to come under
[1:13:19] the right anointing amen amen now
[1:13:24] brother R says in the invisible Union of
[1:13:25] the bride of Christ in 65 remember you
[1:13:28] got to be willing just to let go of
[1:13:30] yourself amen there has to be a real
[1:13:32] time oh am I looking for emotion emotion
[1:13:35] will come amen but but if you try and
[1:13:39] hold back if people try and hold
[1:13:41] themselves together there can't be a
[1:13:43] breaking out and there can't be a real
[1:13:45] birth it's like a chicken if the chicken
[1:13:47] can't or I was use your Eagle if the
[1:13:49] eagle doesn't break through the shell
[1:13:52] then that e Eagle will die in that
[1:13:54] egg amen oh but it's so refined and look
[1:13:57] how nice it is it's just here but then
[1:13:59] when that eagle breaks out flaps its
[1:14:01] rings about amen it looks like a real
[1:14:03] mess yes amen but an eagle's born and it
[1:14:06] can do things that never knew about in
[1:14:08] the shell and it's the same thing
[1:14:10] amongst the Believers amen amen
[1:14:12] hallelujah amen just help me for a
[1:14:14] second now and if a
[1:14:16] woman now this is an invisible Union and
[1:14:18] if a woman won't have a baby for her
[1:14:20] husband she'll take a dog or a cat or
[1:14:22] something she's not to Mother something
[1:14:24] it's their nature uh but to Bear a child
[1:14:27] for a husband raise it to the service of
[1:14:28] God that's entirely all out of her line
[1:14:31] now remember he's talking about natural
[1:14:33] natural woman typing the church now
[1:14:34] that's why he's making these comments
[1:14:36] okay now she'd be so disgraced if she
[1:14:40] did by her sin loving Society of this
[1:14:42] 1965 type of woman or 2016 type of woman
[1:14:46] a true picture of the modern church
[1:14:47] today neither does the modern Church
[1:14:50] want any of any of these here screaming
[1:14:52] shouting tongue speaking acts 238
[1:14:55] youngans around her no she don't want
[1:14:57] any of them whooping and crying and
[1:14:59] screaming amen hallelujah why such a
[1:15:02] child would immediately put her out of
[1:15:04] her denomination they had one like that
[1:15:06] in one of the churches why they throw
[1:15:08] her out right quick why do you let such
[1:15:12] stuff as this go on so so we see she's
[1:15:15] pregnated with something cuz she's
[1:15:16] bringing forth members all the time but
[1:15:19] you don't want any of them screaming
[1:15:21] hollering blabbering p acts 238
[1:15:24] miserable creatures she thinks they are
[1:15:26] it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:15:28] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:15:31] scientific Society Church that she
[1:15:32] belongs to that throw her out at the
[1:15:35] next Council she can't have it so she
[1:15:37] don't want uh so she don't want to be
[1:15:40] pregnated with the word cuz that's the
[1:15:42] only kind that the word can bring forth
[1:15:45] that is the only kind the word can bring
[1:15:47] forth he say but I'm scared to let go
[1:15:49] you have to be willing to let go how can
[1:15:52] you how can you really pray to God if
[1:15:53] you want to in your mind
[1:15:55] pray real prayer is when you let go and
[1:15:58] he prays through you that's real prayer
[1:16:01] but in your mind working out something
[1:16:02] and saying something in your mind that's
[1:16:03] just you talking to the
[1:16:05] ceiling amen so if that is on that case
[1:16:08] you have to be willing to let go oh but
[1:16:11] I don't want people to think less of
[1:16:13] me as I said before if there's any part
[1:16:16] of God in them they will rejoice they
[1:16:19] won't think anything bad of you though
[1:16:21] they'll say praise God that person's
[1:16:22] broken through they've touched heaven
[1:16:24] and Heaven's dealing with them amen and
[1:16:28] because that's what we want and that's
[1:16:30] what we
[1:16:31] need amen because if we stay all stiff
[1:16:33] and starchy and you know oh the music's
[1:16:36] nice but you're all stiff and starchy
[1:16:37] and just keep walking along you're
[1:16:39] leaning on the natural man that's right
[1:16:41] you're never going to overcome the
[1:16:43] strength for your day is in the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost amen amen you're the strength for
[1:16:47] your day is in the word amen amen how
[1:16:51] are things broken in pray pray we have a
[1:16:53] prayer meeting that's why that's why
[1:16:55] Lord willing in a fortn night's time
[1:16:57] we'll be at the church of P base we can
[1:16:58] all come together we need times oh
[1:17:01] that's just a camp it happens virtually
[1:17:03] every Wednesday amen amen that's right
[1:17:05] amen where God comes down and whatever
[1:17:07] measure he wants to come down and people
[1:17:09] have changed amen that's right amen it's
[1:17:12] just what happen and and we need those
[1:17:13] times it's not just sitting and

[1:17:17] worship we need that too amen but you
[1:17:19] need that personal time with God yes sir
[1:17:23] why do we feel better after a Wednesday
[1:17:24] because whatever the devil's trying to
[1:17:26] be putting down our throat God comes
[1:17:27] down and breaks those things and we get
[1:17:29] up again why do we feel better after
[1:17:30] being in church cuz whatever the devil's
[1:17:32] been trying to put down your throat God
[1:17:33] comes and braks we keep walking on but
[1:17:36] if you don't enter into those times then
[1:17:38] the devil just keeps pushing pushing
[1:17:39] pushing down this is a supernatural
[1:17:42] gospel amen this is a supernatural
[1:17:46] walk oh but people will think less of me
[1:17:49] the devil will think less that's the
[1:17:51] devil lying to you he he tries to rob
[1:17:53] you of a blessing he's not afraid to
[1:17:56] come in among you yes you remember the
[1:17:58] first camp we have sister Shantel there

[1:18:01] working right there but then the devil

[1:18:16] discernment brother Bram God is God is
[1:18:19] speaking directly someone through the
[1:18:20] prophet he says oh God th it and then
[1:18:23] and then God gives an extra Grace and he
[1:18:26] calls out their name but they missing it
[1:18:28] all before that why the devil was trying
[1:18:31] to rob them of what God wanted to
[1:18:33] do oh but that was back then that's
[1:18:36] exactly the same why do we have the Mind
[1:18:38] battles why do we have all the things
[1:18:40] coming because the devil's trying to cut
[1:18:42] you off from your source of strength cuz
[1:18:45] if you start on that treadmill and going
[1:18:47] down that way then you're just on his
[1:18:48] hamster wheel and he's got you running
[1:18:51] and then you get stressed and wor and

[1:20:14] it commit it to the Lord amen amen if
[1:20:17] anything it should drive you to your
[1:20:18] knees in prayer amen amen amen
[1:20:24] now as I said here that's the only he
[1:20:26] says here that's the only kind that the
[1:20:28] word can bring forth screaming shouting
[1:20:31] crying acts 238
[1:20:33] youngans amen oh I might speak in
[1:20:36] tongues
[1:20:38] so I'm afraid Don't Be
[1:20:41] Afraid however God leads you to go just
[1:20:43] worship him how he lead
[1:20:45] you don't hold
[1:20:48] back don't hold back you know because
[1:20:51] you must understand brother Abraham says
[1:20:53] now if I can find
[1:20:59] it he says he says that if I
[1:21:04] can oh yes he says this in perfect
[1:21:06] strength and perfect
[1:21:10] weakness he says this
[1:21:13] here now now he's speaking of the
[1:21:16] believer in God okay he says there
[1:21:19] that's it we smother him out we drive
[1:21:22] him away
[1:21:24] from the poorest of us to the richest of
[1:21:26] us from the least to the greatest we
[1:21:29] keep God out of our Lives because of our
[1:21:33] own
[1:21:34] selves I've often said the greatest
[1:21:37] enemy our God is William
[1:21:39] brandham he's the one that gets in God's
[1:21:42] way he's the one that gets lazy he's the
[1:21:45] one who gets to a place sometimes where
[1:21:47] he thinks he can do something about
[1:21:50] it and when he does that shall God right
[1:21:53] out of the picture but when I can get
[1:21:56] rid of that guy when I can get to a
[1:21:59] place that he's out of the way then God
[1:22:02] can come over and do things that William
[1:22:04] brandom knows nothing about you think
[1:22:07] well that's an incredible statement from
[1:22:08] a prophet that had thousands and
[1:22:10] thousands of visitations of God and and
[1:22:11] visions and all the supernatural he says
[1:22:13] if I can get myself out of the way then
[1:22:15] God can do things that I mean that that
[1:22:17] he knows nothing about and so if I'm
[1:22:20] standing here if I can get myself out of
[1:22:22] the way then can do things and say
[1:22:23] things that I know nothing about amen
[1:22:26] well that's just Ministry or or maybe
[1:22:28] music no you've got a role you've got a
[1:22:30] part to play to to create an atmosphere
[1:22:33] to pull down heaven with your faith Amen
[1:22:35] to create an atmosphere of Heaven around
[1:22:37] you that's that's your role amen and if
[1:22:40] you can get yourself out of the way and
[1:22:41] worship then God can come and do things
[1:22:43] that you know nothing about Hallelujah
[1:22:47] is that right amen so we don't want to
[1:22:49] hinder God Don't Be Afraid amen don't
[1:22:52] Don't Be Afraid of Anything amen amen
[1:22:56] Don't Be Afraid now another thing that
[1:22:58] that that that hinders the Lord is
[1:23:01] unforgiveness I know I've probably
[1:23:02] talked about these things before but the
[1:23:04] only way you can truly forgive someone
[1:23:06] is if you're willing to let go of the
[1:23:09] right to ever hold it against them ever
[1:23:12] again that is the only way you can
[1:23:15] forgive if you still want to hold it
[1:23:18] against them you haven't forgiven them
[1:23:19] there may be tears there may be words
[1:23:22] but but if there's still something in in
[1:23:24] you saying no I want to hold this I'm
[1:23:26] going to subconsciously hold this
[1:23:27] against this person you haven't forgiven
[1:23:29] them you have to will to let it go right
[1:23:32] you have to surrender that right to hold
[1:23:34] it against them amen amen so if you have
[1:23:37] not done that then that will hinder your
[1:23:39] walk with God why do people why are
[1:23:42] there broken homes and there's you know
[1:23:44] people go from one person to the other
[1:23:46] person to the other person why cuz
[1:23:48] something happens in the first
[1:23:49] relationship and there's resentment and
[1:23:51] unforgiveness in this baggage and he
[1:23:53] says no I'm better than this I can go
[1:23:54] somewhere else and then the same thing
[1:23:56] happens there cuz they haven't forgiven
[1:23:57] this person and they go to the next
[1:23:59] person next person next person more
[1:24:01] baggage but they haven't forgiven the
[1:24:02] original person and there unfor it's all
[1:24:04] and it's all you got to go back to the
[1:24:05] source of it why because this person
[1:24:08] wasn't willing to let go of the right to
[1:24:10] hold it against them ever
[1:24:12] again amen
[1:24:15] amen you can
[1:24:17] now you can never change the past but
[1:24:21] you can Sur change how the past affect
[1:24:24] your
[1:24:24] future
[1:24:26] okay now this isn't how can I overcome
[1:24:30] see all these things will hinder you
[1:24:32] what does hinder don't let anything
[1:24:34] hinder you remember we're a place in the
[1:24:37] bride there's a natural people but
[1:24:40] there's a supernatural camp that we are
[1:24:43] dwelling in all the time if you really
[1:24:44] know him yeah so don't let your
[1:24:49] past you can only change how the past
[1:24:51] affects your future future and the only
[1:24:53] way you canot let your past affect you
[1:24:55] is to forgive whatever happened and let
[1:24:58] go of the right of holding it against
[1:24:59] whoever it doesn't me you may be the
[1:25:02] biggest victim
[1:25:03] whatever I'm not trying to belittle what
[1:25:06] people have been through but you have to
[1:25:07] let go of the right of holding it
[1:25:10] against
[1:25:11] whoever yeah because you may never see
[1:25:14] that person again in all your days but
[1:25:16] if you do not forgive them then they
[1:25:17] will still affect
[1:25:19] you oh I've moved on but if you haven't
[1:25:22] forgiven them you haven't moved
[1:25:24] on well well how do I forgive them just
[1:25:27] from your heart just let go say Lord I
[1:25:29] forgive them and you just let it go am I
[1:25:31] don't want to be able to hold this
[1:25:33] against them anymore Lord that's right
[1:25:35] he says and how can I overcome I'm glad
[1:25:38] he answers that question he says the
[1:25:40] thing you have to overcome is yourself
[1:25:42] your ideas your things and surrender
[1:25:43] yourself to him he overcame for you he
[1:25:46] knows the way we don't but in Noah's
[1:25:49] time there were eight
[1:25:50] Overcomers and that's what we went
[1:25:53] in they were caught inside now look
[1:25:56] friends I believe they're taping this
[1:25:59] and it's on and it's on tape whatever
[1:26:02] you do who's listening now or who will
[1:26:04] listen Hereafter the hour is very late
[1:26:07] and you do have good intentions but be
[1:26:09] caught inside now don't struggle not him
[1:26:13] that willth or him that runneth but God
[1:26:15] just let God just yield yourself to him
[1:26:20] and walk on with a perfect satisfied
[1:26:24] faith that what God has promised he's
[1:26:26] able to perform thank you Lord amen do
[1:26:30] you believe what God has promised he
[1:26:32] what has he promised us a body change
[1:26:34] amen amen what has he promised us to
[1:26:38] overcome all things to he that
[1:26:40] overcometh you'll sit with me in my
[1:26:41] Throne as I sat with my father in his
[1:26:43] throne that's what he's promised us and
[1:26:46] you have to have confidence now that he
[1:26:48] is able to do it what he promised amen
[1:26:52] amen because if if it's really Anchored
[1:26:54] In Your Heart God's going to God's going
[1:26:56] to change these atoms God's going to
[1:26:58] make me In His Image if it's really
[1:27:00] anchored in here then you can just rest
[1:27:02] and walk
[1:27:04] on Amen not joining one denomination or
[1:27:07] another denomination and running this
[1:27:09] that or the other trying this just yield
[1:27:12] yourself to God and walk with him
[1:27:14] peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep
[1:27:16] walking on with him that's right that's
[1:27:19] what I told our brother that just had
[1:27:23] breakdown okay what what something
[1:27:26] happened to this guy and it caused him
[1:27:27] to have a
[1:27:28] breakdown yeah but this is the advice he
[1:27:31] gave him just yield to him he's here he
[1:27:35] who knowed what you have done and what
[1:27:38] caused your being and doing this way and
[1:27:40] all that he knows all about you and now
[1:27:44] he just told you and now he just told
[1:27:48] you back just what to do now I said only
[1:27:51] thing you have to to
[1:27:53] do is just do it that is forget all
[1:27:56] about the past yeah this is this is a
[1:27:59] good advice just forget all about the
[1:28:01] Past walk live for the future in the
[1:28:05] glory and presence of God that's all you
[1:28:08] have to do forget about the past you say
[1:28:12] but there's things that I cannot change
[1:28:14] there's lots of things we cannot change
[1:28:16] amen but the
[1:28:18] power it's not just blood DP you're
[1:28:21] dripping on a cross
[1:28:23] you understand the power that was in
[1:28:24] that sacrifice and by Believing by
[1:28:27] receiving the truth you have access to
[1:28:29] the full power of the of the blood where
[1:28:32] God remember the only unforgivable sin
[1:28:34] in this in this Bible is
[1:28:36] blaspheming the your know the Holy Ghost
[1:28:39] which is causing the works of God of
[1:28:42] Satan when you knowingly see it amen
[1:28:45] that is not forgiven in this world or
[1:28:46] the next that's the only unforgivable
[1:28:48] sin you understand so everything else
[1:28:51] can be forgiven
[1:28:53] Hallelujah and if you really blashe the
[1:28:55] Holy Ghost you wouldn't be sitting right
[1:28:56] here and even Paul said he blasphemed
[1:28:59] but it didn't change didn't change God's
[1:29:01] idea of
[1:29:02] Paul you understand so that means if we
[1:29:05] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:29:07] to forgive us the scripture tells us
[1:29:10] I've done some Terrible Things Moses
[1:29:12] killed a guy we'll see him one day amen
[1:29:16] David committed
[1:29:17] adultery and had had the husband

[1:30:20] can he not forgive you
[1:30:22] and if God can forgive you can you not

[1:30:46] caused them to be
[1:30:47] scourged you caused them to do that he
[1:30:50] could hold that against you
[1:30:52] amen but he doesn't he just let it go

[1:31:16] saying now if you're really the Christ
[1:31:18] chalice who hit you who's had a crown of
[1:31:20] thorns put on their head who's been
[1:31:22] rejected by the very ones that you came
[1:31:24] to help and deliver and
[1:31:26] save amen and he just he said father you
[1:31:30] know forgive them they don't know what
[1:31:32] they do he was the judge of heavens and
[1:31:34] earth in flesh he could have just
[1:31:37] leveled the whole place he said I could
[1:31:40] call for 12 Legions of angels he
[1:31:42] probably only needed one Angel would
[1:31:44] have just obliterated the whole whole
[1:31:46] bunch of them amen he didn't hold it
[1:31:48] against
[1:31:49] them think about it oh but oh but this
[1:31:53] person did
[1:31:54] this but we want to be like
[1:31:57] Jesus
[1:31:59] amen but but I did this and I did this
[1:32:02] if you confess your sins to him he is
[1:32:05] faithful and just to what forgive
[1:32:08] us read it in first John he's not a man
[1:32:11] that can lie this is either true or it's
[1:32:13] not true to me it's
[1:32:16] true so don't
[1:32:19] let do not let your past affect your
[1:32:23] future amen you got to let it go just
[1:32:26] walk on forget about your past put it
[1:32:29] under the blood walk on amen amen it
[1:32:32] doesn't matter how much the devil tries
[1:32:33] to bring it up just say I'm sorry it's
[1:32:37] in the sea of God's forgetfulness you go
[1:32:39] find it go dig it up and show me go fish
[1:32:43] it out remember there's a sign in that
[1:32:44] sea no fishing and God is enforcing that
[1:32:47] law and no one can fish there hallelujah
[1:32:49] amen so if God can for forgive and
[1:32:52] forget cannot
[1:32:54] we remember he carried the sin of the
[1:32:57] world upon his shoulders that wasn't
[1:32:59] literally he was packing all of your
[1:33:01] everything you did your first birth to
[1:33:03] begin with then all the works of your
[1:33:05] flesh he was carrying it up that hill
[1:33:08] but the joy set before him was you
[1:33:09] redeemed
[1:33:11] amen amen hallelujah he wasn't afraid to
[1:33:14] let
[1:33:15] go he let go and let God he says not my
[1:33:18] will but thy will be done amen amen he
[1:33:21] willing
[1:33:22] y now you say what does this got to do
[1:33:25] with the place of two
[1:33:27] camps very simple we have access
[1:33:31] friends access to a supernatural God the
[1:33:33] creator of heavens and earth that can
[1:33:36] not only fight your battles for you but
[1:33:38] he can undo all the pain and all the
[1:33:40] wounding and all the fear and everything
[1:33:42] all the whatever the devil's tried to
[1:33:44] hold you back with he can he can come
[1:33:47] forth and undo all those things in a
[1:33:48] moment that's right amen amen we're not
[1:33:52] here to do this is not a natural we're
[1:33:54] not a natural group of people you don't
[1:33:56] have just natural families you got to
[1:33:58] understand your life is a supernatural
[1:34:00] revelation of God you're living out
[1:34:02] something God had in his
[1:34:04] mind amen you can tap into this God and
[1:34:07] it's God that's given you access yes
[1:34:09] amen by a New and Living Way amen
[1:34:12] through the veil of his flesh we go to
[1:34:13] the prince of God says in the book of
[1:34:15] Hebrews Lord amen and where the
[1:34:17] denominations tried to Veil them up so
[1:34:19] the people could never live overcoming
[1:34:21] lives God has rent that veil in and says
[1:34:24] here's the Mighty God on Veil before us
[1:34:26] hallelujah hallelujah and now he's
[1:34:28] standing here present among us
[1:34:31] hallelujah amen that you can touch the H
[1:34:32] of his garments he's not he's not up
[1:34:35] some plac that's right amen I'll be with
[1:34:37] you and in you to the end of the world
[1:34:39] hallelujah amen what would it mean if
[1:34:40] say okay I'll go with you I'll go with
[1:34:43] you to work amen cuz I'm going with you
[1:34:47] I'll have breakf forth with you cuz I'm
[1:34:48] with you yes hallelujah amen and then
[1:34:50] and then now you going home well I'm
[1:34:52] going with you so so so I'll be there
[1:34:53] right with you you understand now I'm
[1:34:56] going to go to church well I'll be with
[1:34:57] you when are we going I'll be right
[1:35:00] there amen now I'm at school I'll be
[1:35:02] with you amen cuz you're at school I'll
[1:35:04] be at school you understand that's what
[1:35:06] he
[1:35:07] said oh that's just Pie in the
[1:35:10] Sky no no sir I resent that it is not
[1:35:14] God is so more present than than your
[1:35:16] next breath that's right but if you look
[1:35:18] at just the natural five senses try and
[1:35:20] work things out you're you're forsaking
[1:35:22] your own mercies cuz even Jonah said
[1:35:25] that they that observe lying vanities
[1:35:27] forsake their own mercies and here he
[1:35:29] was in a belly of a whale in the bottom
[1:35:31] of the ocean he says it's just I'm not
[1:35:34] he just called it lying vanity
[1:35:36] Hallelujah well how can that be he's in
[1:35:38] a belly of a whale remember God said it
[1:35:40] was a prepared fish and Jesus said it
[1:35:42] was a whale so God had already pre-made
[1:35:44] the pre-made the fish there was total
[1:35:48] blackness in the belly of a whale what a
[1:35:51] stunk like fish guts and all kinds of
[1:35:53] things seaweed whatever more and he says
[1:35:55] this is lying vanities amen no one has
[1:35:58] ever been in those circumstances I do
[1:35:59] not think otherwise you great work
[1:36:03] stories or something but you see no one
[1:36:05] would have you see no but he just said
[1:36:07] this is lying
[1:36:08] vanities what was happening he was he
[1:36:10] knew it was just more than him he was
[1:36:13] tapping into what we're called to tap
[1:36:15] into amen and he just did it by the
[1:36:17] blood of bulls and goats and the only
[1:36:18] reason he could because it was a prayer
[1:36:20] of a man that said Lord if anyone looks
[1:36:23] towards this Temple and prays you'll
[1:36:25] hear them from heaven then God came down
[1:36:27] and filled the temple and Vindicated yes
[1:36:29] I'll do what you've said Solomon and
[1:36:31] then she said once more I look to your
[1:36:33] temple he didn't have some GPS thing got
[1:36:36] out a smartphone the temples this
[1:36:38] way he looked by faith but God spun him
[1:36:42] round Amen in in a belly of a whale
[1:36:45] Hallelujah that literally happened
[1:36:47] friends that's right it's not just a
[1:36:49] allegory of something no no no it lit he
[1:36:51] was literally in a whales belly and he
[1:36:54] literally said I'll whoever forsakes you
[1:36:56] know whoever observes lying vanities
[1:36:58] they forsake their own
[1:37:00] mercies amen so whenever the enemy comes
[1:37:03] against you whatever more it's lying
[1:37:05] vanities if it's against the word it's
[1:37:07] lying vanities amen if the enemy tries
[1:37:09] to come in and break up your marriage
[1:37:11] you going to say it's lying vanities
[1:37:12] amen amen and you got to stand against
[1:37:14] it you don't look at the situation you
[1:37:16] look at the promise amen amen don't pray
[1:37:19] the problem pray the promise
[1:37:22] cuz if you pray the pray the promise
[1:37:24] remember he's the high priest of our
[1:37:25] profession you'll follow me he's the
[1:37:27] high priest of our profession what
[1:37:29] should I profess this amen amen if your
[1:37:33] children are away with Lord you you you
[1:37:38] we just read there in Isaiah the word
[1:37:41] that I've given you will not depart from
[1:37:42] your mouth or your seeds or your seed
[1:37:45] seeds forever Hallelujah that's right
[1:37:48] Hallelujah and that's just not a just a
[1:37:50] mental repetition it's because there's a
[1:37:52] life in that person and the words they
[1:37:54] speak of the life of God Amen that's
[1:37:57] right is the word of God glory that's
[1:37:59] not too farfetched
[1:38:02] no we are not a natural now
[1:38:08] everything this day is a very perilous
[1:38:10] day says in second Timothy in the last
[1:38:12] days perilous times will come yeah
[1:38:16] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:38:17] God truth Breakers false accusers
[1:38:19] despisers those that are good having a
[1:38:21] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:38:23] thereof what is the power the power is
[1:38:26] the anointing of God not just having the
[1:38:28] written word but it's the very life of
[1:38:30] God to come and defeat the enemy
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:35] amen and he says it's perilous time so
[1:38:38] we live in a perilous
[1:38:39] day so then the Lord has come to show us
[1:38:43] now that our source of strength as the
[1:38:46] as thy days shall be so shall thy
[1:38:48] strength
[1:38:49] be yep
[1:38:54] now what you say so you've got to
[1:38:56] understand this what do you turn
[1:38:59] to oh I have to work this out if we just
[1:39:01] do this and we can do this and we can do
[1:39:04] this don't turn to
[1:39:06] that amen if you want to be Earthly good
[1:39:08] be Heavenly minded amen amen because if
[1:39:11] you get too Earthly Earthly minded
[1:39:14] you're not Heavenly good or you no
[1:39:15] earthly good either yes look what caral
[1:39:18] man has done to this world oh cuz I'm
[1:39:20] going to work this out
[1:39:21] religious people as well I'm just going
[1:39:23] to work this out look what they've done
[1:39:25] we're not to patting ourselves after the
[1:39:27] church world out there we don't depend
[1:39:30] ourselves after some denominational idea
[1:39:32] doesn't matter how good it sounds if
[1:39:34] it's contrary to this we're a separated
[1:39:36] people to
[1:39:37] him amen we're a separated people we're
[1:39:40] a different class of people not because
[1:39:42] we've made ourselves different but God
[1:39:43] has made us different amen
[1:39:47] hallelujah now as I said in the message
[1:39:50] l the power for anyone who believes to
[1:39:53] live above sin and to O to to overcome
[1:39:56] all things yeah you say well what about
[1:39:59] the Bible multitudes read the same Bible
[1:40:03] yeah I trust I I'm not trying to say
[1:40:05] things shocking I want to get you
[1:40:06] thinking multitudes read the Bible the
[1:40:09] same Bible that we do but the truth of
[1:40:13] it is veiled by the Creeds and dogmas
[1:40:16] and traditions of
[1:40:17] man
[1:40:19] yeah REM so you know remember the
[1:40:22] message reveals Jesus Christ in here
[1:40:25] that's right amen so when when we when
[1:40:29] when we read this amen we do not read it
[1:40:34] through denominational understanding
[1:40:36] right it's a it becomes a love letter
[1:40:38] between you and God Amen and you begin
[1:40:41] to understand what he's saying in here
[1:40:43] and you can draw strength from these
[1:40:44] words like no one else can because
[1:40:47] there's a
[1:40:49] relationship understand
[1:40:51] and that's why that's why you know
[1:40:55] because remember the message reveals
[1:40:56] Jesus Christ in this word and that is
[1:40:59] very important because if we understand
[1:41:00] that then we can see now we have
[1:41:03] something very different to the rest of
[1:41:04] the world and we're not trying to be
[1:41:06] elitist or anything you know brother
[1:41:08] Bram says Abraham was an ordinary man
[1:41:11] but then God called him that's what made
[1:41:13] the
[1:41:14] difference and there's nothing special
[1:41:17] about us but God called us amen amen and
[1:41:19] there's people all around the world God
[1:41:21] called and that's what makes them
[1:41:24] special you with
[1:41:26] me you say well I know a lot of horror
[1:41:30] stories you know among the ranks of the
[1:41:32] you know message people that may be so
[1:41:35] but it doesn't take away the realities
[1:41:37] of the transforming power that's in the
[1:41:38] word amen that does not do away with it
[1:41:40] one second hallelujah amen you know just
[1:41:45] look if you just think about it look how
[1:41:47] many people we've seen look how many
[1:41:50] people we' we' seen transformed just
[1:41:51] over these last four years amen who's
[1:41:54] been changed these last four years and
[1:41:57] then even even my wife said growing up
[1:41:59] she only saw what Melanie 20 odd years
[1:42:02] one person four years a whole bunch of
[1:42:04] people and not just people here we are
[1:42:06] people changed at Camp why because the
[1:42:09] power that's God himself backs up the
[1:42:11] word I mean to prove we don't just have
[1:42:13] some religion it's God himself doing it
[1:42:16] Hallelujah and if you can understand
[1:42:18] that you can say well I can tap through
[1:42:20] something
[1:42:21] that the world knows nothing about amen
[1:42:23] amen just as I said quite a few months
[1:42:25] ago when Moses brought them out from the
[1:42:27] Red Sea they went to a you know they
[1:42:30] journeyed to a place where where there
[1:42:32] was water but the waters were
[1:42:34] bitter yeah bitter Waters and many other
[1:42:37] people would have walked that same track
[1:42:40] and would have tried to drink the same
[1:42:41] water so so many other people had the
[1:42:43] same experiences and they were bitter
[1:42:45] experiences but there was a tree that
[1:42:47] was growing by that water but and and
[1:42:50] all the other saw the tree but God gave
[1:42:52] the inspiration to Moses cut down that
[1:42:54] tree and put it in the waters and it
[1:42:56] made it sweet Hallelujah so we have the
[1:42:59] same we all have the same experiences as
[1:43:01] people out in the world and sure they're
[1:43:03] very bitter things but God cut down a
[1:43:05] tree Hallelujah a tree of life was cut
[1:43:08] down on Calvary and can be put into your
[1:43:10] bter experiences and they're not bter
[1:43:12] anymore they're sweet Hallelujah that's
[1:43:15] what God does hallelujah amen our God is
[1:43:19] present friends that's all you need do
[1:43:21] Hallelujah just let go and let God
[1:43:24] hallelujah he can make all things sweet
[1:43:27] Hallelujah they had to walk down that
[1:43:29] road
[1:43:31] hallelujah amen why because Moses was in
[1:43:34] contact with God hallelujah that's why
[1:43:37] he said that tree there would have been
[1:43:38] more trees there but it was that one
[1:43:40] hallelujah hallelujah that same God is
[1:43:43] here you understand well I've had a lot
[1:43:45] of bitter things going on they've
[1:43:46] changed the whole course of my life let
[1:43:49] him come amen Cal into that bitterness
[1:43:52] and it'll become sweet and all you'll
[1:43:54] say is thank you God you cut down the
[1:43:56] tree and you put it into my experience
[1:43:58] and I'm not I'm not better anymore
[1:44:02] Hallelujah
[1:44:04] Hallelujah Lord that's all you need to
[1:44:06] do we have that's why Hallelujah there's
[1:44:09] a there's two camps in this room right
[1:44:11] now Hallelujah there's there's us
[1:44:14] there's God and Satan's being defeated
[1:44:17] amen there's a battle and array right
[1:44:19] now between faith and doubt and every
[1:44:20] mind who do you believe I believe the
[1:44:23] report of the Lord I've seen him do too
[1:44:25] much amen I've seen his transforming
[1:44:27] power too much Hallelujah God's here
[1:44:31] hallelujah praise his mighty name amen
[1:44:34] there's a great secret of the scripture
[1:44:37] brother Ram says it's a keystone of the
[1:44:39] Bible it is the Revelation that God
[1:44:41] never changes and that his ways are as
[1:44:44] unchangeable as he is amen Hebrews 38
[1:44:48] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:44:50] today and forever hallelujah it's a
[1:44:53] great Keystone of the Bible God doesn't
[1:44:55] change how he reveals himself may be
[1:44:58] different as a man or in a burning bush
[1:44:59] or a pillar of fire or whatever it is
[1:45:01] that's the same God revealing himself
[1:45:03] amen so we have the same God is here as
[1:45:06] was back there with Moses or was with
[1:45:08] Elijah or it's with Jeremiah or Ezekiel
[1:45:11] or Daniel or or Peter James and John or
[1:45:14] Paul I mean with brother Bram is right
[1:45:16] here with us I mean there's a man
[1:45:18] standing present at a rapturous church
[1:45:20] out of here hallah there's a man
[1:45:22] standing present there's a bomb and
[1:45:23] Gilead am mean there's healing power in
[1:45:25] this place Hallelujah if you just Reach
[1:45:27] Out And Touch the Lord he can do what he
