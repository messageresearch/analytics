[56:45] had to free some space up I said now you
[56:47] can't open this not enough free space I
[56:49] had to delete some things and I think I
[56:51] should just print things out and stay
[56:52] old school but anyway amen so we're
[56:55] going to read here then we're going to
[56:56] going to read a portion of uh scripture
[56:57] from John 12 as well it speaks of the
[57:00] same same event now when Jesus I just
[57:03] see if I can drive this yep okay now
[57:05] when Jesus was in Bethany in the house
[57:07] of Simon the leper there came unto him a
[57:10] woman having an alabaster box of very
[57:12] precious ointment and poured it on his
[57:14] head as he sat at meat but when his
[57:17] disciples saw it they had indignation
[57:21] saying to what purpose is this waste for
[57:25] this ointment might have been sold for
[57:27] much and given to the poor when Jesus
[57:29] understood it he said unto them why
[57:31] trouble ye the woman for she hath
[57:33] wrought a good work upon me for ye have
[57:37] the poor always with you but me ye have
[57:40] not
[57:41] always for in that she hath poured this
[57:43] ointment on my body she did it for my
[57:46] burial verely verely verely I say unto
[57:49] you wheresoever this gospel shall be
[57:52] preached in the whole world there shall
[57:54] also uh this that this woman hath done
[57:58] be told for a memorial of her amen now
[58:02] now now notice this then notice this
[58:05] word then after that event then one of
[58:07] the 12 called Judas a scarat went unto
[58:10] the chief priests and said unto them
[58:12] what will you give me and and I will
[58:15] deliver him unto you and they covenanted
[58:17] with him for 30 pieces of silver and
[58:20] from that time he sought
[58:22] opportunity to portray him amen let's
[58:25] just go to
[58:26] uh John 12 sorry to keep you standing
[58:31] but um we just got a few more scriptures
[58:33] to
[58:35] read amen John chapter 12 is everyone
[58:38] everyone there everyone happy today amen
[58:41] praise the Lord we're in the prin of our
[58:43] of our King amen we can just let the
[58:45] pressure off and just enjoy his presence
[58:47] and love him and amen John 12:1 then
[58:51] Jesus six days before the Passover came
[58:54] to Bethany where Lazarus uh was which
[58:57] had been dead whom he raised from the
[58:59] dead uh there they made him a supper and
[59:01] Martha served but Lazarus was one of
[59:03] them that sat at the table with him then
[59:06] took Mary a pound of ointment of of
[59:08] Spike nard very costly and anointed the
[59:11] feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with
[59:13] her hair and the house was filled with
[59:15] the odor of the
[59:17] ointment then saith one of his disciples
[59:19] Judas a scarat Simon's son which should
[59:21] betray him why was not this ointment
[59:24] sold for 300 p and given to the poor
[59:27] this he said not that he cared for the
[59:29] poor but because he was a thief and had
[59:31] the bag and bear that which uh was put
[59:36] therein then said Jesus let her alone
[59:38] against the day of my bearing hath she
[59:40] kept this for the poor always have uh ye
[59:44] have with you but me ye have not always
[59:47] amen so any want to have a need this
[59:49] morning you want to be remembered in
[59:50] prayer I just want to slip your hand up
[59:51] to the Lord gracious father you see the

[1:01:12] to thank you we can worship you in
[1:01:14] spirit and in truth so Lord we just
[1:01:16] commit the service into your hands in
[1:01:17] the name of Jesus Christ we ask Lord
[1:01:20] amen amen God bless you friends you may
[1:01:22] have your seats this morning so I want
[1:01:24] to um I want to talk about now I was
[1:01:27] kind of thinking about what I could um
[1:01:31] call this today um and I really was you
[1:01:36] because I I want to I want to uh
[1:01:39] contrast the heart of of Peter and Judas
[1:01:43] and it can be very you know easy I was
[1:01:45] thinking maybe just call it being
[1:01:46] corrected by the word but then the
[1:01:48] legalist would say amen for all the
[1:01:49] wrong reasons so I just want to speak on
[1:01:52] be a Peter never be a Judas now we have
[1:01:55] you know and then also I trust that no
[1:01:57] one brought their pitch folks
[1:01:58] today right all right bring the right
[1:02:01] tools here amen and that goes for
[1:02:04] YouTube land as well now I just want to
[1:02:06] make a few background comments before we
[1:02:08] go into what we've just read brother
[1:02:10] brandham says here um just like the word
[1:02:13] predestinate he says it's a bad word I
[1:02:15] used to um I used it a few minutes ago
[1:02:17] and I caught myself cuz I felt the
[1:02:19] spirit moved back many people don't
[1:02:21] believe in predestination predestination
[1:02:23] is a bad word it's really for knowledge
[1:02:26] God knows before who will and who won't
[1:02:29] so therefore he can predestinate by his
[1:02:31] for knowledge that's the reason he knows
[1:02:34] who will and who won't see he's not
[1:02:36] willing that any should perish but he
[1:02:38] knows who will perish if he wasn't I
[1:02:41] mean if he wasn't then he wasn't God he
[1:02:43] has to be omnipotent just the same as
[1:02:45] omnipresent see omniscient omnipresent
[1:02:48] omnipotent infinite he's infinite if he
[1:02:50] isn't he isn't God for he knows all
[1:02:53] things therefore he can tell the end
[1:02:54] from the beginning because he is the
[1:02:56] word so the Lord he's not willing that
[1:02:59] any should perish but he knows who will
[1:03:01] you say well how does that work God made
[1:03:03] man in such a way he doesn't go beyond
[1:03:05] our free moral agency he does not force
[1:03:07] us to receive him right he doesn't
[1:03:10] pressure anyone he doesn't he will never
[1:03:12] override anyone's free moral agency that
[1:03:14] to make them become a Believer we have
[1:03:16] to do that by our own choice but because
[1:03:19] God is God he can look through the
[1:03:21] streams of time and he can see who will
[1:03:23] receive him and who will not remember
[1:03:25] God is Not s back after he said let
[1:03:26] there be sun moon and stars and then
[1:03:28] he's watching things unfold saying I
[1:03:30] wonder if this will happen I wonder if
[1:03:31] that'll happen he knows what's going to
[1:03:32] happen right many times we because we
[1:03:35] can't see into the future we see well
[1:03:36] how's things going to work out he knows
[1:03:38] how it will work out but you see he so
[1:03:41] he knows who will receive him by his
[1:03:43] full knowledge and but he knows also
[1:03:46] those who won't but he's not willing
[1:03:48] that any should perish he he fed me so I
[1:03:51] need you to put this in mind because God
[1:03:52] doesn't make us Christians he knows we
[1:03:55] will choose him right so therefore he
[1:03:57] could put a seat of predestination there
[1:03:59] but he doesn't Force us we have to make
[1:04:01] our own choice now Judas had to make a
[1:04:04] choice Peter had to make a choice and it
[1:04:06] was out of what was in their heart they
[1:04:08] made that
[1:04:09] choice
[1:04:11] now so God does not override our free
[1:04:14] moral agency now if we could just
[1:04:16] go um we
[1:04:18] read you know we read there of the
[1:04:21] account of of of Mary coming in and an
[1:04:25] anointing Jesus for for his for his
[1:04:28] burial
[1:04:30] now if we could go back to you know
[1:04:33] those two accounts you know are the
[1:04:35] accounts of Jesus being anointed in the
[1:04:37] house of Simon the leper there in
[1:04:39] Bethany now if we were there if we could
[1:04:41] be transported back to that moment you
[1:04:43] know imagine if we were I think I was
[1:04:44] talking to brother Armand about this on
[1:04:46] Wednesday I'm not sure but imagine if we
[1:04:48] were if we lived in the um in the in the
[1:04:52] village of Bethany or the city whatever
[1:04:54] it was and we knew Lazarus we knew Mary
[1:04:56] we knew Martha and no doubt we had seen
[1:04:59] Jesus before because he had come through
[1:05:01] Bethany before no doubt we had seen him
[1:05:03] preach we'd seen him you heal the sick
[1:05:05] and so on but then we hear Lazarus is
[1:05:07] sick maybe he's he's our next door
[1:05:09] neighbor and so maybe we would go and
[1:05:11] help and see how he is maybe we' take
[1:05:13] him meals and you know offer words of
[1:05:15] encouragement and you know just just
[1:05:17] just ask Mary Martha can we do anything
[1:05:19] to help you know alleviate the burden
[1:05:21] and they would say no doubt you know
[1:05:23] don't worry Jesus is on his way but then
[1:05:26] it seems like Jesus makes a delay in his
[1:05:28] coming and then finally Lazarus is is
[1:05:30] you know gets sicker and sicker then and
[1:05:32] then maybe in the middle of the night
[1:05:34] you hear a great Cry of Anguish come
[1:05:35] from the house Lazarus is dead and then
[1:05:38] you know we would go and comfort them
[1:05:40] and try and help with the burial and
[1:05:42] then we would we would go maybe and you
[1:05:44] know you know help with the burial we'd
[1:05:46] see lazarus's body maybe carried by his
[1:05:48] own brokenhearted sisters carried into
[1:05:50] the tomb and the stone would be rolled
[1:05:52] over the tomb and that was the end of it
[1:05:56] but then we know Jesus is never late and
[1:05:59] and you know and 4 days he may seem late
[1:06:01] on our timing but his timing is always
[1:06:03] on time amen so you know we would be
[1:06:05] there and we'd support them the best we
[1:06:07] can then we hear Jesus is on his way and
[1:06:09] then finally Jesus Jesus would come and
[1:06:13] you know he would come to town and maybe
[1:06:14] we would follow follow him and you know
[1:06:16] follow him and the disciples to the tomb
[1:06:18] to see what you know to see what would
[1:06:20] happen you know we think maybe he's just
[1:06:22] gone to you know he raised you know he
[1:06:24] did many mighty things but he couldn't
[1:06:26] this case was too hard there's no case
[1:06:28] too hard amen there's no case too hard
[1:06:30] for you know for our Lord so so he would
[1:06:32] go to the tomb we think maybe he'll just
[1:06:34] maybe you know give a give a tribute to
[1:06:37] his friend and you know but he would
[1:06:38] stand there and he would he would pray
[1:06:40] out loud and say father I thank you that
[1:06:44] I wasn't here when Lazarus was sick
[1:06:45] basically I'm just I'm just ad liing but
[1:06:47] you can go read it he says father I
[1:06:49] thank you you hear my prayers and I'm
[1:06:51] just here to basically say that that
[1:06:53] that that the people would know that you
[1:06:54] have sent me and you hear what I call
[1:06:56] for and then he would tell Mary and
[1:06:58] Martha roll the stone away and they
[1:07:00] would say but Lord he stinketh it's 4
[1:07:02] days he said roll it away and they' roll
[1:07:04] it away and then he would say those
[1:07:06] words Lazarus come forth and then a man
[1:07:09] who was rotten four days in the grave
[1:07:11] came forth healthy well and
[1:07:14] strong what an incredible moment that
[1:07:16] would be maybe we weren't at the tomb
[1:07:18] but the next morning we see Lazarus
[1:07:19] maybe you know go for a walk to the
[1:07:21] corner Dairy and say what H but you were
[1:07:24] dead I was dead but now I'm alive why
[1:07:26] cuz Jesus is in town Hallelujah you know
[1:07:29] and then maybe we could as you know as
[1:07:30] we're maybe joining the procession there
[1:07:32] maybe we would we would Fallen among the
[1:07:34] disciples and we'd begin to talk to them
[1:07:36] cuz you know we' just seen something
[1:07:38] that never happened before never
[1:07:40] happened before in the history of the
[1:07:41] world and Man four days in the grave you
[1:07:43] know by then the body's already rotting
[1:07:46] away but he came healthy strong and well
[1:07:48] out of the Grave alive and maybe we
[1:07:50] would begin to talk to them and you know
[1:07:52] we would maybe maybe we would be walking
[1:07:55] with Judas and Peter and as we walked
[1:07:58] with them they would they would cuz we
[1:08:00] we've only seen a little bit of Jesus's
[1:08:01] Ministry but they've been walking with
[1:08:02] him the whole time and you know no doubt
[1:08:05] they would you know begin to testify of
[1:08:07] you know Legion being delivered
[1:08:10] Hallelujah thousand Devils out of him
[1:08:12] and you know seeing the swine run into
[1:08:14] the sea and all those things or maybe
[1:08:16] maybe coming to the woman at the well
[1:08:18] and you know Jesus was already speaking
[1:08:19] to her and you know we didn't really
[1:08:21] know what was going on there cuz she's a
[1:08:23] Samaritan and he's a Jew but they're
[1:08:24] talking and but but she she drops her
[1:08:27] water pot runs into the city says come
[1:08:28] see a man that told me all I ever did is
[1:08:31] this not the very Messiah and you know
[1:08:33] maybe or maybe they would talk about you
[1:08:35] know we were we were crossing the Sea of
[1:08:37] Galilee and a big storm was whooping up
[1:08:39] and you know we thought we could handle
[1:08:41] it being Sailors Sailors but then we
[1:08:42] realized we can't handle the storm it
[1:08:44] got too big and we woke up the master
[1:08:46] and you know we and then he just stand
[1:08:48] up and say peace be still and a WI a did
[1:08:50] come hallelujah or maybe you know they
[1:08:53] would relate Jesus walking on the water
[1:08:55] and Peter would say I walked on the
[1:08:56] water too hallelujah or Jesus healing
[1:08:59] the lepers or Jesus you know turning the
[1:09:02] water into wine or Jesus raising D's
[1:09:04] daughter Jesus healing the blind the
[1:09:06] lame am mean feeding the thousands they
[1:09:09] would just go testimony after testimony
[1:09:11] after testimony and then it would become
[1:09:13] a bit more personal because they could
[1:09:15] no doubt talk about how in Matthew
[1:09:17] chapter 10 they were commissioned by the
[1:09:19] Lord to go and preach the gospel yeah
[1:09:21] and they are anointed to preach the
[1:09:22] gospel cast out Devils raised the Dead
[1:09:25] heal the sick and they would and they
[1:09:27] would begin to testify that the
[1:09:28] anointing they felt around him they felt
[1:09:30] it come on them and they went out two by
[1:09:33] two and they would you know and they'
[1:09:35] give their own testimony of God living
[1:09:36] in their
[1:09:38] lives or they would testify of going
[1:09:40] into the synagogue and Jesus would find
[1:09:42] Isaiah the scripture that was written
[1:09:44] about him about the spirit of laws upon
[1:09:46] me to bind up the Brokenhearted to to
[1:09:48] set at cab set at C set free the
[1:09:52] prisoners and you know those things you
[1:09:53] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:09:55] and he'd say this day the scriptures
[1:09:57] fulfilled you know so they could they
[1:09:59] could testify of that they could also
[1:10:01] testify of hearing many Mysteries that
[1:10:03] were hidden from the foundation of the
[1:10:05] world you know Jesus would say to them
[1:10:07] in Matthew 13 the things the reason I
[1:10:10] speak to them in Parables and you
[1:10:12] plainly is because it's not know it's
[1:10:14] not for them to know but I'm going to
[1:10:15] tell you Mysteries so Judas knew the
[1:10:17] mysteries of the book he was part of the
[1:10:20] ministry he knew what it was like to be
[1:10:22] anointed he knew it was like to preach
[1:10:24] under inspiration he knew it was like to
[1:10:26] pray for people and they'd get well and
[1:10:28] he knew the mysteries of the word but
[1:10:30] yet even in that
[1:10:33] state there was something in his life
[1:10:35] that he was holding on to that he valued
[1:10:38] more highly above following and being
[1:10:40] corrected by the word of
[1:10:42] God and now after all that we're in
[1:10:45] Simon's house and we're sitting there
[1:10:49] and Here Comes Mary with this expensive
[1:10:52] ointment we read that it was very costly
[1:10:56] amen and she came and anointed the feet
[1:10:58] of Jesus wiped her his feet with her
[1:11:00] hair and the house was filled with the
[1:11:03] odor of the ointment now she was
[1:11:06] inspired to do this the disciples didn't
[1:11:09] anoint her sorry the the disciples
[1:11:12] didn't anoint him for his burial she did
[1:11:15] but she didn't even understand what she
[1:11:16] was really
[1:11:17] doing but she was inspired to anoint the
[1:11:20] word for what it was about to accomplish
[1:11:24] even though she was not aware of the
[1:11:27] significance of what she was doing are
[1:11:29] you all following me I'm going to if we
[1:11:31] go slow let's just go for a walk okay
[1:11:33] you know but but I want this to sink in
[1:11:36] I pray now you say well how do you
[1:11:39] anoint the word well if we look back in
[1:11:40] the Old Testament they would take a king
[1:11:42] and they would anoint a king signifying
[1:11:45] he is now the king over the nation right
[1:11:47] and everyone we may not a physically
[1:11:49] poured the oil on his head but being
[1:11:51] there and being behind that King we're
[1:11:52] saying we anoint you King over this
[1:11:54] nation
[1:11:55] and Asing over this na you are my king
[1:11:58] right so to anoint the word amen we are
[1:12:00] actually signifying this word this Lord
[1:12:02] Jesus is our kingen hallelujah amen
[1:12:06] that's how we anoint the word for our
[1:12:08] day now and then also amen when the word
[1:12:11] is given we say Amen to the word you're
[1:12:14] actually taking ownership of that word
[1:12:15] by saying amen so be it or hallelujah
[1:12:18] amen so that's anointing the word see we
[1:12:20] need to you know the bride needs to
[1:12:22] anoint the word for what it's going to
[1:12:23] accomplish what's it going to accomplish
[1:12:25] a
[1:12:26] Rapture Hallelujah he doesn't need to go
[1:12:28] to Calvary he's already done that now
[1:12:30] he's come to take his bride away amen so
[1:12:32] this is the part of the word that's that
[1:12:35] we're in the process of fulfilling amen
[1:12:37] cuz we understand and know the Rapture
[1:12:39] cycle is already taking place
[1:12:42] hallelujah amen you see but her you know
[1:12:45] we read there that the odor of that you
[1:12:47] know when she broke that Alabaster Box
[1:12:49] and poured it on his feet that her you
[1:12:51] know that the smell of that filled the
[1:12:54] house hallah so her worship filled the
[1:12:56] house amen signifying you know that's
[1:12:59] not done in a corner but she wasn't
[1:13:01] worried what are these people going to
[1:13:02] think about it she just went and
[1:13:03] anointed the word hallelujah now it's
[1:13:07] it's amazing because even Jesus did not
[1:13:11] understand
[1:13:13] initially what she was doing now I have
[1:13:16] this here if we go back having a bit of
[1:13:20] a Sunday school lesson today welcome to
[1:13:21] Sunday school or welcome to Super youth
[1:13:24] or whatever you want to call it
[1:13:28] now it says
[1:13:31] here when Jesus understood
[1:13:34] it so he didn't initially understand
[1:13:36] what was going on but then then he
[1:13:39] understood it he fed me it says when he
[1:13:42] understood it he said unto them why
[1:13:44] trouble ye the woman for she has wrought
[1:13:46] a good work upon me for you have the
[1:13:48] poor with you always but me ye have not
[1:13:52] always for in that she has poured this
[1:13:54] ointment on my body she did it for my
[1:13:57] burial so now I want you to notice the
[1:14:00] disciples aren't
[1:14:01] rejoicing here they are here's here's
[1:14:03] someone in their midst who has actually
[1:14:05] caught a revelation this is where he's
[1:14:07] going he had told them he's going to be
[1:14:10] crucified he's going to rais on the
[1:14:11] third day but here she was actually she
[1:14:13] had a revelation this is what's going on
[1:14:16] and then see Jesus understood it says
[1:14:19] then Jesus understood it
[1:14:24] now if I can find where I was so I want
[1:14:26] to I want to try
[1:14:28] and stay with the stay with my so it
[1:14:31] says then Jesus understood
[1:14:36] it now see Jesus even Jesus didn't
[1:14:40] understand it at first but it was after
[1:14:43] the criticism of her worship then
[1:14:45] Clarity came from the master himself see
[1:14:48] they were filled with they were filled
[1:14:49] with indignation what a bunch of waste
[1:14:52] what a bunch of what is this person what
[1:14:54] is she doing this is breaking all the
[1:14:56] cood this is breaking all the way you
[1:14:58] know this is wrong you know they were
[1:15:00] angry they were upset about what was
[1:15:01] going on they were criticizing her for
[1:15:04] what she was doing but notice after
[1:15:07] after the criticism
[1:15:10] came where are we see they had
[1:15:13] indignation saying what purpose is this
[1:15:15] waste what a waste of a song what a
[1:15:17] waste of why is this person doing this
[1:15:18] why are they praising God like this why
[1:15:20] are they running around the church why
[1:15:21] are they being like this why are they
[1:15:23] saying hallelujah what a waste
[1:15:25] effort so criticism came but then after
[1:15:29] the criticism came
[1:15:30] Clarity amen so criticism should bring
[1:15:34] Clarity
[1:15:36] Hallelujah see Clarity see criticism is
[1:15:39] its intent is to drag someone down amen
[1:15:43] we know New Zealand has a has a tall
[1:15:45] poppy syndrome spirit in this country
[1:15:48] basically you everyone wants to cut
[1:15:50] everyone down to be the same much like a
[1:15:52] bunch of Moine grass right but so so
[1:15:56] that's how it is so but criticisms
[1:15:58] intent is to drag you down to stop
[1:16:01] letting God live in your life see what
[1:16:04] if people you know people people get
[1:16:05] inspired they shout they dance they
[1:16:07] Rejoice under the anointing then someone
[1:16:09] comes along say oh this person yeah you
[1:16:11] did that again well it's it's trying to
[1:16:14] drag that person down to withdraw that
[1:16:16] God can't manifest himself in that way
[1:16:19] or or singing or you know playing an
[1:16:21] instrument whatever it might be but all
[1:16:23] criticism should do
[1:16:25] is Drive the believer closer to God and
[1:16:28] it brings Clarity that you're right on
[1:16:31] track remember Jesus brought Clarity no
[1:16:33] no this is not a way she did it for my
[1:16:34] burial she's done a good work in me and
[1:16:37] it's such a good work that wherever the
[1:16:38] gospel is preached it's going to be it's
[1:16:40] going to be spoken as a memorial of of
[1:16:42] what she did Hallelujah so you know see
[1:16:46] like like it's first you know see what
[1:16:50] does criticism do it drives us towards
[1:16:53] where the Lord is it drives us into his
[1:16:55] presence right see at first people can
[1:16:57] just come along to church because of the
[1:16:59] food or the people or because their
[1:17:01] parents come but if that person is
[1:17:03] sincere when someone makes fun of them
[1:17:06] or attacks them then they begin to seek
[1:17:08] the Lord and ask him Lord is this the
[1:17:11] right way and he will begin to make it
[1:17:13] more real in the scripture right he
[1:17:16] confirms his word amen it's like you
[1:17:18] know we are baptized according to the
[1:17:20] scripture we know we know we're in the
[1:17:22] end times according to the scripture we
[1:17:25] know we're in the Rapture cycle
[1:17:26] according to the scripture Jesus brings
[1:17:28] Clarity amen hallelujah see it's a
[1:17:31] classic example water baptism in the
[1:17:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ now I
[1:17:34] don't have it up here but if you read
[1:17:36] Matthew 28 you know Jesus didn't say now
[1:17:38] speak these words over someone when you
[1:17:41] immerse them in water I baptize you in
[1:17:43] the name of the Father the Son and the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost no he said baptize in the
[1:17:46] name he didn't say repeat these words he
[1:17:49] said baptize them in the name and the
[1:17:50] name is the Lord Jesus Christ right so
[1:17:53] someone can come and criticize say your
[1:17:54] baptism what are you going on about this
[1:17:56] baptism there's nothing to it you know
[1:17:57] it doesn't matter how it is well Jesus
[1:17:59] said baptize in the name what it drives
[1:18:01] that criticism drives you into the
[1:18:04] scripture and it brings Clarity amen
[1:18:07] hallelujah so that's how that's how
[1:18:09] criticism should bring bring bring
[1:18:11] Clarity from the master himself now
[1:18:13] Jesus would say um brother brah would
[1:18:16] saying God's word calls for total
[1:18:17] separation from unbelief I know they
[1:18:19] stand criticism but if we wasn't
[1:18:22] criticized then there'd be something
[1:18:24] wrong the world always knows its own but
[1:18:27] as I've said that remember criticism on
[1:18:29] the account of the word of God Is On The
[1:18:31] Growing Pains of his
[1:18:33] grace
[1:18:35] hallelujah amen it shows that you have
[1:18:37] separated yourself to be a Christian to
[1:18:39] act like one to live like one to obey
[1:18:41] every commandment of God it's a Nazarite
[1:18:43] vow to separate to call h a call from
[1:18:46] God that separates you from the things
[1:18:48] of the world so it's only Growing Pains
[1:18:50] of his grace but it brings Clarity amen
[1:18:54] hallelujah
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] now I want you to notice
[1:19:02] this wait am I on the
[1:19:05] right
[1:19:08] technology forgive
[1:19:10] me you're staying with me so
[1:19:13] far see they all said at such a
[1:19:17] waste and then after this after no the
[1:19:20] Lord said no no no no don't think that
[1:19:22] way this is actually a good thing she's
[1:19:24] done the word brought
[1:19:26] correction and this correction triggered
[1:19:29] Judas to start the cycle of the Betrayal
[1:19:33] all right all
[1:19:35] right
[1:19:37] amen now in
[1:19:41] indignation if I have it here I what see
[1:19:44] they they had
[1:19:46] indignation now
[1:19:48] indignation from the Greek it means to
[1:19:50] be greatly Afflicted in indignant to be
[1:19:55] much sure
[1:19:56] displeased to be moved with indignation
[1:19:59] so they just weren't a little bit
[1:20:00] annoyed they were greatly they were they
[1:20:03] were much sore displeased they were
[1:20:05] upset by what she was doing they weren't
[1:20:08] happy about it they weren't excited they
[1:20:10] were they were very upset now the
[1:20:12] Cambridge Dictionary says it it means
[1:20:15] anger about a situation that you think
[1:20:17] is wrong or not fair that's wrong she
[1:20:20] did that what a waste of money what a
[1:20:21] waste of you know maybe if Judas if he
[1:20:26] had seen her carrying the ointment
[1:20:28] before she Anointed The Lord Jesus he
[1:20:31] might have been starting to think how
[1:20:33] can I get hold of this that I can profit
[1:20:35] from it remember we read he's a thief so
[1:20:38] he has and now I've got it here but you
[1:20:41] know he he had a side hustle they call
[1:20:43] it today they had a side hustle going on
[1:20:46] while he was being a disciple and that
[1:20:49] side hustle was more important to him
[1:20:52] than following the word this is Judas
[1:20:54] this is is the heart of Judas now he was
[1:20:56] more interested in making money out of
[1:20:58] the thing and robbing people than
[1:21:01] actually following the word because if
[1:21:03] we want to follow the word you know if
[1:21:05] this word says no you're wrong on a
[1:21:06] certain thing I say forgive me Lord
[1:21:08] change my heart to match your word right
[1:21:10] that you know that's how we should be it
[1:21:12] shouldn't be you know we shouldn't get
[1:21:13] angry like Judas remember Judas had a
[1:21:15] choice yeah the Lord knew he would
[1:21:18] betray him but he had a choice he had to
[1:21:20] agree with that betrayal he had to agree
[1:21:23] with that thought for the devil to take
[1:21:25] him over and actually do what he
[1:21:28] did so he was much displeased because
[1:21:32] Mary he was so sore displeased that Mary
[1:21:35] anointed the word for what he was going
[1:21:36] to do next because it was hindering what
[1:21:39] he wanted to do while he was in the
[1:21:40] church he wanted to make
[1:21:43] money that resentment I'll call it
[1:21:46] spread to the rest of the disciples it's
[1:21:49] got to start somewhere you know an
[1:21:51] attitude or you know something among
[1:21:52] people there's a starting point
[1:21:55] amen there's an ending point too and
[1:21:57] that ending point is Deliverance by the
[1:21:58] Holy Ghost right but there's always got
[1:22:00] to be a starting point amen so so that
[1:22:03] resentment spread to the rest of the
[1:22:05] disciples so we must be very careful how
[1:22:08] we talk about anointed worship and
[1:22:10] anointed life anointed singing preaching
[1:22:12] praying and
[1:22:14] living the devil wants the gift we all
[1:22:18] have a gift right he wants the gift in
[1:22:20] our lives to stop operating if it's the
[1:22:22] gift of singing preaching praying saying
[1:22:24] amen being a living witness being an
[1:22:27] encouragement being a Sunday school
[1:22:28] teacher being a technician being a
[1:22:30] musician being a deacon being a trusty
[1:22:33] I'm just trying to cover everything
[1:22:34] there is in the body being a help being
[1:22:35] a government whatever it is he does not
[1:22:37] want that to
[1:22:39] operate amen so so how does he start how
[1:22:42] does he attempt to stop things like that
[1:22:44] happening it's by giving someone an
[1:22:46] attitude against that
[1:22:48] personen that's how it begins that's why
[1:22:51] you should never cut one another down
[1:22:53] never criticize one another we're here
[1:22:55] to build one another up we're going to
[1:22:57] take a Rapture together we're going to
[1:22:58] make it Hallelujah so we should
[1:23:00] encourage one another you can do it
[1:23:02] brother you can do it sister let's get
[1:23:03] across the line amen if God is for us
[1:23:06] who can be against us no one that's
[1:23:08] right so let's press hey if someone if
[1:23:10] God is for someone why would I want to
[1:23:12] come against that person I'd be the most
[1:23:14] fullest stupid blind person in the world
[1:23:16] for me to come against someone of God is
[1:23:18] for them because I'm not just coming
[1:23:20] against them I'm coming against God and
[1:23:23] who can beat him
[1:23:25] come nobody you know it used to be When
[1:23:28] We Were Young we'd say my daddy's bigger
[1:23:29] than your daddy my daddy will beat your
[1:23:31] daddy up you know my uncle's bigger than
[1:23:33] you you know my daddy is the biggest
[1:23:35] daddy Hallelujah he's already conquered
[1:23:38] hell death in the grave I believe that
[1:23:41] hallelujah
[1:23:42] amen so it
[1:23:44] started it starts by an attitude and how
[1:23:48] does that attitude spread it begins by
[1:23:50] snide offhand comments about someone
[1:23:53] that's how see he he had his side hustle
[1:23:55] going on who knows what a side hustle is
[1:23:58] yep so you have your main job that you
[1:23:59] do something on the side to make a bit
[1:24:00] of money that's a side hustle this is
[1:24:02] what he was doing he had a side hustle
[1:24:04] going on and that is what triggered him
[1:24:06] to make the choice of betraying Jesus
[1:24:09] was that when the word actually got in
[1:24:11] the way of what he really wanted to do
[1:24:13] which was to make money he had a choice
[1:24:15] is he going to keep being a thief or is
[1:24:17] he going to follow the
[1:24:18] word and he decided on silver and
[1:24:22] gold he decided on the wrong
[1:24:28] thing see the by Jesus saying no he did
[1:24:31] a good thing Judas begin to resent it
[1:24:35] because of what was in his heart now we
[1:24:37] read the uh we read the two accounts
[1:24:40] here in in Matthew and John CU Matthew
[1:24:43] just being under the lion anointing
[1:24:45] saying all the disciples had
[1:24:47] ignation and you know they said what a
[1:24:49] bunch of waste but then John under the
[1:24:51] eagle anointing could look deeper than
[1:24:53] what what was in spired to Matthew and
[1:24:55] he could look into the heart of Judas
[1:24:58] and he said the reason Judas said that
[1:24:59] is because he was a thief and didn't
[1:25:01] even care about the poor it's amazing
[1:25:04] God knows everything he looks beyond our
[1:25:07] maybe how we emphasize a certain thing
[1:25:09] to get a certain thing our our motive
[1:25:11] and you know our objective God looks
[1:25:13] right through it we can put on a front
[1:25:15] and say one thing but really meaning
[1:25:17] another thing to twist a person this way
[1:25:18] and God just looks all through that
[1:25:20] thing you know so we shouldn't play
[1:25:23] games with people's emotions play games
[1:25:25] with people's lives and no we just point
[1:25:27] them to the scripture and cage them
[1:25:29] along the way amen
[1:25:32] hallelujah now I'm just I'm just
[1:25:35] surmising or presuming but no doubt
[1:25:38] because Jesus I mean sorry Judas was a
[1:25:41] thief he was a thief before he was
[1:25:44] called by the Lord to be a disciple it
[1:25:45] was already in him when he was called
[1:25:47] you know we come with a lot of baggage
[1:25:50] we all come with a lot of baggage we all
[1:25:51] come with things but we're not meant to
[1:25:53] keep those things amen and that spirit
[1:25:55] in his life was really the thing that
[1:25:57] allowed the devil to open the door and
[1:25:59] him to use him to betray the
[1:26:01] Lord amen now if you allow me to have
[1:26:04] that kind of Liberty yes sir you'd say
[1:26:07] well this was all before
[1:26:10] Pentecost well Judas showed his colors
[1:26:12] before he went to Pentecost if he went
[1:26:15] to Pentecost he would have been a
[1:26:16] changed man I believe he would have been
[1:26:19] accepted because Jesus said father
[1:26:21] forgive them you know they don't know
[1:26:23] what they do and Paul would say if they
[1:26:25] really knew he was the Messiah they
[1:26:27] would never have betrayed the Prince of
[1:26:28] Life they would never have done it if he
[1:26:30] really knew that Jesus was the Messiah
[1:26:32] he would never have betrayed him imagine
[1:26:34] sitting there at the feast and you I've
[1:26:35] got it later but imagine there this is
[1:26:37] the last supper feast and then Jesus
[1:26:40] says one of you is going to betray me
[1:26:43] and then it's and then and then Peter
[1:26:44] because Peter's not close to where Jesus
[1:26:46] was we'll get to it later he asked John
[1:26:48] because John was like close there with
[1:26:50] Jesus he'd say John can you ask him who
[1:26:53] it is' and then and then well John asked
[1:26:56] Jesus and Jesus says well the one that I
[1:26:58] give the soap to that's the one going to
[1:27:01] betray me I'd stop eating right then I
[1:27:02] would sit like this for the rest of the
[1:27:04] evening I I'm done doesn't matter if I'm
[1:27:06] hungry doesn't matter if I haven't even
[1:27:08] touched that food I ain't re receiving
[1:27:10] nothing on that table wouldn't you be
[1:27:12] that way I am not betraying you Lord
[1:27:17] hallelujah but the thing is because the
[1:27:19] devil was already working in his heart
[1:27:21] he did it even though Jesus said exactly
[1:27:24] and you know you know it was it was John
[1:27:26] sitting here Jesus in the middle Judas
[1:27:29] on the other side of him so it wasn't
[1:27:31] like he was doubt well the table is
[1:27:32] actually a U-shaped table but it wasn't
[1:27:34] like he didn't hear what Jesus
[1:27:36] said oh Lord help us
[1:27:38] now he say that was before Pentecost
[1:27:41] this is where I was going now I can I
[1:27:43] can probably blank this that was before
[1:27:47] Pentecost
[1:27:50] now we
[1:27:52] have you say that was before Pentecost
[1:27:55] well if he went to Pentecost he would
[1:27:56] have become a changed man you know I've
[1:27:58] had a man say to me this is years ago
[1:28:01] that Pentecost when when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:02] fell at Pentecost everyone who is a
[1:28:05] believer in that geographical location
[1:28:07] automatically received the Holy Ghost I
[1:28:09] think that is such nonsense we all have
[1:28:11] to have our own Pentecost right we may
[1:28:14] you know we all have to have a
[1:28:15] supernatural experience amen many times
[1:28:19] and I say every time it's those parts in
[1:28:21] our hearts that we don't surrender to
[1:28:23] the Lord it's the reason people don't
[1:28:25] receive the Holy Ghost right now see if
[1:28:28] we're really sincere and seek him with
[1:28:30] all our heart he will show us what is in
[1:28:32] our lives stopping from the Lord taking
[1:28:35] completely over you know there's a man
[1:28:37] called Simon the Sorcerer in Acts
[1:28:38] chapter 8 and the thing is you know you
[1:28:41] know God you know he had great influence
[1:28:43] among the people of Samaria you know
[1:28:44] people would come to him and he would
[1:28:46] give potions and make lots of money out
[1:28:48] of them and do different things and but
[1:28:50] then Philip went down there and people
[1:28:51] were healed they delivered they got
[1:28:53] baptized name of the Lord they having
[1:28:54] great joy Hallelujah but then they but
[1:28:57] none of them had received the Holy Ghost
[1:28:59] it says in Acts 8 and8 and there was
[1:29:01] great joy in that City and there was a
[1:29:04] man who was a sorcerer who used to
[1:29:06] bewitch the people of Samaria sorry I
[1:29:08] don't have it up here and and he was
[1:29:10] giving out that he himself was some
[1:29:12] great one and then he saw what Philip
[1:29:15] was doing he even got baptized and
[1:29:17] became a
[1:29:19] Believer and then he saw Peter come down
[1:29:21] who had the keys to the kingdom and and
[1:29:23] and he laid his hands on the people and
[1:29:25] then they received the Holy Ghost but
[1:29:27] then Simon didn't believe it I mean I
[1:29:30] mean sorry didn't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:29:32] and he even went to Peter and said can I
[1:29:35] give you some money that you can give me
[1:29:36] this gift that I can receive the Holy
[1:29:38] Ghost see it's all about money-making
[1:29:40] schemes but his intentions were wrong
[1:29:43] cuz he wanted to basically go from a
[1:29:44] sorcerer to a Christian but be a
[1:29:47] sorcerer at the same time we can't
[1:29:48] multitask in these things you can't have
[1:29:50] two occupations it's either God or the
[1:29:52] devil which one you can't serve two
[1:29:55] masters the scripture tells us very
[1:29:57] plainly and it says in Acts 8:18 and
[1:29:59] when Simon saw that through laying on of
[1:30:02] the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was
[1:30:03] given he offered them money I'll pay you
[1:30:06] for this what's your price name your
[1:30:07] price I want to be able to do this but
[1:30:10] then
[1:30:11] Peter Peter said unto
[1:30:13] him he says Thou but Peter said unto him
[1:30:16] acts 8 and 20 but Peter said unto him
[1:30:19] thy money perish with thee because thou
[1:30:21] Hast thought that the gift of God may be
[1:30:23] purchased with money thou Hast neither
[1:30:25] part nor lot in this matter for thy
[1:30:27] heart is not right in the sight of God
[1:30:29] repent therefore of this thy wickedness
[1:30:32] now remember he was already a baptized
[1:30:34] believer he continued with Philip the
[1:30:36] scripture says if you go read it so he
[1:30:38] was he was a Believer walking with them
[1:30:40] but he hadn't given this part of his
[1:30:42] life up repent therefore of this thy
[1:30:44] wickedness and pray God if if perhaps
[1:30:46] the thought of thine heart may be
[1:30:48] forgiven thee for I perceive that thou
[1:30:50] art in the gall of bitterness and in the
[1:30:52] bond of iniquity so here he actually was
[1:30:55] you think about this here was a man who
[1:30:57] knew he wasn't right with God he didn't
[1:30:59] have the Holy Ghost like these others
[1:31:01] and he actually goes to an apostle who
[1:31:04] has a gift that actually can perceive
[1:31:06] what's in his heart he's actually
[1:31:07] tapping into a gift of God isn't that
[1:31:09] wonderful you know I was thinking you
[1:31:11] know many times over the years you know
[1:31:13] I've tapped into gifts of God in this
[1:31:15] church you know I go to brother kabin
[1:31:17] ask him about something and wisdom would
[1:31:18] just come I speak to brother ID or or or
[1:31:21] anyone even even my wife would just talk
[1:31:23] about things in wisdom would just come
[1:31:24] why cuz you tap into a gift of God
[1:31:27] hallelujah you know we got to really
[1:31:29] think about what's what's even among us
[1:31:31] even children you you can tap into
[1:31:32] something in your parents that God will
[1:31:34] inspire them to say something to you
[1:31:37] they might even be conscious of what's
[1:31:38] going on but you can tap into God by
[1:31:41] your right approach you see so he even
[1:31:43] approached you know Peter Peter E Peter
[1:31:46] now discerned that he was in the gal of
[1:31:50] buness and in the bond of iniquity so so
[1:31:52] Peter's basically saying Simon this is
[1:31:53] what in
[1:31:55] you but then Simon answered and said
[1:31:57] pray ye for to the Lord for me that none
[1:32:00] of these things which ye have spoken
[1:32:03] come upon
[1:32:04] me so what's he saying the Lord chose
[1:32:08] Peter this is in you and Simon the
[1:32:10] sister is saying it's pray that it
[1:32:12] doesn't come into
[1:32:13] me so what's going on there Simon
[1:32:17] doesn't
[1:32:18] ackowledge he doesn't say yes that's how
[1:32:21] I am right now he just says that May
[1:32:24] these things not come into me into in
[1:32:26] the future so basically he was
[1:32:28] comfortable with the spirit that was in
[1:32:30] him are you all following Meen yeah
[1:32:33] right so so he he was actually yeah see
[1:32:36] yeah no no go back I'm glad they cook on
[1:32:39] the
[1:32:40] trigger they're big screens you can
[1:32:42] sleep behind but they're not sleeping
[1:32:43] can you put that back up see if perhaps
[1:32:46] the thought of th yep go go next
[1:32:49] one for I perceive that thou in the B
[1:32:51] Gall of bitterness and in the bond of
[1:32:53] iniquity this is your your current
[1:32:54] status Simon this is this is you right
[1:32:56] now next one go next one then answered
[1:32:59] Simon pray you to the Lord for me that
[1:33:00] none of these things which you have
[1:33:01] spoken come upon me they already were
[1:33:03] upon him he was functioning with these
[1:33:05] things in his life I don't know how many
[1:33:07] years it was but the problem is people
[1:33:09] can get so used to a demon power that
[1:33:12] they think it's them right so but but
[1:33:14] there's no record in the scripture of
[1:33:17] Simon ever getting
[1:33:19] free because he was comfortable living
[1:33:22] with that spirit I say Jesus help us
[1:33:25] help us help us Lord see we have to
[1:33:27] completely die out to ourselves right
[1:33:30] it's not trying to do better or trying
[1:33:32] to grow into it we have to completely
[1:33:35] lay their lay our whole lives on the
[1:33:37] altar our whole lives not just part of
[1:33:40] it not the convenient bits our whole
[1:33:42] life see a sacrifice cannot be consumed
[1:33:45] by the fire unless it's completely there
[1:33:46] amen hallelujah if we want the fire to
[1:33:49] fall what is that the Holy Ghost come
[1:33:50] into our lives we got to surrender
[1:33:52] everything we have you know there would
[1:33:54] be others that would profess to be
[1:33:56] Believers but they would just baptize
[1:33:58] Pharisees this is this is acts
[1:34:01] 15 there there came a whole stir up in
[1:34:04] the church you got to be circumcised you
[1:34:05] got to follow the law of Moses and then
[1:34:07] then you can become a Christian whole
[1:34:09] stir was stirring up and there was a
[1:34:12] group of them that were a sect of the
[1:34:13] Pharisees which believed Saying that it
[1:34:16] was needful to circumcise them and to
[1:34:18] and to command them to keep the law of
[1:34:20] Moses now my question is this is acts
[1:34:23] 15:5 my question is why are these people
[1:34:26] labeled as a group a sect of Pharisees
[1:34:28] which believed on Jesus why aren't they
[1:34:30] just
[1:34:31] Christians it's because they were still
[1:34:34] holding on to their old way of life like
[1:34:36] Simon was like Judas was and that thing
[1:34:39] was hindering their walk with God they
[1:34:41] couldn't go any further and you'll see
[1:34:43] that they were actually they held more
[1:34:45] dear to being a Pharisee then actually
[1:34:48] to the transforming power of Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ in the blood of the blood of the
[1:34:51] Lord why because they they were actually
[1:34:54] saying no no these Gentiles have to
[1:34:55] become like us first as Pharisees then
[1:34:57] they can become Christians but if they
[1:34:59] were truly born again if they truly
[1:35:02] transformed by the Holy Ghost they
[1:35:04] wouldn't they wouldn't be talking about
[1:35:05] being a Pharisee keeping the law right
[1:35:08] but the but their old life became more
[1:35:10] important to them than actually being
[1:35:13] transformed see and this didn't help the
[1:35:16] work of the Lord none and it's because
[1:35:19] they brought their old ways with them
[1:35:21] they had not died out to them they
[1:35:22] thought that being in the the message of
[1:35:24] the hour was just a tack on to what they
[1:35:26] already had that was the message of the
[1:35:29] hour in that day but they thought it was
[1:35:30] just a tack on but the tack on was not
[1:35:32] important as what they had already are
[1:35:35] we all following are we are you all with
[1:35:36] me we can't we can't bring our old life
[1:35:38] in it's got to die our our first nature
[1:35:42] you can't bring it in it's got to be
[1:35:44] dead and buried not just hung up for a
[1:35:46] future time it's got to be dead and
[1:35:48] buried amen
[1:35:50] hallelujah yes amen it became more
[1:35:53] important to to them being a Pharisee or
[1:35:54] making little Pharisee Christians then
[1:35:57] actually the people becoming a new
[1:35:58] creature in Christ because the Apostle
[1:36:00] Paul he was a faracy of the Pharisees
[1:36:03] but he didn't say oh you got to follow
[1:36:04] the law of Moses and become a Christian
[1:36:06] no you just got to meet
[1:36:07] him and the church said amen we're not a
[1:36:11] bunch of Pharisees this is not following
[1:36:12] a law amen you be we become new
[1:36:15] creatures in Christ Hallelujah and he
[1:36:17] comes and becomes the the Christian in
[1:36:19] us I'm really you
[1:36:23] wow
[1:36:25] okay see
[1:36:28] Judas could not in his mind work out how
[1:36:30] he could get out of fixing what he had
[1:36:33] done and he went and hung himself Peter
[1:36:37] we'll get to it Peter was was in the
[1:36:40] same bracket in terms of he denied the
[1:36:42] Lord three times he thought how on Earth
[1:36:44] can I fix this yes but he couldn't he he
[1:36:48] didn't go out of the presence of the
[1:36:50] Lord he went into the presence of the
[1:36:51] Lord
[1:36:54] that Judas when and betrayed
[1:36:58] now they already knew now I just I just
[1:37:01] want you think how crazy people can get
[1:37:03] my question is what did he think would
[1:37:06] happen to Jesus when he betrayed
[1:37:09] him this was back in John 7 so I don't
[1:37:12] know you know this is before John 12
[1:37:15] after these things Jesus walked in
[1:37:17] Galilee for he would not walk in jeury
[1:37:19] because the Jews sought to kill him so
[1:37:21] they knew he was going to kill him
[1:37:24] so then what was going through through J
[1:37:26] judas's mind when he went say well I'm
[1:37:29] going to betray the Lord but you know
[1:37:30] the devil never will ever show us the
[1:37:32] circumstan or or the or the consequences
[1:37:36] of what we
[1:37:39] do
[1:37:42] now this is this is in John 13 sorry if
[1:37:45] you know we're just going through this
[1:37:46] now before the Feast of Passover so
[1:37:48] remember Judas has been corrected by the
[1:37:50] word and he's resented it and now he's
[1:37:52] got and then straight after he was
[1:37:54] corrected he went to the chief priest to
[1:37:56] betray the Lord now before the Feast of
[1:37:59] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:38:02] was come that he should depart out of
[1:38:03] this world unto the father having loved
[1:38:05] his own where which were in the world he
[1:38:07] loved them until the end and supper
[1:38:09] being ended the devil having now put
[1:38:11] into the heart of judas's scariot
[1:38:13] Simon's son to betray him so now this is
[1:38:17] what resentment can do yes it opens a
[1:38:20] door for the devil to put a thought in
[1:38:23] so so the devil put in judas's heart go
[1:38:26] betray this man he had to agree with
[1:38:29] that thought right he had to consciously
[1:38:32] agree with that thought now this offense
[1:38:36] opened the door to the devil to put in
[1:38:39] his mind to sell out the word now maybe
[1:38:42] maybe Judas would begin to think in his
[1:38:44] mind I don't understand Jesus here's
[1:38:48] Mary breaks pretty much every rule in
[1:38:50] the cood and he says she has done a good
[1:38:53] thing and we could have really helped
[1:38:55] the poor with that money this man just
[1:38:57] doesn't you know he's he's so caught up
[1:39:00] in what about the Natural Things what
[1:39:02] about helping the poor you know he's
[1:39:04] kind of I think he's missing the point
[1:39:07] remember remember Jesus Jesus was a man
[1:39:10] but he never mistreated anyone in his
[1:39:12] life cuz there's no Mark against him so
[1:39:15] it's not like you know Jesus God In the
[1:39:17] Flesh and did this he did no no he
[1:39:18] always did things exactly right so
[1:39:21] there's nothing that Jesus actually did
[1:39:23] towards Judas that Judas could have said
[1:39:25] no no no I'm justified in my
[1:39:28] actions but it was his resentment
[1:39:30] because he held on to being a thief more
[1:39:32] than being a disciple which caused these
[1:39:34] things to happen see we could have
[1:39:36] really helped the poor with that money
[1:39:37] and myself of course well I do all this
[1:39:39] work carrying the money and keeping tabs
[1:39:41] so yeah I think I should be able to have
[1:39:43] a five finger discount from time to time
[1:39:45] you know just to keep things you know
[1:39:47] keep things running and you know he
[1:39:49] seems like he just has lost his vision
[1:39:50] he's so so shortsighted and you know
[1:39:53] maybe begin to think that way but we
[1:39:55] know the Lord knows where everything is
[1:39:57] he would speak to Peter one day when
[1:39:59] when they needed tribute money he said
[1:40:01] go fishing the first fish you catch open
[1:40:04] its mouth there'll be a coin in there go
[1:40:06] pay the tribute with that so he knew
[1:40:07] exactly where everything was but see the
[1:40:09] devil had put it in in in judas's heart
[1:40:12] this thought to go betray Jesus see we
[1:40:14] got to be careful what thoughts we
[1:40:15] entertain yes we got to be very careful
[1:40:18] what thoughts we entertain
[1:40:23] and then he tells he tells his disciples
[1:40:26] one of you is going to betray
[1:40:28] me but notice none of the none of the
[1:40:32] disciples see and then the disciples
[1:40:35] looked one on another doubting of whom
[1:40:37] he spake so when he said these words one
[1:40:39] of you is going to betray me they didn't
[1:40:41] all say it's
[1:40:42] Judas they had no idea this is how close
[1:40:45] remember this is the believer in the
[1:40:47] make believer so close together that you
[1:40:50] can't it's very hard to tell before
[1:40:52] Pentecost
[1:40:53] who's the real deal amen and so they
[1:40:56] didn't say it's him oh obviously it's
[1:40:59] Judas no they had no idea who it was
[1:41:02] going to be and you know I think it's
[1:41:04] incredible you think here's here's Judas
[1:41:07] he has seen Jesus discern Hearts
[1:41:09] before yeah the woman of the Well's
[1:41:12] heart many others he seen that happen
[1:41:14] and then he goes to the see this is how
[1:41:15] blinding the devil gets he goes to the
[1:41:18] scribes and Pharisees he arranges the
[1:41:20] whole thing and then he walks back into
[1:41:22] church
[1:41:25] as if nothing happened you think Jesus
[1:41:27] couldn't look through
[1:41:29] that I say Jesus knows all about
[1:41:34] everything now but Peter had a few marks
[1:41:37] against his
[1:41:38] name so I've talked a bit about the
[1:41:41] heart of Judas now we're going to talk
[1:41:42] about the heart of Peter I said be a
[1:41:44] Peter never be a Judas now Peter had a
[1:41:47] few marks against his
[1:41:49] name even even even when Jesus called
[1:41:52] the discip deciples he said don't you
[1:41:54] know I've called you 12 chosen you 12
[1:41:57] and one of you is a devil so this is
[1:41:59] already hanging over them he called one
[1:42:01] of us a
[1:42:02] deal oh boy and then after after
[1:42:07] this Peter would Jesus would ask his
[1:42:10] disciples who do men say that I am yeah
[1:42:12] and then you know he you know he would
[1:42:14] say well they say that you're one of the
[1:42:16] prophets Isaiah Jeremiah or one of the
[1:42:18] prophets but then Jesus would ask but
[1:42:20] who do you say that I am and then he
[1:42:22] would say well Thou Art the Christ Simon
[1:42:23] Peter would say thou art the Christ the
[1:42:25] son of the Living God and Jesus said
[1:42:27] blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for
[1:42:28] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:42:30] you but my Father which is in heaven and
[1:42:32] Upon This Rock I'll build my church The
[1:42:34] revelation of who Jesus Christ is I'll
[1:42:36] build my church upon that rock but then
[1:42:38] Jesus immediately after that begin to
[1:42:40] tell his disciples how he would be
[1:42:42] crucified raised again on the third day
[1:42:44] but then Peter after he received this
[1:42:46] Revelation that Jesus was the Christ he
[1:42:49] began to rebuke Jesus saying no no no
[1:42:51] far be it from the Lord that this shall
[1:42:54] be unto thee in other words Lord you're
[1:42:56] not going to be crucified this is not
[1:42:58] going to happen but then notice Jesus
[1:43:00] would turn to him and say unto Peter get
[1:43:03] thee behind me Satan for thou art an
[1:43:05] offense unto me for thou savest not the
[1:43:07] things that be of God but those that be
[1:43:10] of men now we know that he's not calling
[1:43:14] Peter Satan but he's identifying the
[1:43:17] inspiration that's speaking through
[1:43:19] Peter a few minutes before this it was
[1:43:22] God speaking through through Peter thou
[1:43:23] artart the Christ the son of the Living
[1:43:25] God Nick minute when Jesus begins to say
[1:43:28] about what he had to accomplish and and
[1:43:30] Peter's actually rebuffing him saying no
[1:43:32] no you're not going to do this he see he
[1:43:34] could not understand how God could
[1:43:36] suffer in the flesh and die for Humanity
[1:43:38] and so but this was because Satan
[1:43:40] doesn't sure he sure doesn't understand
[1:43:41] that himself and so he was inspiring
[1:43:44] Peter to actually say Lord you're not
[1:43:46] going to do this and so when he said get
[1:43:48] thee behind me Satan he was identifying
[1:43:50] the inspiration of the spirit that was
[1:43:52] upon Peter
[1:43:53] so here's Peter he's already be called
[1:43:57] Satan and Jesus said one of you is a
[1:43:59] devil and then and he says one of you is
[1:44:02] going to betray me so how do you think
[1:44:04] he's sitting right
[1:44:08] there and then after Jesus Jesus said to
[1:44:12] said to um them you're going to betray
[1:44:15] me so there was there was a disciple
[1:44:18] that was leaning on see none of them
[1:44:19] knew it was
[1:44:21] Judas none of them realized it was him
[1:44:24] and even even in the Inner Circle there
[1:44:26] at the Last Supper it was Jesus John and
[1:44:29] Judas sitting
[1:44:31] there and then so Simon Peter actually
[1:44:33] had to go ask ask him and say ask John
[1:44:38] can you find out who it is and then he
[1:44:40] says you're it's the one that you dips
[1:44:43] dips the
[1:44:45] so will be the next
[1:44:49] one and then of course immediately I
[1:44:52] would have stopped eating
[1:44:53] but he gives the soop he gave it to
[1:44:56] judas's and then um Jesus answered it is
[1:44:59] he to whom I give a so when I have
[1:45:01] dipped it and when he had dipped the
[1:45:02] soap he gave it to Judas scariot now
[1:45:05] imagine if Jesus just said these words
[1:45:07] he says it's the one I give the soap
[1:45:09] to I'm sitting on my
[1:45:11] hands but Judas because the devil had
[1:45:14] put it in his mind to betray the Lord
[1:45:16] took it and then when he took it then
[1:45:19] Satan entered into him and then he
[1:45:21] became an instrument to do Satan's will
[1:45:24] and then he went what thou doest do
[1:45:26] quickly and then he went out and the
[1:45:27] disciples didn't even know what was
[1:45:28] going on now in this time it's amazing
[1:45:31] because after I don't have it here but
[1:45:34] after um Judas leaves then Jesus says to
[1:45:37] his disciples now I give you a new
[1:45:39] commandment that you love one another
[1:45:41] and by this all men shall know that you
[1:45:43] are my disciples because you love one
[1:45:45] another so I could say hatred had to
[1:45:47] leave the room in order for him to say
[1:45:50] now now this is actually something I
[1:45:52] can't tell everyone but now I've
[1:45:53] ordained you to love one another love
[1:45:56] one another with the love of
[1:45:58] God Amen not everyone can do that oh
[1:46:01] Lord give us the Holy Ghost so we can
[1:46:02] love one
[1:46:04] another and then Simon Peter would
[1:46:06] actually say to Jesus wherever you go
[1:46:08] I'm going to go with you I'll come die
[1:46:09] with
[1:46:10] you and he says no no you're going to
[1:46:12] deny me three
[1:46:14] times so Simon Simon had a heart he
[1:46:18] miserably failed just like Judas
[1:46:21] miserably failed but he didn't betray
[1:46:23] the Lord but when when the Lord really
[1:46:25] needed him in his great trial he
[1:46:27] couldn't stand that's the same thing
[1:46:29] with any believer without the Holy Ghost
[1:46:31] you can't stand the pressure of the age
[1:46:33] but with him we can un we can we can
[1:46:35] withstand all things so so Jesus says to
[1:46:38] him before the crows three times I
[1:46:41] mean the shall not Crow till thou
[1:46:43] Hast denied me Thrice and Peter never
[1:46:46] says oh Lord may I not have to go
[1:46:48] through this no in his mind you know
[1:46:51] sometimes when people don't answer this
[1:46:52] saying I don't agree with
[1:46:54] you so basically he's saying to to the
[1:46:57] Lord I don't I don't believe what you
[1:46:58] just told me and here's someone who can
[1:47:00] look into the future and into the past
[1:47:02] he knows exactly what's going to happen
[1:47:04] and he's seen it go he told them go into
[1:47:06] the village there's a cult there go get
[1:47:09] it when when you go to untie the the
[1:47:11] owner will come out and say what are you
[1:47:13] doing he says well the master has need
[1:47:15] of this and you'll bring it here and so
[1:47:17] he's already lived out a vision before
[1:47:19] and then so the the Lord is telling him
[1:47:21] this and basically he's saying by not
[1:47:23] answering I don't believe
[1:47:25] you this is intellectual
[1:47:27] Faith instead of actually falling on the
[1:47:29] Rock and saying
[1:47:31] Lord help me forgive me Lord take my
[1:47:35] pride out of my life that I think I can
[1:47:38] stand on my Humanity this this this big
[1:47:40] Burly fisherman he basically said no I
[1:47:44] won't deny you and then the pressure
[1:47:45] came on we know the rest of the story
[1:47:47] don't we Jesus was
[1:47:49] betrayed he was taken Peter went Peter
[1:47:53] went with them was was warming himself
[1:47:55] by the fire and then as just servants
[1:47:58] come along women came along different
[1:47:59] ones aren't you a Galilean aren't you
[1:48:01] aren't you one of his disciples he says
[1:48:03] no I don't know the man totally denied
[1:48:06] him three times publicly and then and
[1:48:09] then then in one part of the gospels
[1:48:11] after the crowed or just before
[1:48:14] Jesus looked him in the
[1:48:16] eyes and then he went out weeping
[1:48:21] bitterly so here we are
[1:48:24] we have a man who has betrayed the
[1:48:27] Lord and he knows he is he has betrayed
[1:48:30] innocent
[1:48:31] blood and we have a man who said he
[1:48:34] would not deny the Lord and he's denied
[1:48:35] the
[1:48:37] Lord one of them had pride in his heart
[1:48:39] that he was the best the biggest and the
[1:48:41] brightest Peter that he's going to stand
[1:48:43] when the Lord really needs him and he
[1:48:44] fails miserably he's been called a devil
[1:48:47] you know he's been you know well you
[1:48:49] know he Jesus has identified the
[1:48:51] inspiration that that that is en through
[1:48:53] him here's Judas who no one would have
[1:48:55] thought would have been the betrayer
[1:48:57] betrays him because he'd rather be a
[1:48:59] thief than a disciple and so now he
[1:49:02] really brings out what's in the heart of
[1:49:05] man because on one hand they both needed
[1:49:09] forgiveness of what what they did they
[1:49:12] both needed it right and so one one it
[1:49:17] actually he left the presence of the
[1:49:19] Lord and he never came back Judas what
[1:49:22] left the presence of the Lord he didn't
[1:49:25] know he was forgiven but he just knew if
[1:49:26] I could just get back to where the
[1:49:28] master is hallelujah I don't know if
[1:49:31] I'll be received but I'm going anyway
[1:49:34] amen that's a that's a real believer to
[1:49:35] me Hallelujah in spite of failure
[1:49:39] fluster disappointment whatever it may
[1:49:41] be they say if I can just get into the
[1:49:43] presence of God hallelujah I don't know
[1:49:46] if I'll be receive but I'm coming
[1:49:48] anyway
[1:49:51] hallelujah amen
[1:49:54] see it's what a crushing disappointment
[1:49:57] it must have been for the
[1:49:59] disciples it must have been such a such
[1:50:02] a disappointment they would never have
[1:50:03] thought imagine he just Rose Lazarus
[1:50:06] from the grave how could this man ever
[1:50:08] die and here he is taken away by you
[1:50:11] know by the soldiers different things
[1:50:13] and and and he doesn't even really say a
[1:50:15] word and he's hanging there on Calvary
[1:50:17] now he's in a tomb the their whole world
[1:50:19] just falls apart what a crushing
[1:50:21] disappointment for the apostles they had
[1:50:23] seen their savior the one they had loved
[1:50:25] they had seen him even raise up the Dead
[1:50:27] from the grave they had seen him do that
[1:50:29] and then they think here he lays cold in
[1:50:31] the grave himself this
[1:50:33] morning those people who had seen him
[1:50:35] Open the Eyes of the blind seen him
[1:50:38] stand there perceive the very thoughts
[1:50:39] that was in the people's hearts how did
[1:50:41] he know that'd say uh that them was
[1:50:45] coming after him how did he know why
[1:50:46] didn't he know Judas Judas betray him
[1:50:49] see he knew it why didn't he know the
[1:50:51] soldiers were coming up the mountain
[1:50:52] mountains there with starves and and and
[1:50:54] swords and everything to get him if he
[1:50:56] could perceive their thoughts see the
[1:50:58] devil was working on them putting them
[1:51:01] on an as sheep see if we go through hard
[1:51:05] times we need those hard times sometimes
[1:51:08] maybe the lord always brings out
[1:51:10] everything for his glory but Peter had
[1:51:12] to go on an as sheep because God had to
[1:51:14] mold him in order for him to be the
[1:51:16] spokesman Acts chapter 2 he thought he
[1:51:18] had the goods but he didn't have the
[1:51:20] goods but the thing is the Lord you know
[1:51:22] we can utterly fail but the Lord isn't
[1:51:25] going to leave us in our utter failure
[1:51:27] amen amen amen he's not going to leave
[1:51:30] us just just in that state if we have a
[1:51:32] heart of Lord I want to get back into
[1:51:33] your presence Lord oh I'm wrong I know
[1:51:35] I'm wrong and you know maybe you don't
[1:51:37] know the way out but Lord I want to get
[1:51:39] back see Peter wanted to get back into
[1:51:40] his presence his actions proved it
[1:51:43] Hallelujah and and we'll get to that
[1:51:45] soon see the devil was working on them
[1:51:47] putting them on an ash sheep for they
[1:51:49] wanted to give them a testimony of I
[1:51:51] know
[1:51:53] see they had to know that their redeemer
[1:51:54] lived see not guess or perhaps it's so I
[1:51:57] know I know and remember those trials
[1:51:59] are brought upon you the same way so
[1:52:01] that you'll not say well maybe this is
[1:52:03] right maybe the scripture is true maybe
[1:52:05] Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy
[1:52:07] Ghost is right but when you get that
[1:52:09] experience and come off that Ash Heap
[1:52:11] and you get the revelation of God by the
[1:52:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can scream
[1:52:15] I know my redeemer liveth because he
[1:52:17] lives in me Hallelujah see see that
[1:52:21] cures everything in life that really
[1:52:23] cures everything in life we don't need
[1:52:25] seven steps to become a better person
[1:52:27] you just we need more of God we just
[1:52:29] need more of his presence in our lives
[1:52:31] Hallelujah that takes all the fussing
[1:52:32] all the trouble all the anxiety all the
[1:52:34] whatever it may be it takes it out amen
[1:52:37] who's had that experience
[1:52:39] Hallelujah see Peter got to a stage
[1:52:41] where he said I'll just go fishing
[1:52:43] because he was a fisherman I'm just
[1:52:44] going to go back to all my old life of
[1:52:46] course he was a leader the disciples
[1:52:48] said well we'll just go with you and
[1:52:51] they went fishing all night remember
[1:52:53] they knew you think well at least I can
[1:52:55] fish at least I can do something you
[1:52:58] know and then they fish all night they
[1:53:01] throw the net out and you can feel when
[1:53:03] you got something there's a tug or a
[1:53:05] weight you know pull it up it feels the
[1:53:07] same throw it out again nothing rinse
[1:53:11] and repeat all
[1:53:13] night and your hope begins to
[1:53:16] fade because the thing you thought you
[1:53:18] were you can't do no more not a single
[1:53:20] fish nothing all
[1:53:23] night but then as the dawn
[1:53:26] breaks remember his Mercy a new Every
[1:53:29] Morning his mercies a new Every Morning
[1:53:31] Hallelujah they don't get old they don't
[1:53:33] get St they new every morning at the
[1:53:35] breaking of that Dawn they saw a figure
[1:53:37] standing on the on the bank and he cried
[1:53:41] out children do you have any fish do you
[1:53:44] think they would have been happy in
[1:53:45] their response no we don't have nothing
[1:53:49] Hallelujah that would have been grumpy
[1:53:52] you know no no we got nothing all night
[1:53:55] Nole fish I thought I was a fisherman I
[1:53:58] really did I really thought I could fish
[1:54:01] I had the skill I had everything and
[1:54:03] nothing oh and then they hear a cry
[1:54:06] throw your net on the other side the
[1:54:09] other side we've tried that the other
[1:54:10] side okay and they throw it out
[1:54:13] immediately it was full Hallelujah and
[1:54:16] then John who could maybe see a bit
[1:54:18] better than Peter said to said to Peter
[1:54:20] it's the Lord
[1:54:22] now here he is he's a man who feels so
[1:54:25] condemned he wept bitterly because he
[1:54:27] denied the Lord three times he was
[1:54:29] broken inside he went tried to go back
[1:54:32] to his old life that failed and now
[1:54:35] here's the resurrected Lord remember
[1:54:36] it's a new
[1:54:37] day Hallelujah and then John says it's
[1:54:41] the Lord now here's a believer's heart
[1:54:43] he's Broken Hallelujah he can't do
[1:54:46] nothing to get off the Z sheep but
[1:54:48] something in him just says I got to get
[1:54:50] to where he is I don't want to stay in
[1:54:53] this boat I got to get got to get to
[1:54:54] where he's at Hallelujah it should be
[1:54:56] the same thing with you and I oh I
[1:54:58] failed but I just got to get to where he
[1:55:00] is if I can just get into his presence
[1:55:02] one more time Hallelujah everything will
[1:55:05] be fine Hallelujah so he puts on his
[1:55:08] fishing coat swims swims to the shore he
[1:55:11] has no idea what the Lord's going to say
[1:55:14] to him but he just comes up gets there
[1:55:18] before the rest of them hauling in these
[1:55:20] fish and he sits there by by the
[1:55:23] fire and then the Lord begins to talk to
[1:55:26] him what do you think he's going to say
[1:55:29] Peter didn't know what he's going to say
[1:55:31] he say brother Ben I've heard these
[1:55:32] stories over and over again well I just
[1:55:34] pray it would live today right and he
[1:55:36] would he would sit there and and then
[1:55:38] and then Jesus would speak to him
[1:55:41] Peter do you love
[1:55:44] me thousand emotions would flood through
[1:55:46] his
[1:55:47] being you know I love you feed my sheep
[1:55:52] Peter do you love
[1:55:54] me Lord you know I love you feed my
[1:55:58] lambs and then he and then he would say
[1:56:00] a third time you think this would kind
[1:56:03] of grade on the soul a bit and then he
[1:56:05] says Lord you know I love
[1:56:08] you Hallelujah he says well when you're
[1:56:11] converted strengthen the Brethren amen
[1:56:14] see this is what we need this is what
[1:56:17] really takes all the deviation out of
[1:56:19] our walk when we're really converted yes
[1:56:22] not not not mentally being tied to a
[1:56:25] word right not mentally being tied to a
[1:56:28] word but the but the God who gave the
[1:56:30] word comes and lives on the inside of
[1:56:31] the inside of us and that word we just
[1:56:33] find ourselves living by that word
[1:56:35] because he's in the inside of the inside
[1:56:37] of us there's no deviation when that
[1:56:39] happens hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:56:43] know a burden is something we need yeah
[1:56:47] when someone to me really meets the Lord
[1:56:49] they get a burden amen they get a burden
[1:56:52] for for one another yes sir they get a
[1:56:54] burden to see God live and they put that
[1:56:56] burden before anything
[1:56:58] else Hallelujah they put that burden
[1:57:00] before anything else they have a burden
[1:57:02] for the Youth amen they have a burden
[1:57:05] for the old people they have a burden
[1:57:06] for the children they have a burden for
[1:57:08] every and in between they have a burden
[1:57:11] Hallelujah isn't that right we had we
[1:57:14] had you know I think brother Isaac said
[1:57:16] here when it was he says you know we
[1:57:17] were the super youth I'm just deviating
[1:57:19] but here we deviate you know we were the
[1:57:21] super youth when we started the church
[1:57:23] and we were the super youth when we
[1:57:24] started the church we were we were the
[1:57:26] super youth age but we just had a burden
[1:57:28] amen that's not how is this going to
[1:57:30] happen we just had a burden Hallelujah
[1:57:33] and that was the thing Peter had a had a
[1:57:35] burden I just got to get into his
[1:57:37] presence amen
[1:57:40] hallelujah some of you are looking at me
[1:57:42] like what are you talking about it
[1:57:44] changes the world it changed Peter's
[1:57:46] world just to get into the presence of
[1:57:48] the Master One More Time hallelujah
[1:57:51] hallelujah and all of a sudden they
[1:57:52] looked over on the bank just the same
[1:57:54] kind of Revelation that job got there
[1:57:56] they seen that job seen 4,000 years
[1:57:58] before there stood the Redeemer alive
[1:58:01] and fresh standing on the bank with a
[1:58:03] Fire Maiden fish cooked on it like that
[1:58:05] and said invited them Jesus has a table
[1:58:08] spread where the saints of God are fed
[1:58:10] he invites his chosen people come and
[1:58:12] dine with his Mana he do feed and
[1:58:15] supplies our every need oh was sweet to
[1:58:17] S with Jesus all the time come and die
[1:58:20] the master cth come and die
[1:58:22] you may Feast at jesus' table all the
[1:58:26] time Hallelujah so there's the two
[1:58:29] hearts Judas because he held on to his
[1:58:33] old life more than walking with the Lord
[1:58:36] it made him betray the
[1:58:39] Lord he was corrected he was corrected
[1:58:42] like the other disciples but the other
[1:58:44] disciples actually forsook all see we
[1:58:47] can physically forsake all but what's in
[1:58:49] here see it's the things in here we need
[1:58:51] to forsake that are not of the word if
[1:58:53] it's contrary to the word some little
[1:58:55] private thing to try manipulate and do
[1:58:57] do your own sign hustle that's got to
[1:59:00] die am that's a thing that hinders
[1:59:02] people from actually walking more with
[1:59:04] the
[1:59:05] Lord amen yeah but they all they're all
[1:59:08] corrected by the same Lord Jesus but
[1:59:11] because of that Judas went and decided
[1:59:13] to do what he
[1:59:15] did but also because the others had a
[1:59:17] real heart of a Believer like Peter even
[1:59:20] though he miserably failed he if I could
[1:59:22] just get into the presence of God I know
[1:59:25] all will be
[1:59:26] fine even though as I say he did not
[1:59:29] know how he would be
[1:59:32] received I just I'm just going to finish
[1:59:34] with this and the only thing we have to
[1:59:35] do is to know he is here is get yourself
[1:59:38] out of the way see as long as you're in
[1:59:40] the way then God cannot do nothing for
[1:59:42] you when you think your thoughts then
[1:59:44] God's thoughts don't have a chance his
[1:59:46] thoughts are his word we know amen but
[1:59:50] if you'll quit thinking your thoughts
[1:59:51] and think think his thoughts my thoughts
[1:59:53] are not your thoughts he said if there
[1:59:55] be any praise if there be any virtue
[1:59:57] think on these things not what some
[1:59:59] church is going to say about it but what
[2:00:01] God said about it like this little lady
[2:00:04] laying here shaking in this cot that uh
[2:00:07] that woman is going to lay like that all
[2:00:09] of her life unless she can get her faith
[2:00:12] set straight on Jesus Christ and no
[2:00:14] matter what goes uh comes or goes it be
[2:00:17] revealed to her then there is nothing
[2:00:19] going to stop the healing that's right
[2:00:21] but when you get your it's it depends on
[2:00:23] what you're thinking about if you'll
[2:00:25] just believe and have faith God can do
[2:00:27] anything for you and the greatest thing
[2:00:29] he can do for you tonight I'll say this
[2:00:30] morning is sweep your soul right back
[2:00:33] into the presence of his being right
[2:00:35] back there to where every person
[2:00:36] Hallelujah in here that's what he wants
[2:00:38] to do sweep ourselves back into the prin
[2:00:40] of his being Hallelujah but we just have
[2:00:42] to take him at his word you know Jesus
[2:00:46] said only
[2:00:47] believe only believe his promises don't
[2:00:50] bring anything into consideration but
[2:00:52] only take him at his word only believe
[2:00:54] and but what he wants to do is sweep our
[2:00:56] souls right back into the presence of
[2:00:57] his being just like Peter was swept back
[2:00:59] into the prince of is being there
[2:01:01] Hallelujah on that dawning of that new
[2:01:03] day and it changed his life he says just
[2:01:08] think oh sorry I don't have this one on
[2:01:10] here just think there's a continuation
[2:01:12] of that quote from Once More Lord 1963
[2:01:14] in sh Port just think what if the Holy
[2:01:16] Ghost has had everybody in here
[2:01:18] completely in his control think of what
[2:01:20] would take place tonight think what
[2:01:22] would take place in sh Port by this time

[2:01:38] they was doing if the Holy Ghost could
[2:01:40] take completely control why don't he he
[2:01:43] wants to he's willing to he's waiting

[2:02:02] it but you know we shouldn't limit God
