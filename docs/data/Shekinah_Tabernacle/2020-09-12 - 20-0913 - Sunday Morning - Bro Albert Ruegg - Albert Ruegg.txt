bless you everyone great to have all the visitors and trust you'll feel welcome and we've got a baby dedication this morning a little william's going to be dedicated to the lord so just as honey you want to bring him up and and and the girls and and by the elbow can you come forward too we're going to sing bring them in and you're glad we can give our little ones to jesus before the devil can get get his filthy hands on them i mean sing the shall we say as they come forward bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to jesus bring them [Music] in [Music] amen god bless you all it's good to be here amongst other believers and it's a special occasion as well ben and christine bring william benjamin gloin to be dedicated to the lord it's a wonderful thing if parents do that not every parent does that there is a lot of babies sprinkled in the world you know not understanding the scriptures but uh there is a scripture in the bible i like to read first where jesus said oh bless the children mark 10 verses 13 to 16 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought him brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them that's what the lord did you know the disciples rebuked him just before before he dedicated or blessed the children he was preaching on people not to commit adultery not to put their wives away not to put their husbands away he preached on that and the disciples thought here come little children oh we talk about errol stuff you know what's that got to do with it that's why they rebuked him i believe they said now it's no part but you see the bible says let young and old worship the lord together and you know children are as much part of everything as the older ones and i've heard myself many many young people or when they were older remembering when there were children who treated them nice and who didn't amen let's just uh read one little quote here uh now they brought children and infants to jesus that he might put his hands upon them and bless them now we are not jesus but do this in representation of him i believe that if jesus will be standing here this morning that you would bring william to him amen to be blessed so to dedicate your child to the lord publicly i believe it's like we we had our own baptism a public declaration we believe in the lord and that's what ben and christine are doing this morning bring william benjamin gloin to be part of the family of god and to dedicate him to the lord can we just um perhaps pray together and let's just pray heavenly father this morning we come humbly before they we know that you are the creator of all things you have given william benjamin to christine and ben to be part of their family and lord they want him to grow up knowing you knowing the power of god knowing the anointing of god we just pray and dedicate him into your kingdom into your hands we pray that you would just bless him that he would direct him amen and lord should he tarry that he would find you at a young age which is pray also your blessings upon chris dean and benjamin that they direct and guide and lead the children according to your word just pray please grant them wisdom and good health and strength and ask your blessings upon the family especially upon william in jesus christ's name amen amen amen amen amen amen [Applause] thank you very much oh no if you want to lead us in a song have your liberty brother is going to preach the word of god to us this morning i believe he has the lord's put something on his heart for all of us amen so god bless you have you lived could we just start doing some more whatever you'd like to do all right let's get straight into it [Laughter] um i'll read one scripture while we stand um i've got first john 5 verse 4 first john verse chapter 5 verse 4 and i'll read it out of the amplified bible which is uh highlights a bit more for everyone born of god is victorious and overcomes the world and this is the victory that has conquered and overcome the world our continuing persistent faith in jesus the son of god amen you may be seated everyone born of god is victorious and overcomes the world that's a condition you see to be victorious and to be victorious to overcome the world you know it doesn't mean much to a lot of people what that scripture overcome the world what's what's to overcome but for a christian for a believer we have to overcome what is anti-christ what is anti-god and we live in a day like never ever before so close to the coming of the lord and the bible talks about how there's a great falling away i know we see it all around us i don't know about you but i've been around for a little while now and i've seen things change so much and so rapidly what when i was young you would have thought no it's impossible that never would happen you know the most incredible things but now it's happening right around us we live right at the end of time and to me it's exciting to some it's frightening but it's exciting for the believer it's not a frightening thing because he's gave us power to overcome these things so we can stand at the day of christ and in him we can stand sure so we we know there is not everybody's a believer there's as much there is a a great falling away there's i think a great drawing closer to god and i want to be in that group drawing closer to him and closer to his word recognizing his word and stay with it no matter what happens around us so there only be two two types of people at the end you know like you know the the story of uh the titanic when the titanic sank when they boarded the plane at the plane the the boat there was a whole lot of different people there was rich people famous people there were poor people down below on the lowest deck and there was all sorts of people there were men there were women there were children but when the boat sank there was only the deed and the living the survivors and the lost amen and so is in the last day there only be the believers those that are saved and the unbelievers which go to perdition you know there's not this group this and this group there it's only one or the other so we are at the end there is the overcomers and there's the lost now with the decline of um of the world and what we see outside there is there is uh also more persecution towards the christians i'm just putting these things out so we we see where we're going and don't be surprised don't be surprised i remember even here um many years ago i went to a meeting in gisborne and the pastor was saying how the council and the people appreciate we are christians and all these things but those days are gone they don't appreciate being a christian they start to hate you they start to work against you they start to say bad things about you they want to put you in a bad light they want to put you in with all the extreme whatever goes on but it's not like that anymore it's getting worse and worse but it gets closer and closer to their time and when you see these things look up they've redemption drawers nice that's what it is so there's bless for me my wife was just telling me the other day she was uh going somewhere in the car and the radio was on and there was some talk back or something but there was all this blasphemy against god and against christians you see when it's against god it's against you because you identify with the representation of him so don't be upset just rejoice when you see these things so we can overcome these things by the power of god and by his word now it will get more extreme the most extreme is actually during the tribulation itself which i believe the christians will not go through but some will go through i just like to read you a few scriptures here revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also became and i'm sit down with my father in his throne so to him that overcomes there are people that will overcome you know sometimes you see great big problems and you think no it's not possible all things are possible everything you can overcome with the power of god there's nothing impossible you get into situations in life and you think there's no way out especially if a pile of bills or something no way you know i earned so much a week and this and if i sell that no way i can get there but the way the lord makes a way i've experienced it myself many times but uh we are overcomers we believe in overcoming revelations 12 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death so there is overcoming by believing in christ in a power of the blood and testify of it it's important to witness of it now we go and read a few scriptures about the lost i'd just like you to put you in the picture here revelations 9 16 to 21 and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that set up on them having the breastplate of fire and of chest sin and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouth issued fire and smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of the man killed of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouth for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and their heads and with them they do hurt now listen to this and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands you would think if these things happen you start to repent and seek god and say look something now they hate him more and more and more and even if they say the hand of god they don't want it you see that that's what happens to people and said and that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear no walk you see neither repent the day of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their theft they harden the heart more and more and more and once people go that way they hate god so much they can't even receive christ or mercy that they don't want it they don't want it they say oh what is god yeah i've met people like that you witnessed to them i went into a man about six months ago and he was uh dying of cancer and i thought i like to encourage him that there's hope and some of you may know but quite a few years ago now our neighbor he was dying of cancer he was 85 years old he was i went to see him hardly recognizable just a skeleton any pain in agony and he said the doctor gave me two weeks to live but i don't think i might get that long and i said it then he said well i can't do a thing about it i said well all i know is what this word says so i told him about it and he got nervous and kind of dismissed me but rang me back one and a half hours later can you come and talk to me so i went back and then first he explained how the pains got worse and different and i said look i'm not a doctor but i can tell you what the bible says i said a cancer has a life and that life's not of god and the lord said lay hands on the sick they recover cast out demons and i said to him i can pray for you but you have to have faith he said oh i have faith he's never been in church he said i have faith i laid my hand on him asked the lord to forgive me sins then i told satan to leave him i said amen and you know i didn't think of anything there was no great fire come down from heaven you know it was half a minute late he said pains are going away you know he was totally healed he died 90 years old of old age not of cancer you see that is the power of god that is his word now i was telling this man trying to encourage him and that there's hope i couldn't even get started with the testimony yeah i said look we always can prayer prayer get away with that rubbish that god rubbish and he blasted me he almost attacked me and i thought well i walked away never seen him since i think he died but you see there are people they get so hardened towards god you just can't do a thing with them but there are people that never really heard of the power of god and they believe it if they come across it so there's still people around so in the book of revelation many scriptures uh 69 it said and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which has power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory see you have those groups and in chapter 16 verses 10 11 says and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they knew their tongues for pain and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their souls and repented not of their deeds what's got that to do with it i can do what i want you see people don't realize god gave his word for a reason it was for our protection not to curse us but if people don't want that they still they're lord so the believers will overcome and be victorious because we don't belong to this world we belong to the kingdom of god you know we we don't have to fight for the kingdom down here we can make a stand and call things wrong and call things which are right right but we are not fighting for this kingdom because we don't belong to it and you know you feel like an alien more and more in this world when when you stay with a word you don't even have to change i i remember years ago i said to my mother she said you're so extreme i said no mother i'm not extreme you're so extreme far away from the truth that's what it is and even if you don't change if you just stay as you are if it goes on the same way in 10 years you're extreme definitely you become extreme and then you now consider one of those extreme fundamental christians all right now i read you john 15 verses 19 to 21 if you were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hates you remember the world that is the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you but if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me so there is it's a twofold thing if they hate god they will hate you too if you give a true true signal of who you are if you show your colors they will hate you too but if they hear you they'll hear you as they would have heard god himself so there is a great big responsibility and the great big well said this way he says if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also so whether it's jesus saying are you saying the truth they will listen to it and all that extra oh it's only him or her or or a child told me you know don't need to listen to that or he doesn't come to our church you don't need to hear him no that's wrong we hear him if he speaks through his children now john 3 13 to 15 says a no man has ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so much the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believes them in him should not perish but have eternal life so our eyes are towards christ that's that's what it really comes to our eyes are towards christ who pay the price for our salvation we know where we're going we know we've been forgiven we know he filled us with the holy ghost we know we're part of him we're sons and daughters of god so there's no fear of what's going on around us and it's getting worse honestly it's getting worse some people get quite fearful concerned you know but there's no fear we're a spiritual lord is this casted out of fear so if you're in the presence of god all fear leaves you all worries leave you all concerns leave you let's just go enter into their presence that's what it comes to we can see it's happening around us and praise god for eyes that can see you know it's that's a tremendous thing if you can actually see if you don't see you just get swallowed up with the rest if you don't see it some people just don't see it i don't think it's that bad you know that there's it's terrible did you know brother branham said 60 all the years ago it he thought it can't get any worse you know in the 60s you know you had had a bit of things going on but it was not like now men wouldn't marry men and women wouldn't marry women for instance you wouldn't have all that nonsense and you thought it couldn't get any worse it is so bad now and a lot of people don't see it you know you're born into this world as a child you think it's all all normal because you don't see it you taught yeah you know the children who were born in sodom they didn't think it was all that bad they didn't think so the lord had to open people's eyes yeah you know it's it's it's important to rejoice in the fact when you can actually see that's a gift of god eyes to see eyes to see and many many don't see what's going on they just blindly walk into it i always remem remember that example when when uh i went for once in spain and yeah you know when you eat your meal if it's dim light if you haven't got much light you don't actually exactly see what you eat when you turn the light on and you see the little bugs in the salad on this and the other so let's have light let's not be ignorant about these things let's have the light and say that's i'm not eating this i'm not having this i'm having the real stuff so i just like to read you a few more scriptures and then i'll come to what sort of struck me um well known second timothy 3 1-5 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come perilous for men shall be lovers of their own selves what do you mean lovers of their own selves you know a few years ago you never would have heard of a selfie selfie sticks everywhere it's me here it's me there it's me here at my grandmother's funeral it's me here on you know you never had these instagrams and that nonsense where people have to portray themselves look how could they look being influenced by all the garbage out there lovers of themselves you know i i just uh i'm not on these facebooks and things but i find this every now and then then i see something and i was getting a bit disturbed there was a girl she used to come to church she was brought up a christian but obviously her own ideas and she portrays herself on this facebook or whatever it is or instagram or in such a way which is indecent and they know people from church who knew her put a like on it how can you like phil's how can you identify with ted you should have put a rebuke on it not the like you know what i mean it's so easily done like you know i know it's clothesline religions but it's true you identify you say like and you encourage to filth don't be part either offer the reputation if you never suffer persecution that's when it starts yeah you know if you if you just put likes on the filth you don't suffer persecution you ask for more the next one is even filthier you know and put likes on it lovers of themselves covetous i don't need to explain that one boasters proud bless famous disobedient to parents well that's a new one this why should you obey the parents you know it's not taught anymore unthankful the world is so unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers how many even politicians say things and they don't do it you know truth breakers false accusers fake news incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good now you take somebody that's good and he makes one little mistake or whatever the headlines are full hairlines are full traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god that's a fact too now it's lovers of pleasure what worldly pleasures you don't have to sit home day and night read the bible but you need to have your meditation upon him and and know his priority i remember when i first come to the lord i lived about three hours drive away i didn't get a lot of visitors from home my mother wouldn't come because i didn't have the coffee she liked and my sister wouldn't come because i didn't have a television that she liked a certain program i mean have your priorities right i said well if if your cuff coffee is more important than your television stay home you know don't have to cut but you know that's the sign of the time it's all aurelius and then it says having a form of godliness but denying the power there are from such tune away and that's probably the worst you know they look like some kind of christians or something but deny the power of god you know not oh yes the god can heal but can't he give you the victory over sin can he give you power to live a christian life in this day he can and denying death is denying the power thereof otherwise who shines in this last day if not you and i we are given understandings of the times i think that's wonderful and you know that's a gift god has even given to his children in the past first chronicles 12 32 says and the children of issachar which were men that have understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do we've got that gift i know we live in the last days if you do you have to gift as well understanding the times you see the holy spirit is given to us that's what it is we we know it's the holy spirit that's like he says in luke 24 49 and behold i sent the promise of my father upon you but terry in the city of jerusalem until you be in you with power from on high now i'll tell you one thing when you endured with power from on high you see things in a different light you see it differently you understand you don't have to fear i mean there are many examples in the scripture where people just didn't see and were fearful like uh when when uh what the gehazi or one of them he said alas we are done you know he saw all his army of the assyrians and then the prophet prayed said lord just open his eyes he didn't say send angel he said open his eyes you know are around us and if you can't see it doesn't mean they're not there we're surrounded by angels even this morning i believe the lord's here as well whether we see it or not some people have can see it get a gift or get a glimpse but whether we see it or not it's here so by the holy ghost we know and i like to make a point here you can you know the disciples were believers when god called them even without the holy ghost but not the same kind of believers they recognized christ but they haven't had it in them and you know i i was saying the other day just talking somebody talked about when god spoke to you and you know i've people say well such and such a time when i went to church become a christian that's when god spoke to me or uh or when i came into the message god spoke to me i tell you what god spoke to me when i was in egypt when i was still in the world that's why man of the world he spoke to me right down there said hey that's not your place that's wrong that's wrong he opened my eyes for the truth so he has known you before the foundation of the world and he made a way for you before the foundation of the world the christ that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world it was all in god's program so when did he know you when did he call you when you were still lost in the world you know wonderful so when he called the disciples they were still lost in the world i'll read you just uh an interesting one here in luke uh 9 18-22 and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them whom say the people that i am the answer the ring said john the baptist some say that but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again he said unto them but whom say ye that i am i mean that question is still valid for us today what is christ to you and peter answering the christ of god and he straightly charged him and commanded them to tell no man that thing and you have you ever wondered why he told him not to tell anybody the good news he is the christ because it has to come by revelation not by learning if you learn it it's never the same it's not the same it comes by revelation and then saying here the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day he tells his disciples exactly not not only once it's in in several places he says he even told him exactly he would be scorched and he would be this and would be that the third day he shall rise now have you ever wondered why they weren't lining up at the graveside the third day just to wait for the resurrection because it was so far removed from them that they even didn't believe it the contrary the contrary the women went there with spices to anoint the dead not the living now you see that is something when you know of the lord but you don't know the lord that's what happens but when you know the lord you'd be waiting there that's why we're waiting for the coming of the lord if you know the lord you'll be there third day okay if you are we he's dead now they crucified him you you don't go back to your fishing you go to the gravesite we're waiting we stay here till the third day and he'll come amen you see but they didn't see that and he explained it in detail and that was the word of god and even today people have no trouble to believe in jesus dying for your sins on the cross most people have no trouble with that but a lot of people have trouble to believe in the risen christ who can perform the same thing today as he did then that's where the trouble is you know when we have a problem where we go first call is the or first call is this or what what is it i mean there's nothing wrong with a doctor but you see he is still the same yesterday today and forever and we want to believe in the living christ the one that actually rose from the deed and not believe in the christ who told them all these things something don't believe in the resurrection so to know christ comes by revelation so let's believe the word and expect the power of the living christ i'd like to read a quote here for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic that's quite something isn't it but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and he sit down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes all what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into the kingdom through much tribulation see at the moment anyway in this country we don't suffer physical persecution but you may suffer sometimes you're not selected for certain thing or you're not invited to certain things there's all sorts of things or that people talk funny about you or or laugh about you you know we suffer in other ways but kind of great great glory you know it is something that's ordained you know people don't see that you're a christian you probably don't suffer you just you know go the same way as the world and i'll tell you what it's it's it's good when people come to know you and the first few minutes they ask you you're a christian it's really lovely and if they picked it up i felt felt a little bit ashamed a while ago i was riding my motorbike down the road probably a bit too fast and one of those bikes came along and he gave me the thumbs up he identified me with the bikey that wasn't very good but i'm just making the point you don't suffer persecution that way but if you make a stand for the lord you do now there's another scripture here or a quote what the father's word was he used the father's word to defeat satan without even using his power now here comes a really good one i was made aware of this the other day he defeated satan just by speaking the word no not by anything else not by power not by sending fire down not by any of that just by the word now in proverbs 4 verse 20 to 22 it says my son and obviously daughter as well attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings i just want you to stop here for one second incline thine ear unto my sayings we can incline our ear to many sayings you can incline your ear to what the newspaper says or what this prince or or this politician does or this one does we can incline areas to these things but incline your ears to god's saying now there's a difference one leaves you empty and angry and confused but the other one leaves you glorious let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life and those that find them and health to all their flesh so just inclining your ear to the things of god expose yourself to the word health to your flesh amen without prayer without anything else without just inclining you here and you know um about two years ago when i was a a i was paralyzed in in one foot and had a back injury and you know in the back you have a lot of nerves and things can go wrong and what happened i could not find relief i prayed and lord take this pain away and this and eventually i said lord if if it's meant to go through the doctor i'm be willing whatever you say and yeah you know i had all these various emotional things coming my way but uh what happened i inclined my ear towards the lord and you know cut i cut the story short but i was on the operating table and the doctor said to me if i were you i'll cancel the operation and i cancelled it i rejoiced in christ i was still crippled i was still not well but i rejoiced i inclined my head to the lord and day three or day four i wake up completely healed you know not it wasn't the prayer it wasn't uh that i was super spiritual but it was listening to the lord i've got an i i i paid and oh i what do you call it these little things my ear and and uh i listen to the message and listen to the bible most nights and you know it can't say i'm up the whole night but uh you incline your ear towards things of the lord it helps your bones it's healthy system and it's it's not necessarily the prayer it's not as much as i believe in prayer but it's what scripture says for they are life unto those they find them and health to all their flesh just incline you to the lord let's listen to the things of god and not so much to what they say out there now it's good one more thing here i'd like to see you know we live in such a colorful world at the moment we're exposed to all sorts of things and sometimes you get thoughts which are not really you can say oh they're useless you know they're not christians or that they're wrong bible says cast down evil imagination okay because there comes we are exposed to that who who has ever had a nightmare any one of you you didn't choose to have a nightmare yeah and you know i sometimes pray lord cleanse me from even these dreams and everything you know and but you see amongst all there's some good you can get a spiritual dream you can't even get a spiritual dream amongst nightmares portion of it did you know that visions and dreams are um i think brother brandon explains it this way a vision is basically a dream being awake you know and you always have to test is it of god or is it not of god it's same i may make it an example when you go to the shop and you want to buy bread you're a supermarket everything else is offered to you too good stuff bad stuff a lot of rubbish stuff but you don't have to choose it you don't have to feel guilty seeing it but you choose what is of god and what do you want so the other night i had a few dreams i don't want to go into that too much but a point that stood out to me i was dreaming and i was standing here preaching my heart out crying at people shouting at people and pointing here was a jug of water and there was a glass and i was shouting about this and they said you have to be born again you know it's not just behold this you have to have it in you and i thought that was of the lord you see a jug full of water that there's when you recognize the word of god when you can see it when you can even understand it but it's no part of you until you pour it in the vessel and drink it yourself and that stood out to me so much so i thought look we have the revealed word of god vindicator by prophet the anointed word for the hour and the power to overcome we've been restored to the faith of the fathers according to the word that's all in the jug it's all in the jack here you see the jug is full what about serpent seed it's in a jug it's in the jug the seven church ages he explained it's in a jug the revelation of the seven seals is in the jug yeah no it's not somewhere i have to learn this no it's here in the jug here's the jug and here's the glass you're the glass and i thought you know baptism in the name of lord jesus christ it's in the jug are you recognizing the pure water in the jug the pure word yes so you want to be baptized in the name of lord jesus christ and i believe most of us did you see it's in the jug it's not out wherever it's a mystery it's right there and we be hold it and we can see it we just need to drink it i thought you know about the godhead you know many times uh i mean up into a church when i was young and they always talked about the mystery of the trinity the mystery i thought the church should solve the mystery for you you know christ in you the hope of glory that's a great mystery but you see the mystery of the trinity where do you find that and then when i i can say from a personal experience when i met up with this it was a maori brother outside a pub doing outreach i come out drunk as can be otherwise i would not have felt confident to go and pet him on his back so i didn't say you do a good job out here convert those heathens out here i said to him and and he realized that i had something missing i didn't realize because i couldn't see i said oh i believe in god i'm fine drunk as can be and he said may i pray for you your mind if i pray for you pray for me never heard such a thing pray for somebody i thought if you pray you pray yourself lord give me this help me here do that pray for somebody else never cross my mind he prayed for me and he asked the lord jesus to whatever i can't even remember but things started to happen i was so touched next day i was in a different town and somebody gave me a bible well out of this world you know one after the other i went home so i read the bible and started to get convicted because it was the word of god but one thing struck me and that that was the start of it all we talked about the revelation of jesus christ the godhead i knew the bible says not to have any gods beside him you can't have two gods but god is a spirit and that spirit sent his son and indwelled him and reconciled the world himself so we're not serving a different god but we have to recognize jesus christ who proclaimed the name of god and that struck me before i even had a real holy ghost experience then jesus is god amen i cannot have jesus as a second great person he must be god and that hit me and then i went to this church later on and they talked about the mystery for of the trinity and then and then somebody gave me a pamphlet and here was no man was a be it there's supposed to be god and he was a younger one supposed to be christ and he was a young woman in some funny outfit and there was the holy ghost i mean they couldn't convince me with it anymore you know i was amongst a whole group to them it was all a mystery but to me it was clear and i found scriptures to confirm that's why i so much rejoiced when i heard brother brown preach on it because it hit home of what god already showed me and praise god it's in the jug in the jug it's in the jug to god here divine healing it's in the jug you know i'm not saying you can't get sick i'm not saying things cannot happen to you or or uh you know i know many many good men they died of a disease satan struck them with the disease you know and uh doesn't mean we have eternal life in this flesh you know well uh pray lord restore my ears my eyes my hair uh restore this let me be young again yeah that'll come in in the rapture but if we go through this life and this if the little terrorists all of us so but divine healing is still our portion and that's in the jug it's in the word and you just picture that jack full of the pure word of god full of water and you have to glass there it's great to recognize it's good unless you fill it up and drink it it's great to rejoice when other people drink it and have the glory of god in their lives it's great to rejoice and sympathize but that doesn't heal you that doesn't do anything for you it's got to be you drinking that water now i tell you another one that's in the jug the eagle anointing for this day is in the jug have we heard of that but it's there but we need to have it and what does it do an eagle anointing it gives you eyes to see you fly above everything and you look down and say wow look what it looks like from up there you know every problem every situation you flap your wings and then you look down well there's nothing what's got that you know to do with the power of god and the glory of god and where we're going and what's happening in our lives you see that anointing is in the jug if you haven't experienced it fill your glass fill your glass you know that's really what it is sometimes oh it's for this and this preachers know about this and and he doesn't know and he does this and you know it's for you it's for every believer and i'll tell you another one it's the anointing to see and the anointing to overcome is in this jug as well a very good one is in the jug it's perfect love amen you know you can't love everyone the holy ghost that's the perfect love the holy ghost in you that's in the jug for us to have yeah you know i can't understand why sorry i should say not so you can't understand i do understand why sometimes people have issues you know or don't like this person i don't like that person or see negatives here and there oh because sometimes we are exposed and incline our ear to the wrong things or we haven't died as much as we should and then we get offended have you ever been offended i have lots of brothers oh sorry i don't want to offend you because i'm used to much worse than that so you can't offend me you know people want to apologize but you get rugged you know brother ryan says you want to be like a rugged christian like a not like a hybrid flower something rugged you don't want to be offended and and compromise that love no we don't but we can be offended of course we can if we want to be offended it's easy to offend and then once you're offended you see problems everywhere in everything everything people do whether right or wrong you think the wrong thing about it but perfect love is in that jug so if there's any of that hey repent of it and fill the glass fill the glass you know there's one in filling and many refillings it's wonderful you know what else is in the job the rapture that's in the jug that's what we're looking forward to to go be translated yeah you know when the deadly cries rise i believe we see them but that's not the time to wanting to fill the glass that's too late it's like you know when they shut the door and the rain started oh well it looks like the real thing now it's too late but just imagine you you see somebody you've known that's going on before walking in see brothers it's on whoa you know you're just thinking about you almost take off yeah you know but it's facts that's what i'm waiting for i don't want to be an unconverted disciple who fails to seek the resurrection when jesus rose the third day and moan and complain and be sad and miserable somewhere i want to be there waiting for the day to rise i want to be there to see the living christ even today you see it's so so easy just to behold you know look here's the glass you hold the glass it doesn't quench the thirst to tell you that much but you see behold the jug does not do anything i believe the bible only the king james version that doesn't get you there amen is it in your heart have you got love for your brother who who reads the good news bible you know i've seen people arguing and fussing and and tearing each other to bits just because of that that's right sure i believe it's inspired so i i read the king james bible but sometimes i look up other translations sometimes written in the luther bible and sometimes read in the french bible doesn't mean i'm not part of it you know what i mean let's fill that not just behold the jug but let's be drinking of it so just in closing i'd like to say a couple more things here can you see and recognize the jug full of god's word and power i think most of us can and we have witness i don't know for a while i was listening to prayer lines every night i'll tell you what i got so much out of it i mean you start to hear and see things and you see the power of god revealed whoa that's somebody drank of that wood you know but you know for me sympathizing with it doesn't do it for me when i need it it's not just seeing it it's like yeah that's a pure word that's the word that's the revealed word that's the what does it do for you i know people they jump up and down revealed word and there's so much revelation i said the other day they had they have so much grace in their lives they can do whatever they want you know there's so much grace that they only have judgments for others left you know no more grace but you see then you look at the lives of people whoa miserable i mean i was happy we satisfied this but you don't see the power of god you to have words words words and it's actually true what they say and you look at the joke yes i can't argue with that but hey it's for you you know that's where we miss sometimes you know sympathy is not victory if you sympathise with some great warrior it doesn't make you a warrior he says as little as drinking milk make you a farmer you know it's it's but it's just how people simply perceive things sympathize with a message and sympathize with with a prophet and sympathize with it doesn't make you a powerful walking their power you have to drink the word of god as he serves it to you know that somebody tries to stuff it down your throat as the lord reveals it to you and brings it to you and that will take you there i think it's good to meditate upon these things now question but have you poured it into your glass you know that's the question we have to ask isn't it my glass have i really drunk it you know is it in your vessel have you had a refill lately have you had a refill lately never forget uh many years ago i was so dry in my spiritual life dry i was still single then i just could not get out of it i hated to be so dry i hated to be kind of indifferent you know it didn't really interest me much i hated it i prayed against it and everything and then to top it off i went to a a meeting down south and they had i was listening a meeting you know as bored as can be i hope you're not bored this morning but i was actually like bored it was probably not bad preaching but i didn't feel inspired at all and to top it off they're coming in and footwashing afterwards so it dragged on for quite a while and i was sitting there in the bench you know i said i don't know did i have my my socks off or not but i was sitting there oh bored and not enthused at all and then there was two brothers on you know praying for each other lovely but it didn't really touch me or do anything and then i said oh you know i hated that and despite the way i felt i quietly prayed not enthused just mumbled the prayers i lowered bless those brothers who wash each other's feet and yeah you know like that and you know what happened suddenly i felt the holy ghost so strong like not for months and months or years and he got stronger i thought man they must be up on these brothers you know the reflection of it but no it was on me it pulled me out of my seat i could not help it i went i don't know how high i went i was screaming and shouting and praising god what was it and in feeling inclining your ears to the lord despite how you feel healed he is real and you know he can lift you up just like that and you know when you feel miserable just go it and and and praise god and the less you feel like the more effective it is to tell you that much so have we had an infilling lately you know we are part of god's great vision did you know that and step by step he fulfills what vision he's got for us you know you know i think it's just one of the first messages in the message uh we had this great vision and the lord just showed him step by step he comes to this place now this man will come out the shop and wearing such a cap and do this and he will tell you where to go why could god tell him to begin with where to go you know that's a natural mind but it is he's playing his program step by step so if he showed you a step you go until on where to from here he will show you further but he can't cannot show you further until he made that step he showed you in the first place and sometimes people want to start right without you know without repentance without going through the gospels they want to be right in revelation somewhere and it just doesn't work step by step according to the vision god has for us i don't know if you get it what i mean but it it is even when uh once he he prayed for a child god showed him it'll be healed but he overstepped the vision and the child could worse and then he went and repented and waited until everything was set in place and then the power of god came down and you see it's the same in our lives we've got to be in the place where god wants us to be for the power of god to come down and if you showed us a certain step and we have not made that step you won't get a second instruction from him it's there where the instruction comes it's like that man that came out that the garage he said he will tell you where to go so he had to wait till he saw that man come out the garage go there to get the next instruction and you know that makes life exciting we know the end of course but we get instructions i don't know if you've ever done one of those uh i don't know orientation parkours things oh i don't know what you call it we we had that at school at times what do you call these things yeah so we had to to follow some kind of a map go somewhere and there was a post where they gave the instruction what to do next you know and to one we came that wasn't actually at school but to one we came and there was this cave we found it yeah that's the cave you know and then you go in the cave and there sits a guy and there was a candle he said i'm the light of the world and then take a candle light it now you're the light of the world you know and you have to make sure the candle doesn't go out and find your next place you know but you know you didn't know until you were at that place what the next play is going to be and what the next instruction is we shouldn't go ahead we just want to stay we know we live in exciting times let's just finish with a little quote exciting times here brother bram says oh i'm so glad to know that we are living here in these last days here i believe that we are living in one of the most tremendous times that the world ever has ever known just on the eve of the coming of the lord isn't that wonderful think that most any time now all scriptures just about fulfilled and so we are expecting him at any moment and we should live under those kind of expectations that just any time it can happen be prayed up and ready and look if you need a refilling the jug is full you know it's not mystery to you you just can say lord make that real to me laura i want to want to really embrace it and see it and reveal it to me you know the joke's full the joke's full she reaches pray heavenly father this morning we just uh talked about mixed things but i know that your word is true and you revealed your word and the jug is really full we can't just fill our vessels with it lord i just pray this morning that you just give us a fresh and feeling with your holy
