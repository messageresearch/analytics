[22:24] this in the wonderful name of our lord
[22:26] jesus christ hallelujah amen
[22:29] amen let's give him a hand of applause
[22:33] amen
[22:34] amen do you not think how much we're
[22:36] going to shout when we get to heaven
[22:38] when when this whole pest house is over
[22:41] the plan of redemption is unfolded
[22:43] everything has been wrapped up and we're
[22:45] back in heaven what can happen then
[22:47] i don't think there's enough vocals in
[22:49] this body to contain that we're going to
[22:51] need a body change right musicians god
[22:53] bless you thank you so much let's give
[22:55] them a hand applause
[22:57] hallelujah
[22:59] amen
[23:01] amen i am so nervous
[23:04] praise the lord it's a good place to be
[23:07] hallelujah um
[23:11] i
[23:11] i want to kind of have a disclaimer here
[23:13] tonight if i may
[23:15] um
[23:19] if you ever come to church and you don't
[23:22] come ready for what god's going to give
[23:24] you
[23:25] be careful
[23:26] because when god comes your way and he
[23:28] wants to deal with something he's going
[23:29] to deal with it anyways he's sovereign
[23:31] he's god
[23:32] but if you came to church and you've got
[23:34] a need
[23:35] a real need
[23:37] for deliverance
[23:38] that you really mean business with god
[23:40] you will get what you want
[23:42] but see it starts with the attitude
[23:44] before we even open this word it starts
[23:47] with that attitude
[23:49] and i encourage you whatever i say take
[23:51] it in the attitude between you and god
[23:54] it's not a very heavy service it is
[23:56] actually i don't know which way is going
[23:58] to go but i know there is a burden on my
[24:00] heart to tell you children you as well
[24:02] listen you can only get blessed if
[24:05] you're looking for a blessing amen you
[24:08] can only find riches if you are seeking
[24:10] for riches
[24:11] you can only get something if you really
[24:14] wanted
[24:15] you cannot tell me when germany and
[24:18] brazil was playing in the world cup
[24:19] final the one that won it was the one
[24:21] was oh it's the bounce of the ball it's
[24:24] a round ball it bounces every way the
[24:26] same up down roll this way that way but
[24:29] see the team that wanted it the most on
[24:31] the day is the one that won the game
[24:34] so i know it's not a soccer game this
[24:36] but it's a very simple concept you want
[24:38] to be blessed you want to grow in the
[24:40] lord you need to find that blessing you
[24:42] need to pull don't fall asleep don't get
[24:45] all distracted this is your chance to
[24:47] get your blessing
[24:48] so go and get it
[24:50] amen
[24:52] liam stein god bless you welcome back at
[24:55] church i missed you man it's my own son
[24:57] but he was so sick man same i've never
[24:59] seen
[25:00] him so sick and it's good to have you
[25:02] back my son
[25:03] good to have you back here amen so let's
[25:06] open our bibles
[25:08] i don't i don't preach like any other
[25:10] preachers because i'm not any other
[25:12] preacher i'm your brother so if you
[25:14] think i'm preaching at you you got it
[25:16] wrong we're brothers and sisters we are
[25:17] growing in god so please don't take it
[25:19] as a preaching
[25:22] if you can put that slideshow up
[25:24] i really want to ask you one question
[25:26] tonight
[25:27] has the light
[25:29] struck the lens
[25:31] so all i'm going to ask you you think of
[25:33] these words every slide we go into i
[25:35] remind you has the light struck the
[25:37] links
[25:39] and if you can honestly answer that
[25:41] question tonight you will know where you
[25:42] stand with god
[25:44] because there comes a time in a
[25:45] believer's life where you have to have
[25:48] have to have experience with god
[25:51] and if you haven't had that experience
[25:54] seek it amen with everything in you
[25:57] because you will never really see the
[25:59] true light of the gospel if you haven't
[26:01] had the experience with god
[26:04] and i will prove it by the scriptures
[26:05] tonight lord willing if he allows me to
[26:09] so our very first slide we're going to
[26:10] go to
[26:12] is we're going to go to
[26:15] the book of john john 8 1-12
[26:18] so it might be a little bit mixed up do
[26:21] forgive me if it is but i know the lord
[26:22] will tie it all together
[26:28] so we we get here on a scene
[26:31] and we did open in a word of prayer i
[26:33] did yeah we did um
[26:36] jesus went here to the mount of olives
[26:39] and early in the morning he came again
[26:41] into the temple
[26:42] and all the people came unto him and he
[26:44] sat down and he taught them
[26:47] and the scribes and the pharisees
[26:48] brought unto him a woman taken in
[26:50] adultery
[26:52] when they had said her in the midst
[26:55] they say unto him master this woman was
[26:58] taken in adultery
[27:00] in the very act
[27:04] guilty
[27:06] beyond reason
[27:08] with witnesses
[27:09] in the very act
[27:12] now moses in the law command us that
[27:15] and that that such should be um stoned
[27:18] but what say is thou now look here
[27:22] this they said tempting him that they
[27:25] might have accused to i have to accuse
[27:27] him
[27:30] so the whole motive about this whole
[27:32] scene they don't care about the sister
[27:34] on the ground
[27:36] they don't care about the act that she
[27:38] committed they don't even care about the
[27:40] law of moses all they want is to see how
[27:44] they can trick him into saying something
[27:47] that is contrary to them so they can
[27:49] crucify him or stone him that's all
[27:51] their motive is about
[27:54] the only reason they come to church is
[27:56] to find fault with the message the only
[27:58] reason they they walk around you is to
[28:00] find an excuse to get a way off these
[28:02] guys did not want god in their life they
[28:05] did not seek god with all their heart
[28:07] all they really wanted was the excuse
[28:11] it's all they wanted the very god
[28:13] himself in flesh standing by them and
[28:16] all these people want is an excuse
[28:19] sad place to be
[28:21] very dangerous place to be but a sad
[28:24] place to be
[28:26] yet they find them there
[28:29] now we continue with that
[28:33] he says
[28:35] um but jesus
[28:37] stooped down
[28:39] came out of heaven
[28:41] came down to us just see the type here
[28:44] and with the finger he wrote on the
[28:45] ground
[28:47] as he didn't hear them as though he
[28:49] never hurt them
[28:51] amen
[28:52] lest you stop there you can all have
[28:54] your seats may the lord bless his word
[28:55] tonight now i do get excited when i when
[28:58] i share these things because i feel
[29:00] there is an emotion connected to
[29:01] everything that god
[29:03] shows me so i've i've experienced more
[29:07] here in this little sermon in my life in
[29:09] a long time because god actually spoke
[29:11] to me about it so if this is not for you
[29:13] this was for me
[29:14] okay
[29:15] it's a good it's a timely reminder for
[29:16] me
[29:18] so if we go to that next slide
[29:21] it says now here
[29:23] so when they continued asking him he
[29:25] lifted up himself and said unto them
[29:28] he that is without sin among you
[29:31] let him first cast a stone at her
[29:35] because he knew the intention of the
[29:37] heart so he says if you want to excuse
[29:40] there's enough excuses but i want to ask
[29:42] you something
[29:44] are you without fault
[29:47] are you without blemish do you not need
[29:49] a redeemer do you not need christ
[29:53] are you so high and mighty and you
[29:54] forgot where you came from
[29:56] because all of us has a testimony
[29:59] all of us had a time with god had to get
[30:01] us
[30:02] off our knees
[30:03] when we were groveling so far in sin we
[30:05] couldn't even see the light of day
[30:08] so don't forget that brother sisters
[30:10] don't forget where you come from because
[30:12] we cannot introduce christ to no one if
[30:14] we forgot where our testimony got us
[30:16] from sister vanessa i look at you now
[30:18] but i've never ever when she told me a
[30:20] testimony i would never ever say that
[30:22] was sister vanessa but if you never
[30:24] shared the testimony i couldn't know
[30:26] where she came from i couldn't know the
[30:28] type of person she was so i can't see
[30:30] how god worked in her life because if i
[30:32] look at the sister vanessa of now and i
[30:34] look at the sister vanessa i heard in
[30:35] the testimony they are worlds apart
[30:39] and yet they're still growing in christ
[30:41] so so no matter how small your your your
[30:44] testimony is god has still done
[30:47] something in your life do not not
[30:48] testify i'm getting ahead of myself okay
[30:50] [Laughter]
[30:53] amen
[30:56] now jesus here comes the beautiful part
[30:58] and i'll tell you what scripture i think
[31:00] according to brother man so it's not
[31:01] according to the prophet or the message
[31:04] or the it's something i read between the
[31:06] lines so if it's not for you just throw
[31:07] it away this is my blessing
[31:10] he says
[31:11] and they which heard it being convicted
[31:14] in their heart
[31:16] in their own conscience went out one by
[31:18] one beginning at the eldest
[31:21] this is eldest the most established
[31:24] mature christians in the church
[31:27] even unto the least
[31:29] and jesus was left alone
[31:31] but see when he stooped down again and
[31:33] he wrote on the ground i believe he
[31:35] wrote the scripture sister can you put
[31:37] that up for us two
[31:38] uh
[31:39] chronicles 6 and verse 36
[31:42] brother ben said that last weekend or
[31:45] sunday and when i when i saw the
[31:47] scripture it opened up something for me
[31:50] so praise the lord amen it says
[31:53] oh i'll just read it don't worry i'll
[31:54] just read it it says if they sin against
[31:57] thee
[31:58] for there is no man which sinneth not
[32:03] and thou be angry with them now look
[32:05] look the the the pharisees knew what
[32:08] they were doing
[32:10] they said so this is just like the devil
[32:11] is they didn't know if he was god but
[32:13] they knew he was god but they didn't
[32:14] know it was god but they knew he was god
[32:16] because he was doing miracles god was
[32:18] with him things were happening so so
[32:20] they didn't know if they were actually
[32:21] challenging god or were challenging man
[32:23] so they were uncertain the devil i don't
[32:25] know if they'll be the son of god if
[32:27] they'll not be if thou if they'll not be
[32:29] the whole time in two minds they're not
[32:31] steadfast going in a direction they're
[32:33] always if not if not they're trying to
[32:35] to like you know like fencing is it you
[32:37] is it not is it you is it not and that's
[32:39] what they're busy doing here so they
[32:41] know they basically either tempting god
[32:43] going against the scripture of the
[32:45] messiah that has to come or actually
[32:47] this man is wrong
[32:49] but because they weren't sure and they
[32:51] didn't seek the scriptures now they
[32:53] they've got a little bit of fear and
[32:55] this scripture says they that sin
[32:56] against thee for there is no man that
[32:58] does that which sinneth not
[33:01] and thou be angry with him
[33:03] so they know if they get this wrong
[33:06] the motive behind this lady's life if
[33:08] they get that wrong god's going to sort
[33:10] them out and the consequence of that is
[33:13] and deliver them over before their
[33:15] enemies and they will carry them away
[33:17] captives onto a land far or near
[33:20] so they know that if we get this wrong
[33:22] there's going to be a penalty because by
[33:24] moses law and your commandments and
[33:27] everything you taught us in the old
[33:28] testament not new testament if we get
[33:30] this wrong god's going to be against us
[33:33] and that's why jesus would have written
[33:35] he that has no sin let him cast the
[33:38] first stone because i think while he was
[33:40] writing this because he stood up and
[33:42] they were still busy and then he went
[33:44] back down and he wrote the rest of it i
[33:46] think the first part for me is he was
[33:47] writing hey you you have sin as well but
[33:50] remember if you go past this line you
[33:53] get judgment
[33:54] because he's still god
[33:56] sovereign
[33:58] mighty god
[34:00] you ask the old testament saints if he
[34:02] is if he's a hard god
[34:05] huh
[34:06] have you ever thought about it korra
[34:08] dayton
[34:10] asked him
[34:12] oh samson what type of god do we serve
[34:15] a fluffy fluffy god that's just got love
[34:18] no seriously because sometimes with the
[34:21] new testament we're so much into grace
[34:23] and so much into mercy that we forget
[34:25] there is also a law
[34:27] there is also a word of god and we have
[34:29] to believe it all i'm so off my notes
[34:32] but praise the lord there is still there
[34:34] is still you reap what you sow
[34:36] so you can't just you can't just walk on
[34:39] we angels fear to to go we we we ran we
[34:43] run we angels fear to go
[34:45] because sometimes we don't understand
[34:47] that we're still serving a mighty god a
[34:49] sovereign god a deity a force that we do
[34:52] not understand sometimes
[34:56] but
[34:57] we'll go on with the sermon because i
[34:59] left my notes but they didn't know that
[35:01] it was the messiah or not
[35:03] so the pharisees were playing with fire
[35:05] and they knew that there was a response
[35:07] to that fire and when a holy fire falls
[35:10] it consumes
[35:13] it consumes anything that's not of god
[35:15] will be burned in that fire
[35:18] amen
[35:21] if we can don't worry i'll go there can
[35:23] you put me back on that slide i'll go
[35:25] there it's fine
[35:28] okay praise the lord
[35:33] and
[35:34] she said no man lord so she's looking
[35:37] around her now
[35:38] and all her accusers are gone they want
[35:40] to take away from the story but there's
[35:42] many of them jesus said to uh neither do
[35:44] i condemn thee go and sin no more
[35:48] instruction
[35:50] you found grace
[35:52] you found mercy
[35:54] but don't do it anyway just don't do it
[35:56] again
[35:58] he didn't preach to her hour he didn't
[36:00] try to explain the gospels to her he
[36:02] wasn't trying to show her where in the
[36:04] bible was what were written in moses law
[36:06] he just said don't go and sin no more
[36:09] simple instruction
[36:11] if you really repent and you're really
[36:12] sorry don't do it again amen
[36:15] because you can't accept you can't
[36:17] accept god's grace and his mercy and
[36:19] then go and do it again and accept god's
[36:21] grace and mercy and do it again and keep
[36:23] with the cycle of sin because you
[36:25] haven't accepted it there it hasn't
[36:27] become a moment where the light struck
[36:29] the land it hasn't become a moment where
[36:30] god said to you i'm dealing with that
[36:33] you need to let it go
[36:35] those moments are the moments where it
[36:37] is fire inside your bones those moments
[36:40] is when your tummy goes like this and
[36:41] you know i need to get either tell the
[36:44] truth here sorry mom dad i broke the
[36:46] window or whatever there's those moments
[36:48] where god is actually saying you cannot
[36:49] lie i don't like it
[36:52] and you have to go and cough it up and
[36:54] you have to confess that there's a
[36:55] moment for each one like that and you
[36:57] know when that moment is but you've got
[36:59] two choices as always you can either
[37:01] heed to the word of god
[37:04] or you can keep quiet
[37:07] but you make your choices and you know
[37:09] what if you keep quiet you'll just go
[37:11] around the mountain another time
[37:14] if you get quiet you'll go around the
[37:15] mountain another time because when god
[37:17] is speaking to you and trying to get
[37:18] your attention he's trying to tell you
[37:20] something he's trying to to to correct
[37:22] something
[37:23] get it out of you so brother paul said
[37:25] very beautifully he said why would this
[37:28] sovereign god thank you brother
[37:31] come from heaven
[37:34] get
[37:35] mutilated basically if you think how
[37:38] they stripe this back if you think the
[37:40] suffering if you think the lies they
[37:42] falsely excused him they they were
[37:44] trying out to kill him he had no place
[37:46] to sleep he didn't even have his own
[37:48] clothes man like he grew up and he just
[37:50] had to be happy with everything he got
[37:52] he had no wife he didn't have a right to
[37:54] a wife he didn't have a right to have
[37:56] friends and go out and do what you guys
[37:58] do today he was subjected to the word of
[38:01] god fully
[38:02] for you
[38:05] what type of people ought we to be
[38:08] what type of people are we to be when
[38:10] god takes the time steps from his throne
[38:13] of glory sovereign mighty god comes down
[38:16] to this earth goes through all of that
[38:18] just to go
[38:21] sorry
[38:26] think about the
[38:27] we should be shaken sometimes and think
[38:29] that we we think that this gospel it's
[38:31] not a game it's not a game it's a for
[38:34] real life
[38:36] brother david you're good don't worry
[38:38] it's a for real life moment on this
[38:40] earth where you have a chance to
[38:42] represent the kingdom of god
[38:45] it's a real-time year where you need to
[38:47] be sober you only have this space in
[38:49] eternity
[38:50] that you have here to to glorify our god
[39:00] i'm not off my notes this one is right
[39:02] on my nose
[39:04] so i want to ask
[39:05] has the light really struck the lens
[39:10] has the light really struck the leaves
[39:12] this sister found herself dragged at the
[39:15] feet of christ standing there in the
[39:17] midst
[39:18] instead
[39:20] of dragging people before god
[39:23] why don't we pray for them
[39:27] see because the attitude towards your
[39:29] brother or your sister
[39:31] you know
[39:32] that is so wrong and just not walking
[39:34] with god and you know they're never
[39:35] going to get it right though and it's
[39:37] not mixed up they won't make it and i
[39:40] can see nothing happens in that house
[39:41] and this one is not praying nothing this
[39:43] one's making too much noise and that
[39:45] where are you looking
[39:48] where's your focus
[39:51] where is your focus if you look at all
[39:53] these other things where actually is
[39:54] your focus are you so worried about your
[39:57] brother you're missing what the you're
[39:58] looking at the scene wrong you're
[40:00] looking at the scene and not the unseen
[40:03] it's easy to state the obvious it's easy
[40:06] to say hey he got it wrong
[40:09] it's hard to say hey you got it wrong
[40:12] but you know what god's busy doing a
[40:13] mighty work in his life
[40:16] and you know what it's even harder to
[40:17] say god's doing a mighty work in his
[40:19] life i will pray for that brother it's
[40:22] hard because human possibly we always
[40:24] want to be right
[40:26] we always want to be right
[40:28] so a true believer will not drag someone
[40:31] like the pharisees before god a true
[40:33] believer will pray for someone will
[40:35] sincerely go on his knees and say lord i
[40:37] don't stand up here until i understand
[40:39] brother armand
[40:41] i will not stand up here until i can
[40:43] figure that man out because lord i don't
[40:45] want to feel like this
[40:48] i don't want satan to steal my joy i
[40:50] don't want to come and sit in church and
[40:51] fall asleep
[40:53] i'm about to close would that help
[40:56] come on guys we haven't even started yet
[40:58] man
[41:01] it depends on your attitude
[41:06] here's another example
[41:11] i just can read it the woman saith unto
[41:13] him
[41:14] i know that when messiah cometh
[41:16] which is called christ when he has come
[41:19] he will tell us all these things who can
[41:21] tell me little children who can tell me
[41:23] what story is this about raise your hand
[41:25] let's see if i can pick someone
[41:30] daniel
[41:31] what is the story about no he's gone
[41:34] jonathan
[41:36] woman at the well
[41:39] oh kind of gave it away
[41:40] [Laughter]
[41:43] okay so who can tell me what did jesus
[41:45] tell her
[41:47] what did jesus tell her before she got
[41:49] to this place we see i know if when
[41:51] messiah come with you tell us these
[41:52] things what did jesus tell her liam
[41:59] he asked her that as well yes but he
[42:00] said something else that got her
[42:02] attention momo
[42:05] what was she doing
[42:10] she had five husbands and the sixth one
[42:12] she was with
[42:13] wasn't a husband
[42:15] now think about it what if a guy comes
[42:17] your way tomorrow let's let's let's just
[42:19] go a little bit carnal let's go one
[42:20] level down i like into you kids let's
[42:23] say there's a brother coming tomorrow
[42:25] and he says to you abe can i use this
[42:27] example
[42:28] you didn't do it so but i'm just going
[42:30] to blame you anyways he comes and says
[42:31] abe
[42:32] you took a ball that was lying next to
[42:34] the street at the number 104 of that
[42:36] gate
[42:37] the person saw you but what you chose to
[42:40] do is hide it under your vest and you
[42:41] took it home
[42:43] says but that's not all then you kicked
[42:44] out the window and blamed it on someone
[42:47] else like jesse because jesse always
[42:49] kicks the ball jesse wasn't there to
[42:51] defend himself so he got in trouble you
[42:53] didn't know that but he actually got a
[42:54] big box law
[42:56] then the next day you go to your dad and
[42:59] your dad goes hey guess what i gave
[43:01] jesse yesterday pakslaw for kicking out
[43:02] that window remember you told me about
[43:05] he says and then the lady from one two
[43:06] four came down the road and said hey
[43:08] that ball is actually mine so i thought
[43:10] it was jesus so i gave him another box
[43:11] law
[43:12] but this guy just came to you and said
[43:14] exactly what happened yesterday and he
[43:15] wasn't even there
[43:17] would it get your attention
[43:19] would it
[43:21] he just told you what you've done
[43:24] you know for a fact there's no way
[43:26] somebody knew it because you hit it and
[43:28] you went away he doesn't even know jesus
[43:29] he doesn't even know who's your dad but
[43:31] he comes to you and says you've just
[43:32] done that yesterday now you tell me what
[43:34] is the supernatural about that
[43:39] everything
[43:40] because he's not supposed to know this
[43:42] so now i want to ask you here's a prayer
[43:44] line going
[43:46] oh
[43:46] did i
[43:48] thank you brother
[43:50] he has a prayer line going
[43:52] and the prophet stands before someone
[43:55] i want to ask you this
[43:56] i want you to think soberly now
[43:59] come come and approach god the way he
[44:00] needs to be approached
[44:02] there's a man standing in front of a
[44:04] lady telling a lady
[44:06] you have a blood issue but if i can help
[44:08] you what i'm going to do is going to
[44:09] tell you where you come from
[44:12] and then i'm going to tell you who you
[44:14] are and then i'm going to tell you what
[44:15] the doctor said is going to happen to
[44:17] you and then i'm going to tell you what
[44:18] god's going to do for you
[44:20] today then you listen to that voice
[44:23] respond back to what's been said and you
[44:27] tell me if that's not god
[44:30] you can fake it only for that many times
[44:32] how many sermons that this prophet had
[44:34] how many times did have to god prove him
[44:36] over and over and over again how many
[44:39] times did he go back to the congregation
[44:41] and says if anything is contrary what
[44:43] that word said tonight
[44:46] then i'm a false witness then you come
[44:48] and tell me
[44:49] but if it is god if it is the truth you
[44:52] follow him not me him
[44:55] he always pointed people back into the
[44:57] word he always pointed back people
[44:59] towards christ he never took the glory
[45:01] for it never not one sermon i've
[45:03] listened i had a worked with brother
[45:05] andy and them for a year the lord
[45:06] blessed me to work for them for the year
[45:08] and for a year i was eating every sermon
[45:10] you could think of
[45:12] of brother branham
[45:14] sorry gloves are off i think this is a
[45:15] message shirts we might as well preach
[45:17] the truth i ate every sermon
[45:20] and i've seen the websites out there
[45:23] believe the sign all these things let me
[45:25] tell you that if you base your salvation
[45:28] on a website shame on you
[45:31] if you base your salvation on any
[45:33] preacher that preaches to you shame on
[45:35] you
[45:35] because if you cannot find what is
[45:37] preaching back in this word in this word
[45:40] leave it alone but if it is this
[45:44] you better follow it
[45:46] you better follow it
[45:49] because i'm going to prove by these
[45:50] couple of examples the people that
[45:52] weren't looking back in the word is the
[45:53] one that mr messiah because this lady
[45:56] wasn't a pharisee
[45:58] she wasn't a trained scholar
[46:01] but yet she had the gumption to know
[46:03] that if this man could tell me what i've
[46:05] done in the secret parts of my heart
[46:08] isn't that the very messiah
[46:12] and what did she do he says what seekers
[46:14] thou he says i am he says and
[46:18] marveled and talked with a woman and the
[46:20] disciples come back and they don't talk
[46:21] to him because they knew he talked to
[46:23] the woman then the woman left her water
[46:26] pot and went into the city and saved to
[46:28] the men shame on her she has to run into
[46:31] the city to go tell the men there's a
[46:32] prophet a mighty prophet here that's
[46:34] busy telling the word of god
[46:36] where was that mean
[46:38] but see jesus needed to go there
[46:40] she says come and see which told me all
[46:43] things that i ever did
[46:46] so there's something that happened here
[46:48] this event where the light struck her
[46:50] heart and she knew this is more than a
[46:52] man speaking this is a doctrine he
[46:54] wasn't trying to convince her by the
[46:56] scriptures he wasn't trying to pull some
[46:58] mysteries out of her he wasn't trying to
[47:00] say this is what david did and he just
[47:02] spoke straight onto her into a heart
[47:04] saying sister
[47:05] brother god is trying to get your
[47:07] attention are you actually listening
[47:09] what is your what is your heart towards
[47:12] what he's gonna give you how are you
[47:14] gonna receive it are you just gonna put
[47:16] up a shield
[47:17] and block it or can you take it and go
[47:19] back to your word and go find the truth
[47:24] because if it's not in here don't follow
[47:26] it that's my advice
[47:29] again
[47:31] prophet of god picks it up here
[47:33] and he says because you see jesus said
[47:36] this is in sirs
[47:37] would we see jesus i'm just going to
[47:39] analyze this a bit he says
[47:41] no man can come to me except the father
[47:43] draws him
[47:45] and all that the father has given me
[47:47] will come to me amen
[47:49] and he said that did he not congregation
[47:52] says aiming in the sermon what was it
[47:54] there was there is what the bible said
[47:56] in hebrews and any corrects themselves
[47:58] in the book of revelation in the last
[48:00] day there will be the antichrist it will
[48:02] rise up on the scene so close like the
[48:05] real thing it will deceive the very
[48:07] elected if possible it means in the lady
[48:10] you see a church age when he sends this
[48:13] messenger to come and warn us and to to
[48:15] to gather all the mysteries of god
[48:18] the two spirits the antichrist spirit
[48:20] and god's spirit would be so close that
[48:23] it was deceived a very elected if
[48:24] possible now if you can answer me this
[48:26] question you know where i'm going
[48:28] where would the elect find the truth
[48:38] here
[48:40] but they won't find it
[48:42] here
[48:45] and they won't find it
[48:47] here
[48:48] they would find it here
[48:51] all of it
[48:52] eat the book the whole book
[48:55] because it's sweet in your mouth and bit
[48:57] in your belly why would it be bitter in
[48:58] your belly because sometimes you need to
[49:00] do things that not feeling good
[49:03] that's contrary to what you believe in
[49:05] or was raised in or was taught in
[49:07] something that's so far out that i would
[49:09] one day go and tell my wife all the
[49:12] deepest darkest secrets i've ever done
[49:14] because god said and confirmed that i
[49:16] had to do it my marriage was on the line
[49:19] i'll testify a little bit of it i wasn't
[49:21] i wasn't going to get divorced but it
[49:23] was at such a point that what i was
[49:25] going to say and tell my wife could
[49:27] break and make our marriage
[49:30] but see god sent the first service and
[49:32] there was a preacher and he preached to
[49:33] me and he said you better get clean with
[49:35] this
[49:37] then the next brother danny white came
[49:39] and he preached and he says the devil
[49:40] has one right punch and he's allowed to
[49:42] use it you all know some of some of you
[49:44] know this testimony i thought i'll share
[49:45] it and then i said to him the first of
[49:47] us has said lord you should hear this i
[49:49] said lord
[49:50] just like gabriel i'm going to put this
[49:52] fleece outside let the ground be dry in
[49:54] the fleece and the fleece wet i'll know
[49:56] it's you
[49:58] so he sends me the next preacher he says
[50:00] you better come clean with the sin you
[50:02] better tell her
[50:03] because now he's stealing in my heart he
[50:05] didn't say it over the pope but the
[50:06] preacher didn't go to me and say hey
[50:08] brother armand this is now time you're
[50:10] gonna david you're gonna now confess all
[50:11] your sins
[50:12] he was preaching at all of us
[50:15] but the light struck the lengths it came
[50:18] to my ears and into my heart and now god
[50:21] started dealing and i was not feeling
[50:23] comfortable in that service i was really
[50:26] uncomfortable i said if you would ask me
[50:28] a question then i'm happy and that
[50:29] service i would have had you should have
[50:31] seen my face i'm sure the devil and god
[50:34] both were looking at me going
[50:35] something's going on here god knew the
[50:37] devil was wondering because he was
[50:39] trying to to get all this dress all this
[50:42] this this unbelief all this filthy sin
[50:44] out of me so that he can clean me
[50:46] because you can't put clean water in a
[50:48] dirty vessel and have clean water come
[50:50] out you can't impossible
[50:53] so sorry i get excited and i shout
[50:56] um
[50:58] yeah i'm going to my wife reminding me
[51:00] gideon so
[51:01] we went to the second service and he
[51:03] says about this right punch so of course
[51:05] me
[51:06] i pray i say lord
[51:08] i'm in turmoil because i know what i'm
[51:10] about to share
[51:12] it's heavy so i said lord you know what
[51:14] i love my wife
[51:16] and i know you love my wife because we
[51:18] were at a stage in our walk where we
[51:20] shantell was having a real revival with
[51:22] the lord and she was real close and she
[51:24] was feeding off the word and she was
[51:25] just happy
[51:26] now why would i want to spoil that and
[51:29] satan you know what he says to me
[51:31] he says to me in the first service he
[51:32] says you
[51:33] you can just keep quiet because you
[51:35] don't want to hurt your wife's feelings
[51:37] she doesn't need to know this because
[51:39] remember you put it under the blood
[51:42] but did i
[51:45] did i put it under the blood saying oh
[51:47] lord jesus forgive me have i actually
[51:49] placed it under the blood
[51:51] because the sin is still lying there the
[51:53] accuser still has the card that he can
[51:55] play so he's got all the cards in his
[51:57] hand he can still play them i still have
[51:59] the sin
[52:00] it's not under the blood because it's
[52:02] not confessed it's not brought to the
[52:04] surface it's not god forgive me for what
[52:06] i've done it's still there and the
[52:08] brother preaches on it
[52:10] and i go back to him and say okay lord
[52:12] again
[52:13] gideon took this fleece
[52:15] i said i would tell my wife but i need
[52:17] you to tell me you got my back i promise
[52:20] this is how i talk to god because i
[52:22] think you should be real when you talk
[52:23] to god don't try to go oh holy god oh
[52:25] great and try to just talk to him really
[52:28] talk to him
[52:29] say lord i don't want to lose my wife
[52:32] i love her
[52:33] i love you how's this going to plan out
[52:36] i don't know
[52:37] but i'm going to ask you i'm going to
[52:38] put this fleece out again let the grout
[52:40] be dry and let the fleece be wet now
[52:42] because i need to know that this is you
[52:44] because if it's not you and i do it and
[52:46] it's out of your season there will be
[52:48] consequences
[52:51] all right so service is up i'm in
[52:52] turmoil but i just start really getting
[52:54] over us because i see lunch and i'm
[52:56] feeling really good and i think a real
[52:57] real good christian loves food you know
[52:59] because it's just so good with
[53:01] fellowship
[53:03] and i'll demonstrate this i hope the
[53:05] cameraman can follow me
[53:07] and i go sit on the chair
[53:09] they're in the service and i sit there
[53:11] after service
[53:12] or relaxing because god was dealing with
[53:14] me but i'm gonna eat now i'm now happy
[53:16] because
[53:18] i'm out of church
[53:20] believe it or not that's what i thought
[53:22] and guess who comes strolling my way
[53:25] brother gideon milan
[53:28] now remember what i asked him in the
[53:29] service and brother gideon lord knows
[53:32] it's a testimony brother please confirm
[53:34] it one day with all these lovely saints
[53:36] they can see the wonderful work of god
[53:38] and brother gideon comes and he shakes
[53:40] my hand and he says hey brother how are
[53:42] you doing i said good good i don't i
[53:43] forgot his name is gideon because i
[53:45] forget her name the moment i turn my
[53:46] back pretty much says it's a gift not
[53:49] everybody can do it okay
[53:51] but i can and he's and he says can i
[53:54] tell you my testimony and everything
[53:56] inside me right then went nope nope nope
[53:59] no no no no no no no no but my mouth
[54:02] went yes brother please
[54:06] but i promise you inside me it went no
[54:11] that's what my inside went and i thought
[54:13] oh this guy's a preacher boy he's just
[54:15] gonna preach the whole time and this is
[54:16] what's going on in my head split seconds
[54:18] come on this is thoughts and he just
[54:20] goes can i share my testimony and my
[54:22] lips man
[54:24] brother andy you should know this by now
[54:26] my lips man they give me away and my
[54:28] lips goes
[54:29] yes
[54:32] slow motion and i'm thinking
[54:34] what have i done
[54:38] and he comes and sits next to me
[54:40] and he starts sharing his testimony
[54:43] and it's everything that i'm busy with
[54:47] everything i'm hiding
[54:49] everything that's between me and my wife
[54:50] that's unforgiven sin
[54:53] everything that the devil still has and
[54:56] he pops up and he walks away real nice
[54:58] and friendly
[54:59] and i'm shattered
[55:01] because what
[55:03] the light struck the limbs
[55:06] he's put light on sin
[55:08] so bright that there's no spotlight that
[55:11] could there's no way sin can hide now it
[55:13] is a a hundred billion trillion candle
[55:17] light light flaming fire light onsen
[55:20] saying you better tell her oh yeah so i
[55:22] walk outside
[55:24] and i go okay lord
[55:26] i'm gonna tell her
[55:29] i said but i want just one thing just
[55:31] man we can bargain with god sometimes eh
[55:33] yes how does he have so much patience
[55:35] with us
[55:36] man i would have just slapped me three
[55:38] times already but he said he said i said
[55:40] to him lord i will tell my wife
[55:43] but i will only start talking to her
[55:46] when my children sleep i've got four
[55:48] hours to drive back
[55:50] will be the longest four hours of my
[55:52] life
[55:53] but the moment the kids fall asleep now
[55:55] i'm hoping they last for four hours
[55:56] because man i don't really want to do
[55:58] this i rather want the perfect setting
[56:00] at the perfect place where i can have my
[56:03] wife at the perfect time to perfectly
[56:05] break her heart
[56:07] okay this is what i want this is what
[56:09] human wants or i can just do what god
[56:11] tells me to do and i do it and i said so
[56:14] if the kids fall asleep
[56:16] i'll start talking god the moment they
[56:18] fall asleep i will start talking
[56:21] how quickly did they fall asleep love
[56:24] first round about a stratford man
[56:27] church is here roundabout is there they
[56:30] both blop gone
[56:32] i look in the mirror i look in the
[56:33] mirror i'm like oh dear i'm so far off
[56:35] my nose but praise the lord there's a
[56:37] reason for this
[56:39] so now stuff got real and for the next
[56:41] four hours
[56:43] i break my wife's heart
[56:45] i break the way she looks at me
[56:48] i break the way that i told her i was
[56:50] all confidence everything she had in me
[56:53] i destroy
[56:55] but i want to tell you one thing
[56:57] you know who had the battle
[57:00] he
[57:01] because he said to me do it
[57:04] so that means when he says to you show
[57:06] up to the battle he already has the
[57:08] expected end you don't need to worry how
[57:11] it's going to pan out that's not your
[57:13] job
[57:14] just show up and do what he tells you to
[57:16] do
[57:17] just do it
[57:19] is it is it really that hard
[57:21] if he's got the battle and he's got your
[57:23] victory and he says do it is it that
[57:25] hard not to do it
[57:28] see brother branham says you have to
[57:29] fight your way to hell god gives us
[57:31] enough chances to go over and over again
[57:34] come back to him
[57:36] you have to fight your way to hell
[57:42] i'm so far off my computer switch off
[57:44] here we go
[57:45] amen
[57:46] amen
[57:47] so basically what he says here
[57:49] in the book of revelation a revolution
[57:51] after revolution revelation revolution
[57:53] as well it revoluted my life um i think
[57:57] i'm still in the revolution i'm fighting
[57:58] against the the enemy he says he said
[58:01] fool the very elected of possible
[58:03] he delivered all upon the earth whose
[58:05] names were written not in the lamb's
[58:07] book of life
[58:10] so your book is already written
[58:11] somewhere
[58:12] god already knows how your life's going
[58:14] to go
[58:15] the only one to kick against the god
[58:17] the god plans plan of god is you
[58:21] not the devil
[58:22] the devil just gives you a run around
[58:24] the only one to kick against the word
[58:26] and the plan of god is you
[58:28] you could just get yourself out of the
[58:30] way i'll go over
[58:31] next slide
[58:33] he says here and this is where i want to
[58:35] concentrate on
[58:38] and what was she she was one that had a
[58:40] name there that woman at the well
[58:43] no matter what kind of state she was in
[58:45] didn't care
[58:47] didn't care what was going to happen
[58:49] it's not part of the conversation i
[58:51] don't care what state you in child i've
[58:53] got a plan for you are you willing to
[58:55] surrender to my plan
[58:56] i don't care how far you've gone in sin
[58:58] or how far you've gone out of unbelief
[59:01] i've got a plan for you can you follow
[59:03] my plan that's all god's asking he
[59:05] doesn't ask much
[59:07] he says
[59:09] um a little light struck the little
[59:10] prostitute she recognized it why there
[59:13] was something in to spark it off so
[59:16] there was something in you already to
[59:18] know that when god starts dealing with
[59:19] you
[59:21] it's god
[59:22] you cannot tell me when god is dealing
[59:24] with you you don't know
[59:27] i shouldn't be doing this
[59:29] he's dealing with you
[59:31] and it will only he says and you she
[59:33] recognized it you might pour water in
[59:35] gasoline it will only hinder it but let
[59:38] a little fire hit at one time and watch
[59:40] what happens you see it takes a sparking
[59:43] of faith of the word of god
[59:46] then you'll know
[59:47] um it's true there there was something
[59:50] will happen so
[59:53] this sister
[59:55] she she spoke to jesus woman at the well
[59:58] and and he said to her you know your
[59:59] husband's all those things so what did
[1:00:00] she do she run she got a sparks you run
[1:00:02] into samaria and she went and preached
[1:00:05] the gospel to them not preach it but
[1:00:07] share the testimony okay
[1:00:09] okay amen here we go
[1:00:11] now here's our next one we've got
[1:00:12] another 50 slides so don't worry we're
[1:00:13] about we're about to close it gets
[1:00:15] better now moses oh mr moses
[1:00:19] so what i want to talk to you about here
[1:00:20] is
[1:00:23] moses
[1:00:25] stephen spoke about this very
[1:00:28] very event
[1:00:30] before he got stoned
[1:00:33] and then he ticked off the pharisees
[1:00:34] because he says you
[1:00:36] you god is the tomb of the prophets but
[1:00:38] you put them all there and when he said
[1:00:40] that they got angry they just wanted to
[1:00:42] stone him they dragged him out to sydney
[1:00:43] and stone him but what he did he said
[1:00:45] something here and it will go to acts
[1:00:47] 7 now we'll go there where they stone
[1:00:49] him verse 23 and it goes to verse 28. i
[1:00:52] want to quickly tell you here so this is
[1:00:54] the types so acts 7 verse 23 to 28 so
[1:00:57] you don't think i lied to you
[1:00:59] i'll say it one more time so acts 7
[1:01:01] verse 23 to 28 so stephen is busy
[1:01:04] talking them
[1:01:05] he says and when it was
[1:01:07] and when he was full 40 years old so
[1:01:09] look at the state of moses
[1:01:12] moses is on the back side of the desert
[1:01:15] he's looking after his father jeffrey's
[1:01:17] sheep
[1:01:17] okay and stephen picks the story up and
[1:01:20] he's busy now telling the pharisees hey
[1:01:22] this is no more than a man i want to
[1:01:23] show you how the scriptures but see they
[1:01:25] didn't look on the scriptures here they
[1:01:27] still just looked at one thing so he
[1:01:29] says to them
[1:01:31] and when it was a full 40 years old it
[1:01:33] came into his heart to visit the
[1:01:35] brethren the children of israel
[1:01:37] and seeing one of them suffering wrong
[1:01:39] this is now moses he defended him and
[1:01:41] avenged him and was a priest and he
[1:01:44] smote the egyptian
[1:01:46] and he was supposed to
[1:01:48] he was supposed his brethren would have
[1:01:50] understood that god by his hand by
[1:01:53] moses's hand would deliver them
[1:01:56] but they understood not
[1:01:58] so moses taking it upon himself
[1:02:00] not god's provided way
[1:02:02] not waiting for god to say go but being
[1:02:04] keen and zealous in everything smites
[1:02:07] this egyptian buries him
[1:02:09] and they see
[1:02:11] so now look at this and he says and the
[1:02:13] next day he showed himself unto them as
[1:02:15] they strove and um
[1:02:18] and he would have set them one against
[1:02:19] the other saying sirs are you brethren
[1:02:22] why do we um wrong one to another
[1:02:25] but he
[1:02:27] that
[1:02:28] but he that did his neighbor wrong
[1:02:30] thrust him away saying who made thee
[1:02:32] ruler and judge over us will thou kill
[1:02:34] me as you did as the egyptian yesterday
[1:02:38] so so so they basically looking at him
[1:02:40] they're looking at the scene again not
[1:02:42] the unseen but he's trying to do it at
[1:02:44] his ability and his own brethren rejects
[1:02:46] him and stephen is busy talking about
[1:02:48] this to the pharisees and the statuses
[1:02:51] before they stone him because he's
[1:02:52] trying to get their attention to say hey
[1:02:55] he wanted to do it his way but god's
[1:02:57] provided way he says he'll send them the
[1:02:59] next 40 years and we're going to go
[1:03:00] there we can go back to the slide there
[1:03:02] um so he's sharing this testimony but
[1:03:04] all that the pharisees do and if you go
[1:03:07] back to the previous chapter acts 6 here
[1:03:09] the last verse in verse 13 it says and
[1:03:11] set up false witnesses which say this
[1:03:13] man chases not and speak blasphemy as
[1:03:15] words against the holy peace and the law
[1:03:18] so the the pharisees just wanted to
[1:03:20] trick stephen into stoning him
[1:03:23] so again the motive behind that was just
[1:03:26] not to receive the word for the day but
[1:03:28] actually to crucify the word to kill the
[1:03:30] word so who was doing the work there
[1:03:33] god be the holy spirit can't be god
[1:03:37] i'm going somewhere with that
[1:03:40] if we look at our brothers and
[1:03:42] sisters and we look at that type of
[1:03:45] attitude towards them we have failed we
[1:03:48] are looking not with god's heart and
[1:03:50] god's eyes but we're looking with carnal
[1:03:52] eyes and the pharisees could never get
[1:03:54] over the cornum realm they could not
[1:03:56] move past the canality because they only
[1:03:59] looked at everything that was eyesight
[1:04:01] and not what was inside
[1:04:04] they didn't look at the at unseen so
[1:04:06] here we've got
[1:04:08] moses kept the flock and he was on the
[1:04:09] black i call it the backslide of the
[1:04:11] desert because he slid away
[1:04:13] and the law
[1:04:14] he did he was backsliding because
[1:04:16] because he now went and felt sorry for
[1:04:17] himself and god had to get that temper
[1:04:19] of him out and so he gave him a wife
[1:04:21] with a temper and trust me she sorted
[1:04:23] him out you don't want a wife with a
[1:04:25] temper i don't have one with a temper
[1:04:28] i'll get a lovely wife god bless you
[1:04:30] sister chantal
[1:04:32] i'll just call it sister chandela get in
[1:04:34] trouble and the angel of the lord
[1:04:36] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[1:04:38] of the midst of the bush so now i want
[1:04:40] to get your attention the light's going
[1:04:41] to struck something here let's get this
[1:04:43] right he says and he looked and behold
[1:04:45] the bush was burning with fire and the
[1:04:48] bus was not consumed so kids
[1:04:51] if i take a bush and i light it what's
[1:04:54] going to happen with it
[1:04:56] it's not going to stay there
[1:04:58] gabriella
[1:05:01] it burnt up
[1:05:03] but see this one wasn't burning up it
[1:05:05] was just staying
[1:05:07] where it was the leaves didn't even burn
[1:05:10] so now look at moses i hope you can put
[1:05:12] yourself in the scripture
[1:05:14] and moses said i will turn aside
[1:05:18] i will turn aside
[1:05:20] and see the great sight
[1:05:23] why this bush is not burned out
[1:05:25] and the lord when he saw that armand
[1:05:27] turned aside and saw
[1:05:30] you can put your name there and god
[1:05:32] called unto him out of the midst of the
[1:05:34] bush and he said armand moses moses
[1:05:36] armand
[1:05:38] and and armand said here am i look at
[1:05:41] them approach
[1:05:43] he didn't try to figure it out
[1:05:45] we'll go on
[1:05:46] now moses was 80 years old instead of
[1:05:49] being a deliverer he looked like all
[1:05:51] hopes was gone and he was he was a
[1:05:53] sheepherder for his father-in-law my
[1:05:56] way back on the backside of the desert
[1:05:58] one morning walked along and the sun
[1:05:59] coming up and he looked over and he see
[1:06:02] the bernie bush god always gives
[1:06:04] something to attract the attention of a
[1:06:06] believer
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] did he attract your attention
[1:06:13] has your attention been attracted
[1:06:16] oh yes or does it still need to happen
[1:06:18] do i need to get you guys to stand up
[1:06:20] and sit down again i know i'm going long
[1:06:21] but come on man hang in there with me or
[1:06:24] i'll start going like brother um call
[1:06:26] names
[1:06:30] okay
[1:06:33] i enjoy that because my kids they know
[1:06:35] if they're not on attention when you're
[1:06:36] preaching that you're going to catch
[1:06:37] them out
[1:06:39] because we don't come here i don't come
[1:06:40] here to preach i don't come here i want
[1:06:42] to teach you something i want to show
[1:06:44] you something that might unlock a little
[1:06:46] bit closer to god this must be between
[1:06:48] you and god not between you the chair or
[1:06:50] the writing pad that you're writing on
[1:06:52] it must be between you and god
[1:06:55] so
[1:06:56] i'm going to go on with this because
[1:06:57] i've got notes there i just want to find
[1:06:59] my notes
[1:07:01] so here you go
[1:07:03] he says he stepped aside not to
[1:07:05] criticize not to analyze not to pull
[1:07:07] some leaves off the tree and take it
[1:07:09] down to a laboratory to see why them
[1:07:11] leaves don't burn
[1:07:13] he stepped to the side of the burning
[1:07:15] fire
[1:07:16] kindly reverently he approached it
[1:07:21] so your approach to what you get here or
[1:07:23] in fellowship or after fellowship or
[1:07:26] outside or whatever is so important
[1:07:30] if your approach is wrong you will not
[1:07:33] receive it
[1:07:34] he goes on to say god said take off your
[1:07:36] shoes moses and the ground that you
[1:07:38] stand on is holy
[1:07:40] okay it's holy ground this is this is a
[1:07:42] place where i'm going to deal with you
[1:07:44] but i want you to first show me respect
[1:07:47] you need to you need to do something
[1:07:49] first
[1:07:50] take off your shoes
[1:07:53] so what if was it so hard
[1:07:55] if i have to take off my shoes to
[1:07:56] approach god is that hard i'm not saying
[1:07:58] let's all take off our shoes when we get
[1:08:00] into church i think it will be a very
[1:08:01] smelly place but
[1:08:03] i think that if god asks you a simple
[1:08:05] thing to take your shoes off can you not
[1:08:07] do it
[1:08:09] the attitude back to god is going what
[1:08:11] gonna bring him on the scene now because
[1:08:13] he said you do that and i'll show you
[1:08:15] more
[1:08:16] but you need to do it
[1:08:18] you need to do it
[1:08:20] if you tell your wife i'll show you
[1:08:22] redemption if you tell your wife i'll
[1:08:24] show you healing
[1:08:25] our marriage is is healed
[1:08:27] sealed he's the middle of our marriage
[1:08:30] it's the best place to be as a christian
[1:08:32] i'm not saying we don't have our trials
[1:08:34] but everything's out in the open there's
[1:08:36] nothing the devil can come and say oh
[1:08:38] but you did this and you did this it's
[1:08:40] out so between me and my wife it's white
[1:08:43] as snow
[1:08:44] clean
[1:08:46] and god can work there because
[1:08:48] everything i had when he said to let it
[1:08:50] go i let it go i had no pride i had no
[1:08:53] other ins uh dry thoughts with it i
[1:08:54] didn't try to reason it i just did it i
[1:08:57] asked him sincerely back show me he
[1:08:59] showed me i did it
[1:09:00] if you do the same you will get the same
[1:09:02] rewards he says here the reason that the
[1:09:05] gifts in the church and the church the
[1:09:07] reason people don't get very much today
[1:09:09] is because the irreverent you approach
[1:09:12] it he said it like every irreverent you
[1:09:14] approach it god
[1:09:15] you've got to come with a full surrender
[1:09:18] made up mind amen amen
[1:09:22] you have to mean business yes he says
[1:09:25] and when you mean business and when you
[1:09:26] come to god and you don't haphazardly
[1:09:29] come just come to church to fall asleep
[1:09:31] on the chair
[1:09:32] and beat on the altar and have some
[1:09:33] chewing gum
[1:09:35] there is no way to come to god that's no
[1:09:38] way to come to god
[1:09:40] just
[1:09:41] come just the same
[1:09:42] as you can and mean what you are talking
[1:09:45] about god will receive you
[1:09:49] big words
[1:09:51] big words
[1:09:53] big words to say if you really mean
[1:09:55] business and you come at the altar i'm
[1:09:56] not making auto calls i'm i'm really
[1:09:58] trying to get some ground examples i
[1:10:00] think sometimes we really i might just
[1:10:02] say it brother ben forgive me you can
[1:10:04] maybe correct this later on you come to
[1:10:06] church
[1:10:08] brother ben you you speak a lot about it
[1:10:11] you come to church just to follow around
[1:10:13] you don't mean business
[1:10:15] you will not get blessed
[1:10:17] no matter if a preacher plea preaches
[1:10:19] here till he's blue in his face you will
[1:10:20] not get a blessing because you're not
[1:10:22] coming into that door meaning business
[1:10:25] with god
[1:10:26] god corrected me on this
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:30] five minutes before the music place we
[1:10:32] show up band
[1:10:33] sorry
[1:10:35] you can you can say sorry later on you
[1:10:37] don't mean business
[1:10:39] you don't mean business because if there
[1:10:42] was really something in you that was
[1:10:43] looking for an answer from god you would
[1:10:45] be waiting here
[1:10:46] many a times ben is sitting here this
[1:10:48] man has grown so much in god praise the
[1:10:50] lord brother ben because at least he
[1:10:52] comes and he's expecting something
[1:10:55] he doesn't stop nobody said he's perfect
[1:10:57] but he sits and he waits on god and he
[1:11:00] prays and he waits and says to savvy the
[1:11:02] same and it's examples that's in our
[1:11:04] church and they pray and they wait and
[1:11:06] they pray and they wait and god delivers
[1:11:09] them and god talks to them and god helps
[1:11:11] them and god has changed this man to the
[1:11:13] man that came into this church to what
[1:11:15] he is today
[1:11:16] living testimonies
[1:11:19] your approach to god if your approach is
[1:11:21] not good you will never get it you will
[1:11:23] always sit in that view and you won't
[1:11:24] get anywhere with god
[1:11:26] and you will wonder why i missed it
[1:11:28] because your approach is wrong
[1:11:31] forgive me i love you all
[1:11:34] i don't mean it bad amen
[1:11:37] remember if you can take it back to god
[1:11:40] you'll be fine
[1:11:42] he says like moses on the big back side
[1:11:43] of the devil desert no matter how
[1:11:46] educated whatever had taken place
[1:11:49] he um his fears and frustrations left
[1:11:53] because he stood on the sacred grounds
[1:11:55] of god
[1:11:56] okay
[1:11:56] nobody could take it away from him
[1:12:00] if you try to argue with brother moses
[1:12:02] to say that bush was not god
[1:12:05] good luck
[1:12:07] too late
[1:12:10] if you want to argue yourself out of it
[1:12:12] go ahead go and argue me out brother ben
[1:12:15] asked us this question would he join
[1:12:17] this church he said
[1:12:19] what will you do
[1:12:21] if i as the pastor one day walk out and
[1:12:23] say this is all a lie what will you do
[1:12:27] no i put the same challenge back to you
[1:12:29] what if half the church tomorrow walks
[1:12:31] out of here
[1:12:34] what would you do
[1:12:35] what experience did you have with god
[1:12:37] where is your sacred ground where is
[1:12:39] your foundation where's your experience
[1:12:42] with god
[1:12:44] because
[1:12:44] i was in churches no man spoke like this
[1:12:48] i was trying to overcome spirit of lust
[1:12:51] never could do it
[1:12:52] i was cheating on my wife i was doing
[1:12:54] everything wrong i possibly could wrong
[1:12:56] nothing could deliver me from it
[1:12:59] until i met him
[1:13:01] not the message the message introduced
[1:13:03] me back to him i met him because he said
[1:13:06] armand you cannot live anywhere but
[1:13:08] outside of this pages you must be inside
[1:13:11] the book
[1:13:12] you must be indian if you do not find
[1:13:14] jesus christ in every scripture what are
[1:13:17] you doing
[1:13:18] and some of these scriptures i couldn't
[1:13:20] understand some of the words i can't
[1:13:21] even pronounce brother isaac helps me
[1:13:23] every now and again and brother andy
[1:13:25] they teach me what's like salubrious but
[1:13:27] at least i'm for real
[1:13:29] i'm for real and i know when god is
[1:13:31] telling me to do something i do it
[1:13:33] because you know what i want to grow
[1:13:35] closer to him and i want you to grow
[1:13:37] closer to him but you have to get real
[1:13:40] with god
[1:13:42] this church want to move forward you
[1:13:43] want to see healing you want to see
[1:13:45] miracles you want to see your children
[1:13:46] return you want to see little children
[1:13:48] coming to the kingdom all people come
[1:13:50] back get real with god
[1:13:53] don't play your man where did it come to
[1:13:55] play oh yeah it's too late amen we it's
[1:13:59] too late to step in church let you see
[1:14:01] an age everybody's falling asleep
[1:14:04] everybody's being allowed by the devil
[1:14:06] to sleep
[1:14:07] and nobody knows where the true word of
[1:14:09] god is
[1:14:10] increase of goods in need of nothing
[1:14:12] please somebody tell me who needs god in
[1:14:14] new zealand
[1:14:15] right
[1:14:16] come on they've got everything
[1:14:19] and said africa can't walk with you
[1:14:21] if i go tomorrow and i open my wallet
[1:14:23] and i walk down the hall of george
[1:14:25] street with 100 bucks or 200 bucks
[1:14:26] sticking out my wallet i will get to the
[1:14:28] supermarket buy my goods walk with all
[1:14:30] of them back to my car that i left open
[1:14:32] still get in my car store drive home
[1:14:34] nothing would happen
[1:14:36] how do i need god i'm not even scared
[1:14:37] man
[1:14:39] you do that in south africa you do it in
[1:14:41] another country it will be a whole new
[1:14:43] game
[1:14:44] we got witnesses
[1:14:46] this country don't need god so the whole
[1:14:48] country is falling asleep and the devil
[1:14:50] goes you're all fine you're doing good
[1:14:54] so many people you know precious
[1:14:56] brothers and sisters that is still
[1:14:58] potential seed of god that's out there
[1:14:59] we know and we are not doing our job to
[1:15:02] get them here
[1:15:04] in prayer you don't need to always
[1:15:06] compel them brother andy said a
[1:15:08] wonderful thing he says hey pray for the
[1:15:10] striving family we're busy
[1:15:11] fellowshipping with them pray for this
[1:15:13] truvi family and they'll go who's this
[1:15:15] to be family doesn't matter
[1:15:17] pray
[1:15:18] they need to come in pray
[1:15:21] we need to go on we need to go home they
[1:15:23] the names are in the book they might as
[1:15:25] well get in because they if he closes
[1:15:27] the book and he walks away it's done it
[1:15:29] says here there must be there must be a
[1:15:31] typos for all of you but once he takes
[1:15:33] that book and the plan of redemption is
[1:15:35] done it's gone there's no more mercy
[1:15:37] there's judgment
[1:15:39] this world's getting judged
[1:15:41] so i want to bring it to stephen and i
[1:15:43] hope i'm not too long it's 8 41 i still
[1:15:45] have 15 minutes i'm going to try to do
[1:15:46] it
[1:15:47] here's some types here i want to catch
[1:15:48] you with these ones
[1:15:53] i put pictures for the little ones hey
[1:15:59] um
[1:16:00] here the preaching of stephen
[1:16:03] so the the the mindset of the pharisees
[1:16:06] is still wrong so i said x729 so i'm
[1:16:09] just going to quickly go this i just
[1:16:10] quickly see
[1:16:15] no it's not that i got 49 sorry
[1:16:19] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[1:16:21] footstep where is the house that you
[1:16:23] build me save the lord
[1:16:25] or what is the place of my rest we know
[1:16:27] where it is it's in the believer hath
[1:16:29] not my hand made all these things
[1:16:31] he says ye stiff-necked and
[1:16:33] uncircumstantin is circumcised in heart
[1:16:35] and ears
[1:16:37] ye who always resist the holy ghost as
[1:16:39] your fathers did so did ye
[1:16:42] and he wasn't lying
[1:16:44] god was taking over here this wasn't
[1:16:46] stephen speaking this was god speaking
[1:16:48] through stephen saying you always resist
[1:16:51] me
[1:16:51] because you're always looking for a way
[1:16:53] out
[1:16:55] and so of course they dragged him out
[1:16:57] because they got so angry dragged him
[1:16:58] out stoned him and before he died god
[1:17:00] says don't worry i've got you
[1:17:02] and he fall asleep
[1:17:04] and he and he saw jesus christ on the
[1:17:06] right hand of god so god rewards the
[1:17:08] believer no matter what they say rewards
[1:17:10] the believers
[1:17:12] he says now happen look at this guy
[1:17:14] standing here who can tell me young
[1:17:16] people
[1:17:16] young kids hands up who can tell me is
[1:17:19] that who didn't i ask
[1:17:21] rebecca
[1:17:22] it's saul
[1:17:25] or is it
[1:17:29] god paul you amen so saul's standing
[1:17:32] here he sees this event and something
[1:17:35] pricks in his heart and he goes bro this
[1:17:37] is wrong
[1:17:38] this is all just wrong he's a pharisee
[1:17:41] devout christian or devote
[1:17:43] loves the lord follows him reads his
[1:17:46] bible does all the
[1:17:48] rituals but he looks at the scene and he
[1:17:50] cannot he cannot figure it out
[1:17:53] but instead of turning his focus back to
[1:17:55] god and say god show me he goes to the
[1:17:57] scribes and pharisees and he says give
[1:17:59] me that documentation so i combined all
[1:18:01] these christians because no man should
[1:18:03] die by someone's feet again
[1:18:05] not for this jesus christ i'm just
[1:18:07] paraphrasing okay
[1:18:09] that's the thought i got when i looked
[1:18:10] at it so something pricked him and now
[1:18:12] he says i'm going to hit this hard i'm
[1:18:14] going to go against this message i'm
[1:18:16] going to show them you don't need to
[1:18:17] dress a certain way or act a certain way
[1:18:20] or do a certain thing to receive christ
[1:18:22] i'm going to hit that at the root of the
[1:18:24] tree
[1:18:27] but he hasn't met jesus christ
[1:18:29] while jesus christ is there right there
[1:18:33] living god okay
[1:18:35] they preached jesus christ he's still
[1:18:37] there stephen just spoke about
[1:18:38] everything that he'd done he just
[1:18:40] introduced the christ to them and then
[1:18:41] they stoned him for it so god's saying
[1:18:43] hey bro there's a way out and then they
[1:18:45] stoned the way out as they did all the
[1:18:47] other prophets
[1:18:50] he says and then philip now look at this
[1:18:52] now he gets angry and he starts
[1:18:53] persecuting the jews after the
[1:18:55] christians and he goes to all the
[1:18:56] synagogues kicks them out binds them
[1:18:58] throws them in jail and what happens to
[1:19:00] christians scatter they scatter
[1:19:02] as much as you're trying to cover the
[1:19:04] word the christians scatter so what
[1:19:06] happens philip in chapter 8 he goes and
[1:19:08] he goes to samaria
[1:19:12] and he goes preach jesus christ to them
[1:19:14] and they receive christ
[1:19:17] so as much as he's kicking against it
[1:19:19] god goes i don't mind i'll just keep on
[1:19:21] going because you know what this is my
[1:19:23] plan of redemption this is me doing the
[1:19:25] work as much as you tried to kill every
[1:19:27] prophet i'll just send another one i'll
[1:19:29] just send another messenger i've just
[1:19:30] seen another preacher i've just seen
[1:19:32] another brother to come and tell you
[1:19:34] gideon one more time
[1:19:37] i'm in control
[1:19:39] are you able to heal to it
[1:19:42] then philip goes and he preached jesus
[1:19:43] christ but i want to say there was a
[1:19:45] light in that city before philip came
[1:19:48] who can tell me who was that
[1:19:50] who was the light in samaria before
[1:19:54] yeah
[1:19:55] god bless you sister
[1:19:58] so because she had experience with god
[1:20:00] she went into samaria and she told them
[1:20:02] jesus christ did all these things told
[1:20:04] me the truth now here comes the minister
[1:20:06] of the gospel walks into the same city
[1:20:08] and says hey it's actually true i'm
[1:20:10] confirming what that sister was
[1:20:12] testifying
[1:20:13] so
[1:20:14] sister vanessa says god delivered me
[1:20:16] from depression amen i'm walking forth
[1:20:19] she's proclaimed a victory a pastor
[1:20:20] comes and says he wants to be delivered
[1:20:22] from process uh depression another
[1:20:23] sister goes it's me god strikes it the
[1:20:25] leaves delivers her from depression walk
[1:20:28] on
[1:20:29] somebody has to keep sowing the seeds a
[1:20:32] living god that is healing us and
[1:20:33] helping us my my god
[1:20:36] that young man there he was so sick
[1:20:38] seven doctors liam stein seven doctors
[1:20:40] didn't know what was going on with him
[1:20:42] he had warts and things he looked like
[1:20:44] this thing called there's an uh old
[1:20:46] movie hellboy it was things that pushed
[1:20:49] out of his head i think sister christine
[1:20:50] you saw all that rings in his body it
[1:20:53] was just a terrible state
[1:20:55] terrible state
[1:20:57] and brother ben comes behind the pulpit
[1:20:58] and he preaches healing and he testifies
[1:21:01] of our sister annalise which tongue tie
[1:21:04] was cut before the doctor touched her he
[1:21:06] says but i prayed and when i prayed was
[1:21:07] it the thunder was it the the birth
[1:21:10] it was the birth it was the birth when
[1:21:12] sister christine when you had that dream
[1:21:15] that that um
[1:21:16] uh gabby would be still birthed
[1:21:18] and then you guys prayed against it and
[1:21:20] brother ben forgot about it but when it
[1:21:22] all came sister bronwyn you were witness
[1:21:23] to that
[1:21:24] and the baby had to come out the channel
[1:21:26] and if it took longer it would have had
[1:21:28] a different turn but because they prayed
[1:21:30] against it it all just happened and she
[1:21:32] came out
[1:21:33] and he said because i prayed and i
[1:21:35] believed and we went on and god did the
[1:21:37] rest we went back home we put i'll never
[1:21:39] forget it i took liam's stand and i put
[1:21:41] him on the table like this and i said
[1:21:42] liam stayed enough is enough do you
[1:21:44] believe jesus christ can heal you i said
[1:21:47] we just heard this do you believe he
[1:21:48] said yesterday i can believe it i said
[1:21:50] can we pray with you and me and my wife
[1:21:52] had to get in one accord and get real
[1:21:54] with god so that he could receive his
[1:21:55] healing and he was healed three days
[1:21:57] later nothing
[1:21:59] no doctor touched him
[1:22:00] no medicine
[1:22:02] healed amen because we got real with god
[1:22:05] because before that testimony we kept
[1:22:07] doubting keep taking pictures keep
[1:22:09] saying oh god we'll heal but keep taking
[1:22:10] pictures whenever we're real with god we
[1:22:13] were just playing christianity
[1:22:15] when you're real with god and you really
[1:22:17] come with a real sincere heart you say
[1:22:19] lord please show me i'm desperate i need
[1:22:21] to know how can god not show you
[1:22:25] because he needs to prepare the ground
[1:22:27] here before he's going to give you that
[1:22:28] revelation i'm about to close hang in
[1:22:30] there children
[1:22:34] so mr paul he goes tall he goes on and
[1:22:36] he starts going to damascus and i'll
[1:22:38] just tell the story now
[1:22:40] but these are scripture if you want to
[1:22:42] go find it write it down because
[1:22:43] everything i say is in the word of god
[1:22:46] if it's the scriptures i mean that not
[1:22:48] not all the jokes and funny things
[1:22:51] just from read between the lines
[1:22:53] and he journeyed to damascus and he was
[1:22:55] going to go and he was going to attack
[1:22:56] these
[1:22:57] christian people because they just
[1:23:00] they lost the blood blood
[1:23:02] and paul in acts 9 3 i've got it
[1:23:04] highlighted so i'll just minus read it
[1:23:05] for you he says
[1:23:07] and he journeyed and he came to damascus
[1:23:09] and suddenly
[1:23:10] there was a light shine about around him
[1:23:13] a light from heaven and he fell to the
[1:23:16] earth sometimes we need a moment where
[1:23:18] we fall to the earth
[1:23:19] and he heard the voice saying unto him
[1:23:21] saw saul why persecuted cutest tell me
[1:23:25] now listen to this and he said who art
[1:23:28] thou lord
[1:23:29] and the lord said i am jesus who
[1:23:32] who you persecute um is it hard for thee
[1:23:35] to kick against the pricks
[1:23:37] and here verse six it says and and he
[1:23:40] trembling
[1:23:42] and astonish said lord what would you
[1:23:45] have me do
[1:23:46] that means this meeting with god was
[1:23:48] more than just a just a light shining
[1:23:51] from a roof
[1:23:52] he wouldn't call any other thing lord he
[1:23:54] was a cr he was a jew devout jew he will
[1:23:57] not call anything else but this moment
[1:23:59] had him in such a place where he had
[1:24:01] fear
[1:24:02] and he knew that god was now dealing
[1:24:04] with him
[1:24:05] and he says look at his response what
[1:24:07] would you what would you want me to do
[1:24:11] not how can i get around this or is it
[1:24:12] really you as a team is it
[1:24:14] another come on man he got real with god
[1:24:18] and says lord what would you want me to
[1:24:19] do
[1:24:20] and he knew that this sovereign almighty
[1:24:23] god has just come his way and started
[1:24:25] dealing with him
[1:24:27] not not anything else
[1:24:29] god but i want you to catch this
[1:24:32] and win them and and and then he arrives
[1:24:34] he says arise and go into the city and
[1:24:36] it shall be told thee what you must do
[1:24:40] so paul
[1:24:41] saul gets struck down and god he could
[1:24:44] give him the answer right now he can go
[1:24:46] to him and say this is your answer
[1:24:47] you're healed amen okay and i believe it
[1:24:50] as well and and you delivered and all
[1:24:52] those things you can give him the answer
[1:24:53] right now and he goes no no i want you
[1:24:55] to go the city i want someone to deal
[1:24:57] with you
[1:24:58] why would god do that have you ever
[1:25:00] thought about it i've said it the
[1:25:01] previous time why would god choose man
[1:25:03] to come and give him his next
[1:25:05] instructions
[1:25:06] have you actually thought about it
[1:25:08] when god is first person speaking to him
[1:25:10] why doesn't he just tell him what to do
[1:25:13] why would god do that
[1:25:15] because god chose the gospel to be
[1:25:17] preached by man
[1:25:19] and to be lived by man because the
[1:25:21] gospel of jesus christ the plan of
[1:25:23] redemption is for
[1:25:24] man
[1:25:26] not for trees not for birds though they
[1:25:28] will benefit from everything it's for
[1:25:30] man so god chooses a preacher
[1:25:33] maybe
[1:25:34] chooses a preacher
[1:25:36] to prepare a message to come stand here
[1:25:38] on a sunday to come and tell you he's
[1:25:40] not in trouble he was actually just
[1:25:42] thinking of something i wanted to get
[1:25:43] his attention to come and tell you
[1:25:45] something to say you know what abe that
[1:25:47] thing that you've been asking me all
[1:25:48] week here's your answer
[1:25:51] preacher doesn't know what goes between
[1:25:52] you and god he's just having a message
[1:25:54] and he's sharing it but if you really
[1:25:56] sincerely know the gospels are dealing
[1:25:57] with a a spirit that's upon you a
[1:26:00] depression a need of healing a place
[1:26:03] where you're really at where you need
[1:26:04] help from god he knows when to get your
[1:26:06] attention but are you prayed up when you
[1:26:09] come here
[1:26:10] are you looking for your answer amen
[1:26:13] i know you guys are tired i'm almost
[1:26:14] there
[1:26:16] but one thing that happened he says and
[1:26:18] when which they joined and
[1:26:20] i said and the men which joined with him
[1:26:22] stood speechless hearing a voice
[1:26:25] but seeing no man
[1:26:28] so they didn't get blinded by this
[1:26:29] gospel it's a perfect type if you really
[1:26:31] think about it he blinds him to the jews
[1:26:33] and then he goes and gives you slightly
[1:26:35] by the gentiles and he starts preaching
[1:26:36] jesus christ to the gentiles so he says
[1:26:38] i'm done with your jews blind him to all
[1:26:40] those doctrines and everything i'm going
[1:26:42] to make his eyes open to jesus christ
[1:26:44] and he's going to preach it to the
[1:26:45] gentiles perfect time
[1:26:47] amen his jesus is everywhere and i'm
[1:26:50] gonna rap over this i think we'll just
[1:26:51] leave it there because it is
[1:26:53] oh i've got eight more minutes i'm gonna
[1:26:54] go for it
[1:26:56] okay everybody stand up
[1:26:58] stand up amen we need to yep
[1:27:01] and sit down
[1:27:02] amen
[1:27:03] the one thing is there is no rules and
[1:27:06] textbooks when it comes to god when god
[1:27:08] is coming your way he's going to do it
[1:27:09] anyways as long as you enjoy the journey
[1:27:11] these things are not to be preaching at
[1:27:12] you these things says if you really look
[1:27:14] hard enough and you go and you go read
[1:27:16] your bible and you say lord show me you
[1:27:18] can spend one chapter i promise you you
[1:27:20] can be on one chapter one the same
[1:27:23] chapter for a whole year and you will
[1:27:25] still not touch the size of it
[1:27:27] brother branham used to preach or paul
[1:27:29] job he was sitting on the airship so
[1:27:30] long they're asking can you get him off
[1:27:32] the airship who shared that with me just
[1:27:34] recently brother before he says oh
[1:27:36] brother you know you were poor job he
[1:27:38] was on the airship so long can you
[1:27:39] please get him off because he's feeling
[1:27:41] sorry for him already but you can't you
[1:27:43] can't exhaust it there's too much of him
[1:27:46] so here we go here's a here's a nice
[1:27:48] scene okay and i think i'll close with
[1:27:50] this because i want to encourage you
[1:27:54] i'm not here to try to
[1:27:56] make you feel sorry and create the
[1:27:57] emotion i want to encourage you that if
[1:27:59] you approach god if you really approach
[1:28:02] god like a for real life person you will
[1:28:04] get a for real life response
[1:28:07] because the gospel is real
[1:28:09] the rest of this world is all fake
[1:28:12] might have never seen so many fake lips
[1:28:14] eyes lipstick
[1:28:15] dudes everything if you want to see fake
[1:28:18] just walk out in the street there's
[1:28:19] enough fake out there there's not enough
[1:28:21] originals out there
[1:28:25] why do you want to enhance yourself if
[1:28:27] you're beautiful already come on man
[1:28:29] men you handsome i mean dude
[1:28:32] it's different you know call a man
[1:28:33] beautiful but think about it why if god
[1:28:35] has made you everything you are
[1:28:38] do you want to go try and make yourself
[1:28:40] different
[1:28:41] for what reason because then there must
[1:28:43] be vanity or something must be behind it
[1:28:44] there must be another spirit behind it
[1:28:46] to want you make to go another way
[1:28:49] because god said you're perfect as i
[1:28:51] made you there's nothing wrong with you
[1:28:53] and by the way who's looking
[1:28:55] like like
[1:28:56] sister and i'll just well well i'll
[1:28:59] explain to you sustaina okay
[1:29:02] there's two types of cars in this world
[1:29:03] there's a souped-up car dropped
[1:29:05] suspension maxed all the way out and
[1:29:08] i'll do it talk because i'm a boy i
[1:29:10] don't know how to do it go talk so just
[1:29:11] try to follow me this thing when it goes
[1:29:13] over the bump it makes sparks it sounds
[1:29:15] like the bee's knees the exhausted so
[1:29:17] big kids can play in it it looks the
[1:29:19] part
[1:29:20] sounds the part
[1:29:22] has most of the parts but nothing beats
[1:29:25] the original
[1:29:27] so if you go 1963 ferrari
[1:29:30] and you go google that that's the first
[1:29:32] of its kind of those sports cars those
[1:29:34] guys that cause is that the 1963
[1:29:36] brotherhood
[1:29:38] for 64. 63 64. and that's just how much
[1:29:41] i know beautiful car
[1:29:43] but nobody goes buy a 21 million or how
[1:29:46] many ever dollar car and then go drop
[1:29:49] the suspension put this massive exhaust
[1:29:51] on it
[1:29:52] everything there because the value of
[1:29:54] the car is beautiful as it is
[1:29:58] so why do you want to add to value which
[1:30:00] if you're already invaluable there's no
[1:30:03] value on you greater than the blood of
[1:30:06] god the life of god for you
[1:30:09] let god sovereign god come and pay the
[1:30:12] the most deepest price for you to say i
[1:30:14] love you the way you are and then you
[1:30:16] want to go and follow some lies of the
[1:30:18] devil to say you have to look a certain
[1:30:20] way act a certain way dressed a certain
[1:30:22] way
[1:30:22] you're selling yourself cheap man
[1:30:25] because god already said you're
[1:30:26] beautiful just as you are
[1:30:29] you don't need perversion
[1:30:32] so these three they hang on the cross
[1:30:33] jesus christ in the middle
[1:30:36] and the two thieves and i want to i want
[1:30:38] to kind of get this get this get this
[1:30:40] approach
[1:30:41] the two thieves are going at him
[1:30:43] and it says here
[1:30:45] i got the scripture he said
[1:30:48] and this and the superscription also
[1:30:51] that was written over him in letters in
[1:30:53] greek and in latin and in hebrew this is
[1:30:55] the king of the jews so massive thing
[1:30:57] going on but now don't look at the scene
[1:31:00] let's try to see the unseen right now
[1:31:02] let's see let's read in between the
[1:31:04] lines now and one of the male vectors
[1:31:06] which was hanging railed on him
[1:31:09] saying if they'll be the christ save
[1:31:11] thyself and save us
[1:31:13] still not getting it still same attitude
[1:31:17] same way
[1:31:20] he's not really looking for christ he's
[1:31:22] not looking he's on the cross he goes
[1:31:24] i'm gonna die so i might as well while
[1:31:26] i'm gonna die i'm gonna do it this way
[1:31:27] so you know if i'm gonna die i'm gonna
[1:31:29] die in a blaze of glory
[1:31:31] why die in a blaze of glory if you can
[1:31:33] walk in the rapture
[1:31:35] have you ever thought about it hey boys
[1:31:37] are you awake
[1:31:39] do you need to die in a blaze of glory
[1:31:42] why you don't need to
[1:31:44] you can walk into heaven you know no
[1:31:46] other men except elijah was into heaven
[1:31:48] and enoch and jesus christ and the
[1:31:50] saints went off there's not a lot of
[1:31:52] people that can do that
[1:31:54] but any other guy can die in the blaze
[1:31:56] of glory
[1:31:57] don't let the world trick you boys
[1:31:59] that's not your part
[1:32:03] he says and one of the male factors in
[1:32:05] the world and he will say save thyself
[1:32:06] or save us but the other answer rebuked
[1:32:09] him
[1:32:10] he says bro
[1:32:11] wake up
[1:32:13] something's about to happen something's
[1:32:15] happening to this man and you're not
[1:32:17] looking with your spiritual eyes you're
[1:32:19] only looking at church eyes because you
[1:32:21] only want the service to finish so that
[1:32:22] you can go home
[1:32:24] look up eternal life is being imparted
[1:32:28] here
[1:32:29] something greater is going to take place
[1:32:31] here but they're looking at everything
[1:32:33] else is what where they're supposed to
[1:32:35] be looking
[1:32:37] and he says
[1:32:39] and indeed justify we receive our due
[1:32:41] reward in our deeds and this man has
[1:32:44] done nothing amiss
[1:32:45] and he said unto jesus lord
[1:32:48] he caught it
[1:32:49] lord
[1:32:50] remember we when you come into thy
[1:32:52] kingdom
[1:32:55] because he had a moment where he looked
[1:32:56] at it he just stopped he just stopped
[1:32:58] and he said you know what
[1:33:01] i'm missing something here
[1:33:04] is this feeling saying i kind of need to
[1:33:05] do this
[1:33:07] is something in me saying the devil is
[1:33:08] lying to me
[1:33:10] trying to trick me
[1:33:12] trying to get me on his side trying to
[1:33:14] say the gospel is not true
[1:33:16] i'm just sitting in church wasting my
[1:33:18] breath i'll never get into heaven i'll
[1:33:20] never understand this message i'll never
[1:33:22] understand the gospels i'll never meet
[1:33:23] jesus christ i won't be married
[1:33:25] i won't get a husband i won't get a wife
[1:33:28] brother marion you will get a wife
[1:33:30] you will get a wife
[1:33:33] brother david you will get a wife
[1:33:35] because you know what god wants you to
[1:33:37] be happy
[1:33:39] and it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:33:40] tells you don't listen to him no matter
[1:33:43] what you do because once you start
[1:33:45] agreeing with the devil
[1:33:47] you are on his ground
[1:33:51] and you will go like this
[1:33:53] every day
[1:33:55] i'm saying this to the young people
[1:33:56] because you know what is your greatest
[1:33:58] challenge young people
[1:33:59] is to follow god find a good wife find a
[1:34:02] steady job find a good house i know i
[1:34:05] was there
[1:34:06] you really want to just have stability
[1:34:08] you want stability in your life seek god
[1:34:12] seek god first
[1:34:13] you want stability you want the perfect
[1:34:15] wife out there for you you pray god
[1:34:17] sends her he will send her
[1:34:19] if you if you should be married you'll
[1:34:21] be married if you should have a house
[1:34:23] you'll have a house if you want a
[1:34:24] ferrari you'll give you a ferrari just
[1:34:26] remember when you ask for it how you ask
[1:34:29] and what if you're actually seeking his
[1:34:31] will or your will
[1:34:34] okay i'll stop there maybe i'll touch
[1:34:36] some points there and jesus said to unto
[1:34:38] unto him very very i sound to thee
[1:34:41] today thou shalt be with me in paradise
[1:34:44] so psalms 85 7-11 show us thy mercy o
[1:34:48] lord and grant us thou salvation
[1:34:50] i will hear what god the lord will speak
[1:34:53] for he will speak peace unto his people
[1:34:56] and to unto his saints but let them not
[1:34:59] turn again to folly
[1:35:02] did you catch that
[1:35:05] you ask god for an answer he tells you
[1:35:08] what to do
[1:35:09] do it
[1:35:11] do not turn back to folly
[1:35:14] surely his salvation is nigh to them
[1:35:17] that fear him
[1:35:19] amen don't be scared
[1:35:22] just be reverent amen that's right
[1:35:25] and i'll close almost like seeing died
[1:35:31] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[1:35:33] before the coming and the great grateful
[1:35:35] day of the lord and he shall turn the
[1:35:37] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:35:39] and the hearts of the children to their
[1:35:40] fathers
[1:35:42] i just want to ask you something
[1:35:45] have you actually look at the pillar of
[1:35:47] fire look at brother branham you look at
[1:35:49] the scene you go oh you know it could be
[1:35:51] a
[1:35:52] light at the back it could be a bulb in
[1:35:54] there in the roof like some people claim
[1:35:56] it could be whatever you want it to be
[1:35:59] have you actually
[1:36:01] asked him to reveal you the significance
[1:36:03] of this scripture in your life
[1:36:05] have you actually seen how privileged we
[1:36:07] are
[1:36:09] amen i see a lot of christians out there
[1:36:12] and i mean it with a sincere heart that
[1:36:13] sincerely is serving god
[1:36:16] and it's sincerely wrong
[1:36:21] come on let's be
[1:36:22] honest i'm not saying they don't love
[1:36:25] god
[1:36:27] but they took a little bit of men
[1:36:29] a little bit of god
[1:36:31] form the denomination little bit of man
[1:36:34] a little bit of god form the
[1:36:36] denomination
[1:36:37] and separated from the truth
[1:36:39] do you really want to be separated from
[1:36:41] the truth
[1:36:43] if god can point you back to the word to
[1:36:45] the word i don't say the message listen
[1:36:47] to me
[1:36:48] the word
[1:36:50] so young people you struggle to overcome
[1:36:53] why
[1:36:55] old people we struggle to to claim our
[1:36:58] promises i can't say i'm old i'm not 40
[1:37:00] plus so i can i can say that
[1:37:02] i can't ever other people so so i'm not
[1:37:04] saying anybody is real old but are you
[1:37:07] struggling
[1:37:08] so if you're struggling isn't our
[1:37:10] approach a bit wrong here
[1:37:12] so if the light struck the lens
[1:37:14] if god has made his imprint
[1:37:16] on you saying hey i've put you i've
[1:37:18] brought you into truth if you've done
[1:37:20] that for you what's your response
[1:37:24] positions if you want to come up
[1:37:26] what's your what's your response to god
[1:37:28] if he said
[1:37:32] he said like all these witnesses there
[1:37:35] that seem god
[1:37:36] what's your response if god says there's
[1:37:38] more to this than meets man's eyes
[1:37:40] what's your response
[1:37:43] how should it be you come to church to
[1:37:45] come and fall asleep
[1:37:47] children mr malachi
[1:37:50] you're not asleep i just say because i
[1:37:51] got your attention i like it brother it
[1:37:53] works
[1:37:54] helium
[1:37:56] why do we come to church boys sisters
[1:38:00] you know i'll share a little bit of
[1:38:02] martin and i'll close with that you can
[1:38:03] maybe play some nice music there in the
[1:38:05] background sister christine because it
[1:38:06] always softens the blow
[1:38:08] it does it does help
[1:38:10] i'm going to be i'm going to very honest
[1:38:11] i only have a brother armand moment here
[1:38:13] with you
[1:38:15] who believes in healing can i see it
[1:38:16] with a uplifted hand

[1:39:55] supernatural
[1:39:56] i've got a desire to see more of god
[1:39:58] experience more of god i think the time
[1:40:00] is at that time where the church of of
[1:40:02] the living god takes that next step and
[1:40:04] say okay god we are here to mean
[1:40:06] business let's do business
[1:40:09] that's right
[1:40:11] yes sir

[1:40:18] church starts when it starts if you're
[1:40:20] here or not

[1:40:52] vanessa would break in in tongues or
[1:40:54] sister christine will will speak in
[1:40:56] tongues
[1:40:57] there were people in church and god
[1:40:58] would come and sister bronwyn would
[1:41:00] prophesy and speak in tongues and god
[1:41:03] will come down and give the
[1:41:04] interpretation and you could see god
[1:41:06] working in our life god didn't just say
[1:41:09] hey come here come here hallelujah
[1:41:11] praise the lord it was straight to our
[1:41:12] church it was it was saying hey i've got
[1:41:15] instruction i've got to work for you
[1:41:17] we had prayer meetings where the
[1:41:18] presence of god would come off and come
[1:41:20] down and just go through the whole room
[1:41:22] and it will be so tangible
[1:41:26] brother andy
[1:41:28] first time i ever prayed in my house was
[1:41:30] here in stokes valley i ever really

[1:41:36] they said we want to have a pre-meeting
[1:41:38] there and god moved mightily
[1:41:41] mightily
[1:41:43] my dad and mom came here their life was
[1:41:46] in turmoil you go ask them one day satan
[1:41:48] did a real good job on them
[1:41:50] i needed some help i was only a year in
[1:41:52] this message i went outside i said god
[1:41:55] i've listened to your prophet preach
[1:41:57] when when when i need you i can call you
[1:41:59] on a conference it was raining i'll
[1:42:01] never forget that day never
[1:42:04] i said lord i don't know your scriptures

[1:42:10] but i know that if i call you on a
[1:42:11] conference you will come and you will
[1:42:13] back me up
[1:42:14] and i promise you the very next day was
[1:42:16] a saturday that me and my dad had a good
[1:42:18] chat the very next day brother ben comes
[1:42:20] and he talks and he opens up the law and
[1:42:22] he's speaking about moses law and he
[1:42:25] speaks about god and the relationship
[1:42:27] between husband and wife and me my dad
[1:42:29] just spoke about it and he heals my dad
[1:42:32] he gets my dad's attention
[1:42:34] because why i meant business
[1:42:38] i wanted my dad's salvation so badly
[1:42:40] that i would do anything i will go to
[1:42:43] outside my house the neighbors can see
[1:42:45] me this side the neighbors can see me
