[4:04] [Music]
[4:18] God bless you all this morning.
[4:22] It's good to be here. It's good to be
[4:24] alive. Who's happy to be alive this
[4:25] morning?
[4:27] [Music]
[4:29] Amen.
[4:31] We live in a we live in an age a time
[4:34] where you know there's everyone seems to
[4:37] be fighting
[4:39] and when you think about it you you
[4:41] realize that Jesus calls himself the
[4:44] prince of peace
[4:46] and and one of the fruits of the spirit
[4:49] there's love there's joy then there's
[4:50] peace you know so so a a
[4:54] um result of the spirit of god being
[4:57] present and invited and and amongst
[5:00] anything is is peace and unity and
[5:02] harmony but namely peace like like in a
[5:04] home when a when the spirit of God is in
[5:06] control there will be peace in the home
[5:09] but but you know when you take away that
[5:12] peace in the heart of man is like hatred
[5:17] wrath you know that's that's the natural
[5:20] way that the heart of man will go it's
[5:21] wicked so that's why at the end time
[5:26] there's just going to be more and more
[5:27] wars because it's just there's no peace.
[5:31] So when you take away, you know, when
[5:32] you reject the prince of peace, you get
[5:34] you get man starting to do what man does
[5:36] best without the spirit of God, and
[5:38] that's fight and be at war and be angry
[5:41] and, you know, well, you did that to me,
[5:43] I'll do that to you. It's it's just in
[5:47] the heart of man. I shouldn't say this,
[5:48] but Dave's got his van and he one of our
[5:51] one other family member crashed it for
[5:53] him and the one of the lights doesn't
[5:55] work in the front. So, we've got to get
[5:57] it we're getting it fixed cuz it's all
[5:59] this insurance claim. But you have to
[6:01] drive at night on high beam.
[6:08] So, so I tell him, let's try not to
[6:10] drive that thing at night cuz we're
[6:11] getting the claims through. We got to
[6:12] fix all the front cuz the lights don't
[6:15] If you turn the lights on low beam, they
[6:16] don't go. So, you got to put it on high
[6:17] beam. So
[6:20] the funny thing with human nature is
[6:23] like if someone's high beaming me, I'm
[6:25] like I just give them a bit of a high
[6:26] beam. Just maybe they don't know, but I
[6:27] just then I go low and be high beam. Who
[6:29] cares, you know? Whatever. Just high
[6:32] beam me.
[6:34] But 95% of people will go high beam the
[6:36] whole way. That's it. You're going to
[6:37] high beam me, I high beam you. Take
[6:40] that. You know,
[6:44] that's what's in the heart of man. You
[6:45] do that to me, I'll do that back to you.
[6:47] You know, we just
[6:50] and I but I had to laugh because the
[6:54] Bible says God takes the crafty at his
[6:56] own craftiness or that, you know, he
[6:58] there was one time where there was about
[6:59] a line of like six cars coming towards
[7:01] me. And I was like, man, I'm in for it
[7:04] now. I'm going to highbeam. This was
[7:05] last night. I'm going I'm going to
[7:06] highbeam all these six cars in a big
[7:08] row. But nobody high beam me back cuz I
[7:11] and I realized because the guy at the
[7:12] back if he high beams he's going to be
[7:13] high beaming the guy in front of him as
[7:16] well. You know
[7:19] when you think about it you think God is
[7:20] also there's if you think about that
[7:23] little lesson God also makes the crafty
[7:25] not be able to do things because of
[7:27] something else. So they can't they can't
[7:28] achieve their their purpose. You know he
[7:31] couldn't high beam me cuz he's like well
[7:32] I'm going to be high beaming the guy in
[7:34] front of me too.
[7:35] as much as angry as I am. Often the Lord
[7:38] will do that. He'll people like like
[7:41] when when a when a man's ways please the
[7:43] Lord, he'll make even his enemies to be
[7:44] at peace with him. You know, the Lord
[7:46] can make even your enemies can't get to
[7:47] you. The Lord will just manipulate a
[7:49] situation where they can't actually be
[7:50] like, I want to get him, but I can't.
[7:52] You know, like the devil, I want to get
[7:53] him, but I can't or her, but I can't.
[7:57] Praise the Lord. Let's understand this
[7:58] morning. And don't worry about a thing.
[8:01] The Bible says you'll hear of wars and
[8:03] rumors of wars. He said, "See that you
[8:05] be not troubled." In other words, don't
[8:07] worry about it. Don't worry about it.
[8:09] Keep doing what you're doing. It's it's
[8:11] it's going to get worse before it gets
[8:13] better. Don't worry about it. Just walk
[8:15] in what the Lord's called you in. If
[8:16] you're called to go work here, go work
[8:18] there. Called to plant potatoes there,
[8:20] plant them there. Don't worry about it.
[8:22] You're either going to die or go on a
[8:24] rapture.
[8:28] Don't worry about it. Don't lose sleep
[8:29] over it. We just keep serving the Lord
[8:31] in the capacity that he's told us to.
[8:33] Amen. Lord, we just come to you this
[8:35] morning and we thank you, Lord, that we
[8:36] can be at peace. We have the prince of
[8:38] peace in our midst this morning, Lord.
[8:39] And I pray you'll give each one peace
[8:41] this morning, Lord, and unity and there
[8:44] be there be peace and love and unity
[8:45] amongst us, Lord. As we see in the
[8:48] world, it's going the opposite where
[8:49] there's just where there's there's more
[8:51] and more hate and strife, Lord. But we
[8:53] thank you this morning that we can have
[8:54] love in our hearts. We can love each
[8:55] other. We can be at peace at peace with
[8:57] you, at peace with each other, Lord. And
[8:59] we can be peacemakers this morning. May
[9:01] each one here, Lord, learn to be a
[9:02] peacemaker in every situation that we're
[9:04] in. You said, "Blessed are the
[9:05] peacemakers, for they shall be called
[9:07] the children of God, Lord." So, may we
[9:09] all be peacemakers in our in every
[9:11] situation, Lord. May help us to be
[9:13] peacemakers, not to create strife and
[9:15] that, but to create peace wherever we
[9:16] can, Lord. And if we're the opposite,
[9:18] just give us grace, Lord, to be
[9:20] peacemakers in each situation. So, we
[9:21] just want to commit the service to you.
[9:22] We thank you that we can have an
[9:24] opportunity to worship you this morning,
[9:25] Lord. We just commit the service to you
[9:26] in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[9:29] Who's feeling good this morning? You
[9:30] good? Amen.
[9:33] Oh,
[9:35] some glad morning. When this life is
[9:39] over, I
[9:42] fly away
[9:45] to my home on God's celestial shore. I
[9:52] fly I'll fly away. Oh,
[9:57] fly away. Oh, gloria,

[10:16] shadow of this life have grown. I

[10:45] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by,
[10:50] I'll

[10:53] [Music]
[10:55] with the more weary days. And then I
[11:01] fly away
[11:05] to a land where joy shall never end.
[11:10] I'll
[11:11] fly. I'll fly away, oh Gloria.

[13:54] from the awful
[13:57] crossing. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[14:02] [Music]
[14:16] as heavy.
[14:20] I found
[14:22] so bright

[14:35] can see his smile.
[14:38] Oh, joy is joy. I

[15:24] Glory to glory.
[15:29] Glory is joyful.
[15:38] Heat. Heat.
[15:48] Amen.
[16:02] Wherever the Lord is, there is glory.
[16:05] Amen. You can take your seats this
[16:06] morning. We have a testimony and a
[16:09] special from Sister Pauling. And then
[16:12] after that, we have a special from um
[16:14] Sister Stephanie.
[16:35] Shalom, saints.
[16:41] I've got a a short testimony.
[16:44] Um, it's short because I'm sort of going
[16:47] to summarize it because I don't want to
[16:51] go too much into details.
[16:54] Um
[16:56] I want to to thank God for um the
[17:01] miracle that he has done. Um
[17:04] we went to South Africa in December,
[17:09] came back in January and
[17:13] I've got my eldest son there uh whom I
[17:16] was supposed to come back with
[17:20] and I told him that no, we're not going
[17:22] back with you because you still have up
[17:26] until February 2026 to be in New
[17:29] Zealand.
[17:30] Um then we left him came to New Zealand.
[17:36] Um we were trying to
[17:40] um get tickets for him to come this
[17:42] side. I had sister happy trying to help.
[17:46] We were both looking for the cheaper um
[17:49] tickets. So I'm checking on my side.
[17:51] She's checking on my on his on her side.
[17:55] Um I called immigration on separate
[18:00] matter to ask about something and when I
[18:04] called them I discovered that uh I
[18:08] called them on the 12th of February.
[18:10] To my surprise my son's visa had expired
[18:13] on the 10th of February. So I only found
[18:18] out then.
[18:20] So you you can imagine the the shock uh
[18:23] that you had this opportunity to have
[18:26] this person here in New Zealand.
[18:29] Um had I known if it was the issue of
[18:32] money, I mean money could have been
[18:34] organized, it could have been borrowed
[18:37] to get him here, but I knew that no, he
[18:40] still has time. And two days later, I
[18:43] discovered that he doesn't have time
[18:44] anymore. And there was nothing that
[18:47] could be done um based on his age and a
[18:50] whole lot of things.
[18:54] Um
[18:58] because Tepe was part of you know the
[19:01] people who was trying to organize the uh
[19:03] the tickets.
[19:04] She was the first person to know or my
[19:06] husband was there. I I remember not even
[19:09] being able to finish the conversation
[19:12] with whoever that I was talking to. Um
[19:15] just after I realized what I have done,
[19:18] my husband had to come from the bedroom
[19:21] and finish the conversation.
[19:23] So um to cut the the long story short,
[19:28] it was an impossible situation,
[19:31] completely impossible.
[19:33] Um I remember calling Sister Vanessa and
[19:38] when I called Sister Vanessa,
[19:41] she said to me, it was on a Wednesday. I
[19:43] still remember she said to me, "You're
[19:46] going to go to church today?" Cuz she
[19:48] asked, "Are you coming to church?" I'm
[19:49] like, "I'm the way I'm feeling right
[19:51] now. I don't even think that I'm going
[19:52] to make it to the Wednesday service."
[19:54] She said to me, "You are coming." And
[19:57] she was not asking. It was an
[19:58] instruction. You are coming to the
[20:00] service. You are going to go to the
[20:02] front and ask uh for prayer. And that's
[20:05] exactly what I did.
[20:08] um brother Isaac on I can't remember the
[20:11] same one that day but I remember he made
[20:14] a testimony
[20:16] um on the same Wednesday
[20:19] that testimony was talking about um
[20:23] their trip how difficult or the
[20:25] challenges that they had to face when
[20:27] they went to stay in China that
[20:30] testimony was for me as well because
[20:35] it's it's very rare that uh we come and
[20:38] we open up the service with a testimony.
[20:41] So it was a word of encouragement in
[20:43] that situation. Not a lot of people knew
[20:46] about what was happening.
[20:48] There are two or three learnings from
[20:51] this whole thing. I think the first one
[20:55] was that because I I felt that I made a
[21:00] lot of mistakes. There was a lot of I
[21:02] could have, I shouldn't have. and and um
[21:05] I was told that you' not look at
[21:07] yourself uh keep on looking above the
[21:11] situation and God will do the miracle. I
[21:14] think that was the first thing that came
[21:16] out of this. For the few people who knew
[21:20] what was happening, the second lesson
[21:22] for me was where the caucuses the eagles
[21:27] gather. I saw everybody just coming in.
[21:31] Um, I even laughed and this is me
[21:35] laughing before I know what the outcome
[21:37] is going to be.
[21:39] It's me laughing that the devil, you
[21:42] thought that you are punching me, but I
[21:44] saw my sisters coming and fighting like
[21:47] you can't have one of our own. They took
[21:49] the battle upon themselves as if it's
[21:53] their own. None of you knows who my son
[21:55] is. You've never even met him. But
[21:57] people took it personal um to make sure
[22:00] that they pray for me. Um
[22:05] the third lesson from this is that um
[22:08] God can use anyone everything to the
[22:12] glory of his name.
[22:15] When Pastor Ben was praying, I didn't
[22:18] hear a lot of things because of where I
[22:20] was at the time, but I remember him
[22:24] saying, "God, you make kings." I think
[22:28] it's there's a scripture that talks
[22:30] about that in Daniel
[22:32] uh where it says, "You make kings." And
[22:35] that one was in reference of
[22:37] Nebuchadnezzar.
[22:38] And in this case, brother Ben was
[22:41] saying, "God, you make kings. Whoever is
[22:44] involved in this situation to turn this
[22:46] around, you are more than able to use
[22:48] that person. I'm standing here with my
[22:52] son having a visa um that has been
[22:55] granted and I can tell you believers
[22:58] that this was an impossible situation.
[23:02] If you want the details, I can um tell
[23:05] you about it after this. So, I have got
[23:08] a song uh to sing with my sisters here
[23:12] that says um if you've got any rivers
[23:16] that you think that are impossible,
[23:18] uncrossable,
[23:20] God is more than able to make a way
[23:22] through those for us. Amen.
[23:27] [Music]
[23:35] [Music]
[23:39] I know nothing.
[23:42] [Music]
[24:02] The doors
[24:03] [Music]
[24:23] heat.
[24:31] Go any rivers you think are uncrossable.
[24:37] Go any mountains you can't tell.
[24:43] God specializes
[24:45] in things the impossible
[24:48] [Music]
[24:50] and he will do what no other power can
[24:54] do.
[24:56] Be of good courage
[25:00] to Joshua.
[25:02] And over there must not point away
[25:08] [Music]
[25:09] uncrossable things are impossible.
[25:15] What does divide?
[25:18] [Music]
[25:20] Have you got any rivers you think across
[25:26] the world? You go and you want you can't
[25:31] t
[25:32] Oh yeah
[25:37] things are impossible
[25:39] [Music]
[25:40] and will do no I can do
[25:46] [Music]
[25:48] they would be the obstacle
[25:53] car was to passful to the right.
[25:59] God never failed his stomach
[26:06] was to cross as they might. Hallelujah.
[26:13] [Music]
[26:15] You think God cross the world heavy
[26:19] and you want you to turn through all
[26:28] this impossible.
[26:31] [Music]
[26:38] God is the same and his word is
[26:42] dependable.
[26:44] He'll make a way through the water as
[26:48] for you.
[26:51] Life situation
[26:53] by mountains
[26:58] and hills. He will fight for you.
[27:04] Any rivers you think are closer. Love
[27:10] you.
[27:12] You can't
[27:15] do his specializ.
[27:28] Have you
[27:33] think I cross them? Everybody
[27:40] on
[27:42] his special
[27:44] [Music]
[27:48] you
[27:50] will do what
[27:55] But any
[27:57] rivers you think
[28:01] every
[28:03] mountain you can't
[28:07] hallelujah
[28:13] impossible we will do
[28:17] what the world
[28:19] [Music]
[28:22] [Applause]
[28:30] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[28:32] You can take your seats again.
[28:36] Sorry, sisters. I couldn't help. I just
[28:37] had to join in.
[29:24] I wish I could tell my
[29:28] just
[29:32] so many you have moved
[29:37] you have led me through.
[29:41] And it's only by your grace
[29:44] that I'm standing here today.
[29:50] I'm a witness to your faithfulness
[29:54] in every storm and every step looking
[29:59] back. Never wanted to let me go.
[30:05] And no matter what the future holds,
[30:09] you're working for my good. I know you
[30:13] are faithful.
[30:15] I never walk alone.
[30:20] My life is full of miracles.
[30:28] All that you're healed. All that you
[30:32] can't forget.
[30:35] So even if my life doesn't go,
[30:40] I can handle how I
[30:44] feel to reach
[30:50] the edge.
[30:52] I'm a witness to your faithfulness.
[30:56] And every stone and every step will give
[31:00] back. Never want to let me go.
[31:07] And no matter what the future holds,
[31:11] you're working for my God. I know you
[31:15] are faithful.
[31:17] Don't never walk alone.
[31:21] I never walk alone. Nothing and no one
[31:25] can separate me.
[31:29] Oh,
[31:31] you go behind me and before me.
[31:36] Oh,
[31:39] nothing and no one can separate me.
[31:46] Cuz every moment I know you are with me.
[31:54] I'm a witness to your faithfulness in
[31:58] every storm and every step looking back.
[32:03] Never want to let me go.
[32:09] And no matter what the future holds,
[32:13] you're working for my good. I know you
[32:17] are faithful.
[32:19] I'll never walk alone.
[32:22] I never walk alone.
[32:26] [Music]
[32:40] Amen.
[32:46] [Music]
[32:49] Let's stand this morning.
[33:04] We'll just do a few more songs this
[33:05] morning just before Brother Ben comes
[33:07] up.
[33:12] This one you may not know, but I just
[33:14] feel like singing it this morning
[33:21] [Music]
[33:26] and the doors won't open and the well
[33:29] looks dry.
[33:32] My prayers all go unanswered.
[33:37] And the smile fades and the tears they
[33:40] fall.
[33:42] And all I care for on my should.
[33:48] I'll lift my hand.
[33:51] I'll raise my hand.
[33:53] And I'll defend you, Lord of all.
[33:59] I'll lift my voice
[34:02] and I will sing
[34:05] unto you the glorious king.
[34:14] Jesus almighty
[34:17] powerful savior. To you I pour out my
[34:22] praise.
[34:24] Oh, in mercy and justice collide in a
[34:29] fusion of grace.
[34:32] You're the rain in the desert, the snow
[34:36] in the harst. In every season you reign.
[34:43] For you are the ancient of days and
[34:48] you're worthy of praise.
[34:54] When it don't come easy,
[34:56] everything seems broken.
[35:00] I try singing, but my mouth just won't
[35:03] hold.
[35:05] I still believe all the words you have
[35:08] spoken.
[35:10] It's just sometimes it's hard to sing
[35:13] when I'm still cold.
[35:16] But I forget
[35:18] that all my butth
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] be found in you.
[35:26] I lift my voice
[35:29] and I will sing
[35:32] unto you the glorious king.
[35:41] Lord Jesus Almighty,
[35:44] powerful Savior. To you I pour out my
[35:49] praise.
[35:51] Your mercy and justice collide
[35:57] of grace.
[35:59] You're the rain in the desert. The snow
[36:03] in the harst in every season you reign.
[36:11] You are the ancient of days and you're
[36:15] worthy of praise
[36:19] and everything.
[36:21] Everything comes from your hand.
[36:26] And you declare a beating heart.
[36:31] All creation declares your glory.
[36:36] [Music]
[36:42] Kingdoms will cease at your word.
[36:47] But our tears of repentance secure
[36:51] redeeing grace from your heart of mercy.
[37:03] Lord Jesus, almighty,
[37:06] powerful savior, to you I pour out my
[37:11] praise.
[37:13] Your mercy and justice glad inusion
[37:19] of rain.

[38:07] in the harvest. In every season you

[41:23] [Music]
[41:25] Amen. Aren't you glad you can turn away
[41:28] from the world? Look to him like brother
[41:31] preach a sermon looking away to Jesus.
[41:34] Don't look at the problems of this
[41:35] world. Look away to him. He's the
[41:37] answer. Nothing else will solve it. Only
[41:39] him. Amen. So, praise God. Thank you,
[41:41] musicians. Thank you, brother Isaac.
[41:43] Amen. Good morning, everyone. Great to
[41:45] have here. Amen. Like to welcome Pedon,
[41:48] Elana, and the children. God bless you.
[41:50] Great to have you.
[41:52] Amen. And it's also Elana's birthday.
[41:55] Happy birthday.
[41:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. You know where
[42:02] sister Plling was sharing um the
[42:04] testimony you know brother oni just told
[42:07] me before he said you know it was more
[42:08] than just the visa that was canceled his
[42:10] residency was cancelled immigration told
[42:13] them this has never been been done
[42:15] before the renewal everything that he
[42:17] can come never been done before
[42:19] unprecedented our God specializes in
[42:22] impossible circumstances amen praise the
[42:24] Lord so it's a yeah go go go ask him
[42:28] about the details incredible things but
[42:30] God turns the hearts of whosoever he
[42:32] will that his will will be done. Amen.
[42:34] So, we thank God for that. Amen. Praise
[42:36] the Lord. Let's go to the scripture this
[42:38] morning. Um we're going to go to John
[42:40] chapter 10 and yeah, we're going to read
[42:44] from verses 27 down to verse 38. Then
[42:46] we're going to go to Isaiah 53.
[42:49] Amen. Trust everyone's warm inside.
[42:52] Amen. Your hearts are burning with the
[42:53] Holy Ghost. Joy unspeakable, full of
[42:55] glory. Maybe cold on the outside. Better
[42:58] be cold outside than inside, eh? Amen.
[43:00] You don't want to be cold on the inside.
[43:03] Ain't worth it. Amen. Now, John 10:27.
[43:07] Okay. Amen. It says, "My sheep hear my
[43:09] voice and I know them and they follow me
[43:12] and I'll give unto them eternal life and
[43:14] they shall never perish. Neither shall
[43:16] any man pluck them out of my hand. My
[43:18] father which gave them me is greater
[43:21] than all and no man is able to pluck
[43:23] them out of my father's hand. I and my
[43:26] father are one." Then the Jews took up
[43:29] stones again to stone him. Jesus
[43:30] answered them, "Many good works have I
[43:33] showed you from my father. For which of
[43:35] those works do you stone me?" The Jews
[43:38] answered him, saying, "For a good work
[43:39] we stone thee not, but for blasphemy,
[43:42] because that thou being a man, makest
[43:45] thyself God?" Jesus answered them, "Is
[43:48] it not written in your law?" I said, "Ye
[43:50] are gods. And if he called them gods,
[43:52] unto whom the word of God came, and the
[43:54] scripture could not be broken. Say ye of
[43:57] him whom the father hath sanctified and
[43:58] sent into the world. Thou blasphemst
[44:01] because I say I am the son of God. If I
[44:03] do not the works of my father, believe
[44:05] me not. But if I do, though ye believe
[44:08] me not, believe the works, that ye may
[44:10] know and believe that the father is in
[44:12] me and I in him. The greatest
[44:15] controversy ever is God and man.
[44:18] It's still the same today. Let's go to
[44:21] Isaiah 53 and verse one
[44:24] and we're just going to read down to
[44:25] verse verse 6 here.
[44:31] Amen. I'm sure we could probably
[44:35] recite this from memory.
[44:38] Powerful scriptures
[44:41] says here, "Who hath believed our
[44:42] report? And to whom is the arm of the
[44:44] Lord revealed? For he shall grow up
[44:47] before him as a tender plant, and as a
[44:48] root out of a dry ground. He hath no
[44:51] form, nor comeliness, that when we shall
[44:53] see him, there is no beauty that we
[44:54] should desire him. He is despised and
[44:57] rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and
[44:59] antiqu acquainted with grief, and we hid
[45:02] as it was as it were our faces from him.
[45:05] He was despised and we esteemed him not.
[45:08] Surely he had borne our griefs and
[45:09] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[45:11] him stricken, smitten of God, and
[45:13] afflicted. But he was wounded for our
[45:15] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[45:17] iniquities. And the chastisement of our
[45:19] peace was upon him. And with his stripes
[45:22] we are healed. All we like sheep have
[45:25] gone astray. And we have turned everyone
[45:27] to his own way. And the Lord hath laid
[45:29] on him the iniquity of us all. Praise
[45:32] the Lord. Amen. Let's bow heads in a
[45:34] word of prayer this morning. If you want
[45:35] to be remembered, just want to slip your
[45:36] hand up. Say, "Lord, remember me. Don't
[45:38] pass me by this day." Amen. Gracious
[45:40] heavenly father. Lord, you see all the
[45:42] hands that are raised. Lord, we all want
[45:43] a personal meeting with you today. Lord,
[45:46] we don't just want to come to church and
[45:48] go through a religious work. Lord, we
[45:50] want to spend time with you, dear God.
[45:52] That you would impart to us your word.
[45:54] You would change us from glory to glory.
[45:56] Father, you'd increase our faith. You'd
[45:58] mold us in more into your image, Lord.
[46:00] You'd have your way. You'd be glorified
[46:02] in our lives. That's our desire, Lord.
[46:04] We've come to worship you in spirit and
[46:05] in truth. So, I pray, Father, may your
[46:07] great presence, Lord. May Lord we just
[46:09] want to invite you to our pew where
[46:11] we're sitting now Lord have a have a
[46:13] conversation with us Lord change our
[46:15] lives forever father may you meet every
[46:17] need Lord every hand that's raised Lord
[46:19] you know what the need is behind the
[46:20] hand Lord I don't I pray you'd meet
[46:22] every need touch every life those who
[46:24] are streaming as well Lord be our
[46:25] abundant portion this day we love you
[46:27] Lord we thank you we ask you to anoint
[46:29] speaker and hear one more time that
[46:31] you'd have preeminence in our lives Lord
[46:33] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[46:36] bless you friends you can have your
[46:37] seats this So, as I said, the the great
[46:40] the great controversy has always been
[46:43] God in man. How could God be in man? How
[46:47] could the holy, almighty, eternal God
[46:50] dwell behind flesh? That's always been
[46:53] the that's always been the controversy
[46:56] down through the ages. And it is the
[46:58] same controversy today. Now, you know,
[47:01] there's always been uh there's always
[47:04] been a a thing, you know, where uh maybe
[47:07] we'll just go to here. You know, last
[47:08] Sunday was Pentecost Sunday. So, it was
[47:11] however many years since the day of
[47:13] Pentecost where God came and dwelt in
[47:16] his church. And so, there's always been
[47:18] this thing where where you know
[47:22] the thing is people believe the Holy
[47:25] Ghost dwells in people. Even the
[47:27] Catholics believe the Holy Ghost is in
[47:28] his church. But the thing is what
[47:31] happens is um so that that phrase is not
[47:34] controversial to really any denomination
[47:36] of of church. But when you say the
[47:39] almighty dwells in you, that's where it
[47:41] becomes a controversy because as I said
[47:44] even the Catholics believe the Holy
[47:46] Ghost is is is in a believer. But you
[47:48] know what happens is subconsciously is
[47:51] the church world has made the Holy Ghost
[47:54] not the almighty God. They have made him
[47:57] the third person of the godhead at best
[48:00] or positive energy at worst good vibes.
[48:03] That's what the church world has made
[48:05] the Holy Ghost dwelling in people. It's
[48:07] far more than that. Now, this may seem
[48:09] very elementary, but I I pray it' be
[48:11] very impactful where you really dwell
[48:13] believe or really realize who's in me.
[48:16] It's more than a religious spirit. It's
[48:18] more than a church system, more than a
[48:19] denomination, more than a good vibe or
[48:22] good feeling or some fuzzy wuzzies going
[48:24] on. No, it's God himself that made
[48:27] heaven and earth dwells in man.
[48:29] Hallelujah. Amen. So the same one that
[48:31] said, "Let there be sun, moon, and stars
[48:33] comes and dwells in his church." Now,
[48:35] this has always been a controversy. It
[48:37] was a controversy at the council of Na.
[48:39] That's part of why they had that council
[48:41] was to iron out was God, was Jesus God
[48:43] or was he man or was he both? This was a
[48:46] big So, it's always been a controversy.
[48:48] And then even there in Jesus' day where
[48:50] it's amazing how, you know, they did not
[48:53] stone or they did not want to stone
[48:55] Jesus for the good works he did, you
[48:56] know, for the miracles he did, the
[48:58] healings and all those things he did.
[49:00] They did not want to stone him for that.
[49:01] But because he said, "I and my father
[49:04] are one. When you see me, you see the
[49:06] father." Now the bride should be able to
[49:09] say the same thing. When you see the
[49:12] believer, you should be able to say you
[49:14] can see the father. Now, that may be a
[49:16] big statement to some, but it's actually
[49:18] what the Bible, that's what the gospel
[49:19] actually teaches. The gospel is God
[49:22] would sanctify a people to dwell in.
[49:24] That's the purpose of Calvary. It's
[49:26] nothing less. I mean, if you if you got
[49:28] anything less than that, you've missed
[49:29] the whole thing. Amen. But if God
[49:31] himself dwells in you by him,
[49:33] sanctifying you by his blood, making you
[49:36] holy that you can he can dwell in you,
[49:38] dwell in your soul, then that's the
[49:40] gospel. Amen. That's the only uh you
[49:43] know that's you know that's the most
[49:44] most simple way of putting it. But you
[49:46] see now the problem is it's always the
[49:48] veil. It's the outside that stumbles
[49:51] people. Here was a man here was a man
[49:53] from Galilee. He wasn't rich. He wasn't
[49:56] he didn't look different to anyone else.
[49:58] We just read there in Isaiah 53 that
[50:00] when we saw him there's no form or
[50:02] clumliness when we see him there's no
[50:03] beauty that we should desire him. you
[50:05] know, you see many older, you know,
[50:07] paintings of Jesus or even children's
[50:09] Bibles and they make him 6 foot blonde
[50:12] hair and looking different than the rest
[50:13] of the Jews around him. He looked
[50:15] exactly the same. He didn't look like a
[50:18] king outwardly. He didn't look like some
[50:19] great man. He was a He was a homeless
[50:21] man. He He didn't have a place to lay
[50:24] his head. He was a homeless man on the
[50:26] street. But yet, it was God made flesh.
[50:28] Amen. It was the Almighty God dwelling
[50:30] in man. It was Emmanuel, God with us. So
[50:33] you see this is what they stumble at is
[50:35] they is they saw the outwards um outward
[50:38] and they thought how on earth could this
[50:39] man say I and my father are one and you
[50:42] see it's always the veil that stumbles
[50:44] people and it even but I could say the
[50:46] veil can even stumble the believer in
[50:48] their own selves. It's the wrestle with
[50:50] the veil that's the problem. But really
[50:52] let's forget let's move on from the
[50:54] veil. Let's move on from the wrapping.
[50:56] The wrapping shouldn't dictate what's on
[50:58] the inside. The inside should dictate to
[51:00] the wrapping who lives, who controls
[51:02] who, what lives, what manifests, what
[51:04] attitude comes out. It's not the veil
[51:06] that matters. It's not the wrapping,
[51:08] it's the inside. Amen. It's like the
[51:10] tabernacle in the wilderness, it had
[51:12] four actually four layers of wrapping.
[51:14] So, it's the best word I can think of
[51:16] right now. The outside was badger skins,
[51:18] you know. So, when you saw the
[51:20] tabernacle in the wilderness, you you
[51:22] wouldn't see something that was really
[51:24] an incredible kind of a structure.
[51:27] Here's a tent. Let's just say it for
[51:28] what it is. It's a tent, right? It's
[51:31] wrapped in badger skins on the outside.
[51:32] Sure, there's the ark and there's
[51:34] everything on the inside. But if you
[51:36] look at it from the outside, you say,
[51:37] "What's so great about this?" Imagine if
[51:39] we were back there however many thousand
[51:41] years and you know, we come to the
[51:43] outside of the host of Israel and
[51:45] somehow they let us in to actually have
[51:47] a look, not to go inside. We wouldn't be
[51:49] allowed to, but even just view this
[51:51] structure that's on the inside of their
[51:53] camp. And they and they begin to tell us
[51:55] that the Lord God Almighty that made you
[51:58] lives in this building. Amen. We've seen
[52:01] him do many miraculous things, but he
[52:02] lives in this. He lives in this
[52:04] structure. And maybe in our minds we
[52:06] think some great grand temple of stone
[52:08] and marble and some incredible, you
[52:10] know, structure. But then the closer you
[52:12] get to it, maybe carnally you'd feel the
[52:14] more underwhelmed
[52:16] because it's a tent. But on the inside,
[52:20] it's the inside that counts. You never
[52:22] judge a book by its cover. You never
[52:24] judge your own book by its cover. Amen.
[52:27] No, you judge it by the contents, the
[52:29] word written in the heart, the Holy
[52:30] Ghost manifesting the word in our lives.
[52:32] That's what you judge the book by. Amen.
[52:34] So, it's a bunch of badger skins. Think
[52:36] of a badger. You think of a badger, you
[52:37] know, it's not a nice kind of a
[52:39] creature. You know, you think of like a
[52:40] honey badger in South Africa, man. They
[52:42] get into everything. They rim wreck.
[52:44] They do all kinds of things. You know,
[52:46] that's a badger nature. So God is going
[52:48] to take something that's got a kind of a
[52:50] mean kind of a vicious nature and wrap
[52:52] himself with it. But that nature is not
[52:56] going to rule what's on the inside.
[52:57] Amen. The badger skin nature did not
[52:59] rule that there was mercy in there. The
[53:02] atonement was made in there. God came
[53:04] down in there and spoke to his people in
[53:06] there. It didn't change any of those
[53:08] things. Are you with me today? Amen.
[53:10] Because that that represents you by the
[53:12] way. Okay? Remember God Moses saw the
[53:14] pattern in heaven. and he made it upon
[53:16] the earth and it's actually the building
[53:18] is actually represents the human you and
[53:20] I. So it's not the badger skin. We get
[53:22] so caught up in the badger skin. Forget
[53:24] this thing.
[53:26] This thing needs changing. Amen. It's
[53:29] like you know what what what difference
[53:32] actually happened to all of the badger
[53:34] skin when when oh wait oh yeah I got to
[53:38] do it here.
[53:39] Now now we got the pillar of fire above
[53:41] that same tent.
[53:44] The badger skin remained the same badger
[53:46] skin. It didn't become a super material.
[53:49] It didn't become something different. It
[53:50] didn't become gold linen or some kind of
[53:54] fancy pressure. Some of you looking at
[53:55] me like I'm a bit crazy here, but it
[53:57] stayed bad skin. It stayed exactly the
[54:00] same material, same weave, same hair,
[54:02] same whatever. It remained the same. But
[54:05] the difference was almighty God was now
[54:07] in behind the badger skin. And it's the
[54:10] same thing with you and I. Same old
[54:12] badger skin.
[54:14] That's why we there there's nothing
[54:16] different between us and the people in
[54:17] the world humanly, right? Sure, there's
[54:20] that gene seed of God on the inside of
[54:21] our soul, but same old tent, different
[54:24] person living in the house, though.
[54:26] Amen. Completely different kind of a
[54:28] person. Same tent. You know, there
[54:30] probably would have been other other
[54:31] tents that had a bad skin covering, but
[54:33] the tabernacle was different cuz God was
[54:35] in it. Amen. And that's the difference
[54:38] between you you and and and someone else
[54:40] who does not have the Holy Ghost
[54:41] dwelling on the inside is the fact that
[54:43] you got deity in humanity. Now, deity
[54:46] behind badger skins as opposed to just a
[54:48] badger skin. Now, if you just got a
[54:50] badger skin nature, that thing will
[54:52] riick and go wild and do crazy stuff and
[54:54] be a badger. But if that's been killed
[54:56] and stretched out and surrendered to God
[54:58] and God dwells in it, then deity will
[55:00] rule the badger skin. We get so caught
[55:03] up in bad skin problems. The solution is
[55:06] not trying to iron out the badger skin.
[55:08] It's not trying to repair the badger
[55:10] skin and make it look younger and oil
[55:11] the badger skin and whatever they do to
[55:13] keep it maintained. It's not about that.
[55:16] That ain't going to help you. It's no
[55:17] deity dwelling behind the badger skin is
[55:20] what really fixes every single problem.
[55:24] Amen. He is the solution to every
[55:26] problem. You got to realize this.
[55:27] Psychology wants to fix the badger skin.
[55:29] You ain't going to fix it. That's why
[55:32] this world is falling fallen apart.
[55:36] That's why families have fallen apart.
[55:38] All kinds of things are broken because
[55:39] people have been fixated on the skin and
[55:43] not what's on the inside of the skin. On
[55:46] the inside.
[55:48] Amen. So, we could easily look at this
[55:51] and say, "Almighty God dwelt in there."
[55:55] That's not controversial at all to
[55:57] anyone, Catholic, whatever. Almighty
[56:00] God, creator of heaven and earth came
[56:02] down, dwelt between the cherubam wings
[56:04] on top of the mercy seat. He was there
[56:06] in there. But then when you say now that
[56:08] same one is in you, that same God, not a
[56:12] lesser God. Remember the Holy Ghost is
[56:14] not some religious spirit. This is
[56:15] already in my notes. Pedro, we were
[56:17] talking about this last night. I was
[56:19] already wanting to talk about these
[56:20] things. You see, the the Holy Ghost is
[56:22] not some religious spirit that's with
[56:24] equal power to the devil and then it's
[56:26] whoever you dictate to wins. No, the
[56:29] Holy Ghost is the almighty God who
[56:31] conquered hell, death, and the grave who
[56:33] is victorious in every situation that
[56:35] you know the devil's completely
[56:37] defeated. So it's not like they have
[56:38] equal power. The devil has no power. The
[56:41] only power he has is deception to try
[56:42] and trick you into something. But he has
[56:44] no power in himself. But God made you.
[56:47] God made the universe. God made all
[56:49] things. And he dwells amen where in the
[56:52] heart of the believer.
[56:54] Amen. So you got to remember
[56:56] flawlessness is not perfection.
[56:59] Many people think, well, if I've got a
[57:00] flawless life, I must be made perfect in
[57:03] Christ. No, same badge of skins. They
[57:07] weren't flawless. They were badger
[57:09] skins, right? So, a flawlessness is not
[57:11] perfection. We, you know, you we get
[57:13] this idea in our mind when I'm really in
[57:15] this kind of this plane of everything's
[57:17] fine and nothing troubles me and I'm
[57:19] never upset and I never have a bad day
[57:21] and you know, family is picture perfect.
[57:23] there's no problems or conflicts or you
[57:26] know conflicts or issues then I've I'm
[57:29] there.
[57:30] It ain't the case. It ain't the case
[57:34] because perfection is not flawlessness.
[57:36] Perfection is being covered in the blood
[57:39] sealed by the Holy Ghost. That is
[57:41] perfection.
[57:42] Amen. Cuz we're we're always going to be
[57:44] this bad skin will be changed one day.
[57:47] But in the meantime, we're living in it.
[57:50] Amen. But I don't believe the badger
[57:52] skin is any excuse to stop God living.
[57:56] Amen. It didn't stop God dwelling in the
[57:58] tabernacle. Same old skin. I I'm
[58:00] probably want to emphasize this bit
[58:01] because you know there's a problem is
[58:03] things can rise up and people can
[58:05] diminish the power of God to overcome
[58:07] all things. I think we've got to
[58:08] actually elevate God to really who he
[58:11] really is. Amen. Give him praise due
[58:13] unto his name as the scripture says. And
[58:15] he has the name above all names. I mean
[58:17] there's nothing. What's going on here?
[58:19] I'm getting a bit pinned. I don't know.
[58:20] Okay, maybe I'll take this off. I'm
[58:23] being all hooked up. Amen. But the bride
[58:26] of Jesus Christ is unhooked.
[58:28] I think I'm good now. I don't know.
[58:32] God bless good deacons, eh?
[58:36] Always here to sort me out. Thank you.
[58:38] Amen. But you see, you know, perfection
[58:40] is Christ dwelling in you. Praise the
[58:42] Lord.
[58:44] Amen. But you see, the devil has always
[58:47] misunderstood where God is.
[58:50] Amen. When Jesus was led to the um you
[58:53] know into the wilderness to be tempted,
[58:55] he says, "If thou be the son of God,"
[58:57] you see, the devil wasn't sure. He
[58:59] didn't say, "I know you're the son of
[59:00] God. If you be, prove it. Show me
[59:02] something." Because he wasn't sure. He
[59:04] wasn't It wasn't 100% in his mind, yes,
[59:06] this is Messiah. Cuz he looked like
[59:08] anyone else. It was the badger skins
[59:10] that stumbled him. Amen. It's the badger
[59:12] skins that will stumble him with you,
[59:14] your humanity. Cuz how could God,
[59:16] remember, he's been in the presence of
[59:18] God. He seen God on his throne in his
[59:21] majesty. He thinks, "How on earth can
[59:23] that great God come and dwell in a
[59:26] people such as you and I?" How could he
[59:29] do it? It just doesn't make sense to
[59:30] him. Because he's higher than the
[59:32] heavens, greater than the great. Even
[59:33] the angels are dirty in his sight.
[59:35] That's how holy he is. So, how on earth
[59:37] could that same God come and dwell in a
[59:39] people born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[59:41] come to the world speaking lies? How
[59:42] could God be veiled behind those kind of
[59:44] people? See, he does not understand the
[59:47] power of the blood. I mean, he does not
[59:49] s understand the cleansing, delivering
[59:52] power of the blood of Jesus Christ. He
[59:54] doesn't fathom it. He doesn't understand
[59:56] how that could have such power to
[59:58] cleanse a person. Amen. To dethrone
[1:00:00] Satan out of their lives and cleanse
[1:00:02] them so the holy God can dwell in a
[1:00:05] people. Amen. And make them holy. See,
[1:00:08] it's not us that's holy. It's the holy
[1:00:09] God in the people that make the people
[1:00:11] holy. Amen. Praise the Lord. says, "If
[1:00:14] thou be the son of God, if thou be." And
[1:00:17] then when Jesus comes to the end of his
[1:00:19] earthly ministry, if I can put it this
[1:00:20] way, he's hanging on the cross and that
[1:00:23] same devil is now in the scribes and
[1:00:25] Pharisees inspiring them to say, "If
[1:00:27] thou be the son of God, come off the
[1:00:29] cross and then we'll believe you." He
[1:00:31] was still looking for something
[1:00:34] to, you know, to see how could how could
[1:00:37] this be God? But it was. And it is.
[1:00:42] Hallelujah. Jesus would be asked, he
[1:00:44] would be um uh tested by the um scribes
[1:00:47] and Pharisees about playing about paying
[1:00:49] taxes to Caesar. And then so he asked
[1:00:53] for a penny and on that penny's got the
[1:00:56] got the um image of Caesar on it. So
[1:00:59] here was the image of the invisible God
[1:01:01] holding up the image of Caesar on a
[1:01:03] coin. And the religious leaders who
[1:01:05] should have known who God was could
[1:01:07] identify Caesar's image, but they could
[1:01:09] not identify the image of God in flesh.
[1:01:12] They stumbled at it because he looks so
[1:01:14] common. He looks so normal. Is everyone
[1:01:16] here today? Yeah. I just We Okay. Yep.
[1:01:20] Because this parallels with you.
[1:01:23] Amen. You say, "Well, that was God and
[1:01:26] his son." Well, God's in his bride.
[1:01:29] Same God, not a lesser God, not a
[1:01:31] different God. He's the same God.
[1:01:34] Amen. It says in John, "In the beginning
[1:01:36] was the word. The word was with God and
[1:01:38] the word was God. The same was in the
[1:01:40] beginning with God. All things were made
[1:01:42] by him and without him was not anything
[1:01:43] made that was made. And the word was
[1:01:45] made flesh and dwelt among us. And we
[1:01:47] beheld his glory. The glory is the only
[1:01:49] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:01:51] truth. John could write this because the
[1:01:54] veil didn't stumble him because he was
[1:01:55] part of part of God. Right? Now the word
[1:01:58] became flesh. That that great being
[1:02:01] became flesh. The one who filled all
[1:02:04] time and space, the eternal one became
[1:02:07] flesh and dwelt among them.
[1:02:10] I don't think it's too far to say and
[1:02:11] that same word becomes flesh in you.
[1:02:15] Remember the difference is Jesus did not
[1:02:16] need redeeming. Right? We're not saved.
[1:02:19] Brother Bam even makes a statement, you
[1:02:21] know, he says um he says he says we're
[1:02:24] not saved by we're not saved by Jewish
[1:02:27] blood. We're not saved by Gentile blood.
[1:02:30] No, it was the blood of God that was
[1:02:34] shed. Amen. It wasn't a gentile. We're
[1:02:36] not saved. You know, he says here about,
[1:02:37] you know, how Billy Graham would stand
[1:02:38] there and say, "Yeah, I've um, you know,
[1:02:40] I worship one of your children." Talking
[1:02:42] to the Jews. But, Brother Graham said,
[1:02:44] you know, I'm glad you can stand there
[1:02:45] in that power and speak that way and
[1:02:46] have that testimony. But he was not a
[1:02:48] Jew. He was not a Jew. He was God,
[1:02:51] Emmanuel. God became flesh. I'm laboring
[1:02:53] these points because I want you to see
[1:02:55] because because people say, "Well,
[1:02:56] what's the difference in between Jesus
[1:02:58] and you and I?" He was God. He did not
[1:03:01] need redeeming. He was the He is the
[1:03:04] redeemer. Amen. He did not need
[1:03:06] salvation. Did not need to surrender his
[1:03:08] life and be clean. Cleansed and clean.
[1:03:10] No, he was the cleaner. Amen. He was the
[1:03:13] cleanser, the redeemer. The one who
[1:03:14] could washes wash all sin away and
[1:03:16] transform a people. Amen. So, so that's
[1:03:19] the difference between us and him. We
[1:03:22] needed a savior. Amen. Before we needed
[1:03:25] saving, he was the savior. Amen. We
[1:03:27] needed redeeming before we Yeah. But he
[1:03:29] was the redeemer before we needed
[1:03:31] redeeming. So, he was always there in
[1:03:34] that manner. Then he became flesh to
[1:03:35] manifest his redemption. So we're saved
[1:03:38] by the blood of God. Even the Apostle
[1:03:39] Paul would say, "Take heed therefore
[1:03:41] unto yourselves and to all the flock
[1:03:43] over which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:03:45] overseers to feed the church of God
[1:03:48] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:03:50] blood." It was the blood of God that was
[1:03:52] shed. Amen. He cleansed that. So he was
[1:03:55] dwelling in there
[1:03:57] to redeem us. Then the same God comes by
[1:04:00] that cleanses you and dwells in you. Do
[1:04:03] you say the word has become flesh in his
[1:04:06] people now? Amen. Says it's far more
[1:04:08] than a good vibe, a religious spirit.
[1:04:11] No, this is God dwelling in you and I.
[1:04:14] God is in his people once again.
[1:04:17] Amen.
[1:04:19] Hallelujah. See, it's all about what is
[1:04:21] behind the skin that matters. That's the
[1:04:24] only thing that counts. He says, "Now
[1:04:25] the glory of God is behind your skin."
[1:04:29] See, it was controversial in Jesus' day,
[1:04:31] but now we can look back in history and
[1:04:33] say, "Yes, of course, that was God was
[1:04:34] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:04:36] himself." But now, what about the
[1:04:38] believer today? You see, since the glory
[1:04:40] of God was behind his skin to redeem us,
[1:04:43] but then we needed but in the redeemed
[1:04:46] now the glory of God is hidden behind
[1:04:48] our skin. I mean, that's right. And the
[1:04:50] traditions don't see it. It's inside the
[1:04:52] veil where his word was. What was on the
[1:04:54] inside of the skin back there? the old
[1:04:55] badger skins which there was no beauty
[1:04:58] that we should desire it and when it was
[1:05:00] made flesh and dwelt among us there was
[1:05:02] still no beauty that we should desire it
[1:05:03] and now the same thing is today there's
[1:05:05] nothing in a man or a woman that can be
[1:05:07] desired it's what's behind in there in
[1:05:10] in behind there that's what it is you
[1:05:11] say oh that fellow I know he used to be
[1:05:13] a drunkard he used to be this I don't
[1:05:15] care what he used to do what's behind
[1:05:17] that skin it is what's behind there
[1:05:19] that's what counts that's what the
[1:05:21] people is blinded the skin blinds the
[1:05:23] people see you I remember when that
[1:05:26] woman used to do I know what she used to
[1:05:28] do. And what about now? See them skins
[1:05:30] that was once on a badger, but now it's
[1:05:32] hiding the glory of God. It got God
[1:05:34] house got it housed behind it. It was on
[1:05:37] an animal, but now it's housing the
[1:05:39] glory of God. So So can your skin be
[1:05:41] changed not to be made a housing place
[1:05:43] for God? God dwelling in human humanity.
[1:05:48] Amen. So it doesn't matter what what the
[1:05:50] veil or the skin started as. It's how it
[1:05:53] ends up. What's behind it now? Amen.
[1:05:56] Moses was a murderer.
[1:05:59] God used him to deliver Israel. He says,
[1:06:01] "I've heard the cries of my people. I
[1:06:03] have come down to deliver them and I'm
[1:06:04] sending you Moses." So what? God stepped
[1:06:06] into Moses to deliver his people. Amen.
[1:06:09] Peter was an attempted murderer in the
[1:06:11] Garden of Gethsemane. That didn't change
[1:06:13] God's plan for his life. So it's not
[1:06:14] what we start off as, it's what we end
[1:06:16] up as that matters. Amen. Because what
[1:06:18] we end up as is really what we're meant
[1:06:20] to be. Amen. Peter was not meant to be
[1:06:23] an attempted murderer, fisherman. No, he
[1:06:25] was ordained to be the to the to be the
[1:06:28] apostle with the keys to the kingdom.
[1:06:30] Right? The woman at the well wasn't
[1:06:31] ordained to be the woman at the well.
[1:06:33] She was ordained to be a trophy of God's
[1:06:35] grace made in his image. Amen. As the
[1:06:37] bride of Jesus Christ. And so we are the
[1:06:40] same way. Amen. So let's leave our past
[1:06:42] behind. Let's leave our current what we
[1:06:45] think about our veil. Let's put it to
[1:06:47] one side. Where it's been, what it's
[1:06:49] done, God don't recognize it. Amen. If
[1:06:52] it's been confessed under the blood of
[1:06:54] Jesus Christ, he don't remember. No.
[1:06:56] That part of, you know, that that part
[1:06:58] of your life has been wiped away. It's
[1:07:00] gone. It's not in his memory. It's not
[1:07:02] in his record. It's not in his archives.
[1:07:04] Why wrestle with it?
[1:07:07] Oh, you don't know what I've done. But
[1:07:09] do you realize what he has done? Do you
[1:07:12] realize what he has done? You're looking
[1:07:14] at the wrong person. No. Look at your
[1:07:16] redeemer. Look what he has done. That's
[1:07:18] the only thing that ever will stand.
[1:07:22] Hallelujah.
[1:07:23] Amen. What does he say here in 2
[1:07:25] Corinthians 5? He says, "And what
[1:07:26] agreement have the temple of God with
[1:07:28] idols? For ye are the temple of the
[1:07:30] living God." Amen. As God hath said, I
[1:07:33] will dwell in them and walk in them.
[1:07:35] Amen. And I will be their God, and they
[1:07:37] shall be my people. Amen. So, where's
[1:07:39] God going to walk? He ain't in the
[1:07:41] temple no more. He's not in the
[1:07:42] tabernacle in the wilderness. go. He
[1:07:43] says, "I want to walk in my people."
[1:07:46] Amen. When they go to school, I'm
[1:07:47] walking with them to school. When they
[1:07:49] go to their job, I'm walking in them to
[1:07:51] their job. When they go to the
[1:07:52] supermarket, I'm going to walk in them.
[1:07:55] Amen. Even into the mall, I'll walk into
[1:07:57] the mall. Hallelujah. That's why he
[1:07:59] said, "I'm going to dwell in them. The
[1:08:00] almighty God," that's why he says here,
[1:08:02] "Wherefore come out from among them. Be
[1:08:04] ye separate, sayeth the Lord. Touch not
[1:08:06] the unclean thing, and I'll receive
[1:08:07] you." Amen. What? Be spiritually
[1:08:09] separated from these things. You be in
[1:08:11] the world but not of the world. And I'll
[1:08:13] be a father unto you, and you shall be
[1:08:15] my sons and daughters, saith the Lord
[1:08:17] Almighty.
[1:08:19] It's not just a mighty one. The Lord
[1:08:21] Almighty, supreme one. Amen. Who made
[1:08:24] all things I'm going to walk in you.
[1:08:26] That's the power of my blood to cleanse
[1:08:28] you, to wash all sin away, take sin
[1:08:30] nature out. Amen. To do such a work in
[1:08:32] you that I can walk in you. I can dwell
[1:08:35] in you. Not just anoint you for a season
[1:08:37] and leave. No. dwelling continuously in
[1:08:40] you.
[1:08:41] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You say,
[1:08:43] "Well, that's pretty far-fetched." No,
[1:08:45] it's not. Because when when when um you
[1:08:47] know, Saul was knocked off his high
[1:08:49] horse on the way to Damascus, Jesus
[1:08:51] asked him, the bright shining light, you
[1:08:53] know, spoke to him and says, "Who are
[1:08:54] you?" He says, "Who are you, Lord?" He
[1:08:56] says, "I am Jesus whom thou
[1:08:58] persecuteth." The apostle, you know,
[1:09:00] Saul wasn't chasing after the pillar of
[1:09:02] fire trying to find him to put him in
[1:09:05] jail. He was finding badger skins that
[1:09:07] he'd been redeemed. He was finding
[1:09:09] humanity that had been redeemed.
[1:09:10] Christians that he couldn't, you know,
[1:09:12] you know, the veil stumbled him, but but
[1:09:14] he was after them. But who was in them?
[1:09:17] I'm Jesus whom you're persecuting.
[1:09:20] You're actually coming against the Lord
[1:09:21] God Almighty. When you come against his
[1:09:23] bride, this is what the Lord says about
[1:09:25] them. He says the same thing about you.
[1:09:27] Cuz you're the you're under the same
[1:09:29] blood, under the same atonement. Amen.
[1:09:31] You're cleansed the same way, filled
[1:09:32] with the same Holy Ghost. I trust you
[1:09:34] are. Amen. So it's the same one. So Saul
[1:09:37] was persecuting Jesus in flesh though he
[1:09:41] didn't realize it. Jesus is in his
[1:09:43] people once again.
[1:09:46] I mean you know like brother Ram says
[1:09:48] about the he says about the spoonful of
[1:09:49] the ocean. He says you know cuz people
[1:09:51] can't fathom how can God be in a people
[1:09:53] like this. He says all that the water
[1:09:55] was in him that's comparison with the
[1:09:57] blessing the measure of the spirit that
[1:09:58] God gave him. now and his servants and
[1:10:00] the ministers and we are just a spoonful
[1:10:02] of the water in comparison to the ocean
[1:10:04] or the sea. But the same chemicals
[1:10:06] that's in the whole ocean is in that
[1:10:08] spoonful too. See? See? So it's got to
[1:10:11] produce the same thing if it comes from
[1:10:12] the same place. Amen. So so that big
[1:10:16] fountain of you know the spirit of God
[1:10:19] that's in us like he says you take a
[1:10:21] spoonful you know you take a spoon go to
[1:10:23] the Pacific Ocean out here the Tasmin
[1:10:24] Sea you pick it up. the same chemicals,
[1:10:27] the same quality, the same ability, the
[1:10:29] same ocean is in the spoon as it is in
[1:10:31] the ocean. It doesn't diminish because
[1:10:34] it's now in a different vessel. You see
[1:10:35] there that you know the you the water in
[1:10:37] that spoon is exactly the same water. It
[1:10:39] doesn't become less. It doesn't become
[1:10:42] weaker. It doesn't become more dilute in
[1:10:44] power and potency and ability. It
[1:10:46] doesn't become any of those things when
[1:10:48] it's in the spoon. It's the same thing
[1:10:50] with the Holy Ghost. It doesn't become
[1:10:51] weaker because it's in you. I mean, it's
[1:10:53] the Lord God Almighty. Remember, it's
[1:10:55] not just any old spirit. It's God
[1:10:57] himself. So when he comes and dwells in
[1:10:59] you, he doesn't get weaker. He doesn't
[1:11:01] get more feeble. He doesn't get more
[1:11:03] unable to fulfill his word. He's exactly
[1:11:06] the same God who stood there and said,
[1:11:08] "Let there be sun, moon, and stars." And
[1:11:10] believed his own word, and here it is in
[1:11:12] front of it. Here it is material, right?
[1:11:14] That same God comes and dwells in you.
[1:11:17] Amen. Has the same power, has the same
[1:11:19] ability, has the same capability to
[1:11:22] fulfill his word as he was then. Amen.
[1:11:24] Cuz it's the same God.
[1:11:27] Why do we diminish? Because the spoon
[1:11:29] that it's held in, the spoon, right? The
[1:11:33] vessel that he's in. Why do we diminish
[1:11:35] him? Because he's in us. I don't know if
[1:11:37] God can really do it. Is he still God?
[1:11:40] Does he have the same ability? Can he
[1:11:43] not move mountains? Can he not do
[1:11:45] impossible things? I mean, can he not
[1:11:47] move the hearts of man to change things?
[1:11:49] There's been people have to leave New
[1:11:51] Zealand because of less of immigration
[1:11:53] problems. And here's someone who has
[1:11:55] never set foot in the country.
[1:11:56] Impossible. But God moves the hearts of
[1:11:58] people. And somehow they just say, "This
[1:12:00] has never been done before, but yes,
[1:12:02] I'll do it." Hallelujah. Can he not do
[1:12:04] that in every other circumstance that
[1:12:06] we're fighting? I mean, can't can't he
[1:12:08] change hearts of people? Can he not do
[1:12:10] the impossible? You say, "Well, I can't
[1:12:12] do it." Of course, you can't do it.
[1:12:14] You're just the bad skin. But he's the
[1:12:17] Lord God Almighty. Amen. And if he
[1:12:19] dwelleth in you, he just wants to take
[1:12:21] your badger skin lips and speak his word
[1:12:23] through you. Amen. And then the
[1:12:25] supernatural will take place.
[1:12:27] Hallelujah. I like that. Don't you?
[1:12:31] Praise the Lord. Because therefore, I'm
[1:12:33] not trusting in me. I'm just the
[1:12:35] housing. It's the contents that matters.
[1:12:39] Amen. And with that contents, all things
[1:12:41] are possible.
[1:12:43] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. He says, he
[1:12:46] says here, he says, "I will be with you
[1:12:50] all the way, even to the end of the
[1:12:51] world." You know, brother said, "That's
[1:12:53] a personal pronoun." He says, "You think
[1:12:55] about it differently, but he says, "No,
[1:12:56] I Who's that? Jesus Christ, the Lord God
[1:12:59] Almighty, will be with you till the end
[1:13:01] of the world." Not a different God, not
[1:13:03] a lesser God, the same God who made all
[1:13:07] things.
[1:13:10] Amen. That's why
[1:13:12] there's this mystery. says, "Even the
[1:13:14] mystery which has been hid from the ages
[1:13:15] and from generations,
[1:13:18] but is now made manifest to his saints,
[1:13:20] to whom God hath made known what is the
[1:13:23] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:13:25] among the Gentiles, which is Christ in
[1:13:27] you, the hope of glory." Amen. What is
[1:13:30] that? The Lord God Almighty in you, the
[1:13:33] hope of glory. See, it's not a just a
[1:13:35] religious spirit. I I I want to repeat
[1:13:37] these things cuz subconsciously by
[1:13:39] listening to the church world out there,
[1:13:41] we think that the Holy Ghost is some
[1:13:43] little errand boy that is not very
[1:13:46] strong. And no, he's not God, but he is
[1:13:49] God. He's separate to God, but he's God
[1:13:51] and he's in me. That makes it okay. But
[1:13:53] if you say God's in you, that's now
[1:13:55] heresy. It ain't heresy. It's the gospel
[1:13:57] that God would dwell in man. The
[1:13:59] Almighty would dwell in man. Amen. So,
[1:14:01] so, so this mystery has been made known.
[1:14:04] This this is what the message of the
[1:14:05] hour is. Christ in you the hope of
[1:14:07] glory. Amen. That God would dwell in
[1:14:09] you, redeem you, cleanse you, manifest
[1:14:12] his word through you, prove his word
[1:14:14] through you. Amen. Cuz you think about
[1:14:17] the same faith. Well, we'll come to it
[1:14:19] soon. But let's just read this. He says
[1:14:22] in John 14, I hope you don't mind the
[1:14:24] reading, but I just want to pack this in
[1:14:25] because I want to show you I'm not
[1:14:26] pulling things out of nothing, right? He
[1:14:29] says, "Even the spirit of truth whom the
[1:14:30] world cannot receive." This is the Lord
[1:14:32] Jesus speaking. Because he it seeth him
[1:14:34] not, neither knoweth him. But ye know
[1:14:36] him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall
[1:14:37] be in you. I'll not leave you
[1:14:39] comfortless, I will come to you. Yet a
[1:14:42] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:14:43] more, but ye shall see me. Because I
[1:14:46] live, you shall live also. At that day
[1:14:49] you shall know that I am in the father
[1:14:50] and ye in me and I in you. So you're
[1:14:53] saying that the world won't see me, but
[1:14:55] you're going to see me. The believer
[1:14:57] will see Jesus Christ. We'll see the
[1:14:59] Messiah. will see the resurrected one.
[1:15:01] Why? Because we live also. He says, "In
[1:15:03] that day when you see him, you'll know
[1:15:05] that I am in the Father, and I in you,
[1:15:07] and you and me." There's a oneness.
[1:15:10] He that hath my commandments and keepeth
[1:15:12] them, he it is that loveth me, and he
[1:15:14] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:15:15] father, and I will love him, and will
[1:15:17] manifest myself to him. I'm going to
[1:15:20] reveal myself. I'm going to prove myself
[1:15:22] to them. Now, the Apostle Paul
[1:15:27] says this, let's just break down this
[1:15:28] statement. Nevertheless, so I'm
[1:15:30] crucified with Christ.
[1:15:34] Okay, it's no longer me living.
[1:15:37] Nevertheless, I live. So he says, "This
[1:15:39] thing is dead, but it's still alive."
[1:15:42] There's a badge of skin, right? Yet not
[1:15:44] I, but Christ liveth in me. So he's
[1:15:47] saying the almighty one lives in me.
[1:15:50] It's not me living, but I'm living, but
[1:15:52] it's Christ. So, so his old carnal
[1:15:54] nature is now gone. as now God has set
[1:15:57] up residence, right? And the life which
[1:16:00] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[1:16:03] faith of the son of God. So his life
[1:16:05] he's now living, he's living by the
[1:16:07] almighty one dwelling in him. Amen.
[1:16:10] Amen. And he lives it by the faith of
[1:16:12] the son of God. So that so that same
[1:16:13] faith is creation faith. That same faith
[1:16:17] spoke the universe into existence. That
[1:16:20] same faith, amen, brought Lazarus from
[1:16:22] the grave. That same faith, amen,
[1:16:25] conquered hell, death, and the grave.
[1:16:27] That same faith cast out devils. That
[1:16:29] same faith healed the sick. That same
[1:16:32] faith, amen, brought the word to pass.
[1:16:34] He says, I'm living by that faith. I'm
[1:16:36] not just living by a human. I hope it's
[1:16:38] going to work. No, he's living by that
[1:16:40] revelation that the Almighty now dwells
[1:16:43] within him.
[1:16:45] Amen. Who loved me and gave himself for
[1:16:47] me. To me, it's a, you know, we can just
[1:16:50] read the statement, but but if we really
[1:16:51] see the potency of it, the Apostle
[1:16:53] Paul's declaring to a world, the
[1:16:56] Almighty is in me. I'm living by the
[1:16:58] faith of the son of God. That same faith
[1:17:00] that said, let there be sun, moon, and
[1:17:02] stars. He believed his own word and it
[1:17:03] came material. He's living by that
[1:17:05] faith. So, it's not just a limited
[1:17:07] faith. It's an unlimited faith.
[1:17:11] Amen.
[1:17:13] Praise the Lord. Now we began in the
[1:17:16] beginning with John chapter 10 where
[1:17:18] Jesus said that I and my father are one.
[1:17:21] Now Jesus would pray in John 17 and now
[1:17:24] I'm no more in the world but these are
[1:17:25] in the world and I come to thee holy
[1:17:27] father keep keep through thine own name
[1:17:30] those who thou hast given me. Remember
[1:17:33] he says all that the father has given me
[1:17:35] will come to me. I have other sheep of
[1:17:37] this fold that must come in. So he's not
[1:17:39] just talking about his disciples. He's
[1:17:40] talking about as believers down through
[1:17:41] the ages that they may be one as we are.
[1:17:47] The church world wants to make it a
[1:17:48] perfect oneness of just a ecumenical
[1:17:50] interdenominational oneness. But that's
[1:17:52] not oneness because you got to forfeit
[1:17:54] what you believe to accept something
[1:17:55] else. And the Catholics won't change
[1:17:57] what they believe anyway. Everyone's got
[1:17:58] to surrender to what they actually do.
[1:18:01] Right? But this oneness is not a we all
[1:18:03] get along. No, the oneness is I'm in the
[1:18:06] father. He and me and I in him. I and my
[1:18:08] father are one. That's the oneness he's
[1:18:10] he's he's wanting for you and I. That
[1:18:14] when you see the bride, you see the
[1:18:15] father. Is this okay? Maybe I hope the
[1:18:18] terminology is not stumbling people, but
[1:18:20] but you see when people see you, they
[1:18:22] should see Jesus in flesh. When they see
[1:18:25] me, they should see Jesus Christ in
[1:18:27] flesh. They not they might not be able
[1:18:29] to actually fathom who's living there
[1:18:31] cuz we're still our humanity. The badger
[1:18:33] skin is still operating, right? But
[1:18:35] within it is deity. Amen. Right. But
[1:18:37] then but then they should be able but
[1:18:39] people should when they see you they
[1:18:41] should come in contact with more than
[1:18:42] your badge of skin. They should come in
[1:18:44] contact with the Lord God Almighty
[1:18:47] because that's what Jesus said. I and my
[1:18:48] father are one. And that's and that's
[1:18:50] why the message gets stoned today
[1:18:53] because it goes beyond oh yes the Holy
[1:18:55] Ghost is in me like a trinitarian idea.
[1:18:59] No we say no the almighty God is in me
[1:19:04] and and it's not for good works. It's
[1:19:05] not that people come and get healed. The
[1:19:06] supernatural is done that people want to
[1:19:08] stone this message. It's the fact that
[1:19:10] it reveals what the gospel actually
[1:19:12] teaches is that God would be in man once
[1:19:14] again. People can't stomach that. But
[1:19:17] it's the Bible. So it tastes pretty good
[1:19:19] to me, right? I'm happy it's not just
[1:19:22] some relig not just a part of God in me.
[1:19:24] It's all that he is is in me. Amen. It's
[1:19:26] the supreme one. He is supreme in heaven
[1:19:29] and he cast out the devil in heaven. He
[1:19:31] came down to earth. He is supreme upon
[1:19:33] the earth. He went down to hell. He was
[1:19:35] supreme down there. He rose up
[1:19:37] triumphant over hell, death, and the
[1:19:38] grave to show he's supreme. He comes
[1:19:40] into your life to show I'm supreme in
[1:19:43] your situation in Lady Oier and Satan's
[1:19:45] Eden. I'll show you my supremacy over
[1:19:48] all the devil's works and I'll do it in
[1:19:50] you.
[1:19:52] Hallelujah. So, we're not just a outlook
[1:19:54] at you know, you know, we see it in our
[1:19:57] lives. Amen. Brother Bram says the seed
[1:19:59] is not air with the shook. Hold I just
[1:20:02] Where is it now? Sorry.
[1:20:05] He says here, "But when you come to say,
[1:20:08] I and my father are one." Are you
[1:20:10] calling yourself God? No. I'm calling
[1:20:12] I'm saying God is in me. Remember this
[1:20:15] badge of skin is not the redeemer.
[1:20:17] Jesus is the redeemer. I'm the redeemed.
[1:20:21] He cleansed me to live in me. So I'm the
[1:20:24] redeemed. Amen. But when you come to say
[1:20:26] I and my father are one and these other
[1:20:28] things and the shucks pull away. But the
[1:20:31] real genuine bride church will bring
[1:20:32] forth the entire word of God in its
[1:20:34] fullness and in its strength for he is
[1:20:36] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:20:40] Amen. So it's more than just a thing cuz
[1:20:41] others have risen up saying look I my
[1:20:43] father are one but it's still bad your
[1:20:45] skin religious life running around
[1:20:46] causing trouble. Amen. But there's a
[1:20:48] real genuine bride that's come upon the
[1:20:50] scene in these last days that actually
[1:20:52] will bring forth the entire word of God
[1:20:54] in its strength and in its fullness. So
[1:20:56] it's more than just saying, "I, my
[1:20:58] father, are one." There's a life within
[1:21:00] them that proves it.
[1:21:03] Amen. I believe I'm looking at these
[1:21:05] kind of people.
[1:21:07] Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] Amen. He says, he says it was so the
[1:21:11] fullness of the Godhead bodily was in
[1:21:13] Jesus Christ. Now the fullness of the
[1:21:16] godhead bodily is in men. So it wasn't a
[1:21:19] man, now it's in men. It's like it's
[1:21:21] like, you know, when brother would quote
[1:21:23] from Luke 17:30, "In this day, the son
[1:21:25] of man will be revealed." He says, "The
[1:21:27] son of man is revealed in human beings."
[1:21:30] That's God. You say, "Oh, we need the
[1:21:32] prophet to come back." No, we don't. We
[1:21:35] need the God of the prophet, who is the
[1:21:37] God of the Bible, who is the Lord Jesus
[1:21:39] Christ. Because the same things that
[1:21:41] happened in his ministry, if the same
[1:21:43] God is in you, then the same word will
[1:21:45] be manifested. You say, "Will I become a
[1:21:48] prophet, have that kind of a gift?" Not
[1:21:49] necessarily. But the word will be will
[1:21:51] be manifested. What happened in his
[1:21:53] life? Nothing will stand before your
[1:21:55] prayers, not even cancer. If you get the
[1:21:57] people to believe you, nothing can stand
[1:22:00] before your prayers, not even cancer.
[1:22:01] Why? Because there's a faith that's
[1:22:03] built saying, "No, this man is giving
[1:22:04] the promise of the word." Then they take
[1:22:06] God at his word. Then nothing can stand
[1:22:08] before faith. Amen. So now if you take a
[1:22:10] group of people together that believe
[1:22:12] God, believe his word, Amen. then
[1:22:14] nothing can stand before their prayers.
[1:22:17] Amen. That commission wasn't just for
[1:22:19] brother Bram. It's for the bride of
[1:22:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:23] Amen. I think that's okay.
[1:22:27] Because you got to think about what can
[1:22:28] stand before faith. Cancer stand before
[1:22:31] faith.
[1:22:33] Amen. Where'd that go?
[1:22:35] Amen. It's gone. Hallelujah. Where'd it
[1:22:38] go? God took it away. Why? Because God
[1:22:41] was taken at his word. Amen. That's what
[1:22:45] and and we've been made in that same
[1:22:46] material. We can take God at his word.
[1:22:49] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:52] Now,
[1:22:55] Jesus said that he um you know, the
[1:22:57] Bible says that God was in Christ
[1:22:59] reconciling the world unto himself.
[1:23:01] Okay, I'm just wanting to make a segue
[1:23:03] here because we got to faith has got to
[1:23:04] be an action, which I believe it is. But
[1:23:07] let's just go this way. Now we've been
[1:23:10] given he has given unto us this ministry
[1:23:12] of reconciliation to it that God was in
[1:23:14] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:23:16] himself. Now what what does that
[1:23:18] reconciliation look like? Because the
[1:23:21] church world will just make it you
[1:23:23] receive that you know you accept what
[1:23:25] Jesus did for you on Calvary which you
[1:23:26] must and then now you're reconciled to
[1:23:29] God. It's far beyond that. It's because
[1:23:33] to be reconciled is is you become one
[1:23:36] again. And the only way you can become
[1:23:39] one again is when the God when the Lord
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ himself comes and dwells in
[1:23:43] you. That is true reconciliation. It's
[1:23:46] like we use the word atonement which is
[1:23:48] actually from the word at onement. So
[1:23:50] how do you how do you become at one with
[1:23:53] God? The only way you can become at one
[1:23:54] with God is his same he come and dwells
[1:23:57] in you. That is receiving the atonement.
[1:24:01] See many times we think of the atonement
[1:24:02] as just the blood sacrifice. That's part
[1:24:04] of it. But what does it produce? that
[1:24:07] the the life of the atonement, which is
[1:24:09] God, comes and lives in you. Amen. Are
[1:24:12] we are we together? See, you say, "I've
[1:24:14] received the atonement." What you're
[1:24:15] saying is, "I've received the true
[1:24:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and God
[1:24:19] dwells in my soul." That's what you're
[1:24:21] saying. Amen. But the church world says,
[1:24:23] "Well, I've just believed on the Lord
[1:24:25] Jesus, but there's been no
[1:24:26] transformation of life. God doesn't
[1:24:28] dwell there. It's still bad skins
[1:24:29] running around, right?" But the
[1:24:31] difference is when you truly receive the
[1:24:32] atonement, that's now God in you. you'll
[1:24:35] become one.
[1:24:37] At onement has happened.
[1:24:40] Amen. So this min so so this this um
[1:24:44] what do you call it? So this ministry of
[1:24:46] reconciliation has been given to you,
[1:24:49] right? That people would receive the
[1:24:51] true atonement. I'm laboring on these
[1:24:53] points. I just wanted to kind of sink
[1:24:54] in. We're just having a slow kind of a
[1:24:56] meal today. Okay? But I want this to
[1:24:58] sink in because you say, "Who's in you?
[1:24:59] What can it now do?" Okay? So now we've
[1:25:02] been given this ministry of
[1:25:03] reconciliation. So you can actually
[1:25:05] preach, you can live a life that people
[1:25:07] will be reconciled to God. Not
[1:25:10] reconciled to a church, not reconciled
[1:25:12] to a doctrine that's got, that's not
[1:25:14] even it. I mean, you can have all the
[1:25:16] doctrine, right? If you miss the life,
[1:25:17] you're not coming up anyway. But if you
[1:25:19] got the life, you've got everything,
[1:25:21] right? So this reconciliation now is God
[1:25:23] coming and dwelling in a people. And
[1:25:25] that's why brother Bram would say say
[1:25:27] that you know the greater works he that
[1:25:29] believeth on me you know these works and
[1:25:31] the greater works than than this shall
[1:25:33] he do because I go to my father that
[1:25:35] greater works is imparting eternal life.
[1:25:38] Amen. Because if God is in you then God
[1:25:41] can step he can reach from you to
[1:25:43] someone else. And what is he parting
[1:25:45] eternal life? They receive the Holy
[1:25:47] Ghost through the life that's within
[1:25:49] you. Amen. You know we talk about you
[1:25:51] know spirits jumping on people. What
[1:25:53] about the Holy Ghost jumping on people?
[1:25:55] I mean, what about being a, you know, we
[1:25:56] talk about, you know, when CO was here
[1:25:58] and a super spreader events where the
[1:26:00] virus just spreads because it becomes
[1:26:02] into proximity with people carrying the
[1:26:05] virus. Well, what about now? I'm not I'm
[1:26:07] not equating God to a virus, but you
[1:26:09] understand what I mean. What about now a
[1:26:11] super spreader event where people come
[1:26:12] in contact with you? They come in close
[1:26:15] proximity to the life of God within you
[1:26:17] and that life begins to spread. Amen.
[1:26:20] The Holy Ghost begins to jump on people
[1:26:22] where they begin begin to be convicted
[1:26:24] and they begin to realize there's more
[1:26:25] to life than what I'm living. And what's
[1:26:27] happening? The Holy Ghost is starting to
[1:26:29] infect them if I can, you know, I can't
[1:26:31] think of a better word, but he's
[1:26:32] starting to, you know, deal with them.
[1:26:34] What's that? You are actually being a
[1:26:36] super spreader. You're actually got a
[1:26:38] ministry of reconciliation. See, it's
[1:26:40] not necessarily being able to put it all
[1:26:42] together, right, and just have this
[1:26:44] really good kind of speech where you can
[1:26:45] give it and no, it's a life that's
[1:26:48] lived. Why? Because deity is behind your
[1:26:50] badge of skin. I mean, God himself has
[1:26:52] stepped in. And when you go and speak to
[1:26:54] someone, it's not you speaking. No,
[1:26:57] there's a shift. And it's God speaks
[1:26:58] through your lips. And what's happening
[1:27:00] now is eternal life begins to be
[1:27:02] imparted.
[1:27:04] Can you do that? Well, the son of God
[1:27:05] can. Amen. Hallelujah. And who is that?
[1:27:10] That's you and I. There's so much power
[1:27:12] within you. You know, brother Ram said
[1:27:14] that a Holy Ghost fil camp meeting does
[1:27:17] more for a country in terms of security
[1:27:19] than all the atomic bombs that country
[1:27:20] could have. Amen. What's keeping the
[1:27:22] wrath of God off this world? The Holy
[1:27:24] Ghost falling in believer's lives. Amen.
[1:27:28] Holy Ghost fililled services, God
[1:27:29] moving. Amen. The prosperity of a
[1:27:31] country is not an economic prosperity.
[1:27:34] No, it's a spiritual prosperity where
[1:27:36] God comes down, dwells in a people.
[1:27:38] That's the only thing that matters.
[1:27:40] Amen. You say, "Well, I want to make New
[1:27:42] Zealand great again." Let God live then.
[1:27:44] Amen. That will improve it. Not in a,
[1:27:47] you know, the prince of peace is who we
[1:27:49] need. But it's keeping the wrath of God
[1:27:51] off this world. God moving. And you see
[1:27:54] what's happening with Iran and, you
[1:27:55] know, Israel, that ain't going to end. I
[1:27:57] don't think that's just ramping up. And
[1:28:00] if that's ramping up, that mean the
[1:28:02] anointing's ramping up. That means the
[1:28:04] people who come to recognize who they
[1:28:05] are in Christ where they recognize that
[1:28:07] they are the tabernacle, the temple of
[1:28:10] the living God. Hallelujah.
[1:28:13] Amen. If you realize who is in you, then
[1:28:16] all things are possible. Everything is
[1:28:18] possible. There's nothing impossible. If
[1:28:20] the one who does the impossible is in
[1:28:22] you. Amen. That should just raise our
[1:28:24] faith that just goes through the roof
[1:28:26] through the atmosphere past Pluto if
[1:28:28] it's still a planet. You know, you know
[1:28:30] what I mean?
[1:28:31] But if we look at the badge of skin,
[1:28:33] well, how can you ever be that'll just
[1:28:35] lower expectation? That's why turn your
[1:28:37] eyes upon Jesus. Yes. Don't turn your
[1:28:40] eyes upon you.
[1:28:42] It's my issues. No, we'll cast them upon
[1:28:44] him. It's my problem. Cast them upon
[1:28:46] him. Don't keep it to yourself.
[1:28:51] But you see also the thing is that we
[1:28:53] must be able to discern the Lord's body.
[1:28:56] Now in 1 Corinthians 11, it says, "But
[1:28:57] let a man examine himself, so let him
[1:28:59] eat of that bread and drink of that cup,
[1:29:01] that when he eiteth and drinkkeeth
[1:29:02] unworthily, eateth and drinkketh
[1:29:04] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:29:06] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[1:29:08] weak and sickly among you and many
[1:29:10] sleep. Now he's not talking about the
[1:29:12] unleaven bread and the wine.
[1:29:14] That's symbolic of the body of the Lord.
[1:29:16] But it's not literally it does like the
[1:29:18] Catholics believe when the priest prays
[1:29:20] over the wafer and all these things. It
[1:29:21] literally becomes the flesh of God
[1:29:23] becomes the Holy Ghost. It becomes his
[1:29:25] body. They become cannibals.
[1:29:28] We don't believe that.
[1:29:30] No, that's what they believe. Okay. But
[1:29:34] so this discerning the Lord's body is
[1:29:36] actually discerning the Lord's body.
[1:29:40] Amen. And that's why many are sick and
[1:29:43] weak and sickly among the believers is
[1:29:45] because they're not discerning the
[1:29:47] Lord's body. Because if you think about
[1:29:49] it, if you actually have discernment
[1:29:51] behind that badge of skin as tabernacle
[1:29:54] deity, not just a religious spirit. No,
[1:29:57] God himself is now in that person.
[1:29:59] You'll be able because if you can
[1:30:01] discern behind that badger skin, doesn't
[1:30:03] matter what the bad skin's doing, behind
[1:30:05] that is God. Then why would you gossip
[1:30:07] about that bad skin? Why would you make
[1:30:10] fun of that bad skin? Why would you
[1:30:11] murder its influence? Why would you try
[1:30:13] and lead it astray into sin, into
[1:30:15] darkness and temptation? Why would you
[1:30:17] do those things?
[1:30:19] You wouldn't. You'd be No, my God is in
[1:30:22] that person. Like my God is in me. My
[1:30:25] God is in them. Amen. And when we come
[1:30:27] together, it's just more of God upon the
[1:30:29] earth, if I can put it that way. Amen.
[1:30:31] But he said, "That's why many are weak
[1:30:32] and sickly among us is because they
[1:30:34] allow a gossiping, murderous spirit to
[1:30:36] anoint them, to run down someone who's
[1:30:39] actually an adopted son or daughter of
[1:30:41] God." I would never do that. I'd say,
[1:30:44] "Take that trash and put it in the trash
[1:30:45] can. Take that acid and put it somewhere
[1:30:48] else because I ain't a vessel to receive
[1:30:49] acid or some nonsense." No, I'm the
[1:30:52] temple of the living God. Have you got
[1:30:54] nothing good to say about anyone? Don't
[1:30:56] say it at all.
[1:30:59] Amen. Does it help? No. Has gossip ever
[1:31:03] helped anyone?
[1:31:05] Murdering people's influence. Has it
[1:31:07] helped anyone? Because it always comes
[1:31:09] back to the one who's got the gun.
[1:31:12] So, we don't want to be sickly or weak.
[1:31:15] And it says many sleep. Actually, that
[1:31:16] actually means they're dead
[1:31:19] because they didn't discern the Lord's
[1:31:21] body. Oh, how could God be behind that
[1:31:24] sister or that brother? Careful. That's
[1:31:27] what the Pharisees said about the Lord
[1:31:29] Jesus who never put a foot wrong, never
[1:31:31] did a single thing wrong. They stumbled
[1:31:33] at him. Then how much more now? The
[1:31:36] redeemed.
[1:31:39] Amen. But you see now, I believe I'm
[1:31:42] looking at a group of people that can
[1:31:43] discern the Lord's body. They can
[1:31:46] discern that God dwells in people. Amen.
[1:31:48] I believe I can see it. You know, I
[1:31:50] believe we're that kind of a people.
[1:31:52] Amen. Now, brother makes a statement. He
[1:31:54] says, he says that this isn't Christ,
[1:31:56] the mystery of God revealed. He says,
[1:31:57] "Now, if a man says he's born again and
[1:31:59] to try and place those promises of
[1:32:01] Christ in the last days for some other
[1:32:03] age, make him Christ yesterday but not
[1:32:05] today, then that man or that woman has
[1:32:07] been in a delusion by Satan." And if
[1:32:09] that man says that he believes that and
[1:32:11] doesn't manifest itself through him,
[1:32:13] Jesus said in Mark 16, "These signs
[1:32:15] shall follow them that believe into all
[1:32:16] the world to every age, casting out
[1:32:18] devils, speaking with tongues, and all
[1:32:20] these great manifestations of gifts that
[1:32:22] that would follow that they shall not.
[1:32:24] They may be or they ought to, they will,
[1:32:26] and heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:32:28] but his word won't." So, it's Christ
[1:32:30] expressing himself in the individual,
[1:32:32] whether he's intellectual, whether he
[1:32:34] doesn't know his ABCs. Half the apostles
[1:32:36] did it. That's right. But they know
[1:32:38] Christ. They never taken heed to Peter
[1:32:40] and John knowing that they had been out
[1:32:42] of some seminary. They said they had
[1:32:44] taken heed and noticed they had been
[1:32:46] with Christ. When they healed the lame
[1:32:49] man, see at the gate they know that they
[1:32:51] had been with Christ. The new birth is
[1:32:54] Christ as a revelation. God has revealed
[1:32:56] to you this great mystery and that's the
[1:32:58] new birth. Now what are you going to do
[1:33:00] when you get all that group together?
[1:33:03] You know, many people have taken this
[1:33:04] quote and they've said, "Now, if we just
[1:33:06] get all the doctrinal ironed out and
[1:33:08] it's all the same in everyone's head,
[1:33:11] then what's going to happen?" He's not
[1:33:13] the the context is what do you do when
[1:33:16] you get that group of people all
[1:33:17] together that Christ is in them? That
[1:33:20] deity is now tabernacled in humanity.
[1:33:23] When you get a people that are truly
[1:33:24] spiritfilled, you get that group
[1:33:26] together. Amen. The revelation where the
[1:33:30] revelation is perfect in harmony. What's
[1:33:31] that revelation? Christ in you, the hope
[1:33:33] of glory. I'm not diminishing the seals
[1:33:35] or anything of the mysteries that have
[1:33:36] been opened up. But it's not mentally
[1:33:38] having those things correct that will
[1:33:41] bring God will actually bring power into
[1:33:43] the church for God to manifest himself
[1:33:45] in his fullness of his power. No, it's
[1:33:47] Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's
[1:33:49] God himself dwelling in the body of
[1:33:51] Christ. Amen. Now, when that revelation
[1:33:53] comes into harmony, we say, "I see God
[1:33:55] in you and God's in you. I see the word
[1:33:57] made flesh again." Amen. And then so now
[1:34:00] there's going to be a perfect harmony
[1:34:01] among those people. And God expressing
[1:34:03] his word by the same actions, the same
[1:34:05] things that he did, making the word
[1:34:07] manifest over the church and knew its
[1:34:09] position. Amen. As redeemed bad skins,
[1:34:13] God tabernacled in behind their skin.
[1:34:16] Amen. One day it will one day. Then the
[1:34:18] rapture will go when it knows what it
[1:34:20] is. The temple of the living God. Amen.
[1:34:24] The word made flesh. Nothing less than
[1:34:27] that. Amen. I believe it. I I believe
[1:34:30] the power of the blood in its fullness.
[1:34:32] Amen. I believe it. You know, if you
[1:34:34] make it anything less than, oh, God just
[1:34:36] forgives your sins by the blood. It's
[1:34:38] far more than that. He doesn't just
[1:34:40] forgive your sins. He takes away sin
[1:34:42] nature that he can dwell in you. That's
[1:34:44] what the atonement does. That the life
[1:34:46] of God comes and dwells in a people.
[1:34:49] Praise the Lord. Now, he says this. He
[1:34:51] says the deity of him, who is he? Some
[1:34:53] make him a little baby out there. Is it
[1:34:55] speaking of the Lord? He's the one that
[1:34:56] stood on the invisible. Oh my platform
[1:34:59] raised his hands and spoke, "Let there
[1:35:00] be light." There was light. That was
[1:35:02] Jesus Christ. For he was in the world
[1:35:04] and the world was made by him and the
[1:35:06] world recognized him not. He is the
[1:35:08] deity of God. Look what he did back
[1:35:10] there. Talk about the miraculous back
[1:35:11] there. You talk about shouting when he
[1:35:13] performed the miraculous things to make
[1:35:16] things which are now out of things which
[1:35:17] was not. He spoke and it was so. And
[1:35:20] that same power, that same Christ,
[1:35:22] hallelujah, let the fundamentalists, let
[1:35:23] the people who deny the power of God say
[1:35:25] it's wrong. But the same power that
[1:35:27] spoke the world into existence is in
[1:35:29] those people that's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:31] That's right, men and women. It's time
[1:35:32] we found out. We found out who we are.
[1:35:36] The devil's trying to hide you back,
[1:35:38] tell you you're some little cow down
[1:35:40] something. You're not. You're sons and
[1:35:42] daughters of God. Deity is not in
[1:35:44] heaven. It's in you. Amen. So, it's time
[1:35:46] we found out who we were. Amen. That's
[1:35:48] why I'm trying to preach these things
[1:35:49] this morning. We find out that we are
[1:35:50] not just some card back poor me and my
[1:35:52] problems and I'm never going to survive
[1:35:54] and I'm barely overcoming. I'm just
[1:35:56] scraping through. No, we're victorious.
[1:35:58] Amen. We we can are more than conquerors
[1:36:00] through him that first loved us. Amen.
[1:36:02] We are victorious because the victorious
[1:36:04] one, where does he dwell? In you and I.
[1:36:07] And if he conquered hell, death, and the
[1:36:08] grave. Amen. He can conquer your
[1:36:10] problems. You got to recognize they're
[1:36:12] already been conquered. I mean it
[1:36:13] doesn't matter if it's a complex there's
[1:36:15] division in the family or something the
[1:36:17] wedge of spirit whatever it is that's
[1:36:18] got in and causing trouble you realize
[1:36:20] that thing has got to come to an end the
[1:36:23] one in you has remember greater is he
[1:36:25] who's ever done physics or math says the
[1:36:27] greater sign right the thing that gets
[1:36:30] you know there's the greater than so the
[1:36:32] thing that's less than the thing that's
[1:36:34] greater can never beat the thing that's
[1:36:35] greater.
[1:36:37] Amen. Greater is he that's in you than
[1:36:40] he that's in the world. Amen. That means
[1:36:43] there's nothing in the world that's
[1:36:44] greater than your God. Hallelujah. So,
[1:36:47] we shouldn't be some little cow down
[1:36:48] thing. You say, "Well, I've had this
[1:36:50] problem all my life." It's got to come
[1:36:52] to an end. Amen. We can't just put up
[1:36:54] with it and and reason it. You see, the
[1:36:56] devil gives so much reasoning why he
[1:36:58] should stay. We got to give him the word
[1:37:00] that he should leave. Amen. You say,
[1:37:03] "Well, my parents are all unforgiving. I
[1:37:05] high passioned and I got this temp. I
[1:37:07] just get, you know, angry and I got
[1:37:09] tempers and it's way back in my family
[1:37:11] and I should be redheaded because that's
[1:37:13] the temperament I have and I can't
[1:37:15] forgive and it's all excuses. Well, this
[1:37:17] happened to me when I was young and this
[1:37:19] is my problem and this m up my life and
[1:37:22] all these things. I'm not diminishing
[1:37:24] those things, but what are you giving
[1:37:25] power to? It's actually your reasoning
[1:37:27] to let it stay. The devil actually is
[1:37:30] trying to give you a three-point plan.
[1:37:32] This is why I should live here. Who's
[1:37:34] ever had a difficult tenant or a
[1:37:36] difficult room, flatmate or whatever,
[1:37:37] and they try and give you reasoning when
[1:37:39] they realize they want to stay. They
[1:37:41] don't want to go. They try and say,
[1:37:43] "Look, I I should stay here." And
[1:37:46] they're causing a lot of pain. They're
[1:37:48] annoying.
[1:37:49] You know, you don't enjoy them being in
[1:37:51] your house, right? You really want them
[1:37:53] to go. If you listen to their reasoning,
[1:37:55] then you justify them actually dragging
[1:37:58] your life down into defeat. Right? Now,
[1:38:00] I'm using a spiritual thing now, right?
[1:38:02] So, so, so if you let the devil's
[1:38:04] reasoning rule your life, you know, this
[1:38:06] little addiction, no one sees it. It's
[1:38:08] some harmless fun. It's on your phone.
[1:38:10] It's locked away bit behind some secret
[1:38:12] chat thing and no one sees it and you
[1:38:14] know it's never going to cause any
[1:38:16] problems. You can you can control this.
[1:38:19] Your spouse doesn't need to know or
[1:38:21] whatever doesn't need to know. You can
[1:38:22] rule this thing. That's the devil giving
[1:38:24] you reasoning for him to stay in your
[1:38:27] life and to take the victory out of your
[1:38:29] life. you're letting him stay because
[1:38:31] well this is because this and this is
[1:38:33] why I'm here and I'm just going to stay
[1:38:34] this way. We're going to cast out
[1:38:36] reasoning. Doesn't matter what the
[1:38:38] problem is, the hurt, whatever it is.
[1:38:40] Don't let reasoning let it stay in your
[1:38:42] life. Let the victorious one defeat that
[1:38:45] thing. Cast it out. Give you victory
[1:38:48] that becomes a victory on your wall as
[1:38:50] opposed to something rule in your life.
[1:38:52] Some little card down person. Well, I'm
[1:38:54] just being humble. No, you're living in
[1:38:56] defeat.
[1:38:58] Humility is not people you oh you got to
[1:39:01] be a humble little Christian and no no
[1:39:02] we're not pushed around by the devil. We
[1:39:05] are not ordained or built to be pushed
[1:39:07] around by the devil. No, we're here to
[1:39:09] push him around. We're here to cast him
[1:39:11] out. Command him. Deity is not just in
[1:39:13] heaven. It's in you. Amen. So why don't
[1:39:15] you let deity rule your life? Take over
[1:39:18] your problems. Consume the enemy and
[1:39:20] walk out packing the victory. Amen. If
[1:39:22] he's behind your skin, I don't see how
[1:39:24] that could not happen. If he's not
[1:39:26] behind your skin, you say, "Lord, come
[1:39:27] and dwell in my soul and change me that
[1:39:29] I see victory in my life."
[1:39:32] Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] Amen. He's trying to hide you back, tell
[1:39:36] you you're a little cow down something
[1:39:37] you're not. Amen. You're a son and
[1:39:40] you're sons and daughters of God. Deity
[1:39:41] is not just in heaven. It's in you one
[1:39:43] day. No, now we are the sons of God
[1:39:46] right now. Right now, he's in flesh.
[1:39:50] God's in flesh. Amen. I'm going to
[1:39:52] finish with this with this. Um he says
[1:39:55] you're of God little children and have
[1:39:56] overcome them because greater is he
[1:39:58] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:39:59] world. Now this is my words. When you
[1:40:01] realize the almighty lives in you then
[1:40:03] that creates a faith that all things are
[1:40:05] possible. I mean you realize deity is in
[1:40:08] you. How can any complex hurt sickness
[1:40:10] or demon stand? It can't. I mean realize
[1:40:13] the one in you is not just a religious
[1:40:15] spirit trying to win. It's the Almighty
[1:40:17] who conquered hell, death and the grave
[1:40:19] and everything. Everything that can be
[1:40:21] named is under his feet. Amen. So if
[1:40:24] he's in you, where will it be? Under
[1:40:26] your feet. Hey, why? Cuz he's in you.
[1:40:28] Amen. The body of Christ is standing on
[1:40:30] the head of the devil. That's our
[1:40:32] ordained position. That's his ordained
[1:40:33] position. And if he's not in his
[1:40:35] position, God's given you a tongue. He's
[1:40:37] given you authority to say, "Get back in
[1:40:39] your place, boy."
[1:40:41] Amen. It's like go, you know, when I was
[1:40:43] young on my uncle's farms and things
[1:40:45] with the sheep dogs, they keep saying,
[1:40:46] "Get in behind." The dog would go in
[1:40:48] behind. He's running off somewhere. Get
[1:40:50] in behind. And what do we tell the
[1:40:51] devil? Get behind me, Satan. If you
[1:40:54] don't listen, I'm going to plague you.
[1:40:55] I'm going to I'm going to bring God's
[1:40:56] wrath upon you that you have to move.
[1:40:58] Brother Ram says that, you know, we can
[1:41:00] pray in such a way till the devil has to
[1:41:02] give in. Amen. That's what God said
[1:41:04] about you. You got prevailing power by
[1:41:06] the Holy Ghost. If God Almighty is in
[1:41:08] you, why put up with the devil's
[1:41:09] problems? Why put up with his reasoning,
[1:41:11] his lies, his complexes? Oh, but I'll
[1:41:14] get exposed. No, he's going to get
[1:41:16] exposed. He's going to get destroyed.
[1:41:18] You're not. So, why put up with his
[1:41:20] things? said, "Oh, you this is just me
[1:41:22] in my time of life." Why not? Amen.
[1:41:25] Expose him for what he is. Amen. And get
[1:41:28] him cast out. Amen. You see, as the body
[1:41:30] of Christ, we've got authority over
[1:41:32] every spirit. I'm just going to ram this
[1:41:33] home for a little bit. You got to
[1:41:34] realize, see, we put up with him too
[1:41:36] much.
[1:41:37] Oh, God's taking me through this, and
[1:41:39] God's allowed the spirit of my life to
[1:41:41] keep me humble. Who said that? Who said
[1:41:44] that? The Apostle Paul never had
[1:41:46] something that dragged him into sin.
[1:41:48] Kept some secret sin in his life and
[1:41:50] kept him defeated. Kept the devil
[1:41:52] bounding him that way. It wasn't that in
[1:41:54] his life. Amen. Amen. And God told him,
[1:41:57] "My grace is sufficient." Amen. So, we
[1:42:00] can't just say, "Well, I'm just, you
[1:42:01] know, God's keeping me humble by this."
[1:42:03] No. God doesn't use a whip to keep you
[1:42:05] humble. I mean, God doesn't keep you
[1:42:07] bowed down. That's the devil lying,
[1:42:08] trying to make you think that, no, you
[1:42:10] have to live under your privileges. No,
[1:42:12] but as the body of Jesus Christ, we
[1:42:14] should live according to our privileges.
[1:42:16] And that is the enemy under our feet.
[1:42:19] Amen.
[1:42:23] Unlimited faith dwells in me.
[1:42:27] Now,
[1:42:29] amen. All things are possible. God wants
[1:42:32] to use your lips. Well, how do I let him
[1:42:35] work? Just get yourself out of the way.
[1:42:37] Put your reasoning to one side. Put the
[1:42:39] put the time and the distance and the
[1:42:41] problems and the don't don't go by the
[1:42:43] five senses. Take God at his word. Don't
[1:42:47] live in fear. We got nothing to fear.
[1:42:49] I'm safe and secure. Amen. This place
[1:42:52] could explode right now. I know where
[1:42:53] I'm going. Why? Because the badger
[1:42:55] skin's so awesome. The badger skin's got
[1:42:57] nothing to do with it. This thing has
[1:42:59] nothing to rejoice in. It's just a
[1:43:01] badger skin. It's the one on the inside
[1:43:03] that we can glory in, that we can boast
[1:43:05] in. Deity within our badger skin. Amen.
[1:43:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We don't have to
[1:43:10] live in fear. We don't have to worry.
[1:43:11] Oh, the world's going to blow up. And
[1:43:12] who? We're saved. If you're under the
[1:43:14] blood, if you're truly under the blood
[1:43:15] of Jesus Christ and you realize it's not
[1:43:18] you, your badge of skin doesn't going to
[1:43:21] amount to anything. It's him on the
[1:43:23] inside of you. What do you have to fear?
[1:43:26] Well, what about my children? We have a
[1:43:28] token. I mean, we have the blood of
[1:43:30] Jesus Christ to apply. We have the life
[1:43:31] of God to apply. We don't have to fear
[1:43:33] that they'll be saved. We're going to
[1:43:35] have a confidence of fear. They won't be
[1:43:36] saved. Have confidence. Lord, you saved
[1:43:38] me. Now, you let that faith that saved
[1:43:40] you get a hold of them. And you see what
[1:43:42] God will do. And they get fussy and
[1:43:44] fighting and things. It's God bringing
[1:43:45] them under conviction. Hallelujah. So,
[1:43:47] we don't have the backup for the devil
[1:43:49] while they've been away too long. What's
[1:43:50] time to God? It was just a couple of
[1:43:52] days ago he was hanging on Calvary in
[1:43:55] his timing.
[1:43:57] We're still in the same week.
[1:43:58] Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe we need God to
[1:44:01] come like Mary by the tomb and call you
[1:44:03] by name. And then all your sadness and
[1:44:05] depression will turn into elation and
[1:44:07] joy. My redeemer liveth. Hallelujah.
[1:44:09] He's not just with me. He's in me.
[1:44:11] Hallelujah. Amen. I believe that's what
[1:44:14] God wants to do. He wants I'm sorry.
[1:44:16] I've gone over time. But I believe God
[1:44:17] wants to get a hold of our lives. Say,
[1:44:19] "Call you by name." Amen. You're not
[1:44:21] some downtrodden, troubled child. Amen.
[1:44:24] Know you're a son or daughter of God
[1:44:25] standing in victory. Amen. His blood
[1:44:28] still atones. His blood still works.
[1:44:29] Amen. His blood still cleanses. Amen.
[1:44:32] There's still prevailing power in the
[1:44:33] blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:44:36] There's no devil he can't defeat. No
[1:44:37] devil he can't cast out. There's no
[1:44:39] problem he can't fix. There's no
[1:44:40] situation too complex, too hard. No. God
[1:44:43] can step in in a moment and change
[1:44:45] everything. Hallelujah. I believe it.
[1:44:47] Amen. Why? Cuz he all things are
[1:44:49] possible. Amen. There's nothing. And he
[1:44:52] says there's nothing impossible with
[1:44:53] you. You say, "Well, is that my human
[1:44:56] faith trying to work it out?" No. It's
[1:44:57] taking God at his word. Recognize the
[1:44:59] one inside you, the the one who made
[1:45:02] sun, moon, and stars. The one who made
[1:45:03] your body now dwells in you. He's just
[1:45:05] going to take your lips, speak his word.
[1:45:08] Amen. It's the same as deity speaking.
[1:45:09] Every mountain has to move. Nothing can
[1:45:12] stand before that man or woman. Little
[1:45:14] old me. If we had time, you go through
[1:45:17] all the believers of the Bible. Who were
[1:45:19] they? Downcast, outward
[1:45:23] outwasher society. No great people. The
[1:45:26] only one who was great was the Apostle
[1:45:28] Paul. says, "I count it all but dung
[1:45:30] that I would know Christ." He had
[1:45:31] nothing to boast in where he came out
[1:45:33] of. He just by the grace of God, I am
[1:45:35] what I am. So why can't we think that
[1:45:38] God can't use us and live in us in the
[1:45:40] same measure, in the same way in this
[1:45:43] end time, the fullness of the power of
[1:45:44] his word be manifested through you and
[1:45:46] I. Amen. I believe we're on the cusp of
[1:45:48] great things. We believe that you know
[1:45:50] if we could really if God could drop in
[1:45:51] our hearts the power of his cleansing
[1:45:53] blood. I mean to cleanse a people that
[1:45:55] were vile and evil and did all kinds of
[1:45:58] wicked works in their lives that God
[1:45:59] would cleanse them in such a way that
[1:46:02] that holy God that the angels the Bible
[1:46:04] says even look dirty in his sight.
[1:46:06] That's how holy he is. Can come and
[1:46:07] dwell in your soul and live through your
[1:46:09] badge of skin.
[1:46:11] Hallelujah. Oh one day no now we are the
[1:46:14] sons and daughters of God. Why don't you
[1:46:16] let the word work in your life mightily?
[1:46:19] Amen. Why don't we take them at his word
[1:46:20] like never before? Don't take our
[1:46:22] complexes at their word. Don't take the
[1:46:24] reasoning at their word. No. Cast those
[1:46:26] things down. Those things are your
[1:46:27] enemy. I say rise up and destroy it in
[1:46:30] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. The
[1:46:32] complex is ruling your life. Do the
[1:46:34] opposite. Actively say, "Bad your skin,
[1:46:36] you'll obey the word of God." Amen. I'm
[1:46:38] going to cast you down complex. I'm
[1:46:40] going to do the opposite. Amen. You want
[1:46:42] to shell away and don't talk to anyone
[1:46:43] because of a complex. You feel inf
[1:46:45] inferior. Start a conversation. Start
[1:46:48] talking. Mix with the believers. Ask
[1:46:50] them how they are. Start, you know,
[1:46:51] don't just sit there and say, "Well, me
[1:46:53] and my and this is where I'm from. I
[1:46:55] came from heaven.
[1:46:57] How about you? I believe look at people
[1:46:59] that came from God. They're going back
[1:47:00] to God. Amen. This is where I came from.
[1:47:03] Doesn't matter what the devil's done in
[1:47:04] my life. No, that origin is greater than
[1:47:06] this earthly problems."
[1:47:09] Amen. And let's have the musicians this
[1:47:11] morning. What can our God not do?
[1:47:14] Amen.
[1:47:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing that song.
[1:47:22] Our God is greater. Our God is stronger.
[1:47:24] God, you are higher than any other. Do
[1:47:26] we know that song? I don't know the word
[1:47:27] of it, but I mean the the name. But
[1:47:29] Amen. Who's behind your skin today?
[1:47:33] When you really sit back and you're by
[1:47:35] yourself, you say, "God lives in me." or
[1:47:38] am I just unhappy,
[1:47:41] miserable, half religious kind of a
[1:47:42] person? You don't have to stay that way.
[1:47:44] You can have a peace like a river, joy
[1:47:47] like a fountain, love like the ocean.
[1:47:49] You can be by yourself in the worst
[1:47:51] situation you've ever been in. There's a
[1:47:53] peace like a river. Amen. I'll be with
[1:47:55] you, even in you to the end of the
[1:47:56] world. I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:47:58] you. I'm with you in this valley. I'm
[1:48:00] with you in this trial. I'm with you in
[1:48:02] this situation. Turn your eyes. Turn
[1:48:03] away. Look away to Jesus. Look at the
[1:48:06] one who's done the work in your life. As
[1:48:07] I said on Wednesday, does he do half a
[1:48:09] job? Does he do Does he start a project
[1:48:13] and just throw up his hands in
[1:48:14] frustration and throw it away? No. What
[1:48:16] he starts, he completes. Who believes
[1:48:18] that this morning? I believe it. And I'm
[1:48:20] so thankful. He says, "The work I
[1:48:21] started, the work he starts, he will
[1:48:23] perfect in the day of Jesus Christ." So
[1:48:25] if he started a work, he's going to
[1:48:26] finish that work. Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] Amen.
[1:48:32] Amen. Do we have that song? We have that
[1:48:33] song. E. Amen. You turn water into wine.
[1:48:36] Open the eyes of the blind. There's none
[1:48:38] like you. Amen. I'm not trying to lift
[1:48:40] up bad. I'm trying to lift up deity.
[1:48:43] Amen. Trying to lift up. Not trying to
[1:48:44] lift up the believer. I'm trying to lift
[1:48:46] up the one in the believer. I trust it's
[1:48:48] all imbalance, right? We're not trying
[1:48:50] to deify our flesh. No, forget that. No.
[1:48:52] Same old bed of skin. But the one in our
[1:48:54] souls is eternal. Amen. Amen. The Lord
[1:48:56] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You have to
[1:48:59] help me out with this one. Let's stand,
[1:49:01] shall we, this morning.
[1:49:03] What do you turn to wine?
[1:49:08] Open the eyes of the blind. There's none
[1:49:12] like you.

[2:06:44] Hallelujah, Lord. Lord, when I think of
[2:06:46] these things, I think of how great your
[2:06:48] blood is, Lord. How powerful it is,
[2:06:51] Lord, to take a vile sinner such as I
[2:06:53] was, Lord. Wash me up from inside out,
[2:06:56] my God, to dwell in me, Lord. That's all
[2:06:58] I can boast in, Lord, and glorifying is
[2:07:00] what you've done, Lord. you're a great
[2:07:02] redeeming work, Lord, that you'd take
[2:07:04] me, take a people, cleanse us. You,
[2:07:06] Almighty God, not just a religious
[2:07:09] spirit, not just something that's
[2:07:11] anything less than you, Lord, but you
[2:07:13] yourself, the great creator, the great I
[2:07:15] am, could come and dwell in a people, a
[2:07:17] purchase, redeemed, hallelujah, washed
[2:07:19] in your blood, people, Lord. Thank you
[2:07:21] for that, Father. Lord, I pray, dear
[2:07:23] God, we'd recognize these things. May it
[2:07:25] anchor into our hearts that Lord that
[2:07:27] you almighty God dwell in us Lord. If we
[2:07:30] have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:07:31] you live on the inside of the inside of
[2:07:33] us, Lord. And Father, if you be there,
[2:07:35] what can hinder us, Lord? What can what
[2:07:37] can trouble us? What can drag us down? I
[2:07:39] say nothing, Lord. Because you've made
[2:07:41] us more than conquerors through you. So,
[2:07:43] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:07:45] pray, Lord, you bless each one here.
[2:07:46] Bless those who have streamed, my God.
[2:07:48] Be their great portion, Lord. If there's
[2:07:50] anyone here, Lord, Father, who doesn't
[2:07:52] truly know you, my God. Maybe know about
[2:07:54] you but doesn't truly know you. Lord,
[2:07:56] just stir them up, my God. Lord, may you
[2:07:59] make them that they're so unsatisfied
[2:08:01] until they make a full surrender and you
[2:08:02] fill them with the Holy Ghost. Grant
[2:08:04] that, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:06] And I pray you dismiss us with your
[2:08:07] blessing, Lord. Father, we go have
[2:08:09] lunch. We go our separate ways, Lord. We
[2:08:10] thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:08:14] Amen. God bless you, friends. You're
[2:08:15] dismissed in Jesus Christ's name.
