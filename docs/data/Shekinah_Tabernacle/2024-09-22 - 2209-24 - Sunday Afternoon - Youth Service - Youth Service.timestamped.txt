[24:23] [Music]
[24:44] put a title to it that my title is the
[24:47] fire of God we just turn don't read too
[24:50] much of my notes
[24:52] please give it
[24:55] away Luke
[25:01] the longer I'm a Christian the more I
[25:04] Marvel at God's love for us in our
[25:06] fallen States you know we always make
[25:09] mistakes daily and the Lord said to
[25:11] surrender and we surrender daily but we
[25:13] still make mistakes and the longer we
[25:15] walk with God the more we realize his
[25:17] love for us
[25:20] hallelu I want to start off and we're
[25:22] talking about um the Rich Young Ruler
[25:25] and the
[25:26] bigger um we start from from I think
[25:31] 19 there was a certain rich man that was
[25:33] clothed in purple and fine Lin and fair
[25:36] sumptuously every day there a certain
[25:38] bigger named Lazarus and he laid at his
[25:41] gate full of swords and desired to be
[25:43] fed with the crumbs which fell from the
[25:44] rich man's table moreover the dogs came
[25:47] and looked to his saws and it came to
[25:48] pass that the bigger died and was
[25:50] carried away by Angels into Abraham's
[25:53] bosom and the rich man died and was
[25:56] buried I'd like to point out here the
[25:58] perspective the bigger seemed poor but
[26:02] when he was carried away by the Angels
[26:03] he actually wasn't poor
[26:06] um yeah he was in God's hands and the
[26:10] rich man and and how he lifted up his
[26:12] eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham
[26:15] a far off and Lazareth in his bosom so
[26:17] he realized that the bigger had gone to
[26:18] heaven he had gone to hell and he cried
[26:20] and said Father Abraham have mercy on me
[26:22] and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip
[26:24] of his finger in water and kill my
[26:26] tongue for I'm tormented in this Flame
[26:28] so he was being tormented the Bible says
[26:30] in flame so it was it was hot not the
[26:33] one to paint that picture but he was in
[26:34] a
[26:35] very ugly position now this Rich Young
[26:39] Ruler he didn't open his life up to God
[26:43] he didn't surrender his order to God and
[26:44] let God have his Li have his gifts to
[26:47] use
[26:48] them and I
[26:51] would ask and encourage each and every
[26:55] one of you if you have a gift no matter
[26:57] how big or how small small give it to
[26:58] God cuz he can use it and he can make an
[27:01] impact in someone else's life and we all
[27:03] Impact people
[27:06] and I'd like to turn to Matthew 22 I
[27:09] want to context these two
[27:12] scriptures may the Lord help
[27:15] me you most of your Bible scholars will
[27:17] know this Matthew 22 Matthew
[27:20] 2235 to4
[27:40] here we go here we go and then then one
[27:44] of them which was a lawyer asked him a
[27:46] question tempting the Lord Jesus saying
[27:49] Master what is the greatest commandment
[27:51] in the law and Jesus said unto him Thou
[27:53] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[27:55] heart with all thy soul and all with all
[27:57] thy mind this is the first and great
[27:59] commandment and the second is like unto
[28:02] it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[28:04] thyself so we can see here the rich man
[28:07] went to hell he obviously walked past
[28:09] the bigger and wasn't very considerate
[28:12] or have didn't have compassion on
[28:15] him and when Jesus was on Earth he said
[28:19] to us just to love God with all your
[28:21] mind your heart your
[28:23] soul and then to love your neighbor so
[28:25] there's a there's a loving spirit and my
[28:27] my tile is the fire of God but I want to
[28:29] type it with love because when the fire
[28:32] of God Falls in someone's life you can
[28:34] see a change and you can see a loving
[28:35] nature come through and you can see the
[28:37] person change and I've been down here
[28:39] five or six years and everyone most
[28:42] people say to me I've changed but I've
[28:43] seen pretty much everybody here changed
[28:45] like the Lord has worked on us and
[28:47] changed us and the longer we look at
[28:49] somebody's life the more we can see
[28:52] Christ in that person and the Lord Jesus
[28:54] working and when we see protocols come
[28:56] home and we see miracles it's amazing we
[29:00] um we love it when the Lord moves in
[29:01] people's lives and we are happy for the
[29:03] person CU most of the time you know if
[29:05] we had a Stony heart once or if we were
[29:07] a certain way with certain problems the
[29:09] Lord changes us and we are we're happy
[29:11] for our brothers and sisters when we see
[29:12] people go
[29:17] free
[29:19] sorry as Christians we must love the
[29:22] Lord with our heart soul and mind when
[29:24] we keep these Commandments the
[29:26] Lord keeps hurts the way he keeps
[29:29] complexes away things the world when we
[29:30] just if we really love the Lord and keep
[29:32] him one real close to us it's very hard
[29:35] for any complex or hurts or pain to come
[29:39] in because if we just love him and stay
[29:41] close to him when things of the world
[29:42] come when friends disappoint or hurt us
[29:45] if we're just loving the Lord he will
[29:47] give us a spirit of compassion
[29:49] understanding and forgiveness for them
[29:50] but in the same context if we don't you
[29:53] know if we fall away and get a bit
[29:55] carnal or we don't surrender all of our
[29:57] our elv that's where pain and hurt can
[30:00] get in and that's when we can start
[30:02] going down a path which it leads to
[30:05] Destruction for us until we really
[30:06] surrender back to
[30:09] God so I want to I'm going to tie try
[30:13] tie these two things back together
[30:15] during the
[30:18] service um we we want to be a living
[30:20] sacrifice for Jesus we want him to use
[30:22] us we want to be his hand we want to be
[30:25] his hands and feet want to be good
[30:26] stewards we want to fight the faith for
[30:28] the faith we want to lay down our lives
[30:30] and surrender and when and when we do
[30:32] that the easiest way is just to love the
[30:35] Lord because when we create a loving
[30:37] atmosphere Jesus can come in Jesus can
[30:40] work but if we're all hard and Stony
[30:43] it's not inviting the atmosphere the
[30:44] Holy Ghost isn't welcome because we have
[30:47] moved away from the greatest commandment
[30:49] or the great commandment sorry not the
[30:52] greatest and that love is something we
[30:55] really need can we just pull up that
[30:57] next slide please slide number
[31:01] two Jesus in Luke 620 he looking at his
[31:05] disciples he said blessed are you who
[31:07] are poor for yours is the kingdom of
[31:08] heaven and that was that bigger his he
[31:10] didn't may not have realized it he was
[31:12] he probably had nothing probably didn't
[31:14] even have a Bible hardly any clothes but
[31:16] the Lord seen his day and he said
[31:18] blessed are the poor for there is the
[31:19] kingdom of heaven so if you're poor Just
[31:21] Praise the Lord don't worry about money
[31:24] money doesn't matter um because if it
[31:26] matters God will take it away like the
[31:29] rich man and then you then you'll have
[31:30] some real
[31:32] problems brother brandom in the
[31:34] discernment of the spirit I was going to
[31:37] read this quote you said now there is
[31:39] now there is so many in the
[31:41] day now there is so much in the day that
[31:43] we live in pertaining to gifts so many
[31:45] people judge people by the gifts that
[31:47] they have well I believe that these
[31:49] things are gifts I believe
[31:51] that what we see take place is gifts and
[31:55] they are G god-given gifts but we if we
[31:59] do not use them in the right way that
[32:01] God intended them to be used then we can
[32:04] do more harm with the gifts then we
[32:06] could if we did not have the gifts the
[32:09] other night I made a statement this is
[32:11] why I'm reading this quote at the P
[32:14] saying that I would rather see Brotherly
[32:15] Love existing among the
[32:17] church if we didn't
[32:20] have if we didn't have one case of
[32:22] healing or anything else see we must
[32:24] know what these things are for the
[32:25] discernment of the spirit and he goes on
[32:27] to say how gifts can cause a lot of hurt
[32:29] if they're not used in the right place
[32:30] but what brother brandham is saying here
[32:32] is he'd rather see Brotherly Love he'd
[32:34] rather see the love of Christ comeing
[32:36] through then all the gifts of Christ we
[32:39] understand when there when the gifts
[32:41] when when that love and the gifts are in
[32:42] place that all operates in harmony but
[32:44] when the love isn't there the gifts
[32:46] don't act in harmony so we have to make
[32:47] sure that we cling to Jesus and have
[32:50] that love in our
[32:56] hearts it it does impact
[33:00] um when you young kids are at school you
[33:04] know that love people can see it on the
[33:05] way they you can fool a lot of people
[33:07] when you're a Christian sometimes but
[33:10] when you have that true love for people
[33:12] everybody knows they know you have that
[33:14] love and when God comes close they they
[33:17] they feel that change too
[33:30] in the Old
[33:31] Testament God accepted as sacrifices
[33:33] with fire that the Jewish people used to
[33:35] have a a perfect sacrifice a lamb or
[33:38] oxen or a
[33:40] bull um and and he used to look it up by
[33:42] fire to accept the sacrifice and and
[33:44] when we surrender in our lives Jesus can
[33:47] can he can take us well through the
[33:48] blood he accepts us and when he see
[33:52] that's what we can see when we can see
[33:53] someone's surrendered life in Christ
[33:55] through that God's fire has come down
[33:57] that person's life and we can see the
[33:59] gifts and Harmony and things
[34:02] change I just want to give you guys um
[34:05] if we can go to First Kings
[34:08] 18 this is an account of a a sacrifice
[34:12] that Elijah did um First Kings 18 verse
[34:16] 33
[34:34] this is Elijah
[34:36] I I think it's Mount cell but I'm not
[34:38] sure I think it is
[34:41] yes and he had challenged the gods of
[34:44] Baal for a standoff for a sacrifice and
[34:48] they had been cutting themselves and
[34:50] crying and no fire came down from heaven
[34:52] and Elijah here in 33 he put wood and he
[34:55] put the wood in order and cut the
[34:57] bollocks and pieces and laid him on the
[34:59] wood and
[35:01] said fill four barrels with wood and
[35:03] poured on the burnt sacrifice and on the
[35:06] wood and he said do it the second time
[35:09] he really knew what he was talking about
[35:10] he do it the second time and they came
[35:12] back and he said do it this third time I
[35:15] did it the third time and the water ran
[35:18] around about the Altar and he filled the
[35:21] trench also with water and it came to
[35:23] pass at the
[35:24] time and it came to pass at the time of
[35:26] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[35:29] that Elijah the prophet came near and
[35:31] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[35:34] Israel let it be known this day that
[35:36] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[35:39] servant and that I have done all these
[35:41] things at Thy word hear me oh Lord that
[35:44] this people may know that thou art God
[35:47] and that thou H has turned their heart
[35:49] back again you know we love it when God
[35:52] turns our heart back or or soften our
[35:54] hearts gives a new heart fills with the
[35:56] spirit it's the it's exact L what we
[35:58] want in life without it you know we're
[36:00] very miserable and I'm so glad the life
[36:01] the Lord changed my life then the fire
[36:04] of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt
[36:06] sacrifice and the wood and the stones
[36:07] and the dust and licked up the water
[36:09] that was in the trench see he called
[36:11] down fire he KN he knew his position he
[36:13] knew where he stood on the word he knew
[36:15] God was with him and he called it down
[36:16] he challenged the gods of
[36:18] Baal and then here after if you read the
[36:21] rest of the scripture he they overtook
[36:23] them and and killed them
[36:28] and God's fire still pours out through
[36:31] his word in our lives if we let him if
[36:33] we surrender our all God's fire comes
[36:35] down and we can be
[36:37] vessels people around us when we get a
[36:41] opportunity to witness or the Lord when
[36:43] the Lord uses us people see and can
[36:46] experience that same fight if we are
[36:48] willing to surrender and give our lives
[36:50] fully over to
[36:53] Jesus here's a fire if you guys can put
[36:56] yourself in the moment you know Elijah
[36:57] he was it was a prophet he was
[36:58] surrounded by other people there and
[37:00] fire literally rained down from heaven
[37:02] it would have been a magnificent sight
[37:04] but then after when the men went and
[37:08] killed all the other false baale
[37:10] prophets and Idol worshippers you know
[37:12] it was a real scene it was it was
[37:15] intense it's the same in our day it's
[37:18] intense you know in the spiritual
[37:20] warfare we in when we're fighting
[37:23] unbelief and Spirits when our kids are
[37:25] bombarded with spirits and we're
[37:27] fighting them it's the same thing and we
[37:30] have to let that fire of God fall for
[37:32] the sake of all of our families our
[37:34] loved ones because we want them there we
[37:36] love them and we must surrender and let
[37:37] the Lord use
[37:43] us we check in on the Promises of God we
[37:45] believe his scriptures I want to turn to
[37:48] Isaiah 43
[38:00] but now thus sayith the Lord that
[38:02] created thee oh Jacob and he that formed
[38:04] thee oh Israel fear not for I have
[38:07] redeemed thee and I'm so glad Jesus
[38:09] redeemed me and redeem you his love
[38:12] cared for us we all deserve to go to
[38:14] hell sorry if that's abrupt but it's his
[38:17] blood that's worthy and we're so
[38:18] thankful that the God died on Calvary
[38:20] for us we're so glad that when times of
[38:23] trouble come that we can rely on the
[38:25] Lord we call him on the seene and
[38:27] whether he answers us or doesn't answer
[38:29] us in the trials God comes down and he
[38:31] takes care of it no matter what the
[38:33] situation is whether it's a life
[38:35] threatening situation or whether it's
[38:37] just a spirit of Torment God comes on
[38:39] the scene we can stand on his word and
[38:41] we can chop through Satan and his
[38:43] spirits that are and his principalities
[38:45] that are challenging us I have called
[38:47] thee by thy name and thou art mine when
[38:49] thou passest through the waters I will
[38:51] be with thee this is God's promise to us
[38:53] and through the rivers Thou shalt not
[38:55] overflow thee when thou walkest through
[38:57] the fire thou should not be burnt at the
[38:59] start of my Serv there there was a fire
[39:01] that Lazarus was tormented by this is a
[39:03] different fire Satan all satan also has
[39:06] a fire and he torments people by it
[39:08] demonic spirits torment people with and
[39:10] and when it comes around you can feel it
[39:12] and when people are
[39:14] demon when they're possessed you know
[39:17] they are sometimes with how their
[39:18] actions are and it's not nice even the
[39:20] spirit of smoking you know it's a it's a
[39:22] demonic spirit and you can feel the
[39:24] torment that person's in and if you're
[39:25] that person you can feel the torment you
[39:27] know the pain but the Lord Jesus says
[39:30] Thou shallal not be burned with the
[39:32] neither shall the Flames Kindle upon
[39:33] thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy
[39:36] One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt
[39:38] for thy Ransom Ethiopia and SE before
[39:41] thee during this times when we go
[39:44] through trials whether it's be sickness
[39:47] whether it be Sons and Daughters going
[39:49] astray this is a great promise the Lord
[39:52] say be with us amen he said the the
[39:56] water shall not be flow thee
[39:58] during the fire of the trial shall not
[40:00] burn thee and the Lord also says many
[40:03] times in the scriptures here restore he
[40:05] restores what the cankerworm has taken
[40:07] from our lives we just believe on the
[40:09] Promises don't give up
[40:16] hope I want to flick back to John sorry

[40:42] reading as the father have loved me so
[40:45] have I loved you continue in my continue
[40:48] ye in my
[40:51] love that I read this and I was honest
[40:54] and awe with how the Lord tied these
[40:56] scriptures together for me and hopefully
[40:58] they they all come together this one of
[41:01] the great Commandments was love the Lord
[41:03] thy God and when you when you love him
[41:05] it just it removes trouble away and if
[41:07] it doesn't just love him more and and

[41:44] concentrate on his promises that he's
[41:46] created a new world for us a new body
[41:48] that doesn't get sick or bombarded with
[41:51] um Spirits fighting us all the time a
[41:53] body that doesn't die this is this is
[41:56] real Joy when we get that body we're
[41:58] going to be really jumping for
[42:10] joy may we have more of the Father's
[42:13] Love may it consume Our
[42:22] Lives we uh the Bible is we're under
[42:25] grace the Old Testament was law The Ten
[42:28] Commandments as a young fellow I used to
[42:31] think um you know these Ten Commandments
[42:34] they sort of they make life a bit dull
[42:37] that was me but the longer I walk with
[42:39] Christ you realize that the this this
[42:41] commandment of love that God gave us and
[42:43] the Ten Commandments if you actually
[42:44] obey them God all he's doing he's trying
[42:46] to just to protect you you know with all
[42:49] the Folly the world has to offer if you
[42:51] disobey all the Commandments your life
[42:53] just ends up in turmoil it generally
[42:55] Falls to um abuse of other
[42:58] substances or um Spirits battling you
[43:02] down and and not having true Joy or
[43:04] happiness and that's why God is he set
[43:06] his Commandments out there to protect us
[43:09] he's like the mama eagle or the mama hen
[43:12] however you want to say and he he Broods
[43:14] over us and when I remember when the
[43:16] spirits fell here and there's been
[43:18] tongues interpretations and just in the
[43:19] song when the anointings there you know
[43:21] we love it when the Lord's Spirit falls
[43:23] on us and we and he and he he he puts
[43:25] his Wings Over Us and just covers us and
[43:28] puts love into our lives and we we love
[43:29] it when Jesus comes around
[43:35] as 1 Peter
[43:40] 1:7 that the trial of your faith being
[43:43] much more precious than gold that
[43:45] perishes that perisheth though it be TR
[43:48] with fire might be found unto praise and
[43:51] glory and honor at the appearing of CH
[43:54] Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye
[43:59] love in whom though now ye see him not
[44:05] yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unsp
[44:09] unspeakable full of Glory receiving the
[44:12] end of your faith even the salvation of
[44:15] your
[44:17] souls I love that
[44:22] scripture we haven't seen him yet but we
[44:24] will one day soon and we just want to we
[44:27] want to keep that love about us we want
[44:28] to rejoice and we want to keep a we want
[44:30] to keep an atmosphere of love and we

[51:05] verse2 I want you to turn there so that
[51:09] um I've got also a few few little verses
[51:11] and then
[51:15] um uh realize realize one thing this is
[51:19] for you okay yes I learn a lot of
[51:23] through this and I'll tell you now this
[51:25] was probably the hardest sermon I had to
[51:27] prepare for uh the Lord I think the Lord
[51:31] challenged me um I had so many thoughts
[51:34] running through my head I was so excited
[51:37] when brother Ben said I can I can take
[51:39] one of these Youth Services CU I thought
[51:40] man I'm going to make it fun for you
[51:42] guys and it's going to be practical and
[51:44] all that but man I was struggling just
[51:47] to get this together like how do I what
[51:50] do I can I take this should I leave that
[51:53] I I was just all over the show so
[51:57] it's for you it's for you let's read
[52:01] verse 12 please beloved think it not
[52:03] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[52:06] is to try you as though some strange
[52:09] thing happened to you but rejoice in as
[52:12] much as ye are partakers of Christ's
[52:15] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[52:19] revealed ye be glad also with exceeding
[52:23] Joy amen you may have your your
[52:27] seats I will try and get some get
[52:30] comfortable as
[52:32] well
[52:34] um I won't call you boys and girls I'll
[52:38] just say youth I'll just say what what
[52:40] you want what what should I call you
[52:43] what do you boys and
[52:47] girls brothers and sisters um okay
[52:53] so um can I can I just speak can I just
[52:59] I've got thoughts and I brought all this
[53:01] together and I just want to speak from
[53:03] the heart just from experience okay and
[53:06] I'll I'll get to it I'll get to it now
[53:09] now it's it's it's not a opinion I want
[53:12] to give you to as where life's journey
[53:15] took me and I'm trying to put this all
[53:18] together okay so this is some life
[53:23] lessons and you can see version 44.
[53:26] seven so I've had some lessons in life
[53:30] and and and as you can see with the
[53:32] iteration or the versioning it's still
[53:35] going on it didn't stop at version
[53:38] 0.1 uh I've learned many years um there
[53:42] might be a hint in the four and the four
[53:44] but I won't dwell too much on it um that
[53:48] that was quite a nice I actually just
[53:50] wanted to have a little picture up there
[53:51] and then I found that I said oh that's
[53:53] very nice sometimes you must hurt in
[53:56] order to to know fall in order to grow
[53:59] lose in order to gain because most of
[54:01] life's greatest lessons are learned
[54:03] through
[54:05] pain unfortunately true
[54:08] okay
[54:10] so
[54:13] ohia never mind
[54:16] okay so we'll start off you probably May
[54:19] yeah you can read that a little bit
[54:22] about me
[54:25] okay where does this life lessons came
[54:27] from and all that kind of thing I'll
[54:29] give you a
[54:31] highlights uh uh a highlights real a
[54:34] highlight of my of my life because when
[54:37] I I didn't grow up in the message okay
[54:40] so I grew up as a denominational
[54:42] Christian you know Mom Dad Christian
[54:45] they they they learned gave me all
[54:48] taught me the the the the life's
[54:50] principles and and and and and Christian
[54:52] moral principles all right I came here
[54:56] and then I the first thing me and sister
[54:59] ly went was my whole life a lie you know
[55:04] and and brother Ben he he he can read
[55:07] someone very quickly he said no no no no
[55:09] no no don't throw away your whole life
[55:12] now you need to the Lord's taken you
[55:14] through this whole process and to to get
[55:16] you to a point to get you to a certain
[55:19] maturity um uh you're a different flower
[55:22] to this one you you've got a different
[55:24] culture different path that you had to
[55:26] grow
[55:27] uh everything changed the Dynamics was
[55:29] different he wanted you to get to this
[55:31] point um and and when I and I and I and
[55:34] I and I when the Revelation struck I go
[55:37] okay so what what do I make then of my
[55:40] past if I look back what is the what is
[55:42] the good what is the Nuggets or the Mana
[55:45] that I can look back that that got me
[55:46] through that really desolate place and
[55:50] and and desert if I can say
[55:53] spiritually um
[55:56] highlights of my life so then so I had
[55:59] some counsel here so I didn't receive
[56:02] counsel but I gave counsel so I was 18
[56:05] 19 years old and I had this you know
[56:07] good life and then you can go and
[56:10] counsil for a year in different schools
[56:13] high schools primary schools so fun fact
[56:16] um sister Lundy was in the primary
[56:18] school service here counseling so she
[56:22] usually dressed up as a
[56:24] clown and uh I was the cool guy I was in
[56:27] the high school team you know I was a
[56:30] drama queen um I I I I had to do some
[56:34] Cabaret and sing and do all these little
[56:37] weird dances which um yeah didn't not
[56:40] that cool um and that's where we met
[56:43] right so we used these little um avenues
[56:46] like dance and drama and and primary
[56:49] school activities and we did app sailing
[56:52] and paintball and all that just to pull
[56:55] people in just to sit down just to see
[56:57] who's hurt who's not you know so big
[57:00] learning school for for myself um but
[57:04] one of the things that I loved about
[57:06] that is because I guess this is the
[57:09] nature uh that's half a nature of every
[57:12] man I would say but it's it's big than
[57:15] my life I love the nothing box I love
[57:17] silence I love spending time just by
[57:20] myself no no sound no nothing around I
[57:23] can I can you know listen to my thoughts
[57:25] you now I can I can engage so one of the
[57:28] things now looking back that I actually
[57:31] enjoyed quite a bit was Solitude they
[57:33] used the word solitude now sometimes
[57:35] they'll come to us and say okay Solitude
[57:37] time and everyone just go I go when when
[57:42] now can we'll skip breakfast let's go
[57:44] you know it was a time that I could just
[57:46] go no no no device obviously that was
[57:50] back in 99 so it was hardly a device it
[57:52] was a brick um 99 um um no device no
[57:56] music no nothing you can take your Bible
[57:59] you can take a pen and you can take a
[58:01] little booklet notebook Journal
[58:03] something like that enjoyed it immensely
[58:07] now some they they had to uh sort of um
[58:10] wean Us in so the first time they said
[58:13] okay Solitude time it was an hour or
[58:16] maybe two hours cannot talk to anyone
[58:19] you are on your own okay you the Lord
[58:23] the word and your and your thoughts
[58:25] right I I loved it loved it to bits
[58:28] second time third time for and went on
[58:30] and at one stage they said I think it
[58:32] was something like 6 or 8 hours I go
[58:35] whoa now the benefit is I didn't sit in
[58:38] a city at that point when they asked
[58:39] that there was in a little place called
[58:43] Claymont uh Southern Cape uh
[58:46] Southwestern Cape so beautiful scenery
[58:49] you can really find a spot either next
[58:51] to the beach or in the bush or wherever
[58:53] and just be I enjoyed as so 6 hours of
[58:58] no other sounds but nature and you know
[59:01] if the Lord wanted to speak to me and he
[59:02] did he did speak to me quite a bit so a
[59:05] lot of reading time lot of journaling
[59:06] time lot of um I guess tools pre
[59:10] preparation for what we did in the
[59:12] schools you know you walk into schools
[59:14] sometimes it's it's a bit rough um you
[59:16] know there were people schools that was
[59:20] um uh I can't remember somewhere in Cape
[59:22] Town where they had
[59:24] 250 pregnan
[59:26] pregnancies just within the matric year
[59:29] you know so they they they had barbed
[59:32] wire around the the school to keep the
[59:35] kids in you know it was it was tough it
[59:38] was you know so we had to sort of build
[59:41] character cuz what do we take to them
[59:43] back then it was still uh the AIDS
[59:46] epidemic and all that so we had to sort
[59:48] of get some sort of lesson together and
[59:50] make it practical for people to
[59:51] understand for for kids to understand
[59:54] what is the significant what impact this
[59:55] will have have in your life so we
[59:57] learned about spiritual warfare we saw
[59:59] all this and we go man there's so many
[1:00:01] things I'm just going on this um I'm
[1:00:04] still a baby in my spiritual walk you
[1:00:08] know where's where's life taking me you
[1:00:10] know so this was the decision I made cuz
[1:00:13] I didn't want to go study I I didn't
[1:00:14] know what to do what am I going to be
[1:00:16] when I grow up I haven't grown up yet it
[1:00:19] seems so I I just carried on from there
[1:00:23] so then
[1:00:26] the next is did I make it did I make it
[1:00:30] can you see what that is that's a little
[1:00:33] a little seam a little th those that can
[1:00:36] sew um there's a what's it the thread
[1:00:39] and then uh I thought
[1:00:43] well sometimes I sit here and I go I
[1:00:48] think I've just made it on the skin of
[1:00:50] my teeth you know you you just made it
[1:00:52] in the door you were that last monkey
[1:00:54] into the ark's door before itos
[1:00:56] right when God so this and this is the
[1:00:59] thought I've had when God cut that cloth
[1:01:02] right so we're all part of this big
[1:01:03] cloth it's big and he's making us all
[1:01:06] together you know we one piece brother
[1:01:09] you said rip off that that piece of the
[1:01:11] jacket it's still piece of that jacket
[1:01:13] you know it's part of it I it felt like
[1:01:15] I was that so when when when you have
[1:01:18] this uh they they take the seam they
[1:01:21] pull it over the Hem and they sew it
[1:01:23] together there to just make it nice and
[1:01:25] you in the inside no one knows about it
[1:01:28] I think that was me you know that part
[1:01:29] of that cloth where I just made it where
[1:01:33] the Lord was cutting and that little
[1:01:34] thread you know sticking out that was me
[1:01:37] that was me and they they just fol you
[1:01:39] know the Lord folded it over and that
[1:01:42] and I thought well did I make it so you
[1:01:44] can see look at both ways I barely made
[1:01:48] it negatively or I go by the Lord's
[1:01:52] Grace I'm in I made it I'm still part of
[1:01:57] that okay so can you can you start
[1:02:01] seeing now I'm just giving you little
[1:02:03] snit bits and little life lessons Okay
[1:02:05] so any of these might just prick
[1:02:08] something in your heart might just stick
[1:02:10] with you okay and that's what I want I
[1:02:12] I'll try and cover a few things and then
[1:02:14] you say well this is now from my
[1:02:16] experience to you you do with it what
[1:02:19] you want okay let the Lord lead and work
[1:02:23] in your life right did I make it
[1:02:26] yes I was piece of that garment or not I
[1:02:28] was piece of that garment and I took
[1:02:30] that and I said I'm part of this and and
[1:02:32] and the Lord revealed to me that hey you
[1:02:35] have you have you have much work to do
[1:02:37] you know even if you just that one cut
[1:02:39] around that in that garment and that
[1:02:41] little tosel key is coming loose you
[1:02:43] still part of that garment right am
[1:02:45] Hallelujah
[1:02:47] okay did I make it now off the beach
[1:02:51] okay off the beach a lot of rugby being
[1:02:54] played
[1:02:56] um and then you have performance again
[1:03:01] remember it's part of my life lessons
[1:03:03] now so I had to learn this now my for me
[1:03:05] for Edan right off the beach I can
[1:03:09] perform I've got good performance and
[1:03:11] then when I'm at home what do I do when
[1:03:14] I am at work what do I do not from a
[1:03:17] performance point of view let me color
[1:03:20] the picture
[1:03:22] in they went to the Navy SE
[1:03:26] in America okay and they said the Seal
[1:03:29] Team Six you know the Seal Team Six okay
[1:03:32] this is the best of the best okay this
[1:03:34] is this is they take the Navy Seals the
[1:03:37] Army everyone and they go handpick these
[1:03:40] guys for SEAL Team Six they can swim
[1:03:43] they can they can shoot guns they can
[1:03:46] disassemble and they can make bombs
[1:03:48] everything this is the cream of the crop
[1:03:50] they went to the commanders and Chief
[1:03:53] and said how do you pick your Seal Team
[1:03:55] six all right most of you probably
[1:04:00] think performance performance you need
[1:04:03] to perform on the battlefield you need
[1:04:05] to carry on and and and if the stakes
[1:04:08] are down chips are you need to you need
[1:04:11] to perform you need to shoot accurate
[1:04:13] you cannot waste your bullets you need
[1:04:14] to you know that guy is not necessarily
[1:04:18] trustworthy okay so then they started
[1:04:21] looking at okay so you've got a guy
[1:04:23] that's okay performer but
[1:04:26] he he's not trustworthy there in the
[1:04:29] camp all right so the differentiation
[1:04:31] now that they're making his performances
[1:04:33] on the field trust is off the field so
[1:04:37] they go okay high performance guy or a
[1:04:40] low performance guy but no trust so when
[1:04:42] he's off the battlefield what time of
[1:04:45] person what time of character is coming
[1:04:47] out so they started picking the guys
[1:04:51] that's more trustworthy and they'll even
[1:04:54] take a guy that's Trust worthy and less
[1:04:56] performing so all on this right side
[1:04:59] because what they said is they want to
[1:05:02] the performance side I can trust you
[1:05:04] with my life but the trust side can I
[1:05:07] trust you with my money and my wife
[1:05:10] right so off the pitch who are you okay
[1:05:14] so performance here we are we at church
[1:05:17] we and you can see brother armant FY you
[1:05:20] we go into Solutions mode if something
[1:05:22] goes wrong you know it's performance it
[1:05:24] is performance we we we want to create
[1:05:26] the atmosphere and all that kind of
[1:05:28] thing and when it's done we pack up and
[1:05:30] go what type of person are we then on
[1:05:33] our way home or getting home or when the
[1:05:36] day or the week gets a little bit long
[1:05:39] you know who are we so I want to teach
[1:05:41] you that trust is vital I want to be
[1:05:46] able to trust you and vice versa brother
[1:05:48] need who comes to you and say you know
[1:05:52] and and it's it's humbling and they say
[1:05:54] I can trust you with me my with my car I
[1:05:56] can trust you with my wife I can trust
[1:05:59] you know that is that is Lord and that's
[1:06:02] the Lord that will take over if you let
[1:06:05] him right next one God has a plan for
[1:06:09] you right so we were talking about a lot
[1:06:12] of fire there brother Ben and the
[1:06:14] scripts are also aligned with our fiery
[1:06:16] trials and then um who likes brother ban
[1:06:21] Bailey well B Glo ban Bailey what a guy
[1:06:25] okay wow I'm standing there and my
[1:06:28] cheeks were starting to hurt cuz I was
[1:06:30] just smiling he's s such a wonderful guy
[1:06:34] and I can tell you you can ask him
[1:06:36] behind my back off the pitch that guy is
[1:06:40] next level Next Level we having fun
[1:06:43] together when we work he goes these guys
[1:06:46] are pleps but I go man this is fun I can
[1:06:49] break stuff you know you need to always
[1:06:51] go and Fe but to see this guy's Journey
[1:06:53] what's it now five years that you've
[1:06:55] been here
[1:06:56] is
[1:06:58] it yeah yeah so well it's been going
[1:07:02] like that you know so let's say a good
[1:07:04] good stint of four years but the Ben
[1:07:06] that walked in here and who knows Ben
[1:07:08] and the Ben that you see today that
[1:07:10] stood behind this Pulpit wow what a
[1:07:13] difference hey Lord can mold in shape
[1:07:17] okay so and that's that fits in here
[1:07:19] with God's God has a plan for you so
[1:07:22] whenever let me give you this advice
[1:07:25] kids whenever someone comes to you I'm
[1:07:28] thinking brother Adrian maybe brother
[1:07:30] kben maybe and they go and they see
[1:07:32] you've got a tough tough day at the
[1:07:34] office if I can say that and he puts the
[1:07:37] hands around his shoulder and he says
[1:07:38] God's got a plan for you if you're not a
[1:07:41] Christian run but I mean run very fast
[1:07:46] if you are a Christian try and stay
[1:07:49] ahead of that guy that's not the
[1:07:51] Christian and be faster than him
[1:07:54] because it's not a motivational speech
[1:07:57] God has a plan for you God has a plan
[1:08:00] for you there's hardship in that
[1:08:03] road his
[1:08:06] plan it is his plan let's let's get that
[1:08:09] out of the way it's not your plan so if
[1:08:11] someone comes to you and say God has a
[1:08:13] plan for you your life is going to Veer
[1:08:16] your life is going to change your life
[1:08:18] is going to be the boat's going to be
[1:08:20] shaken right be ready for
[1:08:24] that but his plan is to give him glory
[1:08:29] that's right so however he needs to mold
[1:08:32] and shape and purify and put you through
[1:08:34] the fire to purify that gold to get it
[1:08:37] shiny he wants to see himself reflected
[1:08:40] that's God's plan that plan sometimes is
[1:08:43] is hard I won't say it's not fun it's
[1:08:47] never a dull moment I'll put it that way
[1:08:50] okay so it is it is for only the brave
[1:08:55] um we run towards it rather than than
[1:08:59] Shan so I was just joking don't run away
[1:09:01] from it God will get you he's fast okay
[1:09:05] all
[1:09:06] right off the pit I think I've got
[1:09:08] something wrong
[1:09:10] there ah yes okay so I'll
[1:09:15] do I'll do
[1:09:17] this
[1:09:19] Oddball
[1:09:22] Oddball so there's a reason you get
[1:09:25] saved
[1:09:26] you decide God's chosen me and I
[1:09:28] accepted the offer to love the Lord with
[1:09:30] all your heart all your mind all your
[1:09:32] strength you know this you love him
[1:09:34] everywhere so remember what I said the
[1:09:36] performance and Trust off the pit
[1:09:38] wherever you love him everywhere so now
[1:09:41] you start praising him you start singing
[1:09:43] you people are down and and and and
[1:09:46] there's not a lot of vitamin C or
[1:09:48] vitamin D going around uh you still up
[1:09:51] and up you still you've got a joyful
[1:09:53] heart you still singing and shouting you
[1:09:55] you become to look a little bit crazy
[1:09:58] okay you are the Oddball
[1:10:01] so what I can tell you and my mom can
[1:10:04] probably then also go and you can ask
[1:10:06] her behind my back I've never been the
[1:10:09] the the celebrity or the the cool guy in
[1:10:12] school or anything like that so I can't
[1:10:15] I can't understand when you say
[1:10:18] um uh uh uh it's not it's not in it's
[1:10:22] not it's not cool it's not what I I was
[1:10:25] was a odd ball I I I had my friends and
[1:10:28] I stuck to them uh I think it was five
[1:10:31] friends and that was it you know I was
[1:10:33] friendly with everyone but I was also
[1:10:37] sometimes the bully bully I I I didn't
[1:10:39] stand up for any of those you know the
[1:10:42] cool kids so you know I would wear the
[1:10:44] Jesus Freak t-shirt you know I was I was
[1:10:46] that guy so um I grew up with that and I
[1:10:50] I I was happy being that odd ball you
[1:10:53] know I accepted it maybe my Statum made
[1:10:55] it a bit easier if I was in know I don't
[1:10:58] know
[1:10:59] but it you you're going to be odd ball
[1:11:02] you're going to be OD ball somewhere
[1:11:05] accept it take it okay I won't spend too
[1:11:09] much time on that but brother brandom
[1:11:12] talks about Oddball okay you just you're
[1:11:16] going to face that b battle So when you
[1:11:18] say Here I Am Lord and you're going to
[1:11:20] start and praise him praise him
[1:11:22] everywhere praise him off the pit and on
[1:11:25] you are going to become an oddball I'm
[1:11:28] I'm telling you okay so there we've got
[1:11:31] Oddball and now make up your mind make
[1:11:33] up your
[1:11:35] mind so you're going to have to turn
[1:11:39] with me to a few scriptures make up your
[1:11:41] mind not your opinion okay so let's see
[1:11:45] the first one Joshua 24:15 let's turn
[1:11:49] there Joshua 24:15 he got a Bible you've
[1:11:52] got all the Bibles say amen amen
[1:11:57] okay
[1:12:01] 24:15 and if it seem evil to you to
[1:12:05] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[1:12:08] you will serve whether the gods which
[1:12:10] your fathers served that were on the
[1:12:12] other side of the flood or the gods of
[1:12:14] the amorites in whose land Ye Ye dwell
[1:12:18] but as for me and my house we will serve
[1:12:22] the Lord very famous scripture I just
[1:12:24] want to bring it to you kids this is
[1:12:27] Joshua 24 the Battle of Jericho is
[1:12:30] Joshua 5 this has been going quite some
[1:12:33] time so after Jericho after the works
[1:12:37] that signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:12:39] whatever that happened God came down
[1:12:41] after that he's he's still he's still
[1:12:44] giving them this he's still giving them
[1:12:46] this sort of a make a choice okay and
[1:12:49] that's where I want to say make a choice
[1:12:51] make up your mind today don't take your
[1:12:53] your your opinion you still growing
[1:12:55] you're still changing I'm still changing
[1:12:57] all right opinions out of the way okay
[1:13:00] so if we we read Joshua 24 so if I put
[1:13:04] this
[1:13:05] up can you turn to your Bibles
[1:13:08] please 1 Ed one 16 is it in the Bible no
[1:13:14] leave it alone leave it alone throw it
[1:13:16] out okay what about this one tw NOA 39
[1:13:21] it's got the accent and everything this
[1:13:23] is fancy this must be in the Bible hey
[1:13:26] is it in the Bible let's leave it alone
[1:13:29] does this ring a bell does this look
[1:13:31] familiar 1 Corinthians 15 do we have
[1:13:33] that in the Bible can we turn there
[1:13:35] maybe okay so what I'm trying to show
[1:13:38] you there is if any man's opinion there
[1:13:42] go if it comes back to the word take it
[1:13:46] read it okay if brother Arman throws up
[1:13:50] here on the board on Wednesday night you
[1:13:53] go home and you go go check if is right
[1:13:55] or not examine the word okay so 1
[1:13:59] Corinthians
[1:14:02] 15
[1:14:03] uh behold I show you a mystery we shall
[1:14:07] not all sleep but we will all be changed
[1:14:09] in a moment in a twinkling of the last
[1:14:13] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[1:14:15] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[1:14:17] be raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:14:22] changed
[1:14:23] okay what I want to tie in there is
[1:14:27] you've seen now let's go
[1:14:30] back that's
[1:14:32] legit not
[1:14:34] legit not even faintly this is legit so
[1:14:38] let's get that all together scripture
[1:14:41] okay the truth is will never make you
[1:14:45] popular the truth will make you free
[1:14:50] 100% okay that's why I'm saying if you
[1:14:53] make up your mind now and you you are
[1:14:55] going away be ready right you won't be
[1:14:59] popular I was never missed popular I
[1:15:01] can't I can't I'm can't compute okay I
[1:15:04] was the odd ball but what I do know is
[1:15:08] if you choose the root of absolute truth
[1:15:12] you will you will not be popular it's
[1:15:14] not a popular opinion around
[1:15:16] here
[1:15:19] okay
[1:15:21] also rather have a splinter in your back
[1:15:25] and I'm playing here paraphrasing on
[1:15:26] scripture rather have a splinter on your
[1:15:28] back than keeping the Splinter in your
[1:15:30] eye what I'm saying there is when you're
[1:15:33] not popular when the truth comes out and
[1:15:36] you turn your back you might get a few
[1:15:38] things in the back okay maybe Wooden
[1:15:41] Spoons I don't know but they you you
[1:15:45] will you will you will be
[1:15:47] backstabbed because you believe the
[1:15:49] truth you stand and honor the truth you
[1:15:51] on your position okay
[1:15:55] okay and this is now for you okay and he
[1:15:59] said go your
[1:16:00] way Daniel for the words are closed up
[1:16:04] and sealed Until the End uh until the
[1:16:07] time of the end don't you forget that
[1:16:09] until the time of the end this is Daniel
[1:16:12] this is Old Testament this
[1:16:14] is very very far ago he's talking about
[1:16:19] now this is for you okay until the end
[1:16:23] of until the time of the end many shall
[1:16:26] be purified and and oops and made white
[1:16:29] and tried but the wicked shall do
[1:16:31] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[1:16:33] understand but the wise shall understand
[1:16:37] just look in the world what's going on
[1:16:40] getting more wickedly more less and less
[1:16:42] and less understanding we're getting
[1:16:45] here and we are on a different plane we
[1:16:48] are going up and up the word the the
[1:16:51] what's coming over this Pulpit is just
[1:16:52] on another level at this point take that
[1:16:55] the end time message shall reveal it the
[1:16:58] last Church age right here Glory there
[1:17:01] you are oh my it shakes me to think of
[1:17:03] it the mystery the things that the uh
[1:17:06] that the church World bats their eyes
[1:17:09] and says it's nonsense the mystery of
[1:17:11] who Jesus Christ is not a third person
[1:17:13] or second person but the person of God
[1:17:16] all these other mysteries of God will be
[1:17:19] revealed because it's wrote in this book
[1:17:22] and be revealed to the end time
[1:17:25] generation I'm almost past this now this
[1:17:28] is you end time generation you've got
[1:17:31] you've got lingo this is this is you
[1:17:34] they can no more see it in seminary
[1:17:35] schools de denominations the Jews could
[1:17:39] see Jesus being the Messiah then jwes
[1:17:42] sorry no matter they try they think
[1:17:45] you're crazy OD ball no no wonder they
[1:17:49] think you're foolish no wonder they they
[1:17:51] can't understand why you don't cluck up
[1:17:54] with them getting to that little popular
[1:17:56] thing you're just sitting always on the
[1:17:58] other side yeah where's that little
[1:18:01] inclusive oh is it
[1:18:04] now you know you see these little this
[1:18:06] three
[1:18:07] here and this little bubble says now we
[1:18:10] are inclusive now we've got you know all
[1:18:13] all everything but these they're walking
[1:18:17] a different life right so just just
[1:18:20] think about this here we are a word of
[1:18:24] God that's being revealed to the church
[1:18:26] in order for the Rapture and go to the
[1:18:29] the going home yes many shall uh run to
[1:18:32] and fro and knowledge shall increase
[1:18:35] certainly okay so this is you end time
[1:18:39] generation I'm looking at
[1:18:42] you Oddball making up your mind where we
[1:18:45] now almost the last one seek light okay
[1:18:50] uh very famous guy he's a neurologist he
[1:18:55] used the study of the brain to tie that
[1:18:58] into nutrition into fitness into so have
[1:19:03] any anyone heard of Andrew huberman
[1:19:06] Andrew huberman so here verba I've quote
[1:19:10] him I don't know if he's a Christian but
[1:19:12] he is science back he's looking at
[1:19:14] science he's looking at what the brain
[1:19:16] needs okay every mental health condition
[1:19:19] we are aware of is made better through
[1:19:21] the simple zero cost adjustments to our
[1:19:24] our interactions with light it sits at
[1:19:28] the foundation of our wiring of our
[1:19:31] nervous system okay what I'm trying to
[1:19:34] say there what is the condition of the
[1:19:36] world today is the world chasing light
[1:19:39] or is it chasing Darkness if you start
[1:19:42] looking at where let's go from a
[1:19:44] physical point of view and and and it's
[1:19:47] actually quite funny when I used to take
[1:19:49] the trip um to to Wellington on the
[1:19:51] train in and
[1:19:52] out if I if I couldn't feel temperature
[1:19:56] if I couldn't see outside the windows I
[1:19:58] could look at people's faces and I can
[1:20:00] tell you is it summer or is it winter
[1:20:03] cuz the deficiency of vitamin D on those
[1:20:06] faces they are morbid they are down and
[1:20:09] I'm telling you if it wasn't for the
[1:20:11] Lord I would would it be one of them
[1:20:13] right you if it rains a little bit too
[1:20:16] much you go when's the sun's out you
[1:20:19] know like yesterday we were just having
[1:20:21] a jubilee because we could see some sun
[1:20:23] on our face you know so now in the
[1:20:26] spiritual is the Lord uh sorry is the
[1:20:29] world chasing light right we will be in
[1:20:32] a different state if we are chasing and
[1:20:35] we after light if we seeking light all
[1:20:38] right with the light comes joy joy in
[1:20:41] the morning we just just restore the joy
[1:20:44] of my salvation just remind me Lord what
[1:20:46] have you done for me I'm looking back at
[1:20:48] my life and go yep he's done quite a bit
[1:20:52] I'm so happy I am full of joy boy peace
[1:20:56] that passes all understanding where I am
[1:20:58] right now because of that because of the
[1:21:01] light because of the joy and of course
[1:21:04] then rest
[1:21:07] rest rest what do I do what do I mean
[1:21:09] with with rest what is rest do we just
[1:21:12] sleep what's rest relax relax okay
[1:21:17] Lord's got this if if we've been through
[1:21:20] all this now and we get to this point
[1:21:22] and we go I've got the light I'm faing
[1:21:24] the light I've got the joy got the joy
[1:21:26] in my
[1:21:27] heart rest what's rest seventh day the
[1:21:31] seventh day God rested said he okay how
[1:21:34] do we rest in this day end time
[1:21:37] generation got the Holy Ghost we can
[1:21:40] rest Lord I want to jump onto your
[1:21:43] economy not this up and down fluctuation
[1:21:45] of the world show me what do I need to
[1:21:49] do for you to to please you to glorify
[1:21:52] you today
[1:21:54] rest don't worry about
[1:21:59] yourself I made a little note just here
[1:22:01] of um the importance of Your Life
[1:22:04] Choices between 13 and 23 most of you
[1:22:07] are there okay girls and boys sorry I
[1:22:11] said girls and boys um brothers and
[1:22:15] sisters this uh decide on this day who's
[1:22:19] who's who's in your team who you rooting
[1:22:22] for okay
[1:22:26] because G because God cannot change okay
[1:22:32] Hebrews yet because of this you will
[1:22:35] always always change take my life now I
[1:22:40] am now 44 I can drive a 4x4 I'm 44 okay
[1:22:44] my life's been changing ever since okay
[1:22:48] never never um had
[1:22:51] a I can probably say I've never had a
[1:22:54] dull
[1:22:55] moment I'm thinking of the of the lady
[1:22:58] specifically here I'm saying don't hoard
[1:23:02] in your heart don't keep baggage in your
[1:23:05] heart don't don't hold on to it this
[1:23:08] journey is very long and a lot of change
[1:23:10] comes leave it leave it there leave it
[1:23:13] at the altar because canot and I said
[1:23:17] this be because God cannot change you
[1:23:21] will always change I want to bring this
[1:23:23] now here the most dangerous thing in
[1:23:26] Africa and we can maybe get a few hands
[1:23:28] here what do we think is the most
[1:23:29] dangerous thing in Africa this is now my
[1:23:33] opinion this is my thought okay what do
[1:23:36] we think is the most dangerous thing in
[1:23:38] a in in Africa yes people people okay
[1:23:42] yep black m black mamba okay animals we
[1:23:46] would think so yeah kingra king
[1:23:50] cobra so if we go animal wise is
[1:23:52] probably the Buffalo and the hippo just
[1:23:54] for your
[1:23:55] reference it's stale
[1:23:59] water in Africa and and because I come
[1:24:02] from there this is my reference point I
[1:24:04] see true thirsty people I see people
[1:24:07] that will walk for KS and KS for a fresh
[1:24:10] bucket of water at one tap for a village
[1:24:13] Village of thousands thousands of people
[1:24:15] they want that fresh water the thing the
[1:24:18] life lessons you will be drilled into is
[1:24:21] do not drink from any water not any
[1:24:24] water source if that stale if it's been
[1:24:27] sitting there it's years old it's TI to
[1:24:29] the scripture if it's been stale it's
[1:24:32] years old nothing there's no movement
[1:24:34] there's not stay away from it there's
[1:24:36] dangerous there's parasites it lives in
[1:24:38] you it it kills you from the inside keep
[1:24:41] away from stale water if there's fresh
[1:24:44] water flowing here wherever you are and
[1:24:47] wherever in your walk keep drinking that
[1:24:50] okay stay away from stale water dirty
[1:24:54] water if it's pouring out and it's
[1:24:56] taking back in there's there's a flow
[1:24:59] and we can use
[1:25:01] that drink from that and then I probably
[1:25:05] want to close with this
[1:25:09] um why David was a man after God's Own
[1:25:12] Heart tying this now back to my life
[1:25:15] lesson why David was a a man after God's
[1:25:19] Own Heart why did he say that so from my
[1:25:22] thoughts I'm thinking repentance
[1:25:25] and he lived and he loved the law how he
[1:25:30] really danced around the ark when it
[1:25:32] come back you know he was just he he
[1:25:35] loved the Lord he loved the law he lived
[1:25:39] the law you know he could kill Saul he
[1:25:42] didn't because he knew the order of the
[1:25:44] law so can we go to acts
[1:25:48] 13 and this is
[1:25:50] me in
[1:25:53] closing act
[1:25:56] 13 say Amen if you're
[1:26:04] there and when he removed him he raised
[1:26:07] up unto David to be their King is now
[1:26:10] he's talking about Saul removed him he
[1:26:12] raised him up unto David to be their
[1:26:14] King to whom also now this is the
[1:26:17] important bit I think sometimes we might
[1:26:20] just scheme over this to whom also he
[1:26:22] gave testimony
[1:26:24] and said I found David the son of Jesse
[1:26:28] a man after my own heart which shall
[1:26:30] fulfill all my will so this is a guy
[1:26:34] that's been and this is in Acts New
[1:26:36] Testament David's in the old talking
[1:26:38] about here what's David's been through
[1:26:42] with biva with the all the fights all
[1:26:46] the war the hand of war that was on his
[1:26:49] life he had a testimony so he had a life
[1:26:52] lesson so he learned from it
[1:26:54] so because he learned from it God could
[1:26:57] use him to fulfill his word to fulfill
[1:27:00] his will so of this man's seed ha God
[1:27:04] according to his promise raised unto
[1:27:06] Israel a a savior
[1:27:10] Jesus when John had first pre uh
[1:27:13] preached before his coming the baptism
[1:27:15] of repentance to all the people of
[1:27:18] Israel okay and in closing I just want
[1:27:21] to
[1:27:22] say some life lessons version
[1:27:26] 45 okay so it never stops it always
[1:27:30] always sticks on so take the good leave
[1:27:33] the bad anyone's opinion what do we do
[1:27:36] with
[1:27:37] it Chuck it away come and come to the
[1:27:41] Fountain come to the spring come drink
[1:27:44] of the The Living Water leave the St
[1:27:48] water Alone um you will have a lot of
[1:27:51] life lessons been thrown at you if you
[1:27:54] make that choice if you stand for the
