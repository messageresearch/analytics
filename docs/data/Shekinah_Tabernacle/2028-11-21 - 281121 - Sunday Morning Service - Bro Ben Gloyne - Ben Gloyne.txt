christ the name above all names amen you know when that name is spoken did you know when that name is spoken by a sincere heart demons demons they move they run when that name is spoken you know when you speak not just verbalize it but speak it angels respond the bible says mountains they jump and they hop like little calves towards his voice so so the moment we say we greet you in the name of our lord jesus christ somebody should say amen you know because it's a is the name above all names sorry sorry for that excitement we want to sing a song that you all know but because we are the eagles and we believe that eagles wait and eagles don't eat any food and eagles fly high more than any other bed and eagles they can see better the higher they fly so thank you so much ahmad for that name i

and made me free praise the lord amen thank you musicians thank you brother honest amen thank you for the specials praise god hallelujah amen it's great to have everyone here this morning uh before we go to we're going to read from first john 3 but before we go there i just got one notice that um directly after service if everyone wants to stay behind we're going to talk about how we plan to adopt the traffic light system because that's going to happen starting from the 3rd of december so if you want to stay behind they'll be good so we can talk about that um and we've got a yeah so first john three and one i'd like to thank brother isaac for the service on wednesday if anyone has not heard that i thoroughly basically it's homework go i was gonna encourage you but you should go listen to that amen and i want to just come in behind that this morning and um just um continue on in that thought because i mean now we are the sons of god amen and um yeah so let's just let's just read read the scripture here so first john 3 and 1 and then we're going to go to hebrews chapter 2. so first john 3 and 1 just the first two verses here behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now everyone say now now we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is i mean we're going to go to hebrews chapter 2 and we're going to read from verse 10 down to verse 15 here amen so hebrews 2 and 10. it says here for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i'll declare thy name until my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i'll put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me for as much sin as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death for all their lifetime subject to bondage amen um we've got a couple of prayer requests this morning i want to pray for tessa and talia they're both unwell at home and also we've got a prayer request for this work colleague uh max who's who's um yes we need to pray for him so if you ever need to lift it for the lord with an upraised hand amen and let's just approach god's great throne of mercy and grace and prayer this morning gracious heavenly father how glad we are lord in your presence there is rest lord in your presence there is a fullness of joy thank you lord that you are our source of strength everything we have need of is in you o god and we're so thankful because of your shed blood we can come boldly before your throne of grace this morning as a people as individuals lord as those who have been ransomed by your blood i want to thank you very much lord for what you've done in our lives and what you are doing lord you're still a miracle working god promise keeping miracle working god this morning and father we just want to pray for this and talia lord who are both unwell at home lord we want to thank you to buy your stripes they are healed so lord i pray that you attach their bodies father may you just take all symptoms of sickness from them in the name of jesus christ and may you fully restore their health for your glory and father also jesus workmate max father as he is is coming back to work on monday father you understand the situation everything going on there father i pray just take supreme control lord and may you be glorified through that situation lord we want to commit it into your hands and fathers as we have read your great divine word lord we know anyone who can read can open the pages of your word lord of your bible but it takes you the great divine author to come and anoint it to our hearts and to make it live so father i pray you to anoint your word to our hearts this morning lord may bring forth a hundred fold father may you just have preeminence in this service take control and lord we want to submit our lives under your hand father lord i ask you to forgive us of all our sins and our iniquities our trespasses may our whole lives be under your blood and lord those who are streaming father i pray you'll be their portion as well granted dear god we love you and we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning so i want to just kind of continue on i really enjoyed that on on on wednesday where it wasn't just a sermon a thought but it was a reality i mean because now we are living in the time where the sons and daughters of god will be fully manifested upon the earth you know this is an adoption season you know we know that uh in the book of galatians where where it says that you know we're all under the uh uh that that when the fullness of time was come god would send forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons now as brother isaac said and as the scriptures say that that adoption is the placing of a son and a family so it's not getting someone say from china or some other country not your not your family and bringing them into your family you know and then illegally adopting them into your family it's not that it's a son or daughter that's birthed into the family born into the family they get placed in position power and authority within that family now this is the season of the adoption or the placing of the sons and daughters of god in their rightful position and what i love about you know an adoption is actually everything is coming to their position in this day right it's just like when moses and joshua they would actually define the boundaries of say moab or you know you know of of edom or different nations around where the where israel would be in the promised land you know he would say that this is their inheritance they'd say mount sia's there inheritance and moab this is their land and this is the you know different ones and he'd say don't don't meddle with them you know just just just pass on through you have a different inheritance your inheritance is across jordan it's not on the other side of jordan and you know and and so so the so the borders of the different nations would be defined in those ministries now it's the same thing now under the ministry of the holy ghost in this day where the inheritance or the borders of every person on the earth is actually and the devil himself has been defined so for example what's the inheritance of the bride eternal life amen that we would be lifted up high above everything that can be named because we joint ears with christ by the blood of jesus christ so so god has defined our inheritance or our borders you know so that is the that is the believer filled with the holy ghost the true bride of christ you know that's the wise virgin as as jesus would say in the parable of the wise and foolish the foolish one has a different adherence they still get eternal life but they have to give their lives in the great tribulation but they'll be there on the other side but they have a different kind of inheritance right and then and in the world well they get their inheritance too because everyone's gonna everyone's so they're gonna reap right you know this this world has unfortunately reap corruption it will get destruction you know but you know those who sow eternal life i mean they will reap it i mean so if they give their lives to the lord they lose their lives they shall get it in the end hallelujah so everyone's everyone's inheritance has been defined even the devil's inheritance because god said satan i've created hell for you and your angels that is your portion that is your inheritance right but that's not our inheritance that's not our lot amen that's their lot but it's not my lot hallelujah i'm so glad that god and his great grace decided you're not going there he went there for me amen he became a sinner he died on calvary as a sinner with my sin upon his shoulders and he went to hell that i don't need to go hallelujah amen so so even in the old testament as the borders of the different nations around the promised land will be defined i mean so everyone's inheritance or portion would be defined in this day and it's really our choice what we want to be you know caleb and joshua decided the land's owls let's go get it it's mine thanks you know we know it was god moving on their hearts it was revealed to them but they decided to agree with that revelation i mean so same with us we have to agree with the word here first it anchors down here and it produces what it says it will produce amen so you know i would just agree lord the rapture is mine hallelujah what i love about you know we read that scripture there in in hebrews chapter 2 where he would be the captain of our salvation right so he says for it became him of whom are all things and by by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings now that word captain is the same as it says in hebrews 12 the author and finisher of our faith amen so this captain that he has been made amen that means a leader it's one who initiates and carries it through right so god doesn't start a work that he can't finish right he cannot start a work and he and he cannot finish it he starts to work he's going to finish that work amen he is determined amen because remember our god one thing he cannot be is defeated our god cannot be defeated jesus christ is undefeatable amen death couldn't defeat him amen culture couldn't defeat him religion couldn't defeat him superstition couldn't defeat him nothing could defeat him in this earth or or in the worlds below hal couldn't defeat him satan couldn't defeat him death couldn't defeat him he's undefeatable right so if he is declared in his word he's gave a bride in this end time i mean she's been made in his image without spot or wrinkle right she's going to be there i mean as sure as the rapture is going to happen she's going to be there but you know what i love is that really you look in the scripture it's when pressure comes on it brings out what's within people when pressure comes on i mean and because really you know if we had it all good and that's why the devil has tried to make this world so nice is that we wouldn't want to leave but it's also that he doesn't want to god to express what he put within his children but it takes adversity it takes it takes opposition and you know there's a saying you know when the going gets tough the tough get going right and when the devil gets roaring the bride gets anointed and the bride begins to reveal who she is because pressure comes on you know beethoven was an incredible uh musician but we know that the the greatest masterpieces he ever written was when he was pretty much totally deaf but but the thing is he had such a gift in his life he wasn't willing to let his physical limitations his deafness progress progressively got worse but he did not let that physical limitation stop expressing what was within him hallelujah you know i was reading about him last night and you know one you know yeah one place that said that he hit he'd actually have a pencil or a pen in his in his in his mouth and he'd and he'd hold against the soundboard of the piano and he'd play a note and and he'd just feel the vibrations that note through the pencil and that's how he'd write his music other places it said that he would cut the cut the feet off his piano put it on the floor and he'd put his ear on the floor and he would play notes and then write it down and with his hearing it was really the lower end that he could only just hear the higher end he couldn't hear but he put it into his music and it and and and it said that the re uh how he did that was by pure imagination because he couldn't physically do it and and there was one story where he where he he conducts a great orchestra you know and he's a standing ovation behind him and someone had to turn him around to see the reaction of the audience because he couldn't hear them but the limitations of life did not stop him because he said this place is brother freddy said a couple of camps ago there's just too much music in me i mean i have to i have to conduct it i have to play it it's the same thing with the bride of jesus christ there's just too much of god in her i mean we can't let you know the devil try and cramp us down and cramp our style and put pressure upon us we're not going to let physical limitations hold us back you know what i love about redemption you know it doesn't matter where we start it's where we end you know we can start in a lot of a lot of bad spots but you know as it said in the scripture there he's bringing us if i can find it here bringing many sons unto glory now in order to be brought somewhere you have to leave somewhere right i so by by what we used to call the yy express walking i carried myself from home to church your cars brought you here if you drove right but you have to leave somewhere to to go somewhere so there's a place where we leave hallelujah we left somewhere no i'm not just talking about i'm not talking about physical now i'm talking about a spiritual realm right because we started born in sin now this is just putting a couple of scriptures together where born and sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies that was that was our that's what our first birth produced right we walked according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience but remember down within us is sonship as a son or daughter of god remember we do not become a son or daughter of god by the new birth the reason we are born again is because we already were sons and daughters of god right it is actually god telling you you're my child right you're not just a natural children of your parents you're my child that's why i give you the baptism of the holy ghost that you would know that your father is god that's what it says when the holy ghost fell he says you know they cry abba father or my father my father there's a realization that god is your father and and that means you're part of god and if you're part of god god can't lose you i mean none of us children are going to be lost hallelujah he says all that the father has given me will come and all that comfort i'll know why it's cast out hallelujah so if god has initiated a work it's because we are sons and daughters of god i mean he does not just decide well they've come long enough and now now well they must be my child they're going to make no we already were that's why there's a hunger and a longing in our souls even before we knew god was god amen he was calling us to himself because he wanted to bring many sons unto glory hallelujah so there's a place that we have to leave amen we started off as slaves to sin amen now sin can manifest itself in many different ways i mean you know smoking drinking committing adultery whatever all those things but it boils down to unbelief so we so we started there we started in darkness alienated in our minds we started in shame we started in guilt now you can say amen you know but but this is where we were it doesn't matter if you are whole even now thinking you're a better christian than the rest of the world you started here you may be born in a message pew hearing all the deep mysteries from your from the cradle but you still started there right i mean we started in guilt we started in selfishness we started in pride we started in strife we started in death we started in religion but that's not where we're going to finish why so he brought us from those things i mean unto a glorified state hallelujah amen because he's bringing many sons unto glory and this is the age where he's going to fully manifest this we know ultimately he will be in the change of the body but god's going to demonstrate the power of his blood now yeah people think well i'm going to be a fully overcomer when i'm in the millennium or i'm going to be able to fully praise god when i'm in the millennium no no we're going to fully praise god now because what we are here is what will be there amen if you're free here you'll be free there amen if you're rejoicing here you'll be rejoicing there i mean now is the season of the liberty of the sons and daughters of god this is not god did not die on calvary for us to be you know half bound by by the world or by complexes or by the devil he didn't die for that he died that would be fully loosed amen by the blood of jesus christ you know what i love about redemption is it doesn't matter uh the state that we begin in you know there is a law in exodus in the old testament where it says in exodus 13 and 13 just the apartheid the verse says and every firstling of an ass thou shall redeem with a lamb so that's a donkey right so it didn't matter the state that that uh that that lam uh donkey was born in it could have been a purebred you know fine picture perfect thing or it could have been cross-eyed knobbly need you know stunted growth maybe things didn't go very well in the womb so maybe we'd be born with a whole bunch of trouble you know complexes pain grief anxiety guilt you know could have been bound down with all these things right but it was redeemable that was the main thing i mean the main thing is it is redeemable hallelujah so it doesn't matter what state you know we may come to the lord and you know we may be or cross-eyed and superstition or you know family problems nobody need and bent ears and complex down and problems from our past and we may be all kind of crippled up with those kind of things but we're redeemable hallelujahs it doesn't matter how we start i mean because remember in the old testament the blood of bulls and goats could only cover sin it could never change the nature of the worshipper right but under the blood of jesus christ his blood doesn't just cover our sin but the life within the blood the holy ghost comes into us and changes our nature amen that we are now manifesting as sons and daughters of god we are made in his image hallelujah amen so it doesn't mean you say well i'm not worthy to be redeemed no get that out of your mind i've got too many problems get that out of your mind i mean i've done too much wrong get that out of your mind it's not about what you perceive yourself as you've got to look to your lamb i mean because if the lamb was counted perfect then then the worshiper was accepted so so the pressure was never upon you and i oh can i be a son and daughter of god no that the pressure's not on you the pressure's on the one who initiated your salvation amen and if he's promised that he's able to do it he will do it i mean he never backs up he never starts calling someone to say well i guess they just don't have it no no no now when i'm talking about a call now i'm talking about it like a call like abraham was called this is not a blanket kind of people get under an influence of an atmosphere no god's calling that's what i mean that kind of call and if god's called you i mean god is going to do finish the work he's going to bring you into a position of power and authority and i believe this is the season just like brother isaac was he was declaring it and we've been you know we've heard it you know down through time this is the time of the manifestation of the sons of god this is the hour and now this is the hour i mean the things we've been looking for are here upon the earth hallelujah where god is pouring out his spirit i mean transforming people's lives i mean we're once lost but we're now found i mean the things that bothered our families for generations come to an end and because god annihilates it out of our lives he actually gives us overcoming power that it's not us trying to cope with our past and cope with our problems god just annihilates it i mean the things that once bother us they don't bother us no more because god's taking care of it hallelujah hallelujah amen brother brown was saying conferences he says i'm depending on it i'm not trusting what i am i'm trusting in what he is i cannot i cannot go to heaven jesus said i had to be perfect to get there be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven how can you be when he says look uh when you when you don't look at uh but don't look at you look at your sacrifice he says well a little donkey was born in the old testament he had broken down ears knocked knees cross-eyed why he knows he'll be knocked on the head he's no good but the mother could tell him son you're born with a birthright because you were born thus this way you'll live but the one that dies for you will have to be a perfect lamb will have to be offered so you can live they'll break um she says he is but you see but a perfect lamb has to die so he can live if you say you're no good i'm not worthy to be healed brother barum i'm not worthy to go to christ don't look at yourself look at your sacrifice i'm no good there's nothing good in me not even a thought there's nothing no good nothing no good in you there's none of us deserve anything but hell that's exactly but we have a lamb amen and that's the thing that matters and you see we've got to realize that in this time when the world is falling apart god hasn't withdrawn his spirit from the earth what he doesn't say well i guess it just got too hot to handle i know i just can't handle with what the devil's doing no the devil has to ask permission from god before he can do anything he had to go before god to talk about job and god gave him specific boundaries amen you can't the first time he said you can touch everything he has just don't touch him and then the next time and the devil would have pushed against that as hard as he could but he couldn't he couldn't cross that boundary right and then the second time you know because the devil said well he still loves you because he's fine you know because it's when health health crisis comes that's when people really you know the pressure really comes and then god just said to the devil well touch him but just don't take his life so devil took it to the nth degree but he couldn't take his life and god has to ask whenever the devil puts his filthy hands against you or against your family he has to ask permission from god and the reason god allows it it's like beethoven losing his hearing is because god wants to express i mean what's within you and it takes that kind of crisis or pressure to really reveal what's within you amen it's like it's like this this water this could potentially be any kind of liquid it could be it could be poison yeah it says it's water but how do i know that you know this is true there's some fancy numbers here with things the only way is to really open the bottle and drink you know but that's the only way to really see what's within it is to let it out and it's the same thing with you and i that we can we can we can play the part and everything can be fine when everything's fine but what about when crisis hits who do we depend upon amen do we do we wait upon the lord and let him take over or do we try and take it our own pathetic hands and try and fix things ourselves no son or son or daughter of god doesn't try and fix things with their own self their own mind they let god fight the battle they let god give the direction they let god say you say father what should i do in those and and you wait upon the lord and in his season he gives the answer then you can walk in confidence that you're not going in your own idea but you're going with thus saith the lord hallelujah but we are living in this hour where the sons and daughters of god are being manifested amen so never ever think you're not worthy don't look at yourself look at your lamb hallelujah because he is the one amen he is the one that matters hallelujah now this if he is the author of our salvation he's also the finisher of our salvation right so if he's begun a work he's going to end the work you know what i love about when pressure comes on and it reveals what's within a person you take the story of gideon here was a man he was hiding threshing wheat in secret because the enemy had come in and everyone just decided well we're not going to fight we're just going to go hide away and try and ride this thing out yeah and you know here's gideon used threshing wheat and secret you know then the angel lord comes to him now there's pressure in the land they're not living in liberty like the word said they should be the enemy had come to eat up the land and they were just trying to survive but then the angel says to him thou mighty man of valor so here was a man he was hiding away from the enemy and so humanly we would say this man's a coward but when god looked at him he said you're a mighty man of valor go in thy mind because god was not looking at his current circumstances god knew that he had to open his eyes of understanding to actually realize i am a mighty man of allah i'm a circumcised believer living in the promised land i'm a son of god living in my inheritance but he forgot who he was i mean and even manasseh the name manasseh means caused causing to forget so he was actually living under his tribal name he forgot who he was causing to forget because of situation and pressure because remember really when pressure comes on it should bring out the best in us amen and but it took a visitation of the angel of god to open gideon's eyes to say actually no you're a mighty man of valor because the name gideon means a warrior means a fighter amen but he was but he was living under his tribal name not his name that is he was given at his birth i pray o god that we would live according to the name we're given when we're born again as jesus christ is the mighty conqueror mrs jesus christ hallelujah so he had to realize he was a mighty man of valor and he and and you know they won the great you know they won one of the greatest victories recorded in history 300 men against a mighty host but god had commissioned him go on the power of thy might hallelujah shamga had to realize one day that the philistines coming along and and taking his crops and you know making him live just in poverty just surviving that wasn't his portion he had to look into really the lord had to reveal to him this is not who i meant to be i'm not meant to be bound down by spirits i mean by the devil pushing me which way and doing all kinds of ungodly things this is not my portion i mean my portion is i'm a son of god i'm a circumcised believer living in my inheritance hallelujah and he realized one day because he looked brother abraham said you know he looked into the into the eyes of his wife and saw desperation and looked at his children's state and then he began to realize by that because what pressure had come on what's he going to do this year they survived last winter but what about this winter and so the pressure really came on and he realized this cycle can end and it's in his power it's not in the philistines power it's in his power to undo it so he took his ox guard which is not a weapon why it's just a knock ox around to make them play on different things and he and he killed 600 philistines amen because he realized this is my position god has made me thus by my birth i am this i have not become this by my own ability i was born thus hallelujah it's the same thing with the believer by the new birth amen we are amen sons and daughters of god right we already were but it comes to life hallelujah we realize actually no it doesn't let the world fall apart right let the world fall apart we are not led by fear but faith this world has to fall apart it's been prophesied to fall apart right but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken why we have received yeah it says in hebrews that everything can be shaken will be shaken right and some of our humanity needs to be shaken away because we've got to realize that our our confidence cannot be in our own ability our confidence cannot be in our nation though this nation is a great nation our confidence must rest alone in the word of god and him leading us that's the only thing we can be you know have confidence in hallelujah and i believe i'm looking at a people this morning their confidence is in the lord i mean but he allows us to live in this time of trouble because he wants to prove to you i've got this i'm in control i mean i have not left you destitute i've not left you alone i've not left you just to try and struggle through it maybe survive no you're not going to just going to survive you're going to overcome i mean by me you're going to overcome this age you're going to you're going to live out what your predestination live out hallelujah you know we're all here for a purpose we're all here for a divine purpose you know if i can put it kind of cruelly maybe even your parents thought you were an accident but god didn't god never thought you were an accident no he planned you amen way before the foundation of the world amen and he ordained you to live in this season for a purpose he didn't just put you here to see if you're you know he put you here for a purpose just as my thumb has a purpose my eyes have a purpose you're upon the earth for a purpose amen and the devil cannot take us until our purpose has been finished the devil can't take our lives he may try and afflict us with all kind of troubles mind battles sickness whatever it may be but he cannot take our lives until god has allowed him to do so and the only reason that he would do that is because we have fulfilled our divine purpose in the world i mean so why should we worry i have life in my body because i have a purpose hallelujah but we should look into the word and see what our purpose is i mean because a lot of people have a lot of different purposes they have their ambition their plans their ideas they think that's why they're here no god has a purpose for our lives we are not insignificant i actually want to say the eagles are the church of today i don't believe the young people are the church of tomorrow no they're the church of today i mean if david could be a little boy 12 13 how are you what's the eagle anyway you know you know but here he was the church was in a gridlock against the philistines for 40 days the goliath came out made his boast bring me a man bring me a man and saul was backslidden king though you'd say the pastor was backslidden in his tent an evil spirit of god upon him the church was in gridlock right because the enemy just because that's what the enemy does he just wants to hold you there and wear you down and we're down but that's not our portion this is not a war of attrition this is a war of annihilation right we're here to annihilate the devil don't go looking for him he'll find you when he finds you you kill him you kick him out in the name of jesus christ so so there's that challenge going on but then a little boy you say someone from sunday school walked out he had his life he had the lunches brothers comes to the battle you know he walks in and maybe the older brothers who are jealous saying why are you in this prayer meeting why are you in this meeting you're too young you don't belong here and he's just following the instructions of his father he was serving in the body you're just fine you just start serving in the body start serving in your family he was serving his father serving your servant your family serving church and you'll find that god will put you on a path to give you victory just like david and then so he walks there and you know what i love is that the devil's boasts come to an end the devil has an expiry date his boats have an expiry date his threats have an expiry date they come to an end so goliath he didn't realize but that was the last morning he was going to get up that was the last morning he was going to have breakfast last morning his arrogant thoughts would pass through his mind about how great he was and you know the last morning he'd probably flex the mirror saying i'm undefeatable and the devil's been flexing his muscles for a very long time nothing can defeat me nothing can defeat me i'm going to win you know and then so he puts on his armor has his breakfast for the last time shield bearer carries his shield before him and he makes his boats for the last time because what had happened is you know history repeats itself the same god that defeated that cast satan out of heaven he didn't just cast satan out of heaven upon the earth this is in revelation 12 and he didn't just stay up in heaven after he cast the devil down our god pursues his pray our god pursues his pray he's a mighty hunter right so so the devil was cast out upon the earth and god chased him down upon the earth hallelujah and down through down through history god has been veiled within human flesh and the same look that was on michael's eyes when satan was cast out because michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels are you all with me that same look that's that satan saw in heaven it's not just an angelic form anymore it's now in human flesh the same look because the same god is vowel behind human flesh and so david now he was anointed by the prophet samuel it says the spirit of god was with him from that day on so he had a different kind of look about him he was still a little young boy and you know full of young boy kind of things but god was with him hallelujah he had a different kind of look because now it wasn't just him living it was god living it wasn't just david doing his thing god was doing his thing hallelujah so you know david david will walk out there before goliath and maybe the devil would look and say i've seen that look before i saw it in noah's eyes i saw it in enoch's eyes i saw it in abraham's eyes i saw it in moses's eyes because every time there's a clash it's not you and the devil clashing it's god and the devil clashing right it's god and you against the devil hallelujah says not you trying to defeat the devil outsmart him and that's what man has been trying to do especially in this age how can we outsmart the devil so we get to heaven that's nonsense no you can never outsmart him he's far smarter than you you've just got to be surrendered to god and let him live in your life get sealed into the kingdom by the baptism of the holy ghost that's how you outsmart the devil i mean so goliath looked into david's eyes and just mocked them saying am i dog you've come to chase me away with sticks and stones and different things but i think the devil said i've seen that look before and then so david began to prophesy i'm gonna i'm gonna cut your head off feed your body to the birds and then he says i'm going to kill all of you as well hallelujah and he picked up five stones because goliath had brothers and that should be the kind of grit that a believer has if i've got to take down everyone i will take down one at a time there's not too many one with god is a majority one with god it doesn't take a whole group it takes one person's fully surrendered to the hands of god and the whole world could be turned upside down you say that's too far-fetched no moses was one man under the blood of bulls and goats he went down to egypt as an 80 year old man one man invasion maybe maybe he went through the customs office what's your purpose a visit visit no business kind of visiting relatives yes other and he wrote invasion or deliverance or rescue mission and you know the customs guy would have just looked and said crazy old man stamp stamp you know but the thing is he did it he did it hallelujah he walked in there said let my people go and it wasn't him speaking because it wasn't his peoples god's people god was speaking first person through a man let my people go hallelujah and the reason that god god actually hardened the heart of pharaoh because god wanted moses and the israelites to see this is really the god you serve i'll show you my power that there may be a lot of pressure because remember after moses went in the first time pharaoh said you you know we're not going to give you straw anymore to make bricks you've got to go the work became harder the pressure became greater but god isn't afraid of pressure he wants to reveal himself in you hallelujah it takes pressure praise god but remember it's not just god doesn't just put us in this age to see us just wilt and be crushed that's not his purpose the devil's just saying i'm going to destroy you but you say no no my god said i'm going to live i'm an overcomer hallelujah it doesn't matter my physical state it's not we don't have confidence in this guy right we have confidence in almighty god it's the it's the sea gene of god on the inside of our soul that god has confidence in right and we but we're going to trust not in the arm of flesh but in the spirit of god i mean so moses said let my people go you all know the rest of the story what happened the devil was defeated and israel came out of egypt no matter what pressure came on hardship came on i mean why because you know it was god the devil was in pharaoh right and remember the cobra was this was a symbol was what was pharaoh's symbol as as the king of the snakes king of the serpents right so the reason that moses was told by god to throw down his rod it turned into a snake and then pick it up and turn into a rod is that god wanted moses to know because god knew that he could bind and loose the devil any way he wants to but he wanted moses to realize this power has been placed in your hand it's placed in your hand you have it you don't have to obtain it it's already in you i mean that's why i'm commissioning you at the burning bush right here is that you would know this power's within you now i mean we've had our burning bush experience hallelujah trust you've met god you've really met that pillar of fire and he's transformed your life what are you doing he's telling you what you have remember he said what's in your hand and moses is carrying the stick that he's maybe been carrying for i know how many years maybe shaped it a certain way he knows exactly his favorite grip and so on and he's been carrying this stick and he doesn't realize that this is god's deliverance rod that's going to open the red sea bring all the plagues it's not only going to do that it's when it's when he casts it to you know before pharaoh's feet and the and the magicians do the same kind of thing that his stick his snake is going to swallow them up so it doesn't matter what enchantment the devil tries you to hold you because remember the whole purpose of janice and jamers was to hold the people in egypt but we are not holdable we cannot be kept in this world we cannot be kept by any spirit of liar whatever the devil can do we cannot be held down we have another inheritance to go to and it's not egypt hallelujah i mean so so say god was actually telling satan through moses i can bind you i can lose you so i can loose you as in put down the right turns into a snake and then pick it up and bind and becomes a staff again anytime i want to i can bind you i can loose you hallelujah but that so that power actually lays within you and i yes remember that was a man under the blood of bulls and goats amen that that blood could not change its nature it could not actually allow that god would be fully in dwell him like under the blood of jesus christ but yet he did incredible miracles god led him to do incredible things hallelujah to bring god's people out now if a man under the blood of bulls and goats can turn the knoll red do do do whatever he needs to do as god leads him to bring a deliverance how about those under the blood of jesus christ yeah yeah brother braham says in one place now we could really have a service you know if you just look at that one fact what could a people do under the blood of jesus christ where they're not just anointed by the spirit of god but god dwells in them 24 7. hallelujah i don't need to turn the hutt valley uh river into blood i don't need to part the sea and walk over to the south island i don't need to bring frogs but there's things we need we need deliverance we need salvation we need prodigals to come home we need healing we need peace i mean we need joy hallelujah we need you know there's a lot of things we need but the thing is it's in our hand it's in our hand because brother ram says that the staff that was in moses hand was the name of jesus christ in the church but he didn't fully he didn't fully realize what he was carrying until the pressure came on and god told him to do certain things he just thought it was to guide sheep it's so much more than that you know if i put it this way it's like prayer prayer is so much greater than asking god to bless one another or help us in our jobs those things are all fine we need him to i i want to be blessed by god who wants to be blessed i need him to help me in my job right but but prayer is so much greater than that i think we shouldn't limit god on what we can pray for we say lord lead me into everything amen that i can pray for anything as you lead me into it you know because some people think well i can't ask god for that well you know who said you know it's like brother cadre digs now no i'm not preaching prosperity things but you know he's an evangelist from america and we were we were here um we were we were we were in in in wellington there's some big fancy car there and you know he just said to me you know you know brother ben god could give you that car and he could i'm not a car guy but but you know he could do that but in my subconscious i think no god wouldn't do that but what if he wanted to right am i limiting god by not by just thinking no god wouldn't do that for me you know it's like we can get to a stage where you know we see loved ones tarry too long out in the world i think well god can't give them back who said don't don't don't subconsciously limit god amen it doesn't matter where they go how deep they go we were in dark places i was like legion in the tombs i was separating myself computer games drinking all kinds of stuff just just totally iceland just basically associated with death but then he called me out hallelujah and i just came to a conclusion if god can save me hey he can do anything he can save anyone hallelujah it doesn't matter where they are who they are what they've done god can save anyone hallelujah so now david david he prophesied of of goliath's end and he prophesied at the end of the philistines and he actually said i'll just kill you all this is paraphrasing you gotta read it first samuel right so it's the same thing with you and i we shouldn't fear what comes against us you know there's no there's no record in the scripture well you know it says that one will chase a thousand two ten thousand it's not recorded that david countered okay so i'm one and he didn't say okay philistine stand still so i can count you to see if i can chase you one two stop moving three four you know i to start again no no he said i'm going to take you all out hallelujah because one is a majority with god amen hallelujah this is the hour we're the sons of god now sons and daughters of god would be would be fully manifested do you believe you're in that position today amen because remember we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons it says in ephesians so our destiny is predetermined to be the placing of sons hallelujah that's actually our destiny that's our path that god has put us on i was on a very dark path but then god said no no you're not that's not your inheritance you're not ordained to walk in darkness i want you to walk in light and i have a predestinated destination that you're going to turn up into and i just surrender myself to that that's a good thing isn't it hallelujah amen now to bring many sons unto glory so this this word glory from the thai uh bible dictionary it has a lot of uh definitions but it's so it's a most glorious condition a most exalted state we have been lifted up as joiners with christ right we are joint ears with jesus christ right now oh one day when our bodies are changing right now right now we're joint s see everything he fell here to we have right now this is why this message came it's an adopt adoption message amen it's not just another movement denomination man's theory no no god is declared through a prophet in this generation my bride's going to come to her full manifestation as she was in the beginning she shall be right now hallelujah you know what i love about them in the book of acts nothing could stop them political political religious pressure couldn't stop them hallelujah they told stephen don't preach anymore he just continued on they stoned him you think they could have put that fire out they put pressure on the disciples do you think they could have put that fire out no it's like a it's like a house on fire on a windy day that's how they were and the more the pressure came down the more god lived in their lives and when the pressure came down they weren't intimidated by it they said no we need to have a prayer meeting we're not going to let this linger because the devil just wants to disable our walk no no we're not here to be disabled we're here to overcome so you may feel yourself on the you just pull yourself up on the side of the road saying i just can't go on no no you can get on you can go on the devil wants you to stop don't stop keep walking just keep walking with god walking with god and they had a prayer meeting and god came down shook the place and filled them with boldness in order to overcome what the devil just tried to put upon them hallelujah because they knew what their source of strength was hallelujah and we should know that's our source of strength amen here's our source of strength so if the devil's ever tried to put something with upon you you don't have to live with it amen god can take it off you hallelujah amen and then you know they put pressure on the church and you know the believers just got scattered everywhere preaching the gospel so they didn't stop and say i've got to run for my life and not talk about this anymore no it was burning in their souls hallelujah so their whole world was shaken but god allowed it for the for the message to be spread so everything that happens in this world right now god is allowing that his purpose would be manifested amen so we don't need to worry about it hallelujah amen so this word glory sorry it means a thing belonging to god are we his workmanship are we his amen the kingly majesty of the messiah to be so he'd bring us under the kingly majesty of the messiah amen what is that kingly majesty amen that he is far above all dominions powers principalities of the devil you've got to realize everything that comes against you you're above it amen you're above the yeah the devil comes scampering along with his wickedness you're above it you don't have to put up with it you don't have to you know he tries to fill your mind with unbelief and trouble and double minus you're above it that's down to your that's that's ground level where where built the sword in the heavenlies he said no no i'm above this mind battle i don't have to put up with it it's not my portion god said i'd have joy peace in the holy ghost hallelujah amen a most glorious condition a most exalted state you know it said that he was not ashamed to call us brethren god testifies about you he's proud of us he doesn't hide us in a corner and is ashamed of us when he when someone else walks by a day says this is my bride this is the apple of my eye i delight in her she's my everything hallelujah that's how he feels about you and i he's not ashamed he was proud to die on calvary for you and i i've got a joy set before me hallelujah and it's and it's not you know and that joy part of that joy is here do you ever wake up and say i'm the joy of the lord i'm his joy hallelujah irrespective of of our of our perk your peculiarity of our of our humanity you know whatever is going on and what how we perceive ourselves we are his joy hallelujah you know he boasted to satan about job yeah he just said well you know he probably told the angels about job for ages but now satan comes along well i'm going to testify to you hallelujah and he pointed out job to the devil that was a man under the blood of bulls and goats says there's none like him upon the earth he's a perfect man how much more the people under the blood of jesus christ hallelujah amen so the devil's not a i mean god is not afraid to testify to the devil about you he's not ashamed oh you think oh lord how you know no no he's proud of us we are his achievement hallelujah amen amen it's the glorious condition of of blessedness into which is appointed and promised that the true christians shall enter after their savior's return from heaven now and but i could say it's a glorious condition and blessedness which is appointed and promised to the true christian right now hallelujah amen amen hallelujah we have been now you may think well i've got a lot of struggles no don't worry about the struggles look at your lamb remember his blood he is still interceding on our behalf until we leave this earth right just because the book's been taken doesn't mean that intercession has finished for the bride for people right he's still making intercession for you and i right now we still need his blood i still need a savior i'm still in this body i need him i need him every day but here yeah the bible says that he is our advocate he's working do you realize who's who who's your legal team do you realize who your legal team is it's not just legal aid some guy just rolled out of university the other day and doesn't care about you no this is the king of glory the supreme judge he is your legal team hallelujah and he's not just your attorney your lawyer he's your judge hallelujah and the case has been settled why because he took your the judgment we should have taken he took that down calvary that we don't go to judgment hallelujah so sometimes we're getting a fix how we ever going to get out of this mess you got to think now who's my legal team hallelujah who's working on my behalf when i cannot save myself i cannot guide myself who is guiding me remember the sons of god led by the spirit of god i mean who's leading me in life who's actually watching over me you know when the enemy comes in like a flood the lord says i'll raise up a standard which is god's word being anointed in the hearts and lives of men and women that god manifests himself into people we're going to realize we're anointed every day we're anointed by the holy ghost right because every day we're walking and satan's eaten hallelujah this is the this is the darkest age he's ever been upon the earth right but yet we're a people and by god's supreme grace we're just walking on saying i'm marching to zion we're not worried about the devil's shiny things that may it may distract us for a little bit but we just something else was says no no that's not for you you've got a hired holy calling hallelujah you've got a far better thing than what this world can give you know i would rather have the date the worst day uh i can't remember who said it but maybe it was the prophet i came in but you know the believer would rather yo you put into scales the greatest day the world could give you and compare it to the very worst day that a believer could have and the believer says i'd rather have the worst day ever as a christian than the best day the will could ever give me hallelujah because one doesn't have eternal life this this walk is far bigger being a son and daughter of god is far bigger than what our five senses declare right people people care about material things you know who cares about it our adherence is is in heaven hallelujah we have a home beyond the river and but we can enjoy life here too in a godly way right but you know we can enjoy but you know we i'll just wrap it up i'll say we are living in the season i'm just echoing what brother isaac said we're living in the season of the adoption of the sons and daughters of god and i pray just like when he looked into moses's eyes he said i've seen that look before he looked into elijah's eyes the devil dude i've seen that look before he looked into jesus he's certainly seen that look before because the fullness of god encountered in a body i pray when he looks into your eyes says i've seen that look before i've seen that same god and he says now i have trouble and he tries to put pressure on us tries to derail our walk but the more pressure he puts on the more god is expressed holy just like beethoven the more he lost his hearing the greater the music came forth amos it should be the same thing with you and i the more pressure and trials come on the more god is expressed because remember the squeeze does not perfect the believer the squeeze just brings out what's already in them hallelujah it doesn't it doesn't raise our faith that now we have overcoming power you you take a lemon you squeeze a lemon you just bring out what's within it or an orange or anything you squeeze it it comes out so the squeeze that we're now in and it will get worse right in a religious way it just brings out what's within us already because remember god has to prove to us who we are it's not just him revealing to us who he is he wants to show us who we are hallelujah you know brother brown gave the illustration of as the eagle stirs the nest it says about mama eagle you know there came comes a time when when when she looks down at her babies and sees they're ready to fly they're ready to fly and you know before that you know she would go kill something you know bring it to the nest and you know spread her big wings you know you know above the little babies and they'd look up and say mama you're so powerful you're so incredible but they don't realize they are like mama the same life and mama is the same life in them but now mama comes to a stage where she looks down at her baby says children well she thinks that children you don't realize but i'm going to reveal to you what's within you because remember all they know is than this they've been hopping around and you know but there comes a time where she takes out all the all the skins of the animals all the soft parts of the nest makes it all uncomfortable and then there comes a stage where she takes them up and basically throws them out of the nest because they've seen her fly but now they've got to see they can fly they can see she's built to fly but they need to see their belt to fly and that's why that's why a great jehovah god has been stirring the nest hallelujah because he wants you to see you're made of the same material i am hallelujah you're part of me i mean my traits are in you hallelujah it's not different it's the same traits the same god we'll do the same works amen manifest the same power and he right now is i mean doing the same works you can look at your life look at the testimonies that's the same god that you read about in the book of acts that's the same things in your life and he's been doing those things to show you i'm with you you're made of the same stuff i am hallelujah because why you're sons and daughters of god so don't fear this world don't be anxious for nothing god has your life in his hands i mean this is not just some fatalistic idea of what will be will be no no you press the battle amen we are here for a purpose and if that if my purpose is just
