he wants to do but the lord just from beginning you know i was sitting there was all said and done and i felt like simon i mean i mean i mean we came to the temple he lifted up the lord jesus the other baby said lord let me let thy servant depart in peace because my eyes have seen thy salvation i felt so satisfied you know phenomenal so praise the lord amen really appreciate that then brother

just yeah keep that prayer that'll be really appreciate that um there is a slideshow yeah i can't drive it on my phone so we're gonna go old school this is on i mean appreciate the specials too this morning i mean we're going to read here genesis 29 and verses 18 to 20. and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve the seven years for rachel thy younger daughter and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her amen let's bow he's in a word of prayer this morning gracious lord we are so glad that we are saved lord your blood atoned for our sin lord jesus lord you've washed all our sins away lord we can stand in your presence o god without condemnation lord father because you have taken care of it all lord jesus we come into your presence lord and you can take us in a rapture we love you with all our hearts this morning just want to ask lord may your gracious pour into us lord like never before lord may you just move in our hearts oh god we thank you for what you're doing in our midst lord we appreciate it so much just pray may you continue our god and lord we just want to just commit the service into your hands lord we always want to remember those who are sick and body couldn't be here today or think of lord stephen these are god may touch them and heal them father and you know announce lord jesus my robin lord and father be lord be their abundant portion o god and we thank you lord we love you and have your way in our midst lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seat so i want to talk about coming under the headship of redeeming love because because what you what the the your your leader is manifested in your life so if you're under the law you'll manifest the law right if you're un you know if you're if you're under the headship of this world you'll manifest this world but if christ has really met you really met you then then you'll be under the headship of redeeming love now now love you know the bible says where no vision is the people perish and so so if you have a vision then you cannot perish now redeeming loves give vision it gives vision now vision what i mean by vision it it reveals to you the end goal right so you're not just stabbing and you're fighting the air or you're stabbing the dark but but you see by revelation the end goal so when it comes to your family you see the end goal that they're made in the image of the lord they love the lord jesus christ he's filled them with the holy ghost and there and that makes them rapture ready that is the end goal right but but in order for in order for that to be manifested in them it must come down through the father or the mother into you know if their headship's not there come through them to the children right so it's very important that we that we have this kind of vision now i just wanted to to to me this this scripture here i want to leave it up for a little bit it encapsulates being under redeeming love because you look at rachel because the real love of god is a redemptive love so it takes the people from the muck and mire of sin and darkness under the change of the devil liberates them and places them in their position that god ordained for them before the foundation of the world right so it's a redeeming it's a it's a picking up lifting up and putting their ordained position so rachel was always ordained to be in the family of israel like she was not ordained to stay out of the promised land amen so when jacob loved her to me it was more than just a human love but it was a redeeming love because christ is revealed in jacob right so so his love for her took her from being outside the promised land being united into the promise of god through marriage right and then for her to live in the promised land that she'd be buried in the place of resurrection so so you see here this love now because he saw the end goal as she because he loved her then these seven years seemed but a few days because he had vision we're gonna get married he had vision that she was part of him right it was more than just i love her because of she's beautiful but he had a revelation she is part of me right so now just as christ has because he knows that you're part of him but there but that revelation needs to drop into our hearts right because love makes it easy because you think about this this is seven years he was a shepherd for his father-in-law there would have been times of great struggle there would have been you know very cold winters maybe sickness would come through the flock maybe maybe wolves and lions would come against the flock you know maybe he'd be sick in his body himself and he'd have to go after stray animal you know stray sheep and you know maybe a troubled lambing season you know some would die and you know there'd be hardship there'd be times of stress and great turmoil because he had a because he was commissioned this was his job for yo yo that he had to look after the flocks but you see it seem but a few days because of love right so now if people do not have the vision of redeeming love life becomes frustrating [Music] right but if you have if you really know the lord if you really love him it seems that a few days and it's easy right it does because remember being a christian does not make us it doesn't take away trouble right love is not an absence of trouble right love is not an absence of of hardship and questions and turmoil no love overrides those things love overcomes those things see so that's why it's so important that that i trust our lives are like this right you can see your family maybe things are in disarray but because of love you can look beyond that and because you've got a revelation of the end goal we're gonna go and a body change together you can look beyond the fault right it gives you vision you you look beyond the surface amen now we're living in a day now so i don't have um oh wait maybe i could fight uh see with technology the greatness thereof i should be able to drive it from here but i'll just have it like this now now so brother braham says this this is an um this is an um uh i've heard but now i see he says i want to speak on a subject that alarmed me today when brother moore and i were talking out today my precious brethren were discussing script uh scriptures and how lovely it was to be with them brothers like old times and he said you know brother branham all the preaching he ever done for us here in shreveport the lamb of the devil is one of the most outstanding messages you ever brought us here at shreveport so i guess with your message so strenuous to you today you never get you never get to one like that and brother says well if i miss that i miss my message he says he says he says love is my his dear dying lamb my precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god be saved to sin no more ever since by faith i saw that stream thy flowing wound supplying redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till i die so you're saying that the theme of the message was redeeming love right and so and so here so see it so shocked him alarmed him when when brother maul was thinking you know you've got away from that he says no no this is the theme of my message you know that redeeming love is the theme of the message it's not just something that's tacked on or adoption but it's actually the heart of the message is redeeming love that god would come and find us in our unbelief in darkness and he would lift us up by the power of the blood and make his joint ears with him amen that you know that is the theme of the message right so but if we are under that headship then it will be manifested through our lives right because you cannot say you love god and hate someone that's right right you cannot do that you cannot have ought between you know if you love god if you know that's manifested by i love you if i say i love jesus don't love you well then there's a problem i don't actually love god i think i do but i don't you see so it's very it's very important that this is the theme of our lives now if we have vision we can look beyond and see the end goal for our families we can bear them like the lord would bear the children of israel out of egypt now this remember deuteronomy is the last the last uh you could say sermon that that moses would give the children of israel before he is taken off the scene and says the lord so this is 40 odd years this is 40 years in the wilderness you know that mark this is how long god has been leading them through you know through the prophet moses and now they're coming to a junction where moses is going to go off the scene and joshua's going to take them into the land he says the lord your god which god before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness when thou has seen how that the lord thy god bear thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that he went until you came into this place now you see see this is the redeeming love of god see see this see being a christian is not is not the strong survive only right this is not the only this is not darwinism we're only the strong survivor no no everyone's going right but you see you see their journey from egypt into the promised land is was actually dictated to by the young it wasn't by the strong it wasn't by the youth and their strength that they could you know march faster and carry more and do more no no it was by the young that their walk was actually dictated to by so it was the young that were looked after because he says i bear thee as a as a father would bear his son which means carry right so now we got an education of this when we traveled to canada going through customs and being on airplanes and things where it was just chrissy and i we just marched through customs go go done done fun but we had children that we had to keep in mind of and they did exceptionally well they did incredibly well traveling but you think it's weird to keep in our minds how they doing are they okay they were jet lagged they hadn't had any sleep you know we're going through customs and different things but but traveling was totally different because our minds are on our children getting there as well see god doesn't leave us behind amen right he doesn't leave us behind you think well i'm struggling he will wait for you and walk with you amen but but this is how we must see our own families and and one another is god is here to bear us as a man would his son to carry us through you say i'm weak i can't journey it's fine god will pick you up he'll carry you along he's not going to leave you behind right so we need to we need to keep this in mind it's very important amen why because redeeming love should be our thing amen now john says here it says beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love but in and this was manifested the love of god towards us because that god seen his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we loved god but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins if god so loved us we ought also to love one another i mean no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us for his love is perfect perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he is in us because he hath given us of his spirit i mean so you can have all the doctrine in the world you can have all the knowledge in the world but if you don't have the love of god if you don't love the brethren yet the spirit of god's not in you amen right because love it's redeeming love is our theme now brother brown makes a statement i don't have the quote up here he says you can even love god and still be lost but he's speaking to the ladies and church age where people can have an imagination they love god but they don't love god in the right way because if you if you love god in the right way you'll surrender to his word why because he is his word amen but and also the ladies in church ages christ is on the outside of the church he says if any man hear my voice let him open the door i'll come in and sup with him and he with me and we've heard that voice i mean god has spoken in this generation he says he says i want to come in i want to i want to have fellowship with you i want to stop with you and you with me i mean to have heard his voice you've heard his word we've entered into a communion amen and what should that communion produce a love i mean this is a love feast that we're having right now you know this is why our walk is it's a this is a lot remember this is a love letter amen this is a walk of love with our god that his banner over us is love amen right amen praise the lord if we love him because we fir we love him because he first loved us if any man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love god and whom he has not seen for this commandment we have from him that we he who loveth god love his brother also amen i mean because if you get frustrated remember iron sharpens iron right so we have different personalities and god said well i have a tailor-made tool to shape you and he brings that tool here and you fell a ship together because it's tailor-made maybe a grid of sandpaper or a planer or you're a different it's the right tool for the job the right personality will will shape you the right way amen right but you see now if you if you do not have that capstone of divine love upon your life you will not see that and you'll get frustrated because you're looking at the now right but god has an end goal in it in his mind which is your perfection of and i mean that in terms of your maturity and him right because the blood of jesus christ reflects us amen but we have to grow immaturity now now we'll go here love god is love he that loveth is of god divine love not affectionate love there's two different kinds of love no brother andy preacher very good sermon on this now now we know we get into here um we we get into this free love and all kinds of stuff called love but it's not divine love it's a mockery of the devil you know that there's two different kinds of love there's a love called felio love and there's love called agapo love affiliate love the greek word means the love that like i would have for you as a as a fellow or my wife you have uh for your wife affiliate love now that love if you'd catch you'd be jealous of her if you catch a man insulting her you'd kill the man for it that's feel your love but a guppy love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference that's where people don't understand see it ain't some kind of an effectual worked up mental condition it's absolutely a genuine holy spirit of god that binds our hearts together in christian fellowship and love and i thought it was very striking he was me he was speaking about this and where i think pentecost failed he's saying the movement of pentecost failed he's saying well why did it fail because it didn't have the right kind of love right yes and you say well we're in the message this is different no no man is still the same that we can fall short of the glory of god because of a lack of the right kind of love right because remember brother braham says when the holy ghost comes into you it's like the size of a button and it grows and pushes out everything but you've got to let it push out all the business and complexes hurts and pains you've got to let it push out now if there's real divine love because of that holy ghost coming into you you will let it push it out right because you've seen because remember god has god knows the bride right he knows you he knows you're you are bone of his bone flesh with his flesh life is life that you are him right because you're married to him he knows that yes but he needs you to know that right that's why he pours he doesn't need revelation we're the ones who need revelation right because revelation is him sharing his heart with you right it's not head knowledge it's him sharing his heart with you that you begin to think and know as he knows you right so now you've got you've got to surrender to it to let it grow in you right people who put up walls and things you know they're not we have to be willing to overcome our own complexes right if we don't do that how can we ever have redeeming love for our families right you cannot if you're if you're a complex is a stronghold of the enemy but if but pride will stop people actually getting rid of complexes and so we've got to be willing to surrender our pride surrender our complex and let god grow in us right we just don't want a bitter god i want all the ideas i want to find the boundaries to this thing and you won't be able to because he's eternal but let's let's go on an adventure you know let's find the heights and the brits the depths and the wits you know all the goddess i mean not just a two-dimensional walk but a three-dimensional mean i say seven dimensional what are you wrong but you know everything that he is right that's what we want so we need to have the right kind of love not this free love and the world is full of free love people live with different partners whatever more all this kind of crazy stuff no that's not love but the kind of love that you if you have the redeeming love then you'll pray for that person amen amen you'll have a be and if you have redeeming love you can act as it as standing in the gap you can stand in the gap for that person even if they cannot do it you can do it see moses was commissioned to be one who would stand in the gap between israel and god right but when he got frustrated and smote the rock then he left that he fell from that position and he just caused judgment to come upon himself and upon the people right so but but we're we're called now remember there's power in an office you know you take you take donald trump right before he was president he was just a celebrity then he became president he was a possessing in office but then when he was kicked out of that office now all he is is a political agitator so he's just he's just fussing and causing trouble sure he's wrong i'm not saying biden's doing everything fine i'm not talking about that but he has no authority of the office he is once in because he was kicked out of it right so now he's just a political agitator you take someone who is meant to be in the office of father or mother or whatever it is or even even children in a family it's all a position if someone's kicked you know if someone's not willing to surrender to actually possess that office to lay their humanity aside and possess that office because of pride or a complex right then all they are is a political agitator all they will as fast as you and this is wrong and that is wrong but but someone under the divine love can get the answer which is god himself stepping on the scene and undertaking yes right so this is why we've got a you know remember your life is a manifestation of the headship you're under amen so i trust we can say we're under the headship of redeeming love even even as a sister you know say husbands can be doing whatever they want but if you have the lord if you really know god you can stand in that office and stand even even if there's a void of headship right spiritual headship now we read this here in ephesians yeah it's amazing mate let's just let's just jump here so so we're going to read this but let's just jump here now brother graham says in the message paradox here that there'll be ephesians again at the end of the ages right so so keep this in mind because you think about the ephesian church they're a very spiritual church yo he your brother abraham said that paul could teach the depths of christ to them but he couldn't teach that same thing to the corinthians because they were still babes right fussing and being carnal saying i like this ministry above this ministry and this person above this person nothing wrong with the ministries but carnality of man will lean one way to another we need the whole five-fold ministry right so we can't just lean against while i like evangelism or just like teaching no no we need the whole thing i mean so so that's why it's important that we can receive a gift of god that's placed in our midst right amen or would come but you see so so he's going to be in ephesians again now that ephesians remember they came to a junction a crossroad where they could either aim at and become you know grown to the fullness of christ or they could actually aim it but not become and relax now the word ephesians in the greek means aimed at but relax so that's all they could do they came that crossroad but they are anointed unfortunately to go to a map but relax and eventually the church had gone to the dark ages because it was ordained to do so he says now but we've come to an affections against in other words we've come to that crossroad again but as i said a couple of sundays ago were anointed not to aim at and to relax but to become right so when they turned off left we're going straight amen but it's got to be an individual walk this is not a collective walk we do not go we're not going in a rapture because you sit in these four walls twice a week church starts at home church trouble starts at home right church trouble starts because there's no harmony in the marriage right if we have strong families you have a strong church amen amen so now look at this so you keep that all in mind so paul taught the depths of of christ to the ephesians but then he had to come down and say husbands love your wives isn't that such a strange thing really think about it because he's teaching the depths of the inheritance of the saints and everything that they are but then he comes out to his husband's you gotta love your wife so what he's trying to what he's telling them to say you have all this revelation but you got to realize this revelation has to come down to everyday life yes right your everyday life is a manifestation of your revelation right so now if you realize just like you know says his husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish so or mean to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself so if you really love yourself in the right way you'll love your wife i was expecting a bit more of a volume of that age thank you very much praise the lord for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for members of his body and of his flesh of his bones for this course shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto the wife and they too shall be one flesh so it's so important that there's no outside influence of a family that actually controls you know the chur you know the church or the family right that that we don't live a life to please someone else right we're not living through someone else's expectations but we're we are living under the influence of the word remember every family is sovereign right so we don't do all things the same that's fine because we're you know because we're built differently but i don't live my life to try and please someone else right i'm not trying to have this church to please another church so that's that that's an outside influence trying to control no they may have good intentions but you know good intentions can be a big trouble true you know but you're gonna be living a life that you know you're pleasing the lord right because and your family should be lord i want my family to be pleasing unto you and by how do you do that you stand in the gap for them like job he would offer sacrifices lisa's children sinned right she'd lift them into presence well he he would offer a physical lamb but now we have a perfect land the lamb of god but how you can stand in the gap is intercede for them say lord forgive them i want to come to stand in the gap and because if you're possessing that office you can rise is not out of just a ritual but you can actually be in prayer and stand between i mean stand in the gap amen for your family intercede for them amen just like abraham interceded for lot when judgment was coming so we can intercede for our family because we know judgment is here amen it's coming right but you see he's trying to tell the ephesians look you know um you and your wife are actually one you're not two different people so they had all this great revelation but they but he had to remind them love your wives yeah you know because he's trying to get them to see actually the man the relationship you have with your spouse is actually a reflection of the relationship you have with god right so so the thing is now we should never ever ever tear down our spouses sure that's right yes yeah my hearing rate it is on did you have to think about that first that's crazy no seriously if you tear down your spouse you don't have a revelation that she and you're one or here and you're one if you if you take on someone else's opinion of your spouse you don't have that revelation because you should be a shield for your spouse someone runs them down say hold on i don't care what you say about me don't talk about my family that's when you see papa bear and he's not nice you'll hear about it and you won't like it because i don't care about me but you see that's why the thing you realize that you know but if people if we if we don't have that revelation then you'll take on someone's opinion of them right and you will tear them down we're not here to tear down we had to build up remember if if if a capstone of grace is upon you of divine love redeeming love then you will live this out that's your angle i want to see my family grow in the lord i want to see them more stable in their walk i want to see them love her more not to tear them down and do no no a tearing down is because of frustration our frustration is because a lack of revelation that's what people get from because the reason frustration comes is because you don't have the answer right but if you have the answer you won't get frustrated sure you may try humanly there's always that but no he said no no no i have the answer the lord is the answer you can look beyond the here and now and frustration and adult tensions is because of loss of control right so you see we've got to have a revelation that we are one amen you know and also if you are one wait let's just keep going because i've got a picture i want to show you but we're just gonna let's just let's just run to this a bit we'll get there now it's very interesting where where peter speaks about but you know brother man takes us to the statue of the perfect man now we're going to read down through um i want to get to a verse but he says according us his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory uh and virtue whereby we are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so he's given us these great and precious promises right and this is what he's going to do and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge patience and knowledge temperance through temperance patience patience godliness and to godless brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now we know charity is divine love so the cap of the building is divine love right now if these things be in you and abound they make you that you be neither uh barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but notice this but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his own sins so if you do not have these virtues in you by the holy ghost you cannot see he's not talking about natural side he's talking about spiritual science so if there's no remember remember your life is a manifestation of your revelation right you can say you know all the mysteries but what is your life producing see so because so if if god if you've really received the holy ghost that capstone of divine love's come upon your life you can see a pharaoh you're not blind you can look beyond what you see and what's manifesting in front of you and you can look to the unseen to the promise of god and say god your promise is greater than what i see with my natural line that faith is greater than what you see and you do not walk according by what you see with your sight what your children doing your family is doing or whatever it's doing you can look beyond that to the promise of god and you can hold on to the promise of god and account that as reality above what you see uh right in front of you it means that's why we should never ever look at the physical reality because it's not actually reality it's gonna pass away but look at the promise of god because that is your reality amen but the devil doesn't want you to look beyond that's right all right so here that lack of these things is blind and cannot see your off i pray we have sight remember remember it said for this age come by me isaf yes this word is an isaac it actually takes the matter out of your eyes opens your spiritual eyes is what the word does by the washing of the water of the word and god wants to give a spiritual sight hallelujah so you see see if we can see it far off we can have we have redeeming love because i'm looking beyond i i may be repeating myself i really want this to stick amen i really want it to stick amen yes lord no see see if we have redeeming love in our lives we can look to the unseen but while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so the current stage that we're in the current stage our family's in whatever trouble remember sin is temporal unbelief is temporal right that spirit is temporal that thing trying to destroy is temporal but we've got to look to the eternal because the eternal is greater than the temporal right we're going to keep our eyes off the temp yeah off the timbrel keep our eyes on the tail don't despair at what you see with your eyes may you get courage amen because god is greater than the problem we are not without help amen god does not make it you know put something upon us without giving us the strength to do it right so don't despair by what you see because the devil wants to torment with that fear right it's always going to be this way they've gone too far it's been too long it's no way there's no hope for them he said hold on satan hold on satan no no who said god didn't say that you're trying to tell me that i because remember the devil only has power over you if you let him have power if you give him room that's why ephesians says do not give him do not give space for the devil so if you give him space he has control don't give him space don't accept his lies amen now this is an extreme picture but so this is the solomon islands a couple of years ago they burnt down a whole bunch of businesses now i took this picture because so so in papua new guinea it's a the the the national i mean there's jealousy everywhere but but it's kind of more there so so we had family friends up there so my parents were living there and um and and and so one of the men he wanted to make a pig farm in the village and he even discussed you know you know with all the villagers because most of my family he said look this is going to benefit all of us it's not just me trying to make money you know it will benefit us all because pigs are very valuable there now you would think normally that people would just rally behind that yeah praise god you've got money you know how to do it you know let's let's let's do this can i work for you whatever more you know but they get so jealous that if someone starts to rise up above the status quo they just destroy it so they came in killed all the pigs destroyed the pig farm because of jealousy and i say that because they did that because of a lack of revelation because they didn't have it wasn't revealed to them actually this this family this man who wants to have this farm as part of us because he's part of this village right now you take that from the natural into the spirit you'll see jealousy comes because of a lack of revelation so now i don't get offended if someone praises christine or my children i don't get all but what about me and no no you don't try and tear no no no i get proud it makes me happy why because because if someone praises them they praise me because i'm part of them right it's not like well where are where am i in the picture like you see some fathers you know their children were going to be praised maybe for intelligence or sporting ability and you know but then they begin to say but when i was young i did this it's jealousy it's jealousy because oh what about me are you that insecure that you need to actually compare yourself to your child's house better than that guy no that's a lack of revelation right and then what does it end up doing this people burn down families because of jealousy because of a lack of revelation because they think well it's it's it's me and them no we're all one yeah right so that's why we should people people try and do this to my family i'm sorry the fire's gonna go on you you know i'm not gonna yeah yeah they deserve it no and a lot of people will tear down their families because their own spiritual condition is very poor but because of because of appearances they want to appear the spiritual one so they drag their family down to their level that's not redeeming love that's actually hatred that's hatred that's the devil working right but redeeming love should lift up right that we should put their lives above our own lives if we really love our families and one another we'll put ourselves above put them above ourselves yeah sorry i get things going the wrong way but you know what i mean right we should put out remember jesus said for this for their sakes the disciples say i sanctify myself right so he was because he could look beyond the here and now he says for their sake i'll sanctify myself remember he could have got married he could have children could done all kinds of things but because of redeeming love no i'm not saying we shouldn't get married please don't don't don't get into your mind praise the lord we want to see a wedding or a whole ton why not but you know but we should you know are we do we love god enough that we're willing to put aside petty things we're going to come to it because my question really i want to ask today is do you love him do you love him now frustration is the feeling of being upset or annoyed as a result of being unable to change or achieve something and then and then the and it's also if something frustrates you or it's a frustration it's the prevention of the progress success or fulfillment of something right true now if you take that into the spiritual it's not god being frustrating the devil's been defeated on calvary it's you right we are the biggest hindrance the biggest hindrance is not family or you know it's amazing how you say well i just don't have time because of this and this and this and this no no no no no no no that's putting blame you've got to we have to take ownership for everything i'm a firm believer we should take ownership for our actions ownership for we are our environment as a product of ourselves right and if we just let it go washing around we're the product of our environment not talking about our home life right it's not these you know like in economics they say it's market forces that's why there's inflation well it's international market force it's like some vague kind of airy fairy kind of thing no this is not some vague thing right when it comes to our home life and our own spiritual walk oh it's market forces that's that's why i'm struggling no no no it's actually no no you are a product of your environment and you create your environment so what kind of walk do you want see if we can put if we can if we can lay aside the things that seem to hinder us right and just walk with god but what's your motivation so you get frustrated you see this lack of control unable to change something well that's the thing we try and change it let god come and change it let god create an atmosphere in our homes that he begins to change us right because how how are you going to influence the most powerful thing will influence right so if so if the devil's in charge of you then he will influence the family or your own humanity but if god is in charge of you then he'll influence the family it's up up to them to receive it sure but who's your hatred amen no it's amazing where jesus was asked what's the greatest commandment and one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him saying master which is the great commandment in the law now he's expecting he'll just pick out the first one or the second one or you know but jesus said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart allah all thy soul and all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these commandments hang all the law and the prophets so you see if you really love the lord with all your heart and your soul and all your mind you will love your neighbor as yourself right because it's a manifestation that love you have for him will be manifested to them you see so so this is now if jesus said this then he has to give a grace to do it which is divine love right so this is this is what the whole old testament hangs on and you think about it if people really love their neighbors themselves you just take that this world would be a millennium there would be no selfishness there'd be no shady deals there'd be no backstabbing no political infighting there'd be no civil wars no people going hungry there'd be no you know sickness spreading everywhere disease they'd all be gone because you'd think you know honestly if we as a country were like this and then we see a famine going on in ethiopia some would say well i want food we can give them food let's give them food or there's sickness here well we've got the ability let's let's manufacture the drugs and help them you know what i mean because you want it right you want to be who who who likes anyone like food here hey man you're mad at my heart david but you see we don't want to go hungry we don't want to not have a ability to get medical treatment so why but see if we really loved our neighbors ourselves we'd say well i want them to have that you see what i mean so if we love the lord with all our heart soul and mind right then we will love our neighbor as ourselves if we don't love see it's a lack of love that causes division it's a lack of love that causes pain it's a lack of love that causes fussing and fighting it's a lack of love that's what it boils down to it's not well he did this and she did this no no it's a lack of love because love covers a multitude of sins right so you're looking to look beyond what you see and what you hear to the end right if you have divine love as your head it'll give you vision to do that praise the lord now brother abraham says comments like this all the way through his ministry anything without emotion is dead right he believed in a heartfelt religion i do too amen praise the lord it's not just it's not just having all the doctrine and the quotes right even though that is good right we need to have the right doctrine we need to be we should be able to put the bible together as the seventh angel has put it together right but anything without emotion you better bury it and get something that's got a motion in it right so it's not just a you know we we're not called just to be hard and different kind of cold formal and powerless but have a heart full of love because if we really love one another if we really love one another then we can help one another amen right if you have someone standing here with with with ought and just frustration against people it's never going to produce the love of god it's never going to produce a body change it's never going to produce the baptism of the holy ghost and the people see it takes love love's got to be the motivator amen you say well how can you love someone you have never seen you can and whom uh whom having not seen you love in whom through you now see him not yet believing with joy and speakable and full of glory hallelujah so you can love god but never see him right when he when he pours his love into your heart you fall in love with him right and there's such a power in that you say well i'm fighting something do you love him that's really what it balls down to oh i'm going through i just can't lay aside this thing but do you love him if you love him it'll give you power to lay it aside it's really it's man the gospel is simple like overcoming is actually very simple sure you've got to recognize the enemy you've got to recognize the one and he's already overcome him he said but i just can't let go of this thing but do you love god if you love him see love makes things easy love makes all things possible he would speak to the galatians he said christ has become of no effect unto you uh whosoever of you are justified by the law you have fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so if you want faith to work you need love amen you need love you see if you're feeling cold and distant from god you need to come back to him remember god hasn't gone anywhere it's us to wander right so we should never feel cold and indifferent that's right you say we're going by feelings no there should be something when you think about him amen you can be in the deepest pit of sadness and despair but you just begin to think about the lord think about what he did for you think how good he is because he because he never did anything wrong to you he's only done good things hasn't he he saved you when you were lost he was looking for you when you were not looking for him he found you and you were not looking for him he turned you around turned your heart to serve him you know gave your heart full of love washed all your sins away before he ever called you he made a way for that to happen right and he didn't come to you and say well you know if you do this i'll do this for you now he says i've already done it i've already taken your scissors down calvary you just need to receive it you begin to think about his goodness hallelujah it should give you a feeling eh it should give you a feeling of love right amen praise the lord so faith worketh by love so if we want more faith we need love they work together yeah he says and when you get pure unadulterated faith like your faith um like your love is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act amen see saying you saying i love you without any actions just empty words remember love is a verb it's an action word it's not just like and now i don't know somehow i got through english i don't know how you know i wish english was my second language and i could have a you know i said in self-defense but i got no defense but you see it's a verb it's an action it's not just a word it's a doing amen right amen see i'll just read it up there be easier say see you ain't complaining no more you know it's done just walk along no matter what the thing looks like what anyone else says you know what's happened you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as well as you love see faith love and faith has to go together they're kin folks they love love produces faith you say lord i'm lacking faith say well then let love produce that faith just love them or produce more faith you know you take if you trust someone you have a certain level of faith in them but if you love someone you have way more faith in them than if you just trusted them right so if you really love the lord doesn't matter what happens in life you trust him things are going bad you trust him things are going good you trust him you know that everything's working for your good praise the lord this is not in here i trust amen amen faith finds a source that other people don't know nothing about when a man has got faith in god he's got a hold of something he can't explain it it's something that he's got a hold of he cannot push it or shove it or pull it it takes him amen that's the way faith is when man really gets faith in god it finds a source that others don't see so it's not us someone who's really in love with god does not work up faith doesn't try and generate faith no no faith takes them to the promise faith will take you to the promise amen so there's promises of god that are unfulfilled in your life let faith take you to that promise that's not us trying to generate it push it shove it pull it no faith takes you amen how does it take you love yes because love and faith work together amen so that's why it's got to be this is not a manufactured this is not at a manufacturing plant right this is not an assembly line just punch through acts 2 38 this and this and here you are no no it's supreme grace comes upon a heart they respond to the word and come god's provided away that's how it works amen this is a birthing center where lives of birth into the kingdom of god but let faith take you to the promise hallelujah let faith take you to the promise amen amen see if we really have faith in god we have a resource others don't see it can look the same to someone else you can have someone who actually has mental faith someone has divine faith yeah they can go through the same actions but one will one's tapping into a source which is god himself the other is trying to tap into that source yeah it takes the surrender takes a giving of one praise and if you have a revelation that you're one with your family you give yourselves to them right it's not just a working right you actually give what did jesus do he poured his life out he put ourselves above him he valued you above himself just like if you go buy anything you put the value of what you want to buy above the money in your pocket right if you thought the money was more valuable than the thing you'd never buy it jesus put a greater value on you that's why he took the value of his own blood he said i'm i'm i'll gladly purchase her i'll gladly purchase them because he put your life above his own life he put his own your life above the life of god because he had the blood of god right so you see so so if we put if we have that same kind of love we'll put others lives above our own in value that takes selfishness out the window it just kicks at the touch doesn't it you know because we put someone other person's life above our own amen glory thank you lord love causes desperation i believe the reason that we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love the love of god i think that the love of god causes desperation if god is in you the tokens inside of you you have the conditions of um and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are it'll throw you into desperation i believe it will how how that that's weighty to me that impacts me it's like am i really indifferent to people's condition out there right if i am that's a lack of love amen there should be such a love yeah that when we see people it should be lord somehow speak to them maybe it's not their time maybe maybe no avenue to speak in any way but it should be in us lord may they fall in love with you too may they meet you jesus so help them lord yes see and it should cause big but you see love causes the love of god causes desperation desperation is not manufactured i've got to be desperate now this is happening the love of god should cause a desperation amen praise the lord now the word plainly states if you want to put this down galatians 5 and 6 faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love and the only way we can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is love's incentive incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have faith see so love wait faith is love's incentive it's a driving force it's a motivating force amen faith worketh by love praise the lord now so i'm just going through these but i i just wanted to do it this way amen he says see we're going to get to a point where we realize he's holding on to us see amen the lord that means me that settles it anything god says you love him so much you believe it oh i feel real religious right now so so why do we believe it because we love him right it's not because a collection of facts see faith is not a collection of facts and a conclusion and you agree with the conclusion that's not faith that's just agreeing with the mental idea right real faith is when the lord you receive it and then he proves it how can he the only way he can prove his word is by you receiving it firstly first and he proves it in you hey see see i feel real religious right now to think that perfect love casts out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting you're not oh i may be back uh oh i may backslide tomorrow i may backslide next week i won't worry about that i'm not trying to hold on he held on for me it's not us being so terrified am i going to make it lord am i going to put a foot wrong am i going to really know let's get that out of your mind don't be living in fear no we're not living in a like a slow motion car crash well you see the corner coming up and you're trying it's like no it's not like that at all this is not our christian walk we should get that out of our mind am i going to make it no he held on for me i'm going to get there amen but see if that revelation is anchored into your heart you can rest i mean you don't get worried about things how's this going to happen and remember if it's anchored into your heart for you what about your family remember the promise is unto you and to your children right so if it worked on you it's gonna work on them because the promise is all the same promise hallelujah see i don't worry about that i'm not trying to hold on he held on for me does that mean you just couldn't do whatever you want no if you've got love in your heart you want more of him amen he he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not me holding him if it was me holding him i'd probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he uh he'll never turn loose he promised me he wouldn't i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world you see i'll never leave you nor forsake me i trust that is anchored in your heart no matter what's going on in here it's anchored down in here he held on for me how did he hold on for me he went to calvary he said it is finished he paid the full price of redemption hallelujah he paid it in full he held on how did he hold on he said not my will but i will be done lord that's what took him through it be the same thing with us we say not my will lord but thy will be done and as well as his word praise the lord praise the lord see thank you god means god means for people to live by grace not by law we become so legalistic to well it'd be wrong for me to smoke be wrong for me to run around on my wife it's love brother not because if you love your god you won't you won't do any evil things because you love them too much not because you ought to do it i wouldn't do it it's because you love them so much you don't want to do it see that's why that's why i asked a question you say well i'm struggling with something but do you love the lord do you love him enough to lay that aside you see because if you really love him because you really going to think about you get in the mind better saying yeah the devil tempts you or something bring it to your mind but do i love the lord that will cause the temptation of the enemy just to evaporate you got to keep that on your mind because yo the devil wants to present you with another spirit that can be through a book through a movie through music through whatever and when it comes your way you think but do i love the lord now if you really love him you'll lay aside those things it's not hard because you love him there may be a battle because the devil doesn't you know he really wants to get his grip on there but you see when you realize no i love the lord you lay those things aside it's not something you've got to push yourself through and try and over no if you've surrendered your life to him and you love him those things just go to one side amen right do you like see because you love him so much you don't want to do it amen so the same thing with with with bitterness or resentment or unforgiveness or gossip or being malicious or waiting but do you love the lord do you love the lord above unforgiveness do you love the lord above accomplice i can't forgive that's a complex you gotta let you know or even a trauma can you love do you love the lord above trauma of your past see if you love him then the lord can take the trauma off oh i can't forgive that brother that sister they did this 40 million jurassic years ago and the drastic period they did that in my life but do you love the lord if you love him you can let that go that's why you got it you know it should always be a scales in your life because because god says why let the devil have real estate why let him hold you back because you've given him space to rule right remember a demon-possessed person has full ownership over a person but the devil can oppress by a conflict or something in a mind that's just a part of a dominion praise the lord the tolls are still in the room amen anyway but you see see it could that's just a partial dominion but you let him in to have it remember brother kaijo preached issues and open doors you open a door the devil steps in because of an issue and starts causing havoc but do you love the lord more than that thing if you love him you can let it go it should be a scales right my love for god or the complex god wins every time my god or unforgiveness god wins every time right or resemble whatever this person did this don't worry about that yeah amen it only cripples you yeah right amen let it go you love him amen do you see you don't want to do a worship but once perched has no uh uh or uh so actually no more conscious or desire to sin when he once purged in the blood of jesus christ he has no more desire to sin the thing is gone from him yeah you gotta put in a scale do you love him enough to let that go i say if you love god just an inchy little bit that's more than anything hallelujah that's right and men and women you know where you stand tonight there's only one more person knows it that's god knows where you stand so if it's your heart's right with god really live for him be true to him love him so much that everything else becomes secondarily amen everything else takes second place because you love him and then you'll love the lord with all your heart with all your strength all your soul with all your might god will lead you there the footsteps of a righteous man is ordered by the lord's your leadership in your life just love the lord right you're looking to make big decisions just love the lord and he'll lead you that everything else will become secondary right now that secondary does not mean you become like a monk in your household and you can't function in everyday society that's not what it means if you really love him his love can go into your household right you'll actually be the best husband wife child whatever in the world if he's in you yeah amen you'll be the greatest asset to any family when the lord is on the inside of the inside see he'll lead you then amen see us here now let's watch essentially where where paul would order this in the book of hebrews jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever sure amen we all know that but be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace and not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein so people have been occupied in the past of just the outward long hair no shorts earrings go on makeup all that all the outward appearance but that can just be but but if that is just the if that is the main criteria of being a christian which is not that is being established with meats which have not profited it didn't profit people just to be a legalistic outward form right but if your heart is but if your heart is established with grace now we know grace in the bible at the the definition is a divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life so if the grace of god has come upon you it will be reflected in your life so now if your heart has been established with grace then the outwards outward will take care of itself because do you love him more than those things well what yeah but what will my friend say about me but do you love him what's more important who's your god amen amen i say the lord jesus christ amen should be you know since i came i i came into my lord i love him so much i never want to go out there's something about the salvation that since i came into him he's my refuge and when i came into him i never wanted to go out i have no complaints if i knowed i was going to be put out then i'd have a complaint but i have no complaints why because we're not going to get put out all that come to me are no wise cast aside right so now so now if you've really come into them you have no complaints that doesn't mean life doesn't get hard right but divine love looks beyond that thing that causes the complaint right and looks to the end goal it gives you vision as i say because you can see the you know the end goal is actually my family circle's going to be unbroken on that day up there hallelujah so you're looking beyond the trouble and looking to the promise and if you can do that you don't submit to some unbelieving spirit in the house you don't you don't come under the hitch of a thing that's not ungodly yeah right you only come to the hitchhip of the world that's why i obey you that's why it says the bible says to obey parents in the lord right should be the same thing even with spousal signs you should obey your spouse in the lord respect him his head joe but there's got to be a yes like abigail in the bible his um um her her husband was nabel right david david goes you know david's men go to nabal and because they've been protecting his his his shepherds and things all the way through he had no idea what was going on nabel just got angry who's this david who's the son of jesse you know and then and then so so it seems away without any food you know nothing for the people and then so the servants say this to david david gets angry i'm going to wipe them out so nabel was a fool that's what his name meant abigail was a spiritual woman you know if she was just under naval's headship she would have been taken out with the rest of them but because she was a godly woman she could respect her husband as for who he was but he she stood in the gap for her family and went to david you see that's why i obey in the lord see amen because she knew who she was i could say in christ so i put it that way that's why we shouldn't submit ourselves to hateships that are not of god we should respect them but they need to be in the right place i trust this count is coming out right so you respect for who they are you know but when it comes to them encroaching on your walk with god that's where it should really should come along right i trust that help in some way amen so you see so amen and then also if you really have that kept set of divine love you know all things work together for good amen for them that love god and to them who are called according to his purpose so it doesn't say and to adjust to them who are called according to his purpose them that love god it's working for your good praise the lord sorry we're going to be through soon i think anyway so just a few more just a few more but then when we go back to your respective church now notice this this is to me this is this is so powerful when you go back to your respective church they've just had these big meetings go back with such a heart full of love that uh that a woman that you can't just stand or that man love him or her anyhow they'll know you got something out of the meetings then so it's not just saying because sometimes we go back from meetings praise the lord the preacher preached on this i've never seen this before this way wow that type and that shadow that's amazing that's not actually getting in here it may be something out of the meeting but there's got to be a manifestation of love which proves you actually got something out of the meeting right because it can just be head knowledge appraisal that service was so dynamic and oh that was awesome but what did you get out of it see if you really get something out of it then you'll love them i mean more than you did before you went to those conventions right so it should always be when we walk out these doors we love people more i mentioned to be that way you may be coming here this person no but you walk out i love the other men praise the lord brother sister come here you're awesome you know it should be that way shouldn't it why because we actually get say because love is a manifestation of that you as a proof you've got revelation see that's right if you don't do that then you haven't gained anything yet because you've got to have the love one for another then the people the outside world will know you've passed from death under life when you have love one for another praise the lord so that's why we've got to really you know you've got to check sometimes this is all in the head if it's in the heart there'll be a manifestation of divine love oh my lord jesus move everything from here down to here amen and hope make us not ashamed because the love of god is and brought in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us amen and i remember back in when i was first walking with the lord this literally happened to me when i was washing dishes the love of god filled my heart and it was that moment i knew how much i love him because of how much he loved me and purchased my salvation on calvary the love of god literally filled my heart like a presence changed my whole life amen it actually showed me god is love he showed he proved it right but this is how we should be if we've got the holy ghost it should have brought in our hearts the love of god amen amen amen praise the lord amen you come on and i give unto you i'm just going to read a few of these that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all me know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another this is how people know that you're the disciples of christ not that that you can explain all the seven seals to them though that is good but there's a manifestation of love they can actually see when people come in here trust me these people actually like each other they actually really love each other they love to spend time why are they such fellowship junkies why they enjoy spending time together because they love one another and look therefore we're all from different corners of the world but they're such a love that's what people should see if we're really the disciples of christ we love one another incredible here brother brown would say oh here we go here let but but live but let love be without the simulation abhor that which is evil cleave that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another so put yourself lower than your brother right prefer them above yourself and amen now he says this here i'd be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that i have had envy in my heart to know that i had in my heart against my brother no matter who he is what and that and that's trying to preach the gospel of jesus christ or live a christian life so brother i said i would hate you think about the enemies he had and the religious spirits fighting against him he said i would hate to have ought against one of those people that carried those spirits remember he could look beyond yeah he saw when people actually loved him yeah and he saw when people just said they loved him yeah that's right and yet he could walk in such a way not to have ought against those people who are hypocrites because he saw the power of envy he saw the power of holding something against someone how it disables how the enemy can say when when you know when a demon spirit's going to be cast out that demon spirit says hold on you've got envy in your heart you have no power over me it disables it just takes all the authority out of a believer so we can't have any envy against anyone any unforget hey if you want to if you want to see the enemy cast out get all envy malice strife unforgiveness bitterness resentment just empty it all out just empty it all out do you love the lord he'll empty it just let him empty it all out but if you want to have power with god empty that all out amen if we disagree a million miles upon theology if he loves the lord jesus he's my brother and it's my sister and we're now i just want to stop there if they say they love the lord you've got to take that at face value you can't just say no you're a hypocrite but no no no who's the judge god's the judge right but you know how to draw the circle bigger it's not just saying well i draw the circle bigger but don't talk to these people right no you should treat them like you treat those who actually know that they love you or you love them absolutely why they're drawing the circle bigger they're still brother and sister right america the hearing aid no it's not working it's gonna be come on amen praise the lord amen and withdraw those lines and if you can't love your brother who you have seen how can you love god whom you haven't seen and and brother when love goes out god goes with it for god is love and you can never get anywhere without divine love and he and as you love one another you love god love has gone out of your heart because of envy strife malice business unforgiveness pain whatever god goes out with it i want him in here all the time not just a sunday and a wednesday 24 7 lord dwell in me amen now just be real reverend don't move or just a few minutes be still don't get nervous just relax just relax and submit yourself to the holy spirit watch what he will do remember love gives a trust far greater than just to trust us right so if you really love him just relax don't get all tense see this world is a world full of tension but where we have come into a place where we can let off the pressure into the presence of god right so we come under when you come under the atmosphere of the holy ghost then you can relax all the tension of the day is put to one side because you start to you know make love to the lord say how great he is you come into his presence you say oh lord this is what i wanted all day oh lord this is what i've been looking forward to to come into the secret place where you can come and speak to and i speak to you and it makes you relaxed doesn't it amen you know when you're in the presence of god we you don't get attention say lord i'm so clear i'm so glad of your blood i can step into your presence where the people of israel couldn't even go on the base of the touch the mountain to go up into you know the pillar of father or mount sinai but because of your blood i mean i can step into your presence i can step into the pillar of fire and have a conference with you amen and what does it do it makes you relax and then you can submit yourself because you realize it's not you that gives you entrance he has given you entrance into his presence amen then you can submit yourself to the holy spirit and watch what he will do so don't get all tense about things just commit to the lord and love him amen just one more then i've got a big question paul said the life that i now live he lived a different life from from what he once did is not me but the christ liveth in me there is the identified token that god required identify with our uh identification with our sacrifice the life of our savior is in us the holy spirit i want a positive token there cannot be any more token oh my if you could only catch the thought of it if i had the power this morning with words to express and place it into your soul not on your ears but your soul would make and you can see the guarantee of it it takes it makes you so relaxed if you can really just anchor into our hearts my life is sealed in with god it's sealed away that would make you feel it would make you so relaxed you just rest and let god work amen and if you are in that way then when the enemy brings in anything you say well do i love the lord or this thing i love the lord that thing goes lord so i'm going to leave you with this question do you love him what do you mean you love him is he all the will to you when you really think about him and his greatness and what he's done does it mean everything to you amen if it means everything to you it's easy to let things go it's easy just to pass it on to him it is you say well that person will never ask for forgiveness but you can forgive them amen that person will never make it right but you can you can forgive them you can let it go you know but this happened in my childhood you can let it go amen god never made us to be crippled he managed to be whole he made us to be not just mended but whole right and and then then so how does how does healing come in love if you're loving your poor in the healing right so do you love him if you really do love him if you really do then redeeming love is your thing and your life will be a life of redeeming love we can look beyond the fault of your family your brother and sister and you can go and pray for them and stand in the gap right and you can live a life amen remember remember brother brown preach the sermon is your life worthy of the gospel he didn't preach as your wife worthy of the gospel amen amen amen is your life worthy of the gospel how does your life become worthy you come under the shed blood you accept his way accept his word right but if redeeming love is really the capstone in your life then it'll be manifested out of you amen your love there'll be a love in your heart for anyone even the unlovable because we were once unlovable we were once god's enemies the bible said no not just a fake like not a friend an enemy we were his enemies of scripture but yet he died for us in due time he loved us right so can do we have a love in our hearts for the what we would think humanly as the unlovable right and if you do you'll look beyond you won't get frustrated but you'll take it to god and let god take control of the situation remember divine love gives us vision right what is the vision for the family the family circle will be unbroken on that day it doesn't matter where they are how long they've gone i believe he can get them back i believe with all my heart there's no one too far amen so let's have the musicians this morning leave that question up there do you love him amen i trust
