[4:18] such an awful thing like you know and
[4:21] Eve even even and us life things die and

[4:36] pig side to kill these pigs like I think
[4:39] killed things pretty easily our animals
[4:41] know anything else but there was
[4:47] something Everage below-average about

[4:55] and then you kill it and his did you
[4:56] think like like things that are alive
[4:58] want to live you know they just want to
[5:01] live and I think God wanted us to live

[5:08] we choose life and he just wants to pour
[5:10] life to us you know that we could love
[5:12] he's not into dying and there's a place
[5:16] where there's no death you only have the

[24:31] amen praise the Lord you've got your
[24:36] Bibles handy let's go to to Luke chapter
[24:39] 4 Amen what a wonderful day we live in
[24:51] they look for we're gonna read fairly
[25:01] lengthy scripture reading when I read
[25:03] from verse 14 down to verse 32 of Luke
[25:07] chapter 4 cease hearing Jesus returned
[25:12] in the power of the spirit into Galilee
[25:14] and there went out a fame of him
[25:18] throughout all the region round about
[25:20] and he taught in their synagogues being
[25:22] glorified of all and he came to Nazareth
[25:24] where he had been brought up and as this
[25:26] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[25:28] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[25:31] and there was delivered unto him the
[25:32] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[25:35] had opened the book he found the place
[25:36] ruin it was where it was written the
[25:38] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[25:40] has anointed me to preach the gospel to
[25:42] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[25:44] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[25:46] the captives and recovering of a sight
[25:48] to the blind and who sit at liberty them
[25:50] that are bruised excuse me to preach the
[25:54] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[25:55] closed the book and he gave it again to
[25:57] the minister and he sat down and the
[25:59] eyes of all them that were in the
[26:00] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[26:03] began to say unto them this day as the
[26:05] scripture fulfilled in your ears and all
[26:07] bear him witness and wondered at the
[26:09] gracious words which proceeded out of
[26:11] his mouth and they said is not this
[26:13] Joseph's son and he said unto them ye
[26:15] will surely sound to me this proverb
[26:17] physician heal thyself whatsoever we
[26:21] have heard done in Capernaum do also
[26:23] hear in thy country and he said verily I
[26:26] say unto you no prophet is accepted in
[26:31] his own country but I tell you of a
[26:32] truth many widows were in Israel in the
[26:35] days of a
[26:36] when the heaven was shut up three years
[26:39] and six months when a great famine was
[26:41] throughout all the land but unto none of
[26:43] them was a liar sent save unto sir sorry
[26:48] / a city of Sidon unto a woman that was
[26:52] a widowed now remember she's a Gentile
[26:54] and many lepers were in Israel in the
[26:57] time of Elias and Elias the prophet and
[27:00] none of them were cleanse saying saving
[27:03] naming the Syrian another Gentile and
[27:05] all they in the synagogue when they
[27:07] heard these things were filled with
[27:08] wrath and rose up and thrust them out of
[27:10] the city and led him and to the brow the
[27:12] hill we're on their city was built that
[27:14] they might cast them down headlong but
[27:16] he passed through the midst of them
[27:18] winters way and came down to Capernaum a
[27:21] city of Galilee and taught them on the
[27:23] Sabbath days and they are astonished at
[27:25] his doctrine for his word was worth
[27:28] power amen may the Lord bless his word
[27:31] you may have your seats this night now
[27:36] like to I'd like to speak about
[27:38] spiritual food and Jew season an amazing
[27:41] scene we you know it always astounds me
[27:44] reading reading the scene you know we're
[27:47] just going to go through it a bit but
[27:48] what an incredible scene we have here
[27:50] here is the Messiah standing in the
[27:53] synagogue identifying himself in the
[27:56] scripture he's pointing to the the word
[27:59] he is to fulfill in that day an hour as
[28:02] we read he found the place in the Book
[28:04] of Isaiah swear it was written so you
[28:06] didn't just haphazardly reader read a
[28:08] verse but he found the place that was
[28:10] written and he read exactly the the
[28:13] portion of that scripture that was
[28:15] allotted to us first coming because if
[28:17] you go read where we are that portion of
[28:19] Isaiah is from he doesn't read the
[28:21] second part of verse 19 but he leaves it
[28:23] for a second coming which is the Stace
[28:25] one incredible scene that says he's a
[28:28] the Word made flesh is identifying
[28:31] himself in the written word but notice
[28:33] it does not people it doesn't make the
[28:35] people happy they're not rejoicing
[28:37] there's not a spontaneous hallelujah
[28:39] mighty Jehovah God has become our
[28:41] Messiah reason our Mets the word us
[28:43] fulfilled
[28:44] the very Messiah we're looking for is
[28:46] here it didn't make them happy they were
[28:48] angry they were
[28:50] angry at him and now notice Jesus did
[28:53] not bring his own Scrolls he did not
[28:56] bring his own holy books he did not
[28:58] bring anything else he read from the
[29:00] same Bible they read right so he was he
[29:03] was reading exactly the same Bible they
[29:06] read and it was the Word made flesh was
[29:09] reading the written word the prophecy
[29:12] concerning the day he was living in and
[29:14] what he was to fulfill and that made
[29:17] them mad so they were he was reading the
[29:19] same Bible they read no doubt they would
[29:22] have read that scriptures many times
[29:24] before
[29:24] but this was a different kind of day
[29:26] because now was more than an idea it had
[29:28] become flesh it was more than a and
[29:30] debate and what do you think this you
[29:32] know how do you think this will happen
[29:33] do you think what happened in our
[29:34] lifetime you know how is this all going
[29:36] to transpire it goes beyond that he says
[29:39] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[29:42] your ears so he's saying that what I
[29:44] have just read has become flesh in front
[29:47] of you hallelujah he's saying that I am
[29:49] the fulfillment of this portion of
[29:52] scripture that I have just read and it
[29:54] made them mad now
[29:57] one was saying mistakes the Scriptures
[30:00] fulfilled see they came they both read
[30:02] the same Bible but they both came to two
[30:05] different conclusions from reading the
[30:07] same scripture one said this data
[30:12] scripture is fulfilled in your ears this
[30:13] is the fulfillment Here I am and the
[30:16] other by their response was saying no
[30:18] it's not doesn't matter what their
[30:20] theory was of it they're basically
[30:22] saying no you're not it and now how can
[30:27] this be multitudes read the same Bible
[30:30] we read we don't have a different Bible
[30:33] we don't have the william branham
[30:34] version of the bible we have the King
[30:36] James Bible that's been here for 400
[30:38] years give or take I don't know how long
[30:41] you know so we all have the same
[30:43] scripture even if we had different
[30:45] versions they still really basically say
[30:47] the same thing so but how can people
[30:49] come to two radically different
[30:51] conclusions and it's very simple it's
[30:54] God reveals the truth of a scripture to
[30:56] her me well he reveals it to whom he
[30:58] will he blinds whom he will he quickens
[31:01] who he will he bypasses who he will
[31:03] he's God he's sovereign I just be
[31:05] thankful Lord you chose me I'm glad you
[31:07] chose me you open your word to me that
[31:09] makes me happy
[31:11] hallelujah Jesus says in Matthew chapter
[31:13] 11 he says that these things so let's
[31:18] just go there shall we just as I'm
[31:20] fighting with an iPad it's childproof
[31:22] I'll get the other he says in Matthew
[31:29] chapter 11 Henry and in verse 25 he says
[31:35] at that time jesus answered and said I
[31:37] thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and
[31:39] Earth because thou has hid these things
[31:41] from the wise and prudent and has
[31:43] revealed them unto babes so he says he's
[31:46] heading these from some and revealed it
[31:47] to others that's God's choosing you know
[31:50] the Bible is not a textbook
[31:51] you can't send an exam to see through to
[31:55] know the author you know the Word of God
[31:57] never comes to a Bible School right and
[32:01] ever speaks out of a Bible School will
[32:03] come to up let's just read it now
[32:05] second Peter 1 and verses 20 and 21 it
[32:09] says knowing this first that no that no
[32:12] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[32:14] private interpretation okay and now
[32:17] here's the answer the reason it's not of
[32:19] any private interpretation is shown in
[32:21] the next verse for the prophecy came not
[32:24] in old time by the will of man but holy
[32:26] men of God spake as they were moved by
[32:29] the Holy Ghost so he's saying it's not
[32:31] private interpretation they didn't work
[32:32] it out you know like Moses Moses didn't
[32:35] sit there in Egypt and plant a whole
[32:38] bunch of laws he didn't say well I'm the
[32:41] deliverer us I need to our nation's are
[32:43] going to come out of a nation they're
[32:44] going to dwell in the promised land so
[32:46] I've got to work out a system of laws
[32:47] that this nation can live by that's not
[32:49] what he did he went up Mount Sinai the
[32:52] Spirit of God moved upon him he said
[32:54] thus saith the Lord when you come into
[32:56] land you do this when this happens you
[32:58] do this this is how you should be yo he
[33:00] was moved by the Holy Spirit and he
[33:02] sprang it wasn't his thoughts it was
[33:04] God's thoughts right brother Ram said I
[33:06] wanted to be a trapper and this wasn't
[33:08] even my idea it was God's thoughts right
[33:10] God making himself known that's why the
[33:12] Bible is not a private interpretation
[33:14] because it's men of all were
[33:17] moved amen by the Holy Spirit so they
[33:20] spake as God spake through them as God
[33:23] moved upon them they spake up I mean the
[33:26] inspiration they received so the word is
[33:29] heading to the eyes of wise and prudent
[33:31] revealed unto babes now you would think
[33:34] standing in a synagogue they're all
[33:36] expecting a messiah they're all looking
[33:37] for him to come you think you know
[33:39] they're all reading the same Bible you
[33:41] would think that they would say yes you
[33:43] are this one hallelujah they could have
[33:46] just asked around a bit ask for some
[33:48] testimony they could have gone to the
[33:49] woman at the well woman at the well what
[33:52] happened to you one day I was bound
[33:54] I had a man I had a love problem I
[33:57] couldn't find love and I was married and
[33:59] divorced and married and divorced and
[34:00] eventually I quit I just live with a
[34:02] person I was wounded right because of my
[34:05] first relationship I was wounded I was
[34:07] bruised I was bound by that wounding in
[34:09] my spirit but he set me free sit at
[34:12] Liberty them and Oh Bruce I was set free
[34:14] hallelujah I received that ministry in
[34:17] now I'm free Oh Louie they could have
[34:20] just see that because brother branham
[34:22] tells a very very simply God
[34:24] interpreters word by bringing it to pass
[34:27] you know God tells Abraham you're my see
[34:31] thy seed is going to sowed you in a
[34:32] strange land four hundred years I'll
[34:34] bring them out with a mighty hand right
[34:36] they'll come back to this place again
[34:37] God interprets it by bringing talking to
[34:40] Moses in a burning bush commissioning
[34:41] him with two signs goes down to Egypt
[34:44] he's the fulfillment or the
[34:45] interpretation of that prophecy God
[34:48] interprets it
[34:51] God said a virgin shall conceive she did
[34:54] and when she didn't you too need to
[34:56] interpret it it was manifested voice one
[34:59] voice one crying in the wilderness
[35:01] Amen you don't need to interpret it God
[35:03] God interpreted his word he comes the
[35:06] Messiah God interpreted the prophecy of
[35:08] the Messiah hallelujah
[35:10] same thing all the way down through amen
[35:16] now we understand that the Bible is is
[35:18] divinely inspired and as we read on the
[35:21] church what's Happ you've got to get in
[35:23] the same inspiration John in the book of
[35:25] Revelation I've got three thank you
[35:30] water Amen god bless a good deacon he
[35:33] always looks after you Allu yeah amen so
[35:37] you got to get John was in the spirit on
[35:39] the Lord's Day and if you want to see
[35:41] anything by God you're going to get in
[35:43] the spirit right you can't see it cuddly
[35:45] you got to get in the under under the
[35:47] inspiration and the one who wrote the
[35:48] word you get into the spirit then you'll
[35:50] begin to see what the word says right he
[35:53] sees an Isaiah 29 verse the ayah says
[35:55] stay yourselves and wonder cry out and
[35:58] cry they a drunken but not with wine
[36:00] they stagger but not with strong drink
[36:02] for the Lord hath poured out upon you
[36:05] the spirit of deep sleep now I'm not
[36:07] talking about you right you take the
[36:09] opposite of the scripture the bride's
[36:11] eyes are open right we're not blind and
[36:13] we have been given I save holy and we're
[36:15] not naked I'm in spurts there anyway
[36:18] we're clothed in his righteousness our
[36:19] eyes have come open
[36:21] I mean we're being anointed with ice em
[36:22] that we see hallelujah so but so this is
[36:25] speaking of a different group of people
[36:28] they stagger but not with strong drink
[36:30] for the Lord hath poured out upon you
[36:32] the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed
[36:35] your eyes the prophets and your rulers
[36:37] and says he covered and the vision of
[36:39] all has become unto you as the words of
[36:42] a book that is sealed which mean deliver
[36:45] one that has learned saying read this I
[36:47] pray thee says I cannot for it sealed
[36:48] and the book is delivered to him that's
[36:50] not learned saying read this I pray that
[36:52] he says I'm not learned wherefore the
[36:54] Lord said for as much as this people
[36:56] draw near me with their mouths and their
[36:59] lips to honor me but they have removed
[37:01] their heart far from me and their fear
[37:03] towards me is taught by the precept of
[37:06] men see your heart your whole heart has
[37:08] to be towards the Lord
[37:09] you have to thirst and desire after more
[37:12] than anything else when he goes becomes
[37:14] first place in your life then you he'll
[37:16] meet you when you seek me with your
[37:19] whole heart you shall find me right so
[37:22] it can't just be a partial thing on the
[37:23] side it's going to be your whole heart
[37:25] has the desire and longed for him that
[37:28] you can't risk your stirred up oh I've
[37:30] got to meet him I've got to have a
[37:31] meeting Lord I got to know my sins are
[37:33] washed away I'm not satisfied with this
[37:35] condition and you know you can't just
[37:37] sit back you're gonna really pursue and
[37:39] I mean I first is a painful desire and
[37:42] the scripture is a painful
[37:44] painful I can't just I can't just put up
[37:46] with this thirst I gotta meet it it's
[37:48] got to be the saddest you know it's
[37:49] going to be satisfied hallelujah now the
[37:52] book to the bride is not a vision that
[37:55] is sealed but has come open write the
[37:58] Bible brother BAM says after the seals
[38:00] open the Bible became a new book and I
[38:02] trust it became a new book to you when
[38:04] you met the Lord it's no longer a book
[38:06] of history a book a parables a book of
[38:08] ethics or morals as Jesus Christ made
[38:10] known hallelujah well I remember when I
[38:13] when the Lord was dealing with me know
[38:15] over eleven years ago I was reading
[38:17] first your sick and Peter it wasn't and
[38:18] I'd read that scripture before cuz I'd
[38:20] read the entire Bible through by that
[38:22] stage but when I was reading at that
[38:24] time Peter was writing personally to me
[38:26] it was not Peter to someone else that
[38:28] was Peter to me he was at my dress he
[38:31] was writing it to me and the whole Bible
[38:33] became personal to me hallelujah
[38:35] I'm glad the Bible becomes new glory to
[38:39] God we don't liver this is not a dead
[38:40] book there's a Living Word only if
[38:43] you're under the same anointing as the
[38:44] word it becomes alive to you amen but in
[38:48] a more sane eleven now before I go into
[38:51] this notice it's amazing how Jesus when
[38:54] he when he stands in identifies the son
[38:57] of man identifies himself in the word
[38:59] saying this day the Scriptures fulfill
[39:01] notice how he it's amazing how he taste
[39:03] this fulfillment of Scripture and then
[39:06] he speaks to the ones that he came to
[39:07] but but rejected him and he tied it to a
[39:10] meeting a would a woman in a time of
[39:12] famine that that Elijah did so he ties
[39:16] it to that and he ties it to name in the
[39:18] Syrian who had leprosy so he's saying
[39:21] now I've come and now it's exactly the
[39:25] same a prophet is not accepted in his
[39:26] own country so I go to another so the
[39:29] ones that should receive me reject me
[39:31] and the ones are not really looking for
[39:33] me they find me hallelujah so now here
[39:36] it is where so so he ties these two
[39:39] together now Elijah we know he went in
[39:43] before I had a says there won't be rain
[39:46] or Dew until I fall I mean until I call
[39:48] for it and he just storms out and he's
[39:51] looked after by the brook and then
[39:52] eventually that dries up and God tells
[39:55] them now you go to a different country
[39:56] you leave
[39:57] Israel you go to a place of the Gentiles
[40:01] now this is talkie of you right this is
[40:05] not as just it's more than a story
[40:06] you're the widow woman you'll need your
[40:10] you're naman as well we were once the
[40:13] enemies of God
[40:14] we're once his enemy but he reconciled
[40:16] us holy just like name it was the enemy
[40:19] of Israel holy but he received healing
[40:22] there are many lepers in a man's day he
[40:24] wasn't the only leper in the place there
[40:26] pletely in Jerusalem plenty in the
[40:28] promised land but God's God healed
[40:30] another one he bypassed all the likely
[40:33] candidates and went to another one who
[40:35] was an enemy hallelujah that's the same
[40:37] thing with you and I I mean we're once
[40:40] his enemy God my possible to choose to
[40:42] get you right God by bus multitudes to
[40:45] find you hallelujah that's why we should
[40:47] rejoice Lord you Piper I don't know why
[40:50] you bypass them but I say thank you you
[40:52] found me that's the main thing people
[40:54] say well it's not fair there'll be a few
[40:56] I'm glad I'm one of the few hallelujah
[40:59] I'm glad I'm one of them that's like
[41:00] brother Chris said last few years ago
[41:02] it's like imagine this three monkeys
[41:04] going up the ramp and I was like and you
[41:06] the third monkey right you don't want to
[41:09] sit back and say well I guess I won't
[41:10] make it no one of those monkeys has to
[41:13] go hallelujah if there's - boy monkeys
[41:16] that boy that other boy monkeys off I'm
[41:18] in hallelujah you know to me you got a
[41:22] you know you just got to be glad and
[41:24] once you're in you're in oh yeah the
[41:29] fight the kingdom came to God the
[41:31] violent take it by force what away

[41:40] Black Friday or you know some special
[41:42] sale they're queued up before the doors

[44:18] days come saith the Lord God that I'll
[44:20] send a famine in the land not a famine
[44:22] of bread nor thirst of water
[44:25] but of the hearing of the words of the
[44:28] Lord it's a notice it doesn't say a
[44:33] famine for Bibles or man's opinion or
[44:37] commentaries or systematic theology none
[44:41] of those things it's hearing the words
[44:43] of the Lord so God's divine revelation

[46:07] not just a potato the word is the whole
[46:13] thing as I said you're a few months ago
[46:16] I said imagine if you have a banquet and
[46:19] the person walks in and they're just on
[46:21] their phone and the corn are not
[46:22] interested they say what is wrong with
[46:24] that person but the person that comes in

[46:48] with the word this should excite you the
[46:51] word should excite you you know we were
[46:53] reading I've got it in the here but we
[46:57] were reading where Jesus has taken Jesus
[47:00] has taken us as and look to Jesus has
[47:02] taken to the temple no he's he's eight
[47:06] days all these circumcised they're going
[47:07] to give the offering of the of the
[47:10] pigeons for him and then there's some
[47:12] people in there there's two in the tip

[47:35] hallelujah
[47:37] you know then the Bible this is hardly
[47:40] this is for free now in the Bible I hope
[47:42] the word hope in the Bible actually is
[47:45] an expectation it's not a hope like I
[47:48] trust none of you do and you shouldn't
[47:50] but people that buy a lot of tickets
[47:52] they hope they'll win the lotto there's
[47:54] not an expectation is just a hope it's
[47:56] just a stab in the dark but in the Bible
[47:58] of hope is an expectation and I was
[48:01] thinking Christ in you the hope of glory
[48:03] or Christ in you the expectation of
[48:06] glory hallelujah
[48:07] expectation I've been put under
[48:09] expectation hallelujah I'm gonna walk on

[49:10] of the poor because not everyone could
[49:11] present a land and have enough money to

[56:05] the widow woman a Gentile bypasses all
[56:08] the other widows in Israel goes to a
[56:10] Gentile and they survive the famine
[56:13] hallelujah and this word maybe the
[56:15] Prophet represents the word Amen she
[56:19] wasn't looking for him
[56:20] he just was seen her way and brother
[56:23] Brahim says about that widow woman she
[56:25] was the same caliber as the Prophet the
[56:27] same kind of callable person right and
[56:30] it's the same thing we said well what's
[56:32] that got to do with you the wordless
[56:34] Jesus has come to you right the
[56:37] bridegroom has come to you he's made
[56:39] himself real to you right
[56:40] has he not he's made himself known to
[56:43] you and he's come to you because you are
[56:45] the same kind of caliber as he is

[56:50] Corinthians 11:1 our preacher says the
[56:53] the woman is the glory of the man
[56:55] hallelujah

[56:58] 11 the woman is the glory of the man

[57:04] washed us he transformed us he says look
[57:08] at my glory earlier we know that you
[57:11] downtrodden a bunch of people he lifts
[57:13] up his bride look at my glory Satan

[57:36] no God doesn't share us with nobody
[57:38] right he doesn't share his bride with
[57:40] any demon spirit he doesn't share us
[57:42] with any devices of the world
[57:44] she belongs we belong to him he's
[57:47] jealous over his bride he is absolutely
[57:50] jealous over you hallelujah he's not
[57:52] haphazard nonchalant whatever you want
[57:55] to call it he's very jealous over you I
[57:57] mean he's cause nation's to fall nations
[58:00] to rise technology to be made that you
[58:03] had be reached hallelujah he literally
[58:07] has moved earth for his bride to come to
[58:10] their position he said oh I don't know
[58:13] if that's so look at Israel because the
[58:21] world to go to war for them to be in the
[58:24] homeland again he calls that nation to
[58:27] be birthed a certain way that they'll
[58:29] stand alone when the crunch comes they
[58:32] will stand alone and it should be the
[58:34] same thing with us we've been birthed
[58:35] out of the world Great Tribulation came
[58:38] upon our lives and something innocence
[58:40] is going to be a place for us there's
[58:42] going to be a homeland and our homeland
[58:44] is the Word of God let's come open holy
[58:47] and something brought us back to the
[58:48] homeland and now we say this is our
[58:50] identity this is where we belong and
[58:52] we've got to remember now we came out
[58:54] with great affliction we're not going to
[58:56] give this up we're not going to give our
[58:58] homeland up we will stand on the word it
[59:00] is our heritage when are given up for
[59:02] nothing hallelujah and they're active I
[59:06] got sent a video a while ago there are
[59:10] some Jews in Israel and they have their
[59:11] own fields and they grow there and wait
[59:13] for the kosher but it happened that
[59:16] because you know every seventh year they
[59:17] leave their fields fellow they don't
[59:20] cultivate it all according to the law so
[59:22] all their fields were fellow so they
[59:24] were looking for other wheat that was
[59:26] raised the same way they they raised it
[59:28] they found a field on the Gaza Israel
[59:31] border and so they and so they bought
[59:35] the region they harvested it the next
[59:38] day or a couple of days after that
[59:40] terrorists from from Gaza came up out of
[59:43] tunnels in those fields and in 90
[59:47] seconds there was air strikes and they
[59:49] were wiped out now
[59:51] they tunneled into that wheat field
[59:53] because they saw there's wheat we can
[59:55] come up and we can crawl into it
[59:58] get into the population therein wreak
[59:59] havoc but those Jews harvested the wheat
[1:00:02] so when they came out of the field I
[1:00:03] mean into the fields just to be a patch
[1:00:05] but the Israeli defense is so active 90
[1:00:09] seconds is an air strike they have they
[1:00:12] have active defense watching their
[1:00:15] borders they're not just asleep waiting
[1:00:17] for things to they're actively they have
[1:00:19] they had a blimp up in the air with
[1:00:21] cameras and everything people on the
[1:00:23] ground as soon as they came out there
[1:00:25] was an alert was sent and off they were
[1:00:27] gone we should be the same way we should
[1:00:32] be active and our defense partly we're
[1:00:34] not going to retreat and then gain we're
[1:00:36] just going to hold the whole land every
[1:00:38] promise belongs to us I mean if the
[1:00:40] devil robs you of your joy take your
[1:00:42] back and actively defend it Lord you're
[1:00:44] my peace you're my joy you're my comfort

[1:00:48] surrender any of that hallelujah he
[1:00:52] should here's our joy he is our peace

[1:00:58] on him no matter what goes on hallelujah
[1:01:02] but they won't give up their land we are
[1:01:05] not giving up this word should be
[1:01:07] something in you Lord I'm gonna stand on

[1:11:32] out the shame of his family right of his
[1:11:35] natural birth are you following me
[1:11:37] he couldn't wipe it out it took the king
[1:11:39] to invite him to the table that now the
[1:11:44] king would wipe out his shame
[1:11:46] the king would exterminate a shape
[1:11:47] because he say any says to him all the
[1:11:50] lands of your father will be restored to

[1:12:46] control of all things that we are living
[1:12:48] we are having a feast he's invited you
[1:12:51] to his table and something in you said
[1:12:53] yes I don't have an excuse brother Brown
[1:12:57] teaches on the parable of the of the
[1:12:59] wedding feast invitation and and the
[1:13:03] invitation goes out the first two times
[1:13:04] and they both turn it down so he has
[1:13:08] gone to the highways the byways get the
[1:13:11] good and the bad
[1:13:12] just get them my table
[1:13:14] is going to be full and brother M says
[1:13:17] are the Pentecostals they turned down
[1:13:18] the spiritual feast they turned down the

[1:14:36] was listening to the message he listened
[1:14:39] to that word he listened to that word
[1:14:42] this transforming power in that word and
[1:14:44] the reason I can say this because I've
[1:14:45] experienced it myself

[1:14:52] way and then it's something in you says
[1:14:55] well I'm going then you come to the door
[1:14:59] you give yourself your washed your feet

[1:15:06] God knows how to wash you know God knows
[1:15:10] how to wash he he he does a thorough job
[1:15:13] washes you doesn't matter where you
[1:15:15] walked on this world you get washed of
[1:15:18] it he washes your feet puts on a new
[1:15:21] robe doesn't matter what state you come
[1:15:22] in you come as the poorest man on the
[1:15:25] earth or the richest man after you go
[1:15:27] through the door you're free
[1:15:28] whosh you've given a new rope they all

[1:15:32] Oh glory hallelujah and then you kissed
[1:15:36] welcome then you're in hallelujah amen
[1:15:40] and he we are having a feast so I
[1:15:44] wouldn't worry about what other people
[1:15:46] say see you can only really talk about
[1:15:48] from where your experiences right you
[1:15:52] can only go from me where your
[1:15:53] experiences david's mighty men nearly is
[1:15:56] coming into power that was their
[1:15:58] experience their experience a man in
[1:16:01] seoul's army said this go hunt down this
[1:16:03] renegade that was his experience that's
[1:16:06] all they could talk from you know but it
[1:16:08] depends where you where your experiences
[1:16:10] the disciples said to whom shall we go
[1:16:12] they have the words of eternal life that
[1:16:14] was their experience the others didn't
[1:16:16] have that same kind of experience so
[1:16:18] they left what about you who do you say
[1:16:21] this is he says jesus jesus christ the
[1:16:25] word or is it something else
[1:16:26] hallelujah who do you say that my
[1:16:29] experience is it it's this made flesh
[1:16:32] right this message is this Bible right
[1:16:37] the message is the Bible that's why he
[1:16:39] takes scriptures and just expands it up
[1:16:42] even sometimes they seem to be obscure
[1:16:45] and it becomes so plain and it runs all
[1:16:47] the way through the scripture you say
[1:16:49] how did I not see that hallelujah he
[1:16:51] shows you where you are
[1:16:53] amen naman I'll just finish with naman
[1:16:56] real quick there are a lot of lepers in
[1:16:58] Israel it was an enemy of enemy of the
[1:17:01] Jews he had leprosy he heard of a
[1:17:04] prophet in Israel he goes there and then
[1:17:07] the Prophet sends out a servant tell the
[1:17:11] dip in the Jordan seven times and he
[1:17:14] gets angry there will be two rivers by
[1:17:17] my church my denomination was a lot more
[1:17:19] nicer than this one or this church this
[1:17:22] river Jordans this muddy little thing
[1:17:24] nothing special about it
[1:17:26] the river through Damascus US or
[1:17:28] wherever the Euphrates whatever is in
[1:17:30] Syria far better River but gods in that
[1:17:33] place go dip seven times in that place
[1:17:36] and he'd humbled himself and there's
[1:17:39] something in the Bride of Christ they
[1:17:40] can handle themselves to the word
[1:17:42] they can't they may say well I don't
[1:17:44] know how this works for something em
[1:17:45] this is you should do it hallelujah and
[1:17:48] then naman servant was wise enough to
[1:17:50] say think about it again because the
[1:17:53] wood does offend people right but they
[1:17:55] should I pray this something in you that
[1:17:56] says think about it again think about
[1:18:00] what he said if he said something hard
[1:18:01] wouldn't you do it and they even had
[1:18:04] enough scenes to say yeah that's true
[1:18:06] and then he wanders down to the Jordan
[1:18:09] whatever state it's in it's not a pretty
[1:18:12] thing you go google it it's not a it's
[1:18:14] not a big majestic mighty whatever river
[1:18:17] and he dips in first time nothing second
[1:18:21] time nothing third time and probably by
[1:18:24] the fifth time he's thinking is this
[1:18:25] ever he's probably trying to keep count
[1:18:27] and it maybe comes out one more time the
[1:18:30] servant says he goes in he comes out
[1:18:33] he's not a letter anymore Allu yeah and
[1:18:37] it's the same thing with us the wood
[1:18:39] washes us we come out and we see oh my
[1:18:44] the thing that brought me here I'm not
[1:18:46] carrying any more lujah the sin of this
[1:18:49] world the sin nature I was carrying
[1:18:51] right I'm not packing it no more it got
[1:18:54] washed there ago we buried Satan
[1:18:57] hallelujah glory to God don't forget
[1:19:01] that amen
[1:19:03] and Jesus ties those two accounts and
[1:19:07] with the state of Scriptures fulfilled
[1:19:09] because he's saying no and brother and
[1:19:12] preaches him and this day the Scriptures
[1:19:14] fulfilled and he's not just picking
[1:19:16] something out of the year and all this
[1:19:17] will excite people it's actually God
[1:19:19] moving his prophet saying this is this
[1:19:21] has just happened and he was there and
[1:19:24] he was trying to preach birth pains and
[1:19:26] he got a new Bible and the two pages he
[1:19:29] was trying to read was stuck together
[1:19:30] you can hear it on the hear it on the
[1:19:32] tape and he didn't realize he attacked
[1:19:35] either because the number of verses were
[1:19:36] perfectly in line like it's actually
[1:19:38] properly printed and then a bishop
[1:19:41] bishop Stanley comes with his Bible he
[1:19:43] hear him on tape he says be steady son
[1:19:45] you can hear him and he reads out of his
[1:19:48] Bible and he takes the Bible and goes
[1:19:50] back and brother and preaches birth
[1:19:53] pains then afterwards he's looking at
[1:19:56] Bible and he realizes the two pages are
[1:19:58] stuck together and then God's dealing
[1:20:01] with him saying and takes them and to
[1:20:03] look for saying and Jesus stood up to
[1:20:07] read and God allowed all that to happen
[1:20:10] because God is wanting you to know that
[1:20:14] we are in his second coming it's not a
[1:20:17] haphazard thing misprinted Bible all
[1:20:19] things had to happen for that to be that
[1:20:22] way and God's causing it to happen that
[1:20:24] you would know behold I send you Elijah
[1:20:28] the Prophet to turn your heart back to
[1:20:31] the original faith to turn your heart
[1:20:33] from creeds and fables of man true the
[1:20:36] Living God to walk with the living Jesus
[1:20:39] Christ hallelujah hasn't he done that
[1:20:42] isn't it wonderful that you're in the
[1:20:45] scripture you didn't even know
[1:20:47] hallelujah and you can and people say
[1:20:50] well that didn't happen you say I'm
[1:20:51] sorry it happened my heart got turned
[1:20:55] hallelujah he's in me Elijah his words
[1:20:57] were recorded on a tape and it spoke to
[1:21:00] me differently to any other voice I've
[1:21:01] ever heard and something in me turned
[1:21:04] hallelujah and in me it doesn't want to
[1:21:07] turn back I mean because when it turned
[1:21:09] something in me said this is you this is
[1:21:12] what you mean to be hallelujah glory to
[1:21:15] God sorry what we should really do I
[1:21:19] think I haven't said this in a while
[1:21:22] maybe I'm wrong it's like laughing all
[1:21:25] the way to the bank who's heard that
[1:21:26] expression you're just laughing all the
[1:21:28] way in the bank tellers aren't laughing
[1:21:31] and you laugh all the way out it's like
[1:21:34] us you mean jesus paid it all we are
[1:21:38] saved by grace through faith and it's
[1:21:41] more than a nice scripture on Instagram
[1:21:43] but it's a reality His grace has brought
[1:21:46] me safe thus far his grace
[1:21:48] taught my heart to fear and then his
[1:21:51] grace my fears relieved when I realized
[1:21:54] that I was fearful because I realized I
[1:21:56] was lost but then his grace moved upon I
[1:21:59] realize he paid it all and I accepted
[1:22:01] his pardon you mean really yes really
[1:22:03] you mean that you have no fear of death
[1:22:06] I don't feed it Jesus should I
[1:22:09] through that door I've won waiting for
[1:22:11] me Allu you so doesn't matter what
[1:22:14] happens to this thing I have one waiting
[1:22:16] for me and he promised the same God that
[1:22:19] is present the same God that moves in
[1:22:22] your soul right is the same God that
[1:22:25] will take you through that door should
[1:22:26] you go through that door and you won't
[1:22:29] fall you'll just go up you'll find
[1:22:31] yourself on a green grassy place
[1:22:33] should you be waiting for the rapture
[1:22:34] and you'll meet all the saints that have
[1:22:36] gone on and you'll be having a rejoicing
[1:22:38] time and the word sublime doesn't even
[1:22:41] touch it the prophet said hallelujah
[1:22:45] isn't that right we are going to a real
[1:22:49] place Jesus is here to take us to that
[1:22:53] place I go to prepare a place for you
[1:22:55] and if I go I shall come again and
[1:22:58] receive you unto myself this isn't the
[1:23:01] Gospel of John the 14th chapter right I
[1:23:04] got to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:23:06] do I'll come again and receive you to
[1:23:08] myself who's been received as he
[1:23:12] received you as he really really
[1:23:14] received your faith and given you his
[1:23:15] Holy Spirit hallelujah that means you've
[1:23:18] been received yeah I'm hallelujah just
[1:23:20] like the man with the prodigal son the
[1:23:23] son comes back is embraced by the father
[1:23:25] hallelujah he's come back home
[1:23:27] everything's fine
[1:23:30] there where I am oh where you are but
[1:23:32] where I am you shall be also hallelujah
[1:23:35] this message is Jesus Christ the word
[1:23:38] and it has come to receive and you
[1:23:42] clayed and if he's received you he will
[1:23:45] take you to where he is God where you
[1:23:48] are that's why our minds our house you
[1:23:50] be fixed on Lord you have come to carry
[1:23:52] me away
[1:23:54] hallelujah it's more than a it's more
[1:23:56] than a story the Bible is more than a
[1:23:59] story it's a reality holy the Holy Ghost
[1:24:02] we talk about is a reality right
[1:24:05] salvation is a reality redemptions a
[1:24:07] reality but you're just gonna give
[1:24:08] yourself to him you can't just hold back
[1:24:11] and say well another day that's the
[1:24:12] devil's life another day another day no

[1:24:30] for a way back I don't want her way back
[1:24:33] I don't want some nice kind of life I
[1:24:35] want to walk with him right because when
[1:24:39] it's all said and done hallelujah
[1:24:41] we'll say Lord you said well why do you
[1:24:44] want to walk with him because I want to
[1:24:45] give him something to place at his feet
[1:24:48] and what we place at his feet is the
[1:24:50] victories he's won in our lives it's
[1:24:53] nothing we do right it's healing healing
[1:24:55] nothing we do it's what he has done

[1:25:02] we do it's what he has done deliverance
[1:25:04] is nothing we do it's what he has done
[1:25:06] walking with Him there's nothing we do
[1:25:08] it's what he has done right isn't that
[1:25:11] right so I want something Lord you gave
[1:25:14] me these victories in life not because
[1:25:16] of me but because of you so I want to
