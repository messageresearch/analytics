[53:49] with a great slaughter at gibeon and
[53:51] chased them along the way that goth up

[54:11] unto ezra and they died and
[54:13] there were more that which died with the
[54:15] hailstones then they whom the children

[54:42] midst of heaven and hated not to go down
[54:44] about a whole day
[54:46] and there was no day like it like that
[54:49] before it or after it that the lord
[54:51] hearken unto the voice of a man for the
[54:53] lord fought for israel
[54:56] he said how did that work i know but god
[54:57] did it okay i just believe it happened
[54:59] amen so we're gonna go to second kings
[55:02] and and seven
[55:04] i read from verse one so i'm
[55:11] trying to sort myself out here what have
[55:12] i done
[55:16] okay second kings and chapter seven
[55:19] we'll read verse one down to verse five
[55:25] it says here then elisha
[55:28] said hear the word of the lord thus
[55:30] saith the lord tomorrow about this time
[55:32] shall a measure of fine oil a fine flour
[55:34] sorry be sold for a shekel and two
[55:36] measures of valley for a shekel in the
[55:38] gate of samaria
[55:39] then a lord in whose hand the king
[55:41] leaned answered the man of god and said
[55:43] behold if the lord would make windows in
[55:45] heaven
[55:46] might this thing be
[55:48] and he said behold there shall thou
[55:50] shall see it with thine eyes
[55:52] pardon me
[55:53] but shall not eat thereof and there were
[55:56] four leprous men at the entering end of
[55:58] the gate and they said to one another
[55:59] why sit we here until we die
[56:03] if we say we will enter into the city
[56:05] then the famine is in the city and we
[56:07] shall die there and if we sit still here
[56:10] we die also now therefore come let us
[56:13] fall into the host of the syrians if
[56:15] they save us alive we shall live if they
[56:18] kill us
[56:19] we shall but die
[56:21] and they rose up in the twilight to go
[56:23] into the camp of the sirians and when
[56:25] they came to the uttermost part of the
[56:26] camp of syria behold
[56:28] there was no man there
[56:31] amen hallelujah let's just bow our heads

[57:50] your way once again in jesus christ's
[57:52] name amen amen god bless you friends you
[57:55] may have your seats this morning um i'd
[57:58] like to
[58:00] uh just talk go go into this a little
[58:03] bit about how you know we shouldn't let
[58:04] the enemy just linger we should get rid
[58:06] of him
[58:07] we should kick him out so
[58:08] here we are uh here we um we we read
[58:12] this uh account here and second kings
[58:14] will come back to joshua some other time
[58:15] in the in the service uh hopefully but
[58:19] you know here here are these leprous men
[58:22] here they're sitting by the gate we know
[58:23] you know if you read the whole account
[58:24] we didn't read it to save time but you
[58:26] know um samaria is besieged by the
[58:28] syrians and and there's a great famine
[58:30] in the city there's um you know that you
[58:32] know it even came to such a desperate
[58:34] point that they that they would be uh
[58:36] killing each other's children eating
[58:37] them just to survive and a head of a
[58:39] donkey cost some astronomical amount and
[58:41] a piece of pigeon dung was a crazy
[58:44] amount of money just your people trying
[58:45] to survive and but but there came a
[58:47] prophecy from elijah saying that this
[58:50] time tomorrow everything's going to be
[58:51] restored
[58:52] you know you know everything's going to
[58:53] be restored so when i talk about a
[58:55] restoration here i'm not talking about a
[58:57] a restoration of an economy because
[59:00] economies come they go they up they're
[59:02] down left and right but talk about the
[59:03] restoration of a people this is more
[59:05] important right so
[59:07] um
[59:08] here they are um sitting here and and
[59:10] you can see obviously they did not hear
[59:12] this prophecy because if they did they
[59:15] just would have said let's just wait
[59:16] till tomorrow we're going to get food
[59:18] things are going to be restored but they
[59:19] said well you know why do we sit here
[59:21] and die so why do we sit here in this
[59:23] state let's do something about it
[59:25] and so they would so they
[59:27] they made up their minds that sitting
[59:29] still wasn't the answer but they had to
[59:32] change where they were in order for
[59:34] things to change so they they decided
[59:37] let's go to the camp of the sirians
[59:39] remember the syrians were the enemy but
[59:41] they they just made up their minds well
[59:43] you know if we live we live if we die we
[59:45] die but we're going to die here anyway
[59:46] so let's do something about it so
[59:48] you know they
[59:50] you know and and what i love about it is
[59:52] that we are in a far better state than
[59:54] those lepers
[59:56] because they didn't know how they would
[59:58] be received there
[1:00:00] they could get killed they could live
[1:00:01] they don't know but you know we're not
[1:00:03] we're not invited to go to the camp of
[1:00:05] the enemy this morning but we're invited
[1:00:07] to go into the camp or the house of the
[1:00:10] father which is the presence of god
[1:00:11] himself now brother brown would say this
[1:00:14] in the message who is this melchizedek
[1:00:16] and we know melchizedek is jesus christ
[1:00:18] but he would he would come down to the
[1:00:20] end of the service and he would call out
[1:00:22] a a lady dying with cancer on a cot
[1:00:25] and he would say to her now one time
[1:00:28] there were three lepers at the gate of
[1:00:30] samaria and then lepers said why do we
[1:00:32] sit here till we die because of all the
[1:00:34] sickness starving to death eating one
[1:00:36] another's children they said if we go
[1:00:38] down to the enemies camp the sirians if
[1:00:40] they kill us we're going to die anyhow
[1:00:42] if they save us we'll live and they took
[1:00:44] that chance and
[1:00:46] and by that faith they not only saved
[1:00:48] their selves but the whole group
[1:00:51] now you're going to die if you lay there
[1:00:53] but if you're not asked but you're not
[1:00:55] asked to go to the camp of the enemy
[1:00:57] you're invited to the house of the
[1:01:00] father
[1:01:01] now you're dying with cancer you can't
[1:01:02] live outside of god you're not from the
[1:01:04] city you're not from around here you're
[1:01:06] you've come a long way you're from
[1:01:08] milwaukee that's true that's right i've
[1:01:10] seen the city i know it that's right do
[1:01:12] you believe will you accept god now as
[1:01:14] your healer if you will no matter how
[1:01:17] weak you are how big fast you are i
[1:01:19] believe in your case i would rise up in
[1:01:21] the name of jesus christ take that cod
[1:01:24] and go home and live to the glory of god
[1:01:26] he says will you obey me as god's
[1:01:28] prophet then rise up and go be well
[1:01:30] don't be scared get up off of that cot
[1:01:33] god will make you wealthy somebody hold
[1:01:35] her so she can get up and get strength
[1:01:37] do you believe god just let her get a
[1:01:39] little strength she'll be all right
[1:01:41] that's it sister there there she is in
[1:01:43] the name of the lord jesus stand up and
[1:01:45] give praise to god he's the same
[1:01:47] yesterday today and forever and if you
[1:01:48] listen to that you can hear just such an
[1:01:50] awe come over the crowd because she got
[1:01:51] up i mean and she went on her way so she
[1:01:54] see you know she was invited to go to
[1:01:56] the house of the father into the
[1:01:57] presence of god because she was going to
[1:01:59] die in that state but she had to take
[1:02:01] that little face she had you know don't
[1:02:03] be scared we can't be scared of stepping
[1:02:05] into the unknown
[1:02:06] you know our god is here to meet every
[1:02:08] need to to transform our lives but we're
[1:02:10] going to cast aside the fear of the
[1:02:12] unknown and step by faith into his
[1:02:14] presence so you know these lepers as i
[1:02:17] said we are in a far better condition
[1:02:19] than these lepers
[1:02:20] because they were there
[1:02:22] they they they didn't know how they
[1:02:24] would receive be would be received
[1:02:27] but we are living in a time where we
[1:02:30] have been shown by many infallible
[1:02:32] proofs that jesus christ is the same
[1:02:33] yesterday today and forever amen that he
[1:02:35] says that all that come to me i'll know
[1:02:37] why is cast out so if we go beyond where
[1:02:39] we are into his presence to get what we
[1:02:42] need amen we will be received
[1:02:44] i believe it
[1:02:46] hallelujah now in his presence is where
[1:02:48] healing abides
[1:02:50] it's where there is faith for all things
[1:02:52] amen those lepers just thought let's try
[1:02:54] and get some food from the syrians they
[1:02:56] might feed us or they'll kill us
[1:02:58] yet
[1:02:59] so yes they were going just on hope
[1:03:02] but they knew that they would get a
[1:03:03] clear cut
[1:03:05] and potentially they would get cut
[1:03:07] decision
[1:03:08] because they get cut they get killed
[1:03:10] but they they want to clear cut answer
[1:03:13] right either we'll get fed or we'll die
[1:03:15] but they want they didn't just want to
[1:03:16] linger and wonder what would happen one
[1:03:18] of the potential of going to the enemy's
[1:03:19] camp they decided we're going
[1:03:21] we're going to go and
[1:03:23] see unfortunately that's very different
[1:03:26] from many christians or people who
[1:03:28] instead of settling in their hearts that
[1:03:30] they're going to go and get an answer
[1:03:32] from god and really get an answer
[1:03:34] that
[1:03:36] then what happens is they start off
[1:03:37] half-heartedly and the first thing a
[1:03:39] problem comes up and they quit and they
[1:03:41] say the promise doesn't work
[1:03:43] i say i'm i'm standing here this morning
[1:03:45] saying every promise of god is true it's
[1:03:47] for the believer it's available by the
[1:03:49] blood of jesus christ i mean he's opened
[1:03:51] a way that we can receive every divine
[1:03:54] promise of god i mean it can be in our
[1:03:56] possession this morning
[1:03:58] you know to me it's like if the lepers
[1:04:00] what if they just went halfway to the
[1:04:02] syrian camp maybe they stubbed their
[1:04:04] toes they got tired they got discouraged
[1:04:07] and they stopped there or they just
[1:04:08] turned around
[1:04:10] you know imagine if it's it was like
[1:04:12] this just to dramatize you know that
[1:04:13] there was another guy sitting by the
[1:04:15] gate he decided not to go and these
[1:04:17] lepers went and then he saw them coming
[1:04:19] back and they just looked
[1:04:21] discouraged
[1:04:22] and he said you know what happened when
[1:04:24] you got there you know did you you know
[1:04:26] did you get any food have you some you
[1:04:28] know do you have some left over they'd
[1:04:30] say no
[1:04:32] you know it didn't work we got tired and
[1:04:34] we turned around there was nothing to
[1:04:35] get there
[1:04:36] and it and then maybe he'd ask why is
[1:04:38] that
[1:04:39] did you turn around with nothing no if
[1:04:41] they were truthful
[1:04:43] they you know did you get nothing no if
[1:04:44] they were truthful they just say
[1:04:45] actually the journey got too rough and
[1:04:47] we quit before we got there we don't
[1:04:49] want to be in that kind of condition
[1:04:50] with the promises of god
[1:04:52] where just because it doesn't work then
[1:04:54] it's not true it is true amen
[1:04:57] you know
[1:04:58] that's the way it is if people are
[1:05:00] seeking an answer from god about
[1:05:01] something and they say the promise isn't
[1:05:03] true is what happens is they've started
[1:05:05] the journey but they don't arrive into
[1:05:07] his presence
[1:05:09] see the reason that they don't arrive
[1:05:10] into his presence is because they don't
[1:05:12] go with the whole heart seeking god
[1:05:15] they are either a bit indifferent or
[1:05:16] they have their mind made up already is
[1:05:18] how god will answer their prayer
[1:05:20] i mean the thing is i'm not worried
[1:05:22] about how god will answer me i just want
[1:05:24] an answer
[1:05:25] hallelujah you know i haven't got my
[1:05:27] answer made up before i pray then i pray
[1:05:29] expecting this answer no however is that
[1:05:32] and no is as good as a yes and you know
[1:05:34] he answers many different ways as long
[1:05:35] as he answers i'm happy
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] jeremiah would say that when they call
[1:05:41] upon me i shall go on uh and ye shall go
[1:05:44] and pray unto me i will hearken unto you
[1:05:46] and you shall seek me and find me when
[1:05:49] you shall search me with all your heart
[1:05:51] i mean to have a promise in the
[1:05:53] scripture if you seek after him you
[1:05:54] shall find him if you seek with all your
[1:05:56] heart
[1:05:57] hallelujah he says in hebrews 11 and 6
[1:05:59] but without faith is impossible to
[1:06:01] please him for he that cometh a god must
[1:06:03] believe that he is and he is a rewarder
[1:06:06] of them that diligently seek him
[1:06:09] see the lepers were in this kind of
[1:06:10] condition they wanted an answer
[1:06:13] they weren't just willing to go half the
[1:06:14] way and say well this is not just going
[1:06:16] to work i'm going to quit other you know
[1:06:18] there was nothing there for us now they
[1:06:19] went all the way to the syrian camp
[1:06:22] and they found it empty and they fed
[1:06:23] themselves and you know then they went
[1:06:25] and told the whole city they delivered
[1:06:26] the whole place
[1:06:27] because there's a prophet prophecy of a
[1:06:30] restoration see something has to
[1:06:33] happen when you seek the lord with all
[1:06:35] your heart something has to happen i
[1:06:36] believe something's got to change you
[1:06:38] know you have to arrive
[1:06:40] you don't just oh there's a journey and
[1:06:42] i'm no no it's not about the journey
[1:06:43] it's about the destination
[1:06:45] and many times that destination it takes
[1:06:47] you just for you go from standing up to
[1:06:48] on your knees and then be in prayer
[1:06:51] amen but you have to arrive if you've
[1:06:52] made up your mind lord i'm gonna go
[1:06:54] anyway
[1:06:56] even if you think well he might not
[1:06:57] answer i'm going
[1:06:58] i'm going into this camp i'm going into
[1:07:00] his presence i'm gonna i'm gonna get a
[1:07:02] hold of his garment by faith i want an
[1:07:04] answer i'm not just a wishy-washy well
[1:07:06] maybe it'll work no it'll work
[1:07:09] amen you have to arrive if you go with
[1:07:11] all your heart you're determined lord i
[1:07:13] want to i want an answer from you i
[1:07:15] believe you will
[1:07:16] get an answer
[1:07:18] hallelujah you know i remember the first
[1:07:20] birthday present that christian ever
[1:07:22] gave me was a ride in an ambulance
[1:07:27] we just got back from our honeymoon in
[1:07:28] papua new guinea we had a tremendous
[1:07:30] time there uh we were with the half time
[1:07:32] we had a honeymoon half time we're doing
[1:07:34] a mission trip there with the believers
[1:07:36] in the village here that eventually they
[1:07:38] came into the message they um
[1:07:40] but you know to me it was amazing
[1:07:42] because christine just got and got in
[1:07:44] the kitchen you know helped out did
[1:07:45] everything and you know they would say
[1:07:47] so so they are the people of tolai it's
[1:07:49] their tribe and that's like she's a real
[1:07:51] tolaimiri you know a real terlai woman
[1:07:53] as a but to me it was the life of christ
[1:07:55] on display
[1:07:57] and um they they were really trying to
[1:07:59] fatten us up you know
[1:08:01] they said good you're putting on weight
[1:08:02] and it's you know um 60 years ago that'd
[1:08:05] be a bit scary because that was cannibal
[1:08:06] country even in about world war ii era
[1:08:09] they were still doing that kind of thing
[1:08:10] but we're still here with all our limbs
[1:08:12] and we still can't attend but you know
[1:08:14] but they love to feed us and you know
[1:08:16] but
[1:08:17] anyway
[1:08:19] we had a great time
[1:08:20] but what happened is when we came back
[1:08:22] and we don't know what it was the cause
[1:08:23] but she she started having seizures
[1:08:26] and uh she'd be unresponsive so she had
[1:08:29] normal strong healthy then then but then
[1:08:31] after the trip she started having these
[1:08:32] seizures where she go unresponsive and i
[1:08:34] think it was her left or right side
[1:08:36] would just start shaking and it should
[1:08:37] come out of it be normal and just go in
[1:08:38] and out of this so that's what caused
[1:08:40] the um that's what caused the ambulance
[1:08:42] ride on your birthday and uh but you
[1:08:45] know it was such a strange thing to
[1:08:46] watch your new bride growing like going
[1:08:48] through this
[1:08:49] and um
[1:08:52] yeah yeah i didn't know what was going
[1:08:53] on
[1:08:55] and so the doctors when when when she
[1:08:57] got taken into hospital they did all
[1:08:58] these different cognitive tests and
[1:08:59] tried to work out if it was a stroke or
[1:09:02] clots or whatever but but it no nothing
[1:09:04] fit the pattern and um
[1:09:07] of course now here i am i'm like the
[1:09:09] lepers by the gate
[1:09:11] i can't just sit here and watch this go
[1:09:13] seek
[1:09:14] i i appreciate medical science i work in
[1:09:17] the science field okay so i'm not
[1:09:18] anti-medicine praise the lord for
[1:09:19] medicine but you know god answers many
[1:09:22] different ways but but why do we have to
[1:09:23] just let the devil run his course why
[1:09:25] can't we just kick him out
[1:09:27] instead of putting up with something see
[1:09:28] we have a privilege and i'll get to it
[1:09:30] we have a privilege to enforce upon
[1:09:33] satan our rights
[1:09:35] where we have that privilege amen so you
[1:09:38] know and you know it was funny because
[1:09:39] the last thing that they tested her with
[1:09:42] i'm jumping back but you know she had an
[1:09:44] mri scan on her brain
[1:09:46] so medically medically only one of us
[1:09:48] has been proven to have a sound mind
[1:09:51] and it's not me
[1:09:53] but um anyway so so she having these
[1:09:55] seizures
[1:09:56] different things and you know so but i
[1:09:59] i knew i had to get an answer it wasn't
[1:10:02] enough just to
[1:10:03] thank the lord for the doctors but it
[1:10:05] wasn't just enough to get a diagnosis
[1:10:06] then get a treatment no no god's a
[1:10:08] healer
[1:10:09] we've seen him heal too much before this
[1:10:11] so why just put up with the devil's
[1:10:13] nonsense i mean so but i knew i had to
[1:10:16] get an answer now the scripture yeah and
[1:10:19] then even i thought to myself this could
[1:10:20] be a long trial but why does it have to
[1:10:22] be we know god's in control of all
[1:10:24] things but why does it have to be a long
[1:10:26] trial why can't it end right now because
[1:10:28] remember the scripture says jesus said
[1:10:30] him that asketh receiveth him that
[1:10:33] seeketh findeth him that knocketh it
[1:10:36] shall be opened so knocketh is not just
[1:10:39] you know that's
[1:10:40] lord open the door
[1:10:42] open the door lord
[1:10:43] hymn that seeketh your you're diligently
[1:10:45] seeking
[1:10:46] and you know the lord gave us a promise
[1:10:48] that upon this rock the revelation of
[1:10:50] who jesus christ is i'll build my church
[1:10:52] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:10:54] and we know a gate stops an entrance i
[1:10:56] mean so there's got to be a i trust
[1:10:57] there's a bit of you know a bit of grit
[1:11:00] in you and i that if the devil puts a
[1:11:02] door in your way you're going to bash it
[1:11:04] down
[1:11:05] it may take a few rams but it's going to
[1:11:06] go it's going to burst open
[1:11:08] amen it's going to burst open in prayer
[1:11:10] so i think it was the second
[1:11:13] i think it was the second day i can't
[1:11:15] remember which day it was but anyway
[1:11:17] these seizures were getting closer
[1:11:18] together and worse
[1:11:20] so they get so i was getting worse but
[1:11:22] then there was one afternoon i was just
[1:11:23] in prayer i was like lord i gotta bust
[1:11:25] this door open i need an answer
[1:11:27] hallelujah and then i because why
[1:11:29] because there's a divine promise by his
[1:11:31] stripes we are healed
[1:11:33] it's not this wasn't what's the will
[1:11:35] what's your will for the situation god
[1:11:37] no he's already given in his word by his
[1:11:39] stripes my wife is healed
[1:11:42] hallelujah so you know i just was
[1:11:44] knocking in the door in prayer and
[1:11:45] desperation and i got through the door
[1:11:47] i don't know i can't describe the
[1:11:48] feeling but you know when you get that
[1:11:49] you know when you get an answer
[1:11:51] it's open go through it's there
[1:11:53] hallelujah it's not just that well i
[1:11:55] think i feel happy and i think no no you
[1:11:57] know there's something in your heart
[1:11:58] anchors you've got the answer
[1:12:01] i mean to the next i think it was the
[1:12:02] next day i came in um
[1:12:04] you know and then she began to describe
[1:12:05] how these seizures were going and you
[1:12:08] know they were getting worse and closer
[1:12:10] together and she said before uh it would
[1:12:13] come on her she said she felt like that
[1:12:15] feeling when you're like standing on the
[1:12:16] edge of a cliff you're about to be
[1:12:17] pushed or jumped and then a dark cloud
[1:12:19] will come upon her then it would happen
[1:12:21] and she could hear everything but she
[1:12:23] was totally unresponsive and then she
[1:12:25] said that that that dark cloud is going
[1:12:27] to come on me again it's coming on so he
[1:12:29] prayed and rebuked it and it left and
[1:12:31] that was the end of it
[1:12:33] hallelujah i think it was that day or
[1:12:35] the next day she was discharged
[1:12:38] hallelujah so why sit here if we sit
[1:12:41] here sir if i just sat there and said
[1:12:43] well i guess this is just how it's going
[1:12:44] to be no
[1:12:45] god god god interrupts the devil's plans
[1:12:48] he cancels the devil's plans the devil
[1:12:50] has one plan god has another i'd say
[1:12:52] lord i want to live according to your
[1:12:54] plan not according to the devil's plan
[1:12:57] hallelujah so
[1:12:58] yeah and i think i think she was
[1:13:00] actually waiting for the mri i think
[1:13:01] that was the last thing she had but yeah
[1:13:03] as i said medically proven sound brain
[1:13:05] this one is still a question mark anyway
[1:13:09] but he's the same god this morning
[1:13:11] he's the same god this morning
[1:13:13] amen it says in hebrews 4 and 16 let us
[1:13:16] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[1:13:18] grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[1:13:21] grace to help in the time of need so we
[1:13:24] can by the blood of jesus christ we can
[1:13:25] come boldly before his throne we don't
[1:13:28] have to be afraid we don't have to be
[1:13:29] timid about it because he has given us
[1:13:31] an entrance to press in and get an
[1:13:34] answer hallelujah
[1:13:36] amen so don't quit halfway
[1:13:40] be like the lepers and go all the way
[1:13:42] into the camp
[1:13:43] and find out that every promise in his
[1:13:45] word is true

[1:16:55] when he was standing upon the earth we
[1:16:56] know the greatest name you know god
[1:16:58] revealing himself is in the name of
[1:17:00] jesus christ he revealed himself as
[1:17:02] jehovah el shaddai adonai different
[1:17:05] names but when he came down to finally
[1:17:07] the greatest manifestation of of his
[1:17:09] being
[1:17:10] was he was called jesus christ which is
[1:17:12] jehovah's salvation is manifested so we
[1:17:15] know when he was upon earth i mean
[1:17:17] sickness couldn't stand before him
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:20] you know epileptic spirits couldn't
[1:17:22] stand before him
[1:17:23] amen the devil got into the sea of
[1:17:25] galilee one day when he was asleep on
[1:17:27] the boat and ten thousand devils swore
[1:17:29] they'd drown him they had him they
[1:17:30] thought in a weak spot i remember when
[1:17:32] the disciples finally woke him up
[1:17:35] he just stood up and said peace be still
[1:17:37] and the winds and waves obey him because
[1:17:38] he created the winds and the waves
[1:17:40] hallelujah amen legion who is full of
[1:17:43] thousands of devils amen those devils
[1:17:45] had to leave him i mean they had to bow
[1:17:47] to the name of jesus christ i mean
[1:17:49] lazarus that was four days in the tomb
[1:17:51] rotten already his body was decayed amen
[1:17:54] corruption had to know its master and
[1:17:56] death had to give i mean one back to
[1:17:58] life again because it had to bow to the
[1:18:00] name of jesus christ everything must
[1:18:02] give way to that name there is not one
[1:18:05] thing that can stop that name
[1:18:06] manifesting hallelujah even hell itself
[1:18:09] satan couldn't stop it amen hell
[1:18:11] couldn't keep him holy the tomb couldn't
[1:18:13] keep him they had to give way amen to
[1:18:16] the name of the lord jesus christ he
[1:18:18] says in philippians 2 9 whereof god
[1:18:21] hath also highly exalted him and given
[1:18:23] him a name which is above every name
[1:18:27] that at the name of jesus every knee
[1:18:28] shall bow of things in heaven and in
[1:18:31] earth and things under the earth and
[1:18:33] that every tongue should confess that
[1:18:34] jesus christ is lord to the glory of the
[1:18:36] father so his name is above all names
[1:18:40] hallelujah we've seen many things bowed
[1:18:42] of that name
[1:18:43] amen a prophet was told in this
[1:18:45] generation and and he was the one who
[1:18:46] brought it up because he because the
[1:18:48] angel told him that if you're sincere
[1:18:50] get the people to believe you nothing
[1:18:51] will stand before your prayers and he
[1:18:52] said not even cancer
[1:18:54] and the angel said not even cancer
[1:18:55] because the cancer was the major killer
[1:18:57] in the day still is but it was shown god
[1:18:59] was showing the power of the blood
[1:19:01] saying nothing can stand before the
[1:19:03] believer's prayer you take the biggest
[1:19:05] devil the biggest thing that people fear
[1:19:07] nothing will stand before it amen if
[1:19:09] there's the prayer of faith god will
[1:19:11] answer that prayer and everything must
[1:19:13] bow before that name we've seen sickness
[1:19:15] has to bow
[1:19:16] whatever that spirit was that sickness
[1:19:18] yeah when my wife was in hospital that
[1:19:20] had to bow that had to go in the name of
[1:19:22] jesus christ hallelujah you know you
[1:19:25] know fear is such a crippler

[1:20:09] when we're going so anyway we're driving
[1:20:11] to the hospital
[1:20:13] and so you know we pray as we're going
[1:20:15] and so we prayed against the dream and
[1:20:18] then uh but then christine said can i
[1:20:20] pray again and she prayed and she
[1:20:21] totally forgot about it
[1:20:23] but then it's still in the back of my
[1:20:24] mind
[1:20:26] so here we are
[1:20:27] you know and then everything's going
[1:20:29] fine but then but then um
[1:20:31] gabriella's shoulder got stuck
[1:20:34] as she was coming out so they pushed the
[1:20:36] emergency bell on every doctor and the
[1:20:38] nurse and everyone in the hospital
[1:20:40] turned up in the room and anyway the
[1:20:41] midwife turned the shoulder and you know
[1:20:44] she came out because i think it's within
[1:20:45] four minutes that a baby's got to get
[1:20:46] out and start breathing otherwise brain
[1:20:48] damage comes in thankfully it was well
[1:20:50] within that time she was out and her
[1:20:53] face was all blue you know and then and
[1:20:55] she wasn't even screaming or kicking
[1:20:56] when she came out she was blue totally
[1:20:59] blue and they put her down and so i'm
[1:21:01] praying you know because this dream is
[1:21:03] still the devil's saying i'm going to
[1:21:05] kill your child she's going to be born
[1:21:06] still
[1:21:07] i said no god don't let this happen
[1:21:11] and then so gabriella comes out her face
[1:21:13] is all bruised because of how she came
[1:21:15] out but then her whole body's blue and
[1:21:17] they put her down on the you know that
[1:21:19] table they have with the lamp and they
[1:21:20] inspect the bones and everything and
[1:21:22] then she starts breathing and and i
[1:21:24] watch it it's like pink spread through
[1:21:26] her body
[1:21:27] hallelujah
[1:21:29] and she was totally fine
[1:21:31] now i didn't realize at the time but
[1:21:33] christine told me afterwards that when
[1:21:34] she prayed again when we were in the
[1:21:35] cast she totally forgot about that dream
[1:21:38] hallelujah but why do we have to accept
[1:21:40] the devil gives you something
[1:21:43] he projects a future to you this is how
[1:21:45] it's going to be
[1:21:46] now do we sign for that and accept it
[1:21:49] see what if i said well i guess honey
[1:21:51] we've just got to accept it you know
[1:21:53] what no we don't have to what what if
[1:21:55] christine accepted that dream well i
[1:21:57] guess she's just going to be stillborn
[1:21:58] who said amen
[1:22:00] amen our god
[1:22:02] is here amen to undertake
[1:22:05] so we don't need to listen to what the
[1:22:06] devil will say
[1:22:08] amen but it depends what we yeah see if
[1:22:11] we sit he gives us something like that
[1:22:14] it's like the lep is sitting in the gate
[1:22:16] are we going to sit here and accept this
[1:22:17] we're going to die something bad no we
[1:22:19] might as well go to the camp we must
[1:22:21] leave where we are
[1:22:22] go to the presence of god
[1:22:24] and get our answer
[1:22:26] is everyone okay today
[1:22:28] right if i'm fine
[1:22:30] you know we don't we we serve a prayer
[1:22:33] answering god
[1:22:35] hallelujah so everything must bow to the
[1:22:37] name of jesus christ
[1:22:40] it would say in hebrews 1 1 god who at
[1:22:42] sundered times in diverse manners i mean
[1:22:45] spake in times past unto the fathers by
[1:22:47] the prophets hath in these last days
[1:22:49] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[1:22:51] appointed air of all things by whom also
[1:22:53] he made the worlds who being in the
[1:22:55] brightness of his glory in the express
[1:22:57] image of his person and upholding all
[1:22:59] things by the word of his power when he
[1:23:01] had by himself purged our sins and sat
[1:23:03] down at the right hand the majesty on
[1:23:05] high being made so much better than the
[1:23:07] angels as he hath made he hath by
[1:23:10] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:23:13] name
[1:23:14] than they
[1:23:15] for unto which of the angels said he at
[1:23:17] any time thou art my son
[1:23:21] thou art my son this day have i begotten
[1:23:23] thee and again i will be to them a
[1:23:24] father and he shall be to me a son and
[1:23:27] again when he bringeth in the uh he
[1:23:29] bringeth in the first begotten into the
[1:23:31] world he saith and let all angels of of
[1:23:34] god worship him and of the angels he
[1:23:36] saith who maketh his angels spirits and
[1:23:39] his ministers a flame of fire so the
[1:23:42] scripture says here that he is tamed
[1:23:44] obtained
[1:23:46] he hath by inheritance obtained a more
[1:23:48] excellent name than the angels see every
[1:23:51] angel must obey the name of the lord
[1:23:53] jesus christ even fired angels
[1:23:56] we know the devil was the anointed
[1:23:58] cherub that covereth but then he exalted
[1:24:00] himself in pride wanted to make a better
[1:24:02] kingdom there in heaven than you than
[1:24:04] michael and so he got fired
[1:24:07] and now he's a fallen angel and all the
[1:24:08] ones that believed his lies amen they
[1:24:11] were they were kicked out of heaven as
[1:24:12] well and now they've become demons right
[1:24:14] but they originally started as angels
[1:24:16] but now they have
[1:24:18] they have been cast out and now they're
[1:24:20] fighting against the people of god
[1:24:24] but our lord jesus has obtained a
[1:24:26] greater inheritance than them a more
[1:24:29] excellent name than them right so by the
[1:24:32] name of jesus christ they have to obey
[1:24:35] right this may be very elementary but i
[1:24:37] just want you to you know i trust it'll
[1:24:40] just strengthen our faith
[1:24:42] we don't have to put up with what the
[1:24:43] devil is doing
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:47] jesus would say after his resurrection
[1:24:48] that all powers get on given unto me in
[1:24:50] heaven and on earth
[1:24:52] and then he would he would give that
[1:24:54] power or give the authority of that
[1:24:56] power to his disciples
[1:24:58] and that same authority is now given to
[1:25:01] us it's like a police officer you can
[1:25:03] take the smallest person in the world
[1:25:06] but if they become a police officer they
[1:25:08] have all of the city's authority behind
[1:25:10] them you know in their own strength they
[1:25:12] couldn't stop a they couldn't stop a
[1:25:14] child you know they could certainly
[1:25:15] couldn't stop a big truck coming down
[1:25:17] the road but as soon as they got that
[1:25:18] badge on and they go out there and they
[1:25:20] hold up their hand it doesn't matter how
[1:25:22] many wheel how many ton are in that
[1:25:23] truck it's got to stop because the
[1:25:25] authority on that policeman you know
[1:25:28] friends we're more than policemen i mean
[1:25:30] we are the children of the most high god
[1:25:32] amen so it's not just the state behind
[1:25:34] us all of heaven amen is here to back up
[1:25:37] the believer
[1:25:39] hallelujah why because that authority
[1:25:41] amen has been given to us
[1:25:43] not to use it as we would in our own
[1:25:45] ability but be surrendered to god that
[1:25:47] he will use it when he wants to see fit
[1:25:49] amen that's the most important thing you
[1:25:51] know we are not like people try and make
[1:25:54] superheroes that they just do what they
[1:25:55] want no no we're surrendered
[1:25:57] amen it's not our will but it's his will
[1:26:00] is done
[1:26:01] hallelujah
[1:26:03] amen now the apostle paul would tell us
[1:26:06] sorry for this reading here but i'm but
[1:26:07] but i want to come to something that he
[1:26:09] says he says that the god of our lord
[1:26:11] jesus christ the father of glory may be
[1:26:13] given unto you the spirit
[1:26:15] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:26:16] and revelation and the knowledge of him
[1:26:19] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:26:20] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[1:26:22] hope of his calling and what is the
[1:26:24] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:26:26] in the saints and what is the exceeding
[1:26:28] greatness of his power to war toward uh
[1:26:32] to us lord sorry who believe according
[1:26:35] to the working of his mighty power which
[1:26:37] he wrought in christ when he raised him
[1:26:39] from the dead and set him at the right
[1:26:41] hand in heavenly places
[1:26:43] far abrov uh far above all principality
[1:26:46] and power and might and dominion and
[1:26:48] every name that is named not only in
[1:26:50] this world but also that which is to
[1:26:52] come and hath put all things under his
[1:26:54] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:26:57] all things to the church which is his
[1:26:59] body the fullness of him that filleth
[1:27:02] all in all
[1:27:03] so he's been placed now far above all
[1:27:06] principality and power so it doesn't
[1:27:08] matter how big now we're talking when
[1:27:10] we're talking about principality and
[1:27:11] powers we're talking about demon powers
[1:27:13] in high places right the battle we fight
[1:27:15] is not against flesh and blood
[1:27:17] right it's against demon power spiritual
[1:27:18] wickedness in high places amen but he
[1:27:21] says that he's been placed far above all
[1:27:23] those things and he has dominion over
[1:27:25] those things and every name that is
[1:27:27] named not only in this world but that
[1:27:29] which is to come and has put all things
[1:27:31] under his feet now we're gonna ask the
[1:27:34] question
[1:27:35] where are his feet today
[1:27:37] right because we are we just read that
[1:27:40] the church is his body
[1:27:42] right the church is his body i mean so
[1:27:44] if the church is his body and all these
[1:27:46] things are under his feet they're all
[1:27:48] under us
[1:27:50] hallelujah
[1:27:51] anything the devil will throw against us
[1:27:53] is actually beneath us
[1:27:55] amen and if it tries to take control of
[1:27:57] us or is actually
[1:27:58] causing us trouble amen it's out of its
[1:28:01] position
[1:28:02] hallelujah are you gonna tell it where
[1:28:04] to go in the name of jesus christ
[1:28:07] amen now what i love about it is it's
[1:28:09] not anything that we have a we could
[1:28:11] obtain in our own strength
[1:28:13] but we have become by his supreme grace
[1:28:16] if we are children amen then we're ears
[1:28:19] ears of god and joint is with christ
[1:28:22] amen so if that we suffer with him that
[1:28:24] we may be also glorified together so
[1:28:27] this word joint ear it's one who obtains
[1:28:30] something
[1:28:32] i mean as a joint participant so if
[1:28:35] we're a joint here everything he fell
[1:28:36] here too
[1:28:37] by his grace we
[1:28:39] we feel heir to it too remember he's the
[1:28:41] one that's conquered he conquered hell
[1:28:43] he conquered death he conquered the
[1:28:45] grave he conquered every spirit that
[1:28:47] could be named every trouble that we
[1:28:48] face is already conquered
[1:28:50] i mean so he's already conquered
[1:28:51] everything but
[1:28:53] amen because we're joint ears we fall
[1:28:56] here to his victory
[1:28:58] hallelujah
[1:29:00] amen now what i love about this is that
[1:29:03] we have a privilege now so so we have
[1:29:05] rights
[1:29:07] the christian has rights and god i'm not
[1:29:10] talking about national rights and you
[1:29:12] know what i'm not talking about i'm
[1:29:13] talking about rights in jesus christ
[1:29:15] which to me are far above
[1:29:17] i mean just just natural natural rights
[1:29:20] so we have the privilege because we have
[1:29:23] rights of because of who we are because
[1:29:26] of the blood of jesus christ
[1:29:28] then we have we have the privilege to
[1:29:30] enforce upon satan the claims that god
[1:29:32] give us
[1:29:34] and for god hath the law and his word is
[1:29:36] a law and god in his word made certain
[1:29:39] claims to the church therefore we have a
[1:29:41] right to force these claims upon satan
[1:29:44] and say give it back and he has to do it
[1:29:47] because we take god's agent the holy
[1:29:49] spirit go right down on our knees and
[1:29:51] say it's thus saith the lord he's got to
[1:29:53] give it up that's all because the holy
[1:29:55] spirit is there to make him do it i mean
[1:29:58] the law of the land is to enforce it's
[1:30:00] by it's by the land for the land i mean
[1:30:03] but the holy ghost is here to enforce
[1:30:06] aiming
[1:30:07] in our lives our privileges upon satan
[1:30:10] now what is that basically if satan says
[1:30:12] you'll never overcome
[1:30:14] that's your living and and you're in a
[1:30:17] mind battle with it
[1:30:18] and you're wrestling with him
[1:30:20] that means is actually he's dragging you
[1:30:22] down below your privilege
[1:30:25] because you are an overcomer you are
[1:30:27] victorious
[1:30:28] right remember the devil's meant to be
[1:30:30] beneath us
[1:30:31] sure we can't stop thoughts coming into
[1:30:33] our mind but what we do with it is very
[1:30:35] different thing
[1:30:38] amen or if we're sick and the devil says
[1:30:40] we'll never get well who said
[1:30:43] he doesn't know the future we know the
[1:30:45] future god knows the future
[1:30:47] right but we don't have to live under
[1:30:49] any form of defeat
[1:30:52] we have the privilege say satan know you
[1:30:55] have no right to hold us down in this
[1:30:57] defeat i'm victorious because jesus
[1:30:59] christ has made me victorious
[1:31:02] amen amen
[1:31:04] if we have a privilege
[1:31:06] then why not use it
[1:31:08] if we if we don't have the i mean if we
[1:31:10] have the privilege then why not use it
[1:31:13] it's our right
[1:31:15] it's our benefit that we draw from the
[1:31:17] power of his blood
[1:31:19] amen
[1:31:20] why do we allow the enemy any room at
[1:31:22] all
[1:31:24] like some little spirit working like a
[1:31:26] little fussing or a little contention
[1:31:27] you know why do we let that just linger
[1:31:31] that's like the lepers at the gate just
[1:31:33] sitting there
[1:31:34] why are we staying like this let's let's
[1:31:37] go get an answer
[1:31:39] amen don't let the threat to the enemy
[1:31:41] and or what he's doing linger any longer
[1:31:45] hallelujah
[1:31:47] we see fear can us
[1:31:50] but we don't have to put up with it it's
[1:31:52] not our portion to be afraid
[1:31:55] i mean god's god said to us no you'll
[1:31:57] have a power love and a sound mind
[1:31:59] we we don't have to put up with fear i
[1:32:02] mean because fear has never helped
[1:32:03] anyone fear just disables people's lives
[1:32:06] in the world as christians wherever it's
[1:32:08] just fear cripples people we don't have
[1:32:10] to live in fear we are called to live in
[1:32:13] faith it's our god-given right and
[1:32:15] privilege to walk a walk of faith and
[1:32:17] not have fear
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:21] don't let fear plague you
[1:32:26] we
[1:32:27] see the only communication we have
[1:32:29] between us and the devil
[1:32:31] is us commanding him to get back
[1:32:34] give us back our rightful property and
[1:32:36] leave in the name of jesus christ that
[1:32:38] should be the only communication with
[1:32:39] you and satan and we shouldn't put up
[1:32:41] with the conversation we have with him
[1:32:42] in our mind and we say no satan that's
[1:32:45] not my right
[1:32:46] that's not my portion
[1:32:48] god has given me all things in jesus
[1:32:50] christ
[1:32:51] i made more than a conqueror i mean his
[1:32:53] blood is more than enough i mean it's
[1:32:55] fully atoned for my sin i don't have to
[1:32:57] earn anything he earned all that down
[1:32:59] calvary for me he's my sacrifice he's my
[1:33:02] perfect lamb hallelujah
[1:33:05] we have to put up with him
[1:33:06] you think about the property we have
[1:33:08] healing is our property
[1:33:11] right total deliverance is our property
[1:33:14] joy is our property
[1:33:16] peace is our property perfect love is
[1:33:18] our property forgiveness is our property
[1:33:21] i mean rest for our souls is our
[1:33:23] property i mean prodigal's returning
[1:33:26] home is our property
[1:33:28] amen the holy ghost is ours to have
[1:33:31] that's our god-given right amen it's our
[1:33:33] god-given right to be healed it's our
[1:33:36] god-given right to be set free it's our
[1:33:38] god-given right to be delivered
[1:33:40] amen it's our god-given right to have
[1:33:43] the original faith of the book of acts i
[1:33:46] mean the genuine holy spirit ministering
[1:33:49] through each of us
[1:33:51] as to how the lord sees it fit to do
[1:33:54] that's our god-given right that's a
[1:33:55] privilege we're actually he's given us
[1:33:58] to live in that kind of fashion you know
[1:33:59] a believer can never live above their
[1:34:01] privilege amen because we have all
[1:34:03] things
[1:34:04] you know it's not like now we're down
[1:34:05] here and god's up here and we can't no
[1:34:07] no where joint is
[1:34:10] in the old testament under the law
[1:34:12] the woman in israel were like
[1:34:14] second-class citizens
[1:34:16] but because if you look at the temple
[1:34:18] the woman can only come a certain
[1:34:20] distance towards the holy of holies
[1:34:22] first it was the court of the gentiles
[1:34:24] they could come a certain area but they
[1:34:25] couldn't come further then it was the
[1:34:26] court of the woman they could come
[1:34:28] closer but they couldn't you know they
[1:34:29] come further than the gentiles but they
[1:34:31] couldn't that's as far as they go then
[1:34:32] there's the court of the men then there
[1:34:34] was the priests and everything they were
[1:34:36] seeing class citizens under the law but
[1:34:38] under the blood of jesus christ the
[1:34:40] apostle peter says that we are joint
[1:34:42] heirs together
[1:34:44] hallelujah so we are not now i'm not
[1:34:46] just talking about natural women now i'm
[1:34:48] talking about the church we're not
[1:34:49] seeing class citizens in the economy of
[1:34:51] god but by the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:53] he's lifted us up to be joint heirs with
[1:34:55] him amen
[1:34:57] hallelujah
[1:34:58] amen so we can't live above our
[1:35:00] privilege
[1:35:02] hallelujah
[1:35:04] amen trust that came out okay but you
[1:35:06] see you know
[1:35:07] none of us are second class citizen
[1:35:09] either naturally or spiritually
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:14] now these these are not just empty
[1:35:16] claims
[1:35:18] right empty words that never come to
[1:35:20] pass we have seen these things happen
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:24] amen we have seen many many healings i
[1:35:27] just ran these things down last night
[1:35:28] we've seen many many healings
[1:35:30] have we not who's been touched by god
[1:35:32] and know god's healed them
[1:35:33] right we've seen many many healings
[1:35:36] but people say well healing is just the
[1:35:38] children's bread
[1:35:39] well
[1:35:40] i don't know about you but i like bread
[1:35:42] with my meal
[1:35:44] i like a real good meal with brett i'm
[1:35:46] not going to throw out part of the feast
[1:35:47] i'm going to have i'm going to have the
[1:35:48] whole thing
[1:35:50] amen and then if we how can you remember
[1:35:53] the body change is actually one big
[1:35:55] divine healing
[1:35:57] it's not a temporal temporal healing
[1:35:59] it's a whole healing complete healing
[1:36:01] right that our bodies have transformed
[1:36:03] from from this to an immortal body
[1:36:06] amen
[1:36:08] so it's all in the atonement just the
[1:36:10] same blood that jesus shed to purchase
[1:36:12] our salvation is the same blood he
[1:36:13] shared to heal our bodies and heal our
[1:36:16] spirits
[1:36:17] amen you know i was thinking about the
[1:36:20] camps we've had and what the lord has
[1:36:22] done
[1:36:24] you know it's our right
[1:36:26] because of what god has done
[1:36:29] for him to live among us that's what he
[1:36:30] wanted to do his whole purpose of dying
[1:36:32] on calvary is that he would live in
[1:36:34] people
[1:36:35] that's what he wanted that's what he's
[1:36:36] always wanted he says heaven is my
[1:36:38] throne the earth is my foot stolen
[1:36:40] isaiah he says where's the place of my
[1:36:41] rest
[1:36:42] you know so he says i made these
[1:36:44] galaxies you look up you know you go to
[1:36:46] somewhere you can actually see more than
[1:36:47] about 12 stars you've got to go out from
[1:36:49] the suburbia and you know you see the
[1:36:50] milky way and everything he says i made
[1:36:52] that
[1:36:54] that's my throne
[1:36:55] this earth you're standing was my
[1:36:57] footstool but where's the place of my
[1:36:58] rest i want a place of rest and the
[1:37:00] bible says that the human soul is the
[1:37:02] place of his rest so he's calling out
[1:37:05] it's like i made all these things but
[1:37:06] where's the place of my rest and we can
[1:37:08] say lord here i am
[1:37:10] here i am
[1:37:12] hallelujah
[1:37:13] so that's what he was he's always wanted
[1:37:15] by us thinking you know i think about
[1:37:16] brother corbin i think it was the second
[1:37:19] camp we ever had you had a real touch
[1:37:20] with god there brother tim dodd's you
[1:37:22] know there's just in the back where he
[1:37:23] normally stands at cam and god just came
[1:37:25] down and changed his life you know that
[1:37:27] all started
[1:37:29] because sister vanessa had a real
[1:37:31] breakthrough in prayer one wednesday
[1:37:32] night when we had a prayer meeting who
[1:37:34] was there those early days oh boy
[1:37:36] hallelujah but you know what was amazing
[1:37:38] with that is she went home sorry if i
[1:37:40] take this for me taking this liberty she
[1:37:42] went home and brother cabin who wasn't
[1:37:44] coming to church's time said you know no
[1:37:46] you're not going on sunday i'm gonna
[1:37:48] pick where we're gonna go
[1:37:49] i think it was a month later he said
[1:37:51] okay we're getting in the car and they
[1:37:52] got in the car and they came straight to
[1:37:54] church where we had it there at parkside
[1:37:56] road and he's been here ever since
[1:37:57] praise the lord
[1:37:59] i mean but that at camp all started
[1:38:02] because someone decided i can't sit here
[1:38:04] at the gate
[1:38:05] i can't sit here i you know if i stay
[1:38:08] here we're all gonna die i need the
[1:38:09] salvation of my husband
[1:38:11] so she went into the house of the father
[1:38:14] hallelujah and the and and the answer
[1:38:16] came
[1:38:17] hallelujah i remember sister shannon was
[1:38:20] there that that uh was that praying but
[1:38:22] she cried out where's the god of elijah
[1:38:24] hallelujah and then isaac had that
[1:38:27] experience
[1:38:28] you know where he laid it all down he
[1:38:30] wrote that song oh sweet jesus take my
[1:38:32] life
[1:38:33] all my you know all my strivings all
[1:38:35] that strife you're the only thing i've
[1:38:36] ever done that's right
[1:38:37] amen he saw the pillow fire sorry what
[1:38:39] do you say you saw you saw yourself in
[1:38:41] him
[1:38:42] and then the lord said you just got the
[1:38:43] holy ghost and what was amazing about
[1:38:45] that is he didn't say it happened but
[1:38:46] then the next week i think i saw him and
[1:38:48] he looked different
[1:38:49] and and me and christine said isaac
[1:38:51] looks different something's happened to
[1:38:53] him
[1:38:54] hallelujah
[1:38:55] what is that going beyond going into the
[1:38:57] camp of the father to get what you need
[1:39:01] hallelujah you know we've had people
[1:39:02] come to camp and they
[1:39:04] and you know they said lord if you don't
[1:39:06] become real in this
[1:39:08] you got to prove this message is real at
[1:39:10] this camp and if you don't i'm gonna
[1:39:12] quit
[1:39:14] and god revealed it supernaturally to
[1:39:15] them and they're still believers to this
[1:39:16] day
[1:39:18] hallelujah transform them supernaturally
[1:39:21] i mean we've had many many things like
[1:39:22] that happen
[1:39:24] you know what i love also about the um
[1:39:26] you know well one i very much love that
[1:39:28] gabrielle is healthy strong and well but
[1:39:30] at that time we know that the um little
[1:39:32] liam where's
[1:39:33] where's liam shurik he's there you know
[1:39:35] at that time he was having all these
[1:39:37] welts and things come out on his body
[1:39:39] and this you know i know you know these
[1:39:40] testimonies but but i just want to let's
[1:39:42] just raise some faith our god still
[1:39:44] lives
[1:39:45] holy our god still lives and so the
[1:39:47] doctors gave them creams different
[1:39:48] things couldn't get any answer but when
[1:39:50] i stood up and testified that we did not
[1:39:52] accept this brother our man said i do
[1:39:54] not accept this either why should we put
[1:39:56] up with what the yo the devil says and
[1:39:59] so they prayed and tried to come back
[1:40:00] once and then it went hey
[1:40:02] gone gone to this day why we don't have
[1:40:05] to oh it's a virus or whatever sure it
[1:40:07] is but we don't have to put up with it
[1:40:09] why put up with the devil's works we can
[1:40:10] cast them out where we find them amen
[1:40:13] hallelujah you know i was telling the
[1:40:15] last time i was in papua new guinea i
[1:40:17] was telling the believers i mean that
[1:40:18] this message takes us back to a true day
[1:40:20] of pentecost experience
[1:40:22] amen and in that meeting when i was
[1:40:24] preaching the interpreters stopped for
[1:40:25] three or four minutes because everyone
[1:40:27] understood in their own language and i
[1:40:29] saw hardened men like these are mountain
[1:40:31] men
[1:40:32] man
[1:40:33] i wish i could describe them amazing
[1:40:35] believers but you know they live up in
[1:40:37] the mountains in papua new guinea where
[1:40:38] it snows
[1:40:39] and you know they said you know with
[1:40:40] their young people we take them up the
[1:40:42] mountain we train them
[1:40:45] they train
[1:40:46] but
[1:40:47] people that don't show any emotion
[1:40:50] weeping over the pulpit trying to close
[1:40:52] the service
[1:40:53] because god had just moved like that see
[1:40:55] it's not just an empty claim god comes
[1:40:57] and says that's true
[1:40:59] hallelujah because he wants us to see
[1:41:01] this the promises of god are not just
[1:41:03] empty promises they're not just a nice
[1:41:06] idea or something to tickle our you know
[1:41:08] just just give us some empty false hope
[1:41:10] it's not that this word is true this
[1:41:12] word will produce what it says it will
[1:41:14] produce i mean it will produce a rapture
[1:41:17] it will give you deliverance amen if you
[1:41:19] go to the camp of the father i mean it
[1:41:21] will give you peace it will give you joy
[1:41:24] you know don't just try jesus get a hold
[1:41:26] of jesus
[1:41:27] you know don't just try you know
[1:41:28] somebody said well i'll just try jesus
[1:41:30] don't just try him go get a hold of him
[1:41:32] hallelujah you really get a hold of him
[1:41:34] i mean your life will never be the same
[1:41:36] and i'm a testimony of that the drunken
[1:41:38] lost university student and god found me
[1:41:41] but i was looking for him something said
[1:41:42] i'm sick of this life you know i may
[1:41:44] have all these friends and great times
[1:41:45] but i just it just produced depression
[1:41:47] and emptiness in my life i thought you
[1:41:49] know and i started i found the message
[1:41:51] on the internet and i just started
[1:41:52] listening to brother brennaman he'd
[1:41:53] preach about why so many people fail to
[1:41:55] keep the victory and you know redemption
[1:41:57] and completeness and enjoy you had to be
[1:41:59] completely redeemed in the joy of it i
[1:42:01] thought i don't know what that is i
[1:42:02] always believed jesus was god but i had
[1:42:04] no idea but then that caused it hunger
[1:42:06] to come forth i and i i was so simple in
[1:42:09] my mind i thought well if jesus if the
[1:42:11] tomb is empty and he's alive forevermore
[1:42:14] i can meet that one
[1:42:16] hallelujah and i did
[1:42:18] i say rather he met me
[1:42:20] and changed my life forever
[1:42:23] amen
[1:42:25] now
[1:42:26] we'll come to
[1:42:28] joshua really quickly
[1:42:30] joshua was determined he was focused
[1:42:33] they had to defeat this enemy
[1:42:35] they couldn't let him linger
[1:42:37] they could because he knew when the sun
[1:42:39] goes down they could hide and they could
[1:42:40] rally together and fight again the next
[1:42:42] day he wanted it settled then and there
[1:42:45] and that's why he stood there under
[1:42:47] inspiration and he told the sun and the
[1:42:49] moon to stand still and they were there
[1:42:51] for a whole day i don't know how that
[1:42:53] worked but you know
[1:42:55] i work in the science field but i'm not
[1:42:56] too worried about the details if god
[1:42:58] said it i believe it
[1:43:00] if he said if you repent be baptized
[1:43:02] name the lord jesus christ remission of
[1:43:03] sin you shall receive the gift of the
[1:43:04] holy ghost i don't know the details i
[1:43:06] just believed it and it happened
[1:43:09] hallelujah lay hands on the second show
[1:43:11] you know and they shall recover i don't
[1:43:13] know the details i just believe it and
[1:43:14] it happens
[1:43:15] hallelujah
[1:43:17] amen so because he was determined that
[1:43:21] these enemies would not linger now we
[1:43:23] want to be in the same kind of mode
[1:43:26] right don't just get a small victory get
[1:43:28] a complete victory
[1:43:31] don't just don't just give the devil a
[1:43:32] lick and just knock him out
[1:43:35] hallelujah knock him out of the ring
[1:43:38] brother bam says in paradox he says now
[1:43:41] one day in the heat of battle when the
[1:43:43] kings had made a great covenant among
[1:43:44] themselves and had come down against
[1:43:46] joshua and the children of israel that
[1:43:48] god had promised in the land and he had
[1:43:50] routed the enemy and they were in the
[1:43:53] woods and hills scattered out through
[1:43:54] the wilderness there and joshua looked
[1:43:57] and he seen the sun going down he knew
[1:43:59] if those armies got a chance to replace
[1:44:01] themselves and come back again why he
[1:44:03] knows he'd have a twice as hard a time
[1:44:06] and probably lose more men if they ever
[1:44:08] got a place to unite themselves together
[1:44:11] now this is where ministers this is
[1:44:13] where we fail this is where the church
[1:44:14] fails when this revival we've just had
[1:44:17] this great campaigns across the country
[1:44:19] when we've had the enemy running we
[1:44:21] should keep him on the run
[1:44:23] but the thing of it is we have to go off
[1:44:26] on tantrums and so forth
[1:44:28] amen and big sprees of buildings making
[1:44:31] more for our groups and so forth and
[1:44:33] there you come and separating themselves
[1:44:35] from the word and taking this and that
[1:44:36] and then building up some great big
[1:44:38] organization and starting something else
[1:44:40] that's the way it always goes that's the
[1:44:42] way it is
[1:44:43] it was in the days of luther wesley
[1:44:45] moody sankey finney knox and calvert all
[1:44:47] the way down it's been the same way they
[1:44:49] get their eyes off the revival and get
[1:44:52] on to what they can do for themselves
[1:44:55] but you know what happened joshua wasn't
[1:44:57] that type of a man
[1:44:58] he needed time the sun was going down he
[1:45:01] knowed if the enemy ever built up the
[1:45:02] revivals almost at the end of the close
[1:45:04] of it like we stand today he knew if he
[1:45:07] ever waited till the enemy got fortified
[1:45:09] against him it would be hard to win that
[1:45:11] battle you know what he did he know that
[1:45:13] god promised that land he needed more
[1:45:15] time so the sun was about to go down
[1:45:17] then he said sun stands still i mean a
[1:45:19] paradox indeed and that sun stood there
[1:45:22] for a full day never moved and the moon
[1:45:24] over echelon never moved also because
[1:45:26] the bible said here it was never a time
[1:45:28] before a sense like that that god
[1:45:30] hearkened to the voice of a man you say
[1:45:33] oh if we had just lived in that day
[1:45:36] jesus said in mark 11 24 if you say to
[1:45:39] this mountain be moved into a doubt in
[1:45:40] your heart but believe what you've said
[1:45:42] will come to pass and you can have what
[1:45:44] you've said still grace and the paradox
[1:45:46] on down through into our age sure that
[1:45:49] moon and sun stood still until joshua
[1:45:51] fought his way through with israel and
[1:45:53] avenged themselves upon the enemy why
[1:45:56] it was in the line of duty i mean so we
[1:45:58] don't want to be we don't want to just
[1:46:00] get the enemy off on the run and then go
[1:46:02] off on a tantrum
[1:46:04] amen oh brother so and so did this
[1:46:06] sister so-and-so do this this is wrong
[1:46:08] here and you just go we don't want to go
[1:46:09] off on that kind of a tantrum no the
[1:46:11] enemy's on the run
[1:46:13] i mean let's let's make him sweat and
[1:46:15] stress a bit more and chase him a bit
[1:46:17] further amen let's keep him on the run
[1:46:19] that's what we're going to do i mean
[1:46:21] until we have possessed every divine
[1:46:24] promise
[1:46:25] hallelujah joshua was focused his goal
[1:46:28] was total annihilation of his enemy i
[1:46:30] mean because the enemy had no right to
[1:46:32] live there now i'm talking about
[1:46:33] spiritual enemies now right so the devil
[1:46:35] will encamp upon the promises of god and
[1:46:37] say it's not for you
[1:46:39] we don't just want to chase them off a
[1:46:40] part of the promise we want to chase
[1:46:42] them off every divine promise
[1:46:44] hallelujah you know we take that
[1:46:46] scripture mark 11 24 if you stand to
[1:46:48] this mountain you know i don't need
[1:46:51] physical mountains to move
[1:46:53] right i don't i don't need to move
[1:46:56] the haywards hill so it's flat so i can
[1:46:57] drive to work and it's an easier
[1:46:59] straight run i don't need that kind of
[1:47:00] thing
[1:47:02] but there's mountains
[1:47:04] there's things the devils placed and
[1:47:06] tries to make them look so big
[1:47:08] we have a right by the authority of god
[1:47:11] to tell that thing to move in the name
[1:47:13] of jesus christ i mean we are called to
[1:47:15] believe for the impossible and it may be
[1:47:18] things in our family traits that have
[1:47:19] passed down we just think there's no way
[1:47:21] we can overcome this yes we can
[1:47:23] yes we can i mean there has to come a
[1:47:25] time where it comes to an end why don't
[1:47:27] why why don't let it end in you
[1:47:30] why don't you be the one with that trait
[1:47:32] of maybe stubbornness or indifference or
[1:47:34] unforgiveness or anger or whatever it is
[1:47:37] last when it was just passed down
[1:47:38] through the family it's got to stop
[1:47:40] somewhere
[1:47:41] why not stop right here
[1:47:44] hallelujah what's impossible no it's not
[1:47:46] with god all things are possible amen
[1:47:48] and it is our right and privileged to
[1:47:50] believe for the impossible
[1:47:53] amen because when the lord steps on the
[1:47:55] scene
[1:47:56] impossibilities become possible
[1:48:00] hallelujah
[1:48:02] amen
[1:48:05] if satan has robbed you of the privilege
[1:48:07] of being a son or daughter of god you
[1:48:09] have a right this morning by the holy
[1:48:10] spirit to enforce the claim of god and
[1:48:12] say give them back
[1:48:14] amen if he's afflicted you and made you
[1:48:16] sick you have were right before god to
[1:48:17] enforce the laws of god by his stripes
[1:48:19] we're healed amen bring him back turn
[1:48:22] him loose
[1:48:23] we are taking him you're taking him out
[1:48:25] yonder of death we claim him bring him
[1:48:27] back now that's the enforcement restore
[1:48:29] it back to his natural condition again a
[1:48:31] man is sick a baby is sick a woman is
[1:48:33] sexy throughout their natural condition
[1:48:35] then we have a right to enforce our
[1:48:37] claim not our claim it's it's our claim
[1:48:39] because god gave it to us by his stripes
[1:48:42] we were healed he was wounded for our
[1:48:44] transgressions were the stripes we were
[1:48:46] healed now we have a right to enforce
[1:48:48] that law
[1:48:49] and the law giver the holy spirit
[1:48:51] himself is here the ancient agent of god
[1:48:54] to see that it's done that way
[1:48:57] amen that's the only way he can work is
[1:48:58] when you let him work
[1:49:00] see you've got to believe that there's a
[1:49:02] law oh if i could ever he says if i ever
[1:49:05] get to my text there's a law there's a
[1:49:07] law given amongst everything
[1:49:10] hallelujah so
[1:49:12] we can either sit like the lepers did
[1:49:15] before they went to the enemy's camp
[1:49:18] and just let life continue on
[1:49:20] or
[1:49:21] we can go and we're not called to go to
[1:49:24] the camp of the enemy but we can go into
[1:49:26] the presence of god and get what we have
[1:49:29] need of
[1:49:30] if it's salvation if it's deliverance if
[1:49:33] it's healing if it's salvation of a
[1:49:35] loved one whatever it is
[1:49:38] you know whatever it is you can go into
[1:49:40] the presence of god i believe and you
[1:49:42] can get your answer
[1:49:44] and you can go go away rejoicing
[1:49:47] knowing god is here
[1:49:49] and he's met your need and the answer is
[1:49:51] on its way
[1:49:52] hallelujah but it all depends what to
[1:49:54] you yeah i mean i mean it all it all
[1:49:56] depends about
[1:49:57] what you want to do as for me
