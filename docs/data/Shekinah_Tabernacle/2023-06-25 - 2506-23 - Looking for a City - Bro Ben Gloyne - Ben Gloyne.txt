service goes and all those things but yeah praise God it's going to be a great day hallelujah amen so God bless you all amen let's um let's go to um the scripture this morning we're gonna go to Hebrews chapter 11 gonna read from verse 8 down to verse 16. and um amen the Lord's good isn't he praise the Lord amen amen if there was a word that was it could express great you know Great Is Thy Faithfulness this is English word that could express great in a because it's great his faithfulness is great amen Hebrews 11 and 8 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so adjourned in the in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in the Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the ears with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose building maker as God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen therefore sprang up even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars in the sky and multitude and as the sandwiches by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of all that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city Amy I'm glad God's not ashamed to be called our God today hallelujah amen let's just bow he's in a word of prayers amen this morning gracious father we thank you Lord as Lord we have sown great as thy faithfulness Lord how true that is Lord oh you're so faithful Lord we're so thankful Lord that you are true to your word Lord you don't back up on any promise Lord and when we go astray Lord you never just let us go Lord father but you go after us Lord we're so thankful for your mercy that brings us back and Lord we just want to ask as we've as we have read your great Eternal Word but Lord we need you the great author to come and speak once again Lord and not just anoint me the speaker but anoint the hero also oh god father may you just take control of the service we're so thankful we can gather Lord in this manner and praise and worship you we thank you for the specials Lord we thank you for the songs and Lord just pray you just take the service now and just have your way speak to our hearts like only you can Lord and we'll always want to remember those who couldn't be here today be their portion as well their God may they know that Lord they are not alone Lord but you are there with with him father because you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us dear God may this be a Monumental day Lord in our Christian walk father in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats uh this morning and just a bit of a context I pray that the Lord will tie these together but you know just just from Matthew 1 and 1 the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham now I find it amazing that God would tie tie him coming to the Earth through these two men and through every believer but you know there's there's something about us in this day and age now and I know every believer no doubt has felt this way but you know there comes a time when you identify more with with Heaven than you are upon this Earth that that that the more as time goes on you know you know the world is falling it's falling apart as prophesied at work you know but the Believers we know we're not falling apart but we're ascending you know the world is falling like you know like brother Bram saw the vision of his uh son Billy Paul when he went out into the world he saw him jump out of of a window and he's falling tumbling and laughing and falling and he cries out you know brother Brown cries out and he says oh God catch my son then the you know then he saw later on he saw the hands of God catch him and pick him back up where he were and truly this world is falling and laughing as it's falling and going into chaos but I'm so thankful that the that the mighty hands of Jehovah God have caught us amen and picked us up and is carrying us up and restoring us to where we should be but there Comes A Time in our walk where I realize we're we can't stay here much longer you know this world is not our home it's more than a catch phrase it's more than a buzz phrase or whatever more than a song but it becomes a reality to us and I trust this morning or you know maybe you know you've come to that place this world is not my home I'm just passing through this place you know I'm not ordained to stay here I never really I was never made to fit in this place you know I remember growing up I never really fet you're fit in different you know the other cool kids they're the jocks there with the whatever I didn't really fit in any kind of group you know but I come to find out I fit in a group amen amen of the redeemed of Jesus Christ amen and it's because this is where we truly belong amen among among God's children amen and that's because we belong in heaven amen but you see now it's amazing when you look at the uh Promises of God and you know how how Abraham I just looked yesterday I was driving to prepare and you know just thinking about these things in the weekend you know about about how Abraham Isaac and Jacob they all Fellowship Together live together and we're and and we're Heirs of the same promise you know many times we read the Bible and this one's born lives this long dies and the the next one comes on the scene and and we often forget their lives all over overlapped each other and so Abraham Isaac and Jacob they were the ears of the same promise you know it's amazing when you can sit and you can talk with someone who is ear of the same promise you know someone has met the same God you've met amen the same you know they've been transformed by the same God and then you'll become to realize actually the same God gave me the promises given you the promise and now we can Fellowship together and sojourn in this world Amen but we are ears of the same promise now that promise was more than a promised son coming but it was actually because they met The God Who made the heavens and earth they begin looking for a city that wasn't upon this Earth they were looking for a Heavenly City and it wasn't just Abraham looking for the city but Isaac was looking for that City Jacob was looking for that City they all were looking who's looking for that city today amen that was their desire and I you know I believe this is our desire too yeah you know we're we're hungering Amen to to to go to that place now but the reason we're hungering to go is not because the world has fallen apart many people just want to go to heaven because this world is in chaos but that's not the Believers actually desire you know sure we look around we say we just don't fit here anymore but you know but but it's more we don't just want to go because we we want to leave this pest house behind but we want to go because we want to be with him just like the Apostle Paul will put it so well in second Corinthians 5 he says for we know that our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not that we should be unclothed so not that we should leave this world but that we should be closed upon see that's the desire of our hearts Lord I want to step into that new body I want to be where you are so this is the groaning there's the expectation that mortality might be swallowed up of life I mean I trust that's the hunger of your heart today we can't be here much longer we're here at the end of the end of the end praise God while we're here let's be a living witness let's bear Shining Light but you know we can't be here much longer you know we're in a Rapture season we're in a resurrection cycle amen we're we're under expectations through the dead in Christ race and it's not going to be you know it's not maybe my grandchildren's generation it's this generation I'm under expectation to hear you know William or the girls had changed from a little voice going Daddy to Daddy you know William you're picking me up and carrying me around we're in it Lord we're in it Dad we're going to be changed because why we see them change in front of us I trust that's your expectation praise God if you're if you're less than 18 to 21 you're going to be changed to that age if you're older than that you're going to be made young again praise God it's going to be an awesome time but we're living in that season amen so so we can we can have a you know expectation today and brother you know there's something about something about when you meet him you just want to be with him you love being in his presence but you want to see him face to face and you know brother bam says here he says and I want to talk to him and um and you and I know you do too that's why we're here this afternoon I'll say even this morning you love him you long to see him there's something in your heart that longs for that place where you know you've come from it's behind the curtain just the human just the human heart is hungering to get him behind that curtain again to look up past the curtain that's why we come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to see what God will tell us there's something longing to look beyond the curtain of time because these five senses these bodies were trapped and limit us so much Faith declares the Unseen right but one day Faith will become sight I mean we don't just believe and know that we come from God go back to God we'll be with him amen for eternity that your heaven will come down upon the Earth there'll be a new heavens and new earth amen that you're the one that we've loved and we've and we've served and we've longed to see we'll see him face to face more than just his presence Sweeping in the room but we'll see him we'll be caught up to freedom in the air amen who's with me today amen let's just let's just really say we know where we're going we know where we're going in spite of all trouble frustrations ups and downs we know where we're going and I trust there's something in you that desires that Heavenly land amen that you're not bogged down by the lukewarm Spirit of lady osia caught up in the cares of life sure we have cares of life but may it not be the thing that holds us down we're going to take care of life we need to have jobs family all these kind of things we're responsible for a lot of things in life but don't let that be your all in all let the all and all be I want to see him see Enoch you know we've got to come to a place if Mama don't go I'm gonna go if Dad is not going to walk with God I'm going to walk with God if my brother don't walk with him my sister don't walk with him my spouse I'm walking with him that's amazing Enoch walked with God and was not because God took him doesn't say anything about his children doesn't say anything about his wife but he walked with God and that's got to be the same thing we can't let our families hold us back amen we can't even let ourselves hold us back let's just walk with God Amen because remember the only way you can really help one another or your family is to walk with God Hallelujah that's what you've got to do amen so let's just walk with God today Hallelujah not just today but for the rest of our lives now when you think about Abraham he didn't he didn't he didn't start off in this kind of condition he didn't he didn't he wasn't born and then he's a little kid saying I want to see Jesus Oh I want to see great Jehovah God who made all things you know he didn't he didn't start this way longing for that country but as he walked with but the reason he started to long for that country is because he met the king of that country he met the king of the city he met God himself right but he wasn't born this way so Abraham started as a very natural kind of a man worried about what's going on in the world looking after his family and we know when we meet God we still do those things right we don't become uh so Heavenly minded we become no earthly good right we're not some Monk in some Nirvana State sitting on under a tree somewhere right we actually become useful upon this Earth amen some of you don't agree some of you agree so hey praise a lot you know anywho but he didn't start off this way Isaac didn't start off that way he had to met the same God that his father met Jacob didn't start start off that way either he had to meet the same God as father and grandfather met amen no doubt they'd sit around the campfire and you know it can be a bit frustrating sometimes when people talk about God and you don't know him you know people walk off they they switch off they think about something else but when you meet the same one you can have Fellowship you can lock into that conversation you're part of that conversation so no doubt there are days when Isaac just wandered off his dad's talking about God didn't know him but he met him one day then now they could have real Fellowship as a as a father and a son and then then when Jacob's born he maybe thought his granddad was a bit loopy but then he met the same God that his grandfather talked about it changed the whole conversation whole change the whole family Dynamic see so it's more than just having a parents having being Believers or even a spouse or a or a sibling he's going to be your God amen amen so he didn't start off this way no it's amazing when you look at the people that God see see God comes to see God is not ashamed to be called their God we have a lot of spots in life we're not proud of there's a lot of things written in the Bible that you know if if just say if Abraham was sitting there with Moses and Moses would write the commentary of his life Abraham would probably say do you have to write it that way right do you really have to write it that way do you really have to put that in do you really have to put that in there you know you know I backslid out of the promised land because of because of drought and things go down to different countries oh yeah I'm scared to you know for my own skin because I got a beautiful wife and I'm trying to preserve myself don't care about her you know because remember really if you think about if God did not intervene not once but twice Sarah would have been married to another man but it's Abraham trying to save his own skin this is the father of the faith we're talking about you see many times we wrestle with our own failures these ones had failures no I'm not excusing sin no ways okay but you know we wrestle with our past and our failures remember Abraham was walking with God when he did these things some people think as soon as you meet God you have no trouble no you do you have trouble sometimes you have more trouble than before and that's okay God's doing a work in your life he's going to refine you and mold you and take things out of your life that don't belong there so you know no doubt Abraham would say to Moses do you really need to write this there you go imagine that you're about to fly into a different country because maybe you've got to leave your Homeland you're going through customs you and your wife are filling out customs forms and she looks over and you have ticked unmarried you'd start having words what do you mean Sarah you've got to put on married too big you're beautiful they're going to kill me think about me advice he's thinking what about me I don't get married to some King in this place I'm married to you but you know that's kind of what happened they're walking into Greer they're going into Egypt wherever they went you know Abraham's saying to Sarah Sarah you're a beautiful woman they're going to kill me to get you let's just say we're brother and sister and they were half brother and sister so it was kind of true but it was you know a white lie or a small lie still a big lie there's no lie scale they're all lies okay Shady deal still a shady deal okay we don't do those things around here I mean we don't tell lies oh I'm just bending the truth a bit that's a lie let's not do bending okay we're not meant to be flexible with the truth it's a rigid thing you may be flexible naturally but don't be flexible with the truth amen so you know they you know this happens not once but twice and God intervenes yeah yeah and you know and then and then Abraham comes to a spot where where he he realizes the promise is so impossible that he laughs in the very presence of God you know it wasn't just it wasn't just Sarah that laughed April Imagine This God comes down in a service let's just bring it into today and maybe the song leader someone stands up and calls you out and says this promise is for you and you've been thinking about this promise and God's already spoken to you before and he's here to confirm it and you just like get in the floor and roll and laugh this is what Abraham was doing yeah I don't think he'd really want Moses to be writing that down because I'm the father of the faith not a father of laughter or a doubt or unbelief but he rolled in the presidency then Abraham fell down upon his face and laughed and God's just telling God said unto Abraham and for Sarah thy wife thou shall not call the name Sarah but Sarah shall her name be and I'll bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I'll bless her and she shall be the mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her this is the kind of promise and Abraham's been actually walking with this promise for a while but he comes to a point he thinks this is just a joke he'd say to Moses you don't please don't write it that way you know do you really need to put that bit in there you know I'm the father of the nation you know please don't put this in there but thing is God allows these things to be written God allows these things to be written because he's not ashamed of his people he's not ashamed of his people you know he he's actually proud of Abraham you know because because after Calvary we know in the Old Testament there's all these things written of their failures and faults but when you come through the blood of Jesus Christ and now and now the Apostle Paul is inspired by the same one that inspired Moses as now writing a Divine commentary of these people's lives but through the blood of Jesus Christ there's sin and their mistakes are all gone those things are not written of Abraham by Paul he said he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in the faith you say well hold on this looks like a staggering going on under the blood of bulls and goats sure this really did happen but in the mind of God because of the blood of Jesus Christ he don't see your mistakes he don't see your laughter and your doubt and your how can this be no if you're part of the promise you're part of the promise I think we can say praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand right now all right praise God hallelujah see Hallelujah see we wrestle with these things but God don't wrestle with them you know we think we think man God must be ashamed of us look at what we've done and look at who we are and look at where we've failed and you know but God is not ashamed to be called their God see the accuser comes along he's got a list he's got a list he quotes them back to God because remember one thing will hold a person one thing can stop the resurrection this is how powerful the blood of Jesus Christ has to be remember because of the if if Satan has an accusation that that sticks The Plan of Redemption is actually totally on hold because God can't lose one of his children that's one thing he can't do he cannot lie he cannot go back on his word and he cannot lose a part of himself that's what his children are part of himself so if Satan can just get one and it can be even the most smallest accusation but if there's that one accusation the whole plan is actually on hold because God can't lose one of his you see so the accuser has a list and he reminds he reminds God about that list Hallelujah yeah no yo we wrestle with these things God don't wrestle with them amen God has confidence in his blood God has confidence in his salvation amen that's why he's not ashamed you know he's not embarrassed by us he's not embarrassed by you Hallelujah you may be embarrassed by yourself but God ain't embarrassed by you praise the Lord let's just have a rejoicing Time come on can we do that today you know we we live under such a burden of failure Jesus took our failure he took our shame he took our guilt he took our regret he took all those things that day up Calvary and we bear them no more [Applause] you may remember this I don't know how it was like for Abraham and Sarah after the second time they go out of a foreign country and he's told a lie about his wife I don't know how it was but that would have been a brill that wasn't just a casual thing that happened right but God didn't impute it to him God forgave them God let it go I believe Sarah let it go too I trust we can look beyond our failures look beyond our Humanity look beyond our failure you know see even even Isaac will get to a place where he did the same thing with his wife backsled they go leave the land and he says say you're my sister the same sin continues down you think but surely Lord you've taken care of this thing but our children will fight the same Devils we fought yeah that's right they'll come to a situation where they're fighting the same enemy yeah yeah but our God is greater than that enemy I trust we're together this morning you see but you know there can be such a wrestling see Abraham didn't start off just walking with God Jimenez him and his parents especially they came out of Babel the Tower of Babel yeah he was an idolater he worshiped Idols I don't know how many he had but he used to worship them but then God called him one day and that was that's what made the difference I'm just trying to find a quote here see that's what made the difference God called him that's what he was like anyone else but God called him that's what made the difference now God didn't haphazardly call Abraham before the foundation of the world the Lamb of God was slam in God's mind he had Abraham in his mind he was going to be the father of Nations amen Abraham didn't know this when he was born there's a lot of things about ourselves we do not know when we're a child even when we're an adult there's a lot of us Abraham was 75 years old when God called him that's a big portion of Life he'd already lived he thought well this is just me hey I'm retiring I'm done wow no no God wasn't God hadn't even started yet has really his eternal you know what God put him on the earth for hadn't even begun until he was 75 years old sometimes we think well we just stayed in our ways I would never never have that idea in our mind amen because we think well we're done and God says no you haven't even started yet but I'm at retirement age no no you're ready you're ready we can be young and we're ready we can be older and be ready it's God's timing God wants to use us for a certain thing you know like I think of an orchestra you know there's a you know there's a lead violin there's a lead cello lead whatever and they play a lot of the um music but everyone in that Orchestra is going to play with the same passion yeah they're going to play with the same enthusiasm they're going to come under the same anointing of the conductor the music they're going to be at every practice they're going to be there dilatory dressed right they're not going to come in sloppy they're going to have their shoes shine the same way they're going to look all the same right but there's some people that just maybe pick up the symbols once they're going to play it with the same passion they can apply it with the same enthusiasm and they just go crash once and then they sit down they're done three hour I I know how long those things go for but yeah it can be three hours of playing just one thing on a triangle but that's the part they're ordained to play they're no better than the lead violinist they know better than the lead part because everyone must be there to make the music play right so so maybe that crash just you know I think in Tchaikovsky's one of his overtures or whatever he has cannons firing that'd be cool to play that one what are you on the orchestra I'm a Canon we don't have that live anymore but you know anyway Russians like loud music apparently but you see you know we could just be a thing of a triangle but let's play that part with the same enthusiasm the same passion the same Joy because God's ordained us even for that part as long as I'm in the orchestra I'm happy Hallelujah so you see Abraham's part started late in his life but that was his time to play the part you see he started off as an idolaterer he started off just like anyone else but God called him and that's what made the difference now as I said that God you know God before the foundation of the world thought of Abraham he knew when he had come the role he had play what he'd do Abraham had no idea about it until God called him and then even as his Walking with God God will reveal more of himself in his plan to Abraham and then so even in spite of in spite of all his mistakes of all his failures of him laughing at God's promise God didn't throw him away God didn't quit God didn't get well you just you just too stiff-necked and laugh and all these things you make fun of me you're done no God don't work that way God don't run his business haphazardly God does not individually call a person to throw them away later yeah remember this this message is a bridegroom call to a union it's not a collective thing it's not a nationwide thing it's an individual thing where God is calling Sons and Daughters to be United with him right so when God calls you by this word it's not a haphazard call it's come unto me I'm calling you you're part of this word you need to see that you're part of this word you're not part of this world Abraham thought he was part of this world but he began to realize I'm actually more part of a Heavenly world that I am a natural world and it's the same thing with you and I trust you've come to a place in your life where actually I'm more part of that world than this world I identify more with Heaven than I do this Earth there's just something in me that longs to go there more than longs to stay here hello you can see that yo when the spirit of God moves you say that's really who I am amen when you hear the word that's really who I am you read this word you know I had a funny thought come to mind and maybe I'll preach about it sometime it was like three in the morning I was getting William a bottle in this thought just came to mind what Bible are you reading yeah some people read this Bible they get a whole different kind of thing but to the Bride of Jesus Christ the book is not sealed it's come open we know who God is we know who we are we know who the devil is he's a loser by the way and he's going to burn we ain't going to burn we're going to shine and rejoice and dance around the throne amen so the book has not veiled to us it's been opened praise the Lord so God God before the foundation of the world thought of Abraham and what he would do he thought of you and what you would do he would look Beyond he knew remember God by Foreign foreknowledge looked through time and saw you answer a desire knew that you'd want to be saved that you'd want to be part of him so he put a seat of election in your soul that he put there you didn't put there right you didn't make yourself a Christian the Bible says it's not him that willeth will runeth but God that shows Mercy says it's not him that says I'm going to be the best Christian out no or I'm going to do this with all my might no it's God that shows Mercy right and we know God showed us Mercy why because he's changed our hearts changed our desires changed our lives and we can look back and say this wasn't actually my idea this is not on my schedule I didn't have this on my Google Calendar right this this wasn't my Five-Year Plan but it was in God's Eternal plan and that's What mattered see sometimes we wrestle with but I was raised in church but there came a time when the light came on right there came a time when the light came on just like someone like myself out from the world but the light came on one day I heard the same word that you have all heard being raised in church but the light went on and that's the thing that makes us all in common the light went on see it doesn't matter where God found us the light went on and I trust the light has gone on today amen you can say yes God has become a personal God Amen he's not just a god of my family of the church I go to or whatever but he's alive to me amen he's real amen he's not a figment of my imagination but he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah praise God so now amen see he wasn't see Abraham was just like any other man maybe coming out of Babylon perhaps an idolata but God by election God does the choosing we can't choose God does the choosing we have nothing to do with it well then what about Free Will well the Bible says whosoever will let them come yeah if you're willing there's a place if you want him he's here to be wanted he's here to be received if you want him right but we can't let this world bog us down that we come to a place where we don't want him anymore see the devil wants to make us lukewarm formal and Powerless he wants to fill our mind and fill our desires with everything but God the devil will never help you in your Christian walk he'll never put a thought in your mind you should go pray oh I never put the thought of your mind isn't the Lord amazing isn't he great the devil won't do that kind of a thing he'll say you're too tired you're too busy what about this this has got to happen what about this and just fail you to overflowing of worry and things amen oh is that just me he does too I'm glad okay I'm glad I'm glad we have we let you praise a lot you know but you see the devil never encourage you in your Christian walk before you meet God the devil's not resisting you none he's encouraging you in his way but then when the Lord gets a hold of you and you begin to swim against the tide you know man this is a struggle of course it is because you've given your life to God and the devil wants it back but the thing is your life never belonged to the devil and it never will belong to the devil sure we're all born under his influence of his anointing but the seed of God on the inside of us was Gods we never belong to Satan to begin with amen we belong to the Lord now now this has got something to this is about um jewelry but I'm not talking about jewelry here but it's not just especially that underlined but he's answering a question the sister's asking about you know wedding rings and and jewelry and necklaces and things but but he's saying here but I think it's the approach of it yeah it's the way you do it see it's the motive behind it and when you say it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone so when something grips you so much that's not of God it begins to get a hold of you we all know a time when something's just a casual interest and it starts to fill your mind more and your affections more and your imagination more and it fills your whole life and it may not even be a sinful thing I remember the last thing the Lord dealt with me before I met him is that he said to me you're worshiping your education I was just wanting to do well I was studying and I used to biochemistry in these things and you know but but it consumed all that I was but it wasn't a sinful thing it's not sinful to get an education get a degree that's all fine right but when it when it gets a hold of you so much you don't have any room for anything else in your life then that's the problem see and and the thing is when the Lord told me that I surrendered it to him did I quit studying no I finished my studies yeah but it did it wasn't my all in all see so when something is getting see some you see when you see it getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone who's with me here amen amen don't let don't let the things of this world grip you in such a way even things that are not wrong especially you know if something's wrong get rid of it but even things that are actually it's not sinful but if it grips you amen that it fills your imagination your desires everything then leave that thing alone it's not worth it amen it's better to walk with God than than you know get caught up in those things Hallelujah now the reason Abraham Isaac and Jacob all look for that cities because they all met the king of that City now he came in different forms now if you read through the Book of Genesis even the read through the account of Abraham's walk with God God comes in different ways he comes as you know Jehovah it comes as the god of Lord God Almighty al-shadai you know he comes to different forms then he comes as Melchizedek they there's not three different gods it's the same God changing form yeah right so we'll read this then we'll go to the scripture to to to show how this ties and now we find this grace through the Abraham on the road back coming back after the victory is over he met the possessor of heavens and earth Melchizedek which is the king of Jerusalem king of Salem which was Jerusalem which is the king of Peace which is the king of righteousness he had no father he had no mother he never did beginning never will end so that was nothing else but the almighty and he met him on the road home from the slaughter of the king he met the possessor the one who owned all things met him on the road back what a glorious thing you see he met the king of that Eternal City and that's why he wanted to find the city because he met the king of that City now remember Isaac and Jacob were were the same heir to that same promise sure he didn't come to Isaac or Jacob as Melchizedek but it was still the same God in a different form coming to them so you see thing is when anyone really meets God it puts them under expectation I want to go to that City Hallelujah see for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him Tom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having near the beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider how this great man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth part of the spoils right but to have to be without father or mother without dissent or beginning a days or end of life that only one person can be that that's eternal this is not a natural man right this is God hallelujah this is God himself that Abraham you say but this but you say but consider how great this man was verse four yeah because he came in the form of a man it's not a priesthood right it's not a natural King this was God himself Abraham met and then he had such a longing to go to that great city are you all with me today maybe I'm just repeating myself but you know I think we should set our affections on things above right our heart should be remember where your heart is that's where your Treasures are also right so we should say Lord I want my heart to be in heaven maybe where my treasures are not upon the Earth with these things where moth and rust doth corrupt amen but you see when you see something get a hold of you that's not of God leave the thing alone but when you see the Lord get a hold of you you grip on too he gets a halt you get a hold amen until and until he changes you you see but we live in a very lukewarm age and lukewarmness we are not exempt from lukewarmness we are not immunized from lukewarmness that's right right but we have we have antibodies spiritual antibodies that combat lukewarmness right we you know we don't we're not immune every Spirit In This World we're not immune from we don't get a free pass from lukewarmness remember the world may be in lady osia we may not be in ladio Sierra in that sense but that spirit will still try and come into our lives and make us lukewarm formal and Powerless but when we realize where we come from all the lukewarmness should go away when we realized that actually we met the king of that City and the reason we met him is because we have a place in that City Hallelujah amen I'm just going to read this so for the reading but we're just going to read this this is from the church age book Revelations two and four nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love to understand this you must realize the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message to the entire age which lasts about 120 years its message centers to all generations in that span now say it's also to this generation right now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only see the fires fading in the next and the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth generation there's no Vista whatsoever of that original flame then God lights the fire again in the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there's any truth to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly born-again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but they've taken a denominational name they're now Baptist Smiths Etc that's exactly what they are too they're not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together by the will of man now I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for the reaching out and the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God has cooled off and become a bit formal that's just what has happened back there to the Ephesians they are getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them what so the things the world started to get a hold of them and they are more careful about those things well what does that guy think about me that guy who part never made again in your life what does she think about me oh I like that guy like you know to have a crush is all perfectly normal but don't let a crush rule your life you know some random person on the street you may never know that person again are you with me as I told you you know there was a guy in my dorm you know uh there at boarding school he wasn't my friend he didn't like me but he's one of the rich kids so I started trying to dress like him to try and act like him he wasn't my friend we're not in touch anymore it didn't do me any good but I was trying to live before people I thought it was cool I think the Lord Jesus is the coolest man out we should live before him I trust you don't mind me saying it that way but you know we shouldn't be caught up see we should be more we should actually be more careful about What God Says About Us then what the world says about us I mean that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway it was the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get lacks at what Ephesus means relax drifting amen you see this is and and the cycle has never failed we're not immune from the cycle right sure I said we're in the bride's Revival all these things but it can be greater than what it is and we can be caught up in a cycle of Revival and death but God has called us higher we don't belong in this world we belong in glory right our identity is in heaven amen not upon the Earth says what you say well this is not a very nice picture you're painting we don't belong here okay our affection should be on the things above amen we shouldn't be starting to do things that we didn't do initially that we stopped doing we shouldn't go back into those things they see a lukewarmness will try and come in and drag us back to those things but we're above a lukewarms first right it is not our portion it's not our inheritance amen we are not ordained to be we may be in a lukewarm condition from time to time but God's very good at getting us out of it right but we gotta really think back when God really moved in power I think of Camp often when when when Elizabeth received the Holy Ghost and then the camp in um Canada you know you just there's a time we just God steps into the place sure the atmosphere is blessed and it feels one of us when that when you see that being come in come down like that you know God himself we all know what you're talking about amen you all need I don't know you all knew where you were in the building when that happened to Elizabeth you may not know now it's happening at the time but amen that's God stepped in God filled with the Holy Ghost I said Lord I want to have those moments amen way Lord you can step down like that you say well we need to go to camp for that no you can have that in your car you can have that in your kitchen you can have that in your bed you can have that brushing your teeth yes I mean because God is God hate you we can have it here today in church amen whether God creates where we create an atmosphere that God steps down to it whenever he wants and does whatever he wants to do amen you see he said now if we think it because why does God do that because he's telling you you belong with me you belong with me that's why he anoints that's why he fills with the Holy Ghost that's why okay let's just do one thing right now whatever your fate battling leave it at the door whatever the trial you're through right now forget about it just put it to one side God will take care of it right you say it's such a big mountain it'll become a plane in front of you don't worry about that thing okay don't let it consume you see we can be so burdened down by things we cannot fix but that's when God can step in we are not made to fix the world if man could fix every problem we'd have a peace we'd have a millennium right now but man cannot fix any problem even redeem man we cannot fix God as the fiction God is the mender God brings a solution but if we get so vexed and caught up with things you say well how's this going to work out I don't know but God is the fixer God is the mender God brings the answers let's just put all those things to one side because the accuser comes along and says you're facing this and you've got this trouble and this is happening in your family and look at what happened yesterday and look how you reacted to that you shouldn't have reacted that way the accuser comes along but God says I'm not ashamed to call them my son or my daughter and I'm here with them in the challenge in the battle Hallelujah God is not ashamed to call you a brother or sister amen we'll get to that soon you see so don't worry about what's happening in life God will take care of it hasn't he taken care of you thus far has they been faithful and true Abraham is serving Idols God calls them he starts walking amen he has trouble with lot and things he keeps walking he goes He backslides because of pressure how can I oh there's a drought I can't fix the drought what am I going to do goes down to Korea you know throws his wife under the bus to preserve his own skin he's not faithful but God's still faithful amen one of the Kings is going to marry Sarah in the morning brother Brown says he puts on his pajamas you know deals down to pray like he always does and God says you're as good as it did man and the King's like what do you mean he says well that woman you're planning to marry tomorrow is that man's wife and he's my prophet oh amen get him to pray for you and he's like I've done nothing wrong Abraham did all the wrong but just because Abraham did that didn't mean he wasn't God's Prophet no more ABC Abraham wasn't faithful but God stayed faithful Hallelujah Jacob wasn't faithful God stayed faithful Isaac wasn't faithful God stayed faithful amen all of us we can put our name there we weren't faithful but God stayed faithful amen we've run from him we've tried to quit many times we think what's the use of serving him no more but then God steps on the scene saying you're my seed I'll not let you go that way see God's children can go a certain way and then God stops them in their track you say well I've gone in the world I've run away of Bex that I've done all these kind of things but yet God remains faithful Hallelujah so God will if God can save my soul can he look after my finances can he look after my family can he look after my job can he take care of my house or whatever it is if he can save me Hallelujah if he can call me if he can send a word in this end time to get a hold of you and I can't he take care of our Natural Life well I'm facing big problems Believers have big problems all the way down Through the Ages but God stepped on the scene so he says put those things to one let's not worry about those things we're here to worship Our God Amen we're here to have a Revival we're here to say Lord pour yourself in Lord Lord you know what I'm going through but you are faithful amen I don't have to sit there and be all caught up and bound and twisted let the knots undoom I mean let the troubles just go amen why because God is God and he always is faithful he's faithful Hallelujah praise the Lord amen if you've come for healing tonight or this morning that the Holy Ghost get a hold of you amen and you get a hold of it you're going to be you're going to get what you asked for there's no way of keeping you from it you come believing that Jesus Christ saves and there is a saving power gets a hold of you and you get a hold of it you're going to get saved if you believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit gets a hold of you and he'll baptize you and you get a hold of him you won't have to move from your seat he'll fill you with his presence right there where you are just as he did while pity it spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them then heard it something got to hold that means let's talk about the negative before saying you to hold you what about the positive well when God gets a hold of you we say well how does he get a hold of me agree with his word say I choose to believe that yeah the accuser comes along and says they don't believe you don't believe you say you know I choose to believe Faith starts with a decision well I need to feel some great big anointing no it starts with a decision remember faith and doubt operate the gate into the soul and it's really self-will amen so just say Lord I choose to believe your word Hallelujah yeah it's amazing how we can get up get as I've said before caught up with um Earthly problems here is here is Elisha and I think gehazi you know they're there in the city yeah the Assyrians are accountable the syrians are kept all around you know brother Braham says it's like you know they get up in the morning gehazi goes to put out the milk bottles he sees all these um because people used to do that you know milk chocolate go along and who remembers those days right yep those things used to happen they don't happen no more but they used to happen so we had to go put out the milk bottles and you know he gets the matter out of his eyes because he hasn't had his third coffee in the morning and you know he he looks across the plain and it was flat there was nothing there the night before but in the morning there's tents and this Army says this Siege weapons there's all these things and he begins to panic we're stuck we're done they're going to take the city they're going to Massacre us it's all over and then Elisha you know he just you know because gehazi gets in a panic runs into your master don't you know what's going to happen to us they're all around us we're surrounded we can't get out what are we going to do with or what if we try this maybe we get a horse maybe we do this and try and work it may we pay them and you know you know because a million things go through your mind trying to bring an answer and Elisha just says no it's okay any Praises Lord open his eyes open his eyes he didn't pray Lord bring your armies down he said Lord open his eyes why because the armies of Heaven were already there and that unseen realm they were surrounding the city they are surrounding the prophet they were his security detail yeah Glory that they were already there but but the prophet's prayer opened gehazi's eyes that he would see that they were there I pray God would open our eyes once in a while Amen to see that actually he's here he's with us I'll never leave him nor forsake Thee the angel of the Lord encamps about those who fear Him and delivers them all Hallelujah so he encamps around you wherever you go Hallelujah praise God I like that don't you I mean so so now gehazi was more shocked with I think it's gehazi he is more shocked with the armies of Heaven than he was the enemy against them Hallelujah but you see if we could just be gripped by that Eternal Realm like he did he was grip imagine seeing that that'd be awesome that'd be the shock of your life to see all of that there you know and it was already didn't come down it was already there basically he was Heaven got a hold of him by that now if we could just get let the word get a hold of us in the same manner I believe nothing will move us nothing will really trouble us anymore we realize actually actually God's on my side God's here God's for us if God is for us who can be against us Hallelujah you see now the Apostle Paul would say that his desire though not as I have already obtained neither were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that which is which that for which also I'm apprehend of Christ Jesus apprehended of Christ Jesus he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do this is one thing he does forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth unto those which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so he's basically saying I've been apprehended God apprehended me on the road to Damascus I had my plans I had my ideas my ambitions but then God interrupted those plans and got a hold of my life so now the thing that's got a hold of me I'm trying to get a hold of it holy so you can say heaven reached down and got the Apostle Paul now he's trying to reach up and get a hold of Heaven and I trust that's the same thing with you and I something God something gripped me it wasn't a church it wasn't you know it wasn't even a preacher especially wasn't a preacher it wasn't a minister it wasn't some movement it was God Jesus Christ gripped me and now I'm trying to get a hold of him Hallelujah amen but you see now God does that because he's not ashamed to call us brethren I love this you know every time I see like David's side and sound yo yo yo the plays and things of of of of of the Believers and you see their sins and and their failures and yeah because everything has a ripple effect remember Al what we do affects others older siblings influence younger siblings father you know influences mother and mother influences father and they influence the children then we influence those on our job or our school whoever we are our children see there's influence it's a you know ripple effect there you drop a rock in a pond and all the waves go out yeah right the bigger the stone the bigger the waves but you see so David see see uh See the opening scripture um that I read in Matthew 1 God would attribute his son coming to the Earth through David here was David now just like Abraham Abraham had a lot of spots that he didn't play didn't want Moses to write down but God would have them written down and then we know Moses didn't write the life of David because Moses was of course well and gone truly by the time David turned up but you see David had a lot of failings he his sins were far worse than Saul's sins right but yet God would talk about the sure mercies of David and you know David David wasn't born you know he didn't just you know start crawling and begin to sing the Lord as my shepherd and I've got a hungering you know I long to be in the prince of God see he wasn't perfect to put it that way he didn't have it all together he was a fallen failed human being but he had a longing he would begin to play as harp and after he's anointed by Samuel he said the spirit of God was with him from that day on so he didn't have a longing sorry I'll take that take that bit off the tape okay right he had a longing but he was a man after God's Own Heart that's what made him different he didn't make himself that way God made him that way we see we all have a certain amount of desire desire right for things and like brother and he said if you spread it thin so much there'll only be a little bit for God get the main part of it for the Lord right don't don't let other things get a hold of you let him get a hold of you but you see David David would you know he would he would kill Uriah to take Bathsheba he would number the people he did all kinds of horrible things but yet the Lord said my son is going to come through this man the natural lineage is going to come through this man see that's how much God is not ashamed to call us brethren see let's just read this here thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for that he put uh put all his objection unto him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the capture of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifies and neither Sanctified are all of One for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren you know you're in this verse it's not just talking about the past Believers it's talking about you amen because he that sanctifieth and they who have Sanctified are all of one they're all the same group so when Jesus died on Calvary it wasn't just for the Old Testament Saints and those right there it was for all the sins of the world all the way from Adam down to the end right all the way down through Hallelujah so all those that He sanctifieth they are Sanctified by him but he's not ashamed to call us Brethren see a Brethren is like brother sister how you doing we're part of each other it's not it's not CeCe we're joining us with Christ right so he lifts us out to be joint ears with him so when he calls us Brethren he doesn't put us down on some low pedestal somewhere you're down there I'm up here he says no we're brother and sister I'm not and he says I'm not ashamed to call you that he's not ashamed of any one of us with our Humanity with our failings even with things we may be going through right now that doesn't come into the equation I just like to lift the burden off our shoulders can we do that today amen because we get so caught up in our humanity and our failings God don't look at that amen he's not ashamed to call you a brother or sister he's not ashamed to say you're part of his family he's not ashamed of that Hallelujah I'm glad he's not ashamed of us you know you know he's not ashamed like yo the enemy comes along and he just tries to hide us away yo hope he doesn't see those ones you know just just go go into that room for a little bit you know no no he brings us out I'm proud of you that's actually what he says I'm proud of my children I'm proud of my family I'm not ashamed of any part of my family I'm proud of them all doesn't matter how old or young where they're from I'm proud of them all elujah praise God I'm so glad for that hallelujah amen saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I'll put my trust in him and again behold I am the children which God hath given me for as much then as the children up partake is the Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death where all their lifetimes subject to bondage reverely he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham amen you see see he he wasn't ashamed to be called Abraham is my seed that lineage is my seat you know I'm going to tie myself to the lineage because we know Mary Jesus was created in Mary's womb right amen she Jesus wasn't Jew or Gentile his God made flesh be it God would attribute himself coming to the Earth like that through these kind of people and through Rahab and Tamar and and all these different ones right Bashi but all these different ones God would that's why the lineage is there because God's saying I'm identifying myself with all these Believers down Through the Ages praise God and the reason David was a man after God's Own Heart is because he had a heart for God yes and he is quick to repent he acknowledged he was wrong and he wanted to be right right amen and you see many times we look at our mistakes and we let them beat us down brother Brown would have a it's called a private interview but it's recorded So I'm not sure how that works but he's having an interview with sister Bruce and she comes before brother Brown because she wants to know when she received the Holy Ghost she's believing God will give him a vision and he'll say it was this moment this time this happened now with sister Bruce she's actually in the message multiple times it's not just this one time you go search her out you'll see he says I've and and she says but I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times and brother says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be allotted to you see he took your mistakes your desire and your heart is to serve him who's that this morning amen you see see your desire see he looks at a desire and a real desire will be manifested because a lot of people say they want a lot of things but it's not it's just lip service but if you really want to serve him you'll serve him yeah if you really want to know him he'll meet you I mean if you really want to be part of him he'll bring you in see you're designing your heart as to serve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for you so you could serve him see your mistakes are not looked at not a lot of to you see here's your propitiation see here's your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him and sister Bruce says but I've never had an experience that they've been filled with the Holy Ghost I don't put my foot on sister Bruce here so I've you know I've repeated that next bit see never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost I put my foot on all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce is yes that was your nature it changed once what changed it she said Christ he says there you are sister see that's it so you can be so simple one day she was going this way she had to fall the nature of a human being then something turned her around all she wants to do is serve God and what now God begins to live out of her life what did that that's Christ he says that that was your moment that was your upper room experience that was when God filled you so you can be such a simple thing it says but I've got all these mistakes look at all these things I do wrong but because she wants to serve him those things aren't allotted to her because why he died on Calvary that her mistakes and sins are not allotted to her praise God he died on Calvary that we can serve him it's a good thing you think about that you say how could I serve the Lord well he died on Calvary so I could amen well then I can I'm coming Lord hello I'm going to walk with you Lord how am I going to walk with you Lord I died on Calvary that you could walk with me while I'm walking now Hallelujah Lord I want to talk to you how can I talk to you well I died on Calvary that I can talk to you and you can talk to me Hallelujah maybe I just get happy about simple things but it makes me happy you know so man because you wrestle maybe it's just me right so let's not beat ourselves up anymore but because because remember the devil used our own sincerity against us amen because you because it because the accuser comes along you say well you thought this and you did this and you shouldn't have done that and done that and the and he and he's right but because of the Devil he's wrong because his motive is wrong he doesn't want to he doesn't want to liberate you he just wants to tear you down but you see we've got to realize sure I made down all those things but Jesus but God rich and mercy came on the scene for me and he called me one day and he's walking with me today and I'm going to keep walking with him amen amen his blood is more than enough you think about David here David would be inspired to write a lot of Psalms remember this is the same David that killed took bathshebra in adultery killed her husband tried to cover it up by doing that marrying Bathsheba thought it was all sorted You Can't Hide sin can't hide soon but yeah here he is you think about that he has to live with the memory of what he's done but yet he would write blessed is he whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord and pewterth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no guile when I kept silence my bones waxed all through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moisture has turned into the drought of Summer Silla I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hit I said I will confess my transgression unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin he did a lot of bad we say Lord blessed is the man he's actually saying he's blessed Lord You've forgiven my transgression you've covered my sins my iniquity is not imputed to me God yeah Hallelujah and God said I'm proud to say he's one of mine the accuser can come along look this is your Kinga you said this man was a man after your own heart so the devil try and point out our failures to God you know he says yeah because remember we're made in the image of God amen we have dominion over this earth right as the as the redeemed Sons and Daughters of Adam's Fallen race we have dominion over the devil over everything Jesus conquered we have dominion because he got Dominion for us over it right but then but then the accuser comes along and says to God but God I thought you said they're made in your image I thought you said they've been restored back to the original faith I thought you said you dwell on them look at what they do look at what they do now God doesn't say don't mention them put you in the cupboard somewhere says no no I am not ashamed to call them brethren I'm proud to say yes they are my sons and daughters you know the devil has all these accusations but all those accusations actually fall silent in the court of God because the blood of Jesus Christ annuls takes away all those things Hallelujah amen we're just going to read a couple more and here he is walking in the midst of Those whom he has redeemed even as church and what were those who were redeemed were not many like Paul murderers and corrupters were not many like the dying Thief robbers and Men Killers all trophies of his grace all brought back from the dead all made alive in Christ Jesus the Lord Hallelujah God's not ashamed of any of them he's not ashamed of us praise God amen so I trust we have come to a point in our walk with his there's more we identify more with Heaven than this world and he would say in John 14 this is actually my final slide let not your heart be troubled but you believe in God live also in me in my father's house and many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that Ryan he may be also whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas adlington Lord we know not whether they'll go us and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so he says I in my father's house my father's kingdom are many mansions many houses and we know these are bodies right we're going to dwell in if they're not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am it's not where we are where he is ye may be also see it comes a time when the Lord returns to receive his children back to himself to carry them away praise the Lord what does this message come to do to receive you you say with my failures with my mistakes with my Humanity remember Jesus died on Calvary those things wouldn't be allotted to you you're sin everything anything that will stop you going to the presence of God the blood takes care of Hallelujah so he has come to receive you unto himself and that's why you begin to think about heaven that's why you begin to think about the Rapture that's why you begin to think about meeting him in the air why because you've realized I'm looking for a city whose build and maker is God why because he's come to receive you unto himself to carry you away Hallelujah amen let's have the musicians this morning but I trust you you know you've never felt this homesick before amen I pray the Lord just brought that out just right [Applause] amen
