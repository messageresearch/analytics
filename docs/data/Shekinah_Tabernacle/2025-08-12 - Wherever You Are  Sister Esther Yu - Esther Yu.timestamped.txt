[0:01] [Music]
[0:16] Are you standing
[0:20] at a crossro
[0:24] wondering which road you should take?
[0:31] And you're dreading
[0:35] the decision
[0:38] and a possible
[0:42] mistake.
[0:46] But the will of God won't lead you where
[0:50] the grace of God can't keep you.
[0:54] You will never be out of his care.
[1:02] Remember that the Lord's already there.
[1:08] Wherever you are,
[1:12] wherever you're going,
[1:16] God is right there beside you. Seeing
[1:21] and knowing.
[1:24] Wherever you go, he already knows what
[1:28] lies ahead and what's behind.
[1:32] You'll always find he's never too far
[1:35] from wherever
[1:37] you look.
[1:40] You are waiting
[1:44] to hear thunder
[1:47] and see lightning
[1:50] in the sky.
[1:53] [Music]
[1:55] Oh, but God can
[1:58] work his wonders
[2:02] through a still small voice inside.
[2:10] Just keep listening and learning
[2:13] and continue on your journey
[2:18] following the one who is the way.
[2:25] Oh, he's the only road you need to take.
[2:32] Wherever you are,
[2:36] wherever you're going,
[2:40] God is right there beside you, seeing no
[2:45] way.
[2:47] Wherever you go, he already knows what
[2:51] lies ahead. What's behind
[2:55] you'll always find he's never too far
[2:58] from wherever
[3:00] you are.
[3:03] Wherever you go, he already knows what
[3:07] lies ahead and what's behind.
[3:11] You'll always find he's never too far
[3:14] from wherever
[3:16] you are.
[3:19] You'll always find he's never too far
[3:22] from wherever
[3:25] you are.
[3:28] [Applause]
