rightousness and all these things shall be added unto you hu Hallelujah [Music] want to give you thanks for everything Lord and I want to ask you to please talk to me Lord let me edify your body Lord I ask you this in Jesus Christ name amen amen thank you amen well I think Sundays are for Christians Wednesdays are for Fanatics and probably youth meetings are for crazy people if you come to church you you really love the love the Lord amen so let's open our Bibles in the book of um Luke chapter 12 where um 35 down to 40 amen so the Bible says let your Lo be GED about and your lights burning and ye yourself like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they made open unto him immediately blessed are those servants who the Lord when he cometh shall find waiting verely I said unto you that he shall get himself and make them to sit down to meet and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the Third Watch to find them so blessed are those servants and this now if the good man of the house had know what hour the thief will come he would have watched it and not have suffered his house to be broken through be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when you when you think not amen you can have your SE let the Lord bless his word amen so um it's an honor for me to be here on a Wednesday praise the lord it's had never been easy for me to stand here for some people it look like can be easy for for me it's not but it's always a blessing amen so the thought that I want to speak today it's just like a scrumble egg but from a heart amen so we know as a Christians we are in a war right and against Satan and his demons but it's not a war against flesh in one to another remember cuz we are in the same team amen and our equipment is given by God and is is spiritual to fight Satan and not to fight brother against sister right brother to brother or sister against sister or those kind of conflicts this is not something that I really want to to talk cuz I I'm not the pastor but the Lord put this thought in my mind and I could have preached about another thing but this is the thought that the Lord put in my heart amen and we know as that as we stand together we can win but if we are divided we're just going to fall so as humans this is the way that um the Lord matters right so we have a body and we connect to this world through our senses see smell hear taste and feel right then we have a spirit where a memory reasoning affection imagination and conscious and then we have our soul where can be Faith or doubt amen but there's some things that there are like outside like contentions malice Pride lust Envy Strife hatred fear sickness Temptations ambition Fame honor want trial stress threats necessity and problems so the way that how the devil can attack us it's like if he send one of those missiles and if you don't have your Shield of Faith up it's going to attack you and you're going to get the damage right let's say if the devil put this thought that you're dead is a lame person if the devil put this thought that you're dead he's not a nice guy how are you going to stop it are you do you want to stop it or do you want to get damaged amen you have the word God that said that you should honor your dead right but if if you don't put that Shield that filter you're going to get the damage right for no reason CU you have the shield let's say again what about if you have a brother and one brother doesn't shake your hand one day how are you the bible say that we should forgive one one to another right but what about if we don't have our filter on Boom attack again but this message is not you're going to be short cuz I can't preach for long and you know that it's a prayer meeting anyway what I really wanted to talk today is about an intruder because an intruder is someone that just breaks in he's not invited but somehow just get into you you don't want it probably you don't even know that there but it's there amen um so the definition of an intruder is a a person who intrudes or just break into especially into a building with Criminal Intent he's not there because want to give you a surprise he's a Criminal Intent he he wants something from you amen but there's a difference between a a intruder and a visitor let's say if Leon come to my place he's a visitor I'm not going to take him as Intruder right Liam I'm not going to take my crossbow and try to shoot you Liam cuz you're a visitor and I want you to be at my place right but if you have an intruder you don't want it right amen so here just um kiwis have reported a 18237 KN residential burglaries to the police and the last four years that's an average of one every 12 minutes that's crazy if and I mean like if that's in the natural how much in the spiritual how many thoughts can the devil try can try to put in your mind in one day amen and if we don't have our Shield up we can get the damage right and for no reason we have the word of God but sometimes I mean we can be tired and it's just so easy sometimes to get affected because that's the way that the Lord created us we have emotions we're humans right we can get hit but the last thing that we want is an intruder and I put that picture there CU that snake looks scary right it's big and probably someone has been feeding that snake for a long time amen I he this from a preacher I thought it was from brother Brandon but I talked to Benny and he say it's not if sorry B if you get to a house to your house and you see a snake like that will you go to sleep that night will you put your kids in bed and just turn off the light and go to sleep no way you would go there grab a shotgun or whatever stick and kill the thing and put it outside your house cuz you don't want that creature to live in your house amen but that can happen we are humans and this has been like one of the first sermons of the year I can say like let's beware of these things amen um okay so we know that we can turn on the light amen we have the word of God which is just light it can shine and it can show these things cuz these creatures they like the darkness right but when you turn on the light you can see them but there's some creatures that they hide even more but let's turn on the light right so this sermon could have also be like a called squarters but I don't like that word because it doesn't sound that danger Dangerous as Intruder you know but we talking about just the same thing so the only way to know if that you have one of this quarters of intruders in your life is if you feel that you are losing your joy or your peace something's taken away from you cuz that creature has to be fed amen it can be you are feeling more like anxity or depression or even unbelief and I don't know why I wrote this thing but there was actually a guy called Anthony flu I I have a picture of him he was born in 1923 and he died in 2010 and he became an atheist when he was 15 years old he spent 6 66 years arguing against the existence of God but he changed his mind and he spent his last six years of life saying that there was a God because the universe and life was too complex just just to being like a random thing if cuz there's young people here and I went through this I I tried to call myself a atheist but this guy spent 63 years like writing books talking to people saying that God didn't exist but then he changed his mind so if you're feeling any doubt about the existence of God read his last book I think his last book is called God exist because it's too comp the universe is just way too complex just to don't have a god a Creator amen so how can we identify an intruder right we we spoke already about not having Joy or peace and I wrote here more like to us to bring it to like a practical thing like when you see a redeemed Son of God or when you see a redeemed daughter of of God when I see brother Arman or ID or brother Kuban there just a fish Graham I didn't call you Simon this time uh brother B Mt or whatever Jor first thing that I do is smile cuz you're so precious to me you know we are in the same team but when there is a when there is one of these creatures living in your life then you have start feeling something against a brother or against a sister and you didn't even want to be close to them you feel this thing and it shouldn't be that way cuz we are in the same team right we have the word of God we know how to fight this thing right amen um we know how to get rid of this things being like in the presence of God right and these things they have like a environment that they like this creature doesn't like to come to church you know that right because in this place or on any church that you really worship the name of the Lord he doesn't feel welcome so that creature needs like a environment to feel and and to feel like Pleasant and to grow right right so let's make it uncomfortable for this Creator amen and the word of God can shine and search in our lives and let get rid of everything what not from the Lord amen so I went to the website of the New Zealand Police and I wrote how to prevent braries amen and says that you we have like a alarm system which we have coll at with neighbors we have a fellowship lock the doors that's something that you have to do you have to lock the doors right don't watch things that you shouldn't watch amen have exterior light cuz if a beg sees exterior light probably not not with this guy and I wrote down here a dog dog used to be protected not this tiny little dog that people have now I me talking about a dog amen [Laughter] sorry so um but if you have a dog and if is barking you should trust that dog CU that dog has a better sense of hearing than you right and brother brandham he speak about this um story about a prospector right I really love the story say years ago when they used to have gold out out there in the mountains I read a story many years ago ago it always stuck with me it said there was a prospector went out here somewhere beyond the mountain here and was Pro prospecting for gold and he struck a rich clim and he came back thinking when he got to the city that he will be his travels was all over and he tried to say to tomorrow I'll get in I I'll get in and I will just one day Journey he will be into City and he will have the go and he had big sacks full of it and he had a dog with him not comparing now the dog to the Hol to the Holy Spirit but as I'm making an illustration but this dog through the night the prospector laid upon his bed and he began to think now tomorrow I'll take my go in and I will become just what I always wanted to be always wanted to be a rich man wanted wanted to own fine things and so for and then this dog began to bark and because there was an enemy approaching and he went out there and said shut up and he and the dog and so the dog quieted down and no more that got back in bed bed he started like he was going to sleep and the dog started again just jumping at the chain and he went to the door again and said shut up I want you to know that tomorrow I'm a rich man see that was his U great dream but the dog started barking again and finally he got discouraged and went and got his shotgun and shot the dog and kill kill it he said I won't be no more use for you tomorrow tomorrow I'm a rich man and I will become a rich man tomorrow and he sit the gun down the corner turn his back over the door went to sleep and the man had been following him for days slipped into and killed him and he wasn't a rich man see he stopped that warning buzer that was trying to tell him his life was at how do you pronounce that word it's like a steak steak and brothers and sisters you will never be able don't ever try to Hash the holy calling in your heart see by joining a church by reiding a Creed by belonging to a certain organization there is only one thing that can satisfy the person Jesus Christ as a had panth for the water broke so my soul THS after thee Oh God my soul fears for the Living God see there is something in you that wants to see the moving of God your soul thirs for it it don't stop anything short of that so this perspective thought that he was going to be rich and that's a way that you can think as a young person if you could have just shut up that dog you could have be rich right but let me tell you something like our man said you are not going to be rich and you should never shut that door cuz that door is there I'm not I'm not calling the Holy Spirit a dog but you have that b here then you know when you're doing something wrong you know cuz you have that you how's that a scripture that say that the Lord he was going to write his word in our hearts right that's the way that I always have felt his word has been breathing in my heart amen and I I hope that in yours too amen and as everyone here is a young person says Where withth all shall a young a young man cleanse his way by taking he there according to that word with my whole heart have sought thee oh let me no wonder from thy commands amen we all of us we just want to walk right to the Lord amen cuz we love him and we don't we don't want to lose the Rapture amen the purpose of a Christian person is not missed the Raptor you know there's some churches that the pastor they preach how to put the heat to be cut in the big tribulation hey not here cuz here there's going to be rupture amen there's some Churches there's some people that being anointed to stay here but not us amen amen and as this uh prayer meeting I'm just going to call the musicians here to sing the song um what was the second last song that you've sung Josh amen so just don't don't feed a creature that you that you don't want in your life there's going to be a prayer meeting and we can pray there's an altar here amen and let just sing um this song and then brother B King come up I'm going to turn the meeting to you josi okay amen and God bless you Saints God bless you Jimmy let's just sing the song with before brother Bing comes start
