brother Isaac thank you God bless you all amen praise the Lord great to be here this morning see you all all your smiling faces praise the Lord amen he gives us the victory doesn't he amen so hey praise the Lord so let's just go to Genesis chter 5 verse uh verses 21 to 24 we're just going to read a couple of couple of places here I'm going to see if I can coordinate well we'll see slides and and and scroll notes at the same time let's see if I can do this amen let's see how we go amen so Genesis 5 and 21 and it says here and and Enoch lived 60 and5 years and and begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begat methusa 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so obviously the first 65 years of his life he was doing his own thing and then God interrupted his plans begin to walk with him and then we're just going to read from um John 4 and uh 23 and 24 here I want to um take a subject about walking with the word today and um and slaying or not making league with the gibian ites there's a lot of gibian ites we're going to go through a few today and um so Hallelujah anyway yeah I just I just enjoy I've been chewing over this for a few few weeks and um anyway so John 4:23 but the hour cometh this is our lord Jesus speaking to the woman at the well but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so the Lord if you're here worshiping in spirit and in truth the father God himself sought you out Amen to do that amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning we want to remember amen the mym family they are going to South Africa Wednesday morning so we're going to lift them up in prayer as well but if you have a need you just want to raise your hands to the Lord amen let's let's pray this morning gracious father we can truly say nothing compares to the promise we have in you Lord because you are God that doesn't back up from your word you don't change your mind Lord you don't withdraw Lord you don't retreat you don't say I didn't really mean that but Lord you say you mean it Lord you are a god of your word you are your word father so so thankful that you are the promis keeping God so we pray this morning that you just have your way in this service we want to surrender Our Lives Lord Jesus have your way Lord God may you just flow through US Lord Jesus may you anoint speaker and hearer may have preeminence oh God you see every hand that's raised every need every question every every problem and we're so thankful you are the solution to every problem Lord so may you touch every Heart Like Only You Can dear God and we want to especially remember the mm family Lord Brother Matt Priscilla Lord Tiana and Talia Lord as they make their way to South Africa Wednesday Lord I pray you give them traveling mercies Lord may they have a blessed time there visiting family and Lord everything you'd have them do over there may it be done father may you bring them safely home to us after the trip is done so we commit them into your hands father may your anointing be upon them go with them Lord and those who are not here today Lord I pray you'd be be their abundant portion those who are sick and body Lord May heal them Father those who are traveling whatever anyone may be doing Lord be with them Father we commit our lives and everyone who may be watching as well into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak about and and I will get to gibian nights but you see that you know there's a there's a time here we can read here where Enoch walked with God now we know that Enoch was the seventh from Adam so he was he was a shadow of those in the seventh Church age that will walk with God and will be taken will be not they'll go into a Rapture so he was a shadow of of of us speaking about us in this end time now so Enoch walked with the word now you have to there's a great challenge uh really in every age but in particularly this age where every Divine promise of God has been opened up to us amen where there's not one thing in God's word that has been sealed up saying it's not the season for it but we know that when the mighty Angel descended in Revelations chapter 10 with an open book it wasn't a partially open book it was a completely open book so so the promises of God have been unveiled or unsealed to us in this time because brother Braham would say that the opening of those seal reveals Christ if you just see horse riders look again if you just see tribulation look again because it's the lamb stepping forth I remember the first time I heard the seals I saw horse riders I saw tribulation I saw the Jews and the two witnesses all these things but the next time I heard them I just saw the lamb stepping forth to redeem me amen hallelujah because brother Braham says that you know the the lamb taking the book is the same as Bo's claiming Ruth and restoring her amen so so it's more than just a abstract thing it's actually God taking up people and place them in their predestinated position but you see there's demon powers that want to hinder your walk and I know this is nothing new to any one of us we know the enem is here to hinder us every day and that's his job and he's pretty diligent we'll give him that but we know he's he's not going to win amen you know we know he cannot win because Christ has given us the victory now as as we read here now the the Lord is seeking people to worship Him in spirit and in truth so it's so absolutely essential that that that as we go through this always remember that God is seeking people to worship Him in spirit and in truth but the enemy doesn't want you to worship Him in spirit and in truth he the enemy wants you to make an agreement with him now I don't want you to get in your mind you got to humanly identify all the gibeonites the Lord is the one that reveals the gibeonites okay and remember the fundamental thing especially in this age where it speaks about in the in the in the latery in church age If any man hear my voice let him open the door I'll come in and S with him and he with me so the voice of God has once again spoken in this end time and it's the same voice where the Lord says but he that entereth in by the door is a um Shepherd of the sheep to him that the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice okay so they hear his voice present tense hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadth them out amen so I'm sure you know when the word came your way spoke to your heart there was God Calling You by name walk with me and he putteth forth his own sheep and he goeth before them and the sheep follow him and know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but they will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers so it's the key it's just like in you know with anything if there's a counterfeit there's got to be a genuine right and the genuine was here before the counterfeit like counterfeit money the counterfeit wasn't here first the genuine was here first right so it's the same thing with the genuine word of God genuine Christianity it was here before the devil made the counterfeit amen so we can we can have a consolation I believe especially in this day where he said my sheep know my voice amen so I trust you know the Genuine Voice of God not the counterfeit voice the genuine one amen and my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me amen but there's a lot of other voices in this day especially that will try and confuse you yes now we uh Joshua now I'm just trying to just kind of jump through these things to kind of lay a bit of a foundation but you know Joshua was commanded to take the the people into the promised land and place them in their inheritance and he was commanded you're going to take the whole thing you're not going to have a little bit of it you're going to take every Divine promise and we know that this is the same this history is repeated itself again where we are not just taking part of the land we're not just coming out of the world and being in a Wilderness kind of situation but we're going into the Holy Ghost I mean because every Divine promise lays in the Holy Spirit I mean lays in the word of God now we're not just I trust you've crossed Jordan you've died out to yourself you've been truly Born Again amen now you've crossed Jordan so now there's enemies in that land that will try and stop you there's doubts and unbelief you got to realize that when unbelief or doubt comes into your heart that's not you that's the enemy right you got to realize that because people say well I don't believe what's actually the devil trying to make you agree with him because he believes in an intellectual way but he doesn't believe it can come to pass right so he'll try and put that upon you and say the word's not true for you amen you see that's I'm trying to because what happens is when we are born the devil is the king of our life we are we walk according to the prince of the power of the air is Ephesians chapter 2 and it's the Lord that is so so so the devil's the King on our heart and the and God influences us so then what happens is so so what does that influence your conscience says that's wrong God speaks to your heart you've got to give your life to me you've got to quit those things you've got to you know you you got to surrender your will that's God influencing right but then when you make that full surrender the devil is dethroned the Lord Jesus takes his rightful position and then now it's the devil just influencing right but that's what he'll try and do so but you have to agree with the devil before he can influence you just like you have to agree with the holy spirit before he can take you over right you have to agree with him you say I need the Holy Ghost just agree with the word amen so from your heart say yes Lord that's for me and then what he'll do he'll take you over but you see the devil's a real a real shrewd oh yes he will not come to you in a very obvious way he will not come to you dressed up in priests robes or looking like a voodoo witch doctor or a man in a dress covered in makeup right and say we believe the same Lord Jesus he won't come that way he'll come looking like a Believer talking like a Believer dress like a Believer because he'll sound and then he'll you'll have so much word and quotes that it'll sound like man he really knows what he's talking about he will look very agreeable but the conclusion of what he comes to is not actually what the word starts with there's always a part of this part of that part of here and the conclusion always wrong because we know he did that to Eve the garden he took 99% truth put in a 1% error and brought death to the human race you see it sounded so right but it was so wrong but you see we got to understand that these spirits that the that the Israelites fought against is the same and and previous ages fought against are the same spirits that are here today because we understand that God takes his man but never his Spirit the devil takes his man but never the spirit just kind of lives on and somebody else just keeps coming back like the Holy Spirit see now they both live today now he preaches in Grand Prairie that's why he says this they both live in Grand Prairie you know sure they are both Spirits wherever men are gathered together you find both Spirits so I could say they both live today they live in STS Valley amen they both ever so so these two Spirits the the Rel religious spirit and the Holy Spirit they are still here they haven't gone anywhere they're still upon the Earth so both will sound well the holy spirit will speak the word the complete word the the religious spirit will give part of the word but sounds so true and you see now but you see the problem is with this is is when the when a religious spirit comes in it can sound so right and that's why people give it time of day like you look at this here in Acts chap 15 and and so so this is where because we we understand the book of Acts in the start there was a day of Pentecost people were completely Born Into The Kingdom they weren't just attach themselves to the church and you know but but then it came to a point where where the church begin to fall from that position of complete abandonment to the love and to the word of God and it began to fall that when finally when John writes to the the Ephesian age he says you know but but this one thing thou Hast you know I mean against you you have left your first love so when John was given the Book of Revelation there this is years after acts 15 the the age had already fallen from where it started at Pentecost but we know we have come back Amen to a book of Acts before the fall but you see these spirits will still try and come in yeah see look at this and certain men came down from Judea taught the Brethren said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them so they had argument cuz because they realize these men are wrong right they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question why was this question even having weight because these men were claiming to be Believers if they were just I know people who worship Zeus or Mercury or I don't know some Roman god they wouldn't even care about these people if these people were just Jews who are still in the synagogue saying we're under the blood of bulls and goats they they wouldn't have taken this question to Jerusalem but you see these were people professing to be Believers but bringing in a previous age and even look at this here in verse 5 but there rose up certain sect of the Pharisees which believ saying this it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses these Pharisees weren't Believers they're still Pharisees claiming Jesus Christ because if they were truly Born Into The Kingdom they wouldn't be have any Pharisee way anymore like the Apostle Paul didn't try and bring in Pharisees them he said said I was a Pharisee the Pharisees but God rich in mercy found me he burned that religious spirit out of me his holy spirit lives in me and we're free from the law but you see you see the reason why this argument even went on is because it wasn't dressed up like a rabbi wasn't dressed up like the high priest wasn't dressed up like the Sanhedrin it was people professing to be Believers what is it now it's a gide gibeonite spirit coming among the people cuz it looks so harmless but yet it's big problem amen you see now what happens is is the enemy loves to attack the word yes we're just going to go through some things we'll get to the gites and these things yeah so so Satan and Eden when he first come to these um um um to these attack to attack a person knowing the children of God was fortified with his word with his word Satan attacked the word say he never attacked the being he attacked the word first and he did this by he taking reasonings and he attacked the word that's how you can because you think how can the word be attacked while it's by reasoning reasoning it away that's why when the devil puts questions in your mind why did this happen how did you know all these questions is HST the wheel of questioning you got to realize that's a gibian spirit trying to get you to agree with him that he wants to hinder your walk but I say kill the thing move on with God it's just a speed bump just run it over I remember in Papa New Guinea there'd be people at night on the road trying to stop you driving you just speed up and drive on you're not stopping they have to get out of the way because if you stop they're going to rob you they're going to shoot you they're going to do whatever so you just speed up and you just keep going that should be the same thing in the spiritual with the devil speed up and keep going don't give him any time don't give him any attention okay keep driving amen he shook and he shook Eve off the path that's right by reasoning human reasonings see and it's such a challenge today we cannot give ourselves to reasoning but we want to but you see the Devil comes in just like these Pharisees and ones it seems so legitimate but yet what is it bringing bringing death it's trying to bind the people up trying to stop them walking and see gibba where they were in the Pro they were living in the promised land this inhabitants of gibian yeah they should have been wiped out they had no right to be there cuz God told Moses and Joshua the whole land is yours don't put up with these Spirits don't put up with these problems you drive this thing out it's going to be a hindrance to your life but you see they were they were that you know they were clever he said um they did work wiely and went and made as it were they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old rent and bound up yes and old shoes and clothed them with um cloth them upon their feet and all garments upon them and all the bread of their Provisions was dry and moldy and they went to Joshua unto the camp of Gilgo and said unto him and to the men of Israel we come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us so basically we've come from a long way away we've come from a long time ago see these Spirits are still the spirits that fought the lutherans and fought the methodists and fought the pilgrim Holiness and the and the Baptist the you the genuine move of God in those days those spirits still try and come in here right so these gibit say we've come from a long time ago we're harmless we're not here in your way we're not going to bother you you know and it seems so reasonable these people want to be in Alliance with us everyone we've come against wants to fight us there's no one who wants to be on our side they're not even in the land it seems fine this was this was a few Church ages ago we don't need to worry about this kind of thing coming in but you see what happened see their wine bottles were old rent and bound up see and this is so so so what happened is is is is we know wine bottles in the Bible are not glass bottles they are wine skins they are they are human skin I mean not human skin animal skin that would be kind of nasty you know cannibals no let's just leave them alone but but it's animal that's been made into a bottle right and then but but we know leather must be must keep you got to keep oiling it otherwise it cracks and it breaks right so when so when you put a new wine is is still got life in it it ferments okay so when you put a new wine into an old bottle like Jesus says the bottle can't move with the wine so it just rinse and then everything's lost yeah it's the same thing with the believer doesn't have the Holy Ghost they can't contain the new wine amen they say the days of Miracles are passed that's not right my church believes this and their wine skin bursts so they had they had old wine balls old rent and bound up now this word bound it means to be afflicted it means to be oppressed shut up to be in a straight you know to be distressed to be B um besieged so so they had bound so this Spirit had so bound these people up they couldn't even move one they were they had already been rent there no holy ghost moving in it anymore and you'll see you take you take gibit spirits and coming amongst the message what happens it Grieves the Holy Spirit Away God doesn't move in power anymore there's no reality of the word it's just a theory and just going through a formality but I'm against that today I'm for God moving I'm for the Holy Spirit moving I'm for Liberty I'm for reality I'm for the power of God I'm for the word putting on flesh that's what I'm contending for the faith wants to live it to the Saints amen so I'm not here to bind up all wine skins no this is not why we're here no but we want the Holy Spirit to come into our lives that we can move with the stimulation life of the word can move and make room and we can grow and praise God and Shout amen but you see that's the problem as Spirits coming and try and hold people back like this and their bread of their provision was dry and moldy sure it was fresh when it came in that age but now it's old moldy stale throt BR it's no good moldy bread okay no good it was okay in that age it's not okay today and so people try and bring in things from previous ages like the Pharisees moldy stinking rotten food amen but it seemed so harmless because it seemed like a far away thing but you see the devil is clever one he makes it look harmless but two he studies your response based on your makeup and now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word now Satan studied that all out so the perfect till when he come to Eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her and that was to reason with the word now you never want to reason with the word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out now you cannot figure out God so God is the word and it's just made to believe that's our strength just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of a ground will produce its kind you just take the word so the enemy studies your strategy with the word and our approach to the word is really based on our temperament some people love details they'll go through all the detail that's fine some people aren't detailed people they're not worried about details they say yeah amen and walk on those things are fine right but but the enemy will study your your strategy with the word how do you take the word how do you read it see we're not Catholics here where it's just the minister that gives it and then we just come back again no you've got to study the word yourself you've got to get into the scripture into the quotes yourself and pray and seek God you got to you know this is not two meals a week come on now this should be three meals a day enjoy the word you're praying praise the Lord you hear a scripture you know just just absorb the word just enjoy it amen let God reveal himself to you amen so you see the see the enemy wants to get us off the path now and then if he becomes see this person that cented on Christ if he's just a little bit nervous or emotional if you don't watch that individual he will Drift Off to this side into fanaticism and he will become a regular just with every Wind Blows there he goes everywhere the rattle comes why he will take after that gibbi andite will come in and we try based on that person's temperament will take them off into one way if someone's see there's nothing wrong some people are naturally just a little bit nervous brother I'm said he had a nervous temperament he was made that way some of us are more emotional that's okay there's nothing wrong with being emotional nothing even wrong with being a little bit nervous but don't let the devil take you a GI not come and you agree with it and you run off to everything that just rattles looking for the new best thing no stay with the word of God and God will reveal himself in his word sir amen see but then it's also the other side men usually when they're born in the kingdom of God his face set straight towards Calvary now if he's just a little bit emotional he'll go off on fanaticism if you just uh if he's just a little bit his shrewd education he'll get so starchy that he sits over on on this side that's right but the True Church of the Living God goes right down the center of the highway preaching a sane solid gospel calling from both sides amen that's what we need today a church that he wouldn't be ashamed of for anyone to come into amen I want to be have a church that Jesus would not be ashamed for people to walk on the door but Jesus would be proud would be happy oh I'm so glad there's a lighthouse I'm so glad there's a group of people that have surrendered to me amen where I can I can bring people in and they can find rest for their souls hallelujah amen see amen that's what we want amen it's perfectly governed by the Holy Spirit no fanaticism no stue just a good worm warm Church filled with God's spirit what's that the good solid gospel teaching pastors that's what we need amen God help us to have it God wants us to have it I believe it so he doesn't want us to go off in starchiness he doesn't want us to go off in fanaticism he wants us down the middle a good solid warm Church where the love of God has shed Upon Our Hearts I mean but you see you see we start off centered towards Calvary but the devil will send gibeonites to hinder our walk based on our temperament see some of us are actually naturally lean towards a legalistic way right based on our makeup so he'll send a gibon night Spirit to pull someone towards legalism some of us are more of a liberal Spirit liberal kind of nature say he'll bring a religious spirit in that draws us that way amen so but but then what happens you stay there you don't it just hinders your walk the joy you once have is gone and what's happened well it's a gibeonite spirit that you've made league with you can break agreements with the devil anytime amen hallelujah so praise the Lord so we don't want to go off on one side or the other but you see either those things being starchy being being intellectual or going off into emotionalism both those things you can base in the a part of the word so it can come across sounding so right like we've been restored to the book of Acts Pentecostal church we should be shouting and speaking tongues and running the aisle amen but if it's God doing it amen that's that's all in order oh but we've got this Eagle age anointing where we can see from eternity to Eternity and we can see the whole word of God has come open so we should study into it absolutely but don't just go off on that with no life right don't just go off running around shouting praising God without the word you've got to have both amen and if you truly have the word him you'll get the shouting screaming you'll get the Deep teaching you'll get the whole package I mean cuz remember this you know this this word of God is not just an entree it's not just dessert it's the whole nine yards it's the seven square meal amen it's the whole package because a lot of people especially in the past used to say well if you want the supernatural therefore you don't want the word or if you want the word you don't want the supernatural I don't understand that kind of a logic I want it all I want all that Jesus is all that he is not just part of him I want I want the whole guy I want the whole pack I want the whole word I want to walk remember Enoch walked with God not just part of God all of him so we want to walk with all that he is amen so there is a gibi andite spirit in this land you just look into like brother BR would say you know the you know there's a Church of Christ spirit I don't have quotes but you look into it you know they didn't believe in Divine Healing they didn't even believe in really music in the church you see that in the world today you see that in M message ranks today oh we don't need to be jumping and shouting and banging on the you know having having Lively music who said we shouldn't have that you man I think if we went if a lot of people went back into David's day that they'd say this is all out of order where he's dancing they banging on the tambs and shouting and praising God and it would have been a noisy time yes but it was anointed by it was in it was an order cuz it was surrendered to the Lord amen it wasn't the whole thing cuz brother Ram said you can you can have all the finest music but have a temple like a buz saw you've got a problem right so you know what does it produce what is being produced in the people but you see so so that same spirit that that that um the prophet fought against is still here remember we're not exempt from these things just because we you know some people think well I'm in the message therefore it's like some buffer thing that you know all these things of past ages aren't going to bother us no they will bother you because you're walking in the truth and you we will be tested by every Spirit every Spirit the devil has he's going to fire it at you like you look at the natural Warfare the enemy you know Russia or Ukraine whatever they've got a certain weapon it doesn't work that they try another weapon then that doesn't work so they try another weapon who you know who's you there's always an evolution of warfare so the devil will take one Spirit tried against you that comes back to feated well you know unbelief doesn't work anymore that guy got dethroned well I'm going to bring jealousy in jealousy doesn't work well I'm going to bring being being not contented I'm going to bring a loneliness Spirit then I'm going to bring all these kind of things it's gibit trying to come in and then what happen but but one by one they will turn back to hell in an ambulance well they wouldn't have an ambulance down there but anyway they're going be going back in a body bag right that's how it should be there should be a kill list your testimony should be a bunch of Devils on your trophy cabinet that God has given you victory over all of them right and if you're fighting against one today you got to know that's going to come to an end that battle's going to end but you've got to end it amen you just got to like these gibeonites they could have made legal they could have waited with the Lord and said and God would said no they're they're lying to you they would have been gone amen so this is why we've got to we've got to identify these things now there's a gibeonite spirit in the world today among the believer says we don't need the supernatural we don't need the gifts that's for children we have the word now and then and then they'll and we'll go through this now so so they go to 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity which is divine love I become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing I'm agreeing with this by the way people can know all the Mysteries they can they can put together from from um Faith as a substance 1947 to communion 1965 and not have Divine love oh but they know all Mysteries but where's the life of God see this message came that the life of God will come and Tabernacle human beings once again amen that's the whole purpose of the message that God would dwell in man there be perfect Unity between God and man amen Lord and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long as kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil amen rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never fath but whether there be prophecies they will fail whether there be tongues they shall see whether be knowledge it shall vanish for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away amen now we're going to come to this because a lot of people take that statement say well we have the perfect interpretation of the word so that which perfect has come therefore we don't need the gifts anymore they misrepresent what brother Braham says now this Capstone remember this the ministry of brother Ram is to is to unite the head Christ to the body right that is his whole Ministry just like John the Baptist introduce Jesus Christ to the Believers the first coming right so Elijah will be sent once again to introduce what Jesus Christ the head the word to the body and that int that introduction has already been taken place amen uh Malachi 4 has has has has invited you has joined you right have you become one with the word am that introduction has already happened so so what is this Capstone now see the Capstone is a person even charity you would say well it's the love of God well God is love right it's not just an attribute of God this is God himself coming down into the body of Christ amen so what is this Capstone now the Lutheran under justification the feet raised it like that wisley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms the works and deeds and so forth had to be calvinist so had to be Armenian had to be legalist this is why you see a legalistic Spirit come in among the Believers it's the for age like the Pharisees here in Acts chapter 15 bringing legalism in you've got to do this and you've got to do that no you've got to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ like brother R said about the Philippian jaila many times we tell people what not to do we should tell them what they should do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ believe the word take God out his word and thine and thy house shall be saved amen amen hallelujah amen now we come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone cried what The Headstone crying what Grace Grace pass from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God so he says now we have come to the head so we're not coming it's here am mean the headship is here on the body amen I trust is not going over your head but you know Christ and his bride have become one amen what you should see among you is the living manifestation of Jesus Christ the word put on flesh amen so we have come to this but you see now you see what happens is people will take this and we know that you know we know that this Divine love here this charity should be manifested right by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have loved one for another so it's not just a term it should be lived yes amen there should be such a love between us that it's painful when church is over and we all go home we don't see each other for a few days we should long to see one another like brother R says you know when you you should be here when you know the church doors are going to come open because you're going to see your brethren why cuz we have Lov one for another that's what we should be known by it's a genuine love you know sure we're all different we have you know sharpens Z different personalities and things rubbing and you know things go on but there should be such a love Lord there be should should be and and not a put on but a genuine love a genuine understanding a genuine care it should be so lived it should be it it should really become common not in terms of Tak it for granted but should be so natural that we love one another so much hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen because even you know even with I'm just trying to find where I am here see it says in first John if if if you don't love your brother you're in if you hate your brother you're in darkness even until now so if you even have an ought if you even have a unforgiveness a resentment a jealousy get rid of the thing you don't need it you really don't need to carry that stuff you should carry love and peace and joy Temperance Faith all the virtues of the spirit that the fruit of the spirit you should just be weighed down with the fruit of the spirit not be weighed down with busness resentment all all those things because you see even the Lord Jesus when he but we got to understand when when we forgive when you forgive someone it doesn't mean you don't feel the pain and the hurt from what they've done cuz it's a healing process now comes in when you really forgive someone sure you give over the right to hold it against them there's no grudge go you know it's all gone but he can still feel the pain amen right but what happens now there's a there is a Healing Begins to take place like you even look at here with with our lord Jesus when he said father forgive them they don't know what they do he was still feeling the pain of their physically of the crucifixion and he died of a broken heart so he was feeling those things but he didn't hold what they did against them he had a genuine a genuine forgiveness and I believe it's because he was actually looking at them through his own blood as his blood was running down into his eyes he was looking through his own blood at them saying Lord forgive them and if you can look through at someone through the blood of Jesus Christ you won't hold it against anyone amen but you will you will have a genuine you'll genuinely feel sorry for that person as brother R would say here in the Great Commission then let God go to talking to you this is in prayer and you'll see maybe that where that what that man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man this is real genuine forgiveness you'll feel sorry for that person you will want to see that person saved above all things but will you still feel the pain of what they did you might do will it still but that doesn't mean you haven't forgiven that person right you'll be sympathizing with that brother and you'll get back down to earth and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know he's been what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank sinner amen so the love of God should be our hearts in such a powerful way now let's just I just we'll go here we'll just finish reading 1 Corinthians 13 it says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child though I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now for now we see through a grass a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known and now abideth hope faith charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity so if we're going back to this thought this Gib night spirit will come in and say well that which is when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away with as we read there earlier in 1 Corinthians now and then they will they will take part of this or that because remember a Gibby night spirit will misquote the word won't deny it we just misquote it 1 Corinthians 13 says this now that which is imp perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things have jumping up and down like a kid trying to speak in tongues and all these other things so so it's what is it he's saying these childlike things of trying to manufacture gifts trying to put on the moving of the Holy Spirit those things are now done away with because we don't try like I remember when I was in Pentecostal Church they said just say hallelujah over and over again you'll speak in tongues and I did but you see it's trying to see we're not trying to manufacture gifts I trust I know this may be very obvious I'm probably Captain Obvious today but you know you know you see it's we're not trying but you see what they do is they say then when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication so what they'll giveing I will say is look we have the perfect interpretation that which is in part is done away with and they'll say so therefore the gift's a part we don't need it we just need the word that's not what brother braham's saying he's saying that which is in part being childish is trying to trying to manufacture but see see the devil's shrewd eh he's a shrewd fellow because he doesn't want God to manifest in the group of believers right because he wants to make us cold Lal formal and Powerless amen so we aren't trying we aren't acting like children see children can't talk can't think can't function like an adult they're still growing sure am mean we're not trying to do these things I'm laboring this point because I want you to see I just want this Gibby KN to go away I want it to be dead buried and forgotten amen because because there is a spirit trying to stop God move even even when I first came among believers there was such a fear of of gifts yeah that's right why but to me people are afraid to surrender to God they're afraid to let God move people even afraid to stand up and shout people even afraid to say Amen why is it giving night Spirit saying but we're meant to be reverent do you want to become like a Catholic Church do you want to become like an Anglican Church I'm dead formal thing I had to go to an Anglican Church three times a week at boarding school oh boy there's about as there's no life yeah boring school absolutely and it was very boring oh boy there was no life there nothing spoke to us nothing spoke to there's no life changing God wasn't welcome in the place we don't want to be like that you say oh but it's an order and it's reverent no it becomes dead that's what I saying before someone can be shouting dancing speaking in tongues and if it's God it's an order amen right so we should never ever stand against these things we say Lord may we Just Surrender ourselves that when you do what you want to do when you want to do it here I am yes that's it cuz that's not trying that's just surrendering amen so whatever part so so we do have the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication but we do not like a Gib not Spirit do away with the gifts do away with the Supernatural cuz people say well we have the word what does that even mean he is the word he is a person he's not just look this is just God in print form I don't know why I said just but this is God in print form but the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen so it's easy to quote the dead letter of the word without the spirit and but that kills dead sermons kill people yeah dead churches kill people amen but living sermons bring life a living Church brings life that's why life comes into Camp that's why life comes into the church why because we don't Minister a dead letter just an argument a bunch of quotes and things put together no this is not what we stand for we stand for the spirit of God coming taking the word anointing the people making it live amen amen but you see what we need to do is we just need to relax ourselves and let God live you want to see the supernatural relax don't be all tense don't be all troubled don't worry about the a giut will make you worried do you think when they came they came to Joshua's Camp there would have been a real anxiousness coming to the camp who are these people what's going on this is unexpected what it's a Gibby night Spirit trying to make you troubled don't be troubled just relax and let God do what he wants to do amen amen amen see we are not able Ministers of the New Testament that just give the letter but no it's not the letter but the spirit for the L kth but the spirit giveth life amen this is what we need to amen now the word of God I'm going to go through a few of these if I don't get through them all well we'll pick it up some other time but you see the word of God is God himself amen amen so I'm not just walking with a bunch of message books I'm walking with Christ amen sure I've got them I've got it on my phone I've got them on whatever but we're not just walking with tapes we're walking with God himself amen see see cuz people say well we have the word we don't need the supernatural you say you want the Supernatural and you don't want the word no I want all of it cuz if you have him you have everything amen if you have the giver you have the gifts amen if you have the giver you have Deliverance if you have the giver you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have the giver you have joy you have peace you have love you have every you have the Rapture you have the change of the body amen you have the prodical coming you have everything yes sir amen that's why we must have him and we must make him King hallelujah hallelujah that's what we've got to do see some people think well another gibot will come along and say well we need to line everything up from from Faith as a substance to communion and get it all right trying to have a Revival by being an intellectual Revival they say well this is a word Revival brother Ben this is this is not a Revival of gifts this is a word Revival but you see if it is a word Revival it is Christ coming alive in the people so we have the gifts remember God is a god of addition Luther came with the just shall live by faith then came Wesley he didn't God didn't subtract oh that's not right he built upon justification with sanctification when the B when the true Pentecostals came along with the restoration of the gifts they didn't subtract justification sanctification God added the gifts amen and then this messenger came with the life the god coming down not just anointing but dwelling in a people it's an addition Hallelujah so it's not a taking away amen so people say well we're having a word Revival and we just need to get all the quotes together it's this revival we're in is not an intellectual Revival that's right now I'm not against studying I work in science I've studied right I I believe in studying the quotes studying the scripture be diligent in those things but if you take that as your your everything see people are looking for new things trying to find something new but just by study instead of letting God open it cuz when God reveals it there's always power there like Jesus when he stood he said his Doctrine was came with power it was anointed it was living amen so so there a gibot come along and say we need to line up quote after quote letter by letter and and brother R said well they've been doing that for 2,000 years arguing because he because people said to him if we just get back to the original Greek if we can just understand it in the word It Was Written in then we can get it right he says you'll never do it councelor NAA a big part of that that Council was arguing as Jesus a man or Divine yeah and they're arguing about the Greek arguing about different things those arguments being that intellectual gibi andite has been in the church for 2,000 years it's the time we kick him out and it's time we break that cycle and let God Minister his word amen where it's not this this bride's Revival is not a Revival just an intellectual understanding that's right amen but it's God opening his word what is that revivalist like when the two on the way to emus was sitting around the dinner table with Jesus and he broke the bread there and then their eyes came open and they knew him so when God manifests himself our spiritual eyes should come open what he's done in the past he's doing again cuz he broke the bread to the thousands so they saw that same movement there before his crucifixion and he did the same thing after his resurrection to prove to the people that he is the same yesterday today and forever and what it do it revived them they were walking with the word brokenhearted downcast their world had fallen apart they felt like their hearts were like lid balloons but yet the word was opening himself to them all the time but then when he did something he did before then the rise came over what happened then they had a Revival am me then they had an Awakening amen because they realized because he lives he said because I live you shall live also then they went up to Pentecost they came alive Hallelujah so what so what we need is God to move to demonstrate his word like never before what does it do that should open our spiritual eyes I've heard about this I've read about this someone's test was like this and he's the same today what happens then your eyes come open and you know he is alive he's alive Hallelujah more than an argument but a reality amen more than just putting quotes together but the god of the quotes comes in behind it and manifest it amen more than putting scriptures together but the god of the scripture steps forth out of history and lives Among Us that's what we need friends amen you say Well it happens but it can happen a lot more let's not put a glass ceiling on this thing let's just go right up amen smash the thing and walk amen we're not here just to have an intellectual Revival no we want the word and the spirit the mechanics and the Dynamics amen we know when brother Bram left this gospel worked amen he demonstrated God God took him to show you the power of the blood God took him to show look I'll take a man from a Bootlegger's family misunderstood broken life troubled life poor not welcome anywhere had a black name and all these things and I'm going to transform them by my blood I'm going to live in this man and I'm going to show you what I can do I'll show you my highest achievement where man is restored back where Adam was having dominion over everything and he didn't just do that just to show you and say well that's neat he did that to show you because I can do that with him I'm going to do it with you am mean as I did with the prophet I'll do with the bride I'll raise her up amen that every Spirit must be under her feet amen every enemy must be under her feet Hallelujah that it doesn't matter if it's anxiety put it under your feet if you're feeling stressed troubl don't worry about those things put it under your feet you have fear of tomorrow he'll be in the tomorrow if he's here today he'll be in the tomorrow he'll take care of you you don't need to get worried about anything that's a giving that trying to hinder your walk I say Satan get behind us in the name of Jesus Christ amen don't put up with him amen no we are here we've been awakened H we know in whom we have believed amen we're fully persuaded he's able to keep that which we have delivered unto him against that day what's that he's able to keep our souls I mean he's able to preserve us amen so don't let no gibeonite Spirit come in and put a fear upon you that it doesn't work it works amen this word is exactly the same as it was amen when Jesus spoke it or the prophet spoke it or when the prophet preached it it's the same word yes sir amen it hasn't changed one iot amen but the devil come along just like the Christian Science they say you know Jesus wasn't Divine and it's just Mind Over Matter that's a Gib andite Spirit Jesus was not just a prophet From Galilee that was God made flesh am me Paul said it was the blood of God that was shed wasn't just a we're not saved by Jewish blood Jesus wasn't Jew or Gentile he was God made flesh and it's not mind over matter friends it's not mind over matter that I can just think my way past these things no that's not faith faith is when God drops a revelation in your heart that it's going to happen and you can have walk you can have confidence and walk in that that's why the Rapture is a revelation am mean if God has revealed to you you're going in the Rapture you can walk in confidence you say I'm walking like he walking I mean cuz I saw the end of Enoch's walk was a translation and I'm going in the same thing and this message releases rapturing faith into a people he said well I've got to I've got to build up my faith now God's given you the faith I mean by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can walk in confidence now you don't have to walk in fear and worry is it going to happen no it's rest assured it's going to happen H does that does that mean I just quit and be lazy no you press in with everything within you can you imagine Joshua's confidence he crosses the Jordan he sees Jero how's this going to happen the captain of the host of the Lord comes down God an Angelic form he says I've come to take over this battle can you imagine the confidence that he would have had after that visitation sure he was Moses Minister he saw many Supernatural things under Moses but this was a different age this was a different era they weren't in the desert anymore they were now going into the promised land so he needed more than a god of history and a testimony of yesterday he needed God to lead him from there all the way for the whole campaign amen that's why we can have confidence this word Works amen but the Gib likes to come along and say well yes the days of Miracles were there but they past we live in a different season we don't live in a different season we do not live in a different season you see this brother BR Fought The Same Spirit he said people would come to him and say we don't agree with you because you're trying to you're trying to restore an Apostolic age you're trying to project an Apostolic age to the people an Apostolic age was in the book of Acts where God lived in the people amen signs and wonders were done the word was fulfilled amen it was God leading his people and people try to tell them no those days cease with the apostles so you'd say well what about Paul cuz he wasn't part of the original group and but the Bible says no it continues on that's why I like it where he says here he says I pray thee my brother show me when the apostolic age ceased in the scripture show me where it ceased in the scripture cuz if you can go back in the scripture and you show no this age has never ceased amen it's for as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so when did it cease if God is still calling then the apostolic age is still in session amen and that age is still in session we've got to realize that the same baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm I I contend for this a lot because the danger is if you read in the Book of Judges it comes there's a gener generation that comes and they don't know the Lord amen and so so there's a cycle of Revival under Joshua and the elders after Joshua but then when those who knew Joshua ceased then it says those ones didn't know the Lord then they went to a cycle of idolatry I think to me that's Insanity how on Earth can there are people be that know God and know people that know God and then comes that next Generation they don't know him at all so it comes from a fire of Revival that goes into just a message culture I pray God break that cycle May that never be doesn't matter how old or young we are new in the faith Whatever May there never be a age or or a generation that does not know their God that's just a culture and what we do and a learn by Behavior but may it always be a reality may it always be a Burning Flame in every heart amen that's why I'm very I'm very strong that we must know God in the power of his resurrection there must be a time where he lit your candle how he did it I don't know but there's got to be a change in your life it's got to be a difference something's got to happen hallelujah hallelujah you see because the Gibby not will come along with the first part of this um first part of this quote The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation so it's so it's without sensation so you don't even know you have it come but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did they always leave that off I tell you every woman that gets pregnant there comes a time when they know they're pregnant life begins to grow oh yes it's not like this near like nine months no but life their appetite changes how they walk changes their desires their even the things they like and don't like the food they once like they can't stand in all those things that's just a natural birth going to take place a natural a life has come into them it's changing how they live it should be the same thing with us sure maybe we can't know the day or the second or the hour where God came in but you should be look back in your life and say I was once this way and now I'm this way I mean maybe it was a very simple thing because it can't be without sensation but you see the life of God has come in where this is no longer stories amen it's no longer nice ideas am mean the the message isn't boring amen but the church isn't boring no more but it's a living reality amen and you see that same God come and living your life what's happened as the Holy Ghost has come in and what's happening the person of Christ is performing in you the same works that he did that's what he does amen hallelujah we could spend a bit of time on that but maybe we'll just keep going but you see now there is a there is a gibeonite spirit in the land saying basically just confess that brother Braham was a prophet and you got the Holy Ghost we do not say a sinner's prayer like that that doesn't that doesn't give you any eternal life acknowledging that God sent a prophet the devil acknowledges it he was defeated pray line after prayer line meeting after meeting he knows that that man was a prophet he knows that commission the angel gave him in the cave worked because he was defeated he knows it he believes it he's not our brother it doesn't give him eternal life if he stood here the devil stood here and had to tell the truth he would give you testimony after testimony of when he was cast out when his when his imps were defeated when different Spirits were cast out if he had to tell the truth and and and and if we asked him he said Do you believe he was Malachi 4 hits absolutely absolutely you see Hallelujah but you see now the problem is people come in with this Theory just acknowledge them the word is right and you've got it no you've got to have a fiery experience something's got to happen to you it's got to be like brother ad says like a light it's got to be like a candle you have a perfect candle the wax can be perfect the the wick and everything can be right but it takes a lighting of that candle something's got to happen like I said it could be a small could be a big thing but that candle there's got to be a light come on amen amen and because what is this now this is a Baptist gibeonite Spirit comes in and says you know we receive it when we believe you know the original they would argue with him say Well brother Braham no the original of Acts 19 May would just put that up you know the original is not have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe but it's have but but it says have you received the Holy Ghost when you believed right no the original is since that's right amen because there's always a process because it starts like I was saying where where a person doesn't believe the word is even true right but then God does a work in their heart takes that Stony heart out gives them a heart of Flesh then they believe the word is actually true they haven't had had the new birth yet but they're on their way right but then they can't live with one another fussing fighting trouble they can't even live with themselves and God gives them a new human Spirit I'm in Ezekiel 36 in case you're wondering yes there's a great change but that's not the finished thing but then God himself comes in and dwells within that new spirit then they walk in the word then they are believers amen but people want to say well it's we received it we received the Holy Ghost when we believe because it's without sensation no since you have believed there's got to be there's got to be a time when these things happen but you see now maybe I'll just maybe I'll just finish with this okay so I um I shared a few I shared a few um see give yanites are a problem I'm sure you've identified they're a problem I mean they will try and hinder you don't agree with them keep walking on and and and there's a few more maybe next time amen but you see as I shared a few uh probably a few months ago now about how I had a dream about a youth camp and there was and there was um and so it wasn't the Youth Camp you you guys went to wasn't there but but you know I was there at the youth camp and I don't know if I was a youth or a helper or something but but all the youth were standing in this big circle single single deep and brother Tim was there and he was preaching and he was part of the circle and he was preaching about you must receive your full inheritance you must receive the Holy Ghost it's more than just an intellectual understanding you must receive this full inheritance who wants this full inheritance and and when he was preaching he'd be walking back and forth like this and there's always a gap between him and the campers and so when he would Walk This Way the Gap would just stay there and he walk back this way everyone would move in unison like this and and he was giving an illustration look I'll give you a it's like you know the holy is like a token it's like a it's like a badge or something who wants this badge you held up like a wristband like an entry band thing just as an illustration and I was standing there thinking they won't even they won't even no one will even come up as the illustration and accept this band you know it wasn't it wasn't you know you know like an entry band like a swimming pool or somewhere you know or you got to laugh Lots or whatever depends on what age you are but you know you know what I mean no one would even accept it as an illustration I that's ridiculous so I walked up to him I want my full inheritance you know and then amen and then um I want my full inheritance you know but then there was a bit where there's all these youth in this like this Grand standand playing instruments there was this one one one young lady and her and her dress was the same color as her instrument and she's playing an instrument normally it's just a wooden color it's not color but it was all black and white same patn everything just and she was trying so hard to be noticed and then the Lord said to me the reason for these things is because because it's carnality where where where people like this have not received as the prophet saw a vision of preaching about how how how brother BR saw a saw a vision and he speaks about a blasphemy Blasphemous names also from the vision um from the Lord where brother Braham is standing in the sun preaching and there's this big forested area and people are in the forest and some people are standing in Shadow and and some people are standing in the sunlight and so and a gibon is like a tree that covers you from the sunlight yeah right you got to cut those things all it it hinders your walks he said some people receive the sunlight of the Gospel others were standing behind trees and he said he had two great CL climaxes in his service and then so he said he was preaching way he was preaching so long that people begin to say well I'm hungry and young married couples would walk away in different things and looking for natural food and he said he's just coming to his great big climax saying saying everything I've taught you is in the word of God that was his great big climax all the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the realities of God it's all from the word but but the Lord said you'll have two great climaxes in this message he knew the people would come back again and then he would say that his second great big climax is when the angels of the Lord would come to him and would and would um open the Seven Seals or tell them to go back to Jeffersonville and preach the opening of The Seven Seals now as I said in the start of my service the opening of The Seven Seals brings Christ back into the people am right so in my dream the Lord told me or or someone told me the reason of this carnality is because people have not stayed for the Second Great climax they have not received the baptism of the ghost you see and that's why it's so essential don't just grow up in church amen don't just be part of a group you know him personally amen don't just don't don't just become part of a movement or this is what my parents do now this is what I do but may God become real may he become personal to each and every one of us because if he does become personal amen then what happens is the voice of the shepherd will always speak when a Gibby Knight tries to come right and if you listen to his voice you won't agree with the gibeonite doesn't matter how much that gibeonite will agree with your your first nature like I said some gibeonites come legalistically and people are naturally legalistic they'll naturally gravitate their way they naturally gravitate a liberal way but if you're listening to the voice of the shepherd you'll stay down the middle I mean you won't listen to that gibon not amen if a gibot comes along tries to make you fanatical or deep and Scully and cold and formal you won't listen to those things amen there's also another gibon in the land that says that you've got to you've got to you know you can't just get the Holy Ghost straight away but you've got to mature you need all the virtues of the statute of the perfect man then you receive the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost puts the virtues in you right so it's not it's so it's not a it's not a you know it's not a workspace program where you earn the baptism of the Holy Ghost like the devil had me on this hamster wheel or roller coaster for years said if you're good enough for long enough then you earn it that's not how it works it's not it's not human ability that that that that gives you the promise it's just surrendering to the promise and letting him live amen but if you but a gibon comes along and tries to make you think well you have to earn it we don't have to earn nothing the Lord earned it all believe it receive it surrender to it let him live I mean you say well that's too simple no that's that's the gospel it's not a complicated thing you see see this is what brother bam says and and I will finish here he says now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it's Christ or perish and it is not even Christ and works it is Christ Alone see GI will say it's your it's Christ and your Works see have you done enough have you done this enough no just believe the Lord Jesus Christ it is Christ Alone this age began the years of Armenian ISM now this is the Methodist era that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing nothing but the blood for it sings nothing but the blood and my own conduct now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it's all God let his life be in me let his blood so have I no just afraid I've missed something here let it um let let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and my mouth let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life amen amen so we've got a we got to realize it's a gibeonite because it can come across so seem so right because the devil will use our own sincerity against us are you living right before the Lord is everything fine is all these things all those are genuine questions but what's the hook what's the string attached it will just keep you bound down to your own Humanity as opposed to a that comes in and liberates you from these things Hallelujah so friends let's cancel a lot of contracts amen let's cancel a lot of agreements with these gibeonites okay that's why you say Lord if I've made an agreement with any Spirit that's not of you cuz I want to walk with you and all of you Lord show me so I can cancel the contract I don't want to be legalistic I don't want to be this workspace thing I don't want to you know do all you you be you know agree with anything that's not your word
