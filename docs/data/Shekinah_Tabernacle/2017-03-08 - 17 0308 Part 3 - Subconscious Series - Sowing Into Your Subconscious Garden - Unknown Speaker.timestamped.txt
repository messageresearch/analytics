[23:56] praise the Lord In The Presence of
[23:57] Jehovah
[24:01] sometimes you think you've got questions
[24:03] or things you want to ask the Lord about
[24:05] or things like that and it's interesting
[24:07] that when you get into the presence of
[24:09] God you sometimes you can't find the
[24:11] questions aren't there anymore because
[24:13] it's
[24:14] um when we meet him a lot of the even
[24:16] the questions we have just we wonder why
[24:18] we're even thinking about them in the
[24:19] first
[24:20] place it's we get to a different level
[24:23] of of fellowship and and things that
[24:27] maybe were important is suddenly not
[24:28] important anymore I don't know I
[24:31] sometimes you get to that place you know
[24:34] in that secret place and you I think
[24:36] there was there were things I wanted to
[24:37] ask but they just don't come anymore um
[24:41] but it's a wonderful thing to be in The
[24:43] Presence of Jehovah and to
[24:47] um have the opportunity to fellowship
[24:50] with almighty
[24:52] God it is really the it's it's the
[24:57] climax of our existence really on this
[24:59] in this Mortal
[25:01] realm um and it's it's the whole purpose
[25:04] of why Jesus came to take away our sins
[25:07] and to um break that that wall that was
[25:12] between us so we could come and have
[25:14] fellowship with Jesus Christ in that
[25:16] secret
[25:17] place I I still can't think of something
[25:19] better that we could
[25:21] get you know like like brother B talked
[25:24] about you know if God could give a man
[25:26] something better than a wife he would
[25:28] and this is now a spiritual union if he
[25:30] could if we could get something better
[25:32] than a than a spiritual husband a
[25:34] spiritual connection on that level he
[25:35] would give us something but that's it
[25:37] that's all the other stuff that comes
[25:38] with it is is
[25:41] secondary to it amen let's um let's just
[25:45] sing U let's just sing here as love as
[25:49] um Brother Andy

[31:45] using this verse again because it really
[31:48] encompasses the vision and the
[31:52] desire and the
[31:54] thought amen
[31:58] everyone
[31:59] ready oh sorry I should have said
[32:01] Ephesians 4:
[32:04] 21-23 says if so be that you have heard
[32:06] him who's heard
[32:09] him amen and have been taught by him
[32:13] Hallelujah I don't need to ask but we
[32:15] know we've been taught by Jesus amen
[32:18] hallelujah that you put off concerning
[32:21] the former conversation which is the way
[32:24] of life the manner of Life the the life
[32:27] that you lived the former life that you
[32:29] lived the old man and which is corrupt
[32:33] according to deceitful
[32:34] lusts and be renewed renovated made new
[32:39] made over in the spirit of your mind so
[32:43] now the Bible's talking about the the
[32:46] breath the life of your mind because
[32:49] there's a physical mind and then there's
[32:51] the spirit that drives that mind the
[32:53] spirit that's the life of that mind the
[32:56] breath of that mind the rer of that mind
[32:58] so be renewed in that amen that's a
[33:02] life-changing experience may the Lord
[33:05] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[33:06] word you may have your seats
[33:08] amen um Psalm
[33:11] 101:3 it says and this is about choices
[33:15] that we make you are responsible you are
[33:19] solely responsible for the choices you
[33:22] make because you are a free moral agent
[33:25] you choose amen you choose what you're
[33:28] exposed to sometimes you can't sometimes
[33:31] you're in a supermarket or whatever but
[33:34] as a general and in for the most part of
[33:36] your life you choose what you expose
[33:39] yourself to what light goes in your eyes
[33:43] what light goes in your ears and that
[33:45] sounds funny that light going in your
[33:46] ears but remember information and and a
[33:49] and a message is light words are not
[33:53] just an audible but the message and the
[33:56] concept that that the words carry is
[33:58] light now we want to I want to ask you
[34:02] the the light that you expose your five
[34:05] senses
[34:06] too how dark is that
[34:09] light how dark is it and have you and or
[34:13] is it very is it is it a bright light
[34:15] that's shining from God cuz there's
[34:18] light shining in all around the world
[34:20] there's light coming in through through
[34:22] screens so so so whoever the people that
[34:26] control the media and control the
[34:28] world these things here it's like a
[34:31] little window and light comes through it
[34:34] you choose what light comes through
[34:37] there you choose you choose what light
[34:40] you expose yourself
[34:41] to and so now that's why I highlighted
[34:45] the word the letter
[34:47] I and I put that there because I wanted
[34:50] to put emphasis right there because it's
[34:52] David now and some knew he also had a
[34:56] choice and his choice was and I believe
[34:59] and I trust this is your choice I will
[35:02] set no Wicked thing before mine eyes
[35:05] amen and and you know I David knew that
[35:08] this was a very important thing because
[35:10] David was a man after God's Own Heart I
[35:13] believe I'm standing before people who
[35:15] are after God's Own Heart a people that
[35:18] are hungry for God Desiring God a people
[35:22] that will hear the word and be taught of
[35:25] it and actually continue to grow in that
[35:30] word and have a desire not to set wicked
[35:34] things before their eyes
[35:37] amen and he says I hate the work of them
[35:42] that turn aside it shall not cleave to
[35:46] me doesn't say I hate them but the work
[35:49] of
[35:50] them the energy that they produce the
[35:53] the the thrust of their existence he is
[35:57] not like that because you see now and
[36:00] I'll go into this I will set no Wicked
[36:02] thing before mine
[36:05] eyes if you do if there's things that
[36:08] are going in your eyes that aren't right
[36:10] and things that are going to hurt
[36:12] you they will actually make you turn
[36:15] aside they will they will stare you in
[36:17] the wrong direction they will put things
[36:19] into your mind that you won't even
[36:21] realize that are going in your mind
[36:24] they'll put things in there that will be
[36:26] it might not you might not feel or or
[36:29] experience anything for years to come
[36:31] months weeks days hours whenever when
[36:34] you plant a
[36:36] seed in the fertile ground of your
[36:39] mind it's going to bring a harvest that
[36:42] seed's going to grow something now
[36:46] discern what that seed is discern the
[36:48] seeds that you're exposing yourself to
[36:52] and yes we know that we're in a great
[36:54] battle and the devil can fire all sorts
[36:56] of seeds into our mind as well and that
[37:00] is the spiritual warfare that takes
[37:01] place with negative thoughts that come
[37:04] in because we don't
[37:06] generate anything you cannot imagine
[37:09] anything that you haven't seen before so
[37:12] your imagination is based upon stimuli
[37:15] and things that you've seen in your life
[37:17] and your memory and things that people
[37:18] have told you you try and imagine
[37:20] something that you've never seen before
[37:22] you cannot just the same way you cannot
[37:26] generate
[37:27] or or create a thought a thought is
[37:30] given to you by either good or evil by
[37:33] either God or Satan when you boil it
[37:37] down it might be third fourth fifth
[37:40] sixth level back but if you tie it back
[37:43] if you trace it all the way back to the
[37:44] origin of whatever thought you're
[37:46] thinking you can find it in either good
[37:48] or
[37:53] evil the subconscious mind takes pretty
[37:56] much anything literally and this is why
[37:59] I want to get in I want to get go I want
[38:02] to just cover this subject um of what
[38:05] you expose yourself to be very careful
[38:09] be very Discerning because and maybe it
[38:12] hasn't been known very well but the
[38:16] subconscious mind picks up the most
[38:18] subtle and minute things from the very
[38:21] human nature and the body language and
[38:24] relationships and how humans interact
[38:28] and you up here if you might be watching
[38:30] a movie you might be watching a a TV
[38:33] show you might be reading a book now up
[38:37] here yes definitely you know oh this is
[38:40] fictitious this is not real this is not
[38:41] true and you reason but down in the
[38:45] heart the subconscious does not
[38:47] differentiate between good uh between
[38:49] true and false it takes things literally
[38:53] that's why you are scared from a
[38:55] fictitious horror movie
[38:57] not that we watch horror movies okay I'm
[38:58] just saying this is an example or
[39:02] surprised at a photoshopped picture even
[39:05] though you know they are not real that's
[39:08] why you need your reasoning right but
[39:11] something down here believes what it's
[39:14] seeing and it's producing all sorts of
[39:16] emotions and you can be sitting in a
[39:18] theater now I don't go to movies and I I
[39:21] don't condone them or endorse them at
[39:22] all right but you could be sitting in a
[39:25] theater right and you're watching
[39:27] something and up here you know it's not
[39:28] true but down here it's believing
[39:30] everything it sees and it's reacting to
[39:33] as if it's real and it's it's reliving
[39:36] emotions and it's going through all
[39:37] sorts of adrenaline and things that's
[39:39] going through and it's absorbing that
[39:41] light now how dark is that light what's
[39:45] the message of that director of that
[39:49] story writer what is his motive who is
[39:52] his
[39:54] inspiration who is his inspiration
[39:56] because really there's only like I said
[39:59] before if you boil every inspiration
[40:01] down that there is they are rooted in
[40:04] either good or evil and so can you say
[40:09] that the inspiration behind some story
[40:11] that you're watching before you and that
[40:13] light that's going in and your
[40:14] subconscious reacting to
[40:16] it what who who in did God Inspire that
[40:20] did that come from the word of God is
[40:22] that going to bring Faith is that going
[40:25] to direct you down the middle of the
[40:26] road give you a balance give you a a
[40:29] happy
[40:30] life or is that going to take you and
[40:34] steer your subconscious arai a little
[40:36] bit and it might not happen in one year
[40:39] it might happen way down the
[40:45] Trap you know it says here I said but
[40:48] more importantly this is why we need the
[40:50] Holy Ghost to be supreme leader in our
[40:52] lives to guide our choices and bring
[40:55] divine order to what our 10 senses are
[40:58] telling us 10 senses are see touch feel
[41:03] smell and hear
[41:05] physical and then your spiritual senses
[41:09] conscience affections reasoning
[41:13] imaginations and memory now those 10
[41:16] senses without the holy ghost in your
[41:19] life whatever those 10 senses man the
[41:21] people are going all over the show and
[41:23] things is out of order and people are
[41:25] just reacting to all sorts of things and
[41:27] their spirit is and ruling the roof you
[41:30] could say And the emotions control that
[41:33] person's life because there's no order
[41:36] but when the Holy Ghost comes into a
[41:38] person's heart he brings divine order to
[41:41] that house this is a house you live in a
[41:44] house this is the home it want and for
[41:47] it to be a happy home the your spirit
[41:49] needs to be healthy and your soul needs
[41:52] to have God in it amen because you see
[41:56] God is when God comes in he brings
[41:58] divine order now he will guide your
[42:01] choices and you know when and I can't
[42:04] see anybody that's filled with the Holy
[42:06] Ghost that can sit and watch something
[42:08] and not go and not have a conviction if
[42:10] it's not of God and and not go you know
[42:13] what I don't think this is completely
[42:15] right but I'm going to enjoy it anyway
[42:17] you know and and that's probably a lot
[42:19] of people do that and and and
[42:21] unfortunately what happens is eventually
[42:24] the conscience gets said and it becomes
[42:26] okay that's a deceitful lust that's
[42:29] actually a deceitful lust a lust is
[42:31] deceitful and what that deceit is is
[42:34] people start compromising and they start
[42:36] doing a certain thing that at first they
[42:39] think it's it's not they're not too sure
[42:41] whether it's right and then after a
[42:43] while they're just living in that
[42:45] lifestyle and their subconscious and
[42:47] their spiritual well-being becomes
[42:50] complex it becomes unbalanced their body
[42:53] becomes unbalanced the chemical
[42:55] production inside their body becomes out
[42:57] of balance and all sorts of things can
[42:59] happen and that person has been LED
[43:02] astray but the grace of God has come to
[43:06] speak and when his word comes over the
[43:08] pulpit and people have lived in that the
[43:11] grace of God can come to that Pew and
[43:12] come to that heart and change that
[43:14] person back and and renew their
[43:17] conscience renew it amen be renewed in
[43:21] the spirit of your mind hallelujah it's
[43:24] so important to be renewed in the Spirit
[43:26] of your mind amen hallelujah so tonight
[43:32] session two of the subconscious series
[43:34] sewing into the subconscious Garden amen
[43:37] it's a garden your mind is a garden your
[43:40] spirit you know your mind is a fertile
[43:42] garden and it's a garden that will
[43:44] receive all sorts of
[43:46] seeds and you choose what seeds you are
[43:49] going to stay in there you can't choose
[43:51] what seeds fly over and what seeds come
[43:54] in because you know you you unless you
[43:56] choose to do stuff that's not right and
[43:58] you choose to go and watch things that
[44:00] aren't good well then you're making a
[44:02] choice there and you know good luck well
[44:06] I shouldn't say luck but you know really
[44:08] if you've chosen to go down that road
[44:10] and chosen to watch those things and do
[44:13] that sort of live that sort of Lifestyle
[44:15] then you'll reap a harvest but if you're
[44:18] living your life and you're walking with
[44:20] the Lord and and you know we have we
[44:22] can't help but be exposed to certain
[44:24] things in our workplaces and going out
[44:25] into the malls and wherever we go you
[44:27] know there is we've got a Satan's Eden
[44:30] upon the Earth and so therefore even
[44:33] though you uh you in your heart you're R
[44:35] and everything and you're walking you
[44:37] are going to be exposed to seeds coming
[44:39] into your mind but you choose what seeds
[44:42] can take root you choose because they'll
[44:46] come in there now you've got to make a
[44:47] discernment there this is actually not a
[44:50] positive thought this is not a positive
[44:52] thought I'm going to reject that thought
[44:54] I'm not going to let that thought Roost
[44:56] yeah I'm not going to let that thought
[44:57] take root because if an evil thought
[45:00] takes root the spirit of that thought
[45:02] the life the the drive behind that will
[45:05] actually start to take root in your life
[45:07] and will actually start to to to to
[45:09] control you because you see if it's not
[45:12] a thought of God it's a thought of the
[45:14] enemy and the enemy is not a gentleman
[45:16] and he will take over like a
[45:19] cancer a cancer in the body now
[45:23] physically speaking a cancer form from a
[45:26] tumor right maybe you can say it's a a
[45:29] benign tumor right and that really is a
[45:32] biological mess inside the body and that
[45:35] mass inside the body is not really your
[45:40] your your part of your body it's a
[45:42] foreign alien part but yet it's
[45:44] parasitic it's living off your the life
[45:46] in your body and yet it's got it hasn't
[45:48] got your life in it really it's
[45:51] parasiting off your life therefore it's
[45:53] this it's this body of fles flesh that
[45:56] has no life in it and yet cuz it's
[45:59] parasitic but now the devil can get a
[46:01] hold of that and put his life in it and
[46:04] when the Devil comes in when he sees
[46:06] someone's got a tumor and he comes and
[46:08] puts his life in that tumor he's the one
[46:10] that drives that tumor to kill the
[46:11] person because he's come into a a he's
[46:14] come into an
[46:16] entity that hasn't got your mind in it
[46:18] hasn't got your life in it so because he
[46:20] if he comes into that then that's what
[46:22] actually drives it that's why you see
[46:24] many stories of cancer and things like
[46:26] that where it you can see it's got this
[46:29] Sinister way to try and take someone's
[46:32] life and it grows from here and it goes
[46:34] into the bloodstream and it it it finds
[46:36] the most easiest simplest way to destroy
[46:39] that home to destroy that body to
[46:41] destroy that house to destroy that
[46:43] person and their family it's an evil
[46:46] spirit in
[46:47] that now that's the same thing with
[46:50] thoughts if the devil can just keep
[46:54] firing a thought at you for years and
[46:56] years maybe just and every now and again
[46:59] he just fires it again he goes around
[47:00] and Cycles fires it again and one day
[47:03] you might catch you while you're down
[47:04] and weak and F and and you start to
[47:07] agree with that that's that's a big
[47:10] problem right then and there if you
[47:12] start to reason with a negative thought
[47:14] from the enemy it can come in like a
[47:17] cancer it can take root and it will take
[47:19] over and it will form a
[47:20] stronghold inside your life and start to
[47:24] rudely approach rudely take over and
[47:27] blind you and do all sorts of things
[47:31] therefore if you know if you really want
[47:33] to walk close to the Lord if you really
[47:36] want to be renewed in the spirit of your
[47:38] mind if you really want to come to a
[47:40] place of perfect
[47:42] Faith discern and make good choices
[47:45] about what you expose yourself to what
[47:48] you expose your family too what go what
[47:51] light goes in these eyes and goes in
[47:54] these ears be
[47:59] Discerning quote um there is a
[48:02] subconscious and a a conscious and a
[48:04] subconscious it's just like if we start
[48:07] overseas and buy ship and there's a man
[48:10] sitting up here he's the one who gives
[48:12] the orders the man goes down in the ship
[48:14] to run the ship here well he do see
[48:18] where he's
[48:21] going but he just takes orders from up
[48:24] above
[48:26] remember the conscious
[48:27] mind it's like the captain in a ship and
[48:31] downstairs in the subconscious is The
[48:34] Crew That's the crew the subconscious
[48:37] runs the ship does all of the engine
[48:40] room and but but doesn't actually have
[48:42] sight of where the vision's going where
[48:45] the ship's going but upstairs the
[48:48] upstairs has the vision upstairs is in
[48:50] the bridge it's got The Radars and it's
[48:52] got all of the the the equipment to lead
[48:55] to to to guide the ship now our
[48:58] conscious mind's equipment is the Holy
[49:00] Ghost that's the that's our GPS that's
[49:03] our God is the Holy Ghost he will lead
[49:06] you and guide you into all truth amen
[49:09] the spirit of truth will come he will
[49:11] teach you he's your radar so when you as
[49:14] the captain in the conscious mind need
[49:16] the Holy Ghost to lead you to be your
[49:20] GPS but down here in the subconscious is
[49:24] dependent upon you
[49:26] is dependent on you to make good choices
[49:28] on what you expose yourself to because
[49:30] those seeds are going to go in there and
[49:32] cause a harvest those seeds are going to
[49:33] go in there and they're going to be a
[49:36] problem and so see now and this is I'll
[49:40] say it plain that the Lord is in the in
[49:43] the in the process of completely
[49:45] cleansing and purifying us from all our
[49:47] secret faults this is the season he's
[49:51] come to take over and do it this is the
[49:54] season it's not like how the season now
[49:56] this is a different season we've got to
[49:58] recognize the season that we're in
[50:01] now this it's a definite season of
[50:04] complete Purity now not about being
[50:07] legalistic and trying all this stuff
[50:10] God's doing it but he's also but you see
[50:12] there is a there is things that he
[50:15] doesn't that he he will speak to us and
[50:17] tell us that are wrong and we have to
[50:21] we've got to actually listen and listen
[50:24] to what the spirit is saying listen to
[50:27] the discernment of the spirit listen to
[50:29] what the spirit is saying to the
[50:31] churches because he's saying things and
[50:34] he'll declare things that will help you
[50:36] make good decisions and will help you in
[50:39] your life and will expose The Works of
[50:42] Satan that you didn't even know was
[50:43] Satan there's a lot of things in this
[50:45] world that we do that we don't realize
[50:48] are wrong you know but God will come and
[50:51] shine his light upon it and he I believe
[50:53] he is and tonight we're going to see
[50:55] some some of these
[50:58] things he doesn't see where he's going
[51:00] but he just takes orders from up above
[51:02] well now he says steer to the left or to
[51:04] the right or give this engine more of
[51:06] and that or whatever it is he just works
[51:08] by
[51:09] orders but way down in the midst of us
[51:12] here in our heart is the subconscious
[51:15] remember this was spoken in the 60s and
[51:17] it takes orders from up here we should
[51:19] send these things to Harvard because
[51:21] these guys are only just discovering
[51:23] this in the world of psychology it's
[51:25] these things a lot of these things some
[51:27] of the stuff is quite U has been around
[51:29] for a while but there's a lot of things
[51:31] in these messages that are only new
[51:33] information to the world of science now
[51:35] up here this conscious comes up to the
[51:37] platform brother Brandon praise the Lord
[51:40] I have faith up here and here because
[51:42] you reason and you know the Bible's true
[51:45] but right down here there in that other
[51:47] little conscience said now you know you
[51:50] haven't see well now if you can if you
[51:55] can get this one and that one in harmony
[51:57] with that one that you see it you want
[52:00] to say yes but it is just down there
[52:04] that little shadow that makes you if you
[52:07] don't deal with this little fellow down
[52:08] there very much well you'll find out he
[52:10] just kindly does the
[52:14] ruling you see so if this fellow after
[52:18] all he's the one who drives the ship you
[52:21] see it so and you see where I'm coming
[52:23] to is it's an important to get both on
[52:26] board you need to get that subconscious
[52:28] on board cuz you know and many of times
[52:31] in myself you come for prayer and you
[52:33] believe with all your heart but
[52:35] something down here just it's like it's
[52:37] antagonistic it's because of years and
[52:39] years of negativity or a negative
[52:41] upbringing or being let down by your
[52:43] parents and they've promised you things
[52:45] over and over again and let you down and
[52:47] humans will let you down but God won't
[52:50] but now it's now you've got to be
[52:52] retrained and you have to retrain down
[52:54] here which learns by repetition it
[52:56] doesn't just learn it in one hit unless
[52:59] there's a a a like a really emotional
[53:02] experience to cause the subconscious to
[53:05] to to to absorb it it will take
[53:07] repetition it will take singing these
[53:09] songs and declaring and sharing your
[53:11] testimony over and over and over again
[53:13] until down here it actually starts to
[53:15] believe it and that is for your safety
[53:19] that it doesn't just pick up everything
[53:21] and anything that it sees God's I
[53:23] believe God made that for us safety
[53:25] otherwise every little concept that
[53:27] comes our way we would just follow it
[53:31] but it's what we expose ourselves to on
[53:33] a regular basis and what we speak and
[53:36] what we think on a regular basis is what
[53:38] forms our values and beliefs
[53:41] downstairs now if you've got the Holy
[53:44] Ghost then the word of God has been is
[53:47] living in you and his ideas that's what
[53:50] you need to declare that's what you need
[53:52] to sing that's what you need to testify
[53:54] that's what you need to to live out so
[53:57] that down there it starts to believe it
[53:59] and you can start walking in perfect
[54:00] Faith perfect Faith your subconscious is
[54:04] the only thing that's holding you back
[54:06] from perfect Faith it's the thing
[54:08] downstairs that's keeping you in trouble
[54:10] it's stopping you and holding you
[54:12] back because it's been taught by you the
[54:15] wrong ways and many things that have
[54:17] been sewn down in there the tears that
[54:20] the devil the enemy sewed into your life
[54:23] but as I said just before
[54:25] this is the season that every single one
[54:28] is going to be exposed and every stone
[54:30] unturned amen amen place your faith in
[54:34] that fact that God he which is perfect
[54:37] is come hallelujah amen and that which
[54:40] is inart shall be done away and he which
[54:42] is perfect will shine his light upon all
[54:44] these things and bring all these things
[54:47] and and and ultimately he is the
[54:49] abolisher of death he's the one that's
[54:52] going to just abolish death out of your
[54:54] life and you won't even die you'll take
[54:55] a Rapture he's the one he is here the
[54:59] very personal Ministry of Jesus Christ
[55:01] in this end time to undo all your secret
[55:04] faults and everything that's
[55:06] hindering so don't be overburdened by
[55:08] the things I'm saying trying to do all
[55:11] these things to make it all happen he's
[55:12] doing it
[55:14] hallelujah
[55:20] hallelujah you don't deal with this
[55:22] little fellow down here very much you'll
[55:23] find out he just kindly does the in you
[55:25] see after all he's the one who drives
[55:27] the ship he's the one that does the
[55:29] steering this one might say a lot but
[55:31] this is the guy that does the work down
[55:33] here see and so we just got to get those
[55:36] fellows to agreeing and saying God is
[55:40] right this says up here God is right
[55:43] this says the subconscious God is
[55:46] right and the words and the Soul where
[55:49] the word is says God is right then we
[55:51] move forward you see we got orders every
[55:55] everything there's nothing in your way
[55:56] there's nothing to make you doubt
[56:01] it when the CU the word of God is in
[56:04] your soul your soul is sealed it
[56:06] believes it will never doubt and it
[56:08] cannot doubt brother brandom said the
[56:10] soul of the Bride cannot doubt the word
[56:14] I'm
[56:16] paraphrasing so the soul is sealed it's
[56:18] fine and and and really when you get
[56:21] born again it places you in dominion and
[56:23] gives you authority over all of your the
[56:25] rest of you the rest of your faculties
[56:27] and and absolute authority over all
[56:29] demon power amen all demon
[56:31] power regardless of how you feel
[56:34] regardless of what you feel regardless
[56:36] of how weak you feel you've got
[56:39] Authority but you see now these three
[56:42] that have to be in
[56:44] alignment then when there's nothing to
[56:46] make you doubt it then whatever you say
[56:48] will
[56:49] happen whatever you say if my words
[56:52] abide in you and you abide in my words
[56:54] whatever you are whatever you say will
[56:56] be you see but but there's a season for
[56:59] it to happen and God's timing is
[57:02] impeccable God's timing is perfect he's
[57:04] not going to bring his bride into this
[57:06] perfect utopic condition until she's got
[57:08] the maturity to handle it till she's
[57:10] been through enough fire and trials and
[57:13] and gone gone through the ringer and
[57:15] failed many times until she recognizes
[57:17] that she is nothing and he's everything
[57:19] so that he can actually when it finally
[57:21] comes that that whatever you say happens
[57:24] it'll be the very mind of Christ the
[57:26] maturity is here the character is there
[57:28] the character has been one it's a
[57:30] victory not it's not given to you you've
[57:33] got it's a victory that comes through
[57:35] your life comes through hardship all the
[57:38] there's nothing to make you doubt at all
[57:40] the symptoms you could have you might go
[57:42] back to the hospital in the morning that
[57:44] say well your arm is still stiff your
[57:46] Cancer's still there that wouldn't have
[57:49] one spec of that wouldn't phase you a
[57:52] bit see if that this and this agreed
[57:56] okay yes
[57:58] amen and I know I'm not the only one
[58:00] that has the the there two agrees and
[58:02] one that sort of has a bit of trouble
[58:05] sometimes because I know my personal
[58:07] upbringing was an upbringing of you know
[58:10] negative you know negative and again
[58:12] poor communication from my parents and
[58:14] so unfortunately that image that was
[58:17] lived in front of me for many years is a
[58:21] it's sticky it takes a long time a lot
[58:24] of singing the gospel songs and time in
[58:26] the presence of God and and God dealing
[58:29] in my own life for those things that are
[58:32] engrained down deep to change and we I
[58:35] know we're all in the same boat because
[58:38] if we're not then someone's perfect
[58:40] already who's perfect already I know
[58:42] you're perfect in the blood but you know
[58:44] right here right now you know we're on
[58:46] our journey amen well you yep okay we
[58:50] think of that great St Paul one time
[58:53] landed on a certain Island and when he
[58:55] throwed some wood down a great deadly
[58:57] Beast serpent bit him right through the
[58:59] hand and that Beast was so deadly till
[59:01] if it bit a person they usually drop
[59:03] dead within a minute or two now look a
[59:06] moment Paul looked and seen it this this
[59:09] and that all agreed remember we all know
[59:12] what this this and that is now don't we
[59:14] yeah this this and that so conscious
[59:16] subconscious and soul or the word all
[59:19] agrees when it's all agree so Paul here
[59:23] man godess blessed Paul didn't he he
[59:26] really blessed him he had this you know
[59:29] man uh where are we this this and that
[59:33] all agreed there was not a speck of fear
[59:35] he said they take up serpents and it
[59:37] will not harm them he looked at that
[59:39] deathly bite no
[59:42] fear if you fear then Satan steps in
[59:46] Satan's fear but perfect love cast out
[59:50] all fear I like that word cast out all
[59:52] fear doesn't just tell it to politely
[59:54] leave it cast it away Hallelujah I'm so
[59:57] grateful that it casts it away amen
[1:00:00] there you are this is Paul now I'm God's
[1:00:02] man there hangs the serpent but there's
[1:00:05] not one Speck of feir here here or there
[1:00:08] up there you know see it's all in
[1:00:11] Harmony Harmony and that's where God
[1:00:14] comes when God comes he brings Harmony
[1:00:17] God's come on the scene in Wellington
[1:00:19] he's brought Harmony hallelujah amen
[1:00:23] hallelujah than were so perfectly in
[1:00:25] harmony with God there there and there
[1:00:28] that the first that first church and
[1:00:30] Christian friend until we can get back
[1:00:33] to that now you we can't argue and
[1:00:35] quarrel and fuss with denominations and
[1:00:37] ever get to it denominations won't bring
[1:00:40] us to it it's a perfect love and
[1:00:43] confidence in God Amen just what brings
[1:00:47] it see and we may shout we may speak
[1:00:50] with tongues we may be great teachers of
[1:00:53] theology we may have DDS hanging on to
[1:00:56] us but it will never work until that
[1:00:59] this and this comes in harmony the Inner
[1:01:02] Man
[1:01:05] 1953 now a lot of this stuff is only
[1:01:08] really being discovered in the world of
[1:01:09] science now this we we have front page
[1:01:13] news amen and it's from a a prophetic
[1:01:17] messag amen everything you have need of
[1:01:20] in your journey and to Enlighten your
[1:01:23] understanding of the Bible is in this
[1:01:25] message amen hallelujah even the most
[1:01:29] rudimentary living everyday life stuff
[1:01:32] you don't need 20 steps to be a good dad
[1:01:34] from some psychologist you need the
[1:01:37] message of the hour amen it's all in
[1:01:39] there to to to and and God provided This
[1:01:42] Love Letter to you Amen to to to
[1:01:46] thoroughly turn every stone in your life
[1:01:48] and place you in in perfect Faith you're
[1:01:50] on your road you're it's happening
[1:01:53] you're in the process you're being
[1:01:55] ushered into your Millennial
[1:01:58] condition the beginning of the war give
[1:02:01] me your children now as parents that's
[1:02:05] coming to you now but your parents was
[1:02:08] coming to them and so we're all in it
[1:02:10] whether you're a parent now or you've
[1:02:12] got
[1:02:13] children the this commandment came comes
[1:02:17] to every parent it comes to every parent
[1:02:21] and that commandment comes from Satan
[1:02:23] but it also comes from God God has that
[1:02:26] commandment too but Satan uses this now
[1:02:29] he uses this in a big way especially now
[1:02:33] that the that the radio and television
[1:02:36] Dimension and frequency has been able to
[1:02:38] be channeled into a certain technology
[1:02:40] and placed in every home placed in every
[1:02:42] hand and placed in theaters all over the
[1:02:44] world he's got an absolute
[1:02:49] mechanism to control the culture of
[1:02:53] humanity he really does and he starts
[1:02:56] with the Little Tots that are zero years
[1:03:00] old and there's a satil here and a real
[1:03:04] thing that I'm telling you consciously
[1:03:06] you know you you it's hidden M you get
[1:03:08] things in here and you watch stuff and
[1:03:10] you get distracted but the subconscious
[1:03:12] doesn't miss one iot of information
[1:03:15] that's ever been shown it not one so
[1:03:19] every movie you've ever seen every
[1:03:21] little child program that you watched
[1:03:23] when your parents were out doing
[1:03:25] stuff your subconscious analyzed the
[1:03:28] very minute detail of every little body
[1:03:31] language every micro body language on
[1:03:32] every facial feature everything that
[1:03:35] every human that was on every channel
[1:03:37] that you ever watched and it was
[1:03:38] processing it and it was drinking it in
[1:03:41] it was forming the very image of
[1:03:43] humanity the very image of who they are
[1:03:46] their very person being formed by the
[1:03:50] things that it was watching this is the
[1:03:52] sensitivity of the subconscious
[1:03:54] to give you an understanding the
[1:03:56] conscious mind which up here as a child
[1:03:58] was yeah laughing and giggling whatever
[1:04:00] it was doing but down there that Spirit
[1:04:03] of that mind was absorbing
[1:04:07] everything they call it the theater
[1:04:09] stage of
[1:04:11] Consciousness and in a child from the
[1:04:14] age of zero when they're first born and
[1:04:16] those eyes open that conscious is
[1:04:18] drinking in an image that's lived in
[1:04:20] front of it it's drinking every detail
[1:04:23] because God designed it that way so that
[1:04:25] it would learn how to interact with
[1:04:27] itself with other people with its
[1:04:29] parents how to be a human on a level
[1:04:32] that you don't consciously even try it
[1:04:35] just you just are and you wonder why you
[1:04:38] know there's weird people around and
[1:04:40] then there's normal people and there's
[1:04:42] extreme people it's all to do with that
[1:04:44] first stage of their life that formed
[1:04:47] their
[1:04:49] personality now there's a there's
[1:04:51] there's two forces saying give me your
[1:04:53] children now
[1:04:54] and so we can choose as parents and our
[1:04:57] parents chose for us what we were
[1:05:00] exposed
[1:05:04] to train up a child in the way he should
[1:05:07] go and when he is old he will not depart
[1:05:09] from it your
[1:05:11] choice so in the way he should go and
[1:05:14] who is the way Jesus Christ is the way
[1:05:17] the truth and the life no man shall come
[1:05:19] to the father except by me amen Jesus is
[1:05:23] the
[1:05:25] way and so this is a consolation for the
[1:05:28] believer that in in in love now it
[1:05:31] doesn't mean you just read the Bible to
[1:05:33] your children and command them to do
[1:05:35] this and and and Gru them and beat them
[1:05:37] when they don't this is actually the
[1:05:41] training is a discipleship it's an
[1:05:43] example that's lived in front of them
[1:05:45] amen and it's what you choose by your
[1:05:48] responsible choice now what you expose
[1:05:51] them to what are you exposing your
[1:05:54] children to what are you allowing to go
[1:05:56] into their
[1:05:57] eyes is it from God or is it from Satan
[1:06:00] there's only two you choose what you put
[1:06:02] in your children's eyes is it from the
[1:06:05] Tree of Life or is it from the Tree of
[1:06:06] knowledge of Good and Evil those are the
[1:06:08] only two and yes the tree of knowledge
[1:06:10] of Good and Evil has some good in it but
[1:06:13] it's not going to bring Faith and I'm
[1:06:14] not telling you to just cut it all out
[1:06:17] but there are certainly things that you
[1:06:19] would
[1:06:20] know out of that tree of knowledge of
[1:06:22] Good and Evil which should be cut out
[1:06:25] because remember and never forget this
[1:06:28] the subconscious of those children is
[1:06:30] absorbing the relationship and how those
[1:06:32] humans are interacting on that program
[1:06:35] and it's saying this is how a this is
[1:06:37] how a parent is to me this is how a
[1:06:39] father is and so when they later on in
[1:06:40] life try to approach God they're
[1:06:43] approaching God according to an image
[1:06:44] that Satan showed them on some TV
[1:06:46] program that you put them in front of
[1:06:48] because you're too lazy to to to look
[1:06:51] after them you know and and really
[1:06:55] and I didn't mean to say that but it
[1:06:58] just came out but it might not be always
[1:07:00] that way it might just mean you know
[1:07:02] you've got something important to do and
[1:07:04] of course we all do and I mean I I I put
[1:07:07] my children in front of stuff too so hey
[1:07:10] we're all in it together amen but I do
[1:07:12] choose very wisely Amen to try not to
[1:07:16] because now well even especially now
[1:07:18] because remember these things is just
[1:07:20] new to me as well I'm only just the
[1:07:21] Lord's just opening all this up so you
[1:07:24] know it's it's really being careful
[1:07:27] about those things train up a child
[1:07:29] disciple a Child live a good image in
[1:07:31] front of that child because they are
[1:07:33] they are using that it's and the most
[1:07:36] subtle things to form the person that
[1:07:39] they are and that's going to be the very
[1:07:42] way they approach God and perceive God
[1:07:45] and perceive their wife or their husband
[1:07:47] and their relationships with people yeah
[1:07:50] it's so important Choose Wisely
[1:07:54] all these movies and things like that
[1:07:55] you know they might not seem very bad
[1:07:59] when you watch them on a conscious but
[1:08:01] the subconscious now is picking up every
[1:08:04] little detail and so those people are
[1:08:08] not converted people 90 99% of them
[1:08:12] 99.99% of people that you watch on those
[1:08:14] TV are unconverted and so this body
[1:08:17] language going on in those movies that
[1:08:20] The subconscious is picking up on and
[1:08:22] causing all sorts of lusts and all sorts
[1:08:24] of things that are not right that's
[1:08:27] Computing into the children's mind and
[1:08:29] you watch this stuff is going to come
[1:08:30] out I know it I can I can I know so here
[1:08:34] we are this is just a diagram sorry this
[1:08:36] is quite small I didn't realize how
[1:08:38] small it was going to be but this is the
[1:08:41] the this is
[1:08:43] the a diagram of the baby now that is a
[1:08:45] full grown human but it's meant to be a
[1:08:48] baby 0 to six right
[1:08:51] and if you want to know what that all
[1:08:53] means you can watch the sermon
[1:08:56] before this diagram here I'm not going
[1:08:58] to explain that tonight because there's
[1:09:00] not enough time but the first thing that
[1:09:03] we that that affects the
[1:09:06] child now remember this too and I want
[1:09:09] to just put my disclaimer in here this
[1:09:11] I'm not perfect and I and I'm a human so
[1:09:13] I don't I probably haven't got
[1:09:15] everything in here and you know there's
[1:09:16] probably things that you might even be
[1:09:18] thinking about that I've missed but this
[1:09:19] is I've just done this to give a a basis
[1:09:23] and a foundation or an overview of of
[1:09:25] the thought so here as a baby as a child
[1:09:28] 0 to6 the first and foremost um
[1:09:32] importance is the relationship image the
[1:09:35] image of relationships and that's the
[1:09:37] parent to parent so that child is
[1:09:39] watching how you a husband and wife
[1:09:43] interact how how each one's treating
[1:09:45] each other those things the children are
[1:09:47] watching that on a subconscious level
[1:09:50] yes consciously they can reason out and
[1:09:52] they can see that humans are humans and
[1:09:54] they make mistakes and you know if
[1:09:55] you're honest with your children
[1:09:56] communicate yes daddy made a mistake or
[1:09:58] whatever sorry but the subconscious is
[1:10:00] actually what is learning all the those
[1:10:01] things and it's growing in those things
[1:10:03] and it's absorbing that image so be
[1:10:06] careful how you treat your husband or
[1:10:08] wife in front of your
[1:10:09] children be careful what you say parent
[1:10:13] a child and so the the way the parents
[1:10:16] treated you as a child and the way you
[1:10:18] treat your children as when they grow
[1:10:21] growing up you know that's such an
[1:10:23] important thing it develops the image in
[1:10:25] that child parent to their friends and
[1:10:27] how they react to their friends remember
[1:10:29] it's absorbing information it's
[1:10:31] absorbing relationships is absorbing an
[1:10:33] image now if those parents are Holy
[1:10:36] Ghost filled and they're yielded to the
[1:10:37] spirit and they're walking in the light
[1:10:39] of their
[1:10:40] day those children are going to be
[1:10:43] exposed to the image of Christ they're
[1:10:45] going to be exposed to a wholesome image
[1:10:47] that's going to help them grow up so
[1:10:49] they can tackle things as it comes and
[1:10:51] that they're going to be strong with a
[1:10:53] strong strong uh a contentment and a
[1:10:56] balance in their spirit because it
[1:10:58] hasn't been filled with all sorts of
[1:11:00] junk siblings together or not you with
[1:11:05] your
[1:11:06] friends spiritual image the religious
[1:11:08] influence in the house the family altar
[1:11:11] in the home now I don't just mean
[1:11:12] reading the family altar from brother
[1:11:13] Tim I'm talking about the spiritual
[1:11:16] participation and the the prayer life of
[1:11:19] the family and the and the the whole
[1:11:21] thing the family altar encompass is the
[1:11:23] whole spiritual image in the
[1:11:27] home the sincerity or hypocrisy children
[1:11:31] those subconscious on those children are
[1:11:34] they are picking up they can pick up
[1:11:35] trust me you know and that can that that
[1:11:37] can really affect them so who you are
[1:11:40] here be the same at home you know amen
[1:11:43] and if you're not it's time to get to
[1:11:45] praying it's time to come to the altar
[1:11:48] because if there's two people God
[1:11:50] doesn't want two he wants one he wants a
[1:11:52] person that's wholesome and he wants
[1:11:54] them stable and the same
[1:11:56] everywhere
[1:11:59] Hallelujah God Consciousness or lack of
[1:12:03] you know I David said I put God always
[1:12:06] before me how how God conscious is your
[1:12:09] house as your family do they recognize
[1:12:12] the presence of God as as God in your
[1:12:15] house and you know it and your children
[1:12:16] know that you know it and they know it
[1:12:18] as
[1:12:19] well how God conscious people
[1:12:22] are fears and opinions food choices
[1:12:25] phobias complexes World
[1:12:28] Views media exposure this is a big one
[1:12:31] this one here is probably the you know
[1:12:35] most
[1:12:37] destructive well the relationship if if
[1:12:39] this relationship I mean they're all
[1:12:41] just as important but this one here has
[1:12:43] caused so much destruction and Satan has
[1:12:45] used media to control the world now if
[1:12:48] you expose your children constantly to
[1:12:51] this media and to these games and to all
[1:12:54] these things they are going to be
[1:12:56] controlled by whoever created those
[1:12:58] things and those images are going to go
[1:12:59] to them and they're going to struggle
[1:13:01] maybe not now cuz they're innocent and
[1:13:02] young and happy and what but once the
[1:13:04] Harvest starts growing up and those
[1:13:06] little seeds that were sewing all their
[1:13:08] life is maturing the very Spirit that's
[1:13:11] behind those things will start to become
[1:13:13] an adult and start to control them and
[1:13:15] you'll have a lot of trouble and it's
[1:13:17] going to take a lot of prayer and I
[1:13:18] don't believe we're in a season where
[1:13:20] there's a lot of time for 20 years of
[1:13:22] sanctification to take place
[1:13:23] but it's go it's time that we actually
[1:13:25] recognize what is right and what is
[1:13:27] wrong and actually Choose Wisely what
[1:13:30] we're exposed to and what our children
[1:13:32] and family are exposed to amen because
[1:13:35] you know I believe we're right at the
[1:13:37] end I believe there's not there's
[1:13:39] there's only years months whatever the
[1:13:42] Lord could come tomorrow but you know so
[1:13:46] and and it's the same people can say oh
[1:13:49] we all watched movies and look we're all
[1:13:51] okay but you've had 25 years of or 30
[1:13:54] years or 40 Years of God to deal with
[1:13:56] you to get all that junk right out again
[1:13:58] the stuff that was sewing in there and
[1:14:00] the stuff you may be still s in there
[1:14:01] going to continue washing you out and
[1:14:03] cleansing you and helping you and you
[1:14:05] wonder why you're struggling all the
[1:14:07] time what's going in what's entering
[1:14:11] here can you put Jesus on the seat next
[1:14:13] to
[1:14:17] you music TV books images
[1:14:21] movies many
[1:14:24] things
[1:14:26] but this Hollywood
[1:14:28] Disney Disney is not what you think it
[1:14:31] is Disney is pure evil pure evil and
[1:14:36] it's not on a conscious level it's on a
[1:14:38] subliminal and subconscious level Pure
[1:14:42] Evil and you can go and research it
[1:14:44] yourself outside of CHR Christianity
[1:14:47] it's it's exposed computed completely
[1:14:51] and it's not a conspiracy theory it's
[1:14:52] actual reality and it's
[1:14:55] Satan controlling that Hollywood
[1:15:01] movies I won't go into it but books and
[1:15:04] movies are quite different and yet
[1:15:06] there's still Concepts in books but it's
[1:15:07] the image it's the it's the example
[1:15:09] that's that's going in the light that's
[1:15:11] going into the
[1:15:13] eyes that and the passive the passivity
[1:15:16] of the person sitting there and when
[1:15:18] your emotions are going and this is why
[1:15:21] it's so important
[1:15:23] or so I must just nail this because the
[1:15:27] EM the movie creates such emotion and
[1:15:30] it's in that emotional state that the
[1:15:32] seeds of Satan get sewn into your mind
[1:15:34] or into the children's mind because
[1:15:35] they're enjoying it they're loving it
[1:15:38] they're having an exciting time and
[1:15:40] those emotions get stored in the
[1:15:43] subconscious those very emotions and the
[1:15:45] thought and the concept gets carried
[1:15:47] right in very efficiently and so if it's
[1:15:51] repeti especially after repetition after
[1:15:52] repetition ction because remember after
[1:15:55] the age of 0 to 6 that subconscious
[1:15:58] state it actually it draws back and it
[1:16:00] pulls back and it becomes harder to get
[1:16:02] it to the subconscious but if your
[1:16:04] lifestyle and what you always do and
[1:16:06] what you always say and what you always
[1:16:09] think your subconscious will eventually
[1:16:11] become
[1:16:15] that some interesting facts about movies
[1:16:17] what's the time I might not read
[1:16:19] this no I'm not reading it discipline
[1:16:22] Spirit of correction is it benevolent or
[1:16:25] malevolent what's the spirit of it
[1:16:27] what's the what's the motive behind your
[1:16:30] correction abuse and misuse of Authority
[1:16:34] or lack of author of of of of authority
[1:16:37] lack of Direction lack of boundaries you
[1:16:39] know these things there has to be a
[1:16:41] balance in these things communication
[1:16:43] and reasoning and reasoning with your
[1:16:45] children and actually communicating with
[1:16:48] them why these things are and and why
[1:16:50] you do these things not just I said so
[1:16:53] you do
[1:16:54] it they just Rebel humans have got human
[1:16:57] nature amen they've got you've got to
[1:16:59] actually allow them to understand amen
[1:17:02] so important and boundaries boundaries
[1:17:04] are healthy healthy for children healthy
[1:17:07] for
[1:17:08] us
[1:17:15] habits I want to out of all of these
[1:17:18] things I just want to put a magnifying
[1:17:20] glass on the on fear
[1:17:23] there's many others but
[1:17:25] fear it's fear is one of the it's the
[1:17:28] cripples
[1:17:30] faith and so if one thing gets sewn in a
[1:17:34] child's heart from Young is fear phobia
[1:17:37] is scared of this fear of this and and
[1:17:41] and scared of of trying or scared of
[1:17:44] surrendering or it's
[1:17:47] fear is a big issue in people's
[1:17:52] lives
[1:17:53] the worst thing brother brandom says in
[1:17:55] God's way that's been made for us in 52
[1:17:58] the worst thing that the devil can put
[1:18:00] upon you is fear so that's why I chose
[1:18:04] fear to go into because if that's the
[1:18:06] worst thing well man we need to look at
[1:18:09] this if you ever if you even had a
[1:18:12] Cancer and didn't fear and belied God
[1:18:14] would heal you you wouldn't be in too
[1:18:15] bad a shape God can take care of that if
[1:18:19] you were sick whatever it is if you
[1:18:21] didn't fear so fear is one of the worst
[1:18:23] things that Satan can place upon the
[1:18:26] person so number one problem the
[1:18:28] embedding of fear into the heart of man
[1:18:31] and so I've got the same diagram here
[1:18:33] but here I've circled fears and opinions
[1:18:36] and these things that get sewn into you
[1:18:39] from parent to child parents are very
[1:18:43] good at embedding things into you and
[1:18:45] you probably know all about it things
[1:18:47] that you know that are in your life that
[1:18:49] you know your parents did and you know
[1:18:51] it's not you know and it hasn't helped
[1:18:53] you my mother made me she she man she
[1:18:56] was scared of spiders and scared of all
[1:18:59] these things and and and all these
[1:19:01] different food things she hated it took
[1:19:04] a long time a long time to get over some
[1:19:08] of those things man it's powerful how it
[1:19:10] goes in there just by the little things
[1:19:12] that they say and do so be careful what
[1:19:16] you say you're scared of in front of
[1:19:17] your children be careful of the
[1:19:20] testimony that you testify in front of
[1:19:21] them you know be careful of those things
[1:19:25] be careful of what you say to them don't
[1:19:28] tell them what they're not you might see
[1:19:31] things you tell them who they are you
[1:19:33] tell them who God is how great God is
[1:19:36] how wonderful he is how the provision of
[1:19:39] the Lord amen amen don't tell them how
[1:19:42] wrong and oh you can of course you
[1:19:44] correct them but you know don't don't
[1:19:45] put them down all the time that does
[1:19:48] nothing positive that
[1:19:51] detracts complex negative testimony
[1:19:56] phobias religious influence poor
[1:19:59] teaching you know I mean we can't we
[1:20:02] haven't all come from good religious
[1:20:04] Christian backgrounds and so you know if
[1:20:07] there is a religious influence sometimes
[1:20:09] it's been a cold formal old Tombstone of
[1:20:11] a place that has no Victory or any any
[1:20:15] virtue at all and so it puts a bad image
[1:20:18] in the child like man this stuff is just
[1:20:20] there's nothing to it you know but have
[1:20:23] a
[1:20:23] child and the family altar of your home
[1:20:27] is exposed to the glory of God exposed
[1:20:30] to that presence man you know that's
[1:20:32] something they'll never forget amen
[1:20:35] they'll never forget that you know and
[1:20:37] they may wander on their later
[1:20:40] years but they'll never forget that my
[1:20:43] parents had knew the Living God they
[1:20:45] knew the Living God and and and when
[1:20:47] they're ready and they have their their
[1:20:50] Pig pin experience they know that the
[1:20:52] father's house is Rich amen rich and and
[1:20:56] and spiritual riches
[1:21:03] Hallelujah now I want to show you how it
[1:21:08] works fear is a slave mentality as well
[1:21:12] you see here we have the murmurers in
[1:21:14] the wilderness you see they physically
[1:21:17] came out of
[1:21:18] Egypt but Egypt didn't come out of many
[1:21:21] of them they were physically taken from
[1:21:24] the slave belt and taken from the the
[1:21:27] guy that whipped
[1:21:28] them but the slavery wasn't taken out of
[1:21:31] them that slave mentality wasn't taken
[1:21:33] out of
[1:21:34] them that fear of those task Masters
[1:21:37] that they had over them all their life
[1:21:40] was not taken out of them they were
[1:21:42] taken away from the situation but the
[1:21:45] situation was still functioning very
[1:21:46] real inside their subconscious they
[1:21:49] weren't renewed in the spirit of their
[1:21:51] mind
[1:21:56] numbers 13:
[1:21:58] 25-28 and they returned from searching
[1:22:01] the searching this is when Moses sent
[1:22:03] the 12 Spies out and they came
[1:22:05] back and they returned from searching of
[1:22:08] the land after 40 days and they went and
[1:22:10] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[1:22:12] the congregation of the children of
[1:22:13] Israel unto the Wilderness of pan to
[1:22:16] Cades and brought back word unto them
[1:22:18] and unto all the congregation and showed
[1:22:20] them the fruit of the land and they told
[1:22:22] him and said we came unto the land
[1:22:24] whether thou sent us and surely it
[1:22:26] floweth with milk and honey and it is
[1:22:28] the fruit of it nevertheless the people
[1:22:31] be strong that dwell in the land and the
[1:22:33] cities are walled and very great and
[1:22:36] moreover we saw the children of anch
[1:22:39] there and Caleb steal the people and i'
[1:22:42] I've kind of skipped a little bit I just
[1:22:44] went to
[1:22:45] this they was this is this is how
[1:22:49] incredibly controlling it can be be
[1:22:52] renewed in the spirit of your mind this
[1:22:54] is how controlling it can be they saw
[1:22:58] God do material Miracles creation and
[1:23:00] all sorts of things to parting Seas
[1:23:03] destroying armies they saw it up here in
[1:23:06] the conscious mind all these things that
[1:23:09] took
[1:23:10] place and
[1:23:12] yet here's this temptation that comes to
[1:23:16] them here's this this this this this
[1:23:18] challenge that they face and the same
[1:23:21] old program
[1:23:23] that was down in that subconscious the
[1:23:25] crew in the ship of those
[1:23:27] people it caused a what do they call
[1:23:30] where they what's that thing a mutiny
[1:23:34] those people had a mutiny on their hands
[1:23:37] and they and they rose up against the
[1:23:41] very word of God after all the Miracles
[1:23:44] he did and after all the things that
[1:23:46] they saw the power of the subconscious
[1:23:48] rose up and took
[1:23:51] over complet completely unreasonable
[1:23:54] they were overpowered by the emotions
[1:23:56] that was welling up from within them
[1:23:57] fear fear crippled Faith they didn't mix
[1:24:03] the word that Moses preached and the
[1:24:05] promises and the Very
[1:24:07] Miracles that happened with faith that
[1:24:10] word that was preached fear came up and
[1:24:12] strangled it away fear so you know if
[1:24:17] there's any fear in your life God can
[1:24:18] deal with it right now if there's things
[1:24:20] that have been raised up because of this
[1:24:22] preaching that you know of that in your
[1:24:24] own life it's just one simple prayer
[1:24:27] don't hang on to it amen if there's
[1:24:29] things that you know that you've been
[1:24:30] doing don't hang on to them lay them at
[1:24:33] the altar tonight you don't need to come
[1:24:34] up here your seat is your heart is the
[1:24:37] altar it's not a big complex thing you
[1:24:39] don't have to have rosaries or crawl up
[1:24:41] to some Chapel on your knees you can
[1:24:43] just lay it at the feet of Jesus right
[1:24:45] now anything that comes
[1:24:48] up
[1:24:50] amen and Caleb's I love this because see
[1:24:53] Caleb now something had happened to him
[1:24:56] Hallelujah he didn't let fear take over
[1:24:58] his sin and subconscious amen Faith got
[1:25:02] a hold of the
[1:25:04] word and still the people before Moses
[1:25:07] and said let us go up at once and
[1:25:08] possess it for we are well able to
[1:25:10] overcome it he was speaking God's
[1:25:12] language they were speaking Satan's
[1:25:14] language Hallelujah and so that's what
[1:25:17] your testimony needs to be Caleb and
[1:25:19] Joshua did not say that they are they
[1:25:22] they actually agreed yes it's hard but
[1:25:24] God said this amen that's the thing
[1:25:27] that's the balance that's the balance
[1:25:29] for your testimony you don't need to
[1:25:31] pretend something's not happening and
[1:25:33] then end up sicker you need to share
[1:25:35] testimony of what God has done
[1:25:38] hallelujah and you need to not because
[1:25:40] when you speak down about yourself and
[1:25:42] and doubting this and and you're this
[1:25:44] and they're that negative negative
[1:25:46] negative negative you're speaking the
[1:25:48] devil's
[1:25:48] language but when you
[1:25:51] say we are well able to overcome it
[1:25:55] amen let's go up at once and possess our
[1:25:58] land you're speaking God's language
[1:26:00] that's God's language that's the word of
[1:26:02] God and remember that word if you're
[1:26:04] born again is in you all of it it's all
[1:26:07] in you you're not lying you're not
[1:26:10] sharing something that's a lie you're
[1:26:12] speaking the truth and the truth is
[1:26:13] already in you greater is he that is in
[1:26:16] you than he that is in the world
[1:26:20] oops I push
[1:26:25] something is it going to
[1:26:28] work
[1:26:30] huh did I turn the whole projector
[1:26:34] off
[1:26:45] okay how do you do
[1:26:51] this
[1:26:55] jomb I won't even go to the
[1:26:59] slide oh no I want to stay in the
[1:27:01] wilderness ah thank you
[1:27:05] oh I had to eat my sermon then don't let
[1:27:09] fear rise
[1:27:09] [Laughter]
[1:27:13] up let's go up at once and possess it
[1:27:16] for we are well able to overcome it but
[1:27:18] the men that went up with him said we be
[1:27:19] not able to go up against the people for
[1:27:21] they are stronger than we and they
[1:27:23] brought up an evil report of the land so
[1:27:25] they're speaking evil of the
[1:27:29] word at which they had searched unto the
[1:27:31] children of Israel saying the land
[1:27:33] though through which we have gone to
[1:27:35] search it is a land that eats up the
[1:27:37] inhabitants thereof and all the people
[1:27:39] that we saw in it are men of great
[1:27:41] stature and there we saw the Giants the
[1:27:43] sons of anoch which come of the Giants
[1:27:45] which we were in our own side as
[1:27:46] Grasshoppers and so were we in their
[1:27:48] sight Caleb saw the same thing but
[1:27:50] remember his testimony was different and
[1:27:52] you might be sickness under all sorts of
[1:27:54] things you might be seeing the same
[1:27:56] thing but your testimony can be
[1:27:58] different your testimony can be the word
[1:28:00] hallelujah your song that you sing can
[1:28:03] be positive Hallelujah the thoughts now
[1:28:06] you might just you might have the words
[1:28:07] covered and you might have a good
[1:28:08] testimony out loud but what's the inner
[1:28:10] testimony saying what's being preached
[1:28:13] inside your mind what's being preached
[1:28:15] down here and your
[1:28:17] thoughts that's important just as
[1:28:20] important as what you speak out and let
[1:28:22] what is in here let that be what's
[1:28:25] coming out of here all the time numbers
[1:28:29] 142:4 and all the children of Israel
[1:28:31] murmured against Moses and Aaron against
[1:28:34] Aaron and the whole congregation said
[1:28:36] unto them would God that we had died in
[1:28:39] the land of Egypt or would God we had
[1:28:41] died in this Wilderness and wherefore
[1:28:44] has the Lord brought us unto this land
[1:28:46] to Fall by the sword look at the the the
[1:28:49] power that the fear had upon them to
[1:28:52] doubt the Integrity of God to to
[1:28:55] diminish God from this loving pure
[1:28:59] faithful God to this God that wants to
[1:29:02] kill them and play with them and look at
[1:29:04] the power that fear can take off on a
[1:29:07] person's life it's so important now to
[1:29:11] get it dealt
[1:29:13] with God bless you
[1:29:16] Murdo we'll see you that's all good so
[1:29:22] the power of that fear is that's why you
[1:29:24] know brother Bram said this is the worst
[1:29:26] thing that the devil can put upon a man
[1:29:29] on a person as fair look what it did to
[1:29:32] these people they were scared of their
[1:29:36] circumstance and when they got scared as
[1:29:38] we read before Satan stepped in as soon
[1:29:40] as soon as the faith was
[1:29:42] crippled Satan stepped in and like a
[1:29:46] cancer and just overtook them until
[1:29:48] their very perception of God was
[1:29:50] doubting his integrity they doubted the
[1:29:53] Integrity of God thinking that he would
[1:29:55] do that to them be careful what you
[1:29:59] expose your eyes to and this is not I'm
[1:30:02] not like you know this is people are
[1:30:04] going to listen to this as well so
[1:30:05] that's not I'm not you know this is like
[1:30:08] I'm just
[1:30:09] preaching would God that we had died in
[1:30:12] the land of Egypt or would God we had
[1:30:14] died oh
[1:30:16] here to Fall by the sword that our wives
[1:30:18] and our children should be a prey were
[1:30:20] it not better for us to return into
[1:30:22] Egypt and they said one to another let
[1:30:26] us let us make a
[1:30:30] Captain who was the one that was making
[1:30:32] a
[1:30:33] captain who was the captain God had
[1:30:35] prepared for the for
[1:30:38] Israelites God was meant to be the
[1:30:40] captain God had prepared a captain for
[1:30:43] them and all they needed to do was mix
[1:30:44] it with faith and the captain will
[1:30:46] deliver them from all their enemies take
[1:30:47] them right through all their inheritance
[1:30:49] and they' have everything that God
[1:30:51] promised
[1:30:52] amen and then so before all that now the
[1:30:55] the fear just just rose up and Satan
[1:30:58] took over and now they want to make a
[1:31:00] Captain they want their own Captain
[1:31:02] because fear now Satan is controlling
[1:31:04] them fear can someone what do
[1:31:08] they call it where they just get
[1:31:09] absolutely
[1:31:10] petrified by fear physically and
[1:31:14] spiritually because there's and there's
[1:31:16] a physiological explanation is the
[1:31:19] chemicals in their body as well cuz
[1:31:22] there has to be a physical side of
[1:31:23] everything as well that we go through it
[1:31:25] it their bodies become overwhelmed then
[1:31:28] they become led by their feelings they
[1:31:30] become led by adrenaline and Cortisone
[1:31:33] and all of those chemicals that rise up
[1:31:34] inside the physical
[1:31:36] body so they say let us make a captain
[1:31:39] and let us return to Egypt Let Us return
[1:31:41] back into
[1:31:43] sin
[1:31:44] jobal I won going to spend too long on
[1:31:46] this and jeroboam said in his heart now
[1:31:49] shall the kingdom return to the House of
[1:31:51] David and you all know about jbam he was
[1:31:54] a king right before he was King
[1:31:56] Solomon's kingdom got taken from him
[1:31:58] right and not from him but from his son
[1:32:01] reab and God before as when reab I think
[1:32:05] Solomon was still alive a prophet came
[1:32:08] to Jobo and said so God now says to
[1:32:12] jerob he rents the Garment into 12
[1:32:14] pieces and gives him 10 pieces and he
[1:32:16] says you are going to have 10 tribes God
[1:32:19] is giving you and making you King that
[1:32:22] should be good enough for anybody to
[1:32:24] have the testimony right that should be
[1:32:26] good enough not but beside all that and
[1:32:30] it actually happening it happened and he
[1:32:32] became king and yet he said in his heart
[1:32:36] so now fear comes in and takes over and
[1:32:40] throws the whole nation of Israel into
[1:32:43] idolatry because of fear he said in his
[1:32:46] heart watch what you say in your heart
[1:32:49] watch the testimony that's going on
[1:32:51] inside you and if it's negative you cast
[1:32:55] it down let it become
[1:32:57] positive think positive on positive
[1:33:00] things which is the
[1:33:02] word because otherwise if fear starts to
[1:33:05] rise up it can take you on a journey you
[1:33:07] never wanted to go
[1:33:10] down and the Lord said to
[1:33:13] Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to
[1:33:16] sift you have you that he may sift you
[1:33:19] as wheat but I have prayed for you and
[1:33:21] that thy faith fail not and when you are
[1:33:24] converted strengthen thy Brethren and he
[1:33:26] said unto him Lord I am ready to go with
[1:33:28] thee both into prison and to death up
[1:33:31] here he was up here he was ready up here
[1:33:35] he was very ready he was Peter man he
[1:33:38] was just on fire he would do anything
[1:33:41] for Jesus Hallelujah he was
[1:33:44] enthusiastic but that's not enough amen
[1:33:48] that's not enough down here Jesus
[1:33:52] identify what was going on inside his
[1:33:54] subconscious he was scared Hallelujah he
[1:33:57] was fearful so when it really came to
[1:33:59] the challenge amen when he had to eat
[1:34:02] his
[1:34:03] sermon he really got challenged man he
[1:34:06] got challenged and he
[1:34:08] failed but his faith failed not because
[1:34:10] Jesus prayed it wouldn't so there must
[1:34:12] have been a little flicker somewhere
[1:34:14] there when he when Jesus saw him and he
[1:34:17] wept you know that repentance you know
[1:34:19] the goodness of God LED that to
[1:34:21] repentance and and took him back on back
[1:34:24] onto the track humbled him down which
[1:34:26] probably did needed so that he could die
[1:34:28] to himself you know get the Holy Ghost
[1:34:32] but you should see the two consciouses
[1:34:34] going on there I for time I won't preach
[1:34:37] on it but I want to finish on this
[1:34:39] thought perfect love casts out fear and
[1:34:44] we have known and believed 1 John 4:16
[1:34:47] to19 and we have known and believed the
[1:34:50] love that God has to us God is love and
[1:34:54] he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[1:34:58] hallelujah hello prayer
[1:35:01] people I like that line
[1:35:03] [Laughter]
[1:35:05] bin prayer you know when you're
[1:35:08] fellowshipping with God you're
[1:35:09] fellowshipping with love you are in the
[1:35:12] presence of love if you want to lay
[1:35:15] aside everything and get perfect love
[1:35:17] it's not some complex thing it's
[1:35:19] spending time with the Lord It's
[1:35:20] dwelling in the secret place of the most
[1:35:23] high I'll I'll I'll do atmosphere later
[1:35:26] on in the series where I where I where I
[1:35:29] where I really go into that but for now
[1:35:32] I'll read and God and him here in is our
[1:35:35] love made perfect or complete that we
[1:35:38] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:35:40] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:35:43] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:35:46] love casts out fear because fear has
[1:35:50] torment he that fearth is not made
[1:35:53] perfect in love we love him because he
[1:35:56] first loved us it's Grace Grace Grace
[1:35:59] and all Grace
[1:36:02] amen his love to is already towards us
[1:36:06] we don't have to generate it or try and
[1:36:07] call it down it's there amen
[1:36:12] hallelujah it's the guy it's the crew
[1:36:14] downstairs sometimes that Ste you away
[1:36:16] from prayer and makes it hard for you to
[1:36:18] pray you know it's it's it's got its own
[1:36:20] little agenda something sometimes and
[1:36:21] too busy and filled with information and
[1:36:23] all sorts of things going on and your
[1:36:26] affections may be set on other
[1:36:29] things just you know like I always you
[1:36:32] know just assern what are my affections
[1:36:34] set on what is make what what's giving
[1:36:36] me my joy what's giving me my comfort
[1:36:40] where is my comfort coming from is it
[1:36:43] coming from TV shows is it coming from
[1:36:45] books is it coming from God is it coming
[1:36:49] from my relationship with God
[1:36:52] and it and and it and it can take time
[1:36:54] to to steer your affections you know if
[1:36:58] your affections are set on a certain
[1:36:59] thing and it might not be a bad thing it
[1:37:01] might be work it might be something
[1:37:02] that's just but if if your affections
[1:37:04] become set on that it becomes a bad
[1:37:06] thing because it's because then for you
[1:37:08] to steer your affections back towards
[1:37:11] what is perfect love God relationship
[1:37:15] Fellowship it it can take a bit of work
[1:37:18] to stare that back because your mind is
[1:37:20] geared towards a certain thing all the
[1:37:22] time and you're enjoying it you're doing
[1:37:24] that but now you know we want to stare
[1:37:27] we want to we want to stare our ship you
[1:37:30] know because the Holy Ghost he wants to
[1:37:33] stare us into perfect love all these
[1:37:35] other things is just temporal as Isaac
[1:37:37] said earlier it's just temporal but
[1:37:39] perfect love the season we're in cast
[1:37:43] out
[1:37:45] fear brother brand says and we cuz now
[1:37:49] I'm talking about now how where does the
[1:37:51] perfect love get generated and what
[1:37:53] outworking in our life and our testimony
[1:37:55] is it generated how to get perfect love
[1:37:58] and confidence and when we were Sinners
[1:38:01] alienated without God in the world in
[1:38:03] that muck of mud as I talked about this
[1:38:05] morning God come to us God sought you
[1:38:08] you never sought God no man can come to
[1:38:10] me except my father draws him first and
[1:38:13] God came down in that muck thank the
[1:38:15] Lord that he came down in the mck amen
[1:38:19] I'm so glad for the mck for the the Lord
[1:38:21] coming into the mck amen hallelujah
[1:38:24] actually I'm so glad for the mck because
[1:38:25] it's given me some sort of you know I'm
[1:38:27] so thankful to God for a Salvation amen
[1:38:30] you know it's a contrast you can't
[1:38:32] appreciate the day without that night
[1:38:35] experience amen and we're going to read
[1:38:37] now there's an importance in that
[1:38:39] there's there's something in that that
[1:38:41] will generate perfect love for you when
[1:38:43] you realize and you can think over the
[1:38:46] what God did for you where he took you
[1:38:48] from and how he came to you when you
[1:38:50] were not even in any condition to be
[1:38:53] anything and look what he's made you now
[1:38:56] look what he's given you
[1:38:58] Hallelujah that ought to oh and God came
[1:39:01] down in that Mark what you were and
[1:39:03] sought you out and brought you out that
[1:39:05] ought to create a perfect love look what
[1:39:08] you were and look what you are what did
[1:39:12] that somebody that loved you Hallelujah
[1:39:16] can't you have faith in what he's
[1:39:18] promised you then real genuine love will
[1:39:21] create a confidence in his word real
[1:39:24] genuine love will create a confidence in
[1:39:26] his word real genuine
[1:39:29] love amen and so my prayer is Lord give
[1:39:32] me real genuine love for you and let me
[1:39:35] receive your love cuz sometimes we might
[1:39:38] love God but we can't receive his
[1:39:41] because of something in our life our
[1:39:42] parents maybe didn't love us or didn't
[1:39:44] show it they might have loved us but
[1:39:46] they didn't show it so now you find it
[1:39:48] hard to receive the love
[1:39:51] but that complex can be dealt with
[1:39:53] tonight lay it at his feet amen what did
[1:39:57] that somebody that loved you can't you
[1:39:58] have faith in what he's promised you
[1:40:00] then real genuine love or creative
[1:40:01] confidence in his word he caught me when
[1:40:03] I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm
[1:40:06] in his hand see he caught me and he
[1:40:08] loved me when I was unlovable he loved
[1:40:11] you when you was unlovable but he
[1:40:13] changed you oh my think on it think
[1:40:18] about it pray about it confess it amen
[1:40:21] just just roll it over in your thinking
[1:40:24] let that genuine love and
[1:40:26] confidence love worketh Faith and faith
[1:40:31] and love that love casts out the fear
[1:40:34] that crippling nature that wants to
[1:40:37] doubt in your subconscious so this is
[1:40:39] dealing with that that crack of the
[1:40:41] issue to believing to be healed from a
[1:40:43] simple little cold or something simple
[1:40:46] or whatever even major stuff even if
[1:40:48] you've got no arm and you need arm to
[1:40:52] believe that an arm would grow back amen
[1:40:54] there's only one thing that stops that
[1:40:56] from happening Saints and that's doubt
[1:40:58] that's fear that cripples
[1:41:01] faith
[1:41:02] my my
[1:41:04] my now we have great things that we can
[1:41:07] do in the realm of faith faith works
[1:41:10] great things for us and if you Brethren
[1:41:12] here getting your and you can't have
[1:41:14] faith till you have love that's all
[1:41:17] there is to it you perfect love casts
[1:41:20] out all fear and as long as you got fear
[1:41:23] you can't have
[1:41:25] faith as long as you've got fear you
[1:41:27] can't have faith so you got to have love
[1:41:31] first aren't you so glad that all it
[1:41:34] requires is love you don't have to do
[1:41:37] all these works and all these things to
[1:41:39] attain to some Perfect Image you just
[1:41:42] have to have love it's what he wants
[1:41:44] he's a family God Amen he's a god of
[1:41:47] love and relationship and Grace
[1:41:51] Hallelujah it drives all fear out and
[1:41:53] then faith comes in takes the place of
[1:41:56] fear so when you have that you're coming
[1:41:58] right
[1:41:59] along amen uh we can have musicians
[1:42:04] please sorry I think I've been a little
[1:42:06] bit long oh that's okay we're still
[1:42:09] [Laughter]
[1:42:12] reasonable praise the Lord Rec so the
[1:42:15] application and this the summary of
[1:42:17] tonight recognize the season of God and
[1:42:21] live accordingly in his
[1:42:23] light so don't go and watch movies just
[1:42:26] thinking you'll come out all right in 10
[1:42:28] 15 years remember the Rapture could
[1:42:30] happen any day so don't get don't expose
[1:42:33] yourself to things that are going to sew
[1:42:35] Darkness into you and seeds that are
[1:42:37] going to need to be dealt with because
[1:42:39] believe it or not every movie that you
[1:42:42] watch unless it's some nice Christian
[1:42:44] movie I'm telling you is going to sew
[1:42:45] things in your subconscious that you
[1:42:47] don't want there that God's going to
[1:42:49] have to deal with that God God's going
[1:42:51] to have to put you through some trials
[1:42:52] to move
[1:42:53] out believe me I'm telling you this is
[1:42:56] the truth and it's going to become more
[1:42:58] clearer and clearer as the days go by
[1:43:01] you are responsible for the image you
[1:43:03] behold and portray you are responsible
[1:43:06] for the image your children
[1:43:09] behold if so be that you have heard him
[1:43:13] now this is tying it back to what we
[1:43:14] read at the
[1:43:15] beginning so you have heard
[1:43:19] him that you put off the former
[1:43:22] conversation the old man so these are
[1:43:25] things that he's asked us to do these
[1:43:26] are outworkings this is your religious
[1:43:30] activity if I can put it that way not in
[1:43:33] the wrong form of religiosity but
[1:43:35] religious activity and outworking of an
[1:43:36] inner Faith because real faith loves the
[1:43:41] Commandments of the Lord sets their
[1:43:43] affections on the things above because
[1:43:45] there's a something in them drawing them
[1:43:47] towards the
[1:43:49] rapture and be renewed in the spirit of
[1:43:52] your mind perfect love himself casts out
[1:43:55] all fear so live conscious of him amen
[1:44:00] um uh who got a song anyone got a song
[1:44:04] that's relative to the sermon I can't
[1:44:06] think of on but yeah let's sing that

[1:45:00] cast it out and that Lord if there's
[1:45:03] anything that would in our lives that
[1:45:04] would

[1:45:08] that's stopping us from being able to
[1:45:10] receive your love Lord expose it for
[1:45:13] what it is and make it plain and let

[1:45:48] faith can take its place
