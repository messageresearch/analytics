[Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] again [Music] [Music] now [Music] praise the lord hello everyone welcome back to the house of god this morning to be here it's good to um be able to gather together and worship the lord amen who's expecting great things this morning we always get what we expect that's the way that that it works and our expectations actually bring the spirit of god near he because he's gentleman like you the the spirit of god only comes where it's welcome it doesn't intrude and push in he's not like a pushy salesman you know that intrudes were not really welcome and they're calling you and coming at you the gospel doesn't go like that it doesn't it's not forced upon anyone to try and and trick them into it it's actually a choice you know that the he he comes where he feels welcome and when we make the choice he'll come but he doesn't come and force himself upon us uninvited and just pushing he waits for us to ask that's the that's the nature of god you know if you know a gentleman like man or woman that's the way that they operate they don't just force themselves on people they they've got more honour than that and they they respect so that's that's the way that the lord is so let's um let's stand in and invite the lord here so that we can meet have fellowship with the king of kings but he always comes he said we're two or three gathered together in one and there am i in the midst you know there's a there's a certain point in time where where if you if you draw an eye unto the lord the right way he'll draw nigh on to us that he just can't help it that's his nature is that as well that if we genuinely call he'll answer that's the way that he works so we're we're happy this morning that we can call upon the living god so let's just um pray and we'll just commit the service to the lord heavenly father we're so grateful for lord that we come can come freely to the king of kings and lord of lords this morning lord you've made a way for us lord jesus lord you tore the veil lord and you made a way that we could come back and to fellowship with you lord and you said come lord so we're coming this morning and we thank you so much for the privilege that we have to lord and it's a choice that each one of us have made in our hearts to come lord and we believe you can see that choice that each one has made this morning and we know lord that you'll feel welcome in our midst lord as we from our hearts not just from our lips lord but from our hearts and in our mind we welcome you lord that that we could be a changed people lord that we can be filled to overflowing with the love of god lord to be refreshed you said thou that wait upon the lord shall renew the strength lord if there are those without strength this morning lord that your supernatural strength is here lord to strengthen us to encourage us lord to give us joy love peace lord all those wonderful things that are attributes of the spirit of god lord they they flow freely from you from your throne this morning lord just pray that you'd pour out your spirit upon us lord may each one that comes here that's here this morning may we all go out different lord and filled to overflying lord may there not be an empty one among us when we leave lord but may we all we lord even though we may come empty into your presence lord we always leave full lord jesus so that's what we desire this morning and we know that that's the that's the god that we come to lord of god that's full of mercy full of grace and full of truth lord we understand your heart lord that you're a good god lord that and if we approach you the right way lord that you're full of tender mercies lord and you're full of love towards us lord lord we know that if we approach you the wrong way and if we if we're different lord and and lord if we if we push you away lord then you're a god of wrath and justice lord but we're glad this morning lord that we can approach you the right way lord through your blood lord and just accepting what you have for us this morning so we just want to commit the service to you and just invite you to be here in our midst bless the ministry lord maybe it may may um the minister step out of the way and let you move this morning lord as we as we run a great expectation for that lord so we commit the

fire is shut up in my bones amen amen you can take your seats this morning we've got an a special from sister shannon and the um sunday school group is it okay okay this is gonna be good [Music] um [Music] okay so um look red microphone so that's kind of our sunday school lesson today because these guys are so privileged and blessed they're going on a snow trip this week i don't think i ever went in the snow and especially skis as well so i thought this was appropriate for them this morning so guys we'll read it out for them see it up there so this is their memory verse so they get a prize once they tell me it next week okay ready go ahead [Music] awesome okay so um i said to them a while ago in another um sunday school lesson if they just look at nature you'll see god everywhere you'll see god he just puts his analogies everywhere so i reckon he made snow to so how show how righteous he is so when these guys are skiing and they're looking at the snow how bright it is they'll be like that's like god's righteousness and then when they see the snow a little bit more personal they'll be like oh look at that that's god's righteousness and it also becomes our righteousness so the lesson was this was milk at one stage so this is what happens guys what happened when i well we know what happens when our sins are like scarlet okay and it goes into milk milk i said it was like any other religions buddhism you know all the different religions in the world you're still tainted with sin so and then we've got this one i was able to refill because i didn't have any more milk then we've got our own righteousness and then when our sin is dropped into our own righteousness sorry a bit too much this is what it looks like to god so we can't get there by our works or our own righteousness but brother brennan made a reference to clorox bleach he said if our sin gets dropped in clorox bleach in a bucket of clorox bleach this is what happens to it takes a little bit to dissolve and it will just get whiter and whiter and whiter and so it completely dissolves and you have to imagine a whole bucket of bleach with one drop of water and it's still dissolving and another analogy that i told them was we were righteousness we were righteous at one state when we were up in heaven with him right but when we came to the world even being born we got sin tainted so then he takes us and tells us what he did for us and he washes us as white as snow so i had taken the shirt and showed them with the the red food coloring before i don't know why i can't get through without crying and it was completely gone so i'll show you this and the other thing i told them was when we ask for forgiveness it's like this bleach you asked for forgiveness once you say lord i did this please forgive me it's like that white board in our classroom what happens guys he erases it remembers it no more it's like this bleach i'll just pull this out again it's going to be fuming and i told them this bleach is so powerful you get it on your hands you can smell it it is so powerful and that's exactly like god's righteousness so we serve a mighty mighty god [Applause] no sin is greater than god's righteousness don't ever let satan tell you that amen that's the truth let's stand and sing this morning [Music] [Music] there is power in jesus [Music] in the name of jesus [Music] there

happen it's too hard it's impossible you did this you did that but remember god promised it you speak it you believe it never give up never feel silly praying over and over don't worry you just keep going you just keep fighting amen hallelujah let's read i just want to speak this morning on it's time to stand hallelujah and i want to encourage you today and any day more than any day today is the time than any this is the greatest hour that the earth has ever seen because this is everything that calvary has come to accomplish is going to all culminate right now the whole consummation everything the purchase is all happening now it's time to stand it's time to make your stand amen and make it real definite make it real definite amen hallelujah let's turn to matthew 20 29 to 32. amen i want to set the scene before we go into the bigger picture i want to make it very personal and then we'll come back to this so don't think that i'm running off somewhere we are going to come back to this thought but i want to just go to matthew 20 29 to 32 and we're going to just speak about here we're just going to read about bartimaeus amen and how you can bring jesus on the scene and even when it's busy even when it's there's a massive commotion and there's a intent going on he's got lots of important things to do you are he'll you'll still stop him he'll stand for you amen who believes that this morning amen and it says here and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him and behold two blind men sitting by the wayside when they heard that jesus passed by they cried out just say cried out can everyone just say cried out amen who's cried out before amen i think we should cry out a lot amen god is waiting to hear the cry and you know that cry doesn't necessarily need to be a loud cry because he can hear the heart man although sometimes when it just gets too much it becomes a very loud cry oh my me and brother and paul we know all about the loud cry brother oh my goodness hallelujah saying have mercy on us oh lord thou son of david and the multitude rebuked them wow because they should hold their peace but they cried the more amen hallelujah you know when there's something in a believer's heart that that their opportunity is right there nothing's going to stop them and my opportunities right there and i want to tell you this morning your opportunity is right here amen the ever-present god whose mercy is on you every morning is right here your opportunity is here amen so you can think oh my he's busy yes he's got lots of things to do but but what oh my you know he had a lot of things to do right now he was about to go to calvary my to purchase the salvation of the whole world and still watch and the multitude that they but they cried the more saying have mercy on us lord thou son of david and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you and i want i believe that this morning if you'll cry amen you just cry out to the lord the same god will stand he'll stand for you and he is standing for you amen may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen now i want to we will come back to that lord willing i want to speak now from revelation 12 7 and rebel up to 12 and it says here this is going to set the foundation context of our thought today and um i want you to think about this here um you have revelation 12 7 to 12. it's a very familiar passage of scripture that's been preached out many many times it's very popular we know everyone knows the scripture but i want to talk about i want to just um show you a few things so i'll just read here first and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels so we have a great war going on amen and prevail not who's glad that they prevailed not amen hallelujah so therefore that is done the the immovable has been moved the unshakable has been shaken and then the impossible miraculous has been released upon the impossible it's done it's settled it's finished because god said it i believe it that settles it amen glory now we can go home it's all done it's finished just walk in that victory hallelujah let's just have a feed amen let's just rejoice amen i'll just continue on and prevail not neither was their place found any more in heaven but you'll see in a minute how this scoundrels slinks his way back into a position and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world my he was cast out into the earth amen do you know the devil's always good for his being cast out cast out and he's a tool so that you can get character by suffering he makes you suffer a little bit but remember the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in you it's not even worthy to be compared romans 8 18 i'm not going to hang that on the coat hook i'll hang that there not worthy to be compared but it's very valuable so just think of him he's just good for being cast out and the and he was cast out that old serpent down to the earth and his angels were cast out with him those the angels that were cast out with him uh they were once angels created by god in heaven to serve in heaven and they fell to the earth and darkness and they were imprisoned in darkness they are demons so a demon is a fallen angel same species but just in darkness they cross the line between mercy and judgment instantly we we we're different we're god's children there is mercy for us we haven't crossed the line but an angel crossed the line the devil crossed the line those angels those they were good they were angels in heaven and they were deceived by lucifer and the moment they crossed over they became void of love joy peace anything of the fruit of the spirit became nothing to them anymore that's why they're so cold-hearted they can destroy families destroy lives and they it's it's nothing to them they're they're like the epitome of psychopathic you know a psychopathic is someone that can do an evil thing to somebody and not feel any remorse or anything and there's no emotion attached to it they're insane that's the devil that's the devil in them because the devil doesn't care he is just there's no good in him he can't have good in him because he crossed that line we're in right now on earth we're in the middle of it all hello we're here and it's getting and the battle's raging like never before all right amen who believes that this is the the you think and i'll read it and i'll get to it but you see the devil's angry because he knows that he's got a very short time left if you had a very short time left you would be very whatever you were going to be doing you would do it really good wouldn't you you'd just be like i'm going to give it everything right and i would trust that that's for a good so if you had two hours left to do something good for people and you wanted to tell them what you know you wouldn't just go waste that would you i wouldn't waste that two hours man i'll be going oh my i don't know what i'd do but if i knew i'm god's taking me i'm going to go up in a chariot whatever i do for these last two hours so you can you imagine now here's this devil that's going to lose everything he's going to lose all his plans everything's going to be forward he's going to be he's angry assistant here i'll read you he says and the oh and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down amen which accused them before our god day and night oh my you know we we we we get that sometimes you know and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death now i don't want you to don't think oh that's a future thing and we're going to look back and reminisce on that this is current it's happening now it's going to happen there too but it's happening now all right and it's happened before there's three well this might be more but we don't want to go too deep into types and things and obscure ideas but there is three real major events that this is speaking of but i'll read this last verse first therefore rejoice ye heavens do you know what that means that means rejoice ye christians you're already heavens you know you're part of heaven so when it says rejoice your heavens it's saying rejoice shekinah tabernacle rejoice on the tape rejoice in the camera there wherever you're at rejoice hallelujah and you that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time i'm sick of the accuser raven he's raving on and on and on you know a chipmunk but remember you're an eagle amen so this chipmunk just raving on and on and he's always at you he's always trying to fire thoughts at you to make you feel negative about this angry about that this is this is not right and that's not right and all these things to make you start to focus on standing against things you see yes we should be against evil but i tell you and this is the balance here for this thought right if you want to stand against something stand for something you got to stand for something real and let him stand against it for you you know a lot of people they stand against everything but they're not really standing for something and they lose their identity do you know that you lose your identity by becoming a stand against ministry or a critical ministry or a conspiracy theorist and you but you lose your identity you lose it because you're not stan you've lost your your pers you've lost your s your position momentarily but if we're in that condition today you will you'll have it back by the end of the service you'll have it back now if you want it back just take it back amen take it back glory you know we look at this and we think oh well this is a future event and yes it is this will happen we will physically go up we will physically be in heaven and we will physically rejoice and we will say we overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony and we died to our own will that's what that means they love not their lives unto the death it means that you were willing to surrender your will which is a very problematic thing you know the human will is a very very troublesome thing for us it gets us in trouble the devil uses it as leverage against us because he knows we have ambitions and he knows the fabric of our makeup and what our families did a few generations back and he begins to start pinpointing little things and starts to you know tempt us and he knows how that kind of work and he uses it against us but we overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony and we love not our lives unto death you know if you just really want to get get a bigger victory in your life this morning if you want a greater victory right now surrender your will just just surrender your plan and if you don't know what to surrender say lord what am i holding back he'll show you he'll show you you know because when we first got saved man we just and you really surrendered you surrendered all that you knew there was still things there that was still like hiding back somewhere that over the course of your next years and whatever sanctification he would he would begin to show you more he will begin to reveal to you look what you're holding on to here look at this grudge you're holding on to there look at this thing you did back when you were seven look at this thing over here that you you wanted to do and because of that event that's made you want to be this profession but actually i don't want you to be that profession i want you to be this but but you had this like fantasy and we get fantasies in our mind because of an impression that someone that we look up to made on us or something like that and therefore it becomes the fantasy becomes a value and the value becomes your identity did you know that your value what you value what your it becomes your identity and then your identity and what you live out becomes your culture and because these are this is where family spirits are formed and cultures are formed over generations because of what people value hallelujah but you see now i want to just talk quickly about this because this is this is just to grab the context but there are three of these heavenly wars where michael comes on the scene you know this sermon was going to be called when michael stood but i just it just wasn't personal enough you know i was praying about i was like no you know but when michael stood because see when michael stands if you read in the bible anywhere where michael is wrenching and he stands look out devil look outside look out chains look out bondage it's gone because michael stands and if you can just recognize this morning that michael has stood again in this generation will you watch i can you know i can hear the chains falling because michael has stood on our generation to bring total utter complete deliverance amen what was that song that brother oniya sung that was like i am totally delivered or something absolutely saved amen absolutely free jesus christ has set me absolutely free michael's stood on this generation i'm absolutely free who's absolutely free this morning amen you are you might not feel free some of you might be going through a trial you're still at if you just confess it amen and if you just walk and believe in the word consider yourself absolutely free because that trial that bondage whatever it may be the chain is broken because any chain that ever comes on anyone in their mind or whatever it may be has already been broken at calvary the power of the blood when he said it is finished amen when he said it is finished every chain that would ever go on any one of his people was broken right there even if it feels heavy there might be you might be clothed in them oh they're from generations back and it's all just been lumped on you like a big ball a chain ball doesn't matter it's all broken it's all broken this morning you can stand stand because this is the time what's the sermon called it's time to make your stand it's time glory oh my so the devil angry right this is where this is where it all became personal the devil got angry if we look at that right and we read that for the most part and for where john is sitting he's looking in a vision and he's in he's in eternity in the lord's day right he's up there he's looking at the vision and that's the biggest picture there is right that event but the real transpiration or how that vent event has happened it happened once right at the beginning when lucifer did the deed and he conceived iniquity he was kicked out he lost his first estate and the devils went down onto the earth but then what he did is he and through his shrewdness and his lies he entered into the human race and he began to trouble the human mind and he got into the human race how we know all the way through and it's come right up and now from the last 6 000 years he began he got higher and higher up and now he's worshipped he's found his throne again well he's found his throne within the human mind he's found his throne he's been glorified in this whole civilization and the monetary system and the whole economy and everything and all of these massive big denominational spires and and and huge saint peter's basilicas and and all that stuff who is being worshipped lucifer they even sing to lucifer do you know that you can translate those latin songs in the basilica and they are saying oh hail thou son of the morning o great lucifer king of darkness all those i might be just transliterating a little bit there but you watch you go you type in them you'll find it they openly it's a dark place but that's not all of it that's just what you can see there's a lot more going on behind the scenes what is it lucifer's managed to get up through the human race now now we're not void from that we were born in sin shaping an iniquity and we come to this world speaking lies now we need deliverance amen now what makes the devil angry is when he gets kicked out amen he gets real mad when he gets kicked out and as you grow this seed michael stood in this generation hey man you can say i'm going to read this and you can make this now this is happening in your life and there was war in andy michael and his angels fought against the dragon amen you can say there was war in me michael and his angels fought against the dragon amen he and it says and i'll read it in daniel 12 it wasn't to happen until the last days it wasn't to happen all the churches all the through the ages yes they were saved yes that bride they will come up in this the first resurrection of the ful the wise virgins and all of them and they they they had their pace and they had supernatural and they had miracles but it was only in the last day the last day where michael would stand to deliver his people totally absolute deliverance here we are saints we are in the last day if you find yourself burdened down by some bondage say oh lord if michael is here if michael stands for me then i'm going to stand for him and in standing here it is in standing you shall be delivered because your true identity will be revealed in standing but what he wants to do he wants to show you this about the vaccine and verse about some prince charles and this antichrist and all these other things and even even the real what it really is what it really is the antichrist really oh and he wants you to get all involved with that and then on top of that he wants you to have a big light big kingdom and and he'll give you all the stuff and he'll make you all this and that and everything to distract you from what you should really be standing for oh it's time to make your stand it's time children teenagers uh 20 year olds 30 40 50 is there any 70 year olds i don't think so but listen it's time to make your stand whatever age group whatever decade you were born in make your stand this day and i'm sure i'm not i'm preaching to the choir right we're making our stand but i just want to add some color who wants some color color in your stand this morning just say no this is it this is me this is what i stand for i stand for the message of the hour i stand for my jesus i stand because michael has stood in this generation i'm gonna stand with michael in fact i'll tell you now michael stands in me do you know that the great mighty angel spiritually speaking my you know what i mean this is the this is the power of god this is god's arrow of deliverance because there has to come a time where a people that's natural on the earth leave the earth and if you want to leave the earth you need something more than just a dry-eyed confession or a message religion you need something more than just a then i know the prophet was sent and i know this and that you need something real and it's time to make a stand because when you make a stand i'm not saying you know whether you're filled with the holy ghost or you're going to be filled make your stand because when you define that when you make definition to it real definition watch what happens you watch what happens so you're growing because of this anointing that's upon us because of the hour that we live in we are being you're the word that's coming to you the deliverance the power the glory believe for it because watch what happens you grow you are coming more and more like christ from glory to glory and as you go from glory to glory and from glory to glory the devil is losing his position in your life and he's being pulled out of heaven he's being pulled out of this he's being pulled out of this he's being pulled down until he's on the ground hallelujah that's the transaction that's taking place but watch out i'm not trying to put fear on you but remember be diligent and faithful to the lord and let him lead because the devil is angry more than ever before because he knows that what's going on in your life and these messages that you're hearing and the tapes that you're listening to have got rapturing faith on them and that rapturing faith is raising a standard in your life beyond any age there's ever been you are going higher and higher from glory to glory higher than any other glory that there's ever been we're not any better we're not doing any better physically intellectually it's just because we're subject to god's divine plan his plan is to raise up a people above all that to pull lucifer out of his position completely but he's angry but the thing is here it is when he's angry the trials that you go through and the challenges that you face become harder but they're necessary for you to come into divine character because with divine character god can release to you the miraculous god can release to you the spoken word god can place back in your hands what the first adam lost what the second animal displayed and what brother branham's ministry came to when he began to speak and it happened and the storm was there and he said claire four days sun shall shine it did the squirrel shall come from there and it did and all these things would happen his wife had a big tumor the size of a baseball before the doctor scalpel touches her it will not be there who can testify was it there no who believes that that is for you it's for you it's time to make a stand this is what we stand for we are standing for the total deliverance we are standing for a message that's come to rapture us out of here amen take a stand in that stand your identity shall become clearer that's why there's such a fuss you know you think why is there such a fuss going on i seem to grow a little bit i seem to get more of god in me and all of a sudden things just get harder why is that because the devil is scared he's like a rabid wild animal an untamed beast and he's scared of you he's real scared so he's using everything he can everything he can to stop you growing anymore because the more you grow the more he gets cast out and the sooner the rap is going to take place all right and the fourth seal the prophet says all right notice now he'll be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes up satan is cast out now that's the third that's the third manifestation of revelation 12 where we physically go up right now we're spiritually going up right now we're being spiritually built in christ jesus right now we're coming into a spiritual awakening but you see there will come a time where that spiritual awakening reaches its zenith which is the the very height the it becomes it's ready perfected and remember i don't know someone said it but he which began a good work in me shall complete it until the day of jesus christ he will not leave you nor forsake you when you can put your finger on a moment where god did something in your life just remember god will never leave you god will not leave you unfinished you might feel like oh my nothing's been happening in my life for so long but remember you go back to where god started something go back there stand for that stand for it it doesn't matter if it was 30 years ago stand for it make a stand and say i'm going from right there right at that spot i'm going to start from there and i'm going to build and i'm going gonna have a real identity i'm gonna stand for this hallelujah oh my there is a power when you make a stand it has to be your stand not my stand not brother ben's stand amen not just a stand of the church it has to be yours you young children you have to make a stand alleluia you might not understand every word that's being preached but make a stand make a stand hallelujah because you see god he loves it when somebody just says yes i believe this and i'm gonna stand for this and i'm gonna really you know i'm gonna really i'm gonna have courage and i'm gonna be a little bit proud about this you know in a good way not a not an evil pride but whatever the other word is a positive pride confident have confidence in god be confident of god but so that third one is when we physically go up and then we're up there in a rapture but and when we go up because you see when we go up now lucifer loses his hold completely in the bride out of her she pulls him out of heaven she pulls him out of any position that he once ever had because all of god's seed are taken and the holy ghost goes with them and then lucifer's out on the earth and look out world that's going to be the greatest tribulation but right now you are spiritually doing it and he's being pulled out of his position in your life he's becoming less and less powerful in your life and his and his law his lies and his thoughts you just brush them off and you walk you're walking and this chipmunk starts going at you again and you say no devil no get the hand satan and then it comes to a point where he's chattering you just keep walking he's going no you're just like nothing's happening here i don't even need to worry about you boy you're done hallelujah you don't even notice him but that makes him real angry he gets real upset but all he does is he kicks himself again because whatever trials that they can do you know they just get the bigger devils against you you know he gets scared he's like man we're going to get the heavies onto this one we've got to get the heavies on to these young people oh man because these guys are pulling devil out of their lives oh my hey man you guys are just a bunch of devil pullers pulling him out of his position pulling him down and stomping on him amen i think brother kaido said just write his name on the bottom of your shoe that's where he belongs you can stomp an impression of his own name on his head hallelujah amen make it final set to his seal his destruction hallelujah with a towel honestly we need a turbo intercooler above this thing i'm not a turbo or anything but it's hot oh my i'm gonna jesus help us amen i want to read from matt 22 sorry matthew 10 32 to 33 it says here and i want to ask you who what or who are you standing for whosoever therefore shall confess me before men whom will i confess also before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men whom will i also deny before my father which is in heaven so i want to elevate in your mind right now and in your heart by the lord's grace the the the absolute importance of making a stand you cannot not make a stand it's of life or death that's so important and he says this because he knows that every true believer will make a stand you will push through like the lilly born in the mud you'll push through all the mud and up through the murky waters and one day your leaves will come out on the top of the pond and you will make a stand and your scent will go out to all the earth and it will begin to flourish because you finally get right in that light amen judgment begins at the house of god you know but we have to judge ourselves that we be not judged so when you hear these things you know these things might be your own testimony already but there's people in here that it's not amen but i think you know when i hear brother ben preaching and it's pretty stern i always own it for myself you know and sometimes it hurts it's hard but but that's good you need that you want to leave the server scout out don't don't get your defenders on you know you know like that you know some sort of um aerodynamic and you're just flying through you know avoiding it all don't avoid it just say lord i like that i want that you know or give me more of it hallelujah you know we should be malleable really malleable you know oh tinder and malleable you know like the wood that the ark's made out of the arcs made out they god said make the ark out of gopher wood because gopher wood was the softest most porous wood around that that was in that area and if you just take that go forward we're like into the gopher wood we should be porous and and soft but then when and he says now go and soak it and pitch the tar so he goes and gets the pitch of some tree that the sat and he paints it on or whatever he did i think it was um actually bitumen of some sort some sort of alkane i don't know that's probably too chemical you know like an actual like um oil like a like a tar but anyway so they put the pitch on and then because it's so porous this the holy spirit this the oil can soak right in deep to the wood then that soft wood becomes the toughest most buoyant material that they had amen all natural all natural and you know that that's like our own life so when you hear these things just just just be like go forward you know say yeah amen i humble myself lord i'm not gonna get uh agitated or i'm not gonna deflect these things and in john 13 20 because remember we're trying it's time to make your stand but you see now i'm putting the importance on the of on the stand itself he says here verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so you see now god jesus is standing there and he's basically saying i'm going to send people i'm going to send messengers i'm going to send a five-fold ministry i'm going to send prophets i'm going to send apostles and teachers and evangelists i'm going to send them and if you receive whom i send you receive me all right paul on the road to damascus met the pillar of fire and and and and he was he fell to the ground and and he said lord lord who are you and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest paul wasn't alive paul wasn't on the scene when jesus was physically doing his thing right but it was the disciples it was jesus in the disciples so to receive peter was to receive jesus to receive james and john when they came and philip and and all of them was to receive jesus and then out through now the last two thousand years and all the church ages god has sent prophets he says i shall he says this i shall send prophets i shall send all these teachers and you go and i don't know i can't remember what he says after that but he says i'm going to do this so he had a plan and he sent ministers and prophets and major messengers to all these ages but he ascribes the reception of them as receiving him and when you see it when you see what god has sent to you and you know it's him he wants you to stand he wants you to make a righteous robust stand hallelujah and handwriting on the wall the prophet says o eternal god shake men tonight and woman before judgment shakes them may they come to mercy and make a stand for thy son remember to receive whom he sins amen you have to stand you have to receive it because when you see that it's actually christ's sent then it changes everything it's like when you listen to a sermon like if you sit here and you think oh andy's just waffling then you'll get nothing but if you believe that actually god is inspiring this guy and i'll you know i'm not going to put myself in any position like that but god is inspiring this guy let's just let's just use anybody but and you received the inspiration you go i know god speaking i know god's speaking to me you will get the reward but if you're just here to learn oh my you'll get some knowledge all right you can get knowledge but we want god and then we want to stand for god amen may they come to mercy and make a stand for thy son jesus instead of standing out there for some membership or some standing for something that's not right or can i say this standing for against all these things you know making a big show about what we're against and all these other things but what profit does it make us what does it actually do for us or the people that we share it all to and i've been involved with the um the these open brethren people and they get people from all over the world coming in great teachers great knowledge and theology but all they do is talk about how bad benny hinn is and how bad old td jakes and how bad this one is and i think you know just it's a waste of time but then they don't even talk about what's good about the message in god you know how can someone get saved you know what about delivering the people they're sitting there all smokers and drinkers and they're just stuck and there's deliverance for them and all they're thinking about is what they're against now don't get me wrong here i want to just balance the uh that like to stand against there's nothing wrong with being against stuff the prophet was against things actually the bible says to stand against the wiles and snares of the devil right but don't let that be your focus don't let that be the very thing that you do and what people know you for people shouldn't know you because of all the things that you don't like amen help me lord oh my you shouldn't be known for what you dislike you should be known for who you stand for who stands for jesus amen hallelujah oh my i stand for this message i stand for all of these things amen i stand for wholesome homes i stand for real marriages i stand for the baptism of the holy ghost amen i stand for changed lives for people to get a life change for people to get delivered i stand for the good old-fashioned pentecostal meetings amen hallelujah not some rock and roll work-up pentecostal i'm talking about a good old-fashioned day of pentecost original holy ghost outpouring that's what i stand for and that's what michael stands for because our michael that our jesus the angel of the lord has come down and he would come at the end time to make a stand for his people to push back all the forces of darkness so a bride could rise up you know that if he didn't come we would have no hope we would be swimming in darkness like the world and i'm talking scuba diving not just a little frolic on top in the paddling pool this world you think this is coming now you look at the flood right that judgment that flooded the earth and it covered mount everest that's what's happening spiritually in darkness and sin this world has got a flood over it and it's called sin satan's eden you know in revelation 9 it said that smoke would smoke out of the pit well if you could see it visually it will be like even all the mountains is covered now in darkness but michael amen but my jesus let me tell you about my jesus oh my he's come down amen in this generation amen to clear a little bit of that for you for me so that we can rise oh my hallelujah i think mother teres he touched on it he said that he's made a letter hallelujah and he's gotten the angels of god ascending and descending that's for you there's a letter for you and a letter for me amen who's got a letter this morning amen he's extended mercy oh my hallelujah oh my ah amen that brings out the african in me [Laughter] oh mate i i love it eh but i'm just i'm still white it just doesn't work too i've looked at myself and i'm going man you just a white boy you know two prim and proper mate oh lord help us say we just be ourself hey if i'm just a foolish silly man then let me be i'm happy hallelujah [Laughter] brahman's looking at me she's like i'm thinking i know what she's thinking he's like don't go too far now oh my you know we just get real happy who gets real happy hey man hallelujah we've got a lot to be happy about so i just wanted to balance those things daniel 12 1 it says here and at that day oh sorry and at that time shall michael stand up that great prince which standeth for the people for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same that same time and at that time which is this time thy people shall be delivered oh my every one that shall be found written in the book hallelujah who believes they're written in the book oh my name is written in heaven oh it can make me shout oh i just i can't contain the joy hallelujah that my name is written in heaven hallelujah and we know daniel's people is the jewish people and we know that the messiah came to the jews first and he and he had three and a half year ministry to them and he was introduced by john the baptist under the spirit of elijah we know this but then there's this whole 2000 then he was cut off by the priest sacrificed their own messiah made a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world blinded by their own religion and then there's two thousand years where the very the privilege of what he came for came to the gentiles and the very the very the best of it all the one that at the wedding oh my it's all just flowing out at the evening kana wedding when was the wine the best one served here we are at the end of the wedding all right the best wine has been saved for you oh why it's it's got a greater effect to bring you higher than ever before so that even the master of the feast would stand and say oh my no one ever does this but you did it who did it he did it jesus did it hallelujah amen and then right at the end time right when it's about to change back over to the jews this deliverance this michael that would stand for the people daniel's people would stand for you first because you have to leave first the bride amen that ministry that when the jews get delivered happens after we leave so what does god do just before the end and just before all the crossover he sends another man anointed with the spirit of elijah and in 1933 or seven or whatever it was on the river jordan ohio river he says the pillar of fire came down in front of everybody it was in the newspapers it said as john the baptist was set to forerun the first coming so sent i you with a message to forum the second coming your message shall introduce the messiah to the gentiles after they've gone all into strain all denominations and all the darkness and all the conspiracies and everything there would be something real there would be a definite revelation of michael this mighty angel this lord this one that purchased it all for us our redeemer our kinsmen hallelujah he would come hallelujah he would stand and there would be a people that would see it and recognize their privilege and recognize i'm so privileged where there's a sea of darkness everywhere and here comes michael down you know you've got revelation chapter 9 and all that smoke came out and it flooded the earth and all these people and everything is just in sin and darkness they can't see you look up at sin down at sin all around you is sin you can't get through it and then someone gives you a book hallelujah someone gives you a little book or someone gives you a tape or someone says something to you and there's a seed inside you that says it just starts to grow it says yes all of a sudden you know you go on a journey that ends with michael the mighty angel himself with an open book comes down into your life what is he coming down to do to take away the darkness amen a visitation for you personally so that you can see what you need to stand for because you've got to make a stand today don't leave the service without making a stand amen when we finish we're going to pray and even if you have made a stand because i'm sure there's many stands been made we're going to make another stand amen who's ready to make a stand hallelujah who's ready to add definition to their stand hallelujah amen declaring you know john when he saw the seals open all heaven all and hit under the earth and all on the earth heard him cry oh yeah well we're going to just arrow we're just going to continue that cry that was shout that rejoice amen we're going to make our stand with michael amen michael is a type of christ i don't i don't know whether he's an actual individual angel a separate person or not but in the scripture he's also a type of christ and he serves christ and it does seem very much like he is christ in angelic form but also christ manifests himself in many forms he manifests himself in the pillar of fire and in the form of the the flesh that he uh was crucified in which was made a little lower than the angels he was he's manifested in in all sorts of different forms because god is not subject to geography or to metamorphosis in any way he can do whatever he wants look at the creation and the nature he created all right but just because god manifests himself in a different person or a different way it doesn't make him a separate person this is where trinitarianism went off and but divided god into all these different pantheons of people you know you know benny hinn now i'm probably preaching against myself here now but i just want to show you how that works because benny in all his own things he can do whatever he wants right he's doing what he thinks is right now he believes there's nine people in the godhead you know that because of all the apparitions and any time that god was manifested in some form became a person to him that's the way trinitarianism works father son and holy ghost is the same god same person but manifested in different forms and in time or eternity you've got time and eternity amen so we don't want to get caught up in those things but remember michael is here and i just wanted to share that with you so you understand when i say michael i'm talking about the mighty angel i'm talking about christ coming an angelic form amen i'm talking about the lord coming spiritually in such a way to change the people to deliver the people to take you and well let me just say this to to to to to just write the pattern of our teenagers who are being distracted who are being troubled who are struggling even to come to church they're sitting in their homes right now in a mental battle mental warfare do you see that as impossible because i do that's an impossible because this world is pulling them so hard this world and the devil's using them against their own mind and they're just drinking in sinful things all day right now probably playing evil stuff but god works in the impossible and i prayed for this and you see michael's come down in this generation and even though it looks impossible you watch you speak and you make your stand this morning and you watch what happens to them amen i prayed uh that's another sermon which i'll preach one day from zechariah 4. but to me the lord likened our youth situation like what zerubbabel was facing you know they had a time of discouragement and you may be in a time of discouragement because of what you see in your children and the struggles and what they're going through you may be in that time just like zerubbabel but remember god he came to encourage the rubell he said i'm going to wear you like a signet i'm going to put you on my ring finger and i'm going to seal i'm going to break those mountains i'm going to loose those impossibilities and they're going to come that temple's going to be finished you're building that temple as a rubber ball i'm going to anoint you and all the stuff against you and all these other people and everything and all the world is distracting and it's all taking these video games and everything in life and all of it but i i'm gonna break all that down and they're gonna come in amen the temple is made of living stone zerubbabel's temple was a physical temple struggles all the devil everything against it but god says aruba i'm going to use you like a signet i'm going to wear you like a ring and i'm going to seal that temple and all the people in it and so all of these ones that we see has gone astray and stuck and they're struggling and unbelief is shrouding their minds i rebuke that spirit of unbelief in the name of jesus christ they shall be part of the temple and and it says here who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel for thou behold you shall be made a plain and that was the promise i was given i was given that promise that the mountain of impossibility that we see with our young people facing because they i s because i said lord what is it what can we offer them that's better than all the tantalizing sin that's out there that can instantly be enjoying a soap opera or instantly be enjoying some drug or instantly be getting drunk and having all these friends around them and it's all just wonderful oh so good what can we offer and you know what it is it's the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah but we're going to make a stand today because these services need to leave human control and if we don't make a stand we're going to sit in here we're going to have mind battles and god can't even move so if you're sitting here having mind battles make a stand this morning make a stand against it and say no more satan i will not let you anymore i'm not going to sit here having my battles i cast you out in the name of jesus christ i'm gonna stand with michael who's come down he's dispelled the clouds in my own life so that i can sit in the service and rejoice i can sit in the service and the devil doesn't know what to do with me does the devil know what to do with you still if the devil still knows what to do with you make your stand today hallelujah make your stand today stop bowing down to the devil oh my be careful be careful because he's a cunning one he's cunning and he'll use thoughts that you think are your own because he knows what you say and he remembers it all and he comes at you with thoughts that you think are yours make a stand today make a stand right now right now we can pray at the end and we can make a stand together we will make your stand now hallelujah daniel thy people shall be delivered i said all that so that you don't just sit there and think oh that's about jews it's about israel and it is because daniel was in israelite but remember the covenant that they pursue and and at the first coming we'll come back to them and yes michael will come down for them he'll stand on the great mount of olives hallelujah whatever he does i'm not familiar completely with it all but he'll do that he'll come down and he'll deliver them and they'll come out and it'll be a wonderful time and but that happens for you first amen my people shall be delivered i just think shall be delivered anything else is false when you look at it and you think oh this can't happen look at all this it's saying this and that and everything all these family issues and whatever it may be that's holding everything back don't worry about that they shall be delivered amen this is god's word we believe it who believes for it everyone that shall be found written in the book delivered house of hell give way to the name of amen what happened after he said that you could hear cranking and creaking and bars moving because there's nothing too hard for my god amen you think it's impossible well let's have a look daniel was in babylon he was right up at the government level and you know that there's principalities and powers and demons and devils and everything china they control babylon they control world powers they control political systems so here we have now we have daniel now praying and listen to this he says and he's and and then he had a visitation of an angel and the angel gabriel came to daniel i think it was gabriel but anyway this angel doesn't um he doesn't identify himself but he says and he said unto me oh daniel oh man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright now we're in mystery babylon and we've been called to stand stand upright for unto thee i am now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then he said unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words so you can see now but he says here but the prince of the kingdom of persia which is the devil the the the head devil over persia withstood me so here's this here's a guy he's a prophet and he's praying and he's waiting for the lord and he needs an answer for something and here there's there's an angel sent to him to to show him the message and there's a demons resisting him so he's fighting for you right he's fighting for us so the moment that you begin to pray this is warfare taking place and god's fighting for you so just sometimes you won't see the answer straight away because what you're asking for is a big thing amen amen what you may be asking for there's resistance in the heavenly realms but remember who stands for you listen to this amen listen to this mate take notice of this prince of persia stood me one in 21 days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me oh my and i remain there with the prince's kings of persia so you see now even when it gets hard and when the battle is huge and you think it's impossible who's come down who stands for you today who's standing for you right now who's standing to see your children come in who's standing to see you children get saved break through the veneer of this world break through all of the lies and deceptions and the smoke and the mirrors and everything who stands for you now jesus he's standing for you today he stands for you and i will stand for a god that stands for me and in standing for him my identity shall be concreted does that make sense concreted solidified manifested my identity you see if our identity is not strong if our stand is not strong you know standing and knowing what you stand for and declaring it and speaking it and living it that weakens your identity if you don't in the beginning and ending of the just gentile dispensation the prophet says this says he says it's time to it says at that day michael shall stand for the people he ain't standing for the nations he is standing for the people and many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth some shall rise to everlasting shame and contentment but those that be wise and turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever what is it i've walked out and looked at that great morning star as she begins to move yonder what does the morning star say the morning star is only reflecting the supreme light of the sun coming in is that right you know the morning star who knows what the morning the morning star is venus it's not a star it's a planet so the morning star is actually a planet that doesn't have its own light it reflects the light of the sun as it's just the sun the earth is here the sun just comes up the light shines over the earth reflects on venus and that venus then reflects the light of the coming sun so it says here the morning star is only reflecting the supreme light of the sun coming is that right the morning star the reason it's so bright you know why it is the sun is so much closer to it it's just the pressing on and the morning star hails the coming of the sun and then he says this and i want to say this to you all right you morning stars it's time to go hailing is coming shine morning stars it's time to stand for the coming son who has stood for us he this the the you see you it's not just brother branham and a prophet messenger who who who fulfilled that light of a morning star to reflect the light of the coming sun no it's actually you as well you become part you are a morning star you when you make a stand what do you what does the stand do when you make a real stand a righteous standard stand for this truth your stand what happens is the clouds dispel and you begin to shine the light of the coming sun you begin to reflect the light that is declaring the lord has come in your life he's come down to you he's come into you he stands for you and we are called to reflect this do you know where you stand do you know where you stand one and all it says here in the church age book it says but but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal see these are all demons if a church gets lukewarm it's a devil influence if the church becomes formal it's a devil if the church becomes powerless it's a devil but the book of revelation he says it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he has cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it and he knows the devil knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and here it is for me here for this context and what she is and what she stands for what are you standing for you know we can be general about this i stand for jesus so do they there's two billion in christendom that stand for jesus but is that the real jesus is that the is that jesus in his program or is that just the idea and the imagination of what they think jesus is i don't know i mean everyone has their own conviction everyone has their own but what about you do you just stand for jesus or do you know exactly what you're actually standing for because this is very important that you make a stand it has to be your stand you have to stand today amen hallelujah amen church of the living god oh sorry what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army church of the living god here and on the tape two do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you the congregation says amen oh brother how is satan going to stand against that when you know what you stand for that you stand for the supernatural god reigning in your life when you stand for a message that's come to bring people to that this is what we stand for we're standing for god manifested in the flesh we're standing for a people that god uses to impart eternal life amen we're standing for a heavenly culture we're standing for a rapture we're standing for rapturing faith amen that is being ministered to us hallelujah we're standing for young people that are lining the front seats that are on fire for god that are going out there and tearing up the streets on fire for god that's what we stand for and we will not give up until we see it we will not give up until we see the fire of god amen burning in the hearts all the clouds you know the the smoke of the pit of hell completely cleared out the mind and you become an invincible army and the devil doesn't know what to do with you anymore amen what's how is he going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following it hallelujah where is the secret of your strength this power must be manifested in you john 7 37 it says in the last day great day of the feast jesus stood and cried i love that just like now in revelation chapter 10 which we'll get to in a second and then we'll close the last day jesus stood and cried what happened when he cried seven thunders under their voices amen who knows that who's under the sound of that voice amen who hears that voice today amen where jesus has stood in the last days in that time of the great feast amen in the evening time when the when the wine has been given and jesus stands amen and cries and power comes forth to rapture a bride away the bridegroom call comes down through a message to take a bride and rapture her into heaven but in the process she begins to pull the devil out of his position because she is willing to make a stand she is willing to say this is what i believe she is willing to say i am standing today for this message i am unashamedly standing today that william branham is the seventh angel is malachi 4 is luke 17 30. amen is the very angel that took john through the book of revelation do you know that it says that the lord sent his angel to take me on show me these things so whose message showed you revelations 1 church ages revelation 4 in the throne room revelation 5 the seals opening revelation 9 and 10 and all the way through things that ought to be the future home of the heavenly father of nazi bride who was that angel that led john and who was john hello you are john hey john you're john [Laughter] amen amen are you with me are we together now look what he did when he stood and cried now this was jesus in his actual ministry but remember god does nothing by whenever he lives whatever he does has multiple prophetic values he says if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water and i want you to know that those rivers of living water that flow from you when you stand for him and that's why i want to tell you it's important that you stand for him stand for him stand for those he sends stand for his message stand for what he believes stand for his values stand for the heart of god stand for the program of god say lord what's your program what's your will what's your burden you know do we ask that or do we just have our own burden you know do we just go about our own merry way we do our own thing we just live our own life and never even ask god lord what is your burden today what's your burden for my life lord i'm going to meet this person do you have a heart for that person do you want to say something become conversable with god don't just go off in some religious form we've got to break the mold break the mould of your own religiosity and habits break your religion just just go from it being a habit and i'm not saying that we're just all religious people but we and i myself you begin to form habits and you do it by habit you do it because it's the right thing and it is the right thing and it's fine but it's more than that if you come to a place where you say lord what's your burden for the song service what's your burden and you become tuned into that then when you do anything it changes it all it changes the very tense of your meeting when you go to your friends and maybe you've got friends that you love and you and they're not serving the lord and and before you go you say lord what's your burden what do you want out of this help me lord to achieve what you want because i can't as i said before we are facing now a devil that's angry and he knows if he can keep our unsaved loved ones out and our children out in discouragement the longer he keeps them there the longer we're staying so i i i just encourage you right now make your stand don't don't don't just treat this as like oh you know predestination it's gonna happen it's such an imbalanced way of thinking you know and it's a very dangerous place to get to extreme calvinism don't ever get there and i know that it's hard to care i know oh my i care a lot and the more you care the harder it is for people for young people for the youth for everyone for everything when you care it hurts because you watch and you see and you're like man you're just so happy when they're happy but when they're sad you're sad and when they're going through you're going through too and so the easy road is to just pull back and go the lord will deal with it and he will and you sometimes have to you know if you're directed on the lord to take your hands away completely but you still care i still care i mean we all care right you have a caring but you can be hurt and a hurt can break that that that cha that bind bond it's a healthy bond of caring as a parent as a friend as a brother or sister and so we have to be very very diligent in the in the way that we think about these things amen and the way that we approach these things hallelujah so that we can see our young people breakthrough because we know and the devil knows that he that's his last you could say that's his last port of of of of of delay the last moment of delay as the is as the as those last ones to come in right i mean i'm preaching very elementary things here but this is very key to this thought of why it's important that you make an absolute stand and why when you stand you care and when you make a stand you're standing for caring for those that aren't that are struggling and when someone's going through a hard time and maybe everything's broken and broken around them and we all go through it we don't just go oh yeah that's because of that that's because of that and you just waffle off a whole bunch of reasons why they're going through it and they did this and they made that mistake and oh that's why they're going through judgment that's the wrong way to be you know you don't want to look like look at like that because you see that one that's going through that as part of your family part of your your redemption you could say because our the redemption of our body is connected to the body of christ the redemption of our body is connected to our teenagers that struggle because they need to they need to make a stand of their true identity and and let god take over right but there's this world of oh my goodness do you know that there's the teenagers of today face the worst influx of of of um of of stimulation like no other age and and me too we do right mate everywhere everywhere you look you've got these screens you've got just opinions no other age has ever been like this and that's where i got to when i was praying and i was like lord you know and caring for the for the for the condition of our young people and for the teenagers and i thought man look at the pull of the world and i thought the only way the only way to break them out of that pull and that tantalization and how like because it's just instant gratification and and all that the only way is supernatural services supernatural events taking place supernatural manifestation of the holy ghost in our church right now where is your expectation you know like uh are you sitting here today waiting for lunch are you sitting here drawing are you pulling is your faith making the service because i can feel there's a mix there's a mix of pulling and there's there's there's stationary there's no resistance which is good but you can feel it when there's resistance there's no resistance but you know there's you can feel a pull and when there's a pull it just flows out but when there's when it's not so much of a pull then you go back to the notes and you begin to you know so you actually you are the service you know i mean he's the service that's all about him but you make it without us pulling and faith you know expectation it's not just an empty idea oh it's going to happen it's going to be such a good service or good and you sit down no it's faith expectation is a belief it's actually a substance that you believe i'm going to meet god today and when you believe you will meet him and that minister will go off onto all sorts of different things the service that they have prepared will become multi-dimensional the thought will be the same because the spirit will keep it all in tune but it'll be it'll just go it'll just go right out you know and it'll begin to call supernaturally and that's when the breakthrough takes place and like i said before for that to happen we need to make a firm stand a real stand for truth and win and and a stand against mind battles in the service because that's a huge thing and i have them too we all have mind battles in the surface because the devil knows that if he can get the people discouraged then it's fear it's anxiety can you imagine right if you could see the thoughts and the mind battles above everybody if they were all like just into the service and rejoicing in faith and pulling man this place will just be erupting right but then the devil's like i don't want that to happen i'm just going to hammer these people because he knows he's being pulled out of heaven you're pulling him down you're pulling him out of his position this is his last straw of fight and as our teenagers and this is another thing sorry to pick on the teenagers but i love you i love you but you guys are going through your change and when you go through change and adults go through their change too again you have another change later on and it's two plots in a human life where there is a lot of identity being questioned in your own life and everything it's very it's it's it's a time of change but as the t as we get an influx of teenage minds coming in the mind battles are there on a whole new level amen a whole new level because you've got all these young adults now and they're thinking all the stuff and they're like going through these things and they're real hungry they're starving you know especially the young boys mate they just want a good feed you know so you know when you start preaching past 12 o'clock matt you're in trouble you know they're like man i don't want brother andy to preach anymore oh mate i'm starving man sorry that doesn't happen to the girls though of course that's just the boys you know oh well it happens to me still sometimes you know we're all human um but where there's something else and i don't know who i was speaking to but i was speaking to someone the other day and i and i said you know yeah i get hungry in the service sometimes and i said you know the only thing to break that hunger is to really make an extra stand right there in the service to fully enter in and then what happens is you know because when you really enter in and i want to tell you children and i tell my children all the time you can listen if you really say lord speak to me and you might be hungry and you and you sometimes you get hungry 11 o'clock that's a real big problem you know you're like man i've got an hour or what to like sit here hungry i tell you i'll give you a little tip just say lord speak to me speak to me right there i'm gonna make my stand today because i don't wanna sit here starving i'm gonna because you see jesus when he was he went to the woman at the well and he even preached to the woman at the well and then the disciples came back and he had i mean you could you know when you have such a glorious time food is so far away you know just like i could never be hungry again in this presence you know that's probably how jesus was feeling because that was his daughter and she was like completely bound and now she's free and she's so happy she's just running telling everyone and i believe the lord was real happy about that and then here comes his disciples back having a good feed you know lord do you want some do you want some food lord he's like oh man there's no way i can eat right now you know i'm like i've got food to eat that you know not of one day you will know and she kind of tabernacle no they know what that food is and now the children when you're hungry now i'm sorry to like connect it to hunger but hey there it is we're all human call on the lord and eat the meat that we that this human body knows not of amen eat that meat because you see and it's for all of us for the service when you pull when you enter in that's why i say our those that aren't converted are absolutely depending on the lord and on those that are to enter in and to make the service supernatural by having an expectation by standing against the wiles and snares of the devil and making a stand for truth making a stand to you know when we go in there and we pray in the morning on sunday morning we're making a stand that this service will be god will take it and and lives will be changed and because this is coming right back to where we've got all the you know all the sin and all of the you know life is so tempting there's so much to go on and do and and your affections and what you love and enjoy becomes so full that god has no room and and and and if it and you you you come they see the young people they have to face this but if that young person comes into a service and all of a sudden everything they're thinking is being spoken by because you guys are pulling and everyone's pulling and there's an unconverted young person there and they need god they don't they probably don't think they need god and they probably don't even want to think like that because they're having their thing but there's a people pulling and there's a people that have got faith and they've made a stand and they're not going to let mind battles break the service anymore they're just gonna say no i stand for this i stand for a true servant i'm standing for the mind of christ i'm standing for the supernatural i'm standing for conversions of young people i'm standing for the refreshing and the revival of the holy ghost and everyone and you you start getting like that and start really standing for that and start fighting for it you watch there will be new births there will be an outpouring of the spirit and prophecies and supernatural gifts taking place again amen hallelujah and that person that thought that they were going to leave and go out and do something that they shouldn't do will be changed and they will come to meet the joy that they've been chasing all their life they'll come to meet the peace they've been wanting they'll come to meet the satisfaction that they tried alcohol drugs and all these women and everything to try and fill they meet the one that fills that sauce that gives them the joy unspeakable and full of glory oh my and my the burden is it that we make a stand so much that that happens because if they just sit in the service and and there's and it's just it just pl it sails on we're coasting right just coasting it's a good time and we get a good sermon and we have some good songs and there's a little bit of a move of god and it's nice and we leave and we've hit we feel good right but it can be more it can be so much more so much more we can have camp every service god's still the same god at camp as he is here what's the difference the expectation so just put off the camp expectation put up put it on now we're going to have camp amen just pull on the pull on the lord you know just really enter into make a stand in the morning sunday morning when the devil's fighting and howling whatever you go through make a stand put it all aside and and you want to sleep until 8 30 9 o'clock or whatever and just quickly whip into church just make a stand and say no sunday morning i'm getting up early i'm going to pray i'm going to break through i'm going to tear down some devils oh you're going to begin to speak and i'm going to be good to say you know what i'm going to make a stand for church i'm going to make a stand for the servers because there's young people and old people maybe i don't know but you know that need the holy ghost but they've been pulled and the affections and what you like and all in your mind it's full up full up with love books and social medias and whatever it may be that you love or you like we don't say we love those things but we certainly like them and sometimes that like but does become a bit of an affectionate love and it feels that but god wants that and you watch the joy and the dopamine that comes into your brain from most things will be five times better with god five ten million times better because you're connected to the source of your dopamine he created that i'm talking physical now physical feelings there's more than that it's greater soul feelings physics spiritual whatever but the physical side even who created those things who created your brain who created your the dopamine and the serotonin and all those happy chemicals who did it who made it who made the glands that they come out of in your mind when you react to situations who created the chemicals in your blood and in your body you know when you feel irritated and down depressed all those things anxious do you know that's just chemicals in your blood making you feel that way and you know that's a result that your spirit needing help your spirit has got problems and blockages and influences and all it takes is for you to make a stand a real stand and even today when we stand soon excuse the pun but we're going to make a real stand today we're going to refresh our stand amen who's ready hallelujah sorry to go a bit longer i'll be five minutes can i have five minutes okay lord help me to just share this because this is such a kind loving thing and i really just pray that the lord will make this personal he says in revelation 5 6 and 7 he says and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb hallelujah this is the standing that i've been talking about the whole time in this generation because this happened in 1963. it was 2 000 years of his blood and it was in in he and and the sacrifice of christ on the mercy seat as the mercy seat to intercede for the sins of the church so the church could come out of sin and be saved and come into the presence of god through redemption by blood but the mercy seat himself would come and move it's still the same mercy it's still the same god but the lamb the one that paid for our sin would stand and he would begin to change the dispensation and it would happen over a period of time but in vision we see it in one instant event but the actual event takes place over many years and is still taking place because it has to take place not just in one person but in a mini-membered body all over the world for the last 30 50 60 years it's been taking place because it has to happen to you he did this in eternity but the same lamb has to come to you you've got to meet mercy right who believes that you've got to meet him he's got to stand and you've got to meet the one that stands for you and behold and stood a lamb as it had been slain so here you have now a lamb the lamb of god our precious kinsmen redeemer jesus christ who was born in the in the flesh and he lived on the earth and he stood for you on the earth he stood for you and face the religiosity and all those powers of darkness he stood for you and faced rome and then in gethsemane he stood for you and faced the sin of the whole world war your shame bore your iniquities he he and and and stood against all all the lies and everything that would ever happen to the human race he stood for you on the earth then he carried that cross he was crucified and he stood for you on calvary amen then he was taken down into hell and he stood for you in hell and he stood for you and he took the keys off the devil for you in hell and now he stands with the keys of hell and death in his and his hand he stood for you in hell then he was raised up and he stood for now he stands for you here after two thousand years because his body was taken up and as a sacrifice was there for two thousand years but then right at the end he would come in a spirit form to come and get you but first as a man as a human he would have to the book of redemption everything that adam lost everything that was lost to adam and all of the creative power and the ownership of all of it was in the hands of the invisible god but a human being that's why god himself became a human and said i'm taking it back now a human has it all again and he stood there in heaven and he took it and he loosed the seals like i said before and he uttered and seven thunders uttered their voices and the power that was contained in the seal book was released and michael has come down into you with this to ensure that you come in a rapture are you with me this is great things like oh man i wish i could do it justice you know but yeah the lord can reveal it hallelujah stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth the messengers of the seven church ages had had a portion of god but then at the end the lamb himself would come himself right who who catches that is everyone clear says and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne so the inheritance of adam the inheritance of the human race when god said to adam it's all yours take it have dominion over it all it came back into the hands of the second adam jesus christ our kinsmen but do you think that he's just going to go yeah it's mine ha ha whoa i got it all now no you know what he did amen he doesn't want to keep it to himself he wants to say i've got a i've got a family i've got kinfolk i've got people that are part of me hey man she came out of me on the cross just like eve came out of adam and the and when he went to sleep and the woman came out well here comes a bride came out of me and i'm going to collect her over the next 2000 years one by one i'm going to bring them all out and i'm going to and then right at the end there's going to be a people that they're going to not even they're going to conquer even death itself but they're going to need something they're going to need something a little more than every other age ever had that's why in 1963 amen of dispensation began to change a new day begin to dawn alleluia the lord would he would he would say okay gabriel michael all of you i'm just gonna go down i'm gonna go down into the furnace like i went down into the furnace of the four the three amen in babylon i'm gonna go down into the furnace of satan's eden and i'm gonna rescue my bride hallelujah i stood for her in heaven and i'm gonna go stand for her on the earth again amen not in physical now the physical body is still up there atoning his mercy seat still open hey man who's gonna have the mercy seat still open but god in a spirit film michael an angelic form would come down and deliver a message to deliver his people i have to make this quick that's why i'm going back to my notes revelation 10 1 and 2. [Music] i just want you to know that he stood in the heaven he stood on the earth and the flesh he paid for it all then he let he he sat on his throne for 2000 years interceding but not the church never got raptured until one day the church has to be raptured they need something more who's glad that you're getting something more today are you glad you're getting something that's going to rapture your body you're getting something that's more than they've ever had hallelujah if he had given this if he had stood like there i read in revelation 5 took the book and opened it and and paul's day they would have gone on rapture because all of the inheritance was given back so what did he do he waited but he led his blood into seed and they came to a certain place then they died they thought they were getting raptured they actually thought that that was the rapture you know and paul had to say hold on a minute you guys are getting ahead of yourself here when the lord comes these things will be and we know that these things are right we just i'm not going to go into prophecies and everything right now but we know who knows that we're in the day and all the signs and everything is showing this is rapture day and so we know that our god stood for us on the earth he stood for us in gethsemane he stood for us on calvary he stood for us in hell he stood for us in abraham's bosom he stood for us back in his resurrected body then he said to mary don't touch me yet i'm going to go stand for you in heaven and he stood for her in heaven he stood for you in heaven amen amen oh he sat on the throne and then one day in 1963 he stood and he uh our kinsmen oh my our man that's my man that's my hero my hero hallelujah he stood for me i don't know he stood up and he said i'm gonna take that back and say father give me the book back i'm a human being actually same person but it's all in symbol form to show that the inheritance and it wasn't really a book but it was symbol right that's the inheritance the book symbolizes the deed the title deed the inheritance right the paperwork but it's spiritual paperwork amen and he said and that symboly but it came back and now a human has it again didn't keep it to himself he stood for you now he's about to hold and he's about to deliver it watch he's about to stand for you on the earth again and i saw now after revelation 9 who knows revelation 9 when it says that a a star fell and and opened the pit of hell and came out on all the earth and blocked the sun and blocked the air and all these demon powers and world war one and world war ii began to come open and all the sciences and men left god and it all just turned dark but then remember that god did not leave his people in darkness because when that opened then this happened and i saw another mighty angel not falling coming down from god out of heaven with a cloud and a rainbow was about his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire now watch the position that he comes to and he had in his hand a little book open amen so who was it who took the book before kinsman hallelujah can you see it a kinsmen took the book lm who'd been slain oh glory now he's now he's coming down to the earth what's he coming down to do to stand for you he's come down to the earth to stand for you oh my that's why we can say in revelation 12 rejoice you christians rejoice yes hallelujah because there's someone standing for you like i said he stood for you in all those places and now he's coming down here in 63 it says here and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth that looks like a bit of a standing position to me amen his right foot upon the left on the sea right on the earth what is that see is rome the first babylon religious babylon the earth is mystery babylon which is california california hollywood is mystery as the second babylon revelation 18 shows two babylons one babylon's the religious one the second one is the big millstone that gets cast into the sea which all the abominations and all the songs and all the people with the harps and all of that what is it oh my metallica slayer what are these great beatles oh they're from england but anyway you know all of these all of the music and all of the movies and everything that's come out of it to what destroy and a prophet stood in 1965 when he was preaching choosing of the bride and the lord began to take over and he said o capernaum capernaum how you were cast into the sea so shall it be for los angeles you should the the this whole land will be the judgment of god is belching beneath you and you shall be cast into the sea and and the sea will come all the way up to the salton sea there is and he explained in prophecy all the stuff that was going on underneath california they didn't even know about one year later science discovered that all of california is covered in honeycomb and this like lead layer that's just it would perfectly slide right into the ocean millions and millions of people are going to die it's a prophecy and it's revelation 18 the millstone will be cast into the sea judgment because the devil sits in there he's got he's actually got his own palace loose luciferian worshipers real true witches and wizards the ones that know him and worship him and follow him have he's got a mansion in california hotel california the eagles sing about it has anyone heard no of hotel that is satan's throne he has a throne there it is literally the seat and the other seat is well roman catholic church the vatican two babylons who comes down to santa's feet upon the power of religion and the power of hollywood and california the two babylons where all the evil has spurned out from he's come to stand for you he's standing there for you that's still going on but he's doing it for you do you know how it happened this is really personal now that picture happened in symbol to show what would happen when you received the holy ghost because what does the lord do after the message is gone this is why i say we stand for this message because he takes that book right in revelation 10 and he talks about all the thunder's coming out everything then he says and and he says and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all these mysteries shall be finished so he's saying that here comes this one that's to stand for us he takes this and he begins to give it to a prophet in this generation and the prophet preaches this message he preaches it and then that gets caught up on tapes and now we have these tapes that we can listen to and receive it but not just that but the true true approach to god has been restored elijah restored the altar didn't he and how to approach god the altar is the approach of god elijah came his ministry was to restore the altar and to obviously bring judgment on ahab and jezebel and and and so here you have elijah coming in this day with a ministry to restore the approach to god to restore true baptism in the name of jesus christ to restore the revelation of the godhead to restore what is actually right and wrong so that you can approach the living god and get the real baptism of the holy ghost amen and anyone that maybe hasn't heard this message that really knows how to approach god will get the baptism of the holy ghost then they'll find this message because the holy ghost will lead them to the message he ain't going to lead them away hallelujah not the real baptism of the holy ghost the real baptism of the holy ghost is the lord coming to stand for you on the earth but not on this earth in this earth what does he do he comes down to stand on your spirit and on your flesh so that you can actually overcome there's no way else you can't overcome without that if you try you're gonna fail you're gonna fall you're gonna go to something else to find your comfort if you're finding comfort in other things make a stand today today is your day to make a stand and here is my final quote that i want to read can the musicians please come and maybe um here i stan is

years ago there was a great christian lived in the southwest united states his name was daniel curry a wonderful man a godly man a sainted man a real christian a man that everybody thought so much of such a wonderful person and the story goes that he died or went into a trance and he said as he as he went up to heaven of course when he died and when he got to the pearly gates the caretaker come to the door and said who are you he said i'm the evangelist daniel curry i've won thousands of souls to christ and i want to come in this morning my life's journey has ended on the earth i have no place

for you sid do you want to appeal your case he said sir what more can i do but appeal my case he said well then you can go to the whiteturn judgment and appeal your case there daniel curry said that he felt himself going through the space for about an hour said he come into a place it got lighter lighter lighter lighter said farther he went the lighter it got it was a hundred times a thousand times brighter than the sun it ever shined and he and said he was trembling trembling and said when he got in the middle of that light he heard a voice say was you perfect on the earth just come out of a light he said no i wasn't perfect he got to trembling said did you always play honest with everybody said no he said a few things come to my mind that i wasn't just exactly honest about said i i i guess i was i wasn't honest said did you tell the truth in every case in your life said no i remember some things i've told that was shady i never was truthful just exactly said then did you ever take anything that did not belong to you anything money anything else that didn't belong to you he said he thought on earth that he was pretty good but he was condemned said no no i've took things that didn't belong to me he said daniel wasn't perfect he said no i wasn't perfect said he was looking any minute for the blast to come from that great light from where the dove rested condemned said just then he heard a voice behind him that was sweeter than any mother's voice that he had ever heard said he turned to look and the sweetest face he ever saw sweeter than any mother's face was standing before him and he said father daniel curry stood for me down on the earth it's true he wasn't perfect but he stood for me he stood for me on earth now i'm going to stand for him in heaven
