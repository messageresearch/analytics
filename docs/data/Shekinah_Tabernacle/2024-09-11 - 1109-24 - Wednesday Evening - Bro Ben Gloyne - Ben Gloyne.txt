God bless you all tonight great to have you all here happy birthday birthday girl praise the Lord God bless you amen trusty had a real good day amen God bless you amen praise the Lord um how was the youth banquet and everything was it good yeah praise the Lord good awesome we watched one of the services look forward to getting the rest of them in so praise the Lord amen let's go on the scripture shall we to Ephesians chapter 2 um we have it here everything's working and then we're going to go to um yeah we're just going to go Ephesians chapter 2 actually we got it's prayer service tonight amen uh next Sunday we're having Youth service so it's going to be it's going to be good then the following Sunday after that last Sunday of the month we've got brother Greg Alfred from Christ coming so we're going to have a it's going to be a special time amen so Ephesians 2 and 1 I know very familiar um scripture to us all but amen let's um let's read this shall we and you have he quickened that's amazing the Apostle Paul's writing about you hallelujah amen who were dead and trespasses and sins R in times past you walked you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also so we all had our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover and he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you is saved and ha raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads in word of prayer tonight amen if you want to be remembered in prayer amen you want to raise your hand slip up your hand to the Lord say Lord Don't Pass Me By tonight amen gracious heavenly father thank you for the power of your word Lord we thank you that we have the ability to read your word and we want to say thank you so much that you're the god of your word and you're here to fulfill your word in our lives so Lord because of that we just completely surrender all that we are into your hands Lord may you have your way in this prayer service dear God may you just take complete control of every life here father those who may be streaming tonight Lord I pray you'd be their abundant portion as well and Lord I pray You' break every hindrance of the enemy Lord Break Every Chain father Lord of him in the name of Jesus Christ and may you be glorified when all is said and done we love you Lord we thank you we ask you'd cover us in your blood once again and have your way Lord in Jesus Christ's name for your glory amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to talk about this here as we go into prayer I want to talk about uh defeating the prince of the power of the air and that and that word air means atmosphere now we understand that the devil brings storms you know he's the one who brings hurricanes and Cyclones and all these things he's because uh when when when Adam fell from his position the devil took his position and he has dominion over nature but he also wants to ruin your atmosphere I mean he's not just content with sending hurricanes and Cyclones and typhoons and storms and whatever it may be blizzards and and you know floods and all those things but he wants to he wants to ruin your atmosphere he doesn't want us to have a good atmosphere who like no one likes a a bad storm I was going to say a good storm there's no such thing as a good storm no one loves a you know watching all of their household goods and their houses being blown away by a hurricane or being Swept Away by a tsunami no one enjoys that and so the devil wants to do that in the spiritual not just the natural but we have authority over him in the name of Jesus Christ now now the devil he so what he does is we know that uh we we are we are atmosphere generators right amen amen if you want to create a good atmosphere you speak good things right if you want to create a bad atmosphere do the opposite you'll create an atmosphere either way that's right amen nothing you do will be neutral am mean it will it will it will create a result and um the devil wants us to create a bad atmosphere he wants us to agree with him and then he will have his way so you know he wants us to have an atmosphere of being moody and gloomy and down and desponded and depressed and he puts those thoughts in our mind and he wants us to dwell on those thoughts wants us to welcome them and and Ponder on them and meditate upon them and and the more we do the gloomier it gets the more the Wind Blows the more the dark clouds seem to come down the fog comes and you know just seem such a terrible kind of a no one likes Gloom me are you all Sunshine people yeah praise God I'm me Hallelujah hello choir good to talk to you amen yeah preaching to the Cho everyone loves Sunshine right the devil hates Sunshine amen so he wants us to be gloomy down and despondent but we have authority by the by the power of God's word to cast him out amen and we have discernment to recognize it's not us that makes the gloomy atmosphere it's not our family members not our work colleagues not our schoolmates it's the devil causing them am mean but you but you have the ability to stop it affecting you see see the see it's got to stop somewhere why not with you amen why not be that seaw wall why not be that thing that you know sends the storm away like Jesus stood on the bow of the boat none of the other disciples did it but Jesus did himself proving he was the god of creation saying peace be still and he doesn't just want to speak peace to Natural storms he wants to speak peace to spiritual storms amen but the thing is he uses your body to do it that's right right he uses your body to do it so whose lips are we going to use he's going to use your lips amen you have the authority to do it amen amen because remember this is the devil's job the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy that's what that's what his job is to do see anything that steals your joy steals your faith steals your hope or your expectation the Lord's going to do something steals your long range Vision that God's going to bring everything for his good that's the thief right he wants to Blind us over he wants to make us look at the situ situations look at the trouble look at all those things so he's stealing amen the Deliverance that God has for you and he wants to steal your Victory but that's not the end of the verse but I am come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly amen so the Lord has come to give us Abundant Life the devil wants to take life but God wants to give us Abundant Life joy in the Holy Ghost amen the power of God on display a piece that passes all understanding because you realize when that storm was around Jesus the storm wasn't in Jesus right the storm can be all around you you can say no that's not that person that's not me it doesn't belong to me I'm not putting up with this thing amen amen you have the authority to do it because remember we have been see Heavenly plac in Christ Jesus is our position in Christ we're joint ear with Christ and he has a name above all names amen he's so lifted up so high he's going to look way down just to see Heaven he has a position far above all things and we're joining is with him right so and Heath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that means he's caused you to have a position above the devil amen that means he's caused you to have authority over every enemy absolutely and it's not you that gets there he's made you get there amen amen thank you Lord praise the Lord so now but see the devil wants us to have storms of anxiousness this is a very anxious age we live in everyone gets stressed about something why do we have to be stressed it doesn't mean the trouble goes away but why do we have to be worried about it we have one greater than the trouble amen like it says in Philippians rejoice in the Lord all way and again I say rejoice that's a good that's a good key to get rid of Gloom rejoice in the lord well I've got to feel like rejoicing no you just start rejoicing you start remembering his promises start remembering what he did for you you may feel as dead as a post that doesn't matter cuz when to go into it we don't walk by feelings the world is very much walking by feelings there a presidential campaign at the moment going on and it's all the vibe she's trying to win the White House by Vibe she's trying to get the most powerful position on the Earth by A vibe we don't live by Vibe we don't go by we're just vibing it see how it goes no we walk by faith and not by Vibe okay bringing in today hash not Vibe the Rapture is not going to be by Vibe okay I just don't feel the vibe well you forget what what is that anyway let's not even go there but you know we don't walk by that we walk by faith a revelation amen so so you know like Paul and Silas they're in a jail a jail especially in those days was not underfloor heating three meals a day kind of deal we have today a a bed no rats no mice no no you know dry sanitary it's that wasn't the jail they were in so they could have either let the atmosphere of the jail and the atmosphere of the beatings they had in their body body and the pain and the rejection they just experienced they could let that rule their atmosphere but they they chose no actually God's allowed Us in this dungeon why I don't know but we're going to praise God anyway and they began to testify and praise God and sing and it says about midnight you know then they sang and presence of God came down and broke broke that place open yeah why because they decided not to go by the vibe of the jail amen they went to they're walking by Revelation amen amen so I say you don't have to feel Rejoice F however that is feel happy to Rejoice he says rejoice in the lord always way and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful and that word careful actually means anxious be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God so by prayer and supplication that's asking but with Thanksgiving hallelujah how thankful are our prayers our prayer should be I think incredibly thankful amen hallelujah thank you well you so I don't know how to pray start thanking God for what he's done for you and by the time you've got through half of that I think you'll be feeling a little bit happy I think you'll be rejoicing amen who's ever experienced that you're down in the dumps and then you begin to thank God for what he's done and then you start to thank for what he's done in your life and that Gloom has just pushed out the window and you're having a jubilee because why being thankful and rejoicing brings the promises alive see the devil wants to steal it from you but it brings the promises in close Lord amen hallelujah praise God so don't be anxious for it see anxiousness does not help anyone even brother Braham said you know if he knew he was going to get shot in the morning what good would do to worry about it he said that but believing faith can deliver worrying has not helped anyone amen and the peace of God so so if you make your request if see everything so don't be anxious about it but give it to the Lord in prayer and supplicate with s uh and supplication with Thanksgiving make your request known to God so don't hold it in let it out right if you're anxious it's all bouncing around in here but when you've given it to God it ain't bouncing in here anymore it's at his throne right and then if you do that then the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your heart and mind through Christ Jesus so if you do that then your emotions are going to be kept by Jesus Christ amen that's a good one to be the Upp and Downer in life right amen he says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things that's going to get the Gloom away amen because remember we don't walk by feeling right the Apostle Paul would say that he doesn't run uncertainly but he runs certainly and he fights you know I therefore so run not as uncertainly so not just a stab in the dark hit and miss kind of a deal he's running with with uh determination but with purpose right and so he fights not as one that beateth the air so someone who's beating the ear is basically shooting the breeze just let's just fire a shot and see what happens no that's not how the Apostle Paul says he walks a Christian walk right he does it with purpose and so that one that beateth the ear as if you're trying to go by emotion amen you see a lot of people that try and work themselves up into Faith they think it takes an emotional St step ladder to get into Faith but no faith is choosing to take God at his word amen that's what see Faith starts with a choice do you choose to believe the promise or do you not right faith says I choose to believe that I choose to believe God is able to do it Lord amen that's how Faith starts right then of course it becomes a revelation but you've got to choose to accept it first I need a big Thunderbolt choose to accept it first I need the fire of God to move choose to accept it first why do you think you know God moves in church cuz we choose to accept he's the god of Revival he we choose to accept he's the same yesterday today and forever we have chosen to accept that he's the same God in the prophet's Ministry is the same today we've chosen to accept that right and it's become Faith it's become reality but first we had to choose to accept it hallelujah amen so we don't we don't work ourselves up into something because you're just beating the a there the prophet being here that's just that's just beating the air so that's fighting un uh you not being certain but we want to walk certainly that's right with purpose right we don't want to do stab in the dark hit Miss no we're not here the message did not come for us to try something and see what happens no we're walking because we've seen the light shine we see his promises are true and we and we've seen him perform them have we not yes that's why we walk this walk that's and we know the message reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture we know it it's a certain sound so we're not fighting the air right uh trust everyone's here today amen see we don't let me just read this now it's not just something that you kindly push yourself to I've noticed so much that in my meetings that people try and work themselves up into something just to make them believe now you can't do that you're just beating the air but faith is something that's just as calm and settled as it can be remember feelings is not Faith but faith will bring feelings right take the faith first and then whatever ever follows is fine right but don't say I've got to feel a certain way for Faith to take action right remember I've shared it many times with an with her tongue tie being a baby we prayed that his that the Lord would loose her tongue She was booked in for a surgery but you know we prayed for her I felt as dead as a post but yeah we prayed and just asked the Lord Lord before the surgeon ever cuts her tongue may that tongue tie be gone I think it was a week later Christine took her to the hospital for the appointment it wasn't just a small snpp it was a bigger operation she needed and you know I think when she took took her to the hospital your Christine saw blood in her mouth but she was a happy baby and then when the doctor opened her mouth to do the operation he said there's no tongue tie here her tongue had been loosed perfectly did I feel anything no but I believed it amen right and sometimes you feel like you're 10 million foot high and you could take everything you know you but but we don't go by feeling right it's like when I was in the Solomons you I shared that how you there's that demon possessed teenage girl and you know praying for her and I was asking Lord you need to do something and I felt the love of God com over me then that that she's a soul just like me so what so Divine love projected Sovereign Grace took over and she was freed and I heard a couple of weeks ago she's serving God today amen praise the Lord so you know but so we go by faith Hallelujah just choose faith it works right don't go by I need a feeling first no because the devil will whip you around by your feelings I need to I need a Vibe no you don't need a Vibe just take God at his word hallelujah amen see it's taking God at his word and having the Assurance in your heart that God is able to keep that what he has said that he would do and will perform everything that he said he would do that's what faith is amen it's just calm and settle as it can be God's able to do it amen you can do it Lord amen amen so so we're not trusting in Emotion I'm an emotional person even people who are resentful is an emotion people who are offended is an emot all the negative emotion still emotion right but so I believe in the positive emotion I believe in crying and shouting and running and all I'm all for that right I'm not a Methodist stachi guy or Anglican or you know I believe in a heartfelt religion it should be heartfelt but take Faith first and then everything else will follow amen so we're not going by emotion we're going by faith and then let Faith do what it wants amen as it says in Psalms 20 here uh now know that I the Lord saveth his anointed he's talking about me there he's talking about you are are you the Lord's anointed amen amen the bride is an anointed bride body amen of Jesus Christ amen now I know that I uh I that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven when the uh with the saving strength of his right hand amen some sorry some trust in chariots some trust in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God Amen so some trust in their abilities but we remember the name of the Lord amen amen because we got to realize now Faith is built solely upon what God has done amen amen amen just as Abraham in his great time of need he taking Isaac up the hill to sacrifice him you know and you know and um Isaac saying here's the wood here's the fire but where's the burnt offering and uh Abraham says my son God will provide himself a lamb see what are you presenting to God I think I heard brother Steve brison Say say this I think it stands repeating what are you presenting to God when you when you come in prayer we're going we're having a prayer meeting tonight what do you present to God on your behalf is it your conduct is it your ability is it what you think you are in terms of what you have done or are you are you presenting your lamb Hallelujah are you because remember God accepts a sacrifice it's got to be a perfect sacrifice and that sacrifice cannot be our ability as a Christian because even brother Bram said I'd hate to try and get to heaven on my Visions on my preaching on any Miracles I'm only trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ to get me to heaven now if a Vindicated prophet of God could say that with the most Supernatural Ministry that's on record I think I can say that too amen right so so we're not trusting in our ability to approach God we're trusting on what he has provided see the Lord will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering amen and the Lord has provided himself a lamb it's a perfect lamb remember in the Old Testament the the worshipper was never examined and maybe if the worshipper brought his lamb and was trying to talk to the priest about all he had done all he was doing the priest would have told the worshipper you are just hindering the process get out of the way I got to examine the lamb I'm not here to question you there's no questioning booth for you get out of here amen I'm focusing on this lamb see the see the priest's Focus was on the lamb if the lamb was perfect the lamb first had to be examined and if his examine and he is found perfect and that lamb was offered on behalf of the worshipper and the worshipper could go away justif ifed because of what the lamb has done for him amen and it's the same thing with us see there will be people who come in the end time and it says in Matthew 7 Lord have we not cast out devils in your name have we not done many mighty things in your name they're trying to buy their way into Heaven by what God what by what their gift has done in their life it's not about what gifts have done in people's lives it's the life of Jesus Christ in the person that the word of God is fulfilled through them that the character of Christ is manifested in their Liv that's what it's got to be we don't get to Heaven by how gifted we are no it's by the Life of Christ in us the fruit of the spirit on display people should see that we are Christians more than our here and dress and whatever how it no it should be a life that's lived it's not our human life it's his life living through us that's what people must see not by not by any kind of gift we have I'm I know I'm looking at some very gifted people all of you are actually very gifted people whether you know it or not but we're not getting to Heaven by a gift we we into him by the blood of Jesus Christ am me that's why it's so important what happened for the father of the faith God will provide himself a lamb as the same will happen has happened for the children of Abraham amen the spiritual children of Abraham so you got to realize now when you go before God you've got to realize God accepts your sacrifice and that sacrifice he has provided for you cuz he did he knew man would not be able to produce a good enough sacrifice that's why religion and denomination and Christianity with man's ideas and ejected into it has miserably failed amen but when we come back to the word of God and the purity of that it is then what happens the lamb steps forth on our behalf that's why when you follow the word of God God vindicates that word am mean how many people have repented being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and receive the Holy Ghost why because you've come God's provided way that he instituted and you've got the results haven't come man's way it's not man's opinion that wasn't Peter's idea that was God idea yeah amen amen see so when we come in prayer we have a lamb that's been offered on our behalf so we don't come we don't come if we've had a good day we don't come if we've had a good week or a bad week or an average week or a hard week or an in between week no we come because God's provided a lamb praise God now brother Bram asked this question in the uh it's in the church H book from the Philadelphia and church AG do we really accept this reality in Christ that it's nothing but the blood no sir even through Luther brought the truth of justification the romanist church and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it's Christ or perish and it's not even Christ and works it is Christ alone so it's not the lamb and what you have done amen it's not the lamb it's not the lamb and the worshipper that helps the worshipper it's all the lamb amen amen see don't make you perfect it's Christ or perish it's not even Christ and works it's Christ Alone this age began the years of Armenian ISM that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood for it sings nothing but the blood and my own Good Conduct now I believe in Good Conduct if you're saved you'll do righteously we've already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it's not Jesus and you am that's the Plus Part amen it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it's all God so when you f when he first calls you it's him when you give your life to him it's him because it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance amen right our walk is him our body change will be him hallelujah it's all the Lord hallelujah hey amen from start to finish it's all God let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my mouth my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life hallelujah amen prise the Lord hallelujah so we can we we can come before God with a full assurance that our lamb Works amen amen we've going to had countless testimonies proving this lamb works not just here but all around the world there's people that have accepted this same word the same lamb and it's worked like he promised it would work in their lives amen doesn't matter what people have come out of drugs and alcohol prostitution religion the world Whatever It Is God has cleansed them transformed them because they've accepted the lamb and not their own good works I mean they haven't accepted what man has done no it's only what God has done that they have accepted and it's transform their lives have' come God's provided way now so if we have a lamb that that that has been provided for us now we know that the that the Holy Ghost was in is in Jesus Christ right so when Jesus died on Calvary that Spirit came out of him amen the life of the sacrifice came out and then it came into the church and The Upper Room amen connecting them in their sacrifices one now in the Old Testament that could never happen because the life of a lamb could never come into the life of a human and change them to be a lamb nature so the nature of the Lamb could never come into a human because the life is different okay but now the life of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes into you and I amen men and changes us that he changes our nature to be like his own nature amen so now that connects you and your sacrifice together so now when you go before God you can present your sacrifice on your behalf amen brother R would say this is is that when you pray amen you must present your token with your prayer which is the holy you got to realize that you the only way you approach God is is by the blood amen that's right to me this is liberating cuz there's nothing that I need to do to I'm ready now no he made me ready amen I gave my life to me transformed me fill me with his holy spirit cleanses me continually Chang me makes you know changes me what he's made me ready amen he's made me fit to come into His presence amen he's made me fit to talk to him hallelujah amen amen so so to me that takes the pressure off because this is not by human ability amen praise God you just got to surrender and let him do the work amen now he says now when we realize and present the token the life it took for the token the blood speaks for us remember the Covenant blood was recognized with the token and the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign that the purchase has been made for us so when you receive the Holy Ghost that's the assurance that you're bought am amen amen that's the that's the proof you're not your own and you're certainly not the Devils you're gods and what God buys he keeps he doesn't lose what he keeps I mean I mean doesn't lose what he buys hallelujah amen amen the token is a sign that the purchase is made for us now if you're not included in that well of course you'll never get nothing just walking through a prayer line walking back out walking up to the altar looking up walking back out oh brother but when the token is once placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you something is happening there isn't nothing going to turn you you know where you belong full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the token and nothing else blesses he that does all of his Commandments that he might have the right to the tree of life now I'm just going to cut down a scare pray right there because people hear those words full obedience to the full word of God and tells you to the Token then they start putting a list in front of them themselves have I obeyed all these things right that's what people that's what the devil sure does have you met this criteria because remember he wants to put the onus or the pressure or the whatever it is upon you right he wants to put the focus on you but God never wants the focus on you and your ability he wants your focus to be on your lamb amen amen so now we have the C he says now when we pray then we must present the token Lord I have fully obeyed you now look where he's so he's quoting acts 238 here okay I have repented of my sins I feel that you have forgiven me I've been baptized into the name of Jesus Christ the holy spirit is upon me now I have need of a certain thing for your glory Lord so what's he saying full obedience to the to the full word of God is acts 238 repent and and I could have brought out more quotes than just this one that he goes beyond a shadow of a doubt to say full obedience is not a big checklist of things you have to do it's repent turn from your sin give your life completely to God fully surrender let him take over be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which is the token Hallelujah who you say Lord I fully obeyed your word amen amen now I can now I can present my token with my pray now I've got Assurance God hears me because of what he has done amen now I need to have a certain thing for your glory Lord I ask it it's mine now then there is something that anchors back here few few it's yours it's over then it's all over it's all over it SLE I ask for this I ask for it I must have it C see I want it For Your Glory see well that's it then he gives it to you then you know it's yours that's the way it is our children so forth we apply the blood believe it that that's all all right it's that I know it's very simple but God is simple Hallelujah God is is Christ in Simplicity amen so we have full Assurance I wanted to speak these things to say we have full Assurance because of the token right because we're not coming to God based on our own ability we have come because of his ability what he has done and we present him B basically back to himself Lord You've covered me in your blood you don't see me anyway Lord you see your blood you hear my voice through the blood hallelujah amen and because of this we have full Assurance now that we can whatever we ask the Lord we shall receive if two agree on Earth concerning anything the Lord says he'll do it amen that's why we're going to have a time asking for prayer requests amen when you hear a prayer request just say Lord in My Heart Lord I agree with that brother I agree with that sister Lord may you may you do that for your glory Lord that's why there's agreement there's got to be agreement together amen Lord and then you'll see God on the scene like never before I'm just going to finish with that amen so what do you start doing get all the Gloom away remember you feel stressed anxious worried upset that's a storm coming in what do you do just it comes in one door open the window let it go out the window Amen Let it pass through amen how do you make it pass through start thinking on what the Lord has done for you start rejoicing in what he has done it'll change your thinking it'll it'll turn the sunlight on like Paul and Silas did amen and then now you got to realize when you got a lord in prayer it's not your ability that gets access it's what he has done for you grants you access to his throne so that's all I wanted to say tonight amen so let's have the let's have the musicians please I want to sing that
