[0:24] welcome to Global answers please join us
[0:27] as we discuss the relevance of God's
[0:29] eternal word relating to events in this
[0:32] day and what it means to you and now
[0:36] your host Lonnie
[0:38] Jenkins Hello friends welcome back again
[0:41] thank you for joining us again we're in
[0:43] the middle of a study for those of you
[0:45] that haven't been with us uh we may
[0:47] leave you with some question marks but
[0:49] you can write to us and we can fill in
[0:51] the gaps for you our study has been on
[0:54] the godhead is he one is he two is he
[0:57] three and we went through scriptures
[0:59] that you could from certain scriptures
[1:01] say yes he's one yes he's two yes he's
[1:03] three in fact there's some you can come
[1:05] up with maybe even more because it talks
[1:07] about the seven spirits of God so
[1:09] there's it's a big big study but it is
[1:12] an important study and so I want to read
[1:15] a scripture to you and um we'll pick up
[1:19] we'll pick up from there and go on we're
[1:21] using some graphics to show you
[1:23] illustrate to you the very subjects that
[1:25] we're we're we're talking about I'd like
[1:28] to read to you from from the Gospel of
[1:31] John 14: 16 and I will pray the father
[1:35] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:37] Jesus was their comforter and now
[1:39] they're looking for another one that he
[1:42] may abide with you forever of course
[1:44] that's going to be sending the Holy
[1:45] Ghost even the spirit of Truth whom the
[1:48] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:50] him not neither knoweth him but you know
[1:53] him so notice now they haven't known the
[1:55] Holy Ghost this is before Pentecost and
[1:58] yet here's Jesus saying you know him why
[2:01] because it's the same spirit that was in
[2:03] him that logos life for he dwelleth with
[2:08] you that Christ that anointing that
[2:11] logos that was in Jesus and shall be in
[2:15] you so in the Old Testament it's God
[2:18] above us with Jesus it's God With Us
[2:22] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[2:24] God in
[2:25] us Verse 18 I will not leave you
[2:29] comfortless
[2:30] I will come to you yet a little while in
[2:33] the world sees me no more but you shall
[2:36] see me because I live you shall live
[2:39] also at that day you shall know that I
[2:42] am in the father and you in me and I in
[2:47] you if that's a little bit of a mystery
[2:49] to you let me read it to you again at
[2:52] that day believe it or not that's this
[2:55] day you shall know that I am in the
[2:58] father Jesus speaking and you in me and
[3:02] I in you let's continue on with our
[3:05] study now we had taken our subject of
[3:08] Jesus
[3:09] Christ and we started way back when
[3:12] Jesus when excuse me when the invisible
[3:15] God wanted to declare himself this is
[3:18] back before there was an air an atom a
[3:22] molecule a sun a moon a earth nothing
[3:24] just the Eternal God and this eternal
[3:27] God had in him desires attributes things
[3:32] that he wanted to declare to his people
[3:34] that we might know him Jehovah the
[3:37] self-existing one who reveals
[3:39] himself so out of God then came this
[3:42] form this body that's called in in in
[3:45] biblical terms a Celestial body in in
[3:48] theological terms
[3:59] and once this came out from God it was
[4:02] the son of God in a prefigure now making
[4:05] the eternal spirit a father because out
[4:07] from him had come something but now the
[4:11] father of the life of every father is in
[4:14] the blood that's in the child and so now
[4:17] we F we found as we traced it through
[4:20] that when the logos came out from God
[4:22] God actually stepped into that form and
[4:25] that form we know as Christ so if the
[4:28] purpose of the the first Son of God was
[4:32] to declare the father and we find that
[4:35] repeated in John when the logos was made
[4:38] flesh the word was made flesh that his
[4:40] purpose was to declare the father then
[4:43] that would be our purpose also as
[4:45] children of God our purpose is to
[4:47] declare the father so we trace the logos
[4:50] on down through we saw various
[4:52] manifestations in the Old Testament one
[4:54] was melchisedek a king of Salem without
[4:57] father without mother without beginning
[4:59] of days or end of life God making a
[5:01] materialization and manifesting himself
[5:03] to Abraham there's some types and
[5:05] shadows there that we don't have time to
[5:07] get into but they're very interesting
[5:09] some other time we may we may we may
[5:11] touch on those and then Christ was that
[5:15] uh Pillar of Fire by night and Cloud by
[5:18] day that led the children of Israel
[5:20] taking on various forms when Moses said
[5:23] let me see your glory he saw him as the
[5:26] back part of a man God taking on a form
[5:29] God takes on any form he wants but it
[5:32] can still be the life of God in that
[5:35] form in varying measures and then we
[5:38] came following the word all the way up
[5:41] now until the word is going to be made
[5:43] flesh and then now on the screen you'll
[5:45] see Joseph and Mary standing sitting by
[5:49] the Christ child in the manger and then
[5:52] that Christ child was the word made
[5:56] flesh so this logos emblem that we've
[5:58] been looking at all the attributes of
[6:01] God are dropped into that little child
[6:03] now but the actual logos life that we
[6:06] see above in the picture there was not
[6:09] yet into the child that didn't happen to
[6:11] Jesus until the River Jordan now we get
[6:14] to Jesus at the River Jordan the word
[6:17] went to the prophet Jesus was the word
[6:20] the word joins to the prophet the word
[6:21] of the Lord comes to the prophet the
[6:23] Bible says and then now with Jesus in
[6:26] the water the scripture says that the
[6:29] spirit of God like a Dove came down into
[6:33] that vessel now God has joined himself
[6:37] to the word or now the word is quickened
[6:40] into manifestation and now we have the
[6:43] fullness of the godhead bodily on Earth
[6:45] in a tabernacle called Jesus Christ so
[6:49] Jesus now is the fullness of God prior
[6:51] he was the word but not yet Quicken to
[6:54] manifestation now he moves into his
[6:57] ministry now John uh John the Baptist
[7:00] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[7:02] the Lord and we had an event in June
[7:05] 1933 that uh probably almost no of you
[7:09] none of you know about but on the Ohio
[7:12] River right here in the United States as
[7:15] a man named William brandham was down on
[7:17] the Ohio River baptizing converts there
[7:20] came a great light down out from heaven
[7:22] and a voice spoke out from that light
[7:25] and said as John the Baptist will
[7:27] forerun the second coming of the Lord
[7:29] Lord so your message your word will
[7:32] forerun the coming word and so we've
[7:35] already had an announcement the ministry
[7:38] didn't begin in fullness until until the
[7:41] very actually the very same time that
[7:43] Israel became a nation around 1946 47
[7:46] that's that's when this ministry began
[7:48] to be and actually started a Revival
[7:50] among the Pentecostal Pentecostal
[7:54] people now back to our godhead bodily
[7:57] when Jesus went to goo excuse me went to
[8:03] pre In The Garden of
[8:06] Gethsemane there he committed himself to
[8:09] Calvary and the spirit of God lifted
[8:11] from him because he couldn't die with
[8:14] eternal life in him now remember he was
[8:16] the word who was quickened now the
[8:19] quickening power lifts from him there
[8:21] because he can't die with eternal life
[8:23] in him so that's why we're showing you
[8:25] this image with the dove above him now
[8:28] because that same life that made him the
[8:30] fullness of God had to move back but yet
[8:32] he's still the word so consequently this
[8:35] word on the cross means that all those
[8:37] attributes of God which would include
[8:40] you and I whose names are on the Lamb's
[8:42] Book of Life those who are there these
[8:45] attributes of God were still in him
[8:47] because he went to Calvary the fullness
[8:49] of the word so then in then all those
[8:52] whose names were on the Lamb's Book of
[8:54] Life here here this whole the whole book
[8:57] is represented in him here
[9:00] all those names that were on the Lamb's
[9:02] Book of Life are now nailed to the cross
[9:06] so in symbolism you paid your price in
[9:10] him on Calvary and then your recognition
[9:14] of the word that God sends to the age
[9:18] identifies you back to the blood of
[9:21] Jesus Christ that you can claim what he
[9:24] did for you now if you want scripture
[9:26] for that that's 1 John 1:7
[9:29] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[9:33] light we have Fellowship one with
[9:35] another that's you and God and the blood
[9:37] of his son cleanses us from all sin so
[9:40] therefore it's recognizing what God is
[9:42] doing in your day that links you back to
[9:45] Calvary where all those whose names are
[9:48] on the Lamb's Book of Life the
[9:50] revelations 13 says that will not be
[9:52] deceived by the Beast system they're
[9:54] identified here you're identified here
[9:58] and the joy part of it is you can't be
[10:00] charged for the crime again you already
[10:03] paid your price in Jesus when Jesus then
[10:06] died he was with his Saints there for a
[10:09] period of time on Earth and then he
[10:11] gathered them up on a mountain and then
[10:13] he ascended up to the throne and they
[10:15] all watched him in his in his Ascension
[10:19] now this is the part I went to he went
[10:21] up to the throne he's sitting on the
[10:22] father's Throne the scripture says not
[10:24] on his own Throne yet now here he is now
[10:27] we got him represented City sitting on
[10:29] his throne and then down on the right
[10:32] hand side there's there's that upper
[10:34] room down in Jerusalem now scripture has
[10:37] prophesied something's going to happen
[10:39] it's the day of Pentecost so that very
[10:41] life that was in him that quickening
[10:44] power separates out we've got our little
[10:46] Dove now representing that quickening
[10:48] power has to come down but it can't come
[10:51] in the form of a dove we find that it's
[10:54] that logos life that it goes into the
[10:57] upper room in the form of tongues the
[10:59] fire which is the pillar of fire
[11:02] breaking itself up now watch that again
[11:04] so that you get it when Jesus ascended
[11:07] on high Christ which is the logos had
[11:10] finished his work in that form the body
[11:14] that paid the price for our sins and so
[11:16] that form was no longer needed now it
[11:19] was going to become a many membered body
[11:21] so that same life now departs out of
[11:24] that body remember he said I am now with
[11:27] you but I shall be in you he goes down
[11:30] to the upper room now here's the
[11:32] scriptures that show you what's supposed
[11:35] to happen on at that
[11:37] time acts 2:1 and when the day of
[11:40] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[11:42] with one Accord in one place and
[11:44] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[11:46] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[11:48] filled all the house where they were
[11:49] sitting and there appeared under them
[11:52] clothing tongues like as of fire as it
[11:56] sat upon each of them and they were all
[11:58] filled filled with the Holy Ghost and
[12:00] began to speak with tongues as the
[12:02] spirit gave utterance so this cloven
[12:06] tongues of fire was actually the pillar
[12:08] of fire that Christ had taken in the for
[12:12] in the for that form in the Old
[12:14] Testament and was dwelling in fullness
[12:17] in Jesus of Nazareth he was the fullness
[12:19] of the godhead bodily now that same life
[12:22] was going to be in measure in the
[12:25] apostles and the Believers gathered in
[12:26] the upper room and so that same life now
[12:29] that was in him is going to be divided
[12:32] so that now God is Not dwelling in one
[12:35] body Jesus of Nazareth but now in the
[12:37] body of Believers the true church so
[12:40] it's not another God or another God
[12:42] person of the godhead but it's always
[12:45] the same God taking on these various
[12:47] forms I'd like for you to read with me
[12:49] what a prophet said about this subject
[12:52] you'll find some wonderful comparisons
[12:54] here now a double portion of Elijah's
[12:56] Spirit came on Elisha and he done Twice
[12:59] The Miracles that Elijah did in a double
[13:01] portion of the Holy Spirit now I want
[13:04] you to notice Elijah had a robe as a
[13:06] symbol a robe was what he was wrapped in
[13:10] and it was a symbol of the Holy Spirit
[13:12] and as he went up he watched and the
[13:14] robe fell back uh from The Chariot and
[13:17] he picked up the robe and laid it upon
[13:19] his own shoulders and went down to
[13:21] Jordan and started doing
[13:25] Miracles and Jesus the baptism that he
[13:28] was excuse me the baptism that he had
[13:31] was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[13:33] was in him that come on him at the River
[13:37] Jordan after he was baptized in water
[13:39] John bear record seeing the spirit of
[13:42] God like a dove coming upon him and
[13:44] notice then when he went up he sent back
[13:47] the same robe that he was wrapped in the
[13:49] Holy Spirit upon the church I don't know
[13:52] whether you've ever watch symbolism like
[13:54] this in the scripture or not Shadows
[13:56] laying and typed out but it's a
[13:58] wonderful thing to see once you begin to
[13:59] see these things how the scripture will
[14:01] open up to you in a much deeper meaning
[14:04] questions and answers from by the
[14:05] prophet of God
[14:07] 1964 when man was made in the image of
[14:10] God that's Genesis 1:26 and 27 that
[14:14] image was that logos form that we talked
[14:17] about previously and then God came down
[14:20] in the image of man that's when Jesus
[14:23] with the god stepped into the man Jesus
[14:25] the Tabernacle Jesus to redeem man
[14:29] that man and God that brought man and
[14:32] God together heavens and earth hugged
[14:35] and kissed each other God and man
[14:38] embraced each other as the fatherhood
[14:40] and sunship when the logos became flesh
[14:43] and dwelt Among Us Jesus said I came
[14:46] from God and I go to God is that right
[14:49] and after his death burial resurrection
[14:51] and Ascension when the body was taken up
[14:54] to sit at the right hand of God now I
[14:56] don't mean God's got a right hand God's
[14:58] a Spirit but at the right hand means in
[15:01] power and authority of God that in that
[15:04] name everything in heaven is named after
[15:08] it and subject to it continuing
[15:14] on everything in Earth is named after it
[15:17] and subject to it a name above all names
[15:20] Jesus Christ now this logos that was in
[15:23] him which was the spirit of God the
[15:26] anointing through that sanctifying Grace
[15:29] of the blood brought many sons to God
[15:31] which are anointed with that same
[15:35] logos do you get it God the logos
[15:39] separating himself into men God not in
[15:42] one person he's in his church Universal
[15:45] that's the reason Jesus said the works
[15:47] that I do shall you all also and more
[15:51] now I know the King James says greater
[15:54] but that's not a right translation there
[15:56] more than this shall you do
[15:59] God was bottled and confined in one man
[16:02] Jesus Christ but now he's bottled and
[16:04] confined in the whole Universal Church
[16:07] of the Living God oh friends if only the
[16:10] church could recognize what they are on
[16:12] earth as the manifestation of God we
[16:15] find that after Jesus sent back his robe
[16:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day
[16:20] of Pentecost we find now this same logos
[16:23] was in the apostles and it says that
[16:25] they were ignorant and unlearned but
[16:27] when they watched them they knew they
[16:29] had been with Jesus for they saw that
[16:31] same life and same Supernatural Ministry
[16:33] that was in Jesus living out in the book
[16:36] of Acts but that same logos life God put
[16:40] into word form and right here in the
[16:44] Bible in print form is the potential for
[16:48] that same life Jesus said the words I
[16:52] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[16:55] are life so when God quickens his word
[16:58] to you
[16:59] there's a life that comes with it when
[17:01] you listen to the preaching of the word
[17:04] if it's pure a life comes with it when
[17:07] you read the word of God and get the
[17:09] revelation of it a life comes with it
[17:12] and you'll find it is a transforming
[17:15] power Satan has a deforming power but
[17:19] God has a transforming
[17:22] power now we come up to the church ages
[17:25] now it's represented in Revelations
[17:27] chapter 1 the seven churches of Asia
[17:29] represented in chapter 1 is seven golden
[17:31] candlesticks so we're going to use the
[17:33] symbolism that the Bible used
[17:35] representing the seven churches seven
[17:38] Gentile churches of Revelations chapter
[17:40] 2 and 3 which represent the Gentile era
[17:43] they were all Gentile churches the
[17:45] churches of Asia and so we're still
[17:47] speaking about the logos you see on the
[17:50] picture here the image that out from the
[17:52] invisible God came the logos which we
[17:54] found was the Christ the anointing so
[17:57] we're still tracing that same anointing
[17:59] that we've worked on in the past so
[18:02] here's the church ages now as they come
[18:05] come through the ages now let's watch
[18:07] this logos life over here was the son of
[18:10] man to the Jews it was that logos life
[18:14] that Jesus called himself the son of man
[18:17] so the word made flesh was materialized
[18:20] and shown in its fullness to the Jews
[18:23] but he didn't call himself son of man
[18:25] through the church ages he calls himself
[18:27] Son of God because God is a spirit so he
[18:31] came in the form of Holy Spirit then he
[18:34] promised in Luke 17:30 that at the end
[18:36] of the ages he's going to be revealed as
[18:39] the son of man in the Millennium he'll
[18:42] be the son of
[18:44] David So this same life that has been
[18:47] working its way through the ages NOW
[18:49] Watch What Happens here I want to use
[18:51] symbolism of the colors of the rainbow
[18:54] the Bible talks about the seven spirits
[18:57] of God that's the anointing
[18:59] on the seven churches or seven Church
[19:01] age Messengers Through the Ages now God
[19:05] is light but when you pass light through
[19:08] a three-sided prism it breaks into a
[19:11] seven color rainbow and that's exactly
[19:14] what the power of God did the anointing
[19:16] on Christ in that he has passed himself
[19:19] through the three-sided offices of
[19:21] father son and and Holy Ghost and broken
[19:24] that power down into a seven color
[19:26] rainbow so Christ in each age we notice
[19:29] the first age a color of the rainbow
[19:32] well using it this is illustration is a
[19:35] red and then the next anointing on the
[19:37] next messenger and the next messenger so
[19:39] that a portion of Christ is me is
[19:41] manifested on each Church age messenger
[19:44] through seven Church ages but there's a
[19:47] promise that at the End of the Age this
[19:49] revealing of the son of man is to take
[19:52] place so to do that it takes the
[19:54] fullness so therefore a message comes to
[19:57] Earth at this time that will open the
[20:00] Seven Seals reveal the Bible and then
[20:04] that all the truths of all the ages will
[20:07] be gathered back into one final
[20:09] manifestation on Earth that will show
[20:12] the son revealing of the son of man and
[20:15] I don't want to shock you friends but
[20:17] this has already happened this is not
[20:19] Jesus Christ coming to the Earth as we
[20:21] have always been taught at this point
[20:23] this is a revealing of the son of man
[20:26] Luke 17:30 that is already taken place
[20:29] and we can share that with you should
[20:30] you ask or should you just keep
[20:32] following our broadcast we'll we'll be
[20:35] sharing that more with
[20:36] you I want to back up now so you can see
[20:40] what happened here's Jesus on the cross
[20:44] and then in John 12:24 it says verily
[20:46] verily I say unto you except a corn of
[20:49] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[20:52] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[20:55] forth much fruit where in the part of
[20:58] the United States where we live this is
[21:00] wheat and corn uh and soybean country
[21:05] and so for each grain that a farmer puts
[21:08] in the ground at Harvest Time that grain
[21:11] has multiplied and duplicated itself
[21:14] many fold so Jesus represents on the
[21:17] cross that seed of the fullness of the
[21:20] word that was to go into the ground so
[21:23] when he died that little seed went into
[21:25] the ground and we're going to jump
[21:27] forward now in time to not explain what
[21:30] happened in the early church ages but
[21:33] rather that seed was buried during the
[21:35] Dark
[21:37] Ages and then at the end of the Dark
[21:40] Ages that life began to manifest under
[21:42] the Lutheran
[21:44] movement just a little bit of Life
[21:47] springing up out of the ground it isn't
[21:50] the fullness but it's the Life of Christ
[21:52] beginning in manifestation in the Luther
[21:55] in Luther's
[21:56] movement teaching the just are saved by
[21:59] faith and then the plant grows on as the
[22:02] Wesleyan movement brought more word they
[22:04] believed in the just are saved by faith
[22:07] but they realized there was a second
[22:09] work of Grace whereby a Believer can be
[22:11] Sanctified from the desire of sin the
[22:14] little wheat plant is growing and then
[22:16] came Pentecost which brings this up
[22:18] where the head is forming on the wheat
[22:21] and of course when Pentecost began they
[22:24] actually all thought that it was the
[22:26] final restoration of everything but it
[22:29] actually was only the Shu that holds the
[22:32] grain the grain is the word so Pentecost
[22:36] formed the place where the word could be
[22:38] brought and manifested and declared but
[22:42] it wasn't the word and then at Harvest
[22:44] Time the message opens the Seven Seals
[22:47] and reveals Christ in a Supernatural
[22:50] Ministry and the and the scripture on
[22:53] the left you can read it on your screen
[22:54] there Mark chapter
[22:56] 4 and so now a super natural Ministry
[22:59] has manifested to give us a display of
[23:02] what it looks like to see fully ripe
[23:06] wheat mature wheat on display that ties
[23:10] to uh The Book of Leviticus where we
[23:13] talk about the wave Chief
[23:15] offering would we talk about Harvest
[23:18] time because we can't Harvest until the
[23:20] wheat has been duplicated in the head
[23:23] here's the way it progresses in a
[23:25] message brother brandom spoke in 196 3
[23:28] we're almost in the seed time the
[23:31] Harvest that was in August
[23:35] 63 53 I'm sorry and then in March of 63
[23:39] in the end time seed sign he says don't
[23:42] you see that seed time is here now the
[23:45] Harvest Time the things the Bible said
[23:48] would come to pass and then in 1965 seed
[23:51] is not air with the Shu book it's seed
[23:54] time bride time the Shucks are dead
[23:57] Shucks are Dy right up it's virgin word
[24:00] time so it shows that things have been
[24:02] progressing but just as it was in the
[24:05] days of Jesus of
[24:07] Nazareth the Believers were watching
[24:10] what God was doing and fulfilling his
[24:12] word but the chur organized Church of
[24:15] the day knew nothing about it in fact
[24:18] they were fighting against it and sad
[24:21] enough to say friends very similar
[24:24] incident is taking place today God is
[24:26] fulfilling scripture just continually
[24:29] fulfilling scripture getting ready to
[24:32] wind up his work with the Gentiles and
[24:34] turn his attention back to the
[24:36] Jews but the church nominal is totally
[24:39] unaware of what God is
[24:42] doing we're using this pyramid to
[24:45] illustrate something to you that God
[24:47] Through the Ages has poured his Spirit
[24:50] into seven Church ages a measure to each
[24:53] age just as we showed you previously and
[24:56] so the Lutheran movement represents
[24:58] water wesleyian movement blood
[25:01] Pentecostal movement Spirit that's the
[25:03] three ingredients necessary for birth
[25:07] water blood and spirit just think a
[25:09] minute now natural birth water blood
[25:12] spirit in a spiritual birth it takes the
[25:15] very same thing so God has now up
[25:18] through Pentecost leoda God has given us
[25:22] every necessary ingredient for birth and
[25:26] then the missing Capstone symbolized by
[25:28] the Great Pyramid in Egypt now when that
[25:31] comes it's Christ himself comes to kept
[25:35] the entire church ages and Christ comes
[25:38] in the form of the bride of Christ
[25:41] through a message that has been revealed
[25:43] to bring the true church back to the
[25:46] fullness of the word the ministry that
[25:49] came the Elijah Ministry the prophetic
[25:52] Ministry that came God said lest said if
[25:56] he didn't send Elijah he had to send
[25:59] Elijah lest the whole world would be
[26:01] smitten with a curse so it shows where
[26:04] the church is friends it's in bad shape
[26:07] God send a had to send a prophet with a
[26:10] restoration of the word to tell the
[26:12] people who they are and what they are in
[26:15] the scriptures and that's the very
[26:18] purpose of this series of broadcasts
[26:20] that we go through with you each week
[26:22] friends to show you who you are and what
[26:25] you are in Christ through the UN veiled
[26:28] Mysteries that have been brought to us

[26:34] sent for your sake and my sake behold I
