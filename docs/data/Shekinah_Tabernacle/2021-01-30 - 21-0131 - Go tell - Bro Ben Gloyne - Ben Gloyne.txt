hallelujah well by the lord's leading i believe the lord has um given us an opportunity to really bring um we're gonna this year is gonna be different for our youth and eagles and adult youth to get involved in a program that is a program and as definitive as the lord leads and so i just want to take you through i can't spend too much time so basically what we've got here is an overview but first before i get into i just want to is this going to work there we go yep so is that the first one is that slide one so first of all i'm just gonna cover this real fast so i need everybody okay are we all on board is everyone with me amen there's mechanics that need to take place that means you have to put not now but pull out your phones and download google calendar please we need a download google calendar and turn it on and link it to the shekinah tabernacle if you need help someone here i can help you or anyone that's kind of under the age of 30 or can help you okay amen so this is the process and you can refer to this if you want to but basically download the app on either apple or android look and on your computer too if you've got a desktop or a laptop download google calendar and lincoln to shekinah tabernacle look in your email for an invite to shekinah tabernacle i've got everybody's email in here i believe and if i haven't got your email please tell me and if i've got your email that isn't gmail then please tell me because i need your email to be gmail so that it links to gcalendar amen so please oh i've got a list i've got it on my phone after church if you're not getting notifications and you're on google calendar it's probably because you're not linked to the gmail so we could help you set up an email or whatever but it's very important these mechanics are very important for us to be part of a group so that the dynamics can come but we're just this is just to send us reminders okay so and then we want to book this is this is here key we need help because you see if we just let it go it'll just go because the law there is a law of thermodynamics that if you don't put energy into something it will degrade and the devil will make sure it degrades so you need to put physical and spiritual energy and heart and care into it so that it builds up and you can put a little bit and it might just stay like that but the chances are it will go down but if we put our effort everything into it if we put our mechanics into it and that's why i put here book your the whole year's plan everything's planned now the details aren't planned and i'll get to that in a minute but the whole year is planned all the dates are set lord willing okay we don't want to say it's all set and then that's it because we want to be flexible but from our perspective mechanically humanly it's set amen and so now that the luxury of that is you can plan around it okay so that means no holidays when these dates are on no family trips no going away and anywhere this is this is this is number one you can do whatever you feel to do but i'm just saying now we don't have any excuse to plan when the youth things are on or when this is on because it's all there and this is the beauty of it and this is the burden that we could plan because there's still lots of space there's still lots of holiday room and lots of weekends to go and do your own thing as a family but then there's weekends we do things with this family amen and i believe that when this family gets real good we're going home amen so let's get this family real good hallelujah are you with me i want to rally that point on a rally that are we together amen hallelujah well i'm going to go fast now expectation so number one i'm not going to i'm not going to explain these things i just want you to you know and people on that camera that might not be here i'm looking at you too no one in particular but you know some people are hiding in their little office there somewhere overseas or somewhere or somewhere in new zealand and they really want to be part of this you're a part of this amen are you zooming in i'm i'm i'm laser pointing that camera right now you action we need action we need buy-in amen hallelujah accountability and commitment amen if you see that you you feel like you're doing something but you feel like oh my friends because you know we have our close friends and close connections hit them up hit them up what are you doing let's make each other accountable because this is important i've seen now this i've seen man i watched some videos of our church services after youth camp and all of our young people were just rejoicing in the services standing up and shouting and now they just get down and they start getting quiet and things start to panel why why because we need a rally we need to continue the revival you don't have to go down and start sitting still and getting down and getting oppressed by the devil and all those things you can stay in revival all of us can stay in revival and this is going to take this is the burden action accountability commitment we need commitment from people we need cohesion and an effort so this is going to take these things remember the one main thing that we need is the lord but what we've got to do is we've got to give him something to work with hallelujah so we don't want to forget the key of this all is that god comes amen hallelujah process for event planning so this is the process now because we don't want to just take over this whole thing we've got young adults that really want to get involved people that want to help with these things and help planning so what we've done is we've got the dates all set but then the pre-planning with the adult youth and those that want to get involved in leadership and actually be part of the planning the details of each event and each youth catch up at each eagle fun night and all those things have been left as an open canvas and we've got reminders coming this is why it's important that we get google calendar we've got reminders coming like uh a day out two weeks out and then a month out on the major ones so that we can at the month out we're going to gather together and we're going to plan with the young adults and the youth the ones that want to get involved and i believe we should all get involved we should be involved because you see the more we come together the more we do these things the more cohesion we have the more friendships are forged all right so date set pre-planning with adult youth and then we execute it we carry it out we go and do it amen i'm going to hand these out these are going to be handed out to the parents and the young people the youth not the eagle sorry you'll get there i think in a couple of years but this is for the senior youth class and the adult youth and also for the parents of the of those people in those classes so that we can all be on board with the with what's happening this in here as you probably can't read because i can't even read it from here is basically the agenda um this is to help you can stick this on your fridge and make uh appointments right around here so we've got um you can actually book these things into your calendar or i mean it's booked for you you don't have to do anything really as long as you sign in it's all done then and what we could do is we could have a planner that has nothing in it where there is nothing on and then you can plan that if that works i know we can do anything to make it easy we just want to make this real streamlined real easy so that it's just it just works and it is going to be hard work and it but it's not like a terrible regime or anything this is actually going to be quite fun january february so we've got the dates there so when you get this little leaflet thing here you'll have the dates of what it is just explaining it and then in here is some more information which i have over here you can see um we've got the dates and the times of each of these different events for the youth okay so the details of that can go into that if you want to talk about it anytime we're here to explain the details in here please when you get this can you please read that that is that's like the the mission statement for want of a better word amen so now here is the program all the red is church so don't get too worried i said to brahman we should we probably shouldn't have put the church meetings on there because now it looks like it's like completely full you know but that is that is the program um so basically this and this will go up on the notice board out on the wall there but this is to give you an idea of what's in google calendar the blue is the eagles little meetings and catch-ups um the green is the youth events there is uh one major event we haven't put in there yet because um um like you know when taranaki came down and we had that awesome weekend that's called the youth bonanza and that's right there we want to do two of them in a year we want to do one there where they come down and then we're going to go there or we're going to go somewhere but we've also got another major youth event which is the youth retreat weekend where we're going to go into the snow and stay up in tongariro camp and things like that so it's going to be real fun and then yeah we've got a whole bunch of programs for the eagles and for the youth and so yes this is going to be a it's not too busy it looks busy but it's not too busy but it's we just need to come together we just need to see this thing unfold and the awesome thing is now that it's all set we don't have to you know we don't have to have things that are coinciding unless it's obviously coming up um and it's you know like something that just comes up out of unforeseen but um the awesome thing is now we can incorporate the the adult youth and the young people that really want to get involved and we can do this together now for the eagles there is and brother and paul is do you want to have that meeting after the church about the production yeah okay so eagles please meet after church with brother and paul straight up just for a quick meeting regarding an eagle production there's going to be two productions each year so two per year one's going to be ready of ready rehearsed and ready by mother's day which is oh mate may yeah and then the other one's for church camp so i believe there'll be a real blessing and there's going to have the way it works is this three months of rehearsals which are going to happen kind of around when band practice is happening um just after lunch so don't get worried eagles you can eat first two-month break and then um so there'll be and then it'll be all on again so three months of rehearsals two months and then a production two-month break and then it'll be the same repeating so you do it's not going to be all year rehearsals every week but we've planned these things and tried our best so that it avoids big traveling it's like we're trying to incorporate these to before and after services but there is inevitably going to be some traveling involved for some of the friday night meetings but what we've done is we've made the friday night youth meetings simultaneous to the eagle meetings so they will happen simultaneously every now and again they will come together i was thinking that we can do the there is an actual youth casual meetup and an eagles meet up on november the 5th which is guy fawkes so we can then have a fireworks night together and do something fun so we can do that together midweek workshop so isaac um you have probably not known about this yet but we're going to be getting brother isaac to take some workshops with the eagles who will get to come to church on wednesday nights at 6 pm and they get to jump on their favorite instrument and not smash it but just have a good time and hit it real good and brother isaac or myself or anyone else that would like to just facilitate that and maybe write a couple of songs with them and just have fun this is because we've had requests to do that so that's one of the things that we want to do and we're going to be doing that every once every month on a wednesday night at 6 pm the big day for the eagles to plan that is 2bc but we'll talk about that and we'll let sister shannon and brother and paul fill in the details for the eagles and fun nights are going to be every monthly on a friday and then obviously there is nothing stopping you guys um having fun together in between amen hallelujah so after service can we please have all of the youth and anyone that identifies themselves as youth or a young adult please just come and and catch up with us i want to hand these things out and also parents of youth or in the senior youth class please don't leave without one of these i've got 40 i think 38 of them so i think there'll be enough for everybody yeah god bless you and um are we all together amen let's do this together let's rally amen hallelujah this is going to take an effort but i believe that it will pay off and it will start a great ball rolling for us to go in our body change amen god bless you [Applause] amen praise the lord please i'm standing sing this morning and we'll just sing a few worship songs before brother ben comes amen we come into your presence [Music] we come into your presence to sing a song to you a song of praise and honor for all the things you've helped us through you gave a life worth living a life in love with you and now i just love giving all my praises back to you you're the father of creation you're there isn't there you're the one who walked away from the empty tomb [Music] with love

welcome to the house of the lord this morning amen amen if you've got your bibles handy we're going to go to mark 16. amen uh yes just a reminder we have the youth service at 3 pm today amen praise the lord um just everyone's had a good week so mark 16 and let me go see if i can drive quickly yep go mark 16 um two to eight and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed with a long white garment and they were refrighted and he saith unto them be not afraid a frightened if that's how you say that ye seek jesus of nazareth whom was crucified he has risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and they went they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid amen what a scene amen let's just bow his word of prayer this morning if you have a prayer request you have a burden on your heart you just want to lift your hand to the lord this morning amen let's just bow heads in his presence and let's just talk to him this morning lord jesus we're so thankful lord we can truly sing from our hearts all hail king jesus all hail emmanuel lord you're more than life to us lord you're more important to us than our next breath lord jesus we're so thankful we can bow our heads and we can lift our hands and we can worship you today give you praise we just want to ask dear god as we have gathered this one more time we do not want to take a church service for granted lord we but we're so aware about how how unstable things can be lord one minute we can be in church like this the next minute we can be in a level four lockdown but i want to thank you lord we have this opportunity dear god together in your presence as a people lord redeemed by your blood and i just ask may you just come lord and we invite you to where we are today dear god i just pray father you'd speak to our hearts lord you you would meet our needs lord you see the hands that have been raised across the building lord and maybe those who may be watching by the way of internet lord i pray you would meet their needs as well father may you speak to us like only you can we want to thank you lord that you're the answer to every situation lord you lord jesus you're more than enough oh god we praise your name we just asked please anoint speaker and hero one more time make your word lord make it live lord in our lives we thank you just pray forgive us of our sins our iniquities lord and cleanse us of our secret faults oh god and we just want to commit our lives and the service into your hands lord in jesus christ and we ask amen amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i want to if i could take this take a title today i want to talk about go tell um and you know i was listening to brother brown speaking about this we know this is like you know he preaches as an easter easter sunrise service but to me it's the most powerful instruction that a people can be given by almighty god go tell i'm alive and we're so thankful that it's not just a uh we don't just go tell people that he lives because of tradition because of history because you know but because he's a living god in our lives we have something to run with brother brown would say that many people are running today but they don't have a message to pack you know they go here and there and they preach things and they have conventions they have meetings they build churches but they don't have the message that he is alive and they admits that he's present amen so you know he said many great men like paul reveres of today you know they would run you know paul revere he was he was the man who who when the british were invading america and you know he you know he got on a horse and he rode and he told the people the british are coming the british are coming and you know they you know but many people are writing today but without a message you know what good would it be for paul revere to get on his horse and ride without a message he'd just be going for a ride but yes the same thing you know christianity we don't just live a life without something to tell i mean but we have a message that our king is alive i mean he's present upon the earth he hasn't diminished in power one iota he's just as powerful today he is a god of miracles today he's the god of the impossible today amen he is alive today and i'm so thankful that when he said go and tell he equipped them to go and tell i mean it wasn't just something they learned it's not something in their minds that they went and just rehearsed but it was a living god i mean they carried that presence of the living god to the people amen and then god lived hallelujah he he inspired their words he calls them he he vindicated what they said amen it should be the same thing with you and i today that god would vindicate the words we say that our witness is a true witness not because you're trying to be a witness for christ but he comes and anna's is the witness in your life hallelujah amen i was going to call this how to function in times of uncertainty because it's an uncertain time as i said a few weeks ago i was reading a bbc article and this was the title of it how to function in times of uncertainty although that's a good that's a good phrase you know because we need to know how to function in this day and age you know many people they say their life is on hold because of covert 19. you know and sure many plans have been put on hold but you know as as you know the saying goes never waste a good crisis right you know the devil doesn't waste a good crisis we shouldn't waste a good crisis you know we should be using this crisis for our benefit hallelujah i mean so we should never think well our lives have been put on hold no actually our plans may be put on hold but our lives haven't been put on hold that's why we need to seek the will of the lord said lord what is your will in my life for this season amen amen uh paul would write to timothy and say fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life wherein unto thou has thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witness a good confession which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only pontitate the king of kings and the lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches anyone seen you know in the news today uh well you know this past week there's just you know you know the the stock exchange is such a crooked thing now if you invest in stocks that that's up to you but you know there's this there's this war going on in the stock exchange in america where where basically it's it's it's it's these people have taken these stocks of this company which was going down and they've just been buying it has been going oh look up 700 percent it's value and you know people are alarmed all this but what's happening is it's a war against the people on wall street because there's people on wall street that basically hedge bets that that stocks are going to go down and they manipulate things in certain ways and people are fighting this kind of stock war going on so you can't have you know but the value of this company it's a failing company but yet people have just been putting money into it money into it so on paper looks very successful but in reality it's not successful and to me all that is is uncertain riches you know people are just fighting a war over something to time get one up against each other we shouldn't put our trust now as i said nothing is a stock exchange if you invest in stocks go for it you know i pray the lord bless you whatever you do but you know all i'm saying is riches are uncertain really there are digits on the screen or digits on paper they can change you know once upon a time this is um this is after world war ii you know the german currency was worth quite a lot but there came a time where it just collapsed and a whole wheelbarrow of money was for a piece of bread it just it just went to nothing so this world is uncertain but we know how to function in this uncertain world because we have the certain one hallelujah that's why i'm so glad we can just depend upon him aren't you glad you can harlow it doesn't matter what the world's doing what the world thinks it's going to do i mean we have a certain sound in this day to me this message was not uncertain people say it's a bunch of confusion to me it's not a bunch of confusion the bible even says peter says about the writings of paul he says even the writings of brother paul who are hard to understand where many wrestle with and the rest of the scriptures to their own destruction but to me if you've been given the spirit of truth it's clear it's not a myriad of confusion it's actually a reality and it's actually peace and life and it will guide your life hallelujah amen so i'm glad i'm glad we do not have an uncertain sound but we have a very certain sound in this day this message sure is certain amen we have the driverless car amen it's here you can go on it amen we have a you know people say well it's prophecy fulfilled well it's not well to me it's very interesting we have a female vice president in america we have a second catholic president in history you know and most of the supreme court is catholic anyway over there yeah that's right so what is it now it's basically a catholic it's been run by the catholic church for a long time anyway we shouldn't be alarmed by what we just saw a couple of weeks ago because it's been there anyway for a long time prophecy fulfilled we see the modern church running following the spirit of rock and roll right we see all these things the prophet told us we shouldn't be alarmed but then we're also the main thing to me the main sign of the time is the bride getting ready amy because when that little woman gets in step with the word then there'll be a message come and sweep her and catch her away and now that's what's been happening from since the prophet left to today is there's a people aligning with the word it's not their opinion they're aligning with or dogma of man but it's the word and then becoming one and that's what i see in front of me as a people maturing into the full manifestation of the word this is where we are i mean you are actually the god's timepiece because remember god's going to turn back to israel we know that and to me i was just singing as well brother well jesus said the generation that sees israel become a nation shall not pass till all things be fulfilled they were they became a nation in 1948 yeah that's a long time ago the generation that saw that will not pass to all things be fulfilled so where are we friends hallelujah that's exciting to me you know someone said to brother brown brother ram you scare people into this saying this you're this god's coming yo jesus is coming he said i shouldn't scare you to death it should thrill your soul then the one that doubts me is going to come carry me away up into heaven hallelujah shouldn't that excite us i think it should excite us well i'm not ready he'll make you ready that's why he died on calvary's why he shed forth his holy spirit to make us ready it's not us making us ready says and the bride well the scripture says well the bride has made herself ready but it was unto her was granted that should be a raid in fine linen so you just got to put on the garment hallelujah isn't that right you know you think i you know you go to a certain occasion you think well do i have the right kind of clothing where you go into your wardrobe you do it's been granted yeah amen hallelujah so his righteousness has been grounded just put it on put on the word say yes lord amen now he says if this heritage of god if this people that god died for if this church has been called by his name as ever to be saved we've got to have a messenger with a message from the throne to meet the challenge of this day now we know the true messenger of this day is the holy ghost he used a man from kentucky he used malachi for the prophet but it was the holy ghost speaking through him hallelujah brother maybe the prophet of the day is the holy ghost he's still here hallelujah amen hallelujah no i'm not doing away with the prophet's ministry as a man but hey that was god speaking to him he said he said i wanted to be a trapper i didn't want to do this amen amen amen to meet the challenge of this day there is a goliath but god will surely have a david somewhere i'm so glad the devil has a challenge but there's always something to meet the challenge and that one to meet the challenge is already prepared before the devil ever comes on the scene amen david was already anointed to be king he had already killed the lion already killed the bear already had a living testimony that that his weapon was enough i mean that when he saw goliath he says well my weapon's enough i killed this one i killed that one i've killed this one as well they're exactly the same as these animals and what happened his weapon was enough and he even prophesied well i'll take your sword i'll chop your head off amen and he wasn't willing just to you know goliath had brothers he picked up more than just one stone that's right he said well if i got to kill them all well hallelujah with enough sunlight to do it and if i run out of time i'll just say the sun stands still moon stands still we have more time what are you trying to say nothing can stand before the bride of christ nothing can stand before you hallelujah we've gotta we're gonna have such a confidence we've got to remember who we are we are not defeated we're not spineless amen we are not cowards we are rugged christians amen we're built to overcome we've been built to overcome we've been built to overcome this age hallelujah we are not built to be defeated we are not built to be defeated by the devil but we are built to defeat the devil hallelujah you take the man who is the fastest man in the world on this day i don't know who his name is but he is built to run the hundred meters in the time he's he's built sure he's got to do training but he's got the right muscle composition he's got the right frame and the right step he's built to run it i could do the same training i could eat the same food i could wear the same clothes i could have the same shoes i could do everything he does i would never run it in his place because i'm not built to run like him no matter doesn't matter if my ambition's the same if my focus is the same i will never run it the same as him because i'm not built the same way amen but the bride of christ i'm telling you you're built you're built for a job hallelujah we've received amen he was built by his natural birth to run that space yeah pace and we are built amen by our spiritual new birth i mean to overcome this age we ought to remember who we are look at the mirror in the morning remember who you are we're sons and daughters of the most high god amen we are not here just to go through life we had overcome hallelujah amen amen we have a message that he lives i'm so thankful i can tell people who don't know anything about jesus that jesus will change your life he changed my life he changed he's in people's lives he's alive hallelujah it's not it's not saying i've learned i've experienced it hallelujah he'll really cha i i it just marvels me how he can take someone and just change their whole life how did he do that i don't know but he did it and he still does it today amen amen we are going but with nothing to say it proves it when we come to a place that a nation or a people that deny jesus christ to be the son of god and stands in the face of our most challenging ministers of today and then in our great church league finding some 30 communist packing papers for 20 or 30 years that they're members of the communistic party in our united churches what can we do it shows that we have run without a message selling out the very birthrights of the nation selling out the regular birthrights of the church you know i don't have it on me but it just comes to mind they had a they had a meeting in congress this is before the inauguration and they um in the senate rather and they and and and a man who was a former i think methodist minister stood up and said a prayer he didn't use the name of jesus christ he he he he he said some name of some hindu deity and he finished with amen and a woman you think about the founding fathers of that country if they were sitting in that audience and they heard that they would have there would have been a riot get this man out of this place how dare he do this nation was founded under god and look where it's gone brother braham said it's falling apart this nation's fallen apart too it's not easy to see a train wreck but it's train wrecking that's right but thank god that this is not our final resting place amen it just shows you that we're really at the end of all things amen it has to come it has to come to a showdown it's come to a place at the little church that's believed the message and stood on both feet with their eyes centered on the cross in their heart the resurrection of jesus christ burning it's come to a place where the nations has got to recognize it it's got to it's to a showdown no matter what the church is when the council of churches are so honeycomb with communistic no wonder they can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they don't believe in divine healing they don't have any message in their heart no matter how hard they're running if the holy ghost comes into a man's heart he'll believe that jesus christ is raised from the dead and he's alive in him to do and to do the world that he came to do the will the will of god through the man's life amen hallelujah you know it's amazing i marvel at this this is this is just after we read our opening scripture here's mary magdalene magdalene she sees that he's alive she runs back to the disciples gives them the report i doubt very much that the way she looked and the way she felt and the way she was talking when she left was the same way she came back with you know maybe she just said maybe she didn't speak to them but some others i'm just going to go to the tomb i don't know what to do with myself i can't sit here can't do the i'm i'm just going to go to the tomb broken-hearted she's a broken-hearted woman i doubt very much she came back in that kind of frame of mind she would have burst through the door he's alive i mean he appeared to me the stones rolled away and he's present he's alive as he promised hallelujah he's a resurrected savior he's alive today hallelujah but it says they believed amen not obviously something happened to her she goes away sad she comes back glad her message was different but they said well amen here she comes and running mary's claiming that she saw him no doubt she was extremely excited she had seen and spoken with the risen lord wouldn't that make you excited you can speak with him today amen that same one is alive right now amen he wasn't the dead body that she saw him uh saw being placed in the tomb a few days ago i mean and if i could put it this way the word wasn't just ink on paper anymore it was living it wasn't something to debate and something to question it was alive amen and then and then after this it says that the two on the way to emmaus now i don't know the time frame of this but mary came in rejoicing a few hours later these two came in rejoicing as i said i doubt very much the way they came back is the way they left they maybe said brothers we're just going to go back to emmaus god bless you you know broken-hearted they're welded fallen apart but they would they would walk with the one that they thought was dead and he'd be carried away somewhere all mysterious and he would open the scripture to them for six hours and then finally they'd come into the house where they were going to be and then he would take the bread and he'd break the bread he did something that he did before he died and their eyes came open it's you hallelujah they disappeared and they didn't walk they didn't take six hours walking back i mean but they ran back to jerusalem to go tell the disciples that he's alive hallelujah hallelujah it's amazing they had plans mary had plans i'll just go to the tomb the stone will be there i don't know what i'm gonna do just roll it away anoint the body of spices she had plans but the lord interrupted her plans these two on the way to emmaus they have plans we're just gonna go back to emmaus but god's in the business of interrupting plans hallelujah you know you just think of a certain day when the lord came and interrupted your plans when he went from beyond from from just a story to a living reality hallelujah you know we've all had plans sometimes they're very vague plans some people have very detailed plans but i'm looking into people the lord has interrupted their plans hallelujah amen hallelujah you know people ask the question what do you want to be when you grow up some people say i want to be this and they become that i don't know what i wanted to be but i'm not what hallelujah that's all right amen my plans are very vague you know my best friend at the time he said to me because i don't know where i was gonna study or whatever after school and he just said to me come down to christchurch because we're studying engineering you just might as well come do so i did that's pretty vague but hey the lord had a purpose in that i met god down in christchurch hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we think we're just wandering through life but god's got you right on right on schedule hallelujah you know if you say well i want to be you know the lord interrupts our plans because he wants us to be more than just a mom more than just a dad have a career go to uni learn a trade but he's commissioning us i want you to be my living witness i want to go in you and live through to be a living witness to this age hallelujah you know he'll speak right through you if you let him that's right hallelujah he'll take your vocal cords take your tongue bypass this and speak something to someone oh that's just for the ministry no no that's for anyone no i'm not no i'm not saying oh you you know and this and this is not having something pre-planned in your mind that you're imagining then you speak it out no god can use your lips amen to speak to someone's life can turn someone's life completely around hallelujah amen amen he does do that why because the voice of god is in the bride because he is in her amen right now i love the story of of of naaman oh yeah he was a little girl she was a slave girl you know in the scripture we all have a role some have very big roles you could say uh brother brown had a very big role in the scripture moses had a very big role paul had a very big role you know but it doesn't matter how big the role may seem it's all significant to god john the baptist had a very small role but a very significant role he would be prepared for 30 years for six months ministry but that ministry was to introduce the messiah to the people very small role but a very big role and sometimes it can just be like shamgar had one scripture in the bible but that's all he needed hallelujah david had a lot of scripture in the bible but all their roles were important now this little slave girl there wasn't much said about her her name's not recorded you know it doesn't even say where she is from in israel but her role was vital she would she would have such a you know she would she would have a have a testimony that when neyman was found to be a leper she would just say oh would would god my lord were with the prophetess and samaria for he would recover of his leprosy that's all that's recorded that she said but she was inspired to say that amen it doesn't matter how big a little we think we are we have a role you take an orchestra there's the lead instruments but you know sometimes a man can stand in the back and he can have a triangle and he can be standing there for most of the opening and whatever however the music goes and he just does a ting but that thing is needed because that thing is on the sheet music and and and maybe we may miss it if it's not there but the one who wrote the composer of the piece if he doesn't hear the ting in his mind he says something is wrong amen and our lord jesus is is the great composer of the sheep music amen and he wants every piece to play in their time hallelujah so i could say the man with the triangle that just goes ting is just as important as the lead violinist because it all makes the music amen so every one of us are important to god we all have a job to do we have the best job he's little he's alive he's living amen now notice brother ram says oh no i don't have this in my notes it's hard when you change things and you can't get there to change things and he says now this this brother brownie says it's in the supernatural now notice that child under inspiration was led to say those words we don't know of elijah ever healing anyone else or maybe no one else no matter how many he prayed for but she said i would to god that my lord was over with my country for in my country we have a prophet oh if we could say that about our churches today i would to god that we would come under the influence that i live under and my church lives under for we believe that god is a healer we believe that god is a savior we believe that god gives the holy spirit i would to god you lived in my country that's the kind of atmosphere we should be living in we have the answer to every problem i would to god you knew my god amen he would sort out your family he'd sort out your marriage troubles he'd heal your sick he would give you clarity of life and give you purpose amen he'll wash all your sins away i would to god you knew my god amen hallelujah there's many people today that doesn't know that jesus christ is still alive they don't know that he still rules and reigns they don't know that the blood at calvary for the all-sufficient that even purchased there at the cross for your transgressions and for your healings they don't know that that that's real today he says we need some more little mates to go around and testify of these things don't you think so get in the atmosphere of it that's what we need is few more mates to go around hello little mates how you doing i mean to go around the country get in the atmosphere of the of the holy ghost and go and speak to a lost and dying world and say i went to god you knew my god you know some people think well are you against things no i'm just for jesus amen hallelujah he says it's not afraid what the world says because while we're talking with the world we're still in another atmosphere you're talking to the sinner but you're not in his atmosphere and you're in such a glorious and shrouded in the shekinah glory all around you and the veil of the world hit you can talk to the worldly woman or the worldly men or whoever it is and still live in that shekinah glory telling them of a loving god that's raised from the dead you know my my supervisor at work um he's a gay guy and when we first met he told me this because he saw my resume because i put on my resume that other activities i do as i pastor a church he thought that i'd be against them i said no not at all god respects our choices i respect you for who you are i trust you respect me for who i am and we got talking about the lord in the lab one day and he says well is your as your church uh lgbq whatever friendly i said we welcome everyone but the lord changes everyone that comes and i share testimonies about you i said this is not a bunch of rules it's a love relationship with our lord jesus christ it's not rules not keeping some list of things no he's actually a living god because we do welcome everyone but you won't stay the way you came in jesus name amen because the god of the book of acts is still the same i believe hallelujah i see but god is a gentleman we respect other people's choices oh yes because god respects their choice amen but i'm so thankful you know as i said you know i told him jesus will change your life he had a bible he went to a catholic boarding school he's a hindu background being indian but you know i said jesus will change all he changed my life he can change your life he can can he not amen hey is there anything too hard for the lord i thought i was a hard case he sort of be out you'd probably put yourself in the same category because god doesn't have a too hard basket we do hallelujah i'm glad he doesn't now let's just skip to the you know so here she is she gives us testimony we know the rest of the story where where naaman goes to to israel and so but let's jump to the end of the story naaman returns he's no longer a leper you just think about this for a second there had not been a single leper ever healed in history that's recorded not a single one but he comes back and he's not a leper this should have turned syria upside down yeah you think about it this had never been done before it hit no one had ever been healed of leprosy before it was a literally a death sentence to become a leper in those days you had to go to a leper colony you're ostracized from society he could never be a general again he could never live in his house again he could never be with his wife again he had to separate himself from everyone and go live in a leper colony that was the normal order of life but then he comes back and he's not a leper as i said this should have turned syria upside down but to me it's just like the disciples they heard from three witnesses that jesus was alive but they didn't believe and it goes to show that you know they had to have the experience that he's alive for themselves amen because remember naaman he wasn't just anyone he was the general yeah he was the upper nups everyone knew who neyman was in syria he was a mighty warrior in their in their armies he was the leader of their campaigns he was a celebrity of the celebrity but it would have been so it would have been very interesting conversation in neyman's house let's just go to naaman's house you know while while naaman is away and and we've come to speak to lady neyman no doubt she's upset maybe she's excited because you know there's a god in israel that can heal but you know a lot of people we you know when bad stuff happens a lot of different people come around comfort but it's actually not comforting it's just rubbing into the fact that you're down some comfort because they want to comfort yeah and some comfort because they just they're nosy they're wondering what's going on but you know wouldn't it be interesting to speak to lady neyman and you know people no doubt would have you know her friends and so on would have tried to come and comfort her you know we're so sorry that neyman's a leper and he can't be here anymore but you know maybe she would reply but it's okay he's going to come back soon now no doubt in the people's minds they would have been thinking he ain't coming back where is it in our history the lep has ever returned not a leper you know and maybe maybe they said yeah sure he is but knowing full well he can't come back in that condition that's how people might have thought about you i guess they will never get out of this thing they'll never get through this problem they'll never overcome this situation they're just got to be stuck in that way this is just how they are for the rest of their life while their mother and father were like that so they'll be like that you know you just get people just think well you just gotta go down this track of life this kind of way and because of how your first birth is you may have even thought that about yourself there's no way i can overcome this and this is how my family is and i see the same traits in me and this is just how it has to be and everyone's going real quiet but isn't that right something you think man i'm just this is just how i am and this is just right but god never just looks at us and say this is just how you're going to be because he has a different image of you in his mind that image that he has of you in his mind is is his image hallelujah i'm glad the lord can change any personality he wants to amen hallelujah but then naaman comes back and he's no more a leper imagine that he rides in his chariot gets off maybe people are kind of trying to social distance themselves because he's you know got this but he comes in and and all the white's gone he's rejoicing how could you not be rejoicing i had an incurable disease but it got cured hallelujah and then maybe the questions would have started well why didn't he just go to the house of ramon but they knew that god couldn't do anything no matter how much they worshipped how much they preached how much they prayed he couldn't do anything and then he asked for two mule's burden of earth i believe i have it there you know because he wanted to take a bit of ground where where jehovah god dwelled and he wanted to put it there and and then you know and then he begins his life begins to be different he begins to worship differently to how he did before hallelujah he's now a living testimony why do you worship the god of israel well i'll tell you a story i'll tell you a story i was leprous one day i couldn't no nothing could help me but then you see that slave girl there she lived in such an atmosphere even in great trouble even being a slave girl not even in her own country but she lived in such an atmosphere where she believed her god was god and she would pray to that god and she would just her life was a testimony and when she heard that i was leprous she wasn't saying well it serves them right no she just said i would to god that he'd be in israel with my prophet because we're he we're that prophet as god is hallelujah and so i went there and you know i had to go dip in the jordan lots of know my pride had to be taken out of me and you know but after i got out of the water the seventh time that leprosy was gone hallelujah then no doubt you'd say okay i understand why you worship the way you did but wouldn't it be interesting this is just my little mind so so he says to you know that you know he's speaking to the prophets here uh uh uh to the prophet here before he leaves israel he says pardon my servant you know i'm gonna go into the house of rahman to worship there because my master you know he wants to lean on my hand all these things and then i i don't have it up here but the next verse basically the prophet is gone peace but imagine imagine going into this church now and the one that you are going to lean on his hand or however that worked with you because you're the king he's right there the man you're worth has been healed not by this god that you're worshipping but the god of john you know you're the god of israel he doesn't have leprosy anymore and you can see in his life that he's just going through the motions now yeah because he is being he's he he feels obligated to come with you to worship at this place it would kind of ring a bit hollow wouldn't it because you're worshiping this god of syria who's all mighty and great but he can't heal a single person and the god of israel does the impossible and now you've got living evidence right next to you hallelujah hallelujah it's like us you know the believer is living evidence that this book lives you want proof that jesus lives here it is hallelujah amen hallelujah i like that you just think about how empty that worship would be you're worshiping this idol and this guy wasn't healed by this idol we went to the real god now you're here and he's here and hallelujah you know you couldn't turn to him say what a great service that was he said no it may be all lights and flashing bang and music but there's nothing to it hallelujah remember the gospel glows hollywood shines but the gospel glows with humility amen hallelujah there was a man who was born blind he was healed by jesus i'll just read this i just find it his um his parents asked them and said we know that this is our son that he was born blind but by what means he seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not for years of age ask him he shall speak for himself these words spake his parents because they fed the jews now if that happened to them they wouldn't have been afraid to testify right because it happened yo you can't argue with the testimony i was once this way i'm now this way i was once walking the opposite direction to the word now i'm just walking with the word what did it he did it i was dead amen and sin now i'm alive in christ hallelujah i was dead in trespasses now i've been quickened by the holy ghost now i see him living in my life i see him change my family i see him working mightily i don't know how this worked it just worked yes my brother ran we saw the vision of the third pool the great tent but within that tent was that little room so i'll meet you in there people came and crippled and whatever more there's a reporter there trying to see what was going on because it couldn't be explained and they walked out healed and the report said well what happened to you and they said i don't know i went in there and he and the lord was in there and i just got changed here i am you know and you may not believe it but i'm walking now and we went and crippled hallelujah some people had to literally pack us in hallelujah carry us in a stretch or whatever more but then the lord came in his word met us in that secret place and we walk out well what what happened to you well jesus happened to me you know i mean you can't explain it as much as i wish i could explain what he did in my heart you can't fully explain it hallelujah but we should still speak to the wonderful things he has done amen by what so these yes so these words uh spake his parents because they fed the jews for the jews had agreed already if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue therefore saith his parents he is of age ask him then again uh called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he's a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see you know people say a lot of things about brother braham and the message well one thing i know i was lost now i'm found one thing i know i i there was nothing in me that really wanted the lord but now all i want is him then they said to him again did what did he to thee how he opened thine eyes what did he preach what kind of doctrine was it you know you can't you can't put into words he answered them but the word became clear yeah yeah hallelujah this book became a new book amen amen he answered them i've told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear it again will he also be his disciples then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciple it's very easy to for people to believe in a god that was what about the god that is amen we know that god spake unto moses but as for this fellow we know not from whence he is and they received it out of tradition not out of revelation amen the man answered and said unto them why heron is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened my eyes now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshiper of god and doeth his will he heareth him he heareth it says the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of him that was born blind if this man were not of god he could do nothing that's right you know brother brown would be there in a prayer line there's a little girl there brother billy paul tells it had no eyes and and she said i want i want eyes they were praying brother ram stops and the prince is what color eyes do you want i think she said blue i can't remember a couple of blue streaks came down she got blue eyes hallelujah i believe it was um jack co i might have his name wrong but he was he was an evangelist and and and the first meeting he went into man didn't even have eyes brother ram said in three days you'll see amen amen so so this man jet co uh yo he he he followed this man around in three days their eyes um eyeballs you know you know eyeballs in the sockets at the end of those three days you could see what do you do about that i don't know hallelujah so now here we are on this end time as i said in the beginning the bride has come to her maturity it's very easy to look at the world because remember the wheat and the tears they mature together the tears are bound for the burning but the weed is gathered to the ghana now it's very easy to look in the world and say this world is mature and it's sin right amen it's all come to its maturity and we look at that say oh boy this world has come to its climax but what about the bride of christ what about the wheat i mean because they both got to come to maturity they both got to come to a harvest condition and many times we look at ourselves and say lord how can i ever be made in your image but we've already been made in his image i think we're further down the road with the lord than we think we are because we keep looking at our faults and our failures and our our trip ups and things we do wrong but the lord doesn't allocate those to us because of his blood he doesn't allocate those things to us right and he can actually see if we could look through his eyes we would actually see the bride is actually pretty ripe pretty mature because he's not going to harvest the people you don't harvest wheat that's half grown that's a silly farmer that's right why are you harvesting you gotta wait for it to come to its golden head and you know all the greenness is baked out of it now it's now it's ready for harvest it's the same thing with you and i see see when we come to that golden stage brother graham says that the that the wheat just needs to land the presence of the sun and that's what we have been doing that's why the sunlight has been getting stronger you know we know that the light that that that shines in a harvest time is not the same as a greater strength of the sun than when you plant the wheat because if you if that strength of the sun is shining when you plant the wheat it'll kill the plant but then when the but but as the plant grows the sunlight gets stronger until it's down to its harvest condition i mean so now as we've been walking with the lord through these years amen the sunlight has been getting stronger i mean there's been a greater quickening going on the form and the latter rain are running together harley the teaching and the quickening rain the the two anointings that have fallen having fallen together and i can say that because us who just came into the message just a couple of years ago literally we are right there in revelation with those who've been in the message for 40 years why because there's a quickening going on hallelujah isn't that wonderful i think that's great he says just lay in the presence of the sun that's why it's so important to have a spiritual atmosphere in your home a spiritual atmosphere on the job wherever you may be just be in his presence the lord can drop things on your heart bring his word forth i mean you can have a communion with god you can be walking down the road you can be at school at your job you can be anywhere in god speaks to you ministers to you hallelujah and we can live in that kind of atmosphere because that's the atmosphere we're built to live in amen why do you think this world is so hyper you know hyper connected right it used to be once upon a time you know i remember we had a phone when i was young that you you you turned the turn that you turned the thing around it would you know your dial numbers yes hallelujah we used to have floppy disks yeah that's right and they're not safe icons jayden looks at me what's up lobby they probably know what it is but you know some people you know at work there's my old job we found some floppy disks or the small hard ones you have the compactors whatever you call it and they took them so not me but some others took them to the younger members of staff and say do you know what this is and some of them had to think for a while because i'd never seen one before apart from a save icon you know so those things but now so we've gone from that where was dial-up internet phone calls or landlines unless you had some brick phone now i can now i can talk to the whole world and we can have a multi-you know multi-site video conference call it's all hyper-connected and part of that hey the devil's made the technology we can use it against him but in the same token it can make us so busy and so caught up in things i mean that we that we can lose our fellowship with god so we need these things to be in all all things in moderation in the right balance because it's here you can't go be a monk in some monastery somewhere and shut the world out how can you be how can you go and tell if you're up on the mountain somewhere right we don't want to make some kind of cult that kind of just builds up some walls and keeps the world out no no we're told to go tell amen a lot of his disciples don't know their disciples i didn't know i was a disciple until hallelujah he said go tell and someone came and told me amen but now we hear the time of a harvest time brother and says in the sea does not air with the shook she was not the seed mary was not just a shooker tassel and stalk carriers are part of the word not all the word luther had justification weirdly wesley had sanctification pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts but when the word come now they could produce that justification will save a man you believe that we still believe that today don't we hallelujah sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as i believe the stalk is part of the wheat sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't the life then came along sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the bible you have to sure so still that's not that's just a little more that's two more words but then come the pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the holy ghost speaking in tongues there they call that the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say i and my father are one yes this should be our testimony i and my father are one in that day ye shall know that i am in you you and me my father knew you and me right i my father are one and these things then the shack pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah we're here to bring forth the full strength of the full word of god to manifest it amen to bring forth the entire word of god so not just justification not just sanctification not just the gifts of the spirit but the whole thing together hallelujah this is what we've got to go and tell that's why we can say i serve a living god jesus christ is alive and he does actually transform people's lives it's not seven steps to becoming a christian it's actually you just meet him and he'll make you the christian to repent and be baptized name the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost hallelujah i'm so glad it's that way hallelujah amen jesus himself taught that this would happen and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and and should sleep and rise night and day and seed should spring forth and grow up he knows not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade justification then the air sanctification after that the full corn in the air and when the fruit is brought forth immediately he pulled he he put us in the sickle because the harvest has come that's the restoration it's actually in the scripture hallelujah and here we are we where are we when the fruit is brought forth hallelujah that's why you should be able to read the scripture and see the same life that's in the word is in you the same book of acts same things happen in the book of acts you see it in your life the same character that christ had when you read the sermon on the mount i trust you can see yourself in the sermon on the mount blessed are the meek blessed the peacemaker blessed all these ones you should be able to see the life you're living you should see it in the sermon on the mount why because the one that gave the servant the one that gave the sermon and the mount is in you hallelujah that's how it should be love your enemies amen amen bless them that despitefully use you amen glory we should be that way yes it's easy to love those that love you but what about those who don't love you i mean if the capstone of divine love has come upon our lives we should love those who don't love us we should pray for those who despisely use us shouldn't we be that way we shouldn't be looking for revenge and serve some right kind of times though we should pray for them from our hearts not because we're taught to you know anyway that's how it should be we should have such a life in our it should be such the life of god should be flowing because if we are if we are now in a ripened in a in a harvest condition laying in the presence of the sun then all the greenness of our humanity should be baked out pretty much and that golden deity should come forth what is that that's the love of god manifested yes that's right hallelujah and that's not a wishy-washy i love you kind of love no it's a real genuine love that goes beyond feeling amen amen because of the if it's the love of god in you and that person doesn't love you you will love them because it's not based on what they do to you but the redeeming love in you wants to go to them you don't want to see them in their pit you don't want to see them in their conflicts and their condition and their malice and their trouble but you want them to be lifted up and lifted and friends of god and god will change their lives isn't that what we want to see hallelujah isn't it a glorious thing when you're it's incredible to see you know we pray for a physical healing and god comes on the scene that's a wonderful glorious thing but holy isn't it more of a wonderful glorious thing where someone's life has changed so is maybe crippled up and so angry and fighting and fussing and trouble whatever but now they're just so loving so peaceful the whole character's been made different hallelujah that's the kind of healing that i want to see but that's being in a different atmosphere than the then than the atmosphere in the world because the atmosphere in the world is dog-eat-dog what can i get out of you and i'll use you until i'm done and then i'll find someone else that's that's how the world works that's the problem with you know dating and relationships whatever more it's all about what can i get we'll get into that tonight i promise promised my life i wouldn't mention any of this stuff this morning yeah but you know it's all about what can i get and if it doesn't work you see it in business it works for me well then i'll do business with you because it works for me but in the christian world if it doesn't work for me i'll still work for you i'll still do it for you because i just should be redeeming love in my life you know it's very easy to it's very easy to hang around those that you enjoy to hang around but what about those who you find it hard to fellowship with what about those ones remember we are are we will not one body if my you know if i i used to have an ingrown toenail when i was at uh school you never notice your toenails until you need to cut them but then when you get an ingrown toenail you notice it all the time because there's a pain in the body something's not right something's been rubbing and now there's a problem right but i don't cut my toe off i don't put some kind of you know i don't i don't get rid of my toe just because i've got ingrown toenail i want that fixed it it bothers me that it's not fine and it should be the same thing with you and i if we see someone go through something it's not now i need all the details should be lo you should be interceding we should be interceding for one another and because that's part we're all part of the same body if one part suffers we all suffer if one part is doing well we're all doing well hallelujah amen oh isn't it blessed to be part of the family of god hallelujah now now christ in this day that we live in is still deity identifying himself deity among the people he's still deity because he is the word and when we see the word living itself then we know that man can't do that it's deity the word being made manifest by man jesus said himself the son can do nothing in himself i can't do nothing i'm a man jesus here but my father that dwelleth in me he showeth me all things that himself doeth amen there you are what is it deity being identified in man now the same thing is today that deity the promised word for this day can identify itself in you hallelujah amen then you give your whole to it show that you believe in it give it deity believe it serve it and be ready to die out to yourself pardon me and your own thoughts but today it's rejected as it was then amen but when you see that promised word what is the promised word of this day that a people will grow into the fullness of the statue of christ she is him brother abraham says the bride is him because we are no longer ourselves it's no longer either liveth but christ that liveth in me that's why that's why he can say that she is him because she is so dead she's not living herself but the word has put on flesh in her i mean that her whole identity is in the word it's not her own identity it's in the word right hallelujah and that's and that's how we should be amen amen my identity is not the with my first birth my identity is in the message of the hours the living word of god amen yes sir amen hallelujah jesus said these words and afterwards he appeared unto 11 as they said um at meat i won't be too much longer and uprighted them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and they said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature amen every creature you can you can preach the gospel because the because the gospel is the pound demonstration of the holy ghost right so you can you can speak to the storm you can speak to nature amen hallelujah i had times in papua new guinea when you know when when i used to go up there in the summer time well our summer time it's their monsoon season i know i've probably seen this before but i'll i'll say it again you know and and so there'd be heaps of like it would rain not like here it would rain like monsoon rain is the next level thing and and what would happen is as as the church where past emas is it's it's out in the village you need a 4x4 to get there on a good day and if it's raining you it's very hard to get in around and so this and then what would happen is normally in the morning time would be sunny and then then dark clouds would come over just buck it down for the rest of the day and then maybe that rain would last you know a few days so so whenever they you know i would not be i'd either be in total at the church or i'd be at my parents place but i need to get there or come home i'd say and and and then rain would begin to fall i'd say lord send the rain away i need to i need to travel what happened the rain would go away and i came back to new zealand after the mission trip and i emailed my mum how things are going and she said well the roads are just like rivers we can we can ask the lord to move things around we can can't we you know how many how many testimonies of south africa people praying for crops and you know rain to come and think and it happens well that's faith hallelujah amen amen he that believeth is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe these signs shall follow them that go tell amen in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with you tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and said on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with him and confirming the word with signs following amen amen now you don't have to be a preacher for the for for signs to follow hallelujah you don't have to be a preacher for the lord to confirm the word you can be testifying to someone and then the lord will come down supernaturally and confirm that word to them i mean for those people to see what you're saying is not man's idea it's god's word hallelujah so that's how we go tell the lord confirms the word i love that last verse you know people say and and and it's in some footer notes in some bibles that um these verses are not in the original manuscripts but irenaeus quoted it and also brother brown you know gives a story of a you know of a of a lady that that had had i think one son and that son went to a bible college and and while he was away at bible college you know he received a telegram from her mom that she was very sick needs to come home real soon and then no news came and he didn't go home and then like a year later he went home and his mom's fine and so she asked her i mean he he asked her rather mum what happened you know you sent word that i was you know that you're really sick but now you're well and and she said well you know i was i was really sick that's why i sent you the telegram but but i got a knock on the door one day and there's a lady from that you know you know you're a christian lady and said that we were praying you know we had a little prayer meeting and and the lord put it on my heart to come talk to you because i want you know would it be okay if you come speak with my pastor because we believe god's real and then and then he you know and then so he read he read to me out of the scripture they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and they prayed for me in order to you know anointed me with oil according to the word different things you know and hallelujah i'm healed and and and he said to her well you know don't you know that last part of john that you're referring to is not inspired and she just says praise the lord and and he says mother what's wrong with you begin to act like those people in that mission you went to and and she said well praise the lord you know if that's not inspired and god he'll be with it what can god do with the inspired word but we know the entire word is inspired hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people they're speaking of restoration now but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not the simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent weasley and he was the voice with with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles written on of all men for their generation when the methodists failed god raised up others and and so it has gone on through the years until on this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's talking about you by the way if you're thinking who are these people the final who will be under their messenger no we'll be the final voice of the final age that's you god has to have a living witness in every generation here you are in 20 21 almost at 2012 i don't know how i got there yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelations verse 17. the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course the word bride will be repudiated as in the last ages which is judged to be false but it's not false amen amen now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you are you have more bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debating it now i'm thinking but there's a there's a people who are not under this condition this is the ladies condition there's a people who are interested in living it and not debating it there are people who want the entire world because you think about it i've never seen at a at a wedding ceremony a bride marrying half a groom i'm talking about someone who's been surgically cut in half i've never seen that i've seen this entire you know sure there's people who don't have limbs and i'm i'm talking about someone who's been surgically cut in half maybe the bride only wants the head doesn't want the body i've never seen someone marry a head this sounds ridiculous but this is what people do with the scripture they only take the bits they want and they leave the bits they don't want what they're doing they're uniting themselves with part of the word which is not the whole bridegroom i want all of them i want all of jesus hallelujah amen so there's a people who are interested in living it and not debating it and the reason is they're interested in living it is because they see the potential in the word of what the lord does hallelujah amen that's why when we come to church we come under expectation because we see the potential of a meeting amen prayed up in our hearts all forgiveness gone i mean i mean all unforgiveness gone rather that's why we have the music playing beforehand we can come in and meditate and read the word and you know and that's why we have the music playing afterwards we can stay and pray i mean that's why we're interested in keeping a good atmosphere in the service because we see the potential of the service hallelujah do we not that's why that's the whole purpose of church georgia church order that god would come down and manifest himself that's why we see the potential of it i mean we see the potential of prayer meetings now you probably can't see that very well sorry but here's peter i thought a picture you know because all i do is put you know here's peter and he's chained to the two guards they had prayer meeting for him in that day because they saw the potential of what god can do because they already had testimony that the disciples that were imprisoned got led out by an angel did they not before this it happened i mean so they came together and they prayed because they saw what the lord can do because they could go draw back from past experience and say hey these other brothers got set free out of prison by the lord peter's in prison he can be set free sure they want to cut his head off but who says they'll have their way hallelujah why don't we just intercede and let god have his way and if god allows his head to be taken off that's god's will but if not praise the lord he's still got a work to do remember nothing can take our lives until we have served god's purpose hallelujah i mean so they came together because they could draw them past experience that the lord can get him out of prison now you just think about where we are in 2021 we can draw back from all the testimonies there's ever been and we can say well the lord delivered this one and the lord healed that one and the lord set this one free come on friends just think about what we can draw we can see the potential and lord you don't change you're the same yesterday today and forever so if you can do it back there you can do it today if you can set him out of prison you can set people out of prison today hallelujah you know we've got uh brothers in china that are in prison for this message and they're being a living witness in prison hallelujah they're not letting their little you know their circumstances get them down they're going and telling yeah hallelujah hallelujah so you know we should see the potential that's why it's so important you know jesus is here and i think i'll do i have any pretty much going to close with this he says verily i sound to you whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven this talking to you and again i send you if two of you shall agree on earth as touching thing yeah what's anything anything it's not limited to a certain things it's anything if then if that if two of you i just want to repeat this because this this blows my mind because the lord doesn't give a promise well given the ability to manifest that promise he doesn't put out empty words this is not motivational speak this is a reality his word is reality that if two of you shall agree on earth is touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven anything two of you agree on earth amen hallelujah now that agreeing it means to be harmonious this is in the greek it means to be harmonious to be of a chord so it's more than just it's more than just agreeing in here we can mentally agree on a lot of things but we've got to agree in here amen so to me now because we see the potential of what god can do because he can do anything let's agree for our families let's agree let's agree for a revival let's agree let's agree to see that you know that the sick are healed amen let's agree for the lord to move in power let's agree for every promise in the word it's ours let's agree for a rapture let's agree from chronicles to come home let's agree for a refilling of the holy ghost let's agree well it doesn't matter if you're on the other side of the world you can't get them let's agree they couldn't get in prison and do it but god went in and did it hallelujah so let's agree that god can do anything that's why we should be in agreement that's why i say we're praying for one another we're praying for each other's families we're praying for their spiritual yo for their salvation for their deliverance whenever they be let's agree oh but you don't know who they are and this and it doesn't matter that's irrelevant yes hallelujah the prodigal son went a long way did a lot of things it didn't matter he had parents that were praying hold on children hallelujah but let's agree hallelujah amen amen no i'm not saying we don't but you know i believe in looking at people they actually want the best for each and every one of us yeah we're not trying to be better than i'm better than this family and better than these people and did it no this is not how we operate i don't think i believe we're in it to win it together amen amen but let's agree touching if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that ye shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven and what's the burden on our hearts we want to see people saved amen i want to find that last one amen wouldn't that be cool that last one stumbles in this door is maybe sitting here right now they meet the lord we're going home amen amen hallelujah but whosoever will let them come yes sir amen he says he asks this question do you believe with all your heart the angel of the lord accompanies the message always that's why we can go and tell because the angel lord accompanies the message hallelujah have you made your decision that he's god then put your hands over on one another we don't want to wait till tomorrow night let it be tonight when the holy ghost spoke to me a few minutes ago i don't i didn't wait till tomorrow night tonight's the night for healing tonight's the night for forgiveness lay your hands over on one another so the angel of the lord accompanies the message always so when we go and tell it's not our own it's not the power of our persuasion it's not how we can articulate things it's he will confirm his word you say i don't know how to put it all together tell how your candle got lit people are looking for reality amen that's what they want they want reality and we have a reality to give them of a resurrected lord jesus christ who's alive his word is real he's present hallelujah amen so i i just leave it there i'll say go tell yes go tell yes wherever you go in this world go tell you i serve a risen savior he's in the world today amen hallelujah i mean let's stand uh this morning hallelujah [Applause] i mean the musicians please i mean do we have that song i serve a live um i serve a
