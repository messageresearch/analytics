========================================

[Music] God bless you saints. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Let's just stand this evening and open in a word of prayer. [Music] Thank you, Lord, for this wonderful day that you've given us, Lord, and that you've been with us every step of the way, Lord. And Lord, that we could come here tonight once again, Lord Jesus, to your house, Lord, to come and hear from you once again, oh Lord.

We are challenged from every side, Lord. But we are ascending, my God. We are on our way up, Lord. And sometimes you must you must look down, Lord, and think, why are we going so slow, Lord? And just forgive us. But may we just keep on moving. May we just keep on going up, Lord. May we come closer to our friophony, to our Lord Jesus that will come and just take us off this earth, Lord. Lord, I pray that that you be with us tonight, Lord, I pray that you take these little chopped up words, Lord. Lord, nothing that I can put together, but it is through your sovereignty and the order that you've bestowed upon me, Lord, to to give to this little body of believers, Lord. And may this revival fire bright uh shine brightly tonight, Lord. May you feel welcome in our midst, Lord. Thank you so much for the musicians, technical team, Lord, helping to create this atmosphere, Lord. we you can dwell, Lord, and amongst these hearts where you can dwell. Lord, I pray that you take every spirit that is contrary to your word, Lord, and kick it out now in Jesus Christ's name. I pray that every heart that's in here be receptive, Lord, for the word to come to to receive, to have uh some fresh mana, Lord, for the road that's ahead. and just be with your servant now, Lord, um as I speak the words of life in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Well, it is Wednesday night, brothers and sisters. Um if I can maybe use Brother David Lee's maybe not here, but um today is the best day of my life because we are one step closer to heaven, right? Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. Wonderful atmosphere. Um and we'll um we'll start reading. I just want to welcome brother Jeff and Sister Beatus. Wonderful to have you [Applause] here. Always a big spoil for me standing at the back and there's newcomers coming in. I like that. I love that. Now midweek. Wow. This must be Christmas. Okay, let's read from our from our Bible, from the word. 1 Corinthians 16:13. 1 Corinthians 16 13 and say amen if you're there. Watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men. Be strong. God bless you. May you have your seats tonight and may God bless the the reading of his word. So, just to maybe get me my nerves a little bit settled, I thought I'll um I'll just give a bit of a a quick testimony or two and then um jump into the thought that I have for tonight. I'll start my stopwatch. Um, I just want to first and foremost really thank you all for for the prayers for the prayers to the NIA family. Um, I would say the last 18 months has been um, awesome. Um, if you if you if you believe in testimonies and trials and challenges and going up um, but um, yes, thank you. it it's really carrying us and I'm I'm just seeing the uh the fruits of it. Um the Lord's just working tremendously from every every side and every angle and direction. And um I just want to quickly um people that might not know and I just want to briefly touch on it a testimony from our from my South African trip and then a testimony just you know in in searching for a job. Now, you've all seen um a lot of a lot of prayer requests going for me for a for a job or where the Lord wants me. Um it's it's a tremendous time because um I'm not actually asking the Lord per se for a job. I'm asking for his perfect will. And that is sometimes quite different to our expectation as as humans, as as men, as husbands, as providers to the family. So um but I'll I'll share this the the testimony South African trip. My my dad passed away. It's almost now a year ago on the on the day. So, I think it was the 18th of May and um everything worked so tremendously um timing wise and again the Lord was in this um that that I was able to fly with the with the limitations and restrictions we had. I didn't have a passport. Passport expired. had to get a emergency travel uh certificate and that could be done within the time frame and I could fly and basically in short flew about probably close to 12,000 kilometers. I was about 1,000 ks away from seeing my my dad. Not a lot of people know this, but um I think it's it must have been on the plane. And I was probably listening to a to a a sermon um and somewhere it dropped just into me that when Jesus went to Gyrus's um daughter and he laid upon her that image stuck with me and I thought and and and and I knew in my my heart if I do this to my dad if I throw my body on top of him he will recover. He will heal. And that was that was what I walked with, right? The Lord had other plans. And I was about 1,000 km away uh into this almost 12,000 km flight. And I got the news that he passed away in this and and all this the trial coming from there coming back all that through this timing. The Lord showed me he's in control. His plans is not our plans. His thoughts is not our thoughts. And that's that's that's what I took. I was surrendered in him. And I was um I wouldn't say happy. I was I was joyful that the Lord is sovereign in my life and in my family's life and all the plans that he's prepared before the foundation of the this earth. The testimony of searching for a job. I'm actually quite gutted. Brother brother Isaac is not here. Hopefully, he's listening and streaming. But um through numbers of this last job and I'll I'll I'll quickly state that um the job I applied for okay so I applied for about 109 jobs from end of Jan to now. So uh that was now before last year. So from end of Jan to to now where we now the 5th 6th of Mar May or somewhere um 109 jobs but I got one interview and the screening that I did with the HR lady um by the way her name was um EFA or Eve um and the company I applied for I'll just say the prefix of it is Miracle. So I thought this is interesting that the name got me and that's why I guess one of the reasons I applied um and the first uh the screening went well and the first um interview that we had um was also sort of not expected. It was an in-person interview and today's age is very easy to have a first interview technical things or maybe if it for team to just do it over teams or Skype Skype is probably no no longer anymore. Um and um and this HR lady said, "No, it's in person and there's three people meeting me, brother Isaac. Three." So these three gentlemen meet met me and they all under three years for this company. They were working less than three years for this company. The first guy I met's name was Adam. And I go, "That's interesting." So I've met Adam and I've met Eve. This is a miracle that I'm here. Um very interesting and the the interview went very well. I thought no I haven't heard back um today or this week I I should hear back and when I went back to home and um sort of un unwind and I saw seek that I applied through sent me an email to say that the candidates the the the the the vacancy has closed and it's done. And at the bottom they say how many candidates um applied for this job. And it said 77 candidates applied for this job. And I thought isn't that interesting that seven comes out and three comes out and Adam and Eve is there. And that's all in the middle of a miracle. It's it's incredible. Now the Lord's also prepared me for this that through this numbers God just showed he's in control. If it's a yes, he's in control. If it's a no, he's in control. So, I just wanted to leave that there with you and uh try and settle my nerves. So, tonight we are I want to speak on for today. I must abide in thy house. Now, I wrote here in my notes, children, I promise there's pictures. Just Just hold on. Okay, I'll get to it. There is pictures coming. Okay, we first need to get some of these adult stuff out of the way. So, yeah, bear with me, please. So, if I can refer back to our first scripture, watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit ye like men. Quit me. Uh, caught me quite. And this is I think I I think this is where the thought sort of um sort of germinated if I can say is the word quit. I had to go and I don't speak English so I had to go and look up what what this in in this context what the word quit mean quit in the scripture here does not refer quit like we know it otherwise the sentence will not read correctly so you know quit we quit quit you like men and be strong that's sort of a paradox right there so I had to go and look and this quit is behavior or conduct or carry Conduct yourselves like men and be strong. I said, "Aha." Then I did some some quick searches and it seems like the Bible only uses this quit in this context within the Bible. Never it uses quit as in how we understand it today in the modern version. So it's always as a conduct or as a behavior. And that made me start thinking about quitting like we understand quitting, giving up, about surrendering. Now this is fascinating cuz as I got the thought as I got the thought um I was as a as a minister when you come here you always want to preach what and and give the people what God wants them to hear and never what I want you to hear. There's there's a few thoughts I want you to hear. It is not the Lord's will that you need to hear them, but uh it's is really good ones. It's actually very good. So, I'll use that for a for a youth service one day or some sort of youth camp where I can get some vigor and um but no and and and last Sunday um brother Ben preached and and and I'm sure maybe some of you might have missed it. I thought it felt like a perfect segue that the Lord planned to say, I want you to I wanted to say this. I want you to go down this this vein and I've quoted him by using a YouTube and transcript, but he was offended. So now, brother Ben here is talking about Peter, right? Uh he was offended and denied the Lord. He swore and cursed and doing all these things before the crucifixion. But he thought my willpower I can be a real Christian. It ain't willpower. It's give up. It's surrender. Oh, there it is again. Okay. Because and this give up, surrender. Oh, that's weakness. No, that's strength. Because when you give up, then you then he can take over. Amen. the unconquerable, allconquering, all powerful Lord God Almighty can step into your human battles and take over. Okay? And that was that was confirmation. I had two thoughts coming together here. That's the first thought. I said, "Well, praise the Lord. We'll we'll hit this vein then." So, I started studying about that and got everything together. So now, not to leave you guys and myself um without uh with with with confusion, let's break down this quickly and build a little foundation. What is give up and what is surrender? Right? And here's give up. Well, can read there. It's not too small. Praise the Lord. Give up to healed uh control or possession. Surrender. I go, "Oh, okay. That starts off to be it looks like it can be interchangeable, you know, give up and surrender cuz there they use it." And then it carries on to desist and abandon. I go okay that's taking a turn to declare incurable and insoluble it goes okay um doctors will get to a point where they will give up you know cancer patients or um leukemia whatever it is they they can give up and this is where they say incurable. Um we've got a wonderful testimony of Sister Lundy that said uh one morning. She went to the doctor um unaccompanied by me. She's she's um we'll sort that out between me and her. I didn't accompany her. I didn't drive her there. She was really in a in a bad state. I was getting the kids ready for church. And this is all law led by the Lord and she the doctor just said, "Well, you're my mystery case for the day, you know." And that was it. The doctors gave up. So here we are to abandon oneself to a particular feeling or influence gave them into despair. We' given you up. So little bit uh dropping down there to number five. We've given you up. So Lord have mercy. If he g given up on us uh where would we be? You know, to seize doing or attempting something, especially as admission of defeat, and then drop right down, giving up the ghost, to cease to live or function. Die. That sounds quite horrible and very, very negative. So, no, the two words is not interchangeable. Cannot be used. Get here we go. Surrender to yield to the power. It starts off again. controlled possession of another compulsion or demand to give up completely or agree to forgo especially in favor of another. Okay, now we getting somewhere. What is it talking about here? And right there at the bottom to give oneself up into the power of another and healed. So here the word healed is quite important for me because that to me feels like that's more a surrender than giving up. I'm yielding to something to something higher a higher power. Right? So we've got the two definitions out so I can take my lab coat off and we can crack into what is this um how does this look like? How does it how does it um how would that speak to you? Uh sort of on a practical sense maybe surrender versus giving up. Giving up is rooted in defeat. Giving up feels like a soul slump. It's the moment you throw your hands in the air not in worship but in weariness. It's when you say, "I guess this isn't for me." And just walk away. Not because you were led, but because you were crushed by discouragement. Giving up is born from fear. Fear that things don't won't change. Fear that you're not enough. Fear that you misheard God or that he's gone silent. I've had that quite a bit this uh last couple of months, last few months actually. Um, giving up. It's passive. It's heavy. It leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. Abandon something sacred. That's the feeling it leaves you with. Surrender. Surrender is rooted in trust. Surrender. Surrender is powerful. It's active. It's brave. It's bold. you will take that leap. You will be um as Joshua said, be be strong and very courageous. Right? That's where we're going to. Um it releases control or you release control. I release control. Um not because I'm losing, but because I know you're winning. The Lord's winning. Surrender is not walking away. It's walking with God. Even when you don't see what's ahead. It's putting your dreams, your relationships, and your battles at his feet. Not in despair, but in faith. Amen. Giving up says, "I can't do this anymore." Surrender says, "God, I was never meant to do this without you." One is hollow. One is holy. You still with me? You love the Lord. Okay. So, let's crack into this. So, why surrender? Lord, why do you want me to surrender? Lord, why do you want to uh let me give up maybe give up my dreams here on earth and surrender my whole vessel, my whole heart, see see me as an as an empty uh wine vat, and come and refill me. Why, Lord? And Jesus said unto them, "If foxes have holes, and birds in the air have nests, but the son of man hath not where to lay his head." This morning's uh daily altar, if you read that, who read that? This morning's one, that was the confirmation to the second piece of my thought because that was the very first thing I wanted to highlight in my in my sermon. So, that got stolen. that just got uh got taken. And that that's the Lord's hand. That's absolutely the Lord's hand. So Jesus at the wedding feast, he comes where he is invited, right? That's why we surrender. And straighten way many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive him. No, not so much as about the door. And he preached the word unto them. And they come to him bringing one sick of the pulsy which was born of four. So they were four people carrying him. and they could not come nigh unto them for the press. They uncovered the roof where he was, and they had broken it up. They led him down the bed wherein the sick of the pulse he lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the pulse, his son, thy sons be forgiven. What was striking here, they did not say one word. They caused the ruckus. Okay, go preach the gospel. You can just carry on and walk and be in conduct. Be strong, you know, be upright. Don't have to say a word. Jesus will see your faith. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. So marvelous time in Oakuckland. So in Oakland, we had this wonderful time of fellowship of camp. Brother Andrew, brother David Silas just came together. So awesome. But for me the importance is also the fellowship among the brethren. So I usually try and have a bit of a one-to-one. So had a chat with this brother and we were just discussing you know like the healing where one of the sermons where brother Brandham healed a particular person and it's awesome and it's just struck me. I go well praise the Lord we don't have to live in 1965. We're living right now. And I gave him the testimony of Omar Robin and just came forward and she got a healing and she was she was she was healed in Jesus Christ's name. I said, "Praise the Lord." We we we don't we don't pray and we don't worship this God of history, but he's the same today, forever and yesterday. Then we It was also um incredible how the Lord orchestrated this from from a from a mistake. So from a mistake end quote um this brother I asked him send me the address of your church and uh he sent me but he sent it he didn't send it to me so I stopped him and I confronted him I said have you sent it and he's on his phone yes I sent it I said I haven't received it he said but I can see it's the two ticks you know WhatsApp has got the two blue ticks I said but I haven't received it he goes Oh, it's the wrong brother. Sorry. Sent it to the wrong brother. Name's sake. Right. So, he sent it to me. Sends sends this to me. Maybe I can read that to you then in reply. So, this is now camp and we setting up camp. Uh, sorry. We we packing up helping them. And um he sent me he sent me this um a couple of days later. That was about two days later. This is the reply. So we sent this by mistake to this other brother for not coming to church for a long time. Don't know how to come back again. Glad to see your message. Even though it was just three words, it carries a lot of meaning. Three words was all I need to show me the way back. A light in the dark. Any other reason, any other person wouldn't see the deep meaning. Only the messenger and the person receiving the message know what it means. I thank the Lord for your life and for someone that the Lord can use. God bless you abundantly. And those three words was the uh church address 30 stood road and that he didn't know how to come back and that's how so by a mistake the Lord can still use the testimony. He is alive today brothers and sisters. I cannot tell you how much alive. Right. So quickly let's jump back to that previous story and just we read now about where where these people with their faith dropped their their beloved down to get healed and they got healed. He got healed by their faith. Now if we talk about the testimonies of now and not of yesterday year in our little body of believers, who do you think can we put in there? Who would be one of those four that will break off a roof and drop someone down, get him close to Oh. Oh, is it? Oh, is it? Okay. Who can tell me who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Can you see who's that? Brother Ben Bailey and Brother Armand on the left. They love breaking things. Trust me, I work with them. They love breaking things. So here, not maybe a roof, but they took off the fence to get this uh cherry picker through and get on the roof on the chimney. Put a little top. What do you call that top again? It's just a cap. Cap. See, I can't speak English. And and and that's and that's and I amen on that. That's a brother that will that will break down the walls. that will break the roof to get that last one in cuz we are going up, right? I'll give you another example. And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And behold, there was a man called Zakius, which was his chief among the publicans. And he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and could not for the press because he was a little of stature. Maybe a clue. And he ran before and climbed up in a sycamore tree to see him. for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said to him, "Zakius, make haste, and come down, for today I must abide at thy house." And he made haste and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all of them, they all murmured. They say, "That was going to be a a guest with a man that's a sinner. So, okay, let's place us there. Let's place ourselves there. Are we or were we all not sinners? And Jesus came our way. What mercy. So, Gakus stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half are we there?" Yes. Half of my goods I give to the poor. He hasn't done it. He will do it right now. For I've taken and and if I've taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him four-fold. And Jesus said unto them, "This day uh is salvation come to this house for so much as you also is a son of uh of Abraham." Now using this example, thinking about our little body of congregation uh body body of believers, who do you think would this fit uh with uh our little Zakius? Our little Zakius. And Jesus said unto them, "This day is salvation. Come to this house." Amen. For as much he is also a son of Abraham. Now I'll pause you there and I'll tell you why I thought of him. Not of what everyone thinks, right? Okay. Not the white elephant in the room. Zakius met Jesus up in the air. And that guy Yes, sir. got changed, got transformed on a plane ride to New Zealand. Amen. And just to think if if if he had a passenger, if he had a a relative with him that you were flying alone, eh, they would not have fathomemed what would have gone on between Chile and New Zealand. It would have been back to the future type things. He was a new creation when he got off here and the Lord got hold of him up there in the air. Praise the Lord. Hey, a few few hours with him and that's it. you are a a changed man and I wish so you had a a photo of you in the plane. I was just man we were trying but anyway I I was really blessed by that when I saw Zakius and I thought a yes this this fits perfectly cuz it is it is our Jimmy and Jimmy received him joyfully joyfully not with happiness. Now, I just want to make a little segue to give a little bit of context about this happiness thing. Now, Jordan Peterson, someone interviewed him one time and um he he asked him, "Are you happy?" And the interview started in this this weird way and and the the the the interviewer said, "So what should I ask you that will that will make it more I guess compelling or more I more empathy or something? Is it are you happy or is it just and as he wanted to say this, Jordan says, "How am I? How are you?" And he goes, "How are you? How are you doing?" And he breaks down. He cracks up. He He There he is. The tears are going. How are you doing? And then his response from there is like, you know, and you know how philos philosophical he gets. But this got me. So bear with me. You know, when you listen to a profound piece of music and see how it ties it in now with good old Jimmy there in the back. Hey, profound piece of music. Some some sort of spans the whole emotional experience. It's not happy. Happy is elevator music and probably you shouldn't listen to it at all. Right? And you think why? Well, it's harmless. It's strictly. It's sweet. It's simple, but it lacks depth. It's shallow. And that's a problem. Now, tying that back to and Jimmy received him joyfully and we received him joyfully when he came our way. He needed a house to meet you. He wants to dwell in your house. Amen. He wants to have fellowship while dwelling in your house. And how much more can we not um be joyful? Happiness is a is an emotion. It's a state here on earth just so limited. But didn't didn't David say restore the joy of my salvation? Doesn't it say count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptation? count a joy and I'm counting a joy. The Lord knows my heart, but he needs that house to dwell in. And that's why that's why we need to surrender. If I um if I can call up the musicians and we can maybe start winding this down. I just want to to leave you with a few thoughts then. Matthew 26. Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread. And the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, where wil thou uh that we prepare for thee to eat this uh Passover? And he said, "Go into the city to such a man, to such a woman, to such a child, to go, the master saith, my time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples." But a minister come, the preacher come, your friend, maybe from school or whoever come sit next to you in the pew and say, "The master said that your time is nigh. Your time is at hand." And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed him, and they made them ready the Passover. Now when the evening was come, he sat down with the twel. It is thus sayeth the Lord. Now please see yourself in this. See yourself that your your master is looking for that house to dwell in, to have the Passover, to have that meal, that special time uh with you. And while I was looking for um sort of a place to end, I wanted to say or see what the what what the prophet says about surrender and how did he use it? And and I knew that and and a lot of the prayer lines and a lot of the ways that he ends his prayers is is that I'm surrendered to you, Lord. I surrender to you. But this one just pops out and and and I think it's so relevant for us today. I think of our president across there in that meeting now with the nation of Russia knowing that have every the very weapon that will blow this place till there wouldn't be hardly life left on it again and could do it before day's dawn in the morning and then God I think what keeps them from doing it because there's some righteous people yet praying and God have mercy I pray father have mercy grant tonight than this little church sitting here as a lighthouse. A group of people who surrender their hearts, lives, everything they've got, willing, willingly walk out just now and give their life freely for the cause. They believe in you, Lord. Oh father, I pray that you'll endure with them with great power tonight. Great power of faith and may every thought be moved from their mind, from their subconscious that it will be contrary to your divine plan tonight. Take it away, Father, and be with us now. And that's what I really if that's your desire tonight. If that's if if the Lord's speaking to you, if he's saying move now, surrender now, open your heart now. You know, if this is your desire, he wants all of you. He wants to occupy your whole house, will you receive him [Music] joyfully? Is tonight the appointed time that Jesus comes to your house? And is tonight the appointed time where you surrender a bit more or even fully to his perfect will for your life to this word in due season. I'll c close in prayer and then while you raise your hands and while you are surrendered in this atmosphere and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, Lord Jesus, I I say thank you, Lord, that I could just be a messenger, Lord, and then just deliver the mail. Lord, so many times there's neighborhoods where this messenger has to run through and there's angry dogs, Lord, that they want to attack, Lord, and I have to be quick and I have to stay focused, Lord, that this message get to the get to the address, Lord. Get to the destination to that surrendered vessel, Lord. But I pray that it gets there and I pray that that that gets opened in now in this due season, Lord. Lord, that it maybe to glorify your name to maybe to just get us one step closer, Lord, to that wonderful time when we will have no pain and no suffering, Lord. We don't have to stand here, Lord, and just uh or be on our knees, Lord, in our prayer closets saying, "Boy, where's that last one?" Praying for our children, Lord. Lord, I pray that you just be with us now as we as we just enter in a time of prayer. Lord, may you just have preeminence and and the rest of the service. I pray that you that you take full control, Lord. see every heart, see every need, Lord. You know the desires of our hearts. We love you, Lord. We appreciate you. And you just cannot stop looking after us, Lord. You cannot stop loving us, Lord. You are keeping, you are so persistent, Lord. You're holding our hand. We cannot even let go, my God. And I praise you that we that we did that. We made that step in obedience and in faith that we surrendered. Thank you my Lord. May we sing this now in Jesus Christ's name. I want more as brother Ben comes. I want [Music] more. Jesus. I want more. I want [Music] more. I want [Music] more. I want [Music] [Applause] more. I want more. [Music] Oh Jesus, I want more.

Can Can you put up that last quote that brother Ed read? I can find it here. Just think about this. [Music] Grant tonight, he says, "Why? What keeps the chaos breaking out upon the world?" Because there's some righteous people yet praying, "Oh God, have mercy." I pray, Father, have mercy. Grant tonight in this lovely little church sitting here as a lighthouse, a group of people who surrender their hearts, lives, everything they've got, willing to walk out just now and give their life freely for the cause. A surrendered heart. See, surrender is power, as Brother Ed was saying. I'm not trying to repeat what I saying as well. I just pray this sinks in. There's still peace upon the earth. Chaos hasn't broken out cuz there's surrendered vessels who say, "Lord, I want more of you, Lord. I want you to live, Lord. Here I am, Lord. Take over. Use me for your glory, Lord. You're very powerful people." Thank you so much, brother. I really appreciate that for tonight. Amen. God bless you. I'm just going to read some prayer requests and then um if you have uh any then um Amen. We're going to um yeah then I'll then I'll ask them then we'll go into prayer.
