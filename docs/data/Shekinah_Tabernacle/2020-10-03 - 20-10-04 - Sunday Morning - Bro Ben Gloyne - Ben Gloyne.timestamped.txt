[19:47] right unusual for me to be here
[19:54] i don't seem to get around there much
[19:56] these days i used to do a lot of
[19:57] travelling and
[19:58] fellowships here and there but these
[20:01] days the wife and i are
[20:02] just happily sitting in mastodon and
[20:06] still enjoying the things of the lord
[20:08] but uh
[20:10] i just thinking um
[20:13] i actually came to the lord 53 years ago
[20:18] and things were so different then
[20:23] they were absolutely in a different
[20:26] world what it is now
[20:29] um anglicans
[20:32] i was an anglican very very strong
[20:34] anglican
[20:36] and uh not that i knew anything but uh
[20:39] church was
[20:40] that's all it was church and whatever
[20:42] the minister said that was it
[20:45] and um wife and i got married in 1963
[20:50] down back a wee while we had our 57th
[20:52] wedding anniversary the other day
[20:55] um and
[20:58] we we were we were what you might say
[21:00] interested
[21:02] christian people um we i was an anglican
[21:05] and my wife was a presbyterian so i said
[21:08] well i tell you what it's no good you're
[21:09] going to the
[21:10] presbyterian church for me going the
[21:12] african church so i will change and
[21:14] become a presbyterian so
[21:17] uh yeah you know what if you do those
[21:19] take the lessons and all the rest to
[21:21] become a
[21:22] presbyterian and um
[21:25] any anyway so hey can we just move this
[21:29] back a little bit brother
[21:34] am i loud enough for you all to hear all
[21:35] right
[21:39] well yeah that's good that's good yeah
[21:42] anyway
[21:42] uh actually just before we go any
[21:44] further could we just pray
[21:48] dear lord this morning
[21:51] oh jesus
[21:56] look what i feel you presence here
[22:00] hallelujah
[22:03] my lord my savior
[22:07] lord as i share these things this
[22:09] morning
[22:11] they mean so much to me
[22:14] because you are my life
[22:17] outside of you lord i have nothing
[22:21] oh jesus may your presence just touch
[22:25] everyone this morning
[22:30] what a savior lord i just pray that you
[22:35] just forgive me for my ways and may the
[22:39] brethren be blessed
[22:40] lord because we're glorifying you
[22:43] it's nothing to do with us it's you lord
[22:47] may we just continue to have your way
[22:50] thank you for that i just ask
[22:54] it now in jesus name amen amen
[22:57] thank you lord you know just thinking
[23:01] down through the years brethren
[23:04] you know one of the hardest things for
[23:06] anybody
[23:07] particularly for a man has to humble
[23:09] himself
[23:11] you know here today oh i'm so humble i'm
[23:13] so humble
[23:15] i got no idea what it's like no idea
[23:18] what it's like
[23:19] i've shared my testimony with i know
[23:21] hundreds maybe even thousands of people
[23:24] and just about every time i just i end
[23:26] up in tears because it's real
[23:29] jesus is real amen you know this this
[23:32] whole bible
[23:33] is what revealing jesus christ
[23:37] he is the mystery of god revealed amen
[23:40] today anyway
[23:43] uh as i say the wife and i got married
[23:45] in 63 and we used to
[23:47] we used to read the bible every night i
[23:49] had no idea what it was all about but
[23:52] we read the bible every night and uh
[23:55] in those days if you can if you can just
[23:58] what
[23:59] what i want to try and say today is sort
[24:01] of listen to what i say because
[24:04] in those days there was no such thing as
[24:06] a message
[24:07] there was no william branham it was
[24:10] billy graham came to new zealand and
[24:11] crowds went to here billy graham my wife
[24:13] went to billy graham and she was
[24:15] saved under billy graham's ministry and
[24:18] so she was a christian i mean it was
[24:21] just how crazy it was
[24:22] i was an anglican and i thought i served
[24:26] god you know i can't just i was a good
[24:28] man i didn't do anything wrong sort of
[24:29] thing
[24:30] and but my wife was a uh what do you
[24:33] call those uh youth for christ
[24:35] youth for christ and anyway so i
[24:38] remember one christmas
[24:39] i think might have been just about
[24:41] before married i think
[24:43] and she wanted to go to this this
[24:45] christian camp
[24:47] and so i always remember that why can't
[24:49] i and i said dear i said i will drive
[24:52] you to the camp
[24:54] and i will leave you there but don't you
[24:56] dare ask me to come in
[24:58] so i drove her to the camp stopped the
[25:00] car as she got and the way i went
[25:03] i just was not wanted to be and because
[25:05] i've been trained by my
[25:07] mother particularly a very very strong
[25:09] woman and she said
[25:11] david she said don't ever let anybody
[25:14] get any of these crank religions
[25:16] just stay away from them have nothing to
[25:19] do with them because
[25:20] anglican church is the only way to go
[25:22] and um
[25:24] i went to massey college in 1957 i was
[25:27] there for a year
[25:28] studying poultry farming of all things
[25:31] and uh
[25:32] anyway um there were some guys there had
[25:35] a prayer group
[25:36] and it just just in in me i sort of just
[25:39] sort of thought oh i'd like to be
[25:40] i'd like to be identified with something
[25:42] like that so i went along
[25:44] and i used to sit there in a cold sweat
[25:47] because if they dare ask me to pray i
[25:49] wouldn't know what to do
[25:51] but but there was just something in me i
[25:53] said i like the idea
[25:56] but anyway um we used the wife and i
[25:59] used to read the bible every night
[26:01] and uh if you can just understand in
[26:03] those days there was the anglican church
[26:06] presbyterian church that's all there was
[26:09] and then through circumstances
[26:12] we moved to just outside of gisborne on
[26:15] a farm just outside of gisborne
[26:16] i was meant to be a technician it was a
[26:19] it was a bit of a waste of time i became
[26:21] a farm labourer basically
[26:23] and anyway things things didn't work out
[26:25] things weren't
[26:26] going very well and we had some friends
[26:30] that we'd met
[26:31] previously and and why carawana
[26:34] when we were there and uh they're a
[26:37] lovely people
[26:38] so that they they moved to a podiky and
[26:41] so we
[26:42] one night one weekend we went to stay
[26:43] with them and this lady called vera
[26:46] porter
[26:47] uh she uh she sort of said she said i've
[26:50] just been to
[26:51] an anglican baptism and she said you
[26:54] know in your book
[26:56] your book it says there be baptized and
[26:58] then i
[26:59] uh be baptized and you'll receive the
[27:01] holy ghost
[27:02] she said why don't they leave the name
[27:04] of jesus christ out i said i don't know
[27:07] whatever they say is right and of course
[27:09] we had quite a big discussion
[27:11] and william branham came into the
[27:13] discussion but i sort of said no
[27:15] no no such thing billy graham's the only
[27:18] man of god that the world knows about
[27:20] no anyway so then
[27:23] they got in touch with people called
[27:25] searles and gizman do any of you here
[27:27] know
[27:28] the cells at all red shell okay okay
[27:31] yeah well anyway
[27:33] uh so i got a ring on the phone one day
[27:35] and um
[27:37] guy said god bless you brother this is
[27:39] regell
[27:40] i said oh yeah yeah she said
[27:43] he said we have fellowship every week
[27:46] you know
[27:47] and we'd love you to come along and have
[27:48] fellowship with us so i said
[27:50] thank you very much put the phone down
[27:54] i said to the wife i said no thank you
[27:56] uh but anyway
[27:57] so it so happened i shouldn't be
[28:00] rambling on but
[28:01] it so happened that uh the couple from a
[28:04] poetic
[28:05] came over to our place for a weekend and
[28:07] they wanted to convert us
[28:10] and and they sort of said you know
[28:12] william brown am i no
[28:13] not interested in that stuff she said
[28:15] well what about t.l osborn
[28:17] i said i'll tell you what i said i
[28:19] watched my tv program on saturday night
[28:22] and i said i'll tell you what you have
[28:24] t.l osman for half an hour
[28:26] and then you watch my program far for
[28:28] now hour
[28:30] so they did that so but it meant nothing
[28:32] to me just just there's nothing us
[28:34] anyway so um once again as i say when
[28:37] you think about it
[28:38] practically nobody in new zealand knew
[28:41] anything about william branham there's
[28:42] no such thing as a message or anything
[28:45] and we were just ordinary people that
[28:47] went to church on sunday
[28:49] on sundays and uh anyway so um
[28:54] then we got the when the couple came to
[28:56] see us
[28:57] like the next morning they said oh uh
[29:00] why don't you just come in the meats at
[29:02] that reach shell and we said no i
[29:04] suppose we can't we all get out of it so
[29:05] yeah so
[29:06] we went to gisborne because we lived out
[29:08] of guzman went to gisborne
[29:10] and uh oh and these two old guys come
[29:13] out
[29:14] uh of the house and oh no god bless you
[29:17] this is rich shirl oh big man he was i
[29:20] suppose you remember
[29:21] and another brother called jim hill i
[29:23] don't know anybody remember jim hill
[29:24] at all no okay brother jim
[29:28] anyway hey god bless you god bless you i
[29:30] thought
[29:31] man we're getting involved in this queer
[29:33] outfit and but
[29:34] they were having a meeting just like
[29:36] here this morning and
[29:38] so we got invited into the meeting and i
[29:40] didn't understand anything about it
[29:41] really
[29:42] except i was amazed that one of the
[29:44] sisters sung in tongues
[29:46] never heard it before never just weird
[29:50] weird and and then at the end of the
[29:52] service
[29:53] there was a little boy called john priby
[29:56] and he
[29:57] it was nine months old and he had colic
[29:59] and so they prayed for him well
[30:01] my wife and i had never seen anything
[30:03] like this before
[30:04] it was so amazing or unusual
[30:08] and anyway so we stayed for dinner
[30:10] actually that chap
[30:11] john prieby now is a good um
[30:15] um what should i say what's one of these
[30:18] latest beliefs down in alexandra i saw
[30:21] him just a couple of years ago and we
[30:23] had some time together
[30:24] um but anyway so he's he's healthy
[30:28] um but anyway um we stayed for lunch and
[30:31] then we drove away oh and actually read
[30:33] searle got my wife and i
[30:35] and he talked to us about the revelation
[30:37] of jesus christ
[30:39] and i sort of kept on saying what is he
[30:41] going on about i have no idea why is he
[30:44] pushing this subject anyway so we drove
[30:47] away and i said to my wife
[30:48] i remember going up the hill back to i
[30:51] said dear
[30:52] i said they're nice people but i said
[30:53] we're not going to have anything to do
[30:55] with them
[30:55] we're just not interested in that sort
[30:57] of carry-on okay right
[30:59] so anyway nothing much else happened
[31:02] but then then sort of things went from
[31:04] bad to worse on the farm and
[31:06] oh the far the bickering between the
[31:08] different
[31:09] men on the farm i rosemary and i
[31:12] happened to
[31:13] be in the meat in the sandwich in a way
[31:16] but anyway um on the uh
[31:19] 29th of january 1967.
[31:23] uh we're getting at the bed on the
[31:24] friday thursday night
[31:26] and um rosemary said to me oh she said
[31:29] i'm thinking you're getting baptized i
[31:31] said what
[31:33] she said i'm thinking of getting
[31:34] baptized i said if god wants
[31:37] me to be baptized he's gonna have to
[31:39] tell me
[31:40] full stop okay right so anyway uh
[31:46] that was the end of that but then the
[31:47] next day we went we did our shopping
[31:49] friday night
[31:50] when did our shopping in gisborne and
[31:53] put out and we had two little maori
[31:55] children foster children as well as our
[31:57] little boy
[31:58] and so we got our groceries got our fish
[32:01] sorry got our fish and chips
[32:03] take them home and then and then and we
[32:06] got some groceries
[32:07] from the supermarket and while we were
[32:10] getting this stuff packed for us there
[32:12] was a young sandy head kid there
[32:14] packing out groceries and he said oh he
[32:17] said um
[32:18] why don't you go around to mum and dad's
[32:19] for tea this is
[32:21] howard's earl and uh he was
[32:24] i think 16 or 17 just a young kid and uh
[32:28] oh i said no no no no
[32:31] i couldn't very well tell him we didn't
[32:32] want to go around there um
[32:34] but anyway i said go on go on he said
[32:36] look they'd love to have you
[32:38] and we felt like sort of paupers going
[32:40] into the king's house
[32:41] because they were had a big home nine
[32:43] kids and
[32:44] anyway so no no no no no no they're in
[32:47] the finisher
[32:48] i said to rosemary we're in a bit of a
[32:49] spot aren't we and uh
[32:51] oh okay so we better go around so
[32:55] we went round to their place and and um
[32:57] they had our fashion ships
[32:59] and once again reg started talking the
[33:02] revelation of jesus christ that
[33:04] what's the church built on oh here we go
[33:08] again we're going to have to listen to
[33:09] this again
[33:10] anyway so okay so we had that and then
[33:13] we
[33:14] and we left and um
[33:17] this is where uh things changed
[33:20] because as we are leaving and i'm
[33:23] telling you
[33:24] again nobody knew anything about red's
[33:26] uh brother branham
[33:27] and anyway as we were leaving rich just
[33:30] said
[33:31] oh he said oh by the way brother here's
[33:34] a couple of books
[33:36] you might just like to look at them
[33:37] sometimes oh okay throw them in the car
[33:40] so anyway we got home and i said i said
[33:42] the rosemary well i suppose we'd better
[33:44] have a look at these books see what's
[33:46] this one here beyond the curtain of time
[33:48] oh okay so we started reading it
[33:52] and as i say all these things were me
[33:56] like going into a foreign country a
[33:58] foreign land that i've never experienced
[34:01] or seen anything before
[34:05] and uh anyway um started reading this
[34:09] book
[34:09] before we would put the kids to bed and
[34:11] then started reading this book
[34:12] and uh oh a sort of a strange
[34:16] feeling came over me and i sort of
[34:19] thought
[34:21] i've never experienced anything like
[34:22] this it's and
[34:24] i've read the first couple of pages and
[34:26] i could tell rosemary was a little bit
[34:27] emotional about it too so i said we'll
[34:30] put it aside but
[34:31] we'll read it some other time and um
[34:34] so anyway so we went to bed and um
[34:39] we were just just i say it again we knew
[34:41] nothing i knew
[34:42] nothing about any spiritual i'd never
[34:45] even heard the word praise
[34:59] is so unusual because i knew
[35:03] absolutely i was in a foreign country i
[35:05] never knew anything about it
[35:07] and anyway so we're just lying there and
[35:10] then this presence came
[35:12] and i started swelling up and swelling
[35:15] up and yeah
[35:16] i said what's going on what's going on
[35:20] ah and and and then a sound
[35:23] and didn't know what it was and i and i
[35:26] sat up
[35:27] rosemary said what's wrong i said i just
[35:29] feel like god's going to speak
[35:31] once again not having any idea or
[35:34] anything
[35:35] and um so anyway we talked about it for
[35:37] a few minutes
[35:38] and then we laid back down go to sleep
[35:42] and lying there and suddenly this
[35:45] um sort of like a wave coming in at the
[35:48] beach a ripple came over me
[35:50] and uh i wanted to weep and i thought
[35:53] don't be ridiculous
[35:55] listen i say again about being humble
[35:59] a fully grown man lying in bed beside
[36:02] his wife
[36:02] and he's going to start weeping you
[36:04] can't absolutely
[36:06] gratificate it can't happen it can't
[36:08] happen
[36:11] that went away and i laid there and
[36:13] about 10 minutes later
[36:14] oh she came back again i can't i can't
[36:18] and anyway so oh i started to get really
[36:21] worked up by then i didn't know what was
[36:23] going on
[36:24] and anyway so then about the well a few
[36:27] minutes later
[36:29] came again and
[36:32] i just had to let go and i wept and wept
[36:37] but all the time i didn't know what it
[36:39] was all about i didn't understand
[36:40] anything
[36:41] it was strange no voice or anything
[36:44] nobody told me anything
[36:46] and anyway i just lay there weeping i
[36:48] said dear
[36:49] i said get that lady on the phone
[36:51] happens 11 at night get that lady on the
[36:54] phone and tell her i want to be baptized
[36:55] now
[37:02] even though i didn't understand what was
[37:03] going on
[37:05] something had happened in me yeah and
[37:08] anyway
[37:08] um she rang i mean lisa this is
[37:12] actually what happened she rang raised
[37:14] my wife rang because old crank
[37:16] telephones in those days
[37:18] and she rang and i heard her and she
[37:20] said and vera the woman said
[37:22] what's wrong and rosemary says david
[37:26] and and vera said what's wrong she said
[37:28] he's crying
[37:30] and i honestly believe
[37:34] when i say this i'm sure i remember
[37:37] thinking
[37:38] get an ambulance because there's
[37:40] something wrong with me i can't
[37:42] understand what it is
[37:44] anyway but the thing about it was vera
[37:46] said praise the lord
[37:48] and i thought all the ridiculous things
[37:50] to say
[37:52] but anyway they were on shift at the
[37:55] time so they couldn't come
[37:57] so she said well the only thing i could
[37:59] suggest is ring ridge seal
[38:01] so red chill david wants to be baptized
[38:06] now
[38:08] and he's and he's weeping and uh
[38:12] as i say all this is so strange i
[38:14] couldn't understand what was going on
[38:17] but i i can't remember then what
[38:18] happened for the rest of the night but
[38:20] anyway we decided we'd get baptised
[38:22] following saturday
[38:25] but i know the next morning brother and
[38:27] sister i tell you as plain as a nose on
[38:28] my face
[38:30] i've been reading this bible for four
[38:32] years
[38:33] i had no idea what it was all about
[38:36] and i came down to breakfast next
[38:38] morning opened the bible
[38:40] wow i've never seen this before
[38:43] yeah and from 53 years ago
[38:47] they're still the same this is this is
[38:51] listen see it's it's the it's the spirit
[38:54] on the word yes sir yes sir today we get
[38:57] a lot of people saying oh i know the
[38:58] word i'm in the word i'm in the word
[39:00] no no it's the life in the word
[39:04] you know it's the holy ghost is the life
[39:07] of the church amen without the holy
[39:10] ghost it's all dead i don't care
[39:12] and i feel today when i look and see how
[39:15] things have changed
[39:16] um and over the years now it's just
[39:19] common for people to say you know oh
[39:20] you're in the message
[39:21] oh yeah i'm in the message i know oh you
[39:23] know this you know
[39:25] i tell you what i know one thing that's
[39:26] jesus christ and crucified
[39:29] and from that time 19 january
[39:32] 20th of 1967 my life changed
[39:36] forever and i just
[39:39] in a way i suppose so many people must
[39:41] have got embarrassed with me because
[39:42] every time i got up to speak there
[39:44] i'd be bawling my eyes out i love jesus
[39:47] he's just so wonderful
[39:49] because something had changed in me and
[39:52] so the following saturday i always
[39:54] remember again we went out to the river
[39:56] and there was about 20 of us both of us
[39:59] and
[39:59] my wife got baptized first in the name
[40:02] of the lord jesus christ
[40:04] and then brother i think his brother reg
[40:05] said um oh brother if you
[40:07] like to say anything so i got up there i
[40:10] opened my bible
[40:11] and it was a oh oh psalm 27
[40:14] the lord is the my light of my salvation
[40:17] and i bawl my eyes out
[40:19] just so real absolutely and
[40:23] in the morning after that experience on
[40:25] the saturday morning
[40:26] i had to go out and milk the cow and
[40:29] because we were on a farm there
[40:30] uh and i remember walking out with a
[40:32] bucket of walking out the paddock there
[40:35] and the presence of the lord was so real
[40:37] i was bawling away and i said lord
[40:40] just leave me alone i can't take anymore
[40:43] it was just so real
[40:45] and i had no idea then just what it
[40:48] meant but
[40:48] how what it is to know jesus that's
[40:52] you know brethren outside of that you've
[40:54] got nothing exactly right
[40:55] and i feel today i've heard so many i i
[40:58] don't know i've heard thousands of
[41:00] sermons i suppose in my time
[41:02] and i just feel sadly there are so many
[41:05] i've got it all
[41:06] figured out in here but i've never met
[41:09] him
[41:10] that's what it's all about you know and
[41:13] i just
[41:14] even in the last days and weeks i've
[41:16] been sitting at home
[41:17] and weeping just sitting there weeping
[41:19] at the reality of my savior
[41:22] what he did for me outside of knowing
[41:24] him brethren you've got nothing
[41:26] i don't care how super duper you are but
[41:29] to know him
[41:31] when you it's just it's something that's
[41:33] way beyond any understanding
[41:35] and i was just reading brother branham
[41:37] there the day before yesterday i
[41:39] recommended his greatest sermons ever
[41:41] christ the mystery of god revealed
[41:44] and it's something brethren that that i
[41:48] believe you can only understand it by
[41:50] the spirit
[41:52] and brother branham just said a quote
[41:54] there i've got it written down but i'll
[41:55] try and quote it
[41:57] he said god became from god
[42:02] to become me
[42:05] yeah when you think about that
[42:08] it's just mine it's more than
[42:11] mind-blowing
[42:12] to realize the god of creation became me
[42:17] he he took upon himself my sin
[42:20] everything about me and i believe one of
[42:22] the sad things today brethren
[42:24] as so many people think i'm a great
[42:27] person i'm a good person i'm this i'm
[42:29] that
[42:29] amazing i'll tell you what one glimpse
[42:31] of calvary brother
[42:33] and you realize hallelujah brother
[42:35] branham just another sermon there
[42:37] and becky had said to him about
[42:39] something how important we are
[42:42] he said give me a glass of water yeah
[42:44] glass of water
[42:45] becky or whoever just stick your finger
[42:48] in the water
[42:49] yeah now pull it out the hole that's
[42:51] left that's how important you are
[42:54] see we're nothing absolutely we're
[42:57] nothing and when you come to think that
[42:59] god creation came
[43:01] and laid down his life suffered suffered
[43:04] in a way that no human being could ever
[43:05] suffer
[43:06] why because of your sins because of my
[43:08] sins
[43:09] when i was born in this world i was born
[43:12] a sinner
[43:13] i did not commit sin every one of us
[43:16] and that's where i believe this this
[43:18] wonderful message that we believe
[43:20] if you only just i say to so many people
[43:23] read your bible
[43:24] and you'll see how that in the beginning
[43:27] god
[43:28] created everything perfect absolutely
[43:31] wonderful
[43:31] perfect creation and he placed his first
[43:34] son in that creation then he realized
[43:38] his first son was lonely
[43:40] he said it's not good that a man should
[43:42] be alone and so what did he do
[43:44] he took a rib out of the side of adam he
[43:48] caused the deep sleep to come upon him
[43:50] and he took a
[43:51] rib out and he made a woman and i just
[43:55] quite often think brethren
[43:56] just imagine how it was for adam who'd
[43:59] been living for it and how long he'd
[44:01] been living
[44:02] on his own and one day he's presented
[44:05] with a wife
[44:10] it's the typing of what's coming one day
[44:12] soon
[44:14] but anyway then adam and eve happy
[44:17] together
[44:18] but then what happened this is the whole
[44:20] key of
[44:21] to me is the whole key of the bible the
[44:24] blood cell
[44:26] god's perfect blood cell in adam and eve
[44:30] was broken and from then on
[44:33] every single human being is a hybrid
[44:37] and if you know anything about hybrid
[44:39] you'll know a hybrid
[44:40] can never reproduce itself i don't care
[44:44] you get a tin of white paint you put
[44:46] some black paint in
[44:48] you can never have perfect white i don't
[44:50] care how far you go
[44:52] it's hybrid it's polluted and that's
[44:55] every one of us
[44:56] we're born into this world as hybrid
[44:59] human beings
[45:00] so we in ourselves can never reproduce
[45:03] jesus
[45:04] christ because we're hybrid that's right
[45:06] see
[45:07] that's why somebody had to come outside
[45:09] of this world
[45:10] come into this world as a perfect human
[45:13] being
[45:14] and pay the price of my sins that the
[45:16] hybrid in me
[45:18] that i might be redeemed from this
[45:20] rotten state that i'm in
[45:22] that i can't change i can't be any
[45:24] better uh
[45:25] somebody had to come and pay the price
[45:28] because
[45:28] god made a law and a law is not a law
[45:32] if there's no penalty and somebody had
[45:36] to pay the price and that's why jesus
[45:38] came
[45:38] he came from the outside i just sort of
[45:40] think how wonderful
[45:42] i'm sorry i'm going on on my time but i
[45:44] just think it's just so wonderful do you
[45:46] realize the god of creation
[45:49] formed himself a pinhead
[45:52] in in the womb of mary a pinhead
[45:57] the god of creation
[46:01] it's hard to understand it but the very
[46:04] spoken word of god came into mary
[46:09] and then i just think one of the things
[46:10] that really just tears me up too also
[46:13] when joseph and mary were about to be
[46:15] delivered and they went to bethlehem
[46:17] the house of god's bread they went to
[46:19] bethlehem
[46:20] and they went to the inn and joseph
[46:22] would have knocked on the door and the
[46:24] guy would have said yes what's the
[46:25] problem
[46:26] we need a room my wife's ready bit to be
[46:28] delivered
[46:30] and uh and and the um the man will have
[46:33] said
[46:33] sorry mate no room but my wife's going
[46:36] to have a baby
[46:38] no room i'll tell you what there's a
[46:40] stinking little stable out the back
[46:42] there
[46:44] oh jesus hallelujah
[46:49] that's what it's all about the greatest
[46:50] man that ever lived
[46:52] came into a stable to be born
[46:59] i'm sorry i've overtaken my time but
[47:01] there's so much more i could tell you
[47:02] but
[47:03] i think we'll just leave the thanks i
[47:06] didn't come here to run the service i
[47:07] just came to share
[47:09] a testimony that i believe you know
[47:12] brethren i'm just an old guy now getting
[47:14] on 83 years old but
[47:16] i love the lord jesus amen amen and i
[47:19] know he's life
[47:20] he is the only life and he dwells in
[47:23] here
[47:24] and i'll tell you what if you know that
[47:26] i don't care what happens in your life
[47:28] you already have the token the down
[47:31] payment
[47:31] of eternal life amen i just pray that
[47:34] the lord bless you this morning i'll
[47:36] just close with the word of prayer
[47:40] dear lord this morning as i just stand

[47:45] my time but
[47:46] i just pray lord for every one of us

[1:00:09] i'm sorry i don't have a a slideshow
[1:00:13] um
[1:00:18] amen says here
[1:00:22] and behold two of them went that same
[1:00:24] day to a village called emmaus
[1:00:26] which was from jerusalem about three
[1:00:28] score furlongs
[1:00:30] and they talked together of all these
[1:00:32] things which had happened
[1:00:33] and it came to pass that while they
[1:00:35] commune together and
[1:00:37] reasoned they tried to work out what's
[1:00:39] going on jesus himself drew near and
[1:00:41] went with them
[1:00:42] but their eyes were holding that they
[1:00:44] should not know him and he said unto
[1:00:46] them what manner of communications are
[1:00:48] these that ye
[1:00:49] have one to another as you walk in a sad
[1:00:54] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[1:00:57] answered and said unto him are thou only
[1:01:00] a stranger in jerusalem
[1:01:01] and has not known the things which have
[1:01:03] come to pass in these days
[1:01:06] and he said unto them what things and
[1:01:08] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[1:01:10] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[1:01:12] indeed and word before god and all the
[1:01:14] people
[1:01:15] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[1:01:17] delivered him to be condemned to death
[1:01:18] and have crucified him
[1:01:20] but we trusted that it had been he which
[1:01:23] should have redeemed israel
[1:01:25] and besides all this today is the third
[1:01:28] day since these things were done
[1:01:30] yay and certain women also of our
[1:01:32] company made us astonished
[1:01:33] which were early at the sepulcher and
[1:01:36] when they found not his body they came
[1:01:38] saying that they had
[1:01:39] also seen a vision of angels which said
[1:01:42] he was alive
[1:01:44] and certain of them which were with us
[1:01:46] went to the sepulcher
[1:01:47] and found it even so as the woman had
[1:01:50] said
[1:01:51] but he but him they saw not
[1:01:54] then he said unto them o false and slow
[1:01:56] of heart to believe all that the
[1:01:58] prophets have spoken
[1:01:59] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:02:02] things and to enter into his glory
[1:02:04] and beginning at moses and all the
[1:02:07] prophets expounded unto them all the
[1:02:09] scriptures the things
[1:02:10] concerning himself
[1:02:14] amen what a what a portion of scripture
[1:02:17] you can walk with the lord and not
[1:02:19] realize who's talking to you
[1:02:21] but we know that's not the end of the
[1:02:22] story that's right amen but let's let's
[1:02:25] bow heads in a word of prayer this
[1:02:26] morning
[1:02:28] lord jesus lord we believe
[1:02:31] lord you are present lord you are here
[1:02:34] lord you said in your word you promised
[1:02:36] where two or three are gathered in my
[1:02:38] name there i am
[1:02:39] there i am in the midst and lord we know
[1:02:41] you always come where you're invited so
[1:02:43] lord we invite you
[1:02:45] lord jesus to this building and not just
[1:02:47] to this building but to where we are at
[1:02:49] lord and
[1:02:50] lord to our very hearts oh god may you
[1:02:52] come be welcome
[1:02:53] lord may you come speak the words of
[1:02:55] life lord jesus may you just be exalted

[1:03:12] strength and our bodies lord give us a
[1:03:13] tent of ears oh god may there be
[1:03:16] no distractions be able to distract us
[1:03:18] today amen lord may he bless the service
[1:03:20] bless from the oldest to the youngest
[1:03:21] among us oh god
[1:03:23] dear god anyone who may be watching this
[1:03:24] now may just go
[1:03:26] to to where they are lord you're the
[1:03:28] same god lord jesus you're a personal
[1:03:30] god and i just pray you
[1:03:32] come come by our way today for your
[1:03:34] glory in jesus christ's name
[1:03:36] amen amen god bless you friends
[1:03:39] you can have your seats this morning so
[1:03:41] as i um
[1:03:43] mentally briefly uh briefly mentioned
[1:03:46] last sunday about you know i want to
[1:03:48] speak about seeing jesus and his program
[1:03:50] now
[1:03:51] we know that god's program brother
[1:03:52] abraham says is to take the world empty
[1:03:54] of the world
[1:03:55] fill you with him and then check the
[1:03:56] world with you amen but we know on a so
[1:03:59] we're going to go the
[1:04:00] 10 000 foot view that we're going to
[1:04:01] come down to cleopas and his friend on
[1:04:03] the way to emmaus because
[1:04:05] we know that that that same jesus that
[1:04:07] spoke to them and walked with them is
[1:04:08] walking with
[1:04:09] his children today amen that you know
[1:04:12] the lord is not just
[1:04:13] in heaven someplace he's not just in
[1:04:14] history but he's the same in 2020 as he
[1:04:16] was back then he's just as real
[1:04:18] he's just as alive it means i'd like to
[1:04:20] speak on seeing jesus and his program
[1:04:23] now brother brown would pray in uh in
[1:04:25] the contest at the
[1:04:26] end of 1962 he says oh god that may we
[1:04:29] be one step higher up the ladder until
[1:04:31] we see jesus and his program
[1:04:33] because if we can see jesus and his
[1:04:35] program we know where we are in time
[1:04:37] amen we know what has to take place we
[1:04:39] know where we are in his program
[1:04:41] because many people are wondering what's
[1:04:42] going on in the world you know what's
[1:04:44] happening in the world and
[1:04:45] we know it's all in here right you know
[1:04:48] we are still living in bible days
[1:04:50] amen the god of the bible's alive
[1:04:52] hallelujah so you know we want to just
[1:04:54] just go into these things now
[1:04:56] and and so if we can see him and his
[1:04:58] program
[1:04:59] we can have confidence to walk with him
[1:05:01] because we know where he is we know
[1:05:03] where we are we know where we're going
[1:05:05] now we know history repeats itself you
[1:05:07] know
[1:05:08] um you know we know the profit would
[1:05:10] parallel
[1:05:11] israel and and and how they are formed
[1:05:14] and and how they had like a golden age
[1:05:16] and they went down into
[1:05:17] idolatry and he paralleled that with
[1:05:19] even the history of america
[1:05:21] how they came in there they pushed the
[1:05:23] natives out they found it under freedom
[1:05:25] of religion they had great presidents
[1:05:26] like washington and lincoln
[1:05:28] but they came down to such a low end to
[1:05:30] what we have today
[1:05:31] and um but both of those countries and i
[1:05:34] say not even those countries but the
[1:05:35] world
[1:05:36] and you have the opportunity that they
[1:05:38] had israel had the messiah walk in their
[1:05:40] midst
[1:05:41] they had the living lord jesus the very
[1:05:43] lord of glory the god of christ and put
[1:05:45] on flesh and walk in their midst
[1:05:47] and they had an opportunity not just as
[1:05:49] a nation but as individuals to accept
[1:05:51] him
[1:05:51] right but we know that it was prophesied
[1:05:53] that sadly they would reject him
[1:05:56] i mean and they would turn him down and
[1:05:58] and america and i'll say the world and
[1:06:00] ourselves today
[1:06:01] had the same opportunity to receive the
[1:06:03] gospel brother braham said in 1957 that
[1:06:06] that america turned down the gospel of
[1:06:08] jesus christ
[1:06:09] and um you know so the thing is if you
[1:06:12] receive him
[1:06:13] then you'll have a paradise there'll be
[1:06:15] trouble on every hand but in your soul
[1:06:17] you know where you're going
[1:06:18] right you'll have a you'll have a real
[1:06:20] peace but but to reject him you go into
[1:06:22] chaos
[1:06:22] and unfortunately we are living in an
[1:06:24] era where we just see chaos
[1:06:26] and the world is falling apart because
[1:06:28] they rejected the lord jesus christ
[1:06:31] and unfortunately you reap what you sow
[1:06:33] and this world is now reaping what it so
[1:06:35] many years ago
[1:06:36] but there's a people upon the earth now
[1:06:38] this is not all doom and gloom right
[1:06:39] because there's an exit out of this
[1:06:41] place called the rapture
[1:06:42] amen and god will take those who know
[1:06:44] him with him
[1:06:45] in that rapture right so this is not all
[1:06:48] doom and gloom
[1:06:48] right hallelujah this is actually the
[1:06:51] greatest time to be alive
[1:06:52] think of it we don't have to die to to
[1:06:54] to go to glory we can be alive
[1:06:57] i mean to be transformed i mean in a
[1:06:59] moment a twinkling of an eye
[1:07:01] so sadly israel rejected him
[1:07:05] as the church world would reject him in
[1:07:07] this day and we know that is prophesied
[1:07:09] because in revelations 3 when it speaks
[1:07:11] of our age rich increase with goods have
[1:07:13] need of nothing
[1:07:14] he says behold i stand at the door and
[1:07:15] knock so he's on the outside of his
[1:07:17] church
[1:07:17] knocking trying to get in so he's been
[1:07:20] fully rejected he's on the outside
[1:07:23] and unfortunately this is what's
[1:07:26] happening so
[1:07:27] if we look at history now forgive me if
[1:07:28] i'm i feel like
[1:07:30] you know if you need me to slow down
[1:07:33] just just
[1:07:33] say hold on or something i don't know
[1:07:35] give me some kind of signal i don't want
[1:07:36] this to go over your head because you
[1:07:38] if you look at history you take from
[1:07:40] when john the baptist was here
[1:07:41] to the destruction of jerusalem we're
[1:07:43] living in that span that history is
[1:07:45] repeating itself
[1:07:46] we had a forerunner come he introduced
[1:07:48] us to jesus christ
[1:07:49] amen and the bride has a real pentecost
[1:07:52] who's had a pentecost
[1:07:53] that same pillar of fire comes and
[1:07:54] dwells in you changes your life
[1:07:56] transforms you you see him living
[1:07:58] hallelujah where the word is not just
[1:08:00] ink on paper but it's in flesh in your
[1:08:02] life
[1:08:03] hallelujah so so a forerunner introduced
[1:08:05] jesus christ john the baptist
[1:08:07] introduced jesus christ those who really
[1:08:10] you know heard his message went to
[1:08:11] pentecost received the baptism of the
[1:08:13] holy ghost
[1:08:14] and then the book of acts was written
[1:08:15] and we know the book of acts is not the
[1:08:17] acts of the apostles as the acts of the
[1:08:19] holy ghost in the apostles
[1:08:21] and the same thing has happened today
[1:08:23] we've had a forerunner come introduce us
[1:08:24] to jesus christ the living word
[1:08:26] right we have received a true pentecost
[1:08:29] and i'll say if you haven't received a
[1:08:30] pentecost it's here to be received
[1:08:32] well that same god that you read about
[1:08:34] in the book of acts you should be able
[1:08:35] to read the book of acts and see him do
[1:08:37] the same things in your life
[1:08:40] amen if he did it in the beginning he'll
[1:08:41] do it at the end the same guy that lived
[1:08:43] back there is the same god that lives
[1:08:44] today
[1:08:45] he hasn't changed one bit amen he's
[1:08:48] still the same god
[1:08:49] but in that span the church was you know
[1:08:53] so so the book of acts was being written
[1:08:56] but then it came to a place where where
[1:08:58] jerusalem was destroyed now
[1:09:00] when we think about the destruction of
[1:09:02] jerusalem it didn't just one day is all
[1:09:04] peace the next day titus turns up with
[1:09:06] his army and just destroys the thing
[1:09:08] there's a whole if you look at history
[1:09:10] there's lots of insurrections rebellions
[1:09:12] riots uprisings and finally it
[1:09:14] culminated
[1:09:15] in the destruction of jerusalem and you
[1:09:18] see what why is that happening
[1:09:20] because the world was falling apart
[1:09:21] because they rejected the one that could
[1:09:23] keep the world together which is the
[1:09:24] lord
[1:09:25] and you see today the same thing this
[1:09:27] world is falling apart
[1:09:29] why because they've rejected the messiah
[1:09:31] and now there's fighting and
[1:09:33] and strife and things going on because
[1:09:36] the problem is
[1:09:37] history must repeat itself and it's not
[1:09:39] just a city now it's not just a nation
[1:09:41] it's a world
[1:09:43] but there is a way of escaping this day
[1:09:45] hallelujah
[1:09:47] amen now the thing is though the problem
[1:09:49] uh with with with people is
[1:09:51] is time can be such a curse
[1:09:55] because the longer time goes on the
[1:09:56] longer it seems that a promise seems to
[1:09:58] linger
[1:09:59] then people lose their focus on really
[1:10:01] what the goal is
[1:10:02] and even even uh you know peter would
[1:10:05] say in second peter 3
[1:10:06] says this second epistle beloved i write
[1:10:09] unto you and both which i stir up your
[1:10:11] pure minds by the way of remembrance
[1:10:13] that ye may be mindful of the words
[1:10:15] which are spoken before by the holy
[1:10:17] prophets and of the commandments of us
[1:10:19] the apostles of the lord and savior
[1:10:21] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:10:22] in the last day scoffers walking after
[1:10:24] their own lusts
[1:10:25] and we see that right and saying where
[1:10:28] is the promise of his coming
[1:10:30] remember because it's been more than
[1:10:31] yeah actually for two thousand years the
[1:10:33] church will be saying he's coming
[1:10:34] he's coming he's coming and people are
[1:10:36] saying it's been two thousand years two
[1:10:38] thousand years two thousand years even
[1:10:40] in this day
[1:10:41] in the 50s he's coming he's coming we're
[1:10:43] in 2020 people say where's the promise
[1:10:45] of his coming
[1:10:47] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:10:49] things continue as they were from the
[1:10:50] beginning of the creation
[1:10:51] this is what they say and this is what
[1:10:53] people think well the prophet's been
[1:10:54] dead sixty years or fifty years whatever
[1:10:56] the other fathers have gone asleep that
[1:10:57] first
[1:10:58] generation that really met the lord
[1:11:00] there and you know so where's the
[1:11:01] promise of his coming
[1:11:03] they say things have been continuing on
[1:11:05] but he says for this they are willingly
[1:11:07] ignorant of that by the word of god the
[1:11:10] heavens were of old and the earth
[1:11:12] standing out of the water in the water
[1:11:13] whereby the world that then was being
[1:11:16] overflowed with water perished
[1:11:18] but the heavens and the earth which are
[1:11:20] now by the same word are kept in store
[1:11:23] reserved under fire against the day of
[1:11:25] judgment and production of ungodly men
[1:11:27] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:11:29] thing that one day is what the lord is
[1:11:31] as a thousand years and a thousand years
[1:11:33] is one day so in god's timing
[1:11:36] our lord jesus was was crucified and
[1:11:38] rose again just a couple of days
[1:11:40] ago that's pretty fresh in his mind
[1:11:44] hallelujah amen the lord is not slack
[1:11:47] concerning his promise
[1:11:49] as some men would count slackness what
[1:11:50] slackness are they not he's not getting
[1:11:52] around to it
[1:11:53] but he's not slack concerning his
[1:11:55] promise as some men can't slackness but
[1:11:57] is long suffering to us
[1:11:59] would and when i read those i'm so
[1:12:00] thankful you're long suffering towards
[1:12:02] me
[1:12:03] how they're not willing that any should
[1:12:04] perish but that all should come to
[1:12:06] repentance
[1:12:07] so god is not slack as men would think
[1:12:09] of slack he is on time
[1:12:11] right he's on time he's on his schedule
[1:12:13] i mean it will not be too late or too
[1:12:15] early it'll be right on time
[1:12:18] amen but the problem is with the delays
[1:12:20] people lose focus
[1:12:22] we never want to lose our focus we we
[1:12:24] never want to lose our enthusiasm
[1:12:26] i mean the fire and the passion of
[1:12:28] serving the lord when we first met him
[1:12:30] hallelujah that that that fire and that
[1:12:32] passion should be burning it should be
[1:12:33] burning greater
[1:12:35] our enthusiasm amen we're a lot more
[1:12:37] down the road now than when we first
[1:12:38] believe
[1:12:39] hallelujah we're we are that day closer
[1:12:41] we're a sunday closer to the coming of
[1:12:43] the lord
[1:12:43] hallelujah we are one church service
[1:12:45] closer to the coming of the lord
[1:12:47] hallelujah you know it could be this
[1:12:48] moment i pray it is but if it's not i'm
[1:12:50] going to be looking for him tomorrow
[1:12:52] hallelujah that one that saved and
[1:12:54] called you is the one that's going to
[1:12:55] wrap you isn't that glorious
[1:12:57] hallelujah we're going to get to the
[1:12:59] tour on the way to emmaus
[1:13:01] at some stage because it's that it is
[1:13:03] that personal
[1:13:04] it is that personal it's not some
[1:13:06] abstract idea
[1:13:08] christianity is not an idea it's not a
[1:13:09] bunch of doctrine this message is not a
[1:13:11] bunch of doctrine it's jesus christ
[1:13:12] revealed
[1:13:14] it means it's not something god didn't
[1:13:15] send it to fuss and fight over
[1:13:17] god sent it that his holy ghost will
[1:13:18] come and live it through your life
[1:13:21] amen brother abraham had the um when
[1:13:23] he's when he's um speaking in is this
[1:13:25] the time of the answer in 1962
[1:13:27] he he says look upon this the light had
[1:13:30] never come upon us where where junior
[1:13:32] jackson had the dream of
[1:13:33] brother bram taking the crowbar and
[1:13:35] taking the top off the pyramid
[1:13:37] and and the white rockers there and when
[1:13:39] all of them got up and i told them to
[1:13:41] watch that and all them came to
[1:13:42] came up to look in but he said while
[1:13:45] they were looking in he looked out the
[1:13:46] corner of his eye and believed it was
[1:13:48] and watched me
[1:13:49] and i slipped off to one side so junior
[1:13:51] jackson's in the stream and he watched
[1:13:52] his brother
[1:13:53] slip off to one side and started going
[1:13:55] towards the west towards the setting of
[1:13:57] the sun
[1:13:58] coming up a hill going down a hill going
[1:14:00] up a hill going down the hill getting
[1:14:01] small and small all the way out of sight
[1:14:04] and he said then when when i did that he
[1:14:07] said then the brethren turned around
[1:14:08] after all said where did he ban did he
[1:14:10] vanish where did he go
[1:14:12] and said some took out that way some
[1:14:14] took out that way and some another
[1:14:16] but a very few stayed and looked on what
[1:14:18] i had told them
[1:14:20] so he wandered off and everyone's
[1:14:22] looking where's he gone where's the
[1:14:24] prophet god what's going on
[1:14:25] and he and remember he was instructed
[1:14:28] instructed look on this
[1:14:29] look on this but then time went by
[1:14:33] and then so they wandered off doing all
[1:14:34] kinds of other things he says very few
[1:14:36] stayed and did what he told them to do
[1:14:39] why because the time went on people look
[1:14:42] at start looking at other things
[1:14:44] we have something to look on hallelujah
[1:14:47] this word
[1:14:48] amen we should look on this
[1:14:51] it will tell us where we are where we're
[1:14:53] going what's going on
[1:14:58] you know that scripture in luke 24
[1:15:00] brother brown will preach a sermon
[1:15:02] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[1:15:04] he's saying that luke 24 is a prophecy
[1:15:06] of today
[1:15:07] everything makes sense because of that
[1:15:08] prophecy today
[1:15:10] amen now he says and look in 1963 sorry
[1:15:14] for all the reading but here we are now
[1:15:15] today we see faith is designed to do
[1:15:17] this same faith today sees the same
[1:15:19] thing
[1:15:19] a faith of the church today should see
[1:15:21] the program of god
[1:15:22] i want you to don't miss that now the
[1:15:24] church today is called that's called of
[1:15:26] god
[1:15:26] will certainly see the program of god
[1:15:28] because the program of god is written
[1:15:30] out here
[1:15:31] the blueprint and the holy spirit by
[1:15:34] faith is the one who reads it and
[1:15:36] sets it together so this is god's
[1:15:39] program is written in here
[1:15:40] i'm sure we can agree with that for our
[1:15:42] daily life how church should be how we
[1:15:45] treat one another treat anyone on the
[1:15:46] street
[1:15:47] treat our children treat our parents
[1:15:49] everything everything is all
[1:15:50] that's god's program is written in here
[1:15:52] but the thing is the devil
[1:15:55] will try and twist us from the program
[1:15:57] of god
[1:15:58] and as and and the reason i read that
[1:16:00] quote from is this time the end is
[1:16:02] because obviously they're thinking god
[1:16:03] involved
[1:16:04] and actually there the program was look
[1:16:07] on this look on the word
[1:16:08] but they're thinking change i'm going to
[1:16:10] go do something else they wandered off
[1:16:13] so we don't ever want to let the devil
[1:16:15] twist our thinking off of god's program
[1:16:18] because he'll always twist it onto
[1:16:19] something else
[1:16:21] he says and god keeps his word that's
[1:16:23] the reason the church is coming in with
[1:16:25] the worship of mary and of other women
[1:16:27] and things
[1:16:27] it's that same spirit under a religious
[1:16:30] head and that's the reason
[1:16:32] they have to get their mind off the
[1:16:34] unadulterated word of god to produce
[1:16:36] that program
[1:16:37] so there's a lot of programs going on in
[1:16:39] the world heaps of programs we want to
[1:16:40] have god's program
[1:16:42] amen and and the thing is when the devil
[1:16:45] will swap he'll always try and twist our
[1:16:47] minds off the word of god
[1:16:49] to another program and he always wants
[1:16:51] to swap the supernatural for the natural
[1:16:54] right so what do you do in the church
[1:16:56] history swap the power of god the holy
[1:16:58] ghost and the people and swap it just
[1:17:00] for a natural form of religion
[1:17:02] amen so we never we never ever want to
[1:17:05] just accept
[1:17:06] what the devil would try and give us so
[1:17:08] um you know he always try and swap a
[1:17:10] natural church for a spiritual church
[1:17:12] what was the church in the beginning the
[1:17:13] holy ghost was on everyone
[1:17:15] he was in everyone he wasn't just in the
[1:17:17] minister of the song leaders he was in
[1:17:18] the laity
[1:17:19] right and everyone was participating in
[1:17:22] spiritual worship
[1:17:23] hallelujah it wasn't just an anointed
[1:17:25] minister or whatever but it was everyone
[1:17:27] was anointed everyone was part of the
[1:17:29] body
[1:17:30] right but then he he swapped that for
[1:17:32] creeds and
[1:17:33] dogmas of men saying oh only the
[1:17:34] priesthood is holy now
[1:17:36] and so he took the anointing off the
[1:17:38] people and put it on the priesthood
[1:17:39] that's what the devil did
[1:17:40] and he just made that into a cold form
[1:17:43] so he'll always swap the natural for the
[1:17:45] spiritual
[1:17:45] but we want the spiritual i mean we want
[1:17:48] the genuine if there's a genuine to be
[1:17:49] had i want that genuine
[1:17:51] harley and i believe this morning we
[1:17:53] have a genuine amen but we should
[1:17:55] cultivate it
[1:17:56] nurture it rejoice in it be happy about
[1:17:59] it right
[1:17:59] treasure amen don't take it for granted
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:04] now israel in the time of jesus was
[1:18:07] longing for a messiah this will all come
[1:18:10] together eventually i i i i really trust
[1:18:12] israel in the time of jesus was longing
[1:18:14] for their messiah
[1:18:16] but they had it all worked down their
[1:18:17] minds how he would come
[1:18:19] some thought that the you know the
[1:18:20] forerunner would come down on a you know
[1:18:22] come down to heaven on some golden
[1:18:24] you know you know staircase and say now
[1:18:26] here he comes and now here comes the
[1:18:28] messiah would go to the high priest and
[1:18:29] you know they had it all worked out
[1:18:31] you know and they wanted a great king
[1:18:33] like david that would
[1:18:34] that would push the romans out of the
[1:18:36] country now you've got to think of the
[1:18:37] mindset of the jewish people at that
[1:18:39] time because they were oppressed by the
[1:18:41] romans they wanted to right the wrongs
[1:18:42] of the past they wanted their own nation
[1:18:45] so they thought their messiah would come
[1:18:46] with a great big sword and just drive
[1:18:48] the romans out
[1:18:50] but god doesn't give us what we want he
[1:18:52] gives us what we need
[1:18:53] and they needed a baby in a manger they
[1:18:55] needed a sacrificial lamb
[1:18:57] right they didn't need a great warrior
[1:18:59] like that they needed a sacrificial lamb
[1:19:01] to wash them from their sins
[1:19:03] hallelujah so so that's what they were
[1:19:05] expecting
[1:19:06] now the kingdom of god
[1:19:10] when when when john the baptist started
[1:19:12] preaching when jesus
[1:19:13] preaches the kingdom of god is nigh so
[1:19:15] it's coming
[1:19:16] and even the scribes and pharisees they
[1:19:18] would ask him in luke 17
[1:19:20] he says and when he was demanded of the
[1:19:22] pharisees when the kingdom of god should
[1:19:24] come
[1:19:24] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[1:19:26] god cometh not with a
[1:19:28] cometh not with observation so you're
[1:19:30] not going to see it with your natural
[1:19:31] eye you know you know it's not by
[1:19:33] weights and sizes and people and you
[1:19:35] know it's not by
[1:19:36] observation you can't observe this you
[1:19:38] can't study it with your mind and work
[1:19:40] it out
[1:19:40] he says neither shall they say low or
[1:19:43] low therefore behold the kingdom of god
[1:19:45] is within you so
[1:19:46] the lord was trying to get them to see
[1:19:48] that this is this is not a natural
[1:19:50] kingdom
[1:19:51] this great kingdom of god it's not about
[1:19:53] it you know it's not about palaces on
[1:19:55] the earth and great
[1:19:56] castles and men and you know what they
[1:19:58] were thinking great kings with great big
[1:20:00] crowns and
[1:20:01] all that kind of stuff no the kingdom of
[1:20:03] god was greater than that
[1:20:04] it was the holy ghost within the people
[1:20:06] amen that's what he's trying to say you
[1:20:07] won't observe it with your eye your mind
[1:20:09] what you know remember
[1:20:11] no the kingdom of god is within you amen
[1:20:14] and even even the um even jesus when he
[1:20:16] was standing before pilate he would say
[1:20:19] my kingdom is not of this world if my
[1:20:21] kingdom
[1:20:22] of this world then my servants would
[1:20:24] fight that i should not be delivered to
[1:20:26] the jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:20:29] hence
[1:20:29] so he was telling because remember
[1:20:31] pilate was told this man's
[1:20:32] claiming to be the king of the jews they
[1:20:34] haven't said he's the king of the jews
[1:20:36] and they gave him over
[1:20:37] you know to pile the crucified but but
[1:20:39] jesus said my kingdom's not of this
[1:20:40] world
[1:20:41] these people have it all wrong these
[1:20:42] scribes and pharisees have it all wrong
[1:20:44] that my kingdom is the kingdom of heaven
[1:20:47] it's not a natural kingdom that i'm
[1:20:48] establishing
[1:20:49] but i'm going to establish my word in
[1:20:51] the hearts and
[1:20:52] your hearts of men and women hallelujah
[1:20:56] and then and then pilate would sign to
[1:20:58] him art thou king then jesus says thou
[1:21:00] says i'm a king and to this end was i
[1:21:02] born for this cause came i enter the
[1:21:05] world that i should bear witness unto
[1:21:06] the truth
[1:21:07] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:21:09] voice
[1:21:11] i'm so glad hallelujah you hear his
[1:21:13] voice
[1:21:14] i mean you know you're of the truth i
[1:21:15] mean so so jesus was trying to tell them
[1:21:18] my kingdom's not a natural kingdom
[1:21:20] but remember the jews had a big idea
[1:21:22] we're going to reestablish the kingdom
[1:21:23] we're going to buy a great political
[1:21:25] move we're going to drive the romans out
[1:21:26] we're going gonna we're gonna
[1:21:27] reestablish the kingdom of david
[1:21:28] remember
[1:21:29] he was the son of david so they were
[1:21:32] expecting him to act like david act
[1:21:34] acted but he was a far greater soldier
[1:21:36] than david was
[1:21:37] because he went down into hell and took
[1:21:39] the keys of heldeth and the grave of
[1:21:40] satan
[1:21:41] amen he actually released the prisoners
[1:21:43] from the prison house
[1:21:44] i mean he actually had a bleach had a
[1:21:47] weapon in him
[1:21:48] that could wash away sin change the
[1:21:50] nature of man that that fallen nature we
[1:21:52] were born with he could undo that
[1:21:54] he could transform in a moment and tweak
[1:21:55] with an eye i mean a soul
[1:21:57] hallelujah why do you say all that it's
[1:22:00] because we don't have to put up with sin
[1:22:02] we don't have to put up with human
[1:22:04] problems this is not there's not seven
[1:22:05] steps to becoming a christian
[1:22:07] i mean you know this is god's
[1:22:08] transforming power that's what we need
[1:22:11] and that's what is available
[1:22:12] amen this morning yes sir hallelujah
[1:22:17] the scribes and pharisees were worried
[1:22:21] they would say in john 11 if we let him
[1:22:24] thus alone
[1:22:26] all men will believe on him and the
[1:22:27] romans shall come and take away both our
[1:22:29] place and nation
[1:22:30] they were worried about their
[1:22:32] establishment upon the earth and how
[1:22:33] they stood and you know
[1:22:35] they were worried about those kind of
[1:22:36] things
[1:22:38] and and one of them named um caiaphas
[1:22:41] being the high priest that same year
[1:22:42] said unto them
[1:22:43] ye know nothing at all nor consider that
[1:22:46] it is expedient for us that one man
[1:22:48] should die for the people
[1:22:49] and for the that the whole nation
[1:22:51] perished not says prophesying this man
[1:22:53] has to die for us
[1:22:55] but that was their that was their
[1:22:57] mentality was we've got to
[1:22:58] keep our position in the country
[1:23:01] amen this is all they worried about they
[1:23:04] won't worry about the word being
[1:23:05] fulfilled
[1:23:06] they are more concerned about their
[1:23:07] standing in the community what other
[1:23:09] people thought of them what the romans
[1:23:10] thought of them
[1:23:11] you know i'm hyper so i've got to be a
[1:23:13] certain way and they weren't interested
[1:23:15] in actually what the word said they are
[1:23:17] more worried about their earthly
[1:23:18] position on earth
[1:23:20] than anything else
[1:23:23] and and even it came to a point in john
[1:23:26] chapter 6 that
[1:23:27] when those men when they had seen the
[1:23:28] miracle that jesus did
[1:23:31] said this is not of a truth that a
[1:23:33] prophet should come into the world when
[1:23:35] jesus therefore perceived that they
[1:23:36] would come
[1:23:37] and take him by force to make him a king
[1:23:40] he departed again into a mountain
[1:23:41] himself alone
[1:23:42] so they were they were looking for a
[1:23:44] messiah and they said we're going to
[1:23:45] make him king
[1:23:46] he perceive this is what their motive is
[1:23:47] going to be so he withdrew from them
[1:23:50] because he knew this is what this wasn't
[1:23:52] the kingship he was
[1:23:53] he was set forth to have but this is
[1:23:56] what they were looking for
[1:23:58] even the disciples that walked with him
[1:24:00] for three and a half years
[1:24:02] even after the resurrection they would
[1:24:05] ask him in acts chapter one
[1:24:07] lord will thou at this time restore
[1:24:09] again the kingdom of israel so even they
[1:24:11] were under an expectation
[1:24:13] though they though they walked with him
[1:24:15] they heard his teachings they saw the
[1:24:16] miracles
[1:24:17] he even said that you know my kingdom is
[1:24:19] not of this world but they're under
[1:24:21] expectation because this is how they
[1:24:23] were built are you going to restore the
[1:24:25] kingdom now
[1:24:25] are you basically going to drive the
[1:24:27] romans out and establish the throne of
[1:24:29] david again
[1:24:30] you know but this was it's interesting
[1:24:31] it you know this was before pentecost
[1:24:34] this was before pentecost it was the
[1:24:36] same thing you never read after
[1:24:38] pentecost that they strove among
[1:24:39] themselves who'd be the greatest that's
[1:24:41] right they
[1:24:41] only did that as carnal believers before
[1:24:45] they met the lord at pentecost they
[1:24:47] strove i'm the greatest no this is the
[1:24:49] greatest i'm the best one
[1:24:50] that's carnal unconverted men yet they
[1:24:53] are anointed to cast out devils yet they
[1:24:55] were anointed to do miracles but they
[1:24:56] were not fully converted
[1:24:58] even jesus would say to peter when thou
[1:25:00] art converted strength in the brethren
[1:25:02] though they did all these things they
[1:25:04] were under the same expectation are you
[1:25:05] going to restore the kingdom now
[1:25:08] and he said unto them it is not fair to
[1:25:10] know the times or the seasons which the
[1:25:12] father has put in his own power
[1:25:15] and now so so but now he's going to tell
[1:25:16] them what's going to happen but ye shall
[1:25:18] receive power
[1:25:19] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[1:25:21] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[1:25:24] both in jerusalem and in all judea
[1:25:26] and in samaria unto the uttermost part
[1:25:28] of the earth
[1:25:30] so they are under this expectation but i
[1:25:32] want to ask you a question
[1:25:34] do you ever read in the epistles
[1:25:36] anywhere about restoring a natural
[1:25:38] kingdom
[1:25:39] the church now is it has it ever been
[1:25:42] the church's mission
[1:25:43] to actually fight a natural battle going
[1:25:46] on
[1:25:47] some injustice some nation building has
[1:25:50] it ever been the church's real mission
[1:25:53] you don't read about it go through
[1:25:54] hebrews it's not there romans not there
[1:25:57] amen all the way down timothy titus
[1:25:59] river may be it's not there
[1:26:01] because the program of god was never
[1:26:04] based upon natural kingdom building
[1:26:06] but unconverted men will try and build
[1:26:08] kingdoms
[1:26:10] right church kingdoms personality cults
[1:26:12] wherever it may be
[1:26:13] man always tries to build that but god
[1:26:15] was never interested in that that
[1:26:17] actually works against the program of
[1:26:18] god
[1:26:19] because god's program is that he fills
[1:26:21] you with his presence
[1:26:23] right and then he shakes the world with
[1:26:24] you you say well the world hasn't heard
[1:26:27] about me but you can shake your world
[1:26:29] right you can shake your school or your
[1:26:30] job wherever you are on the street
[1:26:32] you can shake your little world god
[1:26:33] wants to use you to shake your world
[1:26:37] hallelujah now the reason they weren't
[1:26:39] all caught up in natural kingdom
[1:26:40] building is because they actually became
[1:26:43] they saw jesus and his program remember
[1:26:46] this is not a mental oh i understand the
[1:26:48] program this is not
[1:26:48] this is he comes into you and then you
[1:26:51] see his program and you see him
[1:26:54] amen the lord had already prophesied
[1:26:57] of the destruction of the temple so they
[1:26:59] knew these things were going to happen
[1:27:02] they jesus would go with his disciples
[1:27:04] that look at the stones of the temple
[1:27:06] and how great it was and you know
[1:27:08] how how great these stones are but then
[1:27:11] you know
[1:27:12] jesus just said there shall be not left
[1:27:15] one stone upon another
[1:27:17] that it shall not be thrown down this is
[1:27:19] matthew 24. so they're looking look how
[1:27:21] big this building is look at the great
[1:27:22] stones and the gold and all these things
[1:27:24] jesus says not one stone will be left
[1:27:26] upon another so they knew
[1:27:29] a expiry date was on this temple they
[1:27:31] knew the expiry date was coming they
[1:27:33] didn't know the exact day but they knew
[1:27:35] it was coming
[1:27:37] amen and then even jesus would would
[1:27:40] lament
[1:27:41] it oh jerusalem jerusalem now that
[1:27:43] killers the prophets and stone of them
[1:27:45] which are sent under
[1:27:46] thee how often i've gathered thy
[1:27:48] children together even as a hen gathered
[1:27:50] her chickens under her wings and ye
[1:27:52] would not behold your house is left
[1:27:55] unto you desolate
[1:27:58] so they knew this would be who's
[1:28:01] you all following me they had a
[1:28:04] vindicated messiah
[1:28:06] that said this is going to come down it
[1:28:08] doesn't matter what anyone would try and
[1:28:10] do
[1:28:11] like you look you look for the
[1:28:12] prophecies of daniel i think i've said
[1:28:14] this before
[1:28:14] it says that the greeks would come and
[1:28:17] and conquer the medes and persians
[1:28:20] and you read the history of darius and
[1:28:22] alexander the great it didn't matter
[1:28:23] what darius did he couldn't beat
[1:28:25] alexander
[1:28:26] didn't matter how many many had didn't
[1:28:28] matter his tactics he used he couldn't
[1:28:29] win a battle
[1:28:30] why is that because he was pr it was
[1:28:32] prophesied that this one would come and
[1:28:34] take him out
[1:28:36] and it's the same thing today it doesn't
[1:28:37] matter what we try and do
[1:28:39] doesn't matter what this world tries and
[1:28:40] do it'll say peace and safety peace and
[1:28:42] safety but then sudden destruction will
[1:28:44] come upon it
[1:28:45] right you can't stop the wheels of
[1:28:47] prophecy turning
[1:28:48] so it's better just to get on board i
[1:28:51] think i think life's a lot simpler we
[1:28:53] just get on board
[1:28:54] it'll it'll take away a lot of worry
[1:28:56] it'll take away a lot of trouble
[1:28:58] it'll take away double-mindedness amen
[1:28:59] it'll take away all those things
[1:29:01] because you see god's word is being
[1:29:02] fulfilled
[1:29:05] hallelujah israel
[1:29:08] as i said if you read history israel
[1:29:10] wasn't just a peaceful place
[1:29:12] but there was rebellion brewing for
[1:29:14] years
[1:29:16] there's many rebellions rights just go
[1:29:18] read wikipedia
[1:29:20] it wasn't just one thing and then titus
[1:29:21] turns up there are many things going on
[1:29:24] there was a series of riots and revolts
[1:29:27] that erupted sporadically this is my
[1:29:29] words from 37 a.d
[1:29:31] to 66 a.d which caused the jewish people
[1:29:34] to actually expel the romans from parts
[1:29:36] of israel
[1:29:37] but there was so much infighting within
[1:29:39] the factions of the sadducees the
[1:29:41] pharisees and the zealots
[1:29:43] and even in 80 i think 68 there was
[1:29:45] actually a civil war going on briefly
[1:29:47] in jerusalem and they actually wiped out
[1:29:49] most of the government
[1:29:51] their own government why because as
[1:29:54] as as a world falls apart it begins to
[1:29:56] tear itself apart
[1:29:58] you see any kind of country that goes
[1:30:00] through strife civil war it tears itself
[1:30:02] apart
[1:30:02] other other actors will be aiding either
[1:30:05] side sure they will
[1:30:06] be but you know it'll be tearing itself
[1:30:07] apart
[1:30:09] but i'll just say this they tore
[1:30:11] themselves apart
[1:30:12] trying to make israel great again
[1:30:17] let's make america great again let's
[1:30:19] make christendom great again let's make
[1:30:21] the world great again
[1:30:22] they tore themselves apart under that
[1:30:23] slogan that's what i'm saying the
[1:30:25] history is repeating itself right
[1:30:30] and then eight yeah so most of the
[1:30:32] israeli government was killed in 1868
[1:30:35] then in a.d 70 titus laid siege and
[1:30:38] destroyed jerusalem
[1:30:40] and there was a great slaughter and he
[1:30:42] even let the jews in
[1:30:44] from other parts of the world who had
[1:30:45] come to celebrate the passover feast
[1:30:48] so they had it they're at a season of a
[1:30:49] great holy festival
[1:30:51] titus is around the outside he just lets
[1:30:53] them in lets them in lets them in
[1:30:56] they starve even some of the zealots
[1:30:57] actually burnt a lot of their food
[1:30:59] supplies to try and preempt something
[1:31:02] and then he went and massacred them all
[1:31:05] all because they said will not have this
[1:31:06] man rule over us
[1:31:08] they want to brabus instead of jesus
[1:31:11] you reap what you sow but can you
[1:31:15] imagine i just want to maybe just
[1:31:16] just let's just go back to those times
[1:31:19] before titus turned up
[1:31:20] you know from from 1837 even up to you
[1:31:23] know even at that point there was a lot
[1:31:25] of there's
[1:31:25] a lot of strife and trouble against the
[1:31:27] romans but could you imagine being a
[1:31:29] jewish believer
[1:31:31] in in the holy land in that day there'd
[1:31:33] be a lot of voices going on we're going
[1:31:35] to rise up
[1:31:36] and there'd be public support would try
[1:31:38] and be gathered because it'd be under
[1:31:40] a religious banner we're going to
[1:31:42] fulfill the scripture it's time for the
[1:31:43] messiah
[1:31:44] to come we're going to restore the
[1:31:45] kingdom and you know but but the true
[1:31:47] believer who was fully converted they
[1:31:49] wouldn't have been caught up in it
[1:31:50] that's right but imagine the pressure
[1:31:52] you say you're a jew and you're not
[1:31:53] joining this only real jews will join
[1:31:56] this
[1:31:57] we've got to restore the kingdom we're
[1:31:58] going to restore this land of abraham
[1:32:00] isaac and jacob
[1:32:01] you know there'll be a pressure come on
[1:32:03] you but the true believer wasn't
[1:32:06] interested
[1:32:07] because they were serving they're in a
[1:32:09] different program
[1:32:10] they weren't in the program of of of the
[1:32:13] political arena in that day they're
[1:32:14] under a different program
[1:32:17] and even even when titus remember jesus
[1:32:20] warned them
[1:32:21] when you see this all taking place flee
[1:32:24] pray that your flight is not on the
[1:32:25] sabbath why
[1:32:26] because the gates are closed or in the
[1:32:27] winter time or whatever just flee the
[1:32:29] city
[1:32:30] and so when titus begin to came all the
[1:32:32] christians just fled for their lives
[1:32:33] and they weren't caught in it because
[1:32:36] they heard they had a vindicated messiah
[1:32:39] say when you see these things happen see
[1:32:41] they were looking on this
[1:32:44] are you with me they weren't following
[1:32:45] other voices they were looking on this
[1:32:47] because they knew it had been proven
[1:32:49] it had been vindicated it was accurate
[1:32:51] it was correct
[1:32:53] hallelujah and so when titus came in
[1:32:55] they fled for the hills and they weren't
[1:32:57] caught up in the destruction
[1:32:58] and it's the same thing with the bride
[1:33:00] of christ today amen we can't go through
[1:33:02] a tribulation
[1:33:02] amen we can't go through the destruction
[1:33:04] of today i mean if you have the holy
[1:33:06] ghost
[1:33:07] if he is on the inside of the inside of
[1:33:09] you i mean the lord's going to take you
[1:33:10] with him
[1:33:12] hello isn't that the wonderful thing we
[1:33:13] have a way of escape today hallelujah
[1:33:15] it's not something you you work out in
[1:33:17] your mind you meet a person
[1:33:19] amen jesus is a person
[1:33:25] you know part of his program now we're
[1:33:26] just going to go kind of from that view
[1:33:28] down
[1:33:29] zoom in you know part of god's program
[1:33:31] is entertaining jesus
[1:33:35] when jesus went to the feast of of of
[1:33:37] simon the pharisee
[1:33:39] he was invited but only one one person
[1:33:42] and
[1:33:42] actually entertained him in that feast
[1:33:44] and it's the same thing you know
[1:33:46] we always invite him to come to church
[1:33:48] but do we invite but but do we entertain
[1:33:50] him
[1:33:50] all right or do we leave him in in
[1:33:53] service
[1:33:54] you know with with with dirty feet
[1:33:56] unwelcome in the corner
[1:33:58] remember it's our attitude towards them
[1:34:00] as we worship as we hear the word
[1:34:02] i mean that's how we entertain and we
[1:34:03] pour our lives at his feet we take
[1:34:05] everything we have
[1:34:06] breaker alabaster box we give him
[1:34:08] worship we give him praise we give him
[1:34:10] thanks
[1:34:10] hallelujah and by doing that you're
[1:34:12] actually entertaining the lord
[1:34:14] amen hallelujah wouldn't that be a great
[1:34:16] thing imagine if he came in his physical
[1:34:18] form we know we'll meet him in the air
[1:34:20] but just imagine that he came in his
[1:34:21] physical form
[1:34:22] and he knocked on your door oh boy
[1:34:25] imagine that
[1:34:26] hallelujah be a rejoicing time hardly be
[1:34:29] a worship time you begin oh lord jesus
[1:34:31] lord you come to a place such as mine
[1:34:34] i'm so thankful you'd come here your
[1:34:36] presence would come here
[1:34:37] hallelujah that i can really entertain
[1:34:39] you amen and his presence comes into our
[1:34:41] house and
[1:34:42] and his presence comes into the church
[1:34:44] hallelujah and some are washing his feet
[1:34:46] and some are entertaining him saying
[1:34:48] stay a bit longer lord
[1:34:49] stay a bit longer lord i want to
[1:34:51] entertain you lord
[1:34:52] and some sit there and just leave them
[1:34:54] unwashed feet
[1:34:56] every service we can wash his feet
[1:35:00] every service we can refresh him amen
[1:35:02] glory to
[1:35:03] him hallelujah brother baby says in the
[1:35:05] worst sinner in the city and jesus many
[1:35:06] times
[1:35:07] is not entertained as a guest when he
[1:35:09] comes to the church
[1:35:10] god help us to recognize that jesus
[1:35:13] wants to be entertained
[1:35:15] but when the holy ghost comes into the
[1:35:17] church and wants to bless the church
[1:35:18] people just sit there just as cold and
[1:35:20] starchy
[1:35:21] that's the same thing that the pharisee
[1:35:23] did now i'll just ask you a question
[1:35:24] has jesus ever done anything bad
[1:35:28] to anyone only good amen
[1:35:31] he's never been mean to me he's never
[1:35:33] robbed me he's never cheated me he's
[1:35:34] never made fun of me he's never
[1:35:36] humiliated me he's never hurt me in any
[1:35:38] way he's only done good
[1:35:40] i so we can come into the church now now
[1:35:43] remember
[1:35:44] this is who we're worshiping he's never
[1:35:46] done anything bad
[1:35:47] amen right are you following me you say
[1:35:49] well i'm going through trials
[1:35:51] he isn't doing anything bad to you
[1:35:54] hallelujah so why do we
[1:35:56] why do we come in now we all have
[1:35:58] trouble we all have pressures and
[1:36:00] burdens and things
[1:36:01] but why do those things dictate to us
[1:36:03] how we should worship god
[1:36:05] are you with me i mean here was a woman
[1:36:07] she was a prostitute she wasn't even
[1:36:09] invited
[1:36:10] i mean everyone knew who she was she had
[1:36:13] a lot of trouble in her life you know
[1:36:15] no doubt she was put out on the street
[1:36:18] by her parents saying she is a very
[1:36:20] scarred human being in her spirit
[1:36:22] but yet all that was put aside when she
[1:36:25] saw
[1:36:26] jesus with unwashed feet not made
[1:36:28] welcome
[1:36:29] all of her past and her complexes and
[1:36:31] her scars and whatever it was
[1:36:33] she put that to one side because she's
[1:36:35] like i must make him welcome
[1:36:37] hello and then she got all the money she
[1:36:39] had she went to the apothecary bought
[1:36:41] the best
[1:36:42] said i want that one and maybe he looked
[1:36:43] at her saying okay well where's the
[1:36:44] money all remember
[1:36:46] all of that money that she earned to buy
[1:36:49] that
[1:36:49] was from her life it wasn't from a
[1:36:53] it was from her prostitution but she
[1:36:57] gave it she got the alabaster box
[1:36:58] put in a rope somehow got past the foot
[1:37:01] wash flunky and those different ones
[1:37:03] and she got to where jesus was
[1:37:05] hallelujah
[1:37:06] and she broke that alabaster box
[1:37:08] anointed his feet washer washed his feet
[1:37:10] with his tears dried us
[1:37:12] dried his feet with her hair and all
[1:37:13] those things she was
[1:37:15] entertaining jesus and she never even
[1:37:18] asked him
[1:37:19] sir can i do this to you never asked
[1:37:23] didn't know how she'd be accepted but
[1:37:25] she was accepted you come to the lord
[1:37:27] you'll always be accepted
[1:37:28] all that comes to me will know i'll know
[1:37:30] why it's cast out he said
[1:37:32] doesn't matter what condition you know
[1:37:33] it's amazing people want to get patched
[1:37:35] up before they come to church
[1:37:37] they want to get their lives right
[1:37:38] before they come to church that's the
[1:37:40] wrong way around i mean we're coming to
[1:37:41] the prince of god that god can patch us
[1:37:43] up
[1:37:44] he can fix us and heal us and mend us
[1:37:46] and change us
[1:37:55] it's not about this it's not about
[1:37:57] having the haircut you know what about
[1:37:59] the heart
[1:38:00] i mean she looked wrong on the outside
[1:38:01] but her heart was i must entertain jesus
[1:38:04] i must wash his feet hallelujah all the
[1:38:07] pharisees were like
[1:38:08] you know they were they were all like
[1:38:12] this
[1:38:13] and they would have had the finest
[1:38:14] finest one not just a farmer's one
[1:38:18] you know they were looking the part but
[1:38:20] in the inside they weren't the parts
[1:38:22] harley but she was the part on the
[1:38:24] inside and that's what matters
[1:38:27] oh that's the thing that matters if your
[1:38:28] husband i want to entertain
[1:38:30] jesus i may not understand she didn't
[1:38:32] understand all things
[1:38:33] but something in her said i must wash
[1:38:35] his feet
[1:38:38] amen that's part of god's program
[1:38:41] i like it amen
[1:38:45] and he don't get sick of it it doesn't
[1:38:47] become common to him
[1:38:48] hey we've got eternity we're going to
[1:38:50] worship him do you think he's going to
[1:38:51] get bored
[1:38:52] do you think we're going to get bored
[1:38:54] even if we yeah
[1:38:55] i don't think it'll be just this but
[1:38:56] even if we just get round the throne and
[1:38:58] that's eternity
[1:39:00] oh boy and we worship him and we crown
[1:39:01] and king of kings and you know
[1:39:03] you know and that's all we do for
[1:39:04] eternity it won't be boring
[1:39:06] it will be awesome that'll be glorious i
[1:39:09] mean wave after wave of his holy spirit
[1:39:11] moving over us and we'll just praise him
[1:39:13] and give him glory
[1:39:14] he said that's boring oh no no no to
[1:39:17] step into his presence that's why i pray
[1:39:19] this become real personal just about now
[1:39:21] when we step into his presence let not
[1:39:23] let's not push it away
[1:39:24] and care about what other people will
[1:39:26] say about us who cares
[1:39:28] she didn't go to simon the pharisees
[1:39:29] said no mr simon mr pharisee sir
[1:39:31] do you mind if i come and do this in
[1:39:32] your face what do you think what will
[1:39:34] you think about me
[1:39:36] she didn't care she had to get to jesus
[1:39:40] hallelujah and that's what we want to do
[1:39:45] but she had a revelation that this
[1:39:48] jesus of nazareth was more than just a
[1:39:51] man
[1:39:52] see the whole program of god is built
[1:39:54] upon revelation
[1:39:56] where jesus would ask his disciples in
[1:39:58] matthew 16
[1:39:59] who do men say that i am and he's
[1:40:02] and he's asking us the same question who
[1:40:04] do you say this jesus
[1:40:06] is well he was a healer he was a good
[1:40:08] man he did this
[1:40:10] it's beyond that he was a prophet more
[1:40:11] than that he was god manifested in the
[1:40:14] flesh he was the god of the prophets
[1:40:17] hallelujah and when peter would say to
[1:40:19] him thou art the christ the son of
[1:40:20] living god see god wants a response
[1:40:24] right he wants a response
[1:40:28] and peter said thou art the christ son
[1:40:29] living god he says blessed art thou
[1:40:31] simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has
[1:40:33] not revealed this unto you
[1:40:35] so the apostles the other ones didn't
[1:40:38] didn't reveal us to you your parents
[1:40:39] didn't tell you you know no one told you
[1:40:41] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:40:42] revealed this unto you and upon this
[1:40:44] rock i'll build my church
[1:40:46] so the revelation of who jesus christ is
[1:40:48] that's the revel that's the rock that
[1:40:49] the church is built upon
[1:40:51] amen hallelujah
[1:40:54] so the whole program of god is built
[1:40:56] upon divine
[1:40:57] revelation this is from things that are
[1:40:58] to be jesus said in saint matthew 16th
[1:41:01] chapter
[1:41:01] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:41:03] you but my father which is in heaven has
[1:41:05] revealed this to you
[1:41:06] what was it a revelation of who he was
[1:41:08] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:41:10] and the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:41:12] against it see the revelation of jesus
[1:41:14] christ in this hour not what he was in
[1:41:17] another hour
[1:41:18] what he was now the bible expresses it's
[1:41:20] growing in the bride to the full stature
[1:41:22] therefore if the corn of wheat of christ
[1:41:24] had to fall in the ground
[1:41:26] so did the bride had to fall on the
[1:41:27] ground through the dark ages
[1:41:29] any grain that goes into the ground must
[1:41:30] die or it can't produce itself reproduce
[1:41:34] itself
[1:41:34] and the great church that he established
[1:41:36] on the day of pentecost by the sending
[1:41:38] of the holy ghost
[1:41:39] had to suffer martyrdom and go into the
[1:41:41] dirt into the earth
[1:41:43] in the dark age to bring forth again in
[1:41:45] the age of luther and to come out to the
[1:41:47] full stature of the bride of jesus
[1:41:49] christ in these last days
[1:41:51] therefore the bride and the rapture will
[1:41:53] come forth
[1:41:54] and there is all pre-planned by god all
[1:41:57] backed up from the beginning he knowed
[1:41:59] every man
[1:42:00] every place who would sit all about it
[1:42:02] it's all pre-planned
[1:42:03] god knew it would be here and he made it
[1:42:06] that way
[1:42:07] so that when we get there he's gone to
[1:42:09] prepare a place for us
[1:42:11] and when we get there it'll all be
[1:42:13] prepared just like
[1:42:14] even this night i'd say this day is
[1:42:16] prepared like this
[1:42:17] hour is prepared yes his grateful
[1:42:19] knowledge tells him all
[1:42:21] these things he says in in the message
[1:42:25] modern events may clear by prophecy
[1:42:26] and and i'm coming to a there's a
[1:42:28] purpose of reading these the shark held
[1:42:30] it and now the shack pulls away it has
[1:42:32] to and remember
[1:42:33] 20 years has passed by no denomination
[1:42:35] has come out of it it won't
[1:42:37] we're at the end of denominations the
[1:42:38] wheat's taking shape that's what's the
[1:42:40] matter with the wheat now it must lay in
[1:42:42] the prince of the sun to ripen
[1:42:43] before the combine picks it up now the
[1:42:45] events that we see taking place
[1:42:47] it's absolutely shown in the bible of
[1:42:49] every age we think we're all out of
[1:42:51] cater but we're not everything moving
[1:42:53] just exactly with god's word amen
[1:42:56] no but but what i've found interesting
[1:42:58] over the years is when people
[1:43:00] have had have taken these kind of quotes
[1:43:02] that we just got to land the prince of
[1:43:03] the sun and ripen and we just got to lay
[1:43:05] here in the prince of the sun and
[1:43:06] you know they're they're insinuating
[1:43:08] that there's no manifestation of god no
[1:43:10] more because we're just laying in the
[1:43:11] presence of the sun
[1:43:13] right so they're saying that there's you
[1:43:14] know and and and you know brother ramsay
[1:43:16] was like you know like the um
[1:43:18] you know luther was like the arms and
[1:43:19] the feet of the body and different parts
[1:43:21] and the tongue was
[1:43:22] the pentecostal move the eyes of the
[1:43:23] prophet now we're the mind of christ
[1:43:25] we're going to land the prince of the
[1:43:26] sun there's no moving parts there's no
[1:43:28] manifestation
[1:43:30] you know we're just laying in the prince
[1:43:32] of the sun to ripen
[1:43:34] but they fail to realize what did the
[1:43:37] first piece of grain do
[1:43:39] what did the first fruits do amen so so
[1:43:42] now we're talking about jesus what did
[1:43:44] jesus do
[1:43:45] he cast out devils he rejoiced greatly
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:48] amen he healed the sick raise the dead
[1:43:51] amen
[1:43:52] he was obedient to the word of god for
[1:43:53] his life there was a big manifestation
[1:43:56] holy that was the biggest manifestation
[1:43:58] ever to strike the earth of god's
[1:44:00] presence
[1:44:00] was in the ministry of our lord jesus
[1:44:02] christ and he said that ministry will
[1:44:04] continue on through my bride down
[1:44:06] through the ages now if we and then you
[1:44:07] look at the first book you know
[1:44:09] you look at the first church that was a
[1:44:11] that was a wheat church as well
[1:44:13] did they just land the prince of the sun
[1:44:14] and and talk about doctrine
[1:44:16] no they went and cast out devils are
[1:44:18] healed by sick they raise the dead amen
[1:44:20] people were born into the kingdom by
[1:44:21] their ministry hallelujah many things
[1:44:23] they were led by vision god
[1:44:25] manifested his word through their lives
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:28] that was in the beginning it shall be at
[1:44:30] the end so we can't just say well we're
[1:44:32] lying in the friends of the sun sitting
[1:44:33] around talking about doctrine
[1:44:35] it's not that there's no god comes into
[1:44:37] us and he casts out devils he raises the
[1:44:39] dead
[1:44:39] heals the sick shows visions dreams
[1:44:41] signs and wonders
[1:44:43] those things are still going on today
[1:44:45] hallelujah because if that's what the
[1:44:47] first at the end will do the same thing
[1:44:49] hallelujah amen
[1:44:53] now luke 24 we're coming down again now
[1:44:56] now we're here with clurpus and his
[1:44:57] friend
[1:44:58] took me a while but here i am
[1:45:02] brother braham said that modern events
[1:45:04] are made clear by prophecy
[1:45:06] and he went to luke 24 and says this is
[1:45:08] a prophecy of this last day
[1:45:10] you want to see what's going on in the
[1:45:11] world read luke 24
[1:45:13] read the death burial resurrection of
[1:45:14] our lord jesus christ and you'll see
[1:45:16] what's going on in this day
[1:45:19] you know it's amazing the two on the way
[1:45:21] to emmaus
[1:45:22] they ever stop and think about who they
[1:45:24] are walking with
[1:45:26] they were walking with the one who
[1:45:28] caused all these events
[1:45:30] they are walking with the resurrected
[1:45:32] lord jesus christ himself
[1:45:34] they weren't walking with another
[1:45:35] disciple they were walking with him
[1:45:37] but it was hidden from them who he
[1:45:39] really was
[1:45:41] but it's incredible now this is god in
[1:45:44] print form
[1:45:45] amen we can walk with this for years
[1:45:49] and we can think it doesn't understand
[1:45:52] what's going on in our day
[1:45:54] it was written over two thousand years
[1:45:56] ago by how many different authors
[1:45:57] it it doesn't know this book doesn't
[1:45:59] predict what's going on here remember
[1:46:01] they looked at him saying are you a
[1:46:02] stranger
[1:46:03] do you not understand what's been going
[1:46:05] on do you not understand what's just
[1:46:08] happened what's just transpired
[1:46:10] and he's acting like what do you mean
[1:46:12] and he was the one
[1:46:14] in front of he was the one in the garden
[1:46:16] with them
[1:46:17] he was the one with pilate he was the
[1:46:19] one on on the cross here's the one that
[1:46:21] was in the tomb here's the one that rose
[1:46:22] again
[1:46:23] amen he was all those ones but he's
[1:46:25] acting like what do you mean
[1:46:27] what things tell me what's going on
[1:46:32] and people will look at the bible and
[1:46:34] look at the message
[1:46:36] and they'll think it doesn't understand
[1:46:38] the day and hour which i live
[1:46:40] oh the message was preached over 50
[1:46:42] years ago brother bradman see what was
[1:46:44] going on in this day and it's more
[1:46:45] current today
[1:46:46] than it was when it was given oh this
[1:46:48] bible doesn't i mean i mean
[1:46:50] you know it's 2000 years old it's just a
[1:46:52] historical book and it's more alive
[1:46:54] and it's more current and it's more real
[1:46:56] many of the prophecies that peter and
[1:46:58] paul and the apostles gave
[1:46:59] we're living in them right it's actually
[1:47:02] manifesting now it wasn't for their days
[1:47:04] for today
[1:47:06] amen so so they had no idea
[1:47:10] they had no idea the one they were
[1:47:11] walking with was the answer to all their
[1:47:13] problems and all their questions and was
[1:47:15] the only one that could give clarity to
[1:47:17] where they were
[1:47:18] says the problem people
[1:47:23] sadly can walk along and and now this is
[1:47:27] i'll just put it this way this is now
[1:47:28] about seven billion people i'm talking
[1:47:30] about
[1:47:30] the world is walking along and it has no
[1:47:33] idea what's going on and it thinks that
[1:47:36] no one has the answer
[1:47:38] but someone has the answer someone has
[1:47:41] the answer
[1:47:42] and here he was walking with his you
[1:47:44] know purpose and his friend
[1:47:48] and sometimes we're walking along you
[1:47:49] know we can come to church sunday after
[1:47:51] sunday wednesday after wednesday you
[1:47:52] know we could have family devotions
[1:47:54] whatever
[1:47:55] but we can be looking at the word and
[1:47:57] just thinking it doesn't really
[1:47:58] understand this day and age
[1:48:01] who's been there yeah
[1:48:04] oh brother brown had no idea what would
[1:48:07] be happening in 2020
[1:48:08] really are you sure this bible doesn't
[1:48:12] predict this date are you sure
[1:48:15] that's a stranger in this day
[1:48:19] it doesn't understand the events that
[1:48:20] are going on
[1:48:22] really they talk to him like don't you
[1:48:25] know what's going on we read it didn't
[1:48:26] we
[1:48:27] don't you know what's just happened and
[1:48:30] people look at the scriptures saying
[1:48:31] don't you know
[1:48:32] this it doesn't understand it's a
[1:48:34] stranger
[1:48:37] it knows exactly he knows exactly what's
[1:48:40] going on
[1:48:42] amen this as i said the bible is more
[1:48:45] current more alive the message is more
[1:48:47] alive today
[1:48:48] than it was when it was first given
[1:48:52] they were walking alongside and they
[1:48:55] were talking to the word made flesh
[1:48:57] who had risen and they didn't recognize
[1:49:00] who he really was
[1:49:02] and they thought that he had no idea
[1:49:04] what was going on i'm just going to
[1:49:06] repeat this just to i want to label this
[1:49:07] point
[1:49:08] it's just a bible it was written
[1:49:10] thousands of years ago
[1:49:11] it's not culturally relevant today it's
[1:49:14] a different era today
[1:49:15] times have changed things you know it
[1:49:17] doesn't
[1:49:18] fit with today really
[1:49:22] i want you to think about it because
[1:49:24] remember just like
[1:49:25] the reason i read that dream that yo yo
[1:49:28] brother bam said look on this
[1:49:31] but if you're not looking on this you'll
[1:49:33] think something else is better to look
[1:49:35] on
[1:49:36] right if you if you think this is not
[1:49:39] worth looking on
[1:49:40] you'll look at something else right but
[1:49:43] this has the answer
[1:49:44] we have the answer today
[1:49:50] well the message is over eleven hundred
[1:49:52] yo eleven hundred odd sermons preached
[1:49:53] fifty years ago it's not relevant today
[1:49:55] really
[1:49:56] are you sure our brother have got it
[1:49:58] wrong are you sure
[1:50:00] his ministry is a stranger in the land
[1:50:02] today it is
[1:50:05] but he knew exactly when he prophesied
[1:50:08] things happening
[1:50:09] it's for tight it's for today
[1:50:12] but you don't know what's going on you
[1:50:14] don't know the struggles that are going
[1:50:15] on in the world you don't understand you
[1:50:17] live in a little bubble brother ben
[1:50:18] you're not interested in these things
[1:50:20] but if you only knew him amen amen if
[1:50:23] you really knew who was walking with you
[1:50:25] even i'll say this morning
[1:50:27] and trying to get your attention and try
[1:50:28] and open your eyes i mean you
[1:50:30] you'd really understand oh my if you
[1:50:32] could just see the lord jesus being
[1:50:34] present
[1:50:36] hallelujah and he has the answer to all
[1:50:39] of your questions
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:43] before this mary and the other woman
[1:50:45] went to the tomb to anoint jesus with
[1:50:47] spices his body
[1:50:50] they went there broken and said just as
[1:50:53] the two on the way to emmaus to try and
[1:50:55] find comfort
[1:50:56] in anointing the dead with spices or try
[1:50:59] and get some consolation and many people
[1:51:01] they'll go to dead places to try and
[1:51:03] find comfort
[1:51:04] he's not dead he's risen they went to
[1:51:07] the wrong place
[1:51:10] but mary was spoken to by jesus in her
[1:51:13] trouble
[1:51:13] and in her great sadness and that great
[1:51:16] sadness turned to joy
[1:51:18] when she just said when he just said to
[1:51:20] her one word mary
[1:51:22] amen and her eyes came open and so it's
[1:51:24] you lord you've risen
[1:51:27] hallelujah we've all had different plans
[1:51:30] this year
[1:51:31] if we stood here a year ago and we said
[1:51:34] how's 2020 going to be
[1:51:35] we'd all be wrong yeah that's right
[1:51:37] everything we planned on doing
[1:51:40] out the window i think what's going on
[1:51:42] here
[1:51:43] god wasn't surprised they were very
[1:51:48] he would even tell them i'm going to be
[1:51:49] crucified who's read that
[1:51:52] he tells them more than once i'm going
[1:51:53] to be crucified and third i'm going to
[1:51:54] raise again
[1:51:56] but when the event happened they were
[1:51:59] like what's going on
[1:52:00] they had plans their plans were dashed
[1:52:03] to a million pieces
[1:52:06] but the lord's plans is the program that
[1:52:09] we've gotta we've gotta hold on to
[1:52:12] see when plans get dashed
[1:52:16] many people think now their lives are on
[1:52:18] hold actually i hear a whole
[1:52:19] generation's on hold
[1:52:21] there push the pause button we can't do
[1:52:24] this and this and this
[1:52:26] and the problem when that happens is it
[1:52:28] often produces insecurity what's going
[1:52:30] to happen now
[1:52:31] my whole future that i had has now
[1:52:34] gone off and it produces a lot
[1:52:37] less lack or loss of focus
[1:52:41] and a paralysis who's with me
[1:52:44] you understand we had plans we all had
[1:52:47] we all had plans who has plans
[1:52:50] those plans just left
[1:52:53] and who knows when it's going to return
[1:52:57] so what does it produce insecurity
[1:52:58] what's going to happen just just think
[1:53:00] just naturally now
[1:53:02] many people want to go study go study if
[1:53:04] you can many people want to go overseas
[1:53:06] but now we can't do those things but i
[1:53:08] had this all planned out this is what i
[1:53:10] was going to do now what's going to
[1:53:12] happen with my life what's my future
[1:53:13] going to be
[1:53:14] who's had those kind of questions and it
[1:53:17] produces allah
[1:53:18] a loss of focus
[1:53:22] why are you talking about these things
[1:53:24] very simply
[1:53:26] they their whole life was falling apart
[1:53:30] when jesus died their whole life yes
[1:53:33] that was like covered but times a
[1:53:35] billion yes because they couldn't
[1:53:37] remember they in the jewish way
[1:53:41] you are either part of the synagogue or
[1:53:43] you are an outcast
[1:53:45] and they publicly said any man who
[1:53:47] follow anyone who follows us jesus of
[1:53:48] nazareth he's an outcast in society
[1:53:50] and it's not like new zealand we can
[1:53:52] just basically just just disappear into
[1:53:54] the woodwork
[1:53:56] everyone knew everyone and so they had
[1:53:59] decided
[1:54:00] we are actually going to become outcasts
[1:54:02] in our own nation
[1:54:03] to follow this jesus and now this jesus
[1:54:06] was dead
[1:54:07] in a tomb and now that tomb was empty
[1:54:09] and they had no idea where he was
[1:54:12] don't you think that would produce some
[1:54:13] kind of insecurity
[1:54:15] it would produce like a paralysis in
[1:54:17] their lives
[1:54:19] but then he began to walk with them and
[1:54:22] this is what i'm going to say
[1:54:24] he will go with you amen he went with
[1:54:27] them
[1:54:28] to make sure they understood what was
[1:54:29] going on in their day
[1:54:31] it wasn't now okay you know he didn't
[1:54:33] sit them down and make them sit a test
[1:54:35] he walked with them and opened the
[1:54:37] scriptures to them
[1:54:39] i mean that then they would understand
[1:54:41] exactly what is happening now
[1:54:43] amen brother man would say this he says
[1:54:46] should make it plain today the thing
[1:54:47] that we see the holy spirit doing he
[1:54:49] once said search the scriptures
[1:54:51] and he wants us to do it today notice he
[1:54:53] began with moses prophecy now we've got
[1:54:55] jesus
[1:54:56] and the two on the way to emmaus now
[1:54:57] i've gone there he began with moses
[1:55:00] prophecy the bible said he beginning
[1:55:02] with moses and all of the prophets he
[1:55:04] started with moses a prophet
[1:55:05] said moses the lord your god shall raise
[1:55:08] up among you
[1:55:09] among the people the lord god shall
[1:55:11] raise up a prophet
[1:55:13] now he might have said purpose and your
[1:55:14] friend here did not moses say
[1:55:16] that in these days the lord god would
[1:55:18] raise up a prophet and this man that
[1:55:20] they crucified did he meet that
[1:55:21] qualification
[1:55:22] now moses prophesied this and now you
[1:55:25] and now you haven't had a prophet for
[1:55:27] for hundreds and hundreds of years and
[1:55:29] here is this man raised up
[1:55:30] and what was this man's forerunner did
[1:55:32] you say get it and all the prophets said
[1:55:34] about him for this age he spoke
[1:55:36] to them that sure would have been
[1:55:38] interested to listen at him
[1:55:40] wouldn't you like to have heard him i'd
[1:55:42] like to have heard him to hear him what
[1:55:43] he said what that the prophet said about
[1:55:45] himself
[1:55:46] but he ever said it was him he just
[1:55:48] showed them by prophecy
[1:55:50] he just said the prophet said this would
[1:55:52] happen see let's go back a few minutes
[1:55:54] and now
[1:55:55] let's listen to the words quoted from
[1:55:58] himself watching the word itself
[1:56:00] quoting the word of himself the word
[1:56:02] itself quoting the word of himself
[1:56:04] not tell them that he was that but just
[1:56:06] let the word speak for itself
[1:56:08] then we know who he was the letter of
[1:56:10] the word quoting
[1:56:11] the word in flesh quoting the the word
[1:56:14] of the letter
[1:56:15] being fully identified with himself look
[1:56:17] here now let's listen to him quote
[1:56:20] now we know that they were all briefed
[1:56:22] of the late happenings
[1:56:23] uh that is of the crucifixion and of the
[1:56:27] story of the resurrection
[1:56:28] the tomb as we just read now he goes
[1:56:30] straight to the word of prophecy about
[1:56:32] himself
[1:56:32] now let's just think that he said this
[1:56:35] he said a lot more than this but watch
[1:56:37] let him say hear him say turn to
[1:56:39] zechariah 11 12. was it the messiah to
[1:56:41] be sold
[1:56:42] according to the prophet for 30 pieces
[1:56:44] of silver you just said that this man
[1:56:45] was sold for 30 pieces of silver turn
[1:56:47] over
[1:56:48] you're getting the scripture zechariah
[1:56:49] 11 and 12 and he said did you notice
[1:56:51] that david said in the psalm psalm 41
[1:56:53] and 9
[1:56:54] that he was to be portrayed by his
[1:56:56] friends
[1:56:57] again then again in zechariah he was
[1:56:59] forsaken by his disciples
[1:57:01] then in psalms 35 11 accused accused by
[1:57:04] false witnesses you just said he was
[1:57:06] isaiah 53 and 7 he was done before his
[1:57:08] accusers
[1:57:09] isaiah 50 and 6 they scourged him
[1:57:12] the prophet said psalms 22 that he was
[1:57:14] to cry on the cross my god my god why is
[1:57:16] that forsaken me did he do that
[1:57:18] i mean day before yesterday afternoon
[1:57:20] psalms 22 again 18 his garments were
[1:57:22] parted among them did they do that
[1:57:25] and psalms 22 7-8 mocked by his enemies
[1:57:28] the church psalms 22 again
[1:57:29] there would not be a bone in his body to
[1:57:31] be broke but they pierced my hands and
[1:57:33] my feet he said
[1:57:34] holding his hands behind him no doubt at
[1:57:35] the time isaiah 53 and 12
[1:57:38] said he had died between male factors
[1:57:40] isaiah 53 and 9
[1:57:42] said he was buried with the rich psalms
[1:57:44] 16 and 10 said i'll not leave his soul
[1:57:47] in hell
[1:57:47] neither shall i see my holy one to see
[1:57:49] corruption and was not malachi 3 the
[1:57:51] forerunner of this man
[1:57:53] oh i'd like to have heard him quote that
[1:57:55] look at the prophecies notice then all
[1:57:57] the types he would have went through
[1:57:58] about isaac in genesis 22
[1:58:00] how god foreshadowed isaac and his
[1:58:02] father abraham took his own son packing
[1:58:04] the wood up the hill
[1:58:05] and offered up his own son i like it i
[1:58:07] just asked that did he do that
[1:58:10] did this just happen i'll just ask the
[1:58:12] question about today
[1:58:15] has he sent a forerunner in this day did
[1:58:16] he do that did he come down on the ohio
[1:58:19] river did he do that
[1:58:20] did a healing revival go around the
[1:58:22] world did he do that i mean has he
[1:58:24] called the bride to himself did he do
[1:58:26] that
[1:58:26] did he prophesy destruction is coming to
[1:58:28] the world has he done that

[1:59:26] what did he do he walked with them
[1:59:28] until they saw he was alive hallelujah
[1:59:31] because they went into the house
[1:59:32] and he took the bread and he did
[1:59:34] something he did before he died
[1:59:36] he broke the bread and their eyes came
[1:59:37] open it's the lord

[1:59:57] tomb's empty not because the tomb is

[2:00:02] buried it someone said look the tomb's
[2:00:03] empty
[2:00:04] but it's very different when the one who
[2:00:05] went into the tomb says i lay my life
[2:00:07] down i'll take it back up again
[2:00:09] i'll be with you even in you to the end
[2:00:10] of the world and he comes and vindicates

[2:01:01] hallelujah the bible became a living
[2:01:03] reality and it still is
[2:01:04] i've seen him heal the sick i've seen
[2:01:06] him change the storms i've seen him cast
[2:01:08] out devils
[2:01:09] i've seen him come down and change lives
[2:01:10] i've seen people receive the holy ghost
[2:01:12] year after year i've seen god transform
[2:01:14] people i've seen this bible live
[2:01:17] and i'm not saying that the boast
[2:01:18] because he's alive geez
[2:01:20] i was so i'm just i'm just a simple kind
[2:01:22] of fellow i just realized
[2:01:24] if if they say he's alive then he's
[2:01:26] alive
[2:01:27] and if he's alive i can meet him and if
[2:01:30] i
[2:01:30] am he said to me met lord i want to meet
[2:01:32] you hallelujah
[2:01:35] and that's the kind of god he is and if
[2:01:37] he says i'm your comforter then lord
[2:01:38] you're going to have to comfort me
[2:01:39] sometimes and i follow them comfy lord i
[2:01:42] need a guide you need to guide me
[2:01:43] through this trouble and it guides me
[2:01:44] through the trouble
[2:01:45] lord i need you to heal my body he heals
[2:01:46] my body lord i need you to come on the
[2:01:48] scene for me and my family and he comes
[2:01:50] on the scene for me and my family
[2:01:51] lord i need you to undertake in this
[2:01:53] troubleless time when the world is
[2:01:55] falling apart says i'm your rock
[2:01:57] i'm your foundation i'm your stability
[2:02:00] i'm your guide in this dark time
[2:02:02] oh liz it doesn't matter what's going on
[2:02:03] in the world the world will fall apart
[2:02:05] worse and worse
[2:02:07] it'll get worse but there's a people on
[2:02:10] the earth
[2:02:11] this this book tells me everything that
[2:02:13] can be shaken will be shaken
[2:02:14] rule that cannot be shaken will remain
[2:02:17] what will remain
[2:02:18] the kingdom of god and the bride of
[2:02:19] christ
[2:02:21] so let the world fall unfortunately
[2:02:26] yes does it make you happy to say well
[2:02:28] what happened there with the jews from
[2:02:30] from
[2:02:31] jesus day to the structure of
[2:02:32] jerusalem's repeating again does that
[2:02:34] make you happy
[2:02:35] it doesn't make me happy who
[2:02:38] who in their right mind would rejoice
[2:02:40] that the world's going to be burned
[2:02:42] it has to i'm sorry but it doesn't make
[2:02:45] it doesn't give me any joy that the
[2:02:47] people i know
[2:02:49] may go into that i should have heard a
[2:02:53] big big big fat amen right there
[2:02:56] are you no none of us are even our worst
[2:02:59] enemy
[2:03:00] why would you even want your enemy
[2:03:01] because the reason you wouldn't want
[2:03:03] them to go into that is because they had
[2:03:04] to go stand before a white throne
[2:03:05] judgment
[2:03:06] at the end of it why on earth would you
[2:03:07] want anyone doesn't matter what they did
[2:03:09] to you and how long and whatever
[2:03:11] could be years and decades of abuse and
[2:03:13] scarring and hurting and pain
[2:03:14] you wouldn't want them to stand in that
[2:03:16] place
[2:03:18] so i don't rejoice about these things
[2:03:22] but the thing is it should give us a
[2:03:23] real realization remember there is going
[2:03:25] to be a rapture sir
[2:03:27] amen just as sure as i'm standing here
[2:03:30] there will be a translation of a people
[2:03:32] hallelujah and we are living right in
[2:03:35] the throes of it
[2:03:37] amen amen oh but these people want me to
[2:03:39] do this and this wants me and all this
[2:03:41] going on
[2:03:42] put god first in everything put him
[2:03:45] first in everything and everything will
[2:03:46] come out just right
[2:03:47] but put him first hallelujah
[2:03:51] yes he walked with them to make them
[2:03:54] realize that he was alive and not just
[2:03:56] that
[2:03:57] but to make them realize that they were
[2:03:59] part of the resurrection
[2:04:01] hallelujah because remember it wasn't
[2:04:02] just him that was resurrected there to
[2:04:04] be a people that were once dead and
[2:04:06] trespassed and sins be made alive in
[2:04:08] christ in the upper room
[2:04:10] hallelujah you know it astounds me and
[2:04:13] and
[2:04:13] i'll just find a place to quit but it
[2:04:15] astounds me jesus appeared to himself
[2:04:18] jesus appeared to 500 of his disciples
[2:04:21] but only 120 were in the upper room
[2:04:24] where were those other people
[2:04:27] i don't want to be like those other 380
[2:04:31] if i can do that you know i don't want
[2:04:32] to be one of them
[2:04:34] i would have been one of the 120. yes
[2:04:37] sir you know so we don't just want to be
[2:04:38] caught up in something at all you know
[2:04:40] the lord moving i think no
[2:04:41] we want to know him personally amen we
[2:04:44] want to know him in such a way that
[2:04:45] if you're the only one remember enoch
[2:04:48] walked with god
[2:04:50] it was a day it wasn't just you know
[2:04:52] sometimes we think of enoch as just a
[2:04:53] green grassy field not a care in the
[2:04:54] world
[2:04:56] and god says you want to come up he's
[2:04:57] like yeah okay
[2:05:00] there was trouble there was strife
[2:05:03] there was judgment coming the world was
[2:05:05] falling apart in his day
[2:05:08] but yet he could live in an atmosphere
[2:05:11] he could live in an atmosphere that the
[2:05:12] only thing that mattered really with him
[2:05:14] was walking with his lord jesus
[2:05:16] and that was pointing to you
[2:05:24] why do you think he died he died that
[2:05:27] he'd dwell on you
[2:05:29] not just whatever historical fact that
[2:05:32] happened but he would make calvary
[2:05:34] live that you'd actually see the power
[2:05:36] of the cross living in your life
[2:05:38] and you'll walk with him in such a way
[2:05:39] i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna quit
[2:05:42] but you say world events
[2:05:46] go read it i know i've probably said it
[2:05:47] over the years but go read
[2:05:49] the the the betrayal of the lord all the
[2:05:51] way to the resurrection
[2:05:53] and brotherhood says these are modern
[2:05:54] events made clear
[2:05:56] mondevinci you see around them and make
[2:05:57] clear by that yes
[2:06:00] you say but what about everything else
[2:06:01] in the world no that's the event
[2:06:03] remember the greatest event that's going
[2:06:05] to take place is that people
[2:06:07] are going to leave this world who will
[2:06:08] not taste death
[2:06:11] that's going to be a big event in the
[2:06:13] calendar sure the world will go on and
[2:06:15] not see it but there will be a people
[2:06:17] and they will walk with god and will be
[2:06:19] not because god has taken them thank you
[2:06:22] and i believe by his grace not by oh
[2:06:24] have you earned it
[2:06:25] oh no remember people who try and you
[2:06:28] know
[2:06:29] people try and uh what do you call it
[2:06:31] debate or reasoning out with god
[2:06:33] but i'm a good person i'm this i can
[2:06:35] sing i'm this i was raised in church all
[2:06:37] these things remember
[2:06:38] if you give them all your good you've
[2:06:40] got to pass them all your bad
[2:06:42] yes and our righteousness is but filthy
[2:06:45] rags in his sight
[2:06:46] so we have nothing in our own nothing to
[2:06:48] bring to the table
[2:06:49] he just says meet me surrender your
[2:06:52] whole being
[2:06:53] don't just join a church you're not my
[2:06:55] greatest fear
[2:06:56] we just joined church
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:01] yes that's a failure jesus didn't die to
[2:07:05] make church members
[2:07:06] he died that he would live in people
[2:07:09] he'd die that he'd come and dwell in
[2:07:10] people and live his word out of people
[2:07:13] and that's why he died i don't want to
[2:07:16] just be a church person
[2:07:18] i'm sorry i'm probably rambling on now
[2:07:19] but you know
[2:07:21] he can walk with you in such a way
[2:07:24] you'll make everything clear all your
[2:07:26] troubles will vanish
[2:07:27] remember their broken hearts didn't stay
[2:07:29] broken hearts can you imagine that
[2:07:31] you don't know what's going on a few
[2:07:33] hours later they see him break the
[2:07:34] breath lord it's you
[2:07:36] mary goes to the tomb thinks he's a
[2:07:39] gardener
[2:07:40] put yourself there i put myself there
[2:07:42] often and
[2:07:43] he says to her if you know where he's
[2:07:46] been taken
[2:07:46] tell me so i'll carry him away the lord
[2:07:50] didn't want him to carry
[2:07:51] carrie didn't want her to carry away a
[2:07:52] dead body
[2:07:55] he wanted her to have a resurrection he
[2:07:58] wanted her to meet him
[2:07:59] amen hallelujah and she he just said her
[2:08:02] name and said mary her eyes came open
[2:08:04] and all her broken hearted
[2:08:06] disappointments just vanished because
[2:08:08] she realized
[2:08:09] what he promised to do he has done it
[2:08:11] amen hallelujah
[2:08:12] glory to his name amen god the musicians
[2:08:14] please
[2:08:16] our lord lives amen hallelujah
[2:08:21] let's not be caught up in all these
[2:08:22] things going on
[2:08:26] it won't help us none
[2:08:30] i mean let's let's just stand this
[2:08:32] morning shall we
[2:08:34] i'll ask you a question is he that real
[2:08:36] to you
[2:08:38] is he that real to you if what i've said
[2:08:40] is a bit foreign
[2:08:42] i just want to ask you just want to slip
[2:08:43] your hand up this morning and say lord
[2:08:45] make it real
[2:08:46] where it's no longer just an idea or
[2:08:48] just something this man's been spouting
[2:08:50] on for about an hour about
[2:08:51] but maybe a real thing amen let's just
[2:08:54] let's just pray together shall we
[2:08:56] lord jesus lord
[2:08:59] i always feel like i just chop it all up
[2:09:01] lord but lord i just pray that you just
[2:09:04] make it so real to each one here

[2:09:09] god
[2:09:10] lord you reveal yourself and your word
[2:09:12] to us lord and not only who you are but
[2:09:14] you reveal who we are
[2:09:16] lord it's not election lord it's not
[2:09:17] trying to learn something but lord you
[2:09:19] come and minister to us like only you
[2:09:21] can
[2:09:21] so dear god i just pray lord that lord
[2:09:24] as we walk with you
[2:09:26] lord jesus in this troublesome time that
[2:09:28] we're living and lord
[2:09:31] many of us here in this country think
[2:09:32] we're just living on the back side
[2:09:34] of the pacific and we're in a bubble and
[2:09:36] everything's fine but
[2:09:37] lord there is trouble on every hand said
[2:09:40] dear god i pray we wouldn't be caught up

[2:09:47] look on you
[2:09:48] lord may we be caught up in you lord
[2:09:50] jesus lord maybe anointed with your
[2:09:52] spirit lord
[2:09:53] not like that lord lord there would have
[2:09:55] been an anointing no doubt upon all the
[2:09:58] jews for that revolt and that rebellion
[2:10:00] and all those things but there are
[2:10:01] another people in that land that are
[2:10:02] anointed with your holy ghost

[2:10:06] political ploys and pools and
[2:10:08] fights and all those things lord they
[2:10:09] were caught up in you
