screaming fighting pulling or maybe just running to him because you need him but yet he is so wonderful and he takes us with his open arms and he deals with us I want to thank this evening my pasta pasta pin thank you for this opportunity thank the elders of the church for the opportunity that I have to stand in front of you I am nothing I'm not a preacher I'm not a song leader but when you rub shoulders with brothers and sisters of the caliber that we have in front of us it's iron sharpening iron it makes us better people we learn from each other we learn to stand on our own whether good or bad it puts you in a place it puts you in a trial then it takes you out of a trial so brothers and sisters I just ask a few this evening I've only got a short scripture reading and and a word of encouragement what the Lord is doing for me and I hope it's an encouragement to you and I hope it helps you because we can be led astray very easily in this world so by the grace of God I do have one song and I'd like but I don't mind to sing this song there is very fitting for me for what I want to speak on tonight well I'm on the love of Jesus so I'm going to join me we'll stand up and we'll sing the song and then after that we'll go into the word these actions children these actions our God is all not quiet he wants actions he [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] can get all solo you can get under it Oh amen what's your standing if we can go to the Book of Daniel chapter 6 my thought is from verse 22 but I'd like to read from verse 20 and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentation alloys unto Daniel and the King spake and he said Daniel Oh Daniel servant of the Living God whom thou serveth continually able to deliver thee from the Lions then Daniel said unto the King all King live forever the key my God had sent his angel and it shocked the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before my innocence II was found in me and also before the Oh King I have done no hurt amen Heavenly Father mighty Lord we just want to give you thanks this evening father Lord we just thank you for all the opportunities that you give us father thank you for your merciful hand upon us Lord as a congregation here in Wellington father we just ask of you to lead us Lord Father and have your way with us this evening father lord thank you Lord that I could stand in front of you today Lord Jesus and share my heart Lord father the word that you only give to me Lord Jesus to share to my loved ones around me here Lord Jesus so far the Lord let it be your way Lord and your wool lot father we just bring this to you in Jesus wonderful name amen brothers and sisters the key word day for me though the key Scripture was my God had sent an angel and it shut the Lions mouths you'll know the story of Daniel Daniel was put into the Lions Den because he was chosen by the king over all the people off of that Kingdom and the the priests or the the princes actually and the presidents of that land didn't agree with what Daniel was doing or saying Daniel was on his knees three times a day in his little room the window facing out to Jerusalem and he prayed to his Lord and they didn't like that so they went to the king and they made a decree that you know people that don't do what we say must get thrown into lion's den and you know what happens if you get thrown to the Lions Den this nothing else to say it's finished but yet we have a man the Lord has used this man in a mighty way yes they threw him into the into the den of the Lions knowing that's it it's finished we don't have to hear from him again we won't hear his prey as a game no one would be following the way he followed it's all done it's finished put ourselves in this situation in this world today we are thee we are gettin kicked from our work colleagues from our families from the people that live around us people that we see out in the street you strange funny people you're going to church on a witness day night you're putting on a Chinese suit or or shining your shoes and combing your hair you know what just relax Saturday night we can go out to the rugby game to the soccer game we can have a few drinks we can go just go dancing or whatever you want so easily come on brother come on mate we can go together it's all good I'll pay for it's all right you know make it so easy fall in a trap this world is made to trap us everything that's out in this world is made to trap us it's like how Daniel was thrown in that trap the line strip everything that we do in our daily walk this snares on the way just laid out just laid out for each one of us but yet the Lord takes us and it just lifts off over the Snee jump over the hurdle jump over this problem at times as human in this flesh we'll make that mistake we might take that wrong road we might argue we might say something to hurt someone some bad seed spread out to somebody and then you sit down for five minutes and open the word or you sit down for five minutes and just meditate on the Lord sit down for five minutes and just want to sing a song of praise it comes back to you and says hey you did this wrong thing ball is in your court what are you gonna do I'll use my situation today the devil is trying this morning I got to work my wife phones me can you please pick up bridge and milk and a few bits and pieces for the home no no no I'm too busy I'm sorting out the stock take I'm preparing for my financially audit I can't do it put the phone down you need to sort it out having an argument my wife and I and I will go by maybe two hours go by Oh something is wrong something is wrong atmosphere is not right for at home sorry my love it's a devil the wife called you to do the normal thing I normally pick up the blade of milk I normally pick up the bits and pieces on my way and sadly today it was a problem that's the devil making a problem so when you come home the atmosphere is not right when you come to church today the atmosphere is not right just a small step a small snail along the way and you stumbled but you came now and you played like nothing happened I didn't say anything I didn't do anything I'm an innocent man no no no we need to see it we need to see where the Lord is pointing us and what he's doing we need to stand on his word Daniel stood on his word he didn't change for no one not for the king not for the president not for the princes three times a day on his knee how many times a day are we on our knees many times a day are we praying how many times a day myself as well I'm not talking to you I'm talking to myself what am i doing so Daniel was in that situation and yet the mighty hand of the Lord has saved him sent his angel to camp around him and that enemy could not devour him or even scratch him not even a scratch you've seen a lion you seen his cross his paws there were three times the size of my hand just one maybe more the weight of it will just push you down you'll just be smashed and one just if he runs through the song we sang this evening the love of Jesus is so wonderful it doesn't stop the way it's too wide and you can't get around it what is asking you is to push through it don't let it be in your way too high too low too big too small he wants us to push through we don't want to be stagnant we don't want to be just standing and receiving all the enemy's tears and thorns he wants us to push through the problems push through the trials push through everything that's in our way because he didn't ask us to just come here and take a Pew you didn't ask us just to come here and you're only going to be a song leader you're only going to be a sound disc operator no he's using each one of us in a different way as I said I'm not a preacher I lean on my brothers I lean on the the people that surround me and your talk to me and share with me and support me and I'm standing here in front of you maybe in things of the normal day-to-day living of my job and everything else I can talk you know the field I'm in I can talk about it was very hard for me to talk about the Lord but the Lord has done something is came and dwelt in my heart and I know he's real I been through a lot of trials in my life but here I stand here in front of you victorious it's provided all my needs and abundantly is kept my family together and it's kept my family strong yes my one daughter is not here with me he's in the Lord's hands she's in the Lord's hands so fighting and shouting and arguing and why you're not coming to church and why you don't want to do this it's all past sort of past you surrender that to the Lord and the Lord will do his work I want to share I want to share a message that brother Branham shed in 1961 in 1961 and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and brother branham god loves to show his mighty hand yes he does he likes to show his power he's waiting tonight to show it in you for each one of you to take that sinner and turn him around to take that woman with ill-fame and changed her to a godly saintly woman or men take that girl that has taken the wrong road or the boy that's taken the wrong road and bring them back to the place and make them sons and daughters of God he's ready to take that man dying with cancer that one with the heart trouble the one that's blind the one that's afflicted if he will just place his faith in day it'll turn him around from death unto life start him start him off with a testimony he's waiting to do it it puts you right in the trap to see what you do so the Lord also puts us in a position where we got no chance to turn left or right but just look up to him if we are going to be in the corner and we stuck what are we doing he puts you there to see what you made of he did that to job in the Bible he did that to other two other priests in the Bible to other prophets in the Bible so he's doing it to you because he has chosen you each one of you you his bride is getting you ready he wants your spotless he wants you clean he wants you with nothing no one can throw a stone at you that's how clean he wants you yes your past is your past but he's cleansing you if teaming you up is making you beautiful it's making you better is bringing it to your stage where you'll be a spotless bride for him that's technology look like nature itself was hiding its face yes one writer one day one writer said one time that when they got into that place wondered what Moses would do our pastor preached on that on Sunday what Moses would do he had one commandment go forward if you are in the line of duty no matter what stays in your way the greatest experience I've ever had is to come up against something I couldn't get over it or under it and just stand there and watch God make the way through it that's the way to do it just keep just move keep moving place your nose against it just keep moving on just keep going on God will make a way that's why I sang that song because the song doesn't stop they just says God will make a way you just go through it he's given us the sword the Lord Jesus has given us a sword maybe it doesn't look sharp but the words are sharp every word will pierce you it'll cut you then he gives us a shield on our left hand to protect the parts that are I still saw from the beating you got before so you've got a shield in your left hand you've got the sword in your right hand who's going to stand in your way push forward go through so brothers and sisters that's my encouragement to you today don't give up take your sword hold up your shield and push through fight this battle like you like you're a young 20 year old fighting this battle fight this battle that you will not give up fight this battle to stand on this word because this word has made us who we are today it's brought us from that muck and mire into where we are now we would never the last place I would have been found is in the house of God out
