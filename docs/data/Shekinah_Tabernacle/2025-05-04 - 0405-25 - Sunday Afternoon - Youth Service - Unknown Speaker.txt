Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, dear Lord, it's such a an a great honor and a privilege to be here, dear Lord Jesus, to be here in your presence, oh Lord, and dear Lord, to minister unto your your children, dearly Father. Dear Lord, I pray that everyone would be touched today, dearly Father, for be well, dear Lord. Or just get a little a small piece out, dearly Father, something to remember, dear Lord Jesus. Dear Lord, may you just come on the scene in a mighty way. And dear heavenly father, um remove me from out of the way, dearly father. And dear Lord Jesus, may you just bless these sermons and bless brother Marion's sermon as well. Dear heavenly father and dear Lord Jesus, dear Lord, may no nervousness or anything get to me. Dearly father, may I just relax in your holy presence, dear Lord Jesus, and just minister your word to the to the greatest of my ability, dearly father, that you've you have placed within me, dear Lord Jesus. I thank you, dear heavenly father, for really just being my portion, dear Lord Jesus, that I can just stand there, dearly father, and be a blessing, dear heavenly father. Dear Lord, for it's not me, it's you, dear Lord Jesus. And I thank you for that, oh Lord. In Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. God bless everybody. You may all have your Oh, just while we stand, let's all turn to um uh John 10:30. So that is John 10:30. And my title for today is Jesus was both man and God. Amen. So he was more than a man. Amen. He was indeed God. Amen. So if we go here to John John 10:30 and it says here in John 10:30, it says, "I and my father are one." Amen. So I and my father are one. Amen. You may you may all have your seats. Amen. I mean I I had a great week this week. I thought I was going to be in the bush on um Friday and Saturday, but we had I I was blessed to be able to work. Amen. It's a good thing. And also while I was working, I actually um the dude doing the carpet was a fellow from Carpet Court, which is a contractor that we sort of work with. And um he was like, "Oh, I heard you've been outreaching to some of these fellows at Carpet Court a while back, and you know, I'm actually a Christian." And I was like, "Oh, wow. I didn't think you were a Christian, but he was." And um yeah, I that was quite nice you know I was because you know I was I was blessed to work but I was a little bit distraught that I wasn't in the bush but still I had a very wonderful Friday. Friday was the my third best day of my life. Um Saturday was my second and today is the first best day of my life. Amen. This is the best day. Amen. Cuz I'm a I'm a day closer to God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So Amen. We're going to Yes. So Jesus was both man and God. Amen. And brother Brandham says here, he says, consider this who was the father of Jesus. Matthew 1:18 says, "She was found with child of the Holy Ghost." But Jesus himself claimed that God was his father. God the Father and God the Holy Ghost, as we often express these terms, make the Father and the Spirit one. Indeed, they are. Or else Jesus had two fathers. Amen. But notice that Jesus said that he and his father were one. Amen. Not two. That makes one God. Amen. So there's not there's not multiple gods. Amen. It's Jesus was God almighty. Amen. And then if we go here to Acts 9 and 3:5 and this is this is Paul when he was journeying into Damascus. And um Paul says here, "And he journeyied, and he came near Damascus, and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven, and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice, saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?" And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." Amen. So here we can see that that Jesus isn't in a um a body of flesh. He is in in the light. Amen. So he he was more than than just a man. Amen. Because he he is here in the light. He's not in a in a body of flesh. Amen. And brother Brandham says here um he says God is in his universe. God is in his word. God is in his son. Now let's see when he was here on earth. You say it was his son. Yes, sir. When he was on earth, he said he was God. He looked like God. He act like God. He healed like God. He died like God. He rose like God. He was God. Was God the Son. And we know that the Son is God manifested in in the flesh. Amen. So So he could redeem what what Adam what Adam had lost. Amen. And like like dad said, God is everywhere and God is God is everything. Amen. But but we see his word manifested in in different places. Amen. Cuz before he was the word, he he was a the thought. Amen. And he becomes tangible when he is manifested. Amen. So we can see God expressed in the flesh as as his son. Amen. And you know, I love how brother Brandham said that indeed there are there there's not no devils in the bush. So when I go into the bush, I just always feel God. Amen. And he is in his creation the same way he was in a body of flesh. Amen. So isn't that that quite like when you touch a tree in the bush, you're just a part of God. Amen. He is in his creation. I always find that so powerful. I love I just truly love that. Amen. And then I'll finish off that quote. And when God the Father came down and dwelt in the Son, Christ Jesus, and they in unity were one, that's what they was. That was God speaking. Amen. So So, so Jesus was was indeed God. He wasn't just a just a man. And you know, I trust we all know the story of that lady and she went to brother Brandham and she she said, "Brother Brandom, I can prove that Jesus was only a man." And he said, "Okay, prove it." And she said, "Um, because he wept when um Lazarus Lazarus died." And Brother Bram said, I believe he called that too shallow. They too shallow of an argument. And um uh he said indeed he did weep like a man, but then he rose Lazarus from the dead and that was God. Amen. And also when when Jesus went and fasted for 40 days and nights and he was hungry like a man. And brother Brandham actually said he was looking through trees to find some food and stuff because he was just so hungry. And but then brother Brandham said, you know, when then he took the two loaves and five little fish and he fed 5,000 and and and that was God. I mean that that was much more than a man. And you know, he he was also a man when he he slept in the ship in the Sea of Galilee. And brother Brandham said it was so the waves are so big that he and but he was so tired that he just slept through the whole thing. But um and then he got up and he said, "Peace be still." And that was, you know, that that was God. That was that was much more than than a man. And now we come here to to our last quote. And this is just before this quote starts. This is about the the woman at the well and Jesus has just told her that she has five husbands and the one she is not one she is with is not her husband. Amen. So, and brother Brandham says here and that startled the woman. She knowed that couldn't be a man. Amen. Because he wasn't a man. He was more than a man. Amen. She knowed he was more than a man. Certainly he was more than a man. He was God. Amen. See this day when they want to make him a prophet, he was God of the prophets. I mean like like um Islam tries to do make him a prophet. Amen. But he he is God of all the prophets. Amen. He was God himself made flesh in a body his own creation that he built himself a tabernacle holy and he lived in it and he walked through it and he talked through it and he expressed himself through that body. Amen. Just like he expresses himself through his creation. Amen. That he might by that one body give it as a sacrifice that he might bring all of us to him as sons and daughters of God that the Holy Spirit can speak through us. Amen. And continue his work, God and his son. Amen. So, if we could have the have the musicians come up. Amen. Um, if we could all stand. Amen. And I'm just going to close the service in a word of prayer. But, um, if anyone if anyone has has a need, you know, you know, there are some things, you know, I didn't understand this until a little while ago. Like my whole life, I've been in church my whole life and I sort of never really you understand but you sort of you sort of don't. But, but now I fully understand it. Amen. And that was quite recent and I was probably Yeah, I was 21. Um, so you know, if we want this revelation, we want to understand these things, if you could just raise your hand to the Lord and just ask because the Lord will reveal himself and Amen. We'll just pray. Dear heavenly father, dear Lord Jesus, I thank you for this blessed time, oh Lord. And dear heavenly father, I pray that dear Lord, if anyone struggles with not understanding some of the things, dearly father, dear Lord, dear Lord, may they just know that you've opened it all up, dely. Dear Lord Jesus, that we can understand, fully grasp everything, de heavenly father, that you've granted unto us, dearly father. Dear Lord, I thank you for this, dear heavenly father. I thank you, dear Lord Jesus, that you're here and you you're dwelling in us, dearly father, and you're expressing yourself through us, dear Lord Jesus. Thank you for that, dearly father. And dear Lord, I just pray that you bless us, dear Lord Jesus. In Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, dude. Amen. [Music] Sing. Now is the time to worship.

Let's just bow our heads this afternoon, Lord Jesus. We thank you, Lord, that we can gather again, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we thank you, Lord, that we can know, Lord Jesus, that the same Jesus that was the same God that was in Jesus, Lord, is the same God in us, Lord, is all the same person, Lord. We thank you for that, Lord. And Lord, I just commit this time into your hands, Lord. I'm insufficient, Lord. I just pray that you'll take over, Lord Jesus, and that you'll just have your way, Lord. We commit it into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Uh let's just uh before you sit, grab our Bibles. And uh yeah, this afternoon, I want to speak on the pill of great price. Um, all right. We'll just start in Matthew 13:44. And uh, the Bible says here again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth, and sellth all that he hath, and buyth that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, who when he hath found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. And then you don't have to turn to it. We'll just we'll just read it. Um says here, "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust." And then lastly before we before we take your seats, uh, Matthew 6, it says here, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and, uh, rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through or steal. For where your treasur is, there will your heart be also." Amen. You can have your seats. Okay. Well, I'll just start with this word value. Um, this is just um I think it's the Miriam Webster dictionary that gives these definitions. So, um the one I really want to look at is just where it says uh value the definition or value relative worth, utility or importance. So, there's obviously monetary value as well um and things like that. So if you buy something, how much that's worth in money and how much you're willing to pay for what you're getting. So it has to be uh in your eyes, it has to be valuable enough that you're willing to give your money for whatever it is. So all right. So and we obviously all have a perception of what is valuable. Like what I think is valuable, you might not think is valuable and vice versa. Um and uh and you know there's many things that we maybe pursue or we like to do it or we like to um uh have a uh ju just do it because it makes us happy or it makes us feel good. It might be for the ladies it might be shopping or whatever whatever they like. And for us for for the blo it might be like building or fishing or whatever the bloss like. So you know we all have a different perception of what is is value right like as human beings like there's it can be many things it can be it could be sports it could be um you know physical things you own it could be riches even your family and those things are valuable but they have you know varying degrees of value and uh yeah and you know the Lord made us a certain way so certain things make us happy and then we we we sort of crave that. I know for me and Dave it's both being in the bush like we both like that. It's uh and for some of these lads here it's might be support. I know you guys really into into that. What? So um but I want to ask this question. Um is our perception of what is valuable the same as the law's perception of what is valuable? So we'll just read this here. It says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayaeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." And uh here in Corinthians, it says, "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is not judged of no man. So you can see it says the natural man um receives not the spirit of God. Like our natural man is not inclined to receive the things of God. Um but because we're spiritual men and women um but we we we we can receive that. So, all right. And in Corinthians a bit further on, it says, "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. And God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen. Yay. And things which are not to bring to not things that are." So you know even though a lot of the things we perceive as value as human beings um are not wrong um we are naturally as human beings inclined to place value on things which the Lord doesn't see as valuable as what we do. So um so let me ask you who is whose perspective is correct? Ours is human beings like me or you individually or God's perspective? Well, it's a bit of a no-brainer really because um God is the creator of the universe. He created this heart that likes certain things. He created your heart that likes certain things. He um he made us in a certain way to be motivated by something or feel happy by it. Um so I mean he made us so so I would definitely say that his perspective um is the right one. So um above what we might think is value and uh you know brother Bam says God wants you to be happy and that the human heart was made to be happy. So so it's it's good it's a good thing for us to be happy. So, you know, if if our natural inclination is not is not to perceive things as value the same as the Lord does, then may the Lord give us the mind of Christ to be able to see things from his perspective and what he considers as valuable. Amen. Uh it says here, "And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God, and let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." Yeah. So um so we have to put on the mind of Christ. So whatever we think is is is is what is value and important, let us put on the mind of Christ and and and take what he considers as valuable. The Bible says, sorry, brother Brandham says that the Bible reveals the mind of Christ. So if we want to know what the mind of Christ is, what does his word say? We've got to look into his word. All right, I'll just read this quote here from brother Brandham. Father God in heaven, this word, how it makes us free and sets us free. the waters of separation. It sets our thinking free. We don't no longer think with our own mind. We just depend on what he said in the word. Can't go wrong. God, uh you is the one who said it. You've separated it. And then if we're separated from our own thoughts, separated from our own ideas, we are lost then in you. And we just believe what you said. No matter how unreasonable it may seem, you are the God of circumstance. you are able to keep that what you have promised. Amen. And just another story that brother Brandon tells, a fellow said he went out into a pasture and caught a pony here the other day. He put around a ro he put the rope around the pony's neck, then made a half hitch across the muzzle of his face and was leading the pony back to the barn. Before he got there, the pony was leading him. That's what it is. So, you know, you caught the horse and the horse didn't want to be caught, but as soon as he was caught, he was so used to going to the barn and he just started leading the guy to the barn. Um, that's what it is. God catches us and we try to lead him. Let him lead. He knows the way. He has traveled the road. He made the road. We don't know the road. So why do we try to reason these things out? Let us just submit ourselves to him. Say, "Lord, you lead me. I'll follow." Amen. Amen. and he knows the way we don't. So, uh, now we're just going to look at some, um, um, examples of people in the Bible that, um, either chose God's perspective of value or their own perspective of what is valuable. So, uh, so you all can see who these two people are. There's the rich young ruler and then there's Moses in Egypt. So, uh, we'll talk about Moses first. He was um in quite a unique situation where he could he could choose to be the ruler of Egypt and have anything that money could buy, all the riches and power that he could ever want, or he could choose to be identified with the slaves and the mudbing people, which to the eyes like especially the eyes of the Egyptian was nothing, was probably um was probably lower than filth, you know, that in their eyes. And the Bible says that Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming their reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. Amen. So that's that's the that's so Moses chose to put his perception of what is valuable aside, and he chose what God saw as valuable instead. And the rich young ruler, I mean, we all know the story. He um he was rich and and he had lots of you know earthly things and he he came to Jesus and asked him how um what he must do to be perfect and Jesus said well go sell your possessions give to the poor and follow me. I don't I don't necessarily think that the Lord asks that of us today like if someone's rich to do that but he knew what that man's that rich man's weakness was and what he would have to do to really sell out and he wasn't willing. The Bible says he went he was sad. The rich young ruler was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions. And we know like brother Aaron says later on he died and he lifted up his eyes in hell. Um so he was not willing to let go of what he thought was value and and accept true value. You know um like we say at the beginning what we have is a pearl of great price. Yeah. So, um this pearl of great price that the Lord has offered us is obviously eternal life. Um, I mean that's one of the big things and not just that but to be able to walk close to him in this life and um walk in, you know, play our part in his kingdom in this life for each one of us. And if we can if we can if we can just perceive what a valuable thing it actually is, it's the most valuable thing there is. And you know, unfortunately, because it's so contrary to the vast um um majority of people, because it's so contrary to a human way of thinking, it's um they miss it completely. And and I mean, look how many people chase riches and this or that, but it's they're missing it. They're missing the point. Um so really thankful that the Lord has obviously revealed it to us. And this pearl of great price, you can't buy it because it's without money without price. You have to just accept it and believe [Music] it. Right? I'll just go down a little side road here. Um it says, "For he that sweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that seweth to the spirit shall of the spirit leap reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary and welloing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not." So uh how can we not be wearing welloing um and not faint if we don't see the value in what we are um well doing if if we don't see the value in what we are um um aiming for you know um so so um yeah I mean like with anything anything in life it's you know the word of God is a seed and we have to keep watering it and keep um keep believing it. And um if we realize the value of the crop that we will that we will um reap at the end of it, we we won't faint. We will and you can apply that to anything where there is something you um um you a giant in your life. Like the giant might not be overcome at once, but we've got to keep watering that seed and believing. Um yeah. Um so just have a look here. Yeah. And um and obviously it's very basic but how do we water and keep believing like we we need to get into his presence um into the presence of God. Not just here at church but at home when we're alone. Uh um praying I think that's one thing some of us don't do enough including myself is praying. Um, you know, brother Arab says prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings. There's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer. Prayer will change the mind of God. Did you know that? Amen. So, uh, yeah. Amen. So, let's water that seed with prayer. Okay. Um and I just want to take a moment and just speak of a few things that um are of value in the eyes of God. So uh we are very valuable in the eyes of God. We are of value in the eyes of God. Um it says in Isaiah, "For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Sa for thee. Since thou was precious in my sight, thou has been honorable and I have loved thee. Therefore will I give men for thee." and people for their life. And this was he said this to natural Israel, but we are spiritual Israel. So I believe it applies to us as well. Um I will say to the north, give up and to the south, keep not back. Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth. Even everyone that is called by my name, for I have created him for my glory. I have formed in him. Yay, I have made him. So I mean that that just shows us that we are valuable in his eyes. It says in Romans, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? And a bit further down it says, for I am persuaded that ne neither death nor life nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. So uh you know if if God values each one of us, each one of us bloodwashed sons and daughters so much, should we not have the same um should we not have the same attitude and view of each other as brothers and sisters? um and and love each other and Yeah. but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another. Amen. All right. Well, another thing that is of great value in the eyes of God is souls. Brother Barham tells a story how he went to a museum. So some time ago down in Tennessee, I was standing in a great museum and I was looking in the glass with some young fellows that was standing next to me and I was showing the chemical worth of 150 lb man. And it might surprise you to know how much you're really worth if you're in good health. A good strong man at 150 worth you're worth 84 cents. Well, you're not worth very much are you? just about enough whitewash to sprinkle a hen's nest, a little bit of calcium and so forth, all weighed up into 84 cents worth of chemicals in your body. Uh, one young at the museum, the one young fellow said to the other, he said, "John, we're not worth very much, are we?" I thought this was a grand opportunity. I laid my hands on each one of the boy's shoulders and I stepped between them and I said, "That's true, son. We're not worth very much in this body, but in that body's got a soul in it worth that is worth 10,000 worlds. But we want we want to take care of this 84 cents. We give it the best of clothes, feed it the best of foods, and put a $10 hat on it. And how we love to take care of this 84 cents and how we love to do things that we think is valuable because it because we enjoy it, but yet our soul is worth so much more. Sorry, a lot of reading this afternoon. But uh uh brother says, "I asked my wife not long ago. I said, I want to ask you something, honey. I said, what is real true um value placed on? I believe I told you that though the other night, what real true value? Nothing but lost souls is the only thing that's got any value in it. Money passes away. Homes decay and go away. Everything in the earth moves away. The only value lasting value I'd rather have one soul in glory that I want to Christ to know and see that the light of God circles around that soul through all eternity. My name to be associated with that than to have every penny of money in the whole earth cuz I'd have to lose it all. But what you send up there is eternal. Amen. Yeah. So, uh, if the Lord places such value on lost souls being saved, may he help us to live a salty life and not be scared to witness when we have an opportunity to witness to lost souls. The Bible says, "They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever." And you know, I often think um uh this opp this what we have, this life that we have is an opportunity. Um as like Andy says, we should look around because we'll never see we'll never experience things as um quite the same as what we do right now on this earth. We won't and it's an opportunity and you know, we can we can invest in in in the life hereafter. And one of the ways is by, you know, just being a witness and allowing the Lord to to to use you to, um, to touch souls. May the Lord help us. Cuz I know for myself, um, I'd rather shy away than speak to people. But, um, I believe he can make us bold like they did like he did them on the day of Pentecost. Um, yeah. So, another thing that um is precious in our eyes, but sorry, in in God's eyes, but not necessarily in our eyes, unless we can see it, um for what it really is, is our trials and testings. So, it says uh Peter says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the pairing of Jesus Christ. So it's much more precious to you than gold even though we don't always feel that way. Um and and obviously those things that we go for through there's a purpose and a reason for them and is it's to produce something of real value in us. And you know the devil tries to keep us preoccupied with what we think is is valuable. um he tries to keep us blind to what is real value um which is the purpose of God being fulfilled in our lives and you know God living through us and it's um it's like brother Ben preached the other day on spiritual amnesia if the devil can just keep you um if he can just keep you um tied up in your mind and not not um Yeah, if he if he can if he can just keep us, you know, in this little world where um I do this because I enjoy it and that's what I do, but actually just take a bigger perspective. Hey, why are we here? Um you know, what is what is actually valuable? What what actually should I be striving for? You know, may he just take that um amnesia, may the Lord take this amnesia off our eyes if any of us, you know, have some of that. And uh yeah, I just want to say, you know, we are the sons and daughters of God. We are the spiritual seed of Abraham and we have a promise to possess the gates of our enemies. And um yeah, may that just be made real to us. So uh I just as I close I just want to um one more thing. So uh just um from the angle again of your perspective and looking at things the right way. So, you know, when when Jesus died on the cross and um and yeah, and he was in the tomb, the disciples from their perspective, everything was lost. It was like everything we hope for and believe is is gone. What what is happening? But they weren't they they weren't aware that the greatest thing that happened in history was unfolding right around them. And it was yeah, it was all it was all because their perspective wasn't what it should be. And I believe on the road to Emmas um the Lord said, "Oh fools and slow of heart, um basically look at it from the right perspective." And uh yeah, so uh yeah, that's all I have for this afternoon. So if we can just bow our heads and pray and um I just want to pray that the Lord will help us to see things from the right perspective and help us to strive for that which is actually value, not what we think is value. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for for your word, Lord Jesus, and for the valuable gift that you gave us, Lord. That pearl of great price, Lord. It's like that man that sold everything he had to buy it. Um if we can just grasp what the the value of what we have, Lord Jesus, how valuable it is, Lord. We'd we' would put it at first in our lives, Lord. And we we just pray that you'll help us to see it for for what it is and just look at things from your perspective, heavenly father. And Lord, may we just lay aside every weight and press towards that mark, the prize of the high calling, Lord, and just lay aside everything that's not important. We just thank you, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. All right, Mo, I don't know if you wanted to come and yeah, leave us in a few songs. Amen. God bless you. Amen. God bless you, Marian. Just sing a couple songs before I pull up for the Ben. Thank you. Let's just stand this thing touched by his fire. She's blinded all my darkness. Mark my heart within his grace and mercy of passion to my [Music] s I'll show you the night I am [Music] Oh my god. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I want free. I'm going to take you by his [Applause] power. [Applause] He's all of my so [Music] to [Music] [Applause] IP [Applause] shused. His holy [Music] fire has changed my life inside of me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot give it. There's only hurting inside of me. I can only keep quiet this morning by inside of me. I've been touched by his fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. Shout it from the rooftops. Shout it till my [Music] eyes. So let the world come sh from the rooftop sh I cannot hold inside. I cannot hold inside. I cannot keep it quiet cuz only inside of me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it only inside of me. I've been searched by his fire. So let the world come and wash me first. Shout it from the rooftops. Shout it to everyone. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lordise. Amen. We just heard God and flesh. Jesus was God and man. And then Marion spoke about value. The Lord, you think God became man. The greatest value, the greatest person to ever walk the face of the earth was him. Right? But yet he put your life at greater value than his own life. That's why he died and purchased your salvation on Calvary. Amen. Aren't you thankful Lord? Because many times we look at ourselves say Lord what values in me? But God says, "No, no, no. You have great value in you. That's why I purchased your redemption that day." Amen. I value you more than my He values himself. Right? So, praise the Lord. I enjoyed both those. Thank you so much. Amen. I was actually looking I don't need to preach on value anymore. I was looking at value because Judas valued the Lord at 30 pieces of silver. That was the value he put on him. So, so he traded him, right? But may we never devalue the Lord. Amen. May his value, may his true value continue to be revealed to us as we walk with him. Praise the Lord. So, I enjoyed the youth service. Thank you so much. Thank you, brother Mo. Thank you, musicians. Appreciate it. Amen. So, let's um bow heads in a word of prayer. You got a couple of songs you want to lead us in. Amen. But praise the Lord. Amen. Gracious father, we thank you, Lord. Just to think, Lord, you the no one else like you, Lord Jesus. The greatest one that there ever will be, ever was, Lord. And yet you saw a joy set before you which was us redeemed, Lord. You put a greater value on our lives than you did your own. That's why you took our sins upon yourself and went to Calvary. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. You fulfilled your own law, Lord Jesus, and redeemed us. You gave your life that we would live. And I pray, Father, may may we uh may you continue to reveal your value to us, Lord, as we behold you, the pearl of great price. Thank you, Lord. You put something in us, Lord Jesus, to see your value, Lord. Thank you, Father. Lord, that we gladly gave it all away. Gave this world away, opportunities away, Lord, that we would we would keep this pearl of great price. Keep you, Lord Jesus. And Father, as we hold your word, which you are, Lord, up to the light, Lord. And Lord, may we look at you and see how great you are. And Father, may you continue to reveal yourself. We love you so much. Thank you. You became a man to redeem us back to yourself. We love you, Lord. We just pray you dismiss us with your blessing now in Jesus Christ's name. Thank you for the service that we had tonight, Lord, this afternoon, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn it to you, bro. Let's just sing one song and then we'll be dismissed. Sing our God is tremendous. [Music] When I'm in need on the Lord and he helps me. Yes, he helps me. He is faithful and true. I forget his own.
