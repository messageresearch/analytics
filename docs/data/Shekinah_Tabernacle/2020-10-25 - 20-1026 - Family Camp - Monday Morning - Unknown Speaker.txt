[Applause] [Music] lord what a blessing it's been and normally when i come to camp you know i'm always ready to you know be instant in season and out of season and i love to sing for the lord for his glory and this time i don't know when it came but i had the song when i by the time i got to camp it was like yep that's the song and then um brother ahmad and brother ed did that skit and it was that scripture and so this is that song of scripture so i trust it blesses you [Music] before i am persuaded neither life nor [Music] death no things yet before [Music] [Music] foreign powers nor things yet to be shall [Music] separate us from our bright groom's love there's nothing no nothing can come in between no [Music] of darkness can hide me away i'm sure that he loves me he lives [Music] that

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] i just want to say a little bit about the song before i sing it because i actually wrote the song about a year ago and i've never sung it before just so it's never worked out and i just believe that it was for this time and just going in line with what has been preached and the burden for the song come for the youth after hearing questions like well i don't really know if there is a god or i don't understand god and it's just a real burden that came upon my heart to write the song you know and jesus came to set the captives free and there can be small things in your life children who you know what a captive is right a cat that's a prisoner and things can change you that are maybe just small things but jesus can set you free of that thing you know and god is real we see him in the resurrection you know we see the we see a seed goes down into the ground and it comes back again and you say well i don't know if god can heal me but yet you see a branch on a tree and the wind blows and that branch breaks and it's hanging down but it doesn't just die and fall off that branch heals itself and it and it grows with that sap around it and now that heel of that wound becomes stronger than it was before and you try to break that branch again it'll break somewhere else because you get stronger jesus came to set the captives free but it seems like everything's a mystery dark clouds build around you and your questioning remember god is revealed in simplicity just walk with him and you will see that jesus came to set the captives free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and said is captive free so don't be down cause you had the victory christ is here living in you and me if you wanna see his power then stay around me the same things he did i am manifesting cause jesus came to said the cat is free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and said this cat they're free so don't be weary with your face to the ground jesus is risen and he's here with us now so lift your eyes and you will see jesus christ is setting his bride free says came to set the captives free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and set this cat free now we can walk in victory what jesus did was for you and me so tell those chains they have been broken jesus paid the price and he gave the toll as he came to set the cap is free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and said this captive free oh jesus came to set the captives free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came to set this cat up free yes jesus came to set this captive free i see jesus christ setting his bride amen [Applause] hallelujah thank you brother amen and next we'll have brother matriarcha naomi um noel lee and annelise gloin brother matching god bless you all this victory ahead brother chris really appreciated the song having the songs been just amazing this game as well as the word like for me the lord has spoken to me and how many people here were going one way then something supernatural happened and never going a different way amen that's my testimony brother that is my testimony i spend a lot of my time in the past looking at the past looking behind me there's no victory in that brothers and sisters no victory in that at all now to all intents and purposes you see a christian standing here and i appreciate what the lord's done for me if you want to know what sort of christian i'm like you ask my wife and you ask my children and i can stand here and tell you now i haven't always been a good man i believe the lord's changed that i believe the lord's done a work in my life and there's so many people here that have helped with this camp there's so many people here i'd love to thank on an individual basis so many people i'd love to say goodbye to we have to leave at 12 to catch the ferry i won't be able to do that but there's one person here who's especially made the effort to serve and to play the piano in church and it's my darling wife who i adore and love so much she's my queen and i'm going to stand here and say that she's now my priority in my life so god bless you saints we're going to sing a little song i hope there's a little wee bit of my throat left from last night we'll give it a go away honey sorry [Music] awesome [Music] ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention i want to introduce to you [Music] in this corner of the good and the right stands a champion [Music] his height exceeds the heavens his weed outweighs the world his reach reaches everywhere his age is ever more he is higher than the highest and greater than the great no one will take his crown away he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns from above he's the old time undisputed undefeated champion of love he left his hometown to enter this arena he raised his hands in victory for me an angry crowd shouted crucifying the king who wore their crown and they gladly watched their champion going down but i will never count him out cause i'm a witness of the day rose to retain the title champion of love he is higher than the highest and greater than the grave no one will take his crown away he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns from above he is higher than the highest and greater than the great no one will take his crown away he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns from above

about that but you get your chance maybe after the service but let's just sing a aquarius before we welcome brother adrian to come up let's sing that song we walk in the light we walk in the light we walk in the lights such a beautiful lights opens where the dew drops [Music] jesus he is the light of the hallelujah he is [Music] of mercies of rights [Music] his name is jesus the world [Music] around them the lord what a wonderful god we serve amen is this microphone operating all right brothers okay praise the lord you know it's just uh wonderful to be in the house of the lord again and feel sorry for the person who's got to preach the last meeting especially after what we have been hearing over the last you know few nights and it's just been a wonderful time and i'd like to take you on a bit of a journey this morning through what has been happening to you from scripture to scripture to scripture so that you can have confidence that god is in control of everything in your life amen because we do not want to have doubts we don't want to have fears coming in that this was some accident at this place that is just some circumstances that you've been blessed everything that you are going through right now has been ordained by god before the foundation of the world he said that every trial that you go through has been ordained before the foundation of the world is that right praise the lord so let's just bow our heads and we'll just start with the word of prayer thank you musicians i really we love you and appreciate you lord jesus we come here this morning lord not to hear from a man lord but to hear from heaven lord god and lord i'm just a man that lord has his weaknesses which is too long to list lord god but i pray that the mighty god lord who ordained everybody here to be in this day would come on the scene lord god and that you would take over the speaker that your lord bring your anointing to the word to bring the dynamics of the scriptures lord into plain view lord god we are so needful of you lord we are a needful people lord we are the woman who is needing the headship of the man and lord we are breaking all the laws though that is in layer deceive because lord we are coming back into the way that you saw us before the foundation of the world lord god a husband and a wife heading back to eden again lord so lord we just pray come and just use um use the speaker and lord have the ears to hear and i pray lord god that any spirit that would interfere this morning will come against it in the name of jesus christ i pray lord god you'll take away all the tiredness lord god because a tiredness lord is something that those spirits use to keep us drowsy and lord not keeping us focused on what you're doing lord so lord we just pray that you will lord and keep us wide awake for we ask us in jesus name amen thank you musicians really appreciate you and i want to say to the wellington fellowship how much we really enjoyed the hospitality that was shown here brother ben brother ben we appreciate you and your wife and all of the brethren of the hospitality was absolutely astounding you know it's just something that is it's an eternal thing going on you know and we have to be aware that we're dealing with eternal beings and so when we come along here we're not just uh looking at brothers and sisters and we we are eternal beings and we need to come and to have a clear understanding of that eternalness that's in every one of us because you know we look at our bodies we see some all different ages of people but you know the prophet of god said that in that soul we are as eternal as what god is eternal and that is that is heavy stuff isn't it we are as eternal as what god is eternal because we came from god but we had to be put in this time dimension this realm that's just falling apart but god purposed us to be here so that that character building can come into expression is that right because you need to have an opposing force so let's not come let's not complain about the opposing forces we say thank you for the opposing forces lord because it's making me what you have ordained me to be is that right praise the lord so uh thank you church and it's just wonderful to see um a representation from around the nation you know brother freddie and the brother ferdi paid me a compliment last night they said brother adrian you have changed that's shrinking in there they're shrinking down over there says oh you've really mellowed man and i took that as a real compliment you know because you know we've all gone through we've all got our histories and and uh complexes from over the years all the the when the trumpet sounds it causes a spiritual war we go into warfare we've got scars but you know this this is your time now amen you young people that's raising up this is your time and uh when we go out of here face the enemy knowing it's your time to hold the sword some of us have been holding the sword for years and years and years and got worn down but we're still holding the sword but now it's your time to come and stand up take the sword and cut through all those 200 million demons that have been loosed against the bride is that right that i've been loosed against you but i've got some sad news for them i look at the end of the bible and the last word is oh amen and that means so be it and that a mean means he's finished so look at the end of the book and what's the book of revelation the book of the unveiling of all things the bible has been unveiled and you have been unveiled god's been unveiled you've been unveiled the book's unveiled everything's unveiled so now we can see everything clearly praise the lord let's just uh turn to if i got this little machine down here we'll stick up something up here let's just have to turn this on we're going to turn to the book of revelation now we want to look at what god has been awakening in us you know it says in jeremiah chapter 29 verse 10 we don't have to read it he says for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you seventy years types what seven church ages i will visit you this was a major prophet declaring to the land that god is going to bring them right back and he says for i know the thoughts that i think towards you he's got greater thoughts towards you than sometimes what you think about yourself is that right we have some pretty bad thoughts about ourselves but god's got greater thoughts about you than what you think about yourself says the lord the thoughts of peace and not evil to give you an expected end an expected end it means expect it to come to its conclusion praise the lord then you shall call upon me what happened last night praise the lord what happened last night and you shall pray unto me and i will hearken unto you he says god's going to listen to you there's going to be a communication that connection and we want to see at the end of the bible how this comes and becomes becomes a reality and script scriptural principles in your life because we look at the bible sometimes and we see these symbols and we don't know what it means but these symbols are becoming expressed now and we will try to build up to this this uh where we come to uh what happens under the unveiling of that word he says then you shall seek me and find me now let's look at these these scriptures book of revelation he says and a voice come out of the throne this is after the lord has been speaking about mystery babylon in revelation 17 and revelations 18 is that right mystery babylon he's just been talking about the who sits on the seven hills he's all just been talking in revelation 18 about all the commerce and all the economics being controlled amen now he's going to he's he's showing all that's going to be on the earth in the political economic and religious realm but now he comes to show you a woman connected to a throne and a voice come out of the throne not the voices not voices a voice saying praise our god all ye servants and you that pharaoh both small and great and i heard as it was a voice of a great multitude he says a voice advocate multitude he didn't say voices of a great multitude he says a voice one voice reflected through a multitude connected to the one who has the inspiration giving it out a multitude of people with one voice not someone saying this one saying this one saying this and one saying then i think this and i think that one inspiration saying was a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and be sad and don't say that in my bible and rejoice and give him honor for the marriage of the lamb not has come is this big difference and his wife made herself ready last night come on now what's been going on his wife has made herself ready she's found things in her life that wasn't right so she laid it at his feet he came took it away and said you had to desire it first before he could take it away amen when you come to god be transparent before god because there's nothing worse than that than a woman that's holding things in a heart you're not going to get at that part with that part that's why he preached doors inside of doors you open up the door he came into your into your house but these little rooms are going to be opened up praise the lord they got opened up last night and to her was grounded that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints praise the lord let's be our heads lord take these words now i pray lord god i just pray lord god i just thank you for this time that we've had but lord i just pray sow it all together lord and and just make it so real to us i ask in jesus name amen you may be seated you know uh when i this is the first time in 20 years i have ever gone and had and preached on not outside of a ministry outside of missionary meetings with other ministers over the last 20 years i refused to preach with other ministers but because of brother freddie and brother tez they are men of great character and i did not want to go and be with people who try to compete with each other because there's one thing that competition and is competition comes from the pizza hell competition is an invention of the devil and i saw great character in these men i said yeah lord i can i could preach with those two men because i've seen what god has done in their lives and i so very much appreciate them and may the lord bless them now brother branham says we're going we're going to start shallow and i'm going to get go deep so don't panic because that's just the way i start out now watch this quote i will watch this scripture now this is david and david is expressing something in his heart that is prophetic because the prophet of god says david is the type of church coming into power he's also son of david is the type of christ in the millennium but we take our types for us it says deep carth unto the deep that sounds like to omnipotence an omnipotent god calling out to an omnipotent attribute is that right that's you at the noise of thy water spout what's it that's an overflowing uh it's it's like a fountain of inspiration and faith all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me like last night now let's just look at this quote and then we're going to get into it before there can be a creation there has to be a creator to create the creation he said is that right if you're hungering for god to be healed there's a creator somewhere creating that desire in your heart it's like these things that you came up for last night you had a desire there to be changed who put that in you god put it in you so if god put it inside of you then there's something inside of you responding back to god you put the desire there praise the lord and he says as long as you believe there's a god that'll heal you there's a god somewhere that'll heal you that's right david said as the noise of thy waterspout you see the deep calling to the deep oh i say praise god what a subject where it can go now brother says now he alludes to to a fish says hair like this before there was ever a fin on a fish a fish's back there had to be water first for this for him to swim in or he wouldn't have no fin amen so now god puts an attribute in us that's calling for the place the attribute was made to occupy amen so eternity calls us because eternity is our natural place of existence new zealand's not my natural place of existence eternity is my natural place of existence and it's calling me to my natural place of existence praise the lord that place is not complete without you praise the lord amen god is not complete without you so he's calling out for his completion in you are you with me now so there's a deep on one end and a deep on the other end and each is responding to the needs of the other so god has needs you have needs those two needs have been calling out to each other is that right now god loves worship not just just any kind of worship but there's a there's a different kind of worship because worship must be connected to something you can't just have any kind of worship because pentecostals have a worship god says no the methodists have a worship god says no because i want a certain kind of worship because this worship must be connected to me for what i'm doing now [Music] amen praise the lord now that big calls you to achieve worship to bring you to reflect the desire of god for your day amen because this that is is our true place of expression our place of representation now brother rem says thou now true worship is where he places his name now people say well what is this you know that everybody says well oh the name of the lord is jesus christ so the methodists think that pertains to them let's look now let's see if i got on a slide here this is what he says the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of god this is deep now think deep the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god amen it says flesh and blood hath not real this revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it this to you who i am and upon this rock i'll build my place of worship where where the word has been interpreted and the prophet god said how does god interpret his word by bringing it to pass so come on now put your thinking caps on if his word has to be interpreted he has to bring it to pass so therefore there's somebody who has to be the interpretation of the word for this day that god must go out and bring them to pass amen you still didn't get it you still didn't get it but we'll get there but we'll just go a little bit further he says and the gates of hal can't shake it down right he says the word interpreted as a manifestation of the name of jesus christ so now the word interpreted is not just finding out what something means because when the word interprets it must collect the recipients to bring that scripture to pass amen now do you get it so god has to have a bride at the end time to be the interpretation of the word for this day now mama eagle must go out and hunt down where's my interpretation amen i'm hunting down where's my interpretation i'm going to defend that with that woman and i'm going to bring her to pass i'm going to break the seal over her life she's going to interpret the word where and that is where my name is do you get it you are an interpretation for the scriptures for this day god has sought and god wants it to bring you to pass so god puts on his king theophany veil was this melchizedek coming to search out a part of himself to draw to be the interpretation of revelations 10 verse 8 to 11. a people with a voice of god a multitude of people connected to one voice a voice of the resurrection you have resurrection power inside of you right now you are the throne of mercy right now but the throne of mercy must have a voice amen because this world is falling apart the lack of what love divine love and where can you get divine love you have to go where god is to find divine love and where is god in this hour he's not somebody just sitting on the throne up there that's so impersonal there is a person to connect with to connect to the throne of god and that person has a voice and that person has a voice and that person is the voice and that person is the voice and that person is the voice and they're all saying the same thing because it's a resurrection voice and that voice must be in unity to bring a resurrection the voice must be in unity the whole rapture is depending on a people saying the same thing because there are people beyond the curtain of time under expectation that there will be a people here under one voice one unity one one thought one revelation and it's creating an attraction do you believe it when brother man went beyond the curtain of time he says to them up there says do i have to go back he said you've got to go back he didn't want to go back no way he had to go back because if he didn't go back there wouldn't be a channel to open the book they knew more about what brother branham's ministry was than what brother branham did amen he said where's the lord they told him he said a little bit higher they knew what more about things there than what brother bradham did and they knew he had to go back because a book had to be unfolded to come down and and break the seal over your lives to take you out of the earthly up into the heavenly because you you may have been born in a chook house but i tell you something brethren there was not a chocolate nature inside of your soul amen he had to find that attribute and bring it into expression praise the lord oh my i'm off my notes i have to try and get myself back on the notes now in the sermon i think i might have a quote here let's have a look at this we're just going to go and just laying this out so we understand clearly now watch this the threefold revelation of god christ the mystery of god revealed the crisis the mystery of god revealed is is the prophet telling you what the seventh seal is amen i hope you understand i hope you've been reading it now just before he goes into 335 he says and what is it the holy ghost said i'll point him out that's the only way you'll know him today and only way you'll get the threefold revelation of god is for the holy ghost and the only way it can ever be is you're predestinated to see it i want to ask you who sees it what is the threefold revelation god revealing himself getting the preeminences over the people and taking them back to eden again is that right do you see it put up your hands if you see it but then he says you're predestinated wow so why am i frightened of things why am i intimidated i have been given the privilege of seeing the threefold revelation of god that no other age has ever been able to see and only the holy spirit could point it out to you and identify it to you so that you could say yeah i agree with that and that is god calling you to see a part of your reality is that right now watch now just building this up the three fold purpose the seventh seal just read this oh if god can get prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence as you see he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ what was happening last night you're saying i've had enough for running my own life i'm giving preeminences to the lord why are you getting caught up into the manifestation of the second fold of the rapture amen because this body can only change around the word that is being revealed is that right now stay awake now because we're going to get right right into it you see what a main congregation says amen right says the first to express himself completely god in christ second to have preeminence was by this inner church which is his body the bride until he could have preeminences to express himself through them so we needed to be unblocked is that right the channels had to be unblocked we have some stuff inside us that god comes up i'm going to unblock that last night what's he's unblocking it because the holy spirit must have a free flow amen now watch now he says and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position and we know that adoption on this side is going to take us to adoption the fullness of adoption the change of a body so he's positionally placing us so that he can trust us because he has to trust people to be his voice the devil don't want that he's a zen man so i can disturb that voice part if i can disturb that second fold part of the rapture because he knows if he could disturb that second fold part of the rapture he's got everything just delayed but the inevitable's coming this guy said i'll bring you to an expected end case closed so i can be happy and smile he's coming to an end amen praise the lord right now the threefold mystery was not for luther's day was not for wesley's day was not for pentecost day that's just a shuck but this wheat must have a threefold revelation before it can be taken into the barn so when that shark when that wheat leaves that shark and thus when the seals were revealed that wheat got expelled from laodicea and then it comes out green and it gets baked in the rising of the sun and then it comes to a place where god can use it and take it away and store it in the barn in an eternal dimension now when god sends a messenger we always say praise god we can see his position but he is there he is but he's there to show us our position the messenger was only the channel for the first fold of the rapture amen so he comes and shows us our genetic connection to god the bloodline oh i love this stuff the bloodline the bloodline contains the genetics amen eliezer had his position but he came to rebecca to reveal her position he came to reveal the mystery of her life because isaac could only marry one of the same bloodline so he was when eliezer came when brother branham came he was searching for the connections to that bloodline praise the lord he couldn't find it no chuck house until he looked at an eagle that was trapped down there but inside that eagle was a connection to the bloodline and he says when you heard from that you heard from your theophany years ago brother richard oliver gave me a tape a brother branham on it and i just put it into the cassette recorder and i listened to about a few seconds and i got the shock of my life i said i've heard that voice before not the kentuckian voice but there was another voice on that voice i said i've heard that voice before [Applause] way back in eternity i heard that voice and that voice came to connect me to the bloodline and then for the next few years my goodness me i was put on the threshing floor the threshing floor is in the book of ruth is that right you decide is that right ruth decided then she labored she had a long hair long dresses got rid of a long face she came into connection with the chief reaper and she was feeding on the on the on the word until some mysteries were where we're breaking all around her and then she goes and she meets boaz and when she comes to chapter three she goes and meets boaz on the threshing floor now god puts things in the bible for a specific purpose because the threshing floor is not so we were oh this is a nice place to sleep look there's some hay down there oh let's just go and lie down comfortable it's not about that because on the threshing floor boaz said i'm going to complete everything for you ruth you rest is that right god's doing the work he'll complete the whole thing but you're on the threshing floor and on the threshing floor god was getting rid of ruth chaff oh my god he was getting rid of some south african chaff [Applause] some new zealand chaff he was getting rid of our chaff he was getting rid of her mower bike chaff because of that was not her identification so he had to get rid of her old identity by putting on the thrashing floor and getting rid of the chaff why when you think of yourself as a new zealander don't look at your stupid chaff you're trying to stick your child back on get some chaff glue it back on that's not that's not what he's doing man he's taking it off when at the time when the rapture's been revealed because that's the second part of the rapture now is that right on the threshing floor to connect you to the voice that came down from heaven praise the lord now this deep deep in isaac was calling for the deep in rebecca in rebecca and the seventh seal was breaking over rebecca to pull her from the earthly to the heavenly so i want you to come up higher now rebecca i want you to just come up a little bit higher and a little bit higher and you'll be coming up higher and higher on a seven step higher all the way up and and another dimensions breaking over you there's a dawning of another day you find out oh man this this every time you look at this this cosmos out there this world order you get more sicker and sicker looking at it what's that that's the dawning of a new day an eternal day is breaking over you i could care less who's in power he cares god's in control do you believe it i say pray this this shocks everyone when i say it shocked people in europe so if it shocks people i see it i'm so thankful for satan's eden says a crazy man i am crazy i've lost my mind he's lost his mind yes i have i've got his mind praise the lord satan's eden i thank god for it because i have to be developed in a dark room is that right my negative has to be developed in a dark dark room because when brother brandon preached that there was no digital cameras wasn't all these people you couldn't do that cost too much money bring them back please and take the telephones off them too but anyway you have to be developed and that satan's eaten and satan says i've got them now i says no you ain't i just put them down here i put my attribute down here amongst hell not in hell amongst hell and i'm working out a secret program in a secret place is that right brother ferdi a secret place there right brother that's what a secret place and satan can't see it happening because it's private it's a secret only known between you and god and when i'm down here and i'm walking around in satan's eden there's been things coming across my path to expose things in my genetics and god says i don't want that there so you bring it to the rising of the sun and he burns it out and also develops the picture amen i'll give you a little test testimony i'm unfortunately in my flesh at nearly 63 years old horrors upon horus but only three weeks ago i overcame something within my natural genetics had been going through from generations and i've been praying about it and praying about it it was taunting me for all my life i said lord i can't carry on with that thing taunting me and i'd go and i'd walk up and down the road at night up and down up and down sometimes two o'clock in the morning my wife would probably didn't even know that i was out there praying up and down the road i'd be on the concrete on my face get rid of this thing and the other day i realized it ain't there he didn't say he'd take it straight away that's why when i was in here last night watching all these people coming up and getting delivered i was saying praise the lord when i saw these little ones down here with their hands up praising praising god i thought wow man god is so powerful everything that the devil thought he could hold back god said i'll bring you to your expected ends amen praise the lord let's go deeper oh my when i say deeper they go don't worry so when eliezer was sent by abraham to find a bride for isaac he went out searching for a genetic connection and that genetic connection responded back is that right eliezer was carrying his master's goods he had six earthly seals and a heavenly seventh seal he was carrying his master's goods so that he could show you your earthly your earthly lineage and then show you your supernatural lineage and you were always walking around with a six-seal lineage is that right so then god said now i'm going to reveal the other part and that part's got nothing to do with the earth because eliezer was carrying the goods now his master's goods to impart to a woman amen now she didn't let her earthly book of life control her this is your earthly book of life now come on now this is your earthly book of life but you have an eternal section and the book of life and this here is the lamb's book and the lab's book speaks greater things is that right see she alleged and she she didn't say i'm a modern woman amen she didn't say i need my job first what is it guys quiet i want to say i have my ambitions i've got my rights i wonder what gender i should be i think i should go out and protest i shocked one man one day when i was overseas he's out on the streets protesting about wearing masks i said boy what do you think you are doing jesus said if this kingdom was mine my disciples would fight for me so what are you doing out on the streets fighting for something that you're not meant to be inheriting is that right i'm not interested what the serpent said out there once they're just squatters the squad is brethren they're squatters are temporary inhabitants so that don't mean much to me they haven't even paid 6 000 years of rent to me you don't pay rent you're getting evicted i've got a title deed that says you ain't been paying rent praise the lord oh you're an eccentric man i am i just want to be i wanted it's where the rubber meets the road you know praise the lord she didn't reason with the messenger she didn't find faults with the messenger she didn't go on the websites to find things about the messenger that she didn't think that was uh you know what i mean the messenger messenger carried a familiar voice the deep code unto the deep and the waterspouts of inspiration was responding and he says it's faith praise the lord so eliezer came searching for a common bloodline that was connected to rebecca's future husband the bloodline to the same bloodline so when god sent out the messenger with the message at the end time god was awakening us to our supernatural bloodline and the prophet said that when jesus went to calvary we were in him let's do you believe it well he showed me in the old testament amen it's got to be in the old testament was jesus our high priest then aaron was a high priest so if jesus is our high priest and we were in him when he went to calvary i want to see it in the old testament did you know that when that high priest went into the holy of holies he had to be dressed a certain way he had a mitre on his head he fought he had the breastplate he had the euro of summon and he had some bowels on the bottom of his uh um the robe that he was wearing and he had to go into that once a year with the blood to atone for all the people for everything they've done over a whole year is that right so jesus now remember they had to be done every year but jesus did it once for us all is that right once finished done for he was our sin offering he was our burnt offering here was our trespass offering he was all the offerings and one man he only had to do it once but in the old testament it was over and over and over and over and over so when aaron had to go in on the feast of atonement he took and put over his heart a breastplate with seven stones in the breastplate that right underneath the breastplate was the urim thumb and with the names on it now those stones had names on the stones and he was they were the names over the heart of the high priest so when he went and he atoned for the people he atoned for every name over his heart praise the lord when jesus went to calvary a time for every name in the book that was written at his heart so when we when he went to calvary we were there in him now when that high priest he put seven looks of blood on the uh mercy seat and we know that time's when jesus went into and went up in the cloud and he put seven licks over he went with uh he went for seven church ages the holy spirit pulled out for seven church ages which is the life of the blood now that blood had to have a voice amen a searching voice and when every any messenger came out for their age they had a voice of the blood where is the other end to the bloodline searching searching searching for a part of himself praise the lord but you know that high priest he had an onyx stone on his shoulder here and an onyx stone on his shoulder here six names here and six tribal names here oh what a deep mystery are you ready the government shall be upon his shoulders [Applause] of the names in the book for seven church ages the government was given to the body as long as the head was controlling the body it was going to be righteous judgment amen praise the lord and he jesus went to calvary with us in him for the joy that was set before him come on now stay awake have we got to the heavy material yet now he went there knowing his attributes were going to be put into sex-born bodies is that right he knew it and allotted through a period of time he did not intend any of you here to be born in the f-1500 says i have an attribute in me i have all these attributes in me and i must place them strategically i cannot place uh the ones in luther's day in this day because they haven't got that which i put in that attribute for that time they had to be an attribute with the instilled characteristics in it for the age apostle paul wanted to live in this day but but the lord says no so he made apostle paul the pattern for the church ages of every minister of every star of every uh church age messenger and everybody that has that that is used by god and that um ministry has to be in the same expression as what paul was displaying amen praise the lord now here we are born in this world with amnesia amen didn't know nothing were you expecting god to call you no not when i've been just been milking cows minding my own business milking cows so i just call myself a farmer but god was searching me out but i was born with amnesia and how do i come into the world with amnesia i came into the world i was affected by a whole bunch of lineage all the way back now think about this brothers and sisters i'm just digressing now god fills all time and space with his knowledge not his presence otherwise the devil would be born again all time and space with his knowledge so when he's looking all through down the ions of time now catch this you have a theophany which is the real you the real word body your soul goes into is that right but god who is so enormous in his knowledge he knows you must look like that amen so he goes all the way back for hundreds of years mixing lineages connecting this with this this with this this with this this with this until you come out in your day and what when you're the age of 20 you look like that without the warts it's the greatest weight loss program they have to pay for things have been paid for you at calvary amen praise the lord you know brother man went beyond the curtain of time and then he sees her hope there guess what she's got the same color here and the same black eyes she had before she went there she's exactly the same so your stature and it's uh un defiled state is there waiting and trying to connect to you now this way says you're bumping into angels and theophanies is just another expression of it's not angels with wings now the word angel means masses of different things you are you are bumping into angels that's another subject i don't want to want to go into now the expectation is not on your behalf the expectation is god's expectation is that right so when you came into this world born with amnesia the expectation was god's you did not know anything about that you were chosen but god must go and maneuver you to a certain place and then start to get you to look at familiar things things that you did not know about way back in eternity but there's something in your soul it's registering with something and he says keep looking and keep looking now the expectation is the lord's expectation you ain't got enough expectation for nothing sometimes but it's the lord's expectation it was the lord's expectation for the prodigal son it was the lord's expectation for that soldier boy is that right you know the one about the soldier boy god was pointing out the the soldiers were pointing him to a tank on the hill and he looked and he looked and he start walking at what he was looking at and then the father came out so i knew you'd come back i knew you'd come back they're right don't matter how bad is i knew you'd come back praise the lord let's go deeper praise the lord now inside of a woman is a facility that awakens her that's why you men have got to be careful how you speak to women because women attracted by words you can say you're so beautiful and she falls in love help the sisters a man looks and is attracted by what he looks at a woman is attracted by what she hears is that right so faith comes by hearing oh i'm in love i'm hearing something from another dimension i'm falling in love with what i'm hearing because i'm attracted to what i hear and then he says something echoes inside of you is that what he said about the ego there's something echoed inside of him when he heard that voice it was an echo inside of him because an echo is something reflecting as rebounding off something now listen to this i want to get about when and angelic visitations are you with me so far now okay this is it's going to grip it's going to grip when gabriel came to mary he came to show her her position is that right so gabriel doesn't say oh well you're a nice girl i'm going to uh you have to be the one you know he doesn't do that he goes and shows her her place in the scriptures and angel always brings you back to your scriptural representation now when she saw her scriptural representation what happened to her a seal broke over her life and then she got lifted up into a higher expectation is that right and it's what god's been doing with us and so and so when when he when he came to her he came to break the seal over her book of life and show her name in the book and that what happened to her her voice responded back be it unto me is that right her prophetic identity on one hand had to be connected with the realization on the other end though these things that are going on there's a season for it he must draw the person and the prophecy together now when gabriel came to daniel he came to show him his position and connect him to the prophetic fulfillment of his day there right because daniel was looking in the prophecy of jeremiah and he was not understanding everything going on so god had to send an angel to daniel to give him the understanding what was in jeremiah's message books oh my my wake them up lord so there it was and he was stirred he was looking in the message box we've only got two years left amen so angel had to come and settle him down and ground him and who he was and the part of the prophecy and then daniel entered into a prayer time and the understanding started to break all over him and the time of the evening sacrifice my oh wow what does that mean what does that mean where are we my friends we are in a strategic time and god is a god that keeps his appointments and he's connecting you to the reality of what's unfolding in the scriptures right now now i want to show you what is happening right now it's why the devil always attacks me so much i've got to shut that guy up seeing a few mom send another million demons to shut the guy up the evening sacrifice is the key to what is happening right now now if we can understand this all things connect together at a time called the evening sacrifice yes now strategic now now put our thinking caps on the old testament is this type of the is a shadow of the new is that right brothers and sisters in the old testament there was a morning sacrifice and there was an evening sacrifice a sacrifice of a lamb in the morning and a sacrifice of a lamb in the evening to atone for the sins of that day every day 11 in the morning and a lamb in the evening in the old testament i tell you something there must been a lot of lambs around so now that was just covering sin in the old testament now that sin needed someone to come and remit it completely following types so when jesus came he had to follow the types it was in the old testament he can't get out of the types amen praise the lord now the morning sacrifice was at the third hour of the day nine o'clock the evening sacrifice was at the ninth hour of the day three o'clock so alam had to be slaying at nine o'clock and another one at three o'clock to atone for the sins of the people for that day in the old testament now when jesus comes along he's the lamb who will take away the sins of the world and he's won them and he must be crucified at the third hour of the day nine o'clock and he dies at the sixth era of the at the ninth era of the day three o'clock so he's a lamb who was the morning sacrifice and the lamb that was the evening sacrifice is that right praise the lord now these are just keys to where we are now amen oh it's good that you're waking up amen now these are shadows because this day completes everything shadows blended to reality because the life of the blood is the spirit of god praise the lord so now the holy spirit the life of the blood had to now go out and interpret itself scriptures for acts chapter 1 and 2. joel needed interpreting amen so the holy ghost goes out where's my interpretation amen come on now where's my interpretation so he goes and searches where's my interpretation and there's only 120 left in the upper room amen left here's my interpretation here comes the holy ghost to vindicate his interpretation i have brought them to pass and when the holy ghost falls peter points him back to joel you are that being interpreted the lord but there's another sacrifice there's an evening sacrifice seven church ages later so in that when jesus went to calvary it was paid for the redemption of our souls is that right but we need the redemption of our bodies so there must be another sacrifice another type i'm talking about now okay you're with me now we know that the seed had to go into the ground for seven church ages eaten up by uh by a roman spirit the church ages and a seed cannot if it doesn't go into the ground it doesn't it's got to to go into the ground and then come up again under luther and wesley and pentecost under that reformation but he says i shall restore all things not some things at the time of the evening time sacrifice message amen so a lamb in the morning to redeem the soul a lamb in the evening to redeem our bodies and it's the same lamb different offices you're with me praise the lord now here comes eliezer going down in genesis to a little woman who's coming to water camels at the well when does she come down in the evening time amen and she don't know she's got an appointment with the seal breaking over her book of life praise the lord genesis chapter 24 verse 11 and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of the evening the time that women go out to draw water are we drawing water brethren amen this is water drawing time praise the lord the message came in evening time there shall be light in the evening time and the evening time is when the woman draws water from the well himself not for some dirty old system amen some message churches have turned into a bunch of dirty old systems it's the truth i'll just give you a little bit of a testimony just for a moment oh my goodness having a god forever here i got invited to preach somewhere if i sit in a certain country and i've just been taking a meeting and of course after a meeting i've just worn out man and this fella comes up to me and says i like to pay your air tickets and your wife's air tickets to come to uh our country and preach now after a meeting i'm just not there in my head very well i'm just worn out and but see even though i'm worn out my head my eagle eye is real sharp it's a real sharp man and i looked and and i thought look i'll call you back in three days i'm just not in the right frame of mind but i was looking at him minister in the message i just won't tell you what nation it was it could be anywhere over the last 10 years but i looked at his clothes he was so flesh i nearly needed to wear arc welding glasses because of the sheen that was coming off of it he was so delicately attired and here's me on my cheek jacket and i'm going god so i flapped my wings and had a look at his wife and she was dressed like a lamborghini i thought man there's something wrong here so i was flying around and having a good look so i can't go there i find out he believes that he's in the millennium right now and i'm flying around something's wrong something's wrong he believes his body's already glorified and he's in the millennium well you know if somebody comes up to me and tells me this i say have you had a cold lately where does a cold come from a demon well in the millennium satan's bound down for a thousand years so if you've got a cold you ain't in the millennium mate use your logic i've got the quotes i've got the quotes i've got proposed yet but i've got the revelation amen come on now i'm not so stupid to put those quotes and say i'm in the millennium right now sure we're under a millennial anointing but we ain't in the millennium yet amen come on man i use my gentle persuasion to say no i really can't come at the moment thank you very much i have to go back to new zealand sometime in the future i didn't tell him exactly i just tried to get out of it now watch now the time of the the evening time feast now watch in john chapter 7 verse 37 and the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink now where did jesus say that it wasn't at the feast of passover it wasn't at the feast of pentecost it was at the feast of tabernacles and we are in that feast right now and that feast of tabernacles is a feast that takes you to a change of your body amen in the evening time and here he puts it puts it in the book of john and john is an eagle and john is under an anointing and he he's he's a john's writing it and he's putting it it's in an eagle book to show the people get your eagle eyes on what's happening all around you scriptures are being fulfilled amen now this part is real good amen this is real good what's coming up now if i say it's real good man when i saw it i thought praise god i preached this in south africa let's have a look at something here now everything has a prophetic bar on it if you go to a railway line there's a bar do not go over the railway line otherwise you'll end up in hospital having clint hit a train see where there's a train coming there's a bar there and when the train goes through bar goes up you can go over in the bible there's a prophetic bar from genesis to revelation and when god fulfills something the bar comes up there's another part there's not fulfilled yet the bar comes down when it's getting fulfilled the bar comes up amen jesus could not come out of the grave until after three days because there was a prophetic bar and the scripture says that said he'll be in the grave for three days and three nights is that right he cannot come out to fulfill the next part of the scriptures because there's a bar there but when those days were fulfilled up comes the bar next comes pentecost amen prophetic bar now and the church ages they were praying for rapture did you know that they wanted a rapture the pentecostals thought this is the time of the rapture but there's a bar there and i'm wanting a rapture wanting a rapture he says he can't so there's a bar there because there must be a former rain come first to bring a teaching before there can be a letter rain and a four marine come together to bring a body change and so they are thinking this is the time of the rapture but the bar was still up because brother branham hadn't come he can't proceed any further pentecostals until you accept what i put in the scriptures they say that they're speaking in tongues with this and this and the synthesis is trying to bring this prophecy to past can't there's a bar there but when a prophet came and brought a former rain something started to happen to the bar amen it started to come up it didn't come up don't come up that way you ever seen one at the railway station do that it doesn't come out it comes out gradually now they were praying in the church ages for things that is for our day god said no no no no no but they prayed and those prayers got held in a certain place they got held god didn't say i don't want to hear those prayers they were held in a certain place waiting for a bar to lift amen now watch i'll show you some pictures that i put in south africa so they could understand oh no it's that's not the one right watch now there is a bar of prophecy if you can get this brethren it's all over revelations 5 8 the book's not open yet it wasn't open to revelations 10. and he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints not all the saints then say all the saints said off so that means it's waiting for something the bar's down waiting for the evening time sacrifice and evening time sacrifice comes into its fullness when the lamb the same lamb that i feel at calvary takes the bulk and then breaks the seals over you and then something happens to those prayers let's have a look now in the bible when you see the word incense it's always offered up at a certain time in revelations 8 which is the seventh seal it was the offering up of incense time at evening time now watch the evening sacrifice arrives all your prayers are loosed and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for a space over half an hour but guess what not on the earth there was a mighty racket on the earth but there's a silence in heaven and i saw seven angels which had stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel come and stood at the altar heavy a golden sense and there was given unto much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints no more bar to your prayers what you ask for it's the time to receive at all praise the lord no more barriers to your prayers in this day anyone that your family needs to come and there's no barrier to anything where the word is being interpreted in your lives praise the lord are you with me this is the most amazing time that we are in we are connected to the evening sacrifice and god says now speak what you want there's no more barriers to that woman [Music] praise the lord what a time amen praise the lord this is the time of uniting under that revelation it's just a just a few more minutes i'm actually trying to get this through this because as you know some of my sermons are 350 to 400 slides long but i only go for sometimes one or two or three slides because you just get burnt out i'll tell you something you'd be on a pension before the service was over now the full understanding comes at the evening sacrifice amen the evening time lamb draws us in the consciousness of our place of prophecy and prophecy it unites us it connects us it takes away the fear and it takes away the doubts praise the lord what's been going on in these meetings what was that brother the tester brother preaching no no no no no no it was the angel himself amen a visitation from an angel you've got to be sensitive to these things my friends now look at the rapture time the evening staff was sacrificed and tight was when lazarus now in the in john chapter 10 or 11 i think it was lazarus had died amen seven church ages lazarus was the people in the seven church ages that had died but there had to be some people alive and remaining at the end time to come into a unity of the revelation so that lazarus could come back and be united with him with the lord is that right praise the lord so there were saints that were alive and remaining and one was mary and one was martha and there was one sister she was full on man another i gotta have dinner man but martha went out and jesus was coming back and she went out to where jesus was amen and he was coming to bring a resurrection but mary was a dilatory she's like you know somebody that's just falling asleep in church right now see i'll tell you something you don't sleep in front of me mary was dilatory now look turn to john chapter 11 verse 20 you can write these things down verse 20. then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming is that right went out and met him but mary was still in the house so she so she met where he was but mary mother had to be in a union for the resurrection of lazarus same voice oh my god oh my goodness me you don't know what's happening up here the same voice in a union saying the same thing see mama eagle must go out and awaken that girl to her fulfillment of the prophecy for the day verse 11. and when she had said so said she went out and called for mary a sister secretly none in public amen the master cometh and caught us for thee and as soon as she heard she arose and came unto him he was calling for her calm connect the bar's been lifted girl not where he was but where he is he interprets his word by bringing it to pass he brings you to pass he awakens you making you aware an eaglet must have an equal perspective praise the lord when an eagle looks at something it does not see obstacles [Applause] oh that was that was free i said to my sunday school what does the stars do they go twinkle twinkle little star what is making a star twinkle obstacles in the atmosphere but when an eagle looks it don't see no twinkle it sees the star in its purity because an eagle can sort out the obstacles when it looks at something but some eagles are down here moping down and another eagle must come down with some food to the moping eagle to say come on feed on this and get back up here amen this is not the time for moping eagles you are a people of prophecy you're the most important people on this earth the bar's been lifted the deepest calling to the deep praise the lord what a glorious time forget about your book of life this is only the thing i'll meet you in the secret place of revelation and david he said i'll make a tent for the ark i'll make it and a myself was starting and that secret place is that right praise the lord amen we'll end up on this what is it let's turn to um acts chapter three let me finish up on this oh my goodness oh lord bring me a new body quick now jesus don't put something in the bible just say oh i've got a space here i'll put some names in it you don't do that he had a space filler when god writes something he's of few words you need to be in the love letter to see what he's saying so god brings down the holy ghost divine love you fall in love say oh well that's what that means yeah look now watch this moses was commanded to make an image of a temple of out of the sorry to make a temple out of the vision he saw in heaven is that right so moses got a holy advent would be bazool to do the work according to moses vision so that moses saw it spoke it out these fellows built this tabernacle in the wilderness but the tabernacle in the wilderness was something had to be moved constantly but after a period of time david wants to go and build the tabernacle but god says no you've shed a lot of blood but you can get all the cedar woods and everything and everything are ready to make this temple but you ain't gonna do nothing because you said you've actually uh we need a man of peace here amen amount of peace so solomon comes along and solomon builds the temple where does he build it on the exact same location where jesus was crucified is that right so a temple of god must be connected to where the blood sacrifice was and has come from is that right now apostle paul comes along later after acts chapter 9 and he's the messenger of the age and he starts preaching about the tabernacle of god as with i should say that we are the temple of god now paul's laying it out but peter already had an understanding of it because in his life he was expressing it now watch this temple now peter and john went up together into the temple why did he say peter and john peter was the feast of pentecost john was the feast of tabernacles you're john peter was a spokesman for the feast of uh pentecost john was the one on the isle of patmos who got caught up into the lord's day and saw himself in theophany form in revelation chapter four are you with me now and this is put into the book of acts and he said well write another book of acts the same book of acts but brought back into its fullness time again now a dispensation has changed from judaism into christianity is that right the veil was read from top to bottom at passover and at just that cut the time of the jews was finished but there was an overlap time before titus came in and wiped the whole thing out where we are in an overlap time now my friends oh my we're in overlap time i tell you something we are in a real overlap time so i believe that the lord's cautioning me to tell you that it is later than what you think watch these people went up to the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour just another just five minutes that's it that's it and a certain lame man from his mother's womb was carried whom they lay daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to us arms of them that entered into the temple here is at the temple now when jesus went to calvary says the before he went he said destroy this temple or i'll raise it up again now when the holy ghost fell at pentecost what came into existence heaps and heaps of tempos the mercy seat changed from one man to a many member body praise the lord now the access to salvation came by who you connected with verse 3 this man who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked on arms and feet of peter facing his eyes on him but john said look on us look at us we have the access to salvation who are you the access to people where's the mercy seat may the mercy seat stand up praise the lord musicians please those mercy seats need to speak with one voice united at the time of the evening sacrifice we have arrived you're going to go out of this place and go home and i pray this will break like a dawning of a new day to you the bar my friends has been lifted and this little woman goes up and she's s is going up to the king and the king's trying to get it look don't you know your position girl when hyman's in the land the fourth seal is revealed is that right harmon was the fourth seal under the fourth seal uh harmon's trying to go and destroy what the royal seeds but where's the mercy seat for the jews and esther where's the mercy seat for your loved ones and you brother says i would rather have them respect you than respect me by talking about i mean the lord said that respect his people than respect him because when you're respecting his people you are respecting him you know most people that we'll be talking to will be sick of resurrection people but there needs to be an access point where they can respect god's mercy seats praise the lord sobering stuff my friends sobering you're the most important people on the earth right now please do not go out that door without recognizing who you are amen if all these old calls are all been done
