[30:09] but
[30:11] while we're standing let's read
[30:12] Ephesians chapter one
[30:15] and um
[30:17] then we will sit down
[30:20] the Bible says in the book of Ephesians
[30:23] chapter one let's we're going to jump
[30:24] verses we'll read 1 4 1 3 4 5 and 11.
[30:29] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[30:31] will of God
[30:33] to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[30:35] to the signs that are in Stokes Valley

[30:40] Hutt stocks daily New Zealand
[30:43] 113 George Street to those ones Ryan is
[30:48] writing to you and to the faithful in
[30:51] Jesus in Christ Jesus verse 3 blessed be
[30:55] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[30:57] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[31:01] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[31:03] in Christ verse 4 according as he had
[31:08] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[31:11] of the world remember you were chosen if
[31:14] you just sit and think about it
[31:17] it's debate yeah
[31:20] and
[31:23] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[31:26] of the world that we should be holy and
[31:31] Without Blame
[31:32] before him in love this is just
[31:36] to the world this is philosophy
[31:39] but to us it's life
[31:41] amen listen to that verse according as
[31:44] he has chosen us right when you choose
[31:47] something that means ah it's not you
[31:49] choose it it's not with you you are
[31:51] choosing it right as he has chosen us
[31:54] in him in we were in him when he chose
[31:58] us
[31:59] before the foundation of the world I
[32:03] thought we are living here but we you
[32:05] were there before the foundation you
[32:08] were there and he chose you in other
[32:10] words he singled you out you know when
[32:13] you when you sought diamond in your mind
[32:15] they say there's a room called Diamond
[32:17] sorting room they sought it out
[32:19] according to their quality
[32:22] according to the value according to all
[32:24] the the requirements that are there they
[32:26] sorted out yeah so we were not chosen
[32:30] because of our quality we were just
[32:32] chosen because he loved to choose you he
[32:35] must have seen something in us and
[32:37] that's something something he put
[32:38] himself
[32:39] this is just for honey in the rocket
[32:43] right let's read verse 5. having
[32:46] predestinated us and to the adoption of
[32:50] children
[32:51] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[32:55] the good pleasure of his will amen
[32:58] in whom also we have obtained an
[33:02] inheritance upon being chosen he also

[34:15] finish this one brother sorry I'm sorry

[34:22] worked on all things after the Council
[34:25] of his own will I just love that okay
[34:28] you may enjoy the comfort of your seat
[34:29] I'm so sorry
[34:31] I won't do it again and my sister I
[34:34] promise you that the thing is this I
[34:36] just wanted us to read it together while
[34:38] standing you know the Lord the Lord
[34:40] appreciates it when we honor his word
[34:42] amen of course we don't make it alone
[34:44] yeah so last time we spoke about uh the
[34:49] believer's position in the mystical body
[34:52] how many remembers in the mystical body
[34:54] of the Lord amen so I said we are going
[34:57] to continue and finish it off but we'll
[34:59] just recap a little bit and then we jump
[35:02] to the part that we
[35:04] um the part that we didn't finish last
[35:05] time and then I'll bring something
[35:08] towards the end we will not deter we
[35:11] just take another you know when you
[35:12] drive you find r58
[35:14] State Highway 1 and then you can take
[35:17] either way going to paraparaumu you can
[35:19] go that way Johnsonville you can go akas
[35:22] you can go
[35:23] hey
[35:24] so we're just going to the talk instead
[35:27] of hey who's we take acas but we are
[35:29] going to all right
[35:32] amen so let's just uh
[35:35] first let's just put the word
[35:38] I'd like to be sensitive of the watch
[35:41] and
[35:43] we just put stopwatch
[35:46] to say reset and we let it count
[35:50] it will tell us so last time we we spoke
[35:53] about the believer's position just to
[35:55] recap and then we'll jump quickly to the
[35:57] last point that we were we we learned
[36:00] last time that uh
[36:02] um as Paul has spoken we learned that
[36:04] there's a mystical body and we learned
[36:06] that each part of the body is important
[36:08] and we also learned that you need to
[36:11] find your position that an ear cannot
[36:13] take the part of your nose so the tongue
[36:16] cannot take the part of an esophagus and
[36:18] esophagus can take the part of a
[36:20] pancreas and a pancreas can take the
[36:23] part of a brain yes each part has got
[36:26] its own position role and Duty by
[36:29] position we said we are not talking
[36:31] about you know in church the levels of
[36:34] the structure the hierarchy we're not
[36:36] talking about being a trustee on the
[36:38] charger Army and Isaac we single
[36:40] ourselves we say this is our position in
[36:42] ND and then the pastor says this is no
[36:44] no that's not what we are talking about
[36:45] we are talking about the position in the
[36:48] body yeah because we learned that
[36:51] position determines your possession and
[36:55] that's what we are going to talk about
[36:56] today we learned that the book of
[36:59] Ephesians Ephesians parallels the Book
[37:02] of Joshua as you read in this book
[37:04] you'll find in this book that the you
[37:07] wear a prodigal son but when The
[37:10] Prodigal Son came home he was given a
[37:13] gown amen he was not given a a where
[37:17] were you going attitude right
[37:19] he was not given what why were you what
[37:22] were you think you're doing no he was
[37:24] given a golden ring
[37:26] no the man who went and wasted his
[37:29] resources right right he was given
[37:31] account
[37:32] but I don't believe that that prodigal
[37:35] son being accepted even though his
[37:37] brother was unhappy I don't believe his
[37:39] father was allowing him to bring the
[37:41] behavior of the pig stalls well he was
[37:45] do you think that because his father
[37:47] accepted him allowed him and loved him
[37:49] he allowed him to come and bring
[37:50] Hollywood to the Palace he did not right
[37:54] love does not mean that you can do what
[37:57] you want right
[37:58] we also learned that Joshua was given
[38:01] the responsibility to see to to allocate
[38:05] the land we learned that Joshua was
[38:08] given the responsibility to allocate the
[38:11] land of inheritance in
[38:14] the promised land are we remembering
[38:16] that so that's our recap and we are
[38:19] recapping that as many as we can be
[38:21] members
[38:22] then will be the Benjamin will be there
[38:24] Joseph will be there manasa will be
[38:26] there and all the children of of Jacob
[38:29] will be allocated according to their
[38:31] time levers will will have their
[38:33] position each one right yeah I mean so
[38:37] now today we are going to look at having
[38:41] having recapped about that we are going
[38:43] to look at the position which determines
[38:46] the position we you cannot be able to
[38:50] get your possession if you lost your
[38:53] position sorry we gave it many examples
[38:55] including sport in sport we gave many
[38:58] examples we gave examples that in sport
[39:01] you can you you must keep your position
[39:03] in order for you you know in soccer they
[39:06] say the the other team had a ball
[39:09] possession the whole 80 percent of the
[39:11] time if you if you check that game
[39:14] profile you'll find that those guys have
[39:16] maintained their position they've
[39:18] maintained the ball they keep the ball
[39:20] they pass between each other they score
[39:22] goals and they they shoot and they give
[39:25] position and they don't give it they
[39:27] keep it positioned why so that they can
[39:29] win the game keeping your position the
[39:32] likeload of you winning the game is very
[39:35] high the likelihood of you overcoming
[39:37] the devil when you keep your position
[39:39] it's very hard AI with a Believer it's
[39:42] not high it's guaranteed
[39:46] now if you keep your position don't
[39:48] worry about other things you keep your
[39:50] position where in the way in the
[39:52] promised land where you are you are
[39:54] given the Holy Spirit and that Holy
[39:56] Spirit does not mean that the devil is
[39:59] not there to shock you a little bit when
[40:02] you are given the holy spirit in your
[40:04] spirit you find that if there are still
[40:06] some demons there
[40:08] [Laughter]
[40:11] whether you are given the Holy Spirit it
[40:13] does not mean now you are immune from
[40:15] from demons some of the habits I have
[40:18] not died it is your duty now okay let me
[40:21] show you this way
[40:22] when they go to the promised land right
[40:24] they they found that they were strange
[40:26] Nations and they arrived there they
[40:29] close the Jordan they arrived there
[40:30] brother Jimmy do you think it was easy
[40:33] do you think afterwards it was easy they
[40:36] arrived at the land of milk and honey
[40:38] where is the honey where's the milk well
[40:40] if we are going to fight the amorites
[40:42] and the jebusitis where is the milk
[40:44] I don't see milk and honey here is there
[40:48] so they still had to fight the up the
[40:51] amalekites the Philistines and the
[40:53] Canyons they still had to fight them
[40:55] even though they arrived in the promised
[40:57] land but one thing was for sure that
[40:59] every footsteps that they walk every
[41:01] step every piece of land that they walk
[41:03] belong to them right so now they had to
[41:07] maintain a position tonight I want us to
[41:10] look at this interesting aspect
[41:12] if you look at your spirit it has got
[41:14] five senses how many knows those five
[41:16] things five senses Liam One
[41:21] Phil which is not the flesh my boy not
[41:24] the outside not the seeing smell those
[41:27] ones are fired for the outside
[41:29] for the spirit
[41:31] huh let me see you Bible readers you
[41:34] message Believers let me see reasoning
[41:38] Isaac

[41:44] imagination you guys are getting a plus
[41:46] now
[41:47] ah is it affection another one yeah nah
[41:50] is it conscious is it conscious so those
[41:53] are the five
[41:54] spirit I mean senses of the spirit now
[41:58] the Lord give you the Holy Spirit right
[42:00] the pastor taught us here he said when
[42:02] he gives you it comes like a little
[42:04] button
[42:06] ah have you ever you know do you know
[42:08] that thing that will stick just stick it
[42:10] on the fridge there oh you stick you
[42:13] stick something with a glue stick or a
[42:15] Bostick on the fridge
[42:17] sits there so he comes and give it to
[42:20] the Holy Spirit to you right because you
[42:22] can't imagine you can't say it's too big
[42:24] it's too small huh because you can never
[42:26] measure the weight of God and finish it
[42:28] so he gives it to you you and me are
[42:30] given inner measure
[42:32] right it gives us a measure you paste it
[42:35] on you paste it paste it paste it but
[42:37] hey this is like a land you know the
[42:40] holy spirit is Our Land right that's our
[42:42] holy land where we arrive that's our
[42:44] inheritance it's our promise right
[42:46] Joshua allocated Joshua means Jesus
[42:50] Jesus Jehovah savior am I right that's
[42:52] what it means so he allocates and the
[42:54] Holy Spirit is there he's the one now
[42:56] he's growing now he's find that there's
[42:59] some jealous eyes in this land there's
[43:01] some uh Strange Land system strange
[43:05] people that are there there in the in
[43:07] the soul in the spirit I mean there's
[43:09] some strange habits there's some
[43:11] cultural things there's some family
[43:14] Spirits there's some habits that you
[43:16] came with from the world they are there
[43:19] but he gives the holy spirit
[43:21] so now the Holy Spirit you feed him you
[43:24] feed him you are fighting in this you're
[43:26] fighting in this you're fighting in
[43:28] upon sword you're killing and you are
[43:31] eating the word of God so you're
[43:32] starting to grow that Spirit starts to
[43:34] grow as you would overcome you will
[43:36] overcome your oh it's close and growth
[43:38] the more Joshua and them were moving
[43:40] forward the more land they were taking
[43:44] the mo and that is given to them the
[43:47] Holy Spirit gave you the lord gave you
[43:49] everything built in that little button
[43:51] of the holy spirit it's going to be a
[43:53] mountain of a warrior it's going to be
[43:57] fully fleshed adopted son of God but if
[44:00] you start you are fighting man
[44:03] you've got everything built in that
[44:04] button but hey you're struggling
[44:07] is the battle but every time you fight
[44:10] you win and then as you take your
[44:13] position it starts to grow the land
[44:15] starts to grow and he allocates it he
[44:17] grows he grows he goes remember I want
[44:20] to give you an example and a parallel
[44:22] example that the lord gave me here of
[44:24] the five Kings these five senses of the
[44:26] spirit reminds me of those five Kings

[46:58] Kings
[47:00] and the first king yeah that's Joshua 10

[47:19] us put the church in his order giving to
[47:23] each one gives places position amen
[47:26] that's what the Joshua of today is doing
[47:28] who is the Holy Spirit right and he is
[47:31] the voice of God speaking through the
[47:33] inner man that Christ has saved the Holy
[47:35] Spirit now you get that much of it now

[47:41] Ephesians are you attending with me
[47:45] let's go down he's positionally placing
[47:48] the church where they belong now Joshua
[47:50] placed them in the natural land now the
[47:54] holy spirit is placing the church
[47:55] positionally in the land that they
[47:59] that they in the position that they
[48:01] belong in their inheritance what is our
[48:04] inheritance
[48:05] is built there in the word of God right
[48:07] now I want to read about these Kings
[48:10] let's look at the story of these Kings
[48:13] they gather themselves
[48:15] huh they gather themselves and they said
[48:18] they're going to fight Joshua they're
[48:19] called and they form a coalition they
[48:22] formed an alliance that's a I don't know

[49:06] came and wanted to fight Joshua right
[49:09] now you find them when you get there to
[49:11] the promised land you'll find them there

[49:47] and a God the Holy Spirit Joshua he's
[49:51] gonna fight them one by one one by one
[49:55] and the more he fights is the more he's
[49:57] Gathering the land is the more it takes
[49:59] position
[50:01] all right

[50:05] built up some of them you can't even
[50:07] remember them in your active memory your
[50:10] your active memory when you are awake
[50:13] they are hidden there some of them don't
[50:15] want to be seen man all of them but the
[50:18] holy spirit is able to thrush them out
[50:21] only thing me and you must allow him
[50:24] must allow the captain of the host to
[50:26] fight you know Joshua came there and he
[50:28] said okay the people went and they
[50:30] fought them and they captured them kept

[55:30] because of that demon that's how a demon
[55:32] is wow it comes to destroy because this
[55:35] is a battle Yeah so those demons they
[55:37] are like that there's only one pesticide
[55:39] which is the holy spirit amen that one
[55:41] is applied you can remove them oh yeah
[55:43] clean clean memory
[55:45] no why are the things that you used to

[55:52] think about them now if you are
[55:55] experiencing that in your life be joyful
[55:57] be happy know that hey I am no more what
[56:01] I used to be devil and that's your
[56:03] Victory statement amen that's to say
[56:06] yeah that's for you to realize you need
[56:08] to come to the realization that what you
[56:09] used to be yeah you're normal amen once
[56:12] you see that that means other demons
[56:14] have died
[56:15] if there's more you must identify them
[56:19] yeah don't shy away from identifying
[56:22] them when you see wrong I'll show you
[56:23] now I'm not saying don't guilty destroy
[56:26] yourself yeah but identify the wrongs
[56:29] when he's a child of God is a pliable
[56:31] person it's a correctable person a child
[56:34] of God is not someone who is defensive
[56:36] someone who don't who cannot correct be
[56:38] corrected no a child of God says ah
[56:41] thank you Lord
[56:42] for correcting me thank you Lord can you
[56:45] while we are on it father can you can we
[56:48] deal with this one because this one
[56:50] firstly give me a heart to hate it amen
[56:52] I like brother Ben when he says we we
[56:55] must hate the devil must know that we we
[56:58] mean business when we say we hate him
[57:00] even if he can come and kick me tomorrow
[57:03] the kick that I'm gonna give him is
[57:06] going to be a million times hot so he
[57:09] must know that that we are not fearful
[57:11] of him yeah bring those demons on let
[57:14] them die bring them devil if you are
[57:16] threatening us bring them they're going
[57:18] to die we've got a pesticide that will
[57:20] apply and that's our stronghold that's
[57:24] our help that's our Strong Tower that's
[57:27] our safety
[57:28] baby in The Mother We said that's our
[57:30] safety
[57:32] that's our safety that's our protection
[57:36] it's our safety Glory I need to
[57:38] emphasize it stop it
[57:40] that's our safety what if you say safety
[57:43] is too soft
[57:46] safety oh no no no safety
[57:51] protection that's your safety
[57:56] so those guys must die yes all across to
[58:00] affection level
[58:01] in that area why must they die so that
[58:04] the spirit of God that button can grow
[58:06] and they feel that whole area
[58:09] I asked the Lord one time I said Lord
[58:11] when I was a boy I said Lord help me to
[58:14] dream about you only I don't want these
[58:17] bad dreams as a young man yeah help me
[58:20] Lord and the Lord developed it and I
[58:22] started to dream about him and I used to
[58:24] worry when I'm sleeping why when I'm in
[58:26] trouble and I'm Dreaming why don't I say
[58:28] call the name of Jesus I asked Lord Lord
[58:30] give me to call the name of Jesus I must
[58:32] not forget in my dream amen that's where
[58:34] the fight is in the subconscious when
[58:36] you are sleeping you think you are
[58:38] sleeping no your spirit is hard at work
[58:41] why only the flesh because he's too lazy
[58:43] and too
[58:45] the spirit is busy yeah those five
[58:48] senses they're busy they're busy with a
[58:52] guy called adonizedek
[58:55] to deal with him he must die he also he
[59:00] made coalitions he called a whole group
[59:03] of people to come and fight Joshua so he
[59:06] said well but he said it's we for the
[59:08] winning
[59:09] and that's the beauty of it when we are
[59:12] at War and we know that we are many of
[59:15] the people that goes to war including
[59:17] Putin yeah they don't know whether
[59:19] they're going to win or not they are not
[59:21] sure we when we go to war you know that
[59:24] it's a battle one and that's the beauty
[59:26] of it that tells you that hey you must
[59:29] go full force you must go full
[59:32] speed amen
[59:35] so that adonisetta can die
[59:37] him and all his friends yeah
[59:40] now I want us to quickly jump to
[59:43] that detour that I spoke about but
[59:46] before we do that
[59:48] before we do that mean the message and
[59:51] know it did not preach 1965.
[59:54] and that is page 12 my dear brother
[59:58] he says now
[1:00:00] and just to re-emphasize on this aspect
[1:00:02] of these Kings
[1:00:04] that will rule you my body that we're
[1:00:06] really ruling my Promised Land huh that
[1:00:09] to show that they are going to die just
[1:00:12] to show you that who are they the
[1:00:14] prophet says now
[1:00:15] it it's got five illness the spirit
[1:00:18] right and then five unless I don't know
[1:00:21] whether I can call them right off now
[1:00:24] when the first I know is thought is
[1:00:27] thought conscious and I love and love
[1:00:30] choice no conscious love reason you know
[1:00:33] all of the men I'm looking for a place
[1:00:35] where I wrote where the Prophet says you
[1:00:37] know
[1:00:38] he says you see you you you think you
[1:00:42] think that you use your mind to think
[1:00:43] and or your brains no you don't you use
[1:00:46] your spirit right it is your spirit that
[1:00:48] thinks it is your spirit that do all
[1:00:51] these sorts of things in your your
[1:00:52] reasoning is not your your medulla you
[1:00:55] know medulla or do you call it medala
[1:00:57] here yes it's not your medulla oblongata
[1:00:59] It's Not Your Surrender and your your
[1:01:01] upper Thalamus all those biological
[1:01:03] things no it is your spirit yes yes
[1:01:06] something you that the scientists cannot
[1:01:08] show you
[1:01:10] the top March of the
[1:01:13] flow where does the process of thought
[1:01:15] come on they don't know they think it's
[1:01:17] from the the even the mind the moment
[1:01:20] you talk of mind I would like to believe
[1:01:21] that the moment you say mine that's your
[1:01:23] wealthy term we say spirit
[1:01:29] and why is the mind
[1:01:31] can you say he's here or is here or is
[1:01:34] here oh wait the spirit is here I don't
[1:01:37] know where but it's called those five
[1:01:39] senses and it's their body
[1:01:42] and and and and I want to tell you that
[1:01:45] you use the spirit to reason to it is
[1:01:49] the spirit that feeds your thoughts
[1:01:51] process and the nerves and all those
[1:01:53] things once this thing is out this guy
[1:01:56] he can have as much senses as he like
[1:01:59] there's nothing you can do once the
[1:02:02] spirit is deactivated
[1:02:04] if the spirit leaves the body he even
[1:02:06] die he's got now the soul goes the
[1:02:09] spirit you know so the spirit is such a
[1:02:11] powerful powerful power and the devil
[1:02:13] knows it
[1:02:15] that's why it's called the Battleground
[1:02:17] because
[1:02:18] we who are on Earth
[1:02:20] met with this guy called The Devil in
[1:02:23] the place called Middle Ground called
[1:02:25] the spirit or the Mind fighting here
[1:02:28] fighting where for access
[1:02:30] to the feet of God
[1:02:33] the inside where the fighting to get
[1:02:36] there in the inner holy of holies that's
[1:02:38] why he's fighting he wants to take
[1:02:40] control of the inside the soul he wants
[1:02:43] to take control
[1:02:45] because he knows that there's no five
[1:02:46] Kings or anything there's other one king
[1:02:49] and one enemy and he wants to take that
[1:02:51] imagine he wants to take a place of God
[1:02:52] imagine I make you and you want to take
[1:02:55] a place my place
[1:02:58] what a disrespectful guy but God made
[1:03:01] him that way
[1:03:02] and God made him that way so that he can
[1:03:04] show his honor his glory let's quickly
[1:03:07] jump to pay charm
[1:03:09] 13. we want to take a small detail a
[1:03:12] small David right and and say you have
[1:03:16] taken your position you have been
[1:03:17] adopted and now you worship God you have
[1:03:20] to come to a point where you are a true
[1:03:22] worshiper of God and I want to read for
[1:03:26] you the Book of Genesis chapter 4.
[1:03:30] Genesis chapter 4.
[1:03:32] it says
[1:03:33] 4 from verse 3 and in the process of
[1:03:36] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[1:03:38] the fruit of the ground
[1:03:41] and offering unto the Lord came
[1:03:45] brought the fruit of the ground to come
[1:03:47] and worship God yeah
[1:03:49] and this for an Abel he also brought the
[1:03:54] first Links of his flaw and the fact
[1:03:56] they're all and the Lord had respect
[1:03:59] unto Abel and his offering
[1:04:01] huh and Abel also brought sorry verse
[1:04:05] five but unto Cain and to his offering
[1:04:08] he had no respect and Cain was very
[1:04:12] rough
[1:04:13] and his countenance fell
[1:04:16] he loses his position there and there
[1:04:18] because the true worshiper
[1:04:21] When God says Ah I don't respect this
[1:04:24] you'll say how Lord what must I do to be
[1:04:27] saved you know you don't get upset and
[1:04:29] say
[1:04:31] no that's why that woman there was told
[1:04:34] that ah come on
[1:04:37] why must we give dogs
[1:04:40] if I tell you today when you ask me
[1:04:42] something unexpectedly when you're not
[1:04:44] in the spirit or you are not up there
[1:04:46] and I call your dog
[1:04:48] I'm telling you
[1:04:51] I want to see the light of day
[1:04:54] I say no no brother I don't give that to
[1:04:57] dogs
[1:04:59] would even forget that I'm his big
[1:05:02] brother
[1:05:03] he'll say no no brother but don't talk
[1:05:05] like that
[1:05:07] so but that woman never never
[1:05:09] overreacted yeah he said Lord
[1:05:13] she got a revelation
[1:05:15] he said Lord even the dogs eat the
[1:05:19] she got a revelation that she is a dog
[1:05:23] and that's by believing that She chased
[1:05:26] from dog to sheep
[1:05:30] hallelujah thank you from a doctor a
[1:05:33] sheep instantly that Revelation he has
[1:05:36] always been a sheep and he came here the
[1:05:39] people take her land and everything and
[1:05:41] as you look like a dog then she got the
[1:05:43] revolution
[1:05:44] or faith like this I've never come
[1:05:46] across in the whole of Israel
[1:05:49] from that point
[1:05:51] she was clearly a sheep
[1:05:53] hear the revelation so now a True
[1:05:57] Believer
[1:05:58] if you want to worship God truly
[1:06:01] if you really want to worship God truly
[1:06:03] you can see that this process of
[1:06:05] worshiping God the reason why God
[1:06:08] created us
[1:06:09] to worship you was to bring Glory and
[1:06:12] Honor that's the reason why you and me
[1:06:13] exist yeah everything that God made was
[1:06:16] to bring glory and honor and praise to
[1:06:19] himself
[1:06:20] including you and me and all the
[1:06:23] universe
[1:06:24] everything was to show that God is God
[1:06:27] it was to show honor and Glory every day
[1:06:30] everything that you do that you think it
[1:06:33] must bring glory and honor to God in
[1:06:35] some way or the other I don't know and
[1:06:37] I'm not saying go find it but it must
[1:06:41] now how do I know that I'm worshiping
[1:06:43] him in truth and in spirit you must
[1:06:46] always go to the beginning if you see a
[1:06:48] Cain and Abel but that when God made
[1:06:51] them and what they were bringing worship
[1:06:53] can you see where worship started in the
[1:06:55] Garden of Eden there were the first two
[1:06:57] people the prophet says that started to
[1:06:59] worship and a worshiping you can't help
[1:07:01] it if you don't want to worship God
[1:07:03] you're going to worship something else
[1:07:05] because a human being it is in his
[1:07:07] nature that's how God Made You To
[1:07:10] Worship
[1:07:14] it's my nature I can't help it if I
[1:07:17] don't want to worship God I'm going to
[1:07:19] find myself worshiping another God yes
[1:07:21] yes whether sport whether you troop
[1:07:24] whether documentary of the military
[1:07:25] whether whether I worship my job or my
[1:07:29] car or my clothes or my business or my
[1:07:31] job or whatever something you're going
[1:07:33] to worship yeah I don't care what you
[1:07:36] say you are going to worship something
[1:07:38] amen so it's not a strong tone that's
[1:07:48] the son of the Devil Himself had to come
[1:07:51] and bring worship to God he knew because
[1:07:53] God put in the nature to worship amen
[1:07:57] but when he brought things to worship
[1:07:59] God God said no no no okay I don't think
[1:08:02] God was wrought with him God was not
[1:08:04] wrong God was just being friendly and
[1:08:06] simple he said no no no I'm not saying
[1:08:08] you can't worship
[1:08:09] when I give you example I don't want to
[1:08:11] touch anyone else because
[1:08:14] he said okay
[1:08:15] no no
[1:08:16] I I don't respect you
[1:08:19] your your sacrifice your your worshipmen
[1:08:22] I don't I don't that one I respect it
[1:08:25] okay instead of engaging God he did
[1:08:28] notice the mind he said he got so angry
[1:08:30] he turned around
[1:08:32] and I'm sorry
[1:08:35] kick those apples and bananas
[1:08:38] you are so angry right instead of asking
[1:08:41] God okay my Lord because you made all
[1:08:43] things and he was only showing who he is
[1:08:47] yeah if it was Abel let's say Abel made
[1:08:50] a mistake there when he was not having
[1:08:51] that lamp God shows
[1:09:07] what does he think he knows this guy all
[1:09:10] the way from Africa there to tell us
[1:09:12] yeah no he doesn't say that yeah it
[1:09:14] should believe us they speak to me a lot
[1:09:19] no I haven't came he him he was angry
[1:09:24] we know God designed a man to worship
[1:09:26] you now let us go to the upper points
[1:09:29] I've made a few points upstairs there
[1:09:31] upstairs I mean
[1:09:34] that's my English
[1:09:36] now we go to the beginning
[1:09:39] to worship right yeah I said they check
[1:09:41] on how it was done from the beginning
[1:09:45] Jesus Christ told them that from the
[1:09:48] beginning it was not so
[1:09:50] I don't think he was only referring to
[1:09:51] marriage
[1:09:52] right when he said from the beginning he
[1:09:55] said even worship I believe he the
[1:09:58] things that they were doing the Lord
[1:10:00] could not just tell them at the time but
[1:10:01] because they were talking about marriage
[1:10:04] he has to tell them that no from the
[1:10:05] beginning it was not so Moses allowed
[1:10:08] you because of the hardness of your
[1:10:09] fathers but from the beginning yeah I
[1:10:13] think that statement is applicable to
[1:10:15] everything right whether worship whether
[1:10:18] what we do prayer everything our lives
[1:10:21] from the beginning we're not the way
[1:10:23] they are today if we want to worship God
[1:10:25] truly and worship him we must go to the
[1:10:28] beginning and check how it was done why
[1:10:31] because a true worship
[1:10:34] let me know jump ahead of myself a true
[1:10:36] worship must it is originally a true
[1:10:40] worship is original if you go down there
[1:10:42] you you you you'll see that I wrote
[1:10:45] just before Genesis 4 originality of
[1:10:49] faith
[1:10:50] two two worship will bring that yeah
[1:10:52] yeah original Faith original prayer
[1:10:55] original worship original we want
[1:10:58] original Christians a true worship will
[1:11:01] bring that the origin we mean we mean
[1:11:04] origin the one that was there at the
[1:11:06] beginning you you must look like the
[1:11:08] ones that were there at the beginning
[1:11:11] chapter 4 says that that our hearts are
[1:11:14] going to be taken back to our
[1:11:15] forefathers it must look like when the
[1:11:17] gospel started in the gentle
[1:11:19] dispensation it must go back there and
[1:11:21] look like that one to the original one
[1:11:24] and that original one must look like the
[1:11:27] original worship yeah you must have the
[1:11:30] faith of of uh of Abraham and Enoch
[1:11:35] our origin the way we I must end up
[1:11:38] today must be like this if you find that
[1:11:41] you are deviating go back to the
[1:11:43] original yeah yeah otherwise you are
[1:11:44] lying to yourself you're not worshiping
[1:11:45] God right and I'm sorry if this is hard
[1:11:47] I appreciate it's because I love you I
[1:11:50] don't mean to be hard but I'm just
[1:11:52] wanting to show you that the true
[1:11:53] worship must go back to the origin how
[1:11:56] things were
[1:11:58] through faith original Faith original
[1:12:01] Christians yeah
[1:12:04] in this age that we are living in where
[1:12:06] there is everything of this civilization
[1:12:08] our civilization our worship must
[1:12:11] reflect we must be what we call oddballs
[1:12:14] you know it's an oddball yes
[1:12:16] when they look at us they must feel
[1:12:19] comfortable that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:12:20] no they must be uncomfortable
[1:12:24] I don't mean God brought us here to make
[1:12:26] us suffer no
[1:12:28] but love is corrective God brought us
[1:12:31] here to to show Glory bring honor to
[1:12:35] himself right
[1:12:38] I feel good I mean Cain got upset the
[1:12:42] purpose of why we exist we find it part
[1:12:44] of it in the book of Isaiah 43 where he
[1:12:47] says fear not for I am with thee says
[1:12:51] the Lord I am with you I will bring thy
[1:12:54] seed from the East and gather thee from
[1:12:57] the West verse 6 I will say to the north
[1:13:00] give up and to the South keep not beg my
[1:13:04] children bring my sons from far and my
[1:13:07] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[1:13:09] bring them because verse 7 says because
[1:13:12] even everyone that is called by my name
[1:13:16] everyone
[1:13:18] for I have created him for he have
[1:13:21] created him for mine Glory that's why
[1:13:24] God Made You and Me For His glory amen
[1:13:27] not for our Glory not for any man's
[1:13:30] Glory
[1:13:31] of course we must love one another I
[1:13:33] must love my brother and respect the
[1:13:34] position that God gave him as my pastor
[1:13:36] and the Elevate him lift up his hands
[1:13:39] but I must not worship Him
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:44] so God may I must worship the god in him
[1:13:48] it's just a quiet defined line eh
[1:13:50] but it's a very clear like this for me
[1:13:52] it's very bold he's very bolded I
[1:13:55] worship the father and I worship God if
[1:13:58] God is in you I worship God who is in
[1:14:01] you you Worship the Lord that is in me
[1:14:04] does it come above your eyes
[1:14:07] I hear this I can I can hear the silence
[1:14:10] that's why
[1:14:12] everyone is created for him for his
[1:14:15] glory and I am formed and I have formed
[1:14:19] him I have made him everyone for his
[1:14:24] glory you know you know in the Lord the
[1:14:27] Lord you know in literature we talk of
[1:14:29] personification
[1:14:31] God says I'll call the north you know he
[1:14:33] he
[1:14:34] personifies the north as if the north is
[1:14:36] a person yeah he says I said to the
[1:14:37] mountains jump like they are humans God
[1:14:40] talks to them just like that mountain
[1:14:42] hey you hot River come here and hi
[1:14:45] people come running yes Lord
[1:14:48] he says
[1:14:49] come here
[1:14:51] I want you to jump and go sitting right
[1:14:53] behind capite Mountain
[1:14:58] he says I call them and they come
[1:15:00] running to me like little cows

[1:15:18] there's other bigger planets that are
[1:15:21] millions size bigger than our planet
[1:15:25] you know I was thinking the other day I
[1:15:27] said Lord you are so great I sent Ed a
[1:15:30] message and I was almost kind because I
[1:15:31] just looked to the sky and I was crying
[1:15:33] wow because you know our Earth our Earth
[1:15:37] this one is such a blessed Place God
[1:15:41] chose it the way he chose you
[1:15:44] of all in the bigger scheme of things
[1:15:46] brothers and sisters of this world you
[1:15:49] are nothing
[1:15:51] you are nothing you think we are
[1:15:52] somebody dead no my boy
[1:15:55] no and I'm not disrespecting you I'm
[1:15:58] just trying to help you to realize that
[1:16:00] in the bigger scheme of things you are
[1:16:02] nothing
[1:16:03] I am zero in the bigger scheme of things
[1:16:06] the moment you realize that and you
[1:16:09] realize that but it's a big God inside
[1:16:11] you you know this Earth was chosen yeah
[1:16:14] there's a massive massive systems out
[1:16:18] there but God chose this minute little
[1:16:21] planet to put life on it you can go
[1:16:24] anywhere you won't find life in any
[1:16:26] Planet all the big ones some of them are
[1:16:28] don't even remember their names
[1:16:30] big they say some of them the way
[1:16:33] they're so big they're like if you take
[1:16:35] your golf two hands you feel a bus with
[1:16:37] a golf good golf balls our head being a
[1:16:40] golf ball you feel a bus 65-seater
[1:16:44] 15 people standing
[1:16:47] you fill it up with gold balls
[1:16:50] wow it will make one of some of the
[1:16:52] planets yeah with our planet filled up
[1:16:55] in that bus
[1:16:56] to make one planet God calls it one way
[1:16:59] and say come here yeah so that God chose
[1:17:03] our little planet to make it nice and
[1:17:06] beautiful and put life on it doesn't
[1:17:08] that look like you
[1:17:09] that look like you man there we go that
[1:17:12] little planet God chose to make life and
[1:17:14] choose and say you have I Choose You
[1:17:15] among many I Choose You and I put life
[1:17:17] you God chose I I'm gonna Dell in this
[1:17:21] body I'm gonna tell in this man I'm
[1:17:24] gonna make you my son in the bigger
[1:17:27] scheme of things man today we've got
[1:17:30] over seven billion people on Earth just
[1:17:33] imagine how many people lived before us
[1:17:35] from the beginning until today and those
[1:17:38] that are now being born as we speak God
[1:17:41] chose you in the bigger scheme praise
[1:17:44] the Lord what was F why what was Earth
[1:17:47] doing to qualify
[1:17:49] to add ethics like you were it's like me
[1:17:52] so now we go to Matthew again now here
[1:17:58] we want to talk about worship right
[1:18:02] they worship God in the mountains
[1:18:04] according to Matthew 4 the woman was
[1:18:07] talking to the Lord and he said Lord the
[1:18:09] Lord you worship but you know not what
[1:18:12] don't know what you're worshiping this
[1:18:14] is the story how it started and this is
[1:18:16] you know our fathers told us that we we
[1:18:18] worship Our God in this mountain and you
[1:18:21] use you say you worshiping me Jerusalem
[1:18:24] why why is there some says Mountain some
[1:18:27] Jerusalem why are we different why why
[1:18:30] doesn't our worship bring the same
[1:18:31] results
[1:18:33] there's a problem
[1:18:35] our worship must bring results of the
[1:18:38] word of God we must not be different if
[1:18:41] Brothers keep short hair I'm sorry
[1:18:42] Brothers
[1:18:47] what I'm trying to say is that our our
[1:18:50] life our the fruits of Our Lives must
[1:18:52] bring what God has predestinated for us
[1:18:55] to bring
[1:18:56] it must not bring conflicting results
[1:18:58] and yet we say we are believers we're in
[1:19:01] the same church we are in the same
[1:19:02] Spirit but yet our spirit finds
[1:19:05] conflicts but yet when I see my brother
[1:19:07] I'm not so happy but yet I gossip but
[1:19:11] yet I think about these thoughts but
[1:19:13] here I'm a two worshiping believer and I
[1:19:15] don't think right about my brother my
[1:19:16] sister those are ABC's Elementary things
[1:19:19] there's different things
[1:19:21] deeper things one of them is love so
[1:19:24] powerful it is that you can make another
[1:19:26] Earth now
[1:19:27] now you can take love and create another
[1:19:30] Earth with it it's such a powerful force
[1:19:33] I I was shocked when Isaac said when we
[1:19:36] had a meeting he said and I went home
[1:19:38] and I thought about it
[1:19:40] Isaac I must pray
[1:19:42] for me
[1:19:43] he said
[1:19:45] he can make this place and everything
[1:19:46] and and then if we live it's all right
[1:19:49] we bless the next person I said this
[1:19:51] brother
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:19:54] so only later I realized that is that
[1:19:57] kind of a thing is called love
[1:20:00] it's called love to say that you you
[1:20:03] want to make this place and everything
[1:20:05] and when we leave and then no no it's
[1:20:07] okay the next person will enjoy what we
[1:20:09] did
[1:20:10] how many love can do that but if you
[1:20:13] don't have the love
[1:20:15] to the next person
[1:20:18] how can you be a child of God
[1:20:20] how can you create
[1:20:26] as an example so but what I'm trying to
[1:20:29] say is that love is so powerful it's got
[1:20:31] a creative power
[1:20:34] love for one another brothers and
[1:20:36] sisters are you brothers and sisters
[1:20:39] hey friends if you are you can love your
[1:20:42] brother beyond measure you can draw a
[1:20:45] big circle your attitude can always be
[1:20:48] positive
[1:20:49] by the way these things that I'm telling
[1:20:51] you
[1:20:52] just to remind you to wake those who are
[1:20:55] asleep I'm talking too much I'm
[1:20:57] referring to this man standing here in
[1:20:58] front of you is double applicable
[1:21:02] double applicable because I'm the one
[1:21:04] even saying it I must believe it if this
[1:21:07] correction if there's any correction is
[1:21:10] directed to me
[1:21:12] just remember that
[1:21:14] you can choose whether it's to you as
[1:21:16] well but what we know is that we are in
[1:21:19] the service and the word of God is going
[1:21:21] forth each one grab their own position
[1:21:23] if you snooze
[1:21:25] you lose
[1:21:29] amen now you guys Worship in the
[1:21:33] mountain and this and that and that he
[1:21:35] said no no no no no no no in verse 10 in
[1:21:37] verse 10 he says
[1:21:39] oh no no that scripture
[1:21:41] I meant the best I meant John but anyway
[1:21:44] that Matthew talks about
[1:21:47] when Satan
[1:21:50] Satan wanted the Lord to worship you
[1:21:52] because when you be so the devil knows
[1:21:55] that worship is what God why God made
[1:21:58] everything and the devil knew that God
[1:22:00] wants him to worship you
[1:22:03] he knew but the problem with the devil
[1:22:05] was that he himself wanted to be
[1:22:06] worshiped
[1:22:07] that was his predicament yeah
[1:22:10] because he saw in heaven the angels for
[1:22:13] millions of years may be worshiping God
[1:22:15] and he said man I like this this
[1:22:17] Arrangement are like but for myself
[1:22:19] right that's out the devil
[1:22:24] if your brother buys a new car don't say
[1:22:26] hey I like that car for me no no no no
[1:22:29] enjoy it for him
[1:22:31] like it for him be happy very happy
[1:22:34] you know now my brother I can he can
[1:22:36] keep me so happy as if it's your car as
[1:22:40] if it's your house be so happy when your
[1:22:43] brother don't
[1:22:44] I I I yeah I think I was thinking of get
[1:22:46] no no no no no this time we are not
[1:22:49] talking about you don't know why I'm
[1:22:51] talking about that but that's what the
[1:22:53] devil did
[1:22:54] when he saw that God was being worshiped
[1:22:57] the idea or the thing of worshiping is
[1:23:00] what God made everything
[1:23:03] we must worship him today in truth and
[1:23:07] in
[1:23:08] spirit and that's the reason analyst to
[1:23:11] worship God in truth and if
[1:23:16] so the Bible says God the Lord Jesus
[1:23:20] Christ told him and he said get thee
[1:23:21] behind me Satan for it is written and
[1:23:23] because the devil is he promised God
[1:23:25] things in that scripture there if you
[1:23:27] read it carefully he said if you bow to
[1:23:29] me I'll give you everything if you
[1:23:30] worship me I'll give you because the
[1:23:33] devil wanted to be worshiped in verse 10
[1:23:35] John John chapter 4 the following
[1:23:37] scripture down there downstairs it says
[1:23:40] our father's worship is the story of
[1:23:42] that woman that I was telling you about
[1:23:43] and because worship
[1:23:46] is not much about the mountain
[1:23:49] it's not much about you are coming here
[1:23:51] to come here is nothing yeah you can go
[1:23:54] anywhere you can go anywhere worship God
[1:23:58] in truth and in spirit and the truth is
[1:24:01] the weight
[1:24:03] right amen God is a spirit verse 23 of
[1:24:08] John
[1:24:09] next one
[1:24:11] or is it disappeared page 15
[1:24:17] God is a spirit and we must worship Him
[1:24:19] in truth and in spirit
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:22] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:24:25] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:24:27] truth two things
[1:24:29] spirit
[1:24:31] and truth and the truth is the weight
[1:24:34] Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth
[1:24:36] and the life and we know that he is the
[1:24:38] weight
[1:24:39] yeah he came to his and they did they
[1:24:42] refused him but he came to his
[1:24:45] let's look at that other point
[1:24:46] worshiping in truth and his Spirit just
[1:24:48] imagine worshiping God all your life
[1:24:51] only to find that you are worshiping him
[1:24:53] in vain
[1:24:54] that would be a painful State of Affairs
[1:24:56] right
[1:24:57] you need to make sure brother sister
[1:24:59] that you are worshiping him in truth
[1:25:02] truth means sincere
[1:25:04] truth means you know the the idea of
[1:25:07] just coming to church
[1:25:09] and we we go home and we take off our
[1:25:12] jackets we feel good why because we are
[1:25:14] from church
[1:25:16] he's not founded
[1:25:17] just to come to church Mama puzzle and
[1:25:20] we come together I'm not meaning you I
[1:25:22] mean us just for us to come to church
[1:25:24] and we're so happy hey today just
[1:25:27] because we went to church
[1:25:29] that's the spirit of religion isn't it
[1:25:31] it's a religious spirit
[1:25:33] it's good to come to church we know what
[1:25:35] because we are made to worship
[1:25:36] but we cannot just be satisfied and
[1:25:39] happy because we come to church every
[1:25:41] Sunday right that's because I'm asked to
[1:25:43] stand here to preach I feel ah I'm a
[1:25:46] saint I'm more than I'm powerful now I'm
[1:25:48] above everyone you don't want to know
[1:25:50] that's because you are preaching does
[1:25:51] not mean that you're worshiping God
[1:25:53] correctly
[1:25:54] no that's the truth for the bit that's
[1:25:57] because I am a pastor sorry brother
[1:26:01] that's because I'm a deacon that does
[1:26:04] not mean that I'm worship you God in
[1:26:05] truth and in spirit
[1:26:07] to preach is one thing
[1:26:09] to live for him is another you know God
[1:26:12] can make you a vessel the cell phone is
[1:26:14] not this catch it it's not it's not what
[1:26:18] is inside the gadget
[1:26:19] it's just a body there's things in here
[1:26:23] you can say wow that's what a lovely
[1:26:25] phone for product it's got how many
[1:26:26] cameras but you open my phone you get
[1:26:29] shocked
[1:26:30] when you find things in there oh boy
[1:26:32] you see so worshiping God can just use a
[1:26:36] tool so don't just be a tool for God
[1:26:39] don't just be a vessel for God be a true
[1:26:42] vessel that worship Him in truth and in
[1:26:45] spirit
[1:26:46] truth meeting sincere meaning in that
[1:26:49] context when God corrects you or shows
[1:26:51] you
[1:26:52] you know to show that you are sincere
[1:26:54] and you are truthful you know how do we
[1:26:56] see
[1:26:57] you know how God knows when you take
[1:27:00] that correction when you do it
[1:27:02] but when God correct you and it shows
[1:27:05] you and you don't take it you are simply
[1:27:07] showing that you are like okay
[1:27:11] now nowadays the case of today they
[1:27:14] don't get angry
[1:27:15] they say oh amen amen amen but they go
[1:27:18] and they don't do it
[1:27:20] they say yeah that's right you're right
[1:27:22] brother God bless you and they go home
[1:27:24] and they repeat the same thing
[1:27:26] if we say sisters must wear
[1:27:28] appropriately according to the Bible we
[1:27:30] mean it that's what it's not us and the
[1:27:33] sisters need to get to the point where
[1:27:34] they do that and it was their brothers
[1:27:36] must love your wife and be priest of
[1:27:38] your house
[1:27:39] and pray for your children and guide
[1:27:41] them and don't be wrong unto them we
[1:27:44] mean it and the brothers must do that
[1:27:47] if you don't do it you're not taking
[1:27:49] God's correction the only thing that you
[1:27:51] are not doing is that you are not
[1:27:52] getting angry where we can see you
[1:27:54] but you're not doing it so are you
[1:27:57] worshiping God in truth and in spirit I
[1:27:59] bet the truth is that you must do it but
[1:28:01] God tells you
[1:28:04] huh that's the wait you I must do it if
[1:28:06] I don't do it I'm not correctable
[1:28:09] and I must start to look at my waist
[1:28:11] right if we say the church is a place of
[1:28:15] worship and the deacons tells us
[1:28:18] that we must have church order
[1:28:21] not being legalistic and then we don't
[1:28:22] keep the church order
[1:28:24] we just go there at the back and talk
[1:28:26] another Beaver is still praying here yes
[1:28:31] huh
[1:28:33] he's still in the atmosphere so we must
[1:28:35] not those little things the prophet
[1:28:36] calls them to Loose Ends that we go we
[1:28:39] go and start to comfort ourselves and
[1:28:41] say oh no that's not bad
[1:28:43] what the brother no it's up to how I see
[1:28:45] it no take correction brother
[1:28:48] take Corrections sister when the when
[1:28:50] the Lord corrects you just like when he
[1:28:52] blesses you because God's correction is
[1:28:54] actually a blessing
[1:28:55] isn't it it's a blessing God is an honor
[1:28:58] to be corrected by God Amen who are you
[1:29:03] in politics in politics
[1:29:05] in closing in politics they say
[1:29:08] the you won't find another politician
[1:29:10] talking about another politician even if
[1:29:12] it's something that can benefit you know
[1:29:15] I
[1:29:15] a a cheap politician they can talk about
[1:29:18] other politics politics who will
[1:29:20] everything that politicians do must
[1:29:22] bring them higher
[1:29:24] if they criticize you
[1:29:26] must leave them up
[1:29:28] if there's something for them to benefit
[1:29:29] yeah yeah if they talk bad about you
[1:29:31] it's something that takes everything for
[1:29:33] them that's how the devil works
[1:29:36] right
[1:29:37] I don't know why I said that point but I
[1:29:40] wanted to show you that when God
[1:29:43] directs you be correctable right go and
[1:29:47] think about it
[1:29:48] do it because you are doing it in
[1:29:50] sincerity you are worshiping him in
[1:29:53] truth you are truth unto yourself you
[1:29:55] are truthful unto yourself you do what
[1:29:58] God says go do and you go and do and you
[1:30:01] read the word god talks to you learn to
[1:30:04] know when God talks to you amen
[1:30:07] may do up to so far but when God talks
[1:30:10] to you and directs you learn to be
[1:30:12] correctable to be pliable and go not
[1:30:15] only that go and do it to show God for
[1:30:19] that you are worshiping him in truth and
[1:30:22] in spirit then you will see the state of
[1:30:25] our church you will see our true
[1:30:27] inheritors we will see it coming to pass
[1:30:30] in our lives
[1:30:34] if you fail to take correction and your
[1:30:36] mistakes when God corrects you
[1:30:39] if you fail to do that that means you're
[1:30:41] never sincere in the first place wow
[1:30:44] you never God talks to you to correct
[1:30:46] and you're not correct were you ever
[1:30:48] sincere I don't believe so
[1:30:50] right and it says You must worship Him
[1:30:52] in truth truth is to be sincere with
[1:30:55] yourself first
[1:30:57] don't prevent the little small voice
[1:30:59] talking to you I mean it's not
[1:31:02] this is hard brothers and sisters I'm so
[1:31:04] sorry
[1:31:06] thank you
[1:31:08] Preacher Brother let's finish off with
[1:31:12] these people draw it nigh unto me with
[1:31:15] their mouth and honored me with their
[1:31:17] lips but their hearts are far from me
[1:31:19] the Lord said
[1:31:21] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:31:24] of doctrines and Commandments of men
[1:31:27] saying no brothers must do this must do
[1:31:29] this must do this but he go home but at
[1:31:31] the point he doesn't do it right
[1:31:34] what kind of a truth and and truth and
[1:31:36] spirit is this one but I can promise me
[1:31:38] the first one if he produce it he must
[1:31:41] be the first one to lead
[1:31:44] that's the truth sister wow isn't it
[1:31:47] when you sing a beautiful Chorus for us
[1:31:49] and we cry and we get blessed and we
[1:31:51] want to pick you up because we don't
[1:31:52] know what to do with you we are so
[1:31:54] blessed
[1:31:55] you must be the first one to lead it
[1:31:57] oh that's a challenge yeah
[1:32:00] sister while we are not challenging you
[1:32:02] I'm just trying to show you brothers and
[1:32:03] sisters that we must challenge ourselves
[1:32:06] about what God wants to fulfill in our
[1:32:09] lives you know and assess and say ah
[1:32:12] I've been here now I'm here thank you
[1:32:14] Lord but Lord I want to go more I want
[1:32:16] more land I want you to grow more in my
[1:32:19] life I want to take my position and I
[1:32:21] can do that by worshiping you in truth
[1:32:23] and in spirit
[1:32:25] I can do that and let's let's not be a
[1:32:29] dismissive defensive because those
[1:32:32] Spirits are demons oh yeah in this day
[1:32:34] and age they've become so subtle oh yeah
[1:32:37] that sometimes you don't even realize
[1:32:38] that ah happy day I was wrought over my
[1:32:40] brother for no reason Rose I was like
[1:32:43] Cain in other ways
[1:32:46] have mercy my father my savior and he
[1:32:50] worship God in spirit and in truth when
[1:32:51] you are in Christ Jesus that's God's
[1:32:54] plan for you to worship Him in Christ
[1:32:56] Jesus
[1:32:57] a man yes and that is this I mean that
[1:33:01] is chapter page 15.
[1:33:04] Romans 8 we know he did just just
[1:33:07] refreshing you
[1:33:09] there is therefore now no more
[1:33:11] condemnation
[1:33:13] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:33:16] there's no more
[1:33:17] that's that's that's for sure
[1:33:19] to them that I encourage Jesus to you
[1:33:21] who are in Christ Jesus there's no more
[1:33:23] condemnation why because that walk not
[1:33:27] after the flesh
[1:33:30] to walk after the place you know I just
[1:33:32] walk after the flesh
[1:33:34] to last after women and smoke is very
[1:33:37] clear that if those are flesh things
[1:33:40] I'm not talking about those
[1:33:42] I'm talking about things that are not
[1:33:44] easy to detect
[1:33:47] because remember that that thick that
[1:33:49] told you about it doesn't just sit there
[1:33:52] where you can see it and remove it now
[1:33:54] you stick to it to the skin sometimes
[1:33:55] you think it's just a little pimple
[1:33:59] it's just itchy you can just put
[1:34:01] Vaseline in just a shower
[1:34:04] you put Navy on a demo
[1:34:06] [Laughter]
[1:34:10] no no
[1:34:11] worshiping him in truth and in
[1:34:15] vest maybe you don't know
[1:34:19] I'm
[1:34:20] back you know so
[1:34:24] things of the flesh
[1:34:26] creepy more so brothers and sisters to
[1:34:30] us as believers they don't want to be
[1:34:32] visible they don't the devil when he
[1:34:34] comes he doesn't want to be seen and
[1:34:36] he'll come and hide the best he can
[1:34:38] that's right our job is to have more
[1:34:41] Spirit of the Lord yes to expose him our
[1:34:44] job is not to to go hunting and say no

[1:35:22] own self
[1:35:23] to a point where it may sometimes even
[1:35:26] it may even be difficult for us parents
[1:35:29] that before you even tell them the young
[1:35:31] ones you must be prayed up man you must
[1:35:34] be plater because that Spirit you're
[1:35:36] correcting a child on you may find that
[1:35:37] is actually on you
[1:35:39] I read it the prophet said somewhere
[1:35:41] you're praying for your child you want
[1:35:43] to kick him and everything you find the
[1:35:45] desperate is on you actually wow you are
[1:35:47] the cause wow
[1:35:49] I ready
[1:35:50] I can't remember where but please don't
[1:35:52] ask me to go find it
[1:35:54] but I read it
[1:35:56] so I must be prayed up to a point where
[1:35:58] when I say killer

[1:36:04] praying
[1:36:07] foreign have you read your Bible
[1:36:11] tonight
[1:36:13] come and I must behave in the spirit
[1:36:15] that read the Bible I must have ready
[1:36:18] don't tell me to live the life just
[1:36:21] leave it
[1:36:22] live the life
[1:36:24] don't tell others to leave it just leave
[1:36:27] it they leave it they leave it before
[1:36:30] you know it that button
[1:36:32] is a big water hey you know those
[1:36:36] battles for ladies for those big dresses
[1:36:38] heavy butter
[1:36:40] for those some of those jackets you know
[1:36:43] full
[1:36:44] the old jacket is taking 25 of the
[1:36:46] jacket
[1:36:47] one butter
[1:36:51] right the here the prophet says in the
[1:36:54] in the spoken word trying to do got a
[1:36:56] service without being his will
[1:36:59] in closing he says
[1:37:01] no matter how sincere
[1:37:03] what good motives what good objectives
[1:37:06] how people want these things and see the
[1:37:09] need for it there is a will of God
[1:37:12] to be carried out
[1:37:14] in these things we must always fulfill
[1:37:18] his will and his will is for him to be
[1:37:21] worshiped in truth and in spirit that's
[1:37:24] his will when we make decisions when we
[1:37:28] think families
[1:37:30] it must be God's will
[1:37:33] it must be God's will
[1:37:37] when we do things we mustn't just do
[1:37:40] them
[1:37:41] we must seek his will because I am a
[1:37:44] daughter and a son of God
[1:37:46] and I'm part of this bride therefore
[1:37:50] every decision
[1:37:51] everything about me and must I be
[1:37:55] encompassed by his will
[1:37:57] flesh how I walk
[1:38:00] how I address how I think how I eat you
[1:38:06] may not think it how I eat yes
[1:38:07] everything how you dress how you make up
[1:38:11] your hair my girl
[1:38:12] Diana
[1:38:14] I'm so sorry
[1:38:15] I like doing this to people but you know
[1:38:18] my weakness by nowhere and at least how
[1:38:21] you prove that brochure how you talk how
[1:38:24] how easy you get upset we don't get
[1:38:27] upset easily as believer we can but the
[1:38:31] Bible says the sun must not sit
[1:38:33] while you are still angry so if you get
[1:38:37] upset towards sunset be careful
[1:38:40] stop it before Sunset because the Bible
[1:38:42] says don't get be angry until this if
[1:38:45] you get in the morning it's fine
[1:38:51] by the time the sun set sister Megan
[1:38:53] you'll be okay
[1:38:55] but if I get upset from morning until ah
[1:38:58] until the sunset I'm still upset no no
[1:39:02] no but that time my love should have
[1:39:04] erased everything
[1:39:06] at that in the evening I should already
[1:39:09] be telling my boss God bless you
[1:39:11] see you tomorrow man you are such a
[1:39:13] wonderful guy meaning it not deceiving
[1:39:15] here
[1:39:16] meaning that he's a good man
[1:39:19] that one who said in the morning here
[1:39:21] you know if you don't do this we're
[1:39:22] going to fire you
[1:39:23] at that one
[1:39:25] she's the one I'm saying God bless you
[1:39:27] I must say you know what my brother
[1:39:29] must be the Lord who's directing you God
[1:39:32] bless you so much
[1:39:34] you know I wish I could bring you with
[1:39:35] me to Heaven meaning it
[1:39:37] that one who says I'm gonna fire you if
[1:39:39] you don't do this by next week this
[1:39:41] Statistics
[1:39:43] I'm sorry they don't say we're going to
[1:39:46] fire you they say um
[1:39:48] we are going to ask you to leave
[1:39:51] [Laughter]
[1:39:54] meaning that we are going to show you
[1:39:56] the door that one that's the one that
[1:39:58] when you come across him on the road
[1:40:00] hiking I must stop and give him a lift
[1:40:03] and driving at his house
[1:40:05] yes
[1:40:06] because I'm I'm different I'm an oddball
[1:40:08] I'm a Christian
[1:40:10] I can't do things the way the world does
[1:40:12] things the one who upsets you that's the
[1:40:15] one you must bring in here
[1:40:17] and help him truthfully with all your
[1:40:21] heart
[1:40:22] and a blessing if the Bible says bless
[1:40:25] your enemy how much more about your
[1:40:27] brother right the Bible says your enemy
[1:40:29] when he's hungry give you food how much
[1:40:32] more about your sister and your brother
[1:40:34] the person who's called by the name of
[1:40:36] God just that he's got a weakness or
[1:40:38] she's got a weakness you want to be
[1:40:40] upset with him
[1:40:42] my sister
[1:40:43] don't see my brother that one
[1:40:47] you know butter him decide and decide
[1:40:51] you know butter when you ask me that
[1:40:54] should I put your butter at this side
[1:40:56] and this side
[1:40:58] I said I think that's a strange question
[1:41:00] how can you ask me that question
[1:41:03] Pata only goes on one side
[1:41:06] you're finishing butter
[1:41:07] if you hear him asking that which means
[1:41:09] he he himself his butter is amazing
[1:41:15] we are done
[1:41:17] I mean to say
[1:41:19] our love must be so strong
[1:41:21] to one another and we must be
[1:41:24] correctable yes
[1:41:25] yes and we
[1:41:29] must not use anything of this world no
[1:41:32] Act of action or anything or coming to
[1:41:35] church will ever make you worship God
[1:41:37] truthfully
[1:41:39] those are actions that are of the flesh
[1:41:42] they only confirms who we are but they
[1:41:45] are not it's not the other way around we
[1:41:47] don't do them to pray that we are
[1:41:49] Christians no no no no no no we they
[1:41:51] happen because we are Christians that we
[1:41:54] worship Him in truth and the spirit and
[1:41:56] they automatically happen we don't do
[1:41:58] them first then we we satisfy ourselves
[1:42:01] just coming to church alone just being a
[1:42:04] member of shakana Tawana just paying tax
[1:42:06] pay your tithes but that's to pay test
[1:42:09] does not mean that you you have made it
[1:42:12] but pay your tax please this church
[1:42:13] needs your ties to survive there is not
[1:42:15] actually your money the money is not
[1:42:18] yours it's for the Lord
[1:42:20] and he says you wrote me you
[1:42:23] you wrote me
[1:42:25] I must look for that verse that says if
[1:42:27] you don't give tithes when you bring it
[1:42:29] it must come with five percent I must
[1:42:30] find that scripture
[1:42:32] you know it
[1:42:34] I don't mean to scare you I just mean
[1:42:37] prioritize on time
[1:42:40] because it's not yours
[1:42:42] is God's money
[1:42:44] because after all he gave you the job
[1:42:46] he can take the job he can give an
[1:42:48] increase so just don't count it as yours
[1:42:50] simple as agency
[1:42:52] so I didn't write here honestly I didn't
[1:42:54] write here about ties I'm just trying to
[1:42:56] motivate you that the Lord wants us to
[1:43:00] worship Him in truth and in spirit and
[1:43:02] the truth is everything of the word of
[1:43:05] God
[1:43:06] the thing oh all things
[1:43:08] that's what he means
[1:43:11] please let's get on our feet
[1:43:14] God bless you richly if I was hurt
[1:43:16] please I feel somehow that I was a bit
[1:43:18] hard
[1:43:19] and
[1:43:21] not the Brotherhood that you are used to
[1:43:24] if that's the case I would like you to
[1:43:26] please before we
[1:43:27] just forgive me just find you somewhere
[1:43:30] to forgive me
[1:43:31] because I love you and I mean I love you
[1:43:35] with the love of the Lord and and I
[1:43:39] think the prophet felt the same
[1:43:41] but he said you know it's because I love
[1:43:43] you if I don't love you the sign that I
[1:43:46] don't love you is when I don't tell you
[1:43:48] if you hear me not telling you the truth
[1:43:51] and I just keep quiet who cares I don't
[1:43:54] love you I lie
[1:43:56] because I love you it's because I'll be
[1:43:59] free to say Brother Bear my friend you
[1:44:02] know you're wrong
[1:44:03] ah you must call me Big Brother when you
[1:44:06] talk to me
[1:44:09] if I correct him like that I mean I love
[1:44:11] him
[1:44:14] this is not a place to joke let's just
[1:44:16] get a song and bring invite the
[1:44:18] musicians to come
[1:44:20] and then
[1:44:22] we're just going to Worship the Lord and
[1:44:25] give him all the honor and just close
[1:44:28] our eyes and be reverent
[1:44:30] just going to be reverent and worship
[1:44:33] him in truth and his Spirit from our
[1:44:35] heart
[1:44:36] and just just pass for a second and
[1:44:40] close your eyes
[1:44:43] and just let
[1:44:44] one thing occupy your mind just for a
[1:44:46] second
[1:44:48] what God did for you
[1:44:50] you see when he was at the cross
[1:44:53] it was the most painful
[1:44:56] painful
[1:44:58] event
[1:44:59] it was so painful because
[1:45:01] we only see what is happening on the
[1:45:04] flesh
[1:45:06] but actually there was way more pain
[1:45:10] much more catastrophe that was happening
[1:45:14] in the spiritual Realm
[1:45:16] his Spirit was tortured
[1:45:18] so much
[1:45:21] what you see on the flesh
[1:45:25] is little
[1:45:27] that is why when he was at the Garden of
[1:45:28] Gethsemane he sweated
[1:45:30] the Bible says he even sweated blood
[1:45:32] there was too much pressure
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:36] so what do you think about that
[1:45:39] and you think about him hanging at the
[1:45:41] cross you know people think that he died
[1:45:44] because that blood and and they broke
[1:45:46] his bone by hanging him on the cross the
[1:45:48] the Romans were actually killing you by
[1:45:51] suffocating you you know they know when
[1:45:53] they're hanging you like that and then
[1:45:55] your body weight goes down and the lungs
[1:45:57] and every the diaphragm are blocked you
[1:45:59] can't breathe you suffocate
[1:46:01] it was the most painful death
[1:46:04] with within of the whole world upon his
[1:46:07] shoulder
[1:46:08] and a person like that why would he
[1:46:11] leave heaven
[1:46:13] because he loved you
[1:46:15] love is such a powerful force he did it
[1:46:18] because he loved you
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:24] that's a song that says leaving he loved
