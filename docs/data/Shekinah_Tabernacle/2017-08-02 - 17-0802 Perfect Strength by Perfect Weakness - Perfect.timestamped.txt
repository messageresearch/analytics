[24:43] verses 33 down to verse 38 Hebrews 11 33
[24:55] to 38 who through faith subdued kingdoms
[24:59] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[25:01] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[25:05] violence of fire escaped edge of the
[25:07] sword out of weakness were made strong I
[25:10] want you to remember that phrase out of
[25:12] weakness were made strong waxed valiant
[25:14] in fight turned to flight the armies of
[25:16] the aliens woman received their dead
[25:19] raised to life again and others were
[25:20] tortured not accepting deliverance that
[25:23] they might obtain a better resurrection
[25:24] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[25:27] and scourgings j moreover in bonds and
[25:29] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[25:31] sawn asunder with tempted were slain
[25:33] with the sword wandered about in
[25:35] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[25:37] afflicted tormented of whom the world
[25:41] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[25:44] and in mountains and in sorry Ana
[25:46] Mountains and dens and caves of the
[25:48] earth let's just keep going of these all
[25:50] having obtained a good report through
[25:51] faith received not the promise God
[25:54] having provided some better thing for us
[25:57] that they without us should not be made
[26:00] perfect a minutes go to Ezekiel chapter
[26:03] 28 if I have it here now we just read
[26:09] through weakness was made strong we're
[26:14] gonna read about of being that it's very
[26:18] different
[26:20] Ezekiel 28 and we're gonna read from
[26:25] verse 14 just to just to you guys go
[26:31] read the whole chapter but we're just
[26:33] gonna read here from let's go read from
[26:35] verse 13 there's been an Eden the garden
[26:40] of God the speaking of Lucifer every
[26:42] precious stone was thy covering so
[26:45] zekiel 28 verse 13 the saddest Topaz the
[26:48] die
[26:49] the barrel the ox and the Jasper and the
[26:51] SS for sapphire and emerald and the
[26:54] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[26:57] thy temperance and my pipes was prepared
[26:59] in thee in the day that thou was created
[27:01] thou art the anointed cherub that
[27:02] covereth and I've set thee so there was
[27:05] upon the holy mountain of God thou hast
[27:07] walked up and down in the midst of the
[27:09] stones of fire there was perfect in thy
[27:11] ways from the days that thou was created
[27:14] till iniquity was found in thee by the
[27:16] multitude of by merchandise they have
[27:19] filled the mitts of thee with violence
[27:21] and thou has sinned therefore I'll cast
[27:23] thee as profaned out of the mountain of
[27:26] God I will destroy the Oh covering
[27:30] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[27:32] fire thine heart was lifted up because
[27:34] of our beauty thou has corrupted thy
[27:37] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[27:40] of their brightness
[27:41] I will cast thee to the ground I will
[27:44] lay thee before Kings that they may
[27:47] behold thee thou has defile defiled the
[27:50] sanctuaries by the multitude of our
[27:52] iniquities by the iniquity of by traffic
[27:55] therefore will I bring forth a fire from
[27:57] the mitts of the each other via shall
[27:59] devour thee and I'll bring me to ashes
[28:02] upon the earth and the sight of all them
[28:04] to behold thee all they that know the
[28:06] among the people shall be astonished at
[28:08] thee thou shalt be a terror and shalt
[28:11] never and never shalt thou be anymore
[28:15] amen may the Lord blesses word you may
[28:18] have your seats tonight now we read two
[28:21] very conflicted to very difficult
[28:24] conflicting is not the right word but
[28:25] two different kind of scriptures we read
[28:28] there and in Hebrews chapter 11 where
[28:31] Paul is writing the account of of the
[28:33] heroes of faith and we understand that
[28:36] should the Bible continue being written
[28:38] down into our day that your name would
[28:40] have been in there too because the same
[28:42] they had to overcome as the same faith
[28:44] you have received amen and so but you
[28:47] see he said out of weakness was made
[28:49] strong and they were they were yo
[28:52] destitute are in caves and death and no
[28:54] wonder and sheep skins tormented
[28:56] afflicted you know be said of the open
[28:59] the world is not worthy so these
[29:02] we're incredible people but then if we
[29:04] would have met them they would have been
[29:06] just like us they were as the Bible
[29:08] would say that Elijah was a man of like
[29:11] passion so they were not a different
[29:13] kind of people like us but they were
[29:14] exactly like us you know you know if we
[29:17] saw Elijah we would have seen a guy with
[29:19] it you know he would have knew he's a
[29:20] man wilderness there was nothing much of
[29:23] him to really look about they'd say this
[29:24] is an amazing prophet you know he had a
[29:27] big beard a yo pie thank you much you
[29:30] know he looked like an ordinary kind of
[29:33] guy but yet he was a prophet of God and
[29:36] God would come and anoint his life and
[29:39] God would what would reveal himself
[29:41] mightily in Israel you know through his
[29:43] through his ministry and and he would
[29:45] take a chariot ride one day hallelujah
[29:47] so something very special about him you
[29:51] know in that regard but humanly he was a
[29:53] person like us he got angry at a bunch
[29:55] of children and used this gift maybe I'm
[29:57] mixing Elijah and Elijah but you know he
[30:00] used his gift and he cursed those those
[30:02] children and 42 children were killed by
[30:04] some sheep is yeah because he cursed
[30:06] them and you know Elijah would call down
[30:08] fire out of heaven and devour you know
[30:10] you're a captain it is 50 with fire and
[30:12] then another 15 yo you know with fire
[30:15] and so you know he was a man and I'm
[30:18] saying these things because we look at
[30:21] ourselves and here we are in these
[30:24] bodies and we know our human weaknesses
[30:27] and we know our personalities and we
[30:30] know our quirks and we know you know
[30:32] just our little things that we don't
[30:34] like about ourselves God but yet God
[30:40] when he looks at you he doesn't look at
[30:42] your human frailty he doesn't look at
[30:44] your weakness he doesn't look at the
[30:46] things that you can't stand yourself he
[30:49] sees deity in people he sees his
[30:52] children hallelujah
[30:55] and it you think about it you know as
[30:57] the Bible would say in first Corinthians
[31:01] chapter chapter 6 and verse 19 Paul is
[31:05] telling the church what know you not
[31:08] that your body is the temple of the Holy
[31:10] Ghost which is in you which ye have of
[31:13] God and ye are not your own
[31:15] for year but with a price therefore
[31:17] glorify God in your body and in your
[31:20] spirit which are gods so he was telling
[31:23] these people and they were fighting they
[31:25] had been got carnal with what ministry
[31:27] they preferred one is of Paul one's of
[31:29] Cephas ones of Christ they begin to know
[31:32] and their carnality they would rally
[31:34] around humanly what they thought was the
[31:37] best ministry they fussed and fought and
[31:39] they were all out of water and but yet
[31:41] Paul would tell them but do you not know
[31:44] ye are the Temple of the Living God ye
[31:47] are the dwelling place of the Most High
[31:49] the very creator of heavens and earth
[31:51] dwells in you I mean but if we went and
[31:54] saw them in that day they would look
[31:56] like any other Greek people or whatever
[31:58] nationality they would like anyone else
[32:01] on the street you know they would have
[32:03] worn the same kind of robes that the
[32:04] other people would have worn maybe some
[32:06] people dressed more modestly than him I
[32:09] don't know your the robe would have
[32:10] looked all the same but what I'm trying
[32:11] to say is they would have looked you
[32:13] probably couldn't have picked them out
[32:14] in the crowd you following me they would
[32:17] have looked all the same to the rest of
[32:19] the Greek people amen but they had God
[32:21] in them it was a very different kind of
[32:24] thing they meant they was a dwelling
[32:26] place of the Living God and it's the
[32:28] same thing with the believer today you
[32:31] know Satan does not understand you say
[32:34] thinker's nada cannot understand how God
[32:37] could have such mercy and such grace
[32:40] upon a fallen decrepit human beings like
[32:44] we are hallelujah he does not understand
[32:47] it because when he was made he was made
[32:49] perfect amen he was his iniquity and
[32:52] nick word is found in his heart because
[32:54] of his beauty and because of his life as
[32:56] we just read there in ezekiel he was
[32:58] made perfect but yet God does not could
[33:01] not dwell in someone like that
[33:03] I mean God cannot dwell in something
[33:05] like that God comes down and and fallen
[33:08] humanity and takes and takes the dust of
[33:12] the earth as it were as we are amen and
[33:14] would dwell in those people and God
[33:17] would dwell in that and he can't you
[33:19] know which is a contrast to what Lucifer
[33:21] thinks he should dwell in a meant a
[33:24] Lucifer ism Beauty he's and he's and
[33:26] great things you go look at thee you
[33:28] know
[33:29] whose feed the st. Peters there and
[33:31] there in the Vatican has anyone been
[33:33] there it's a beautiful place I imagine
[33:37] incredible you can't put a value to it
[33:39] you know you couldn't insure that thing
[33:41] good luck trying to insure it you can't
[33:44] do it it's priceless
[33:45] because that's what Satan thinks is
[33:47] beauty that's what Satan thinks today
[33:49] you know that a church should look like
[33:51] a mint but yet God God doesn't dwell on
[33:56] that kind of a place God isn't
[33:58] interested in that kind of worship I
[34:00] mean God is looking for people that have
[34:03] been blood washed I'm in that a redeemed
[34:05] I mean they can worship Him not out of
[34:07] not out of some skill of singing or
[34:10] music only I mean but out of her but out
[34:12] of a redeemed heart where they have a
[34:14] revelation god you're my Redeemer god
[34:17] you're my king god you're my bridegroom
[34:19] god you're my all and all you're my
[34:21] shepherd I mean you're my blood you're
[34:23] my offering in my priest hallelujah he's
[34:26] looking for people about of out of that
[34:28] kind of heart
[34:29] oh now the people down through the Bible
[34:33] you take Moses Moses was had an
[34:35] incredible life you know you read the
[34:37] life of Moses and you see the incredible
[34:39] things that God that I'm basically just
[34:41] gonna repeat myself down through this
[34:43] this is where I'm going with this sermon
[34:45] this is the outline we take the fallen
[34:47] humanity of the believer show incredible
[34:49] things that God did in their life but
[34:51] yet show their their their their their
[34:53] their failings because we put them on a
[34:56] pedestal and in a way we should because
[34:58] God manifested in their lives but yet we
[35:01] we somehow can think in our lives I can
[35:03] never be like those people how can I be
[35:06] with me tonight
[35:07] is this all right it means you take
[35:09] Moses and you think what an incredible
[35:11] thing would be to be a to be to be a
[35:14] one-man invasion down into the greatest
[35:17] greatest nation there at the time which
[35:19] was Egypt the world power and he and he
[35:21] goes and he says let my people go and he
[35:24] demands that that Pharaoh give up the
[35:26] people of God and the thing is he
[35:28] invaded and he was successful I mean he
[35:30] didn't take any damage he didn't you
[35:33] know he just went in and demanded it
[35:34] then he said Pharisee I'll not let them
[35:36] go says well I'm gonna plague your
[35:37] kingdom and I'm gonna plague your
[35:39] kingdom and darkness is going to come on
[35:41] your kingdom in death is going to come
[35:42] on you
[35:43] kingdom and then you have to let them go
[35:45] amen that's exactly what happened then
[35:47] they come down to the Red Sea God guided
[35:49] them down there to their place of the
[35:50] Red Sea and then and then and then Moses
[35:54] would say say were say these words of
[35:57] thee you see these Egyptians today
[36:00] you'll see them no more forever he said
[36:02] it but then he but then he begins to ask
[36:05] God what am I going to do have you even
[36:08] been down that place amen
[36:11] I'm gonna take a rapture all my family
[36:13] is coming we're gonna walk out of here
[36:15] victorious then Lord what's going to
[36:16] happen
[36:17] help me hello amen
[36:20] and then God says speak why Christ speak
[36:24] move forward and speak I mean so he
[36:26] lifted up a staff at a Red Sea parted
[36:28] they crossed over us on dry ground all
[36:31] of Israel was over a young old cattle
[36:34] whatever they took with them overthrew
[36:36] and then they turned around the
[36:37] Egyptians tried to follow them
[36:39] Moses raised up a staff whatever he do
[36:41] and they and the seaweeds back where it
[36:43] was and all their enemy was destroyed
[36:45] hallelujah that's incredible were you
[36:48] thinking about Majan imagine being near
[36:49] that day there'd be amazing thing to see
[36:52] and so here he was anointed and brother
[36:55] Branham says I don't just have the place
[36:57] but when you're Moses he would stand
[37:00] there say thus saith the Lord he began
[37:01] to speak it wasn't him speaking but then
[37:04] the inspiration left him and he was
[37:05] Moses again amen and then God would have
[37:08] to began thus saith the Lord such and
[37:10] such and such and then the inspiration
[37:12] left him and then he was Moses again and
[37:15] here we are but he say well I'm not a
[37:18] prophet God God commissioned him for a
[37:22] job I've heard the cries of my people I
[37:25] have come down he says I've heard the
[37:28] cries of my people that I'm sending you
[37:29] and it was God coming down and into his
[37:32] prophet to go deliver his people and
[37:34] then Moses will begin to make excuses I
[37:37] can't speak you know I can't do this job
[37:40] and here we are here we are we've been
[37:43] commissioned to do a job have we know
[37:46] not to be a prophet like Moses but we're
[37:49] commissioned to be the Bride of Christ I
[37:51] mean to administer mercy I mean
[37:54] pardoning grace to this world
[37:56] hey men everything Jesus died for we are
[37:59] to administer to this world because God
[38:01] uses his body you say well that's just a
[38:04] bit far-fetched no it's not far-fetched
[38:06] yeah on the day of Pentecost God came
[38:09] and dwelt in his body he he redeemed the
[38:11] euro He shed his blood upon the earth of
[38:13] Calvary for the sins of the world and
[38:15] then he came and dwelt in his body and
[38:17] the upper room he gets to speak the
[38:19] words of life through his body amen so
[38:22] the so what was purchased that down
[38:24] Calvary was now administered through the
[38:26] body angel goes through Cornelius go to
[38:29] Joppa you'll find Simon Peter in a
[38:31] certain house come get him and he'll
[38:34] tell you the woods of eternal life
[38:36] I mean so they go get Simon Peter it
[38:38] comes to a Cornelius house they have a
[38:40] meeting and while you Peter spake these
[38:42] words the Holy Ghost fell upon me why
[38:44] didn't the angel just give them me you
[38:46] know the Holy Ghost he couldn't because
[38:47] God uses his body amen so now here's
[38:51] Moses and then incredible things happen
[38:54] but yet after car after the inspiration
[38:58] leaves him he's just Moses again and if
[39:01] you looked at Moses he's thinking about
[39:04] he comes an 80 year old man he's a
[39:07] shepherd on the backside of the desert
[39:09] and here he comes into customs I'll
[39:12] bring it young what are you here for
[39:14] what's the purpose of visit invasion
[39:16] other he writes invasion okay you can go
[39:20] through some reason and let him through
[39:21] if you looked at them it'd just be an 80
[39:24] year old man what's so special about
[39:26] this man what's so special about you
[39:30] what are you looking at when you look in
[39:32] the mirror what are you looking at when
[39:34] you look at yourself and in your mind
[39:36] you tele up this is my good my strengths
[39:39] and my weaknesses what are you looking
[39:41] at and yet he lived a life you look at
[39:47] Moses he lived such a life he could
[39:50] change the mind of God God says I'm
[39:52] gonna wipe out Israel I'll start with
[39:54] you
[39:54] throws himself on the and the
[39:56] breech-block my name out don't block
[39:58] their name out amen
[40:00] think about it this is the kind of life
[40:02] a powerful life a man powerful life even
[40:05] even when even when he was angry you
[40:08] know he didn't do what God told him
[40:09] did speak to the rock Oh bring forth
[40:11] water has already been split knee got
[40:13] angry he bunch of rebels do I have to
[40:15] bring forth water and glorified himself
[40:16] but yet the water came forth amen
[40:20] incredible life you think about it but
[40:22] he was just an ordinary man yes Caleb
[40:25] Caleb was a slave he was a slave he's 84
[40:30] years old he's standing before Joshua
[40:32] he's followed this ministry for maybe 44
[40:36] odd years I don't know how long it was
[40:37] 40 years in the wilderness I don't know
[40:39] how he was old he was when he came out
[40:41] of Egypt but he's been following this
[40:43] this message he's 84 years old
[40:46] he doesn't look - he doesn't look all
[40:49] that so great about him you know if we
[40:52] look if we saw him he just been ordinary
[40:54] I'm gonna repeat this if you know why
[40:56] you're opinio I want to emphasize this
[40:58] because we look at ourselves we don't
[41:02] see too much you got to look again you
[41:04] know because if you look at yourself the
[41:07] devil will inspire you you think you
[41:09] you're it
[41:10] do you think you're redeemed you think
[41:12] you're gonna you think you're an
[41:14] overcomer you think you're gonna sit on
[41:16] his throne as he sat down on his
[41:18] Father's throne you think you're going
[41:20] to take a rapture you think you're
[41:22] really in the promised land possessing
[41:23] your land you really think that and if
[41:26] and if you allow your mind to go down
[41:28] that kind of way you just look at your
[41:30] failings and you'll devalue yourself
[41:32] because the devil wants you to think
[41:35] very less about yourself he doesn't want
[41:37] you to think about you how God thinks
[41:40] about you remember the Bible says
[41:42] there'll be a day that we will know as
[41:44] we are knowing right that we you shall
[41:46] know as you are known that says in
[41:48] Corinthians so there has to come a day
[41:50] where you know as God knows you that's
[41:53] what that scripture says and this is the
[41:55] day where we know as we are knowing
[41:57] so what God sees about us we know what
[41:59] he says we know what he thinks about us
[42:02] are you with me I mean so that's why you
[42:04] don't look at your humanity cuz you'll
[42:06] begin to yo you'll begin to belittle
[42:08] yourself and it will go from one minute
[42:11] I'm going to take a rapture just now -
[42:13] maybe I'm in the wilderness
[42:15] then rdf:li back in Egypt and all god
[42:18] help me I'm a sinner I'm lost
[42:22] how we doing everyone why what's
[42:25] happened because you've been devalued in
[42:27] your own mind but that's not what God
[42:29] thinks about you God says you're bone of
[42:32] my bone your flesh of my flesh your life
[42:35] of my life your spirit of my spirit your
[42:37] power my power she has hidden the
[42:39] prophecies I'm in the brightest him
[42:42] because husband or wife become one
[42:44] hallelujah and he put you above his own
[42:47] life amen he put you at the greater
[42:50] value than his own blood and he didn't
[42:53] hesitate he wink
[42:54] for this cause I've come hallelujah
[42:58] Heaton had to be dragged up Calvary he
[43:00] went up Calvary he says nobody to take
[43:03] my life from me I lay it down and if I
[43:05] let down oh I'll take it back up again
[43:07] he with me hallelujah he knew the reason
[43:12] NS is the joy the joy that was set
[43:15] before him hello who's what's that joy
[43:19] you're the joy here's my redeemed ones
[43:23] it's gonna be glorious day that day up
[43:25] there
[43:26] here come the redeemed ones we say here
[43:28] we are Lord we've been redeemed
[43:30] hallelujah here comes my precious ones
[43:33] hallelujah he comes my victorious ones
[43:35] oh yeah there's not pie in the sky you
[43:40] have to place yourself you say well what
[43:42] does God think of me how's your day I
[43:44] had a terrible day but what does God
[43:45] think of me
[43:46] has he weekly and I've had a terrible
[43:48] week but what does God think of me I
[43:50] just keep going with the time frame but
[43:52] what does God think of me we just let's
[43:54] take a trip to the plains of memory is a
[43:56] is a is a couple there they'd be mad for
[43:59] a very long time they just had their
[44:01] names changed once will they ever have
[44:03] once called Sara if we went there we'd
[44:06] see basically what we'd call these days
[44:08] as nomads a bunch of tents up on the
[44:10] yeah you know on the plains cattle
[44:13] servants it was actually quite a big
[44:15] place because the armed is service is
[44:18] about 300 odd servants they armed - go -
[44:21] go get lot and this family back is quite
[44:22] a big settlement and we would walk then
[44:25] and we think this really and then maybe
[44:28] we would go over to another cross the
[44:31] river to another plane and would find
[44:33] another seal
[44:34] quite similar they may be with juni
[44:37] another place would find people who look
[44:38] pretty similar to them as well so what
[44:41] made them special cuz humanely Abraham
[44:44] and Sarah they just looked like without
[44:46] turn young again you see but humanly
[44:49] they didn't look all that different but
[44:51] here was he was the father of the faith
[44:54] he was the father of the faith amen out
[44:58] of him hallelujah the promised one's
[45:02] gonna come now Isaac wasn't the promise
[45:04] were after the flesh he was but the real
[45:05] Promised One was Christ amen and so if
[45:09] we looked at him we'd say there's
[45:10] nothing special about about you but
[45:12] Abraham could stand up saying I'll tell
[45:14] you something God has said I'm his
[45:16] friend hallelujah he's changed my name
[45:20] hey man he's changed my wife's name as
[45:22] well holy he called me out of Babylon he
[45:26] called me out of there he's brought me
[45:28] to this land he says I'm gonna possess
[45:30] this land and humanly you'd say you're
[45:32] crazy
[45:34] Alleluia but he wasn't crazy right hello
[45:38] you look at you we're we're quite
[45:42] ordinary looking people Amen we're very
[45:46] ordinary looking people we don't we
[45:48] don't fly around on private jets we
[45:51] don't have big mansions
[45:52] we don't own islands and and wanting to
[45:55] travel in this you know build spacecraft
[45:57] and travel into space and you know we
[45:59] don't do we don't do those kind of
[46:01] things we look like just anyone
[46:03] yeah but yet brother Bram said the
[46:06] difference Abraham was no just an
[46:08] ordinary man but Thurman says God called
[46:10] him and that makes a difference and he
[46:12] got a F
[46:13] yo if he called the father of the faith
[46:15] you call the children I mean some
[46:18] trustees called you hallelujah
[46:21] leave this place leave this country
[46:23] doesn't come back geographical location
[46:25] leave this place leave this sin leave
[46:28] this darkness and I'll take you to a
[46:30] land I'll take you to an inheritance
[46:32] hallelujah place you in a land a place
[46:35] in an inheritance
[46:36] hallelujah glory to God amen and he left
[46:41] and there he was and then this three men
[46:45] walking he's sitting there on the plains
[46:47] of memory
[46:48] waiting for the promise to come we're
[46:50] waiting for a promise to come amen
[46:52] it's gonna happen assurance those three
[46:54] men came walking to him that night
[46:56] olia why am i smiling cuz I know it's
[46:58] gonna happen early amen and he was then
[47:02] he saw three men walking they look like
[47:05] ordinary men they didn't they weren't
[47:08] great big Joe angelic kind of white
[47:11] ropes and something extra they would
[47:13] just they just look like you and I
[47:15] because God put on flesh but one was God
[47:18] and Abraham knew it was God for the sick
[47:22] because he had seen him before he saw
[47:24] him as Melchizedek he saw him your he
[47:27] seen him before
[47:28] that's why he didn't say he didn't say
[47:31] the three of them was God he said one of
[47:32] them was hallelujah amen they look like
[47:37] ordinary men but here comes the promise
[47:38] walking down the promise came she is
[47:41] according to time of life time of life
[47:44] speaks of a woman not a man according to
[47:46] time of life you're going to have the
[47:47] promised son hallelujah and you know
[47:50] there is a story see her lost within
[47:52] herself and you know her has discerned
[47:54] and you know and it's just a few
[47:56] chapters later she's holding a baby
[47:59] hallelujah they just look like ordinary
[48:01] men now
[48:03] King David it says that here's a little
[48:06] ruddy fellow when he when he came up
[48:10] against Goliath he was just an ordinary
[48:12] man he was just like you and I but the
[48:16] difference was he'd been anointed by
[48:18] vindicated prophet he was anointed by
[48:21] the prophet of the age hallelujah and
[48:23] all the Horn of anointing all was poured
[48:25] out upon him not just a measure by the
[48:28] fullness hallelujah and we have come to
[48:31] the same David his own father didn't
[48:34] consider himself then consider David to
[48:37] be the future king of Israel he wasn't
[48:39] even invited when the Prophet came to
[48:42] his house do you have another son says
[48:44] Samuel and Jesse says oh yeah I do he's
[48:47] out there in the field why wasn't he
[48:49] there because Jesse didn't think he
[48:51] would be king and here's the king God
[48:53] tells Samuel and Jesse's house I have a
[48:55] king for my people and Jesse humanly
[48:58] didn't even consider maybe or maybe it's
[49:00] David
[49:02] of course it was David oh yeah
[49:05] the ones who look like they'd be king
[49:07] God sit no no no no was the eighth son I
[49:11] don't know I I'm not sure where is
[49:14] where's David Isis he's out there
[49:16] looking out the Sheep they bring him in
[49:18] God says this is the one and maybe I
[49:21] don't know what his brothers would have
[49:22] thought hmm they see Samuel take out the
[49:26] Horde of anointing oil pour it over his
[49:28] head
[49:29] I see the Spirit of God was with him
[49:31] from that day on he looked like an
[49:33] ordinary mint imagine going when when
[49:35] when David this is a few years later
[49:37] David's on the run David's on the run
[49:40] from from Saul he fled into the
[49:42] wilderness and it says all that were
[49:44] discontented and debt and you're all
[49:47] those things they gathered themselves to
[49:49] David imagine going to that camp you go
[49:53] to a cave somewhere I don't know where
[49:54] they hid there some kind of catch and he
[49:57] see this guy come out and they wouldn't
[50:00] have been dressed up they didn't look
[50:01] like Saul and his men in the palace
[50:02] that's for sure
[50:03] it had been rugged looking carrying
[50:05] their stuff on their backs whatever you
[50:07] know maybe a beard out like this I don't
[50:10] know what they wouldn't have looked all
[50:11] that fancy but there was something there
[50:16] was something about David that caused
[50:18] people together and people gather to
[50:21] David because they believed he was
[50:24] coming into power they knew he was
[50:27] coming into power they knew that that
[50:29] anointing that was poured out upon him
[50:31] by the Prophet I mean that he was going
[50:33] to be king would become manifest one day
[50:35] that he was going to sit upon the throne
[50:37] with a crown on his head amen and that's
[50:40] the same thing you know you just look I
[50:42] was I was standing out the back there
[50:44] thinking about this I singing this is
[50:47] just a building you just take any Church
[50:50] any any believers church ultimately it's
[50:52] just a building it doesn't even compare
[50:55] to the great churches of the world even
[50:59] you take the finest message church you
[51:01] could find doesn't even pale in
[51:03] comparison to to half the things I'm
[51:06] just like this used to be an adult
[51:08] disability Center
[51:11] there's really nothing pretty about this
[51:14] place at all at all amen but yet God and
[51:19] we've just put some chairs out you know
[51:21] we've just whatever and God meets us
[51:23] here and that's like any church anywhere
[51:26] it was a building they would have
[51:27] inspired to builder to renovate it
[51:29] whatever more it doesn't look that
[51:31] amazing to the to the outside world but
[51:34] yet the the true and living God dips
[51:36] into that place and he takes people of
[51:39] fallible flesh
[51:41] hallelujah redeems them makes them in as
[51:44] image gathers them holy respect heaven
[51:47] comes down when God's people gather
[51:50] hallelujah so they saw David these men
[51:53] said we believe is coming into power
[51:55] hallelujah they didn't look anything
[51:57] special either but yet an anointing came
[52:00] upon them I mean that the great warriors
[52:02] of the world wish they had just a little
[52:04] teaspoon off well they one of them
[52:06] killed hundreds of men few of them did
[52:09] it
[52:09] amen David just had a desire wish I
[52:12] could drink from the wells of Bethlehem
[52:14] and they until them or threes I think
[52:17] three of them said let's go get him a
[52:19] drink oh yeah and they cut their waist
[52:22] down through the Philistine garrison it
[52:23] was not a choreographed Hollywood battle
[52:27] amen then looked really cool they just
[52:30] slugged it through they slugged it back
[52:31] whatever they had to do there was a
[52:33] bunch of dead bodies anyone who got any
[52:35] way was killed because they wanted to
[52:37] meet the desire of their King hallelujah
[52:40] and here we are friends here we are the
[52:43] devil wants to hold us back from real
[52:45] spiritual worship he wants to hold us
[52:47] back from a real spiritual walk with God
[52:49] cut through every enemy I mean you have
[52:53] a weapon you have a sword and never gets
[52:56] blood hello a man is trying to make a
[52:58] life that will never go blunt we have
[53:00] won hallelujah and never goes blood and
[53:03] always finds the killing place
[53:06] hallelujah
[53:07] so cut through brother Brandon says oh
[53:09] you Bethlehem Amen are you you ones that
[53:13] have gathered yourself Sir David you
[53:14] know he's coming into power cut yourself
[53:17] through every Philistine garrison a bit
[53:19] of unbelieving formalism all these
[53:21] things and
[53:22] fresh pentecostal drink Alleluia and
[53:26] David comes to power and these mighty
[53:28] men to get them he makes them hit over
[53:31] Cities Alleluia amen
[53:35] here comes you think of we could just go
[53:39] through all the believers he comes
[53:41] take him Solomon and reality he wouldn't
[53:44] look like sure he his head as wealth and
[53:46] all these things but humanly he just
[53:47] would look like anyone else but he's
[53:50] inspired he takes the instructions of
[53:53] his father build the temple and he
[53:55] stirred up he builds the temple this
[53:59] didn't happen the second time they built
[54:01] the temple amen
[54:03] builds the temple you look at the temple
[54:06] in reality it wasn't from the outside
[54:08] the temple is not some big grand thing
[54:11] that we humanly would think it should be
[54:13] have you ever looked at just what people
[54:16] think the temple looked like go on
[54:18] google and google the temple and go
[54:20] images aim has anyone done that this is
[54:24] the interactive part of the service yes
[54:26] we normally always have one these days
[54:28] just see as if one here it doesn't look
[54:31] that great it's far bigger temples that
[54:34] that other religions have had built but
[54:37] yet there's something very different
[54:39] about this temple hallelujah and God use
[54:43] fallible man God used men with failings
[54:47] you take the body of Christ you take the
[54:50] body the redeemed body from Genesis down
[54:52] to now there's failings there's this
[54:55] there's complexes there's there's
[54:58] brokenness
[54:59] there's hurt there's pain there's
[55:03] differences in opinion is different
[55:06] personalities all different kinds of
[55:08] things but yet they are manifesting God
[55:11] for their age hallelujah so he builds
[55:15] the temple
[55:16] God comes and fills the temple Alleluia
[55:21] I'm glad that's the case now the Apostle
[55:25] Paul I'm just going to how we doing for
[55:27] time I hope you're not bored now the
[55:30] Apostle Paul that wrote out of weakness
[55:32] they were made strong now I want to I
[55:34] want to say these things
[55:36] I think I've already seen it but Satan
[55:38] does not understand how God could have
[55:41] such mercy and grace upon people like us
[55:43] he does not understand how God could
[55:47] could redeem a people that God could
[55:49] make them like Adam was before the fall
[55:53] god does not understand how he could
[55:56] give his creative power to a people who
[55:58] had been born and soon shaken iniquity
[56:00] come to a world speaking lives Amy what
[56:03] is the power of the third Pole the
[56:05] creation the power of the spoken word
[56:07] amen now we don't necessarily need Stahl
[56:11] spoken out of existence amen but there's
[56:14] lost loved ones around right there's all
[56:17] these different things we haven't we
[56:19] have different kind of needs right but
[56:22] God doesn't though Satan so he doesn't
[56:23] understand because memmer Satan the one
[56:26] thing he can't do is create he cannot
[56:28] create he can only provoke so he but he
[56:30] has a longing because you take anyone
[56:33] who has a thirst for power and satiable
[56:35] thirst for fame or power or popularity
[56:38] money whatever it may be that's satanic
[56:40] because they have such a they're driven
[56:43] by something I mean it all it does is
[56:45] elevate themselves when they get there
[56:47] you know he take the great big famous
[56:50] people of the world who becomes the idol
[56:53] they do write satanic and so now so he
[56:58] wants he wants the power of the spoken
[57:00] word he wants to be able to create but
[57:03] he cannot but yet God comes down you
[57:06] just take Moses under the blood of bulls
[57:08] and goats let flies come flies came let
[57:12] frogs come frogs come let locusts come
[57:15] locusts come turn the water into black

[57:22] hail come the hail came let darkness
[57:24] darkness cover Egypt darkness covered
[57:27] Egypt hallelujah incredible it wasn't
[57:32] him that was God through a man speaking
[57:34] under the blood of book power under the
[57:37] blood of bulls and goats brother Bram
[57:39] says I think it's in the breach message
[57:40] he says now if a man can do that under
[57:43] the blood of bulls and goats how much
[57:45] more are people under the blood of Jesus
[57:47] Christ I mean that this isn't
[57:49] just covered but they've been done away
[57:51] with I mean but they're they don't have
[57:53] a fallen nature anymore they got a
[57:54] redeemed hallelujah
[57:57] you take Jesus Jesus you know you read
[57:59] the Gospels what what's he doing what's
[58:02] God doing he's demonstrating this as me
[58:04] as a man I'm gonna make you like this
[58:06] whatever measure it is that's up to God
[58:08] but this he's demonstrating himself now
[58:12] wind waves peace be still
[58:15] amen Lazarus come forth baby I mean
[58:20] ghost of the was it dry says daughter
[58:22] arise the one who is dead cast out
[58:26] devils had dominion over everything and
[58:29] the Bible tells us when we see him
[58:32] there's nothing of him that we should
[58:34] desire just a short little guy nothing
[58:37] nothing special about him he he dressed
[58:41] he was like what are the poor people I
[58:43] did here was the Redeemer yeah a man he
[58:48] was the Redeemer and so God was showing
[58:51] these things as a man because he's
[58:54] trying to tell you now this is what the
[58:56] first Adam did I'm the second Adam I'm
[58:59] going to show you what I do and then the
[59:01] works that I do shall you do also he
[59:05] that believeth in me the works that I do
[59:08] shall he do also and greater than the
[59:10] shall do because I go to my father
[59:12] amen and see here he was and he was
[59:16] demonstrating this is what this is what
[59:19] I can do and you take the Apostle Paul
[59:24] he was brother BAM City as a hook nose
[59:27] juice you know just he was he had a
[59:31] certain temperament about him Peter was
[59:33] as well and you can see Peters failings
[59:37] his Peters failings he denies the look
[59:40] he does all cut he curses while doing it
[59:43] you know he tells the disciples after
[59:46] the resurrection I'm just going to go
[59:47] fishing let's just go back let's just go
[59:50] fishing I don't know what else to do he
[59:52] had a lot of failures he had heaps of
[59:54] failing they're all documented like like
[59:57] David David did far worse of things and
[1:00:00] soldered
[1:00:02] but David was selected by God to be the
[1:00:04] king sol was man's choice David was
[1:00:07] God's choice hallelujah if you're God's
[1:00:10] choice tonight you should say glory to
[1:00:11] God
[1:00:12] I mean glory to God I'm God's voice
[1:00:15] hallelujah sure he he had to pay for the
[1:00:18] things he did but God didn't take the
[1:00:20] king kingship from him just because of
[1:00:22] the things he did just like God doesn't
[1:00:24] take bribed chip I'm a you following me
[1:00:27] God doesn't take your position as bride
[1:00:29] of Christ Amy just because you may do
[1:00:32] some things glory be to God I mean so
[1:00:36] Peter had his frustrations as ups and
[1:00:39] it's downs but yet God and and Jesus
[1:00:42] even even said to him when he when he
[1:00:44] lets just go to mark chapter 16 now
[1:00:49] Matthew I may have this wrong but we'll
[1:00:52] find it yes Matthew 16 then we
[1:00:59] understand we're not going to read it
[1:01:00] but Matthew 16 down from verse 13 jesus
[1:01:05] would ask we're just going to go to
[1:01:08] verse 21 down to verse 23
[1:01:12] don't try to verse 23 yet this o Peter
[1:01:16] has the room Peter has the revelation
[1:01:18] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:01:20] Living God and so Jesus is blessed art
[1:01:23] thou simon barjona for flesh and blood
[1:01:25] has not revealed the sunder unto you but
[1:01:28] my father in heaven and upon this rock
[1:01:30] I'll build my church wait sorry we need
[1:01:33] to go further up okay let's go from
[1:01:37] verse 18 of Matthew 16 and I said to
[1:01:40] thee that thou art Peter and upon this
[1:01:42] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[1:01:44] of Hell shall not prevail against it and
[1:01:46] I will give unto thee the keys of the
[1:01:48] kingdom and whatsoever thou shalt bind
[1:01:51] on earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:01:53] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:01:54] shall be loosed in heaven well that's
[1:01:57] amazing
[1:01:58] here he is okay incredible then Chad see
[1:02:03] the disciples they tell no man that he
[1:02:06] was Jesus the Christ now let's read down
[1:02:08] but 21 down to verse 23 notice what what
[1:02:13] Jesus oil just keep running from there
[1:02:15] time forth began Jesus to show unto his
[1:02:17] disciples how he must go unto Jerusalem
[1:02:19] and suffer many things of the elders and
[1:02:21] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[1:02:23] and be raised again the third day
[1:02:26] then then Peter took him so here's the
[1:02:28] one saying who said thou art the Christ
[1:02:30] the Son of the Living God and who said
[1:02:34] you will have the keys of the kingdom
[1:02:36] then Peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:02:39] him saying be it far from the Lord that
[1:02:42] thou shalt this shall not be unto thee
[1:02:47] so Jesus is telling him I'm gonna go to
[1:02:51] Jerusalem I'm gonna pay for the sins of
[1:02:53] the world that's basically what he's
[1:02:54] saying I'm gonna redeem you Peter
[1:02:56] I'm gonna my blood upon the earth
[1:02:58] for you I'm gonna loose you from the
[1:02:59] powers of Satan hey I am the Holy One of
[1:03:03] Israel I am the one that was promised in
[1:03:06] the garden that you know you're the seed
[1:03:07] of the woman Here I am he says you will
[1:03:11] not do this thing and then then he
[1:03:14] turned and said this is Jesus speaking
[1:03:16] to the one who is going to give the keys
[1:03:18] to Peter get thee behind me get thee
[1:03:21] behind me Satan thou art an offence unto
[1:03:24] me for thou savourest not the things
[1:03:26] that be of God but those that be of men
[1:03:30] well and we know who Peter denies the
[1:03:34] Lord three times you know who you know
[1:03:35] he does all these things but yet that
[1:03:37] doesn't change that did not change
[1:03:40] Peters position as spokesmen on the day
[1:03:43] of Pentecost and he opened the he used
[1:03:46] the keys to the key opens the door and
[1:03:48] he opened the door to the Jews the
[1:03:50] Gentiles and the Samaritans all the same
[1:03:52] way repent and be baptized name of Lord
[1:03:54] Jesus Christ remission of sin and you
[1:03:56] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:57] for the kingdom of God is within you
[1:03:59] which is the Holy Ghost and the believer
[1:04:01] yeah amen and then and then Peter even
[1:04:06] gets carried away in the book of Acts
[1:04:09] with with a false false doctrine coming
[1:04:13] into the church all you have to become a
[1:04:15] Jew before you can become a Christian he
[1:04:18] gets carried away with it and then Paul
[1:04:20] goes down there and straightens them out
[1:04:23] how are we think about it amen
[1:04:28] now does that mean he just got God to
[1:04:32] sit I'm sick of you Peter I've given you
[1:04:34] too many chances I'm taking those keys
[1:04:37] away from you
[1:04:37] amen yeah you're you're no longer an
[1:04:40] apostle of my no no amen
[1:04:46] and no doubt Peter Winnie if he could
[1:04:49] look and and maybe look over looks
[1:04:52] shoulder as he read I've wrote the book
[1:04:55] of Acts he wouldn't he probably wouldn't
[1:04:57] doubt can you just omit that but you can
[1:05:01] write about before the cross but don't
[1:05:02] write about my failures after the cross
[1:05:05] hello
[1:05:06] but God inspired Luke when he wrote the
[1:05:09] book of Acts put listen cuz it shows
[1:05:12] that a believer can gets can't get
[1:05:17] influenced a wrong way right but that
[1:05:20] doesn't make them not a believer but God
[1:05:23] because what is inequity now this is the
[1:05:26] difference I'm going back to where I was
[1:05:28] Satan I mean Luke yeah when here's the
[1:05:32] anointed cherub that covereth he was
[1:05:33] perfect in all his ways here's a here's
[1:05:37] something that's Annie if we saw him as
[1:05:39] he was like that you'd say what an
[1:05:40] incredible being we would be blown away
[1:05:43] by what he looked like
[1:05:47] amen it's okay to say you saw agree we'd
[1:05:50] be amazed if he were standing here for
[1:05:53] what he was back there you could say
[1:05:56] that's incredible we would be awed right
[1:05:59] but the thing is he had a nick so on one
[1:06:03] hand here's this one and then on the
[1:06:05] other side we read about those who are
[1:06:07] destitute tormented afflicted walked
[1:06:11] about in sheepskins and goatskins dwells
[1:06:13] in caves you know of whom the world is
[1:06:16] not worthy what is the difference
[1:06:18] between these two this one has no
[1:06:21] iniquity because the Nick what he is to
[1:06:24] know the truth and not do it this one
[1:06:27] who looks perfect has inequity in his
[1:06:29] heart but humanly would say that's
[1:06:31] incredible these guys are just a bunch
[1:06:33] of homeless people
[1:06:35] put us a base put into today's language
[1:06:38] but the ones who look like nothing are
[1:06:40] the jewels in his crown Jesus's crown
[1:06:43] then there are deemed ones hallelujah
[1:06:46] brother but the main thing is there was
[1:06:48] an inequity in their hearts there's
[1:06:51] iniquity in his heart so now when Paul
[1:06:53] went when Paul came to Creek Peter he
[1:06:56] saw the errors of his way and he was
[1:06:59] humble enough to Humble himself to the
[1:07:01] truth of God's wouldn't say I was wrong
[1:07:03] yeah amen and that's the great thing
[1:07:06] about a believer they can go down off
[1:07:10] some crazy rollercoaster ride of some
[1:07:11] funny thing but yet when the truth comes
[1:07:14] their way they will come back amen that
[1:07:20] doesn't mean that doesn't mean they're
[1:07:22] they are not believers amen you heard
[1:07:26] the testimony of Loni Jenkins and I'll
[1:07:27] probably tell this completely wrong but
[1:07:30] you go go see his testimony there are
[1:07:33] some people who came to Tucson and I
[1:07:35] don't know what year this was probably
[1:07:36] back in the seventies or whatever and
[1:07:39] they begin to they were they were
[1:07:42] representing some God thing from India
[1:07:44] and his vindication was a cloud would
[1:07:47] come over the top of the house and prove
[1:07:49] that and you know this would happen and
[1:07:51] brother Lonnie and some people from the
[1:07:53] church were getting caught up in these
[1:07:54] things and brother Lonnie was going to
[1:07:56] go have a look and God said don't go but
[1:07:59] he win anyway and he goes to this you
[1:08:01] know goes to this meeting in this house
[1:08:03] and some things begin to be seen he
[1:08:05] thought this is a little bit different
[1:08:07] but then they went out of the house
[1:08:08] and the man said now to prove on that
[1:08:10] you know I speak the truth look and then
[1:08:13] just above the roof there's this big
[1:08:14] giant cloud anything at all this is
[1:08:17] amazing and then that see lightning
[1:08:19] moving the broom and all different kinds
[1:08:21] of things but then he heard someone no
[1:08:25] no this part of might get wrong but he
[1:08:27] heard one of these people who'd heard
[1:08:28] accepted this new kind of doctrine was
[1:08:30] blasting the church they came out of
[1:08:33] about how they need to receive this as
[1:08:35] opposed to the message how this is
[1:08:37] greater than the message they by the
[1:08:39] licensing this is all kind of funny and
[1:08:41] in he's at his home praying about it and
[1:08:44] he sees like this fog begin to lift
[1:08:47] and this light coming and he could see
[1:08:50] it for what it was and God delivered him
[1:08:53] of that spirit and God told him I told
[1:08:55] you not to go I mean now did that mean
[1:09:00] brother Lonnie wasn't a believer to
[1:09:02] begin with no he wasn't believer to
[1:09:03] begin with is this alright you
[1:09:06] should go see his testimony he tells it
[1:09:08] himself right but because he was he was
[1:09:13] he was a genuine one when the truth came
[1:09:16] his way
[1:09:17] amen that brought him out of it yeah I
[1:09:20] don't know how I got on that subject but
[1:09:22] you know there's parts of our Christian
[1:09:26] walk that we're not proud of brother
[1:09:29] branham no doubt he wasn't proud of the
[1:09:31] fact that he turned down the invitation
[1:09:32] the first time amen there was a lot of
[1:09:36] things you know and and he would be
[1:09:38] honest you know he says I'm a nervous
[1:09:39] person I get all wound up like this you
[1:09:41] know this is how I am you know and no
[1:09:44] doubt he would have wished he was built
[1:09:47] different but God made him a certain way
[1:09:49] for a certain job you know and it's the
[1:09:52] same thing with us we have made a
[1:09:55] certain way our humanity is not really
[1:09:59] stop looking at your humanity I'm gonna
[1:10:02] kind of wine this up but I want you to
[1:10:04] see don't beat yourself up about who you
[1:10:07] are if only I was this other person if
[1:10:10] you're this other person God would have
[1:10:12] made you the other person
[1:10:13] I mean don't try to be something you're
[1:10:15] not amen we don't all water God has not
[1:10:19] brought I was a brother wrong Spencer
[1:10:20] says God isn't a cookie-cutter it others
[1:10:23] go check and make us all the same right
[1:10:26] we're all individual hallelujah and God
[1:10:31] made us brother Ram sister bride is like
[1:10:32] a great big bouquet amen
[1:10:35] these big flowers as little flowers nice
[1:10:38] the green stuff that's put in there you
[1:10:39] don't know why you know there's and
[1:10:42] there's all kind of them but God made
[1:10:45] the bride a bouquet and as long as
[1:10:48] you're in the body who cares
[1:10:52] yo like like like King David see I'd
[1:10:55] rather be what the doorman and whatever
[1:10:56] in the house of God than something else
[1:10:58] as long as I'm part of the house
[1:11:01] alleluiah and it doesn't matter you just
[1:11:03] think about this satan looks at you it's
[1:11:07] like Pharaoh and Moses looked at the
[1:11:08] children of Israel as slaves
[1:11:10] Pharaoh saw slaves Moses saw God's
[1:11:14] people Amen God looks at you and he sees
[1:11:18] this is my queen
[1:11:20] hallelujah this is my the one I love my
[1:11:24] eyes upon him amen
[1:11:27] I've been waiting for her and here she
[1:11:29] is she is the one I delight in you know
[1:11:33] you take you take Genesis and there's 25
[1:11:37] years of Abraham you know from from he's
[1:11:40] first called out of or wherever he was
[1:11:42] going into the Promised Land you know
[1:11:44] receiving Isaac and so on however many
[1:11:48] years after that he's alive it's all
[1:11:50] recorded there's many things happening
[1:11:53] around the world but it's not in there
[1:11:56] because God as God is leading his son
[1:11:59] God has focused upon his son I know if I
[1:12:03] said this a few times but you know it's
[1:12:05] not this civilizations rising his
[1:12:07] inventions its new languages this
[1:12:10] writing being you know there's all
[1:12:11] different things being invented it's not
[1:12:13] written it's not written in there why
[1:12:17] isn't it written in there because it's
[1:12:19] not important to God he's not worried
[1:12:22] about that stuff he's Abraham I'm
[1:12:24] leading him lujah I'm revealing him I'm
[1:12:28] revealing myself to her making myself
[1:12:30] knowing Allah lujah and it's like the
[1:12:33] same thing with you and I when when
[1:12:38] things are all said and done all the
[1:12:41] other stuff you know this is not going
[1:12:44] to be remembered right all these
[1:12:47] different inventions or the world
[1:12:49] history brother broom I think even sees
[1:12:52] in one place there's no really point
[1:12:54] riding history anymore because we've
[1:12:55] come to the end who's gonna read it
[1:12:58] amen people get caught up in all these
[1:13:01] other things but in God yo well you know
[1:13:07] if it was written if our lives were
[1:13:10] written in here like Abraham's life and
[1:13:13] they led him here
[1:13:14] listen us all this other stuff around
[1:13:16] the world wouldn't be recorded it's not
[1:13:18] it's not going to be recorded that the
[1:13:20] Lions and the All Blacks drew the series
[1:13:23] that's not in the Bible the Bible the
[1:13:27] Americas caps not gonna wouldn't be
[1:13:29] written in there whatever things people
[1:13:33] love and they have great ambitions it's
[1:13:35] not gonna be it wouldn't be written down
[1:13:37] I'm not trying to make a joke but you
[1:13:40] think about people get so caught up with
[1:13:41] all the stuff oh that person one listen
[1:13:44] this person to listen this you know it's
[1:13:47] not there because God is focused on you
[1:13:50] what if some musicians gonna come I want
[1:13:53] to I think I need to stop but God God
[1:13:58] looks at you see these are my children I
[1:14:00] love them with everything within me I
[1:14:03] gave myself as a ransom amen and he
[1:14:07] takes you he takes you he lives in you
[1:14:12] and he uses you as a vessel to bring
[1:14:15] down Satan's Kingdom hallelujah look he
[1:14:18] took Moses he was a man he had a temper
[1:14:21] Moses had a temper he got angry amen he
[1:14:26] was you know here too you know your
[1:14:28] brother I said he had a high-tempered
[1:14:30] wife the poor you know we didn't stick

[1:14:33] bloody husband to me it's what the Bible
[1:14:35] says in the Bible would I can say it
[1:14:37] yeah right you know angry wife on the
[1:14:41] backside days that God used that to mold
[1:14:43] Moses as Moses and you look at that you
[1:14:47] say they're having trouble amen they had
[1:14:50] a lot of trouble there a lot of intense
[1:14:52] fellowship and it was God molding
[1:14:57] hallelujah it was God molding his vessel
[1:15:00] and then his vessel was ready he was 80
[1:15:03] years old God because God didn't want
[1:15:05] him to be this great big Prince okay boy

[1:15:12] I'm a general I know how to fight I know
[1:15:14] I know the weaknesses the Egyptian army
[1:15:16] I've studied them because if you really
[1:15:18] if you really want to win a battle you
[1:15:20] need to study your weakness because the
[1:15:22] devil will study your weakness so if you
[1:15:24] know your weakness you can protect
[1:15:25] yourself amen but if you
[1:15:28] know your weakness you can just get
[1:15:29] blindsided well how did that happen
[1:15:30] workers he studied your weakness and
[1:15:32] when you take great sports teams of the
[1:15:34] world they don't just they study their
[1:15:36] opponent you look at boxers you know
[1:15:39] when they fight they study how the other
[1:15:41] boxer boxes and then they get sub then
[1:15:44] they get a sparring partner who boxes
[1:15:46] like the opponent I mean a brother BAM
[1:15:49] says we just study our opponent you
[1:15:51] study your opponent you should study him
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] I can't think of what to do today study
[1:15:58] your opponent go through the Bible and
[1:16:01] see where the believers fell and failed
[1:16:03] because the devil use the same tactic
[1:16:06] against you amen
[1:16:09] go do it not just where they overcame
[1:16:12] but where they fail study your opponent
[1:16:15] because the devil will come along he's a
[1:16:18] creature of habit you know sorry you
[1:16:21] standing what's the first thing here in
[1:16:23] Genesis Satan anoints the serpent what
[1:16:28] does the serpent say to e-j has God said
[1:16:30] he just takes takes a scripture confuse
[1:16:33] just a little bit now if you read
[1:16:36] Genesis from there he was God known as
[1:16:38] God when he made all things but when he
[1:16:41] came to man it's the Lord God so instead
[1:16:44] of the self existing one that's the self
[1:16:46] existing one who reveals himself to his
[1:16:48] family right so he changed his
[1:16:51] expression because his family were there
[1:16:53] but then when the serpent came on the
[1:16:56] serpent tells Eve has God said so God is
[1:17:01] just the self existing one who doesn't
[1:17:03] make himself known to his children he's
[1:17:05] a distant god
[1:17:06] that's God really you think God really
[1:17:07] cares about you do you think he really
[1:17:09] worries about what you're going through
[1:17:11] in life does he really you really think
[1:17:13] he understands you that's what that's
[1:17:15] what the Serpent's a deef because the
[1:17:18] devil comes along he's not actually he's
[1:17:19] distant you're just a little thing God
[1:17:22] doesn't actually care about you he's not
[1:17:24] interested in you and then he said yeah
[1:17:27] God has said what happened she didn't
[1:17:31] say no the Lord God has said he followed
[1:17:34] me you go read it it's a reason why he's
[1:17:37] known as as the Lord or God or the lord
[1:17:39] god there's meanings behind though it's
[1:17:41] not just English
[1:17:42] woods put together for its these names
[1:17:44] expressions behind it so if Eve X I said
[1:17:47] no the Lord God has said we shall not
[1:17:50] eat of the tree that would have actually
[1:17:52] shown oh I'm actually in a relationship
[1:17:54] with this Lord God I know him he knows
[1:17:56] me he's my father and it would have
[1:17:59] protected it but the first lie that she
[1:18:01] accepted was God as a distant thing he
[1:18:03] doesn't care and the devil does the same
[1:18:06] thing today amen and that's where she
[1:18:10] fell right because first she accepted
[1:18:13] that God is a distant thing the earth
[1:18:15] doesn't reveal himself that's why you
[1:18:17] see easy people the devil comes against
[1:18:19] you God doesn't care about you God's not
[1:18:22] interested in you he's just some distant
[1:18:24] where is he he's up in the heaven
[1:18:26] someplace where is that you know he's
[1:18:29] just the god of history amen and then
[1:18:33] why is that then then now comes the
[1:18:36] sucker punch right and he does the same
[1:18:41] thing you got a study where they fail
[1:18:44] study with a believer fails how did he
[1:18:47] get Moses from from stop going into the
[1:18:49] Promised Land
[1:18:50] we know that Moses wasn't ordained
[1:18:52] because the law could never take the
[1:18:54] believer into the Promised Land
[1:18:56] it had to be grace right we know that
[1:18:58] but what did how did how did how did the
[1:19:02] devil get Moses got him angry look at
[1:19:06] the weakness of the people look at their
[1:19:08] rebellion look at their stiff you know
[1:19:09] hardened hearts and stiff necked and you
[1:19:11] know got him angry
[1:19:13] you bunch of rebels do I have to bring
[1:19:15] water for you he was angry the devil
[1:19:19] uses his anger against them yeah and
[1:19:21] then you did that thing the water came
[1:19:23] forth all the same I think God said come
[1:19:25] aside you're not going in amen
[1:19:30] yeah doesn't it doesn't mean we're out
[1:19:34] of here because we do one thing wrong
[1:19:36] but Moses paid for that you reap what
[1:19:41] you sow
[1:19:43] amen why did you know David why did he
[1:19:47] fall with Bathsheba the devil used us
[1:19:50] you know his weakness his weakness was
[1:19:53] for married woman what he wanted Abigail
[1:19:56] he married Abigail after after her
[1:19:59] husband died it's different once he's
[1:20:02] been Sheba she's married he's not
[1:20:04] fighting battles anymore he's just
[1:20:06] sitting back in his palace now I can
[1:20:08] rest everything's well I don't need to
[1:20:11] fight anymore the young people can do
[1:20:12] the praying they can do the they can
[1:20:14] rejoice I'm just gonna sit back I don't
[1:20:15] need to do anything oh now the older
[1:20:17] people could do it I'm just a little
[1:20:18] person who cares about you no I'm just a
[1:20:21] little face in the crowd hey either way
[1:20:24] just sits back I can sit back to my
[1:20:26] palace I don't need to fight anymore now
[1:20:28] had a weakness amen you can take it all
[1:20:32] the way down through the Bible look at
[1:20:34] where they fell where they failed amen
[1:20:40] where is that gonna go they'd sing a
[1:20:42] song go study your opponent studied the
[1:20:47] failures of the believers it didn't make
[1:20:49] them not believe us right but you have
[1:20:52] weaknesses and the devil studies you and
[1:20:54] he uses you against you because he knows
[1:21:00] you he studies you right because he
[1:21:03] wants you to fall because it's just like
[1:21:05] how he got he got Moab to to bring
[1:21:09] Israel to the feasts and they and they
[1:21:12] married one another and God killed
[1:21:14] however many thousands of them in the
[1:21:16] Book of Numbers why because God knew
[1:21:18] cause the devil knew if I can get the
[1:21:20] believers to transgress God's Word then
[1:21:24] God will judge them amen and that's why
[1:21:28] that's why the devil tries to eat you to
[1:21:34] cross God's Word then because you're his
[1:21:36] child God will deal with you amen
