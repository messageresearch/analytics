bit of a trip report here we're going to see how this goes so um are we so can you just mute that computer until I say put okay so as you know so brother Jim and I went to the Solomon Islands this is is if you don't know him this is Brother Jim Carman here he's uh 78 years old he has a heart that people would know the Lord so and you know when he and and and he's active he's in front marching on seeing people we got to go here do this do this and so um he's 78 wow it's his it's his 20th time that he's in the Solomon Island this is the number one time belong Mei stop belong Solomon so first time for me to go uml just a bit of geography uh here's the Sol oh maybe can I have the pointer actually I probably need to throw a laser up there but here's here's a map of the Solomon Islands uh so the red places where we went so hanara the capital we went up to uh Munda to noro and then up that top one is is wi so the three places we went to Brother Jim cman is still okay um he's still there he's there till the 11 11th of March so if you think I was away for a long time he's been he's going to be away for a very long time but he hasn't been there for 3 years because of Co and different things so uh he wanted to reconnect with the Believers and so on people that he know so um so this is just the first part of the trip so went to noro there's a lot of travel by boat uh here's the town here we stayed we stayed in the town noro these places are some of the places we went administered so for example we took a there's no really road that goes here very well so you take a boat everywhere wow so I've had my boating for for a couple of years um but we went up here there was so when we first landed in nto there was a uh a a uh uh woman came along says can you please come pray for my husband he's got bad asthma and he's got a problems with his legs now we didn't know she lived all the way up here so we took a boat up here went through the jungle for I don't know how long few kilometers and then so we prayed for this man and and he could breathe a lot better um he had swelling in his legs water retention in his legs because of some medicine the Hospital gave to him but he was more mobile and a lot better so um we went here this is where we had church on Sunday lamboo Bay this probably doesn't mean a lot to anyone but um we had Church there then we went up to a village here me Jesus how Sav him life belong me and uh to the church there so I shared my testimony and P I spoke a lot of pigeon there it was like English was in h then I just went into pigeon after that and everyone said clear me talk BL you so it was clear people understood um because the pigeon's a lot more English than it is and Pap when um yeah so we shared testimony up there and then um and and the pastor and four others gave their life to the Lord so so so there's open doors around the place amen but this this happened everywhere I was like I started if I go back to hodara yeah I preached there about how God's word will not return to him void but will accomplish that which he purpos it to do I just shared testimony after testimony of this message works this message is not Doctrine just or just church no this is God this is Jesus Christ revealed and pretty much the whole church came up for prayer kids with drug addiction problems all kinds of things people and God touched many lives amen so you know we know know story true talk Bel God it be real okay God's word is it's not just stories it's not just testimonies of a prophet of of the Prophet messenger for the age no God is the same today as he was amen so praise the Lord so yeah we went over here yeah we went different places and witnessed and shared and because the message is very very new a lot of people are it's only just starting to people are starting just to catch it you know it Grieves you so much there's so many hungry Souls but there's no Shepherds they're just scattered they're just trying to you know and it gave me a great burden for people so Lord help us to find ministers there that you can set a flame and then you can establish churches and ground people in the present truth and okay and then oh this is probably video you turn off this is not all there this is just an idea see there's the Waterway there uh there's tuna boats coming uh this is just how it is so very um it's not glamorous lovely place but you know hey this is not a I go camping but just not in New Zealand I'll put it that way um so yeah that's not okay we come to you do you want to put the sound up this is this is church on Sunday in AO this brother here brother William um you can probably I know you want to meet that again anyway so it's just a house meeting this brother here his brother is a deacon in a uniting church another part of the place we had we stayed in his house we had a real good Fellowship really just sharing how you in the word of God the message of the hour how God is real to that because he's a real leader see it's amazing when you think about it how the Bible says that like when Jesus when he after he came out of the Wilderness he went to the land of zeel and nle that it might be fulfilled people that sat in great Darkness beheld great light so you think about it here people are living they got families they've got Church they've got religion all kinds of things but they're sitting in darkness because the light of the word has never come across their path that really impacts me when I look at all this multitude of people round about living life just like in jesus' time but sitting in Gross Darkness that's why Lord may this word live may they see it's more than religion they've got they're up to hear in religion but may they see life changing the word changes lives amen so oh I should actually see right here me okay then we went from there uh we went to Wi now wagina is a um this is where they do seaweed farming so we landed in a strip here which is on a small island see the whole island is the air strip we went by a boat all the way down here we went to we stayed in here so these people this part of the country it's actually not um they're all from kabati if you know where kabati is lots of small atoles but the British in the 50s they they they moved they bought this part of the country or something and they gave it to them because kurab small atal small Islands they became overpopulated so so these people aren't even you could say Solomon Islanders so you can see they look different when we see so yes so we did a lot of um so yeah so we so this just enlarged part of here just quickly just so you get a bit of an idea so we stayed on this island it's all it's all Huts name belong Island Benjamin Place belong me this is my place and then we had Church on this island that's true and then we stay there's all this big um um Mangrove Mazes of mangroves now I'll show you later but um there's oh yeah so this is where we stayed this all seaweed Farms low tide they harvest seaweed they plant it and it's it's very good money um for them so where are we now do you want to okay so we're going to church this is us going to church on Sunday that's a nice that's a nice way to go to church isn't it um but if it's blowing a gale and it's pouring down with rain maybe a different picture we're going to church church is over here okay so we're going to church um maybe yes you going to put the sound up this is us having church this is brother ataki he is the pastor he's the leader there um brother Jim met him six years ago hasn't been able to be in contact with him until until now um but yeah I know these um so this place is a Catholic stronghold the island we stand on is a Catholic Island and you see religious Spirits you don't play games they really do do persecute and cause trouble there's a very fine line they've got to you know but of course they're not a lot of these people are from the United Church they come out of Methodist or they're still you know in that way but Protestant people okay they're singing in kabar I think G gilberties okay so we go this is this is the view after church this is where we stayed nice view of a fellowship Paul I just wanted to put that in but yeah but it's uh yes anyway okay so so here's the view from Benjamin Island this is where we stayed now it may look very tropical but when you got rats running through the rafters at night you got to dust all the ants off your bed you got a mosquito net you know it's not too glamorous but one outstanding thing that really that really happened here is it was Monday morning and I woke up to this unearthly scream it was more it was a teenage girl the scream but it wasn't a human scream and so brother Jim was downstairs he was praying and talking to people I just heard go get Ben so I went downstairs there's this demon-possessed teenager and I felt like I was back at Camp again and then this this girl I asked him what name name belong you and she said name belong me Satan screaming and just writhing and screaming and you know Satan on the throne just just screaming and so I started praying for her and she and she passed out thought well I've seen this before and I explained to brother Jim this is what happens when the spirit's about to be cast out or make the person pass out so so it won't be free so person W be free so I um we youo y we kept praying cuz he asked you know does this only come out by prayer or fasting I said no I've seen this before he was singing Papa New Guinea I said no this is New Zealand I've seen this and so I so so we kept praying for her she she she came to she was still screaming and yelling and totally beside us out of her mind completely couldn't even look in the eye just saw the white of her eyes and I thought Lord what can we do then and then as soon as I asked I felt such a love and compassion come over me I thought this is just another Soul Jesus died for her like she did like he did for me no difference and then God cast that Spirit out she went from demon possessed to S sound mind sitting still answering questions Talking I asked you is is Jesus Emy boss man yes Jesus on the throne yes and she she actually got dragged here by two women carrying her cuz she's so demon possessed but after prayer and then then after she was just sitting there still I said I want to pray for you just prayed for a committed her to the Lord and she walked home normal amen God I said look you need rest you need something to eat she left normal so even it was just for her God gave her another chance then me we we we had a service I don't have any video here but we had a service here of um in the Catholic Church there's about 4050 especially young people and I just shared my testimony in Pigeon and they you see whenever I meet talk pigeon and they had him talk belong me and they all Focus him no move him no talk him they they had him talk belong me they all focused because it was very clear and God began to deal with people we had about 20 20 people come for prayer after that some with sickness they got healed there's one sister said I've got this big pain in my side can you pray for me prayed for her went off happy next morning I said how are you she I'm fine you know headache's gone different things gone people gave their lives to the Lord why because the power of a testimony not my testimony God's testimony I mean this message works if you don't you if if it's the last thing you ever hear me say this message works it will accomplish that which is purposed to do don't let the devil ever put it down your spiritual throat that it doesn't work it it's not for you it's for you God is without respector of persons God is the same you just take him at his word and you watch God do what he wants to do hallelujah amen so we had a very good time there just that but talking to brother ataki if I can find let's go the next one so as I was Sayang about the mangrove um Mangrove jungle so I mean maze so what he has done is he is he found this piece of land so over there most of the island is uninhabited so you can go you can build a house and the government will give you three hectares around the house so he's done that this is this is the back of nowhere I was like where are we going in this boats narrow and mangroves and anyway so he's built a church here because he wants to build a place safe that his people can build homes and they're free from persecution they're free from religious persecution so they've been building this church for 3 years he's got a house uh further in the jungle uh from here and um and a couple other Brethren have built houses around it but they still had their house on the island so they've got their workplace their holiday house and their Island House you know you know so this is this is what it's like so so this is our we're going through the mangroves deep just everywhere but but he's built this I thought this brother's got foresight he's got a vision you know he's not just reactive and no he wants to build have a long-term plan for his people in his family I mean that God can God can be there um you know they can have a safe place This Is Us going through the jungle this is what this is part of his garden of his house but we had to walk over this is all actually you could say virgin Forest never been touched before and um you know all the tall stuff and yeah this is Brother Jim you see he's not he's not lagging on behind he's pressing on you know and uh we had to walk over logs and all kinds of things but it was really amazing so um now this is this is so this is Brother ataki here okay so his wife here I can't remember her name um she's not kabati she's from Solomon they look different now this brother here this brother here he's he started going around saying hey follow God one follow God belong Lord Jesus Christ papt picking an e me title Holy Ghost e me title leave me no name he just starts blasting this around so what he's saying is there's not three Gods there's one and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost are just titles there's no power in that name that's right and he say hey baptism hey you got to be baptized in Name Lord Jesus Christ he hasn't been baptized yet but hey lights are turning on Amen so praise God Amen so that's exciting and that's brother Ari's daughter there amen so pray for them um pray for them God that God the light would completely go on I just keept saying this fellow message imy Jesus Christ revealed more than Doctrine more than Church IMO denomination God being made real amen he said yes in through he said okay sorry maybe I should stop this is so this is this is Brother Francis he's in honiara um this is where we uh we stayed with him and his family so brother Francis and his wife just before we went to the Solomons they went to so brother Jim Carman he goes to brother qu's Church in Melbourne they had a camp they have their annual camp so they flew brother Francis and his wife over to the camp and it really impacted them the lives of the Believers they could see you know cuz they saw this message in action and it really really changed them amen really helped them so I had a lot of good discussions with him too and he said man this he said this message is different than a bible school it's completely different to what we've had before I said yes cuz it's Revelation it's God revealing himself it's not learning something so you just keep them in prayer um yeah God's doing great things I believe Maybe Baby Steps but hey everything's got to start somewhere so amen so praise the Lord let's um so that's in a very small nutshell I got a lot more videos and photos if you want them I'm happy to send them to you amen but let's stand shall we um let's just go to the scripture amen because this this whole trip got me thinking on one thing we're going to go to Mark uh 11:20 um this got me thinking about really you know to especially that incident with that uh demon possessed girl you know you can't put on love you can't manufacture you can't manufacture having a real compassion and and that's how it will be with the third pole that we've seen Among Us is you can't manufacture it and so I want to just go into that this morning um but it's great to be home amen be happy too much okay so Mark 11:20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verely I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you that uh what things soever you desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and you shall have them and when ye standing praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer and let's Commit This Time To The Lord gracious father we're so than Lord I'm so happy to be here at home Lord with your precious children Lord Jesus to be in this church once again thank you so much Lord and Lord Jesus you Lord you've done many things over there and father I just pray you just be with your children up there in the Solomon Islands be with brother Jim father where uh he is now give him strength and father we commit him into your hands dear God and as we have read your word now we need you the great author to come on the scene Lord may you step in now and may you interpret it to every life Lord Jesus may you anoint speaker and hearer and may we just be hidden Under The Shadow of Your Great Wings may your will be done in this meeting we love you we thank you for this time we pray for any anyone who's not here today Lord we just want to commit them into your hands as well those who may be watching who are sick and body father we're so thankful you're mindful of us Lord no matter where we are we love you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak about the the power of the spoken word and how it cannot and will not be uh there will not be caral impersonations even though people will attempt to kindly impersonate now as we've read this here we understand that uh brother Bram he said that he would he he actually would not preach on this scripture for a very long time because he did not understand it that it seemed to be as if someone could just say say something they wanted and God would just do it but he he would he would come to find out that it's not actually when it says whatever things ye desire uh that's not your human desire that's God's desire comes into you and manifest his word it's not because we must realize you know I know um you know there was like a few years ago there was a brother that Andy knows from way back in the day um he sent me clips of him preaching now he's just a Pentecostal guy and he was giving me examples like you can say Let There Be house and there'll be house and let there be this and it'll be this I thought no that is not how it works because that's just a human desire wanting human things but when we come to a place you see God is looking for character and that character to me is a full fully surrendered life it's a fully surrendered life that's the true character God is looking for that it's not what we want it's what he wants amen so there has to come a time where our desires are not wrapped up in spiritual things to try and hide it as our desires but it's God's Own desire amen it's what he wants now you know Jesus Jesus was Jesus was our example amen we yeah we know that right now we got to we got to stand now I I just ask this question as I try and collect my thoughts now uh what's the difference between these two one's biger and one yes one's big and one's small what are they both so the nature and the big one and the nature and the small one are they different I like Liam he's cool amen I'm glad there's someone who answers just straight no good on you bro but you see they're both sheep right I know this is well I'm glad you're all sitting down I can tell you these things but you see they're both sheep okay there is never in the history of the Bible or any real Christian that where you know the devil gets into people's minds that we go from a sheep where it's not our will the shepherd's leading us it's not what we want it's what he wants we're surrendered then somehow we somehow get to this maturity and is now what we want no that's not how it works amen you can go from well actually you can go from sheep to Wolf like your first nature you're born with an year you can have what you want but we want what God wants right so even remember when Jesus was when Jesus was pointed out by John John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world okay you say but we're Eagles yes we have an eagle anointing but we're still sheep I mean where God anoints us and we can see from eternity to Eternity it gives us stability in our life to realize what we're going through right now is not the End Amen we're going through the trial we're not staying in the trial but you see the great challenge is to stay a sheep to let God live Amen Let God speak amen as Jesus himself even said he said the son can do nothing of himself what he sees the father doeth so what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now we know Jesus was led by Vision therefore he saw a vision and then he walked into that vision and fulfilled the vision you say I've never seen a vision before but if you have the same Holy Ghost you may never see a vision in your life but you can be led exactly the same way according to his word and this is the character God is looking for amen he's not looking for people who can quote the quotes quote the scriptures and not be surrendered amen how many religious Spirits are there in the world that will quote brother Brandon will quote the scripture till the cows come home and yet not be surrendered to the word of God where the word of God cannot manifest flow through those people amen but I don't believe I'm looking at those kind of people today I believe I'm looking at prisoners amen who are surrended sold out to the word of God that let God live amen so they're both sheep they both have sheep nature we will always be Sheep amen we'll always be sheep doesn't matter how old you are how long in the Troth you become you're still a Sheep amen amen therefore you need a Shepherd amen so now the Apostle Paul would say this and this is one of my favorite scriptures he say I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me so he says yes I'm alive but it's not me living no more brother Ram said if you had the spirit of Beethoven in you you would write write great music if you had the spirit of Michelangelo in you you would great you would paint great masterpieces do great pieces of art if you had the spirit of John Dillinger in you who was a gangster I think you'd have guns and shoot people different things but if you had the spirit of Jesus Christ in you you will do the works of Jesus Christ because it's no longer you living no more two people can't live in the same house it's either you or God to let God live amen that's why there's a challenge in this day of self-will and people's rights and what I want to forfeit all those things and let God have preeminence amen that's the great challenge but I believe we're built with a we have been given an ability by surrendering we can surrender to the word of God Amen praise God we can surrender so he's saying see I live but it's not me living am mean it's Christ that liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God so was the faith of God that was motivating his life it wasn't his own motivation he did not wake up in the morning and say feel like doing this today in terms of let's go preach in this place he did want to go preach in Asia but the spirit forbade him right so he and and so even when his will was contrary to the will of the Holy Ghost he surrendered his will that the Holy Ghost lived amen and to me this is incredibly powerful because you got to realize that Paul is the example not just of the example Minister but the example Christian where he could live such a surrendered life in such an age of of heathenism and idolatry and self-will and eth eics and things he could live a life where it's only he only wanted to do that which pleased the father just like Jesus amen and we know that the Apostle Paul if you have the faith of the Son of God in your life you're made of the same material but failure comes when human ability wants to override the will of God and it does Amen so see it's not something it's not see the power we understand that the third pull is here am right Amen brother R says well it's see well I just find it here once again U some people will just we know brother Bram was wondering through his ministry from 1956 when he saw the visions of the of the of of of lacing the shoe and fishing in the tent and all these things what the manifestation of the third pull would be but he comes to the end of his ministry and he says the third pull is the opening of the word the Myster is revealed but some people will take this and say well the third pole is just KN correct Doctrine but it's more than that because when the word comes open to a person there's a manifestation there's a supernatural manifestation you take Caleb and Joshua when they were standing there and hearing Moses reveal the law of God reveal the heart of God for them it the word became open to them and what was the manifestation Caleb said at 84 years old I'm as strong now as I was when I came out of Egypt give me my Mountain amen that was the manifestation it wasn't an argument it wasn't well I don't think Moses and blah blah blah no God revealed it to him this is the truth I'm going to walk in it and God gave him prevailing power to take his inheritance amen you take the same thing with Joshua Joshua was a minister unto Moses and he saw the power of a surrendered life that when he crossed the Jordan an angel of the Lord came with a sword drawn he prostrated himself in front of him saying you're my king you're the general as the Lord as he asked the Lord or asked that man he didn't know it was God at that stage he says who are you for us or against us and and and and and the Lord said no but I come as the angel of the Lord the captain of the host and so God came down and said to said to Joshua I'm not for you or against you I've come to take over your battle amen amen so I'm not just here to help you I'm come to be the Supreme General in this campaign and that's the same thing with you and I when the Holy Ghost actually takes full leadership in our lives what does that do he comes down to take over that's why the anointing of God comes down into church because he wants to take over your human battles he wants to take over your life he wants to take over your family he wants to rule your thought life he wants to rule every part of your life that's what he wants to do and that wasn't just for taking Jericho that was for the whole campaign amen it's the same thing with you and I God has come down in this end time amen the mighty Angel has descended to take over our human battles I mean to to lead us all the way into Rapture that's what he's come to do I mean we're going to recognize him as king he can't just be our savior and just a just something you pull out like an insurance policy no he's got to be your king I mean will you don't inject yourself into what he tells you to do you let him lead you every part of the way I mean he Li when he was standing on Mount carel he would have the he would have the altar there he had it all prepared and he says Lord I've done this all according to your word I mean so what did he do he saw a vision he didn't just decide one day I'm going to go challenge the priest of baale I'm sick of this nonsense no God told him God showed him by Vision gather the priest go to Ahab do exactly what I tell you to do and I'll bring fire down that's why he so so he walked into the vision he did not inject his own thoughts into what God was telling him to do he was surr enough I mean that's the spirit of Elijah I mean to be surrendered enough to let God completely fulfill his word and when the vision became material he says God I've done this all according to your word and may the people know you're Jehovah and you've turned their hearts back again and the fire fell and consumed it exactly exactly he has shown in the vision and friends that's how we've got to be we can't inject ourselves our human ability into our Christian Walk we're going to let God lead us you got to let him lead you because that's good character amen bad character injects themselves into what they think God's telling them to do good character is surrender to the word of God and they let God lead amen so so the third PLL has a manifestation we know that there's the five instances of you know in brother braham's life where there's the manifestation of the third pole the power of the spoken word when know there's that fish got its life back there's a storm spoken out of existence there in Colorado that blizzard that he was in I mean that tum of the size of a grapefruit on the side of his wife was was spoken out of existence before the exactly as the Lord um exactly as he asked the Lord because the Lord came down and said say what you will and it shall be that's character for God to come to a person what do you desire what do you have need of just like king of hazaras coming to Esther your es will come before the king what do you have need of will give you even half the kingdom see she had the right kind of a character just like brother Braham he had the right kind of character where God said ask what you will and it shall be amen and so what was his desire he said Lord before the surgeon goes to cut my wife may that tumor disappear amen and the surgeon goes to cut there was a cool Bree sign came into the room and the size of a grapefruit of a tumor just disappeared the storm you know the squirrels were spoken into existence had writes boys received eternal life amen why because that a power was placed in the hands of a mortal redeemed Son of God Amen but you got to realize now that it was had Wright's faith that caused it to come into being am me for the Salvation of her two sons that power is in you today amen if you've got the holy ghost that power is in you where God can step on the scene and do the miraculous amen because remember before that conversation where brother Brown was sharing the testimonies of the squirrels and different things they were snickering and laughing and making fun they weren't they weren't sitting there saying oh my he's Elijah oh my the Bible's living again oh my this is true no they are sniggering and laughing but her faith amen brought God on the scene and overrode their attitudes overrode their unbelief and brought them into the kingdom how much more you and I friends amen I believe that same power is in the room this morning I believe it's in you and I amen where people can be going a certain way but you can respond in faith to the word amen and God can step on the scene this ain't pie in the sky this is reality amen when I was there in the Solomon Islands that love and that compassion came over me that wasn't generated by me that was God and it wasn't a long drawn out thing it was just maybe 2 minutes and she was free from when I went down there to when she walked out sane and whole it was about maybe 2 not even that wow amen amen that wasn't me that's God Amen but we're got to realize that power is within us amen amen we can't be afraid we we don't need to be afraid of the devil amen amen or any of his tricks amen you got to realize that there power of the spoken word because remember the same anointing in the prophet as in you and I he didn't have a different Holy Ghost he had the same Holy Ghost I mean the same holy ghost that fell in the day of Pentecost dwelt in him amen is now in the bride of Christ amen and he says that the voice of God is in the bride once again amen that the world will hear direct from direct from heaven like they did at Pentecost amen so that voices in you and I it's not just on tape it's not meant to stay in the Bible it's not meant to stay in book form but that word must come and live inside you and I that it's not you speaking it's de speaking cuz you got to realize that when you stand in faith and speak the word amen across anointed lips it's the same as deity speaking and every Mountain has to move nothing can stand before that person but you got to realize that's not new just working out what to say that's God inspiration moves upon your life and you begin to speak hallu we've seen it here have we not many times not just preaching but in prayer lines and and and and prayer services different things God step in amen manifest himself through the gifts or through anointed people same thing amen God doing what he wants to do hallelujah amen amen I believe it amen but you see now there's just as he says here there'll be Janice and jambres rise up there'll be impersonators trying to impersonate this but the angel of the Lord told Brother brah this cannot be impersonated Hallelujah don't even really try and explain it cuz you tried to explain the first and second Paul don't try and explain this God and flesh manifesting himself because people are trying and people still try and impersonate it today because they have such a hunger and a Longing To See God live if you want to see that hunger satisfied just die to yourself just die out to your caral ideas die out to reasoning let yourself die and rot Amen to superstitions and problems and complex just just let it all go that's the only way you can see God live it's not you trying to work it out and trying to no just just die out see this is the great problem people don't want to die I mean people want the message they want to be religious but they don't want to die just let God live Amen Let God have his way he knows what he's doing he's been in this business for a long time amen it won't be you and I that pull up our bootstraps and take ourselves in a Rapture no it's the Sovereign Grace of God Amen and every time we've seen a supernatural happening here or anywhere it's God's sovereignty steps into this room and takes over amen and that's what we got to do is yield to him let him live amen like never before amen this could be the last year upon the Earth let him live amen you could look back when you're around the throne said I let you live Lord I let you have my have your way in my life that's what I wanted Lord and I saw you do it hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen praise the Lord so the Janice and jamby impersonators would appear again in the last day now we know those those Janice and jambres they were the court M uh magicians of pharaoh and so Moses and Aaron came into Pharaoh's Throne Room said let my people go God speaking through Moses he was actually a God to the people he threw down his sticket turned into a serpent Pharaoh stood there or sat on his throne got his magicians to do the same thing and it just hardened the heart of pharaoh and that's what caral impersonations do they hid in the heart of the people that's why it's such a problem counterfeit Christianity out there it hardens the people's hearts and I say well before there's counterfeit there's got to be a real amen cuz counterfeit money isn't made first the Real's made first amen but the real actually can has purchasing power in it amen the Cardinal's got no purchasing power but the real is purchasing power am mean if I had a million dollars of genuine money I could buy a million dollars worth of whatever but if it's just counterfeit it can look the same but it won't produce the same results amen the transaction won't go through amen but if you got genuine faith and a genuine the genuine word of God you'll see the transaction go through am mean you'll see the promise of God fulfilled amen so it hardens the hearts of people but don't look at the don't look at the counterfeit look at the genuine the devil wants you to study counterfeit Christianity I say he's you're wasting your time ien people have all of these YouTube channels saying this is wrong and this is wrong and that's wrong I thought tell me something that can help me amen it can't help me no good to point out the problems of you know of the church and this and this and whatever more that doesn't give me Faith amen no faith is when the promises of God have preached and power demonstration it's received into a sold out life and that same word amen is manifested that's what we need friends is to lift up the real lift up Jesus Christ Lift up his word into its right position am mean because he has a name above all names amen don't let your mind battle be telling you that that that that that it is greater than his name no everything must bow to the name of Jesus Christ amen I've seen the you know we're there there we're in monsoon season we were up up the coast one place there in nto and it was just pouring down with rain and you know we were we were going to walk back to where we were staying about 5 km pouring down with rain I said Lord because I've seen it in ug Guinea happen many times Lord can you just send this rain back out to sea it was gone like that amen I I I just asked him see not you we should asked that our Joys would be full said Lord we need to get there it's about 5k we're going to get saturated brother Jim had damaged his tot was bandaged up Lord we need to get there okay amen and not only we didn't actually walk that far but we got a boat so even a bonus you know but you see we should ask that our Joys be full amen that God and what is the joy seeing God live I mean seeing his promises fulfilled it's not a selfish see if you've got selfish ambition am mean you're not going to get anywhere with God Amen you may play you may speak the part and play the part but no if you got selfish ambition it won't help you none now hallelujah praise the Lord I'm just trying to find says in Philipp chapter 2 because as I started off saying Jesus is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen he would actually before we go there you know he would actually say because Philip said show us the father and it will satisfy us it will suffice with us and Jesus said have I have been so long with you he says it's not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me doeth the works so G we know Jesus was the god man right but he was he was made like us he had to be our kinsman redeemer born but yet without sin virgin birth created in the womb of Mary amen but but he was man like we're man tempted on All Points yet without sin amen people think you know even in the Sodom Sodom and Gomorrah age anything that you've been tempted with in this age Jesus was tempted by because the Bible says that amen so he understands temptation but he knows what it's like to overcome amen so now but he says it's not me that doeth the works amen see even even the words that I speak unto you I speak not of my self but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works see even he recognized this is not me this is not my desire even this is not even my thought it's my father comes lives in me and he manifests his Plan of Salvation through me amen and now if that was the if that was the bridegroom speaking like that how much more the bride of Christ how much more amen his bride amen shouldn't it be when we give a testimony it's not me that doeth the works my father dwelleth in me doeth the works amen it wasn't it's not my testimony it's his testimony it's not my overcoming power it's his overcoming power in me amen it's not my might it's not by power it's by his spirit amen that's how it should be shouldn't it amen that we should be able to look at our lives and say it was all you Lord it wasn't me it was you amen and this is what this see this message has come to place Jesus in the right place am you see churches put him as a second or third person of a godhead but he's Supreme deity amen the Bible declares him the king of kings and Lord of lords amen and so it puts him in his right place that his name is above all names amen and when that goes from a theory to a reality in your life then the word of God will have preeminence amen he will be be the Supreme one hallelujah hallelujah amen so I think we can say it's not us that doth the works as the father dwth he he does it all have you ever become but you see the devil wants to make us a stuffed shirt oh yeah saying I'm big now I know what I'm doing that stuff shirt material am we are meant to be Lambs we are always meant to be depend depending on him am amen we're not meant we never are called to get to a position and say now okay God thank you now I can take over amen cuz you've TR no no no no no no it's always him all the way you look at jesus' life you know there was not one point in his ministry he said okay thanks father I'm done I mean you're done now you can re relax I'm mature enough I can do it no he was completely dependent he was 100% sold out to the spirit of God within him amen he never ever humanly injected his own self into leading himself he was the Lamb of God amen amen help us Lord Jesus amen but you see now Philippians 2 fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loness loneliness of Mind Let each other esteem uh other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus see there's got to be a yielding amen see Paul's saying let it let him rule you don't let your five senses rule you don't let your imagination your conscious affections reasoning whatever more don't let those things rule you Amen Let Him rule you it's like Joshua when they had the five Kings there you know Joshua when he said sun and moon stand still do you think that was him no that was God I believe God's H him what do you have need of I'm fighting a battle Lord say what you will and it shall be done while the Sun's going down we need this more sunlight to destroy our enemies that was God's inspiration see God speaks and we respond hallelujah amen that that's how Christians are God speaks we respond to his word and then he fulfills it in our lives it's never us first Eve wanted to go ahead of the plan of God and look what happened to the world Amen where worry yes who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found fashioned as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory now this word strife means electioneering or Intrigue for office it's a desire to put oneself forward that's not a sheep mentality that's not a hold out mentality our our heart should be Lord I don't care if I'm a it doesn't matter if I'm even remembered but may you be made known may you be declared may people know you I don't care about me I want people to meet you and know you that the impact of my life is that you lived and people saw your word living in my life amen but see that The Strife of electioneering what's electioneering vote for me I've got all the answers I can solve your problems I can make these promises say I can do this we had an election you know it's like a lolly scramble the Solomons is going to have an election soon it just becomes a lolly scramble this for this and this for this and this for this and this for this and then they get voted and they say I'm sorry we can't fulfill it sorry true me you you know but it's just everywhere like that you see but so we shouldn't be electioneering we shouldn't see people who are really called run from the job people who are not called think they should do the job and they try and do the job and they can't do the job amen that's why people run I say hey come don't get tired just give up but people who oh yeah I want to be this I want to be that now you got to die out to that brother Bram says when you receive the Holy Ghost it takes the big shot desire out of you wanting to be the big one amen so so it's the desire to put oneself forward am mean then vain Glory it means a vain Glory groundless it's a self-esteem which is confidence in one's own Worth or ability self-respect so we don't want to do things through our own ability or or what we think we are humanly see we should know our worth in God's eyes that we are a jewel in his crown we are love gifts for Christ amen we are his bride we are his everything we are his all in all we are the purpose of his being is US redeemed amen that's what how God views us amen one soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds you look at the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary he put your life above his own life because if he put his life above your life he would never have died so in his eyes you are more valuable than his own life amen but you see the thing is when you realize your worth in God's eyes that doesn't make your stuff sh that doesn't make you think you're the greatest one it makes you humble isn't that right when you think the great king of glory that just spoke all the stars into existence and it says in Genesis and he made the heavens and the Earth or made the Stars also just like his side note made all these great things he he put you above him in value shouldn't that doesn't that make you humble the greatest king the king of glory more than some trending hashtag person on some media thing amen he put you at greater value I'm stressing this point because it should make you feel it should make you feel small not in terms of I'm nothing but in terms of thank you Lord thank you you came looking for me and this and this darkest crazy age we live in of 8 billion people on the Earth he came looking for you amen cuz goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and that word follow means to pursue and overcome amen so so so goodness and mercy when you were born was on your Trail hallu amen God's goodness and mercy was hunting you down and I don't know what age you were but it finally overtook you at a time appointed God said they're ready I can meet them now amen hallelujah what and then what happened you became a loved prisoner to Jesus Christ amen so so you should realize your your value in God's sight but you shouldn't ever think that you and your own human ability can do anything see it's the brother Braham stresses in the church age book in multiple places it's not by money the gospel goes forward it's not by Talent it's it's Sanctified consecrated lives to the word by the spirit of God that's what makes the gospel go forward amen so we must never think our own abilities you say well you say but brother Ben you've been pastoring 12 years you should know what you're doing no no no if I ever get to that point you might as well fire me oh boy amen because we are always sheep we are always depending on the leadership of the Lord amen we always trusting see we should realize the more we walk with God the more we need him amen amen I need him more than when I first met him I need him way more he say well he got more responsibilities no just for my own personal life I need him more you know so you know this is how we should feel amen that we should not try and do things through Strife or vain Glory see even even the Lord would say when he's in Gethsemane he says father not my will but thy will be done his human will cuz no one likes to die he knew by Vision what he had to suffer what he about to step into into Pilot's judgment Hall and being M more than any other man and dying the most shameful agonizing death that's possible he knew what he was going to experience he saw it by Vision but because he was so surrendered to the will of God he stepped into it hallu amen so you see this is how we should be amen the Lord we should let God live amen I trust we're all following but you see now impersonators will come to a certain point and they cannot impersonate anymore as I said about Janice and jambus they came to a point where they could not by their enchantments do the same plagues and they would say to they would say about the LI they couldn't do it and they said to Pharaoh this is the this is the Finger of God but Pharaoh's heart was hardened you see so people can have Miracles and healing when it comes to the power of the spoken word this will not be copied this will not be caral impersonations will try but they will fail amen because God doesn't want us to God doesn't want us to use caral impersonations or even try am mean you see because it's because it was prophesied say JIS and jambus as they withstood Moses so they would resist the truth in this day that anointing would return in the end time amen but as that same anointing has returned in the end time so has the Holy Ghost returned I mean brother Ram says that this the end time message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people cu the doctrines Creeds and dogmas of man don't gate up the power of God moving am mean that's why as we're returning back to the word God's pouring out his Spirit more and more I mean God's moving more and power I mean more love is being shable in our hearts God why cuz we're returning back to the word in faith sir Hallelujah you say well I got the Holy Ghost I've arrived but there's more promises to possess I mean there's more there's more reality of God to experience amen so as we return to the word in faith what God is moving in great power Hallelujah Lord amen so we got to realize now these things are sovereignly given now brother Ram was asked a question I didn't put the question up here but you go look in questions and answers 1964 part one and and someone asked them basically you have this power of the spoken word could you just speak over a person and that' be Rapture Ready filled with the spirit and brother says that you're believing because of the spoken words and things of that like he said about and you here witnessed the squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given ien I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things uh like that do these things there I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but it was God that sent him down to Egypt see now I believe that the Holy Spirit would come to me say in a vision go tell certain certain person that they're trying to overcome a certain thing they cannot do it and they're smoking they're drinking they're lying stealing committing adultery whatever it might be or they got a got lustful spirit and you just go where they are and say thou Spirit come out there I set this captive free would it would it take place absolutely yes indeed that's absolutely would it would take place but now upon my own but but now upon my own presuming presume means to venture Adventure without author Authority we got to realize that we have authority in this day we are not presuming in our Christian walk am me down through the church ages when there was a mix of Truth and error and God was restoring Sur there's a lot of presuming going on it was man's idea trying to put the word back together Bible schools and different things but we don't have Bible schools we don't have a collection of intellectual Minds that put the word together no we have be we have received thus sayith the Lord amen we have received the true interpretation to the word of God so now we are not presuming amen you all gone pretty qu quiet on me but you know we can Venture with authority right but what he's speaking about here and presuming is that the presuming is well the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and you do that in faith but by a vision he's saying I've already seen it happen I walk into the vision I hope that makes that clear amen but you see but but what I'm saying is because the word has been restored we're not guessing can it work we've seen it work amen amen we've seen people surrender their lives receive the holy H ghost we've seen their lives be changed we know the Holy Ghost is still the same we've seen people healed demons cast out different things happen complexes broken healing take place marriage is being restored and so now we know there's nothing too hard for the Lord amen yes sir Hallelujah so amen see then I don't know I'd call upon the name of the Lord over them I can pray for them and do whatever I wish to do he says now if I had my own way this morning I had an interview with this little lady sitting in this wheelchair to come to this meeting today they had to have the fire department to take her out of the her house in Chicago and the people live across the street and don't come to the meeting see what would I do if it was in my power it is I have authority to do it but I have to wait for orders to do it this is why we should know the leadership of God Amen you should know God's leadership you should be able to look back in your life God said do such and such and such and you see it fulfilled you should be able to see that amen well he but he talks to me differently he should still talk to you amen amen whether it's through his word by Dream by Vision I don't know leadership still small voice but you should see God's leadership in your life it's absolutely Paramount that you know you're Leed by the shepherd amen you're not just wandering along well there's nice people nice group I'll go along no it's got to be an individual walk amen that if this church ceases to be you are still walking amen amen you still love the Lord you're still you're still walking because why it's an individual walk brother R said at the end of the church age book his desire was that the true spiritual relationship would be restored between man and God Amen that's the last part of the church age book that was the whole thrust of the ministry what was to reestablish a true spiritual relationship between God and man amen that it's not man their own ideas and maybe God it's just God and man I mean where God can declare his word he can speak things he can correct us he can put us on the right path amen amen that's true amen you see now see the see I have authority from God to do it but now when he gives the orders she'll go back home well see I know that is the truth see I'd just be willing to die this morning on that as I'd be on in in anything see it's the truth but first you see even Jesus himself said that the son can do nothing in himself but what he said the father do that do the son likewise we know that St John 5:19 the son doeth nothing in himself but what he see the father father doing that the son will do likewise amen so you see even the Apostle Paul was a prisoner but you see now the problem is he says this here and and and I'm going to kind of wind up soon but he says see just like you if you're a Christian God Don't Make Any halfway Christians God makes complete Christians amen God Don't Make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway am mean and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're Halfway Christian but it's not God's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways got mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are amen so you inject your own plans into God's will for you you become a Halfway Christian amen but God Don't Make halfway Christians I mean I don't believe I'm looking at halfway Christians but we must be very careful not to mix our own carnality into especially spiritual things and say it's God leading no we should have full confidence what God has told us he will fulfill amen not us fulfilling it he will fulfill we're surrendered to the word of God he will fulfill that word amen it's not God doesn't say go do this and says now you work it out yeah this is not like you got to assemble some piece of furniture without the instructions now some people try that that's fine it makes it more exciting but when it comes to Christianity you need the instructions amen you need the instruction say God build me into a Powerhouse of your Holy Ghost where I'm now a living dwelling place for the the Living God amen amen God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them completely stand in the breach now Moses God had made him a complete Prophet for a complete deliverance and Moses was completely surrendered to the hands of God that's the reason it made him what he was amen he was so complete in God till God could trust him amen I believe God has made a complete bride I mean not a halfway bride not just some girl he's flirting with but his wife amen this word has come to unite Us by the Holy Ghost to himself I me so I believe I'm not looking at a halfway bride I believe I'm looking at a complete bride of Christ amen full of the spirit washed in the blood Sanctified to his word loving him more than anything loving him in spite of trouble trials and heartaches who cares about those things just walk on with God we're going to have trouble we'll go through Bri prates we'll go up hills and valleys and all kind of trouble but God will lead you through and mean you've got to completely trust your guide amen you must Trust in the danger remember he's trained to help you in the danger amen see what if see see what if I was there with brother ataki we're going through the mangr and then halfway I'm like where are we okay let me take the tiller I'm going to drive the boat boy I'd still be stuck in Mangrove somewhere hunting mud crabs trying to live there in the Solomons that's what Christians do they get worried where am I what's going on okay I've got to take the reins of my heart now my human mind to make everything work no that's the time to trust God that's the time to really let go and say God you lead me through amen you lead me through God but you see what happens is people have a s nature that must die see Saul was told by by by the prophet Samuel wait there for seven days in gilgal and I will come and I will give the sacrifice before you go fight the Philistines so so he received a word from the Lord and that comes to the seventh day he sees people are beginning to leave him he what is he he caught up in the five senses he's caught up in what he's imagining while the people are scattering from me we're getting less and less men we're going to lose the battle and and and Samuel's not coming Samuel's right on time amen Jesus is never late I mean we may think he's late but he's right on time his schedule is perfect amen so then what does he do he takes the Commandment of the Lord there's going to be a burnt offering and he takes it into his own hands and he gives the burnt offering see this is not good character this is bad character because this is man taking the plan of God into their own hands to fulfill it instead of just letting instead of waiting for Samuel to come and do it see as soon as he finishes the soon as he finishes it then what he made an end to of the offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him maybe the Smoke's just there he hear Samuel coming maybe runs to him to try how you doing you know nothing everything's fine yeah try you know how people do run from the evidence that's bad character see if he really had a good Godly character he would have waited why cuz maybe to me it would have been this offering would have been meant to be given at the evening time hey victory comes in the evening time amen you go do a study on that it's it's it's it's real nice amen the Lord amen so this is why we've got to if we want to see God move in a greater way cuz I believe we've just seen the cusp of his power I sincerely believe we've just kind of just seen a little bit of it this ain't plateauing friends this is not denomination where it's just yay no this's a full restoration of the world Amen so I believe we can you know I believe God is going to do the exceedingly abundantly more than we could ask or think that's right amen but you see now we must have a Heart of Love see that's why I've been stressing before I left love the Lord Praise Him in the trials Praise Him in the storm Praise Him and watch the chains break I mean just love him no matter what because in the message why so tossed about the brother could being put on the WhatsApp I could probably put the whole sermon here but it's only one slide it says but every but evil spirits not cast out by cruel indifferent living what is really that indifferent living mixing your own Humanity in with the word of God the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love amen amen so so you got to we have to walk in the love of God more than anything this world is very indifferent especially this country very lukewarm country this is this is lukewarm Ville but God put us in lukewarm Ville as a testimony Amen to prove to the devil it doesn't matter what you give them you can give them first world Comforts there's a people that love me amen there's a people that worship me they walk with me amen it doesn't matter where this Satan's Eden hey God has made a people that was a complete bride that will walk in this in this time amen soise the Lord amen you see it's not with money that God Works he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word what is that you're a complete Christian you're not injecting your own thoughts in you let God lead you amen amen but you see now in the lat here and age I'm just kind of throwing these things out there then we'll then we'll finish see see the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece this is where the the Lord says that because you're lukewarm I'll spew the out of my mouth now we're never in his mouth in terms of you know we're not abiding there we're in his heart and his hands in his mind but what his word is in his mouth amen but you see the church world has mixed Creeds and dogmas with the word so they're no longer speaking the word of God they're speak they're their own mouthpiece what have they done mix carnality in with the word how do we know how does God no longer speak through a Believer they mix their own Humanity with the word and they speak for themselves their desire is exalted and God's desire is put to the side am mean but if you want to be the mouth PE you want to see the voice of God in you amen speaking and doing what he wants to do let him have preeminence let him lead you let him be king I mean let him be Lord of lords in your life don't don't try and say well I can do it now I know what I'm doing no no he knows what he's doing amen hallelujah I'm just trying to find see the Apostle Paul as I said in the beginning he was a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen and he was forbidden by the Spirit to go certain places to preach amen but God he had to sacrifice every bit of his of his phariseeism to be United with the word and he says that he became a prisoner and brother says oh if people half spiritual can pick that up see he was forbidden to do his own will amen let's just uh can we have the musicians please I'm just going to end there let's just softly land see the thing to do is to be true in your heart love the Lord with all your heart and just be thankful that God is marching on with us the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ I mean you want to see you want to see things really spoken and you want to see that third pole manifested in your life love him amen love him more than anything lay aside the carnality lay aside the problems lay aside the you know the devil's reasoning and all these things just you say but you know because people some people have a have such a inferiority complex they want to prove to the world that they're a Christian now let God prove it amen let God prove it we're not here to prove anything God's here to prove his word amen he's just looking for a place to do it Hallelujah Here I Am Lord come prove your word in my life I've got no reputation to uphold I got nothing to prove to the world I got nothing to prove that I'm right and people are wrong no forget all that stuff let God be glorify amen so if you want to see I said you can't explain Supernatural things when you try and do it he told me you cause carnal comparison to rise you do it but it's just actual it'll do that it's a hindrance to the body of Christ you know what I mean it causes conflict now the thing to do is to be true in your heart love the Lord with all your heart and just be thankful that God is marching on with us the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ amen are you thankful are you thankful I'm so glad I'm so glad this is not our doing this is not our or I feel like doing you know this is God we can look back over how many years we've been together or you've been a Christian you say I saw God Amen I saw God and he called me I gave my life I saw God fill me with the Holy Ghost I saw God change my Outlook change my motives change everything that I am I've seen God all the way through amen then when these bodies are changed we'll say now I can now I really see him in the airall Hallelujah and what will eternity be it was all you Lord you have brought me here it was you Lord you sovereignly came to me and and and asked me inspired me to pray certain way because what is it now the same Holy Ghost and the prophet speaking is the same holy ghost in you see the power of the spoken word is tied into the atonement amen amen maybe we'll pick this up another time but you see we got to see that it's it's all the Lord amen let's just stand shall we amen I want to I want to I want to I'll be wanting to sing this song for a while I know it's not really a worshipable song but uh once my heart and soul was FedEd by The Binding chains of sin amen but but my great emancipator Set Me Free To Worship Him amen hallelujah is that your testimony yes amen amen
