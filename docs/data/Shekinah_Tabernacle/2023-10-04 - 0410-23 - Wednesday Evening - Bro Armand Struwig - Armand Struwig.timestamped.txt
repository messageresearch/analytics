[28:37] and they just all this I brother jimy
[28:42] still young todders man huh young in the
[28:45] faith they've got
[28:47] Zeal so a big thanks tonight for brother
[28:51] B to give me another time to to brag
[28:53] about Jesus Christ I love him so much
[28:56] he's everything to me amen there's
[28:58] there's nothing on this Earth if you
[29:00] keep your eyes on the prize on Jesus
[29:02] Christ that could disappoint you okay
[29:05] and we're going to touch a little bit
[29:06] based on a couple of things tonight and
[29:08] hopefully the Lord will open a c couple
[29:10] of scriptures to us that just when I
[29:12] read it it actually struck me brother
[29:15] moo why did you sing that
[29:18] song if you only knew brother Josh your
[29:21] songs tonight if you only knew what the
[29:24] Lord has in store for us so come with
[29:26] the expectation because I never spoke to
[29:28] one of them and it's all about our Lord
[29:31] Jesus Christ about the blood about the
[29:33] crucifixion about what he's done for you
[29:36] nobody said anything to anyone it's all
[29:39] the Lord's doing and it's mighty in our
[29:41] sight amen let's not get used to the
[29:43] supernatural amen let's turn our Bibles
[29:46] to Psalm
[29:48] 51 man I was so excited I almost jumped
[29:50] out of my skin there when the songs came
[29:52] brother you said I have to sing the song
[29:55] but I don't want to sing the song I
[29:56] might sing it but now have to sing it
[29:58] and you had to sing it amen you had to
[30:00] sing it so what we're going to do is
[30:03] we're first going to just lay a little
[30:04] bit of a foundation here and just why I
[30:07] want to get to where I'm going I'm not
[30:09] like brother Isaac with his fit man
[30:11] sermon that's going to keep you in limbo
[30:14] he he's done a well job cuz I was
[30:16] calling everyone every name in the Bible
[30:18] but the fit man so thank you brother
[30:21] Isaac that was very very good to hear
[30:24] that from you it it did something to me
[30:26] that night I really needed to to hear
[30:28] that fit man sermon it was for me I
[30:30] don't I don't know if anybody took that
[30:32] but that was for me so God bless you and
[30:34] if anybody is brother Ben always ask you
[30:36] to preach bro you deliver the mail God
[30:39] is using you hey and every one of us but
[30:41] he used brother Isaac last week
[30:43] Wednesday amen man it touched me so much
[30:46] so in Psalm 51 we we find out here in
[30:49] Psalm 51 that that David has
[30:53] now he's he's done the deed with BBA
[30:56] he's done wrong and Nathan came and
[30:59] Nathan said to him you were done you
[31:01] done wrong so he wrote The Psalm but in
[31:03] the psalm he said something and it
[31:05] touched me the moment he said it I
[31:07] thought man you know it's just the state
[31:10] that we're in sometimes and and we'll
[31:12] read the psalm and then then you can
[31:13] have your seats he says the chief
[31:15] musician the psalm of David when Nathan
[31:17] the prophet came into him after he gone
[31:20] into BBA he says have mercy upon me oh
[31:24] God according to thy loving kindness
[31:26] according unto the multitude of thy
[31:28] Tender Mercies blot out my
[31:31] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[31:34] my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[31:37] so his heart's desire is I don't want to
[31:39] be this way his heart's desire is
[31:43] there's something in David here crying
[31:46] out say Lord stand in the breach for me
[31:48] right now help me and then he says
[31:51] something which is very profound he says
[31:53] for knowledge of my transgression and my
[31:55] sin is ever before me so this is
[31:57] hindering him this is very much
[32:00] hindering him just stay in the service
[32:02] tonight against the um against the only
[32:05] have I sinned and done this evil in thy
[32:08] sight so it it wasn't about her husband
[32:11] it wasn't about the rest of Israel it
[32:13] was a very personal thing he said I
[32:15] sinned against God so I didn't do
[32:18] something wrong against my my fellow
[32:20] servant or my fellow brother but Lord
[32:23] I've done something against you so if we
[32:25] could look at that sin if we do sin and
[32:28] we we go to a brother or sister and we
[32:30] offend them you don't offend them it is
[32:33] it's sin before God it is it is more
[32:36] heavier than that I know we all you know
[32:38] offend each other and sometimes we know
[32:41] in the skin and we do silly things but
[32:43] the real guy we respond to and and and
[32:46] and fall under is God so when we do sin
[32:48] we sin before God we don't sin before
[32:50] brothers and sisters that's why love
[32:52] covers a multitude of sin here whatever
[32:56] we do here that's good but we actually
[32:57] sin before God it's it's much more it's
[33:01] much more weighted if I can say it that
[33:03] way brother and sister forgive you and
[33:06] God will forgive you as well but you
[33:07] first have to approach that that deity
[33:11] that God The Sovereign one to say Lord
[33:13] I've sinned before you you can hide many
[33:15] of things from many of people but before
[33:17] God you cannot hide it it's heavy okay
[33:21] he says the against thee only have I
[33:23] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[33:26] that I
[33:27] um that thy must be justified when thou
[33:30] speakest and be clear when thou judgest
[33:34] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[33:37] sin my mother conceived me behold thou
[33:40] desirest truth and the inward parts and
[33:43] in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to
[33:46] know wisdom amen so leave that verse up
[33:49] that last verse you may have your seats
[33:51] brother and sisters it's not a heavy one
[33:53] but we're going to have
[33:55] to we're going to have to call Sin Sin
[33:59] and and and what he says here he says
[34:02] Thou desirest the truth in the inward
[34:05] parts so there's something in you that
[34:08] once you've done something wrong it
[34:10] starts rubbing it starts working on you
[34:14] because in you God placed something it's
[34:17] not a conscious it's the Holy Spirit if
[34:20] you accepted it amen and even before you
[34:22] accepted it just by being raised by
[34:24] Christian values you know that it's
[34:27] wrong yeah and if you really took it
[34:30] away the only reason you don't know it's
[34:32] wrong or right is when you justify it
[34:35] when you reason when you when you see it
[34:37] in the eyes of the world and not in the
[34:40] eyes of God so when we sin I want to
[34:42] bring it a little bit home tonight it's
[34:44] not before any man it's before God and
[34:47] God is
[34:48] Sovereign and God watches your every
[34:51] move Brother Andy took the words out of
[34:53] my mouth he watches your move now he's
[34:56] not a he's not a hard God he's not a
[34:58] Taskmaster he's not he's righteous and
[35:01] he never turns a blind eye to sin amen
[35:05] okay he doesn't he sees it sees
[35:08] everything okay now here we go so we
[35:12] know that we were born in sin the
[35:14] prophet said shaped in inequity and come
[35:16] into the world speaking lies okay you
[35:18] can take that down sister Talia but we
[35:20] know that that when we were born we were
[35:23] born in a fallen state but we children
[35:26] did it all Happ happen we know we we
[35:28] hear this often but actually how did Sin
[35:30] just slip into the world so I thought
[35:32] I'll give you a Bible Lesson 101 it's
[35:34] started in the Garden of Eden so in the
[35:37] Garden of Eden God had a word w r d word
[35:43] his word amen he says two trees don't
[35:46] eat from them okay don't eat from the
[35:49] tree that's in the midst of the garden
[35:51] the truth from the Tree of knowledge
[35:55] and huh tree of tree of life so he says
[35:59] don't go to this one tree and eat of
[36:01] this tree in the midst of the garden
[36:03] because it's you're going to die the day
[36:05] you eat of it so there was a there was a
[36:07] word that God said a commandment a law
[36:11] something was remember Eden was in a
[36:14] state of perfection so my servant my my
[36:17] sermon title tonight is accepting
[36:20] accepting his Perfection oh Lord help me
[36:23] now so accepting his perfection
[36:27] okay not your Perfection his Perfection
[36:30] so here is the Garden of Eden and and
[36:33] it's all peaceful and Adam is there and
[36:35] Eve is there and a day is like a
[36:37] thousand years and time just goes and
[36:39] they name the animals and they
[36:41] Fellowship one with another it's
[36:42] Perfection no sin no death no hunger no
[36:46] pains no nothing it's just no headaches
[36:50] okay no feeling bad not one morning
[36:53] having to wake up thinking oh why am I
[36:56] waking up I don't want to get out of bed
[36:58] it was Perfection it was it was how it
[37:00] was supposed to be and then God spoke in
[37:04] this state of perfection he just said
[37:05] don't do that don't don't eat from that
[37:08] tree but see then what happened is
[37:11] Iniquity slipped in iniquity is if God
[37:14] says don't do it and you go and do it
[37:17] it's knowingly doing it yeah but see
[37:21] here David says I was shaped in
[37:24] iniquity so so he says I'm coming from a
[37:27] state of iniquity so all your children
[37:29] you aren't perfect though mommy daddy
[37:31] tells you you're my perfect boy and
[37:34] you're my perfect girl it's not the
[37:37] perfect Dem meaning or we love you very
[37:39] much and you know you're all we ever
[37:41] prayed for and more because sometimes
[37:44] you bring the more and we want to kind
[37:46] of just help you along your journey you
[37:50] know and and you get us frustrated to be
[37:53] perfect is to be in Christ
[37:57] okay so I want to keep your kidss in the
[37:59] service so if you don't have to Doodle
[38:00] don't doodle It's not long I'm going to
[38:03] be very quick tonight but try to stay in
[38:05] the service so remember sin came in
[38:09] the in the beginning In The Garden of
[38:12] okay I'm just checking because I want to
[38:14] just build this base so this is where
[38:15] sin came from and iniquity was when God
[38:18] send his word who can spell the word
[38:23] word w r d word correct my English is
[38:28] good so the word now I want you to
[38:29] realize I'm I'm emphasizing on these two
[38:31] words I wanted to put it up but I just
[38:33] didn't have enough time the devil has
[38:35] really done a attack on me this last two
[38:38] days man but praise the Lord I'm here
[38:40] and we're going to break down the
[38:41] kingdom of Hell tonight I need you to
[38:43] understand word is a four-letter word w
[38:45] r d correct amen okay so he send this
[38:49] word forth and he said don't take from
[38:51] the tree and Eve goes and takes from
[38:53] this tree but in the iniquity lust
[38:57] Creeps in as well because now we know
[38:59] it's a sex deed but when they said in
[39:02] Genesis and in chapter 3: 6 he says and
[39:05] she looked at the fruit and she desired
[39:07] it it was pleasant to the
[39:10] eyes I hope you understand what I'm
[39:12] trying to mean sin is Pleasant to the
[39:15] eyes that fruit tastes real nice it's a
[39:18] desire that's within us because of the
[39:21] Fallen state that happened in the Garden
[39:22] of Eden that now was inherited to us
[39:26] so I don't know why I preach this
[39:28] because we're all believers and we're
[39:29] all saved by grace and we're all there
[39:32] but the lord gave me the sermon so
[39:33] somebody needs to hear it so at the
[39:36] beginning that lust because it came
[39:38] through it got attributed to us the rest
[39:41] of civilization mankind inherited this
[39:45] lust okay and then the last one it was
[39:49] say in sin because once they came to God
[39:52] and they stood before God lies came in
[39:56] because because Adam now all of a sudden
[39:58] he's in a fallen State and God God ask
[40:00] him why did you do it and he goes it's
[40:02] the woman thou gave us me so Shifting
[40:03] the blame it's not me but he knowingly
[40:07] took her but it's not me so now he's now
[40:09] busy talking to God he's very honest but
[40:11] lies are starting to because then she
[40:13] turns to go oh but the Satan the the the
[40:15] the serpent begal me but she accepted
[40:17] his lies so now all of a sudden we've
[40:19] got lust and lies and deceit and and
[40:22] desire and all these things coming in
[40:24] where it was a perfect place yeah so
[40:27] they get kicked out of the Garden of
[40:29] Eden and here civilization
[40:31] starts and and man starts Pro recreating
[40:35] on the earth and making more more of
[40:37] babies and all those things and and life
[40:39] becomes on the Earth but see the the the
[40:42] the thing is inside you you don't always
[40:44] understand where you are because why am
[40:48] I always doing that why do I want to be
[40:49] naughty why sometimes when I do pull
[40:52] someone with a trick do I feel good
[40:53] about it you know why when my brother
[40:55] Sayes something something can I get so
[40:57] angry where does that come from it comes
[41:00] from
[41:02] there but remember the original state
[41:05] the world was in was a state of
[41:08] perfection okay so now we know if we go
[41:12] to the book of Jude it's just before
[41:14] Revelation it's only one chapter but I
[41:16] want to go there I want to build this
[41:17] foundation and and get it real cemented
[41:19] in
[41:21] there if you don't know what state you
[41:23] are in how do you know if you need
[41:25] saving
[41:28] huh have you ever thought about it if
[41:31] everything is just cool blaz and we're
[41:34] just cruising along on the happy life of
[41:37] the world and just having a blast how do
[41:40] you know that you're not lost come on
[41:43] how how do you know you need saving if
[41:45] you think you're all right see if you
[41:47] realize what state you're really in
[41:49] before you meet the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:52] you would change your way of approaching
[41:54] a service the word word every tape you
[41:57] listen to it will change because inside
[42:00] of you is already a hunger and a thirst
[42:02] for God you just don't recognize it yet
[42:05] you're just trying to fill this with
[42:07] everything else but there's inside you a
[42:10] a desire to worship all rakby Fans Say
[42:14] Amen see what I mean inside you is a is
[42:18] a is a feeling I want to shout I want to
[42:21] I want to have joy so when your favorite
[42:23] band goes on the stage and they go hey
[42:26] are you doing you
[42:28] go what made that do
[42:31] it oh come on they dress in rby games Ed
[42:36] used to dress like that by the way
[42:38] looking like a blue bull going to a blue
[42:39] Bull game oh so you see that big man
[42:42] unit coming down the street with two
[42:44] horns a helmet and he's blue you're
[42:46] going to be scared but because they they
[42:48] so getting in the spirit of the game
[42:52] okay praise the Lord he is saved because
[42:54] free state and blue balls we need never
[42:56] got along anyways but now we get along
[42:58] fine okay but but I want you to realize
[43:01] before then something inside brother
[43:03] Edan wanted to worship wanted to praise
[43:06] wanted to shout wanted to have joy
[43:09] unspeakable but he just didn't know
[43:11] where to find it yet he was just
[43:14] wondering everywhere wondering if this
[43:16] is the right way and wondering if that's
[43:18] the right way that's the wondering that
[43:20] the the Bible's talking about you know
[43:22] wondering is am I right if I do this and
[43:24] am I right if I say that that's a
[43:26] wondering Spirit okay he doesn't know
[43:30] he's as blind as a bat he's just
[43:31] wandering because see the world is
[43:33] designed a way off my note but I'm going
[43:35] to hit this hard the world is designed
[43:37] to distract you and to keep you
[43:40] wandering yeah that's right not knowing
[43:43] who you really are but wondering who you
[43:46] are okay is Christ real did he really
[43:50] get crucified is Miracles real I haven't
[43:52] seen a miracle in ages you know is my is
[43:55] my son all right is my daughter all
[43:57] right is did I apply the blood didn't I
[43:59] apply the blood should I apply the blood
[44:01] how do you pray when do you pray how do
[44:02] I
[44:04] wondering not knowing it's all a big
[44:07] question so if you're in that state I'm
[44:09] telling you you're still in the state of
[44:11] being lost though you redeemed your mind
[44:15] and your body is still
[44:17] lost I'm going to prove it amen okay
[44:21] because what it means is you're not you
[44:23] haven't and I'm going to come to the end
[44:24] of it now but you haven't come to a full
[44:27] surrender yet Lord Jesus you're still
[44:30] you're still you are still
[44:32] you it's good to be you but don't be you
[44:36] I want you to read between the lines you
[44:38] know we all have a personality we all
[44:41] have a a part to play in this great Plan
[44:43] of Redemption but if you don't know
[44:45] where you are you don't know what part
[44:46] to play and you definitely don't know
[44:48] where you're going okay now the world is
[44:52] spelled who can spell world to me
[45:00] w o
[45:03] r okay so the word is w r d i will help
[45:08] Rebecca here she was she got caught
[45:12] there but the world they've just added
[45:16] one letter L and that letter is
[45:22] lasciviousness now of course being me
[45:24] brother Isaac I had to go gole
[45:27] lasciviousness okay so let me tell you
[45:29] what lasciviousness is just for those
[45:32] ones that was wondering don't worry now
[45:35] it's a
[45:37] unbridled um
[45:39] sensuality okay it's for the flesh
[45:42] lusteth against the spirit and the
[45:45] spirit against the Flesh and these are
[45:47] contrary one to another and they cannot
[45:50] do the things that that ye would so it's
[45:53] a unridable lust for things
[45:57] okay uncontrollable something that's in
[45:59] you that that you do it and the moment
[46:02] you do it you go oh that it's something
[46:05] that's just pushing you beyond it's
[46:07] something that's in you that you can't
[46:09] get rid of you can't get rid of it and
[46:12] if we look here in the book of Jude and
[46:13] we go there to Jude 1 because there's
[46:15] only one verse and we start there with
[46:17] verse three it says there behold when I
[46:21] gave all diligence to write unto you the
[46:24] common salvation it was need ful for me
[46:26] to write unto you and exort you that you
[46:29] should earnestly contend for the faith
[46:31] we all know this which was once
[46:32] delivered unto the Saints so there was
[46:34] there was something delivered to the
[46:35] children of God faith everybody has a
[46:38] measure of it okay just keep following
[46:41] for there are certain men that crept in
[46:45] unawares who was before all ordained to
[46:49] this condemnation ungodly men turning
[46:52] the grace of God into
[46:54] lasciviousness and denying that the Lord
[46:57] um denying denying only the Lord and
[47:01] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[47:04] Jesus Christ and I will therefore put to
[47:08] your remembrance okay in your
[47:09] remembrance the thought that uh once
[47:12] knew this how that the Lord having saved
[47:14] the people out of the land of um Egypt
[47:18] afterward destroyed them that believed
[47:21] not we go on he says and the angels
[47:25] which keep not their first estate okay
[47:28] so the messengers and the angels they
[47:30] kept not their first estate but left
[47:32] their own habitation and that would be
[47:34] like if you think of jeffus and jaffas
[47:36] okay or if you think what was the two
[47:38] sons of um
[47:41] Levi uh half n phas okay they left their
[47:45] first estate they were priests and they
[47:47] forgot who they were and they started
[47:50] sleeping with the the ladies there at
[47:51] the at the at the um Tabernacle and they
[47:55] start started doing ungodly things and
[47:57] Eli was Eli hey and Eli was warned and
[48:01] they said to them hey your sons are busy
[48:02] doing wrong see they they came from a
[48:04] fallen estate they thought they were
[48:06] something they were lifted up so they
[48:09] they fell and that's because of sin and
[48:12] it's all right they fell because of sin
[48:14] but because they left the first estate
[48:16] and there's snipers in this world that
[48:19] want you to fall demon spirits that will
[48:22] attack you and will get you off the word
[48:25] of God
[48:26] and get you into the world through
[48:28] lasciviousness through the lust and the
[48:30] desire of the Flesh and they designed to
[48:33] attack you and that's fine that this is
[48:35] no man's land brother Isaac preached it
[48:37] one day no man's land this is where the
[48:41] big two battles come together no man's
[48:43] land it's a dangerous place to be in and
[48:46] what we don't and what we kind of forget
[48:47] is the enemy wants to get you out of
[48:50] your land that's he wants to possess it
[48:54] yeah okay so so then it says here um
[48:57] even as Sodom and Gomorrah go to verse 7
[48:59] even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the
[49:01] cities about them in like manner giving
[49:03] themselves over to fornication going
[49:04] after strange flesh and set forth
[49:06] example suffering the vengance of
[49:08] Eternal fire likewise also the filthy
[49:11] dreamers um the flesh despise dominion
[49:14] and speak evil of dignities so there's a
[49:17] there's a bunch of people on this Earth
[49:19] today you can't preach the gospel to you
[49:23] can't share the good news to and if
[49:25] you're a believer you're an outcast and
[49:27] the world is so blasé today that
[49:29] everything goes this is the state and I
[49:30] preached on it last time I don't want to
[49:32] Major on it but this is the state that
[49:33] you live in and that's fine that's where
[49:36] we live in but that's not you amen
[49:39] that's right that's not the real you the
[49:43] world okay added all these things and
[49:47] they keep adding and every year there's
[49:48] a new group come out okay it was LBG and
[49:52] then it was QP plus C hash Dash quadrat
[49:56] whatever it's all these things they just
[49:58] add and every year then it's cat dog
[49:59] Mouse them three eat others they just
[50:02] keep adding because the word is now so
[50:06] away from them and they now in this l so
[50:09] whatever your heart desires whatever you
[50:11] want to be whatever you want to achieve
[50:13] that lasciviousness that lust for it you
[50:16] have it if your neighbor has a great
[50:17] house have a bigger house okay and now
[50:20] I'm going to go to to brother brandom's
[50:22] um but that's the atmosphere we read in
[50:24] and I read this from brother brandom and
[50:27] I thought man isn't this today hey but
[50:30] he says here now remember inside you is
[50:34] something that is Desiring Perfection
[50:38] inside you is something that's looking
[50:40] for a place of worship that's how you
[50:43] were made okay so you choose where you
[50:46] want to worship you choose what you
[50:48] worship but inside you there will always
[50:51] be that desire that true Holy Ghost pure
[50:54] desire to do that
[50:56] okay listen to what I said it's a holy
[50:59] ghost pure desire because you're here I
[51:02] know that God has called you yeah you
[51:05] don't make mistakes you will not be
[51:06] sitting in this service if God cannot
[51:09] reach you and the fact that God will
[51:11] anoint the whole Service Plus songs and
[51:13] all those things for you is a major fact
[51:15] don't miss it it's for you he says here
[51:19] and and this is in um that day on
[51:22] Calvary this is what I want to preach
[51:24] the day on Calvary where the blood was
[51:27] enough of me he say therefore when a man
[51:29] realized that he was separated from his
[51:31] God he became a wonderer they wept they
[51:35] cried they toiled they wandered about
[51:37] through mountains and through the
[51:39] deserts seeking a city whose Boulder and
[51:41] maker is God for he knew that if he ever
[51:43] got back into the presence of God he
[51:46] could talk it over with
[51:47] him so since he left that Garden he knew
[51:51] I just need to get back but he don't
[51:53] know how he doesn't know how he knows
[51:57] that it's important he knows there's a
[51:59] God he can see God in Creation in nature
[52:01] everything around him he just don't know
[52:03] how to get
[52:05] back he says but there was no way back
[52:08] for him he became
[52:10] lost he says he didn't know which way to
[52:12] turn and he just looked out wondering he
[52:15] took out wandering and he found
[52:17] somewhere that he could find a way back
[52:18] to that place but something inside him
[52:21] told him that he come from a place that
[52:25] was
[52:26] perfect he says there is no person in
[52:29] here that is visible audience or this
[52:31] morning on the magnetic tapes will'll go
[52:34] all around the world there is no one
[52:37] here or anywhere but what seeks for
[52:41] Perfection that's how you made shoes
[52:43] need to be like this I like my hair like
[52:45] this that everything needs to be perfect
[52:48] you know sometimes even a floor drobe
[52:51] brother Marion is perfection okay
[52:55] Bachelors I've been there too you the
[52:57] way you express yourself it might not
[52:59] look good to other people but that's how
[53:01] you like your things but inside you
[53:04] there will always be a a wanting a need
[53:07] a desire for something greater okay that
[53:10] the world would love to fill for you he
[53:14] says and then he says you get your bills
[53:17] paid now all the moms and dads will go
[53:19] amen and you think that settled it you
[53:22] know when you get your blls paid that
[53:24] somebody is then sick in your family and
[53:26] you're like really now there's some sick
[53:30] he says and when sickness gets all right
[53:32] then there's some more BS to pay he says
[53:34] and the first thing you know is that
[53:36] your hair is turning
[53:37] gray he says and there is something all
[53:40] the time constantly because of that wave
[53:43] of sin but in your heart because that
[53:46] you seek for it it shows that there is
[53:48] perfection somewhere the Deep cth to the
[53:50] Deep there is something and that's the
[53:53] many reasons today and this I want to
[53:55] read because people think I preach this
[53:57] all the time that a sinner is wondering
[53:59] about a beautiful young girl will cut
[54:01] her locks of hair to be popular and
[54:04] paint a face to make her body look
[54:06] pretty she would put on clothes to show
[54:09] show the form of her being because it's
[54:12] the only thing she can find to finding
[54:15] somewhere to try to find something to
[54:17] come
[54:19] back she says she's doing this out of a
[54:22] desperation out of a seeking something
[54:24] not attention but really seeking
[54:27] something to come back a
[54:30] reaction you know and it's not a
[54:32] reaction from just Bo whistling at her
[54:35] it's actually seeking more but she don't
[54:37] know what she's looking for but then she
[54:39] turns to herself and not to him and
[54:43] because she's seeking not God because
[54:45] she doesn't understand God yet she's
[54:47] starting to look at the outward
[54:49] appearance and she's seeking and she's
[54:51] dressing and she's looking for that love
[54:53] that everybody wants
[54:55] but this is a perverted love that she's
[54:57] looking for it's not a Godly love and so
[55:01] the boys do with the girls they go and
[55:03] charm a girl and give her all these big
[55:05] promises and one day I'll marry you and
[55:07] all those things but they're looking for
[55:09] love but the wrong love the lavious
[55:11] lustful love because this world took
[55:14] love and it broke it into pieces and it
[55:17] made it a Hollywood thing and not a pure
[55:19] act between man and wife and God it is
[55:22] actually a very sacred thing it is more
[55:26] than just a holding of hands and a
[55:27] rubbing of shoulders and a little cheek
[55:30] kiss on the cheek it goes far deeper
[55:32] than that when you connect with your
[55:33] husband or wife and you do it right so
[55:36] warning to young people and we know
[55:38] we've got heaps of young people courting
[55:39] and all those things fantastic keep it
[55:42] clean because if you do it the wrong way
[55:44] you do it Hollywood's way but if you do
[55:47] it the right way it is
[55:49] perfect perfect there's nothing more
[55:52] perfect than that bond between wife and
[55:54] husband huj off my Marks here we go
[55:56] again he says but women try to make
[55:59] herself attracted to and um um and and
[56:02] Men try to make him her attracted to him
[56:05] neighbors will build a house and will
[56:07] fix it in a certain ways because they'll
[56:09] look for something better than what his
[56:11] neighbor has have you ever pitched
[56:13] forked in a sermon oh yeah that's for
[56:16] that one oh that's for that one hold on
[56:18] brother Hold on Sister this is for you
[56:21] amen because if you lust the things of
[56:24] this world if you look after someone
[56:26] else's stuff you're just as guilty as
[56:29] the poor sinner sitting here not knowing
[56:30] where he is even if you think you are
[56:33] saved by grace amen because it's the
[56:35] state you are living in which will
[56:38] reflect out of so what you put in will
[56:41] manifest and if things other things like
[56:44] those stupid house my daughter's going
[56:46] to fight with me sorry faith not stupid
[56:48] okay that's silly
[56:49] things that you look about that will
[56:52] burn in a fire okay earthquake will sink
[56:55] it the bank will take it back another
[56:58] guy will steal your car the the things
[57:00] that don't matter they major on but the
[57:03] real things that does matter they forget
[57:06] okay we carry on because they don't want
[57:07] to go he says but there's something in
[57:09] us that is seeking out something and it
[57:12] shows that we are lost we want to find
[57:15] something if you're lost you're looking
[57:17] for it when L did you look for your keys
[57:19] Brother
[57:21] Andy
[57:23] exactly so he loses his
[57:26] keys so he he wants to drive his car but
[57:29] he knows I need to find my keys he ain't
[57:31] going to start searching for his car cuz
[57:34] he knows he needs the key for the car
[57:35] he's going to search for the keys so now
[57:38] he knows he starts searching and all of
[57:40] a sudden sister bronan walks past and
[57:42] he's in the fridge and he's getting a
[57:45] pizza and she goes what are you looking
[57:46] for oh my keys well you won't find it in
[57:48] there oh yeah I was looking for my keys
[57:50] well that's what happens that's what
[57:53] happens you start searching in all the
[57:54] wrong places except in
[57:58] here it's easy your key is in here not
[58:02] in the fridge not in a rugby game not in
[58:05] a soccer game not in a a worldly event
[58:08] not in ballet not in French poodles or
[58:11] whatever it is in here because the if
[58:14] you if you lose the desire of the world
[58:17] sister Bron was you if you lose the
[58:20] desire of the world then you're looking
[58:22] for the right type of thing all these
[58:24] other things are added but seek you
[58:26] first the kingdom of God and all his
[58:28] righteousness all these other things
[58:29] will come but they don't major because
[58:32] the Bible says it doesn't matter seek
[58:34] first the kingdom of God young people
[58:36] seek first the kingdom of God because
[58:38] you don't feel your belong and you don't
[58:41] feel that it's it's a good place to be
[58:43] in because you're just looking in the
[58:45] wrong place your head is stuck in the
[58:46] fridge instead of looking for the key
[58:50] get out of the fridge lordes get out of
[58:52] the source band so let's go there to
[58:56] um oh I was reading the quote finished
[58:59] he says human beings try through all the
[59:02] ages they wept for it they cried for it
[59:04] they done everything that they know how
[59:06] to do he says but still they couldn't
[59:08] find it wandering about through the
[59:11] world Amen I'm going to leave the last
[59:13] one for and then you'll see how it all
[59:15] ties together so basically you need to
[59:18] know that you're looking for perfect
[59:19] love ladies gentlemen you're looking for
[59:22] perfect love perfect Joy perfect
[59:26] meekness you know perfect humbleness
[59:29] perfect wisdom perfect discernment
[59:32] you're looking for something that is
[59:33] clean pure and holy not some temporal
[59:36] thing but some Eternal thing okay so
[59:40] that's the that's the state your mind
[59:41] should actually be in that's where we
[59:43] all ought to be but young people more
[59:45] than ever the world is designed to try
[59:48] to knock you from these principles that
[59:50] there is a perfect for you there it's
[59:53] not in the world
[59:55] I will preach this till the day I die or
[59:57] Rapture which one comes first that's the
[59:59] Lord's will but I'm telling you now this
[1:00:01] world has absolutely nothing for you I
[1:00:04] thought I had it all in the world I
[1:00:05] thought I found it all I tried every
[1:00:07] Avenue except drugs praise the Lord I
[1:00:10] never did that but we've got testimonies
[1:00:12] here okay I've tried everything I could
[1:00:15] it could not fill the void that was in
[1:00:18] here and you say oh you don't know about
[1:00:20] it I was cool once I walked on eggshell
[1:00:24] you know I was so cool my wife was
[1:00:26] scared of me oh boy she didn't even want
[1:00:28] to know so I dropped her off in the
[1:00:30] evenings of my notes again but I thought
[1:00:32] I'll tell you how cool I really was you
[1:00:34] know I would I would caught her let's do
[1:00:36] it right we were dating back then but I
[1:00:38] caught her and then I would tell her
[1:00:40] some beautiful nice words and in the
[1:00:42] evening I'll drop her at her house
[1:00:44] hoping she would kiss me because I
[1:00:45] wasn't saved yet I didn't know the Lord
[1:00:48] Jesus and I didn't know how to do it
[1:00:49] right and the moment I lean over the
[1:00:51] door will go p and she's gone and I'm
[1:00:54] like did I say something wrong does she
[1:00:56] not like me I thought you know I had it
[1:01:00] but she she was scared of me cuz she
[1:01:02] knew that inside me I couldn't be
[1:01:05] trusted but I didn't know that cuz I was
[1:01:08] cool you know I get to my buddies and
[1:01:10] they'll go hey bro what's a joke for
[1:01:12] today and go ah there's a joke and
[1:01:14] they'll go ha and I'm cool man I'm
[1:01:16] awesome and you can kick a allall this
[1:01:18] far and ask it in South Africa's major
[1:01:20] oh you play first team rby oh you're
[1:01:22] cool you wear the jacket you show up to
[1:01:24] the right places I did ballroom dancing
[1:01:27] yeahuh the chaa the Tango all those
[1:01:30] things I was kite surfing I was cool the
[1:01:33] girls thought I was the number one guy
[1:01:35] to dance for in the school trust me ask
[1:01:38] them because they were lining up to
[1:01:40] dance but that's how cool I thought I
[1:01:42] was but all of that was just a smoke
[1:01:46] screen for
[1:01:48] sin because all he did is just pushed me
[1:01:51] further and further and further away
[1:01:54] from from God yeah I know I got to a
[1:01:58] point where I didn't even know what
[1:02:00] prayer was I got to a point where God
[1:02:02] wasn't real Samson was just a story in
[1:02:04] the Bible all these things just got blaz
[1:02:08] and every church service I couldn't wait
[1:02:09] to get outside and smoke with the pastor
[1:02:12] or the Deacon or whoever that was where
[1:02:15] we were because see what happens with
[1:02:18] sin sin blinds you it smokes you it
[1:02:22] gives you a a false ID identity that's
[1:02:25] right actually it gives you no
[1:02:27] identity because if you don't even know
[1:02:29] if you're a boy or a girl you don't know
[1:02:32] nothing not even biology
[1:02:36] 101
[1:02:37] okay I'm just thought I'd throw it out
[1:02:40] there I hate that Spirit of you can be
[1:02:42] whatever you want I hate that's going to
[1:02:43] burn in the Lake of Fire and we're all
[1:02:45] going to look at that spirit and say
[1:02:47] this one really and we're going to look
[1:02:50] at Satan and we say this guy made the
[1:02:52] world to tremble because see we got
[1:02:54] woken up of a world of
[1:02:57] disillusion we ain't going to be fooled
[1:02:59] we're going to be Overcomers this
[1:03:01] message came to overcome not to put us
[1:03:04] in some rules and regulations about
[1:03:06] skirt height and hair height and all
[1:03:08] those things it's not about that it's to
[1:03:10] shake you and say but wait there's more
[1:03:13] amen and better things you can be very
[1:03:17] happy in your right place or you can be
[1:03:21] very happy in the wrong place
[1:03:24] but either one of these trees will fall
[1:03:26] the way it leans be careful because
[1:03:29] remember what I said in the beginning of
[1:03:30] the service you sin
[1:03:33] before not
[1:03:35] men so when David truly repented of this
[1:03:38] he knew that when he addressed God he
[1:03:40] says though he he committed sin and and
[1:03:42] the kingdom could have him killed for it
[1:03:44] it's it's it's bad it's a big no no he
[1:03:46] said God I sin before thee and my sin is
[1:03:50] be between me and
[1:03:52] you beautiful place to be if if you
[1:03:54] could realize that your sin is between
[1:03:56] God and
[1:03:57] you now we go on I've majored enough on
[1:04:01] that let's go to the Book of
[1:04:03] Ezekiel and we go 37 Ezekiel
[1:04:07] 37 a little bit of scriptures just focus
[1:04:10] kids if you can try to stay in it must
[1:04:13] be in it there's always a tug of war I'm
[1:04:15] always going to I'm going to keep this
[1:04:16] in my sermons Mo the devil will grab the
[1:04:19] rope and he will
[1:04:22] pull and in between you and him is a
[1:04:25] lake of fire so you got the choice you
[1:04:28] can grab it and you can pull
[1:04:30] back and he can go into that Lake of
[1:04:32] Fire he can choose but you need to pull
[1:04:36] you need to fight when he
[1:04:39] says baby and he doesn't want to sleep
[1:04:41] he's here I'm just using him because
[1:04:43] he's here can't like to sleep don't
[1:04:47] listen to brother man this Wood's not so
[1:04:50] deep and he's pulling you and you're
[1:04:52] like what should you do do snap out of
[1:04:56] it this is for you there's nothing in
[1:04:59] the sermon that's beyond what you can
[1:05:02] understand it is simple facts you have
[1:05:05] sin nature in you needs to be crushed am
[1:05:09] you can't do it you don't know where to
[1:05:11] find or how to do it but God has a way
[1:05:13] for you tonight he's going to show you
[1:05:15] so when you get to Isaiah and it comes
[1:05:18] here when in 37 it says the valley of
[1:05:20] dry bones now brother Andy could take
[1:05:22] this subject and preach on that for a
[1:05:24] year the value of dry bones it's not a
[1:05:27] challenge it is a fact because
[1:05:30] they can I get an amen for
[1:05:33] that man just love the Lord cuz Brother
[1:05:36] Andy could take a subject and he would
[1:05:38] just go for miles and that is his gift
[1:05:40] that God gave him and I place I asked
[1:05:42] the Lord just doubles that gift Brother
[1:05:44] Andy and you keep preaching it and
[1:05:46] preaching it it's fine we all love you
[1:05:48] just how you are but when I read this
[1:05:50] the first thing I thought about woo if
[1:05:52] Andy gets this one we having a service
[1:05:55] okay it's going to be a good one so he
[1:05:56] says he in the value of dry bones and I
[1:05:58] want to keep it light now because it it
[1:05:59] goes to the point where you have no
[1:06:02] control but you've got all the
[1:06:05] control kids you have no control over
[1:06:09] sin no control but you have all the
[1:06:12] control read between the lines now you
[1:06:16] have it all he says the land of the Lord
[1:06:19] the the hand of the Lord was upon me and
[1:06:20] he carried me out in the spirit in the
[1:06:23] um and the Lord set me down in the midst
[1:06:25] of a valley that was full of dry bones
[1:06:29] so dry bones is have you ever gone
[1:06:32] through a a season and uh I'll ask some
[1:06:35] of the veterans here the older people
[1:06:38] where it's just a dry
[1:06:40] season Oh Lord You're like man I feel
[1:06:43] dry you sit in a service and you bone
[1:06:47] dry and the words coming over the pulpit
[1:06:49] and it's just not adding any flesh Sen
[1:06:54] or nothing you're in this
[1:06:56] state you're in this state where you
[1:06:58] just think man is this just another
[1:07:00] service am I just going through another
[1:07:03] trial has God actually going to ever
[1:07:05] come to the scene and help me out of it
[1:07:07] it's a dry place your bones has lost its
[1:07:10] marrow your your flesh has just fallen
[1:07:13] off you're actually just you you in the
[1:07:15] ditch so badly no matter what brother
[1:07:18] and sister talks to you and say it will
[1:07:20] be all right you're just dry inside I've
[1:07:23] been

[1:07:37] desolate
[1:07:38] place I I want to get back
[1:07:41] home have you ever been there I've been
[1:07:44] there it's a hard place it's where you
[1:07:48] just feel like there is nothing there's
[1:07:51] nothing and you're just about to give
[1:07:53] give up Lord comes on the scene that's
[1:07:57] right and he caused caused me to pass by
[1:08:00] them round and about and behold there
[1:08:02] were very many in the open Valley and
[1:08:05] low but they were very dry they were
[1:08:09] very dry and he said unto me son of man
[1:08:12] can these bones live Oh Glory who's
[1:08:15] speaking here he says son of man can
[1:08:19] these bones live these dry bones that
[1:08:21] needs something
[1:08:24] he and again he said to me prophesy upon
[1:08:26] these bones and say to them oh Dry Bones
[1:08:29] hear the word of the Lord thus sa the
[1:08:32] Lord God unto these bones behold I will
[1:08:34] cause breath to enter into you and ye
[1:08:37] shall live and I will lay sinu upon you
[1:08:41] and will bring flesh upon you and I will
[1:08:43] cover you with skin and I will put
[1:08:45] breath within you and ye shall live I
[1:08:47] will send you the message of the hour I
[1:08:49] will turn your heart back to the fathers
[1:08:52] I will show that there's overcoming
[1:08:54] power I will restore says the
[1:08:59] Lord that is who speaking here deity God
[1:09:04] himself is speaking here says I will do
[1:09:06] this Hallelujah that's right amen I
[1:09:09] believe
[1:09:10] it glory to he says so I prophesied as I
[1:09:14] was commanded and I prophesied and there
[1:09:16] was a noise like a good fashion
[1:09:19] oldfashioned Revival a good camp meeting
[1:09:22] coming up soon doesn't have to be camp
[1:09:24] meeting you can have your Revival and
[1:09:27] take the fire there that's right it's
[1:09:29] between you and God okay amen get your
[1:09:34] Revival so I prophesized and it was a
[1:09:36] noise Behold a shaking and the bones
[1:09:39] came and gathered bone unto his bone and
[1:09:42] I beheld low the senu of Flesh came up
[1:09:45] upon them and in the skin covered them
[1:09:47] above and there was no breath in
[1:09:50] them say they were at
[1:09:52] Pentecost there was Life coming back
[1:09:56] amen but yet there was no life of God in
[1:09:59] them yet there was no breath in them so
[1:10:02] they they come to church and they get
[1:10:04] all happy and they dance in the spirit
[1:10:06] but yet something's not piercing through
[1:10:08] that Wan thing something's not piercing
[1:10:11] through that desire there's still that
[1:10:14] question there's still that desire
[1:10:16] there's still that real need for worship
[1:10:19] they come to church and they say oh
[1:10:20] praise the
[1:10:21] Lord hallelujah and their hands cannot
[1:10:24] go further than their heads Defying
[1:10:26] Gravity if it goes over your head hey
[1:10:29] I'm I'm being honest I'm not preaching
[1:10:31] against anyone I want to tell you
[1:10:32] something Defying Gravity is when you
[1:10:35] stand and you push your hands because
[1:10:38] you're so deep in sin and you go outside
[1:10:41] of that sin and you go Lord just grab
[1:10:43] these just grab these on here I am grab
[1:10:47] them yes because I'm so deep in sin but
[1:10:51] you can see my hands that's Defying
[1:10:53] Gravity there's not a shame to lift your
[1:10:55] hands in
[1:10:56] church if anybody even laughs at you for
[1:10:59] lifting a hand at church shame on them
[1:11:02] God will rebuke them he will not write
[1:11:05] write them off but he'll rebuke them
[1:11:06] he'll bring them back because it's the
[1:11:09] it's the biggest compliment you can give
[1:11:11] our savior to lift your hands when he
[1:11:14] went to the cross and he lifted his
[1:11:15] hands for you it's the biggest
[1:11:18] compliment you can do nothing should
[1:11:20] hold back your worship from God come on
[1:11:23] nothing I'm being happy now but I'm
[1:11:26] saying cuz it's bubbling in here but you
[1:11:29] can't go bubbling in here and put a cap
[1:11:31] on it year oh my come on and then when
[1:11:33] they dance in the spirit you go like
[1:11:37] this
[1:11:39] seriously but a guy runs and it kicks
[1:11:41] the soccer ball to another guy and he
[1:11:43] kicks it and he missed the goals and you
[1:11:45] like this
[1:11:46] oh did you see
[1:11:49] that but you come to
[1:11:52] church and then it's it's like oh did
[1:11:54] you see
[1:11:56] that I was standing there at the back I
[1:11:58] I I prayed Lord just keep me in my place
[1:12:01] because when they started singing about
[1:12:02] the cross when they started singing
[1:12:04] about the blood this is my message
[1:12:06] tonight is the blood is the cross is the
[1:12:09] sacrifice on Calvary for you see Lord
[1:12:12] had to cut the sin in the Garden of Eden
[1:12:15] I'm leaving my notes now I want to hit

[1:12:20] amen he put us back into that place of
[1:12:23] God of Eden again yes you live in an
[1:12:25] atmosphere of sin you live in a world of
[1:12:28] sin but you have no
[1:12:31] sin you are pure clean and holy before

[1:14:10] Calvary when Jesus Christ laid down his
[1:14:13] life what
[1:14:15] happened the graves opened
[1:14:17] up there were Saints walking in Israel
[1:14:21] and they saw them and they spoke to them
[1:14:24] yes God opened the graves the day when
[1:14:26] he took the cross of Calvary and he died
[1:14:29] and he blew his out there was a great
[1:14:30] Darkness the Earth was shaking and he
[1:14:33] broke open those Graves exactly what

[1:15:05] ye shall and I shall place you in your
[1:15:07] own land and then they shall know that I
[1:15:10] the Lord have spoken it and have
[1:15:12] performed it saith the Lord amen so God

[1:15:53] deny them if they're contrary to the
[1:15:55] word give up to his will Jesus Is Here
[1:15:58] In The Garden of Gethsemane we all know
[1:16:00] that Jesus was led by Vision correct he
[1:16:02] was led by Vision he says I can do
[1:16:05] nothing unless the father shows me so he
[1:16:08] knew what was going to happened to him
[1:16:10] so he goes there into the Garden of
[1:16:12] Gethsemane and we started there don't
[1:16:14] have to put it up it says but Jesus
[1:16:15] prayer Gethsemane goes there in verse 36
[1:16:19] he goes then cometh Jesus with them into
[1:16:22] a place called get and he said unto the
[1:16:24] disciples sit ye while go and pray and
[1:16:27] he took with him Peter and the sons of
[1:16:29] zebede and he became a sorrowful and
[1:16:31] very heavy then he saith this is our
[1:16:34] Lord saying this he says my soul is
[1:16:38] exceedingly sorrowful even unto death T
[1:16:41] here and watch with
[1:16:44] me so he sees the whole crucifixion play
[1:16:47] out before him he knows every stripe
[1:16:49] that's going to happen he knows they're
[1:16:51] going to beat him they know they're
[1:16:52] going to mock him they know his Beard's
[1:16:54] going to be ripped out they know he's
[1:16:56] going to suffer like no man he knows
[1:16:57] that the wrath of God is going to be
[1:16:59] poured out on him for all sin he knows
[1:17:03] this and he's sorrowful and he's heavy
[1:17:06] have you ever felt so heavy that you
[1:17:08] can't move that when Satan comes and
[1:17:11] tells you it's never going to work you
[1:17:13] ain't going to make it it's not for you
[1:17:16] and that heaviness comes upon you now
[1:17:18] times that by
[1:17:20] Infinity then you'll know where are Lord
[1:17:23] Jesus Christ was because see you don't
[1:17:25] hold tomorrow but he did and he knew
[1:17:29] exactly what was going to happen and now
[1:17:31] he's sitting there and he says I'm going
[1:17:33] to go pray and he falls down on his face
[1:17:36] before the Lord falls down yeah and he
[1:17:40] says
[1:17:41] Lord if this cup can go from me take it
[1:17:45] Lord but nevertheless thy will be done
[1:17:49] so now you sit in the world and the
[1:17:52] world looks beautiful
[1:17:53] everything is just pretty outside in the
[1:17:55] world your next new guitar brother Josh
[1:17:58] cuz I looked at you or your fancy new
[1:18:00] car that's coming there brother Jess you
[1:18:02] know you got all the V6 cylinders and
[1:18:04] all those things and and you're becoming
[1:18:06] to start looking at all these different
[1:18:08] things and where do I fit in and what do
[1:18:10] I do you know and these things becomes
[1:18:13] heavy because you don't actually know
[1:18:16] I'm going to remind you of
[1:18:17] something if you just give your will to
[1:18:20] the father and say Lord if I get the FY
[1:18:23] car blessed be your name if I don't
[1:18:27] blessed be your name if I fit in with
[1:18:30] this crowd Lord show me if I fit in if I
[1:18:33] don't fit in blessed be your name if I
[1:18:36] do fit in I'm
[1:18:39] worried because it's contrary to your
[1:18:43] word four-letter
[1:18:46] word see to submit your will to the
[1:18:49] father is to submit yourself to the full
[1:18:51] word of God not some one Bible verse you
[1:18:54] you take your whole salvation based on
[1:18:56] not what a preacher says not what
[1:18:58] anybody said what the word of God is
[1:19:00] asking you and if it's anything contrary
[1:19:03] to this you have the same moment where
[1:19:06] Jesus had it far more greater and far
[1:19:08] more heavier than us he understood our
[1:19:10] weakness and he said father if you don't
[1:19:13] take this cup it's fine but your will be
[1:19:16] done see the thing that you forget is
[1:19:20] when he went to the Cross after he
[1:19:23] suffered the beating the mocking the
[1:19:24] stripes for your healing all those
[1:19:26] things bruised for your iniquities all
[1:19:27] those things that he suffered you know
[1:19:30] they they had these nails at work and
[1:19:32] this is what triggered this sermon and
[1:19:34] brother Ben I spoke to him about it as
[1:19:36] well and they took these nails I wanted
[1:19:39] to put the picture of but I just didn't
[1:19:41] I didn't have time so they take this
[1:19:42] nails and these nails are this
[1:19:44] long okay and it's got like a thick
[1:19:47] place for a hammer to hit and they go
[1:19:50] all the way down and they're very sharp
[1:19:52] and this guy p picks up this nail out of
[1:19:54] the box and I'm walking past and he says
[1:19:58] hey do you know what they call these
[1:20:00] nails to the other guy next to him and
[1:20:04] no he says they called him Jesus
[1:20:07] nails and he ripped my heart because I
[1:20:11] thought Lord these guys have no
[1:20:14] clue no clue what he's saying but it was
[1:20:18] the biggest compliment they could give
[1:20:19] him because those Nails didn't hold him
[1:20:22] on on the cross no matter how big they
[1:20:24] were it was me and you our sin that held
[1:20:27] him there Hallelujah that's why he took
[1:20:30] the cross for you so that you can come
[1:20:32] in this age in this time and have that
[1:20:36] blood and apply it to everything that
[1:20:37] you've done wrong and say Lord but your
[1:20:40] grace is sufficient and the Pharisees
[1:20:43] and the Sadducees and the scribes they
[1:20:45] looked at him and they said others he
[1:20:47] saved but himself he couldn't save
[1:20:50] biggest compliment they could give our
[1:20:52] lord Jesus
[1:20:53] because he didn't come to save himself
[1:20:55] there was Legions of angels He says
[1:20:57] don't you know that I can call now 12
[1:20:59] Legions of angels and they can wipe this
[1:21:01] whole earth just wipe it end it all now
[1:21:04] they were ready Gabriel was standing
[1:21:06] right there looking woodworm was
[1:21:08] standing there right there looking saw
[1:21:10] drawn ready to act the king of glory
[1:21:13] hanging there for me and you ready to
[1:21:15] act he didn't say one word but father
[1:21:18] forgive them oh GL they don't know what
[1:21:20] they doing Hallelujah and then when he
[1:21:21] laid down his left he said it is done
[1:21:23] hallelujah but see we wonder why we
[1:21:26] don't overcome is because we didn't take
[1:21:28] the it is done part cuz we still
[1:21:31] wondering but see if you in Christ if
[1:21:35] you've applied the blood you don't need
[1:21:37] to wonder the blood is for your sin the
[1:21:40] blood is to cleanse you but the
[1:21:42] sacrifice and if you really understood
[1:21:44] those nails for you you would want to
[1:21:48] sin knowingly you don't want to be a
[1:21:51] worker of iniquity so you don't have to
[1:21:53] stress out that this world is wooing you
[1:21:56] get into your word read these things
[1:21:58] because it's life you know I've never
[1:22:01] heard a sermon where brother brandham
[1:22:02] and I'm closing with this musicians you
[1:22:04] can come up I never heard a sermon where
[1:22:06] brother brandham referred to
[1:22:08] himself he always pointed us back to the
[1:22:11] word the full word of God now one thing
[1:22:14] I want to tell you is when they speared
[1:22:16] his side and the blood poured out and
[1:22:19] hit that
[1:22:21] ground that's where the bride of Christ
[1:22:23] was
[1:22:24] birthed that is where me and you got our
[1:22:27] birthplace from because see when he was
[1:22:31] hanging on the cross you were with him
[1:22:33] and in
[1:22:34] him until that was released it had to
[1:22:38] happen and I know that you feel when you
[1:22:41] talk about the crucifixion we all feel
[1:22:43] it we actually feel that day because why
[1:22:46] you were in
[1:22:48] him you were right in him so don't let
[1:22:51] the world woo you you don't let
[1:22:54] financial problems get you
[1:22:57] worried where you sitting at this point
[1:22:59] of time in this pest house don't let
[1:23:01] that get to you that's not the perfect
[1:23:04] VI that's not that's not the Perfection
[1:23:07] Jesus B bought on the cross so see and I
[1:23:10] finish with this in the Garden of
[1:23:12] Gethsemane sin came but Abel made the
[1:23:15] first sacrifice a
[1:23:17] lab and by faith he done it and by
[1:23:20] Revelation from God he's done it he did
[1:23:22] know what he was doing on that day that
[1:23:25] when he was taking that lamb you can
[1:23:27] play anything sister Tiana if you want
[1:23:28] to but he was taking that lamb and he
[1:23:30] wouldn't have had the nice new caliber
[1:23:33] knife and all those things he had a rock
[1:23:35] sharp Rock and he would butcher that
[1:23:38] lamb and that blood will come over that
[1:23:41] lamb everywhere over him over the lamb
[1:23:44] it was a brutal thing that day and sure
[1:23:47] his brother Cain would look at him and
[1:23:49] go this guy has lost the
[1:23:51] plot cuz because he lifts his hand in
[1:23:53] church and when we talk about Jesus
[1:23:56] Christ he says you know that's a Holy
[1:23:59] Roller and you're always going to be
[1:24:01] your outb but see Abel had the
[1:24:04] Revelation and he knew that lamb had to
[1:24:06] die he did but see if you looked at the
[1:24:10] very picture you would see the
[1:24:11] crucifixion right there you would see
[1:24:13] how that lamb was struggling to keep its
[1:24:15] life how that lamb got actually hacked
[1:24:17] and brother brandom speaks about it in
[1:24:19] the sermon two
[1:24:21] pieces because he knew that had to pay
[1:24:23] the price of the wrath of God and Jesus
[1:24:26] did it for us see we mock him when we go
[1:24:29] out there and we listen to the world we
[1:24:31] mock
[1:24:32] that you have deity in you you are from
[1:24:35] a different place you are not from this
[1:24:37] Earth we are coed with
[1:24:41] Christ don't listen to the voices out
[1:24:43] there don't tailor you to the world
[1:24:46] don't do anything of that all you need
[1:24:48] to do is accept your sacrifice and walk
[1:24:52] walk with him you can accept it tonight
[1:24:55] you don't need to be like your friends
[1:24:57] you're not like your friends and you
[1:24:58] will never be like your friends because
[1:25:01] God didn't choose them he chose you and
[1:25:04] if he did choose them he'll bring them
[1:25:05] in because he says all that the father
[1:25:07] has given me will come to me so stop
[1:25:10] worrying about your friends worry about
[1:25:12] God first cuz when you put him first
[1:25:15] then he'll lift you up into a place
[1:25:17] where you have joy that this world don't
[1:25:19] understand and they will want that
[1:25:23] and they will come and ask you why are
[1:25:25] you so bubbling
[1:25:28] arant why the more we give you hard
[1:25:31] things do you smile and wave why do you
[1:25:34] walk past us and sing
[1:25:36] songs why isn't it let Zeppelin and
[1:25:39] Metallica and those songs why is it
[1:25:40] gospel why is your favorite song a
[1:25:42] gospel
[1:25:44] song because it's who I
[1:25:47] am and you know what you could lead
[1:25:49] people to Christ by being who you really
[1:25:51] are amen instead of denying who you
[1:25:54] really
[1:25:55] are but that is between you and
[1:25:59] God Alone no man will judge you on that
[1:26:03] day but God will amen and if you stand
[1:26:06] before him and you've done all you could
[1:26:09] to live for this gospel reach your poor
[1:26:12] sickness and in heal till death do you
