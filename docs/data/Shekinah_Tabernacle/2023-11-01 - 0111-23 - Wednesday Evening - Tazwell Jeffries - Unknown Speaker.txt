that's the desire of our hearts Lord we we we need you father we we and we come oh God lord we we we we could have been so many other places tonight but loving father I believe you gathered us here this evening my God you're going to speak to every individual Heart Tonight including mine so we say thank you in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen God bless you it's uh good to be here it's good to see the familiar faces I just realized I haven't been here for a long time but it's really good wonderful to be here um and uh let's just go into the word it's okay Malachi chapter 4 and we'll read those famous well-known scriptures and if you could hold uh Philippians uh chapter 3 as well Malachi 4 we'll just read verse 5 and 6 it says behold um I will send you Elijah the prophet amen before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse about you but I grew up cutting my teeth on that scriptures uh Philippians chapter 3 um uh chapter 3 um and I think it's verse verse 13 it says here Brethren um I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I doy Lord and and and sometimes we find this to be a struggle forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark of the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and that I believe should be the mindset of us as Believers but now verse 15 says let us there uh therefore as many um as be perfect be thus minded but it goes on it says and if in anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you and I read that scripture by I see the grace of God for me that hey you might not see it now amen you might not understand it now but God is going to come and he going to reveal his word to me and to you me just one last scripture um first Thessalonians 4 and then we'll take our seats um four uh we we'll read verse 15 4 verse1 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words so be comforted tonight Hallelujah with these words amen we are getting out of this place let's just pray Lord your word has been read and we just want want to ask that you have the preeminence in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you you may be seated tonight uh in the presence of God and I know it's it's a Wednesday night and I always struggle to try to keep my time so I will really really try to keep my time uh this evening but um you know how it is as as a as as a Christian um you know the the the Lord is is is really is a he's is's a one wonderful father he's he's a God that that cares he's a God that that loves us and even though you know we find ourselves going through I don't know about you right I think it was um at at the camp and really awesome Camp brother Ben and awesome Camp Believers man and you know when when whenever brother Ben sends out the invitation was ask him I'm the first one the registers always the first one registers and I always look forward to those meetings but um you know someone actually mentioned at the camp and they said you know uh man I don't know about you but 2023 has been a tough year and you know I I I I look at that and and and I I I look back at at at you know the things that has happened and and it's been hard it's it's been tough but at the same time it's it's just it's been glorious and and and you know and you see as the Lord has been whatever the Lord is allowed to happen in our lives we can see growth and we have to see growth and so so so this evening I just want to just start off with this brother branam would say in the in in the Rapture message he says he says there's too much Supernatural Vindication of God's written word of this hour for something not to be approaching us now I believe that we we are we are living in exciting times and he says he goes and he says it's to real he says it would be Astound he's telling the people it would be astounding to you just to let you know what is really taking place and you know when I read that and then and I say you know there are things that's taking place and and and and I'm not I'm not talking about the things happening in Israel those things has got to happen you know there's things happening all around us but you know when I read that I say Lord there are things that's taking place in your people there's things that's taking place in Te and I see it happening and I am grateful when I read this word I see myself in the word am and I am thankful for that he says many of you strangers you perhaps hear these men get up and and make these remarks about and he puts in quotes here a message of this hour and so forth what they are getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do and we see him scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he who do and that's why I say I see myself in this word I read the word and I see the word says this needs to happen that needs to happen and I see it I see it in my life all right and I'm grateful for that you know when when when you deal with Believers and you speak to them you can see what God is doing man and then and you you realize that that that that he's taking you and he's you you are me and you we are evidence brother actually brandom uses the word we are evidence of his victory so you know when we go out there and we live life and a lot of times as I was as I was coming to to church tonight and I was sitting on the train and and I was thinking a lot of times many times we we look at our lives and and we forget many times that we are we are proof of his victory cuz many times we look at our mistakes many times we look at the things that has happened in our lives and we we fall we slip but we tend to forget that in that time maybe in that time period we focus on the negative but many times we need to just look back and say hey yeah I overcame yeah I said no to the devil yeah I did something positive and I seen what God has done in my life come on now so so so so I just want to encourage you this this evening that you are proof of his victory so that when you walking down the street and you might be feeling down and out you are proving that God is God you are proving that there is nothing that's impossible to you you know what and and and as a you know as as as you know I was saying we we we go through things in life man we we we go through struggles at times and uh you know first also I thought to myself I wanted to say thank you um to you as Believers because you know especially the season that my family went through with my sister the sickness and her passing and you realize that you know what when you going through stuff that when people reach out that we are a family and I want to say thank you for that but I want also just drop in you know that um when when when all of that happened and we were praying and praying and praying and the Lord decided to take my sister and then you know there were obviously many questions that came from different people and then the Lord took me to a court and I want to read it tonight because you know many times we we we we we we pray for certain things and we say Lord I need this to happen now or want that to happen or want that to happen and sometimes it doesn't happen or it doesn't happen the way we want it to happen brother brandom who tell us about a a mother and you probably know about this you talk about a mother that had a daughter that was sick and how she they they were praying for this child and I think but the brandom also um you know he he said certain things to them and your child will be healed but eventually the daughter died and the mother came and and she was so despondent because she believed and she had faith that God was going to do the impossible but then she came to brother brandham and the Lord eventually revealed to brother brandham you know really what happened but then she comes to him and she says brother Brandon why did my daughter die or or you know why did this happen in my life why I prayed and I'm praying and I'm praying but it just didn't happened he says so she says is it because my faith is weak is it my weakness of faith and brother Bram says I told her that you have great faith and obviously she didn't understand what he meant by that and he said you prayed for your baby and your husband and you held on to that but God still decided to take the baby he refused to do it because obviously he knows what's best but brother Bram drops in he says even though God said no you know how it is many times in life every time we pray for something we want God to say yes that is just life right we want every answer we wanted to be yes we never want to know from God but sometimes God has got to say I know and many times we don't understand it at the time but then by and by we understand and man I have been there so many times and I today I say father thank you that you said no because if you had if I had to push that way where would I have been so so BR he talks about this woman and he tells he says um um uh he says um even after God took your child he says he knows what's best and still you love him am so even though God said no she still loved him and I read that and brother B says that's real Faith amen even when he says no even when he says no and it's still hard I still love him and you know what I can say this of a personal experience and you know what you've been part of that Journey when God had to tell T and his family no I am taking her but then after he took her did T to love the Lord hallelujah and I can stand here today and say yes brother Andy even so much more I want to serve him I want to just give him my everything yes Lord hallelujah because he's done so much for me I cannot tell it all brother Brandon would would come here and he will just you know just just just talking about how much we need him you know we and I said we we go through things he says no but he wants us to serve him he wants us to honor him he wants us just to give our everything he says yeah he says um he prays a prayer he says um David said he would come into the congregation of the Saints and make his request known and he says tonight there has been many hands perhaps maybe I would say 80% of those that are sitting in the building tonight they raise their hands for request it shows Lord and he's praying that we can't go without you you know that is the testimony of test doesn't matter where I go go I acknowledge and I know that I need him you know in my home we've instituted this hold say it's a rule but doesn't matter where we go my my children does it as well when they're going to school when they going to the shop whether I'm going to go buy milk we I stand there in front of my door and I pray and I say father I'm going down the road I need you and I think that should be our our attitude he says we've got to have you day by day you are our life our joy our health he says our sustaining strength our stay our buckler our shield from the enemy that's who he is to you but like David says I've got to put the lord always before me amen yes that's right he says and we just could not fight this battle of life without you I I I know that I am preaching to the choir because I know that you agree with me that we can't do without him am every single minute of Our Lives we need Jesus amen amen hallelujah that's right and I'm thankful for that I am grateful I am grateful now I was I I read I I I read those those those those scriptures um this evening uh because the Lord's been dealing with me you know how it is we we we we we go through life and we um you know we experien so many things um I I preached I think I'm not sure where it was I was talking about how many times life just overwhelms us and and David David would say Lord when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I and many times we find that that you know there's so many things that puts us so under under pressure that many times we forget why we are here many times we we we we so focused on the situation we're so focused on the problem so focused on Lord I need this Lord I I need you to help me out of this situation and many times we are so focused focused on that that we really sometimes forget why are we here right and brother Bram would talk he'll say in in the second coming of the Lord he you talk about this woman that had 10 pieces of silver right and she'd lose one and she'll do a house cleaning and to find it and once she finds it she'll know you know she'll throw a party and say come and rejoice with me now brother brandom uses that scripture in the second coming of the Lord sermon now he said is this he says now that may seem like a very odd scripture for the second coming of Christ he says but it is speaking of the second coming of Christ but what I want to get at is he says this he says and this great subject that we have here before us now he says one of the most vital subjects in the entire holy R he says there's nothing so important he says as the coming of the Lord and that is why we are here brother kuben we need to hear from him because we need to get into a condition to get out of this place and this precious revealed all open word amen has come my way and it's showing me how to get into the right condition to get out of this place he says there's nothing so important as the coming of the Lord for if he does not come we have been found to be false Witnesses and as I look at you you are definitely not a false witness you are a true witness and you are a you are his victory he says he says and if it if he doesn't come our dead that's in the grave are perished and there is no hope left for us if Jesus doesn't come visibly the second time and I think many times it's so important to be reminded yes sir that Jesus is coming yes and yes we go through life and we experience things and this word is changing us but it's getting us into a condition and we mustn't ever lose focus with the fact that we are getting out of this place soon and very soon I'm going to see Jesus then he goes on here and things that ought to be he says I'm thankful for these open doors that I've had and he says and and and inspiration is GI to to young men he says like your pastor year he says um I'm beginning to get old it said he says now uh he says that that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation and then brother Bram says which I'm hoping to see he says I look daily for him and that was in 1960 1965 he says I look daily for him and brother as I read that I asked myself the question T when you get up in the morning is that your focus are you looking and under expectation for him he says he says here I look daily for him keeping myself prepared for that hour and that's what the word is doing and that's why it's so important to receive whenever we hear the word we need to receive receive it he says we should he said now he goes on he says we should know how to tell the people to prepare for this great event that's coming that's right it's important and and and what I like is that he he makes these statements right but all the answers is in the revealed word it's all there telling us and showing us how to get into that condition to be raptured you know who talk about that that great magnet that would come across the you know in the warehouse and you would say as the magnet goes he says things get attracted to that magnets but there are certain things that's not attracted to the magnet and he asks the question and he says the things that's attracted is of the right material and that is the kind of material that is magnetized to that magnet and this word is transforming us for that great magnet when it comes man he says he says uh we should now to tell the people to prepare he says if the coming of the Lord is so great it's the most essential thing that we can do is to get the people prepared for it and then he goes further because sometimes people would say now what must I do how can you get prepared he says now in end time evangelism he says now we're going to end right here by saying this he says the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture that's right now when I think when I read about the end time message I don't think of books and tapes and all those things that I grew up with but I see the word the revealed word as the message to you and to me brother bandam would say it can't be anything outside of this book so it's all in here power packed and I am grateful that I am part of that I am part of the move of God I I see it in my life Hallelujah the Lord because this message is a supernatural message and you know that right we experience it you know we are a supernatural people we deal with the supernatural we dwell in the Supernatural so he'll go on he'll say testimony upon the sea and he'll give a testimony and you'll talk about that day when he was baptizing his 17th person and you'll say he says you know the Canadian newspaper packed it about 31 years ago across the whole province of Canada he says and the heading was a Mystic light appears over a minister while baptizing in the river now we know the event there right and he says that was in 1930 at the you'll say where it was he says as I was baptizing my 17th person I said heavenly father and I was a young Baptist preacher I said heavenly father I can only baptize him with water unto the fellowship of this church but I pray that you'll baptize him with the Holy Spirit and I said that and he says then something said look up I heard it a third time it said look up he says and I turned and I looked and a great Roar shook around over the crowd and he says and here comes that Light Milling itself down and stood right over me where I was standing he says and a voice came from it and said said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming amen and I am thankful for that I am thankful that the Lord has you know just open up my understanding open given me re I I grew up you know under this message environment as a little child but I'm grateful at the age of 21 the Lord just opened up my eyes and I see the message for what it is it's changing me Hallelujah and I am thankful and grateful for that come on now Hallelujah Lord hallelujah I just want to read this here in in SAR in prison and I hope it's okay to read this but it's a it's a it's a prophecy in that meeting and you can go and listen to it if a brother speaks in another tongue and another brother gives an interpretation and this is what it says my children today I say unto thee yay even I the almighty God has looked upon the Earth today I've seen the evil that this creation has been brought to yay I see the sin that man this day is Walling within yay Dost thou not know that I have done a great thing for theee yay I have sent forth a man in this last day yay that he might be a mouthpiece unto this generation yeah but I say unto thee this day my people many have scoffed at this name yay they have turned their backs upon the things that he has spoke but I say unto thee those that shall hear these words I shall cause great blessings to fall upon them I am the almighty God I shall reward this day for those that shall sincerely receive these wordsall and I thought that was quite powerful yes and I said Lord I am thankful I'm I'm so man this this message you know if there's a a title that I should give this the service today I'll say that this message is a special message to a special people and you know what I was telling the Believers on Sunday I said this message is a message to the heart it's a message for the heart you know we read you know I'll send you my like turn the hearts of the you know of the of the children back to the fathers and I am grateful that this message is transforming lives if you look at yourself today and you look at what you were maybe sometime back maybe a week ago maybe a month ago maybe a year ago how are you today this message as long as you walk under a surrendered atmosphere as long as you walk totally surrendered to this word amen that's right you will see amen a transformation in your life that's right and I'm not just you know this words just coming from my mouth you know what I am talking about because you experience it yourself sir he's remove you this this word this precious word has removed arrogance from tars it's removed stickiness from tears it's teaching tars how to handle situations the things I used to do I do them no more Hallelujah the attitudes I used to have I don't have them anymore thank you Lord because he's changing me yes he's changing me you and I we putting on Christ Our Lives sister Chantel is Christ centered Hallelujah and we we see it you know and this's this quote I love and I quote it whenever I preach and sometimes I quote it too much but brother Bram would say that I wasn't sent to build organization yeah yeah you know that quote right he says Christ didn't send me to build organization he sent me to build individuals am individuals that you and I might be a Powerhouse a house that's holding power Hallelujah grateful for that see it I see it in my life this is a message of adoption you know since since we've been in the message we've been hearing these it's all in the Bible yeah it's all there we just say Lord as as I'm reading your word can you please just open up my understanding Lord give me Revelation you know Peter what did Jesus say that flesh and blood has not revealed this to you Peter my Father in heaven and Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll bow my church and the house of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen so we say father if I don't understand if I don't have Revelation don't you know what I want to just drop this in you might have heard me say it before I'm going to say it again if there's anyone here today right you're sitting here and and and and and and sometimes the ministers preach by the B preach and we have an Andy preaches and and and we don't understand what they saying and then we walk out and we sometimes we and I've been there we belittle ourselves we think it's like it I wish I knew those things I I want to I want to I want to ask you don't ever try to belittle yourself because no man can show you what's really in the word it takes God and God Alone amen so if you struggle Ling with something that's in the word and you hear the ministers talk about it you read it I can't see it you say Lord you reveal it to me amen and you know what might happen the minister might just say something that will just man you find something just snaps you and then you say wow it's always been there I won't forget one day many years ago was probably 12 I was about 18 and I remember I I was sitting in a fellowship with Brothers but I was sitting around the corner there and they were fellowshipping and they were arguing and going crazy and I sat there and there was something that I was struggling with I didn't understand and then somehow one brother just said something and when he said something about the word somehow I caught it and man it was like bells or like light just went open and I said wow I didn't see it like that I didn't know I've always heard the brothers talk about it i' heard this brother say this but then God had to come and reveal it to me personally and this message it's a message of adoption amen it's a message of perfection be what does Jesus say be he therefore perfect and this word is showing you and me how to reach the Perfection this is a message of the body change which is in the word and this message is getting us ready for the Rapture to get out of this place oh thank you Lord oh yes am and many times I say Lord come Lord Jesus when I look at what's happening around me but then also I I told the church told the church on Sunday I said you know what um I like to know what's happening around me and what I used to do then was I would subscribe to YouTube channels like you know Ben Shapiro and uh what's it what's it guy um Jordan Peterson and you know all this Fox News stuff and I used to subscribe to it so what used to happen was whenever new content gets added a popup comes and man the the clickbait that sounds so interesting I want to watch it and what I found was that I started to be so consumed with what they were saying and I started to neglect the real things I need to be looking into and so the Lord then started to deal with me and what I did was that I then unsubscribed myself from all from Ben Shapiro from Jordan Peterson and all these other guys I they said n n i I will not choose when I want to listen to them if I want to but yeah is my source of Truth and I'm grateful for that you see this this message this message it provides us opportunities yeah to experience God in a real way I'm you know I I stand here today and you know I I'm I'm I'm I'm a testimony today of the grace of God I see him doing things in my life and you know it's like I always think of David how you know David he um he had the bear and he had the lion eventually he first Goliath and I see I see how the Lord you know he takes you he gives you this trial and you overcome and gives you that trial and when you sometimes you get faced like right now you know I'm facing something that looks so big but at the end of the day God is teaching and he has taught me he says T don't look at the problem he says focus on the Promises of God all things are possible hallelujah hallelujah and use the opportunities that this word is giving you and me and I I I'll close up with this shortly you see because this this this and these these are things that I I believe we know but this this word it's teaching us who God Is Right it it shows us truly in the word who God really is also it shows us who the devil is right so we know and and and the reason it shows us so that we can recognize the devil brother Brandon would come and say you know what um to overcome is to recognize the devil in his tricks so this word is showing us who the devil is that's right but at the same time this word is showing you and me who you are Michel that you are not some downtrodden something but that you are a son of God you a daughter of God and that there's no devil in hell amen that can walk over you Hallelujah he might try and he will boo at you and he will try to make you think you nothing but don't don't give in Amen to the enemy Hallelujah when he says boo at you you say boo back so you know we we we we need to make use of what this message is presenting to us now I'll read I just got two quotes here he he he says here in the presence of God um unrecognized he says now when he is not recognized his power is always not revealed so you when he not when you don't don't recognize that he's here in a sense you know you don't realize that he's he's here to help you you don't seese the opportunity to reach out and say father I need you so he says now no matter how much God Is Standing present you've got to believe it so it's important that you and I we need to believe that God can that's right so now he says like the woman with the blood issue all of them passing by and all of them standing up saying there goes the rabbi that that's the guy that claims to be a Prophet this is the fanatic and all such as that but what happened happen he says this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was very important that we need to recognize that we are in the presence of almighty God his word says right there where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them so he's here recognize him she said if I can only touch His Garment and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her cuz she realized and she recognized that my healing is there it's a positive thing yeah what did it release to her he says it released his power to heal her but she had to do her part she had to recognize that it was him amen she had to recognize who he was it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way that he turned around obviously said who touched me and then he spoke to her and said your faith has made you whole others standing there might have been sicker than she was but you see she recognized his presence she knew that was her opportunity before I go to the next quote I want to drop in this uh testimony my wife I didn't if I did mention it yeah it's okay you'll hear it again my wife um I think it was it was round about uh 2018 my wife was um wasn't well she was there was a problem with her and the Lord worked things out that uh we had a 2018 convention uh said brother Andrew Glover came and and and and there was a prayer line and um my wife she came through the prayer line and she says Lord this is my problem and father I I I recognize that I am in the presence of almighty God and Lord I am walking through this prayer line because I want to receive healing this was in December and she goes through the prayer line and as she came past I think I was standing at the end and she came past and then as she moved past us she collapsed on the ground and then you know they prayed with her and things like that and then life went on and we went back December um she went back home she was still sick she was still showing symptoms but my wife believed uh January February March my wife was still not well but she believed because she says the Lord told me to go in that prayer line and yes I might be seeing the symptoms but God has healed me February and March and April and May and June and July and August my wife was still showing symptoms but she believed and in September God honored that faith and then one she said Taz the symptoms is gone so it makes me think of you know what the Brandon would say you know when the when the the lights went off one day in the room and and and and and the little girl screamed and the her brother said don't worry there's a man here that can turn on the light right but brother Brandon would make a statement and say yes there's a manual that can turn on the light but he's just holding for a while to see what you're going to do so I want to encourage you with that testimony that you know what we're praying for certain things and and and we we trust in God and we know that God is able to do certain things and if God says yes it is yes God says no he's going to have to help us to accept the no but if he says yes it's yes and it's going to happen he just wants you to trust himall only trust him musicians can come and I'll just read you this last quote here you know just back to the you know this the opportunities that he provides to us so brother Bram yeah would talk about this woman that was washing his feet and he says here talking about Jesus he says then he turns to her I can just imagine seeing her standing there and her big pretty eyes all stained up and her face where she had grease and the dust of the road on her face and she thinks now have I done wrong have I done wrong and Jesus says unto her he says her sins which are many are all forgiven go in peace and brother Bram talks about that that scene and then he says now what was it what really happened there he says she recognized she recognized her opportunity and many times God presents opportunities to us but because sometimes we are so focused on my problem and this thing and that thing that we don't recognize the opportunity that he has presented to us right here in our face where the brandom says she recognized her opportunity she did him a service the Pharisees didn't do it she saw it and she recognized his presence and brother bandam says what did it do so the fact that she comes in there she sees our Lord Jesus Christ with dirty feet and an opportunity is presented to her and she recognizes the opportunity she recognizes him and she recognizes that she needs to do him a service but the B says you know so she washed his feet and then she brother Bram says now what did it release to her she recognized his presence she recognized that she needed to do him a service she realized she recognized that she needed to worship Him brother Bram says what did that release to her he says it released forgiveness he says and that was what she needed so she recognized his presence she recognized the fact fact that she needed to worship him and that because of that it released to her forgiveness of her sins and he goes on what did it also do it also released the power of God to show to them unbelievers that he was a prophet Propet he knowed who she was and just that act of worship that act of recognizing him now he's not here physically right and that we can go and wash his feet but brother brandham would say we worship him when we worship Him and we just give him all the honor the praise the glory we wash him his feet and he says now it to her as well in addition to forgiveness it released to her joy and power and eternal life so the the the the for me when I read that the the the the power of recognizing the opportunities that he presents to you and me and even you know Believers every single Gathering don't don't just brush it aside because God speaks to individuals Hallelujah and he deals with this one this way he deals with that one that way but he presents opportunities and he wants us just to let go and just worship Him amen just give him yes I all recognize his presence let's just pray you can just play anything Lord Jesus tonight we want to just acknowledge you father acknowledge you as the Lord Of Our Lives we want to acknowledge you as our father as our Lord and our savior and Our Redeemer we want to say thank you for the reality that you [Music] are we want to say thank you Lord just for this word the Bible that
