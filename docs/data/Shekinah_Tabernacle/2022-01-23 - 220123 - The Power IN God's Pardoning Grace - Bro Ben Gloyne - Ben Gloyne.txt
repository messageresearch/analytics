our sins are washed away amen that we're free and praise the Lord hello we need room to dance in this place amen we do we do we need to you know you want to dance you dance you dance praise the Lord Leviticus 25 from 8 to 13 says and now shall number seven Sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and nine years then uh shall thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all the land and you shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man under his possession and ye shall return every man into his family notice that it's not that you might you shall that's it there's a law behind this amen a jubilee shall uh that 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which growth of itself and it neither gather the grapes in it of thy why a Vine undressed for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this Jubilee ye shall return every man unto his position praise the Lord amen let's just bow heads in the word of prayer this morning you've got to need just and raise your hands of the Lord amen let's um go before a throne of mercy and Grace this morning dear God we want to thank you we can stand here and Proclaim Lord more than a song that our hope is in you Lord Jesus Lord we want to thank

nothing but Lord with you we can do all things so may you come Lord and do all things Lord For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning I mean so I want to talk about the power in God's pardon and Grace so there's power in his pardoning grace this morning I want to speak about that you know there's just something that happens to a Believer when they experience God's pardoning grace I'm going to use that phrase there's power in it right as we read in Leviticus 25 ye shall return every man to his possession so there was a law in that Year of Jubilee where where where every 50 at the end the Jubilee trumpet was sounded it would be tied and with the atonement as we read and there was a law in that that every man had to go free if they wanted to go free so so it wasn't a suggestion but there was power in that Jubilee or in that pardon that that whatever caused them to to end up in slavery they didn't have to stay in that slavery where they could walk free you know many times they um sometimes they would actually sell themselves into slavery because of debt they couldn't pay a debt so they tried to work off that debt and different things but they couldn't they couldn't free themselves but but God in his great Mercy would pardon them of their transgressions and this is a shadow of what the Lord would do in our day because this was the natural law and this is a natural man shall return you know ye shall return every man to his possession so it was the responsibility of man to restore someone who was in slavery back to their possession now that's just a natural law now how much more under the blood of Jesus Christ now where where it's not man enforcing the word but it's God himself enforcing his own word where a jubilee Trumpet of the Gospel has sounded in this day and everyone who chooses to hear it and receive it can go free back to their possession praise the Lord so back to something that they had in the beginning you know when someone returns to something they return to something that they already had right you never return to something you never had in the beginning that would be going to get something new but we are returning back to what we originally had amen as the Sons and Daughters of God Amen as Adam's Fallen race it has been redeemed we return back to godship over the Earth amen back to dominion over Satan over hell every work of the flesh amen we have dominion by the blood of Jesus Christ over all these things and we have a possession that we have been called to return to amen but I'm so thankful it's God's power that returns us to this Hallelujah yo David would say in the Psalms blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin you know you think about the you know something happens to a Believer when they really experience God's pardoning grace when it's more than something that comes comes into your ears but it's an experience Where You Realize by Revelation you have been pardoned that it's not you trying to be part of not try you trying to earn the pardon of God but you receive it amen you see The Power Within it amen and it moves you it changes your life it changes your attitude towards one another you cannot be the same person I mean when you've been pardoned by the blood you cannot be the same person you cannot have the same attitude you cannot be condescending you can't degrade no one no if you receive Grace you can give Grace but if you've never received the grace of God you cannot impart it to someone else it's impossible because only something that has been received can be given Hallelujah say it's a blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin amen so we're a blessed people today Hallelujah we can Rejoice today because God has chosen not to impute our sin Upon Us amen but he imputed on thee on the originator of sin which was the devil that perverted righteousness and brought sin into the world allowed it to come in amen he is the beginning of it remember sin started in heaven in the in the heart of Lucifer that's where sin started didn't start in the garden it started in heaven amen so now you know there's something when we can just look how we because the Bible would say that he became sin whom you know sin that will become the very righteousness of God in Christ so when you think about hell out no one we could never we could never earn the pardon we couldn't do it no one could ever do it you know the law was actually designed in a way for man to realize he could never keep it you know if the law was able to be kept then Jesus did not need to die Amen to release his holy ghost upon the Earth to change the people's nature from a sin nature to a nature of Faith see it's impossible to to obtain righteousness in our own ability we have to come to that point well we cannot do it in our own strength man has always tried Amen to earn his place with God but that's not how God works that's not how the plan of God works no God earns your place with him amen that's what he did that down Calvary it was his atonement that lifted us up into our position with him it's not our own ability we cannot earn our our Salvation this may be very Elementary at first but there's power within the pardon to move you it moves you to a place Hallelujah Amen brother I'm saying loud now look but God foresaw the bride in the groom Hallelujah see to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knew what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife see and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place he says what a love what a fellowship how can we deny it how can we do anything but love him friend I could stand there for hours but let's move a little farther like the Pentecostal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in This last days as promised is like the abstract tour title deed see now now you get a title so so if you want to buy a piece of property you get the title to that property but an abstract deed means there's been a title search and no and everyone's claims on that title has been struck off so you have a right to possess the promise so now now you think how great our pardon is today that every claim the devil has on our lives has been struck off by the blood of Jesus Christ I mean it doesn't matter what what what your forebe is dead what Spirits are in your family whatever whatever Fallen traits you have your sin nature doesn't matter what they have done what you have done when the blood is really applied that's all struck off your life that you're free indeed amen there's no the devil has no claim on the believer just like Jesus would say I have no part in the devil the devil has no part in me Hallelujah so we can stand amen because remember he took our punishment that we might stand in his place amen what a love that is if we can really look at this part and that he's given us this morning I mean I believe it would change our lives I mean I believe it would revolutionize our walk amen it would revolutionize our thinking Hallelujah amen because when an abstract search is done it searches all the way back to the everything struck off plumbed back from the foundations there is no claim that's able to be made when that abstract search is done and all the claims have been struck off amen it's the same thing with us I don't care what you've done where you've been what you've said things you've willingly done in sin God strikes that off you when the blood of Jesus Christ comes into your life doesn't matter what you've done you say I've gone too far though there's nowhere too far that someone cannot can go that God can't get them amen Lazarus was four days in the grave and God reached down he says I'm the resurrection and the life resurrected a dead man riding in the grave and brought him back so no cases too far the devil will say you've gone too far but you say hold on you're not my God God is my God you're just the accusation you've been cast down I'm not listening to your voice anymore Hallelujah everything that the devil would try and hold against us is struck off but you've got to believe the power of the pardon you're going to believe it does that amen I could I could you know I could you know know I don't have the vocabulary this morning to really give it to you but but you've got to believe it's the there's power within it I mean because if you really believe there's power within it then you can walk in that power amen all the way out into your possession amen so it's an abstract that everything against you doesn't matter whether your mother did it your father your grandmother it doesn't matter amen it's just like the little epileptic child I prayed for this is Brother Brown he says a few minutes ago that came that came from the grandparents that epilepsy fell down upon that child but when the abstract has come it's struck off omitted everything I'm an abstract holder then amen and it sure is a spirit that raised Christ from the dead I have an abstract deed that I'm part of that body with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making that body of word live out exactly like it did in him as he promised in the last days the abstract my sins are all struck out your sins are all struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as an abstract to the title thee that God Gave Me by Grace by foreknowledge oh my so he looked down through Time by four knowledge and saw you and said that's a that's a title deed hold on I've got I've got to take a make an abstract search on that person and take it all away Hallelujah so how powerful that is you know when we read about you know and and um you know there is nothing negative about Christianity the devil will try and say these negative things you can't do this you can't go here you can't say this you can't act like those people he tries to make it like a negative thing but there's nothing negative about Christianity I mean Christianity is all positive hallelujah what do you mean that I don't have to walk by the spirit of the devil of this world I can walk free with God how's that a negative thing Hallelujah there's nothing negative about about the lord it's all positive Christianity eternal life there's nothing negative to it it's everything's absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of God has a positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has a positive hold on him with the Assurance by almighty God by an oath to himself that he will raise him up in the last day and take him to glory and it's not an if and and or nothing it's something that's positive amen so it's not something that's a Ayah I hope I'm going to be raised up in the last day no the Lord gives an assurance amen you're going to go as sure as there's the people that's going to go I mean because remember the Rapture is a revelation amen it's more than a teaching it's a revelation an individual Revelation that God puts in the hearts of the people amen that they are going to go in a translation they're not going to go into the Great Tribulation they're going to go to the wedding supper in the sky and but that's how powerful our pardon is amen remember remember in this day is when the Capstone of the Lord himself would come upon the church and when Zechariah saw that there was there are shoutings of Grace Grace Under The Headstone under the Capstone why because there's a great grace in this day sure there's a lot of darkness in this day of the devil but but God's grace his power is always greater than the enemy he's always the greater than it's never equal God is always greater than anything the devil can do amen so there's actually great grace Upon Our Lives Hallelujah you say well I don't feel a lot of Grace but look you're here this morning you're still a Believer amen You're Still Loving the Lord you're still walking with him amen that's a manifest manifestation of his grace Hallelujah praise the Lord see it's all positive amen as as the Apostle Paul would say in Hebrews 2 he says for as much sin as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself took uh likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death for all their lifetimes subject to bondage so he would not just destroy the works of the devil or destroy the Devil but he would deliver us who that through the fear of death where all our lives bondage to it I'm just changing the words around so now when the pardon comes there's no fear of death as as brother Ron Spencer says death is just a travel bus to get me to where I want to go Hallelujah that's really all death is death death sure it's it's a painful thing to bury loved ones don't get me wrong you know it's a sad thing to have that separation but but for a Believer we just realized it'll just be a few moments you know you can look back in your life whatever years you're up to you think where did all the time go it just it just went like that and it'll be the same thing when we see the dead in Christ Rays our loved ones come forth it'll just be a few moments Hallelujah but you see death CeCe where those who have received his pardon and grace are not under the fear of death anymore Hallelujah I trust you don't you know this is not bravado there's a fear is taken out of your life because that fear is where am I going when when my heart stops beating where am I going to go but when he gives the Assurance I made a way for you and and and I've changed your life by my Holy Spirit I've given you the assurance I've given you an abstract deed in your soul you can just praise God hallelujah I trust you feel that way this morning amen that we are not afraid of this this welcome fall apart it will but we stand as sure as sure as sure why because it's not us holding ourselves as God holding us amen when you realize that this one who gave the pardon is the pardon and he enforces that same part of in your life he enforces word in your life you can just rest and praise God hallelujah praise the Lord if I get happy while I'm happy okay hallelujah praise the Lord see it's such this see this pardon is such a positive such a positive token such a positive Assurance amen it is such a positive thing it's not a hope so or maybe it's a positive it's an assurance that you know that you know that you know that you know him why because he first loved you he died for you on Calvary that's why you'll hear the swan you're gonna think you're not here haphazardly amen we're not here by chance just well let's just well these people are nice I'll just join this group it's got nothing to do with it no the Lord calls us to himself to his word and we walk with him hallelujah it's got nothing to do with these four walls just know the Lord calling you and you're receiving his pardon Hallelujah brother Ram says that the guarantee of that token makes you feel so relaxed not lacks relaxed all tension goes when it comes to you and God all the tension's gone you just let off the pressure you just Rejoice You Can Dance all the way laugh all the way to the bank as the saying goes why because he settled your account holy that's what the pardon does he settles your account we could not pay for our own sins that's why he had to come and purchase our salvation it makes you feel so relaxed I mean we can rest in his goodness believing He'll Do It Again amen remember he didn't stop being God he didn't quit being God when when the when the calendar went to 2023 he's the same God today as he was back then I met exactly the same in character and action indeed every and power everything is he's the same today hallelujah amen he's the same yesterday today and forever but you see when you receive this part and you cannot treat everyone the same again you could not treat people carnally when you receive his pardoning grace then you can extend it to others and you cannot fight carnal with carnal as my wife says you can't fight carnal with carnal but if you have this you know if you really have the pardon you won't fight carnal with carnal amen you don't know you'll you you'll try and stay in a spiritual way see because the devil wants to drag us down to fussing and fighting an argument and resentment and building walls and bunkers we're not here in the bunker building business right this is not what we're here to do we're here to walk free in God's goodness amen I've been so so my parents used to live in Papua New Guinea as you know and where they live the Japanese had their headquarters in World War II and I've been in Admiral Yamamoto who's a Japanese leader of the forces in that area I've been in his bunker it's it's the roof is lower than this it's smaller than this room it's not a nice place you go outside tropical green beautiful you go on this bunker concrete dark dingy we're not here building bunkers so don't build a bunker of a complex and try and hide away come out of the bunker that's what the pardon does is a call come out of your pain come out of your hurt come out of your resentment your own forgiveness it's a bunker you're not meant to live in a Bunga amen we're not nocturnal creatures or some fish down in the bottom of the ocean where there's no sunlight come up where the sun is shining Hallelujah that's what the pardon does amen praise God Amen so we can't be justified in being carnal just because someone said something bad about you that is that is just you're just being dragged down to that spirit's level not that person's level that spirit's level we'd ever want to become countries because people say bad things about us if we want to be like Jesus we want to be the same to everyone hey people said a lot of bad things about him he didn't start getting carnal you know like the disciples you know there's one Village they wouldn't give them food they said can we call fire down from heaven burn them all up what that was the disciples righteous indignation just their carnality rising up let's burn this whole place up and Jesus said you don't understand what what Spirit we're off you know you're trying to be carnal boys you're trying to be spiritual but cuddle at the same time and look what it's going to do you just want to kill a bunch of people no that's no no see they had a lot to learn they had to go to Pentecost that's how they had to learn Amen to really received the receive the Holy Ghost see if you've always got trouble with other people's problems and fussing then you've got to ask yourself have you received the pardon you've really got to ask yourself that question if if your order of the day is some grudge match with someone and you're fussing and fighting and arguing this thing and this person this person and your memory is just full of those things have you really received the pardon because remember the pardon himself said father forgive them they don't know what they do he didn't carry you know he was acquainted with grief he bore our sorrows but he didn't carry grudges and pain and resentment and unforgiveness he didn't carry those things and we want to be like Jesus amen so you've got to read ourselves have you really received the pardon of your if you're always acting that way see the Apostle Paul before he received the pardon man he was he was an angry guy he was he he had a vendetta against these these these Christians this cult he was all our out against it but you see now but something something happened to the Apostle Paul on the roads of Damascus he received the pardon because he met him I mean brothers and children of Israel sometimes I feel like the runaway slave when Paul found him he wrote back to his master he said no no put all videos you put it on my bill and I'll pay it when I come when I think of that I think of Paul here that great Christian how did his heart knew that there was a great charge against him and Christ by his own blood wrote his pardon at the cross and took his place and he knowed how to feel for other people wouldn't it be wonderful if we all had that feeling he says this afternoon but this morning see see he could say that about that slave when he when he's running to the slave master saying saying put his put his put his what he owes on my bill because he realized someone far greater than him he had a far greater bill and the Lord Jesus Paid It On Calvary Hallelujah so so it gave him because he realized the Lord wrote by his own blood as pardon amen he knowed how to feel for other people do you know how to feel for other people this morning amen do you really can you really just say you know Lord don't lay this to their charge because you've received such a great pardon such an incredible pardon man didn't give you this pardon the preacher doesn't give you the part in government God himself says here's the pardon amen is something and he says I choose to receive that do you understand it no but I choose to receive it see it's always see it starts with a power of decision a power of choices like David here a couple of camps goes you decided right there that camp I want to serve you all day I don't want to put words in your mouth that's kind of what you prayed yep yep you and brother um Alpha was preaching that that evening so it started with a decision a decision and look where it's literally Hallelujah transform life see but it starts with a decision praise God we could dance around for the rest of the day Hallelujah this pardon Works Hallelujah praise the Lord but no it makes you know how to feel for other people well they should know better we should have known better we should have known better you know it's amazing the more you know you know Society thinks they can educate younger Generations out of drug taking y'all remember how the draft coming who's who's ever seen how the giraffes or kiwi because now come to the bus and house it don't do drugs kids and you know it says about what it does to your brain and your lungs and you know you know everything what it does does it stop anyone no so we should know better we should know better than to go into sin and go into trouble but and but you know and and and and we take that same attitude against one another well that that sister should know better that brother should know better you should have known better so why do you hold that against them if you should have known better be yet the Lord just forgave you he wrote pardon across your book hallelujah it's amazing you know you know brother Brown would have a um um he would he would encounter story when he went into a diner and there's this old lady about 65 or something all dressed up trying to get these men arms around them drinking and stuff in the middle of the day and you know he just saw the site that made him sick he's being honesty and you know he actually asked God God how can you stand and look upon sin like that how can you just let it go by see if it would make me a sinner saved by grace feel like that what would it do to you holy God you just destroy the thing see he's getting all this righteous ignation against this person hasn't been in their shoes doesn't understand why they're that way but just thinking because it grieved him so much he thinks God how can you stand this if I can't stand it how can you stand it you might just wipe the whole thing off but then the Lord showed him a vision see God always gives perspective God always gives perspective here he is with condemning this woman and these men you know playing there playing slot machines and gambling drinking all this stuff you know and then and and then he was so condemning to them in his heart then the Lord showed him a vision of the earth then there's like a Red Mist around the earth of the blood of Jesus Christ and there's the Lord on the cross and there was dark streaks were coming and hitting him like he says like a car bumper like he's being hit by a car and it was sin hitting him and it was his sins and then he saw that and they began to cry out he says my God have I caused that to you and then and then and then he looked and he said you know he saw those black streaks and they were and they were going into a book that had his name across the top of it and he says Lord Jesus forgive me and the Lord Jesus took his blood and his finger pardoned across the book thrown to the Caesars sea of his forgetfulness and he just started saying oh Lord I really love you for that but the Lord said but I forgave you but you want to blow her up and that changed that changed his whole attitude towards her because he's rejoicing thank God I'm pardon but yet he's condemning this woman right and then so he actually started to talk to her about this and everything and she began to open up about her life and he led her to the Lord in that Diner Hallelujah why because he realized he received such a great pardon but how he was responding to others wasn't according to the pardon he received see he was condemnings all this world that's so dark whatever no it's actually people like you and I are trapped in a cage of sin right and if they're in their right mind they'd want to get out of it but but many times it's pain it hurts it's insecurities lead people into those things and we look at them and say well this world's so dark and you know where's our pardon I'm not looking at anyone in particular okay just you know I'm just trying to look at everyone but don't think I'm just singling you out okay but where's our pardon where's our love for people out there and in here if we've been pardoned from everything and you say well it seems almost unfair you ask Lord forgive me he says okay done where's that gone it's in a sea of his forgetfulness hallelujah it's gone pardon washed in his blood you know some people think that's cheap Grace no it's not because we don't have to earn anything we just have to receive it Hallelujah see now I said how can we see see we want the Lord to forgive forgive us our sins but we want to blow people up something's got to happen in our lives we need the love of Jesus Christ more than ever in this day we need a bit of understanding but uh long suffering we've got to fill that tank up you know a bit of patience a bit of understanding we were there once we were there it took God years to get on our case you know we'd hear service after service and God will be working and God will be and we'd sit there and we'd think it's just going like this and not going in and you know but then but then we're on the other side there where God transforms us and we look at someone else saying why aren't they getting it but we forget it took us a long time to get it took a long time for us to let down our walls and let God start dealing so why are we so impatient with other people we should be we should be more patient you say Lord if you if you put up with a dummy like me Hallelujah God's got patience man he's got patience amen we need patience like his patients Hallelujah you see now if if if we want to see everyone blowing up or if we want to see if we want to be better than other people we want to push other people down in their Christian walk then something's happened to us and it's not a good thing Brother Band would say in the church in its condition he says how many here that's backslidden there's at the end of the service say oh you say I wouldn't admit that brother brown but he says but look if that Dove of meekness is gone from you brother there's something wrong there's something wrong when you can't bear with one another when you can't forgive every person from the very depths of your heart no matter what they've done or what they've said if you can't forgive them from the depths Jesus said if you don't forgive every man whose trespasses from your heart neither does your heavenly father forgive you I mean so there's Something's Happened that Dove of meekness of the pardon I'm not saying you're now Unforgiven but the power in it has left we we never want to get to a state where you're just grumpy with everything and we can have bad days right we're people who who's a person here are we people good praise the Lord so so we have bad days we have hard days you know sure but we shouldn't always just be grumpy with everyone and all that we think about is what everyone else has done wrong against me we should never be in that state right we should be able to forgive everyone from the very depths of their from the depths of our heart that we actually remember because true forgiveness is when you when you actually surrender the right to hold it against the person sure trust has to be earned but give forgiveness should be freely given and you can even you know and and it doesn't matter if that forgiveness is received or not right it's not it's not on your lap anymore you're free of it Hallelujah so we should never ever just be grumpy with everyone brother brother grumpy sister grumpy everything's wrong today forever believers wish me everything's fine everything's good it's Well with My Soul his blood still works he's still redeeming he's still calling prodigals his power is just the same as healing power is here I mean he's he's on time he's still on the throne Hallelujah amen so every Israelite if they wanted to return we're just going to go back to that amen they could return to where they came from now as I said you know if they to return to something as as you're going back to where you came from so for example if someone was from the tribe of Reuben and they and they and they sell themselves into slavery they had to leave their inheritance and go into slavery work for someone else but when that Jubilee trumpet blew they had a choice they could either stay a slave and actually stay a slave forever or they could go free yeah it was up to them but they had to choose to accept it that was a jubilee trumpet because remember the Jubilee trumpet is tied in with the atonement see atonement is made and then the trumpet is blown through the land that the people can go free so now when they when they heard the Jubilee trumpet and uh and and I believe I'm looking at a room of Jubilee trumpet hearers and responders right it's not just hearing a noise saying what was that no this sound has significance you know like you know when I used to work in the lab there's so many different alarms for the freezer and for this this detector and you had to know what they all meant you had to be aware you know you hear it's not just a beat this beep beep beep has a has a significance you know it's not just a sound for the sake of it and you had to be trained to say now this is the freezer and this is this and if this does this you need to do that and all this you know it's the same thing with the gospel you hear the sound we're going to respond to it we're gonna act upon it because there's power within it to take us back to our inheritance Hallelujah so someone who will say for example from the tribe of Reuben you know they hear the Jubilee trumpet they went back to where they came from they did not return to a place that they were not from in the beginning amen because that's not returning that's going to somewhere new Hallelujah so now the Apostle Paul would say in Ephesians 1. he says blessed be the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus according he as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now we know adoption in the Bible is not like in in this world like for example if I wanted to adopt a child now I'd go to someone who's not blood relation will go to someone who's not related to me wasn't birthed out of me and I would take them into my family and write some paperwork now they're my child that is modern day adoption that is not Bible adoption adoption in the Bible means the placing of a son so someone who's been born into the family so very so for example my children if I wanted to adopt them I would come to a certain age and maturity and I would place them in the family that what they say and they do is the same Authority as me doing it that is Bible adoption right so so now notice he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself so the believer's destiny is being predetermined our path has been made that we would come to our placing right as a child of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen now now I know I said on my my my summary last Sunday I want to apologize for it because I said if you have the Holy Ghost and you have the character for the third pull it's a new potential but it's got to grow and mature right so there's got to be a maturity you need the Holy Ghost but then it grows okay amen and and we're well on our road I believe amen but you see but you see our deaths now now this is all part of the pardon because the pardon takes us somewhere the pardon takes us to our position in Christ Hallelujah remember you've got to believe in the power of the pardon amen if you don't believe it it won't take you anywhere amen but you see we have been predised unto the adoption of the placing of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Amen to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us and I say me accepted in the Beloved appraisal in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now we have a right to return now the difference between us and the Israelite is as the Israelite would remember where he came from right because it's a natural piece of land it's a natural where he was born he knew his parents were there his lineage was there he knew exactly the plot of land that was his that he would return to but the difference was that with us is that we are born with spiritual amnesia that we you know you know we don't know where we fell from we don't know where we're returning when we're born we think well I'm from New Zealand or I'm from here I'm from this place and this is my parents this is my history and we think that's our inheritance our natural inheritance but it's not right we're not from this world we're from Heaven you've got to believe you're from who believes they're from heaven amen they came from God they're going back to God oh Lisa now we have a place to return but you see we're born with spiritual Amnesia that we don't know where we fell from but now the Lord comes our way and he begins to reveal to us who he is and it begins to break the spiritual Amnesia you know brother Brown would tell a story of soldiers from the war I think it's World War one and they and they got amnesia because they got too much shell shock under the bombardment of the enemy they just lost their minds they forgot who they were and they're put in a in a train carriage and they're going to be taken to a mental Asylum and that was going to be them for the rest of their lives now now as they were going to this mental Asylum the train stops at a certain station and then and then they let the prisoners out to stretch their legs because they're actually normal human beings but they don't know who they are right they're not crazy they just don't know who they are so so so these men got out and then the guards were watching them because the guards had to keep them to make sure at a certain time they get back on the train and go right but then one of the one of the prisoners or one of the patients what are you going to call them he began to look around in a different way than the other men and he looked up and then he looked at a water tank and then he started walking on a track and then the guards one guard was going to stop him but the another guy said no hold on let's follow him let's see where this man goes and then he begins to walk and he walks down a path he sees a building then he walks and he sees it and he begins to walk now he now he's walking in familiar places but he doesn't exactly know where he is but then he comes along a Garden Path he comes up to a house and an old man comes out the front door runs downstairs my son I knew you'd come home and he Embraces him and then his Amnesia lifts him I mean when his father Embraces him his Amnesia of of who he was where he's from where his mother and father are all those things it breaks when the father Embraces him Ben and then the thing is he begin to see familiar places right and it's the same thing with you and I amen the Lord opens the word to us and he begins to show us familiar places right so so he begins to show us types of like Joseph mating his Brethren but the Gentile bride he's taken is already in the palace saying that they say that the Lord Jesus before he reveals himself to the Jews we are raptured up in glory already oh oh he'll shout in the Book of Ruth how Ruth being a gentile amen would come into the promises of God and be married to the Mighty Man of wealth Boaz amen and she would be redeemed because of that Union it takes him to familiar places amen or the woman at the well we were like the woman at the well amen where where she was their broken life just thinking this is just how my life is going to be an outcast forever but then the Messiah came her way began to speak to her reveal her past amen she said I know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and she said he said to her he that speaks to thee and he opened her eyes amen broke her spiritual Amnesia Hallelujah and that's what the message does it takes us into familiar places in the word amen so what happens is those familiar places begin to move us right but it's not just to take us on a sightseeing tour it's taking us to Father's house I must take him to himself that's the purpose of it and as we begin to walk through types and shadows and we begin to see ourselves and who he is but then finally father comes out amen because he said although the father has given me will come to me and all that come to me all no way is cast out amen so that call of the word that we start walking down familiar places it draws you to him then he Embraces you by the baptism of Holy Ghost is my son my daughter I've been looking for you I knew you'd come to me I drew you and here you are then what happens our spiritual Amnesia breaks and we realize I'm a son or daughter of God I know who my father is I know and whom I have believed Hallelujah hallelujah amen you'll be may have been so shocked by so much training and so many shocks at denomination Creed and things of the world but when you step off for a few minutes and look around the Bible I mean you might find yourself identified with the words of God hallelujah so amen he saw familiar places and then he brought him back to the back to the Father the boy came to himself his Amnesia left him he could identify who he was he knew who he was when he met his father Hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I am but this is where the pardon takes us see the pardon wants to his pardoning grace wants to open our eyes you're more than church people you're more than just religious people you're more than just even Christians don't say that no your sons and daughters of God hallelujah this is what the part in Grace wants to show us amen because there is a power in the truth Jesus said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so there's a force in the truth that will free a person amen it's not you shall know the truth and you shall Free Yourself no he said ye shall know the truth you shall see people in this day say how can you know truth if you're honest and sincere with God he'll bring you to the truth not just partial truth all truth I mean because remember all truth is not a collection of Doctrine all truth is a person all truth is the almighty is Jesus Christ himself amen so if you continue in his word then you shall be my disciples indeed he said and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so in other words you shall know the pardon and the pardon will make you free because there's power in the pardon to free you amen but you've got to believe that there's a force in it amen it's not a force it is the force maybe because the truth is not just a collection of doctrines or ideas but Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life Hallelujah he is the truth amen and if you know him you shall know him and he will make you free that's why I say I can't free myself you're not made to Free Yourself he is made to free you he said I can't fight this battle you don't need to fight the battle the battle is of the Lord I mean because remember every testimony is actually God to this and God did that and God led me here and God freed me here and God healed this person and God did this and God spoke this and God responded this way and God changed me and it wasn't and I did this and I said that and I went here and I spoke to that person and I healed no that's not a testimony a testimony is evidence of him in our lives that's a testimony amen when you give evidence and Court you say this is what happened Hallelujah and so when we give evidence amen when we give testimony it's it's evidence of what he has done that's real testimony praise the Lord will weaken because every testimony should give praise to him when you see it and he did that and he saved me and he gave me the pardon and he purchased my salvation on Calvary and he's redeeming he's washed all my sins away and he's healed me and he's guiding me and he's loving me and he's caring for me and he's keeping me and he's watching over me and he's answering my prayers and he's got my children in mind and my family's come in because he said and he said I'm gonna make it and he said I'm going to be in the Rapture and he's not going to be in the wedding supper and he said I'm going to be Eternal and he said I'm gonna be off streets of gold he said I mean you've got to judge him faithful I mean he is more than Abel he is faithful and true amen that's why you've got to have in your heart member Sarah judged him Faithfully is able to keep that which he promised I mean have you judged them faithful amen because of your judged and faithful he'll do it again Hallelujah and you may have been wallowing an unbelief but he's come to open your eyes and to show you I'm faithful and true just trusted my word trust in me and you shall never fail Hallelujah why because ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah hey man that's why we've got to have such confidence and God wants us to have such utter confidence in him in this day amen that he's going to gather a people he's given us pardon we've chosen to receive his pardon now there's power in that pardon to take us to where we need to go Hallelujah Hallelujah amen the all the all the religious Jews got angry at him saying but we are Abraham's seed we've never been in bondage what are you saying we're slaves we're not him but we're free but Jesus answers in barely realize saying to you whosoever commit a sin as the servant of sin and the servant abideth in the house uh forever so the servant abideth not in the house of evil but the son abideth forever so he's saying there's times when the servants say that they had their wages and they're kicked out why but those who are born into the family stay in the house they don't leave the house don't leave the kingdom of God because they're birthed into the kingdom Hallelujah amen see those he has given birth to they're no longer servants their sons and John is with him in the Kingdom that's the way the church is as joint is with Christ and the kingdom ears of all things to God through him Hallelujah he says if the son therefore shall make you free you're free indeed if the pardon has made you free you're free indeed you're not partially free this is not a joint custody thing between God and the devil and you're the child being passed to and fro no no this is full custody God says I want full custody of my children you have no part in them I have no part in you you have no part in their lives I'm going to cut you off devil Hallelujah that's exactly what he's done by the blood of his son Hallelujah praise Lord amen now with a pardon brother man tells another story of the of the Revolutionary War between the North and the South and there was a there was a soldier a foot soldier any any dis um he he deserted um during a during a time of battle he ran there's too much cannon fire too much gunfire too much smoke and he panicked and he ran from his position then after the battle he got he got captured by his own side and there was an inquiry what's happened this man deserted his post and the penalty for that was was was was death by firing squad so now here was this man and and he was in prison you know he knew on a certain date he was going to be he's going to be shot for what he did but he had a good friend and this good friend realized this is wrong he's a good man he doesn't deserve to be shot like this and he and he somehow got to Abraham Lincoln who was the president and then and then so he would say to the president you know you know Mr President sir my friend you know you know he's a good Christian man but you know in badly got too much for me he ran from his post and now he's gonna be shot by firing squad because that's the penalty for doing such things and you know you know Mr Lincoln he just he just he just took a piece of paper he didn't have his official you know presidential stationary he just took a common bit of paper you know and then and then here just right across that I Abraham Lincoln pardon whatever his name is you know signed the president United States Abraham he just he just rolled up say here here's his pardon and then so his friend is so happy imagine that you've got you've got Authority from the president that your friend can go free Hallelujah and we should be so happy with our friend we've got Authority for more than the present but the king of glory the president of the presidents amen that that we can all go free it may look like a this may not look like presidential stationary right here hallelujah but there's Authority in the word of God I'm going to say that this pardon works I went so he ran as fast he could into the prison went through the outer Gates passed the guards they asked what are you here for I've got a pardon for my friend okay you can come in he comes in before the ward and Mr Warden sir you know private so and so on that cell yes I know he's going to be shot in the morning look I've got I've got a pardon maybe shaking a lot of the socks saying look Abraham Lincoln signed this could I go short to him and the one says sure you can go do that you go that's wonderful and then he goes yo maybe he's sitting in the corner to sell the man who's condemned to die he's just resigned to his own fate you know he's just sitting there and his friend maybe rattles the door saying say Johnny Johnny I've got it what have you got I've got your pardon what do you mean I've got you what what do you mean look at this look at this and then and then his friend Johnny just gets angry he said no no you're mocking me you're making fun of me that's not an official letterhead with where's the watermark where's the Seal of the United States and I said no no no but look look it's got his name it's got Abraham Lincoln it's got a signature he said no you're just mocking me you're just making fun of me anyone could sign that and he turned it down and in the morning he was shot and now an inquiry happened because here's a man who was pardoned got shot he shouldn't have got shot and and and it went to the Supreme Court or tried in the federal courts and the and the decision was a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon so because the man chose not to accept his pardon he got shot now that man's pardon was perfectly good right nothing wrong with it it wasn't a forged letter it was perfectly good I believe the guards and the ward and everyone had control that prison believe that pardon because they let the man in with the pattern you see they believed what was written on the paper but the man who was was four did not believe it he said no this is my fate well I've just I've just been too long like this this is just how my life has to be no God interrupts things we think yeah yeah the devil says this is your road this is how it's just gonna be and this is your and but then God God sets up a traffic jam and you've got to drive off the devil's Road and you find yourself on the King's Highway he's very good at interrupting the devil's plans hello like the woman at the well or Peter James and John any of the disciples Legion that was him they couldn't help him they couldn't tie him up they couldn't subdue him so he's just out there with the you know the mountains and the and and the graves and stuff and the devil thought I've got him oh no oh no one greater than those Devils came his way he crossed the sea for one Hallelujah and he can cross the sea just for one today amen he can leave Heaven just for one right now Hallelujah I believe that's all my heart amen he will leave heaven for one praise the Lord if he would die you know if he only purchased the salvation of of of one person on the calvary he would have done it all the same amen praise God Amen Hallelujah so he had to accept it now if he now you just think about this now if he really accepted that pardon the power in it wasn't just to free him from the penalty of desertion which was to be shot right it so he didn't just stay in his prison cell saying I'm not going to get shot anymore I'm free right and then just take that from him but the power within that pardon was greater than the prison Buzz right it was great so so the prison bars had to give way to the pardon so just say if he accepted that pardon he could take it the prison buzzer hits a open those prisoner bars make way why I've got a pardon I don't have to be in here anymore and then he goes out the prison then maybe there's a guard down the hallway what are you doing out of yourself make way get out of my way I've got a pardon and the prison guard would have to go to one side he'd walk through and then and then maybe the warden will come out because it'd be a bit of a commotion going on here's someone on Death Rows being pardoned this doesn't happen all the time you know maybe other inmates are looking at different things and the warning comes out what's going on what are you doing out of yourself get out of my way Warden you're in charge of me you're in charge of this prison but I've got a pardon you don't have you have no right over my life anymore I am free to walk free and there come to thee come to the prison doors your Gates go outside open up your Gates Make Way for me whose authority the president's Authority as his I can walk out of this place Hallelujah Hallelujah now it's the same thing with you and I you've got to realize this power there's power in your pardon if I can find this there's power in your pardon that is greater than every single thing oh it's probably in here amen here's a few prison guards and levels of security that God's pardon can take us through it's greater than every complex it's greater than anxiety if you have anxiety this morning you can say my partner is greater than anxiety amen it is greater than depression there's power in this pardon right now it's greater than depression amen it is greater than any insecurity you feel insecure when you get out of your comfort zone your pardon is greater than any insecurity amen it is greater than stubbornness Hallelujah there's power on that you see you've got to believe there's power in this pardon right not just to men you're not shot so so it doesn't mean well I'm not going to go to hell anymore there's more than that power right sure that's the first thing that's got to be taken out of your life I'm not going to hell I'm going to heaven right so you're not going to be shot by firing squad right but there's power in the pardon to walk out of every prison now I mean so so that's greater than stubbornness there's more power in the part and then and then than any unforgiveness they can cage someone it is greater than all unworthiness Hallelujah there's power in this part and you say well I Feel So Unworthy we're all unworthy but the devil wants to push us down a whole saying you're not worthy no no none of us are worthy but he's worthy and the worthy one gave you the pardon so I'm walking free holy it is greater than any doubts there's power in this pardon it's it's greater than being backslidden and cold and formal and lukewarm there's power in this pardon to make us white hot again on fire for God Amen why because there's power in this part now what is the power of the pardon its faith is that power I mean faith is that power you know Hallelujah who's with me right now Hallelujah amen there's power in this pardon Amen to Lucius from any any prison nothing has to hold you because there's power in your pardon remember there's no power in him if there's power in him to get out of the jail he would have busted out like a Rambo and been free he would have been on the run somewhere but he couldn't get out someone had to come from the outside in to get him out right and his friend just didn't come empty-handed saying man we've got to get out of here I've got to help you somehow no he went to the right Source amen and he got the presidential pardon and went to his friend I mean so it wasn't his own ability that got him out it was the power and the pardon got him free holy so we're gonna realize that our partner Network who's carrying the pardon where's the baptism of the Holy Ghost have you got that you've got the pardon right if you choose to accept it you've got it if I can say it because remember Faith cometh Faith had to start by accepting in here well what about is it a revelation don't worry about that have you chosen to accept it and just and just walk on with that amen remember faith is that power no no we we must realize that our pardon is greater than Satan's Eden right now it is greater than the lukewarmness of ladies it's greater than this world we live in Hallelujah who believes that I know see it's greater than anything you see we we Marvel at the Masters and how they overcame in their day how they were fed to Lions they were tortured they were sworn asunder you know pregnant woman their bellies were ripped open horrible things happen right and we Marvel at the great faith that they had you admire them amen I believe any True True Believer should admire the faith in another believer right we should be able to admire the faith in one another say praise God that's all I'm so I'm so privileged to know you and know your testimony and know your life amen that's how we should feel about one another Hallelujah you see now see the faith that they used or had to overcome and being faithful martyrs see well well I'll just read it he says now be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yet Millions have died through all the ages they died in the faith like anti-pass the faithful martyr they held out their lives dear unto the death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all the martyrs the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour amen so when we come to a time of great challenge the Supreme faith that you have will give Supreme Grace for that Supreme hour Amen to the faith we have every day is the same faith that they Triumph with is the same faith we have Hallelujah because remember if you don't think your partner is good enough you're going to start doubting is this really good for everything oh it's good for some things well that means you're only partly out of the prison you've got to realize this is this is good all the way to the body change this pardon is good amen and there's no sub Clauses in it the devil can get in and trick you and Rob you of the pardon if you have that pardoning grace of God it is good for everything amen right up to the change of the body hallelujah amen now Faith Faith brings the word into manifestation right because the word can't just be argued about or talked about it's got to be manifested that's what the Lord is working looking for for his promises to become flesh I mean so so the pardon the power and the pardon which is Faith brings the pardon into manifestation Hallelujah amen so what does it do it brings Deliverance in a manifestation it brings healing into manifestation amen it brings it brings every promise of God becomes manifest Why by the power in the pardon Holly is as as um Paul would say in Hebrews 11 that through faith subdued kingdoms wrote righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions what was that that was the power in God's pardon having caused those things they obtained promises righteousness subdued kingdoms what through the power and the pardon Hallelujah amen now now this part and you think about it it'll take you to one place but it'll stop you going to another place so before you head the pardon your your road was to destruction doesn't matter who you are your lineage whatever how holy or good your how Spirit-filled your parents are grandparents whatever we're born on a road to destruction right but the pardon stops US going on that road it actually diverts us off that road onto the road of righteousness Amen to this power and God's pardon to stop us going into the Great Tribulation Hallelujah it actually stops when you've really received this part that's how great it is when you really receive this pardon you can't go to the Great Tribulation Hallelujah because a full pardon is the body change amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now then we also need to realize so I think time is time is time is running away but but we need to realize that there's power in this pardon not just for ourselves right remember Christianity is not just for yourself sure you meet the Lord yourself but now God wants to use you to reach others Amen to this power in this pardon not just for you but it's for your family amen like like Paul and Silas would have a praise you know you're an all-night prayer meeting they're in the jail Hallelujah they didn't care they were beaten they didn't care because remember their thoughts went Heavenly and not kindly say when they weren't looking at their stocks no more in their beatings and the pain and the Darkness and the inner prison and the dampness and the rats and the whatever that was going on in there they began to think Heavenly our God is so awesome our God is so great they begin to testify one to another about his goodness and Silas would say I remember when Jesus found me and the Apostle Paul would say man the roads are Damascus I I'm never the same traveling that road there's always that spot that I remember oh look it just comes back to me as amazing grace and they begin to sing the Psalms and praise God hallelujah then then it's like they went in prison no more but they were totally free and that's the thing you can be bound and changed but you're the freest person in the world I mean like the Apostle Paul when he went before king of gripper and chains he wasn't the chained one king of gripper and those were actually chained in sin he was the free man Hallelujah so it may look naturally like we're Bound in some way no no we're free Hallelujah so they begin to praise God then God came down and his presence filled the prison and there's an earthquake is shaking and all the prison does bars came open the doors came over and then the Jailer woke up you know pulled out a sword saying well they've run away so this is the end of me but then he heard a voice from the end of prison don't kill yourself we're still here hallelujah hallelujah and then and then he began to realize he yo he asked the question we went down his knees before Paul what must I do to be saved and he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved so basically the Jailer said how can I get this pardon that you're enjoying because I know it's not just for you there must be some of it for me I'll lose to the so that Jayla was told this is how you get the pardon believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and it's not just for you the pardons for your house it's not just for you this is not just for you this is for your wife for your children your house and so he was told to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved so in other words believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for your house right so apply the same pattern you have upon them in faith Hallelujah so don't just don't just say well it's just for me and somehow they've got to get no you the same Faith you have for you use on them how do you do that in prayer and being a witness living a surrendered life creating a right kind of atmosphere not getting carnal with them not getting all fighting and fussing but have such an atmosphere around you of the Holy Ghost can you do it absolutely absolutely we can walk an unconscious of fear we can walk unconscious of criticism we can walk unconscious of fighting and fasting we can ride all above it and that's not being oblivious but you're in such an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost everyone can be fighting around you but you're just walking in perfect peace why because you're carrying a pattern Hallelujah and you think man if those people only knew what I had in my possession and they said I've got good news for you it's for you too and it's for you it's for all of you if you want it hallelujah what do you do create an atmosphere of power around you that your family see something's happened to this person they haven't just joined a church or some religion whatever no no they've received a pardon amen because remember when you receive the pardon you're not receiving a Doctrine you're not receiving a denomination you're not receiving a church membership you're receiving of the almighty God the Lord Jesus Christ the god of the Bible himself Hallelujah amen that's why we should we should apply this apply this pardon not just for ourselves but for everyone Hallelujah because the Philippian jealous yeah he said rise and be baptized Paul said to him now believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and not in the house shall be saved well believe for on the Lord Jesus Christ for your house apply the token to your house Hallelujah that's why we've got to pray oh Lord the Holy Spirit lives within me catch my daughter there I'm going to it now with your anointing upon me he'll do it amen amen because remember we aren't here just to occupy pews Christianity is not just sitting in a church twice a week that's not Christianity Christianity is in everyday life this partner is not just that you get to sit in a church that's got nothing to do with it I mean but it's a rugged everyday walk where God lives I mean because part of the partners I'll never leave the nor forsake them you shall know me in the power of my resurrection you'll know my promises you'll know I'm true you'll know my character you know I'm with you amen that's what's in the pardon Hallelujah Hallelujah so we can now walk yeah we're here for one another we're here for this world this for this community you say well I can't preach but you can live a life you can live a sermon you can live a sermon you can live the revelation of the Seven Seals you can live the future home you can live the token you can live the pardoned message I mean you can live Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever well how do you live that you let him live through you right so what brother Brown preached about is manifested in your life you become a living epistle read a known of all means you become a living pardon what people read your life you say Something's Happened to that person they're different it's not just by the way they dress there's something in their nature it's more than just a natural nature and you get salty that I want to be around those people you know people who just want to be around you why because they actually love the Lord within you they may not know who he is at the moment but there's just something that you attract people what is that that's the pardon attracting people Hallelujah why but you've got to give the pardon to those people praise God Hallelujah amen because if you look at Revelations 10 when the mighty angel came down with an open book what is that that's the pardon come open that's the fullness of the pardon right the Believers down Through the Ages had it but now it's all come open the word has all come open what so by what do you mean through come one with the pardon and speak the pardon Hallelujah see so so we don't just absorb the word and it just sits in there no it's got to come out as a lived voice as a manifested word out of our Lives the pardon becomes manifested well how does that part of work well someone you know does something wrong to you you have the pardon you say father forgive them you know it's like water off a duck's back you just walk on why because you've got a pardon you can't help it you've got a different nature I mean you don't have a cartilage you're not walking like men anymore you're walking like the Son of God because his faith is within you Hallelujah that's how we should be amen so I'm just going to wind it up just there I'm just going to land the plane just like this do you have the pardon does your life show you have this pardon more than just being part of a church more than even just getting baptized in Lord Jesus Christ which is the Bible do you have you chosen to receive this pardon and is the pardon manifested in your life or have you forgotten what he gave you have you forgotten what he gave you you know the value of what's in at brotherbraham tells the story of a boy who went up to an attic one day up to his father's attic and he found a stamp he wanted an ice cream got this stamp ran to the ice cream you know the dairy the corner Dairy says I want a double scoop what are you going to pay for it with this now the owner of the store said yep sure took that stamp sold the Flight 500 what a few thousand dollars nowadays you know and then and then the stamp Trader sold that that he sold it to sold it for like five hundred thousand dollars and then that guy sold it for more why because the boy didn't know the value of what he had he just thought well I want an ice cream you know but the reason he didn't know the value of that stamp is because his parents put it in the Attic it wasn't on the mantelpiece in a picture frame it wasn't the value of it wasn't taught to the child that's why he sold it for an ice cream right and it's the same thing with the power of the pardon if it's put up in the attic its value is forgotten how can our future generation how can our children know the power of this pardon you have received right they'll sell it for an ice cream we don't want to sell this pardoning grace for a night trade it for something of the world that actually has no value right but the reason he didn't know the valley because it wasn't taught him the value why because their lives weren't actually saying look at the stamp we have look how much this is rare this is one of a kind this is incredible right it was just put up in the attic put away in storage somewhere now that's what I say maybe you've forgotten the power of the pardon that you have because they forgot the value of that Stamper put it in the Attic now how about you and I this pardon you have do you know its value do you carry it around didn't you or do you walk calmly as men do you have the pardon are you fussing and fighting with everyone all the time is it always drama if it is I say you need to make sure you have that pardon amen because this is serious time you don't have the part and you're not going if you have the pardon you're going but you've got to choose to accept it well I need the Lord to tell me you've got to choose to accept it and then the power of the pardon can start manifesting in your life if that man who is going to be shot chose to accept that pardon he may not understand it why isn't it on the right page and blah blah blah but he chose to accept it the power of that pardon with a manifest he walked out he would have walked out a free man it's that simple let's not turn it down today friends I mean let's have the musicians this morning he'll come forward
