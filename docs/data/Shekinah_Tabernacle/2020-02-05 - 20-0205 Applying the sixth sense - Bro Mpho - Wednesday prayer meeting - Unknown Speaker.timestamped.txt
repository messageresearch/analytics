[24:32] service into thy hands Heavenly Father
[24:34] that take away all our men would and all
[24:38] our men way father they got away all our
[24:43] our thinking take out all our our ways
[24:47] of doing things father as human beings
[24:49] father and come in the service father
[24:52] and forgive us our wrongs father we know
[24:56] that we are not perfect Lord but you are
[24:58] perfect Lord and that is why we invite
[25:01] you in this service that that the devil
[25:04] who who comes and and disrespect your
[25:07] father tonight he can be exposed we
[25:11] commit the service into your hands as we
[25:14] welcome your presence now in the name of
[25:16] our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[25:20] god bless you I'm sorry for my language
[25:23] my English is not so good so may the
[25:26] Lord bless you as I greet you all in the
[25:30] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[25:33] may God richly be your provider tonight
[25:37] because as for me I've got nothing that
[25:41] I can provide for you amen
[25:42] but we thank the musicians you can take
[25:45] your sister Isaac thank you very much
[25:46] for creating the atmosphere together
[25:50] with brothers and sisters
[25:52] may God bless you while we are standing
[25:56] let's just read the book of Hebrews
[26:00] chapter 11 brother maybe you can just
[26:07] put for us there at presentation just
[26:11] the first page oh if it's possible I
[26:14] forgot to ask for that little thing to
[26:17] press I like it amen god bless you I
[26:29] mean while we are we are on our feet in
[26:36] respect and honor of the Word of God as
[26:38] the Prophet taught us let's read hebrews
[26:39] chapter
[26:45] let's read Hebrews chapter 11 I mean if
[26:53] you they just say Amen now faith is the
[26:58] substance of things hoped for the
[27:00] evidence of things not seen
[27:03] for by it the elders obtained a good
[27:05] report through faith we understand that
[27:09] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[27:12] God so that things which were seen were
[27:15] not made of things which do appear by
[27:19] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[27:22] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[27:25] he obtained witness that he was
[27:29] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[27:32] and by eight he being dead yet speaketh
[27:37] verse five by faith Enoch was translated
[27:40] that he should not see death and was not
[27:44] found because God had translated him for
[27:49] before his translation he had this
[27:52] testimony Alleluia that he pleased God
[27:56] less six
[27:59] but without faith it is impossible to
[28:01] please him who God am i right for he
[28:05] that cometh to God must believe that he
[28:09] is and that he is the rewardin he is a
[28:12] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[28:15] Him
[28:16] maybe we can just pray again Heavenly
[28:18] Father Lord I don't have the waist
[28:20] fathom as I'm standing here I'm just I'm
[28:24] feeling empty I don't know how and where
[28:26] to start Lord but I just want to commit
[28:29] these ways that we have read into thy
[28:32] hands that Lord you can just come and
[28:33] take away all our abilities what we
[28:37] think we can do because we can't do
[28:39] nothing may you come and preach to your
[28:41] children and talk to them in your own
[28:43] way inspire the service inspire their
[28:45] hearts inspire the lips father we commit
[28:48] the sin listen to thy precious hands in
[28:50] Jesus Christ wonderful name amen amen
[28:53] you may enjoy the seats the comfort of
[28:57] your seats while I remain standing and
[29:00] tonight I'm just in as I told you last
[29:05] time I'm not a minister as the so called
[29:09] minister but I'm just a brother whom I
[29:13] want to relate with you on what we
[29:15] talked about and that we can see the
[29:17] thought that I'm trying to to bring to
[29:19] you amen after all we read from the
[29:22] message and then we try to repeat what
[29:25] the Prophet have said is very difficult
[29:27] to preach after Sunday service because
[29:30] you know when they say you need to walk
[29:35] this road and someone walks it in ten
[29:37] minutes
[29:37] another one or last Wednesday walks it
[29:39] in five minutes and they do they keep a
[29:42] record now when you come and you know
[29:44] you can run that Jenny in such a time
[29:47] you feel insignificant but the Lord is
[29:50] the one who's significant tonight amen
[29:52] how many I happy to be in the service of
[29:54] the Lord if I say anything that doesn't
[29:56] go well with you just know that I'm
[29:59] actually referring to myself I'm
[30:02] preaching to myself but I pray that the
[30:05] Lord will bless your heart amen tonight
[30:08] all of us to take a thought a thought
[30:10] that emanates from the message
[30:12] is that the Prophet spoke that says
[30:14] applying the sixth sense amen
[30:16] and then there are many different ways
[30:20] you know how we do things and this the
[30:23] sixth sense you know it's not your
[30:25] common sense am i right
[30:26] I'm not talking about the common sense
[30:28] you know there's many senses in life I
[30:31] mean
[30:31] so we some talk about the common sense
[30:35] you know we taught you tell someone
[30:36] something and he says no that doesn't
[30:37] make sense but they say no that doesn't
[30:40] have class that does not have common
[30:42] sense oh no I don't it's not sensitive
[30:45] or any other perspective that a sense
[30:48] can be explained they are there but the
[30:51] cells that we are talking about tonight
[30:53] is the sixth one I mean the Prophet
[30:56] calls it the super sense amen
[30:58] and he also calls it the sixth sense
[31:00] amen amen
[31:02] when I say I mean I would like you to
[31:04] say aim then you you are helping me to
[31:08] not to be too nervous
[31:10] and sorry my African accent can get a
[31:14] bit hard sometimes but I mean good I
[31:18] mean well I mean so we are going to look
[31:23] at just three or three points three
[31:26] points that we are going to look at
[31:27] tonight the first one is what is what is
[31:30] it what is this sixth sense
[31:31] I mean what what are we talking about
[31:33] when we talk I know you know but we just
[31:36] want to come to a point where they say
[31:38] in English we refresh you know we click
[31:40] a refresh button on the computer and and
[31:43] at any and you you do what we call a
[31:46] refresher course right and and you do
[31:48] another an introspection and
[31:50] introspection it means you go back to
[31:52] yourself and look if you are still
[31:54] reflecting the mirror of the word of God
[31:57] amen so look at what what what is it
[32:00] what is this a sixth sense amen and then
[32:02] we'll talk about the purpose of the five
[32:05] senses because as I said to you there
[32:07] are many senses right and some you can
[32:11] touch them you can see them some some
[32:13] you can hear about them the senses but
[32:15] we will look at the specific ones that
[32:17] were god-given they are called the five
[32:20] senses they were god-given you'll see as
[32:23] we go along why I'm saying they are
[32:24] god-given
[32:25] and then lastly we'll talk about the
[32:28] pimples and application of The Sixth
[32:30] Sense amen how should this extends be
[32:33] applied why is it important well what is
[32:36] the pepper I can reason why we talked
[32:38] about this sixth sense I mean are we
[32:40] together now let's just start with this
[32:44] one what is it this sixth sense you see
[32:50] there where we have read now before we
[32:54] go there let's let's just say what what
[32:57] is the sixth sense we know that the
[32:59] Prophet taught us and the Bible taught
[33:01] us that is faith am i right
[33:03] but now look some people will explain it
[33:07] differently and say maybe it's a gift
[33:08] and it's some who says a foundation
[33:11] someone says they believe some will say
[33:14] yeah is the Holy Spirit ah isn't it
[33:17] worry and some will say is revelation or
[33:20] experience every individual can have a
[33:24] view or an opinion about what is the
[33:27] sixth sense I mean but the fact of the
[33:30] matter is that as we have read in the
[33:32] book of Hebrews the Bible says it is the
[33:36] substance of things hoped for and the
[33:38] evidence of things not seen
[33:41] that is what faith is and that's what
[33:44] the Bible says we can explain
[33:46] we can do so many things but and we can
[33:49] still be right but the most pre-canned
[33:54] an invisible intangible explanation the
[33:58] Bible says faith is the substance of
[34:00] things hoped for that's the six things
[34:03] we are talking about and it is the
[34:04] evidence of things not seen
[34:07] that's a powerful statement that
[34:10] statement is what you call loaded you
[34:12] know it sir is there someone in itself
[34:15] it needs to be unpacked and unpacked it
[34:18] will take another three hours just to
[34:20] talk about this that this one and then
[34:24] that is the substance of things hoped
[34:26] for
[34:27] ah then the mind start to think what
[34:32] does this mean what does this verse mean
[34:34] and it goes on it says is the evidence
[34:37] of things not seen I've never heard of
[34:40] any language like that in the whole
[34:41] world
[34:42] I will if I only find it in the Bible
[34:44] I've never heard of a language where
[34:46] they tell you that something because a
[34:48] substance is something that is
[34:51] attachable but if something that is the
[34:53] effect an effect one of my old friends
[34:56] said what is the effect effects effect
[34:59] huh its effect so when we talk about
[35:04] substance it has got its own history
[35:07] where you can go in the dictionary and
[35:09] read but a very proper proper way is the
[35:12] scriptural way right is there things
[35:15] substance of their things hoped for the
[35:17] evidence of things unseen evidence is
[35:20] proof you know proof how can I tell you
[35:23] that it is a proof of things not seen I
[35:27] mean even in the court of law they'll
[35:29] say what are you talking about have you
[35:33] seen him no I have not seen him but you
[35:36] say you've got the evidence you say no
[35:38] no is the evidence of things not seen
[35:39] they say put this guy in jail because
[35:44] you cannot explain what you cannot bring
[35:48] the evidence as far as the worldly level
[35:51] is concerned and I can tell you for
[35:53] those of you who are thinking I had you
[35:55] can already say that ha if there isn't
[35:58] like that
[35:58] they are reasoning within the five
[36:00] senses you see but the moment you go
[36:03] beyond the five senses now you're
[36:05] talking about the evidence that you
[36:07] cannot see but it is the evidence it is
[36:11] the proof that is what faith is about
[36:13] amen so let's just take it one step
[36:15] further and say a look at firstly what
[36:18] is there listen why we have this
[36:21] so-called
[36:22] five senses we know them don't we can
[36:25] anyone tell me one five senses Debbi
[36:29] smell what we touch touch touch my girl
[36:35] that it would Jesse taste very good
[36:38] becquer fill up what good children money
[36:42] and I don't see others raising hands
[36:43] Jonathan here very good my boy right
[36:50] explicitly pens for this children
[36:54] another manís are not wasting time so I
[36:58] can assure you these children they know
[37:00] what you're talking about
[37:01] and we say feel smell touch and sorry
[37:06] feel smell touch see and tastes those
[37:10] those are the five senses that we are
[37:14] talking about and I'll tell you what
[37:16] those senses were given by God they were
[37:19] given by God for them to benefit us we
[37:22] may say that now we can yes it's true
[37:26] the Prophet says you do it but we don't
[37:28] use them to contact God yes does anybody
[37:31] get that point but does it go above your
[37:33] head
[37:34] we I'm using my mouth to pray right I'm
[37:38] using my eyes to read the Bible I'm
[37:41] using my well I can smell you know I'm
[37:44] my touch I touch my brother I feel the
[37:47] love huh
[37:48] but yet I'm saying that you cannot use
[37:51] them to approach God what do I mean by
[37:53] that because they were not meant to
[37:56] contact God that is why when we lead in
[37:59] this in this message here the Prophet
[38:00] says in the message faith is the sixth
[38:03] sense 11 June 1916 now notice that these
[38:07] senses that this census was given to you
[38:10] only only to contact the Ethne home are
[38:15] you are we together that you might see
[38:18] taste feel smell and hear but they are
[38:20] by no means to lead you they are not
[38:24] meant to lead you yes you utilize them
[38:28] as your channels but they are not meant
[38:30] to to lead you as far as contacting God
[38:34] is concerned they are meant for you to
[38:36] contact your earthly home predominantly
[38:39] and let us say totally totally not even
[38:42] partially totally amen
[38:44] and the Prophet continues in that sermon
[38:47] he says but we stumble at it you see it
[38:51] is not enough we we depend too much on
[38:54] these five and that's the problem
[38:57] we depend too much on our five senses
[38:59] until they almost want to take the space
[39:02] of the six
[39:03] since and that's what the Prophet is
[39:04] trying to warn us about he says and when
[39:06] well and and and when most of the time
[39:09] to 95 percent of the people or better
[39:13] what do you mean is that 95 percent or a
[39:15] path that's very scary as soon as they
[39:19] see the five senses is finished we stop
[39:23] them so we don't go way past the five
[39:28] senses we stop by the person's like
[39:32] happy
[39:33] oh I'm like this oh I'm seeing this then
[39:35] we stop at the pass senses but meanwhile
[39:37] we have another sense which is called a
[39:41] sixth sense which an actual effect is
[39:43] supposed to be above is supposed to lead
[39:46] us to pass through the five senses are
[39:48] we together
[39:49] and so we would only have to wait there
[39:52] because the five senses have got the end
[39:54] some way they stuff somewhere they in
[39:57] some way that's what the Prophet says
[39:59] that that well is gone dig my grave get
[40:02] my casket ready that go on finished it's
[40:04] done done brother in the city so so it's
[40:07] not supposed to be that way
[40:08] because the five senses you when you are
[40:11] born you are given those ones and then
[40:13] you get your casket it's done with the
[40:15] persons but this one that we are talking
[40:17] about the Bible says that that's three
[40:22] through faith we understand that the
[40:24] worlds were framed by the Word of God
[40:28] through faith you see this kind of a
[40:30] sense that we are talking about it
[40:32] doesn't start when you are born no no it
[40:34] made the world it makes the app it made
[40:38] everything that you can see and those
[40:40] things that you can see faith made them
[40:42] that's the cells that we are talking
[40:44] about that's the sense that I'm trying
[40:46] to say we have to operate from that one
[40:48] are we together
[40:50] let's read furthermore sorry today I'm
[40:53] just gonna read I'm gonna talk I'm not
[40:55] going to talk a lot I'm just gonna read
[40:56] a lot I mean the Prophet says in the
[40:58] super-sense
[40:59] 27 December 59 God gave us those senses
[41:03] but they are given to us a gift I read
[41:08] in there they were given to us si why is
[41:11] it here can everybody see this one they
[41:15] are given to us as a gift s
[41:16] alluded earlier now they are given to us
[41:19] as a gift the key is it depends on how
[41:23] you want you what you use these senses
[41:28] to us and that's where the real things
[41:30] begins here because these gifts and they
[41:34] are dependable on you now the question
[41:38] is on me then Who am I then what what
[41:42] what sense do I use for me to be able to
[41:45] channel or to yield those senses that
[41:48] means this I'm honest in some way but
[41:51] sense that is supposed to yield these
[41:53] senses to direct some way because listen
[41:56] to this will be the way that you your
[42:01] life is controlled you see the way you
[42:03] use those five senses what do you see
[42:06] what you hear what you taste smell or
[42:08] feel whatever those senses are yielded
[42:11] to that they will dominate you right now
[42:15] you are seasoned believers and message
[42:17] readers I believe in the way in the
[42:18] Bible there's two senses in the heart of
[42:22] men faith and doubt now how can i
[42:27] without without using this very five
[42:30] senses how can I control and yield them
[42:32] or what must what tool must I use there
[42:35] must be another sense that is more
[42:37] superior that is more powerful that is
[42:39] more dominant that I must yield but I
[42:43] must channel these five senses so that
[42:46] they must not control but they can be
[42:48] controlled damn these five senses are we
[42:52] together Hannah amen the Prophet goes on
[42:55] to talk about the story or to give us an
[42:57] example and say that you see if I've got
[43:01] eyes now as you can see me and then he
[43:04] says that though if I can just deny to
[43:08] see I just type myself I find myself
[43:11] here and I say no no I don't want to see
[43:13] or I practice in my ear I don't want to
[43:16] hear and I continue and do that
[43:19] continuously
[43:20] right he said the Prophet that I'm
[43:24] eventually my eyesight will be affected
[43:27] and he says that a
[43:29] I do that and my son come and I teach
[43:31] him that kind of a thing I'm also
[43:33] binding he does that to his children
[43:36] twisty eventually will be a generation
[43:38] of people that are blind because we
[43:41] refuse to see and yet God has given us a
[43:44] sense to see so eventually we will be a
[43:48] blind generation but God has given us a
[43:50] sense what I mean by the brothers and
[43:54] sisters is that the sense that God has
[43:56] given us which is called the sixth sense
[43:58] it must be utilized otherwise it becomes
[44:02] a generation of faithless people and
[44:06] then it becomes a generation of people
[44:08] who are Christians but they don't have
[44:10] the faith but yet God has given them
[44:12] that sense because that sense it doesn't
[44:16] start when you are born brother Arnold
[44:17] it gets given to you before you are born
[44:19] is yours it's just like the gift that
[44:22] God has given you of eyesight and
[44:24] everything when you are born you are
[44:26] given but that one God has given it to
[44:28] you as a Christian and the Prophet says
[44:31] somewhere that is only given to
[44:32] Christians huh he's given only to
[44:36] Christians isn't it I mean that's what
[44:38] the Prophet says I'm read it for you
[44:40] later on you'll see now let's just
[44:42] continue
[44:43] I also pleased to my wife now what is
[44:51] the purpose of these five senses as we
[44:53] as we as we move on the five senses
[44:56] where they are very important and the
[44:58] Prophet is acknowledging this is the
[44:59] five senses are very important to
[45:02] contact the air we live in not to be
[45:05] guided and control you
[45:07] he's very is very clear and particular
[45:09] about that we cannot utilize them
[45:11] because these five senses they can
[45:14] mislead you and they can lie to you but
[45:18] the fixin's cannot lie to you you see
[45:21] that is the key
[45:22] the first senses that we have that are
[45:24] very important that we contact our our
[45:27] earth with as far as God is concerned as
[45:30] far as our destiny is concerned as far
[45:32] as the best things that will give us
[45:34] eternal life are concerned they can lie
[45:37] to you they can lie to you you can just
[45:41] know one of us you can know
[45:43] tell me that one of your five senses
[45:44] never lied to you the fact that you got
[45:47] sick that means your senses were lying
[45:50] to you because you are not sick did
[45:53] everyone hear me if you say you are sick
[45:56] and you go to the doctor it is your five
[45:58] senses lying to you because you are not
[46:00] sick and don't accept it because you are
[46:03] not sick that's only the operation of
[46:06] the five senses that will make you
[46:09] believe that you are sick meanwhile you
[46:12] are not that's how the sixth sense work
[46:15] it it works isn't it was with is an
[46:17] evidence of things that you can see with
[46:20] the five senses by the way let me be
[46:22] clear when he says is evident when Paul
[46:24] says the evidence of things not seen it
[46:26] it means not seen by this eyes but with
[46:30] your spiritual eyes you see those things
[46:32] am I am i alive so now the sixth sense
[46:36] cannot lie to you but they the ice I can
[46:40] just look at what the James leg did and
[46:42] then my eyes and my and my mind says ah
[46:45] that doesn't like you and I can't even
[46:52] say I mean I know and I don't know then
[46:56] I say a father is not here is not in his
[46:59] busy thinking that the five senses can
[47:02] tell you things that are not they can
[47:04] lie to you that is why you cannot depend
[47:07] on the five senses that is why you
[47:09] cannot listen to them for you to get a
[47:13] true fact the effect of the five senses
[47:16] is not really affect because someone can
[47:20] prove it wrong that is why I'm saying
[47:23] your five senses can lie to you
[47:24] amen that is why because I'm looking I'm
[47:28] talking to you now it is important for
[47:31] you to go home to read the spoken ways
[47:32] but I'm referring today so that may be
[47:35] my one of my five senses have made a
[47:37] mistake as write to you not kept asleep
[47:40] but you can go and verify and say ah my
[47:43] brother senses they just almost made a
[47:45] mistake and you read and you refer to
[47:47] the spoken word and you get the real
[47:49] genuine thing am i right that is that is
[47:51] that the five senses have got strong
[47:53] limitations and that is why we can
[47:56] not depend on them always my advice to
[47:59] you if you can write it down
[48:01] always question the decision of your
[48:04] five senses always question the judgment
[48:07] of the five sense all the time and
[48:10] school they teach us that we must
[48:11] critically analyze we must analyze
[48:13] critically you know what they mean is
[48:15] that you must put an idea or a thought
[48:18] even if it's your thought they teach us
[48:21] this
[48:22] and they say you must critically
[48:23] evaluate it what do you mean is that you
[48:25] must go and test and it criticize your
[48:28] own work and thoughts why because you
[48:30] can't trust them that's what they mean
[48:34] actually you cannot trust another
[48:36] researcher go and make a research and an
[48:39] with based on the facts of that time ten
[48:43] years later another research come and
[48:45] prove that a defect wrong what happened
[48:47] because you cannot depend any life on
[48:50] the five senses today they say this
[48:53] tomorrow they say that today they say
[48:56] you are sick tomorrow they say you are
[48:57] not see today is the headache tomorrow
[48:59] is their eyes what exactly am i sick on
[49:03] here five senses huh because they can
[49:06] lie to you because the devil can wet
[49:10] through them it's a prayer meeting
[49:12] tonight I can take long
[49:13] let's move on and get to the next slide
[49:18] and then this is the the core of what I
[49:22] want I want to talk about the papers and
[49:25] an application of this sixth sense as
[49:28] everybody understands me now hebrews
[49:31] chapter 11 out out let's read it again
[49:33] but verse six only but without faith it
[49:37] is impossible to please him for he that
[49:42] cometh to God must believe that he is
[49:46] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[49:49] diligently seek him out like us just to
[49:52] pause a second on that note brother Phil
[49:55] just listen to that to that verse how
[49:58] low that it is to say that it is
[50:00] impossible to please him but then how do
[50:07] I get this thing called faith if
[50:10] I must have it too please God how do I
[50:12] get it that is another same one brother
[50:15] for brother nd for he that cometh to God
[50:17] must believe that he is a rewarder when
[50:21] you have when you come to God and you
[50:25] believe use faith to believe am i right
[50:27] and you believe that God he rewards you
[50:31] he gives you the faith then from there
[50:35] he rewards you but you need to dhimmi
[50:39] gently and I highlighted those words on
[50:41] purpose because there are key ways I
[50:44] used to have a teacher when he comes to
[50:46] a point he says key learning point that
[50:49] means you must write that one he's going
[50:51] to ask you in the exam key learning
[50:53] points here ah that one it is impossible
[50:57] to please God without faith secondly you
[51:01] order he rewards you but he doesn't just
[51:05] reward you he won't you if you
[51:07] diligently seek Him hallelujah now
[51:12] doesn't doesn't take no I wrote there
[51:15] that faith doesn't take no for an answer
[51:17] no no no no no in the vocabulary of
[51:20] faith you don't find the word no or is
[51:22] not possible or any negative thought you
[51:25] don't find it in the English in the
[51:27] vocabulary of faith you can't find that
[51:29] but not in an arrogant way no no no no
[51:32] no in a more hopeful way in a more
[51:35] purposeful positive way you don't find
[51:39] negativity in faith you only find yes
[51:42] because why it is impossible for God to
[51:45] lie because it's impossible for God to
[51:48] fail that is why when you want one God
[51:51] thought about creating me and you it was
[51:54] already a reality I was talking to
[51:56] someone I said the source of God are
[51:58] real
[51:59] there they are sup their substantive
[52:01] they are not like my thoughts and your
[52:03] thoughts when God thinks that thing that
[52:06] he's thinking he's excited so that is
[52:12] why when he said let there be light yo
[52:14] he goes he's thought about it face isn't
[52:16] it because you cannot have faith before
[52:19] you hear something or before you think
[52:21] of some
[52:22] or before you process something in your
[52:24] mind no no you you have faith because
[52:26] something has happened first then you
[52:29] want to believe then you believe or you
[52:31] doubt right
[52:33] so exactly with God before you could
[52:35] create he thought he said and he thought
[52:37] this was busy thinking everything that
[52:40] you see here today and the thing that
[52:43] has passed and the thing where are still
[52:44] coming in this thing called time went
[52:47] through in his mind can you believe it
[52:50] including the number of your hair how
[52:54] many you are going to lose a day how
[52:58] much you're going to get annually huh
[53:02] even today is sister wow he he knows how
[53:05] much hair have you lost even knows how
[53:08] much hair have grown from your head and
[53:10] that was in the mind of God when he
[53:13] created me and you isn't that lovely
[53:16] that is powerful but now when you want
[53:18] him of this word faith there's powerful
[53:21] ways that come as the Bible says you
[53:23] think of diligently persistent
[53:27] insistently fervently relentlessly when
[53:32] one day says you do something
[53:33] relentlessly if you watch a wild life or
[53:36] you know some of the wild animals
[53:38] there's an animal called a honey badger
[53:45] who knows the Anabella that animal is a
[53:50] relentless hunter it does not take no
[53:53] for an answer
[53:54] I'm not saying we are like that anymore
[53:56] I'm just comparing you know the Bible
[53:59] also says that we must be wise like say
[54:01] pansy
[54:01] you know that but refrain from sin like
[54:05] drafts
[54:05] all right the Bible can give such
[54:07] example some I'm following the footsteps
[54:08] of the Bible but how many bells is so
[54:11] relentless you know it can find a black
[54:13] mamba it goes for the black mamba and
[54:20] the honey goes for the black mamba along
[54:24] three meters or 4 meters long of him
[54:26] black mamba the honey badger goes for it
[54:29] ha it's built like that nothing it goes
[54:35] for the black mamba and it catches the
[54:38] black the black mamba will hit it he
[54:41] tries it right out and the black mamba
[54:46] think remember the black mamba once he
[54:48] buys you in two times three times he's
[54:50] powerless now it was only wait wait
[54:53] there and wait until it gain strength so
[54:56] the honey badger will die half half did
[55:01] it rodella
[55:02] it loose it like they didn't then maybe
[55:05] it stands up again it goes for the black
[55:08] mamba it's going to sniff and save it
[55:11] and finds it and takes it an easy from
[55:14] tail to head to tail and a finish it as
[55:19] soon as it finished a black mamba it
[55:21] goes for therefore the green one if you
[55:27] hunt the rodents how many know rodents
[55:30] it will hunt the rodents it will and it
[55:33] will go inside you know here in New
[55:35] Zealand you record what you call it the
[55:38] this what is this wonderful honey
[55:41] brother feels the manuka it goes for the
[55:47] manuka peace honey betcha doesn't matter
[55:51] how hard the steam of the manuka bees it
[55:54] goes for that one for those ones I saw
[55:56] them there B is those big ones isn't it
[55:58] it goes for those ones there it goes
[56:02] inside that behind
[56:05] and it is that honey as if the bees are
[56:09] not biting it stops at nothing
[56:12] don't tell her honey badger that you'll
[56:14] die no no no no no it won't listen to
[56:17] you
[56:17] it was the honey and that's what me and
[56:20] you are supposed to be if the devil says
[56:23] you're not here you don't listen to that
[56:25] if the devil says you don't have the
[56:28] Holy Ghost you don't wait you don't
[56:30] listen you tell you I have the hill
[56:33] ghosts you tell the better that I am
[56:36] healed even if today the devil has
[56:38] tipped you Caleb for example you go my
[56:42] brother you go and tell him that pain
[56:45] you know a honey badger you are rememb
[56:48] am the honey badger and I'm going to do
[56:51] destroy you today you and your present
[56:54] and your lineage I'm going to kill you
[56:57] today
[56:57] I hope it's listening the devil amen
[57:01] so you think of those words you know
[57:04] when you think of an enemy like a honey
[57:06] badger a diligent instant insistent you
[57:10] insist
[57:11] you know you persists you know you know
[57:14] you know that parable that the Lord told
[57:18] his disciple I can't remember the
[57:20] chapter and talks about that man who has
[57:22] nothing but the king and he was no Qi
[57:26] and until the King said no no you know
[57:30] what this guy he's annoying me now is
[57:33] getting to my name's give him what he
[57:37] wants that man he was he was persistent
[57:44] he saw nothing else except what he was
[57:48] asking for and he was not fighting
[57:51] he was just persistent I don't want to
[57:53] say pushy because you know pushy has got
[57:55] some attitude so so hope hopefully
[58:00] against hope that's that's how faith or
[58:03] the sixth sense works it works in a very
[58:05] strange way it doesn't work like our
[58:07] senses our senses go to a point I say
[58:10] hold on I'm tired 6:10 says no you're
[58:12] not tired
[58:14] citizens once you being tired according
[58:17] to the scientific definition that you
[58:19] are exhausted from work but ahead but
[58:23] the sixth sense is no no you are not
[58:25] well se of some primitive the plummeting
[58:30] you forget that you are tired and what
[58:35] happened to me no you are listening to
[58:38] the wrong guy saying that you are tired
[58:42] face come the anointing of the Holy
[58:44] Spirit come and annoys you and you
[58:46] forget that you have had only one you
[58:49] finished that man become is ouya you're
[58:51] tired now he's okay fine I'm gonna I'm
[58:55] gonna sleep but before the prayer when
[58:56] the main team was high when you are
[58:58] under the anointing I tell you if you
[59:00] ever went through the unrelenting you
[59:02] can testify to this but you won't even
[59:04] hear or feel or think about what you
[59:07] were feeling before you came for prayer
[59:09] that's how the sixth sense wake is the
[59:11] powerful strange sense amen let's move
[59:16] to the next slide and we're going to
[59:17] finish shortly I want to read for you
[59:23] from again that faith is the sixth sense
[59:27] if you don't use your six senses they
[59:30] become they become they become dormant
[59:35] remember I touched about this earlier on
[59:37] when the Prophet spoke about the
[59:40] eyesight if you fought them and you you
[59:43] you you you you tamper with one of your
[59:46] senses right you will affect that sense
[59:49] eventually until that is no more
[59:52] functioning the way God gave you if not
[59:54] completely lost that man who used to
[59:57] brother branham spoke about in India if
[1:00:00] I'm not mistaken who was a Sun
[1:00:01] worshipper and he got blind because of
[1:00:04] watching the Sun all the time what these
[1:00:06] were not men twice the Sun it'll hurt
[1:00:09] you so he was watching the wrong thing
[1:00:10] not using the eyesight the way that is
[1:00:13] suppose then he got blind the more you
[1:00:16] take your eyes and use them into the
[1:00:18] worldly things or the things that are
[1:00:20] not supposed to help you spiritually
[1:00:22] your blood
[1:00:23] yourself you are using your eyes in such
[1:00:26] a way that is not going to benefit your
[1:00:28] sixth sense you take your mouth you tell
[1:00:32] us your feelings
[1:00:33] you take your even eating you eat wrong
[1:00:36] things if it tastes is included in here
[1:00:41] I'm not talking for those who are doing
[1:00:43] diet I mean we don't drink certain
[1:00:45] things isn't it that's why we are Nasr
[1:00:48] eyes we don't drink we don't we don't we
[1:00:51] don't share those kind of food that were
[1:00:53] meant for for the gods
[1:00:55] now if you come to my country you'll
[1:00:57] hear even here there's a lot of cultural
[1:00:59] things that we don't do and you know
[1:01:01] prophet James spoke last week about
[1:01:02] things that that we do an away and we
[1:01:05] let our children you know they do games
[1:01:07] and then those things are put an impact
[1:01:09] and yet we are using our five senses to
[1:01:13] do them these guys they'll lie to you
[1:01:16] these guys I will show you now how God
[1:01:21] has given us to use them and afford
[1:01:23] papers I'm gonna show you now I mean
[1:01:25] let's move on quickly do not use them in
[1:01:29] your wrong way do not I mean if you do
[1:01:32] not use your sixth sense it becomes
[1:01:34] dormant and that's the point I almost
[1:01:35] lost the sixth sense which is faith like
[1:01:39] any other sense it needs to be utilized
[1:01:42] you know that faith without works is
[1:01:45] dead why did God give us faith as
[1:01:48] believers so that we can use it in the
[1:01:51] spoken retro firm faith is the substance
[1:01:53] if I'm not mistaken the Prophet says and
[1:01:56] I don't mean you but the profile says
[1:01:58] sometimes we say we've got faith and we
[1:02:00] don't have it but we think we have it
[1:02:03] the five senses tell us that we have it
[1:02:06] but we don't H make sure that we have
[1:02:09] the faith and we say yeah I've got the
[1:02:12] faith but if you have the faith it must
[1:02:16] demonstrate itself the faith must be
[1:02:19] able to say I am sick guilt done I am
[1:02:23] I'm looking for a job done give it I'm
[1:02:27] looking for this done
[1:02:28] that's how this extends with it stops at
[1:02:31] nothing if you are looking for something
[1:02:33] before the Lord and you are a daughter
[1:02:35] and a son
[1:02:36] god don't stop at nothing until you get
[1:02:40] that because because you are a daughter
[1:02:44] and a son of God you receive this word
[1:02:46] of God
[1:02:47] you send in God with a clear heart use
[1:02:50] you do everything and then you've got
[1:02:53] your right before God to say father
[1:02:55] though I am nothing but you you give God
[1:03:00] reasons and you promise you you take God
[1:03:02] the Prophet says to take take gaunt and
[1:03:05] and and and and how does he say what did
[1:03:07] he say he says then I forgot how you put
[1:03:13] your paraphrasing you know like like
[1:03:15] taking God on on his weight you know
[1:03:18] taking him on on what you say because he
[1:03:20] said in his way whatever that you shall
[1:03:23] ask in my name I will give you to you
[1:03:26] and the Bible says that if you are a son
[1:03:30] and a daughter of God filled with the
[1:03:31] Holy Spirit what is it that is going to
[1:03:35] prevent you from getting what you want
[1:03:37] what is it can hunger do that can can
[1:03:41] torture can can can heat can can flap
[1:03:45] can can can what can prevent you from
[1:03:48] that so you can see that when the
[1:03:51] Prophet talks about this kind of things
[1:03:53] that somewhere somewhere when we assess
[1:03:55] ourselves we realize that we are under
[1:03:57] shorting ourselves we are
[1:03:59] short-circuiting ourselves I don't have
[1:04:00] a better word but we are under privilege
[1:04:03] in ourselves by not utilizing our feet
[1:04:06] our sixth sense sufficiently right so we
[1:04:10] need to use it and sometimes he says to
[1:04:14] profit in that
[1:04:15] in what spoken weight I think is also
[1:04:17] phrases and substance he says that
[1:04:20] you'll be surprised that an unbeliever
[1:04:22] comes here to the altar and he gets
[1:04:24] prayed and he's healed and a seasoned
[1:04:28] Christian comes and does not get healed
[1:04:30] why because me and you think that we
[1:04:34] have arrived we are still in a battle we
[1:04:37] have not arrived our our sixth sense
[1:04:39] must work for us even more than an
[1:04:41] unbeliever and unbelievers the
[1:04:43] prostitute you tell her that you are a
[1:04:46] prostitute and you must repent and come
[1:04:48] here to the altar she says yes
[1:04:49] I'm a prostitute she comes here she gets
[1:04:52] healed she just delivered millennia the
[1:04:55] Bible tells us that means that teaches
[1:04:57] us from here that you must leave this
[1:04:59] business we reason with it because we
[1:05:01] think we are Christians we think we are
[1:05:03] have arrived can you see can you see
[1:05:06] where we understood and not the devil he
[1:05:09] knows that hey this one's if I leave
[1:05:11] them they'll catch and use that faith
[1:05:13] and if this one's use it I'm dead so
[1:05:17] let's be careful of that point and not
[1:05:19] allow our sixth sense to be dormant
[1:05:22] I want to jump and read on the yellow
[1:05:23] pad raises so you see it is lack of
[1:05:26] faith but that's been preached into the
[1:05:29] people lack of faith this thing called
[1:05:33] lack of faith is the one that is being
[1:05:35] preached lack of faith is being preached
[1:05:39] into the people but that makes them let
[1:05:43] thus that sixth sense which is faith lay
[1:05:45] dormant I don't know if anyone gets it
[1:05:49] lack of faith is being taught ah
[1:05:53] teaching is been happening but that
[1:05:55] teaching is lack of faith and it leaves
[1:05:58] the people to lay their sixth sense to
[1:06:02] be determined the constant it must teach
[1:06:05] us that we must activate any utilize
[1:06:07] daily on a daily basis our faith so that
[1:06:11] you must not determined what was it away
[1:06:14] my sorry I'm jumping ahead of you
[1:06:16] what was it holding on that success
[1:06:19] that's something that makes it real yes
[1:06:21] a through through this sixth sense
[1:06:24] he's in subdued kingdoms amen the sixth
[1:06:27] sense
[1:06:27] subdued kingdoms through the sixth sense
[1:06:30] the walls of Jericho fell flat on the
[1:06:32] ground
[1:06:32] Amen you believe that the walls of
[1:06:34] Jericho hit the ground through the sixth
[1:06:36] sense
[1:06:37] that was faith that was utilized in the
[1:06:39] sixth sense there is no way that I can
[1:06:41] go around those pulpits under the five
[1:06:45] senses then eventually it falls there's
[1:06:47] no way
[1:06:48] but faith can do it because faith it was
[1:06:52] beyond that the Six Senses Amen may God
[1:06:55] help us let's go to the last but one if
[1:06:59] I'm not mistaken the super sense again
[1:07:02] now the sixth sense come for this reason
[1:07:05] that's the reason why the sixth sense
[1:07:06] come that was to make the five senses in
[1:07:10] you deny anything that contrary to God's
[1:07:13] weight there you go the answer now why
[1:07:17] is the sixth sense given the five senses
[1:07:21] are supposed to be under control they
[1:07:24] are supposed to be Allah you know what
[1:07:26] we call that thing for the Isaac that
[1:07:28] will pull the horse there are those
[1:07:30] trains the five senses are supposed to
[1:07:34] be under and under control by the sixth
[1:07:38] sense otherwise you can't control these
[1:07:41] guys look they need another super sense
[1:07:44] to control them amen so deny anything
[1:07:47] that's contrary to God that's what the
[1:07:49] sixth sense is for the sixth sense is
[1:07:51] for that to control those guys Scripture
[1:07:54] speaks of casting down reasoning
[1:07:56] reasoning some of those senses remember
[1:07:59] remember in the five senses and they
[1:08:02] work together and then so you can
[1:08:05] imagine things you can dream things you
[1:08:08] can you can you can you can another way
[1:08:12] you can have things in your questions I
[1:08:14] know right
[1:08:16] because the devil can operate within
[1:08:18] those senses and then but now the sixth
[1:08:21] sense is meant and called
[1:08:23] to control them I mean the wonderful
[1:08:27] thing is these processing sisters this
[1:08:29] is powerful but there was given to the
[1:08:32] success and that success belongs only to
[1:08:35] the Christian so I'm talking to the
[1:08:38] right people tonight the sixth sense is
[1:08:41] only meant for you and for me that's
[1:08:45] what the sixth sense is meant for and it
[1:08:47] is meant for us not for someone else and
[1:08:50] he's given to us by God just like the
[1:08:53] five senses and it is one that governs
[1:08:56] and guides you not the five senses it is
[1:08:59] the one it is superior to all other
[1:09:01] senses it is a superior to all senses
[1:09:04] the other five senses that's the sixth
[1:09:07] sense and is given to only Christians
[1:09:10] don't you think this is the wonderful
[1:09:12] privilege in conclusion
[1:09:15] I want to read also this whole piece him
[1:09:18] that and the super sense is the Holy
[1:09:25] Spirit and the faith of God that dwells
[1:09:27] in you how many believe that and if you
[1:09:31] will let the five senses be yielded to
[1:09:33] the sixth sense it will guide you and
[1:09:35] bring all the other five senses under
[1:09:38] control of that super sense for it is
[1:09:42] far as far above natural sense as a
[1:09:45] spiritual man is above the natural I
[1:09:48] mean in doing so the super cells raise
[1:09:51] him up into the sport to where he has
[1:09:55] faith to believe things that could not
[1:09:57] but he could not hear sorry I'm reading
[1:09:59] any other scene right in doing so the
[1:10:03] super cells raises him up into the spot
[1:10:05] where he has faith to believe things
[1:10:07] that could not he could not you believe
[1:10:11] things that you not sorry you believe
[1:10:13] things that your other cells can do
[1:10:16] things that you could not see things
[1:10:21] understandings that you could not
[1:10:23] understand that's powerful understand
[1:10:26] you know what is this thing called
[1:10:27] understanding it's not even it goes to
[1:10:30] the other senses of the Spirit because
[1:10:31] that's where we risen right six face six
[1:10:37] sense takes all the reasonings that is
[1:10:40] not for God it that reasoning in actual
[1:10:43] fact is a problem reasoning it goes
[1:10:46] directly against faith because when
[1:10:49] faith says I'm healed listening says but
[1:10:51] can't you see this would can't you see
[1:10:53] the doctor's report so we must refuse it
[1:10:56] even if we can't see the solution we
[1:10:59] must refuse it and we must deny it never
[1:11:02] agree with the devil even if he appears
[1:11:04] to be correct
[1:11:05] I mean not a mistake for mother Eve the
[1:11:09] devil appeared by a correct and
[1:11:11] meaningful and she agreed and that was
[1:11:15] not I was saying I turned to my family
[1:11:18] that you know sometimes we say we read
[1:11:21] the scripture that says it will deceive
[1:11:26] the very elect if it was possible
[1:11:28] ah that's what's going to happen in the
[1:11:30] end time it's going to deceive the very
[1:11:32] elect if it was possible and we say well
[1:11:34] maybe the way is going to be is going to
[1:11:36] be the deception of a 99.5 percent ah
[1:11:41] truth brother indeed you find that ever
[1:11:44] comes 99.9 he comes and went to deceive
[1:11:48] you chuckles that the five senses can
[1:11:53] see a natural effect my brothers and
[1:11:56] sisters he is going to try to deceive us
[1:12:01] 99.99999 zero one percent that's how
[1:12:05] close well you may not even be able to
[1:12:09] see back to almost separate you need a
[1:12:11] super sense to be able to see that hey
[1:12:14] this is deception so it's going to be a
[1:12:17] sword close as we come closer to the end
[1:12:19] as we come to the end of the end it's
[1:12:22] going to be so close but we definitely
[1:12:25] need the super sense to be able in the
[1:12:28] sense that is above our senses for us to
[1:12:32] be able to detect the deception of the
[1:12:35] devil in the age that we are living in
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:38] so that's all that I had for you tonight
[1:12:41] and then I just want to say may God help
[1:12:43] each and every one of us and take these
[1:12:45] little ways that I have prepared and
[1:12:47] just transform them and just bring them
[1:12:50] to a point where you can be able to see
[1:12:53] what God wants to say not much about the
[1:12:56] vessel because you know God can use SS
[1:12:59] teak what can use a rock to push his
[1:13:03] weight he can so don't it means that
[1:13:06] comes you don't even look at random pop
[1:13:08] or about James but at the bend brother
[1:13:10] and brother Jay don't look at them look
[1:13:13] at what God is doing for you that is why
[1:13:17] it's important for you and for me to
[1:13:19] pray when we come to church to bear the
[1:13:22] minister because it's not about the
[1:13:24] minister it's about me and God God is
[1:13:29] going to talk to me and I must tell God
[1:13:32] what I want today what I need I'm I
[1:13:35] still got my problems
[1:13:36] I must tell God how I want to help that
[1:13:39] sister that brother I'm
[1:13:41] tell God everything that I need how I
[1:13:44] want to hate him to help the minister so
[1:13:46] that the means I can talk to me now
[1:13:49] once you do that and you come here you
[1:13:52] wear what you call back home we call it
[1:13:55] war clap you know war clap what is ice
[1:14:00] trap I don't know what is it brother it
[1:14:03] but the war club when we put a horse or
[1:14:06] donkeys on their cut we put we put we
[1:14:11] put certain things lettuce we don't have
[1:14:13] a donkey to look left or right no no no
[1:14:15] no we don't want the horse to look there
[1:14:17] or here you know sometimes you can see
[1:14:19] with you know a nice dangerous you you
[1:14:23] can you can say you see so you don't
[1:14:28] want they don't you do that other horse
[1:14:30] when you do extreme so let's pray that
[1:14:33] when we come to church we take the soup
[1:14:36] assets and wear those things
[1:14:38] me and my Lord Jesus then you see the
[1:14:43] answer that you need will come then
[1:14:46] you'll see that atmosphere that comes
[1:14:48] through from inside outside it will even
[1:14:51] overflow to the person next to you when
[1:14:54] they love you they get the annulled huh
[1:14:57] let's turn on our feet and clap hands
[1:14:59] for the Lord amen
[1:15:02] may God bless you and may his name be
[1:15:07] praised I hope that I made sense and
[1:15:10] that God will continue to speak to you
[1:15:14] lasting a beautiful song that says I'm
[1:15:17] amazed that he loved me
[1:15:20] I'm amazed that he chose me musicians
[1:15:23] can come here I'm amazed
[1:15:33] ah keno
[1:15:53] whoa how you can
[1:16:02] through your blood iphone pardon
[1:16:11] and I washed away all my seeds I was
[1:16:24] misty I'm amazed
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:39] ah

[1:18:59] someone who's called a prayer request I
[1:19:01] don't know if we're the band if there's
[1:19:03] anyone who have sent anything you can
[1:19:05] speak it confess it before the Lord and
[1:19:10] it shall come to pass the supercells are
[1:19:14] foreign for a way of talking to people
[1:19:16] and you need me and you need to learn
[1:19:20] maybe that message that says faith must
[1:19:22] by experience then you learn to
[1:19:25] understand the top of the super-sense
[1:19:27] you learn to hear the supercells when
[1:19:29] you talk I mean maybe you further need
[1:19:33] tonight maybe you've got a desire maybe
[1:19:36] you have a burden maybe you want to pray
[1:19:39] for someone maybe for the challenge at

[1:19:45] maybe for a challenge in your spiritual
[1:19:48] walk
[1:19:51] the god of the super-sense is here
[1:19:53] tonight it's important for you to speak
[1:19:56] it because even though he knows about
[1:20:00] that problem but he wants you to confess
[1:20:03] it he wants you to say boo devil that's
[1:20:07] what he wants you to do
[1:20:08] we can't keep quiet when the devil talks
[1:20:11] so loud in your ear
[1:20:13] you cannot keep quiet maybe want to pray
[1:20:17] for someone I'll leave it for you to
[1:20:21] speak if you want to raise it before God
[1:20:24] and then each one of us is going to pray
[1:20:27] each one of us is going to talk to the
[1:20:30] Lord tonight and say father I laid
[1:20:35] before you I give it to you my father
[1:20:38] you the God of the super-sense
[1:20:41] the God who made the heavens and the

[1:21:08] the five senses are giving you some
[1:21:11] delaying tactics tonight you want God to
[1:21:14] remove that thing and now you know that
[1:21:20] you want go to remove it bring it to God
