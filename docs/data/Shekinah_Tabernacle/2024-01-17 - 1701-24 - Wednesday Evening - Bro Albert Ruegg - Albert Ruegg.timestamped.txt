[24:10] verses to encourage you
[24:13] tonight in I like I like to start um
[24:18] well said this way tonight we going to
[24:22] read a few scriptures and I trust that
[24:25] we um can receive
[24:29] you
[24:29] know when we look at scriptures or hear
[24:33] somebody
[24:36] else it it's different it's it's like uh
[24:40] if you invited for dinner somewhere you
[24:42] get a different type of food it's not
[24:45] wrong food or maybe different but let's
[24:49] enjoy it that's what I mean I like to
[24:52] read a few verses in Psalm
[24:56] 34: 4 to
[24:59] 10 I came across those verses the other
[25:02] day and it really blessed
[25:04] me in verse four it says I sought the
[25:09] Lord and he heard
[25:11] me and delivered me from all my fears
[25:16] Hallelujah they looked unto him and were
[25:19] lightened and their faces were not
[25:21] ashamed Glory this poor man cried and
[25:26] the Lord heard him hallah and saved him
[25:29] out of all his
[25:31] trouble the angel of the Lord encampeth
[25:35] round about them that fear Him and
[25:39] delivereth them oh my Lord oh taste and
[25:43] see that the Lord is good yes sir
[25:46] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[25:50] oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there
[25:54] is no want to them their fear Him the
[25:59] Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger
[26:02] but they that seek the Lord shall not
[26:06] want any good
[26:08] thing you know there's so much in this
[26:12] in these few
[26:13] verses and it's a matter of being able
[26:16] to receive it you sometimes you find
[26:19] people that read these things you know
[26:22] the L Young Lions do lack and and suffer
[26:26] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[26:28] not want any good thing and then they
[26:32] think wow I need this I haven't got that
[26:35] and you know it doesn't line up somehow
[26:39] but it has to line up yeah if we believe
[26:42] it it will line up and
[26:45] um I found often
[26:48] that that people don't see what they
[26:51] really have in Christ Jesus we we just
[26:54] don't see it you know we sang a song
[26:58] There light of the world came into
[27:01] darkness you know the Lord came to his
[27:04] own and his own received him not
[27:07] right you can say how how come why did
[27:11] they not receive him because they had a
[27:14] different picture a different idea of
[27:16] how he should be or the way he should
[27:19] come but he came exactly according to
[27:21] the word of God no other way but
[27:24] blindness was the path and it says
[27:29] blindness was there p and in the Romans
[27:32] says because of their blindness Grace
[27:35] came our
[27:37] way but again he will show Grace to
[27:41] Israel and blindness will be part of the
[27:44] Gentiles of most of them and we can see
[27:48] we live in the day where people are
[27:51] blind a lot are religious but they're
[27:54] still blinded to the
[27:56] truth plenty of religion plenty of ideas
[28:00] plenty of politics but blind and we need
[28:03] to have ears to
[28:05] hear and eyes to see that's really what
[28:09] I'm trying to
[28:12] highlight you know we all confess that
[28:15] we believe and we believe the message we
[28:18] believe what we've heard we believe the
[28:19] Bible's the truth but we need to
[28:22] actually see it and experience it
[28:24] otherwise we haven't seen it oh yes the
[28:27] Bible says all your car is cast upon me
[28:30] Jesus said if you still wor it you
[28:32] haven't seen it you haven't heard it it
[28:35] hasn't sunk in you see that's the point
[28:37] I'm trying to make yes sir everything is
[28:40] ours and if we don't see it to be ours
[28:44] it's because we haven't heard and we
[28:46] haven't seen we may have read it with
[28:49] our eyes and we heard the preach with
[28:52] our ears but it hasn't struck home and
[28:55] we wanted the word to strike home that
[28:58] it becomes a reality a manifestation in
[29:02] our own lives and I have heard a man
[29:06] just the other day I mean you can find
[29:09] hundreds of people preaching on YouTube
[29:11] but I just came across a man and he I
[29:15] thought he may say some good things
[29:17] but
[29:19] basically he is this man was full
[29:24] of understanding and theology
[29:29] and he believed in the power of the word
[29:33] and the Miracles in the apostles day but
[29:37] he can't see it today and everybody who
[29:40] believes in Divine Healing and miracles
[29:44] he
[29:45] ridiculed
[29:47] well what a religion what a dead
[29:50] religion wow I want
[29:53] reality these signs follow of them their
[29:56] belief amen I believe that the works I
[29:59] do you will do also even Greater Works
[30:02] that was not addressed just to the
[30:05] apostles that was addressed to the
[30:08] Believers amen yes but if we see
[30:13] it it happens if we don't see it it
[30:16] doesn't happen we don't have to say I
[30:19] want to see this now can I see it now it
[30:21] just you just step into the word and be
[30:25] led by the Holy Ghost and these things
[30:26] happen over automatically I was just
[30:29] reminded um it's always good to share
[30:31] some testimony but I was reminded years
[30:34] ago I went up to visit some people in
[30:37] the Alps over in
[30:39] Switzerland and I had
[30:42] to well I went for a walk with a farmer
[30:46] there up a mountain and just before we
[30:49] left his wife came out totally
[30:52] Disturbed the young daughter was very
[30:55] very sick
[30:58] almost you know hallucinating high
[31:00] fevers and terrible
[31:03] State and they both were in
[31:06] shock and didn't know what to
[31:09] do and I didn't know what to say really
[31:12] but I said
[31:14] uh do you believe in prayer I
[31:17] said and they said yes I said have you
[31:21] pray for her no can you please you know
[31:25] there they weren't actually
[31:27] feeling worthy to pray you see that's
[31:32] that's the sad part they did not see
[31:34] it's for them to step into it yeah you
[31:38] know we are only worthy because of
[31:39] Christ what he's done on Calvary nothing
[31:41] else nothing else no knowledge no no
[31:44] whatever we've done has any any Merit in
[31:48] that sense but he says can you so I went
[31:52] and laid my hand on the little girl she
[31:54] was fiery hot and I prayed and then I
[31:58] said to her I'm going for walk with you
[32:00] Daddy when we come back you're
[32:02] well and so it was she was absolutely
[32:06] perfectly
[32:08] healed now I I left that place uh had
[32:12] hours to drive home and then um there
[32:16] was an emergency phone call to my
[32:19] sister uh and I thought I'll ring
[32:21] tomorrow and I rang the next day but the
[32:24] other girl there two girls got the same
[32:27] sickness one was healed the other one
[32:30] got it and they ended up at the hospital
[32:34] and she had the
[32:36] menitis one good heal one
[32:39] wasn't and you know I didn't say I step
[32:43] into I believe the word no it's just
[32:46] what it says what do you do we're led by
[32:48] the Holy Ghost we just need to do what
[32:51] it says we can't say oh wait till
[32:54] brother Z so comes he's got a gift of
[32:56] healing over there the other one you
[32:58] know that little incident caused so much
[33:01] a stir up that mountain that next time I
[33:05] went up they organized a prayer meeting
[33:08] and I went to the prayer meeting and
[33:11] then uh people had Faith to believe and
[33:15] then when I left that place next day I
[33:18] was driving down a hill and I saw two
[33:21] farmers in the Pedic and I stopped and
[33:25] there was two that came to the prayer
[33:27] meeting and and I said goodbye I said
[33:30] how is it going oh fine you know like
[33:32] people say and then one said I look
[33:35] actually it's not so fine here I think
[33:38] his name was Peter he hasn't been well
[33:40] for three months or six months or how
[33:42] many months he's been sick all the
[33:45] time and I oh let's pray I prayed in a
[33:48] padic with them you know what what else
[33:51] can you offer as a Christian a prayer a
[33:54] slingshot of Prayer and uh I
[33:59] left and I was just saying we just step
[34:03] into the word we don't actually plan
[34:05] things and when I left uh a year later I
[34:10] went up there with my daughter with one
[34:14] of my daughters and on the way up I saw
[34:17] a man in a padic I didn't know who it
[34:19] was I stopped and he came walking up to
[34:22] me on on my daughter and he said you
[34:26] know this this is the same exact same
[34:29] spot you prayed for me last year and
[34:31] I've never been sick since isn't that
[34:34] wonderful that is for the
[34:39] Believers we need to believe it but we
[34:41] also need to see it and to hear it yes
[34:44] sir and you know in Jeremiah it says uh
[34:48] talks about people without understanding
[34:51] which have eyes and see not have ears
[34:54] and hear not and we live in a day where
[34:58] this is
[34:59] reoccurring we know the scriptures in
[35:02] Revelations 3:15 to18 I Know Thy Works
[35:05] thou that thou art neither cold nor hot
[35:08] I would thou W cold or hot so then
[35:12] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[35:15] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[35:17] mouth yeah because thou sayest I'm rich
[35:21] and increased with goods and have need
[35:23] of nothing and knowest not that they are
[35:25] riched and miserable and poor and blind
[35:28] naked you see I just make that point
[35:31] that is the day the age we live in and
[35:34] that spirit is in the world and and we
[35:39] can fall into a trap where we think yeah
[35:42] I know it I've I've heard the truth you
[35:44] know and I'm restored to the word and I
[35:47] I see it I know it you know I believe it
[35:50] but when it comes to it have we really
[35:53] seen it we should say Lord open my eyes
[35:56] is to this truth and suddenly you start
[35:59] to scream Hallelujah because you
[36:01] actually can see it then it's done you
[36:04] know the deal is done when you see it
[36:07] when you see the completed work of
[36:09] Calvary it's different we believe
[36:13] it and uh we we say I believe it I see
[36:17] it I've heard the gospel I believe it
[36:18] I've accepted it but when you really see
[36:21] it well
[36:23] everything's accomplished we know he
[36:25] said it's finished and you know it's
[36:28] finished and it's so important that we
[36:31] come to that place where we actually see
[36:34] and hear what it really says you know we
[36:37] not just with natural when it hits home
[36:40] inside it's done it's finished you you
[36:44] know whether it's healing or whether
[36:45] it's anything else you may still see the
[36:49] same circumstances but you know inside
[36:52] it's over it's done and
[36:55] um yeah with we live in this uh day and
[36:59] night where there is a lot of of of that
[37:02] going
[37:03] on in I I like to read to you just two
[37:07] two or three more scriptures before we
[37:09] close here
[37:11] um I have um one interesting one in
[37:16] second Peter chap 1: 5

[37:31] to your to Virtue knowledge and to

[37:43] Godliness brotherly

[37:58] knowledge the truth we know a to it

[38:06] virtue to Virtue knowledge and to
[38:09] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[38:12] patience and to patience godliness and
[38:15] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[38:18] brotherly kindness charity or
[38:21] love we have these
[38:24] things we have these things we have to
[38:27] be convinced that they're ours I tell
[38:29] you why he says for these if these
[38:33] things be in you and abound they make
[38:36] you that you shall neither be Barren nor
[38:39] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[38:41] Jesus Christ but he that leth these
[38:47] things godliness brotherly kindness
[38:51] patience he laest the
[38:54] things is blind
[38:58] that's what the Bible
[38:59] says it's not that it's not there but
[39:02] you can't actually see it if you see it
[39:05] you have this patience you have this
[39:08] longsuffering you have all these things
[39:10] of the spirit if you actually can see it
[39:13] you start to manifest it if you don't
[39:16] display those things you're still blind
[39:19] the Bible
[39:20] says you know open my eyes Lord we cry
[39:24] open my eyes open my ears I want to see
[39:27] more of Christ I want to hear more of
[39:29] him and I want it to be a reality in my
[39:33] life he that lacers these things is
[39:36] blind and cannot see a far off and has
[39:40] what forgotten that he was perched from
[39:44] his old sins how can you ever forget
[39:47] that you see we live in our last days
[39:50] and the spirits in the world just draw
[39:54] away from what the spirit of God really
[39:57] has for you or tries to draw you away
[40:01] and as is often say the devil doesn't
[40:04] mind you to know everything as long as
[40:06] you don't do anything with it he doesn't
[40:09] mind you to know he doesn't mind you to
[40:12] to learn things and know things
[40:14] like if there's no power with it like I
[40:17] said this man who's criticizing
[40:20] everybody who who's got uh gifts of the
[40:23] Spirit you know who doesn't believe in
[40:25] gifts of the Spirit he doesn't believe
[40:27] in in Divine Healing in this day and he
[40:30] doesn't believe in yeah in
[40:33] Miracles wow what a poor state to be in
[40:37] blind and miserable yeah but we believe
[40:40] it but not just with with words we we
[40:44] actually believe it
[40:46] until it it strikes home till we really
[40:49] know yeah it's true the Lord
[40:54] promised we read at the beginning get
[40:57] his angels
[40:59] incompass those who fear Him well we
[41:03] believe angels are around what did
[41:05] Angels do in in the days of the Apostles
[41:08] for
[41:11] instance they lose prison chains let
[41:15] them out of prison miracles happen what
[41:17] did the angel come to Paul before they
[41:21] were Shipwrecked and said look no
[41:23] problem this that and this will happen
[41:26] you know how encouraging how encouraging
[41:29] but these things are real I want to see
[41:33] it am I I said I once was in a meeting
[41:37] in in syney I think it was and the Holy
[41:40] Ghost is moving and one sister saw a
[41:42] hand coming down from
[41:46] heaven nobody else could see it but she
[41:49] screamed and shouted because she could
[41:51] see it and nobody else could see it but
[41:53] it was still a
[41:55] reality Lord let me
[41:57] see you know there was people you know
[42:00] brother Bram saw the angel of the Lord
[42:03] quite often Angel
[42:05] come but uh not everybody could see it
[42:09] he said do you see that light it's now
[42:11] over this lady you know and can't you
[42:14] see it you know he saw these
[42:17] things by not seeing it doesn't mean
[42:20] they're not
[42:21] there but we can truly pray Lord open my
[42:26] eyes and my ears for what I believe to
[42:29] be the truth that I actually can have a
[42:33] Quicken to me and see the reality of it
[42:36] and it's it's um it's an important thing
[42:39] that we
[42:40] um Embrace these things as I said in the
[42:44] last days there's so many things
[42:46] happening which distract you from
[42:50] believing uh you'll read the scriptures
[42:54] 2 Timothy 3 1-5 this know also that in
[42:57] the last days perilous times shall come
[43:00] for men shall be lovers of the their own
[43:03] selves Covetous boasts proud Blasphemous
[43:07] disobedient to parents unth thankful
[43:11] Unholy without natural affection truth
[43:14] Breakers false accusers incontinent
[43:17] fears despisers of those that are good
[43:21] traitors heavy high-m minded lovers of
[43:23] Pleasures more than lovers of God having
[43:26] a form of
[43:28] godliness knowing truth but denying the
[43:31] power thereof you see from such turn
[43:34] away and I read in in an amplified
[43:37] version it says it's it's actually very
[43:39] interesting it says for
[43:42] although they hold a
[43:44] form of uh of piety truly religion they
[43:49] deny and reject and are strangers to the
[43:54] power of it wow
[43:56] their conduct belies the
[44:00] genuiness of their
[44:03] profession for their conduct nullifies
[44:06] their claim of Faith avoid all such
[44:10] people turn away from them you see you
[44:14] meet people you try to reach out to
[44:16] people all they bring is disbelief and
[44:19] and and rubbishing things keep away from
[44:22] that keep away from those religious
[44:24] people who don't believe in the power of
[44:26] God like this man I said I watching
[44:29] YouTube I wouldn't watch him again it's
[44:31] actually nonsense you know great big
[44:34] Ministry and go and and learn study
[44:37] Theology and and no power no
[44:41] nothing keep away from thyself keep away
[44:45] from the unbelief stay with people who
[44:49] are on fire and love the Lord and and
[44:52] Believe In The Miracles and if we don't
[44:55] see them happening straight away we
[44:56] still believe
[44:57] them I heard once said I'd rather
[45:01] believe die believing in Divine Healing
[45:04] than denying it you know we hang on we
[45:07] hang on and
[45:11] um I just uh want to finish because it's
[45:14] prayer meeting
[45:17] but we read taste and see that the Lord
[45:21] is good so we need to taste it
[45:24] Hallelujah and
[45:26] if you draw a parallel to Natural
[45:30] Food I used to live in inago years ago
[45:34] and the state was a family they were
[45:37] farmers their menu I think it was three
[45:40] different meals it was either muton and
[45:45] potatoes roast
[45:47] potatoes or boiled
[45:51] mints or one thing was some kind of a
[45:54] cerol with rum steaks that wasn't bad
[45:58] but you see that's all they actually ate
[46:02] and the farmer man he wouldn't want to
[46:04] touch anything else wow he wouldn't want
[46:06] to touch anything else and then I said
[46:09] wow overseas we used to fry the m and
[46:12] this oh I wouldn't want to touch this oh
[46:15] and put it in an omelet oh that tastes I
[46:18] wouldn't try one you know and I said
[46:20] look I'll make you one and because I was
[46:24] from overseas they so of agreed to to
[46:27] taste it you know you would believe it
[46:29] but he asked me El can you can you make
[46:32] me another one of those omelets you know
[46:35] once he has tasted it but until then he
[46:39] missed out W and you know there's many
[46:42] words in here for us to Taste and to
[46:46] actually embrace
[46:48] and we know the scripture in um uh when
[46:52] the people were in a Promised Land the
[46:55] the the
[46:56] Israelis Israel was in the promised
[46:59] land and they were fighting for their
[47:02] land that was promised to
[47:05] them and yet when Joshua was about to
[47:08] die he said Is Yet much l to be
[47:12] taken it was still a lot to be taken you
[47:16] know they probably were satisfied with
[47:18] their little pics and their little house
[47:20] there and yeah we're fine but there's
[47:23] more land to be taken and God wants to
[47:25] be glor glorified by us taking that Land
[47:28] by us seeking out promises in this word
[47:33] and say I believe it Lord speak it loud
[47:36] in my ears open my eyes to it I want to
[47:39] experience this you know that there's
[47:42] Words which me may think oh means
[47:44] nothing now when I was young I used to
[47:48] um well I still do but I I used to read
[47:50] through the New Testament over and over
[47:52] and over and sometimes you come across
[47:55] scriptures you've read before you know
[47:57] it by heart and one of was said uh why
[48:01] do you behold the the spe in in your
[48:04] brother's eye and you're not aware of
[48:07] the log in your own
[48:08] eye and sort of no I have got problem
[48:12] with that I love
[48:15] everybody but then I thought how would I
[48:19] even know if I have a log in my eye so I
[48:23] prayed I said Lord if there's something
[48:25] my eye that prevents me to see please
[48:27] take it out take it out I want to be
[48:30] able to see and and you know we assume
[48:34] sometimes or we go to church and we feel
[48:36] very comfortable with what we hear we
[48:39] get a certain diet spiritual diet like
[48:44] the the farmer and the natural diet we
[48:46] get a spiritual diet we feel comfortable
[48:49] with it feeds us we feed on the same
[48:51] thing over and over I've been to
[48:54] churches where they say the same thing
[48:57] every every
[48:58] Sunday every
[49:00] Sunday and then sometimes people say
[49:04] yeah good good things but it's always
[49:06] the same thing the same theme the same
[49:09] kind of thrust on the
[49:12] word same old diet but there's far more
[49:16] in here far more and we miss out if we
[49:20] resign to that kind of thing I want to
[49:23] be you know he's look mercies are new
[49:27] Every Morning the Bible say so I want to
[49:29] wake up and experience the mercies of
[49:32] God are fresh every day I want to search
[49:35] out my promises you you know that that
[49:38] uh story this man I might tell it wrong
[49:43] but he he got an
[49:46] inheritance didn't know maybe some rich
[49:48] uncle died or left him a big inheritance
[49:51] well he he wanted to know what he's he's
[49:54] got a house and everything everything in
[49:55] it you know you go in a house and you
[49:57] want to open every drawer and know what
[50:00] is mine and that's our inheritance
[50:04] that's our promises we want to search it
[50:07] out and say that's mine I'll embrace it
[50:10] I take it I'll receive it so in closing
[50:13] I just say oh taste and see that the
[50:16] Lord is good don't get caught up with
[50:18] just uh a religion don't get caught up
[50:21] with just being satisfied with going
[50:24] there feel comfortable you know I've I
[50:28] have had people in in church you know
[50:29] they feel comfortable they have their
[50:32] seat you know there somebody else sits
[50:35] there you know that that disturbs the
[50:37] whole
[50:38] program well it's not the way we have it
[50:41] you know or you need to sing certain
[50:43] songs we we don't like those kinds or
[50:46] everything or our pastor only goes
[50:49] exactly 40 minutes or something and a
[50:52] minute later they look out to watch you
[50:54] know you get used used to something but
[50:57] we don't want to get used to we people
[51:00] got used to the manifestations and
[51:03] divine healings and and the spoken word
[51:05] they got used to it and they weren't
[51:08] excited and if people first time were in
[51:10] a meeting where the the word of
[51:13] knowledge was presented and and the
[51:15] spirit discerned people screamed and
[51:18] shouted and and then after a few years
[51:21] oh yeah it's this again and oh can you
[51:23] please be Reverend don't don't move
[51:26] don't move you're people casual you know
[51:28] now it's this again they were not aware
[51:31] of what was happening and I don't want
[51:34] to lose that that um what do you call it
[51:39] awareness that God is present that he
[51:42] knows all things sees all things knows
[51:44] what he go through knows what we need he
[51:48] knows everything and if we can just know
[51:52] oh all is at rest all is at peace so
[51:56] there
[51:57] is that there is um important that we
[52:02] keep our eyes on the word of God not to
[52:05] get caught up with man's failures and
[52:08] things uh comparisons of churches and
[52:14] beliefs it's look to True Christians
[52:17] look to Christ and be persuaded that he
[52:21] can do all things and that's all I
[52:23] wanted to encourage you tonight amen it
[52:26] is taste and see taste and see God bless
[52:32] you
[52:48] brother
[52:49] um God his word is unlimited amen we got
[52:53] to press in and take every PR promise
[52:55] amen till we see it till it becomes
[52:57] reality I mean I like that never won for
[53:00] I sat in too many lectures at University
[53:02] you know so I'm sick of theory I want to
[53:04] see reality amen praise the Lord let's

[53:18] there's um many promises may be real to
[53:21] other people but what about you what
[53:23] about me amen it's got to be personal
[53:25] amen so let's press in and seek the Lord
[53:27] you know it says in uh Hebrews chapter
[53:30] 11 if I could just read this really
[53:31] quickly before we um sing here it says
[53:38] um it says but without faith it's
[53:40] impossible to please him for he that
[53:42] cometh to God must believe that he is
[53:44] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[53:46] diligently seek him so if you seek Him
[53:49] seek his word to become reality he will
[53:51] reward you amen so let's stand tonight
