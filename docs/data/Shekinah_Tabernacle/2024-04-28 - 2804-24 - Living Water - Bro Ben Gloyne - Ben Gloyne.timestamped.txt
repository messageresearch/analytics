[3:15] praise the Lord
[3:18] hello welcome to church how are you all
[3:20] this morning good it's good it's good to
[3:23] see you where are all the people that
[3:24] were here it feels like I've got an
[3:25] empty spot here
[3:30] where's sister Robin she here no sister
[3:33] where are all your friends Sister Louise
[3:35] where are
[3:39] they you're a very likable person I
[3:42] don't know why this would
[3:43] [Music]
[3:47] happen I think Christians are likable
[3:50] people you know
[3:53] whether people admit it or not people
[3:55] enjoy positive people you you know and
[3:58] being in the presence of positive people
[3:59] that make them feel good and Christians
[4:01] have that way about them if they're a
[4:03] True Believer because you you genuinely
[4:05] love other people and you only want the
[4:08] best for them so that will be what you
[4:11] how you interact will be based on that
[4:13] so that'll make people feel good you
[4:14] know and it'll be positive so and people
[4:17] always like
[4:18] that and um amen I think we're for a
[4:21] good time this morning I was reading
[4:23] Ecclesiastes this morning
[4:26] and um
[4:28] [Music]
[4:30] chapter 9 just talks about you know he
[4:32] says whether you're a righteous person
[4:33] or unrighteous you you get dealt the
[4:35] same hand you just get dealt bad things
[4:38] now and then doesn't matter what sort of
[4:40] life you live you will just get dealt
[4:41] with a certain thing and and he's going
[4:44] um Solomon's going through all these
[4:46] things but
[4:48] then he said you know but at the end of
[4:50] the day you're
[4:51] alive so uh like a living dog is better
[4:55] than a dead lion he's like you're alive
[4:57] at the end of it all you're still alive
[4:59] and and then he said so just let your
[5:01] garments always be white and anoint your
[5:02] head with oil and whatsoever your hand
[5:04] finds to do do it with all your might
[5:06] you know you're alive just go for it so

[39:30] friends you can have your seats this
[39:32] morning so I want to talk about living
[39:34] water where Christine I was talking
[39:35] about it this week and I started looking
[39:37] into it and it's a wonderful thing all
[39:39] the way through the scripture so you
[39:40] know this this living water you know
[39:42] it's you it's um so I'm just trying to
[39:45] orientate myself here a little bit but
[39:46] you see this this living water that
[39:48] Jesus was talking about we know he's
[39:50] talking about the spirit of God that
[39:51] would come within man but we know man
[39:53] has always thirsted you know uh as as
[39:56] David would say in Psalms 42 he says to
[39:59] the chief musician uh mashkel for the um
[40:02] for the sons of Kora as the heart
[40:04] panteth after the water Brook so panteth
[40:07] my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirth
[40:10] for God for the Living God When shall I
[40:13] come and appear before God my tears have
[40:15] been my meat day and night while they
[40:17] continually say unto me where is thy God
[40:21] so David had a longing that really
[40:23] expresses the longing of every True
[40:25] Believer or actually every man woman and
[40:27] child called upon the Earth we are built
[40:28] to thirst whether you like it or not
[40:30] people people have a thirst in their
[40:32] lives and they'll try and satisfy it
[40:34] with fame or woman or money or
[40:37] popularity entertainment movies music
[40:39] whatever social media uh you know they
[40:42] will they will try and meet that thirst
[40:44] but I'm so thankful that this morning we
[40:46] have our satisfying portion of the of
[40:49] the true thirst quencher amen and it's
[40:51] not Powerade it's not Coke no sugar diet
[40:55] vanilla whatever whatever this is real
[40:57] this is a real drink right amen that can
[41:00] that can thirst that I mean that can
[41:02] meet The Thirst of your thirsting soul
[41:04] now I appreciate the fact we have this
[41:07] true lifegiving water this morning amen
[41:10] that that we don't drink from a a a
[41:13] man-made tank or a man-made well like
[41:16] you know like the woman at the well all
[41:17] she knew was a man-made well sure it was
[41:19] a Jacob a Believer who dug that well and
[41:21] he had a need to dig that well but it
[41:24] was a man-made well and Jesus was saying
[41:26] to her listen listen listen you don't
[41:28] this is not the well you really need
[41:30] amen you need a different kind of a
[41:32] resource you need a different kind of
[41:33] source of water and this water is going
[41:35] to satisfy your needs see she had a
[41:37] thirst for love she was looking for love
[41:39] in all the wrong places that's why she
[41:41] was married so many times and the last
[41:43] time she's just living with the God
[41:44] didn't even go through the motions of a
[41:46] wedding and you know but but she was
[41:48] thirsting but the but but but the source
[41:50] that she was trying to drink from did
[41:51] not meet that thirst amen but then when
[41:54] Jesus came her way and revealed himself
[41:56] to her amen she left that water pot she
[41:58] left that thing that thought that would
[42:00] meet her need amen and she ran to the
[42:02] city saying come see a man who's
[42:04] quenched my thirst come see a man who's
[42:07] met my longings amen come see a man
[42:09] who's met my desire amen and it changed
[42:12] her entire life because she be to be
[42:14] drinking from a different kind of a well
[42:16] aren't you glad we have that well today
[42:18] amen that well is Jesus Christ aren't
[42:20] you thankful that you know we don't
[42:22] drink from a man-made divis scheme as
[42:24] the Bible says we do not follow kindly
[42:27] devis fables of man amen this was not
[42:29] hatched up in Jeffersonville it wasn't
[42:31] hatched up in some Bible School amen but
[42:33] God birth his well he produced his word
[42:36] amen and we can drink from that well
[42:38] amen now I love this meaning of of of
[42:41] the word living I just put it all in
[42:43] there but I you it means to you because
[42:45] it's not dead water Jesus did not say
[42:48] I'm going to give you stagnated water or
[42:50] dead water or or Still Water there's no
[42:53] life in no it's living water I mean
[42:55] there's a life force in this water amen
[42:57] it's you know it's so it means to live
[42:59] to breathe to be among the living not
[43:01] lifeless not dead am mean to enjoy real
[43:04] life amen this what this living water
[43:05] does you can enjoy real life we don't
[43:07] live in a fantasy world we don't live in
[43:10] an alternative reality we live in the
[43:12] true reality amen we know who God is we
[43:14] know who the devil is we know what God's
[43:17] plan is we know what the devil's schemes
[43:18] are we're living in reality we don't
[43:20] have blinkers on of entertainment try
[43:22] and just whistle like brother Ram say
[43:24] you know you know this modern day it's
[43:26] like a it's like a kid going through a
[43:27] graveyard just whistling pretending
[43:30] they're not scared that's why there's
[43:31] all the comedies and different you know
[43:33] fantasy Realms and different things
[43:35] people living because it's like a boy
[43:36] going through a graveyard whistling at
[43:38] night pretending he's not scared so
[43:40] they're trying to trying to divert their
[43:42] attention to something else to try and
[43:44] satisfy that you to try and appease that
[43:46] fear they'll never do it they'll keep
[43:48] whistling through the graveyard but we
[43:49] don't need to whistle through a
[43:50] graveyard and and pretend we're not
[43:52] scared because the believer is not
[43:54] scared we don't need to be scared why
[43:56] cuz greater is he that's in you that's
[43:58] he that's within the world Amen so we
[44:00] don't have some so we can enjoy real
[44:02] life amen hallelujah hallelujah amen to
[44:06] have true life and be worthy of the name
[44:08] to be active blessed endless in the
[44:10] kingdom of God to live to P life in the
[44:12] manner of the living and acting it's of
[44:14] morals or character now I like this
[44:17] living water having vital power in
[44:19] itself and exerting the same power upon
[44:21] the soul am me that's why brother R says
[44:24] you can impart eternal life to someone
[44:26] me why the Living Water that's within
[44:28] you Christ himself Waters forth amen
[44:30] then that power doesn't just come on
[44:32] someone's body and they're healed though
[44:33] that's wonderful or upon their spirit
[44:35] and they're delivered but it comes into
[44:36] their soul and changes their nature from
[44:38] unbelief into Faith amen from Lost to
[44:41] found amen transforms them amen that's
[44:43] what the power that's within you this
[44:45] artisian well of the Holy Ghost that's
[44:47] within each and every one of us amen has
[44:49] the power within itself to exert it's a
[44:52] vital power in itself it exerts the same
[44:54] power upon the soul Hallelujah that's
[44:57] why we don't try this is not psychology
[44:59] we don't try and change people's
[45:00] thinking I mean because someone else
[45:02] will come along and change their
[45:03] thinking a different way this is not
[45:04] what Christianity is Christianity is a
[45:06] birth it's a life it's a transforming
[45:08] power I mean doesn't just change the
[45:10] thinging changes the heart the nature of
[45:12] man Hallelujah so we have this
[45:14] lifegiving water right now amen prise
[45:17] the Lord I'm thankful for that aren't
[45:19] you Hallelujah now we take water for
[45:21] granted in this well especially this
[45:23] part of the country we take water for
[45:25] granted right we get a lot of rain here
[45:27] if you go over the wire WP or you go up
[45:29] the East Coast you know it gets very dry
[45:31] they they they appreciate rain growing
[45:33] up in gizan we appreciated when the rain
[45:35] would come we had family who had farms
[45:37] and things and they had trouble with
[45:38] droughts and things but you know when
[45:40] you don't when you have water you can
[45:41] take it for granted when you don't have
[45:44] water you really appreciate it I
[45:46] remember being in pulani there we're in
[45:48] this hotel me and Brother Andy and you
[45:49] know all the AC units were on one
[45:51] circuit so as soon as Ian turned them on
[45:54] those died and the pumps died then you
[45:56] are really you know you thought you took
[45:57] for granted you turn a tap on this water
[45:59] when the pumps everything die you really
[46:01] value the water you have hallelujah amen
[46:05] now we don't have a power cut today in
[46:07] the Church of the Living God I mean we
[46:09] don't have a you know we you know it's
[46:11] like when Moses smoke the rock spoke to
[46:14] the rock you know it wasn't just a
[46:16] little trickle that came out of that
[46:17] rock no it was a gusher came out of that
[46:20] rock because it watered a million people
[46:22] and their cattle you know their
[46:23] livestock everything from One Source
[46:25] came out there abundance of water amen
[46:28] and this is what we have we have an
[46:29] abundance of water of the Holy Ghost
[46:31] this morning but we should never take it
[46:33] for granted amen we should appreciate
[46:35] every drop we should rejoice in every
[46:37] time it pours amen every time the Lord
[46:40] gives you a refreshing drink amen maybe
[46:42] you come come the morning thirsty troubl
[46:44] in your mind you know all kinds of
[46:46] things going but you just drink from him
[46:48] you get satisfied you get refreshed you
[46:51] get cooled down amen hallelujah what we
[46:53] should we should rejoice in every drop
[46:56] now praise the Lord hallelujah amen now
[47:00] there is power within this
[47:03] Fountain Hallelujah see in this life
[47:06] you've never seen I've never seen
[47:07] nothing so quenching as to be in the
[47:09] mountains and find as I preached on the
[47:11] other night that stream bubbling up it's
[47:13] lifegiving resource you'd be tired and
[47:15] thirsty fall down by the good stream way
[47:17] down where germs can't go way down
[47:19] hundreds of feet in the earth it's
[47:20] bubbling forth pure genuine lifegiving
[47:22] water we appreciate that now that's
[47:25] little how the Earth has so many streams
[47:27] with a refreshing water when you're
[47:29] thirsting and dying you get a good cold
[47:31] drink from that it'll help you to live
[47:33] but look where this one comes from from
[47:35] the Throne of God now he's talking about
[47:36] the Book of Revelation how under the
[47:38] throne there's those found there's a
[47:39] rivers of living water come from the
[47:41] Throne of God so we're not drinking from
[47:43] a natural stream I probably may sound
[47:45] redundant this morning but we're not
[47:46] drinking from a natural stream and when
[47:48] you open the word in faith and you read
[47:50] it you hear the message you hear a good
[47:51] anointed song you're not feeding from a
[47:54] natural source but you're feeding from a
[47:56] supernatural Source amen it's coming
[47:58] from the Throne of God God is pouring
[48:00] out virtue and strength and refreshment
[48:03] and and peace and joy amen out of this
[48:05] great Fountain Hallelujah into the lives
[48:08] of you and I now but we've got to
[48:10] realize that everyone actually has has a
[48:14] fountain it's not all the same water it
[48:18] can be good water it can be bad water
[48:20] just like James would say here behold we
[48:22] put bits in the hores mouths and they
[48:25] may obey us and we turn out their whole
[48:27] body behold also the ships um which
[48:30] though they be so great and are driven
[48:32] with with Fierce winds yet they are
[48:34] turned about with a very small Helm with
[48:36] a server the governor listeth now you
[48:39] need a router on a boat here's another
[48:41] sailing story you know there was a
[48:43] there's this you you push the Ruder in
[48:45] and there's this clip that holds it in
[48:47] now one time we didn't have that clip in
[48:49] so you put the Ruder in but then because
[48:50] of things boyant it actually lifted out
[48:52] of its sockets and started floating away
[48:55] you try and sail a boat without a rudder
[48:57] it's like
[48:59] democracy all sales are no rud can go
[49:02] everywhere right so you know it seems
[49:05] like such a small thing but it's such
[49:07] has has so much power over the direction
[49:10] of the boat no even so the tongue is a
[49:12] little
[49:13] member this thing's a you know this
[49:15] thing's a muscle the tongue is a muscle
[49:18] the more you exercise it the stronger it
[49:21] gets but it depends what you're
[49:23] exercising it
[49:25] to amen it both HTH great things how
[49:28] many great things have you heard in your
[49:29] life great Promises of politicians great
[49:32] generals great whatever great Kings they
[49:34] promise the world and they can can
[49:36] supply nothing you know it's amazing how
[49:38] you know you know there's going to be
[49:40] election Cycles in America and different
[49:42] things and you know those politicians
[49:43] will stand up they'll give great rallies
[49:46] thousands of people will come and listen
[49:47] to them and those people really realize
[49:50] eventually you see enough elections you
[49:52] realize those guys are lying to you
[49:54] they're giving you all the promises
[49:55] Under the Sun they can't deliver none of
[49:57] them but yet people lap it up they drink
[50:00] it up they say you they get all rallied
[50:02] and excited and all these things see it
[50:05] is a little member but it boasteth great
[50:08] things now behold how great a matter
[50:11] this little fire kindleth and the tongue
[50:13] is a fire a world of iniquity so is the
[50:16] tongue among our members that it
[50:17] defileth the whole body and Seth on fire
[50:20] the course of Nature and it is set and
[50:22] it is set on fire of hell for every kind
[50:25] of Beast and of birds and of serpents
[50:27] and of things in the sea is tamed and
[50:29] both and hath been tamed of mankind
[50:32] that's quite a statement I thought
[50:33] there's a lot of animals out there in
[50:34] different things they've all been tamed
[50:36] but this thing has not been tamed that's
[50:38] why you need a greater one to come in
[50:39] and tame this tongue amen but the tongue
[50:42] can no man tame it's an unruly evil full
[50:45] of deadly poison wherewith bless we God
[50:48] even the father and wherewith curse We
[50:50] Men which are made after the multitude
[50:52] of God out of the same mouth proceedeth
[50:55] blessings and cursings my brethren
[50:57] these things ought not so to be amen do
[51:00] the fountain send forth of the same
[51:02] place Sweet Water and bitter the answer
[51:05] is no I mean can the Fig Tree my
[51:07] brethren be Olive berries um either a
[51:10] Vine figs so can no Fountain both yields
[51:13] salt water and fresh so we all have a
[51:16] fountain in US amen we're born with a
[51:18] salty Fountain this is not the Bible
[51:20] salty of be salty this is not what I'm
[51:22] talking about here this is a poisonous
[51:24] Fountain am mean this is this is a this
[51:26] is a polluted Fountain amen that speaks
[51:28] forth amen speaks forth G and and gossip
[51:31] and hypocrisy and trouble and strife and
[51:34] envy and all these things it speaks
[51:36] these things and it doesn't it doesn't
[51:38] give
[51:40] satisfaction it doesn't give help you
[51:42] know there used to be back in the day
[51:43] there'd be all these gossip mags people
[51:45] just lap up and it was a friend of a
[51:47] friend of someone heard something about
[51:49] this person it's a big front page thing
[51:51] on these things people would lap it up
[51:53] you know they know this thing's not true
[51:55] they know the next Edition is it's going
[51:56] to be 180° a different way but people
[51:59] are feeding on this nonsense you know
[52:01] but what is it it's a fountain of
[52:03] polluted water
[52:05] speaking now how much more is that
[52:07] around the world than everything now the
[52:09] problem with a water that is salty is
[52:12] that eventually if you drink salt water
[52:15] you'll go
[52:16] insane now there's a saying when it
[52:18] comes to the ocean water water
[52:19] everywhere not a drop to drink it looks
[52:22] fine it could be the right temperature
[52:25] no floaties
[52:27] don't have to filter nothing you know
[52:29] it's it's pure there's no no no man-made
[52:32] contaminants nothing in there but if you
[52:34] drink that that's being the ocean you'll
[52:36] go mad cuz it say says salt water has
[52:39] has a a lot of salt in it so in spite of
[52:42] the fact you're drinking water the net
[52:44] effect is you actually you actually
[52:46] dehydrate you one of the signs of
[52:49] extreme dehydration is delirium and loss
[52:51] of cognitive function as the brain
[52:54] dehydrates it just cannot function so
[52:58] the more people drink salt water the
[52:59] crazier they get the brain they get
[53:01] Delirious they begin to see things that
[53:03] aren't really there they begin to be
[53:05] troubled they can't act normal they
[53:07] can't act sober they can't act normal
[53:09] they can't cognitive function they can't
[53:10] do the things they used to do why
[53:12] because they're drinking from the wrong
[53:13] Fountain amen and this world has been
[53:16] drinking from a wrong
[53:19] Fountain where people are being so
[53:21] caught up in things that aren't real
[53:22] aren't true sure all the feelings and
[53:24] emotions are there like someone who's
[53:26] delious generally they they they they
[53:29] really believe what they're in they
[53:31] really believe what they're seeing what
[53:33] they're experiencing what they're
[53:34] feeling what they're hearing but the
[53:36] reality of the situation is that thing
[53:37] is not there why they are Delirious amen
[53:41] so this so if we drink from a fountain
[53:43] that is salty amen we our brain will
[53:47] spiritual brain will shut down
[53:49] spiritually we won't behave how we
[53:51] should amen the things that we once were
[53:53] rejoicing in you see someone who's you
[53:55] know I'm sure you've seen movies or
[53:57] whatever people are on a life raft in
[53:58] the middle of the ocean and one of the
[54:01] people just starts drinking salt water
[54:02] cuz they're so thirsty and of course
[54:05] they go crazy there's a bunch of
[54:06] craziness goes on the raft and drama and
[54:08] all these things and that's what happens
[54:10] is someone's so thirsty they're Longing
[54:12] To to to meet that desire in their life
[54:15] so they'll find something that's
[54:16] man-made something that's not of God and
[54:19] they'll drink from that and the biggest
[54:22] problem is where people have a hurt or
[54:23] or pain they will drink from that hurt
[54:25] or pain that is the worst kind of a
[54:28] saltwater drink you can have amen it's
[54:31] amazing when you think about you know I
[54:32] went on BBC the other day there was an
[54:34] article about about Taylor Swift and her
[54:37] her latest album and and and asked the
[54:39] question what are her songs about so I
[54:42] thought well what are her songs about
[54:44] and her songs are breakup songs they are
[54:47] about broken relationships funny
[54:49] feelings of going back to places you
[54:51] once lived but this person's there and
[54:52] this happened there and all these things
[54:54] all of her songs are breakup songs and I
[54:57] think apparently all of her albums are
[54:59] this way so what is it now she's had
[55:01] these bad experiences these salty
[55:03] experiences but now she's singing
[55:05] because it's a fountain within her that
[55:07] is pouring forth into the world and I
[55:10] was thinking what on Earth do people
[55:12] even like kids 10 years old have have
[55:16] with breakup songs they've never been in
[55:19] those experiences they know nothing of
[55:21] relationships they know nothing of
[55:22] dating they know nothing of courtship
[55:24] nothing of marriage nothing of they
[55:26] children
[55:27] but yet that Fountain is pouring into
[55:29] them so her pain of her experience of
[55:31] her life is coming into them and they're
[55:33] drinking from this thing what on Earth
[55:36] do you think that's doing to them it's
[55:38] dehydrating them it's troubling them
[55:40] that same trouble I remember when I was
[55:42] in the world you watch movies and and
[55:44] you know certain directors they would
[55:45] make certain kind of films they may be
[55:47] different in genre or different in the
[55:50] characters and everything but you always
[55:51] left with a funny feeling that's right
[55:54] why because that director is projecting
[55:56] to you that Fountain that's within them
[55:59] it doesn't give you peace doesn't give
[56:00] you Joy doesn't give you any happiness
[56:02] it makes you that why cuz you're because
[56:04] because of drinking that thing in into
[56:06] your spirit you're feeling the same way
[56:08] as that director and it's the same thing
[56:11] with people that you what you're listen
[56:12] to that kind of music like Taylor Swift
[56:14] whatever more but the thing is it's a
[56:16] it's an older one perverting the
[56:18] younger it's it's the older perverting
[56:21] the innocent so it's it's it's getting
[56:24] because people see the fame and the
[56:25] Glamour and all the all the money and
[56:27] all these things and they say I want to
[56:28] be like that but it's someone who's
[56:30] Delirious spiritually is now watering
[56:33] people who are actually not delirious
[56:36] but they get people get dehydrated
[56:38] spiritually their their Spirit gets
[56:40] who's with me this morning amen cuz you
[56:41] got to realize there's a spirit behind
[56:43] all these things I mean it's not because
[56:45] I don't like your music you know well I
[56:47] wouldn't like it in the world anyway but
[56:48] you see it's not because of a taste I'm
[56:50] saying these things I'm saying these
[56:51] things cuz it has an impact amen but so
[56:54] we should not drink of the things of the
[56:55] world and and become Delirious that we
[56:57] can't function in this world don't pull
[56:59] back on me just say Amen okay me because
[57:02] you got to realize there spiritual
[57:03] things now stagnant water kills amen
[57:07] this is stagnant water who would drink
[57:09] from that kind of water I don't see
[57:11] anyone lining up and say oh yum hope I
[57:14] get a cup full of the goobies you know I
[57:16] love those things between my teeth isn't
[57:18] that wonderful no no one's going to want
[57:19] to do that but yet people will will will
[57:23] drink up things spiritually because of
[57:25] pain with within their within their
[57:27] lives they will nurse and you know the
[57:29] reason why I think Taylor Swift is so
[57:30] popular is people have all those same
[57:32] kind of experiences they have the
[57:34] breakups and the pain and the hurt and
[57:36] the and the and the regret of their past
[57:38] so now she's feeding that that spirit in
[57:41] her is feeding and those things and it
[57:43] kind of feeds back and forth that's why
[57:45] you got to be careful what are you
[57:46] feeding on is it a pain in you drinking
[57:50] is it a pain or a hurt or this happen
[57:52] and this and why did this happen in
[57:54] trouble are you drinking in those are
[57:55] you feeding that thing because you got
[57:58] to realize that we are not ordained to
[58:00] feed pain amen no we have there's a bom
[58:03] and Gilead I mean there is a
[58:04] supernatural healing power am mean they
[58:06] can take the pain and turn it into a
[58:08] praise am mean it can take the
[58:10] disappointment give it and and and make
[58:12] a Hallelujah out of it amen cuz God can
[58:14] turn pain a bitter water into a Sweet
[58:17] Water amen Moses you the children of
[58:20] Israel they just had the great victory
[58:21] of the Red Sea they're walking three
[58:23] days through the desert man you'd be
[58:24] thirsty oh yeah
[58:26] you'd have your children saying Mama I'm
[58:28] thirsty Papa I'm thirsty and all these
[58:30] things and trouble and then finally they
[58:32] find this water and maybe they start
[58:34] running cuz they're excited there's
[58:35] water they begin to drink it and it's a
[58:37] bitter water and they say yeah they get
[58:39] mad at Moses and all these things and
[58:41] Moses is Guided by God see that tree on
[58:43] the bank cut it down put it in the put
[58:45] it in the pool it become Sweet Water
[58:48] amen so a bitter experience became sweet
[58:50] so they could have sat there and they
[58:52] could have just nursed that bitter
[58:54] experience and say why wo was me why'
[58:56] this happen this is wrong this should
[58:58] never if God is God if he really loved
[59:00] me this would never have happened or
[59:02] they could have cut that tree down put
[59:04] it in the experience and it would become
[59:05] a sweet experience well you say well how
[59:08] can it become sweet I don't know but
[59:10] take it to Calvary and let God do it for
[59:12] you amen I don't know the answer but God
[59:14] knows the answer amen you say well no I
[59:16] want to hold on to this pain you know
[59:18] pain invites the spirit amen hurt brings
[59:21] a you it's like a bruised cell in a body
[59:24] amen like that's how cancer gets in the
[59:25] prophecy is a cell gets bruised then a
[59:28] demon steps into that cell and begins to
[59:30] spread that cell and it becomes a Cancer
[59:32] and you know the strange thing is the
[59:33] body naturally cannot fight cancer
[59:35] doesn't identify it as the
[59:38] enemy so and that but sadly the reason
[59:42] that people die is because that cancer
[59:43] overwhelms the system the body can't
[59:46] operate more and it and it passes away
[59:48] but you see something's got to come and
[59:50] identify that thing as the enemy then
[59:52] the immune system within the body can
[59:54] fight the thing that's why there's
[59:56] chemotherapy and different things amen
[59:58] so that so so many things people can be
[1:00:00] feeding on and they don't realize that
[1:00:02] their spirit's being bruised and there's
[1:00:04] now A Life coming to that Spirit doesn't
[1:00:06] mean they're possessed it just means
[1:00:07] they're troubled there's a there's
[1:00:08] something coming to their system am me
[1:00:11] but they don't know it's the enemy they
[1:00:12] think it's they think they justify their
[1:00:15] position because of hurt well if you
[1:00:17] were there and this happened to you you
[1:00:19] would feel the same way probably but you
[1:00:22] go to Calvary you let God take it you
[1:00:25] get you let him heal you wash it out of
[1:00:28] you amen but the devil wants you to keep
[1:00:31] that thing because hey this happened to
[1:00:33] you and this is real sure I'm not I'm
[1:00:35] not downplaying anything that's happened
[1:00:37] to anybody I'm not the worst of thing
[1:00:39] I'm not down I'm not downplaying nothing
[1:00:41] right but don't hold on to that thing
[1:00:43] don't nurse that thing don't get used to
[1:00:46] the feeling that that memory gives you I
[1:00:48] mean you should be so offended at that
[1:00:50] thing that the devil's trespassing into
[1:00:52] your spirit say Satan get away in the
[1:00:53] name of Jesus Christ I may feel this way
[1:00:56] but this is not my identity this is this
[1:00:58] thing does not define me I mean many
[1:01:00] nations are founded on a you know Israel
[1:01:03] always goes back to 1948 or whenever the
[1:01:06] nation was founded you know and the wars
[1:01:08] they fought that's why they say never
[1:01:09] again they have their systems and their
[1:01:11] missiles and all these things because
[1:01:12] they say this is how we are founded this
[1:01:14] is how we're going to stay America has
[1:01:16] the Fourth of July cuz they remember you
[1:01:19] know you know the overthrow of the
[1:01:20] British and all these things we know
[1:01:21] that country slided from their
[1:01:23] Foundation but they used to be this is
[1:01:25] how we are this is how we were this is
[1:01:27] how we remain see and the thing is we
[1:01:29] must go back to our founding time well
[1:01:32] when was your founding time well before
[1:01:34] the foundation of the world am mean the
[1:01:35] lamb was slain my name was put on the
[1:01:37] Lamb's Book of Life amen and that's my
[1:01:39] identity that's the reason I am who I am
[1:01:42] amen that's my Foundation amen so I
[1:01:44] think we should stay with that
[1:01:46] Foundation amen if the Lord Jesus would
[1:01:48] die for you and I amen if he purchase
[1:01:50] our Redemption that should be the thing
[1:01:52] that defines us nothing else that's
[1:01:55] right
[1:01:56] hallelujah amen you take Israel you take
[1:01:58] America they've got they've had a lot of
[1:02:00] things in their history but they go back
[1:02:02] to that founding thing we've had a lot
[1:02:04] of things in our history and our
[1:02:05] Christian walk in our life but what's
[1:02:07] our founding thing what defines you does
[1:02:10] your pain Define you or does your
[1:02:11] identity in him does the power of the
[1:02:14] blood Define you what defines you this
[1:02:16] morning Hallelujah Lord amen the Lord
[1:02:18] Jesus defines me he's my identity that's
[1:02:21] my founding this is when this nation was
[1:02:22] founded the kingdom of God was founded
[1:02:24] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:26] God has transmitted that Revelation down
[1:02:28] to the hearts of you and I that we
[1:02:30] realize we came from God we're going
[1:02:31] back to God and nothing is going to stop
[1:02:34] us am me we're not going to drink from
[1:02:35] stagnated water no more we're going to
[1:02:37] drink from The Well of Living Water and
[1:02:39] if the devil tries to put this poison
[1:02:41] down your throat you have right to say
[1:02:42] Satan take it away in the name of Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ I ain't drinking this nonsense no
[1:02:46] more Lord I ain't going to be dehydrated

[1:03:34] drunk on something different I mean
[1:03:36] there's a people who have drunk on
[1:03:37] something different and it's not this
[1:03:38] cup that they're drinking from they're
[1:03:40] drinking from the cup of blessing
[1:03:42] they're drinking from the cup of the
[1:03:43] Lord Jesus amen we're not drinking from
[1:03:45] this cup amen if you are caught up if

[1:05:18] amen but we're living in a Resurrection
[1:05:20] season but you

[1:05:24] lose their
[1:05:26] sight of the reason they're there we're
[1:05:29] here that God can express himself to
[1:05:31] this Dying World we're here that his
[1:05:33] work can put on flesh we're here that he
[1:05:35] can be glorified we're here that he can
[1:05:36] be worshiped he's looking for a place of
[1:05:38] worship he's not looking for Four Walls
[1:05:40] of a building he's looking for a human
[1:05:41] soul he's looking for a place of his
[1:05:43] rest amen a place where he can receive
[1:05:45] joy and love and adoration you know we
[1:05:48] get the opportunity to love on God Amen
[1:05:51] to pour out our love and affection on
[1:05:53] him day by day week by week Hallelujah
[1:05:56] amen that's why we're built isn't that
[1:05:57] wonderful I'm I'm glad I'm not just a
[1:05:59] serap from saying holy holy holy is the
[1:06:01] Lord God
[1:06:02] Almighty with no
[1:06:04] relationship just almost just
[1:06:07] robotic I'm glad I'm not that way I'm
[1:06:10] glad there's a real love amen a real Joy
[1:06:13] why because he first loved me he
[1:06:15] purchased my salvation on calvary's tree
[1:06:17] amen amen but you see it says here um uh
[1:06:20] Jesus giving this Parable here he says
[1:06:23] and the Lord said who is it then that is
[1:06:25] faithful and a wise Steward of whom the
[1:06:26] Lord shall make rule over his household
[1:06:29] to give him their portion of meat and
[1:06:30] due season blessed is that servant whom
[1:06:33] his Lord when he cometh shall find so
[1:06:37] doing so that's why it's so important
[1:06:40] just live the sweet humble Christian
[1:06:42] Life whatever you're called to do in
[1:06:44] this world just live it with all your
[1:06:46] heart love him with all that within you
[1:06:49] then you'll be found doing
[1:06:51] amen amen I mean it's sorry it's simple
[1:06:54] but it is simple the gospel simple
[1:06:56] Walking with God is simple amen so
[1:06:58] whatever he's called you to do you just
[1:07:00] do it with all your heart love him with
[1:07:01] all that with all that is within you
[1:07:03] amen then you are you shall be found
[1:07:07] doing amen of a truth I say unto you he
[1:07:10] that will make him ruler over all that
[1:07:12] he hath but if that servant say in his
[1:07:14] heart it's not even out loud my Lord
[1:07:17] delayeth is coming have a secret meeting
[1:07:20] inside he's not coming yet I've got time
[1:07:23] I can go do and shall begin to beat the
[1:07:26] man's servants and maidens and to drink
[1:07:28] eat and drink and be
[1:07:31] drunken so what happens is people lose
[1:07:34] their
[1:07:35] sight they lose that Joy of their
[1:07:37] salvation they lose the reality that I
[1:07:40] was once lost and now I'm found they
[1:07:42] forget when God found them God's done so
[1:07:46] much for us children hasn't he hasn't he
[1:07:48] done so much for us he's poured out his
[1:07:51] anointing again and again he's answered
[1:07:54] prayer again and again and again in
[1:07:58] spite of our feelings our ups our Downs
[1:08:00] our troubles our fussing our fighting
[1:08:02] our stewing our all the he still spoils
[1:08:05] us he's done so much right now you you
[1:08:08] about all he's done if we had time we
[1:08:11] actually went seat by seat and you and
[1:08:13] and God brought to remembrance
[1:08:15] everything he's done for you we'd be
[1:08:17] here till the Rapture and maybe after
[1:08:18] the Millennium we'd be here a very long
[1:08:20] time amen so we must never ever forget
[1:08:23] those things but this is what happens
[1:08:24] when people when they forget those
[1:08:26] things then they begin to go to other
[1:08:29] sources what they begin to beat the men
[1:08:32] servants and the maidens they begin to
[1:08:33] cause trouble around them and to eat and
[1:08:37] drink and to be drunken but drunken with
[1:08:39] what because if you're drunk on the Holy
[1:08:41] Ghost you're not going to beat your
[1:08:42] brother or sister you're not going to
[1:08:44] cause you're only going to cause trouble
[1:08:45] to the devil's Kingdom right you're not
[1:08:47] going to cause trouble within right so
[1:08:49] they so these ones are drunken just like
[1:08:52] what we read about in Revelation 17
[1:08:54] there they are drunk they get drunk with
[1:08:56] the people of the Earth from the cup of
[1:08:59] the
[1:09:00] so we don't want to drink from the
[1:09:03] wrong
[1:09:05] Fountain am mean you look at you look at
[1:09:07] how this you know what does this cause
[1:09:10] you say what does this cause well the
[1:09:12] Apostle Paul would Define it very well

[1:09:22] shall they've arrived okay you've been
[1:09:24] living in this probably your entire life
[1:09:26] all of us for men shall be lovers of
[1:09:28] their own selves see a Delirious person
[1:09:31] thinks they're
[1:09:33] awesome I'm just going to let that stick
[1:09:36] a Delirious person thinks they're always
[1:09:38] right a Delirious person thinks they can
[1:09:41] do no wrong a Delirious person points
[1:09:43] the finger at someone else I say Adam
[1:09:46] when he fell became
[1:09:47] delirious right before before he fell
[1:09:51] the his last his last act as a as a
[1:09:54] position Son of God was to to try and
[1:09:57] save Eve and then his first act as a
[1:09:59] fallen man was to blame Eve and blame
[1:10:01] God see that that is that is insanity
[1:10:05] see he says the woman you gave me God
[1:10:08] you actually you have set me up to fail
[1:10:10] God you've hatched this thing I've done
[1:10:13] nothing wrong I'm the innocent party you
[1:10:15] should be apologizing to me God look
[1:10:17] what you've
[1:10:18] arranged how how many people do that I'm
[1:10:21] not looking at anyone particular but how
[1:10:23] many people do that right they they say
[1:10:25] this is God's fault I'm going to be mad
[1:10:27] at him I'm going to I'm going to I'm
[1:10:28] going to give him the cold
[1:10:29] shoulder don't waste the time I'd rather
[1:10:33] spend the time worshiping God I'd rather
[1:10:35] spend the time praising God you say well
[1:10:37] you feel bad feel negative we don't
[1:10:39] worship our
[1:10:40] feelings amen this world is based on
[1:10:43] emotion living the now and living the
[1:10:45] moment and catching the you know trying
[1:10:46] to seek that high and all those things
[1:10:48] we don't live by our feelings we live by
[1:10:51] Revelation praise the Lord amen amen
[1:10:54] cover
[1:10:56] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:10:58] to parents unthankful Unholy without
[1:11:01] natural affection truth Breakers false
[1:11:04] accusers incontinent Fierce despises of
[1:11:07] those that are not
[1:11:09] dehydrated amen that have a sound mind
[1:11:13] traitors heady High minded lovers of
[1:11:16] pleasure more than lovers of God so he's
[1:11:19] talking about Christians here having a
[1:11:21] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:11:23] thereof from such turn away what is that
[1:11:26] power they're denying the power that
[1:11:28] that power the power that the Lord can
[1:11:31] change them don't deny God can't help
[1:11:34] you don't deny God can't deliver you
[1:11:37] don't deny that your case is too hard
[1:11:40] God says is there anything too hard for
[1:11:41] me let's just let's just ask a question
[1:11:44] this may sound ridiculous but listen are
[1:11:46] you four days dead in the
[1:11:48] grave is your body decomposing yes
[1:11:52] sir no no you're here you're alive so no
[1:11:58] one's in lazarus's position this morning
[1:12:01] yeah but yet the resurrection and the
[1:12:03] life went by his way and said Lazarus
[1:12:06] come forth and the state he was in is
[1:12:09] not the state he stayed in so is
[1:12:11] anything too hard for God let's just
[1:12:14] just really just put it in perspective
[1:12:15] no nothing is too hard for God you say
[1:12:18] it's been too long too far whatever
[1:12:20] Moses was 40 years
[1:12:22] backsliding and God found him and do you
[1:12:25] know what was planted in his life before
[1:12:27] he went 40 years his mother telling him
[1:12:30] he's a promised child he's going to be
[1:12:32] the deliver he is the answer to the
[1:12:35] prophecy given to Abraham amen that God
[1:12:37] is going to bring the children of Israel
[1:12:39] out he's the answer to it so that was
[1:12:41] planted in his heart when he was a young
[1:12:43] boy because remember his mother raised
[1:12:45] him in Pharaoh's Palace amen as as the
[1:12:49] wetness when he was 40 years old he
[1:12:51] backslid ran
[1:12:53] away those things never left him yeah
[1:12:57] and God seeson God came and quickened
[1:13:00] that promise he quickened the seeds his
[1:13:02] mother saw into his life amen so never
[1:13:05] say anything's too hard for God he ran
[1:13:07] for 40 years and God got a hold of him
[1:13:09] amen so let's not let's not put any
[1:13:11] parameters saying it's too far gone
[1:13:14] nothing's too far
[1:13:15] gone amen but you see now whenever
[1:13:18] there's whenever there's a a a spill of
[1:13:22] stagnated fountain water where to get
[1:13:25] get the right team in to clean it up now
[1:13:28] this is not so years ago at work someone
[1:13:30] dropped a bottle of concentrated
[1:13:33] hydrochloric acid and it wasn't even in
[1:13:36] the building that that was in a hallway
[1:13:39] which was separated from a door from the
[1:13:40] rest of the building we had to evacuate
[1:13:43] that thing for 4 hours the whole
[1:13:45] building cuz of one bottle of acid was
[1:13:47] was spilled s sat in the sunshine for 4
[1:13:50] hours until until the right people
[1:13:54] turned up
[1:13:55] and and dealt with that spill amen so so
[1:13:59] to me the key of the whole thing is that
[1:14:01] if there stagnated water being poured
[1:14:03] out leave that leave that situation
[1:14:07] leave that conversation and go to the
[1:14:10] prince of the in for a while amen and
[1:14:13] basking his goodness his word because
[1:14:16] that will start to cleanse the effects
[1:14:17] of it out of your life amen and then the
[1:14:20] holy call the call the Lord on the scene
[1:14:22] cuz he's the Hazmat man amen and he will
[1:14:24] CL that spill up Hallelujah and then you
[1:14:27] can walk on and and continue your life I
[1:14:31] hope that's all right well there's a lot
[1:14:32] of science things coming in well I'm
[1:14:34] sorry but you
[1:14:35] know hey I got a you know we're in the
[1:14:38] sunshine it was good but just get out in
[1:14:40] the sun again don't just sit there with
[1:14:43] all the fumes and all the trouble and
[1:14:44] all the problems no go out into the go
[1:14:47] out into the go out into the sunshine
[1:14:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:52] now it's amazing here in Jeremiah now
[1:14:55] you look at this this is the effect of
[1:14:56] drinking from drinking from the wrong
[1:15:01] Source he says have a nation changed
[1:15:04] their gods now just think about Jeremiah
[1:15:05] here Jeremiah is a prophet that God has
[1:15:09] sent to Israel because Israel's going to
[1:15:11] be carried away into captivity by the
[1:15:14] Babylonians the countdown was on and God
[1:15:18] sent him there to to swing to actually
[1:15:21] give Israel an opportunity to repent and
[1:15:23] come back to him
[1:15:25] but the very reason they ended up in
[1:15:28] that in that catastrophe was because
[1:15:31] they changed their gods to something
[1:15:33] that wasn't even a God that's what
[1:15:35] they've done see have a nation changed
[1:15:37] their gods which are yet no Gods but my
[1:15:40] people have changed their Glory from
[1:15:42] that which does not
[1:15:44] profit has this world helped anyone I'm
[1:15:47] talking about spiritually now has it
[1:15:50] helped anyone no no so so they've
[1:15:53] swapped and and and and this is what
[1:15:55] they've done they they they went from
[1:15:58] serving the lord uh the Lord Jehovah I
[1:16:01] say the Lord Jesus that was God in the
[1:16:02] Old Testament right the one who brought
[1:16:05] them out of Egypt the one who brought
[1:16:07] the plagues in Egypt the one who parted
[1:16:09] the Red Sea the one who brought them
[1:16:11] through the Wilderness the one who
[1:16:12] brought down the walls of Jericho the
[1:16:14] one who gave them the promised land the
[1:16:16] one who anointed David to kill Goliath
[1:16:19] the one who anointed the Mighty Men to
[1:16:20] do the mighty things they did the one
[1:16:21] who anointed Solomon to build the temple
[1:16:23] the one who anointed elah on Mount
[1:16:25] Carmel the one who did many mighty Works
[1:16:28] Hallelujah but yet they swapped him for
[1:16:30] a God that wasn't a God so they went
[1:16:33] from a fountain let's just but my people
[1:16:35] have changed their glory for that which
[1:16:37] doth not profit be astonished oh ye
[1:16:39] Heavens at this and be horribly afraid
[1:16:41] be ye very desolate sayith the Lord for
[1:16:44] my people have committed two evils they
[1:16:45] have forsaken me the Fountain of Living
[1:16:47] Waters and hewed them out systems broken
[1:16:50] systems which can hold no water so
[1:16:54] what's happened they have they they're
[1:16:55] basically drinking salt water again if I
[1:16:58] put it that way they went from this
[1:17:00] Fountain of Living Water that brought
[1:17:01] them Deliverance brought them healing
[1:17:03] brought them salvation you know answered
[1:17:05] their prayers you know did many mighty
[1:17:08] things and yet they hued out their own
[1:17:10] systems now a broken system here can't
[1:17:14] hold water it leaks it's a man-made tank
[1:17:17] it's not a god-given living water now I
[1:17:22] just thought of this so so this is here
[1:17:23] when when when I was in the Solomon
[1:17:25] Islands you can see this tank down the
[1:17:27] tank down the bottom here it's not
[1:17:29] assistant in the terms of a Bible one
[1:17:31] hun out of stone in the ground but it's
[1:17:33] a it's a man-made tank and a lot of
[1:17:35] those tanks were leaking cuz the Taps
[1:17:37] weren't properly put and they weren't
[1:17:39] sealed so the thing would be be leaking
[1:17:41] water you see here the um the the
[1:17:45] downpipe just goes into basically a hole
[1:17:47] in the top and it's got this uh Mish
[1:17:49] screen over it that's not even very
[1:17:51] small Mish now over those over those um
[1:17:54] roofs rats would run every night you
[1:17:57] hear them scur I've never seen so many
[1:17:59] rats in my life as I saw in that one
[1:18:01] trip at least about maybe two three
[1:18:04] every two or three minutes you you see
[1:18:05] rats running around inside and scarring
[1:18:08] jumping from roof to roof so here's
[1:18:10] these rats running on this roof and they
[1:18:12] and they do their business up there
[1:18:13] where's it going to end up in the tank
[1:18:16] you know leaves fall there where do they
[1:18:18] end up in the tank right even with that
[1:18:20] mesh there you know so they were
[1:18:22] drinking instead of drinking from the
[1:18:24] that they had in the place they had
[1:18:27] these man-made
[1:18:28] tanks we don't want to drink from a
[1:18:30] man-made tank because a man-made tank
[1:18:33] can bring disease I mean bugs can grow
[1:18:36] in there maybe there's mosquitoes
[1:18:37] growing in there all those kind of
[1:18:39] things see so we don't want to drink
[1:18:41] from that kind of thing it brings
[1:18:43] disease and sickness and
[1:18:45] trouble but you see we are not ordained
[1:18:48] to drink from a man-made tank amen but
[1:18:50] we have this Fountain of Living Water
[1:18:53] now you think about when the Lord Jesus
[1:18:55] would so I've been so much on the
[1:18:56] negative I don't mean to be he said
[1:18:58] Jesus would say the last day of the
[1:18:59] feast he says he says he that believeth
[1:19:02] on me if any man thirst let him come
[1:19:04] unto me and drink and he that believeth
[1:19:06] on me as the scripture has said out of
[1:19:07] his belly shall flow rivers of Living
[1:19:09] Water for this he spake he of the spirit
[1:19:12] which they which believe on him should
[1:19:13] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:19:15] given because Jesus was not yet
[1:19:17] glorified so those so he's saying come
[1:19:20] unto me and then out of you will come
[1:19:23] these fountains this River of of rivers
[1:19:25] multiple rivers of Living Water and to
[1:19:28] me it's the same because that rock that
[1:19:30] followed Israel in the wilderness that
[1:19:31] Moses smok the water came out that rock
[1:19:33] was Christ now that c now that rock
[1:19:36] comes into you and I I mean so the same
[1:19:38] volume of water that came out of there
[1:19:40] in the Old Testament as a shadow comes
[1:19:42] out of you and the reality amen that
[1:19:44] when people come into your presence amen
[1:19:46] you're not giving them stagnated water
[1:19:48] they don't become more dehydrated they
[1:19:50] don't become more Delirious they don't
[1:19:52] become more troubled no they they have a
[1:19:55] lifegiving resource they're drinking
[1:19:57] from amen it gives them a satisfi it
[1:19:59] gives them a peace it gives them a
[1:20:01] stability who's ever been so dehydrated
[1:20:03] man you just got to get a drink then you
[1:20:06] drink that drink and you're like oh I
[1:20:08] feel so much better I can think straight
[1:20:10] that headache goes that trouble goes why
[1:20:12] CU you're drinking from water that can
[1:20:15] help you Hallelujah and then so now
[1:20:17] spiritually now you got to realize this
[1:20:19] thing's in you if you got the baptism of
[1:20:21] the Holy Ghost this is in you I mean you
[1:20:23] have you have the you have the thing
[1:20:25] that can meet every need in this world
[1:20:27] is within you amen if there's fire what
[1:20:30] puts out fire amen water amen so there's
[1:20:33] trouble there's a fire Cooks up in the
[1:20:35] family fussing fighting trouble whatever
[1:20:37] more there's a fountain of Living Water
[1:20:39] that's on tap amen amen hallelujah that
[1:20:41] you can let flow out of your life amen
[1:20:44] to put out the fires of unbelief and
[1:20:46] pressure and trouble and depression and
[1:20:47] Spirits coming all these things because
[1:20:49] remember this Fountain within us has a
[1:20:51] force behind it amen it's not something
[1:20:54] that you've got to suck out it's not
[1:20:56] saying you going to pump out am mean no
[1:20:57] it's pushing out am mean there's there's
[1:21:00] a force within us that pushes this water
[1:21:02] out amen and if there's a force pushing
[1:21:05] this water out it doesn't matter what
[1:21:06] the devil tries to pour in no the water
[1:21:09] that's pushing out of you is far greater
[1:21:11] Hallelujah am mean then that's what that
[1:21:14] is like you see this here there's this
[1:21:16] acid on the ground what is this guy
[1:21:19] doing he's got a Fountain of Living
[1:21:20] Water he's got this fire hose he's
[1:21:23] trying to use it who's with me today
[1:21:26] amen so instead of that acid being in
[1:21:28] trouble and all this is this could get
[1:21:29] real bad he's got this hose that's
[1:21:31] tapped into the main line Hallelujah he
[1:21:34] just opens that valve and starts hosing
[1:21:36] the thing down and then and then that
[1:21:38] acid doesn't just get diluted it gets
[1:21:40] washed away amen it's the same thing
[1:21:42] with you and our friends the devil can
[1:21:44] try and bring in an acid into your life

[1:22:04] wants us to think the problem's too big
[1:22:06] I can't cope I'm too stressed I can't do
[1:22:07] it no and then what does that do that
[1:22:10] tries to block up what's within you but
[1:22:13] there comes a point where the pressure
[1:22:15] who's ever seen like a damn burst who's
[1:22:18] ever seen there pressure builds up
[1:22:19] there's a crack right but there's such a
[1:22:21] force of that water behind that wall it
[1:22:23] just goes sh the devil can try and damn

[1:22:48] away this morning in the name of Jesus
