exhausted to be spiritless don't be weary and wello for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are the household of faith aren't you glad you have this opportunity amen you don't have any opportunity to serve the devil anymore he's gone out of the picture you've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so we have this opportunity amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight amen let's pray Hallelujah Lord Jesus dear God we just even right now we feel your presence and we just so I'm so excited to be gathered with the purchase of your blood this night Lord to lift up Praises in your name name to give you glory Lord to approach your throne of grace because of what you have done for us Lord it Thrills my heart and I just pray father as we have this prayer meeting May you take over oh God may it not be us praying but may it be you through us praying oh God and Father be with all those who couldn't make it tonight Lord Jesus be their portion as they're watching tonight I pray your great presence would fill their house fill their hearts Fill Their Lives Lord and meet every Need For Your Glory we thank you for this night in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I just want to title this uh tonight amen we have such a great opportunity amen as as as um you know Paul would write to the Galatians here as we have therefore opportunity you know we're not always going to have this opportunity we're not always going to have this time you know we we can gather we can have lunch we can wash each other's feet have communion praise God and pray together sing the songs of Z together and have Fellowship we won't always have this opportunity am me because we're going to be on streets of gold one day I know it's going to continue on there but I think we should every day is a gift I mean every day is a gift we're not here to just occupy time just to fill in a slot and just take up some time no every day is a gift of God Amen every day is an opportunity to praise him to walk with him to know him more I mean to enjoy him more Amen to love him more every day is an opportunity and it's not just an opportunity to love God but to do good unto all men especially to them who are the household of faith amen so we don't want to tear one another down we don't want to think negatively of one another we don't want to criticize one another no we're here to do good to one another cuz we're on the same team amen we're not against each other amen this is not red against blue or whatever color against whatever color we're on the same team hallelujah we're on the same team we have the same father we're being bought by the same blood amen so let's rally together around the word of God Amen let's enjoy him let's praise him more cuz we have an opportunity to walk with him in this day amen in the darkest of all day um ages we have an opportunity to walk with God like Enoch did so I think we should walk with him like never before I think we should push the battle I think we should lay aside all all foolishness I mean all backbiting malice Strife lies whatever it is lay it aside kick it out the door and walk with God I have no time to walk with lies I have no time to walk with half truth I have no time to walk with criticism if you come to criticize someone to me you're talking to the wrong person I'm not the devil's trash can I don't care about what other people do I'm walking with God and if you really love someone and care about them you'll pray for them more than anything else you won't criticize you won't add you won't spread you'll pray if you really love them I'm sick of this nonsense of lies and slander going around the place let's get rid of it right now I mean because one day you'll stand in front of God you'll give an account for that when you had an opportunity to bless you tried to curse but God will turn and say what I have blessed I blessed I cannot reverse it so why would you ever talk against a household of faith me why on Earth would you do it what a waste of time why entertain those thoughts with brother so and so do this sister so and so do this we're all human we need a body change it's going to be glorious the only one who'll never fail you is Jesus Christ yes sir that's just the that's just the that's just the be naked facts amen you the longer you know me the more I will disappoint you and the church said amen so let's just get over ourselves and walk with God I mean let's get over our complexes and our misunderstandings and all this nonsense and let's walk with God cuz I have an opportunity to be good to you I mean to pray for you to walk with you in this battle we're on the same team turn your gun towards the enemy don't fire down the trench I mean don't fire your brother that's charging forward get information get the word of God and start firing at the Devil amen don't put up this well this person said this and they said this 5 years ago and 50 years ago this happened Leave the Past alone I mean the devil wants to resurrect the past why do people want to resurrect what happened in the past is it to bring peace is it here to bring joy to bring love to bring reconciliation no it's to settle scores to lick Old Wounds Amen to bring up past hatreds all these things we can't change the past but we can change the future I mean we can change the present amen you can either be bitter because of what you've gone through what your family's gone through what you're going through or brother Bram said you take any anything to the Lord it will become a sweet experience I I'm a sweet tooth naturally Savory I a little bit but sweet you're talking my language amen so so any any any Savory experience or bitter experience I take it to C it becomes a sweet experience if you're sitting with bitterness in your heart you need to take it to the Lord you need to repent of holding on to it and you need to take it to the Lord that's a big problem that we don't do is we don't repent I mean we we we um entertain the devil so long we need to repent of that amen repentance brings separation amen it brings separation from your past brings separation from sin bring separation from doubt amen I God's a separator he separates light from Darkness he separates Faith from unbelief he separates pain from praise amen he separates and he only wants to separate you to good things not to bad things amen so let us walk with God Amen brother Bram says if you want to see isusa Street become a sheep again the prophet never criticized isusa Street what happened at isusa Street God took over the church am mean God wanted to speak he spoke he wanted to do this he did that God took over every member of that street Mission cuz they had a burden Lord we' have read your word we see the gifts we see the reality of the Holy Ghost we read about it but we want to taste it we want to experience it we want to hear it want to walk in it amen and so if you want to see that become a lamb if you want dead Message Church order only St a goat St message goat I don't think I'm looking at Goats tonight I think I'm looking at sheep who actually want to surrender to the moving of the Holy Ghost who actually want God to live through them isn't that what we gather for isn't that why we're Believers is that not why God sent Malachi for to restore us to the faith of the fathers and we don't live by gifts we live by the word and if we live by the word the gifts come and healing comes the Holy Ghost comes Miracles come Visions come Dreams Come why because we're living by the word we're not taking the gifts and not the giver if you have the giver you have everything amen and we're walking by the revealed word of the hour amen hallelujah I trust you understand that because it used to be in the past these big Baptist Spirits would come among the message saying we don't need the gifts I say kill that devil and say Lord everything you died for I want I want to enjoy it I want to walk in it I want to experience it everything you have you got to read First Corinthians what Paul says about those kind of things amen so we have this opportunity to let God live Hallelujah we have an opportunity you think about this we have the most blessed brother Braham said this is the goldenest of Ages you got read about it in the M he says it a few times he said if God could have asked him before the foundation of the world what time that that that that he could pick to go to the world in he'd say well it would have been amazing to be here when Jesus was in the days of his flesh that would have been an incredible day but he said this day is the better day amen because this day amen eternity is is blending with time amen where the people that Jesus redeemed he is going to take up into glory amen he said if he could have picked a season to preach the gospel it would be this season and I am so thankful friends that I'm not living back when the prophet lived I mean because he was seeing a bride coming in preview he seeing a bride coming in maturity seeing a bride dressed as the word and he only saw her as an infant church but now we're seeing her as a mature woman amen dressed in the word made in the image of God hallelujah so I'm so thankful I'm not living back there amen but I'm thankful I'm living in this season am me where everything the prophets are I'm seeing and manifest I'm seeing God live I'm seeing God put on flesh I'm seeing the word manifested in the people in the old and the parents and the young people I'm seeing God live Hallelujah this is the greatest time to be alive we have this opportunity I mean we're not just reading here I mean about some ideas of one day it'll come and one day it'll come we say and he's here and he's here and the word is here hallelujah we have this opportunity I mean why not Embrace this opportunity why not say Lord take my life in my life Lord do what you want to do Lord live in me amen if you want me to be a prayer Warrior I'll be in prayer if you want me to be a living example I'll be a living example if you want me to forgive I'm going to forgive Hallelujah if you want me to show Mercy I'll show Mercy Hallelujah we have this opportunity why not take it I mean the Lord is saying take this opportunity walk with me like never before don't just Plateau don't just take it for granted what we have no embrace it Lord it is the Great a season to be alive Hallelujah but you see the problem is the devil wants it just to be Duty that's right he want say well I'm expect it's expected of me why are you preaching not it's expect no it's not preaching is a worship that's right I Don't Preach because I'm expected no it's a worship to God where I can actually Express back to God what I think of him H what I think of his people what I think about what he's done and when I stand here this is a worship when we song Lead it's a worship you play it's a worship you praise it's a worship our whole life is a worship to God Amen but you see you see say feed the flock of God which is among you taking oversight thereof not by constraint now this is not and I know Peter is saying this is to ministers and so on but to me this actually is speaking to everyone cuz we all have a Ministry we all here to meet one another's needs how you doing brother how you doing sister I'll pray for you I'm here we're in the together good to see you so nice to see you again I missed you amen I know it's just been a few days since Sunday but I missed you from that time I've been thinking I've been praying about you Hallelujah the Lord woke me up there I was praying for you amen what's that that's having a Ministry you say but no one sees it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter God said Jesus said who's God he said pray secretly in the closet don't go advertise what you're praying pray and then you'll be rewarded openly am amen so we all have but see but see not by constraint not because it's compulsory oh it's expected of me it's my duty well I have to I'm a pastor therefore it's expect no I don't do this because of constraint I don't do this cuz it's expected no this is a worship Hallelujah I get to embrace the body of Jesus Christ prise the Lord that's you but give me a hug bro I mean yeah give me a hug give me a hug buddy here is the body of Jesus Christ I get to say God bless you if I had time I go run everyone right we get to serve God I don't I trust that's not too big to swallow are you the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I get to serve Christ on the earth I get to care for her look after her amen you with me so why would I have time for any negative thought about anyone where does that thought come from it's not the lord it's not the word oh but they did this they did that can't you look beyond their fault and see their need can't you look with redeeming love at that person can't you look beyond what they've done if you can't let go of grudges if you cannot forgive you will not be forgiven that's what the Bible says you can't forgive Jesus won't forgive you oh but I went to church I knew all the quots I knew the scriptures I sang all the songs you won't be forgiven it's really that simple I want to be forgiven I don't want God's judgment I want his Mercy Hallelujah am mean I want his Mercy Hallelujah and if you obtain Mercy then you can be merciful amen so if you know the mercy of God you can be merciful if you don't know the mercy of God you're not merciful so people who are not merciful don't know the mercy of God they do everything by constraint well the word says this and yes that's true and yes God did send a Prophet this is all right so I have to no I I live this life because I want to not because I have to not be I don't I'm not a Christian cuz I'm afraid of hell I'm not afraid I'm not a Christian cuz I'm afraid of the Great Tribulation I'm not a Christian because I'm afraid I'm going to be left behind I I I'm a Christian because I love him because he first loved me amen I I I live this way because he is worth it because he is glorious he is the king of all Kings he's the Lord of all Lords I mean he purchased my salvation on calvary's tree I mean when I was an enemy he died for me Hallelujah so this is why live this way not by constraint not because it's compulsory or or because of necessity or because of what people will think of me no we live but before the audience of one sure well what do you trying to say you don't like people's Applause and a God bless you to thank you I appreciate I appreciate all those things I'm human but the real audience I live before is him amen he's the one I'm living for he's the one I'm looking for amen he's the one who's coming back for me I mean I'm looking for him to come step through the door one day and say it's time you've been looking for this day it's time amen you used your opportunity hallelujah amen to walk with me in the season that you're alive in Hallelujah so amen let's just I think we should do that amen he says one of these halfway Christians supposed to be the most miserable person in the world oh I can't do this my church know it if I did that God knows you're doing it what does it make right there but have your whole heart centered on God and stay right with it then you're happy walking peaceably with him I mean someone who does things by constraint because it's expected of them their heart's not in it I say throw your whole heart into the Lord Jesus Christ throw your whole heart into the word of God Amen every believer that's done it has never regretted it amen they'll say absolutely it was worth it it was worth the pain it was worth the think about the worst day being a Christian so the worst day job ever had is better than the best day the devil can give you think about it for a second Glory the world wants to give you the best day he can give you but that is far compared to the worst day job ever had job's worst day is be I'll take that day any day I'll take the the best day the world can give me that's right that's you're a crazy man no my brain was Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ I know where I come from I know where I'm going hallelujah hallelujah so let us let us because we have this opport I'm just going to maybe I'm just going to close with these thoughts we have an opportunity let's use this opportunity don't let it don't let it pass through your hands do good to the household of faith well how can I do that love them like you love the Lord serve them like you serve the Lord pray for them if you really love them care for them send them how are you doing send a message I'm praying for you everything's going to be okay we're going to get through this we're family amen we're going to we're going to be on the other side send send like encouraging quote of scripture to someone do good to the household see do good to all men but especially unto them who are the household of faith now if now if Jesus can call Judas friend and none of you are Judas what should I call you oh but don't you know that that person we got to look Beyond we got to we need to grow up we need to grow up not be tossed to and fro by sideways comments and this thing and this person and this agenda and these things throw those things away walk with God am because it's amazing how a lie can derail someone a woman comes up before brother baham in the 20th century Prophet film and and and and the Lord begins to discern her life you can see it there's a closeup there's a well I'll put it on the brothers and sisters everyone's I'm sure you've seen it she starts crying he says look your pastor's got polar there's a holster on your church oh a man's told a lie on you she starts crying a man professing Divine Healing and and he says to her you're not a witch God bless you so this woman is all stirred up because someone who is a pretending to be spiritual calls her a witch so that lie got her under this distress we had to get rid of that lie we had to get rid of that kind of nonsense amen no we're here to serve the Lord but you see that lie mider Liv that way what will the truth do stop har stop harboring negative doesn't matter how much evidence Jesus knew every when he was riding on the sand and all the Pharisees were there and the woman was there caught in adultery he could have written Rabbi Jones this day this this day this and if he had enough time he could have written his whole book of life out and then the next one could have written his whole book of life out could have written his whole book of life out could have written her book of life out but then when they all left he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more and he knew all of the her life everything she did and yet he looked beyond her fault and said I forgive you God said no more oh but that person said that the other day our lord Jesus knew our whole book of life you got to think about the magnitude we would all hate our thoughts to be on the screen for just a moment from today and he knew your whole book of life everything you said your motive every down to the detail detail detail he didn't look at that he didn't take that into account when he died for you on Calvary he so they're my daughter they're my son they're my child I can't lose them cuz they're part of me that's how he thought now what about you about one another what makes a goat resentment unconfessed sin unforgiveness amen all those things they make a goat what makes a lamb Lord take it all from me Lord I forgive them Lord you forgave me so I'm going to forgive them like you forgave me when you forgave me Lord Jesus you didn't put my book of life just just in the archive to pull out when you want to because of something I'll do hallelujah amen don't we want to be sheep I want to see listen this is me this is I don't care where this goes I want to see isusa Street I want to see God come down and take over everyone's life and do what he wants to do are you going back to gifts praise God for gifts we have gifts and The Giver we've got we got the whole word I me but I want to I believe we can have it the word brother BR would be standing there zusa Street Jubilee saying the church has well fallen from that place are you just after the superal no I want to see God live I want to see the quotes live I want to see the scripture live I mean I want to see whatever God wants to do I want him to do it that he has complete right away in every life amen that's that's what I want to see Hallelujah who's with me so how do you brother says become sheep again you'll see Street meting is again to me stre is God took over everyone and did what he wanted to do sovereignly don't we want that in church that's right amen more than just an anointed Minister and the people trying to grasp it like brother B said the church got down to that no we are all anointed by the Holy Ghost that's how we should be right so we're all partaking spiritual worship amen we're all rejoicing in the spirit we're all singing in the spirit we're all praying in the spirit amen we're all walking in the spirit amen I'll just finish with this I kind of wrote down I love this brother Braham says you know if you want to be a saint act like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint believe like a saint die like a saint go to heaven like a saint that's what we want don't we amen if you want to be a saint be a saint don't be half a saint be a whole Saint be 100% Lord I believe your word I take you with your word make a living my life kind of a person amen that's what I want to be amen because I have this opportunity to see the to see him live we I'm so excited we are living in the most grandest of Ages that's right the most grandest of times right praise the Lord this could be the last service we ever have that's fine Glory Hallelujah we can be in glory before we wake up tomorrow I mean because the Lord said to you know one will be in the bed one will be working right it's a universal Rapture so we can be snoring in our beds we and we wake up in Glory Hallelujah and he say I'm not pinching myself this is not a dream Hallelujah you think I'm mad hey I'm happy this way for someone according to that scripture now I'm not joking but think about it Jesus said two will be in the bed one will be taken one will be left two will be in the field one will be taken one will be left two will be at the Mill one will be taken one will be left right so that means there's going to be someone asleep who will wake up in glory and they didn't die their body was changed Lord I'd like to fulfill that that's pretty neat Hallelujah so don't be weary and wello amen it'll all pay off it pays off even now why we have overcoming power we have a love that passes all the peace of God that passes all understanding we have the love of God shable in our hearts and have joy unspeakable full of glory and mean we have a hope you know
