[29:09] tense because you're preaching the word
[29:10] of God you know and it's a Eternal thing
[29:12] we're dealing with here we're not just
[29:13] dealing with thoughts of man but we're
[29:15] dealing with the word of God and lives

[29:28] preaching of the word and the atmosphere
[29:30] of the Holy Ghost amen let's just turn
[29:33] to James
[29:39] 1:25 and we'll also turn to Leviticus
[29:45] 16 this scripture just makes me blessed
[29:48] you
[29:49] know and the sermon is called
[29:52] discovering your Jubilee Hallelujah
[29:56] discover your Jubilee amen amen and I

[30:01] discover things that we've never seen
[30:03] before amen amen
[30:06] hallelujah hallelujah so it says but
[30:08] whoo lookth into the perfect law of
[30:11] Liberty and continueth therein he being
[30:14] not a forgetful hearer hearer but a doer
[30:17] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[30:19] his
[30:20] deed and then we'll just turn to
[30:22] Leviticus
[30:26] 16:29
[30:28] to give us a context and a bit of the
[30:32] history of this
[30:37] Jubilee and this shall be a statute
[30:39] forever unto you that in the seventh
[30:42] month on the 10th day of the month all
[30:45] of you shall afflict your souls and do
[30:47] no more work at all amen amen hallelujah
[30:51] you should have found
[30:52] rest whether it be one out of one of
[30:56] your own country
[30:58] whether it be one of your own country or
[31:00] a stranger that sojs among you for on
[31:03] that day shall the priest make an
[31:04] atonement for you to cleanse you that
[31:07] all of you may be clean from all your
[31:09] sins before the Lord it shall be a
[31:12] Sabbath of rest unto you all of you
[31:14] shall afflict your souls by a statute
[31:18] forever and then we're just going to
[31:20] turn you can have your seats and I'll
[31:22] just keep reading now I'm going to turn
[31:23] to Leviticus 25 but you don't have to
[31:25] turn there unless you want to and and
[31:27] thou shalt number the seven sabbaths of
[31:29] years unto thee seven times seven years
[31:32] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[31:36] years shall be unto thee 4 and9
[31:39] years then shalt thou cause the trumpet
[31:41] of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[31:44] of the seventh month has anyone been
[31:47] have you notice that it says
[31:50] 107 there's a there similarities in the
[31:53] the NuMe numerology of the Bible amen
[31:57] there that that that's talking about
[31:59] something special there amen why he puts
[32:02] that on the 10th day of the seventh
[32:04] month amen hallelujah Revelation 10
[32:09] chapter 7 AM amen now Revelation 10 chap
[32:14] 7 just so that we can catch the context
[32:17] here Revelation
[32:25] 10:7 10 verse 7 Revelation
[32:29] 10:7
[32:30] sorry um so so the context we have here
[32:35] brother brandom's Ministry the the voice
[32:38] that was sounding to declare the
[32:40] mysteries of God was to restore the
[32:43] original Jubilee to bring it back into
[32:47] effect he didn't bring another Jubilee
[32:50] because the original Jubilee happened
[32:52] when Jesus Christ stepped on the scene
[32:54] and and began to fulfill the scripture
[32:57] and began to be the answer to the many
[33:00] scriptures of the Old Testament to
[33:01] fulfill that he would come to set the
[33:03] captives free and he came to heal the
[33:05] brokenhearted and he came to loose the
[33:08] chains and to loose everything that BS
[33:11] met
[33:12] Hallelujah he came to do that and then
[33:15] Satan managed with the slimy hands to
[33:17] come and cl out it all over again until
[33:20] finally the church endered up in a dark
[33:21] age and the truth got crushed down under
[33:24] the
[33:24] ground and then finally it got the Lord
[33:27] said I'll restore and then and then then
[33:31] the a jubilee trumpet could sound
[33:34] again when the Lord called a prophet and
[33:38] he raised him up and he gave him the
[33:40] pure word of God again so that the
[33:43] Jubilee could sound again and man could
[33:46] become completely free from sin
[33:50] completely free with no other things
[33:52] against him with nothing against his
[33:55] character nothing against his name
[33:57] nothing against
[33:59] anything completely free because a
[34:01] gospel trumpet could sound with it's a
[34:03] certain sound again brother Brandon
[34:06] preached uncertain
[34:07] sound a few times and it's quite a great
[34:11] deep meaning that really if the trumpet
[34:15] gives an uncertain sound who can prepare
[34:17] himself to battle but now he's saying in
[34:19] these sermons now cuz he you know
[34:22] brother brandom and and and and it's
[34:24] normal that he doesn't want to outright
[34:26] declare exactly what's happening without
[34:29] sounding proud or putting people off but
[34:31] he's declaring that there's a certain
[34:33] sound a certain trumpet that's sounding
[34:36] that's going to set the people free amen
[34:38] hallelujah so we'll just keep reading
[34:41] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[34:42] years unto thee 7times s years and the
[34:45] space of the seven sabbaths of years
[34:47] shall be unto thee 40 and9 years then
[34:49] Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
[34:51] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[34:53] seventh month in the day of atonement
[34:56] shall ye make the trumpet sound
[34:58] throughout all your land hallelujah amen
[35:02] amen so here is the uh on the 10th day
[35:05] of the seventh month I'm probably going
[35:07] to mix words up because there's a lot of
[35:09] that sort of wording but on the 10th day
[35:11] of the seventh month here comes a priest
[35:15] the high priest and he goes in behind
[35:17] the veil and he does and he puts the
[35:20] blood on the mercy seat and he sprinkles
[35:22] it on the mercy seat and he sprinkles it
[35:24] on the altar of incense and he sprinkles
[35:26] it back on the mercy seat seven times
[35:28] for seven Church ages there was blood
[35:31] upon The Mercy Seat but then after he
[35:35] sprinkled it seven times for seven
[35:37] Church ages he the high priest himself
[35:40] now comes back out cuz God's accepted
[35:43] the blood now he comes back out from
[35:46] behind the veil and now the Jubilee
[35:49] trumpet can sound now that's a great
[35:51] thing and I'm trust you're catching that
[35:55] that here an aent generation now as an
[35:59] antitype of what happened in the Old
[36:01] Testament is for seven Church ages the
[36:06] high priest was behind that Veil that
[36:09] man had covered up with Traditions again
[36:12] cuz the Old Testament the high priest or
[36:15] the the the sh was behind a veil the
[36:18] presence of God behind a veil that no
[36:20] man could approach and then Here Comes
[36:23] The Mercy Seat Jesus Christ in plain
[36:25] view to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[36:28] heal the people's hearts to to heal the
[36:31] breach in humanity and to bring people
[36:34] into connection with God so that they
[36:36] could be free here he is hanging and
[36:38] then when finally it was accepted and
[36:40] the veil rent and they realized that
[36:42] there was nothing in that Old Testament
[36:45] sacrificial system anymore because that
[36:47] Ark wasn't even in there but it opened
[36:50] and here he was and hanging in plain
[36:52] view to say here I am I'm the great high
[36:55] priest I'm I'm going to set the people
[36:57] free I'm going to cause a jubilee and he
[37:01] shouted Hallelujah he shouted while he
[37:04] was on the cross and and and and and
[37:06] great things happened when he shouted
[37:08] that second time Hallelujah do you know
[37:10] what happened when he
[37:12] shouted there was a shaking happening
[37:14] hallelujah amen and and death started to
[37:17] give way amen the the grave started
[37:20] opening Hallelujah he shouted man a
[37:23] jubilee trumpet started sounding already
[37:26] while before he had even gone down
[37:27] Hallelujah and they started opening up
[37:30] the grave started opening up and then
[37:32] when he went down and he took the keys
[37:34] of hell and death and then he came back
[37:35] up and because those graves are open the
[37:38] Saints came out and they had their
[37:39] Jubilee amen hallelujah what a jubilee
[37:43] they had but yet as we talked about just
[37:46] earlier Satan started to bind over the
[37:49] power of that shout the power of that
[37:51] Jubilee the power of that gospel trumpet
[37:54] Satan started to use and get into the
[37:56] church and starts to fiddle around and
[37:59] and cause all this stuff to come over
[38:00] the church and bring them down make them
[38:02] lose their first love and Fall Away into
[38:05] into all sorts of slavery
[38:07] again and then finally in the end
[38:11] Hallelujah after the blood had been to
[38:14] to atone seven times on that Altar and
[38:17] the high priest had been behind that
[38:19] Veil because Satan closed them off again
[38:21] then finally because of the result of
[38:23] Revelation 10:7 an atonement meaning cuz
[38:27] the word atonement we always as we
[38:29] always think the atonement is the is
[38:31] Jesus on Calvary the atonement is the
[38:34] result of Jesus on Calvary because the
[38:36] word atonement means to be at
[38:39] Oneness and Calvary brought people to
[38:42] become one with God Amen but when Satan
[38:45] clouds it all over this the the approach
[38:47] has been tainted the approach to God has
[38:50] been broken and so now he's sort of
[38:52] pushed back again from the church that's
[38:54] why in Luther's time there he blinked at
[38:57] much ignorance in Wesley's time he
[38:59] blinked at much ignorance CU they had
[39:02] Babylonian ISM and Catholicism and and
[39:05] darkness all over them still they
[39:07] couldn't really connect properly they
[39:10] couldn't have a real true
[39:12] Jubilee especially as the generations
[39:14] after went on because they
[39:19] were clouded over with all sorts of
[39:21] different things but finally right now
[39:25] as a Revelation chapter 10: 7 a prophet
[39:28] comes on the scene and starts sounding
[39:30] that certain trumpet again and he starts
[39:32] sounding that
[39:33] Jubilee why because a high priest
[39:37] Revelation 101 the great descended
[39:41] Mighty Angel the high priest himself
[39:43] Jesus Christ stepped out and he tore the
[39:47] veil of man's Traditions tore up that
[39:50] man had covered over when he tore it and
[39:52] he stepped out the the priest would we
[39:56] can say brother brandham saw him and he
[39:59] started speaking with an open book and
[40:01] he sounded the Jubilee trumpet and then
[40:04] he took it around the world let it be
[40:06] heard throughout all your
[40:08] land amen you know in Revelation chapter
[40:12] 5 John when he saw the seals was open he
[40:17] said everything in Earth and Heaven and
[40:19] under the Earth heard me shout Rejoice
[40:21] heard me shouting rejoicing Hallelujah
[40:24] CU it was an exciting thing
[40:26] that now after years of man's religion
[40:29] and all sorts of falsities and and and a
[40:33] powerless Godless thing
[40:36] finally God could step forth and sound a
[40:39] true trumpet of Jubilee now we're under
[40:41] that sounding amen we are under the
[40:43] sounding of that trumpet that's giving
[40:45] you a certain sound that's telling you
[40:48] this is what the bridegroom this is what
[40:51] the the the king likes this is how the
[40:54] king wants you to dress
[40:57] you know spiritually I'm not just
[40:58] meaning physical I'm talking about a
[41:00] spiritual dress
[41:04] hallelujah
[41:06] amen we could take that back to the Book
[41:08] of
[41:10] Esther I'll just touch on it I won't go
[41:13] into it too much but just to see it and
[41:16] I think it's so good to be able to go
[41:17] back into the Old Testament stories to
[41:19] see you see now here is the same picture
[41:23] that I'm just portraying here was shown
[41:25] in the book of
[41:26] Esther here is the king and he's this
[41:31] King the great king of the all the land
[41:33] a hezus and now he types our bridegroom
[41:37] and here he is and now there's three
[41:40] pools in this king's Ministry this
[41:42] king's going to make three pools upon
[41:45] his kingdom cuz he's trying to find a
[41:47] bride Hallelujah but first he's got one
[41:50] that's already existing and so he makes
[41:52] a pool and there's this great big
[41:55] Gathering
[41:56] everybody's there F's there but she's in
[42:00] another little thing of her own you know
[42:02] she's decided she she's not really the
[42:04] relationship's been broken a little bit
[42:06] she's doing her own thing with the with
[42:08] their other churches the other
[42:10] ladies amen and and and the King now
[42:13] goes to pull for her and she refuses she
[42:16] doesn't want to come to the king she
[42:18] doesn't want to hear the king's message
[42:20] she doesn't want to hear the call of the
[42:22] king Hallelujah so now the King has a p
[42:26] and he pulls the virgins
[42:29] in and he pulls them in from all the
[42:33] land and he gives them his word his
[42:36] Bible he gives them everything that the
[42:39] Babylonian Kingdom could offer and now
[42:42] they get assigned to their chamberling
[42:44] Chambers and they get assigned to their
[42:48] place that they all
[42:50] dwell and now they've given a year to
[42:53] prepare themselves but one Hallelujah
[42:57] just one somehow she catches a
[43:01] revelation that that that she needs to
[43:04] listen to this human
[43:06] instrument somehow she knows there's
[43:09] something deeps down inside her and she
[43:11] understands or she knows that what that
[43:14] man that human messenger has to say is
[43:17] going to give make me a reflection of
[43:19] the king somehow she knew deep down the
[43:23] faith of the Son of God inside her
[43:25] stting to s
[43:27] and she knew now if whatever this man
[43:31] says I'm going to clothe myself in that
[43:33] I'm going to wear that I'm going to walk
[43:35] like that I'm going to practice my step
[43:37] and I'm going to practice my smile just
[43:38] how he is so she submits herself to the
[43:42] human leader the human instrument that
[43:44] that the King was using to to find
[43:47] himself to look after those that are
[43:50] meant to be the bride the coming bride
[43:54] now here's these other virgins these
[43:56] other churches you could say that now
[43:59] they have access to the very same King's
[44:02] Bible his word has Treasures his
[44:05] perfumes his his his doctrines his
[44:08] religions his everything that's right
[44:10] they have access all of them but one
[44:12] finds the
[44:14] channel where the king's heart can be
[44:17] expressed where the certain Jubilee
[44:20] trumpet sounding forth out of the man's
[44:23] mouth
[44:25] he the king's
[44:27] Chamberlain it's a beautiful picture so
[44:30] finally now comes the time where they
[44:32] present themselves and they start going
[44:35] past the king and there's always just a
[44:36] slight little easement against that
[44:39] person and there's a something against
[44:41] them there's something different then
[44:43] finally this one Esther walks past and
[44:46] he sees the reflection of himself he
[44:49] sees the one that that that's part of
[44:52] him she's walking like the way that's
[44:54] inside of him she is the feminine
[44:56] reflection of the king and he can't but
[44:59] help but take it to himself Hallelujah
[45:02] because she heard now she received a
[45:05] jubilee from being a orphan slave girl
[45:09] Hallelujah and she came into the
[45:11] presence of the king to become a nation
[45:13] changing Nation saving
[45:17] person because she heard the Jubilee
[45:20] trumpet sound out of the mouth of a
[45:22] human instrument now this is that's the
[45:25] there's a key into that amen that it's
[45:28] important it says that if you believe
[45:30] your Prophets You shall
[45:33] prosper there's a scripture it's in
[45:35] Chronicles I think somewhere in Kings of
[45:37] Chronicles believe your Prophet believe
[45:40] the prophet and you shall prosper amen
[45:42] you shall hear a certain sound it might
[45:44] be different from every other sound
[45:46] around but it's a certain sound it's a
[45:48] trumpet sound Hallelujah that God's
[45:50] going to set a people free and raise
[45:52] them up into a jubilee and bring them
[45:54] into the king's Palace to become one
[45:57] amen
[46:02] hallelujah Leviticus 25
[46:04] 29-31 I might just keep this tame as a
[46:08] Bible
[46:09] study I mean it won't go too long you
[46:11] know you can just keep it here and if a
[46:15] man sell a dwelling house in a walled
[46:17] City that he then he may redeem it
[46:19] within a year after it is sold within a
[46:22] full year may he redeem it and if it be
[46:25] not redeemed within the space of a full
[46:27] year then the house that is in the
[46:29] walled City shall be established forever
[46:32] to him that bought it throughout his
[46:34] Generations it shall not go out in the
[46:36] Jubilee but the houses of The Villages
[46:39] which have no wall around about them
[46:41] shall be counted as the fields of the
[46:43] country they may be redeemed and they
[46:46] shall go out in the Jubilee be careful
[46:49] that you don't put walls up around you
[46:52] because if you don't want to miss out
[46:56] amen you want to just lay your life down
[47:00] lay it down let nothing hold you back
[47:04] you just just lay everything down at the
[47:06] king's feet you've heard the Chamberlain
[47:09] you've heard the Jubilee you
[47:11] believe the certain sound you are
[47:14] hearing the trumpet sound hallelujah
[47:16] amen you're hearing it you're in it
[47:18] you're walking in it but be careful that
[47:21] you don't put walls up and if there's
[47:24] any walls in your life amen God's got a
[47:27] good wrecking ball amen he can break
[47:29] those walls down hallelujah amen and
[47:33] tear them all down and then you start
[47:35] feeling funny about a certain situation
[47:37] and you can feel it that it's causing a
[47:39] break or a breach and your relationship
[47:42] with God or with the people of God or
[47:44] somebody just lay it down to the Lord
[47:48] lay it down don't don't don't risk being
[47:51] caught up don't leave it too
[47:54] long be sure to walk out when the
[47:57] Jubilee is sounding don't fall
[48:00] around don't wait don't waste your time
[48:04] do it now and you men here this is a
[48:07] quote from the choosing of a bride and
[48:10] you men here of your denominational
[48:12] churches just believe this that the hour
[48:15] is right on you where you're going to
[48:17] make a choice you're either going to go
[48:19] into the World Council or you're going
[48:21] to be a denomination you're not going to
[48:23] be a denomination anymore you're going
[48:25] to have to do that and that choice is
[48:28] coming soon and it is a dangerous thing
[48:30] to wait till that last hour too because
[48:33] you might take on something that you
[48:35] could never shake out of it you know
[48:38] there is a time when you can be warned
[48:41] then if you step across that line of
[48:42] warning then you're already marked on
[48:45] the other side branded remember when the
[48:48] Jubilee year come and the priest rode it
[48:50] with his trumpet sounding that every
[48:53] slave could go free but if they refused
[48:56] to accept their freedom then he had to
[48:58] be taken to the temple to a post and an
[49:01] O bore him through the air and then he
[49:03] served his master always it was put on
[49:07] his ear as a type of hearing Faith
[49:10] cometh by hearing he heard the trumpet
[49:13] but he didn't want to listen to it and
[49:16] many time men and wom hear God's truth
[49:20] and see it Vindicated and proven truth
[49:23] but yet they don't want to hear
[49:26] there's some other reason there's some
[49:29] other choosing that they have then than
[49:31] to face up to truth and facts therefore
[49:34] their ears can be closed to the gospel
[49:37] they'll never hear it again my advice to
[49:40] you when God speaks to your heart you
[49:44] act right then don't hold anything back
[49:48] the moment he speaks lay it down be a
[49:51] sincere believer be transparent don't
[49:55] hold anything in or be hiding stuff you
[49:59] just find the right biblical channel to
[50:02] release it do it the right way be sound
[50:06] amen amen
[50:09] hallelujah lay it all down again
[50:15] amen
[50:17] so I'm going to go through some personal
[50:20] stuff not my personal but our personal
[50:22] you know like practical I like practical
[50:25] likes practical amen stuff that's
[50:28] applicable for our own walk two
[50:33] Corinthians 10 3-6 says these are
[50:36] practical messages measures of the
[50:38] Jubilee life for though we walk in the
[50:41] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[50:45] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[50:46] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[50:49] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[50:51] imaginations and every High thing that
[50:53] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[50:55] God and bringing into captivity every
[50:59] thought to The Obedience of Christ and
[51:02] having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[51:05] Disobedience when your obedience is
[51:09] fulfilled
[51:11] amen that sounds like a really big task
[51:16] but actually it becomes an
[51:18] autonomous action as a Christian as
[51:21] someone that actually cares about what
[51:23] they're thinking someone that really
[51:25] realizes that there's two things going
[51:27] on up
[51:29] here a
[51:31] battle and then as you hear the word and
[51:33] you start to eat the word and you start
[51:35] to hear that certain sound that's your
[51:37] Jubilee because now you have a
[51:39] discernment what do that doing that
[51:42] jubilees trumpet sounding for you is
[51:45] actually sing into your life to
[51:48] calibrate your thinking to help you to
[51:51] understand what is true and what is
[51:53] false now it's not intellectual Affair
[51:56] though it is something that's in your
[51:58] mind as well but really it's coming into
[52:01] your soul now and it's actually feeding
[52:04] your soul and it's bringing your soul
[52:06] into
[52:07] Dominion to give you dominion over this
[52:11] flesh because this flesh will always
[52:14] love sin this flesh will always enjoy
[52:17] seeing fleshly things and and and and
[52:21] things that Satan has put in the world
[52:23] to distract men and women this flesh
[52:26] will always like that if you let it go
[52:29] off rampant it'll get worse and worse
[52:30] and worse until finally the flesh will
[52:32] raise up and will cause a Revolt in your
[52:34] life and cast your soul down under your
[52:36] feet again and you'll be trampled over
[52:38] by your own
[52:40] flesh but the word the certain trumpet
[52:44] that You' have heard has got the very
[52:46] spirit of God in every thought every
[52:49] concept that this message has come to
[52:51] preach to
[52:52] you every thought has been has got the
[52:56] restored very spirit of God behind it to
[52:58] back it up to give the devil a good
[53:02] smack Amen to raise your soul into its
[53:06] position to feed you to give you
[53:08] strength amen from day to day the blood
[53:11] shall never lose its power why because
[53:14] the blood is the life in the blood now
[53:17] the physical chemistry spilled on the
[53:19] earth and washed away 2,000 years ago
[53:22] but the life that was in that blood SP
[53:25] speaks better things than that of Abel
[53:27] it speaks a voice of Resurrection that
[53:29] will come right in to your very life and
[53:32] it will place a finger of judgment now
[53:35] right on the very sin right on the very
[53:38] cause of the sin in your life right on
[53:40] the very thing that's troubling you and
[53:42] it will put his finger right on it we're
[53:45] going to read about it and I just love
[53:47] that because Isaiah 61 we're going to
[53:51] read about that this day the scripture
[53:53] is fulfilled when Jesus came and he sat
[53:55] down and the anointing was so great
[53:57] brother Bram said and you know sometimes
[53:59] when we just get that anointing we just
[54:01] blow off the Steam and we just get
[54:03] stimulated you know amen hallelujah but
[54:06] you know as you I think as as as it
[54:08] becomes more and more in your life you
[54:10] know you you can control it sometimes
[54:12] you need to just sit down and and wait
[54:14] on the Lord to say something and it can
[54:16] be and and Channel all that great energy
[54:19] of God into a word for somebody or
[54:21] whatever it may be but there's a he just
[54:23] says this day the scriptures fulfilled
[54:26] you know and apparently it was just
[54:27] brother Brandon said that it was just
[54:29] like silent he said but under that great
[54:32] anointing because of great scriptures
[54:33] being fulfilled and here he is declaring
[54:36] it on the earth the fullness of the word
[54:38] declaring the Fulfillment of scripture
[54:41] and he says I've come I'll read
[54:45] that I think it's wonderful says the
[54:48] spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[54:50] because the Lord has anointed me to
[54:52] preach Good Tidings unto the meek and he
[54:55] has sent me to bind up the
[54:58] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[55:00] captives Hallelujah and the opening of
[55:04] the prison to them that abound
[55:06] Hallelujah not I'll open the
[55:10] prison somewhere down the track he's
[55:12] going to open it forever there is no
[55:15] prison door there is no shackle or fet
[55:20] that hasn't been loosed or opened or
[55:22] broken Every Chain has been broken AMJ
[55:25] amen amen it's all been broken amen we
[55:29] have to walk out of that
[55:31] hallelujah amen now now now here I'll
[55:35] just keep reading to them that are bound
[55:38] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[55:40] Lord then he closed the
[55:42] book and then there's a 2,000 year
[55:46] breach between the next part as it just
[55:52] reads but the Jubilee was a was
[55:55] established then cuz here comes Jesus in
[55:57] his ministry and here he comes to
[56:00] fulfill the Jubilee scripture and to pay
[56:03] for it all and to bring man back into
[56:06] Oneness with
[56:07] God and then Satan clouds it all over as
[56:11] we spoke about before and he causes the
[56:13] church to go down into a Dark Age
[56:15] clouding it all over making it all just
[56:18] so far away and pushing God as a carrot
[56:20] on the end of a stick that you can
[56:22] hardly find what is he trying to do
[56:25] he's trying to what has he done he's
[56:28] broken down the
[56:29] altar he's broken down the altar which
[56:33] has been preached yesterday last week is
[56:36] our approach to God it's our approach
[56:38] our our way to worship God The Altar and
[56:41] there's an altar that that that that
[56:44] that has been that needs to be
[56:47] restored Hallelujah and and and the
[56:51] altar gets restored under the spirit of
[56:53] Elijah the spirit of Elijah was sent in
[56:55] the end time to build that altar up
[56:58] again so that man could approach God
[57:00] again amen
[57:04] hallelujah
[57:06] so I'll just throw this in here and you
[57:09] can just research it yourselves because
[57:10] it's quite it's quite an interesting
[57:11] thought Revelation 8 when the seventh
[57:14] seal opened and there was silence in
[57:16] heaven and then straight after the
[57:18] seventh seals open right here comes
[57:21] these angels and seraphim and they fill
[57:23] up the fire from the altar you know and
[57:27] and and and and the prayers of saints
[57:29] and they pour incense and the prayers of
[57:31] saints go up and becomes an incense
[57:34] before the Lord something's been
[57:36] restored something's been built back up
[57:38] again so that the prayers and the and
[57:41] all of these things can actually
[57:42] approach God again and then he goes Voom
[57:46] and sends fire down to the Earth and
[57:48] Thunders and Lightnings and earthquakes
[57:51] and starts to shake the Earth again and
[57:53] a great Revival
[57:56] Hallelujah I'll leave you with that it's
[57:58] a deep thought but just read it and just
[58:00] ponder over it and meditate on it what's
[58:03] been restored He restored the approach
[58:05] to God the altar was restored man's
[58:09] approach to God was restored
[58:11] again Hallelujah now when that reproach
[58:15] gets restored now he can now because of
[58:18] that oness because you see there is a
[58:20] benefit of being one with God there's a
[58:23] benefit of a restored
[58:25] there's a benefit of hearing the trumpet
[58:27] am and that benefit is your Jubilee am
[58:30] that benefit is a a complete freedom and
[58:33] a complete revelation of who you are and
[58:37] a discernment to discern every
[58:39] Antichrist spirit in your midst so that
[58:41] you and me can Reign above all of it and
[58:46] become an invincible Army a church that
[58:49] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[58:51] amen hallelujah a church that can
[58:54] discern turn every thought can cast down
[58:57] every imagination that's of the devil
[59:00] amen amen that's right and not dwell on
[59:02] anything that's going to cause a breach
[59:04] in the body because now you've been
[59:07] raised to a special anointing a special
[59:09] calling to walk in love now to walk in
[59:13] love the devil's going to fight Us in
[59:15] every area and he's going to try and
[59:18] crush us down and he's going to parade
[59:20] woman in front of the men and he's going
[59:21] to put all sorts of opportunities for
[59:24] sin
[59:25] his objective is to fill your flesh and
[59:28] your spirit that unconverted part of you
[59:32] to fill it with all those things of the
[59:34] Earth again and Youthful lusts and and
[59:37] pride of life and and busyness and all
[59:40] these things he wants to crowd it all
[59:41] over cuz he wants that Soul which is
[59:43] meant to be up and Dominion in your life
[59:46] he wants to push it down and get that
[59:47] flesh back rolling
[59:49] you but you've heard a trumpet sound
[59:53] Hallelujah a jubilee trumpet that's
[59:55] actually placing your back in its
[59:57] position Hallelujah so that you can have
[1:00:00] dominion in your own life and you're not
[1:00:03] on your own I'll drop this in here right
[1:00:06] now it was coming later but we'll drop
[1:00:08] it now Hallelujah the Lord himself shall
[1:00:12] descend with a shout make it personal
[1:00:15] don't just think he's off on some beach
[1:00:17] over in Rome and somewhere in America on
[1:00:20] the land over there he's come to you
[1:00:23] amen because you were born with a
[1:00:24] Babylonian Spirit that's right you were
[1:00:27] born with that sinful nature and that
[1:00:29] spirit that loves Hollywood you were
[1:00:32] born with it but what does he do
[1:00:34] hallelujah what does he do Hallelujah he
[1:00:37] comes down amen and what does he do he
[1:00:41] wants to bind Satan by circumstance amen
[1:00:46] amen hallelujah that's right he wants to
[1:00:48] bind them by
[1:00:50] circumstance in your life for you
[1:00:54] Hallelujah so see now through the spirit
[1:00:57] you shall mortify the Deeds of this body
[1:00:59] not because you've worked yourself up
[1:01:01] into some religious thing and praying
[1:01:03] all night and gone so hardcore but
[1:01:06] because this is the age where he himself
[1:01:09] would come down and set his feet upon
[1:01:12] the Water of your spirit and upon the
[1:01:14] Earth of your flesh and declare with an
[1:01:16] open book come and eat come and feast
[1:01:19] with me Hallelujah a personal Jesus
[1:01:21] Christ in your life amen to sub you the
[1:01:25] flow of your old nature and your flesh
[1:01:29] that wants to rule and he sets it down
[1:01:31] like Stone Hallelujah his feet as brass
[1:01:34] placing judgment upon the sin in your
[1:01:38] life amen placing
[1:01:40] judgment and this is this is what it
[1:01:42] reads now because you see now at the end
[1:01:46] because here brother brandom comes on
[1:01:47] the scene here sorry in Isaiah 61 he's
[1:01:50] come to preach the acceptable year of
[1:01:52] the Lord and to heal and bind up up and
[1:01:54] set free and then Satan covers it over
[1:01:57] again and then he sends Revelation 10:7
[1:01:59] on the day of atonement and he declares
[1:02:01] a certain sound and it it releases that
[1:02:03] Jubilee again it releases that freedom
[1:02:06] upon us again but now here comes the
[1:02:08] second part of this very
[1:02:10] chapter he's going to
[1:02:13] now the day of Vengeance of our God I'll
[1:02:16] read it to comfort all that
[1:02:19] mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in
[1:02:22] Zion hello Zion amen hallelujah amen
[1:02:26] what is he going to do Hallelujah the
[1:02:28] day of Vengeance about God is going to
[1:02:30] take Vengeance on you
[1:02:32] first not on you but on your old nature
[1:02:35] on the sin in your life on the on the
[1:02:37] devils and on all those complexes and on
[1:02:39] all the things that have held you back
[1:02:41] all your life he's come with vengeance
[1:02:43] Amen to take Vengeance on all those
[1:02:46] things to take Vengeance on every HTE
[1:02:49] and shite and iite and ivit and
[1:02:51] everything in your land and he's come to
[1:02:53] to take vengeance on them to place his
[1:02:55] finger in judgment and and and
[1:02:57] annihilate them get rid of them take
[1:02:59] them all away so that you can have
[1:03:01] freedom in your own land freedom in your
[1:03:03] own inheritance little by little he'll
[1:03:06] drive them all out little by little as
[1:03:08] you
[1:03:09] mature as you can handle the Liberty
[1:03:12] that comes with having
[1:03:14] Dominion because you have to have a
[1:03:16] maturity you can he's not just going to
[1:03:19] wipe everything out of your life and
[1:03:20] you're absolutely free ready for the
[1:03:22] Rapture straight away not that you're
[1:03:24] and experience you are ready for the
[1:03:26] Rapture as soon as you get filled with
[1:03:27] the Holy Ghost right but now God in his
[1:03:31] own desire is actually working on us day
[1:03:34] by day so that in our experience we'll
[1:03:38] be walking in the fullness of a Son of
[1:03:41] God except this body
[1:03:44] change and so we're growing in the
[1:03:46] stature of the perfect man Hallelujah
[1:03:50] every
[1:03:50] day but he won't we don't just get
[1:03:53] straight to that and our our own
[1:03:55] experience we have to go through things
[1:03:57] go through trials get
[1:03:59] character you know so that we can handle
[1:04:02] what the Jubilee has really come to give
[1:04:04] us hallelujah now I want to explain
[1:04:08] something
[1:04:09] here just to give us another
[1:04:11] understanding a good understanding of
[1:04:13] our
[1:04:15] condition our condition right now
[1:04:18] because we have be we're in the Jubilee
[1:04:20] right so we are in the Jubilee our soul
[1:04:23] has been placed in Dominion we have
[1:04:25] freedom from all these things and
[1:04:28] discernment and the thought life is
[1:04:29] becoming controlled because the Lord Has
[1:04:33] Come and descended into our life and
[1:04:35] he's taken and and the spirit has
[1:04:37] mortified the Deeds of this body you
[1:04:40] know and and because of that and because
[1:04:42] of this the anointing that we've
[1:04:44] received and we can walk into that
[1:04:45] freedom we can have that
[1:04:47] Jubilee the
[1:04:49] Lord yet that we're covered in this
[1:04:52] there there's still sin there's still
[1:04:54] this flesh there's still this old
[1:04:58] mind and the battle going on and
[1:05:01] sometimes you fail and sometimes you get
[1:05:03] angry and you speak the wrong thing you
[1:05:05] know there's still those factors and so
[1:05:08] to describe it how Satan is bound by
[1:05:12] circumstance
[1:05:14] because the Lord himself has come down
[1:05:19] and he set his feet
[1:05:21] upon your life
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:26] and I want to talk about to to
[1:05:29] understand this concept we need to just
[1:05:31] go off into the future a little bit into
[1:05:33] the time of the Millennium you see now
[1:05:35] in the time of the
[1:05:38] Millennium Satan has not been Anil
[1:05:40] neither is he in the Lake of
[1:05:44] Fire we're in our glorified state right
[1:05:48] we're ruling and reigning over normal
[1:05:50] people that fail that die that commit
[1:05:53] naughty do do bad behaviors but they're
[1:05:56] governed and sin is not rampant like it
[1:05:58] is now it's controlled why because at
[1:06:02] the end put your spiritual thinking caps
[1:06:05] on at the end right at the very end of
[1:06:09] the
[1:06:11] tribulation the son of David himself
[1:06:14] comes down upon the Earth boom and he
[1:06:17] sets his feet upon the Mount of Olives
[1:06:20] and and and that's a big graveyard and
[1:06:22] and this great earthquake happens in
[1:06:24] Jerusalem and it divides into four and
[1:06:27] he stands there and by the word
[1:06:28] hallelujah he takes control of the earth
[1:06:31] amen and bind Satan by
[1:06:34] circumstance Hallelujah Satan becomes
[1:06:37] powerless because the son of David is
[1:06:40] sitting on his throne and ruling with a
[1:06:42] rod of iron taking governance and taking
[1:06:45] his bride to govern with him so now why
[1:06:48] are you going through all this he's
[1:06:50] teaching you how to govern because you
[1:06:53] are in the the same condition now your
[1:06:57] body has you're you're you're not in you
[1:07:00] haven't got your new Earth yet you still
[1:07:03] got a your Earth has still got
[1:07:05] corruption in it but Satan is bound by
[1:07:08] circumstance because the Lord has done
[1:07:11] with you what he's going to do with the
[1:07:13] Earth in the Millennium he's doing with
[1:07:16] you now he's coming down himself setting
[1:07:19] feet upon the the Mount of Olives of
[1:07:21] your life Hallelujah am man breaking the
[1:07:25] old graveyard you know causing an
[1:07:27] earthquake in your life to shake off all
[1:07:30] those things that are that are that have
[1:07:32] troubled you Hallelujah CU a voice that
[1:07:34] spoke from Heaven said I'll will shake
[1:07:36] everything that can be shaken Hallelujah
[1:07:39] a voice that speaks better things than
[1:07:40] that of Abel read read Hebrews 12 go
[1:07:43] through it to shake off all those things
[1:07:47] and to place you in
[1:07:50] dominion and Satan Bound by circumstance
[1:07:54] now you yet you're in a jubilee and
[1:07:57] Satan's Bound by circumstance because
[1:07:58] the Lord has descended into your
[1:08:02] life that that's a description that's to
[1:08:06] understand that you are in a it's a
[1:08:09] jubilee but it's not the complete
[1:08:11] Jubilee yet it's not the complete
[1:08:14] fulfillment of the Jubilee just like the
[1:08:16] Earth for a thousand years in the
[1:08:18] Millennium Jesus the son of David has
[1:08:21] descended upon the Earth bound Satan by
[1:08:23] C and rules with a rod of iron and he
[1:08:26] has an a bride that travels by thought
[1:08:29] and governs the Earth sin can be
[1:08:31] controlled sin can be reckoned itself
[1:08:33] dead indeed and yet it's still lying
[1:08:36] dormant there still lying there waiting
[1:08:38] till the end of the thousand years it's
[1:08:40] going to come flying back up again and
[1:08:42] then finally Hallelujah right at the end
[1:08:46] then there's the big great battle of Gog
[1:08:48] and meog and and the Satan deceives the
[1:08:52] whole earth again you know all these
[1:08:54] unconverted people they turn on us and
[1:08:57] the Lord and our great
[1:08:59] mountain and they start to fire there
[1:09:02] whatever I don't know what they do but
[1:09:03] they throw their stones at us or
[1:09:05] something they're coming for us
[1:09:07] hallelujah and God just rains fire out
[1:09:10] of heaven and he completely annihilates
[1:09:13] it all and casts the devil into the Lake
[1:09:15] of Fire and then we come to the great
[1:09:17] white Throne
[1:09:19] judgment so the same thing is going to
[1:09:23] happen to us where we're going to put on
[1:09:26] immortality so right after the great
[1:09:29] white Throne judgment John says I see a
[1:09:31] new Heaven and a new Earth come down
[1:09:34] like a brighter Dawn for a groom
[1:09:37] Hallelujah the same for us here's our
[1:09:41] word body up in heaven hallelujah amen
[1:09:43] and and it's waiting Hallelujah waiting
[1:09:46] for us Eternal in the heaven and no
[1:09:48] beginning nor end part of God's word
[1:09:50] amen hallelujah right in this thinking
[1:09:52] from
[1:09:55] it's going to come down hallelujah it's
[1:09:57] going to come down one of these days
[1:09:58] hallelujah descend a new A New Earth for
[1:10:01] us and this old Earth is going to be
[1:10:04] taken away and our soul will raise up
[1:10:06] and become one with our glorified body
[1:10:08] Hallelujah and we'll receive our
[1:10:10] complete Jubilee from off this Earth
[1:10:13] hallelujah amen I'm just so thankful for
[1:10:16] that so you see now you are in a jubilee
[1:10:21] and yet you fail and yet you've got the
[1:10:25] sinful nature and a sinful body but
[1:10:27] you're being given a a special anointing
[1:10:29] and a special food to feed you out of an
[1:10:32] open book that the Lord Jesus himself
[1:10:34] holds in his hand says come and eat this
[1:10:36] and feast on me walk before me nurse
[1:10:39] from almighty God hallelujah be
[1:10:42] strengthened so that you can have can
[1:10:45] can stand fast in the Liberty Stand Fast
[1:10:48] in your Jubilee amen which Christ has
[1:10:50] made you free and be not entangled again
[1:10:52] in the Y of bondage
[1:10:54] but Stand Fast right there looking into
[1:10:57] the perfect law of
[1:10:59] Liberty understanding that it's a law
[1:11:01] that set you free and it's a law of God
[1:11:04] that was going to keep you it's the law
[1:11:06] of the spirit the law of the spirit
[1:11:10] Hallelujah that's going to mortify the
[1:11:12] Deeds of this body the law of the spirit
[1:11:15] your faith comes in connection with that
[1:11:17] law and you can see brother Brandon
[1:11:19] preached in the Restoration in the brid
[1:11:21] tree to enforce that restoration to
[1:11:23] enforce those things and you claim it
[1:11:25] back from the devil and the Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] will come behind you and and enforce
[1:11:29] that restoration Hallelujah when it's
[1:11:32] identified when you hear the Jubilee
[1:11:35] trumpet don't wait around that's right
[1:11:37] don't wait around act act upon
[1:11:41] it amen amen

[1:11:57] you may be a new lump as you are unle
[1:12:00] for even Christ Our Passover a sacrifice
[1:12:02] for us therefore let us keep the feast
[1:12:05] not with old leaven neither with the
[1:12:07] leaven of malice and wickedness but the
[1:12:09] unle bread of sincerity and Truth A
[1:12:13] little leaven leth the whole lump I have
[1:12:16] confidence in you through the Lord that
[1:12:18] you will be none otherwise minded but he
[1:12:20] that troubleth you shall bear his
[1:12:22] judgment whoever he be amen that's the
[1:12:26] enemy he's got he's he's he he traps you
[1:12:30] sometimes but then the god the Lord has
[1:12:34] put his finger straight on it and he
[1:12:36] will and he he's got a Vengeance he's
[1:12:38] going to take a vengeance upon that in
[1:12:40] your own life and cause those things to
[1:12:42] come away so that you can stay free amen
[1:12:45] amen but Feast on the bread of sincerity
[1:12:48] and
[1:12:49] truth hallelujah this I say then walk in
[1:12:53] the spirit

[1:12:56] flesh for the flesh lusteth against the
[1:12:58] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[1:13:00] and these are contrary one to the other
[1:13:02] so that you cannot do the things that
[1:13:04] you would but if you be led of the
[1:13:06] spirit you are not under the
[1:13:08] law for if you live after the flesh you
[1:13:11] shall die but if you through the spirit
[1:13:14] do mortify the Deeds of the body you
[1:13:17] shall live for as many as are led by the
[1:13:20] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:13:22] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:13:24] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:13:26] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:13:29] we cry Abba
[1:13:31] Father Hallelujah Stand Fast therefore

[1:16:03] wall because a gospel Jubilee trumpet
[1:16:06] sounded and they've heard it and it
[1:16:08] stripped them and the Lord has descended
[1:16:11] into their life Hallelujah to mortify
[1:16:15] the Deeds of this flesh so that they can
[1:16:17] raise up and be sincere and be true to
[1:16:20] who they really are in front of everyone

[1:16:52] nothing to hide because what you are is
[1:16:53] what people see amen the L the spirit of
[1:16:56] God is pleased with
[1:16:58] them I
[1:17:00] believe amen um you can Isaac come or
[1:17:04] just start singing hallelujah
[1:17:08] amen I want to read a quote
[1:17:11] here power without character is
[1:17:16] satanic I want to balance this Freedom
[1:17:19] this Liberty that we have says therefore
[1:17:21] Brethren ye have been called un to
[1:17:23] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:17:25] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[1:17:28] one another for all the law is fulfilled
[1:17:31] in one word even in this Thou shalt love
[1:17:34] thy neighbor as
[1:17:35] thyself then brother brandom says this
[1:17:38] in Hebrews chapter 6 he says now you say
[1:17:42] well brother Brandon then if I become a
[1:17:44] Christian I can just do anything I want
[1:17:46] to absolutely if you're a Christian do
[1:17:49] anything you want to and I'll guarantee
[1:17:52] you won't have any desire to do wrong
[1:17:55] you do anything I've always did just
[1:17:57] what I wanted to do and if I serve the
[1:17:59] Lord cuz I'm afraid of him going to hell
[1:18:01] I'm not serving him right if I live true
[1:18:03] to my wife because I'm afraid she'll
[1:18:05] divorce me I'm a very I'm not a very
[1:18:07] good husband but I wouldn't hurt her for
[1:18:10] nothing I for I love her that's how it
[1:18:13] is with Christ when a man is born of the
[1:18:16] spirit of God not because he shouted
[1:18:18] spok in tongues or some emotion but in
[1:18:20] his heart love come in
[1:18:23] and taken the place of the world I'll
[1:18:25] tell you he loves him he walks by him
[1:18:28] every day you don't have to tell him
[1:18:30] it's wrong to do this or that or the
[1:18:31] other he knows it's wrong and he walks
[1:18:34] he's an ordained product of God's
[1:18:36] Sovereign Grace
