to have brother ASA too God bless you bro great to have you buddy amen great to have you amen amen praise the Lord if you've got your Bibles handy we're just going to go read one port or two portions um of scripture from uh Hebrews chapter 2 and then we're going to go to Jeremiah 1 and4 uh here and then um amen amen you know it was um it was real foggy when we woke up this morning but hey doesn't matter how gloomy life is how stormy it is the sun is always shining am mean and Faith declares he is still there amen so Hebrews 2:9 but we see Jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he's not ashamed uh to call them Brethren saying I'll declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I'll put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God had hath given me and then Jeremiah probably very familiar piece of scripture here Jeremiah from verse 4 down to verse 9 says here and the word of the Lord came uh unto me saying behold I have formly in the belly I knew thee and before thou comest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for thou shall go to all that I send theee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver Thee sayith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning Remembered in prayer you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen gracious father we want to thank you we can come before your great presence this morning Lord we just come with reverence Lord Jesus humility but also great thanksgiv giving in our hearts Lord because you made a way where there was no way Lord we know that not one of us could free ourselves from the slavery and bondage and death sentence of sin but Lord you came down you came from the portals of glory Lord and Lord you redeemed us that day and Lord we can say the tomb is empty today and you're alive forever more and you said because I live you shall live also Lord we're so thankful for this Resurrection season we're alive in I just want to pray father you would take your words Lord and Lord as we've read them and may you bless them Lord Jes Jes and may you anoint speaker and hearer one more time lord we need you to take over every service Lord so may you take over this service may you have preeminence Lord may you be glorified Lord May every human Spirit be subject to you father may you have your way For Your Glory cover us in your blood Lord and may thy will be done Lord Jesus may you bless each one here and those who are streaming father those who are away be their portion Lord we commit Our Lives into your hands and ask these things in your name name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning I want to talk about identified sons and whose sons are you that's the question so when I speak about Sons this morning I speak about sons and daughters so you know it's not just half of us who are being talked to but a son son in the Bible represents a position amen of of of authority and power right so I want to talk about who whose son who whose child are you this morning you may say well I'm the Son and Daughter of so and so your natural parents but that's not what I'm talking about God wants to take away our identity from our natural family sure we have our natural name our names do not change we honor our father and mother you we appreciate our parents but that's not that should not be our real identity that must not be our real identity even to have your identity in a church is wrong amen it is wrong you must not have your identity in sh oh I go to shik Tabernacle that doesn't mean nothing to God just like brother R said people say I'm Methodist I'm Presbyterian I'm Baptist he says that's that that doesn't even mean a snap of a finger to God we must go beyond that identity am mean because that identity will not stand in time of trouble I mean it will not help you in time of trouble cuz there'll become a time when you can't reach me you can't reach a deacon you can't reach a sister or a brother or someone and you need to stand alone with God Amen you must stand alone Toe to Toe with the Enemy with God on your side that's how you must be remember this walk is an individual walk sure we're a body but it's individual first and foremost and if you are just just here because of a group you will get nothing amen but if you are here because God has called you and he saved you by his grace you have everything amen because we read there in the opening scripture that he bring many sons unto glory amen so he's not talking about church people he's not talking about just people but his children he will bring unto glory amen that's why he died on Calvary to redeem us Amen to taste death amen that we don't have to taste death you know that we would we would be made in His image to really really we would become who we meant to be in the first place you know the Bible says we don't I don't have it on my notes but it says that we will know as we are knowing so I'm not knowing in Heaven by my natural birth my natural lineage my you know I'm not known by those things in heaven I'm known because I'm a Son of God I mean that's how I'm known in glory and this the same thing with you and I you're not known in in heaven because your parents were this person you came from this country that's not you know God allowed those things cuz he wanted a certain character to come forth out of you he he ordained all those things but that's not your all in all right we are the sons and daughters of the most high God we're not here to to to just continue a natural family line though we do that we have children we get married all those things but that should not be our identity our identity must be in the word of God our identification must be in the word of God it must not be in our natural traits it must not be in our church it must not be in our natural lineage and these things all those things will fall apart right our our identification must be in the word of God yes sir and I think it's so incredible you think about Jeremiah here you know Jeremiah um he was called the weeping prophet you know he he had a real hard job oh my but God first and foremost had to tell him I'm not calling you just because of you what you think you are before you ever in your mother's womb I ordained you to be a prophet to the Nations Jeremiah Jeremiah you must realize that you're not here just because I picked you just cuz I picked you but I for ordained you for this role I for ordained you to fulfill this word because Jeremiah when I told Moses that he told the people of Israel in the book of Deuteronomy you would have read it many times Jeremiah that I set the law of life and death before the people and if they cleave to me they'll live but if they don't cleave to me and they cleave to other things they will die and be taken out of the land Jeremiah when I spoke those things through Moses you were on my mind because I knew the people could not keep my law I knew my people could never do it cuz they there was nothing that would ever come out of the law that could change them that the word could be fulfilled in their lives I knew they would fail and I knew this would happen so I knew that one day a prophet would come and bring Mercy before that judgment would come God always brings Mercy before judgment said Jeremiah you have to know you're going to be in a very difficult time you're going to see a lot of Destruction you're going to see people you love go to ruin you're going to see Jerusalem be burned you're going to see terrible things happen but Jeremiah you must know I've ordained you for this drug that you will not be tossed to and fro by political moves and different things within the church and things going on the nation the economic trouble and whatever's going on Jeremiah you must know you're above those things because your identification Jeremiah is in me it's not in your culture it's not in your natural people it's not in the synagogue it's not in Jerusalem but it's in me the word of God am me he had to know those things that's why God said before you're in the belly amen I knew thee wow and i s ify thee ordain thee to be a prophet unto the Nations amen and friends we don't become the Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth that's right the reason we are born again is because we are that says in Galatians because ye are Sons you receive the spirit of God where you cry Abba Father because because God had to just destroy the legalistic idea out of the galatian church that came in out of because of I keep this therefore I am no the word lives in you because you are we don't become Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth we are therefore we're born again am amen we receive the spirit because we are right so we got to realize that you we got to realize that we're not in this thing just because you know Christianity cannot be just something we tack to our life that's right you know we can't we can't go to church because it's just something we do if if our Christian walk is just because well it's a good idea to be a Christian it makes good people you know these got nice friends we have good times and you know that's not that's not an identification that God's looking for no we've got to realize that we are part of the word we are part of the word right we don't just adopt a faith no we didn't choose God God chose us there's a scene from The Chosen Jacob's digging a well they're talking to these other people and you know these people are telling them about their gods and what they do and you know Jacob tells them the story about how he wrestled with God will come to that later and he's limping and all these things and you know and then and then the people asking why did you choose this kind of God and Jacob said no we didn't choose him he chose us amen there's a big difference right but the thing is we have to come to a place where we realize that we we aren't Christians because we adopt the faith but we are Christians because we're part of him what we're part of this word it's it's so much different than saying well I'm just going to adopt a faith and it's something good to live by that's got nothing to do with it you actually totally missed the whole point right the reason the word comes your way is because you're part of that word you're part of the prophecy like like Jeremiah was part of Prophecy he was there to manifest Mercy before judgment was coming he was part of what Moses God spoke through Moses see he wasn't just a prophet I may be laboring this point a lot but I just I just pray it would anchor into our lives that that we can't just adopt Christianity amen we are part of the word God wants you to realize that you're part of this word that's why you're called to it am mean that it's not just a nice idea or just you know a good thing that you want to do but no see faith is not faith is we joining church is not enough right we are the people of the book The Bible amen we are part of it you know when you realize you're part of it you can't deny him when you realize you're part of the Lord you can't deny him it's impossible to to to recant or rig or go away some else or adopt a whole different kind of a faith because you realize you're part of him how can you re how can you deny Part of Yourself how can you deny who you really are you cannot amen it's impossible that's why the martyrs could go to the stake and be burned and feed the Lions and things those who recanted they were never part of it they were just part of the group they saw the benefits of it they were feeding off the blessings that the Believers received but those who are really part of it who really had the Revelation I'm part of him and he's part of me I one with the Lord Jesus Christ they could not recant it was impossible there was nothing in them that could do it and it wasn't because of sheer force of willpower or stubbornness it was just because they were part of the word and the Word was part of them amen and it's got to be the same thing with you and I we need to realize that we're part of this message and mean we're part of this word amen when we don't just adopt it as something we tack onto our lives but you have the Revelation that God is my father amen amen that that I am his son or daughter amen I am named after him amen that we're not building a natural life anymore but actually it's God's God's kingdom being expanded upon the Earth you know you know in the in the Old Testament the word son one of the definitions is it's the builder of the family name wow so who's whose name are you building today are you building your own name you say well I've got to have a career and look after my family and all those things that's all part of life but that's not what I'm talking about what name see people who build who build kingdoms within the message they haven't had the re ation that Jesus Christ is their father they might have Supernatural Miracle the supernatural's got nothing to do with if a person's a true seed or not bam had true prophecy Judas had a Supernatural Ministry that even when Jesus they're all gathered around the last supper table and Jesus said one of you is going to betray me they didn't say oh it's Judas they were they said who is it Lord they did not know that's how close he was to the truth but he didn't go to Pentecost he cast out Devils he healed the sick he had a Supernatural Ministry but yet yet he wasn't seed so that's why that's why people who build kingdoms within the message they actually don't have the Revelation God's their father because they're building their own kingdom they're building their own family name it can be a name of a church or a Ministry but they're still building their own family name amen but if you get the real Revelation that God is your father and he and and you're his son or daughter you're not interested in your name going forth you're not interested in building your Empire and having your you know influence among the people you want God's influence to on people you want God's kingdom to be expanded you want to build his name upon the Earth isn't that right amen this should be our ambition in life that God's name would be expanded that you know the the family name would be built that's how it's got to be amen so Jeremiah was going to go through some tough spots but he had to realize amen that this was the most fundamental thing God first told him I've ordained you before you even turned up you built for this job I've I have made you purpose built but see Jeremiah no doubt would have had to deal with his natural Humanity strug because he say I'm just a child I don't know how to speak and God's telling you I'm not calling you because of your abilities I'm not calling you because of what you think you are I'm calling you because of what I know you really are I mean that's why we've got to get the humanity out of the way and let God move and God wants to strip away our human identity am mean we know that you know the you know the uh no we won't go there yet but but we know that yeah yeah we'll go there brother Paul read this on Wednesday you see Moses no yeah we'll go here I I thought we're going somewhere else we'll go here sorry Moses had to have a revelation that he was called for the job the people of Israel had to leave their slave mentality they had 400 years of slavery that's an intergenerational trauma if we want to give it a psychological label of this day intergenerational trauma but God wanted to show them your past is your past I'm going to take it away amen you are never meant to be slaves in Egypt this is not who you really are sure they talked about great Jehovah God coming and delivering them one day but when he really came it really changed things because it really showed who had their identity in the Lord and who had their identity in their slave mentality because when they came out of Egypt and God did great super natural things you know they came you know first sign of trouble they said well let's just go back to Egypt let's go back to our slavehood at least we had safety there they were their their their boys were being murdered they were being used as slaves they had a horrible life but yet they wanted to go back to that because that was their identity but Caleb and Joshua said let's go take the land right now it's ours why because their identity was in the word of God the promis for their day amen so they weren't they had the same slave marks they had the you know the scars the beatings all those things but yet but yet their identity was not in where they came out of their identity is where they're going into amen and that identity was the promised word for that day amen so so so you see here we need to realize that God as I said last Sunday that God is putting a difference between you know the Israelites or the Believers and the Egyptians which is the blood being applied and it's fundamental that we have the blood applied to our homes right we don't just have our natural this is how we should be naturally know the blood must be applied to our homes that our home should be a place where God is welcome amen that that that that family altars amen and are not a strange thing you know brother brah speaks about he he speaks about home life if you just go I was going to say Google that term in the message but you go search that term he says home life is running out it's getting you know on shallow Waters the Bible's not it's being neglected people don't read it together and pray and all these different things things but you see that's a fundamental thing that first and foremost that that there is a family altar in the home and not just as a family but individually we need our time with God we need to we need to worship the one that we came from amen amen it's very important you know some people put too much pressure or emphasis on the church doing everything and sure we have Sunday school we have different programs and things but it's got to start at home church starts at home you see the problem is a nickan will always put a pressure on the church to do everything just like it went from the instead of a spiritual worship of all the people that Spirit took the anointing off the people and put it on a priesthood so now the priest does everything the church has got to do everything you know we we're not called to be that way amen we have an individual walk with God God should be speaking to us through the week yes amen amen you should be able to read the word it should be able to minister to You song should Minister you the message should be a to minister to you he speaks to your life he gives you stability he gives you Revelation as you're walking along this should not be our only point of Revelation right here amen amen amen this is all part of it but but this is not the all be all and end all you know no he's meant to be the inside teacher yes sure we have teachers in the fivefold ministry but he's meant to be the inside teacher first and foremost that that that the Holy Spirit should take the word and teach it to your heart amen anchor it in there praise the Lord so we have a a right to apply the blood Amen to our to our homes have a home life there but you see now Israel as as now this is speaking of Jesus coming out of Egypt but in Hosea and um I think it's Hosea 11:1 it speaks about um Jacob coming out of Egypt out of Egypt I have called my son and brother bam says there's compound meanings in scripture so so Israel was the son of God coming out of egyp Egypt as a group but then the greatest son Christ Jesus himself came out of Egypt as well so God saw Israel as his son this is my family this is my child this is my son amen but you see you see they had to they had to be willing to let go of their slave mentality they had to be willing to let go of their trauma they had to be willing to let go of those things and take God at his word to move on Amen from where they came out of we have to be willing to count all things but dung it doesn't matter how great it may be how how how acceptable to the world our past was we got to count it all but dung that we may win Christ that's the words of the Apostle Paul amen we cannot have any nice thoughts or feelings about our past amen that that means it's still attached to you if you have any good things you know thoughts about it's got to be all kind of but dong and so Israel had to come to a place where they did not think of their slave mentality or the leaks and GS of Egypt as a good thing oh I used to do this it was so good for me no it was death I mean they're living under a death sentence and God wanted to call them out of that place place them in their own land where they would be the head and not the tail I mean they would walk in Freedom they would know their God they would they would walk in their inheritance what God allotted for them they would possess amen and that's what God wants us to possess every Divine promise but first you've got to realize you're a son or daughter of God you must have that Revelation it's so important that you realize you come from God and go back to God because if you do not realize that you'll be tossed to and fro Spirit comes into the home you'll be tossed by it things come things happen in the world you'll be tossed by it it doesn't toss me what's happening in in Israel or the Ukraine the economic problems of the world nothing of that bothers me because he is Jehovah Gyra brother Brown preached the most sermons he preached was Jehovah Gyra and you've got to realize the Lord will provide and he never normally provides it upfront I'll tell you this a few years ago go okay leading up to Camp I thought humanly we cannot pay for this thing how on Earth are we going to pay for camp we are going to be in the red red red red two years ago I would have said we can't have camp this year cuz I would have been panicking this year I keep saying to Christine I know a guy he's Jehovah Gyra he will provide and he provided amen he provided it was impossible humanly but God provided how did he do it he's Jehovah Gyra but the thing thing is you've got to walk with God he doesn't unfold everything that's that's not a faith walk Abraham said leave the land I mean God told him leave the land he didn't say well he didn't say well where am I going God and what's going to happen God and no he just walked and as he was walking God unfolded it see and what happened God but you've got to believe that he's Jehovah Gyra I can't have that faith for you I'm believing for you but you've got to have that personal faith amen that when no one else is praying for you you can stand there on the rock of Revelation say you're Jehovah Gyra your word says I've never seen the righteous forsaken or them begging bread Hallelujah you've got to have that Revelation you say well it's easy to say it when I've been there I know what I'm talking about my you know but God provided does he still provide absolutely we must have confidence that he is God he is God he's the one who made your body he's the one who made the next breath you're about to inhale he's the one who made the food you're going to have for lunch he made the clothes on your back the car you drive you say well he didn't physically made it he made the material of it all amen he could just do this the world could tumble out into darkness it would be frozen in a moment if he wanted to he can do whatever he wants he's God we serve the Supreme one who created heavens and earth amen and we are his children by his grace we are his children we are his sons and daughters but I trust that God will give you a revelation of this service I come from him and I'm going back to him and no matter what happens in life God's allowed it to prove himself in that trial amen shadra mesak abedo and Daniel they were they were young people when they went into went into uh Babylon they were young people I don't know 14 15 around that age around there they weren't in their 20s they weren't old they weren't sit in their ways they were young people going through that change of life and maybe they're walking and maybe they just saw the destruction behind them I don't know but something in them said we're going to serve God Amen we're going to serve God sh at me sh you know we know their names would change to that but you know I don't know what they are right now and the Hebrew but you know they just said you know friends let's just serve God we're his children Abraham gave us this land and because of Disobedience because of you know our our four Bears turned to Idols all these things we've been kicked out but I believe we're going to come back we are Abraham's children you know what I love about serpent Seed doctrine it tells me I come from God Amen that's what I love about it because because Abel by Revelation knew it was the blood amen and all of God's children have a revelation it was the blood and they give themselves to the word of God in their season right C's line are religious but reject the blood why do they reject the blood because they reject the power of the Holy Ghost to change their lives that the word will put on flesh in them that's what they do amen so I love serpent seed it's not it's a positive cuz I realize if God moved on Abel and moved on all the Believers down Through the Ages amen and he's moved on my life the same way I realize if I if I track my lineage back there's a step from Adam to God hallelujah hallelujah glory amen that's right so so I like sery it gives me a lot of it gives me a lot of uh stability in my life because it actually shows me it's not him that willth or runneth but God that showeth Mercy amen says not yes I'm going to do it no it's just God's mercy why did you earn it did you deserve it did you Merit it no but I'm here hello I got called I realize I'm his son I realize I'm his child amen if I'm his child I can never be out of his care well what do you mean if the world's turned upside down you know the Apostle Paul had a very interesting Journey yeah you know he a very interesting life he would he would he would leave leave the Comforts of a Pharisee Bible School Seminary and and and he would trade it for a very rugged life a very Troublesome life he didn't have you know I've never heard a modern-day missionary report of someone being stoned you know being driven from City to City I haven't heard those kind of mission reports in this day and age doesn't mean it won't happen and doesn't mean there's not persecution and hardship but you know the Apostle Paul had a lot of trouble did it shake him no no did it phase him no he was chained to a you know it's amazing how we put circumstance we let circumstances be our God we let we let our current state be our God because and the and and I and I hate to say it but the problem is we forget that we're his children you see the Apostle Paul you know the Apostle Paul he was he was beaten he was Shipwrecked he was robbed he was in prison he was chained to a Roman soldier you know most of his Revelations he got he was chained to a Roman soldier he was this unbelieving guy he was chained to you think man there's no way God could talk to me in this place who's ever seen like Google the was it the mamine prison whatever he was in it ain't one of these underfloor heating three meals a day kind of places that we have in this country cold damp rat infested cockroach riddles you know they weren't nice to their prisoners they were nasty hey these things cost me money we're you we're you know they W you know cold dripping ceiling all kinds of stuff in the dark chain to a Roman soldier or a wall or whatever but in that state he got many books of the Bible why because his circumstances weren't his God see humanly every circumstance becomes someone's God if they're doing good they can run around the church and praise God and testify if everything's going bad they wonder why they're even here and what's the point and trying why because it's circumstance driven we aren't called to be driven by circumstance see Caleb when when the word came Caleb's way he said that land's mine yes God revealed it to me am I'm his child Joshua we're going in now we actually know Caleb was a gentile do you know that but because he took God at his word God put him gave him inheritance God gave him a City of Refuge Amen to have a dwelling place but you see Caleb wasn't n faced by the he was in the same sandstorms that the rest of Israel were in he was eating the same manner having the same trouble having the same problems but his circumstances didn't dictate to him his victory amen no his the only thing that dictated to him his victory was God has given me a promise God has given me an inheritance and I'm going to possess that land I don't know how old I'll be but I'm going to get there Hallelujah but that's mine it was revealed to him he wasn't hoping it was his he knew it was his and so there for the sand blew in Hallelujah this is not my final resting place am amen the Mana comes I don't know Strife maybe the whole neighborhood's just grumpy Avenue you know fussing fussing Avenue or something everyone's complaining about the sand and Moses and all these troubles and all these things and he opens his tent door says hallelujah I'm one day closer and maybe they think man this guy's a crazy man no he was the only one that had his mind because of it wasn't his circumstances that dictated to him how happy or sad he was it was the word of God revealed to him personally gave him the victory amen and it's the same thing with Paul he was you know he had all this trouble in his life he says None of these things move me why because he realized because before he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees so his identification was in his ability to learn the scripture but then when God met him on the road to Damascus his identification was in the pillar fire wasn't the one that gave the Old Testament that he studied and tried to further himself in so he realized I'm a Son of God hallelujah more than a son of Abraham I'm a Son of God Amen and so so therefore he could say none of these things move me and I I pray we can have the same kind of Revel I believe we can you know we can walk in this world and the world can fall apart but we can still be rejoicing we can walk in this world that even our own family ion turns against us but yet we can Rejoice amen because you got to realize there's many times you know Believers want to quit but they can't quit Jeremiah came to a spot where he says I'm not even going to talk anymore I've been rejected too much but then he said you know he says I'll not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name now this is discouragement this is more than having a bad day it's more than having a bad day at the office this is real discouragement but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones so it's like a bubbling stream it was within him he couldn't contain it he couldn't contain the word he couldn't contain God in his own life it had to come out even though his his Humanity wanted to put a stopper on the bottle amen there's so much pressure that thing just came out Hallelujah why cuz his word was in his heart as a burning fire shot up in his bones am mean see that this is how we should be I mean that when we gather on one another should be the Lord is so good his promises are real I me he's so good to us how is your week it was terrible naturally but spiritually he's awesome Amen he's in control of everything I've seen him be more faithful and true in my entire life right now that I have in my entire life because he's so good he proves himself over and over and over again and I can't believe that the Lord brought me through that trial I'm so thankful he's still alive he's so good amen why are you happy because I've met him amen that's right amen why can you rejoice in the midst of trouble because I know the god who's allowed the trouble I know the God who will bring me through the trouble amen and I was weary with forbearing so that's basically not speaking and I could not stay so because he tried to stop he got weary we got to let the goodness of God Out friends amen we should talk about his goodness amen but you see you see God knew that Jeremiah would come to the spot when he called him that's why he said look I ordained you before you ever born amen you know it's amazing Jeremiah's in prison the second time this is I think shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem and all these things so here he is standing in prison he's had years of rejection he's had years of rticle he's had years of problems but yet the Lord says call unto me and I'll answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not Hallelujah see many times we think we got to have a cup of coffee and the the setting's got to be just right no pressure in life and now God could I'm ready God you can speak to me Lord I'm I'm so ready I got my journal pad and you know everything's ready I got a tape playing and you know whatever more you want no God don't work that way God reveals himself in trouble amen God reveals himself in hardship God reveals himself in Affliction and mean that's where he reveals himself he doesn't reveal himself where all the padded pillows and everything's nice no it's in it's in the fiery furnace of affliction God is in that fire amen it's in that time of trouble that's where he comes on the scene that and we want to shun and run away from those things because this world we have this curse of soft living in this country that we don't want to come into those things and we think we're you know God Has Lifted his hand of blessing because we've stepped into trouble you know brother Ram says that God you go through a trial because God's accounted you worthy you found favor with God that's why you go through a trial job found favor with God God testified about job to to the devil his his his arch enemy he's a perfect man Satan this guy's perfect amen I can't tell that about you but this guy's perfect there's none like him he's my son you see and so God job found favor with God now what how did job find that favor because he had full confidence in the shed blood of the Lamb amen how about you and I friends see we try and bring things into our own ability when we think God doesn't have the ability we try and bring things under our own control and try and manipulate things and make things work when we think God doesn't can't do it may we never may we just may may we not do that anymore amen oh I've really got to do something about this brother says so many times someone starts acting up have you prayed for them go away and pray for them you know don't just ball them out don't no no go and pray for them amen let God do it praise the Lord now see the 70 would return to Jesus after they've been given power to cast out devils and things are rejoicing and all those things but he says Now Behold I give I give unto you power to tread on serpent scorpions over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen now we know that Judas was among them and we know that you know some names now not out of the Lamb's Book of Life life but out of The Book of Life some names can be taken out but I I don't want to dwell on those negative things but the thing is Jesus was telling them actually Rejoice don't rejoice in those things because I've given you dominion over things but Rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen so so before now I'm just going to take this as just from the L's book of life now so remember before there was trouble your name was written on the L's book of life before there was sickness before there was trouble before there was heartache sorrow pain or any sin or any devil the lamb was slam before the foundation of the world and your name was written with his own blood on his book am amen so so now if your name has been written there amen then nothing can take it off amen there's no there's no amount of rubbing compound in the world Amen can take your name out of that book amen there's nothing no man can rub it out so I'll say If no man can rub it out no devil can rub it out no trouble can take it away amen there's nothing there's nothing that that can come upon the Earth every demon hell can't can't take your name out of that book if God has written it there now so if God has written my name in heaven that means my real identification is in heaven right it's not upon the Earth amen it's not with what's trending hashtag and whatever social media platform that's going on it's not in Crazy Town Tik Tok whatever more my my identification is not in those things it's in heaven amen so if my identifications in heaven then what should I be upon the Earth amen I should not be just a natural person being tossed to and fro right we got to go beyond those things God wants to take us higher today am he wants to take us above the storm amen he wants to take us above trouble that we could we could just rest in his ability don't you think God can do it amen if God could save you and you're his enemy don't you think he can heal or he can provide or he can you know yep you think he can amen so we got to really put that faith into action and really trust him amen amen see many times we turn to everything else but God and then we turn to God at the end why because we don't think he can do it in the first place but if we thought he could do it in the first place we'd turn to him before he turned to everything else see like the disciples on the you know Jesus asleep in the boat the storm rages remember they Master Sailors they they were basically born on that Lake they cut their teeth on the you know you on the side of the ship you know they they were raised on that sea they were Master Sailors so don't you think they would have okay trim the sail here rob it here let's move the weight this side you know Peter is your you know the waves come go bow down through the wave and up so you don't you know submarine in and you know all those things they would have tried all of their skills why didn't they just call the master first because they thought they could do it they thought they had knowledge to control the circumstances but the one who made the wind and the waves and the Sea and everything and then the whole world the whole universe was asleep in the boat with them why didn't they just say master the storm is here help us we need you because they thought their human ability could Master the circum irance and then they came to him and said don't you care that we perish so Lord aren't you mindful don't you see we're going down with the ship can't you see we're in trouble Lord if you really were God wouldn't you stop why do you allow this to happen and Jesus could said children right I've been here the whole time why didn't you call me on the scene why are you trying to save yourselves when you can't save yourself why are you trying to do this in your own strength don't you know I'm the Christ Peter I told you amen that it wasn't me that revealed it my Father in Heaven revealed this unto thee that I'm the Christ and yet you you're trying to do it in your own strength that you know I'm the Christ don't we know this message is the Lord it is Jesus Christ revealed don't we know this is God in print form don't we know his spirit moves among us day after day week after week service after service don't you know he moves among us he's calling us calling us higher above these things don't you know he's in the boat with you I mean don't you know the one who called you in the beginning is still with you right now we see you to the end so if he's there in the beginning right here and we'll call you to the end why not wake him up why not place your problems in his feet instead of saying you do but really holding on to it see you've got a full committal brother BR says one of the most powerful things upon the planet as a full committal to God when you actually commit things to God it's not just God you got to help me then you try and do it maybe Peter was under his breath saying Jehovah God help me as I'm sailing no he wasn't trusting God cuz if he really was he would have woken up the Master he would have woken God up in his boat yeah oh I know what it's like to be sailing and see your boat do Ford rolls as you get spat out the side I've done it it's fun but I knew I wouldn't die these guys thought they were going to die and they're blaming God don't you care it's because they tried to have it in their own strength people blame God too much why do we blame God for our trouble he's what remember he doesn't Force you he doesn't say now you're a robot and now you're a robot a Christian robot that has no self ability has no has no free will he never works against your free will when you gave your life to him he didn't force you you said Here I Am Lord forgive me a sinner save me wash me I'm I'm sorry Lord here I come it was your free will that brought you know that that you gave over to him then why do we take our free will back why do we do that why can't we trust them why can't we trust him we should trust him I think the Lord's just saying trust me trust me it's dark but trust me I mean there's a lot of Gloom but trust me the world's falling apart but can you trust me see there's got to be a faith upon the Earth of a people that can trust him in everyday situations not just praising God and Shout oh the seals are open all these great things what is that really to do you can trust him he's unveiled himself more in this age than any age amen what does it really mean we can trust trust him more we can have more faith in him amen his power and ability I believe we know there's not a strong part or a weak part of God but I believe his ability is is the greatest that's ever been upon the Earth because there is a people now that will walk from this world to the next world not just Enoch one Enoch you know I used to think that Enoch just lived in some kind of little Hut there and the you know just this idilic scenery that was his life just a postcard no trouble the birds away chirping the the sun was always shining and he just had like a picnic kind of a life no he had a lot of trouble in his life the world was falling apart he had a lot of things going on that he couldn't solve but he walked with God can we do that God wants you to walk with him Lord what do you want of me today just walk with me through the day just commit your day into just commit your day into his hands and let him organize it you so many times like Christine would say she's got all these things in her schedule to do the day and doesn't know how to fit ital she she just prays and says Lord you organize my day amen and it just all falls into place supernaturally why trust praise God amen amen see the two on the way to emus their life had fallen apart seemingly humanly cuz their Messiah had been crucified the church treasure commed suicide and all the ministry had H them up in an upper room somewhere their whole life had fallen apart see in those days to to follow Jesus meant you orchestrated from ostracized from every part of society you were one of them you couldn't hide it you couldn't be a secret believer you were one of them so it wasn't a small thing they counted the cost my Village is going to reject me my Rabbi won't look at me no more the Pharisees will hate me my family will misunderstand me and probably reject me they counted all the cost cuz they saw this man was more than a rabbi this man was more than a Prophet this man was the god of the prophets and so they gladly followed him but you see now because he wasn't on the inside of them yet when when everything seemed to be going upside down they were caught up in it they weren't skipping to a mass before Jesus turned up they weren't skipping along and then he comes along and says what's happened they said the greatest thing oh my it's Sunday Hallelujah Friday what happened the Lamb of God took my sin up Calvary Hallelujah this is a different kind of a Passover this was the greatest one amen he was Emmanuel we walked with him we spent time with him never a man spake like this man and then he was taken by wicked men he told us this would happen you know he told us we believed them they weren't talking like this we know this right here comes the lamb I couldn't change myself no amount of blood of bulls and goats and things that I could sacrifice ever changed me but this man's word changed my heart and then our hero went up Calvary he gave us life his blood was shed the perfect Lamb's blood was shed for me then he went to the tomb but he said he's going to come out again hallelujah hallelujah and then Sunday it's Sunday and the tomb's empty at Sunday the angel of the Lord came down a Sunday the Romans fell down as dead men at Sunday the stone rolled away at Sunday he rose triumphant Hallelujah they weren't talking like that they were brokenhearted they were downcast who's ever had that feeling like a lead balloon in your they had about 10,000 million of them they're carrying around that kind of feeling yeah what do we do now we thought he was the Messiah the whole world fell apart you just just guard me in a journey okay the whole world fall apart and then he came along and said what's going on why are you sad and they're all so so they're not skipping and jumping you know then they begin to say you know this was uh you know we thought he'd be the Christ and all these things and then and then Jesus came along and said oh fs and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken you see at the moment see at this stage their identity was with was with god with them you can't just have an identity with God with you he must be in you in order to have a real identification that you're a son or daughter of God he must be in you that's why being part of a church that is god with you why because the spirit comes down the spiritful Believers Among Us right so that's god with you so your identification is with them so when everything's going good as a collective praise God but when things go hard what's oh no what's going on but you see your identity begins to swing because it's God with you right and this is how these guys were they had god with them hey it's great to have God with you that's incredible blessing you got the creator of heavens and earth the Lord Of Glory with you that's amazing but he doesn't want to just be with you he wants to be in you amen that's why that's why he died on Calvary that his blood would cleanse a people that he could dwell in them once again amen so so so then he began to say full slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophecy expounded unto them and all the scriptures are things concerning himself now brother Braham speaks about this and events made clear by prophecy he said now let's let's go back a few minutes now let's listen to the words quoted from himself watch here the word itself quoting the word of himself the word itself quoting the word of himself not tell them what he was but just let the word speak for itself then they know who he was the letter of the word quoting the word the word in flesh quoting the word of letter being fully identified with himself amen look here now let's listen to him quote now we know that they were all briefed of the late happenings of this of the crucifixion of the story of the Resurrection the tomb as we just read now he goes straight to the word of prophecy about himself now let's just think that he said this he said a lot more than this but watch let them hear turn over to Zechariah 11:12 wasn't the Messiah to be sold according to the prophet for 30 pie of silver you just said this man was sold for 30 pieces of silver now turn over now you're getting them scriptures Zechariah 11: 12 then he said did you notice that David said in the psalm Psalms 41-9 he was he was be betrayed by his friends then again in Zechariah 13:7 he is forsaken by his disciples and in Psalms 3511 Accused by false Witnesses you just said he was Isaiah 53:7 he was done before his accusers Isaiah 50 and6 they scorched him the prophet said Psalms 22 he was he was to cry on the cross my God my God wise th forsaken me did he do that the day before yesterday afternoon Psalms 22 again um uh 18 his garments reparted among them did they do that and Psalms 2278 mocked by his enemies the church psalms 22 again there wouldn't be a bone in his body to be broke but they pierced my hands and my feet he said holding his hands behind him no doubt at the time Isaiah 5312 said he would die between Mal factors Isaiah 53:9 said to be buried with the rich Psalm 16:10 said I'll not leave a soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption and was not Malachi 3 the Forerunner of this man I'd like to heard him quote that look at the prophecies notice when all the types he might have went through about Isaac in Genesis 22 how God foreshadowed Isaac how um how Father Abraham took his own son packing the wood up the hill and offered offered up his own son amen so we could ask that question see he would ask did he do that did they say that and they would have been like yes he did that yes they said that because they were beginning to see that Jesus was so the word that he could go back and into the prophecies and say all these things have been fulfilled in my life amen and now we could come to you and I we could come to this age did he not say he'd send Malachi 4 in the later s Church age did he do that amen did he not say that that Ministry would turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers has he done that amen did he not say Amen that that a people would know their God in this day do they know that did he not call you by his grace has he done that amen has he not washed you in his blood has not he done that has he filled you with the Holy Ghost has he done that amen has he not provided for you day after day after day has he done that has he not proved the power of his blood has he not done that for you amen has he not called you to his side has he not done has he not showed you you are his child you are his son or his daughter has he not proved himself in the storm well you say the storm's still raging well it doesn't mean he he can't handle that storm amen God is more than able amen has he opened the Seven Seals has he done that yes he has has the mighty angel ascended has he come down yes he has amen is he not Gathering his bride to himself in a Rapture as promised in the word hallelujah so you know it begin to it begin to Dawn upon them as they begin to soak it in seeing the fulfilling of all this and what had taken place the last few days in the last two or three years the Vindicated Prophecy of the age it was then that they knew that they crucified friend Jesus had fulfilled every word of this o if it was then that they know that that man truly was that Messiah that he should raise from the dead the grave couldn't hold him I'll not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption there's not one word of Prophecy can ever fail and he did raise amen amen he went to he went to the tomb with one promise that he had come out I'll not leave my soul Holy One I'll not leave thy soul in Hell neither suffer my Holy One to seek corruption Jesus went with that one promise to to Calvary that he knew he would come out again but the thing is because that was his identification it did not sway him can it happen or not he knew it was going to happen he said no man takes my life from me I lay it down if I lay it down I'll pick it back up again amen so he knew what he had to fulfill by Revelation now how much more you and I see we are God's attributes amen the redeemed son or daughter of God are God's attributes therefore we don't have to try and fit in with the world to be accepted our identification see you know people change how they do things based on who's around them yeah that's right I remember being at boarding school I started dressing like this rich guy in my dorm cuz I thought he was cool he didn't care a hell beans for me none right but I but because I was around these kind of people I tried to be like them to try and fit in because I thought well this is just where I am I'm in Pau house at Kings college and this is where I have to be this was my identification right but then when God comes your way you realize you don't have to change to please people you just let God change you to match his word because you're part of that word amen it's just like Mama Eagle you know you know the story of the you know baby eagle right she screamed to the baby that was in the chicken coop screaming to the mother I mean screaming to the baby because that cry was to awaken the baby to say You Belong With Me You Came From Me Now soar up to be with me you're not your your identification is not the chicken yard it's not the slop and the pen it's not these things it's not what the chickens are talking about you're built of a different material sure they were Birds a chicken and Eagle are birds they have the same kind of bone structure different things but they are different right one is built a sore on the heavenlies the other one is just food or the saw on the you be on the ground right but it wasn't the baby eagle that said now I'm a I'm an eagle no it was the Cry of Mama that gave baby its true identification and that's why this message is so important because it gives us our true identification that we are the sons and daughters of of God when you hear that voice behind the voice it becomes a supernatural call to you God is calling you to come up hither you may have been raised in a mess's church that's all perfectly fine but there's got to come a time when it becomes a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you amen that you are part of him and you're going back to him and you belong to him and your identification is in his word amen that's why we can't do anything else that's why we can't change things and you know match the Modern Trend because we can't identify with that I can't identify with this world not because I have to try and make myself different but because God has reveal to me who I am I trust you feel the same way you can't go to the world because you don't belong to the world I mean you may have been raised in this world but this is not you know see it's just like with Pharaoh um just just like with Moses I think I had that scripture somewhere but it said by faith we had that in in Hebrews 11 this is what brother impo brought out said by faith see by faith Moses when he came to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter so remember his mother would have because remember his mother was his witness right in the palace so she would have been whispering to him you're the deliverer you're the promised son you're more than another Hebrew boy you're a special child God answered our prayers you're here to fulfill prophecy you're here to be the God's going to use you to take us out of this place one day but you see the mother telling him wasn't enough God had to come by faith and reveal what his mother said was true about him and that's the same thing we can preach all the day long sing all the day long but takes the holy spirit of God to take that word and anchor into our hearts to reveal yes I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I do belong to him and I'm going back to him amen so by faith he had a revelation one day when he came to years I don't belong here this is this is not the part of the word I meant to fulfill I'm not meant to be here with the Egyptians this is not who I truly am he did not work himself up to receive it God revealed it to him see it's not some mental gymnastics trying to work out who you are God tells you who you are and that's why we cannot have an inferior inferiority complex wondering how what people think about us we should know if God thought of me and redeemed me when he thought of me he didn't think anything negative of me like it says in Jeremiah thoughts towards you that of Peace you come to an expected end that expected end is is has be gathered around the throne Made In His Image that's how that's his expected end and God cannot change his thoughts about you and I amen if he thought about you that way that's it that's right sure we may go through correction and trials whatever on Earth but that's irrelevant that's all for our good but if God thought of you that way I have thoughts towards you of Peace not trouble not anxiety not worry not unstability you all these things not those things no of Peace but Lord don't you know we be in this kind of age he knew exactly the conditions of this world he knew exactly what would be going on but that did not change his mind amen about you Hallelujah I trust this is kind of anchoring in somewhere you know amen so by faith see he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and by faith we're got to refuse to be identified I love this country y but I'm more than a New Zealander amen right I love this this is the best country I think it's one of the best countries in the world personally I've seen it just a few but you know I think this is a great country but my identity is not in New Zealand it's in the Lord and we have to go beyond our natural identity I came from this country this is my language this is my Forbe all those things are good but don't let that be your All In All Because if that's you're all in all you'll stay here right right but if the Lord reveals to you you are his child you're going going there amen and if he reveals that to you then the Lord will begin to change you that all of your everything you do will be his word am sure we have different cultures different ways that's fine God's a god of variety but you know everything we do should be according to the scripture amen amen amen amen let's just find a place to pull the bus over amen I'm so thankful we can say the Lord is our father amen you see maybe I just end with this thought Jacob could never become a prince with God by staying around Mama you'll find in the natural that especially a son needs validation from a father they need it those who have validation from their father become more stable people within themselves mother can say all they want and mothers you should pour it on to your children hey we should we should be you know you know we should speak positive about our kids you know brother Ram says we have the the best young people amen I'm glad someone agrees with me I think what's wrong with you parents we all have our traits and our things but he says you should never call them a bunch of rookies nothing negative so we have the most best young people in the world yes sir and I believe that I believe we should never think they are nothing they are they are wonderful you're wonderful young people it's like brother Marion I know he's not here but he invited me to go to the youth prayer meeting which he runs and I sat there I was just so blessed cuz years ago I said to them we wanted to see this kind of thing and here it is I said thank you for inviting me to your prayer meeting had a great time but you see but the thing is it takes a father to bring stability into a child see he could never become a prince with God by hanging around mama he had to he had to even though mother loved him and believed that he was going to be the one with the birthright right she had more Revelation than than than than um the father did right because because um Esau was loved by his father Jacob was loved by uh his uh uh their mother but you see he could not become a prince with God hanging around mama that's why God had to take him from there until finally he came to a place where he wrestled with God because before that his identity was in his first birth in his name of being a supplanter Jacob means a supplanter so he was living out that right and that's how people are sadly with their first nature and it can be their nationality it can be their family Spirit can be all different things they're just living that out but then there comes a time when they when we wrestle with God because he went from he went from a supplanter to Israel a prince with God Amen and his walk was different he had a limp amen so he went as a strong confident Shyer brother Braham calls him a supplanter but then he came out of that limping as a limping Prince with God but you see he wasn't Jacob anymore after that moment why because his identity was in the word of God sure he knew his forbears Abraham and Isaac now he's Jacob he knows that the promised son is going to come through all those things but it took God for him to wrestle with God that he had come to his position in the prophecy it's got to be the same thing with you and I friends we're got to wrestle with God until our walk is different our talk is different what we look at is different our dress is different our our motives our Ambitions all we are become his amen amen that doesn't matter what Trouble Comes our way we are Israel we're not a supplanter trying to work out things and Shady deals and manipulation to get their own ends no he went from that to a prince with God Amen because he realize this is who I really am and maybe we just have the musicians come now but I trust that when you look into the scripture when you look into the message you see your true identification amen that you are as as brother Isaac sung we'll sing it again I think now I have a father he calls me his own amen you know your identification is not in anything natural but it's in the word amen amen let's um let's stand this morning shall we amen let's sing that again shall we I have a maker before you ever in your mother's womb you're ordained amen you're ordained as the bride of Christ The True Believer is amen I have a maker he form my heart and before even time began my life was in his hands He Knows My Name he knows [Music] my he sees each
