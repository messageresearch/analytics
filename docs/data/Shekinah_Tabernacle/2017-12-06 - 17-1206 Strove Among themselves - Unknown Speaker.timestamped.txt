[18:20] trust you when you go hunting you'll
[18:22] you'll bring home something big I hope
[18:26] you have a blessed time down south I
[18:28] mean let's just go to the scripture
[18:30] let's go to Luke chapter 22 and let's
[18:35] read from verse 19
[18:40] and it's hot I can't do much about it at
[18:46] this point but just bear with me a min
[18:49] it'll be fine
[18:53] so here in Luke 22 and verse 19 it says
[19:00] and he took bread and gave thanks and
[19:02] brake it and gave unto them saying this
[19:04] is my body which is given for you this
[19:08] doing remembrance of me
[19:10] likewise also the cup after supper
[19:12] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[19:15] my blood which is shed for you but
[19:18] behold the hand of him that betrayeth me
[19:20] is with me on the table and truly the
[19:24] Son of Man goeth as it was determined
[19:26] but woe unto that man by whom he is
[19:30] betrayed now watch this and they began
[19:32] to enquire among themselves which one of
[19:35] them it was that should do this thing
[19:37] and there was also a strife among them
[19:42] which of them should be accounted the
[19:45] greatest my Lord blesses word you may
[19:47] have your seats this night but of a very
[19:50] odd if you if you look at the
[19:53] arrangement of of Luke I've been reading
[19:56] through the Gospel of Luke and it's
[19:58] amazing
[19:59] there's such a contrast and many things
[20:02] you read yeah we were on Sunday about
[20:04] Jesus coming up into Jerusalem on the
[20:06] back of you know a bank of the back of
[20:08] the donkey prophecy is being fulfilled
[20:09] the people are crying out Hosanna listen
[20:12] he that comes the name of the Lord and
[20:14] the great and the great excitement of
[20:16] the people and the atmosphere that would
[20:17] have been there as as the king was
[20:19] coming into a city and but then when
[20:21] Jesus when we when man was looking at
[20:24] they thought what an incredible
[20:25] triumphal entry but they said when Jesus
[20:28] beheld the city he wept over it saying
[20:30] if you only knew the days of your peace
[20:31] but it's hidden from you so that's such
[20:34] a contrast and then we come down to
[20:36] where Jesus's is in his last last you
[20:39] could say day or two maybe I think last
[20:41] day upon the earth and his earthly
[20:43] ministry he's breaking the bread it says
[20:46] they came to the Last Supper they had
[20:48] supper before this they had the Passover
[20:50] before this but this was the last one
[20:52] that
[20:53] we're gonna have in this way and he's
[20:55] breaking the bread and he's saying this
[20:57] is my body which is given for you and
[20:59] this is this cup is the New Testament in
[21:01] my blood and drink it as you often as
[21:03] remember me and then he they kind of
[21:05] turns from from the saying the one
[21:08] that's going to betray me is at the
[21:10] table with me yeah imagine the
[21:12] atmosphere would have turned he's
[21:14] talking about these things with his
[21:16] disciples the last few moments he's upon
[21:18] the earth in his body and they begin to
[21:20] strive among themselves which one will
[21:22] be the greatest and you know the last
[21:24] few moments they're going to be with
[21:26] them it's gonna be done it's gonna be
[21:28] happy it's gonna go right by it's gonna
[21:30] be finished and they're worried about
[21:32] who's going to be the greatest such a
[21:34] such a contradiction you know but people
[21:38] are always people you know I was
[21:41] thinking about this today I read this on
[21:43] Monday I've been I've been pondering on
[21:45] it for a while you know they were
[21:47] worried about who would be the greatest
[21:48] and it's amazing because here was the
[21:51] resurrection and the life and he was he
[21:53] was sitting among them I am the
[21:55] resurrection and the life you know he
[21:57] said to Mary and Martha there before
[21:59] Lazarus to and he said believe without
[22:01] us and here he was he is going to carry
[22:04] the sins of the world upon his shoulder
[22:06] carry them up to Calvary amen in the
[22:09] eternal life that was in it was going to
[22:10] be released I mean by the shedding of
[22:12] his blood his life was going to be
[22:14] really be released upon his disciples I
[22:17] mean incredible things were going to
[22:19] happen and they were getting caught up
[22:21] and who's going to be the greatest and I
[22:23] just say among us even even tonight I
[22:26] mean we have the greatest thing that's
[22:27] ever struck the earth I'm in the second
[22:30] part of Redemption I mean where God as
[22:33] God has taken the lamb has taken the
[22:35] book of of of Redemption he's taken our
[22:38] inheritance a man he's taken the seals
[22:40] off the book where once upon a time no
[22:43] man was even worthy to look upon the
[22:45] book amen
[22:46] but then now it's not it it's because of
[22:49] his blood has changed it instead of you
[22:51] would you know worth it even look upon
[22:53] it now you've got to become one with it
[22:55] I mean you've got to manifest the
[22:57] contents of the book hallelujah so now
[22:59] it's it's an incredible hour they were
[23:01] living an incredible hour I know it's
[23:04] very hot but don't fall
[23:05] sleep on me I'm in there living an
[23:07] incredible hour here was the power of
[23:09] God was going to be released I mean for
[23:12] a sacrifice through the blood of the
[23:14] Lamb that the people would live above
[23:16] sin I mean I live above their tradition
[23:19] they live above their first breath
[23:21] hallelujah that have that have that have
[23:24] power over their own nature that they
[23:27] were born with I mean you want to see a
[23:29] miracle you see a man or a woman a boy
[23:32] or a girl they can live above sin they
[23:35] can live about their first nature I mean
[23:37] that this flesh can be in subject to the
[23:40] Spirit of God that's within them that's
[23:41] a miracle friends that's a great miracle
[23:43] I mean where a person can yield
[23:45] themselves and give themselves
[23:47] hallelujah that this flesh and then
[23:49] their nature that they inherited I mean
[23:51] doesn't dictate their life but eternal
[23:54] life dictates to them how they're gonna
[23:55] live and how they interacted how they
[23:57] can respond to things hallelujah this
[24:01] was being released and this is about in
[24:04] a few moments they were going to go to
[24:05] the garden and they were tired and weary
[24:08] they they didn't fully catch what was
[24:09] going on prophecy was being fulfilled
[24:12] right in front of their eyes amen but
[24:15] they were missing it and not worried
[24:17] about who would be the greatest it games
[24:21] about who's the greatest amen you think
[24:24] about what's been what's being delivered
[24:25] to us well it's being delivered to them
[24:28] I mean where where God would God would
[24:31] release a power amen we're now to me you
[24:34] read the book of Acts and the Holy Ghost
[24:36] coming I mean a Peter standing up and
[24:39] saying ye men of Judea and yo you mean
[24:41] of Israel then we're not drunk as he
[24:44] supposed that being but the third out of
[24:45] the day but this is that spoken by the
[24:47] Prophet Joel I mean he could identify
[24:49] the prophecy being fulfilled in his life
[24:52] he could identify what was going on in
[24:54] the scripture hallelujah and they had
[24:57] dominion I mean the the government
[24:59] couldn't control them the religious
[25:02] power couldn't control them demon power
[25:04] couldn't control them hallelujah I mean
[25:07] nothing could control these people now
[25:09] because they'd been changed I mean so
[25:12] what Jesus is saying this is my body
[25:14] which I'm good at yours gonna be given
[25:15] for you this is the New Testament in my
[25:18] blood
[25:19] I mean this is this is the will this is
[25:21] the new will I mean that's in my blood
[25:23] it's gonna be released to you hallelujah
[25:26] that now I can live out of you amen
[25:29] you think of Moses are standing on Mount
[25:31] Sinai with a I trust when you when you
[25:34] listen to the message when you read the
[25:35] Bible when you when you read about the
[25:38] inheritance has been laid up you know I
[25:41] trust it means a great deal where
[25:44] everything the prophets us everything
[25:47] Adam lost has been restored I mean
[25:51] everything that Adam lost has been
[25:52] restored to you hallelujah he was he had
[25:56] dominion over the earth I mean he was a
[25:58] god over this earth hallelujah he you
[26:02] know he could speak to nature nature
[26:04] obeyed him amen he was he was the boss
[26:06] they meant the first Adam demonstrate I
[26:09] mean the second adam demonstrated
[26:11] everything the first one lost a mentor
[26:13] said it was now and now in hands of of a
[26:16] man it was a god man and then now then
[26:19] it wasn't just enough for the second
[26:21] adam to be you know four for the man to
[26:23] be restored the woman's got to be
[26:25] restored there's going to be a second
[26:26] Eve upon the earth and the Prophet tells
[26:29] us the first thief was predestinated to
[26:32] fall but the second Eve will not fall
[26:34] I mean she's predestinated not to fall
[26:36] that means she's been predetermined she
[26:39] will not fall to the Satan's lie I mean
[26:42] she will not listen to the Serpent's
[26:43] hiss I mean I pay attention to what he's
[26:45] saying but she'll turn him down
[26:47] hallelujah just as the first one
[26:49] accepted the live was deceived I mean
[26:52] the second one will see him for what he
[26:54] is
[26:54] and will turn down his lie hallelujah
[26:57] hey man this is this is incredible I'm
[27:01] in Alexander the Great he conquered he
[27:04] conquered as far as he could conquer to
[27:06] the east he went into northern India and
[27:08] his troops he will go no further
[27:10] he conquered everyone that he came
[27:11] against and he died a drunk or whatever
[27:13] in Babylon at the age of 32 whatever it
[27:16] was I mean he died to feed it he
[27:18] couldn't conquer his own self great
[27:21] generals couldn't conquer the earth they
[27:22] couldn't conquer the passions of this
[27:24] flesh I mean they couldn't they couldn't
[27:26] overcome their own selves but here comes
[27:29] a man at the
[27:30] age of 33 hallelujah he didn't just
[27:33] conquer the hell the death and the grave
[27:35] he conquered himself I mean because he
[27:37] yielded himself to the word that was
[27:39] allotted to him amen he is not my will
[27:42] but thy will be done
[27:44] and he says amen as because I live you
[27:47] shall live also amen you'll you'll live
[27:50] the same kind of life
[27:52] hallelujah amen we have an incredible
[27:57] God as God has given us an incredible
[27:59] promise he's given us incredible
[28:02] covenant hallelujah
[28:04] the thing about I think I mentioned
[28:05] Moses very briefly Moses is standing on
[28:07] Mount Sinai you read Deuteronomy you can
[28:10] feel the burden that he has this is his
[28:13] last few moments his last church service
[28:16] he's going to preach to these people
[28:18] that he's led that he delivered them out
[28:20] of Egypt God used him to deliver them
[28:22] out of Egypt he's lead them 40 years in
[28:24] the wilderness and here he is there
[28:27] wouldn't be another Sunday after this
[28:29] one there wouldn't be another church
[28:31] service yeah Deuteronomy was was one
[28:33] service basically he with me he stood
[28:37] there on you know there there by the
[28:39] mountain he is going to go up and die on
[28:41] and he preaches the book of Deuteronomy
[28:43] to them you can feel the burden I feel
[28:46] on his heart
[28:46] I mean cleave to the Lord your God this
[28:49] day choose you this day who are you
[28:51] gonna serve he says if he take the idols
[28:53] of the people of the lands Amen they
[28:56] will basically you'll be taken out of
[28:57] the land and he has a burden and he's
[29:00] delivering his lost his last service he
[29:03] received the law out of God wrote it
[29:05] with his own finger he received the law
[29:08] on Mount Sinai he received a word a
[29:10] minute he sprinkle he took the blood of
[29:12] bulls and goats he sprinkled the book
[29:14] and the people and enjoying them
[29:16] together saying this is the this is the
[29:18] Covenant that God has written by his own
[29:20] finger and he's gonna join it to you I
[29:22] mean then when you go into the land that
[29:24] you'll live I mean this word out I mean
[29:27] that be a burden Joshua had a great
[29:29] burden I mean he was commissioned I mean
[29:32] to take the people into the land but
[29:34] then he had the same kind of burden I
[29:36] felt when he gave us last church service
[29:38] he's now I'm now old and shook at an age
[29:41] choosie this day
[29:43] who you'll serve there would have been a
[29:46] great burden imagine if you had the last
[29:47] opportunity to address the people and
[29:50] you've seen God live and you've seen
[29:53] them come down and do incredible things
[29:55] and quick in his word I mean to people
[29:58] and see its word become manifest in
[30:00] people's lives and see prophecy being
[30:03] lived out right in front of you and now
[30:05] it was your turn to move off the scene
[30:07] amen and someone else had to take your
[30:09] place you'd have a burden what would be
[30:12] your last service if you could tell your
[30:14] family I mean because we know parents
[30:16] preach their children and mothers of the
[30:18] fifth gospel you know the Prophet tells
[30:20] us what would be your last service
[30:22] service mums if you had one last
[30:25] opportunity to speak to your children if
[30:27] you knew this was the last day you had
[30:29] upon the earth what would you share with
[30:31] them what would you preach to them I
[30:34] mean I trust you'd stand there and say
[30:37] well there's mostly boys boys five to
[30:41] one you'd say Oh daughters you'd say
[30:44] children Jesus Christ is the same
[30:47] yesterday today and forever he's a true
[30:49] and living God there's no other God
[30:51] beside him he's not a fable we do not
[30:54] follow some a can link devise fable of
[30:58] man we serve the true and living God and
[31:00] he came down and made his word real to
[31:03] me and show to showed himself to me that
[31:05] I'm not a God of history and he's
[31:07] present here among us
[31:09] amen and he's quick and his word to my
[31:10] soul and I'm going to go to heaven one
[31:13] of these days and I believe you are
[31:14] going to come with me serve this God I
[31:17] mean you'll never you'll never regret it
[31:19] I mean Moses no doubt if he could have
[31:21] if I could put words in his mouth he
[31:23] would say I never regretted leaving
[31:25] Egypt I never regretted leaving the
[31:28] throne room and having one last look of
[31:31] that throne and walking out of that
[31:32] palace amen to be identified with a
[31:34] bunch of slaves I never regretted it
[31:37] hallelujah Paul could have said the same
[31:39] thing I never regretted leaving the feet
[31:41] of Gamaliel I meant to follow this Lord
[31:44] Jesus Christ I never regretted a Timothy
[31:47] it's worth it all stir up the gift
[31:49] that's within thee Timothy amen
[31:51] we said the true and living God I've got
[31:53] a crown of life hallelujah
[31:56] C
[31:56] the disciples I'm trying to bring a
[31:58] great big contrast here they are God's
[32:01] gonna unite himself it's not enough for
[32:03] God to be with you he's got to be in you
[32:05] he's got to be dwelling in you
[32:07] permanently that's why he died on
[32:09] Calvary that's why he that's why I send
[32:11] this message upon the earth brother
[32:12] Graham says that the Holy Ghost is
[32:14] released through this evening message
[32:17] hallelujah I happen to believe it amen
[32:20] so now this is the purpose he sent
[32:22] Elijah to turn our hearts back to the
[32:24] original faith and the original faith
[32:26] produced God dwelling in a people
[32:29] hallelujah amen sir Timothy no doubt
[32:32] Paul would say the incidents that he did
[32:35] say be incident season out of season a
[32:38] mint take this word live this word let
[32:41] it manifest in you it's worth all the
[32:44] rejection it's worth all the
[32:46] misunderstanding it's worth all the
[32:48] resentment it's worth all all of the
[32:51] pain the hardship whatever it is you've
[32:53] got to take the worse that the your the
[32:55] best the devil can give you and take the
[32:57] worst that God can give you and the
[32:59] worst that God can give you not that he
[33:01] can ever give you a bad thing but I'm
[33:02] trying to give you a contrast as far
[33:04] greater than the best the devil could
[33:06] ever give you
[33:06] I mean because because the most richest
[33:09] people in all the world it comes to a
[33:12] moment that stops beating and then what
[33:15] where am I now they can have the
[33:17] greatest doctors and all the land but
[33:19] they come to a point say we can't help
[33:21] you anymore
[33:21] and then what where are we gonna go we
[33:24] were gonna go from here
[33:25] we have nowhere to go from here sir
[33:27] ma'am we can't do anything for you what
[33:29] do you mean have you tried this yes
[33:31] we'll try this what about this no we
[33:33] can't do that why can't you do that we
[33:34] haven't researched it yet what do you
[33:36] mean what about this no we can't do it
[33:37] oh we have the greatest thing we God has
[33:43] taken a people God has taken a people in
[33:46] you to say he's taken me he's called me
[33:49] Abraham was just an orderly ordinary
[33:52] person the Prophet said he's just an
[33:54] ordinary man but then God called him and
[33:56] that's what made the difference
[33:58] hallelujah it's not how much we learn
[34:01] even though study you learn absorb
[34:04] something you're going to absorb
[34:06] something I'd rather be absorbing this
[34:08] then all absorb
[34:10] I mean something in the news it doesn't
[34:12] really matter I'd rather be absorbing
[34:15] something that can actually live
[34:17] hallelujah so absorb all you can I mean
[34:20] but he's got to come and make it live
[34:22] hallelujah he's gonna come and make it
[34:24] live so here they were striving but here
[34:30] was Jesus here was Jesus saying here's
[34:34] the Covenant this is the reason I'm here
[34:37] this is why I gathered you I'm joining
[34:40] myself to you you're my children
[34:42] hallelujah what an age to be alive and
[34:45] brother bram said that the death bear
[34:47] resurrection of jesus christ was the
[34:48] greatest week in history just stay with
[34:53] me for a few more moments and it's okay
[34:55] now we live in an age that was the
[34:59] beginning of redemption you know we're
[35:02] going to live under the inspiration
[35:03] given for our our I mean we can't go
[35:06] back into Luther's day and live under
[35:08] the just the inspiration of just shall
[35:09] live by faith
[35:10] that's being lived out we can't go back
[35:13] to the Weasly in time and live by
[35:15] sanctification only only I mean that
[35:18] inspiration was poured out we can't go
[35:19] back there I mean we can't go back to
[35:21] Azusa Street Pentecost I mean that
[35:24] inspiration has been poured out but
[35:26] we're living in another season that's
[35:28] all God doing the work and then we still
[35:30] need the supernatural amen but God has
[35:34] opened his word to us he's opened his
[35:36] covenant to us hallelujah and it's and
[35:39] it's amazing when when you see God come
[35:42] to you has he come to you I probably
[35:45] asked us every service but I trust you
[35:46] can say yes he's actually come to me and
[35:49] he's revealed himself to me I mean I
[35:51] remember when when when I think I
[35:53] mentioned a few Sundays ago how how I
[35:56] was talking to my darling soon-to-be
[35:59] wife on the phone she says I want to
[36:00] know about the Seventh Seal and I hung
[36:02] up the phone and about three scriptures
[36:05] came to came straight away and I'm gonna
[36:08] read them let's go to look let's go to
[36:12] second Thessalonians we'll just read one
[36:13] and I'll show you something here oh no
[36:20] we'll go to to go to revelations chapter
[36:21] three as well
[36:27] because what is it the Seventh Seal is
[36:32] we understand is the wind up it's the
[36:35] end of time by the band scissors like a
[36:37] rocket going up and there and then a
[36:40] piece goes off it it breaks off it have
[36:42] you ever seen a firecracker a fire
[36:43] rocket go up and it breaks up and blows
[36:46] up and goes here the other but goes up
[36:47] loads he goes here that's not the
[36:48] Seventh Seal that is the Seventh Seal
[36:50] it's the end of time at sea into the
[36:53] devil at sea into this world system it's
[36:56] the end of the millennium it's the end
[36:58] of sin at all it's all encompassed in it
[37:01] but it's actually also more importantly
[37:04] to us it's a person coming to you yes
[37:07] Jesus coming to you as Jesus coming to
[37:10] you joining himself to you so sick of
[37:15] this alone Ian's two and seven
[37:25] see when god quickens a scripture to you
[37:30] it means the world sees here for the
[37:34] mystery are we in seventh yes for the
[37:36] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[37:38] speaking only he who now letteth will
[37:41] let until he be taken out of the way
[37:45] well who's he who's he
[37:48] that's that's the Holy Ghost amen
[37:52] that's Jesus Christ so but who's he he's
[37:56] a person he represents a person not part
[38:00] of a person right not not say if I say I
[38:05] am here and my arms only here that's not
[38:07] all of me it's just part of me he's a
[38:10] person so he who now will err but only
[38:13] he who now letteth will let until he be
[38:16] taken out of the way brother and sisters
[38:18] that when the Holy Ghost has taken off
[38:19] the earth and the bride goes with him so
[38:23] he's going to be here he's got to be
[38:25] here present amen he's here Jesus is
[38:29] here not in a physical not in as
[38:31] corporal body we're going to meet him in
[38:33] the air in that way but as spirits down
[38:35] here upon the earth amen till he who now
[38:38] letteth will let until he be taken out
[38:40] of the way he's a person amen and then
[38:44] let's go to revelations chapter 3
[38:52] and verse 20 it says behold revelations
[39:01] 3 and 20 behold I stand at the door I
[39:03] stand at the door and knock If any man
[39:06] hear my voice and open the door I will
[39:08] come in to him and will sup with with
[39:11] him and he with me I am standing at the
[39:14] door that's a person it's not part we
[39:19] we've received the fullness of Christ in
[39:21] this age not just a part the fullness
[39:23] everything God is in his word as has
[39:26] been released everything that is we're
[39:29] not living like in the Luther a
[39:30] suggestion live by faith that's it
[39:32] that's a part of him or all those yo or
[39:36] the or the age of the loop of the
[39:38] Wesleyan Church of sanctification that's
[39:40] part of him or the gifts being restored
[39:43] that's just a part of them but that's
[39:45] the full thing everything is is here
[39:48] brother Ram says everything God has he
[39:50] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[39:53] is he poured into the church it means to
[39:55] win so around the world I mean the
[39:58] fullness of the Godhead bodily is in a
[39:59] multi-member body Alleluia
[40:03] so he says i standard or not it's not a
[40:05] part of a person if I say I'm standing
[40:08] behind the pulpit I'm all here amen
[40:11] sometimes people go somewhere in there
[40:14] only there and body but I'm here body
[40:15] and in spirit I'm all here why are you
[40:20] saying this do you do you understand
[40:22] what we have I mean here was Jesus
[40:27] giving the last communion the Last
[40:29] Supper I'm gonna I don't know if he said
[40:32] those words the last first two suppers
[40:34] they had this is my body it's going to
[40:36] be given for you this is the blood of
[40:38] new testament drinkers off as you
[40:39] remember me I don't know if he said in
[40:41] the first two times when they had the
[40:42] look supper because it says the Last
[40:44] Supper he had some before but he's
[40:48] trying to share these things with his
[40:49] disciples and they're getting caught up
[40:51] with all these other things that don't
[40:52] really matter
[40:53] he's following me and it's the same
[40:56] thing with us God has given us his word
[40:59] and it's not just a bunch of doctrine
[41:02] it's a person
[41:05] this message is a person amen this
[41:07] message is Jesus Christ
[41:09] it is the Son of man being revealed amen
[41:12] and that same that son of man was
[41:14] revealed that a son of man a prophet but
[41:16] now the Son of Man is revealed in a
[41:18] church I mention it's manifested in a
[41:21] people he is manifested in a people
[41:24] hallelujah and then the other scripture
[41:27] I don't have it reference here but it
[41:29] says I will never leave thee nor forsake
[41:30] thee I that's a person it's not part of
[41:34] a person and that is you say well how is
[41:40] that the Seventh Seal Jesus that's Jesus
[41:42] Christ personally coming to you
[41:44] Amen he comes with this open book saying
[41:48] I'm going to make you I'm gonna make you
[41:50] manifest this word you're going to live
[41:53] out this message you're going to be the
[41:55] interpretation of this message
[41:57] hallelujah that it's your life your life
[42:00] I mean what you hear in 1100 takes 66
[42:04] books Amen you are going to be the
[42:07] living manifestation of those things
[42:11] hallelujah when brother Brown speaks
[42:13] about a future home and before he goes
[42:15] into the future home he says you know
[42:16] you know I go to the motels and the Blue
[42:19] Boar in different places you eat and
[42:21] sleep and they say you're so nice people
[42:22] and you know he's giving these
[42:23] compliments why is he telling those
[42:25] things he's not just trying to Pat them
[42:27] on the back he's trying to show this is
[42:29] the characteristics of the people that
[42:31] will be in the future home I mean so
[42:33] this is the this is the manifestation of
[42:36] the people that will be there Alleluia
[42:39] it's about the but because brother Bram
[42:43] teaches us very simply God interprets
[42:46] his word by bringing it to pass behold a
[42:50] virgin shall conceive they had eight
[42:52] hundred years of debate well how is it
[42:54] going to happen
[42:55] who's it going to be you know how do you
[42:57] think it'll happen rabbi well maybe
[42:58] it'll happen this way what about you
[43:00] scholar maybe it'll happen this way
[43:02] because this Hebrew word says this and
[43:04] this and this and you know and they they
[43:06] they could have debated all day long but
[43:09] then there's a woman in Nazareth
[43:11] hallelujah and she was walking the
[43:13] Prophet tells us to get water to a well
[43:15] and there was a passageway and a
[43:18] was staying there about six foot tall
[43:19] shoulder-length here kind of a olive
[43:22] complexion and says Hail Mary hallelujah
[43:27] Gabriel tells her how it's going to
[43:29] happen
[43:30] and she just says that it be unto me
[43:32] according to thy word amen the prophecy
[43:34] became fulfilled a virgin shall conceive
[43:37] that's how the virgin conceived
[43:39] hallelujah a star will rise out of Jacob
[43:42] the wise men saw the star they saw the
[43:45] prophecy be fulfilled hallelujah here
[43:49] comes your king meek and lowly on the
[43:51] back of her you know on the back of an
[43:52] ass back of a donkey riding into
[43:54] Jerusalem they could have debated how's
[43:56] it going to happen what's he going to
[43:58] look like what's the donkey going to
[44:00] look like and it just happened to them
[44:02] about a week or so before the account we
[44:05] just read of the Last Supper it was it
[44:07] was fulfilled hallelujah
[44:10] their lives became the man at the
[44:13] interpretation of the scripture the
[44:16] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[44:17] rabbi how do you think it'll happen well
[44:20] one of us will learn and we'll get our
[44:22] PhD and then we'll go camping in the
[44:25] wilderness and we'll begin to have
[44:26] open-air meetings maybe it'll happen
[44:27] that way they would have thought don't
[44:30] you think when you read the scripture do
[44:33] you sometimes think how things will
[44:34] happen
[44:34] I wonder how oh and how God would make
[44:37] organ Armageddon a house this or do you
[44:40] wonder sometimes how these things will
[44:41] happen well we'll see it happen you'll
[44:46] know it'll happen when you see it
[44:47] fulfilled amen and if it was that way
[44:50] for things we were ponder about it would
[44:52] have been you think the Apostle Paul
[44:54] didn't wonder how how things would be
[44:58] fulfilled and then he comes to find
[45:00] himself standing there saying that we're
[45:03] a light to the Gentiles hallelujah he
[45:07] begin to you know he he would maybe one
[45:11] to have them you know had what the
[45:12] Messiah would be like in different
[45:13] things and then the inspiration comes to
[45:15] him he meets the very Messiah then he
[45:18] then he goes into the desert and he
[45:20] takes the Old Testament and he shows
[45:22] that Jesus is the fulfillment I mean off
[45:25] the priesthood and all different kinds
[45:26] of things he says that his ministry and
[45:28] what he's doing right now is the
[45:30] fulfillment of the
[45:31] prophecy and here we are don't let this
[45:35] pass you by here we are I mean the
[45:37] fulfillment
[45:39] hallelujah brother Bram says as Jesus
[45:41] fulfilled the Old Testament so the bride
[45:43] will fulfill than you hallelujah amen so
[45:48] now we read you know we read in the book
[45:53] of Ephesians that his courses has
[45:54] certain heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[45:56] he said well how does that work out and
[45:59] then you happened to find yourself and
[46:01] he comes and meet you and he transforms
[46:04] you he changes you and then you're
[46:06] living in a whole different realm you're
[46:08] thinking a whole different way
[46:10] hallelujah taught you first did imagine
[46:13] bigger mansion bigger mansion being in
[46:17] an egg like an eagle and you're an egg
[46:20] and you're fully conscious that you're
[46:22] in an egg
[46:23] you used to your surroundings you can't
[46:26] leave you can't push so far sometimes
[46:29] you know when when when the sunlight
[46:31] begins to shine you may see it looks all
[46:33] red because you can you know because you
[46:35] can see the light through the shell a
[46:36] little bit you know you shine a light
[46:38] through a chicken egg and you can see
[46:39] what's inside you know that's like a
[46:42] human understanding before they're born
[46:43] again and they can think well how's this
[46:46] going to happen and how's this going to
[46:47] happen how's this going to happen and
[46:49] then and then one day they begin to find
[46:52] I've got a pick out of the shell I'm
[46:54] being restricted
[46:56] I've been restricted for by this first
[46:58] birth I want to be born again amen and
[47:02] there's something it's amazing because

[47:09] built to pick through the shout
[47:10] hallelujah say how am I gonna do this
[47:12] you're built to do it I mean you begin
[47:15] to pick and pick and then you first you
[47:17] break out then maybe it's a bit too
[47:18] bright for you keep picking and you keep
[47:20] pushing and you find yourself in a whole
[47:22] different atmosphere what's happened

[48:25] now living in a different kind of
[48:26] atmosphere amen and the baby sir I
[48:29] wonder what it's like because the
[48:31] prophecy is you shall be born again I
[48:33] wonder what it's like to be out of this
[48:35] egg well maybe it's like this maybe it's
[48:37] like this and then it happens then you
[48:39] find yourself chief the baby finds
[48:42] itself fulfilling a mean the prophecy
[48:45] its life is now fulfilling the prophecy
[48:48] of what it's like to be outside
[48:50] hallelujah and then now they and then
[48:53] and in the babies go down on the
[48:54] mother's back and they go down in the
[48:56] grass I mean they begin to walk around
[48:58] and have a Jubilee in different things
[49:00] hallelujah and in the storm begins to
[49:02] blow and their mother you'll screams and

[49:06] goes back into the nest hallelujah but
[49:09] then now there comes a time where the
[49:12] mother says you're getting too big for
[49:13] this nice child you've got to fly
[49:16] yourself and then you know I've seen
[49:18] I've seen videos where these Eagles and
[49:21] they come take baby goats off
[49:22] mountaintops they come and grab them
[49:25] they fly off you know you see apparently
[49:28] at Eagle's Nest a big one is a big thing
[49:30] it's got all kinds of 30 yards it's not
[49:32] just branches there's all kinds of
[49:33] things so the nest is comfortable but
[49:36] then there comes is the prophecy
[49:37] remember and in the believer you take
[49:41] Moses he was born under a prophecy he
[49:46] was part of a prophecy your seed Abraham
[49:49] will sojourn in a strange land
[49:51] they'll be afflicted for hundred years
[49:53] but I'll bring them out with a mighty
[49:54] hand and that prophecy was Moses
[49:57] and that he was part of that prophecy he
[50:00] didn't know that when you know when his
[50:02] mother said you know you're a special
[50:04] child we've been praying for a deliverer
[50:06] you know he had in his mind okay I'm I'm
[50:10] in Pharaoh's house I'm the general I
[50:12] know where the arms are I know how this
[50:14] is going to all work out I meant but
[50:16] when the interpretation of that prophecy
[50:18] came here he was 80 years old he was on
[50:21] the backside of the desert 40 years
[50:23] hallelujah this old man with a big long
[50:26] beard and different things and he comes
[50:27] and he comes into Egypt and the customs
[50:30] he fills out his customs form what's the
[50:32] purpose of your visit
[50:33] invasion other invasion and they lead
[50:35] him through that's what you know what's
[50:38] your purpose of your visit other
[50:40] invasion please specify okay
[50:42] and then yeah where you go Moses the
[50:45] Prophet says I'm going to take over and
[50:47] the thing is he did it Alleluia he was
[50:50] his life was the interpretation of that
[50:52] prophecy in him was that prophecy and
[50:55] then it was expressed I mean David was
[50:57] to be king over Israel Samuel goes down
[51:00] to Jesse's house and Jesse's house I
[51:02] have a king amen and then who must to be
[51:05] that king he was going to be the
[51:07] fulfillment of that word he didn't know
[51:09] how it was all going to work out all he
[51:11] knew is I'm going to be the
[51:12] manifestation Pulu you of that word
[51:15] because I am that word amen and so now
[51:18] and the Eagles of prophecy you must fly
[51:21] you must be like mama hallelujah
[51:25] you must be like mommy you got a sore
[51:27] from the heavenlies that's in the babies

[51:33] did you see what you did there
[51:35] look how she so fast how could you ever
[51:38] follow there that's so amazing and we
[51:40] read the word you hear the message and
[51:42] you see God come down service after
[51:45] service amen casting out Devils healing
[51:48] the sick where the promises get out of
[51:50] that stretcher hallelujah I think it's
[51:53] certain whose's Melchizedek in the end
[51:54] there's a woman of saying lying on a cot
[51:56] get off that cot hallelujah and then you
[51:59] can hear she gets up on the people just
[52:01] in all hallelujah
[52:03] they say that's so amazing how can that
[52:06] be sorry but you go to it's just like
[52:09] they baby eagle look at mama
[52:11] look how incredible that is and it but
[52:13] it's one thing now why is mama flying
[52:15] like that because she wants to tell her
[52:17] babies you'll do the same as me I'm
[52:20] going to demonstrate this that you'll do
[52:22] it one day hallelujah that's the same
[52:25] thing with our God he did he's been
[52:27] waived
[52:28] brother ham says that as the rising of
[52:30] the Sun and to me it's it's one of my
[52:32] most precious sermons where's the
[52:34] Declaration he says it was a dual Sun
[52:37] rising that that resurrection morning
[52:38] and natural Sun arose but then the sol
[52:42] rose as well this is after two thousand
[52:44] years hallelujah that take me somewhere
[52:46] has risen I mean he's been waved over
[52:49] the people why is it being waved because
[52:51] you look at him and say because he's
[52:53] telling you yeah you know what the
[52:56] waving is about let's just go back a bit
[52:58] and in Leviticus I think it's Leviticus
[53:01] 23 they have a field of wheat wheat and
[53:05] matures at a different rate the mature
[53:07] part of the field is cut down some of it
[53:10] can still be green some of it can be yay
[53:12] big I don't know they cut down the
[53:14] mature part that's given to the priest
[53:15] and the priest ways that before God
[53:18] saying thank you God that the rest of
[53:20] the field will come like these ones
[53:22] hallelujah so it's waved its waved as an
[53:26] offering the rest of the same grain amen
[53:29] will be exactly like this and brother
[53:31] Graham says that was that was the son of
[53:33] God was cut down and then he was waved
[53:35] over the people of Pentecost
[53:37] Amen sit in that that same God has waved
[53:40] over the people hallelujah because if
[53:43] the grain could look up that say they
[53:45] could be green they could be still
[53:47] standing up like this half growing but
[53:50] they could say to your neighbor
[53:51] hey look at that we're going to be
[53:53] exactly like that one hallelujah because
[53:55] we're the same species we're the same
[53:57] type of of seed hallelujah and they
[54:01] couldn't help but maturing they couldn't
[54:03] help but growing amen to his wave their
[54:06] Helou you I mentioned how God was with a
[54:09] Holy Spirit wave the Son of man has been
[54:11] waved over the people and this should be
[54:14] something in you you say I'm gonna be
[54:16] like this hallelujah you say well how am
[54:20] I gonna become like that I don't know
[54:22] but there's something in me like the
[54:24] baby eagle
[54:24] you take a baby eagle that's just
[54:26] hatched out of a pest out of it some egg
[54:29] and you look at the mama do you think
[54:34] how's that gonna ever saw like that
[54:35] how's it ever going to swoop down and
[54:37] catch its prey and take it up and but
[54:40] it's going to it has to it has to
[54:43] because the same DNA the same life
[54:46] that's and murmurers in the baby I mean
[54:48] the baby's just got to grow hallelujah
[54:51] and follow its Mama's leading hallelujah
[54:53] and it will become it must become like
[54:56] its mother and is the same thing with us
[54:58] friends
[54:59] holy say how am I ever gonna be like
[55:01] Jesus amen
[55:02] their same life that was in him as in
[55:04] you I trust you got to say it the same
[55:07] life that was in him it's in me and that
[55:10] will produce the same life the same
[55:13] characteristic everything that he is I
[55:15] mean I will become your brother Graham
[55:18] says she is him in just a few words but
[55:22] it's very astounding she assumed does
[55:24] that mean we we become Jesus we receive
[55:26] worship no I mean but husband and wife
[55:28] become one did everything the husband is
[55:31] the wife becomes hallelujah she is we
[55:34] are Christ's and feminine form because
[55:36] we are part of him not the way of
[55:38] anything good of ourselves it's all him
[55:40] hallelujah and then now the baby gets
[55:43] big enough a little bit and then then
[55:45] the mama Eagles got a gotta stir the
[55:48] nest because now now the babies are
[55:53] going to learn to fly like mama they may
[55:55] have danced around had a little Jubilee
[55:57] in the nest glory hallelujah isn't this
[56:00] wonderful but then they get a certain
[56:02] size your mama begins to take all the
[56:04] soft stuff out of the nest hallelujah
[56:07] maybe all the goat skins in there and
[56:09] the leaves and whatever more that's soft
[56:11] and that you're the rabbit skins or
[56:13] whatever's there go dig it all out
[56:15] children you got to fly but mama right I
[56:18] want to fly you've got to fly you've got
[56:20] to exercise your wings of faith I mean

[56:24] don't want to pack you around I want you
[56:26] to fly with me I want to have fellowship
[56:28] with you I mean you can show me a barrel
[56:31] roll I'll do a barrel roll

[56:35] a loop-the-loop y-you do experience this
[56:37] together
[56:38] there's a nut grater you know what's
[56:40] greater you that have children carrying
[56:42] them around like a baby and going on a

[56:47] they get big enough they say come daddy
[56:50] let's go let's go down the slide let's
[56:52] go on the swing together let's play a
[56:54] game
[56:54] what's better as a parent when they get
[56:57] older cuz you begin to interact
[56:59] hallelujah and they begin to enjoy it
[57:01] more you following me how loose like us
[57:05] now we get a certain age he's taking all
[57:09] the padding out of the nest bad things
[57:12] are good bad things are good because he
[57:15] wants you to fly in the heavenlies he
[57:17] doesn't want you to be earthbound in the
[57:19] and the nest with a bunch of did did
[57:21] kill he wants you to fly up into glory
[57:23] amen catch a catch a thermal and just
[57:26] ride it up into the heavenlies
[57:27] hallelujah I remember the first time I
[57:30] saw an eagle in the wild was in Papua
[57:32] New Guinea and it was just way up we
[57:35] were talking I was talking to to brother
[57:37] modem about baptism under their house
[57:39] Christine knows because she's been there
[57:41] and then knows that Eagle just so just
[57:43] didn't even didn't even flap its wings
[57:45] it's just like this just going so fast
[57:47] high up in the sky so while that's
[57:50] incredible spread your wings set them in
[57:53] the winds of faith hallelujah I mean
[57:57] that's what we're called to do
[57:58] that's why though that's why the nests
[58:01] get stood up and you're glad it's that
[58:04] way hallelujah because he wants you he
[58:07] wants you to see what's in you I mean
[58:10] when we see you know as I see it about
[58:12] Moses and David and you know it's easy
[58:14] to put it on them but then when we come
[58:16] you to look at your own self and say I'm
[58:19] a prophecy I'm a prophecy Peter James
[58:23] and John 120 in the upper room they
[58:26] didn't know in the prophecy of Joel
[58:27] maybe before it happened I'll pull my
[58:30] spirit out upon all flesh
[58:32] this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel
[58:34] they didn't know that containing that
[58:36] prophecy was Peter James and John and
[58:38] one hundred and hundred and seventeen
[58:40] other people in the Upper Room to
[58:42] initiate that outpouring you follow me
[58:45] they didn't know that they were part of
[58:46] their prophecy
[58:46] but God God when he thought of that
[58:49] would being manifested he saw them in
[58:51] the upper room he saw these ones of the
[58:54] vessels I'm going to pull myself into
[58:56] hallelujah and that's why Peter could
[58:58] say this is X welcomed by the Prophet
[59:00] Joel he could say I am the fulfillment
[59:02] of this prophecy this day the Scriptures
[59:06] fulfilled in your ears hallelujah he was
[59:09] the fulfillment amen and it's the same
[59:12] thing with you and I when when God said
[59:14] I'll have a bride without spot or
[59:16] wrinkle let us be glad and rejoice for
[59:19] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[59:21] his wife has made herself ready amen
[59:24] when when God God gave the inspiration
[59:26] at Scripture to John you were there you
[59:30] were there in the vision I'll put it out
[59:32] because you're the fulfillment amen the
[59:34] bride around the world is the
[59:36] fulfillment I don't think I've gone off
[59:37] in some crazy tangent if Moses was part
[59:41] of the prophecy there Amen Jesus was
[59:44] Jesus was the fulfillment of the seed of
[59:46] the woman coming there was prophesied to
[59:48] Adam and Eve they meant there all
[59:51] Isaac was the fulfillment of of God
[59:53] telling Abraham that you can have the
[59:55] promised son he was the manifestation of
[59:57] that of the natural part of that
[59:59] prophecy we know Jesus was the greatest
[1:00:00] seat amen yo this that's all they are
[1:00:07] the interpretation of that scripture
[1:00:10] that's easy sometimes I say well that's
[1:00:12] them but we're going to look at now what
[1:00:14] is the what is the scripture allotted to
[1:00:16] us because the inspiration is poured out
[1:00:20] upon the scripture that's being
[1:00:22] fulfilled in your day amen that's why I
[1:00:25] said Lutz's lived out his portion of the
[1:00:27] word weasely lived out his portion amen
[1:00:30] Azusa Street Pentecost lived out their
[1:00:32] portion but what about our Porsche
[1:00:34] hallelujah that's why we've got to
[1:00:36] preach the message for this day I mean
[1:00:39] Peter said that you would be established
[1:00:41] in present truth present truth we want
[1:00:45] to be established in present truth not
[1:00:47] just passed truth present truth
[1:00:50] hallelujah because of your established
[1:00:52] and present truth did everything that
[1:00:54] would that happen for and your behalf in
[1:00:56] the past will be a lot of Tears Amen
[1:00:59] because it's when you
[1:01:00] receive they made the message for your
[1:01:03] day I mean it ties you back into what
[1:01:05] everything he did feel in the past
[1:01:07] hallelujah
[1:01:08] it's like some man standing there now
[1:01:10] hope I don't this is okay he's a man
[1:01:14] steering he's there on the Mount
[1:01:16] crucifixion he sees the Lamb of God
[1:01:18] taking away the sin of the world
[1:01:20] he believes it but then here comes the
[1:01:23] apostles and here they bring the Word of
[1:01:27] Life now he had to receive what they
[1:01:30] preached he had to they had to receive
[1:01:33] it he had to walk in the light as he is
[1:01:35] in the light amen yeah because that was
[1:01:39] where the present truth was is it is
[1:01:43] this all like you you understand what
[1:01:44] I'm saying it's like Moses comes along
[1:01:46] you got to take a lamb hold them for
[1:01:50] about 14 days then you got to kill the
[1:01:52] lamb take the blood put it on the door
[1:01:55] and lintel of your house the death
[1:01:57] angels going to strike now a lot of
[1:01:59] people who could have said but I'm a
[1:02:00] circumcised Jew I'm a circumcised Jew I
[1:02:04] don't need to do this with no lamb I'm
[1:02:06] not putting no blood on my door I just
[1:02:07] painted it that's not practical for me
[1:02:10] that's messy I'm a very clean person now
[1:02:15] if he didn't if they didn't apply the
[1:02:17] Lamb's blood to their house the death
[1:02:19] angel would have hit them even though
[1:02:22] they were circumcised they had to
[1:02:25] receive what God was telling him in that
[1:02:26] day they meant and it's the same thing
[1:02:31] in this day we don't serve a historical
[1:02:33] God I'm gonna wind up with this and
[1:02:35] we'll continue with it on Sunday but we
[1:02:37] don't serve a historical God he is the
[1:02:40] great I am he's the present God what is
[1:02:43] he doing in this day hallelujah what is
[1:02:46] he doing in this day an hour I just
[1:02:50] leave that hanging for Sunday but you
[1:02:52] see we have to receive you have to
[1:02:56] receive what he does in your day in our
[1:02:59] Amen even even in the days of Noah
[1:03:02] because God God gave covered Adam and
[1:03:05] Eve with lambskins Abel offered a
[1:03:07] sacrifice and that sacrifice was
[1:03:09] accepted they come down a few hundred
[1:03:12] years I'm building an ark
[1:03:14] showed me this is the only way of
[1:03:16] escaping this day it's gonna rain you
[1:03:18] got to get in now someone could say and
[1:03:20] say mister no sir I don't know about
[1:03:23] your arc
[1:03:23] I know Abel was accepted I'm just going
[1:03:26] to offer a lamb that's all I'm going to
[1:03:29] do I'm not gonna get in your boat I'm
[1:03:31] gonna do this what would have happened
[1:03:33] to that person Abraham I mean Abel's
[1:03:36] sacrifice was accepted but now this was
[1:03:38] another season think about it let's have
[1:03:43] some musicians to come they had to get
[1:03:47] in the ark you know the ark is Christ
[1:03:50] amen but you've got to receive you have
[1:03:53] to receive what God does that's like
[1:03:57] Moses seed to the people God will raise
[1:04:00] up a prophet like unto me and who
[1:04:03] doesn't hear him he'll be cut off from
[1:04:04] among the people and the scribes and
[1:04:07] Pharisees Pharisee said we are Moses
[1:04:09] disciples but then Jesus said if you had
[1:04:12] known Moses you would have known me
[1:04:14] because Moses wrote of me they didn't
[1:04:17] really know Moses they said tradition it
[1:04:19] hadn't become a life to them Amen let's
[1:04:22] just I want to sing that song and
