which will be everyone hears clapping yeah so we can sort of we won't have to go through all this but yeah this has been a very interesting time for the for the world to go through and yeah the some big changes coming up for the globe in the in the next short while I think you'll find it's it's fascinating times even this event this happened as as it's changed how things are going to happen even though it's essentially a small thing that's happened but the way that it's gone about don't know don't understand if he no one's doing things or what's happening but the end result was going to be catastrophic I think for the way the world operates and and it's yeah it's it's going to be like in a natural sense it's going to be really quite bad for the world and is there's going to be big changes coming and it's gonna be a very chaotic time I think you'll find in the next months and years things are not things are going to go different very different from here like the the the global economy is basically going it will crash it's going to collapse and crash the system we have at the moment is going to crash it can't sustain itself the debt can't be serviced then is there's going to be there will be big changes as a result of that and yeah that's something people's life savings that they worked so hard for they will eventually if they've got them held in cash they will disappear like people have gone out sweeted in worked hard and must been away from their families and that value they got from their will be gone if it's held in cash because there'll be hyper inflation which cash won't be worth anything certain currencies won't be worth anything around the globe and it will be it'll be a very sad time in a very hard time but you know we are we're on the right track because we've got the Lord you know and that's that's um that's humanity's only hope as the Lord because there's a we're on a path to destruction unfortunately in this world but let's um I want to

just so I just got to sort out the trying to share my my my screen I mean it's a first all happy Mother's Day I mean god bless all the mothers out there hey man you know I was thinking today about how you know brother Aaron would would speak about blind Bartimaeus and and he would say it was his mother that told him all the great stories of the heroes of faith like Joshua and Elijah and the different ones that they will walk through Jericho and it was those stories that she would tell her as she would tell him as she would pick him up on his I'm on her lap as as here's a little boy and those things anchored into his heart and then when finally the God of hosts prophets and you know you know was walking through the gates of Jericho that morning I mean because of what his mother told him I mean he recognized that that the god of Elijah the God of Joshua was now walking amen through the through the gates of Jericho and he called we've got what he needed at that time so god bless you all the mothers trust you've had a wonderful Mother's Day and yeah god bless you all amen let's um it's let's go to the scripture shall we let's go to Genesis chapter 15 and I'm just gonna try and set us up here trusty ones header everyone's had a good morning so far you have your iron meet yourself you're more than welcome to yes I as as brother Isaac was saying you know Lord willing this coming Sunday we'll be back in church and and but we're gonna of course we're going to set up what we you know how we need to rearrange the place according to you know to adhere to the level two guidelines and I'm I've already spoken with brother EDA at a meeting of other convene as well so we're gonna basically set up the seating see what's going to be in the bubble we're gonna make sure there's the meet at distances and and there's enough hand sanitizer and all those things in place so I'm but but we'll get that information out to you before Sunday run arm you so but without planning and we're excited I mean to be back in church to get a man that finally this this this lockdown is well coming to an end for us anyway and yes I god bless you all and yes let's go to Genesis 15 and we're gonna read from verse 4 I'm just gotta find I mean so Genesis 15 and 4 and if you're there you can you can say say Amen so Genesis 15 you for and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine ear but he that shall come forth out of our own bowels shall be thine ear and he brought him and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and it counted to him for righteousness now we're going to go to Romans chapter 4 I just want to take you very well you know just as you're turning I want to continue talking about faith being being our righteousness and I just want to you just want to continue on this thought here but we just so say I mean when you're in Romans chapter 4 amen amen I got navy for my lounge for one what shall we say then that Abraham out then that out that Abraham I Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if Abraham were justified by works he hath wrought to glory but not before God Ford said the scripture but abraham believed God and was accounted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works now we keep reading down first down down to verse 13 saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered amen listen as the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or uncircumcision and circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had been circumcised that he might be the father of all them that belief though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed under them also and and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world not to Abraham or to a seat through the law but through the righteousness of faith malicious belfry this morning the Lord Jesus we're so thankful we can get a lord in your presence Lord we have sang the songs of Zion Lord Lord even now our hearts are filled with joy and Thanksgiving this is what you've done for us Lord and how you're walking with us in this hour and I just pray our Lord may just take this little thought Lord may you may be multiplied to Gourmet tag these take the Lord like you took the loaves and the fish is physically Lord and feed the multitude or may spiritually take the loaves and the fishes your word and by the grade of heaven and multiply it Lord that Lord we would go out of this meeting full and satisfied and rejoicing but this may you grounded their God I just want to commit the service unto your hands Lord may take three months in every life Lord have your way in our hearts O God and may we leave this meeting change Lord Jesus our renewed father we just want to pray for those who a second body at this time Lord I pray you touch them Lord make them well though we know by your stripes you've already healed them Lord and father all those who are afflicted by this virus around the world father I pray Lord that you touch their bodies and healed him as well Lord may this plague be stayed oh god father Lord may may may churches would be allowed to reopen Oh God mission work continue Lord you see the burden of your bride is to is to preach this gospel into the all the four corners of the world Lord that the end will come oh god I pray you'll help us Lord made it Lord we believe Lord that your plants could not be hindered but father we just pray Lord that may this may made this lockdown not continue much longer father may you grant it Lord and may you meet all those who don't know you in this hour as well father maybe be a mighty reliable Lord maybe be a great awakening of your children in this time father in Jesus Christ and granted Lord amen I mean god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I like to I speak about faith the path of faith you know I just want to continue in this thought so we read here that abraham abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness now this is the in the scripture that that there is actually a link between someone's righteousness and their faith it was um you know when you read about Noah you know I said that Noah found grace in the side of the law and so that was you know and he was he was considered righteous but you know it was Abraham was the first one that was ever God linked faith and righteousness together and said because he believed God he was righteous amen and when he is the father of the faith they meant in that and that it's not only this is not only attributed to him I mean bless attributed to us as we just read so Evans is now God receives our faith when he gives us the Holy Ghost I mean just just as abraham believed God and God gave him a a sign that that that his faith was accepted and that sign was that he was circumcised right but faith he received that faith before he received the circumcision and that faith made him righteous but the circumcision was just a sign from come to him that God had received his faith now it's the same thing with us I meant the faith that we have received and we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and then God receives that faith and and the sign that he has received that faith as he gives us the Holy Ghost I mean so now we have an assurance now the believer has the assurance I mean that their faith works or maybe it's just me but there are many times we think do we have the faith I need to actually ever ahim to get a hold of the promise for the hour right I mean this is this is always a challenge the devil says alright you don't really believe you don't have enough right but I want to tell you this morning I mean if God has given you the Holy Ghost I mean then God has received your faith I mean that you now have the faith I need to produce the promise they are which is the body change faith amen Abraham's faith produced you know caused him eventually to receive the promise up right sorry but like some thing is now his faith way to work I meant and then he lived his faith love and he received a promise of his a lacy Abraham's promise Mima the word for the ally if we want to put it in kind of mrs. Lindo message of the Ellen Abraham's day as he would receive the promised son was the message of the Alpha warning is out all right so now so so God gave him the sign of circumcision God had received his faith that the message of the young would be manifested in his life in other words he was going to receive the promised son as even with me because you know many times we look oh I just had the faith you know because we're Abraham's you know seed you know way according to faith where Abraham's children and as the father's afraid he believed God it was a putative righteousness and you know and then and then and then we think well how does this work in our life grow the faith of Abraham had and going to see their faith that gave him the sermon God accepted it I mean then then gave him the promised son did now we believe God and God and the proof we believe God as he fills us with His Holy spirt right and that is the evidence that is the proof I mean that that the message of the L will be manifested in your life I mean we provide the body changed ultimately the promise right that's ultimately diplomas from the age and infestations that we're living in is in the living Church I mean that will be translated the class for Christ first right change these mortal bodies a man and God is going to take us with them and in fact next to mention and we'll be not because God has taken us that's important H right so now Jojo do we have a face for a rapture and also a bride does have to fight into the word that we have received right it's all tied into the word that we received now Abraham do not receive he didn't received the same instance we have Rock him a god down through the ages gives us certain misses programs isn't really simply what good would it be as Moses came into Egypt preaching Noah's message and wouldn't work now as Noah's the word for Noah's day though still true today that was just as Jordan and Moses day but it didn't apply the same way to Moses as it did to Noah because no the build the I maybe he thought God moved on his hand he found grace in the sight of God and the message in the ad then was to build the ark and get in right and everyone that really took God in His Word really believed what God was saying stepped into the akima sight but then Moses couldn't have gone down into Egypt I'm gonna let my people go you know they just wouldn't work because that message couldn't have worked in that day because that was know as message right same thing when John the Baptist came he he wouldn't have done no good if he preached Moses's message for the law is still true though what Moses said was true but but but I've John the Baptist I mean could not have stood there and preached what Moses preached cousin was now a different season and then you go through Jesus Jesus what would it be if Jesus preached knows message or mother's message or even John the Baptist message I thought they were all sure but God had moved on those ones that police I mean that they received that word is not a mental workout but something in their heart says yes speaking yes I believe that I mean then God takes their faith and attributes it to them for righteousness amen the promise of the hour and they day no I'm just gonna maybe you know it's like you drive somewhere sometimes you drive far sometimes you drive slow you know this 50 kaiser 30k so these may be 100k sir we may be in the 30k zone but we're going to give him a faster reach leave I just wanna emphasize this a little bit you know you know you take you take Joshua and Caleb they received the word for the day they received the message of the hour okay and because they believed that they were counted righteous and it manifested members of faith they had in that word that they see took them into their inheritance I'm it's a Joshua and Caleb were were there there were slaves but then they but then Moses came into Egypt and they recognize this was more than a man during this this was God during this call in his word and they followed an old way to Mount Sinai and they received that law and they and they recognized that God had come not just to give them a ceremony or models of church order well this is how you should trace it this is what you should do I'm in the message the house which I was this week after brother John Andes preached on on Tuesday you know I bow down with saying that message many times we tell the people what they shouldn't do I mean bility to tell me what they you know like we should do Rob I should stop drinking and smoking and you know lying and cheating you know this is many times what people tell people they should stop doing but we should but he sees in that message we need to tell the people what they should do and and they should believe on the Lord Jesus Christ because it's a power in faith Joshua and Caleb they received the message of the hour and I'm just yeah I'm going to use our language they received the word for the day slavery three sons sons of God but they were in slavery and took them away from slavery Egypt into their inheritance to the promised land so they manifested and there are lies the message of the day when Caleb was responding his 84 years old he took his mountain he could finally look back and say everything Moses preached our beneficent Scripture and it's completeness on all the way down from his journey he could look back inside everything Moses preached I'm now living it up hallelujah and saw one you know brother Brad would say in my house I've just got this here he says now let's take for instance all of us we'd say we one slide and we'd still with curse and swear and do everything that's wrong well one day when we accepted Christ what did he do he opened up as soon as we accepted a better faith just like Paul told the relevant of book to have belief just exactly what drug did believe see and as soon as we accepted Christ I'll save you immediately we received in our faith till you walked away normal lying normal stealing no more cheating see why we wrote right up above that sins that we used to ride in there we was a lot of that much faith why because we believe that we are saved is that right we believe here that we are safe so that we run up above that because we believe we are saved and then you'd say I believe is in the same message I was telling my wife the other day how much I loved her so I so I don't guess she wants me to talk about this but but if I do it in private so I guess I can do it in the public right now I was telling you how much I loved her and how I always have loved her since the first beginning I said I see that don't make any difference you see no bill she said talking about how fat she was getting it and here was turning grey I said honey you could be as wide and not here I still love you just the same see because it has to be something there that you have to meet that you love somebody and at least that person loves that other person he says this is for you young girls it's not marriage in you boys when you meet that girl that you love and there's just something you know you love her and that's just all there is to it or you love him and you don't care where these handsome ready handsome really she's pretty enough pretty that doesn't matter but you love them just the same now you'd better watch kind of hold around close there because you're getting close to home in so it's basically saying you basically found the one that looks lead you across to get married to me alright you know yes so it's not based on outward appearance at all yes she's beautiful I love her she does they're here or how he is or whatever no there's something in them you just love them oh and a marriage based outside of that is sure to fall or it'll never be successful and literally happy now I said that to get around to one thing I want to say is his friends are converging outside of the same thing won't last either at won't when you go to church you say well I'm going to join church I'm going to be yeah I'm going to be baptized if it isn't coming from a high of life to God yonder it'll never go nowhere you'll just all you'll do is join church and be baptized but when you're converted to Christ I love to Christ then you accumulate a faith in Christ who knows what accumulate means it means it means you get more and more and more Rock you know I'm in a faith in Christ like you would take your wife to your husband you accumulate a faith that you walk in that faith I don't know I just there's something about you just something that anchors you there you see well this the same way it is about Christ and what Christ says you believe it and you just stay right with it that's the way it just raises you right up above it and God brings it to pass and fulfills his promise if they will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ I and my house shall be saved those are just walking member a real conversion is embraced you know and I think I see this a few weeks ago but a real conversion is not based on circumstances it's not based on circumstances it's based on who he is and what he has done right I mean is our salvation that down Calvary I mean we're free people hallelujah he's bought us a mighty long way through the world that was coming to a leg and he's given us a faith to present every promise remember win-win-win faith lands in the heart I mean he God has received that faith that every promise in the book now belongs to that person see see see many times what to do I have enough faith for a body changing for Haley where do baby yes we have I mean if he has received on faith hallelujah I mean did we have the faith that we need just gets greater and greater and accumulates now I just want to go to Romans teen here he sees here for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name Lord shall be saved now then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe and how shall they preach except they be seen as is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good I mean glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel flys is at Lord who has believed our report so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God now this is how faith comes right faith cometh by hearing the word of God right faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so if the word is preached then you receive hearing you receive faith but just like am I saying you know I'm gonna travel and meet you and I go there by my account so much to you right I have traveled by my car to you and is the same thing we says that faith cometh by hearing I'm in your face comes to you by hearing and hearing by the word so if the word has now preached I meant the advices are saved right you received hearing that you can hear the word and you can verse a fight I mean but the thing is now that that what what we must recognize is we will only as high as the word is preached I meant so for example I mean if the message was just a message of justification only do this is Hardware look right would be in and out up and down you know with the you know things would bother us you know yeah they'd still be sitting holding us down and you know that because that's as high as we could live but you would be justified the side of God and now if the message was only a message of justification and sanctification then we would only live a holy life right they wouldn't be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost following me I mean they would be healings and miracles and signs and wonders that far as we could live and because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and then now if we as the message was our you know but but we know the message is more than that this message is a message of full adoption right okay Marvin Amen see see if this is sealed if this is sealed did how can the would be preached out of it and that give us a rapturing faith I meant Moses now the book came open emerges day I mean that yeah you're the Lord part of it came down into his hand you could say and he preached the contents of the book to them and they needed to receive that open book on Mount Sinai and face it we're going to take the land now and they're winning took the land from the hearing of the word merits this is why God brought us out I wasn't used to give us a bunch of jet rolls I mean I was actually that we would grow as an adopted body I mean the promised land everyone will be a near here that's right and is the same thing today I mean the book is come Harper oh yeah we believe it darling we believe revelations Tina's be manifested angels come down with an open book how they're seven thunders hammer out of their voices it's very simple because program says that you know what's a thunder as the voice of God not interpreted and then when Jesus glorify thy name there's a one spark from heaven said I've glorified just say just say this but you know this is not just a if this was just Abraham's inheritance but he believes it any manifested right the tech maybe cam and duster they had a bit more right and they man cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so they receive the message for the day and in their lives manifest then you can take King David when he was anointed king I mean if something anchors in your heart then you can just continue to walk on no matter what you see with your eyes what do you see you know even what you see with your eyes maybe you feel the sickness in your body I mean you can walk with God irrespective of those things this just comes to mind so I want to scroll down let me show you because what happens now is the promise of God is always present run what happens is the devil tries to block the promise that see the promise of God but we see you can say our circumstances shown you know this three deer right this three deer in this forest now if we if we are just looking casually what happens is sometimes we are looking for something I played cricket and and and and lost the tennis ball in the bush somewhere yep now if your sometimes you've actually put a look past all the Leafs and then you can see the tennis ball right but if your vision is actually just caught up in the bushes you'll never see it but yeah it's right there I mean you got to look those leaves and look through and look for the tennis ball it's the same thing with the devil the promise of God is there but he tries to put things in its way right then all we can sometimes see is just what the devil's put in front of it and not the promise but if you look past the circumstances if you look past your sickness if you look past your financial worries and posture you're maybe trouble in the family or even trouble in your own body troubling your spurt if you look past those things then you can actually see I mean the promise of God some will be looking for the deer so just do this this is where they have a mean now some of us now and in circles of mysamma I just found the photos of it but you know some of us that have found those a lot quicker than others because some of us are used to chasing our four who friends through the fires trying to kill them right so that some of us they used to walk in that kind of environment right looking for deer to shoot so they they they they have become trained to look for deer hiding behind rocks and trees the bushes whatever more some of us are not but it's the same thing with the Word of God and then we have to make the lord help us to actually as we walk in the word then we can look beyond circumstance and trouble I mean whatever it may mean we can look beyond those things and look for the promise because if we can see the promise I mean then we will press into that promise right but if we see what the OtterBox right scarecrows and worrying for travel and sickness and pain and sorrow and and uncertainty all those findings and we just look at those things we'll never see the premise because our focus is not on the promise anymore it's on the trouble Amen so Lord Jesus maybe just look for the promise member member when okay Sarah was looking so so just imagine that as these are the promise you have a promise um you'll be the father of many nations okay just just amazing those deals like that now Sarah speed twenty-five years or twenty forty years looking at it like this but but we're out past childbearing age I've already gone through menopause we couldn't even have children when we were young with well pasta agents what was she doing looking at the trees and not seeing the deer not seeing the puppies but Abraham because God revealed at them he could see the promise promise and he was strong giving glory to God I mean because he had faith that God was more than able fulfill his word in his life because remember God had done had give him the cavalry of circumcision right that he would manifest the promise first day you'd receive the promise of Aliyah so now he had confidence that his faith work and God was going to deliver what he promised he would do I meant so now so now Abraham wasn't looking I mean he wasn't looking at the at the circumcised he staggered not at the promise of God pulled the ride Romans for I mean no his body did and all these things but but he was strong getting pricey God that he was more than able to perform that which he had promised to do but sit on the other hand was just singing like this she couldn't see it until Genesis 18 I mean when the Lord came down I mean to to to manifest himself I mean and when he began to speak about it coins a time of life you shall have the promised son I mean member that visitation was actually series visitation there was neighbor hence was should I for him already believe the promise I'll label you know room with dramatizing a bit you know is hot on that yeah I got you on the plains of Mamre there wasn't much you know for the cattle to eat it wasn't the wild ordered planes by Solomon you know and he and he said serum got a bit you know a bit fussy that caught a day and it was actually the devil trying to block the visitation of God himself but Abraham kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere oh yeah and then we come Ben finally finally hallelujah I mean I mean the visitation happened and serious heart was changed I mean from from just seeing the wood yeah you're just seeing the trees then finally she saw the promise because the God who gave the promise now came down to confirm the promise with her Aliyah and then as pulled of right about her divine commentary in Hebrews chapter 11 he said that she judged him faithful that she he was a new word said he had promised so that Sarah came from my heart you know I was changed from my belief into faith but now she judged him faithful that he could do it and it's the same with the church I met in the end time by Leah where where the churches be weighed 2,000 years for the promise on they need for us to meet him in there right but finally it is a people on the earth I mean that they have to be turned back to faith again back to the Word of God I mean that they will receive the promise on in the air will be changed just like Abraham need to be changed to produce the promise of the hour so our bodies will be changed to manifest the promise of the al-ayam in so I think we should just rejoice remember if we have received if we have received and then the Holy Ghost did every promise in the book is out amen now brother bird would make a comment here and he makes it in a few places of people kept your kind of twisties things around basis what did what they did a Pentecost what they had in the early Testament we got today and as soon as God can iron the thing out and the church get together the right we'll come but we can't even get faith the divine healing let alone direction now many people here whatever the devil will take this thought that we can't even get the faith for divine healing and so if we don't see divine healing manifested in our bodies did happen we have a body change right this is this how the devil twisted or not off you know you're still sick you prayed you believe it doesn't heal you can be a sec well if you're still sick you're gonna stay here upon the earth no other prophet so he says now notice the reason this court because with old twists us on he's going to answer why can't we even have rights the divine healing literature because we're all twisted up one this way one that way and dr. Sardo said there was this while my preacher said he was this see he's saying that because the word being medicine I mean wasn't a word I mean that would reduce faith for divine healing it wasn't faith you know wasn't a word that will produce the pressure and the people who was old to us adapt because what what was the what was the Prophet constantly fighting against the spirit of the land saying the days of miracles are fast the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a lot it's no really more than was having for the Apostles I mean healing is not doesn't work that way no he doesn't need to work that right now I had people tell me even in this day I mean when you know when I became the new Christian is that denominational people they would say to me well we are need miracles today because your your you know the you know these churches in around the world we need God the proves out that way no more you know we don't need them now sure all we need it is you know this is word but they're actually saying that God doesn't do the supernatural level but I've gone as a guard of the supernatural anything that is taught from the toll from the scripture if it's really a scriptural doctrine I mean God will back up supernaturally to praises because God is a God of the supernatural to be true Sam we can't even get phrase the divine healing little interaction because all the teaching the churches Jesus Christ the same yesterday I mean you can even read through the epistles of Paul and you can see the condition I mean of all those churches I mean our prison of the Saints days so so so the Corinthians everyone you know there's no heat ship if I had assignment you know something to say you've come with us all out of water they were putting up with sin in the church they were that way you're rallying around ministry summer some of Paul or Paul some of Christ's ministry making camps because you can see that Corinthians today right you can see the Ephesians to say yeah you can see the Ephesians today what was wrong with the Ephesians he had to remind them husbands love your wives wives love your husband's he had to actually pull them back down into everyday life right even though they're all filled with the Holy Ghost you know he could actually finally teach them big things which was good but he had to remind them husbands love your wives wives love your husband's how y'all family life is is is a reflection of the Himmelman assured of your everyday life has a deeper significance and you realize than just raising children having a family unit you're actually reflecting I'm in a heavenly merits I mean so how do you treat your spouse how you treat your children as actually the word manifested well it should be amen amen you go to the Thessalonians you know I'm in trouble you with you know you know a little by spirit away from all that the coming the Lord is already come and all these things you see you can see all those churches people are in that yo you can see the Galatians for sure that's an easy one right you know you can see all what because the book of X because during the book of X I mean those letters were written yeah right so you can see people around even individuals you can actually see their heart their a crimson I remember when the Corinthians were believers he's a Galatian she's a glacier I will believe us this life this alone I can believe it right you can you can see all those people I mean you can see it all living out tonight but we're now Jimmy I mean into full maturity amen just keep walking sorry saying here that you know soon now because member faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God and because the book has come up and that this message is preached in its fullness I mean that gives us then dinner releases a rupturing phrasing to the people Amen hallelujah and then you say well how do I know my faith I actually have the faith well I received the Holy Ghost that's the confirmation I mean this is a confirmations of the blame of personally hallelujah that God has received their faith and God will manifest the promise they are in their life the big difference from just being anointed as someone who's just anointed will in regard in the word that was right there I made those call during episode is just anointed I think that we'll stay right in but those should make that day God is sealed in their souls that will continue walking with rod and mature and more promises will open up I mean more the promise to the one will become alive and thereby become more like Christ that's why you go and I'll say this if you if you if you're wondering then seek the Lord about it and he'll tell you have a pity party all the bodies you can't Patty's are cancelled you know I miss her so just keep walking now but also what this knows God works in more than one way right we know God is not a cookie cutter you can take David's life for example very very elementary but after he used the sled against Goliath he doesn't use the sling again right they always sought the Lord more what why should I you know this language sometimes God just had no right here by the mobile trace to you until you hear the sound of the go and do this he always short the Lord I mean in every battle I mean he did just plow on and say well I'm just gonna do it again you know so the lotus-eyed Lord will still with them because he had to go all the way to the throne right and this son did had to sit on this earth rights is the same thing with us right we must have confidence I'm in this anointing this word has come upon us well tightness in Timonium right I will make us Lord Jesus throne is he right we'll do that I will be there wait wait wait crisis is the son of David as God over the earth king over the earth I mean we will sit with the man that Dominion and Ezra Holly and then now even now we are beginning to sort of make the mininum right because the Devils are now I'm dropping with risen higher even you know even even when Jesus you know he he said I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven and and brother Graham sees the reason that then he said that it's because he had just commissioned the church I mean to go heal the sick cause out the devils he just said them he dude the below your power and said them full and that's why Jesus said that because as soon as the church was equipped I made the causative laugh but they will found from his position and that was determined that was before the book came out for duty time be obvious enough now if cited in that position just because they were anointed to God cast out the devil people God makes it throwing place in the position of the people but no he says this and look he says when we heard these fine songs I said brother elbow I'm glad they've been taped because I like to study that I like to hear those songs and play the tape hear the songs when you can sit down there's nothing like music you know God heals by music the did you know that I live God heals by music God heals by love see God heals my medicine God heals by prayer God has many ways of healing on what type that you need and I want to emphasize that later sometimes a little love stretched out would just cure an old soul I'm an old place there's been a gradual something it'll heal it right over just a little wobbly little care sometimes when you feel little down and as we call a street expression down in the dumps II just one of those one of those tapes that music or record and go to playing it the first thing you know you're patting your foot or your hand it's all over then you're right up already to go again but notice he says God heals by many different ways but it depends on the type you need the tents depend on the top we want it depends upon type we you need gorgeous actually you need to be healed this way but the problem is if we are afraid like a cookie cutter kind of person walk don't repress you heal me if God's going to do this you're actually limiting God and your life now brother mom would speak about the so this is a pretty you can say it's the Euro ox of the angle of the man and Aladdin and what this picture represents is the 40 rooms around the throne and revelations four and five now we know that these anointings now what I like about the messages is any any any deep and you know any kind of thing that people would consider deep in a mystery it's going to become applicable to our everyday lives as brother John and II said on Tuesday I didn't where's the balance right we're gonna be all these things need to be applicable it's gonna go beyond that strict and a nice idea it's gonna come down to where we live I mean sorry so now we know that the 40 rooms around the throne I mean this was for anointings of the Holy Ghost that God poured out through the ages to come back I'm in the Antichrist firm so in the first age I mean we you know with the white horse rider go forth it was that empty cross for deception riding forth and we know it wasn't Christ because you compared that white horse rider the first yield to to the white horse rider in relations 19 and symbolically did not the same hitter Boehner arrows one headed chapter agent so that came out of his mouth one didn't heaven and the other one was hold the Word of God you can see all that's different so so that was a deception that rode forth an antichrist spread the red for the deception and so God anointed the church with a lion anointing the word I need to combat what they what the enemy was doing and after that when the when the Antichrist system actually gotta pound the government behind them with churches that was United now that any Christ verdict could control just being a deception but now I actually had physical military falls in the power of the state I need to persecute the church Church I mean engine and to enter and across role of people and the under day religion so of God anointed and and that was the age of the - Arthur God anointed the church with an ox and only King a sacrificial anointing that they could gladly gave their lives on in the arena or being tortured or ever was because they are anointed that way to overcome and then of course after that you know the black horse rider road Falls it was you know you know you're you know with the scales and a wit your measure of your wheat for a penny different things but there's a you catch the language of the people say well what is this got to do with how God heals well pre-assembly God has for you know sometimes God will supersu just heal us and that's not they lie in anointing conservationist touches our body the sickness leaves right I'm just gonna go an order of this picture here from right to left for some reason you know I sorry so sometimes God just super and she heals us and and and God touches us we know it was God and all the symptoms guy was just gone right hallelujah times God doesn't always heal us that way now what I want to limit doggy just a lion anointing healing I mean because I want all of God he heals us but I can go back to that it depends on what type that you need I got that bit underlined here in yellow it depends on the type you need right because it's all actually a way to build and develop because faith worketh patience I mean so now there has to be the patience pills in the church I mean because remember God has sent some leeches this all the time I need a job I need a house it just happens lord I need you know I'm sick poor this happens when we have patients become very impatient and unfortunately this is a very impatient age you know you search anything on Google it always tells you how many hits and and and how sugar target comes but yeah like I searched for this it was either how many millions of hits of pictures and it was like point four five of a second so it tells you how much and how quick but God isn't always that way because God is interested in our character not ass getting what we want I mean you take the man age you take the man anointing right sometimes God doesn't heal us decently but then sometimes it's it it can appear something very natural like house you diet are you getting enough sleep actually you know I'm winding at the end of the day I'm so trouble I'm all this you know you know I married hot dogs good like a medicine it appear to be a very natural thing but this is how God heals you know you know medicine is from God you know we should make medicine I mean cuz actually that might be girl wants to heal you well and and actually many times I'll say it this way many times people who refuse to go as a doctor a taxi pride but I'm I should need to go down use natural things I'm a supernatural being and did another actually can just be private right so God heals in those ways and then there's the eagle anointing I mean when I a second trouble that God just drops in a revelation lets you high above the thing and then you're free but it is also the Oxendine thing sometimes you actually have to do it will take you to death people who die with sickness and not unbelievers I made they died in faith right so some things that literally takes from us other things you're going to use man's remedies man's healing right change your diet get some more sleep unwind at the end of the day right go to the doctor take your medicine amen you see the prophets example was he an unbelievable is he wins the doctor but seen unbelievable is that Chiru is going to be cut out of the side of system ET not he was a believer he was a dog in position I meant but he always went to the doctor Amen sorry sorry that's that's another way God heals I'm gonna take this medication you might have to you can actually see all of the teeth we have to take everything if we if we can commit all our ways to the Lord right then it's actually God's given leadership in these different ways remember if the Lord didn't want you to take the medicine he would actually tell you it wouldn't be your pride saying no we sang him good there's a big difference between our pride leading us and God leading us amen so you know if he committed all as as as God's ways right then it's God leading you through these sense you know some this is for some reason we you know we could actually have to just Bay them for years and and they can come and go they can get worse and he you take the Apostle Paul here's the basis it's the H here the problem of desires all that you know that thing that profited him all the time please read that it came it came in at weight you know here he was Rosa did that incredible things mighty miracles are there by the hand to pull BAE et had this trouble with his eyes even they threatened his disciples sick in another place and he traveled to another place all these things happened you know but it wasn't because he was now believing that I believe he was a boy it was sealed away in the kingdom of issue and and he could see it coming all the us cried Lord please take it from me then finally at the end of his life his enemy was dead right Polly got the victory but all the way through his life he had to a duel that every about seven years of his life what's he an unbeliever no sickness in the body member the devil has a right to afflict our bodies but we not believe is because we're healthy oh you ready because I'm a clean bill of health no we not believe in their bodies a healthy is a right to afflict our bodies right here's a rock here's a right to trouble us in our minds you know singing you know yeah the promise is this is no-man's land this is actually a place of meeting of a battlefield about a non man's leg you can actually ambush and destroy your enemy Olivia I mean you just about no man's land like a worldly wife the enemy would come out of the trenches and and and those defending could just gunned them down because they had no real place to hide The Devil's got another place to hide again this was themself in here do you know that troubling thoughts and maybe something from your past aware maybe starting over here he's exposing himself just produces unbelief or tries to separate you from your friend you'll make you be an isolationist what is that is that God no identifying when he tries to give you a fourth amen and he's just he's just now pumping his he never brought the trench then you can take his health amen so he has a right to trouble us in our bodies sickness troubles in our spirit but he can't get our soul body can't get the soul of the believer I mean it's that's God's Dominion that's God's place so we get sick in our body we get sick and our buddy what happens the devil comes law by you're sick you can't be a believer and then we begin because what does he what is his ultimate goal try to make us think like him how does he think he's not a real believer right he's not a real believer this is how he thinks so he's trying to get us to think why can't we know the sons of God we don't believe it's our III you know we get sick he comes as long you can't be believing because you got sick I've got my metals he comes along says you know why because it's not me this is the place of meeting forces are fighting clashing even though but it can't the devil can't touch our soul he can't take our faith for months they can't take who we really are on the inside hallelujah always remember they're a new program was tenderizing in the Sun 1965 Hopkins heels of awkward and I was tied my I'm hitting me from shots that the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days oh I have to have these shots my son and I with the club will with color a yellow fever everything I was pretty weary give it making me sick which Caesar requires have these shots before you gone to another nation he said season that's what your seasons putting give to God that which is God's pretty good balance Dungy think so amen but then there's also times but then there's also times when when when God heals us but it's not a but it's not an innocent healing maybe but brother Aaron would say this difference between a miracle and actually divine healing right a miracles instant but then divine healing actually takes time you notices in mark 16 here at the end he says you shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so he says don't say that will instantly recover they shall recover no but so so now what happens is because we live in an instant age people have hands laid on evil day or they go and they are what he call you you know you know they they receive a promise of God and because it doesn't happen instantly because it seems to be a delay in the promise coming I mean then then that's the time when the deal because the whisper be is what must not have been real I mean because is it delayed it seems to be delayed but God is still working but it's like any promise of God it's going to be planted and then it's going to be watered and it is going to grow you know I would say what's good is there yeah you know I find out if he plants say sake potatoes or sweet corn or whatever it may be but then every day does open things up see if it's growing and actually just hinders its growth what but then when it's planted and he waters it takes the weight away and then he knows that that the harvest is on its way some things take longer yeah you know some things have a longer growing cycle than other plants what some promises can take longer than others there's still the same word right but we foods what has been positive us it's gotta be water with price and the labor ahead in December Daisy thank you lord my sons coming thank you lord my sons coming have a son he's on his way [Music] see to take God at His Word it means that you just believe what he's seeing and believe of heaven childlike faith right you know my children come along and now some thirsty they're expecting me to give me what you know they're expecting me to give them a drink 500 I want to hear this and they're waiting for my response because they know I have the answer right they know I have the ability to get them a glass of water I mean another I can give them a glass of water I can make them a sandwich rocket you know whatever I'm cold with childlike faith believing and knowing that I can meet their need I need to you know for us we've did the same kind of faith with God Lord must need well why you but but the very reason your eyes here is because you know he can fulfill that need and when you read the scripture I mean to take guard as well as as you realize their promises for you and he and he can do it and nothing else matters I think oh he just taking when Jesus said I do we believe all things are possible to live not believe I mean he said he's saying just believe it don't bring any consideration and anything else just only believe you believe it means it doesn't mean only believe and look at your circumstances or hon do you believe in look how smart you are only believe would look at maybe your track record I only believe in and see how much money have [Applause] [Applause] just look look through those things to the promise now I'll just I'll just read this coordinate and then we'll leave it here but this is in the restoration of the pride truth it says there is a Lord Christ that more is it men you can bury him in the to the deepest grave or the deepest sea or the lost he'll this is law of the Spirit of God that will raise him up again see why this is my resurrection I bought here's a law that its body is material it's earthbound it sits on the earth here but it has a laws that it that the way it spreads its wings again flight climb out of sight that's against science they claim it's earthbound gravitation has to hold it there but it can defy gravitation lift itself right off of it and go right on out because it has to put and because it has to put that law that's in it to work it's built to possess that it's built to possess a diamond he says non begin to feel religious now we have a law the law of life that's in us we've done only thing we have to know you are paid and born in place here in the body of Christ as sons and daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil we've got a law that's the law of the Holy spirt the only thing you do have to do is to know how to let go let God you keep fighting at it see when you let go make God that's all see if the officiate wait I'll catch my I'll breathe I believe lobster to me and I'll see if I can go down though he doesn't he'll burst open see ya you know the bird says I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll cool down see he's got to know how to control how the law can control him and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and pull and hurry and offer I don't get this if I don't get that that's not that's not it it is to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the Spirit or anything that he's promised any claim he's given us yours by letting go and letting God see it's not what we do I'm gonna get this okay that I've got a kid trouble preaches I'm gonna catch what's going up there catch the dick so we're done just let go and they take you God told Abraham all the way to a body change receiving the promise of amen God - Joshua live from slavery I mean into his position I mean God will take us all if we just make on the dollar man wants to be in control of so many things though I understand enough with my cord enough you know you know am i deep enough yo just let go and if you late guard in the spirit of truth will lead you and guide you until turn I meant that you know Desiree we just sit in the corner I'll listen to anything in operating our bowels not but we just walk with God by let him take you there we get so frustrated with this lake dog and God will take you to take you to the [Applause] and any claim any claim he's given as yours by letting gone leading God every promise in the book is ours any claim he's given as yours by letting go letting God hallelujah I mean we'll just leave it there I mean um this morning but just like God takes you to whatever your beat off hallelujah I'll fight you receive the Holy Ghost that means gone has received your face and and that faith will produce to promise the error itself so we don't have the push-and-pull worry and stress not just walk with God for the purpose of the eye has he not yesterday you know we get so right about things you know you know some people get so cool it up and oh my be foolish bridge and I'm happy this I'm gonna make it but anymore I'll say friend the reason you have that in your mind is because because you because you're otherwise remember the foolish ones don't kid they have their church waste you know they just don't you know that you'll never miss its culture they have a church culture they just continue on but the wise one will in the ellipse I mean they are concerned they are convinced and concerned but but but the fools are worried I mean this you know there's a story of numbers and sorry I said out stuff but I'm going on yeah I'm probably ways badly but you know there are five daughters in the book of numbers and they have no brothers they're you're their father died in the wilderness and the murchison signed it that our father died in a you know in his own sins we had not brothers to receive in Herod's so we have that inheritance in the promised land this is the five wise virgins right here they actually come I mean they come to a prophet saying well actually in the word we can't receive any because we're not a man but we wanted here in terms of the Jordan well along with the rest of us means that there's a lot of to you but just let God let God take you to it hey man that's all we're gonna let go and they taught me because the law of life of the believer and even though so foolish that I'll never have a bird not just float on within one ounce I mean but I believe I'm looking at the foolish I'm looking at the wise man I mean this just now he's in a word of Prayer shall we I'll leave then we'll attend the service back over to brother Isaac will sing a few songs and if you want to be a remember to pray just want to raise your hands to the Lord I mean let's pray together gracious Heavenly Father Lord you see the hands that have been raised Lord we see Lord and you see the heart behind those hands are gone father just prayed Lord Jesus did God we just have such confidence in you Laura found hard to be turned to real faith Lord Jesus you've given us your Holy Spirit though we know that all our faith is being received by you Lord just like Abraham received the seal of circumcision is a confirmation of his faith show us today receive the Holy Ghost as a confirmation that our faith is being received and Lord I pray father we just walk with such confidence in you from this moment on Lord Mary realized Flores as his faith was confirmed by circumcision and he received the promise of this day so our baby's been confirmed by receiving the Holy Ghost and it will benefits the promise of the day which is a change in the body the Lord also that thought I believe probably gonna see Philippian jailer was told to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as my house shall be saved Lord has the same faith II had returned celebration then he plead for his for his family Lord and I came in as well what we want to believe one another we want to believe her children wanna bleed forever brothers the citizen I believe for the protocol Lord Jesus we know a little bit how people may be on the outside but I believe beyond the trees Lord or maybe the Scarecrow's and the lie and the sickness and the fear the things that they'll try to put in front of us Lord to look to take our vision of the promise away but those things Lord and look to the promise of God and we'll keep keep our eyes on every promise Lord Jesus that you've given us because you've given us many and you give it a straight to know that both of those poses with benefits in our lives so father I pray we would press on in the name of Jesus Christ the power of the famous within us but Lord may we let go and then you take us to every promise are gone father may God bless each one made every made here father take old doubts and worries away I pray from your people increase y'all crazy character god father lord I believe we're living in an area where there's a people on the earth that only believe your word father I believe I'm looking at them now Lord probably can actually take you you were both at you promised it to us individually not to someone else for the promises to us Lord I remember when I Lord was there lost undone I really acts 2:38 after listening to the message I think the first time I said to you Lord are being baptized the name of Jesus Christ that I know what repentance is but Lord you see if this hat or one of this is fulfilled in my life at that then I have to receive your Holy Ghost law and law by your grace I believe that precedes it you've changed me forever Lord can we just all just take you your word like that Lord Jesus nothing I'm anything but Lord you're the one who gives the faith you're the one that reveals it but law man we see that the promises house and the deal has no right to hold any promise from us so father I pray Lord baby bless each one Lord we thank you we can be gathered here and I pray Lord next Sunday we'll be ever in church her God granted father in Jesus Christ's name Amen hey man go bless your friends I mean god bless you brother Isaac I'll turn the silver some deeper god bless you amen praise the Lord thank you brother beam it's exciting to be part of the promises of God into - just to be living in a time to see everything come to pass you know and then not only in a natural sense but spiritually - to see in our own spiritual walks all these promises are all everything is just coming alive the way that the Lord said that it would aim in the way that the word said that it would it's um let's sing the day of redemption is near I just was going to another [Music] [Music] it's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's just closing prayer this afternoon Lord Jesus we thank you for the word that we've heard Lord and how that we see these examples thought of how by faith that promise was attained Lord and we we just thank you Lord that you've granted faith to us Lord or may we just lay hold upon these things and continue to walk into all they have for us Lord an end even those rather beans closing statements were about just letting go letting you Lord Jesus not being flustered but knowing Lord that is your your your faith and I saw the faith of the Son of God Lord that's bringing all these things are possible so Lord we just we just want to have all that you have for us Lord Jesus we thank you Lord is such an exciting time to be living in Lord to see slowly all around us means hearts are failing for fear Lord and this is this great turmoil happening in this world Lord but we can look up Lord our Redemption draws near and to see that that it's under these conditions that all your promises are gonna come to pass Lord so we just thank you for the time that we're loving when we thank you that we can be living in this our Lord that's that's the worst time for Humanity but it's the best time for the for the sons and daughters of God Lord so we just thank you for that Lord and we just want to pray bless each one this week as they go about their different things and just some thank you so much for calling and choosing each one of us Lord we just want to commit ourselves to you in Jesus wonderful name amen amen god god bless you all you are dismissed in Jesus name [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
