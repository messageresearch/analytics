[45:56] amen god bless you all it's good to have
[45:59] all the visitors here welcoming every
[46:00] one of you tries to feel at home
[46:02] amen unless just um this is go to
[46:05] Ephesians chapter two then we're going
[46:15] to go to Hebrews 12 again I want to just
[46:21] kind of continue want to continue on my
[46:28] thought about let us run but I want to
[46:31] take just the one other part of Hebrews
[46:35] 12 there but let's just go to it's got
[46:39] Ephesians two first two in verse 13
[46:48] where we down to verse 18 it says but
[46:53] now in Christ Jesus you who are some
[46:56] time we were far off are made nigh by
[46:58] the blood of Christ for he is our peace
[47:01] was broken who has made one and hath
[47:04] broken down the middle wall of partition
[47:05] between us having abolished in his flesh
[47:08] the enmity having even the law of
[47:11] Commandments contained in the ordinances
[47:13] for to make in himself of Twain one new
[47:16] man so making peace that he might
[47:19] reconcile both under God and one body by
[47:22] the cross having slain the enmity dear
[47:24] by and came and preached peace to you
[47:26] which were afar off and to them that
[47:28] were nigh for through him we both have
[47:31] access by one spirit unto the father
[47:35] let's go to Hebrews 12 and verse 1 then
[47:42] we'll just read verses 1 & 2 again
[47:47] this is wherefore seeing we also are
[47:51] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[47:54] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[47:56] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[47:58] and let us run with patience the race
[48:01] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[48:03] the author and finisher of our faith who
[48:05] for the joy that was set before him
[48:07] endured the cross despising the shame
[48:09] and is set down at the right hand of the
[48:12] throne of God
[48:13] I mean God bless you all you may be
[48:15] seated today the prints of the Lord I'd
[48:18] like to take a if I could take a title I
[48:21] want to speak about the cloud of
[48:24] witnesses but I just want to really the
[48:27] take home thought today if you're
[48:28] wondering where I'm going with this
[48:30] is that when you die it just changes
[48:33] your dwelling place what you are now
[48:35] you'll be there right so that's
[48:39] basically where I'm going to go now we
[48:42] read there in in Ephesians 2 that our
[48:46] Lord Jesus when he died on Calvary that
[48:48] his blood his sacrifice bridged the gulf
[48:51] between God and men and that gulf came
[48:54] into came into being when when Adam and
[48:56] Eve felt and it was a blood sin in the
[48:59] garden then there was a chasm between
[49:00] God and man as I spoke about last Sunday
[49:03] of Heaven was effectively cut off for a
[49:06] man that man was basically a slave slave
[49:09] to the devil but but when God became
[49:11] flesh and dwelt among us and offered his
[49:14] blood on Calvary he bridged the gulf
[49:16] between God and man and that heaven
[49:18] became open to man once again and so now
[49:22] if we read let's just go to Hebrews
[49:25] chapter 10 I just want to read a few a
[49:27] few scriptures today but the blood of
[49:30] bulls and goats we we find when Paul as
[49:32] Paul is placing the the Old Testament
[49:35] and he's telling these Hebrews what what
[49:38] they had under the Old Testament he
[49:40] would he will contrast that what we have
[49:42] now is greater than what they had he's
[49:44] always making that contrast any because
[49:48] he shows that the you know the high
[49:49] priest we have of Jesus Christ it's
[49:52] better than earthly priesthood and that
[49:54] the blood of Jesus Christ is greater
[49:56] than the blood of bulls and goats and he
[49:58] sees here in Hebrews 10 and 1 for the
[50:00] or having a shadow of good things to
[50:02] come and not the very image of the
[50:04] things can never with those sacrifices
[50:06] which they offered year by year
[50:08] continually make the comers thereunto
[50:10] perfect for then would they not have
[50:14] ceased to be offered because that the
[50:16] worshipers once purged should have no
[50:19] more conscious of sins but in those
[50:21] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[50:23] made of sins every year for it is not
[50:25] possible that the blood of bulls and
[50:27] goats should take away sin so he's
[50:30] saying that it's impossible for all of
[50:33] the animal sacrifices they gave all of
[50:35] the ordinances they went through it
[50:36] didn't change the nature of the people
[50:39] it did not take away the sin it just
[50:41] covered their sins over but the very
[50:44] nature the Fallen nature that man
[50:46] inherited through the fall we're still
[50:48] in the Israelite people I mean it was
[50:50] still in the believers in the Old
[50:52] Testament even David David was a man
[50:54] after God's own heart and he said I keep
[50:56] keep yo the Lord always before my face
[50:59] least I sin against him and he you know
[51:01] so he had a desire to serve the Lord and
[51:04] he was a man after God's own heart but
[51:06] then when he sure saw Bathsheba yo
[51:09] having a bath on a rooftop that evening
[51:11] all of that left him all of that was
[51:14] pushed to one side because he had a
[51:15] carnal nature that he could not overcome
[51:17] under the blood of bulls and goats it
[51:19] could not the blood of bulls and goats
[51:21] could not change that carnal desire so
[51:23] when sin presented itself no matter how
[51:26] sincere he was how much wanted how much
[51:28] he wanted to serve the Lord he could not
[51:31] overcome that fallen nature that he had
[51:33] a means so now this is true all the way
[51:38] down and it shows very easily that man
[51:42] even even in this modern era unless the
[51:45] life of God really comes upon you you we
[51:48] may have the right intentions to be
[51:50] Christians we've had may have the right
[51:51] to the desire to serve God and why don't
[51:54] you know go to church and have a real
[51:56] sincere desire you know but unless God
[51:58] changes you unless God changes that
[52:01] nature then you will still fall and fail
[52:04] you will still be face down your slave
[52:06] to sin and that's why it's more than
[52:09] just confessing I believe in Calvary but
[52:11] this life that was released there
[52:13] through the blood has to come
[52:15] to you and change you that must happen
[52:17] it must bus must be more than just a
[52:19] confession but you must really possess
[52:21] or really have the life that was
[52:23] released amen because if we are
[52:26] Christians it's not us living anymore
[52:28] but Christ that lives in us I mean so
[52:31] our actions how we dress the things we
[52:33] say the things we do all of that is not
[52:35] governed by our desires governed by his
[52:37] desire and by his life amen it's like a
[52:40] lady that is pregnant with a baby you
[52:42] know they begin to get cravings right
[52:44] they begin to eat things maybe they
[52:46] never really liked before because and
[52:48] they do things that they wouldn't do I
[52:50] mean I mean they stop doing certain
[52:52] things because they want to protect the
[52:54] life that's within them
[52:55] so the life that's growing with them
[52:57] them is dictating to them what they eat
[52:59] and what they do and is the same thing
[53:02] with the Christian life when the life of
[53:04] God comes into you not just imagining it
[53:07] but it really does and that life will
[53:09] dictate to you what you do Amen what you
[53:12] eat spiritually add naturally you know
[53:14] all those things because there's a life
[53:16] that is stronger than your own because
[53:18] you have given your will over to his
[53:21] will amen so now there was this great
[53:26] gulf but the blood of Jesus Christ has
[53:28] has bridge that gulf now it says in
[53:32] Hebrews 9 and 22 I just read it and
[53:35] almost all things are by the law purged
[53:38] with blood and without shedding of blood
[53:41] there is no remission and that word
[53:44] remission means there is no means
[53:46] freedom it means a pardon a deliverance
[53:49] of forgiveness a Liberty so it says
[53:52] without the shedding of blood there's no
[53:53] freedom
[53:54] there's no pardon there's no deliverance
[53:57] so there must blood had to be shed in
[53:59] order to free the human race blood had
[54:02] to be shed to for us to be free from our
[54:05] fallen your human human nature that we
[54:08] had now man when he is born we are born
[54:12] fallen we're born lost right and so we
[54:16] are born with a carnal nature we receive
[54:18] it from our parents from our culture you
[54:20] know from our surroundings those things
[54:22] molars a certain way and you see family
[54:25] traits you know down through from
[54:26] grandparents down the way to you know
[54:28] to grandchildren that's because there's
[54:30] in our genetic DNA you know and in our
[54:33] spirituality in albia because there's a
[54:35] family spirit that comes down through
[54:36] that is passed down through so we're
[54:38] born in that fallen state but we cannot
[54:41] get to heaven in that state Amen we
[54:44] cannot expect to take a rapture in that
[54:46] state that's why Jesus said you must be
[54:49] born again right and being borning it is
[54:51] not just saying a sinner's prayer and
[54:53] staying in that state that may be the
[54:54] beginning of your walk but being born
[54:56] again as your actually your heart your
[54:59] very being who you are what you like
[55:01] what you do your very nature is change
[55:03] Amen with a person you once were you no
[55:05] longer that person Amen so that must be
[55:09] the case brother Graham says in the
[55:11] present stage of my ministry in 62 he
[55:13] says now then you see Christians when he
[55:15] dies he goes under the altar of God
[55:17] right into the presence of God under the
[55:19] altar and he's at rest it is to break it
[55:22] down when a man has a nightmare
[55:24] he's not altogether asleep neither is he
[55:26] awake he's between sleep and awake and
[55:29] that's what makes him having a horrible
[55:31] shaking and screaming because he's not
[55:33] asleep he's not awake and to take that
[55:35] shows where a man goes when he dies
[55:38] unconverted he's lived this time up he's
[55:41] dead on the earth he cannot go in the
[55:43] presence of God because he's not fit to
[55:44] go there without the blood and he's
[55:46] caught and he cannot come back to earth
[55:49] because as times finished here on the
[55:51] earth and he's caught between and he's
[55:53] in a nightmare see he can't go into the
[55:55] prints of God to rest he can't come back
[55:57] to earth because his times up he's in a
[56:00] nightmare and there he stays until the
[56:03] day of judgment a horrible thing to be
[56:05] and see so he says without the blood of
[56:08] Jesus Christ you cannot go to the
[56:11] presence of God and effectively the
[56:13] people are stuck in a night me when they
[56:15] died he said that's a horrible picture
[56:17] because it is a horrible thing amen but
[56:20] we remember we have a blood this morning
[56:23] we have an atonement this morning where
[56:26] we do not have to you know go into
[56:28] basically a nightmare until the day of
[56:29] judgment but we can go into the very
[56:31] presence of God now I just want to
[56:35] really show you that people when they
[56:38] die they don't sleep you know many
[56:41] people think of
[56:42] all sleeping basically that when people
[56:44] die they basically sleep like we do
[56:46] naturally they're not conscious of
[56:48] what's going around them you know but
[56:50] their sleep until the day of judgment
[56:51] but that is not scripturally so it's got
[56:54] to first Thessalonians 4 I'm going to
[56:55] show you a few things basically here's
[56:59] the some of my sermon if you love him
[57:01] here you'll love him there
[57:02] Amen if you believe in them here you'll
[57:04] believe in them there if you love as
[57:06] presence here you'll love it there if
[57:07] you shut when he anointed comes down
[57:09] you'll be shouting there Amen with you
[57:11] know but if you don't love him here you
[57:13] weren't loving there if your data here
[57:16] you'll be ad out of there if your ass
[57:17] corner here you'll be a scorner there if
[57:19] you're a scoffer here you'll be a
[57:20] scoffer there if you're an unbeliever
[57:22] here you'll be an unbeliever there the
[57:24] nature that you die was is a nature you
[57:26] will still have over there amen so but
[57:30] that's why you say that's a pretty
[57:32] negative kind of way of putting it no
[57:33] because there's a blood this morning
[57:36] amen there's an offering Amen there's a
[57:38] Living God that can change your nature I
[57:41] mean not just cover your sins but
[57:43] obliterate your sense a mentor they're
[57:45] not late to your charge anymore that
[57:47] should you die right now you're going to
[57:49] go straight into his presence amen we
[57:53] have that assurance now 1st
[57:55] Thessalonians 4 and 13 he says but I
[57:58] would not have you to be ignorant
[58:01] brethren concerning them which are
[58:04] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[58:07] others which have no hopes are going
[58:10] 1st Thessalonians 4:13 down to 17 for we
[58:14] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[58:15] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[58:18] will God bring in them for this we say
[58:21] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[58:23] which are alive and remain unto the
[58:25] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[58:26] them which are asleep for the Lord
[58:28] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[58:30] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[58:32] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[58:34] Christ shall rise first then we which
[58:36] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[58:38] together with them in the clouds to meet
[58:40] the lord in the air so shall we ever be
[58:42] with the Lord wherefore comfort one
[58:44] another with these words and if we we
[58:46] won't read it at the same time continue
[58:48] reading the next you know chapter 5 and
[58:50] Paul is still speaking about the same
[58:52] thing he says brethren you know this day
[58:55] will not
[58:56] take you as a thief Amen because you're
[58:59] not of the night you're not of the you
[59:00] know you know you know those that are in
[59:02] the night sleep their drunken but ye are
[59:04] children of the light you're children of
[59:06] the day a mess you're saying this day
[59:08] will not overtake those who are alive
[59:10] for awake
[59:11] I mean who remain how do you remain you
[59:13] are in the present truth you're walking
[59:15] with him I mean that's how you because
[59:17] everyone is alive naturally but you
[59:20] remain is to remain in the truth I mean
[59:23] such as we read there there's a couple
[59:24] times we said they are asleep you ever
[59:27] read that in verse 13 and verse 15 but
[59:30] that word asleep and I'm going to show
[59:32] you the word did as well as to sleep it
[59:35] says to slumber and that is actually to
[59:38] be dead to be deceased that's the that's
[59:41] the definition and then now when we go
[59:43] down to let's go to mark chapter 5 I'm
[59:46] just going to show you how these you
[59:48] know we read you know these here we read
[59:50] asleep we can read it but in the Greek
[59:52] it can be very different things right so
[59:55] we're just going to do a bit of a bit of
[59:58] a Bible study if that's okay because we
[1:00:01] got to understand you know this life is
[1:00:05] but a vapor and life continues on either
[1:00:09] place you go wherever you choose to go
[1:00:12] you'll still be alive
[1:00:13] amen and Eliezer be a glorious thing it
[1:00:18] would be a horrible thing but I love it
[1:00:22] how God is a gentleman he doesn't force
[1:00:24] anything upon you he doesn't make you
[1:00:26] get to heaven he gives you a choice Amen
[1:00:29] he gives us free moral choice and so we
[1:00:32] can choose you say what about
[1:00:33] predestination God knows who's going to
[1:00:35] be there but yet in time he gives you
[1:00:37] choice Amen God knows the end from the
[1:00:39] beginning cuz he's outside of time but
[1:00:41] within time he gives you a choice
[1:00:44] Alleluia I'm glad he gives you a choice
[1:00:47] Amen now mark 5 and 35 this is the story
[1:00:50] of Jesus going to two dry seas house and
[1:00:55] to raise his daughter now while he yet
[1:00:57] spake there came we're just going to
[1:01:00] jump halfway through the story while yet
[1:01:01] he spikes a mark 5 35 down to verse 42
[1:01:04] while he expect there came the ruler of
[1:01:06] the synagogue's house certain which said
[1:01:09] they do
[1:01:10] did why trouble saw the master any
[1:01:12] further as soon as Jesus heard the word
[1:01:14] that was spoken he said unto the rule of
[1:01:16] the synagogue be not afraid only believe
[1:01:19] and he suffered no man to follow him
[1:01:22] save Peter and James and John the
[1:01:24] brother of James and he cometh to the
[1:01:26] house of the ruler of the synagogue and
[1:01:28] see if the tumult and then that wept and
[1:01:30] wailed greatly and when he was coming he
[1:01:33] said unto them why make ye thus adieu
[1:01:36] and weep that the damsel is not dead but
[1:01:39] sleepeth they laughed him to scorn but
[1:01:42] when he had put all of them out he
[1:01:44] taketh the father and the mother of the
[1:01:45] damsel and then that were with them and
[1:01:49] entered where the damsel was lying and
[1:01:51] he took the damsel by the hand and he
[1:01:53] said unto her
[1:01:56] Talitha I don't know how to pronounce
[1:01:59] that which is being interpreted damns
[1:02:00] lice out of the rice and straightaway
[1:02:03] the damsel arose and walked and she was
[1:02:06] of the age of twelve years and they were
[1:02:09] astonished with great astonishment and
[1:02:11] he charged them straightly that no man
[1:02:13] should know it and commanded that
[1:02:15] something should be given her to eat so
[1:02:17] now there's come a report that the
[1:02:19] damsel is did and she died she literally
[1:02:23] died but Jesus is saying well then why
[1:02:26] would Jesus say she sleepeth but is not
[1:02:28] dead
[1:02:28] it's because the word did we read it
[1:02:32] means that means dead death you know to
[1:02:34] be slant but it denotes a separation a
[1:02:37] departure amen a completion so did in
[1:02:42] the Bible language isn't he as a total
[1:02:45] separation from God that you cannot come
[1:02:48] back to earth amen but you have you've
[1:02:50] gone to your eternal destination that is
[1:02:52] real death right it is eternal
[1:02:55] separation of God that is real death
[1:02:57] right but for her to be asleep sleep at
[1:03:01] there so so she is so Jesus saying she
[1:03:04] hasn't gone there but she's just dead
[1:03:07] amen he following me so when Jesus when
[1:03:11] Jesus and John chapter 6 and verse 48 he
[1:03:15] would say I am the bread of life so
[1:03:17] Jesus is speaking to the scribes and
[1:03:19] Pharisees and they said our fathers
[1:03:21] ain't better in the wilderness you know
[1:03:22] had the splitting rock they had Moses
[1:03:24] and Jesus says I am that bread of life
[1:03:26] your father's deep did eat manna in the
[1:03:29] wilderness and I did this is the bread
[1:03:32] which came down from heaven that a man
[1:03:33] may eat thereof and not die I am The
[1:03:36] Living bread which came down from heaven
[1:03:38] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:03:40] live forever and the bread that I will
[1:03:43] give is my flesh which I will give for
[1:03:45] the life of the world so this this word
[1:03:48] here that there that they did means they
[1:03:51] are turn lis separated from God they
[1:03:53] were they they spurn their mercy they
[1:03:56] did not believe that God could take them
[1:03:57] into the Promised Land they believed the
[1:04:00] evil report of the spies though they
[1:04:02] received the blessings of God amen they
[1:04:04] saw the supernatural hand of God to
[1:04:06] deliver them right they were delivered
[1:04:08] out of Egypt
[1:04:09] yeah Paul speaks around the book of
[1:04:10] Hebrews so they came all the way out of
[1:04:12] Egypt under the mighty hand of God by
[1:04:15] the word of a prophet they received the
[1:04:17] you know the you know the law and the
[1:04:19] law was a was a right approach to God
[1:04:21] with the offerings and the sacrifices
[1:04:23] and all those things but yet they fully
[1:04:25] didn't go into the arrest into their
[1:04:27] inheritance safe because they
[1:04:29] disbelieved God during their journey and
[1:04:32] Jesus and they all had to die in the
[1:04:35] wilderness because of their unbelief and
[1:04:36] Jesus is the everyone did they're all
[1:04:38] separated their God they meant that's
[1:04:41] why he's meeting by did and so so a real
[1:04:48] death is eternal separation from God
[1:04:49] member there's two places we can go this
[1:04:51] may be very elementary it may be you
[1:04:54] know just take it for what it is okay so
[1:04:59] there's two places we go there is there
[1:05:03] is heaven and we'll and I'll show you in
[1:05:05] the Old Testament there's a place called
[1:05:06] Paradise was Jesus emptied out because
[1:05:09] under the bull under the blood of bulls
[1:05:11] and goats man could not go into the
[1:05:12] presence of God they had to go to a
[1:05:14] place called Paradise because there was
[1:05:16] still the sins they did were only
[1:05:18] covered amen so the Satan still had an
[1:05:21] accusation against them but when the
[1:05:23] blood of Jesus Christ came he cleared
[1:05:25] the dead
[1:05:26] amen he led captivity captive he
[1:05:28] ascended on high we'll read about it in
[1:05:30] the book of Ephesians he emptied out
[1:05:32] paradise and so man was waiting there
[1:05:36] the redeemed were waiting under that
[1:05:37] place so they were waiting there but in
[1:05:40] the lost who who rejected what God has
[1:05:43] done they went into the one is called
[1:05:45] Hades the grave which is the regions of
[1:05:47] the lost mean but there's no blazing
[1:05:49] hell right now that's the lake of fire
[1:05:53] okay so now so when people I'm going to
[1:05:57] show you a few scriptures to show when
[1:05:58] people die they are not like a sleep
[1:06:00] like we sleep okay so let's go to first
[1:06:04] Peter 3 and 18 first Peter 3 and 18 so
[1:06:20] if you wanted a shouting rejoicing time
[1:06:22] maybe the wrong weekend but we'll see
[1:06:24] how we go okay but at the moment just
[1:06:28] bear with me bear with me because you
[1:06:30] got to understand what you are now if
[1:06:32] you redeem now you're redeemed there
[1:06:34] amen if you love him here you love his
[1:06:36] presence you'll love it there amen
[1:06:39] that's why it's so glorious if you have
[1:06:41] if you're sealed unto the day of your
[1:06:43] Redemption by the Holy Spirit which you
[1:06:45] can see in your life amen it's as good
[1:06:47] as if you're in heaven now it's as good
[1:06:50] as if you're on the throne now because
[1:06:52] you have what you need to get there and
[1:06:54] remembrance by his Spirit you'll get
[1:06:56] there right so if you haven't if you're
[1:06:59] not just a professor but you really
[1:07:01] possess eternal life amen it doesn't
[1:07:03] matter what happens to you life can go
[1:07:06] terrible you know you can you know it
[1:07:09] doesn't matter how bad things may get
[1:07:10] you happy you possess eternal life I
[1:07:13] mean we don't just talk about it we
[1:07:15] really haven't hallelujah so it's a
[1:07:17] glorious thing so now it says in first
[1:07:19] Peter 3 and 18 so this is when Jesus
[1:07:21] remember he he he went to Calvary on our
[1:07:24] behalf he died in our place he purchased
[1:07:27] our Redemption and then they took his
[1:07:29] body and they put it in the tomb but
[1:07:31] Jesus didn't stay there I mean Jesus it
[1:07:34] says now for Christ also has suffered
[1:07:37] once for sins and the just for the
[1:07:40] unjust and we are the unjust he suffered
[1:07:42] for us that he might bring us to God
[1:07:44] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:07:47] quickened by the spirit by which also
[1:07:50] he went and preached unto the spirits in
[1:07:52] prison that would sometimes were
[1:07:54] disobedient when once the long-suffering
[1:07:56] of God waited in the days of Noah while
[1:08:00] the ark was preparing wherein few that
[1:08:02] is eight souls were saved by water so
[1:08:05] the people that that that hurt Noah's
[1:08:07] message but they laughed at him because
[1:08:09] it sounded ridiculous member never
[1:08:11] rained in those days only a Jew fell
[1:08:13] upon the earth there was no rain and
[1:08:15] here's a man saying I'm building a boat
[1:08:17] the world is going to be covered in
[1:08:20] water and they'd say that's ridiculous
[1:08:22] our scientists have proven that there's
[1:08:25] no rain we have never observed the day
[1:08:27] of rain how you think it's going to how
[1:08:29] you think it's going to you know flood
[1:08:32] he says because God told me and they
[1:08:34] would have been member man has always
[1:08:36] been religious so they would have been
[1:08:39] religious back then as well and they
[1:08:41] would have gone to their churches or
[1:08:42] whatever they did and said now Oh
[1:08:44] prophets Oracle's or priests whatever
[1:08:46] they're called has has our gods ever
[1:08:48] told us it's going to rain I said no
[1:08:50] it's not in our Bible it's not the
[1:08:53] accepted religion of the day and they
[1:08:55] would say no you're mad but he wasn't
[1:08:57] mad he wasn't mad and so those people
[1:09:02] turned down their day of mercy and when
[1:09:06] they drown in the flood they would they
[1:09:08] went out and they were in prison waiting
[1:09:10] for the day of judgment so they so Jesus
[1:09:13] yo you don't preach to sleeping people
[1:09:15] maybe I do from time to time but when he
[1:09:19] went he went down there to the regions
[1:09:21] of the lost the souls are in prison and
[1:09:23] preach the church service to them he
[1:09:26] preached to them and they heard what he
[1:09:28] said right so they were they were alive
[1:09:31] not not in these kind of bodies but they
[1:09:33] were conscious right they knew what was
[1:09:36] going on and they heard him preach they
[1:09:39] were not asleep as we would think
[1:09:41] sleeping okay cuz when you're asleep
[1:09:44] you're not aware what's going on around
[1:09:46] you okay and then let's go to revelation
[1:09:50] 6 and 9
[1:10:02] revelation 6 and 9 that is it now
[1:10:10] remember I just read it this is the so
[1:10:14] the book of Revelation Revelation
[1:10:15] chapter 1 it's a book of symbols what
[1:10:17] John is told what he sees right in a
[1:10:20] book it's an inn you know and it's a
[1:10:21] book of prophecy so it's a symbolic book
[1:10:23] just like the Book of Daniel but notice
[1:10:25] this that when he had opened the fifth
[1:10:26] seal sets Christ opens the seals the
[1:10:28] Lamb of God I saw under the altar souls
[1:10:31] of them that were slain for the word of
[1:10:34] God and for the testimony which they
[1:10:36] helped and they cried with a loud voice
[1:10:38] saying how long O Lord holy and true
[1:10:40] does thou not judge and avenge our blood
[1:10:43] on them that dwell on the earth and
[1:10:45] white robes were given unto every one of
[1:10:47] them and it was said unto them that they
[1:10:50] should rest yet for a little season
[1:10:51] until their fellow-servants also and
[1:10:54] their brethren that should be killed as
[1:10:56] they were should be fulfilled now we
[1:11:00] have a group of people here that have
[1:11:02] been killed right and they are actually
[1:11:04] calling on God so they're actually say
[1:11:07] they are prey they are calling on God
[1:11:10] when are they going to be avenged so
[1:11:12] they're not asleep
[1:11:13] I'm just you say well you're repeating
[1:11:16] yourself I really want to emphasize this
[1:11:17] because these people we understand now
[1:11:20] they had now let's just break this down
[1:11:21] a little bit so they are slain for the
[1:11:23] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:11:26] they held now if we go to revelations
[1:11:28] one and one we read this so these people
[1:11:32] are Jews okay that they I'm going to
[1:11:34] paint the picture to show you that this
[1:11:35] is true now the revelations one and one
[1:11:37] so they remember they had that Word of
[1:11:39] God and for the testimony which they had
[1:11:41] now but if we go to revelations 1 and 1
[1:11:44] it says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:11:45] which God gave unto him to show unto him
[1:11:48] unto his servants things which must
[1:11:50] shortly come to pass and he sent and he
[1:11:53] signified it by his angel unto his
[1:11:55] servant John who bare record of the word
[1:11:57] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[1:12:00] Christ and of all the things that he saw
[1:12:03] so John had the Word of God but he had
[1:12:07] the testimony of Jesus
[1:12:09] because John is a Christian a believer
[1:12:11] but these other ones is unsay Eve it
[1:12:14] doesn't say any record of them having a
[1:12:15] testimony of Jesus Christ right because
[1:12:18] the because the Jews do not have a
[1:12:20] testimony of Jesus Christ they just
[1:12:22] believed the Old Testament because they
[1:12:23] were blinded that we would come in I
[1:12:25] mean they were they were blinded that we
[1:12:27] could come in but then notice also their
[1:12:30] their cry how long O Lord holy and true
[1:12:32] does thou not judge and avenge our blood
[1:12:34] on them that dwell on the earth so
[1:12:37] here's a people that are crying out for
[1:12:38] vengeance amen and we know the believer
[1:12:43] hello believers do not cry out for
[1:12:45] revenge they do not cry out that what
[1:12:48] God would settle their score or deal
[1:12:50] with the person that's used them wrong
[1:12:52] you know that is not the Hutt's Craver
[1:12:54] believer because we even see Jesus when
[1:12:57] he's hanging on Calvary he says Father
[1:12:59] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:13:01] do and the same life should be in you
[1:13:03] amen and Stephen Whitty
[1:13:05] when he was starting there in Acts
[1:13:06] chapter 7 he as his in verse 60 of Acts
[1:13:10] 7 it says and he kneeled down and cried
[1:13:12] with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin
[1:13:14] to their charge and when he said this he
[1:13:17] fell asleep he died I mean so that was
[1:13:19] the cry of the believers do not do not
[1:13:22] lay this sin upon upon them because it
[1:13:25] believer knows the severity of the
[1:13:27] punishment of sin Amen do we not amen if
[1:13:30] God had to become flesh and the wrath
[1:13:33] the the judgment that we deserve was
[1:13:35] poured out upon him that he was mud
[1:13:38] beyond any man on Calvary the severity
[1:13:41] of God's wrath was poured out upon a son
[1:13:43] on Calvary amen and he took our place
[1:13:46] and because of that severity of that
[1:13:48] judgment and we know how horrible it
[1:13:51] would be a meant to to be lost and go to
[1:13:54] help maybe that's why we're never and
[1:13:56] the reason people are lost is because
[1:13:58] they do not they do not allow God to
[1:14:00] take this sin away I mean but they hold
[1:14:03] on to it they hold on to religious first
[1:14:05] they hold on to their fallen state and
[1:14:07] they literally allow those things to
[1:14:09] drag them down into you know you're down
[1:14:11] to be lost and because you know how
[1:14:13] terrible that would be we don't want
[1:14:14] anyone to be lost I mean we would not
[1:14:17] even our worst enemy we wouldn't know
[1:14:19] why's rejoice when they are cast down
[1:14:22] passed away amen so here's these people
[1:14:26] that crying out for revenge and we know
[1:14:28] you know the law is I for an eye a tooth
[1:14:30] for a tooth
[1:14:31] amen that the that the score had to be
[1:14:34] settled so they're crying out for that
[1:14:35] and so these people are not Christian
[1:14:38] people they are the Jews a mint and as
[1:14:42] God's great mercy and grace they're from
[1:14:45] Calvary down into now all the true
[1:14:47] believer the juice amen
[1:14:49] they're given white robes which means
[1:14:51] eternal life they are given those things
[1:14:54] even though their forefathers rejected
[1:14:57] the very blood but they had two that we
[1:14:59] would come in because God doesn't deal
[1:15:01] with you and Gentiles they've done amen
[1:15:04] so these people are alive they are
[1:15:05] conscious of what's going on they know
[1:15:07] they have been killed so they have
[1:15:08] memories of being upon the earth right
[1:15:12] and so then they're crying out for
[1:15:14] revenge so these people are not asleep
[1:15:16] and it's the same thing now when we go
[1:15:20] to revelations chapter five and the lamb
[1:15:22] takes the book amen dezik there's a
[1:15:25] worship that goes on that worthy Oh God
[1:15:27] amen you have redeemed us back to God by
[1:15:30] thy blood I mean this Thanksgiving
[1:15:33] Alleluia there's rejoicing I mean
[1:15:36] because there because in that scene as
[1:15:37] you and that scene as me hallelujah
[1:15:41] Whoopie because it became a reality
[1:15:43] because how do you worship God we don't
[1:15:45] we do not worship God by things we learn
[1:15:47] remember and the Old Testament it was
[1:15:50] God revealed himself and then they
[1:15:52] worshiped him so God supernaturally
[1:15:54] revealed himself and they worshiped him
[1:15:56] and the New Testament well you're the
[1:15:58] gospel went into the Greek world and how
[1:16:01] do they it's all by head knowledge and
[1:16:03] so that kind of thought has been down
[1:16:06] through seven church ages as that of man
[1:16:08] knows the word mentally then they can
[1:16:11] worship God that's not how we worship
[1:16:12] Him we worship Him by revelation I mean
[1:16:15] when God reveals himself earlier that's
[1:16:18] how that's the only way you can really
[1:16:19] worship God I mean when it's revealed
[1:16:21] you you're lost but now you're found
[1:16:24] Amen that you are dead in trespasses but
[1:16:26] now you're being quickened now you've
[1:16:28] been alive I mean you can't wash room yo
[1:16:31] that is a healer and this is healed you
[1:16:32] I mean you can't wash him he's a
[1:16:34] redeemer and
[1:16:35] he's redeemed you I mean you cannot you
[1:16:38] cannot have a reality and this it
[1:16:40] becomes real to you right so so when
[1:16:43] there's that cry thou has redeemed us
[1:16:45] back to God then obviously there's a
[1:16:47] memory that once these people were lost
[1:16:49] but now they're found
[1:16:51] Alleluia so down through the ages we are
[1:16:54] still going to rejoice amen well down
[1:16:56] through the ages in eternity there's no
[1:16:58] time than we know but there'll be a
[1:17:00] worship from the believer we were lost
[1:17:02] but now we found Amen we were sick but
[1:17:06] now that then we got healed
[1:17:07] I mean we're broken but then we got
[1:17:09] mended hallelujah they'll still be a
[1:17:11] Thanksgiving amen because God wants us
[1:17:16] to know God wants us to really know you
[1:17:18] know Satan did God a favor in the garden
[1:17:22] by using the serpent to make the world
[1:17:25] fall because before there was a fall God
[1:17:27] had all these attributes enemy is redeem
[1:17:29] ease the hilary's restorer you know he's
[1:17:32] a guide he's a comfort he's an advocate
[1:17:34] he's the high priest he's he's the lamb
[1:17:36] he's the blood he's all these he's a
[1:17:37] father you know he's all these different
[1:17:39] things but he couldn't fully Express
[1:17:42] those things without their bingston amen
[1:17:45] so God knew before would happen because
[1:17:47] he knew all things but he allowed it to
[1:17:49] happen because God wanted to fully
[1:17:50] express himself to us hallelujah
[1:17:54] so it's really a glorious thing you say
[1:17:56] well I've had a horrible Road and many
[1:18:00] of us have but don't look at the bad
[1:18:02] look at the positive well what's the
[1:18:04] positive I'm not that person anymore I
[1:18:06] meant where well I was wounded in my
[1:18:09] spirit I was harmed I was you know
[1:18:11] terrible things happened to me but have
[1:18:13] you been healed of it amen how do you
[1:18:17] you know it's like like you know boys
[1:18:20] therican scars are cool these guys are
[1:18:23] cool right but it depends how you look
[1:18:27] at the scars I said last Sunday Caleb
[1:18:30] and Joshua they receive the same
[1:18:31] beatings in the same whippings the
[1:18:33] others the others wasted with no slaves
[1:18:35] but they didn't look at the scars of the
[1:18:38] beatings they looked at the promise
[1:18:40] because the promise they could rejoice
[1:18:42] because they weren't getting beaten
[1:18:44] anymore
[1:18:44] I mean but those could look oh that was
[1:18:46] a horrible experience sure it was I mean
[1:18:49] but they weren't those people anymore so
[1:18:51] it depends how you look at your sky do
[1:18:53] you look at you look at pain from your
[1:18:55] past as a horrible thing as in like you
[1:18:58] know you're still suffering from it or
[1:19:00] has the Lord healed you of it and then
[1:19:02] you rejoice I was once bound or hurt by
[1:19:05] this thing but now I've been mending I
[1:19:08] mean because scars should just be a
[1:19:10] remembrance of God's victory in your
[1:19:12] life it's all depends how you look at it
[1:19:15] now in faith because when faith got real
[1:19:17] faith comes unto you Amen it gives you
[1:19:19] overcoming power over those things and
[1:19:22] that you don't wallow and help me Lord
[1:19:24] yeah I'm so broken
[1:19:26] it's hallelujah I've been healed amen
[1:19:29] and those scars become trophies of God's
[1:19:31] grace in your life I mean like the woman
[1:19:34] at the well she could have either had a
[1:19:36] complex after coming to the Lord well
[1:19:38] I've been with five husbands I was with
[1:19:39] six and now I'm a believer or she could
[1:19:42] have rejoiced
[1:19:43] I had a man problem looking for love in
[1:19:45] the wrong places but then finally I met
[1:19:47] my real husband amen and now I'm free
[1:19:50] and I walk with Him it all depends how
[1:19:52] you look at it Amen but it takes God to
[1:19:55] reveal it to you amen
[1:19:59] so now this isn't recognizing your
[1:20:02] dana's message brother BAM says and this
[1:20:06] so he speaking of Moses and Elijah the
[1:20:08] prophets which the Jews only believe
[1:20:09] their prophets and they'll come forth
[1:20:12] with the sign of the prophets and their
[1:20:13] work will be of the Prophet they did
[1:20:15] exactly showing one thing that men when
[1:20:17] you die or whatever when you leave this
[1:20:20] world your nature doesn't change if
[1:20:22] you're a liar now you'll be a liar there
[1:20:24] if you're hot-headed there you'll be
[1:20:26] hot-headed there if you're a data here
[1:20:28] you'll be a data there men and women
[1:20:30] it's time to shake yourselves and to
[1:20:32] examine yourselves and see where you're
[1:20:33] standing for death does not change it
[1:20:36] they have been gone for two thousand
[1:20:39] years Moses about 2500 years Elijah ever
[1:20:43] since almost 2500 years has largely been
[1:20:45] gone and Moses has been gone and here
[1:20:48] they return with the same nature do the
[1:20:51] same thing death doesn't do nothing to a
[1:20:53] man but change his dwelling place
[1:20:54] doesn't change your nature doesn't
[1:20:56] change your faith doesn't change
[1:20:58] nothing and you about your dwelling
[1:21:00] place I mean so which away your nature
[1:21:02] is this morning if you're a data of
[1:21:04] God's Word you'll be a data over there I
[1:21:06] don't care how holy you are how you live
[1:21:09] how good you live it wouldn't change you
[1:21:13] one but two died just your dwelling
[1:21:15] place and if you can't accept the whole
[1:21:17] Word of God the way it is written you
[1:21:18] wouldn't do it there so don't worry says
[1:21:22] you won't be deal it's a bit of a
[1:21:23] stinger but it's true
[1:21:24] amen so this doesn't change anything
[1:21:29] about us you know brother Ron Spencer
[1:21:32] said death is just a travel bus to get
[1:21:35] us where we really want to go I mean
[1:21:37] because the believer has no fear of
[1:21:39] death I mean the believer was just it
[1:21:42] could be that's the glorious you know
[1:21:44] like brother Brown had had a campaign
[1:21:46] manager brother if if Bosworth you know
[1:21:49] and he was in his eighties I think you
[1:21:50] know he's dying
[1:21:51] and brother BAM went to see him on his
[1:21:53] deathbed he says you know and the
[1:21:55] brother Bosworth said to him this is the
[1:21:57] greatest day of my life
[1:21:58] is why is that because any minute now
[1:22:00] the one I've loved all these years is
[1:22:02] going to walk through the door and take
[1:22:03] me home
[1:22:04] Alleluia and he is the same God then as
[1:22:08] he is today
[1:22:09] Alleluia I mean let's go to let's go to
[1:22:15] First Samuel 28 I'm just I'm just
[1:22:20] emphasizing this whole thing because I
[1:22:22] really wanted to anchor in what we are
[1:22:24] now is what will be there okay you say
[1:22:29] well God is a God of grace and mercy he
[1:22:33] is but do you know what grace means it
[1:22:35] means it doesn't mean just a pardon but
[1:22:39] you can continue on but real grace if
[1:22:42] you go look in the Greek and the New
[1:22:43] Testament it's especially a divine a
[1:22:46] divine influence on your heart that's
[1:22:51] what real grace is a divine influence on
[1:22:53] your heart so God is not just some like
[1:22:55] a granddad that just lets you carry on
[1:22:57] do what you want to do and when people
[1:22:59] came to Jesus hears God send no more
[1:23:01] leads to worse than come upon you right
[1:23:02] so real Grace's is a divine your
[1:23:06] influence on your heart that's all real
[1:23:09] Grace's so now
[1:23:12] if God thou God and that's how credible
[1:23:15] it is where God can influence a person
[1:23:18] amen I'm not trying to draw this out but
[1:23:21] God when God influences you change and
[1:23:24] because it's a goodness of God that
[1:23:25] leads us to repentance it's not man's
[1:23:28] seven steps to becoming a Christian it's
[1:23:30] God's hand has to come upon you I mean
[1:23:33] that's why we must pray amen for for
[1:23:36] unsaved loved ones or family or
[1:23:39] especially children you know people we
[1:23:41] know God catch them God get a hold of
[1:23:44] them God change them because we can we
[1:23:47] can talk to them and we can try and do
[1:23:49] them right and put them right but unless
[1:23:51] God catches that person a mint because
[1:23:54] he caught me he changed me I wasn't
[1:23:57] looking for him he found me amen
[1:24:00] I wasn't raised in church amen I was
[1:24:03] making homebrew and a flat at university
[1:24:05] partying most of the week and God found
[1:24:07] me in that condition amen anybody
[1:24:10] doesn't leave you in that kind of
[1:24:11] condition because he changes your heart
[1:24:13] and you mean to realize what am i doing
[1:24:15] amen and then I had a burden I must know
[1:24:18] I've been forgiven
[1:24:19] amen and by His grace he showed me I was
[1:24:22] forgiven
[1:24:24] Alleluia so now there's a power prison
[1:24:29] that can change a person amen I lean on
[1:24:34] predestination I do but don't take it
[1:24:38] for granted amen don't don't take it
[1:24:41] well if I'm there I'm going to be there
[1:24:43] well they are you just throwing yourself
[1:24:44] on the sideline God didn't just God
[1:24:47] didn't make you like that we're not
[1:24:48] robots
[1:24:49] people aren't robots he doesn't force
[1:24:52] you to become anything but there's a
[1:24:55] power you say well Lord I'm not in that
[1:24:57] condition there's a power here to turn
[1:24:59] the heart amen
[1:25:01] should you so desire now so I first ml
[1:25:04] 28 now this is the account of where Saul
[1:25:08] now has become an enemy of God he's
[1:25:12] going to fight the Philistines in the
[1:25:13] morning but he can't he he cannot hear
[1:25:16] he can't hear from God in any way the
[1:25:21] anointings left them he's become an
[1:25:22] enemy of God by his own choice
[1:25:25] and and he can't hear from God in any
[1:25:28] way what to do so he gets so desperate
[1:25:31] that he goes to find a witch and then
[1:25:35] Samuel 28 and 7 we're just going to read
[1:25:37] down to verse 19 then when saul unto and
[1:25:41] then said Saul I do servants seek me a
[1:25:43] woman that had a familiar spirit that I
[1:25:45] may go to her and inquire of her and his
[1:25:48] servant said to him behold there was a
[1:25:50] woman that had a familiar spirit at
[1:25:52] Endor and Saul disguised himself and put
[1:25:55] on other raiment and he went and two men
[1:25:57] with them and they came to the woman by
[1:25:59] night he said I pray thee divine unto me
[1:26:01] by the familiy spirit and bring him up
[1:26:04] whom I shall name under thee and the
[1:26:07] woman said unto them behold thou knowest
[1:26:09] that what Saul has done how he has cut
[1:26:12] off those that have familiar spirits and
[1:26:14] the Wizards out the land wherefore then
[1:26:16] last hour sneer for my life to cause me
[1:26:19] to die and the and Saul spake unto her
[1:26:22] by the Lord I mean and Saul swear unto
[1:26:25] her by the Lord saying as the Lord
[1:26:26] loveth there shall no punishment happen
[1:26:29] to thee for this thing then said the
[1:26:31] woman whom shall I bring up again he
[1:26:33] said bring me up Samuel and when the
[1:26:36] woman saw Samuel she cried with a loud
[1:26:38] voice and the woman speak to Saul saying
[1:26:40] why has thou deceived me further for
[1:26:42] thou art Saul and the King said unto her
[1:26:44] be not afraid for what saw a thou and
[1:26:46] the woman said under saw I saw Gods
[1:26:48] ascending out of the earth and he said
[1:26:50] unto her what for mers-cov said an old
[1:26:53] man cometh up and he is covered with a
[1:26:55] mantle and Saul perceived it was Samuel
[1:26:57] and he stooped down his face to the
[1:26:59] ground and bowed himself and Samuel said
[1:27:01] to Saul why does thou disquieted me to
[1:27:05] bring me up and Saul said I am sore
[1:27:07] distress for the Philistines make war
[1:27:09] against me and God has departed from me
[1:27:12] and answered me no more neither by
[1:27:14] prophet nor by dreams wherefore I called
[1:27:16] thee that thou mayst make known unto me
[1:27:18] what I shall do then said Samuel
[1:27:21] wherefore then does they'll ask of me
[1:27:23] seeing the Lord as departed from the end
[1:27:25] has become my enemy and the LORD hath
[1:27:28] done to him as he spake Bobby for the
[1:27:32] Lord hath written the kingdom out of
[1:27:33] thine hand and given it to thy neighbor
[1:27:35] even to David because they obey us not
[1:27:37] the voice of Lord nor
[1:27:38] executed his fierce wrath upon emilich
[1:27:41] therefore had the Lord done this thing
[1:27:43] unto thee this day moreover the Lord
[1:27:45] will also deliver Israel with the into
[1:27:47] the head of the Philistines and tomorrow
[1:27:49] shall die and thy sons be with me
[1:27:52] the Lord also shall deliver the hosts of
[1:27:54] Israel into the hand of the Philistines
[1:27:56] so here is a man who was a prophet and
[1:28:00] his life he was a prophet a god-ordained
[1:28:02] prophet and when he was dead he was
[1:28:04] still a prophet amen he had a mantle
[1:28:07] upon Tomita prophets mantle and he
[1:28:08] prophesied tomorrow at this time you'll
[1:28:11] be where I am you and your sons he was
[1:28:13] prophesying you will die in the battle
[1:28:15] and Israel will lose the battle and it's
[1:28:18] exactly what happened see death doesn't
[1:28:21] change who we are I mean samuel was
[1:28:23] still Samuel Alleluia amen
[1:28:29] he say in it so it was he was still
[1:28:33] exactly the same person now death does
[1:28:38] not change your spirit or who you are
[1:28:41] only changes your dwelling place now if
[1:28:45] that's the case though you say well how
[1:28:47] on earth do I get changed from from this
[1:28:52] from this state into the state of the
[1:28:55] redeemed and it's a very simple process
[1:28:59] actually but before I go there I want to
[1:29:05] go to a I'll just leave it off so now
[1:29:10] here we are in this fallen state but God
[1:29:13] has to change us in order for us to go
[1:29:16] into his presence because sin cannot be
[1:29:19] in the presence of God amen in the Old
[1:29:21] Testament we had when God came down on
[1:29:23] Mount Sinai those borders put around the
[1:29:25] mountain where they could not even
[1:29:27] approach it because he's a holy God and
[1:29:29] he showed how severe sin was is that
[1:29:32] when a leper I mean anyone who got
[1:29:34] leprosy there in the Old Testament when
[1:29:36] they were there you're journeying from
[1:29:37] Egypt to the promised land they had to
[1:29:39] be put without the camp and therefore
[1:29:41] see is a type of sin that's how severe
[1:29:43] it was that God you cannot come close to
[1:29:45] me
[1:29:46] amen in that state so there as like
[1:29:50] anything man cannot help himself
[1:29:52] amen because we bought born in a fallen
[1:29:55] state so God himself had to come down to
[1:29:57] change man remember being a believer is
[1:30:00] not you changing yourself it is God
[1:30:02] changing you I mean because if you
[1:30:05] change yourself you've just reformed
[1:30:07] yourself you've just turned over a new
[1:30:09] leaf
[1:30:09] but I bet you assures the world the
[1:30:11] lethal turn back again yeah Amen so it
[1:30:14] has to be your nature you must have it
[1:30:16] you have to be changed and it's the same
[1:30:18] as the world the world goes from a dark
[1:30:21] chaos in the beginning but then it comes
[1:30:23] out into a new heavens and a new earth
[1:30:25] at the end of the Bible and we know that
[1:30:27] that new heavens and new earth is not a
[1:30:29] new one mate and is the same earth but
[1:30:31] it's been renovated right so the same
[1:30:34] way the earth is redeemed is the same
[1:30:36] way man is reading right and we know
[1:30:38] redemption is to restore back what it
[1:30:40] should be in the beginning so it so in
[1:30:43] the days of Noah the earth received the
[1:30:46] baptism amen it was immersed in water
[1:30:49] and Peter and the first church service
[1:30:52] ever preached of the New Testament era
[1:30:53] he said repent and be baptized name of
[1:30:56] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:30:58] sin and you shall receive the gift of
[1:31:00] the Holy Ghost I mean it's the
[1:31:02] repentance is a change of heart a
[1:31:04] turning from your wickedness to follow
[1:31:05] the Lord amen so now so in Noah's day
[1:31:09] the the earth was baptized but sin
[1:31:12] carried over over the flood amen man was
[1:31:16] still the same from the from before the
[1:31:19] flood as after the flood that's the same
[1:31:21] thing we may repent and be baptized but
[1:31:23] we can come out of the come out of the
[1:31:25] water still with our same old nature but
[1:31:27] we've started our journey that's the
[1:31:29] main thing just start your journey amen
[1:31:32] to start your journey and God will take
[1:31:34] you the rest of the way if you're
[1:31:35] willing if you're willing to go and then
[1:31:38] now with with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:41] wait let's just go to 1st John 5 let's
[1:31:43] read the scripture just for you you say
[1:31:44] well where are you going with this I
[1:31:46] need to base it on the scripture so I'll
[1:31:47] show you here first John 5 because it's
[1:31:53] a journey amen
[1:31:55] where God takes you from one state and
[1:31:58] makes you into a symmetry
[1:32:03] now first John five and we're even verse
[1:32:08] four for whatsoever is born of God
[1:32:13] overcometh the world and this is the
[1:32:15] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:32:17] our faith who has he that overcometh the
[1:32:19] world but he that believeth on Jesus as
[1:32:21] the Son of God this is he that came by
[1:32:23] water and blood even Jesus Christ not by
[1:32:25] water only but by water and blood and it
[1:32:29] is the spirit that beareth witness
[1:32:30] because the Spirit is truth for there
[1:32:32] are three that bear record in heaven the
[1:32:34] father the word and the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:36] these three are one
[1:32:38] and that word word there means as son
[1:32:41] okay so they are one in the same but and
[1:32:44] there are three that bear witness and
[1:32:46] earth the blood I mean so the spirit and
[1:32:48] the water and the blood and these three
[1:32:51] agree in one so they're not one like God
[1:32:54] is one but they agree in one okay so now
[1:32:58] and we know that those three things
[1:33:01] water blood and and life constitute a
[1:33:03] natural birth the waters break in the
[1:33:05] month in blood and then there's a life
[1:33:07] the baby comes out and breathes in his
[1:33:08] life okay that constitutes a natural
[1:33:11] birth as the same thing with a spiritual
[1:33:14] birth okay and then so now so the earth
[1:33:18] was baptized in the days of Noah but son
[1:33:21] came over okay the nature of man had not
[1:33:24] changed and then now Jesus came and
[1:33:27] sanctified the earth by his blood he
[1:33:30] poured his blood out upon the earth with
[1:33:31] sanctified it which was the cleanse at
[1:33:34] the center and secta fication is to be
[1:33:36] cleansed and set aside for service so a
[1:33:39] cleansing now is when God takes you and
[1:33:41] takes all the your old lust your old
[1:33:44] desires the old things you used to do
[1:33:46] from your first nature and take it out
[1:33:48] of you I mean so things like you know
[1:33:51] people people you know if they're full
[1:33:54] of lust they have a temper you know they
[1:33:56] smoke they drink they they do drugs you
[1:33:58] know they run around with woman whatever
[1:34:01] it may be those kind of old things
[1:34:03] you're going to be sanctified of those
[1:34:04] things and it's the blood that
[1:34:06] sanctifies us I mean because God God
[1:34:09] does not dwell in an unholy place amen
[1:34:14] because the Tempio
[1:34:15] we as the scripture says we are the
[1:34:17] temples or the houses of God the
[1:34:20] believer is but he doesn't live in a
[1:34:22] polluted temple he may anoint someone
[1:34:25] but to be anointed is different to God
[1:34:28] coming and dwelling okay so there has to
[1:34:31] be a cleansing of our own that's why you
[1:34:33] got to say God take my life take my
[1:34:35] heart take everything I have wipe it
[1:34:37] clean that's anything that's contrary to
[1:34:39] you that you can dwell in me
[1:34:41] amen and he will he did it to me I
[1:34:44] didn't have Church I didn't have
[1:34:45] anything all I had was the message in
[1:34:47] the Bible and God transformed me amen
[1:34:50] because I see it because when you mean
[1:34:51] business with God God will mean business
[1:34:54] with you it's not just a lip service but
[1:34:56] when you really say God I'm sick of my
[1:34:58] life
[1:34:58] I'm sick of wondering and sin I you know
[1:35:01] I don't even know what this life was all
[1:35:03] about coming changed me that I can know
[1:35:05] you he will Amen bahid and I said if he
[1:35:09] did it for me he'll do it for anyone
[1:35:11] hallelujah so now we have to be cleansed
[1:35:13] sanctified and set apart for service but
[1:35:16] just to be sanctified is not enough I
[1:35:19] mean so someone can live a holy life
[1:35:21] never do something wrong just right act
[1:35:23] right do all the right things but that's
[1:35:25] just being set apart for service but
[1:35:27] then there is now a filling time where
[1:35:30] God Himself steps into that sanctified
[1:35:32] vessel and then he dwells in that person
[1:35:35] Alleluia and we can see this this is go
[1:35:37] to let's go to Acts chapter 18 because
[1:35:41] there is the promise as we read is I
[1:35:44] quote of max chapter 2 repent and be
[1:35:47] baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:35:48] you shall be filled now we understand
[1:35:52] that some people can receive the Holy
[1:35:54] Ghost before they're baptized just like
[1:35:56] Cornelius's house in Acts chapter 10
[1:35:58] while you Peter spake these words the
[1:36:00] Spirit of God fell upon them and Peter
[1:36:02] says can we forbid them water sing they
[1:36:04] have receive the Holy Ghost like we did
[1:36:06] right but then in many times it is
[1:36:09] afterwards now X let's read from acts 18
[1:36:15] 24 and I hope you don't mind we just
[1:36:16] doing a bit of reading and a certain
[1:36:18] Judah but that's how important don't
[1:36:20] just come up to sanctification don't
[1:36:23] just come up to a holy life I mean go
[1:36:25] all the way in
[1:36:27] to the promised because it's when he
[1:36:29] comes and dwells in you then when you
[1:36:31] really have overcoming power I mean by
[1:36:33] the blood of Jesus Christ just to be
[1:36:35] justified by faith that is good I mean
[1:36:38] just to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:39] repenting baptized that is good but do
[1:36:42] not stay there
[1:36:42] amen because because you don't wait why
[1:36:45] have the devil fight you and overcome
[1:36:48] you all the time why wrestle with habits
[1:36:50] and never overcome them I mean why
[1:36:52] wrestle with the things of the world and
[1:36:54] never be able to overcome them why
[1:36:56] wrestle with your own nature and never
[1:36:57] be able to overcome it when you can have
[1:37:01] overcoming power over the thing a me
[1:37:04] remember the Christian walkers a walk of
[1:37:06] victory but it's a walk of death to self
[1:37:10] amen and it's the only way brother
[1:37:12] Graham says if you want a total
[1:37:13] deliverance it takes a total surrender
[1:37:15] sir whew
[1:37:17] so if you anything less you'll never be
[1:37:19] totally delivered hallelujah
[1:37:22] and a certain Jew named Apollo's born at
[1:37:25] Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in
[1:37:29] the scriptures came to Ephesus
[1:37:30] this man was instructed in the way of
[1:37:33] the Lord and being fervent in the spirit
[1:37:34] he spake and taught diligently the
[1:37:36] things of the Lord knowing only the
[1:37:38] baptism of John and he began to speak
[1:37:41] boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila
[1:37:44] and Priscilla had heard they took him
[1:37:45] unto them and expounded unto Him the way
[1:37:49] of God more perfectly and when he was
[1:37:52] disposed to go into acacia the Brethren
[1:37:56] wrote exhorting the disciples to receive
[1:37:58] him who when he was come helped them
[1:38:01] much which had believed through grace
[1:38:03] for he mightily convicted that you can
[1:38:06] convince the Jews and that publicly
[1:38:08] showing by the scriptures that Jesus was
[1:38:11] Christ so this man was a believer he
[1:38:13] believed that Jesus was the Lamb of God
[1:38:15] take away the sin of the world he was
[1:38:16] shown from the scripture this man is the
[1:38:18] Messiah right right but but notice he's
[1:38:21] only come part way and it came to pass
[1:38:24] that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul
[1:38:26] having passed through the upper coasts
[1:38:28] came to Ephesus and finding certain
[1:38:30] disciples he said unto them have you
[1:38:32] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:38:35] believe and that's what it really means
[1:38:36] the original have you believed it since
[1:38:38] you believe not it doesn't say when you
[1:38:40] believe
[1:38:41] you believe have you received the Holy
[1:38:42] Ghost it's such a you say well that's
[1:38:45] quite a radical question that's the most
[1:38:47] important question have you received the
[1:38:50] life of God in you since you believed
[1:38:52] Amen I oppose it to you this morning
[1:38:55] have you where you say well of you know
[1:38:56] yeah because the politic and say well I
[1:38:58] I can see in the Old Testaments being a
[1:39:00] shadow I can see he's the Lamb of God I
[1:39:02] can see he's the high priest I can see
[1:39:04] I'll put it in today's language I can
[1:39:06] see what the seals are I can see we're
[1:39:07] at the end of all things I see God
[1:39:09] centers Elijah you know you know I see I
[1:39:12] see what it means to really walk with
[1:39:14] God I can see all the mysteries but have
[1:39:16] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:39:17] believe and it came to pass a while a
[1:39:20] polis was at Corinth Paul having passed
[1:39:22] through the upper coast came sorry verse
[1:39:24] two have you seen the Holy Ghost since
[1:39:26] you believe and they said unto Him we
[1:39:28] have not so much as heard whether there
[1:39:30] be any Holy Ghost
[1:39:31] that's incredible and he said of them
[1:39:35] unto what were you baptized so you put
[1:39:38] it down to his baptism because what he
[1:39:39] because a baptism represents what are
[1:39:41] you being United with remember you're
[1:39:43] showing that you're showing the unseen
[1:39:45] world I'm taking the name of Jesus
[1:39:48] Christ I want him to be united with my
[1:39:51] bridegroom with my sacrifice and they
[1:39:54] sit under John's baptism now John's
[1:39:56] baptism was fine but now it wasn't fine
[1:39:58] then said paul john bailey baptized with
[1:40:02] the baptism of repentance saying unto
[1:40:04] the people they should believe on him
[1:40:05] which had come after him even as on
[1:40:07] christ jesus when they heard this they
[1:40:09] were baptized in the name of the lord
[1:40:11] jesus and when paul had laid his hands
[1:40:13] upon them the holy ghost came on them
[1:40:15] they spake with tongues and prophesied
[1:40:17] and all the men were about twelve so
[1:40:20] here was a bunch of people though
[1:40:21] believers but they had they were walk in
[1:40:25] the past because god had moved on so
[1:40:28] they believed but paul said every
[1:40:29] received it since your belief so have
[1:40:32] you gone all the way amen and when they
[1:40:35] got baptized the right way because i
[1:40:38] already believers God gave them the Holy
[1:40:39] Spirit but see sanctification so don't
[1:40:42] just come up to a a walk of
[1:40:45] sanctification you've been sanctified
[1:40:47] they mean we must be sanctified I mean
[1:40:51] we can't just we can't just live the
[1:40:53] same old life and you
[1:40:54] claimed to be going in that number of
[1:40:56] the redeemed I mean because of your you
[1:41:00] know if you're still in that state here
[1:41:02] you'll be in that state there I mean but
[1:41:04] if you all justified and sanctified to
[1:41:06] fill with the Holy Spirit you'll be the
[1:41:08] same over there amen so now Jesus now
[1:41:12] his blood came upon the earth he
[1:41:14] sanctified the earth but then the enemy
[1:41:17] is still here right but then when
[1:41:19] there's the new heavens and you were
[1:41:21] amen the earth is baptized with a fiery
[1:41:24] baptism and all the devils and all the
[1:41:26] sinners burnt often and it becomes a new
[1:41:28] creature I mean it becomes a new
[1:41:31] creation and you ER
[1:41:32] and that's the same thing with us
[1:41:35] Alleluia and that's what must happened
[1:41:37] you say well what about the atomic
[1:41:39] destruction just before the Millenium
[1:41:41] well the devil still here but he's bound
[1:41:44] by circumstance
[1:41:45] he's bound by a change of circumstances
[1:41:47] he's got no one to work through during
[1:41:48] the Millennium it's the same thing with
[1:41:50] us we received because we're still in
[1:41:52] these bodies forgive me if I'm jumping
[1:41:54] around but we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:41:56] we're still in these bodies but now by
[1:41:59] his power in you the devil becomes bound
[1:42:02] where he has no longer the ability he
[1:42:05] may try and come and put thoughts into
[1:42:07] your mind and try and make you doubt and
[1:42:10] do all kinds of things but by the power
[1:42:12] of Jesus Christ by the spirit of life in
[1:42:14] you he is bound where he doesn't you
[1:42:18] have dominion over him and then now we
[1:42:20] are waiting for the full change now as
[1:42:23] that there's a change in these bodies
[1:42:25] amen which is like the new heavens and
[1:42:28] the new earth because remember the earth
[1:42:29] has scars the earth has scars you see
[1:42:33] great your volcanic upheavals great
[1:42:36] earthquakes you know you see your people
[1:42:38] dig down they find fossil records and
[1:42:40] all kinds of things because the earth
[1:42:42] has scars of previous destructions right
[1:42:46] and it's just like us we can go back
[1:42:48] into our life and there are scars just
[1:42:50] like the earth has scar but because the
[1:42:53] earth member in this book you know the
[1:42:57] earth I think it may be the only planet
[1:42:59] that's name is in the book of life right
[1:43:02] and because it's name is in there it has
[1:43:04] to be redeemed
[1:43:06] so if that is the case now those scars
[1:43:09] are not going to stay there because the
[1:43:12] earth is going to be renovated that all
[1:43:14] the scars are going to be taken out of
[1:43:16] it and it's the same thing with you and
[1:43:18] I we may be carrying scars but we're
[1:43:21] going to go on to new bodies with those
[1:43:23] scars are not there anymore amen but I
[1:43:26] trust and maybe I'll just close with
[1:43:28] this is that if the Lord is in you then
[1:43:33] you have a power within you that as I
[1:43:36] said a while ago the scars do not keep
[1:43:39] you weighed down but you rejoice because
[1:43:41] you've got victory over those things
[1:43:44] amen because a scar is a testimony of
[1:43:47] something you survived I mean I've got a
[1:43:50] hockey stick in the head when I was
[1:43:51] young I got my hand slashed open all
[1:43:54] different kinds of things there was when
[1:43:55] I was older but I survived them now look
[1:43:58] at the scars hallelujah I survived it
[1:44:00] and that's how you should look at them
[1:44:02] not trying to say these things a joke
[1:44:03] but all the things that happened to you
[1:44:05] in life I trust it's a scar in such a
[1:44:07] way that's just a trophy of I survived
[1:44:09] God saw me through hallelujah a mink we
[1:44:14] have some musicians to come so I'll
[1:44:19] leave you with this question
[1:44:21] where are you if you died right now
[1:44:24] I meant simple questions you know if you
[1:44:32] go right now what will you be what will
[1:44:36] you be over there
[1:44:37] will you be a data a scoffer making fun
[1:44:41] you know sometimes you other people we
[1:44:43] don't want to fall into the category you
[1:44:45] know I think you have the prayer
[1:44:46] meetings that we have and God comes down
[1:44:48] and people cry and they scream and they
[1:44:50] shout they do all kinds of things if
[1:44:51] you're sitting there and you see that
[1:44:53] happen don't make fun of those people
[1:44:55] don't don't belittle people that cried
[1:44:58] the presence of God or shout or scream
[1:44:59] because that is God anointing someone
[1:45:03] causing them to do it it's not just
[1:45:05] emotion that is God so now if you think
[1:45:09] about it oh well then what will you be
[1:45:11] up and up and glory is there going to be
[1:45:13] all the people around the throne because
[1:45:14] we're going to have a glorious time do
[1:45:16] you think we're just going to sit there
[1:45:17] saying how
[1:45:18] lujah put the crown on his head glory to
[1:45:21] God I know you have a time this is the
[1:45:26] quiet the earth is the most quietest
[1:45:28] place you'll ever be because heaven is
[1:45:30] going to be noisy amen so how's it going
[1:45:33] to be then because of because of when
[1:45:34] God comes down and everyone's shouting
[1:45:36] and rejoicing it's going to be like that
[1:45:38] up there but a greater way but then
[1:45:40] how's it going to be when people are
[1:45:41] sitting to one side looking at these
[1:45:42] people all these people are weird by the
[1:45:44] way why should she do that why is he
[1:45:46] doing this why's he looked crazy and
[1:45:47] shouting and starting all these clothing
[1:45:49] that's what they'll be like in heaven so
[1:45:52] don't make fun of people that are
[1:45:54] anointed and praying and rejoicing
[1:45:57] because you're not making fun of the
[1:45:59] person you're making fun of God acting
[1:46:00] that's why the day of Pentecost all
[1:46:02] these people are drunk with new wine
[1:46:03] making fun that's the worst thing you
[1:46:06] could ever say amen because of what M
[1:46:10] Peter says no this is that spoken by the
[1:46:12] Prophet Joel God's poured himself out
[1:46:13] into people amen that's why so we should
[1:46:17] never just look at the kernel you know
[1:46:18] don't make fun of any believer amen it
[1:46:22] should really be Lord yeah okay you take
[1:46:25] this in a very counter way you would
[1:46:28] take that into a just a rule at a party
[1:46:30] and people are tearing up the dance
[1:46:32] floor and rejoicing and shouting and you
[1:46:34] know having a great time people would
[1:46:37] think I want to have what they're having
[1:46:39] wouldn't you I was once upon time that
[1:46:42] was me what are they having I want to
[1:46:43] drink that but you come into the real
[1:46:46] things which and that will pass away
[1:46:48] this is eternal things we we're here to
[1:46:51] rejoice in and people will sit there and
[1:46:53] say this is all crazy I'll have nothing
[1:46:55] to do with this that's mad it should be
[1:46:57] Lord I want whatever they're
[1:46:59] experiencing get me into a place that I
[1:47:01] can experience that thing hallelujah I
[1:47:04] want to shout I want you know your
[1:47:06] brother Graham said about a yo you know
[1:47:08] there was a colored lady or you're
[1:47:10] shouting rejoicing and he just sort of
[1:47:12] fired half the victory she had how
[1:47:16] glorious would it be
[1:47:17] he didn't scored as he divided half the
[1:47:19] victory I mean so we shouldn't just sit
[1:47:22] back and say well those people they just
[1:47:24] built their way that's why they do these
[1:47:25] things that should be Lord I want to
[1:47:27] have what they're having I want to
[1:47:29] experience what they're having because
[1:47:31] that's how it will be in here
[1:47:33] amen and if people will be rejoicing and
[1:47:35] shouting at heaven you know I'd be like
[1:47:38] Lord I want to be that now because what
[1:47:41] you are now as I say if you are redeemed
[1:47:43] now not religious but you really know
[1:47:45] him not just religious and you know I go
[1:47:49] to church I read my Bible I pray no more
[1:47:51] than that but if you meet the author of
[1:47:53] the word I mean with the god of this
[1:47:55] message becomes alive to you amen and
[1:47:58] you love him and you enjoy his presence
[1:47:59] and you're looking forward to you know
[1:48:01] going from this world to the next world
[1:48:04] hallelujah you'll have that same
[1:48:06] rejoicing over there amen and I'll say
[1:48:09] this there is a power present to change
[1:48:12] us if you're not in that state you don't
[1:48:14] have to stay the way you are
[1:48:17] amen so don't worry about any fear while
[1:48:20] people think of you yo we sang I feel
[1:48:23] the pull you know and if there's
[1:48:26] something in your heart Lord I don't
[1:48:27] know really know who you are I don't
[1:48:29] know what you are but I want to know you
[1:48:31] he's present because that is God works
[1:48:33] on both ends I mean like at me I was so
[1:48:36] so something in me like Lord there's got
[1:48:39] to be more to life than this and
[1:48:41] naturally I was having the most greatest
[1:48:44] time in my life but I was empty I needed
[1:48:46] I was looking for more think what was
[1:48:50] happening God there's a deep there's a
[1:48:52] longing there's a deep calling to the
[1:48:54] deep and the reason there is the long in
[1:48:56] the soul is because God is calling a
[1:48:58] meant so if he's calling you should say
[1:49:01] thank you Lord here I come I respond
[1:49:04] hallelujah amen let's just add shall we
[1:49:08] this thing that I feel the pull don't be
[1:49:13] a doubter
[1:49:14] don't be a scoffer don't be indifferent
[1:49:18] amen they sing I feel the pull say Lord
[1:49:22] I want to be I want to be ready they
