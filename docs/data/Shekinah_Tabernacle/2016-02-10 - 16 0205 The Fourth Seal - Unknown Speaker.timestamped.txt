[8:04] Good evening
[8:06] everyone it's very good to see all of
[8:08] you here um this evening
[8:10] praise the Lord and um we're all very
[8:14] excited to be here
[8:16] and there's been a lot of prayer go into
[8:18] this and I believe there's a lot of
[8:21] expectation in people's hearts to meet
[8:23] the living God once again and I believe
[8:27] that's what we are going to accomplish
[8:29] here is that we're going to get
[8:31] ourselves out of the way and the living
[8:33] God is going to meet us and every time
[8:35] that he does it's always awesome and
[8:37] it's always it always changes us and
[8:40] makes us better because that's what God
[8:42] does and it's so wonderful to be in in a
[8:45] place in an atmosphere where the spirit
[8:46] of God can be
[8:48] welcome and we're going to have a really
[8:50] good time at this camp
[8:54] it's going to be a really good time yes
[8:55] sir and so Amen now we've just got to do
[9:00] a few um formalities before we start the
[9:03] service so we've the um gentleman
[9:06] running the camp is going to come up and
[9:07] just take us through a few of the camp
[9:08] procedures and then after that um pastor
[9:11] Benjamin is going to come up and just
[9:13] speak to us for a wee bit and then we're
[9:16] going to get into some praise and
[9:17] worship and then the word of God so
[9:19] that's going to be the um program for
[9:22] the night although God could change it
[9:23] and do whatever he wants we're always
[9:26] open for that so
[9:28] um um we'll have it come up now man and

[16:25] garment there was a woman in Mexico with
[16:27] the baby that was that was shown to be
[16:29] dead and she went to the meeting and she
[16:32] pushed through everyone to get to the
[16:33] prophet not to contact him but the
[16:36] contact of God revealing himself through
[16:38] amen and she left with an alive baby
[16:42] amen cuz that was her faith by just to
[16:44] him and remember that same God that same

[21:24] so now you can have your seats cuz we've
[21:28] got a little special for you tonight
[21:29] before we
[21:31] start and then we're going to sing it
[21:33] through once and then you guys are going
[21:35] to join in the second time who was here
[21:37] at the last
[21:38] camp hey heaps of you wow cool good okay
[21:43] so last year what was the theme song
[21:44] that we rang you know we did a song
[21:47] every start of every service
[21:53] [Music]
[21:54] lift up your head lift lift up your head
[21:56] so you gates
[21:59] let the king of glory make him and so so
[22:01] it kind of worked we just that just
[22:03] became our theme song and some of the
[22:04] brethren that came hadn't actually heard
[22:05] it so they they brought it back to their
[22:07] church and sang it there and and and um
[22:10] in the fellowship back in Wellington we
[22:12] always call that the camp song you know
[22:14] let's sing the camp song and um and then
[22:17] we thought well that would that's a nice
[22:19] thing to do that it kind of encapsulated
[22:21] the camp and when every time we sing it
[22:23] we think about the camp and the
[22:24] atmosphere and the good times that we
[22:25] had and we thought we would do something
[22:29] similar um but then we thought well we
[22:31] won't do the same song though because I
[22:33] don't know it was a good song but God
[22:36] keeps growing and moving you know he
[22:38] builds on top of everything and keeps
[22:40] going so
[22:42] um
[22:43] so so the the team and I actually have
[22:46] put a song together and you wouldn't
[22:47] have heard this one
[22:49] before cuz this is a new one and it sort
[22:52] of all came together and we feel that it
[22:54] came together for the camp so so this is
[22:56] going to be our our camp song and we
[22:58] believe that it will be a blessing to
[23:00] you guys and I'll just bring up the
[23:03] words i'll read you through the words
[23:04] and the song is about being free it's
[23:07] tying in um the Jubilee how when you
[23:11] know when the man when he went to
[23:12] slavery if he had debts and things he
[23:14] couldn't pay and he got sold into
[23:16] slavery there was a certain after 50
[23:17] years he could go free
[23:21] and you know I'll just read through
[23:23] these these vers these verses here then
[23:25] we'll talk a we bit so the verse one is
[23:28] years and years I labored toil and tears
[23:30] were my meat since my deaths took me
[23:33] prisoner sold me to slavery but every
[23:35] day that I toiled the jubilee was
[23:37] drawing closer the 49th year was the
[23:40] longest year then I heard the trumpet
[23:42] sound and when I heard the jubilee I
[23:44] walked free amen i walked free and I
[23:48] ain't going back to slavery because
[23:50] Jesus has set me free amen and then this
[23:52] then the second verse
[23:54] is years I spent in confusion i had eyes
[23:57] but couldn't see the enemy had me
[23:59] stumbling in darkness spiritual slavery
[24:02] but then I heard the prophet speaking i
[24:04] heard the voice behind the voice he
[24:06] opened up the word and let the light
[24:08] shine in said "You can all go free." And
[24:10] when I heard the jubilee I walked free i
[24:14] walked free amen and I ain't going back
[24:16] to slavery because Jesus has set me free
[24:19] and you know we've heard that Jubilee
[24:21] call you can all go free free from and
[24:25] it's not just a oh let's just say it
[24:26] it's a good feeling free from any
[24:28] complex free from anything that's not of
[24:30] God you can go free from it you can all
[24:33] go free just claim it it doesn't matter
[24:36] how much of a burden you had upon you
[24:38] just walk out say "I'm free." Amen so
[24:41] what we're going to do now is we're
[24:42] going to sing the song through once and
[24:44] then the the local people that have
[24:46] heard it once or twice before can join
[24:48] in and help sing and then um the next
[24:50] time we do it through you can stand up
[24:51] and join with us

[25:27] but every day that I tore

[26:14] confusion i had eyes but couldn't see
[26:19] the enemy had me standing in darkness
[26:24] spiritual
[26:27] slavery but then I heard the prophet
[26:32] speaking i heard the voice behind the
[26:36] voice he opened up the word and let the
[26:39] light shine in said "You can all go
[26:44] free."
[26:46] When I heard the jubile I was free i was
[26:52] free i was free when
[26:57] I was free I ain't going back to
[27:03] slavery because Jesus has set me free
[27:11] when I heard the jubile I was free i was

[1:08:04] listen to the gift that operates through
[1:08:06] him amen amen that God would take a man
[1:08:08] and use him as a channel to speak to us
[1:08:10] amen that's We're not here to hear the
[1:08:12] mind of a man we're here to hear from

[1:08:39] i mean I I just it just it just blows my
[1:08:42] mind where he would reach down i knew
[1:08:45] where I was when he found me and I was
[1:08:47] lost and undone in the world but he
[1:08:49] didn't even take that into consideration
[1:08:51] he said "There's a seed there and he
[1:08:53] must come." Hallelujah it's not the
[1:08:55] condition you're in it doesn't matter
[1:08:56] the life you've lived or what battles
[1:08:58] you wrestle with he doesn't look at that
[1:09:00] he looks beyond that he looks at the
[1:09:02] seed in you hallelujah so don't worry
[1:09:05] about what condition you're in amen if
[1:09:07] there's a deep there's a deep to respond
[1:09:10] to that deep hallelujah and don't let
[1:09:12] the devil cloud it and say "Well you
[1:09:14] don't deserve it you're not worthy."
[1:09:16] Well of course we're not worthy i can
[1:09:18] say that's the one thing I agree with
[1:09:20] the devil on is I'm not worthy but my
[1:09:22] opinion and the devil's opinion doesn't
[1:09:24] come into it it's God's opinion amen if
[1:09:27] God said before the foundation of the
[1:09:29] world I have called him or her she's
[1:09:32] going to come
[1:09:33] all that the father has given me already
[1:09:36] given will come to me and also all that
[1:09:39] come to me i'll know why it's cast out
[1:09:42] hallelujah the devil say you're not

[1:09:46] that's a lie hallelujah and just just
[1:09:49] say Jesus I come cuz you said if I come
[1:09:51] you won't cast me out and the reason
[1:09:54] there's a longing he put that longing
[1:09:56] there that's not your ambition and your
[1:09:59] longing that's God's longing hallelujah
[1:10:01] that God has ordained these meetings cuz

[1:10:06] talk to you he wants to you know have a
[1:10:08] relationship with you this message is

[1:10:16] us and God that's right hallelujah and
[1:10:18] that's why we're here if you've never
[1:10:19] entered into that

[1:10:28] second god needs one second and he'll

[1:10:36] and a door he says just open the door
[1:10:38] and then he'll come and do it so you
[1:10:40] don't reform yourself you open the door

[1:13:27] it's good to be here in New Zealand and
[1:13:31] uh uh to experience the country the
[1:13:35] people and especially God's people for
[1:13:37] the first time down in this part of the
[1:13:39] country i know some of you have been to
[1:13:41] Canada uh God's country and

[1:13:55] nice to see you
[1:13:56] again and uh those of you that haven't
[1:13:59] met me before my name is Tim Dodd as
[1:14:01] you've heard I come from Cloverdale and
[1:14:03] I bring you greetings greetings from
[1:14:05] brother Ed Bisll who said to bring these
[1:14:07] greetings to the saints down here and
[1:14:10] express his love and appreciation and
[1:14:12] all the saints in the church send their
[1:14:13] greetings and the different ministers
[1:14:15] that we have there it's an honor to be
[1:14:18] here and I want to thank brother Ben for
[1:14:20] the invitation he has uh uh graciously
[1:14:24] invited me to participate with you in
[1:14:27] this camp meeting and I guess for all of
[1:14:29] us to participate together with the Holy
[1:14:32] Spirit is really what it's all about
[1:14:34] we've come together to set aside the
[1:14:37] weekend that as our brother said that
[1:14:39] God might speak to us we the gift is
[1:14:43] just a mute instrument it's just the man
[1:14:46] is just a vessel and he can only yield
[1:14:48] himself to the Lord but it takes God to
[1:14:51] come on the scene and do something for
[1:14:53] us this weekend you believe that and uh
[1:14:57] we certainly want him to do that with
[1:14:59] all of our hearts this weekend uh I want
[1:15:03] to just say that I I've been taking a
[1:15:06] few pictures here and there as we've
[1:15:08] gone along the way and send some to my
[1:15:11] wife who sends her greetings and uh she
[1:15:15] said "Next time you go to New Zealand if
[1:15:17] there is a next time maybe when I'm done
[1:15:19] preaching there won't be a next time."
[1:15:22] But you know if there is a next time you
[1:15:24] know then we just She says "You got to
[1:15:27] bring me with you." She just so
[1:15:29] appreciated what she's seen uh by way of
[1:15:32] internet i was talking to brother
[1:15:33] Donaldson uh who we visited it visited
[1:15:36] with the other day and I said "You know
[1:15:39] it must have been hard back in the day i
[1:15:42] I remember when I first started out
[1:15:44] traveling and going into countries like
[1:15:46] India and and into African countries and
[1:15:49] you used to have to to search around for
[1:15:52] an internet cafe to try and send an
[1:15:54] email home and you'd have to sit there
[1:15:56] and type it out and send it off and and
[1:15:59] your family would get it eventually and
[1:16:01] they'd reply but uh now we have these
[1:16:04] cell phones and it's just instant
[1:16:06] communication and connection so it's not
[1:16:08] so hard as it used to be uh although we
[1:16:11] all like to be at home but there was a
[1:16:13] day when the message was new uh and I I
[1:16:17] just want to say something about that
[1:16:18] when it was just after God had sent a
[1:16:21] prophet and there were those that were
[1:16:22] traveling in the in the places that had
[1:16:24] never heard the message and you know
[1:16:26] they didn't have even internet cafes
[1:16:28] there was no internet back there they
[1:16:31] were traveling without cell phones they
[1:16:33] were breaking ground for us that we who
[1:16:36] have come in in this what looks like the
[1:16:40] last
[1:16:41] generation that we might have an easier
[1:16:44] road to travel and so we certainly
[1:16:47] appreciate those old saints that have
[1:16:49] plowed the ground for us amen and if and
[1:16:53] if you are here from that generation God
[1:16:56] bless you richly and but we've come to a
[1:16:59] time now that we believe we're the
[1:17:02] iniquity of the Amorites is just about
[1:17:04] full
[1:17:06] the world has turned into a a very uh
[1:17:10] wicked place and uh the devil has
[1:17:14] brought his Satan's Eden to his
[1:17:16] perfection
[1:17:17] but as the devil took a woman out of
[1:17:21] God's Eden to corrupt God is taking a
[1:17:24] woman out of Satan's Eden to perfect
[1:17:28] and so we praise God for that tonight
[1:17:31] are you looking forward to the word
[1:17:33] how many are hungry tonight amen how
[1:17:37] many are expecting tonight amen let's
[1:17:40] stand together and take our Bibles and
[1:17:42] turn to the book of Revelation chapter 6
[1:17:44] sorry to make you stand and sit down i
[1:17:46] didn't know how long it would take me to
[1:17:48] get all the butterflies in order i'm
[1:17:51] sure they're not all in order but we
[1:17:52] want to just uh trust the Lord that he
[1:17:56] will direct us this evening the way that
[1:17:59] we should go we have a lot on our
[1:18:03] uh people say a lot on their forks uh
[1:18:06] preachers like to say we have a lot on
[1:18:07] our forks a lot of hay in our wagon we
[1:18:09] got a Chinese brother at home Brother
[1:18:11] Murphy Wong he says "We have I have a
[1:18:13] lot on my chopsticks."
[1:18:15] And uh and so we we have different means
[1:18:19] of eating but we're all eating the same
[1:18:21] thing amen we're feeding on the
[1:18:24] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:18:26] let's bow our heads together in a word
[1:18:28] of
[1:18:31] prayer wonderful heavenly
[1:18:34] father you are the author of life and
[1:18:38] you're the giver of every good gift
[1:18:41] lord nothing happens in this world but
[1:18:44] what you know of it and you allow it oh
[1:18:47] God though we find Satan doing many evil
[1:18:51] things but Lord you have allowed it all
[1:18:53] for a purpose in the midst of it all
[1:18:56] Lord you are bringing about a redemptive
[1:18:59] purpose
[1:19:00] lord we are so honored to be living in
[1:19:03] the last days this is the most glorious
[1:19:07] age the greatest age when you would come
[1:19:10] in the fullness of your word for Lord
[1:19:13] you are the word that is right in the
[1:19:16] midst of your people tonight you are the
[1:19:18] one that discerns the thoughts and
[1:19:20] intents of every heart Lord and Father
[1:19:23] with all of my heart I want to just get
[1:19:25] myself out of the way and I believe that
[1:19:28] that is the prayer of everybody that's
[1:19:30] here we don't want our thoughts to be in
[1:19:32] the forefront Lord we want the
[1:19:35] distractions the labors of the day the
[1:19:37] travels everything that we put in to get
[1:19:39] to this place lord it's not about the
[1:19:42] the suppers it's not about the
[1:19:44] fellowship it's not about the what might
[1:19:46] happen during the daytime it's the
[1:19:48] central theme of it all is right now
[1:19:50] lord may you come in the power of your
[1:19:54] word may you look upon our hearts
[1:19:57] knowing what we have need of and direct
[1:19:59] the minister according to the way that
[1:20:01] you would desire it tonight amen we
[1:20:04] yield ourselves to you Lord the speaker
[1:20:06] and the hearer asking Father that not
[1:20:09] our will but your will be done lord I
[1:20:13] remember many years ago praying that
[1:20:16] those very words and it changed the
[1:20:18] course of my life and Lord now tonight
[1:20:20] we pray that your will would be done we
[1:20:24] ask Lord your blessing upon the reading
[1:20:26] and the speaking of your word in Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ's name amen amen amen revelation
[1:20:33] chapter 6 and we'll read from verse 7 i
[1:20:36] want to just read a little bit on the
[1:20:38] fourth seal we're not speaking on the
[1:20:41] fourth field but I want to speak about
[1:20:43] captured by love delivered from
[1:20:46] hell and when he had opened the fourth
[1:20:49] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[1:20:50] beast say "Come and see." I would stop
[1:20:54] there and say "We know that the fourth
[1:20:56] beast is the fourth anointing yeah the
[1:20:59] lion the ox the man and the eagle are
[1:21:01] the four anointings the eagle being the
[1:21:04] anointing of the Lord that flew out in
[1:21:06] the opening of the seals to combat the
[1:21:08] antichrist spirit in our age all right
[1:21:12] so it was the eagle that screamed "Come
[1:21:15] and see." Amen and I looked and behold a
[1:21:18] pale horse and his name that sat on him
[1:21:20] was death and hell followed with him and
[1:21:24] power was given unto them over the
[1:21:27] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[1:21:29] sword and with hunger and with death and
[1:21:32] with the beasts of the earth amen the
[1:21:36] Lord add his blessing to the word you
[1:21:37] may be
[1:21:43] seated i hope it's all right this is a
[1:21:45] camp meeting i can take my jacket off
[1:21:48] make myself at home amen now I want you
[1:21:51] to if you would my brother put that
[1:21:53] slideshow up for me right away and I
[1:21:55] want to just uh look for a moment on uh
[1:21:58] a few things just to bring it to your
[1:22:00] attention as a bit of a foundation uh
[1:22:02] this evening and I believe that the Lord
[1:22:05] has a mind for these meetings
[1:22:08] i believe that he knew I would be here
[1:22:10] and he knew that you would be here and
[1:22:12] he prepared me and he prepared you and
[1:22:16] because he's the one that wants to meet
[1:22:18] with us we are so fortunate to live in
[1:22:21] this time this seal is our seal it's
[1:22:25] it's the we we see the devil exposed
[1:22:28] he's given a name and his name is death
[1:22:30] if you give me I'll just point at you
[1:22:32] and you can do that that's great and
[1:22:34] when he had opened the fourth beast the
[1:22:35] fourth uh the fourth seal I heard the
[1:22:37] voice of the fourth beast say "Come and
[1:22:39] see." And I looked in a pale horse and
[1:22:42] his name that sat on him was death and
[1:22:46] hell followed with him and I want you to
[1:22:48] notice that now because now this one who
[1:22:50] was a master of disguise hiding himself
[1:22:53] so subtly in the seven church ages till
[1:22:55] even under the first seal he was a white
[1:22:58] horse rider and many throughout the ages
[1:23:00] thought it was Christ right he was he
[1:23:03] was disguising himself but he but he was
[1:23:06] moving in subtlety within the church and
[1:23:08] that and he be what began first as a as
[1:23:12] a a spirit and then become a doctrine
[1:23:14] and on into the church and how he began
[1:23:17] to sew different things so that there
[1:23:19] was two vines growing within the
[1:23:20] framework of the church but in the last
[1:23:23] days the two vines would be exposed and
[1:23:25] the bride would be able to discern the
[1:23:27] difference between the true vine and the
[1:23:29] false vine and she would be able to
[1:23:31] withstand the false vine and by doing so
[1:23:35] she would become an invincible army amen
[1:23:38] all right now it's so it says here him
[1:23:42] that sat on this horse was death and
[1:23:45] hell followed with
[1:23:49] him i got my clicker there at the back
[1:23:51] i'm just practicing with a finger here
[1:23:54] all
[1:23:54] right says "And it's," and I want to
[1:23:57] read out of the amplified it says "And
[1:23:58] its writer's name was death and Hades
[1:24:02] the realm of the dead followed him
[1:24:04] closely." All right so now this puts a
[1:24:06] little bit different perspective on it
[1:24:08] not necessarily to believers but from
[1:24:10] the King James it it shows us that that
[1:24:14] this one who was whose name was death
[1:24:16] there was a region that was following
[1:24:18] him it's a region of those that are lost
[1:24:22] that are eternally separated from God
[1:24:24] because that's what hell is hell was
[1:24:28] created for the devil and his angels and
[1:24:31] those that the devil takes captive is
[1:24:34] the ones that he takes to hell but now
[1:24:36] when he rides out in this hour as he's
[1:24:39] moving in this generation his name is
[1:24:41] death and a hell or Hades the region of
[1:24:45] the dead is following him closely
[1:24:48] all right now in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:24:50] 15 the apostle Paul picks this up we
[1:24:52] realize the book of revel revelation was
[1:24:54] a series of visions that was seen by
[1:24:57] John and on the aisle of Patmos over the
[1:24:59] course of two years and many times
[1:25:01] that's why people cannot uh catch the
[1:25:04] continuity of the book of Revelation
[1:25:05] because they're different visions it's
[1:25:07] not all one vision so John saw a vision
[1:25:10] of Christ in the midst of the church
[1:25:12] john saw a vision of the seven church
[1:25:14] ages john saw a vision of the throne and
[1:25:16] the and the lamb redeeming the book john
[1:25:18] sees the vision of the opening of the
[1:25:20] seal so you see it's a series of visions
[1:25:23] and John just happens to record them in
[1:25:25] the way that he sees them but now in 1
[1:25:27] Corinthians 15 Paul by the same Holy
[1:25:30] Spirit that gave John the vision is that
[1:25:33] right he's now seeing the end time and
[1:25:37] he describes it here and he says "Behold
[1:25:38] I show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:25:41] sleep but we shall all be changed in a
[1:25:44] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[1:25:46] last trump for the trumpet shall sound
[1:25:49] and the dead shall be raised
[1:25:51] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:25:54] praise the Lord for this corruptible
[1:25:57] must put on incorruption amen i like the
[1:26:00] uncction of the Holy Spirit there this
[1:26:02] corruptible must put on incorruption
[1:26:05] every day of your life you ought to have
[1:26:06] that attitude this corruptible must put
[1:26:09] on incorruption it doesn't have a choice
[1:26:12] because I have received the word of the
[1:26:14] Lord this corruptible must put on
[1:26:16] incorruption this mortal must put on
[1:26:19] immortality amen so when this
[1:26:21] corruptible shall have put on
[1:26:23] incorruption and this mortal shall have
[1:26:25] put on immortality then shall be brought
[1:26:28] to pass the saying that is written death
[1:26:31] is swallowed up in victory so now here's
[1:26:34] the Apostle Paul caught up in the spirit
[1:26:37] in the last days maybe not by vision
[1:26:39] like John was precisely but he's still
[1:26:42] in the same anointing and he catches it
[1:26:44] on this last verse and he says "Oh death
[1:26:46] where is thy sting oh grave Hades the
[1:26:50] regions of the lost where is thy
[1:26:53] victory?" So Paul describes the victory
[1:26:56] in this hour the final victory which is
[1:26:58] the body change and he says "Death and
[1:27:01] hell can have no victory over us." Amen
[1:27:05] we're living in that generation
[1:27:07] hallelujah
[1:27:08] where hell is riding out in this in this
[1:27:10] realm and we realize that we're we're
[1:27:13] combating something here
[1:27:16] all right
[1:27:19] all right here we go brother Brandham
[1:27:21] said makes this statement he says
[1:27:24] there's a certain person said to me he
[1:27:25] said "I believe you're an
[1:27:27] antichrist." I said "If amen." Brother
[1:27:29] Brandham says I said "If that would be
[1:27:31] pleasing to my Lord that's what I want
[1:27:34] to be."
[1:27:36] Don't get too many amens when we read
[1:27:38] that one do we
[1:27:40] he says "I want to be whatever he wants
[1:27:42] me to be." How many would say amen to
[1:27:44] that
[1:27:46] i love him and if he should cast me into
[1:27:50] hell
[1:27:51] I will still love I still will love him
[1:27:54] if I go with the same spirit that I have
[1:27:57] now he's talking about the same attitude
[1:27:59] that he has now and then he says "He
[1:28:01] looked at me kind of strange probably
[1:28:03] kind of like you're looking at me right
[1:28:04] now." And and so Brother Brandham was
[1:28:07] saying you know it doesn't matter
[1:28:08] because I'm so in love with God if he
[1:28:11] would cast me into hell I would still
[1:28:13] love him and many times we look at
[1:28:16] ourselves and say I wonder if we could
[1:28:18] measure up to that but if you're here
[1:28:20] tonight full of the Holy Ghost loving
[1:28:22] the Lord I will say you have already
[1:28:24] measured up to this amen because you are
[1:28:27] living in hell that's right death has
[1:28:31] ridden out and hell follows after him
[1:28:36] hello you're living in the re in the
[1:28:38] time where the scripture says it would
[1:28:40] be hell upon the
[1:28:42] earth where demon powers would be
[1:28:45] streaming forth where 200,000 thousand
[1:28:47] or 200 million spiritual demons more
[1:28:50] than ever before would be moving back
[1:28:52] and forth in this earth taking the
[1:28:54] deceived and turning them against the
[1:28:56] elect turned against the Jews in the
[1:28:59] natural and turned against the bride and
[1:29:00] the spiritual so we realize we're right
[1:29:03] now living in a region where there's
[1:29:04] hell all around us it's Satan's Eden
[1:29:07] it's bombarding us over the media it's
[1:29:09] bombarding us where in the in the stores
[1:29:12] i I was sitting today i had to check out
[1:29:14] of my hotel before Brother Ben arrived
[1:29:16] and he was busy running some errands and
[1:29:18] so I was sitting in the lobby and
[1:29:20] they're they're sitting in the hotel
[1:29:21] lobby they're bombarding the lobby with
[1:29:23] rock and roll music i'm thinking I don't
[1:29:26] want to sit in this atmosphere and so I
[1:29:29] checked my bags with them and I said I'm
[1:29:31] going to go for a walk i'll come back
[1:29:32] when brother Ben arrives and so I went
[1:29:34] down for a walk down the street but
[1:29:35] there was hell down the street
[1:29:39] everywhere you look there's hell on
[1:29:40] every side i went into the coffee shop
[1:29:42] and there was hell playing over the
[1:29:44] loudspeakers everywhere that I walked
[1:29:46] around and it isn't just New Zealand
[1:29:48] it's Canada too america too it's every
[1:29:50] nation in the world wherever you go it's
[1:29:53] hell on every hand but though he cast me
[1:29:57] into hell I will still love him
[1:30:01] hallelujah
[1:30:03] doesn't matter that the music of hell is
[1:30:04] playing on every hand I still love him
[1:30:07] and I hate that music you know I used to
[1:30:09] love rock and roll music right i used to
[1:30:12] love it when I was in the world and
[1:30:13] actually when I was in the denomination
[1:30:15] is where I came from and I had a taste
[1:30:17] for rock and roll music used to play it
[1:30:18] all the time but when God changed my
[1:30:21] life when the word came by my way what I
[1:30:24] once love I now hate
[1:30:28] i cannot stand to hear those kind of
[1:30:31] things anymore whereas once it was the
[1:30:32] the diet that I fed upon what happened i
[1:30:36] once walked according to the spirit that
[1:30:38] now works in the children of
[1:30:39] disobedience and we all did but God who
[1:30:42] is rich in mercy came by my way and
[1:30:46] brought me in the midst of hell into his
[1:30:48] presence thank you Lord amen so that I
[1:30:52] can see hell on every hand i I was I was
[1:30:54] reading the news the other day and and
[1:30:57] uh I was uh there was they were talking
[1:30:59] about a show found out it was a
[1:31:01] television show all I knew was was that
[1:31:03] it was a show because it had been in the
[1:31:05] news quite often and it was quite
[1:31:07] popular and uh and so I won't tell you
[1:31:09] the title of it i don't know if I even
[1:31:11] remember the title of it but they were
[1:31:12] they were always talking about this in
[1:31:14] the news so So I was reading this
[1:31:15] article and they had a a clip and they
[1:31:18] call it I think a
[1:31:19] trailer i thought a trailer was
[1:31:21] something you pulled behind a vehicle
[1:31:23] but they had a trailer that uh is like a
[1:31:28] I don't know how you describe it's a
[1:31:29] series of scenes a short little clip of
[1:31:32] the scenes that are in the show all
[1:31:34] right and so they had it in the article
[1:31:36] because it's on the internet now you get
[1:31:38] print you get pictures you get video you
[1:31:40] get whatever you want and so I thought
[1:31:42] you know I'm going to I'm going to look
[1:31:43] at this short video i don't want to look
[1:31:45] at the whole show but I'll look at the
[1:31:46] short video because everybody's talking
[1:31:47] about this show i want to see what
[1:31:50] they're talking about it was about a
[1:31:51] two-minute video i guess that's two
[1:31:54] minutes
[1:31:57] and just a short video and uh and so as
[1:32:02] I I clicked play I could only take about
[1:32:05] 30 seconds of it and I had to shut it
[1:32:08] off it wasn't immoral uh as far as
[1:32:12] nudity or anything like that but it was
[1:32:14] violent and vile and corrupt and I it
[1:32:18] just shocked me and I don't think I'm
[1:32:21] that naive in the world but it just so
[1:32:24] shocked me so much i thought it ought to
[1:32:26] be against the law to even portray what
[1:32:29] they're portraying in a video it ought
[1:32:33] to be a criminal act what is it the
[1:32:35] people have gone insane
[1:32:38] hell is upon the earth their minds are
[1:32:41] being prepared for the tribulation time
[1:32:44] where they'll they'll come in the
[1:32:46] imagination of their thoughts they'll go
[1:32:48] to totally insane because they'll
[1:32:50] imagine that they're seeing giant
[1:32:52] creatures and things city blocks wide
[1:32:54] and as brother Brandham describes it
[1:32:56] it'll be a it'll be a mental thing in
[1:32:58] their minds what is it it's the very
[1:33:00] things they're seeing in their movies
[1:33:02] right now the statistics are that over
[1:33:05] half the population United States are on
[1:33:07] some kind of anxiety medication
[1:33:11] over half the population listen New
[1:33:13] Zealand's no different i was talking to
[1:33:14] the brothers they say New Zealand has
[1:33:16] one of the highest suicide rates in the
[1:33:18] world beautiful country like this and
[1:33:21] has everything going for it what is it
[1:33:23] it's insanity and it's hell that's
[1:33:25] bombarding the minds of the people and
[1:33:27] you're in the midst of it but though
[1:33:29] we're in the midst of it I'll still love
[1:33:31] him thank you Lord i will still love him
[1:33:34] it doesn't matter what happens I'll
[1:33:36] still love him amen that's right amen
[1:33:40] so you're here
[1:33:42] amen praise the Lord here we are let's
[1:33:47] get used to it not get used to hell but
[1:33:50] used to the fact of where we are and
[1:33:51] what it means all right now we realize
[1:33:54] we've come through seven church ages and
[1:33:57] uh you know we use this terminology and
[1:33:59] I'm going to put some terminology up
[1:34:00] here not to discuss it but just
[1:34:05] to this brother is very sick right now
[1:34:08] all right we're going to pray for
[1:34:09] everybody bow your heads heavenly Father
[1:34:12] Lord we just lay hands upon our brother
[1:34:14] in the name of Jesus Christ lord I ask
[1:34:17] that you will come on the scene and
[1:34:19] restore him oh God lord he's perhaps
[1:34:22] overheated but Lord right now in the
[1:34:24] midst of your people Lord may the
[1:34:27] healing virtue that was loosed at
[1:34:28] Calvary come upon his mortal body lord
[1:34:31] in Jesus Christ's name we lay hands upon
[1:34:34] him and you said these signs would
[1:34:36] follow them that believe if they lay
[1:34:38] their hands on the sick they shall
[1:34:40] recover so we rebuke this illness in the
[1:34:44] name of Jesus Christ for the glory of
[1:34:46] the kingdom of God
[1:34:49] amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah how
[1:34:53] you feeling not good take him to the
[1:34:55] back there get him some fresh
[1:34:57] air you're right maybe it's another

[1:35:04] air and some water amen the word
[1:35:07] Hallelujah heals amen
[1:35:09] all
[1:35:11] right so now we've come through seven
[1:35:14] church ages and we realize that we've
[1:35:16] arrived at the Leodysian age and you
[1:35:19] know we we can talk about all the seven
[1:35:22] uh messengers and the seven ages and all
[1:35:24] of those kind of things and it's and
[1:35:26] it's terminology that we use in the
[1:35:28] message we realize that in the Bible
[1:35:30] that there's five comeings of Elijah and
[1:35:33] and uh they're coming the last one is
[1:35:35] coming to Israel but we've come in the
[1:35:37] time of the fourth coming of Elijah
[1:35:39] which is brother Brandham and how that
[1:35:41] his ministry was sent in this last days
[1:35:43] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:35:44] to the father we know that that we've
[1:35:47] come through three exoduses and we're in
[1:35:48] the third exodus the first exodus was
[1:35:51] Israel coming out of Egypt the second
[1:35:53] exodus was the church coming from law to
[1:35:55] grace the third exodus is the exodus
[1:35:57] we're in i'm showing you all these
[1:35:59] things for a reason we're in the fourth
[1:36:01] seal as I already said under the fourth
[1:36:03] anointing we could talk about the day of
[1:36:05] the Lord the shout voice and trumpet how
[1:36:08] that perilous times is come when men
[1:36:10] shall be lovers of themselves more than
[1:36:12] lovers of God you know that's that's one
[1:36:14] almost that we could stop on and talk
[1:36:16] about how that we're in a narcissistic
[1:36:18] age you know how that that uh uh how
[1:36:22] many knows what narcissism is all right
[1:36:25] narcissism actually comes from a Greek
[1:36:27] it's a Greek term that comes from the
[1:36:28] story of Narcissus and Narcissus was a a
[1:36:32] man that was cursed by the gods to fall
[1:36:35] in love with
[1:36:36] himself and so when he when he happened
[1:36:39] to come across a pool of water you know
[1:36:41] he he he looked into the pool of water
[1:36:44] and he saw him his own reflection and
[1:36:47] you know he was so in love with his own
[1:36:52] reflection that he immediately had to
[1:36:55] take a picture of himself
[1:37:01] and post it on Facebook
[1:37:12] amen
[1:37:14] narcissistic men shall be lovers of
[1:37:16] their own selves more than lovers of God
[1:37:19] amen heady high-minded false accusers
[1:37:23] etc etc we're living in those kind of
[1:37:25] times oh maybe you never heard about
[1:37:27] Facebook but that's the kind of time
[1:37:28] that we're living in as it was in the
[1:37:30] days of Lot as it was in the days of
[1:37:32] Noah that's the hour that we're living
[1:37:35] in then when Lot's day when they ate
[1:37:37] they drank they married they were given
[1:37:39] in marriage which things in themselves
[1:37:41] are not bad but when those are all that
[1:37:43] people think about that's when it
[1:37:45] becomes evil and they're all the
[1:37:48] people's minds was on their daytoday
[1:37:50] lives and you know it can get that way
[1:37:52] amongst believers
[1:37:54] hello it can get that way to the job
[1:37:57] consumes our thoughts and then the
[1:37:59] family and and marriages and what's
[1:38:02] going to happen with our life and you
[1:38:03] know young girls are so worried about
[1:38:05] you know who am I going to marry and
[1:38:07] boys are worried about you know who's
[1:38:08] going to be the right one for me listen
[1:38:10] the thing you need to worry about is
[1:38:11] being the right one not finding the
[1:38:14] right one amen god will do the finding
[1:38:17] if you'll do the being amen
[1:38:21] amen as it was in Lot's day as it was in
[1:38:24] Noah's day we could talk about a bride
[1:38:26] age and how that we've come not beyond
[1:38:29] seven church ages we're still in Leodosa
[1:38:32] if we talk about time but in the midst
[1:38:34] of Leadyia a church a bride has been
[1:38:37] called out of a church and we realize
[1:38:40] even there was a prophet that said "I no
[1:38:42] longer call you church but I call you
[1:38:43] bride." And if we could only realize and
[1:38:46] I'll maybe speak about that in another
[1:38:47] service but it wasn't the voice of a
[1:38:50] prophet and that's why it's not the gift
[1:38:52] it's the voice that's speaking through
[1:38:54] the gift it wasn't a man that was saying
[1:38:57] "I no longer call you church i call you
[1:39:00] bride." It was the bridegroom that was
[1:39:02] saying "I no longer call you church i
[1:39:06] call you bride."
[1:39:08] Amen what an age to be living in where
[1:39:11] the where brother Brandham said there'll
[1:39:12] be another Ephesian age so we'll come
[1:39:14] right back to the beginning the original
[1:39:16] word but there'll be a great falling
[1:39:18] away in this age and you know we could
[1:39:19] go on and on and on and talk about all
[1:39:22] these things
[1:39:25] but the important part is this part
[1:39:28] you're here all right regardless of
[1:39:31] what's going on around you you're here
[1:39:34] and furthermore God is here
[1:39:38] and that's why the Apostle Paul picks it
[1:39:39] up in Romans chapter 8 and he says "What
[1:39:41] shall we then say to these things if God
[1:39:45] be before us who can be against us
[1:39:49] all
[1:39:52] right israel Kadesh Barnea had a similar
[1:39:55] issue there's a lot of distractions
[1:39:58] to rob them from the inheritance that
[1:40:00] laid right before them do you realize
[1:40:03] that the word has been revealed the
[1:40:06] mystery of God is finished i think we
[1:40:08] realize that as believers i'm speaking
[1:40:09] to believers amen and that all the
[1:40:12] promises or the full word of God is in
[1:40:16] effect there's nothing that's not in
[1:40:18] effect absolutely and the mystery of God
[1:40:21] being finished the lamb redeeming the
[1:40:22] book has brought the title deed back not
[1:40:25] for angels but for the human the human
[1:40:27] race the sons and daughters of God to
[1:40:30] have an inheritance so like Israel was
[1:40:32] at Kadesh Barnea we are standing right
[1:40:34] with the title deed within our hands we
[1:40:37] are called to possess all of it
[1:40:40] all right but look at what Israel had
[1:40:42] just been through just for a moment they
[1:40:45] had seen the two signs that God had
[1:40:47] given Moses supernatural ministry that
[1:40:49] attracted their attention and then they
[1:40:52] rec they they were in the midst of Egypt
[1:40:54] uh under bondage but there come 10
[1:40:56] plagues upon Egypt the last plague of
[1:40:59] course being death and they were there
[1:41:02] to see all of these catastrophic events
[1:41:05] that were there in uh uh Egypt and we
[1:41:08] realize that as believers we are in
[1:41:10] birth pains or and I say we we're in the
[1:41:13] midst of an earth with birth pains this
[1:41:15] birth must give way this earth must give
[1:41:18] way by birth to another civilization
[1:41:22] there's going to be a people come upon
[1:41:24] the face of the earth that the earth was
[1:41:26] made for the earth was not made for
[1:41:30] what's on it right now this is Satan's
[1:41:33] corruption of the creation but the
[1:41:36] righteous in the millennium time will
[1:41:38] walk out upon the ashes of the wicked
[1:41:41] and so we see where that like Israel
[1:41:44] were standing at just such a moment you
[1:41:47] know they they had just come through the
[1:41:49] passage of the Red Sea they had been on
[1:41:51] the other side where it looked like they
[1:41:52] were trapped and how that God likes to
[1:41:54] bring his people into situations where
[1:41:56] he can show his power and show how much
[1:41:58] he loves them you know you'd never know
[1:42:01] him as as a healer if you didn't get
[1:42:03] sick amen that's right you never knew
[1:42:06] him as a deliverer if you never were in
[1:42:07] bondage
[1:42:09] you never knew him as a savior if you
[1:42:11] were never lost and so God wants to
[1:42:13] reveal himself in certain ways so Israel
[1:42:15] were trapped by the Red Sea but God
[1:42:17] supernaturally opened the Red Sea and
[1:42:20] then closed it upon the Egyptians that
[1:42:22] were pursuing them there they ran out of
[1:42:25] water not a good thing
[1:42:29] but God sent Moses to strike the rock
[1:42:32] and they already drank water from the
[1:42:34] rock supernatural mana from heaven they
[1:42:38] run out of food but God sent me food
[1:42:40] from heaven to supernaturally appear
[1:42:43] every morning they had been to the
[1:42:45] mountain and they had seen his presence
[1:42:47] on the mountain and so they experienced
[1:42:50] all of these things and and they they
[1:42:53] saw the Ten Commandments come from God
[1:42:56] on the mountain and the tabernacle was
[1:42:58] established there by the mountain and
[1:43:01] and they they also had already seen some
[1:43:04] things that were not very good miam was
[1:43:06] smitten with
[1:43:08] leprosy dayan and Kora was still in
[1:43:10] their midst
[1:43:12] they had had a pl a couple of plagues
[1:43:14] already amongst themselves
[1:43:17] and so this has all happened in the
[1:43:20] space of two years
[1:43:22] all right now let's stop for a minute we
[1:43:24] often read the Bible and just kind of
[1:43:25] glaze over this if all of these things
[1:43:27] had happened in New Zealand in the last
[1:43:29] two years I would be speaking to a shell
[1:43:32] shocked people
[1:43:36] come on and they didn't have the Holy
[1:43:38] Ghost
[1:43:41] but God was expecting by this time in
[1:43:43] the space of two years hello in the
[1:43:47] space of two years God was expecting
[1:43:49] that they would receive the message by
[1:43:51] faith and be able to possess the land
[1:43:56] my so here they were at at Kadesh
[1:44:00] Barnea but the important thing was this
[1:44:02] right here forget about everything else
[1:44:04] that has happened sometimes we need to
[1:44:06] realize that right within the message
[1:44:08] forget about everything else that has
[1:44:09] happened forget about everything that's
[1:44:12] taken place that though a thousand fall
[1:44:15] on your right hand and 10,000 on your
[1:44:17] left it will not come nigh thee amen you
[1:44:21] will be an overcomer because there are
[1:44:23] ordained to be overcomers in this age
[1:44:27] you're still with me this this evening
[1:44:29] israel was
[1:44:31] there try this finger again there it is
[1:44:34] god was
[1:44:38] there and Joshua had a revelation
[1:44:42] joshua had a revelation if the Lord
[1:44:45] delight in us then he will bring us into
[1:44:48] this land and give it us amen a land
[1:44:52] which flowth with milk and honey
[1:44:56] if the Lord delight in us
[1:45:00] now let's bring it into the third Exodus
[1:45:03] if the Lord delight in us it doesn't
[1:45:05] matter that we're living in hell
[1:45:08] if the Lord delight in us it doesn't
[1:45:10] matter that there's been a great falling
[1:45:12] away if the Lord delight in us it
[1:45:15] doesn't matter what opposition we have
[1:45:18] if the Lord delight in us he will bring
[1:45:20] us into possess the full inheritance of
[1:45:23] his word
[1:45:30] thank you i think that's the end of
[1:45:31] those slides
[1:45:34] take your Bibles and turn with me to
[1:45:35] Numbers chapter 14 if you
[1:45:38] would i want to just look at this
[1:45:40] thought of Kadesh Barnea for a little
[1:45:44] bit because if we see some of the things
[1:45:47] happening
[1:45:48] here it will help us to
[1:45:51] understand because the spirits don't die
[1:45:56] spirits don't die the devil takes his
[1:45:59] man but he leaves the spirit amen god
[1:46:02] takes his man but he leaves the Holy
[1:46:03] Spirit all right so now in Numbers
[1:46:07] chapter 14 is where we find Israel
[1:46:09] rejecting the promised land and uh I'm
[1:46:13] going to pick it up here at uh if we go
[1:46:17] from uh verse one we would read we won't
[1:46:20] read it but we would read about how that
[1:46:22] the congregation was all upset at Moses
[1:46:25] and Aaron and the leaders because they
[1:46:27] brought them to this land they said
[1:46:28] "Have you made us to die?" and they want
[1:46:30] to take a make a captain to take them
[1:46:32] back to Egypt so there was a spirit of
[1:46:34] rebellion moving amongst the people and
[1:46:37] they wanted to go back to Egypt and
[1:46:39] Joshua stands up and says to them the
[1:46:41] scripture that I read if the Lord
[1:46:43] delight in us then he will bring us into
[1:46:45] the land and give it us a land which
[1:46:47] flowth with milk and honey and verse 10
[1:46:50] it says "But all the congregation bade
[1:46:53] stoned them with stones and the glory of
[1:46:56] the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of
[1:46:58] the congregation before all the children
[1:47:01] of Israel." And the Lord said unto Moses
[1:47:05] "How long will this people provoke me
[1:47:08] and how long will it be heir they
[1:47:11] believe me for all the signs which I
[1:47:13] have shown amongst them
[1:47:16] i will smite them with the pestilence
[1:47:18] and disinherit them and will make of
[1:47:20] thee a greater nation and mightier than
[1:47:22] they." So now notice what God is saying
[1:47:24] here says "Moses just step out of the
[1:47:27] way here i'm going to kill everybody
[1:47:29] else and I'm going to raise up a new
[1:47:31] nation out of you." All right and Moses
[1:47:35] said to the Lord "Then the Egyptians
[1:47:38] shall hear it for thou broughtest up
[1:47:40] this people and thy might from among
[1:47:41] them and they will tell it to the
[1:47:43] inhabitants of this land for they have
[1:47:45] heard that thou Lord art among this
[1:47:48] people that thou Lord art seen face to
[1:47:50] face and thy cloud standeth over them
[1:47:52] and thou goest before them by daytime in
[1:47:54] a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of
[1:47:56] fire by night
[1:47:58] now if thou shalt kill all this people
[1:48:00] as one man then the nations that have
[1:48:02] heard of the fame of thee will speak
[1:48:03] saying Because the Lord was not able to
[1:48:05] bring this people into the land which he
[1:48:08] swore unto them therefore he has slain
[1:48:10] them in the wilderness and now I beseech
[1:48:14] you let the power of my Lord be great
[1:48:17] according as thou hast
[1:48:18] spoken saying The Lord is long-suffering
[1:48:22] of great mercy forgiving iniquities and
[1:48:24] transgressions and by no means clearing
[1:48:26] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[1:48:28] fathers upon the children unto the third
[1:48:31] and fourth generation then he says
[1:48:33] "Pardon I beseech thee the iniquity of
[1:48:36] these people according unto the
[1:48:38] greatness of thy mercy and as thou has
[1:48:42] forgiven this people from Egypt even
[1:48:44] until now." And the Lord said "I have
[1:48:47] pardoned according to thy word." Now
[1:48:50] this is a powerful passage because God
[1:48:53] says "Step out of the way Moses." And
[1:48:55] Moses doesn't move he says "Lord I'm not
[1:48:57] going to let you kill them
[1:49:00] if you're going to kill him you're have
[1:49:01] to going to go you're going to have to
[1:49:02] go through me and he begins to speak
[1:49:06] back to the Lord under the uncction of
[1:49:09] the same Lord
[1:49:13] so it's God's love speaking to God's
[1:49:15] justice
[1:49:18] now which one prevailed
[1:49:21] the love was greater than the justice
[1:49:24] all right so Moses was a type of Christ
[1:49:28] and we know God so loved the world that
[1:49:30] he gave his only begotten son so Jesus
[1:49:33] Christ was the love of God that was
[1:49:35] projected into the world whose blood
[1:49:38] speaks better things than that of Abel
[1:49:41] which blood cried from the ground for
[1:49:44] justice
[1:49:46] all right so Abel's blood cried unto God
[1:49:49] god came down and judged Cain jesus
[1:49:52] blood cried unto God and God forgives
[1:49:57] hallelujah and so that's why as
[1:49:59] believers we want to accept what God is
[1:50:01] has given us of the blood of Jesus
[1:50:04] Christ now Moses representing Christ
[1:50:06] here in chapter 14 there's a rejection
[1:50:09] if we would read further in the chapter
[1:50:10] you find out that the children of Israel
[1:50:12] God says to them "All right I've
[1:50:14] pardoned you but the generation that
[1:50:16] said they're not able to possess the
[1:50:18] land they're going to die in the
[1:50:19] wilderness."
[1:50:21] Now I want you to look at verse
[1:50:24] 15 or chapter 15 I mean and verse
[1:50:28] one now God has just finished saying
[1:50:31] this generation will die in the
[1:50:32] wilderness the very next
[1:50:35] statement and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:50:37] saying speak unto the children of Israel
[1:50:40] and say unto them when you come into the
[1:50:43] land of your habitations which I give
[1:50:46] unto you all right now here's God saying
[1:50:49] "These people will not possess the
[1:50:50] land." And the next sermon that Moses
[1:50:53] preaches under direct order of the Lord
[1:50:56] preaches about "You're going to go in
[1:50:58] and possess the land." Amen now what's
[1:51:00] taking place here that generation did
[1:51:02] perish in the wilderness so what exactly
[1:51:05] is God doing here he's beginning to
[1:51:08] direct Moses to point his message to the
[1:51:12] next generation
[1:51:14] all right so he's this generation is
[1:51:17] rejected but God doesn't stop Moses from
[1:51:19] preaching says "Moses you're still
[1:51:21] preaching the word you're still laying
[1:51:23] the word in there but these people have
[1:51:25] a stony heart these people won't be able
[1:51:27] to receive it but there's a generation
[1:51:29] coming up under them and that generation
[1:51:32] is going to receive my message that
[1:51:35] generation is going to possess the land
[1:51:37] that generation is going to believe
[1:51:39] she's the bride that generation is going
[1:51:42] to believe this message is for her amen
[1:51:45] that generation is going to accept what
[1:51:47] I sent even though the previous
[1:51:50] generation couldn't enter fully into it
[1:51:52] because they still had Egypt or Egypt
[1:51:56] flowing through their minds but there's
[1:51:58] a generation that has grown up now that
[1:52:00] says we're more than able to possess all
[1:52:03] that God has given us
[1:52:06] amen amen all right so let's look at
[1:52:10] this just a little bit further here
[1:52:11] we're going to chapter 16
[1:52:15] now the historians say between chapter
[1:52:17] 15 and chapter 16 is actually 20 years i
[1:52:21] don't know whether it is or not but
[1:52:22] that's what the historian says there so
[1:52:24] there's a space of time here between God
[1:52:27] speaking to Israel in chapter 15 and
[1:52:30] chapter 16 where Dayan and Kora rise up
[1:52:33] we'll start at verse
[1:52:35] one now Kora the son of Ishar son of
[1:52:38] Kath the son of Levi and Dayathan and
[1:52:40] Abram the sons of Ilab and Anne and the
[1:52:44] the son of Paleth and sons of Reuben
[1:52:46] took men and they rose up before Moses
[1:52:50] with certain of the children of Israel
[1:52:53] 250 princes of the assembly famous in
[1:52:56] the congregation men of renown all right
[1:53:00] let's stop for a minute now from Egypt
[1:53:02] to Kadesh Barnea is two years from
[1:53:05] Kadesh Barnea to here they say is 20
[1:53:07] more years so the message is 22 years
[1:53:10] old all right so now after 22 years in
[1:53:14] the message there become those that
[1:53:16] begin to rise up in the message which
[1:53:18] the Bible calls as men of renown
[1:53:23] men with names men who try to gather a
[1:53:26] following after themselves
[1:53:29] all right and who do they rise up
[1:53:31] against they rise up against Moses and
[1:53:34] so they begin
[1:53:36] to interpret the message to the people
[1:53:39] if I could say it that way and uh and
[1:53:43] they say to Moses in verse three "And
[1:53:46] they gathered themselves together
[1:53:47] against Moses and against Aaron and said
[1:53:49] unto them you take too much upon
[1:53:52] yourself seeing all the congregation are
[1:53:55] holy every one of them and the Lord is
[1:53:57] among them wherefore then lift ye up
[1:54:00] yourselves above the congregation of the
[1:54:02] Lord?" And when Moses heard it he fell
[1:54:06] upon his
[1:54:08] face all right
[1:54:14] now maybe you put this slideshow up
[1:54:17] there called standing in the
[1:54:19] gap i just I just I was looking at these
[1:54:22] statement these statements these
[1:54:24] scriptures when I came across the
[1:54:26] statements that brother Brandham read
[1:54:28] immediately after reading the scripture
[1:54:31] in the message standing in the gap where
[1:54:34] he reads out of numbers chapter 16 and
[1:54:36] verse 3 and 4 and it begins to describe
[1:54:38] what's going on in the feelings of God
[1:54:40] and the attitude of God towards this now
[1:54:45] you can go ahead and start
[1:54:47] that and
[1:54:49] Uh brother Brandon begins to say "Yeah
[1:54:52] go ahead give me the first one." Of this
[1:54:54] time that we're speaking or reading of
[1:54:56] course we all understand that it was
[1:54:58] when Dayan and Kora had decided that
[1:55:01] they would
[1:55:02] interfere with the commission that God
[1:55:04] had given to
[1:55:06] Moses saying "You ought to let the whole
[1:55:08] congregation do such and such they're
[1:55:11] all holy." All right now what was the
[1:55:14] attitude or the statement that Brother
[1:55:16] Brandon makes he says "It isn't just
[1:55:17] that they're they're they got another
[1:55:19] idea or they have an idea but they're
[1:55:21] actually interfering with the commission
[1:55:23] of God they're interfering with what God
[1:55:27] is doing in that hour." There's a great
[1:55:29] exodus going on and they were getting in
[1:55:32] the way rather than stepping back and
[1:55:35] letting God do what God was going to do
[1:55:38] they gathered men of renown in other
[1:55:40] words there was a genuine lack of
[1:55:42] humility and they felt that they all had
[1:55:44] ability and there was maybe no arguing
[1:55:47] with their ability but their actions
[1:55:49] begin to cause interference in the plan
[1:55:52] of God for that age now the Bible we
[1:55:54] know says that no flesh will glory in
[1:55:57] his presence nobody going to rise up and
[1:56:00] say I got an idea or I got the ability
[1:56:02] we know when Moses was down in Egypt and
[1:56:04] says thought that he had the ability
[1:56:06] even when he was called to deliver the
[1:56:08] children of Israel all he could produce
[1:56:11] was one dead stinking Egyptian he had to
[1:56:14] get that ability beat out of him on the
[1:56:16] backside of the desert till he could
[1:56:18] come into contact with the presence of
[1:56:20] God in the pillar of fire in the burning
[1:56:22] bush and feel like he was not able to do
[1:56:25] it and God could tell him "You're just
[1:56:27] in condition now that you can do it."
[1:56:30] It's when you think you can't do it that
[1:56:32] finally I can use you because God's
[1:56:35] strength is made perfect in our weakness
[1:56:39] all right so
[1:56:43] Moses we find that he falls on his face
[1:56:45] give me the next one please brother says
[1:56:48] "And God commanded Moses to lead the
[1:56:51] people to the promised land." And they
[1:56:54] said "You take it upon yourself to do
[1:56:56] too much you that try to make yourself
[1:56:58] the only one in the bunch that's God."
[1:57:01] And he say so well actually Moses didn't
[1:57:03] make himself that it was God that made
[1:57:06] him that
[1:57:07] you know God sent a prophet in this hour
[1:57:09] with a message he didn't make himself
[1:57:11] that he didn't give himself a gift he
[1:57:15] didn't he didn't cause uh the attraction
[1:57:18] that gathered the people together that
[1:57:20] was so supernaturally vindicated you
[1:57:22] know sometimes
[1:57:25] uh God has a way of showing us the
[1:57:28] vindication even though we've never been
[1:57:31] there
[1:57:32] i was raised to the age of 22 years old
[1:57:35] and I had never heard the name William
[1:57:37] Brown until somebody witnessed to me
[1:57:41] about the message and then when I told
[1:57:44] my parents about it I found out that my
[1:57:48] mother was healed in brother Brandham's
[1:57:50] meetings
[1:57:52] isn't that an amazing thing but not
[1:57:55] believing the message as a matter of
[1:57:56] fact being very much against the message
[1:57:57] for various reasons I won't go into but
[1:58:00] when I was very young in the ministry I
[1:58:02] I uh was working with in business
[1:58:06] working in some consulting helping some
[1:58:09] business people and they were starting a
[1:58:11] business and they they asked me to leave
[1:58:13] the job I was working at and come and
[1:58:15] work in their business and we were
[1:58:16] sitting down at a lunch table and and uh
[1:58:19] the brother said to me or the man said
[1:58:21] to me and I could tell he was kind of a
[1:58:23] charismatic Christian and he said "We
[1:58:26] want you to come work for us when we get
[1:58:28] this business up and running and I said
[1:58:30] 'Well I already have a job and they said
[1:58:32] 'Well we want you to leave that job and
[1:58:33] come work for us and and where they were
[1:58:36] wanting to run the business was
[1:58:37] different town than I was living in and
[1:58:39] I said 'Well I live over here in this
[1:58:40] town well they said well what's wrong
[1:58:42] with this town and and I was kind of
[1:58:44] avoiding the issue and I said well I've
[1:58:45] got commitments over here in this town
[1:58:47] and and they said well what kind of
[1:58:49] commitments and so finally I thought
[1:58:51] okay here we go i said well I pastor a
[1:58:53] church over here i said "This job is
[1:58:55] just a secondary job for me but I I'm a
[1:58:58] pastor of a church." And they the fellow
[1:59:01] said to me he says "Oh what do you
[1:59:04] believe?" I thought "What am I going to
[1:59:06] tell
[1:59:07] him how far are we going to go
[1:59:10] here?" I So I started with the simple
[1:59:12] part i said "Well we we believe the
[1:59:15] Bible." And he said "Well everybody
[1:59:17] believes the Bible what specifically do
[1:59:20] you believe?" And I said well I said '
[1:59:23] Have you ever heard of the name of
[1:59:24] William Brandham oh he says they make
[1:59:28] him God those were his exact words i
[1:59:32] said well I don't know who they are or
[1:59:34] what they do but I don't make him God i
[1:59:37] believe he was the fulfillment of
[1:59:38] Malachi 4 a prophet sent in the spirit
[1:59:41] of Elijah to turn our hearts back to the
[1:59:44] original word and I said that's I
[1:59:46] believe he fulfilled that scripture and
[1:59:49] uh he said and so we talked a little bit
[1:59:52] the other fellow was 7th Day Adventist
[1:59:53] he expressed his opinion and then the
[1:59:55] Seventh Day Adventist got up and left
[1:59:56] the table to get some more food from the
[1:59:58] buffet and the fellow that originally
[2:00:00] was talking with me and said that they
[2:00:02] make him God he said to me surprisingly
[2:00:05] said "I was in brother Brandham's
[2:00:08] meetings." I was shocked and I thought
[2:00:11] "Well I wonder what he saw." And he I
[2:00:13] didn't ask him but he just began to
[2:00:14] volunteer god has a way of doing things
[2:00:17] he says "I was in his meetings in
[2:00:19] Saskatchewan." He says "And when he
[2:00:22] stepped up to the pulpit," he said "It
[2:00:24] was like a wave of the Holy Spirit went
[2:00:26] out over the congregation."
[2:00:29] He says "People got up off their CS got
[2:00:32] out of their wheelchairs threw down
[2:00:34] their crutches." He said "And he hadn't
[2:00:36] even begin to speak yet."
[2:00:40] That was the vindication of God that
[2:00:43] walked with this generation the first
[2:00:46] generation ran into another fellow one
[2:00:48] time and he said he was in brother
[2:00:50] Brandham's meetings in a place called
[2:00:51] Grand Prairie which is where I was
[2:00:52] pastoring and uh he was an older fellow
[2:00:57] and uh we had done some advertising to
[2:01:00] to try and uh find out if there's any of
[2:01:03] the people left that were in the
[2:01:04] meetings that Brother Brandon was there
[2:01:06] and we offered free books and he replied
[2:01:09] and got some free books and we got in
[2:01:11] contact with him and wasn't a believer
[2:01:13] wasn't even baptized correctly never
[2:01:16] could get even get him to see true water
[2:01:18] baptism but unsolicited this was his
[2:01:21] testimony he says I was in William
[2:01:24] Brandham's meetings I think it was 1951
[2:01:27] or 53 in Grand Prairie Alberta and it's
[2:01:31] not recorded but there is there is
[2:01:34] actually uh advert adverisements that
[2:01:37] we've seen of the meetings in the local
[2:01:39] newspaper and uh he said I was suffering
[2:01:43] from heart
[2:01:44] trouble he says and William Brandham at
[2:01:47] the end of the service he says he called
[2:01:49] me out he says I was kind of scared but
[2:01:52] he says I looked up he says and when I
[2:01:54] looked up I saw the pillar of fire over
[2:01:58] his head
[2:02:00] you see God has a way of telling you
[2:02:03] these things are the truth when other
[2:02:06] people want to say they never happened
[2:02:08] but God raises up witnesses that are not
[2:02:11] even followers of this message
[2:02:14] to bear witness what God did in our day
[2:02:19] this message is supernaturally
[2:02:21] vindicated
[2:02:23] god had commanded Moses to lead the
[2:02:26] people to the promised land god
[2:02:28] commanded brother Brandham to do what he
[2:02:31] did amen let's go to the next
[2:02:34] one but he says "And this displeased God
[2:02:38] so much until he told Moses "Separate
[2:02:41] yourself from among them i'll just kill
[2:02:44] the whole bunch and start a new
[2:02:46] generation with you." See
[2:02:49] Moses I want you to catch this now moses
[2:02:52] was the love of God that was present and
[2:02:56] manifested here on the earth but the
[2:02:59] wrath of God was right there it so
[2:03:04] displeased God you know that God it's
[2:03:06] not just words that displease God we can
[2:03:09] make mistakes we can say things wrong
[2:03:11] but it was the attitude behind it you
[2:03:14] know God hates even the Bible talks
[2:03:16] about seven things that God hates that
[2:03:18] are abominations like a proud look a
[2:03:21] lying tongue heart that devises wicked
[2:03:25] imaginations a false witness that
[2:03:27] speaketh lie he that sweth discord
[2:03:29] amongst the brethren those are things
[2:03:31] that God hates it's not error alone that
[2:03:34] God hated it's the spirit behind the
[2:03:36] error we were all in error one day
[2:03:41] but God came by our way our God who is
[2:03:44] rich in mercy and and you could argue
[2:03:47] even looking back here and say you know
[2:03:49] there were innocent people that were
[2:03:51] caught up in it but God wasn't judging
[2:03:53] their actions he was judging the spirit
[2:03:55] that was behind it which spirit was
[2:03:58] already judged and reserved in chains of
[2:04:01] darkness and was trying to manifest
[2:04:03] itself on the earth amongst the
[2:04:05] believers all right now standing in the
[2:04:07] gap he goes on he says "Now today if God
[2:04:09] was going to liquidate the people he
[2:04:11] says brings it to today and there was a
[2:04:13] time when God had gotten tired of
[2:04:15] fooling with our sin we constantly going
[2:04:17] wrong who would stand like Moses today
[2:04:20] for the people where would we find a
[2:04:24] person that would stand or could stand
[2:04:27] that God would accept like he did
[2:04:30] Moses?"
[2:04:32] All right so if God would accept Moses
[2:04:36] what if Moses wasn't there if God would
[2:04:38] accept Brother Bram what if Brother
[2:04:41] Brandham isn't here where do we stand
[2:04:44] where is a person where is a people
[2:04:46] that's willing to stand in the gap give
[2:04:49] me the next one please moses own life on
[2:04:52] earth meant so much to God till it
[2:04:55] stayed the wrath of God and watch this
[2:04:57] next statement and God would not cross
[2:05:00] over Moses i want you to catch how God
[2:05:03] operates here because there was a time
[2:05:04] when God was angry with
[2:05:07] Israel but yet being angry with Israel
[2:05:10] in I think it's 1 Samuel or 2 Samuel
[2:05:12] chapter 24 God could not cross over
[2:05:16] David and so he inspired David or
[2:05:20] allowed the devil to inspire David to
[2:05:23] make a mistake and go and number the
[2:05:26] people if you actually read the
[2:05:28] scripture it wasn't David that God was
[2:05:29] angry with that caused the plague it was
[2:05:31] the children of Israel that God was
[2:05:33] angry with but he allowed the devil to
[2:05:35] trick David into going and numbering the
[2:05:37] people and thereby God could cross over
[2:05:40] David and bring a plague into Israel so
[2:05:44] you see there was a man in that day that
[2:05:46] God would not cross over but God would
[2:05:50] allow him to make a mistake to loose the
[2:05:52] wrath of God amongst the people all
[2:05:55] right I'm getting to a point here next
[2:05:58] one please there was all this always was
[2:06:01] a puzzle to me till one day in the
[2:06:02] revelation of the scripture there came
[2:06:04] this thought to me see Moses in act in
[2:06:08] every was every way
[2:06:10] substituting he was a type of Jesus
[2:06:15] Christ thank you see there there's no
[2:06:19] Moses attitude was not that he was elite
[2:06:22] but what that God was elite all right I
[2:06:25] know you're listening closely
[2:06:27] here there was a people that needed
[2:06:30] redemption just like he needed
[2:06:33] redemption moses knew his place now a as
[2:06:37] we read and I want you to take your
[2:06:39] Bibles still if you have them
[2:06:44] open in Numbers chapter 16
[2:06:47] here now what
[2:07:01] happens in verse we could go to verse uh
[2:07:06] 20 and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[2:07:08] Aaron saying "Separate yourselves from
[2:07:10] amongst his congregation that I may
[2:07:13] consume them in a moment." And they fell
[2:07:14] upon their faces and said "Oh God the
[2:07:16] God of spirits of all flesh shall one
[2:07:18] man sin and thou be wroth with all the
[2:07:20] congregation." And the Lord spake unto
[2:07:22] Moses saying "Speak unto the
[2:07:24] congregation get yourself up from the
[2:07:25] tabernacle of Kora Dayan and Abram." Now
[2:07:28] God is going to judge the
[2:07:30] leaders that led the
[2:07:33] rebellion and the earth opens up we know
[2:07:36] and the swallows them up so the leaders
[2:07:38] now of the rebellion become swallowed up
[2:07:41] but that's not the end of it i want you
[2:07:43] to jump down with me to verse
[2:07:45] 41 but on the
[2:07:47] tomorrow all the congregation of the
[2:07:50] children of Israel murmured against
[2:07:52] Moses and against Aaron saying "You have
[2:07:56] killed the people of the Lord." Oh my so
[2:08:00] God dealt with Dayan and Kora now the
[2:08:03] the people seeing the supernatural who
[2:08:06] did they blame it on moses and Aaron and
[2:08:09] they say it's your fault that Dayan and
[2:08:11] Corin Byram died so that now the spirit
[2:08:14] that was on the leaders never left but
[2:08:16] now begin to move into the people and
[2:08:18] begin to say oh you know it's Moses and
[2:08:20] Ara you know what a terrible age to be
[2:08:23] living in but what a tremendous age to
[2:08:25] be living in you know in the beginning
[2:08:28] as the rebellion rose up I can well
[2:08:30] imagine that there were some people that
[2:08:31] were saying what got into Dayan and Cora
[2:08:34] how could they do this how could they
[2:08:36] rebel against Moses they they it's a
[2:08:38] terrible thing they've done and there
[2:08:39] are other people that were saying "What
[2:08:41] got into Moses and what got into Aaron?"
[2:08:43] They used to be good leaders now they've
[2:08:45] fallen and and you know they've fallen
[2:08:47] from God's grace they had never fallen
[2:08:49] but the people's attitude become twisted
[2:08:52] by a demonic spirit
[2:08:54] all right and so now God says in in
[2:08:58] verse 42 he says "And it came to pass
[2:09:01] when the congregation was gathered
[2:09:02] against Moses and against Aaron that
[2:09:05] they looked towards the tabernacle of
[2:09:06] the congregation and behold the cloud
[2:09:08] covered it and the glory of the Lord
[2:09:10] appeared." And Moses and Aaron came
[2:09:12] before the tabernacle of the
[2:09:14] congregation and the Lord spake unto
[2:09:16] Moses "Get you up from among the
[2:09:18] congregation that I may consume them as
[2:09:20] in a moment." And they fell on their
[2:09:22] faces now watch what happens now
[2:09:26] and Moses said unto Aaron "Take a
[2:09:30] sensor put fire therein from off the
[2:09:33] altar," what the altar of incense and
[2:09:36] put on incense and go quickly unto the
[2:09:40] congregation and make an atonement for
[2:09:43] them for there is wrath gone out from
[2:09:46] the Lord the plague has begun
[2:09:51] all right now what's taking place here
[2:09:54] why couldn't Moses stand in the gap
[2:09:57] anymore moses couldn't stop the plague
[2:10:00] now the people had rebelled and God says
[2:10:02] "Step aside i'm going to consume all the
[2:10:04] people." But Moses says "There's still a
[2:10:07] man that can stand in the gap there's
[2:10:10] somebody that can take the sensor of
[2:10:12] prayer and can stand between God and his
[2:10:17] wrath." Who was this man was a man that
[2:10:19] had been positionally placed in the
[2:10:22] priesthood
[2:10:24] all right now I'm not reflecting that to
[2:10:26] five-fold ministry but I'm actually
[2:10:28] reflecting it to the bride of Jesus
[2:10:29] Christ because we have come to placing
[2:10:32] time we have come to an hour where God
[2:10:35] wants his people to take their position
[2:10:38] for they and they only have the ability
[2:10:41] to stand between the wrath of God and
[2:10:44] their loved ones
[2:10:47] amen so there was a plague that had
[2:10:49] already started but Moses said to Aaron
[2:10:51] "You've got the position to stand in the
[2:10:54] gap you have to do it you've got to take
[2:10:57] the sensor you've got to run with the
[2:10:59] sensor you've got to bring the incense
[2:11:01] you've got to offer up the prayers you
[2:11:04] got to get into position you got to take
[2:11:06] your place in the body of Jesus Christ
[2:11:08] you got to recognize who you are
[2:11:12] run and stand before the plague strikes
[2:11:14] your loved ones for it's already started
[2:11:18] i can say in this hour we can see it
[2:11:20] even within the ranks of the message
[2:11:21] it's already started
[2:11:23] but let there be a people raise up with
[2:11:25] prayer
[2:11:27] raise up with position
[2:11:29] raise up with revelation and understand
[2:11:32] their position in the body of Jesus
[2:11:35] Christ hallelujah
[2:11:38] there was a woman by the name of Esther
[2:11:41] my youngest daughter's name is Esther
[2:11:43] and death was be was about to ride out
[2:11:45] through the land
[2:11:47] the decree had been made all the Jews
[2:11:49] would be killed hmon had convinced the
[2:11:51] king to make the decree and h had
[2:11:53] deceived him into doing it and now now
[2:11:56] there was going to be all the Jews were
[2:11:57] slaughtered and Morai said took his his
[2:12:00] niece Esther sent a message to Esther
[2:12:02] and says "You must go into the king and
[2:12:05] you must convince him to reverse the
[2:12:07] decree
[2:12:08] you are the only one that stands between
[2:12:12] us and death
[2:12:14] you are the bride of the king and if you
[2:12:18] don't take your position don't think
[2:12:21] you're going to escape
[2:12:23] but rather God will raise somebody else
[2:12:26] up in your place to take that position
[2:12:29] because it is a position that must be
[2:12:32] filled
[2:12:34] and Esther sent back the message to the
[2:12:36] you can read the book of Esther when you
[2:12:37] go home or when you go back to your
[2:12:39] rooms and Esther sends back the message
[2:12:40] to Mori and says "But the law
[2:12:43] says that it that nobody can go into the
[2:12:47] presence of the king unless they're
[2:12:49] invited
[2:12:50] and if they go in not being invited
[2:12:54] they'll they're they'll be killed unless
[2:12:57] the king holds out the scepter." All
[2:12:59] right so now the scepter representing of
[2:13:02] course the righteousness of the king and
[2:13:03] and uh Esther but she said but you fast
[2:13:07] and pray for three days and get all the
[2:13:09] people to fast and pray for three days
[2:13:11] and I'll fast and pray for three days
[2:13:13] with my maids and then I will go in and
[2:13:15] then she says if I perish I perish you
[2:13:19] see no greater love has a man than this
[2:13:22] that he lay down his life for his
[2:13:24] friends
[2:13:26] and so here's Esther coming not yet
[2:13:29] realizing her position and this is what
[2:13:31] I I'm getting to tonight is that not
[2:13:33] fully realizing her position but
[2:13:35] realizing she's the one that's got to do
[2:13:38] something and so she goes into the king
[2:13:41] and the king holds out his scepter and
[2:13:44] and and uh and then she touches the end
[2:13:46] of a scepter is receiving his mercies
[2:13:48] and and so he he had called out who was
[2:13:51] in the court and everybody had tried to
[2:13:52] convince Esther don't go in there but
[2:13:54] she knew she had to do it she didn't
[2:13:56] know why she didn't know her position
[2:13:57] and and so she goes into the presence of
[2:14:00] the king and the king accepts it now I
[2:14:01] want you to catch this very closely the
[2:14:04] details of the conversation are not
[2:14:06] recorded in the
[2:14:07] Bible but they're actually recorded in
[2:14:09] the book of Josephus and so how that
[2:14:12] Josephus describes the meeting there
[2:14:14] between the king and Esther and he says
[2:14:18] the king said to
[2:14:20] Esther because he saw that she looked
[2:14:22] fearful and
[2:14:24] weak because she had been fasting
[2:14:26] remember for three days and she was
[2:14:30] scared for her life and he says why do
[2:14:33] you look so
[2:14:34] fearful and she said "Because the law
[2:14:37] says that nobody can come into the
[2:14:39] presence of the king unless they're
[2:14:41] invited."
[2:14:42] And the king's reply is that law applies
[2:14:46] to everybody except you
[2:14:52] now just a minute here that's God's word
[2:14:56] it's hidden in the scriptures it's
[2:14:57] hidden between the lines but it's a love
[2:14:59] letter to us that God is trying to
[2:15:02] convey something to his bride you don't
[2:15:05] have to wait to be invited to come into
[2:15:07] the king whatever the request is you can
[2:15:11] come into the presence of the king
[2:15:13] anytime you desire
[2:15:16] amen i no longer call you church i call
[2:15:19] you bride see there was three different
[2:15:21] types of women in in in that are
[2:15:23] mentioned in the book of Esther there's
[2:15:25] virgins concubines and the bride all
[2:15:27] right the virgins are the ones that have
[2:15:30] never had an experience with the king
[2:15:31] they've never come into the presence of
[2:15:33] the king they're being washed with with
[2:15:35] with uh uh perfumes and odors and and
[2:15:39] baths and uh cleanse you know that's the
[2:15:42] way it is when you're dealing with
[2:15:43] sinners you're trying to wash them in
[2:15:45] the water of the word you're trying to
[2:15:46] get them cleansed you're trying to
[2:15:47] accept the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[2:15:50] get them to receive what God's done for
[2:15:51] them and and they got to go through a
[2:15:53] sanctification process that's the
[2:15:55] virgins but once they come into the
[2:15:57] presence of the king then they have an
[2:16:00] experience with the king but if they're
[2:16:02] not the bride they go to the house of
[2:16:04] the concubines and in the house of the
[2:16:06] concubines is all the women that have
[2:16:08] been in the presence of the king but are
[2:16:10] not the bride all right now we can
[2:16:13] certainly type that in this hour and
[2:16:14] realize there's a lot of people that
[2:16:16] have had experience with God but they
[2:16:18] never say receive the love letter from
[2:16:20] the king that says "You're my bride."
[2:16:23] God sent his message just exactly for
[2:16:26] his bride not for the world only his
[2:16:29] bride can receive that amen but now what
[2:16:32] would it be sister if you got a love
[2:16:33] letter from your husband how many wives
[2:16:35] have we got in this place all right now
[2:16:37] what would it be if your husband was
[2:16:39] away and he sent you a love letter and
[2:16:40] you took that love
[2:16:42] letter and put it on the shelf
[2:16:45] i wonder if he loves
[2:16:47] me i I I wonder what he thinks about me
[2:16:51] i I know he's a far away right now but I
[2:16:54] wonder if he's thinking of me well he
[2:16:56] sent you a letter it's called the
[2:16:57] message of the hour amen
[2:17:00] he's in that letter he's telling you he
[2:17:01] loves you in that letter he's telling
[2:17:04] you how much you mean to him in that
[2:17:06] letter he's telling you he can't live
[2:17:07] without you in that letter and so the
[2:17:10] king there's the king with Esther now
[2:17:13] she comes into the presence of the king
[2:17:14] now she hadn't come in for 30 days
[2:17:16] because she had not been invited now now
[2:17:18] I hope you can catch this without me
[2:17:20] going into detail here but I want you to
[2:17:22] realize the concubines had to be invited
[2:17:26] but the queen did not have to be invited
[2:17:30] all right so now I want you to catch
[2:17:32] this now what she's actually doing is
[2:17:34] thinking of herself as a concubine
[2:17:38] instead of thinking of herself as the
[2:17:40] queen that she is
[2:17:43] that the beloved of her beloved yeah and
[2:17:46] so as a result she's not taking her
[2:17:49] position the way she ought to take her
[2:17:51] position she's fearful she's scared
[2:17:54] there's death in the land and she's the
[2:17:57] only one that can stop it hallelujah oh
[2:18:01] let me just bring it right down home
[2:18:03] there's death that wants to strike our
[2:18:05] families but you're called to stop it
[2:18:09] there's death that's that's trying to
[2:18:11] strike it might be a sickness it might
[2:18:12] be unbelief it might be all kinds of
[2:18:14] things happening broken relationships
[2:18:16] whatever more but God has equipped you
[2:18:19] as the bride of Jesus Christ to come
[2:18:21] into his presence at any time and say
[2:18:23] "Lord I have need of your grace."
[2:18:27] Lord I have need of your hand in in this
[2:18:30] hour
[2:18:32] hallelujah oh how how the king loved her
[2:18:37] she says uh he says "Well what's your
[2:18:40] request?"
[2:18:42] She says "Come to my house for a feast i
[2:18:45] invite you for a feast of wine." That's
[2:18:48] what we're doing tonight
[2:18:50] we're having a feast of wine what's wine
[2:18:52] stimulation of revelation
[2:18:54] praise the Lord lord come into our feast
[2:18:56] of wine tonight
[2:18:58] lord come down and make yourself known
[2:19:00] amongst us lord reveal yourself in our
[2:19:03] midst and so he comes down and he comes
[2:19:06] to King of Hazarus comes to Esther's
[2:19:08] house and Hmon is there and and you know
[2:19:10] anywhere there's church the devil goes
[2:19:12] to
[2:19:14] and so there you know there he's he's
[2:19:17] visiting her and he finally says okay
[2:19:18] Esther this isn't all for no reason
[2:19:20] what's your request oh and she gets up
[2:19:24] all of her boldness she says my request
[2:19:26] is that you come again tomorrow
[2:19:29] night praise the
[2:19:32] Lord Hallelujah
[2:19:34] You know sometimes we're fearful to ask

[2:19:49] can't preach about God without preaching
[2:19:51] about love
[2:19:53] my Bible says "God is love."

[2:20:39] says "You're a near kinsman." And he
[2:20:41] says "There's one nearer than I." She
[2:20:43] says "Yes but you're a near kinsman."
[2:20:45] And and she he gives her six measures of
[2:20:47] barley she goes home naomi says "Where'd
[2:20:49] you get those six measures of barley?" I
[2:20:51] got them from Boaz oh he says "Sit down

[2:20:56] until he finishes the work of redemption
[2:21:00] hallelujah god is not resting in this
[2:21:02] hour he's up and active cuz he's got a
[2:21:05] bride that's on his mind
[2:21:08] he's been waiting thousands of years for
[2:21:11] this time hallelujah amen brothers how
[2:21:14] many brothers ever traveled away from
[2:21:16] your wife all right first day you leave
[2:21:19] goodbye honey you know it's all nice and
[2:21:21] and you you just go on your way and
[2:21:23] maybe for work or whatever more it might
[2:21:24] be and you know you're around her so
[2:21:26] much but now you're away a little bit
[2:21:27] maybe it's a little bit novel you know
[2:21:30] and you you get a chance to read more
[2:21:32] than you used to read you're by yourself
[2:21:33] more the kids aren't going to bother you
[2:21:35] you know everything's all left behind
[2:21:36] and you're kind of off on your own next
[2:21:38] day goes by and you know it's kind of
[2:21:40] yeah this is all right third day goes by
[2:21:43] fourth I don't know how long it lasts
[2:21:44] everybody's different fifth day goes by
[2:21:46] sixth day goes by pretty soon it gets
[2:21:48] pretty tired
[2:21:50] and then it's like man I wish I was home
[2:21:55] man I can't wait to get back home
[2:21:58] i I was I was at the end of two weeks of
[2:22:02] long meetings brother Ben I was over in
[2:22:04] Africa and and uh it was before the time
[2:22:07] of cell phones and I was off in Africa
[2:22:09] and uh uh I had I preached about I don't
[2:22:13] know 14 15 times i don't remember what
[2:22:15] it was and it was I was at just about
[2:22:17] the last meeting and I was kind of
[2:22:18] feeling sorry for myself as preachers
[2:22:21] are apt to do about every time they
[2:22:24] preach and uh and so it was after
[2:22:28] another service and uh so I think I had
[2:22:31] one service left and I was kind of
[2:22:32] feeling bad about myself and all of that
[2:22:35] and I I was just crying out to the Lord
[2:22:36] Lord I'm sorry i just I'm sorry for
[2:22:39] feeling bad i I just miss my wife and I
[2:22:42] miss the family and you know I sure wish
[2:22:44] I my wife was here and you know it'd be
[2:22:46] so much easier if she was here and I was
[2:22:47] just kind of whining and complaining
[2:22:50] before the Lord i don't think that's
[2:22:53] scriptural
[2:22:56] and the Lord spoke to my heart because I
[2:22:59] said you know I've been waiting two
[2:23:00] weeks to see my wife they spoke to my
[2:23:03] heart says but I've been waiting 6,000
[2:23:05] years
[2:23:10] i thought "Oh God
[2:23:13] forgive me here I am can't hardly stand
[2:23:17] two weeks and the Lord's been thinking
[2:23:20] about you for 6,000 years amen lord's
[2:23:23] been thinking about this age for 6,000
[2:23:25] years there'll come an age that it won't
[2:23:27] be going to the marriage it will be
[2:23:30] marriage time it will be bride time
[2:23:35] hallelujah just like Esther and Ahazarus
[2:23:38] ahazarus realized uh you know that that
[2:23:42] was the most the greatest thing that was
[2:23:44] on his mind i couldn't help but think
[2:23:45] what a Hazarus was thinking for 30 days
[2:23:47] while she was thinking she had to wait
[2:23:49] to be invited
[2:23:51] i didn't know I was going to speak about
[2:23:53] marriage tonight but you ever get that
[2:23:55] way brothers and sisters where you feel
[2:23:57] like I'm waiting for him to make a move
[2:24:00] but I'm waiting for her to make a move
[2:24:02] but I'm waiting for him to make a move
[2:24:05] 30 days goes by nobody's made a move i'm
[2:24:09] not talking about you know the natural
[2:24:11] way of life i'm just talking about
[2:24:13] moving in affection towards one another
[2:24:16] you know brother Brandham said that that
[2:24:19] our marriage and the scripture says our
[2:24:21] marriage is a type of the heavenly the
[2:24:24] invisible union between the heavenly
[2:24:25] bridegroom and the earthly bride you
[2:24:28] know I'll I'll say it this way and I
[2:24:30] hope it doesn't apply to anybody here
[2:24:31] but if it does you you take it as an
[2:24:33] encouragement for you that I believe if
[2:24:36] our earthly marriages are not fulfilling
[2:24:40] then I sincerely doubt that the
[2:24:42] invisible union is really fulfilling
[2:24:44] like it ought to be
[2:24:47] if what we have between us and God is
[2:24:49] not reflected between us and our wife
[2:24:52] then we've missed something somewhere
[2:24:56] all right got a little quiet on that one
[2:24:58] i think I'll face this
[2:24:59] direction praise the Lord talk to the
[2:25:02] screen
[2:25:06] esther said "If I perish I
[2:25:11] perish." See death was moving through
[2:25:13] the land and Esther had to take her
[2:25:16] position death was in the ranks of Naomi
[2:25:20] and Ruth but Ruth had to take her
[2:25:22] position
[2:25:24] death was in Israel but Aaron had to
[2:25:26] take his position death is riding
[2:25:30] through the land now but the bride must
[2:25:33] take her position
[2:25:39] the word is life and anything that is
[2:25:43] against the revelation of God's word is
[2:25:46] death
[2:25:48] it's not just false doctrine but that
[2:25:51] which seeks to undermine the channel of
[2:25:53] God's revelation are you still with me
[2:25:57] oh my we got to bring this to a close
[2:26:00] i'm sorry i didn't realize it was so
[2:26:01] late
[2:26:07] praise the Lord we got lots of meetings
[2:26:09] so we'll we'll try and I I found a way
[2:26:11] in now I got to find a way out all right
[2:26:18] you know there are so many things that
[2:26:20] to to come against God but there's only
[2:26:23] one people that can stand for God
[2:26:28] we've come to the bride age
[2:26:31] we've come to the time you see God's a
[2:26:33] bride age is not just a title to
[2:26:36] describe an era no it's a description of
[2:26:39] a relationship that God has moved into
[2:26:42] with his church this is now bride time
[2:26:46] this is now maturity time this is now
[2:26:49] the time of the greatest joy that there
[2:26:50] ever was but death is riding through the
[2:26:53] land if there ever was a time to be
[2:26:55] heavenly minded it's this age because
[2:26:58] the eagle rises above the things of this
[2:27:00] age the rat race that we call the world
[2:27:03] conspires to keep us bound in this world
[2:27:07] to keep us tied down like it tried to
[2:27:09] keep Esther tied down like it tried to
[2:27:11] keep Aaron tied down all of that you've
[2:27:13] got to take your position that let me
[2:27:16] just say this now there are many things
[2:27:19] that we could
[2:27:20] call hell on earth let give me just a
[2:27:24] few minutes to talk about this and then
[2:27:25] we'll close all right i'm here and I'm
[2:27:28] not going to deal with this again in
[2:27:29] another service is this all right
[2:27:35] the Bible
[2:27:37] says about an adulterous
[2:27:39] woman her house is the way to
[2:27:43] hell going down to the chambers of
[2:27:47] death there's never been an age Brother
[2:27:51] says one of the great plagues of the
[2:27:53] last days would be the immorality of
[2:27:56] women
[2:27:59] i'm sure that doesn't surprise you
[2:28:02] everywhere you see it you don't have to
[2:28:05] go uh you don't have to go anywhere
[2:28:08] really wherever you look praise the Lord
[2:28:10] not in this room but wherever you look
[2:28:13] whether it be walking down the street
[2:28:15] whether it be uh going to work amen
[2:28:18] brothers wherever it might be you know
[2:28:21] you've got to guard yourself against the
[2:28:23] immorality because it's death that's
[2:28:26] presenting itself in the way of an
[2:28:28] adulterous woman
[2:28:31] all right he says "But he knoweth,"
[2:28:34] talking about a man that going into her
[2:28:36] says "He knoweth that the dead are there
[2:28:39] and that her guests are in the depths of
[2:28:41] hell." You see it's not we could talk
[2:28:45] about
[2:28:46] pornography and as soon as I say that
[2:28:49] every brother in this place knows
[2:28:50] exactly what I'm talking about but it's
[2:28:53] not
[2:28:54] pornography it's
[2:28:56] lust the Bible doesn't name pornography
[2:28:59] it names lust all right and is it an
[2:29:03] addiction they they have a term now
[2:29:05] called sex addition addiction sex
[2:29:07] addiction i can't even say it right and
[2:29:10] and so they've got this term to describe
[2:29:12] it it is an addiction because anything
[2:29:15] that is a demon possession is an
[2:29:17] addiction
[2:29:19] cigarettes is an addiction because it's
[2:29:21] a demon amen drugs is an addiction
[2:29:24] because it's a demon lust can be an
[2:29:27] addiction because it's a demon and I'm
[2:29:29] not talking about normal relations
[2:29:31] between a man and a woman but we've
[2:29:33] reached an age where the un where people
[2:29:35] have an
[2:29:36] unsatiable sexual appetite and now I
[2:29:39] said that to say this brothers it's hell
[2:29:42] on earth
[2:29:45] it's not something to be desired young
[2:29:47] men run away from it
[2:29:50] flee youthful lust the scripture says
[2:29:53] it's not some oh it's enticing to the
[2:29:56] eyes yeah sure it is but you're looking
[2:29:58] into the pit of hell brother Brandham
[2:29:59] said Hollywood is the pit of hell and
[2:30:02] Hollywood presents itself as something
[2:30:04] attractive or this exciting movie or
[2:30:06] that great thing that's happening or
[2:30:08] whatever more but you're actually
[2:30:09] peering into the pit of hell and the
[2:30:12] devil's desiring to grab a hold of you
[2:30:14] and pull you into there amen we know
[2:30:17] first Peter chapter 3 speaks about
[2:30:20] Christ suffering and going to pre and
[2:30:23] preaching to spirits in prison which
[2:30:26] sometimes were disobedient when the
[2:30:28] longsuffering of God waited in the days
[2:30:30] of Noah while the ark was preparing you
[2:30:33] know we often think about this age has
[2:30:34] gone on a long time but Noah worked on
[2:30:37] the ark for 120 years preaching the same
[2:30:40] message preacher of righteousness
[2:30:42] there's only one way there's only one
[2:30:44] message you get into the ark or you're
[2:30:46] lost you get into Jesus Christ or you're
[2:30:49] lost jesus Christ is always the word
[2:30:53] revealed for his day and you get into
[2:30:56] the word revealed for your day or it's
[2:30:58] lost oh brother Tim I heard that before
[2:31:00] if you'd have been in Moses in Noah's
[2:31:02] day you'd have heard it for 120 years oh
[2:31:05] I heard him preach before oh there he
[2:31:06] goes again going off on that ark as
[2:31:08] being as though he's the only one that
[2:31:10] hears from God that's right he was the
[2:31:13] only one that heard from God he was the
[2:31:15] only one that had the message of escape
[2:31:17] and God has sent a message of escape in
[2:31:20] this hour because hell is upon the earth
[2:31:23] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[2:31:26] shall it be in the revealing of the son
[2:31:29] of man brother Brandham talks about his
[2:31:32] own self and the things that he saw on
[2:31:33] the earth when or things that he saw as
[2:31:36] he descended into hell as as a child
[2:31:38] just 14 years old as he was dying his
[2:31:41] blood was pumping out of his body and
[2:31:43] his life was escaping from his body and
[2:31:45] he went down into hell he says I heard
[2:31:47] things and I saw things that were so
[2:31:49] hideous he says it would make a burning
[2:31:51] hell a pleasure compared to that
[2:31:54] whatever you do he says don't go there
[2:31:57] now let me let me just I'm saying it
[2:31:59] this way for a reason because he in 19 I
[2:32:01] think it is 63 or 64 he says I was
[2:32:04] sitting in JC Penney he says "And all of
[2:32:07] a sudden my mind goes back to when I was
[2:32:09] 14 years old and saw those things in
[2:32:12] hell and recognized they're now on the
[2:32:14] earth
[2:32:16] they're now right around it's no wonder
[2:32:18] people are taking anxiety medication
[2:32:20] it's no wonder their minds are going
[2:32:22] crazy because the whole age is
[2:32:25] descending into hell
[2:32:27] but I'll go back to my original thought
[2:32:29] though he cast me into hell I will still
[2:32:33] love him."
[2:32:35] Amen
[2:32:42] hell or the regions of the lost is a
[2:32:43] place where people are locked away from
[2:32:45] the presence of God brother Aram said
[2:32:47] there was no mother there no father
[2:32:48] there no God there now listen that
[2:32:52] doesn't mean there aren't mothers that
[2:32:53] go there or fathers that go there he's
[2:32:55] saying there's no relationship there
[2:32:57] there's no love there there's no
[2:32:59] connection there nobody means anything
[2:33:01] to anybody else that's why the woman
[2:33:03] that wouldn't repent in church when God
[2:33:05] dealt with her used those words she says
[2:33:07] "I could see my mother's soul fry in
[2:33:10] hell and laugh at it." Why because when
[2:33:13] you go into that region there's no
[2:33:15] mother there's no father there's nobody
[2:33:17] that means anything to you you're just
[2:33:19] entirely separated from God but let me
[2:33:21] tell you here tonight if you've got just
[2:33:23] a twinge of a twinge that says "I want
[2:33:26] God," it's because God is dealing with
[2:33:28] you amen amen the Holy Spirit is moving
[2:33:32] upon your life desiring you to do what
[2:33:34] brother Tim what do I got to do just
[2:33:35] surrender yourself just yield yourself
[2:33:38] to God and say "God I hear you calling
[2:33:40] me Lord forgive me of my sins lord I
[2:33:43] want to give my life to you i want to
[2:33:45] surrender it to you Lord i don't want to
[2:33:47] go the way of hell i don't want to be
[2:33:49] swallowed up in this regions of the lost
[2:33:51] that is all around us i don't want to be
[2:33:53] swallowed up in this video stuff anymore
[2:33:55] these video gangs and this internet and
[2:33:57] these computer things that held me
[2:33:59] captive i want to be set free tonight
[2:34:02] amen he's a deliverer tonight he was a
[2:34:05] deliverer in Noah's day he sent a
[2:34:07] message to deliver the people he was the
[2:34:09] one that Abraham followed when he came
[2:34:11] down and destroyed Moses or destroyed
[2:34:14] Sodom rather and he delivered Lot and
[2:34:16] his family out of the city of Sodom but
[2:34:19] his wife was too much in bondage she He
[2:34:21] said "Don't look at those things don't
[2:34:23] look back." But she had to look back to
[2:34:26] what her former desires were and she
[2:34:28] turned to a pillar of salt she was
[2:34:30] eternally lost why but God sent a
[2:34:32] deliverer to deliver her with a message
[2:34:35] get out of this city he was the one that
[2:34:37] spoke to Moses to deliver the children
[2:34:39] of Israel out of Egypt he's the one that
[2:34:42] was in the camp in the wilderness that
[2:34:44] the children of Israel were led by he's
[2:34:46] the one that was with David he's the one
[2:34:48] that took away all sin from them that
[2:34:51] believed he is our righteousness he is
[2:34:54] our peace he is our joy he is our
[2:34:57] salvation he is our everything he's our
[2:35:00] mother he's our father he's our sister
[2:35:02] he's our brother he's a love that is
[2:35:05] greater than any power the world knows
[2:35:07] he's a peace that passes all
[2:35:09] understanding he's the one that comes
[2:35:11] into the one that is welcoming him
[2:35:13] because he stands at the door and knock
[2:35:15] and if anyone will open to me I will
[2:35:17] come in and s with him i will make
[2:35:20] myself known to him oh somebody said
[2:35:22] "Well I don't understand God i don't
[2:35:24] understand the message i don't know how
[2:35:26] it fits together Brother Tim." That
[2:35:27] doesn't mean anything he's the one
[2:35:29] that's here tonight that's able to open
[2:35:32] our understanding to someone that'll say
[2:35:34] "Lord open my understanding tonight lord
[2:35:37] let me see things the way you see things
[2:35:39] i'm here at the camp." You know you
[2:35:41] might be a young person that was forced
[2:35:43] to be here because your family's here
[2:35:46] maybe you're distracted on a lot of
[2:35:47] other things but God knew you would be
[2:35:50] here
[2:35:53] he came by your way this weekend
[2:35:56] said "I want to meet with you cuz I've
[2:35:58] got something for you
[2:36:01] and I'll give you something that's more
[2:36:04] satisfying than anything that's out
[2:36:06] there in the world."
[2:36:07] Amen you see it's not a matter of I got
[2:36:10] to get rid of this i got to get rid of
[2:36:11] this no you just get Christ
[2:36:14] say "Oh brother Tim how I can't give
[2:36:18] this up." No don't worry about giving
[2:36:19] that out just receive Christ as Christ
[2:36:22] comes in the world goes out you got some
[2:36:25] more of the world you get more of Christ
[2:36:26] and more of the world leaves get more of
[2:36:29] Christ more of the world leaves amen
[2:36:31] listen when I first came into the
[2:36:32] message of the hour I just begin to feed
[2:36:34] upon the word and feed upon the word and
[2:36:36] feed upon the word and as I begin to
[2:36:38] feed upon the word after a few months
[2:36:40] all of a sudden I look back and go
[2:36:41] "Where'd all the things of the world
[2:36:43] go?"
[2:36:45] What happened to the music I I I used to
[2:36:47] listen to what happened to the unclean
[2:36:48] things I used to look at what happened
[2:36:50] to to the problems that I had in my life
[2:36:52] my all of a sudden they weren't there
[2:36:54] anymore why because Christ had come in
[2:36:57] and when Christ comes in the world goes
[2:36:59] out amen i I got a law that I call the
[2:37:02] law of worldliness listen you can't the
[2:37:04] the Bible says that the world is enmity
[2:37:07] to God all right you can't love the
[2:37:09] things of the world and love God too all
[2:37:12] right so you got God at one end of the
[2:37:14] spectrum and you got the world at the
[2:37:15] other end of the spectrum and it's just
[2:37:17] a law the closer you get to God the
[2:37:20] further away you get from the world
[2:37:23] but it's also a law the closer you get
[2:37:25] to the world the further away you get
[2:37:28] from God that's right make sure we we
[2:37:30] tune up our lives tonight and be headed
[2:37:33] in the right direction lord I'm here to
[2:37:36] get closer to you
[2:37:39] there's an anointing in this hour that
[2:37:42] is sent to combat death in hell amen
[2:37:46] there was a spirit that wrote the word
[2:37:49] hallelujah i never thought about it till
[2:37:51] just studying this afternoon it was a
[2:37:54] prophecy about Jesus Christ but a lot of
[2:37:57] prophecies have a double meaning and I
[2:37:59] think this prophecy has a meaning for us
[2:38:01] as well and the prophecy is for thou
[2:38:04] will not leave my soul in hell
[2:38:08] thou will not suffer thy holy one to see
[2:38:10] corruption
[2:38:12] for this corruption must put on
[2:38:14] incorruption
[2:38:16] this mortal must put on immortality
[2:38:18] oh Lord you won't leave my soul in hell
[2:38:22] there's coming a body change there's
[2:38:24] coming a reality of the word that's in
[2:38:26] me one day when the last member comes in
[2:38:28] and the bride recognizes who she is
[2:38:31] there's going to be a quickening take
[2:38:32] place in my life and all that I believe
[2:38:34] will come a living reality and all of a
[2:38:37] sudden this old body will be turned
[2:38:39] young again hallelujah it's not that I'm
[2:38:43] worried about getting old listen saints
[2:38:44] if I died tomorrow I'd be the happiest
[2:38:46] man that's right listen to live is
[2:38:49] Christ to die is gain
[2:38:51] don't feel sorry for me if I cross over
[2:38:53] on the other side i feel sorry for
[2:38:56] yourselves well you might not feel sorry
[2:38:57] for yourselves but you know but
[2:38:59] nevertheless in all of that you know I'm
[2:39:01] not worried about crossing over on the
[2:39:03] other side that's where I want to go
[2:39:05] that's where I want to be that's what I
[2:39:06] want to partake of that's what my
[2:39:08] thoughts are i was traveling with a
[2:39:11] young man to some men's meeting he asked
[2:39:13] me he said "Brother Tim the body change
[2:39:15] must mean more to you than it does to me
[2:39:19] [Laughter]
[2:39:23] praise the Lord brother you're about to
[2:39:25] get an education
[2:39:30] i said "Buddy let me tell you something
[2:39:35] it's not that I'm sick or tired or old
[2:39:38] but the reason I'm looking forward to a
[2:39:40] body change is because I've experienced
[2:39:42] a lot of things in my life and I know
[2:39:46] that is does not fully satisfy the deep
[2:39:50] calling in here
[2:39:52] when I was young I just wanted to get my
[2:39:55] driver's license i thought if I just get
[2:39:57] my driver's license that'll satisfy me
[2:40:00] come to find out it didn't satisfy me
[2:40:03] i just wanted to get graduated and get a
[2:40:05] job and make some money and I got
[2:40:08] graduated and I got a job and I made
[2:40:10] some money and I found out that didn't
[2:40:12] satisfy me i thought you know maybe I'll
[2:40:15] just find the right woman and I found
[2:40:16] the wonder most wonderful woman and and
[2:40:18] and there uh I was united to her in holy
[2:40:22] matrimony and we had a wonderful
[2:40:24] relationship for 30 years until the Lord
[2:40:26] took her home but yet in the midst of
[2:40:28] all that I'll say that wasn't a full
[2:40:30] satisfaction of the deep calling that
[2:40:32] laid within many times as sisters you
[2:40:35] say "If I could just get married and
[2:40:37] have some children and have a family and
[2:40:38] a home and a car and whatever more like
[2:40:40] that," and pretty soon the sisters that
[2:40:42] are amongst us that got married and had
[2:40:44] children and raising children and have a
[2:40:46] home and have a car and all that goes
[2:40:48] with that you pretty real pretty soon
[2:40:49] realize that didn't really answer
[2:40:51] everything within us why because we're
[2:40:54] the seed gene attributes of God we were
[2:40:58] predestinated to be in the image of God
[2:41:01] and there's a tabernacle called this
[2:41:03] corruptible body that's stopping us from
[2:41:06] being everything that we are meant to be
[2:41:10] but one moment in a twinkling of an eye
[2:41:13] one of these days that's all going to
[2:41:15] change
[2:41:17] hallelujah then the eternities are going
[2:41:20] to break open and we're going to be able
[2:41:22] to trans transfere the the different
[2:41:25] spheres and transverse them and all
[2:41:27] travel throughout this realm and another
[2:41:29] realm and on into heaven and back into
[2:41:31] this realm and all those kind of things
[2:41:33] that we're going to be able to be like
[2:41:35] we were meant to be
[2:41:38] amen why because this mortal must put on
[2:41:40] immortality
[2:41:42] thou will not need my soul in hell
[2:41:45] neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to
[2:41:48] see corruption hallelujah
[2:41:50] david says "I will praise thee oh Lord
[2:41:52] my God with all my heart i will glorify
[2:41:54] thy name forever more for great is thy
[2:41:57] mercy toward me and thou hast delivered
[2:42:00] my soul from the lowest hell."
[2:42:04] Hallelujah hallelujah
[2:42:13] don't you think the woman at the well
[2:42:14] was living in a hell
[2:42:17] on earth her life was hell
[2:42:22] all right let's just be sober for a
[2:42:24] moment and come to a
[2:42:27] close a lot of
[2:42:30] times we go through events in our life
[2:42:33] and it seems like we are in hell on
[2:42:37] earth
[2:42:41] seems like there's no way out the
[2:42:44] circumstances have encompassed us
[2:42:47] and we just have to
[2:42:50] endure but God never puts us through
[2:42:53] anything that doesn't have a purpose
[2:42:58] and I can say that tonight and maybe if
[2:43:01] the Lord wills in the days ahead I'll
[2:43:03] share a thing or two that you
[2:43:05] know everything is for a purpose and God
[2:43:09] chastises with a loving hand all right
[2:43:13] but here was this woman that was
[2:43:16] living with a sixth
[2:43:19] man as Jesus said you've had five
[2:43:22] husbands and the one you're living with
[2:43:24] now is not your
[2:43:25] husband brother that's hell on
[2:43:28] earth some women have one husband and
[2:43:31] it's hell on earth
[2:43:33] i'm not talking about any sisters here
[2:43:36] but I'm talking about you know here this
[2:43:39] woman went from one to the other to the
[2:43:43] other to the other to the other what was
[2:43:46] she looking for just a little heaven on
[2:43:49] earth
[2:43:50] just a relationship that worked
[2:43:53] somebody that loved her somebody that
[2:43:56] cared for her that's all she wanted but
[2:43:59] but her lot seemed to be just hell on
[2:44:01] earth to top that off the denominations
[2:44:03] looked down at her and then and said
[2:44:06] "You know there's no hope for you
[2:44:08] there's nothing we can do for you you
[2:44:10] you've done messed up your life so bad
[2:44:12] that you're I'll I'll share some
[2:44:14] testimonies maybe tomorrow uh from the
[2:44:16] message of the hour but you you've
[2:44:18] messed up your life so bad there there's
[2:44:20] nothing we can do for you don't even
[2:44:22] come to church like like you you've so
[2:44:25] far
[2:44:26] gone really we haven't got nothing for
[2:44:28] you."
[2:44:30] And so along comes a man
[2:44:33] along comes the love of God expressed on
[2:44:37] the earth
[2:44:39] is there a man that can stand in the gap
[2:44:41] for this woman
[2:44:43] oh there's a man that can tell this
[2:44:45] woman listen there's you she said you
[2:44:47] know we know when the Messiah comes we
[2:44:49] know there's coming a message we know
[2:44:51] there's coming a last days we know
[2:44:53] there's coming a listen i I I the hour
[2:44:56] cometh and now
[2:44:58] is that they that worship the father
[2:45:00] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[2:45:03] she she says "I perceive you're a
[2:45:05] prophet." And you know I've got it all
[2:45:07] backwards and mixed up I realize but he
[2:45:09] he says he says she says "I perceive
[2:45:11] you're a prophet." We know when the
[2:45:13] Messiah comes he'll be a prophet and he
[2:45:15] says "I am he that speaks to you."
[2:45:19] Amen now what happened here's a woman
[2:45:23] that everybody had written off and said
[2:45:26] there's no hope for
[2:45:27] her and all of a sudden the Bible says
[2:45:30] she dropped her water pot hallelujah she
[2:45:32] says "I don't need this old life
[2:45:34] anymore."
[2:45:36] This kind of things don't bother me no
[2:45:37] more this this labor of life doesn't
[2:45:39] bother me anymore she ran into the city
[2:45:42] and got the attention of the entire city
[2:45:44] and said "Come see a man who told me all
[2:45:47] things is not this the very Messiah?" I
[2:45:50] could say "Is not this the message of
[2:45:51] the hour is not this the me the
[2:45:54] messenger that was sent to forrun the
[2:45:56] second coming of Christ is not he the
[2:45:58] one that was sent to bring God's grace
[2:46:00] to this generation and show them it
[2:46:02] doesn't matter how far gone the world
[2:46:05] thinks you are if my word comes by your
[2:46:08] way that's all you have need of."
[2:46:12] Hallelujah
[2:46:13] that's everything we have need of
[2:46:15] tonight
[2:46:16] he's the deliverer that's on the scene
[2:46:18] tonight
[2:46:20] brother Brandham talked about his own
[2:46:22] prison and he said "Oh he said he talked
[2:46:25] about losing his wife and losing his
[2:46:27] daughter." And he says "Oh dear God I'm
[2:46:30] sorry that I did what I did you took my
[2:46:34] wife my darling from me now you're
[2:46:35] taking my baby oh God please don't take
[2:46:37] my little girl i love her with all my
[2:46:39] heart i'll serve you i've done all I
[2:46:42] know to do except go when you told me to
[2:46:45] go down there i said "Please don't take
[2:46:48] my baby." I said "I love
[2:46:51] her take me instead of her," he
[2:46:55] says then he says "Oh God I don't know
[2:46:57] why you're tearing me up like
[2:47:00] this." Said "Lord I I I don't I don't
[2:47:03] know i've done all that I can
[2:47:06] do it's not my will now let thy will be
[2:47:11] done and he says I laid my hand on her
[2:47:16] head he says the angels of God come
[2:47:18] picked her up carried her
[2:47:23] away he
[2:47:26] says God let me go with them
[2:47:29] then don't let me stay here any longer i
[2:47:33] don't want to
[2:47:34] stay listen what he says now
[2:47:37] but God in my heart there's
[2:47:40] something that I love you
[2:47:44] no matter what you've
[2:47:46] done I love you
[2:47:50] they said I lifted my hands to
[2:47:53] him how is it that a man could come to
[2:47:56] such a level of surrender of love to the
[2:48:00] Lord Jesus Christ job said "Though he
[2:48:03] slay me yet I will trust him." Amen
[2:48:08] but I will maintain my own ways before
[2:48:11] him brother Adam Ram said "If he should
[2:48:13] cast me into hell I will still love
[2:48:17] him." Finally in the message Hidden Life
[2:48:19] he says "Have you come into the
[2:48:26] place?" He says "Have you ever come to
[2:48:29] the place in your life where Christ
[2:48:31] meant more to you than all the arguing
[2:48:33] you could do about your
[2:48:35] church has Christ meant more to you than
[2:48:38] all the
[2:48:40] world why don't you just bow your heads
[2:48:42] while I read this i want you to listen
[2:48:44] to it and I want you to think of
[2:48:46] yourself as the musicians
[2:48:51] come he says "I don't mean from an
[2:48:53] emotion or a mental workup
[2:48:56] i mean from the depths of your
[2:48:59] heart that something's settled in there
[2:49:03] that something's taken place and you
[2:49:06] don't know how it come but you're hid
[2:49:08] away and your whole motive is to serve
[2:49:11] Jesus Christ have you entered into that
[2:49:13] place my dear brother have you come into
[2:49:16] that place where you don't care what
[2:49:19] anyone
[2:49:20] says not to go out and act smart but
[2:49:24] till the love of God is so anchored in
[2:49:27] you that you can't see nothing else your
[2:49:32] whole motive is to do the will of
[2:49:34] God love for everybody flowing free from
[2:49:41] everywhere he says "What a place to
[2:49:44] live." That's the hidden place
[2:49:48] that's the place where we got to come to
[2:49:51] my brethren
[2:49:53] that's the place where God reveals his
[2:49:56] secret
[2:49:58] things that's the place where God does
[2:50:02] the placing and the
[2:50:05] calling as our heads are bowed you know
[2:50:09] that chorus there is none like you no
[2:50:11] one else can touch my heart like you do
[2:50:13] you just play that softly for
[2:50:15] me while our heads are bowed and our
[2:50:18] eyes are
[2:50:21] closed I preached longer than I expected
[2:50:24] to tonight it's the first service we're
[2:50:26] tired we're
[2:50:28] weary but let's not end the service and
[2:50:31] just go out of here and just say "Well
[2:50:32] that was a nice thought that was a nice
[2:50:35] scripture some nice quotes put
[2:50:39] together." Let's approach it right now
[2:50:42] and say "Lord where do I stand?"
[2:50:45] Have we come to that secret place that
[2:50:47] hidden place to where it doesn't matter
[2:50:50] what anybody says we'll love him
[2:50:53] anyway doesn't matter what happens in
[2:50:55] our life we love God
[2:50:57] anyhow it doesn't matter what trial we
[2:51:00] are in the midst of we can still say
[2:51:03] Lord not my will but thy will be done
[2:51:08] maybe you're here tonight and you want
[2:51:09] to say
[2:51:11] "Lord in your presence tonight as I feel
[2:51:14] your presence so
[2:51:16] near I just want to surrender myself
[2:51:18] aresh to you Lord." Maybe you'd like to
[2:51:21] surrender yourself for the first time
[2:51:23] before God and we don't really have a
[2:51:25] lot of altar space or anything but why
[2:51:28] don't you just do it in your seat why
[2:51:29] don't you just stand to your feet and
[2:51:31] say "Lord I'm standing in a surrender
[2:51:33] tonight i'm standing with my arms raised
[2:51:36] i want you to come Lord Jesus and come
[2:51:38] and take complete control of my life and
[2:51:41] let your word have the preeminence in my

[2:52:18] conscious decision

[2:52:23] to you." And the God who sees your heart
[2:52:27] will come down and accept your sacrifice
