Israel be glad her and Joyce with all the heart o daughter of Jerusalem the LORD hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of Israel even the Lord is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see evil anymore and that day it shall be said to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion let not thy hands be slack the LORD thy God and the midst of thee is mighty I mean I like that the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty he will say he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing Amen let's go to second Corinthians chapter 4 and quite a familiar piece of scripture I trust so I see Corinthians four and we'll read 616 to 218 drive this thing okay let me over vet you okay anyway so C is here from sin Corinthians for 16 to 18 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us not against us for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus how thankful we are we can be gathered one more time together as a people Lord and we can sing songs of Zion Lord to give you praise and honor and glory Lord with such Thanksgiving in our hearts that you've made a way for us Lord that you Lord that Satan had us bound but you set us free our own way and we're on our way to heaven shouting victory Lord it's we thank you it's more than a song it's a reality Lord we are living out that song and we thank you Father that and we just ask as we have opened the pages of your word and we've read some scripture lord I just pray you would come and anoint your word one more time father an anoints pker in here Oh Lord anoint your word to our souls father Lord that it

safe Lord bring them safely back home father we just want to commit them into your hands Lord and if there's any sick among us Lord may you touch them father and heal them look because we know by your stripes we were healed it's a finished work and we thank you for that father in Jesus Christ's name ayyy just come and take the service under your divine control we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I mean God bless you all you may you may have your seats this morning amen I want to I trust everyone had a blessed camp I mean it was a tremendous time I'm there thankfull what the Lord did for us they're bringing us all together healing wounds you know our God always goes well beyond our expectation amen and just to you know see the Lord come down and do everything he did was tremendous I mean some very thankful for that but uh but now we know we're in another week I mean we've got another battle to face you know we've had a time of refreshing and the wonderful thing is we don't just look through the rearview mirror and say well he did wonderful things back then he's still the same today he's still the present God today you know he's not a god of history Amen but he's the I am so we're thankful that we are not just looking in the rearview mirror because as we read there and Zephaniah sees the Lord that is in the midst of thee is mighty Amen and that is that makes the difference worth with people as of God as in them it's that changes everything he's the important one we've come to see today he's the important one that we worship we don't worship one another and then we don't we're not interested in anything like that we're we're here to worship God and it's just like Israel when they when they journeyed from from Egypt unto thee into the promised land and Moab you know Israel was journeying through the land of Moab and Moab was you know they were even though they were related to Israel because Moab came out of lots daughters you know but they they were jealous of Israel they didn't like them they treated them as an enemy and they knew they could not fight them with a natural army because other armies had been defeated so they went and got the the Prophet Balaam to try and curse curse Israel but we know that he could not curse them but you know as as as the attempts three attempts were made for for Balaam to to try and curse Israel you know the king of Moab you know took took Balaam around so it says the hind of parts of Israel you know to the not so good-looking parts of the congregation that because he thought surely that because a prophet your God anoints a prophet and God speaks through that prophet that surely if if their prophets or the bad parts of the congregation then that would justify the Prophet cursing Israel but then when when God anoints that prophet he says I see no iniquity and Jacob Amen they were offering burnt sacrifices for their sentence you know they they they were you know they had sin in the camp they'd all different kinds of things going on because they had to sacrifice all the time to cover up their you know yo that blood to cover up their sins but when God looked down at us at your ad as people as says I see no iniquity in them and this is the God that sees all things I mean in the difference was because the shot of the king was in the camp that that was the important thing you know Moab you know Balaam sacrificed the same way Moses did they had the same ol ters they had the same sacrifices they had the same approach to God but the difference is that God was in the midst of Israel amen and that's why that's why we should be so thankful I mean that God you know God walks among us not just a one time event every day every service God comes down God speaks to us God draws us higher God refreshes us God casts out the enemy God breaks complexes God brings healing Goblin's restoration I mean we should be thanked appreciate him thank you Lord use don't come one time and then we're looking in the rearview mirror a member you but you're present among us all the time Amen so now I want to speak a bit about you know when God comes to people someone else could be right next to them but the person that God comes through the hole their whole world changes and the eternal comes down into this realm and and gets ahold of someone you know when heaven opens there's the reason no it's one or maybe go a little bit you know we know that in Eden heaven was upon the earth there was no gulf between Adam and Eve and God everything was perfect there was no separation there was no distance there was no sin but then when sin came into the when yo when sin came into the earth amen creation fell and then they came a gulf between God and man and so now heaven was now a distance from man right and then it's season you know it's season Genesis chapter 5 that the line that came from Adam and Eve it said then man began to call upon the name of the Lord because they were looking they were calling upon him God when are you going to restore the fellowship I mean eat and when are you going to restore it when are you going to bridge this chasm that what Adam and Eve told yo will tell us the testimony when you'd come down in the cool of the evening and you'd have fellowship with them and there was no there's no heartache there was no sin there's no remorse there's no regret there was no anything bad and it was just perfect it was just perfect union between between you and your children and they called upon God because they're saying God when are you going to restore this when are you going to bridge this chasm when is Heaven going to come down again when is heaven going to open up amen and give an answer to since since problem and we know ultimately Amen that that that that Amazing Grace was manifested in Jesus Christ hallelujah where where the answer to sin was shown and the man Jesus Christ and the and the chasm was golfed hallelujah the bridge was Christ amen where heaven opened amen enter people who once separated from God became reconciled and we can see this also in the in the time of Moses where where Israel was down in Egypt and they were slaves for about 400 years and they but they had a promise god gave their therefore bear abraham a promise that they would sojourn in a strange land for hundred years but but i would bring them out with a mighty hand and bring them back into this land and so they came a time where there was 400 years had had had we you know was coming to a time and they begin to call upon God those those ones who were really had a burden they they received they received I don't know if the you know we know Moses wrote the Bible but we don't know if it was actually written down before then so they maybe just received an oral tradition and maybe they were there in their slave Hut's and they begin to speak about the promise that God gave Abraham and something anchored into some of them amen this promise is true it's more than just a nice story but it's going to happen and we know Moses's parents by faith they had they had Moses sing he was a proper child something happened when he was born they knew he was the deliverer I mean they saw they received a direct answer Amen from the prophesy that this baby that they just you know we're holding this was the one that God was going to use to deliver Israel amen out of Egypt and take them into the Promised Land now when many baby boys were born before that time but this was different it's a heaven open an answer came from heaven this is the fulfillment of prophecy and Dara would have been a lot of deliveries you know our babies as I just said and everyone would have been special but this was different he was prophecy now became flesh are you following me amen and then you can come and then you go all the way down through even when Moses is there and God comes down on Mount Sinai and God's dealing with the people and they saw mighty signs and wonders his Joshua standing there Korah Dathan are standing there different ones are standing there and for one something happened to him and caleb was standing there and and when they received when Moses was standing there preaching the preaching the law that he received on the mountain and telling the people that God has delivered you out of the out of the slave masters hand because you're going into a promised land a meant for a couple a quickened to the assaults and they became alive saying this is my promise I mean I'm going to inherit this promise because God has given me this promise I mean they said let's go possess a land at once but others heard the same words and they said well we're not able to take the land Amen because their confidence was in their own self we are grasshoppers in their sight that's that was their testimonies we are grasshoppers on the side of the people that live in the land we cannot do it it wasn't their job to do I mean God said I give you the land you just go fight for it you say well what does that mean they have to do it no God will fight the battle you just got to go and step to the battle for you follow me it's not a contradiction they had to go fight the battle but who was ultimately fighting the battle for them I mean you're gonna put your you know you're gonna pick up your sword I mean you'd pick up your sword you're gonna pick up your shield of faith put on the whole armor of God you can't leave it in the cupboard someplace you know I read a saying one place never trust a knight in shining armor because he's never used it never trust a knight in shining armor he's never he'd never been in battle I mean where's the where's the marks on a shield where he's right yo you know defeated some blows yo or maybe on this helmet or a breastplate if it's perfect it's never been used and well how can you trust someone who's never been in battle Alleluia that's why when we when we when we go to heaven friends I trust we're gonna have some battered shields some battered helmets hallelujah a sword maybe with a few you know knocks in it where it's been pairing some your blows from the enemy you know we're gonna have some rugged equipment but it's seen us through hallelujah amen so now a tankard into Caleb and Joshua is hot and they could see now they could see the lamb belongs to them now you say well this is just a this is just a heads up quite a thing no it's not a haphazard kind of thing because we read in we read in seeking Corinthians that can we can we go back to that maybe could I do it now I can't do it down okay I'll just leave this look now eternal things while we look not at the things which you seen but the things which are not seen for the things that are seen a temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now this world I'm just going to God's Word is eternal God's Word is eternal everything else will change so we have to change how we look at things that only the eternal things are real this this world is pass away amen even if even if you could say just say this is actually not true it is true well so I sort of put this out to you even if this is not true and there's not a rapture and there's not a Great Tribulation in the Bible sense there is a world war three coming you you just look at the natural way of things are it's going to be a nuclear war one superpower is going to go down and another superpower is going to rise the world order is going to change and it is changing so this world is changing right whether we like it or not it is changing because it's just a temporal thing this world is changing but God's Word is eternal so now we have to look at what does god what does god's would be cleared because that is the only real thing actually you say well but I'm in this body I see you I hear your voice you know I know the seat oh man I'm very conscious of where I am but all those things will change all those things will change they are not real because there'll come a time where this is no more this building won't be here this pulpit won't be here we won't be here in this form because it's changed it's gone and and and if time would continue to go on we wouldn't even be a footnote in history because the world has changed but God's Word is eternal and it's only the eternal that matters and Caleb and Joshua when they were standing there hearing God's eternal word came out of their prophet they read they they I believe received a revelation that is true that is real this world is passing there once slaves but they weren't in that condition anymore the world changed that was temporal their slavery was temporal their slavery is temporal amen but the promise of God to them was eternal amen so now we should look at the things that are not seen we live a very supernatural life the Bride of Christ I'm talking about you that believer lives a supernatural life we don't live a natural life amen we live in a supernatural world even the unbeliever they live in a supernatural world but they're just not conscious of it amen that that the unseen is affecting the seen I mean behind everything people do there's a spirit that's motivating them it's not their own idea yes I'll do this and older the snow and influence comes and you got to really think when you look at something and you say I really like that that can be a harmless thing just like there's and you know and you just take something like you know how like interior yo you know de chord changes now and you say I like that now I'm just using a harmless example that's what do you think about it and then you think well where did the inspiration come that that affected that person that now they like this and now I like it and there's nothing wrong with it you know trends change right but there's an influence that came from somewhere that affected somebody and now that influence is being transferred to me right and it's the same thing with with the things of the Lord there's an influence that came from somewhere that influenced somebody and now the influence is being channeled through that person to me and you look at now and then you gotta trace back the steps now where did this influence come from right you got to look at where it came from because if it came from heaven and will produce heavens results which is the Word of God amen but if it came from the pit if it came from man's ideas amen all the all denomination is in the Bible you take it back it's the Tower of Babylon it's confusion well these people say this and these people say this and these people think this and these people back up their idea with hundreds of years of tradition and and and scholarship and and these people well not so much but they have a more broader overview well which one is correct which one is the right one you won't find it there because it's man's ideas and man's thinking and it's now well this is how it should be no but you got to trace it back now where did that cover its just confusion but when God comes and he declares his word he strip wretch it comes behind it to say this is me speaking this is me doing this this is not this man doing this or these people this is me the the God that's in the midst of thee is my tea Ella lujah he's my tea so you got to look at now where's this influence coming from where's the semblance coming from and it's not taking you to a tradition it's not taking you just to a nice Church culture it's taking you to Almighty God they meant the eternal is affecting this this natural world hallelujah God is here I just maybe say well you've heard this all before we we have to recognize now time is running out an eternity and time of blending together we've come a time when time is running out and the kernel is blending with this world a mint why do you think now this is all over the world you look at churches fifty years ago 40 years ago fighting hard god still moved a little bit but then now we're in a different season there's a refreshing being poured out this is this is not just these four walls this is all over the world God is the season is changing the season is changing where now God is moving in a far greater way than he did in the past you know the same God that we hear on tape is the same God that's here I mean they're very same God that same Lord Jesus Christ that anointed the prophet of God is anointed as people today I meant that the son of man was revealed in one man but now he's revealed in a multi-member body I mean that same God that a nod to the Prophet he said I'd love to go back to those days I'd rather be now I mean because there's a people that have come together and they've taken their position in the body of Christ that now God can manifest through a people and their because that's what God wants to show that he can take people with their own will this is God's victory I want you think about it God Oh God God takes people with their own will and their own ambitions and their thoughts and their plans and and they God moves upon their hearts and they give their will over to him and then God takes that person that surrendered their will they become a love president of Jesus Christ and God places him in a body and then he brings you know you know one part of the body of Christ then he takes another person the same thing happens to there may be different testimony but the end result is the same and God places them here and God takes another person and he places them here like one's a deacon maybe one's a song leader ones you know you know ones in the sunday-school once you see creating an atmosphere in the pew and a prayer warrior I mean once helping with the children once playing a insert ones maybe saying god bless you were so happy to see you I mean we are and it's all different gifts everyone is gifted everyone has a gift everyone has a part to play you all have a part to play in the body and then God takes you a place you in the body and then God now is now manifesting himself not just through one but through many and they all walked work together as one amen that's a miracle we everyone has their own ambition their own personality their own what they think and they just give it over and God play see of uncomplimentary and it's like we're a bunch of ants or bees just just working as one one mind one heart one accord hallelujah that's a glorious thing and God is showing see Satan this is what my victory produces I don't have to trick them into anything I don't deceive them into serving me I mean but they willingly give give themselves over and they love me [Music] Alleluia amen the eternal things are real we can go to we can go to people like Isaiah which is Isaiah chapter six he says when the in the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord High and lifted up in the temple maybe we could have been standing there in the temple with Isaiah but something was going on with Isaiah I mean he had the visitation he saw the Lord High and lifted up that changed his life I mean when the eternal when heaven opened spoke to a man and he was so gripped by what he saw is a voice saying who go for us he says here I am Lord send me his whole life was changed amen he came down to a point at the end of his life that he was putting a log and soreness under all because of that visitation it so gripped them because the eternal he realized only the eternal things are real yeah brother Bram went past the curtain of time he saw the redeemed ones and he said I could never be the same person after that visitation and I happen to believe he went there amen if he could stand there and tell people what's wrong with them and their address you know God would show him different things and it never failed once and I happen to believe you we'd be on the curtain of time and he wanted us to know that there's a land beyond the river that it's more real than this world I mean because this life is but a vapor but that is eternal I mean we just in a little space of time time is just such a actually a short thing not just talking about our 70 years were allotted and maybe more maybe less you know but you just take time the seven thousand years and whatever times been going on for creation you know from Genesis and whatever more you know it doesn't matter it could have been billions of years but it's still short compared to eternity it's just a little space of time and God allowed Center coming that creation would drop at a time and then now here we are in the space of time and God is molding us I'm thankful you know I was thinking about I was I was in part or mall and I was thinking what if everyone was a believer and on one hand you think this would be glorious but I sing on the other hand we wouldn't have any character we wouldn't be molded into his image amen there'd be no sickness hardship sorrow pain you you know you know you and have days where you wonder where am I going what's going on in this situation you wouldn't have any of those days you say well I would like to not have any of those days but in those times God is molding and he's shaping you and your characters being being developed and you're becoming more like him amen because he wants to reveal himself this this and the message which are one to me it's an expression of one person Jesus Christ I mean this is this is see this Bible man tries to read it like a textbook but it's no it's a person being revealed it's it's Jesus Christ Almighty God making himself known and so now if he's got a part of himself and he wants to you know he wants us to know that he is he is our guide he is our comforter he is our victory well how is he our victory because he won the victory for us he's our healer he's our Redeemer he's the lover of our souls he's our husband I mean he understands our burdens that's why he became a man amen he was tempted in all points like like we attend to but yet without sin so anything that man may be tempted with by the world he was tempted in the same way amen he understands what you go through you know next year I'm well actually this year I always get it mixed up there I'm gonna be 33 Jesus was my age I've been thinking about recently he was my age he was the Messiah he was my age upon the earth and you know he understands what it's like to be my age anyway I'm glad he understands us don't you now the eternal things are real now can we go back sorry can we just go to the next now this is right after what we just read eternal things we look to the unseen we should be looking to the unseen for we see that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked now we'll go the next one soon now when he talks about a house sorry can you go back our brother Armand he talks about a house he's not talking about four walls and three bedrooms and a kitchen and dining room whatever he's talking about a body the house he's talking about as a body amen he's saying we have though this one be dissolved I have one in the heavens already so he's just been talking about that the eternal things we look to the unseen we look to the eternal realm and because the things that have seen a temporal so he's going from this now he's saying now but though this temporal body be I'm just living a bit though this be dissolved we have one eternal in the heavens amen waiting already that's why we should look to the unseen we should be now in a way you think we should be bulletproof what do you think the Apostle Paul he could say I've been shipwrecked I've been beaten I've been robbed I've been score you know I've been put in prison all these things but then here after this big list he sees but none of these things move me none of these things move me and the reason he said no those things move him is because he knew he had a body in heaven amen that it wasn't maybe on its way it was already there and though this would stop beating and he was in in life would leave this he had a place to go to hallelujah and so his whole life now was changed that when he had the experience on the road to Damascus heaven opened heaven opened to him hallelujah where once he just learned about God and he was a great scholar and a learn the scripture but then heaven opened and the author of the one that you you're the author of the word that he thought he knew became real to him and then so he so fixed his course I'm glad I'm glad he didn't have a flowery beard of ease I mean that he could live a life where God would say I'm going to take a redeemed son and I'm going to show you amen what happened what happens when someone becomes a love prisoner he he speaks many times Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and he wasn't talking about just being in a dungeon he says I become a prisoner I've surrendered my will and I've been taken captive hallelujah amen aren't you glad amen he became a love prisoner so wherever God would lead him he says I'll follow and none of these none of these temporal things a beating is temporal oh just this just dwell on this one for a little bit we know bad things happened to us and maybe just say heat yo he was beaten or whatever maybe maybe there are no scars after that but then and espírita could still go back to that time right so the so the natural wounding can be gone but then it be a spiritual wounding but you've got to look at those things and saying that's temporal that's a temporal thing it's not an eternal thing are you following me I meant we can have bad experiences and they can sit with us for years and decades but you've got to take that thing and say that's temporal don't let it move you as he told Timothy a man he said stir up the gift that's within thee stir up that gift of faith Amen I hope we're not falling asleep amen you know stir up that gift of faith don't look at the natural don't look at the temporal things don't look at what's going on stir up that gift of faith because the same God that called Paul called Timothy hallelujah and so Timothy knew the same God pulled it and we can come down to our age and God raised up another love prisoner he showed in a prophets life this is what Calvary does I mean this is a real-life prisoner and then and then many things affected him but none of them moved him Alleluia and God was showing in that life this is how we should be none of these things friends we have a we have a our footsteps have been ordered from from now till the body change they have been ordered God knows your next step you may not know where you're going to go you may be have a lot of questions but he knows your next year he knows where you're going to go he knows the situation that you're gonna you know face he knows the battle you may be entering into even now he knows it and you've got to keep this confidence this is temporal this is passing away amen the eternal things are real amen eternal things are real this is not real this is not really reality you say well that's a big thing to say no this will pass away now we know people the reason the Apostle Paul said oh wait let's go I will read that soon when when God came down in Moses and spoke to the children of Israel and Caleb and Joshua said let's go take the land they the reason God came down there was to show them their place in the scripture their place in the scripture was they're going to possess the promised land that was their promise God came and showed them their position in the scripture right and you can take the same thing with the Apostle Paul he said that I'm a light to the Gentiles he knew has preserved he knew what he was job to do he said a dispensation of the gospel has been committed to me he knew who he was in the scripture Jesus that knew who he was in the scripture right and so now God has to come to us because before God comes to you and shows you who you are and here you can maybe guess at it you can maybe think this belongs to me but then when he comes and makes it real to you a lot of a lot of people heard Isaiah's prophecy a virgin shall conceive and a lot of fathers maybe said that's going to be my my young you know you know my girl is going to be that one but then for 800 years about that promise was sitting there and then the angel Gabriel came to Mary heaven opened if I heaven open God yo you know a messenger was sent for the principle mighty God I've come to tell you Mary you're going to have the promised son amen you are the vision that shall conceive and she said well how's this going to be the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and make this prophecy become a reality and she just says let it be unto me according to thy word and so she began to find out this is your position in the scripture amen this is your position in the scripture and so weak God comes down when God comes down to you didn't brother Brennan he's worrying about his life he's running way he's a certain way and then an angel comes to the presence of Almighty God he says I've come to from the principle my regard to tell you about your peculiar birth and to expand clarity this is why you're this way do you think do you think he ever thought when he was there you know living living in America do you think Eve imagine I'm gonna go pray for Kings I'm gonna you know he's already pastoring the tabernacle before he was called to the international realm do you think even mentioned I'm going to God is going to take take me and it's going to be a healing revival going to sweep the world and this message is going to introduce Jesus Christ do you think you would I don't know but possibly not because it's far greater you know God has a lot greater things when you look at when when God looks at you and he says you're my bride you're virtuous sinless never do it when I thought of you never did it in that first place amen I made you in my image amen when there's a people that are on streets of gold and it's and it says about in Revelations 19 the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready amen that's gone from a prophecy that's now a reality amen and God has to end but then you'd imagine you know I don't know well I wasn't a Christian really I never thought about spiritual things before God got ahold of me but you know I don't know about you being raised in church would you ever think I'm going to be fully in his image I'm going to conquer say yo Jesus is hit his death on Calvary will cause me to conquer Satan amen because Satan was defeated that day he'll be defeated in my life because he worries done and I'm going to take a rapture I don't know if you thought about it but then God comes down to you in this hour through this message and he's telling you now Amen I'm come to give you clarity about your misunderstood life that you would understand truly what you mean to be amen this is what this message is called to do not only did God come to the Prophet and tell him this is this is the reason you're this way amen but then he also through this message tells you hey what has everyone following me what I'm saying I'm getting some looks like where are you going with this you know before God became real to me I all my thinking was in temporal things I'm from this country this is my natural family this is the career I want to do this is maybe where I want to live this is what I'd like to go do in life that's all temporal things isn't it I think God cut and then that's kind of man's thinking this is what this knows about this much but then there's his whole eternal realm and then God comes down to he came to me and he began to tell me no that's just temporal this is not your in destination amen your eternal right your eternal so now now he opens he opens your eyes of understanding that you begin to think I'm not just not just natural things but they even come to realize now now you come to realize I'm going to hear them there's a rapture for me he's going to make me he's going to make me in as image I have an eternal body waiting for me though this earthly won't be dissolved is one waiting for me already hallelujah amen and then you're so so your whole your whole life changes because you look at the worlds very differently Alleluia now let's go to sorry can we put that back up for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this week groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked now for the next one for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon so this is why we're burdened because they want to go see him right we want to go see him but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit wherefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight we have a body the reason the reason this now this message was to call you that your life would be aligned up with that body the reason that God has called you you say well why am i Christian well I went to this meeting or I heard this tape or this person witness to me and then I in a chain of events comes along and then you find yourself maybe getting baptized and your life has changed and you know and then if we just look at it naturally you say well it's just an order of events I say it's beyond that as God is calling there's a body there for you and the reason that there is a deep there's a call I mean there's a response is a giving of your life over it's because there's a body in heaven Alleluia that now you have to align with that body amen and then many times brother brown speaks about it he says he says that God you have a you have a something that you need in your spiritual diet I mean that that you would become spiritually growing amen and then he'll put something on the ministers you know hardened mind to preach because you needed it just like this you know just like when we eat natural food we need a balanced diet we can't just live on McDonald's Amen some people who you know I heard of people at university where they just bought potatoes and rice because it's cheap and they got scurvy you know that's not a balanced diet but their bodies would be calling for other things just like we know you know you know when a mother's pregnant and she goes has all these different cravings it's not because she's calling for it but because there's a life that's calling for that for maybe a vitamin or a mineral that's in that food Alleluia and it's the same thing with us we may have something we ever have a burden or a need or something and God will anoint the most of the preacher certain thing that's because there's a as part of your diet he says you need to eat this I mean I was thinking after Kemp where can we go from here I say just feed your experience listen to this message I mean listen to the word absorbent absorbent read it listen to it don't put it on the shelf God is not rapturing a bunch of messes books and Bibles they will stay here they will stay here he's not rapturing then he's rapturing those that that word becomes manifested in that's the only people he's looking for as where this word comes out of here and is manifested in here that's the ones he's rapturing and so so if I was you I'd say Lord I want to know what you've said and I want to see it loose right amen it's not just in here man hide the word in my heart Lord thank you by your Holy Ghost and anchored in my soul hallelujah that's what God is looking for so feed your experience listen till you say well I may not understand a whole bunch do you understand how your body absorbs natural food do you know how your intestine works do you really know how your pank you know how had the blood pick you know how your body really works very few wood the whole the whole body in detail but you still eat you don't get caught up and well well I need this and then this will make this and then there's a citric acid cycle where where the body breaks down carbohydrates everything's makes amino acids makes fence make sugars but you know we don't know all about that I'm not going to ever give you a science lesson feel like I remember half of it oh yeah HS studying thing I used to know how cystic vibrant fibrosis on a chemical level worked I can't remember it anymore but we're talking about food anyway you know you don't know how it all works but yet you eat it well yet that steak or you eat something you said all this is so wonderful you don't get caught up and how it works in the body you're just enjoying the food and it's the same thing with the word of God just eat the word eat that word I meant listen to it read it amen edible begin to change you you see John John in the book of Revelation he goes from one moment he's weeping before the throne because there's no man found worthy to take the book and then an Elvis is weep not because the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed then our Lord Jesus steps out takes that book loses the seals amen and then the scene changes and then their mighty angel Christ Himself comes down onto the earth with that open book and one time he was weeping but then this next time he says you have to eat this book you have to become one with this word and now after he eats the book he's commanded thou must prophesy again for every nation kindred tongue and people and we know that that John in the book of Revelation represents a whole body of people right a whole body of people so once they Jesus weeping then he just eats it and then he and then he's given a new commission because of what he has absorbed right and it's the same thing with you and I just take the word feed your experience because there has to be every generation has a living witness every generation I mean we're not commanded I just put it this way the life that's in this word has to be in you and so this Bible because manifested in you and you become a living witness and it's the same thing with this message because this is the message in the Bible to me are the same thing right yes it has to be lived right we are the final voice to the final age you understand it has to be a living thing not just put on shelves and push play once in a while which we should do but it has to live amen and if you listen to it then you'll begin to understand your position in the scripture why do you think brother bran would make statements like if the bride of the church or if the bride only knew what she is she will one day then the rapture will go when she knows that she is the Word made flesh amen you know I'm just going to talk to you a little bit this says in Hebrews that the works of God will finish from the foundation of the world season Hebrews three and four the works were finished and so the Bible and everything is done and the people so when God gives a prophecy so it was the prophecy as I said about my you know given to Abraham your seed will sojourn in a strange land for hundred years then I'll bring them out with the mighty hand within that prophecy was Moses within that prophecy was Caleb and Joshua within that prophecy was the generation that rose up that wing with Caleb and Joshua into the Promised Land within that prophecy was Aaron amen within that prophecy was was was Phineas and and all the different ones they were in that prophecy but they but their names all of them weren't weren't told to Moe seeing God's might when he told that to Moses all of them were contained in that word right and then when they begin to see their part in the scripture that gave them confidence they knew who they were right because they were part of the prophecy many times you know we can easily say well this world as the Word of God made manifest because he created everything by his spoken word and we say Amen but then now here we are and we got to understand we - the manifestation of his word right because of God said I'm going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle when he declared that in his mind you were in that prophecy when I said about revelations 19 the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready well in that prophecy you were in their prophecy I trust you can see yourself when God when God showed that to John he was showing you - John I meant just like when a virgin shall conceive God you Mary was the virgin the voice of one crying in the wilderness God knew there was John John the Baptist amen you know just like a light to the Gentiles God knew that was Paul and so now we have to see ourselves so they were part of that they weren't they weren't just someone that was tacked into the prophecy to make it work they were the manifestation of that prophecy you understand me and so the same thing with the Bride of Christ on this day there you've got to be able to see yourself you are the manifestation of the prophecy this hour amen we are the we are the Bible the prophecy in the Bible become flesh right this is who we are and now the reason the reason that God does this is because he wants to know you he wants you to know your place in the scripture that is not you going well up one day down one day good bad just temporal things affecting you but you gripped by eternal things or rather eternal things have gripped you I mean that you can walk you walk with confidence just like Paul did just like the believers all down that they had confidence we know who we are and it doesn't make you arrogant if you really knew you know if God really reveals you what he's done it doesn't make you an arrogant person odd to think he would go to Calvary for me amen you just think about that he purchased my Redemption you know who caused the wounds who caused the wounds well you'd say well it was the Romans they scourged him no he didn't they didn't cause I was pilot or it was you know it was the scribes and Pharisees they caused the wounding no they didn't cause the wounding let's go to Isaiah 53 I just want you to been thinking about this maybe I this should have been um this just let's just think about this I've been pondering this this week a little bit now felt about this big and then I'm going to close with this this is why I say if this becomes real you say if this becomes real to you you won't be proud if a revelation of the Bible does not make a person proud a revelation makes someone meek humble and yielded and like Jesus Christ a revelation produces the character of Christ and you Moses Moses went from being on the being raised in Pharaoh's Pharaoh's house could have been the next Pharaoh and they they viewed the Pharaohs in Egypt were gods he went from that he went to the burning bush he went to Mount Sinai he became the meekest man in all the earth because because of those experiences that produced that character of Christ in him the scribes and Pharisees learnt the same word they become proud arrogant people so revelation will produce the character of Christ in you I mean that's why people say Oh hallelujah I've received the message well would you see the character of Christ in you because that's what it will produce now you say well who I don't have this on the PowerPoint let's go to verse 5 I say who caused the wounds but he was wounded this is I know everyone knows the scripture but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed so who caused the wounding I caused the wounding he was bruised for he was wounded for my transgressions so my transgressions caused him to be wounded amen he was bruised for my iniquities caused him to be bruised right I caused it I caused the woods it wasn't it wasn't the Romans or the Jewish people with their religion that rejected their Messiah it was my work it was my iniquity it was my transgressions of course says wounding now if you just think about that for a little bit it wouldn't make you a proud person wouldn't make you an arrogant all I'm a believer I'm the bride earlier it doesn't make you and you just think we we were heard the Bible says we were God's enemies we were his enemies and yet he died for his enemies amen and people can do things against us you know think about this people can come against us and do different things but we were his enemy we cost his wounding and how did he respond to the wounding I mean how did he respond to to what was going on he said I'll take it for you amen are you thinking about that we have some musicians I don't want to yeah but why wouldn't you think about it I caused the wounding when he was on why was he put now to a cross because of me helllooo you aren't you glad that we were his enemy but he came and died for his enemy that's amazing love amen but only eternal things are real we're gonna see ourselves through what does God we we are the bright around the world as a prophecy made benefits they mean and now you've got to go say you gotta say I am the prophecy of the Bible made manifest amen this is this is what I am because of His grace when he saw a bride without spot or wrinkle he saw me isn't that incredible I mean when he is on the cross I was on his mind a malicious stand this morning I mean this sing amazing grace shall we [Music] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound [Music] [Applause] [Music] but [Music] please I [Music]
