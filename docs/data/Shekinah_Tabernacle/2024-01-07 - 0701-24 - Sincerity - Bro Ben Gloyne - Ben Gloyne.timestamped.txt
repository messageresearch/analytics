[34:31] let us keep the feast not with old
[34:33] leaven neither with the leav of malice
[34:35] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[34:38] bread of sincerity and Truth amen and
[34:42] then we go to Hebrews 11 verse 6 you
[34:44] don't need to turn if you don't want to
[34:45] I can just read it here but but without
[34:48] faith it's impossible to please him he
[34:51] that cometh to God must believe that he
[34:53] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[34:55] that diligently seek Him amen Let's uh

[35:39] Your Great Wings this morning we thank
[35:41] you for this privilege to gather
[35:43] together Lord we love you and we thank
[35:44] you have your way Lord in Jesus Christ's
[35:46] name amen amen God bless you friends you
[35:49] may have your seats this morning so I
[35:51] want to talk about sincerity this
[35:53] morning I know I've you know you know in
[35:55] the past year we talking talking about
[35:57] selfishness and different things but I
[35:58] want to go into sincerity because we
[36:00] need to be I believe this is the hour
[36:02] where we need to be more sincere than
[36:04] ever you walking with the Lord in this
[36:06] in this world of indifference and
[36:08] lukewarmness I'm so thankful we can we
[36:10] can have a real Godly sincerity am me so
[36:14] so the Apostle Paul was was instructing
[36:16] the Corinthians that you know you got to
[36:18] purge out the old leaven you got to you
[36:20] can't continue walking as you have been
[36:22] walking but there's got to be a purging
[36:24] go on now we know Liv we we we talk
[36:27] about it is yeast it's the same thing
[36:29] but you know yeast or leaven has a has
[36:32] the ability of changing a dough into a
[36:34] completely different structure it will
[36:36] spread from one part of the dough it'll
[36:38] go all the way through the dough and
[36:39] then by the time the leaven has gone
[36:41] through the dough and raised it it's
[36:43] actually a different composition
[36:45] chemical composition to when it began
[36:47] that's right and that's the way with
[36:48] living in our life we can start off with
[36:50] a little thought maybe a little deed
[36:51] maybe a little action and it will
[36:53] eventually spread all the way Liv is sin
[36:55] right that's what I'm talking about sin
[36:57] can spread all the way through our life
[36:58] to change our all of our thinking our
[37:00] Outlook our nature everything can be
[37:02] changed because of sin but we're called
[37:05] to purge out the old Liv we're called to
[37:08] purge out amen sin and we know sin
[37:10] ultimately is unbelief and I'm so
[37:12] thankful we have the power of the blood
[37:14] this morning that we can be purged that
[37:16] this is not just a human Reformation or
[37:17] turning a new Leaf of a new year but God
[37:19] can change us because we know we serve a
[37:22] transforming God God is the one who does
[37:24] the changing he says you know Pur out
[37:27] the old leav so so this old leaven is
[37:29] your old ways your old nature it's got
[37:30] to be purged out even your old religious
[37:33] ideas are got to be purged out anything
[37:34] contrary to the word has got to be
[37:36] burned in the fire you know we can't we
[37:38] can't hold on to our old ways we got to
[37:40] get rid of it just like the you know the
[37:41] children of Israel when they left Egypt
[37:43] under the under the anointing of God led
[37:45] by the pillar of fire you know they
[37:47] still had a slave mentality and they
[37:49] said we cannot take the lands that slave
[37:51] mentality of unbelief stopped them
[37:53] entering into the promises of God
[37:55] entering into their promise so you know
[37:57] they they needed a purging of that
[37:59] nature and God that's why God delivered
[38:01] them with a mighty hand to show them you
[38:03] don't have to live with that slave
[38:04] mentality you don't have to live under
[38:06] that unbelief no more I I have brought
[38:08] you out with a mighty hand you did not
[38:09] deliver yourself I have delivered you to
[38:12] walk with me Amen to enter into the
[38:14] promised land and that's what God has
[38:15] done with us today we need to realize
[38:17] that God has done a mighty work and he's
[38:19] not finished working he's not finished
[38:21] changing lives amen he is still the same
[38:24] yesterday today and forever and if we
[38:25] just settle back and just have church
[38:27] and go through the motions I say we have
[38:29] completely missed the Mark I mean but if
[38:31] we push the prize of the High Calling we
[38:32] really push and we say Lord I want more
[38:34] of you in my life you've done many
[38:36] things but I want more I want to see you
[38:38] live again I want to see you come and do
[38:40] the supernatural Change My Heart Lord I
[38:42] want my heart to be soft towards you
[38:44] that your word can affect me and change
[38:46] me amen I trust that's everyone's desire
[38:48] this morning we want God's word to
[38:50] change us amen we don't want to just
[38:51] fill our heads with ideas but we want
[38:53] our hearts to be changed amen yes sir so
[38:57] he says to purge out the old leav the
[38:58] old thinking the old way of life and and
[39:00] also the leav of malice and wickedness
[39:03] now malice we know ultimately is having
[39:05] an evil intent it's not having a genuine
[39:07] motive amen we want to get rid of malice
[39:09] we don't want any you know preconceived
[39:11] ideas or alterior motives when we deal
[39:13] with one another or we speak to people
[39:15] or you know we want to be pure in our
[39:17] motives right we want to be sincere we
[39:19] don't want to have anything that you
[39:21] know Shady deals or anything like that
[39:22] we we must not have those things now
[39:25] sincerity here just go to the definition
[39:27] here it says you means of clearness
[39:29] that's by implication of Purity and the
[39:32] root word of that which is the next one
[39:33] down I won't try and pronounce it in the
[39:35] Greek it's it's judged by sunlight that
[39:37] is tested as genuine and we know the
[39:40] real sunlight that will test a sincerity
[39:42] is the sunlight of the light of God the
[39:44] S so n light amen that really you know
[39:46] it's amazing we can even deceive
[39:48] ourselves when we come into His presence
[39:50] that's all gone I mean if we're really
[39:52] genuine in our hearts we can have all
[39:53] these ideas and motives but you step
[39:55] into his presence realize that was wrong
[39:57] that was selfish that was that was evil
[39:59] that was perverted that was wrong
[40:01] thinking that was unbelief what's that
[40:02] it's been tested by sunlight I mean but
[40:05] I want to be in his presence where
[40:06] there's nothing I've got to put right
[40:08] cuz it was already put right I mean it
[40:09] was just rejoicing and Thanksgiving and
[40:11] praising God and amen that you I trust
[40:14] that's how everyone feels this morning
[40:15] so it's all but it's also the absence of
[40:18] pretense deceit or hypocrisy that is
[40:21] sincerity so you don't have any pretense
[40:23] nothing you know no no no preconceived
[40:25] ideaself selfish motives is not
[40:27] deceitful so you cannot be sincere and
[40:29] be deceitful you cannot be amen you
[40:32] cannot be sincere and be a hypocrite
[40:34] amen so to pretend to be one thing and
[40:37] be the other amen we you know that's not
[40:38] sincerity now right so we must not we
[40:42] must not approach this Feast of the word
[40:44] of God in any of these things we must be
[40:46] genuinely sincere amen and this is the
[40:49] hour where where we need to be very
[40:51] sincere now I'm just you know as always
[40:54] my notes are never in chronological
[40:55] order I don't know wife and but you know
[40:58] brother Bram would would would would
[40:59] have a vision in the message Paradox I'm
[41:01] just going to read portion of it it's
[41:02] very important because what he saw in
[41:05] vision is is is very much roaming the
[41:07] land today and it takes sincerity to
[41:09] bind it you know we we don't live we
[41:12] don't talk about a God and just talk
[41:13] about a God you know we this is not a
[41:16] lecture hall this is not a theory Center
[41:18] this is not a hypothetical Idea Place no
[41:21] our God is God Jesus Christ is alive
[41:23] amen he is the resurrected God he is not
[41:26] a theory he's a person he's a being he's
[41:28] the almighty God Amen so so this is this
[41:31] is not Theory we're talking about but
[41:33] this power is being placed in your lips
[41:35] I mean to bind or loose the devil it's
[41:37] up to you what you can loose them in
[41:39] your life by unbelief you can loose them
[41:41] in your life by selfishness you can
[41:42] loose the devil if you want to you can
[41:44] put up with him and you'll just have
[41:46] your pretty party and you'll go nowhere
[41:48] but you can bind him say Satan I'm not
[41:50] serving you I'm not putting up with your
[41:51] nonsense no more but you belong under my
[41:53] feet you have power to do it amen amen
[41:56] so he says here in this Vision he says
[41:57] it was about 3:00 in the morning I
[41:59] suppose I'd gotten up I looked where in
[42:01] front of me and I was coming down to the
[42:03] Jordan looked like I was I'm coming on
[42:05] the map of standing on the map of
[42:06] Palestine and I was coming down to the
[42:09] Jordan it seemed like I could hear the
[42:10] song I'm going down to the Jordan
[42:12] someone was singing it and as I drew
[42:14] near the river I looked back it seemed
[42:16] which way I had come and I was 2third of
[42:18] the way there to the Jordan and I looked
[42:20] across the Jordan I said oh praise God
[42:22] just on the other side is where all the
[42:24] promises lay every promise lays in the
[42:27] promised land now we know that our
[42:29] promised land is the Holy Ghost right
[42:31] it's not a physical piece of real estate
[42:33] somewhere it is all in Christ is our
[42:35] Promised Land every promise lays in him
[42:38] amen amen then as I sat there a little
[42:41] bit aside of this chair then all of a
[42:43] sudden there uh there it come back again
[42:45] then I knew it was a vision and then
[42:47] when IID come into the vision again it
[42:49] seemed like I was lifted up standing on
[42:51] a highway a narrow Highway with some
[42:53] brother I never knew who the brother was
[42:55] I looked around I said now I am sure I
[42:57] know this is Vision the Lord God is here
[42:59] and seemed like everybody was afraid
[43:02] this is a age of fearfulness what's
[43:05] Russia going to do what's China going to
[43:07] do what's North Korea going to do what's
[43:08] the economy going to do what's happening
[43:10] in our schools our homes all these
[43:11] things it's a fearful time right I said
[43:14] what's everybody afraid of and a voice
[43:17] came and said there is such danger in
[43:19] these days there is a great hideous
[43:21] thing that's death when it strikes you
[43:25] and I heard the weed mashing down and I
[43:27] looked and there was a huge monster
[43:28] snake crawling through the weeds I
[43:30] thought now knowing this is Vision then
[43:32] I shall see what this animal all this
[43:34] Beast is and he crawled up on the
[43:36] highway and as soon as I got sight of
[43:38] him I knew it was a Mamba now a Mamba is
[43:40] an African snake which is the most
[43:41] deadly bite of all the um thing there is
[43:44] there's nothing as poisonous as a mumber
[43:46] and the snake of course represents sin
[43:48] death sea and there is that we have in
[43:50] this country the the the rattlesnake and
[43:52] the copperhead and and and the
[43:54] cottonmouth moccasin many of those
[43:56] snakes that is if you're in bad Health
[43:57] the one would bite you it would perhaps
[43:59] kill you but if but if you didn't get um
[44:02] Aid of some sort right away and here he
[44:04] was on the highway and I thought well
[44:06] this is it so I looked at him and he
[44:08] looked angry at me and he licked his
[44:10] tongue and here he come but when but
[44:13] when he got right close to me he would
[44:15] run up fast and then he would get slower
[44:17] and slower and just quiver and stop now
[44:20] we know a mum in the natural will get up
[44:21] on its hand and actually run you know
[44:23] it's actually faster than a human I'm
[44:25] glad we don't have those things here in
[44:26] New Zealand and they will strike
[44:28] multiple people and they'll all be
[44:29] poisoned and get killed a very
[44:31] aggressive thing and that's like sin
[44:33] death is very aggressive but you see as
[44:35] this as this as this snake here would
[44:38] come come towards the prophet you know
[44:40] it it got slow and slower as it Advanced
[44:43] and then it couldn't get any closer to
[44:45] him amen and then see and then something
[44:49] and then something would hold him off he
[44:52] couldn't bite me now that's how
[44:54] important the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:56] is in this day I mean the devil will try
[44:58] and come come towards you he'll Advance
[45:00] he'll get angry at you but he's nothing
[45:02] but a bluff if you have the true baptism
[45:05] of the Holy Ghost amen he won't be able
[45:07] something will keep holding him off and
[45:09] now that's exactly what God does because
[45:11] he's our protector amen he's our Shield
[45:13] he's our he's our Mighty Fortress he's
[45:15] all of these things so when the enemy
[45:17] tries to strike you with spiritual death
[45:19] amen he can't bite you he may try and
[45:22] bite you he may he may chase after you
[45:23] he may breathe out his threatenings and
[45:25] his cursings and his he'll say I'm going
[45:27] to get you I'm going to destroy you but
[45:29] there's something that keeps holding him
[45:30] off and it's not religion it's not being
[45:32] a good person it's not just coming to
[45:34] church it's God on the inside of the
[45:36] inside it's when the Holy Ghost comes in
[45:39] amen the devil can't bite you with his
[45:40] poison fangs of unbelief that you
[45:43] totally deny the word see something he
[45:45] couldn't bite me and he would turn
[45:47] around on the other side try to approach
[45:48] from this side so he tries to approach
[45:50] from a different trial and a different
[45:52] problem a different situation but he
[45:54] just can't bite amen and he would get
[45:57] back and and start and swish right
[45:58] towards me and get slower and slower and
[46:00] then and then to a stop and then he
[46:02] would then it would shake like that and
[46:04] move back he couldn't strike me now this
[46:07] may just be a vision but this is very
[46:08] important that we can grasp these things
[46:10] that the Lord would put this in our
[46:11] hearts that sure there's death riding
[46:13] now notice brother Bram was lifted up on
[46:15] a highway right there's a way of
[46:17] Holiness amen so this was the path of
[46:19] Christians walking up into canaan's Fair
[46:21] land up and you know up into the
[46:23] promises of God and death is there
[46:26] spiritual death is there trying to stop
[46:28] people get to where they need to go amen
[46:30] amen so so this thing will try and bite
[46:32] each and every one of us we're not
[46:33] immune from it we're not immune from
[46:35] problems we're not immune from the
[46:37] spirit of unbelief and lukewarmness
[46:38] trying to grip our lives and just trying
[46:40] to make us cold formal church members
[46:42] see we are not immune from those things
[46:44] but if we have the Lord on the inside it
[46:46] doesn't matter how much he threatens his
[46:48] F doesn't matter the size of his fangs
[46:50] the swish of his tail he can't bite you
[46:52] none amen but see notice and then he
[46:54] turned and looked at my friend and away
[46:56] he went after my friend and I seen my
[46:58] friend just DRP jumping way in the air
[47:01] and over him and over him and over him
[47:03] trying and everything was striking out
[47:04] him I thought oh if it ever hits him
[47:06] it'll be instant death no wonder
[47:09] everybody's so scared see there's people
[47:11] in this room even this morning that that
[47:13] are in this position they're running
[47:15] scared because they don't have what they
[47:17] need to keep the mum away I mean you can
[47:19] be blessed by being associated with
[47:21] Believers sure there's blessings with
[47:23] that but when but you need God on the
[47:25] inside you can't just have god with you
[47:27] he's got to be in you yes amen so we
[47:31] don't ever want to be see we don't want
[47:33] to be in this see I threw up my hands oh
[47:35] God have mercy on my brother I said if
[47:38] that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill
[47:39] him and just then the serpent turned I
[47:42] mean then the serpent turned to me um
[47:44] when I said that looked at me again and
[47:46] the voice came from above me said you
[47:47] have been given power to bind him the
[47:50] worst or any amen so so we have power
[47:54] remember when Jesus even when he just
[47:56] commissioned his disciples in the 70 to
[47:58] go out and cast out Devils this is
[47:59] before Pentecost and then they came back
[48:02] rejoicing saying even the even these you
[48:04] know demons are subject to us because
[48:06] they went and cast out the Devils they
[48:08] healed the sick they raised the dead
[48:10] they did Mighty Miracles and Jesus said
[48:13] I I beheld Satan fall as lightning and
[48:15] brother Braham said that was the church
[48:17] rising in power so as the church Rising
[48:20] power the Devil Falls from his from his
[48:22] squatter Place amen from his place where
[48:25] cuz he thinks he has dominion over this
[48:26] Earth and he has dominion over you and I
[48:29] and he has dominion over human beings
[48:31] but if we're under the blood of Jesus
[48:32] Christ if we are filled with the Holy
[48:34] Ghost amen what we Ascend into Heavenly
[48:36] places in Christ Jesus our position in
[48:38] Christ and the devil is cast down so
[48:41] even before even before Calvary even
[48:43] before the blood was shed even before
[48:46] Pentecost Jesus said I saw Satan fall
[48:49] yeah how much more of people that are
[48:51] Blood Washed Blood Bought filled with
[48:52] the Holy Ghost the devil is well below
[48:55] amen but he'll try and make you think
[48:57] anything but that but we see the prophet
[48:59] was given power to bind him the worst or
[49:02] any now any promise given to him is
[49:03] given to the believer because the same
[49:05] God that was in him he he was a sinner
[49:07] saved by grace just like you and I right
[49:10] he had to repent he had to be baptized
[49:12] he had to give his life to the Lord he
[49:13] had to surrender he had to be filled
[49:15] with the Holy Ghost just like you and I
[49:17] and the same God in him is the same God
[49:18] in you and I that's right amen so so if
[49:21] he was given power to bind him sin death
[49:23] or the worst or any then we have that
[49:25] same authority over the enemy I said
[49:28] well God what must I do he said there is
[49:30] one thing you must do you must be more
[49:33] sincere see you must be more sincere I
[49:35] said well God forgive me for my
[49:37] insincerity and let me have sincerity
[49:40] see this is what we must be when we see
[49:42] the enemy try and come into our families
[49:44] come into our own lives we say Lord make
[49:46] me more sincere this enemy is trying to
[49:48] come among me trying to destroy my
[49:50] family destroy my life so see when the
[49:52] enemy comes in now then is not the time
[49:55] to pull back it is not the time to
[49:58] compromise it's not the time to quit
[49:59] it's not the time to have a pity party
[50:01] you know I remember reading of um um um
[50:04] Charles Spurgeon there was a prominent
[50:05] Christian in his fellowship and he
[50:07] stopped coming to church and so what he
[50:10] did is he is is he went and saw this guy
[50:12] didn't talk anything about God or
[50:13] anything and and and and there was coals
[50:16] on the fire and he took the iron prod
[50:18] thing iron you know just pulled one Co
[50:20] out onto the half didn't take very long
[50:23] it was it was glowing right glowing
[50:25] white hot to begin with and then it went
[50:28] darker red darker and then just went
[50:30] black the next service that guy was in
[50:32] church again amen cuz he cuz he got the
[50:35] sermon he got the sermon he he realized
[50:37] he was that coal yeah but I'm on fire
[50:40] I'm fine here but then you pull away
[50:41] withdraw what happens the fire goes out
[50:44] you're still cold you're still a
[50:45] Believer you still got potential to be
[50:47] on fire for God but withdrawing because
[50:49] the Bible says forsake not the
[50:50] assembling of ourselves together and so
[50:52] much more we see that day approaching
[50:54] amen and we're in 24 the day right here
[50:57] yes amen so so we should never withdraw
[50:59] because because the MERS trying to
[51:01] destroy us no we say Lord make me more
[51:04] sincere make me more genuine amen take
[51:07] take all living out of my life Lord any
[51:09] thought that I think I'm the great one
[51:10] I'm important anything that thinks that
[51:12] I'm special or different or whatever
[51:14] more anything that I think that I can
[51:15] just rest and what will be will be take
[51:17] that living out Lord and help me to to
[51:19] to to call on your name more than ever
[51:21] before help me be more genuine more
[51:24] honest more
[51:27] sincere and when I raised my hands to
[51:30] him again there was a great something
[51:31] came over me just lifted me
[51:33] up seemed like my whole body was charged
[51:36] with something and I looked at the
[51:37] serpent and then he stared towards me
[51:39] and he couldn't do it yet I said Satan
[51:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[51:43] bind you and the serpent a blue smoke
[51:46] flew out of him he curled up made like a
[51:48] sign like an s a capital S backwards and
[51:50] an sign means buy this one or anything
[51:52] below him cuz he was the worst blue
[51:55] smoke flew out of him and his tail
[51:57] choked his own self to death around his
[51:59] head uh when he made this backwards s
[52:02] that an sign like a conjunction you see
[52:04] choked it to death and the brother was
[52:06] free and I went over and mashed on it am
[52:09] that's right he mashed on the devil
[52:11] that's a good how do you mash on the
[52:12] devil you praise God how do you mash on
[52:14] the devil you love the Lord more that's
[52:15] really because people say I'm so angry
[52:17] at the Devil I hate him so much well how
[52:19] do you express that anger love God Amen
[52:21] be more surrender to the Lord love him
[52:23] more praise him more that's the thing
[52:24] that gives the de black eye see it's
[52:27] Thunder that shakes the devil amen is a
[52:29] consecrated sincere life and I went over
[52:32] and mashed on I said now I've got to
[52:34] find out about this because it's a
[52:35] vision and I hit on the thing and it
[52:37] turned like this it looked like a handle
[52:39] like a glass handle on a picture just
[52:41] made of solid Crystal I said think of
[52:42] that how quick that blue smoke was life
[52:45] and everything and how um and and
[52:48] everything and it just left at all the
[52:49] elements that turned to glass that's how
[52:51] quickly the devil can be destroyed in
[52:53] your life how quick one prayer one
[52:57] rebuke when the Lord anoints you say
[52:59] Satan come out in the name of Jesus
[53:00] Christ you've got to leave amen it's not
[53:04] a big wrestling match you know there's
[53:05] some books out there there's big
[53:07] hourlong battles with the devil and big
[53:09] fighting that's a bunch of unbelief
[53:10] trying to exalt the power of the devil
[53:12] brother Bram didn't have big long fights
[53:14] in the prayer line Jesus said just come
[53:16] out of them and he did because there's
[53:18] Authority in their voices amen and that
[53:20] same Authority is in the Bride of Jesus
[53:22] Christ it's not a big wrestling match
[53:24] some big Hollywood nonsense no just come
[53:26] out of her or come out of him in the
[53:28] name of Jesus Christ when you feel
[53:30] inspired to say it amen now and the
[53:34] voice came again said you can unbind him
[53:36] too also so I said then Satan that I
[53:39] might know I unbind you and when it did
[53:41] he he started coming to life again
[53:43] wriggling I said I bind you back in the
[53:45] name of Jesus Christ and when it did the
[53:47] smoke flew out of him again and he
[53:48] choked himself right back and turned to
[53:50] Crystal am me we see the same thing with
[53:53] Moses when he came down the first sign
[53:54] that God gave Moses was turning a staff
[53:57] into a serpent picking up by the tail
[53:58] and became a staff again and that's the
[54:00] first sign that was done before Pharaoh
[54:02] when Moses went down to Egypt and God
[54:04] was God was actually telling Pharaoh
[54:06] actually telling Satan and Pharaoh I can
[54:08] bind you and I can loose you because the
[54:11] Cobra is the emblem of the Pharaoh there
[54:12] in Egypt and so he says I can bind you
[54:14] and I can loose you as much as I want
[54:16] and if that was a man under the blood of
[54:18] bulls and goats commissioned by God to
[54:20] bring a Deliverance now how much more
[54:22] people under the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:24] commissioned by God to bring and
[54:25] deliverance amen the same pillar of
[54:27] father that me Moses has met you and I
[54:29] amen he's commissioned us to cast out
[54:30] Devils wherever we find him amen he's
[54:32] commissioned us to set the captives free
[54:35] amen he has commissioned us so you say
[54:36] well I'm waiting for God to do something
[54:38] God wants you to put your faith into
[54:39] action amen God wants you to step on the
[54:41] battlefield and take him at his word he
[54:43] wants you to do it amen but we must be
[54:46] sincere we must be more sincere if you
[54:48] think if the prophet had to be more
[54:50] sincere and he is a very sincere man how
[54:52] much more you and I how much more gen
[54:55] genuine do we need to be cuz you see
[54:57] Proverbs it says in Proverbs 18:21 life
[55:00] and death is in the power of the tongue
[55:01] and they that love it shall eat the
[55:03] fruit thereof amen so if you want life
[55:06] you want
[55:07] death what are you talking about what
[55:10] are you confessing if you're angry at
[55:12] God you're confessing death if you got a
[55:14] pity party upset cuz you're not happy
[55:16] with how he's running his business
[55:18] you're confessing death but if you just
[55:20] line up your confession amen with god
[55:22] with his word life will come amen and
[55:24] this what we should do amen see so we
[55:27] should never have we must be sincere you
[55:30] see many people will come to God but
[55:32] they're not sincere they want to try and
[55:34] trip him up as the Pharisees would come
[55:36] to the Lord Jesus and the only reason
[55:38] they asked him questions is to try and
[55:39] Tangle him in his words and his talk
[55:41] they weren't interested and he was the
[55:43] Fountain of eternal life this was this
[55:45] was the same God that met Moses was now
[55:48] in flesh but they weren't interested in
[55:50] in and actually this is Elohim this is
[55:53] Al Shai this is the Mighty God this is
[55:56] Jehovah God made flesh this Jesus Christ
[55:59] but they weren't interested in actually
[56:01] saying what must we do how can we serve
[56:04] you how can we know you better how can
[56:06] we walk with you like Moses did or the
[56:08] prophets or the Kings how can we worship
[56:10] you like David worshiped you how can we
[56:11] do these things no they because they
[56:13] weren't sincere they tried to entangle
[56:16] him in his
[56:17] words but yet they had their ceremonies
[56:20] their forms they weren't they didn't on
[56:22] the outwardly um appear indifferent they
[56:25] were very outwardly they looked very
[56:27] religious things but inside they weren't
[56:31] sincere but you see the woman at the
[56:33] well was a very different kind of person
[56:35] she was genuinely sincere I mean when
[56:37] when when Jesus told his disciples I
[56:39] need to go by the way of Samaria you
[56:41] know because he had a predestinated
[56:43] appointment with one of his children and
[56:45] that was a woman of ill Fame a woman we
[56:47] call the woman at the well she came to
[56:49] the well at the time when when The Other
[56:51] Woman didn't go because she wasn't
[56:53] welcome to go with them and they begin
[56:55] to talk about God and different things
[56:56] and you know she would say well our
[56:58] fathers worship here and worship there
[56:59] and different things but then but then
[57:02] Jesus said go get your husband and she
[57:04] says I have none and he said you've
[57:05] you've said right because you've had six
[57:07] and the one you you've had five and and
[57:09] the one you're with is not you know
[57:11] you're not even married and she said we
[57:12] know when Messiah cometh he'll tell us
[57:15] all these things see she wasn't trying
[57:17] to entangle him in in his words she was
[57:21] sincere yet on the outwards you think
[57:23] there's no hope for her she's lost she's
[57:25] not welcome in a church anywhere but she
[57:28] was generally sincere we know when
[57:29] Messiah cometh he'll tell us these
[57:31] things and Jesus said he that speaks to
[57:33] you am he she dropped her water pot she
[57:36] purged out the old Le and she dropped
[57:38] her old life she ran into the city said
[57:40] come see a man who's told me all I've
[57:42] ever did is this not the Messiah so she
[57:45] wasn't trying to entangle entangle him
[57:47] in his talk just like the Pharisees why
[57:50] cuz she was
[57:52] sincere you know there's there's say
[57:55] there's a power and
[57:57] sincerity which if I can find it
[58:03] here see brother says now it's even
[58:05] becoming Pentecost in the churches it's
[58:07] becoming into the Pentecostal Realms
[58:09] that they always promising something
[58:11] that they never get to it it's always
[58:13] that every fellow has a different
[58:15] sensation to make it whether it's
[58:16] scriptural or not and they're promising
[58:18] something that they never do get to
[58:21] until it seems like it's got to a place
[58:23] to where there doesn't seem to be any
[58:26] sincerity the people don't get down to
[58:29] that real kernel of sincerity now the
[58:31] kernel is where the life is in the seed
[58:34] so the very life of sincerity they don't
[58:37] seems that they don't get to that the
[58:39] very English word of sincerity has lost
[58:41] its value to the people or by the way or
[58:44] by the people's way of living it's lost
[58:47] its sincerity to them now they don't
[58:49] seem to understand even to our
[58:51] confessions now I want you people that
[58:53] are coming or here here to hold or on
[58:55] the tape I want you to listen real close
[58:57] now a moment to this quotation brother B
[59:00] says unless you're deeply sincere you
[59:02] cannot be sincere until your POS until
[59:06] you your positive understanding until
[59:08] you're positively understood if you're
[59:10] presuming or guessing or hoping so then
[59:13] there cannot be a depth of sincerity
[59:15] that God requires see if it's revealed
[59:18] to you it will produce a
[59:21] sincerity and that's what we need to
[59:23] pray for Lord make it a Revelation to me
[59:26] make every promise in your word a
[59:27] revelation don't just have it in my head
[59:29] that it sounds like a good idea make it
[59:31] a revelation because if it's actually if
[59:34] the word is actually a revelation then
[59:36] it will produce the sincerity then it
[59:38] will change the life amen see see
[59:43] um faith faith is not a hope so or it
[59:46] could be right it's got to be absolutely
[59:49] amen or I'll put in some kiwi lingo it's
[59:52] not a she'll be right that's not not
[59:54] Faith that's just hope that's just human
[59:57] hope not even Bible Hope bible hope is
[59:59] actually an expectation but but human
[1:00:02] hope is just a stab in the dark like
[1:00:03] people trying to win the lotto kind of
[1:00:05] thing not advocating any of that stuff
[1:00:07] but you see it's just but you see it's
[1:00:09] not a she'll be right it's got to be an
[1:00:12] absolute
[1:00:13] see um it's got to be absolutely amen
[1:00:16] it's your ultimate it's your absolute
[1:00:17] it's the thing that you're tied to see
[1:00:19] you have to come to your ultimate that
[1:00:21] is it is the truth and there is there's
[1:00:22] nothing but the truth it must be us and
[1:00:25] when you realize that in your mind then
[1:00:27] you've got to approach it with your
[1:00:28] whole life soul body that's all that's
[1:00:30] in you just completely sell out to
[1:00:33] everything to it as Jesus so graciously
[1:00:36] taught us the man buying pearls and he
[1:00:38] found the one of great price and he sold
[1:00:40] all the others to get to it all the
[1:00:42] truths and everything that he had though
[1:00:44] they were good pearls this one meant all
[1:00:47] to him am mean so it's like the saraph
[1:00:50] phenician woman who had a daughter that
[1:00:52] was grievously vexed with a devil it was
[1:00:54] was revealed to her that Jesus could
[1:00:56] cast that devil out that that this was
[1:00:58] more than a prophet it was more than
[1:01:00] just a religious man this was the god of
[1:01:02] the prophets amen so what did it do it
[1:01:04] made it it made her deeply sincere amen
[1:01:08] it made her approach deeply sincere when
[1:01:10] she approach the Lord you see even she
[1:01:12] had a lot of hindrances but her faith
[1:01:14] her Revelation didn't have any hindrance
[1:01:16] am mean because she came calling out
[1:01:18] master and Son of David have mercy on me
[1:01:20] and then even the disciples said well
[1:01:22] she's calling after us send her away and
[1:01:24] then Jesus said I haven't been sent to
[1:01:26] you I've just been sent to the lost
[1:01:28] sheep of Israel she's a gentile now
[1:01:30] someone who's insincere would get
[1:01:32] offended and say this very man who
[1:01:33] claims to heal the sick raise the dead
[1:01:35] and be here to help everyone he won't
[1:01:37] even help me and you know forget about
[1:01:39] that kind of I'm not following this kind
[1:01:40] of a God but you see she was sincere and
[1:01:43] because it was revealed to her that he
[1:01:45] had what she needed I mean even her even
[1:01:48] him trying to turn her away didn't stop
[1:01:50] her that's right I mean cuz she knew she
[1:01:53] could get what she needed am out of him
[1:01:55] it wasn't I hope this is going to work
[1:01:57] let's see what happens no it was
[1:01:59] revealed so if it's revealed it's got to
[1:02:01] happen amen but youo she said I mean you
[1:02:04] know he said to her youo it's not even
[1:02:06] fit to feed the children's bread to dogs
[1:02:08] and you know basically just calling her
[1:02:10] a dog that didn't hinder her that didn't
[1:02:12] hinder her faith rather she said true
[1:02:14] Lord but even the even the dogs eat the
[1:02:16] crumbs under the master's table the
[1:02:18] children's table and and he said great
[1:02:21] is your faith go have watch you you know
[1:02:24] you what you have need of and and she
[1:02:26] went home and found her daughter was
[1:02:27] free why what happened she had a deep
[1:02:30] sincerity I mean she saw that M was
[1:02:33] trying to destroy her daughter and she
[1:02:35] wouldn't take it just for granted saying
[1:02:37] this is just how life this is just the
[1:02:38] grab bag of life kind of thing she did
[1:02:40] not settle for that amen but she settled
[1:02:42] no there's there's a God in the land am
[1:02:45] mean Jehovah is alive this this one that
[1:02:47] Jews just told me about as alive and I'm
[1:02:50] not going to settle to I get a hold of
[1:02:52] him and he speaks the word am my my
[1:02:54] family is free and that's how we should
[1:02:56] be the same it should be revealed to us
[1:02:57] it should give us a deep sense of
[1:02:59] sincerity that that same God is alive
[1:03:01] Among Us has he not done all things well
[1:03:04] has he not cast out the devil has he not
[1:03:05] healed our sick has he not filled with
[1:03:07] the Holy Ghost has he not done many
[1:03:09] tremendous Miracles he's brought
[1:03:11] prodical home amen he's done incredible
[1:03:13] things and that should give such a
[1:03:15] sincerity because we realize if he's
[1:03:17] done it for that person he'll do it for
[1:03:18] me if he's done it for her he'll do it
[1:03:20] for me amen because why he is God and he
[1:03:23] respects faith and he's given us Faith
[1:03:25] to claim his promises and take him at
[1:03:27] his word hallelujah so this is why it's
[1:03:29] so important she approached it with her
[1:03:31] whole body soul and mind and everything
[1:03:34] she sold out completely to that thought
[1:03:36] I've got to get a hold of him I trust
[1:03:39] we're sold out today amen see the pearl
[1:03:41] of great price many times we think
[1:03:43] there's no there's no battle in
[1:03:45] obtaining the Pearl but there is there's
[1:03:47] a battle over unbelief a battle over
[1:03:49] self amen that can we lay aside our
[1:03:52] value of what we think lay it aside and
[1:03:55] take that pearl of great price which is
[1:03:57] Christ and say this is my everything not
[1:04:00] what people think about me is my
[1:04:01] everything not my not my pay scale not
[1:04:04] my job not my whatevers that's not my
[1:04:06] everything here is my everything amen
[1:04:09] amen and that's if we can just come like
[1:04:10] that I believe that God will do
[1:04:12] incredible
[1:04:15] things see we've we can't just sit back
[1:04:19] and say Lord If It Be Your Will sure now
[1:04:23] there's one part of that cuz God is in
[1:04:24] control of all things but you can sit
[1:04:27] there saying well Lord yes or no that's
[1:04:29] fine and it's actually just unbelief
[1:04:30] hindering
[1:04:32] you you say well everything's
[1:04:34] predestinated
[1:04:36] well yes or no I say if I'm
[1:04:39] predestinated I'm going to fulfill every
[1:04:40] promise that's allotted to me in the
[1:04:42] word amen if I if I'm really this word
[1:04:45] made flesh I'm going to be it amen I I'm
[1:04:48] probably going to talk about the youth
[1:04:49] service but there's a meme I just put it
[1:04:50] up there's a guy sitting there behind a
[1:04:53] computer screen you know just some
[1:04:55] person and he says you know I'm saving
[1:04:57] myself for a like a real nice virgin
[1:04:59] Trad wife traditional wife and there's
[1:05:02] the other screen where it's this girl
[1:05:04] there holy looking she's praying Lord I
[1:05:07] got to find some kind of loser who has
[1:05:08] no job no ambition no nothing I'm
[1:05:10] looking for that kind of person boy
[1:05:13] that's not what anyone I'm sure all of
[1:05:14] you sisters here are not married you
[1:05:16] don't want some man who's got no
[1:05:17] ambition drive and motive behind you you
[1:05:19] want someone who's got Vision who's got
[1:05:21] who's got the future in mind who's
[1:05:22] trying to build a life and build home
[1:05:24] and build a
[1:05:26] career okay there's some good if you
[1:05:29] want someone who's going nowhere well
[1:05:30] there's plenty of them out there but you
[1:05:32] know we don't want to but you see you
[1:05:34] can't just say what will be will be no
[1:05:36] what are you ordained to be am mean
[1:05:39] don't just sit back and say well God's
[1:05:41] got to push me through a pipe no no God
[1:05:43] don't push you through a pipe and make
[1:05:44] you overcome make you walk with him no
[1:05:47] it's got to be your own will say yes I'm
[1:05:48] coming Lord doesn't matter what obstacle
[1:05:50] what trouble I'm going to go through it
[1:05:52] Lord because you're going to take me
[1:05:53] through it amen amen so yeah anyway I'm
[1:05:56] going to I want to talk about that
[1:05:57] because it's so true man A picture
[1:05:59] speaks a th you paints a thousand words
[1:06:01] or whatever he says now now no God's
[1:06:03] provided way is the best way they got no
[1:06:06] better way for the baby to get what he
[1:06:08] wants than to cry for it you know you
[1:06:11] can put a video monitor right by your
[1:06:13] baby you can see it it doesn't sit up
[1:06:15] and push the button and say mama I'm
[1:06:17] ready for milk now no or daddy no they
[1:06:20] start crying cuz that's God's provided
[1:06:23] way there's a need and it's expressed
[1:06:26] right and it don't settle until it gets
[1:06:28] the need met that's a child you say man
[1:06:31] they're perseverant and and and Jesus
[1:06:34] said if we just need the faith of a
[1:06:35] little child I mean they are perseverant
[1:06:38] because they know the reason they CED to
[1:06:40] you is they know that you can provide
[1:06:41] that need amen they they are not
[1:06:44] guessing I wonder if I'm going to get
[1:06:45] milk today I wonder if I'm going to get
[1:06:46] fed no they know it because you've done
[1:06:49] it before and you've done it before and
[1:06:51] you've done it every day of their life
[1:06:52] until that moment and it's should be the
[1:06:54] same thing with us and God we should
[1:06:55] look into this word and see how many
[1:06:57] promises he's fulfilled amen how many
[1:07:00] miracles he's done every time the
[1:07:02] promise he has given he's fulfilled it
[1:07:04] then we should cry to God say God you
[1:07:05] did it for them now do it for me that's
[1:07:08] right there may have to be a lot of
[1:07:09] changing going on in here until the
[1:07:11] promise is fulfilled that's fine I trust
[1:07:14] you're willing to be changed see we many
[1:07:16] need to see there's nothing wrong with
[1:07:18] God we' got to get in condition for God
[1:07:20] to meet with us right just like the you
[1:07:23] know in the upper room took them 10 days
[1:07:26] to get all their carnality out of the
[1:07:28] way all their Humanity they fussing
[1:07:30] their troubles they thing until the on
[1:07:32] the day when the day of Pentecost was
[1:07:34] fully come there were one heart one mind
[1:07:37] one Accord why cuz it wasn't Clicks in
[1:07:39] the church anymore was and I think this
[1:07:41] and you think this and we think this no
[1:07:43] they got rid of all that stuff they
[1:07:44] purged out the old leaven amen that God
[1:07:47] came down and filled them yes praise the
[1:07:50] Lord now yes see as Dr BOS used to say
[1:07:54] the baby that cries the loudest gets the
[1:07:56] best service oh amen that's about the
[1:07:59] way it is that goes up for God's
[1:08:01] children I could parallel that for you
[1:08:03] if a if a man go up and say well chew is
[1:08:05] chewing gum real well says well father
[1:08:07] I'm here tonight if you want to give me
[1:08:08] the Holy Ghost you're right I'm here but
[1:08:10] if you want to you know but if you want
[1:08:11] to heal me I'm sitting here but if you
[1:08:13] don't why that's all right it's your
[1:08:14] will Lord he's done wrote the will out
[1:08:17] of here in the Bible this is your will
[1:08:19] all right this is his will right here
[1:08:21] and if you want me to have it I'll have
[1:08:23] it but nevertheless if you don't why
[1:08:25] that's all right you'll never get
[1:08:26] nowhere that's right you'll never get
[1:08:28] nowhere it may sound all very good but
[1:08:30] you'll never get nowhere that's right
[1:08:33] the violent take the kingdom by force am
[1:08:35] mean the promises of God are not taken
[1:08:37] by the jellyfish right no the promises
[1:08:40] taken by real Faith real Godly
[1:08:42] conviction and sincerity yes amen see
[1:08:45] because you see now if you don't have
[1:08:48] genuine sincerity it's a sign of
[1:08:50] lukewarmness a Blas attitude is a sign
[1:08:52] of lukewarmness we serve God we don't
[1:08:56] serve just some Spirit somewhere we
[1:08:58] serve the god that made your body made
[1:09:00] this made the materials that made your
[1:09:01] body made this made this place where
[1:09:03] you're sitting in the chairs you sit in
[1:09:05] are made out of what he spoke right the
[1:09:08] reason you're alive is he's given you
[1:09:10] breath I think we should be sincere
[1:09:12] about that thank you Lord I have another
[1:09:14] day amen praise the Lord thank you Lord
[1:09:16] that I can I can know you I can walk
[1:09:18] with you in this
[1:09:20] hour yeah amen glory so sincerity is
[1:09:24] very important it's absolutely important
[1:09:27] if you want to be able to bind the mum
[1:09:30] cuz the power is in the bride to do it
[1:09:32] the power of that spoken word to be
[1:09:34] lifted up and have dominion over that
[1:09:36] spirit it's in you but you've got to be
[1:09:38] sincere see this is see it's the colonel
[1:09:41] brother B speaks about if I can find it
[1:09:44] here and I trust I'm not boring you but
[1:09:47] you see he's got he says about
[1:09:51] even he speaks about your humility now I
[1:09:54] know these things all merge into one
[1:09:55] another but I just wanted to put this in
[1:09:56] because I was looking at the brother
[1:09:58] speak about the real Colonel and he says
[1:10:00] about you I won't read this but he say
[1:10:02] about you know you know he finished up
[1:10:03] reading all the church histories and
[1:10:05] he's read about St Martin in uh France
[1:10:08] and you know the Catholic Church refused
[1:10:10] to canonize him but he is a real Saint
[1:10:11] he was a church age messenger for that
[1:10:13] day you know he raised the dead healed
[1:10:14] the sick cast out Devils did many mighty
[1:10:17] acts of the spirit spoken unknown
[1:10:19] tongues seen visions and all those
[1:10:20] things but the secret of his power was
[1:10:22] humility yeah many people want to know
[1:10:26] about the power but it's the secret for
[1:10:28] the power but see because the thing is
[1:10:29] we don't operate the Holy Ghost right
[1:10:32] the Holy Ghost operates you amen see
[1:10:34] it's not us saying Lord I've got to get
[1:10:36] a hold of you it's Lord get a hold of me
[1:10:39] get a hold of me and change me you see
[1:10:41] when we worship God and we're singing I
[1:10:43] trust you can raise your hands and
[1:10:44] surrender so you can do everything you
[1:10:46] want but if you can't raise your hands
[1:10:47] hand something's wrong with you I mean
[1:10:49] because that's what worship worship to
[1:10:51] bring us to a place that's why I love
[1:10:52] that song Elohim says there was such a
[1:10:55] worship at the end of the song service
[1:10:56] where it's our attention's on God he's
[1:10:59] the big one in the place he's the main
[1:11:00] one we're just we're not even in the
[1:11:02] picture he is the picture right and it
[1:11:04] generates a worship and that's what real
[1:11:07] real singing and praise should generate
[1:11:08] it's not about it's not about how well
[1:11:10] you can sing about how you dance or
[1:11:13] don't dance no it's your focus is on him
[1:11:15] your heart is Lord I want more of you am
[1:11:18] me what is that that's real genuine
[1:11:20] humility see I was going to see well I'm
[1:11:23] going to read the second part but yet in
[1:11:24] the very secret of his power was
[1:11:26] humility before God and we find today
[1:11:28] that the church yet teaching its power
[1:11:30] and teaching the signs to follow the
[1:11:32] believer yet we find them puffed out big
[1:11:34] me little you and that if it isn't it
[1:11:38] isn't like the early church you see they
[1:11:40] were humble and and kind to one another
[1:11:43] and sweet in understanding and it was so
[1:11:45] and it's so much different today wow see
[1:11:48] we can't compare churches we can't think
[1:11:51] our Camp's better than that camp our
[1:11:52] church is better than this church our
[1:11:54] singing is better than this one our
[1:11:55] music or our preaching or whatever you
[1:11:57] can't compare cuz that is a leav that
[1:11:59] comes into your life that will change
[1:12:01] your sweet humble Christian attitude and
[1:12:04] it will change the fiber of all that you
[1:12:06] are and use a stuffed shirt proud
[1:12:09] arrogant dead is a post with God we
[1:12:13] can't allow that kind of thinking we
[1:12:15] must never compare ourselves with
[1:12:17] ourselves amen we must compare ourselves
[1:12:20] with the word of
[1:12:21] God see they were humble to one another
[1:12:24] sweet understanding and it's so much
[1:12:25] different today and I wonder if a if a
[1:12:27] lot of this hasn't sidetracked us from
[1:12:30] the real kernel of the message the real
[1:12:33] life of the message amen the whole
[1:12:35] purpose of the message is that Christ
[1:12:37] would come and dwell in you you would be
[1:12:39] his love prisoner and he would have
[1:12:41] preeminence his word would have
[1:12:42] preeminence in our lives right there
[1:12:44] would be walking talking Bibles amen
[1:12:46] amen that that is the purpose of the
[1:12:48] message that's why Malachi 4 came that's
[1:12:50] why the seals came open that's why the
[1:12:52] mighty angel came down with an open book
[1:12:53] book amen that the life of God would
[1:12:55] inhabit people once again amen that that
[1:12:58] that when people see you and I they
[1:12:59] would see the word made flesh you see so
[1:13:02] we don't want to be sidetracked from the
[1:13:03] real kernel or the real life of the
[1:13:05] message I mean you see we want to be to
[1:13:07] Humble ourselves I mean the more humbl
[1:13:09] you can be the better God will use you
[1:13:13] and mean when you realize that without
[1:13:14] him you can do nothing like Jesus said
[1:13:16] without me you can do
[1:13:18] nothing that should make us real sincere
[1:13:20] shouldn't it that should make us real
[1:13:22] humble Lord I'm not nothing without you
[1:13:24] but but with you I can do all things
[1:13:26] through Christ which strengthens me amen
[1:13:30] amen amen that's how we want to be amen
[1:13:32] I trust we're just going to continue
[1:13:34] down this vein I hope we're all okay
[1:13:36] amen but you see sincerity is absolutely
[1:13:43] important amen even even we're just
[1:13:45] going to go back here so even in Exodus
[1:13:47] here in Exodus chapter 12 they were they
[1:13:50] were commanded to to take all the 11 out
[1:13:52] of their homes now this we know this is
[1:13:54] all in type right so we're not just
[1:13:56] living with unleavened bread physically
[1:13:59] right this Feast that we approach and
[1:14:01] sincerity and Truth is the word that
[1:14:03] we're feeding on so he says for seven
[1:14:05] days you shall eat unleavened bread
[1:14:07] that's speaking of seven Church ages am
[1:14:09] mean when the first day you shall put
[1:14:11] away leaven from out of your houses for
[1:14:12] whosoever eateth leaven bread from the
[1:14:14] first day till the seventh day that Soul
[1:14:16] shall be cut off from Israel so we we
[1:14:18] can't we can't approach the Lord and
[1:14:21] feed on his word with any malice Strife
[1:14:22] unbelief in our hearts they all that all
[1:14:25] must be gone amen all man's ideas have
[1:14:28] got to be purged out of us I mean we
[1:14:30] cannot have this Feast with any of those
[1:14:32] things it's got to be taken away I mean
[1:14:35] any any any thought that makes you doubt
[1:14:37] the word of God and make you doubt God's
[1:14:40] ability in your life that's leav amen
[1:14:43] that's leav if there's any thought in
[1:14:44] your mind thinking God can't do it and
[1:14:46] if he would have done it he would have
[1:14:48] done it long ago and he just and my
[1:14:50] problem's too big that's leav that's
[1:14:52] right you got to Pur it out of your
[1:14:53] you're thinking God is more than able is
[1:14:55] anything too hard for the
[1:14:57] Lord amen all things are possible to
[1:15:00] them that believe amen so you see so so
[1:15:04] this leav it's got to be purged out so
[1:15:06] we must keep this Feast with with since
[1:15:09] of sincerity and Truth now we know Le is
[1:15:12] is um as Jesus would say the disciples
[1:15:15] thought in Matthew 16 that he was just
[1:15:16] talking about natural bread and and you
[1:15:19] know those things but he said no that
[1:15:21] you should beware the living be the leav
[1:15:23] of the Pharisees and the Sadducees then
[1:15:25] understood how that they B him uh um not
[1:15:29] Beware of the leaven of the bread but of
[1:15:30] the doctr of the Pharisees and of the
[1:15:33] Sadducees see this is what we must be we
[1:15:37] must beware of are you all following me
[1:15:39] this morning amen that anything that
[1:15:41] makes us insincere is leaven it's got to
[1:15:45] be purged out am mean we can't live with
[1:15:47] any
[1:15:48] pretense any kind of you know saying
[1:15:51] saying one thing and doing another we
[1:15:52] can't have any of that that's got to be
[1:15:54] purged out of our Lives we must be
[1:15:56] deadly sincere amen because death is
[1:15:58] riding in the land today we know the
[1:16:00] fourth seal is open amen death is about
[1:16:03] to take its last ride I mean all the
[1:16:05] Machinery is here you know the P horse
[1:16:07] rid is riding and that way but you know
[1:16:09] all those things are
[1:16:11] happening but there's only one place
[1:16:14] where you can be safe from it there's
[1:16:16] only one place there's not two places
[1:16:18] there's only one place and I'm sure we
[1:16:20] all want to be spiritually alive we
[1:16:22] don't want to be we don't want death to
[1:16:24] strike amen and the only way is to get
[1:16:26] under the blood of Jesus Christ that's
[1:16:28] the only way under the blood if you're
[1:16:30] under the blood you're safe amen amen
[1:16:33] it's and and it's so important in 2024
[1:16:35] that we are under the blood that we
[1:16:37] don't play Church you know the devil
[1:16:39] doesn't play he's not playing a game
[1:16:42] I've got you I win again your turn no he
[1:16:46] he's not playing he ain't playing games
[1:16:48] just like Putin's not playing games all
[1:16:50] these military is fighting Hamas isn't
[1:16:52] playing games Israel's not playing games
[1:16:55] Ukraine's not playing games they're
[1:16:56] fighting the Battle of their lives the
[1:16:58] Ukraine country they're fighting a
[1:17:00] battle for existence that's right and
[1:17:02] they know if NATO stops helping them in
[1:17:04] the and America they're done right the
[1:17:08] devil isn't playing games with you he's
[1:17:10] not trying to isolate you and fill you
[1:17:13] with unbelief and make you doubt
[1:17:14] everything and and and forget who you
[1:17:16] are just to play a game oh now I'm going
[1:17:18] to let you out now now would you let's
[1:17:20] play this again sometime no the devil
[1:17:22] wants to destroy D
[1:17:23] us I know this is very serious but hey
[1:17:26] the devil wants to destroy you and I so
[1:17:28] if he's not playing why do we play why
[1:17:31] do we play games with him I'll tag
[1:17:33] you're it or I win now now let's play
[1:17:36] again no we should drive him out amen
[1:17:39] and keep him out amen he's not welcome
[1:17:41] amen amen instead of a sign don't mean
[1:17:44] this is a joke people have got the sign
[1:17:45] on their property beware of dog keeps
[1:17:47] people away we shall Beware of the Holy
[1:17:50] Ghost the strong man in the house amen
[1:17:53] if he's in the house amen then then it
[1:17:54] should keep the devil away it's the only
[1:17:56] way to keep him away amen I don't mean
[1:17:58] that as a joke but you we got to if the
[1:18:00] devil's not playing games we shouldn't
[1:18:02] be playing games either I mean you see
[1:18:05] but
[1:18:07] sincerity see Peter had to come to a
[1:18:10] place where his pretense of being the
[1:18:13] Macho Man was taken away I'm going to
[1:18:15] finish with this thought won't be too
[1:18:16] long this morning see Peter you know
[1:18:18] Jesus said everyone's going to you know
[1:18:20] everyone's going to forsake me and and
[1:18:23] Peter said no I'm going to die with you
[1:18:25] I'm going to stand with you he had a
[1:18:26] pretense that that that he could do it
[1:18:28] he was the Macho Man but you see and and
[1:18:32] in his in his uh human ability all he
[1:18:34] did was cut one man's ear off miserably
[1:18:36] fail trying to kill the guy protecting
[1:18:38] the Lord Jesus you know and then he was
[1:18:39] there outside um Pilot's judgment Hall
[1:18:42] trying to warm himself by the fire just
[1:18:44] trying to keep through the night and it
[1:18:46] wasn't even any of the chief priests or
[1:18:48] scribes or no one in Authority came and
[1:18:50] questioned him it was a servant girl it
[1:18:53] was another servant one said weren't you
[1:18:56] there I saw you in the garden you know
[1:18:57] one of the men then a girl said aren't
[1:18:58] you a gilean aren't you one of them
[1:19:00] because you're speech and all these
[1:19:01] things and and his pretense was actually
[1:19:04] blown away because he didn't actually
[1:19:07] have what he thought he had and it's
[1:19:09] actually a very good thing when we get
[1:19:11] to a place where we realize what we what
[1:19:13] we thought we have we don't have cuz
[1:19:15] when we realize we don't have what we
[1:19:17] thought we have then we can get what we
[1:19:18] need amen it's actually a
[1:19:21] blessing so so Peter had to miserably
[1:19:24] fail until his sincerity came right
[1:19:27] that's right and then Jesus when he
[1:19:29] arose CU he knew all this would happen
[1:19:31] but he said go tell my disciples and
[1:19:34] Peter amen they have risen right but
[1:19:37] then Peter because his pretense was
[1:19:39] taken away but in his heart of hearts he
[1:19:41] was actually very sincere because when
[1:19:43] they were fishing that you know that
[1:19:45] Resurrection day whenever it was or
[1:19:46] afterwards you know they saw Jesus on
[1:19:48] the on the Shore Bank Peter didn't know
[1:19:51] if Jesus had forgiven him he didn't know
[1:19:53] if he' be accepted by the master but he
[1:19:55] jumped in the water went swimming to him
[1:19:56] anyway see that's a real to me a real
[1:19:58] genuine sincere heart when all the
[1:20:00] pretense is taken away amen right they
[1:20:03] come to the Lord and you know because
[1:20:05] they don't know where else to go
[1:20:07] hallelujah amen then Jesus said Do You
[1:20:10] Love Me Peter he says of course I love
[1:20:11] you feed my sheep and feed my lambs and
[1:20:13] all these things but you see Peter
[1:20:14] became the right his sincerity came
[1:20:17] right and then he became the spokesman
[1:20:20] on the day of Pentecost and then when he
[1:20:22] went before the
[1:20:23] Sanhedrin that that Mum that was in that
[1:20:26] you know that religious spirit trying to
[1:20:28] destroy them it couldn't strike them it
[1:20:31] couldn't bite him because he because
[1:20:32] they didn't bow to that pressure amen
[1:20:35] amen and it's the same thing today
[1:20:36] friends I pray with all my heart this
[1:20:39] morning that that Mum will be bound in
[1:20:42] every life amen that will be real we'll
[1:20:44] be more sincere this year than we've
[1:20:46] ever been in our entire Christian walk
[1:20:48] amen we'll be more dedicated more sold
[1:20:50] out we'll love the Lord more more than
[1:20:52] any any other time of our life am
[1:20:54] because that the spirit of death is
[1:20:57] riding the land but if we're truly under
[1:20:59] the blood of Jesus Christ it can't get
[1:21:02] you just like that m in the vision
[1:21:03] couldn't get the prophet amen let's
[1:21:05] finish there this morning I didn't want
[1:21:07] to keep you long but let's um let's have
[1:21:09] the musicians please this
