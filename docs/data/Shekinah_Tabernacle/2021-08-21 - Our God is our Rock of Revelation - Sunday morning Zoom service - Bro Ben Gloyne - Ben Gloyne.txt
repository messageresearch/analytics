good to be a christian in this hour i believe you know i think it's real good amen um first samuel and we're gonna go to um verse three that's here it says and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if you do return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and esteroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines then the children of israel did put away by balaam and asteroth and served the lord only and samuel said gather all israel to mizpah and i will pray for you unto the lord and they gathered together to mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the lord and samuel judge the children of israel and mizpah and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpah the lords of the philistines went up against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry out unto the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines and samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it for a burnt offering holy unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and and discomforted them and they were smitten before israel and the men of israel went out to mizpah and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came unto bethka then samuel took a stone and said it between mispa and shin and called the play uh called the name of it ebenezer saying heather to hath the lord helped us amen i want to speak this morning about how our god is our rock of revelation and as this is bower he's in a word of prayer and lets us

name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i'd like to say uh happy birthday to brother moore god bless you trust you're having a wonderful lockdown birthday there god bless you my friend amen praise the lord let's um so uh so i'm just opening my notes so i'm looking at you on my computer i've got my notes on my phone i've got my bible open so multitasking can be a struggle even uh well it is for me but anyway i'd like to speak about our god is our rock of revelation now i want you to notice here that israel as they were coming to you know coming back to the lord they had the vindicated prophet there on the scene and and it's it's always amazing when when man begins to decide to serve god and put away other guys that the enemy comes in to try and destroy them now here they were they they they cried out and and we read here that samuel offered a um a suckling lamb called out to the lord and then they you know our and then the lord came down and fought the battle for them that it was god supernaturally delivering israel now we know that our god is our rock right here's our revelation so during the service when i talk about our god think of revelation right because he is the the rock that the church is built upon is divine revelation so i want you to notice so so um samuel put this rock here called um you know he put the stone here between mizpah and shen and called its name ebenezer which is you know the lord has helped us so it's called the rock of help now their god was always a rock of help he always was a god that delivered a god that you know fought their battles but god and every generation wanted to reveal that to the people and and um as as we'll go through this we'll see that the same god for the battles for joshua amen has fought the battles for israel here with samuel and he's the same god today now brother braham says in the church age book now now he's speaking of um when when god showed him who the messengers to every age was every star to every age but this is a keystone for the whole bible he says the key given me of the lord when i was able to determine the messenger for each age is the most scriptural one in fact it might be called the keystone of of the bible it is the revelation that god never changes and that his ways are as unchanging as he is in hebrews 13 8 it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever ecclesiastes 3 14 i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it neither can any anything be taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god require requireth that which is past here it is an unchanging god with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until he is done for the last time there will never be a change so our god is a great unchanging god and that was brother brahms you could say rallying cry was jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but so he's the same god as i said he's the same god that fought the battles for joshua and the children of israel taking the land was the same god that fought the battles there amen for for samuel and israel at mizpah but it had to become a revelation to the to that generation that their god was still alive that he still fought their battle see it was no good for them to have a historical god they had to have a god that was real to them a god of realities and it's the same thing with you and i you know our life is built upon divine revelation amen amen that divine revelation is what the church is built upon and so we can say our god is our rock amen and a rock is a revelation in the scripture now i just want to read here um as i said he you know he never changes now we read in the opening scripture that the lord um this discomforted the philistines and they were smitten before israel now god had god had already done this before because remember he's the unchanging god so in exodus 14 it says here now moses would tell the people of the red sea he would say fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace so now god was revealing himself as the god who fought the people's battles amen he's the one who steps on the scene and fights the battle supernaturally and then we come forward now 40 odd years down the road from exodus 14 and joshua and the children of israel are in the land and joshua says here uh there's joshua 10 and 8 and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and the lord discomforted them just the same same action discomforted them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goth up to betheron and smote them at asaka and unto machida and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in going down to betharan the lord cast down great stones from from heaven upon them unto azakuba and they died and there were more which died with half stones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword so the same god that discomforted the enemy there in joshua's day was the same god that fought the battle there for the israelites against the philistines and at them and there was a great victory he's the same god today he's here to fight our battles we're not alone in this walk by ourselves jesus would ask the question now we know this is very fundamental but but i trust you can uh you know i trust her be a blessing to you where jesus would ask his disciples in matthew 16. he would ask the question who do men say that i am and they would respond some say that you are john the baptist or elias or one of the prophets but then that that answer the lord was uh i mean i mean the answer they gave him wasn't really what he wanted because he said but who do you say so jesus knew um you know they knew he was some kind of prophet this is this is who men say he was he's a prophet because they could see the life of elias of jeremiah or one of the prophets they could see that life being manifested in jesus christ because there was a portion of god and all those prophets but jesus rules the fullness of the god here bodily so a part of what was manifested there in in the prophets was manifest in its fullness in jesus christ but then jesus asked the question but who do you say that i am and simon peter says thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him bless out thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you um but my father which is in heaven and i say to thee upon this rock i'll build he said and i sent him thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so remember the whole subject of this of this conversation is revelation what's been revealed to the people who do they say i am so in other words what has you know what as the conclusion that's come to them of who i am what has been revealed to them and they said well he must be one of the prophets but but that wasn't you know the real revelation of who jesus was because remember he is the image of the invisible god so so simon peter was asked well they asked who but who do you say that i am and simon peter said thou art the christ so it's all about revelation and then jesus says listen thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you so so the culture or the or the all the um you know gossip or what people said about me that that didn't reveal to you who i was but my father in heaven has revealed this to you so it's divine revelation upon this rock right the divine revelation of who jesus christ is i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so this is this is god's pattern he takes the people and he builds upon the divine revelation of who he is in their season man because he's the same yesterday today and forever and he is his word and those people who are built upon the divine revelation of who jesus christ is amen not was is right now amen that is the church that god has built and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them and they've been given power to bind things upon earth and they'll be bound in heaven and whatever they are loose on earth it shall be loosed in heaven so this is the divine the church is built upon divine revelation who's following me so far i mean so if god has revealed to you who he is in this season you're a very blessed person amen amen money didn't give it to you you're in selective it didn't give it to you your family didn't give it to you god gave it to you yes hallelujah and if god is building upon this divine rock of revelation the devil can't kick you off it that's right amen hallelujah now david wood david would speak in in many places and we'll go through them where he would attribute god as his rock because remember david was anointed by that same prophet samuel that that that raised up um the ebenezer stone there the rock of help you know he was anointed by that same vindicated prophet and that same prophet anointed him for the purpose that he was going to sit on the throne he was going to be king of israel that was where david was going to end up and so david went through many hard times in life he would be on the run from saul he would have to go live among the philistines and you know even one time he'd have to act crazy you know before the kingdom just to try and survive and you know he was a fugitive in his own land but yet he had a revelation in his life amen i mean that he was going to be king that he was coming into power and this revelation no matter how bad life got he could always go back to that moment amen where the lord anointed him through the prophet samuel vindicated prophet poured out as a lord of anointing oil upon his head and says the spirit of god i mean yeah yeah the spirit of god was with david from that day on he could always go back to that moment amen and when he would get into the spirit that same god that was there when he was commissioned he was anointed i mean to become king that same god was with him hallelujah and so it didn't matter really how bad situations of life got for david his god amen was a divine revelation to him his god is his rock hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and i friends it doesn't matter how bad life gets or struggles or trials come in amen but we can always go back to that time when the word came upon us hallelujah his anointing came upon us quicken that quickened us to the promise of this hour and he made us new creatures in christ and that is our rock that our life is built upon holy amen amen he would say this in second samuel 22 amen and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer amen she said the lord is my revelation amen he's been divinely revealed to me he's made himself known to me and he's my fortress and my delivery you see when the lord reveals himself to someone amen he becomes not only a you know so so he's the rock that you're built upon but he's also a fortress he's a place of defense hallelujah and he's also becomes a deliverer it means remember the god that saved you is going to keep you i mean the god that saved you is going to deliver you out of every fear hallelujah the scripture says that the angel of the lord isn't kept about those who fear him and he delivers them amen there's going to be spots in life where we're going to need deliverance we're gonna need god to come upon the scene but he promised he'll come on the scene and then he'll fight our battles and he will deliver us amen what a god we serve hallelujah amen amen the the god of my rock and him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my savior thou saveth me from violence i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from my enemies the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation so amen blessed be my revelation that the lord's imparted to me remember if if god gave it the world can't take it away amen because the world didn't give this to us friends it wasn't someone who who explained you into i mean the message of the hour it was the lord jesus christ revealed himself personally to you amen so he is my rock and exalted be the god of the revelation of my salvation you see if god reveals himself to you and i it makes us act different it makes us conduct ourselves differently it makes us be a different kind of people because we realize we're not from this terra firma we're not from this world we're from another world and we're just passing through this world but we're going to leave and go amen we can say we came from god and we go back to god hallelujah hallelujah that should be our revelation amen they should be anchored in our heart now remember the lord all right let's just keep reading here i don't want to get ahead of myself and now we drop down to verse 47 of second samuel 22 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation it is god that avengeth me and it bringeth down the people under me and that bringeth me forth from my enemies thou also has lifted up my uh lifted me up on high above them that rose against me thou has delivered me from the violent man amen that's what revelation does yeah i mean it lifts us up that we realize that we are not subject anymore to the devil and to his works and to his schemes and to his devices but we've been lifted up into heavenly places in christ jesus amen far above all principality and power and his spiritual wickedness it works in high places and that's what revelation does it lifts us up i mean changes us that we realize hey we're not subject to the devil anymore we're not subject to our past anymore we're not subject to this flesh anymore amen we are subject to the spirit of god that dwells within us amen hallelujah amen if you can you know if that anchors into our heart you can say satan back off in the name of jesus christ get out of here you don't belong here you're not welcome here get out in the name of jesus christ and he has to obey you amen amen psalm 61 and 1 hear my cry oh lord attendant to my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i am amen for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in thy tabernacle forever i will trust in the covet of thy wings sealer see i think i said it a few sundays ago but i just want to repeat it you know god knew that our hearts our emotions would get overwhelmed by situations in life where it seems too much and we can't bear it no more and you know things just get too overwhelming amen he knew that that that this would happen to us because he knows how we're built yeah yeah amen mean he doesn't hold our humanity against us he knows exactly how we're built he knows sometimes our emotions will just become too much the situation will get too much grief will become too much anxiety will become too much worry can become too much but we have a place of safety that we can go i mean that will give us a stability in the trial and i believe this is what david's speaking about here he says when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i lead me to the revelation oh god of who i am and you and who you are amen that is higher than my natural circumstances amen so when our hearts get overwhelmed we can be lead to a revelation that's already in our hearts i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god all things work together for good that love god and are called according to his purpose and the bride very much fits that scripture amen we love him and we're called according to his purpose which is we're going to go on a rapture that's his purpose in this hour hallelujah i mean so so when our hearts get overwhelmed we can be led we say lord lead me i mean bring that revelation back to me i mean where it's not my five senses governing my decisions and and and and how i'm conducting myself but maybe who i am and you lord bring it back to my remembrance oh god show me who i am in you once again i mean that when that you know so when our hearts get overwhelmed we can be led to a place hallelujah a place of stability a place of a firm foundation amen that that that our hearts don't overwhelm us no more but we come to a place of rest even in the storm who's following me today aren't you glad you have that rock amen here's our rock our god is our rock of revelation hallelujah praise the lord now brother brown would say this in in the spiritual adoption message now he's talking about going back to matthew 16 there where where jesus is speaking to to his disciples there he says upon this rock i'll build my church now and i say unto thee thou art peter now we know peter means little rock i am the great rock i am the cornerstone there's jesus speaking but you are the little rock that's placed upon me the builders chose you now this should give us a real a real good uh peace in this time i mean the builders chose you you never chose yourself i mean the builders chose you the angel of god one night working in the quarry called you out and you submitted yourself to me this is talking about us amen we never chose ourselves to be believers god chose us to be believers i mean because because the scripture says it's not that him that willeth or him that runeth but god that shows mercy it's god that calls i mean it's god that elects amen as god buys full knowledge looks down through time and sees us i mean as his children it is god that does the calling it's god that does the saving it's god that does the keeping i'm so glad it's that way amen amen so he says that the hallelujah the angel of god one night working in the quarry called you out i mean so we're all in this big you can say this big mountain of humanity but god in his wisdom came down and he saw you in that big mountain of humanity and cut you out by his word and chopped you and shaped you and because he wanted to take you from that mound and put you into a building hallelujah into the temple of the living god hallelujah amen amen and i cut you and you submitted yourself to me and i catch you uh in my own fashion i made you the way i wanted you to be see we friends we're gonna stop wrestling with who god made us to be yeah some of us are boisterous some of us are quiet some of us are in between some of us are forward some of us are backward so it's a bashful some of us are not bashful god made us that way amen hallelujah remember this is not you know god god you know he said you know brother ram says that the bride is a bouquet of flowers a good bouquet has a lot of different kind of flowers big ones small ones bright ones not bright ones the greenery around the side you know i don't really i'm not a florist but you know what i mean like you said right a good a good bouquet has a lot of you know different kind of flowers it's like us we're all we're all different but as long as god put me in the bouquet i can just be a little bit of greenery on the bottom i don't mind i just want to be in the bouquet amen now see i made you the way that i wanted you to be i done the soaring you just stood still hallelujah and i've placed you now as a little stone to fit in with some other stone to lead that stone and this stone leads to that stone and that stone and the cement of love is bringing you together making the foundation which i am to be fitted together with every stone that professes my name and receives this revelation we know faith is a revelation revelation faith is a revelation it's it's revealed to you and it's one thing we should pray for more for anything especially at this time is for divine revelation yes right lord reveal to us remember i think i think this lockdown is is good because it's kind of maybe kind of pinched us a little bit to realize life is not just going to go on that's right you know there's a new normal there's another new normal then there's another new normal and things just keep changing but we don't want to be complacent in this hour we don't just want to float by we say lord open our eyes in a greater way reveal to us who we are on you and who you are make the world more alive to be lord make it more amen uh more wonderful hallelujah make it more living yeah no it is now it's a revelation for revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to that uh sorry to what has been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body and he says this in spiritual adoption and upon this rock the revelation of god that'll stand still and be cut the stone by the revelation i'll build my church and all the gates of hell shall not prevail against it showing that surely all the gates of hell would be against it but it shall never prevail amen he says this and may i take this moment to say this my friend that the entire church the living god is built solemnly upon the spiritual revelation of the lord jesus christ no matter how educated you are how smart you are how well you may think you know the bible satan knows it just a lot better than you do but only through the revelation god god through the holy spirit your tutor revealed it to you that he saved you by his grace amen so it's only through revelation now you say well then therefore i'm just going to sit back and god will pour it in when he wants to and no no him that seeketh findeth him that knocketh it shall be opened right you got to believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hallelujah so you know if we realize it's god that reveals it to us we say lord reveal it to me here i am oh god open open my heart lord jesus may may the world not come in and choke out the effect effectiveness of your word in my life amen amen amen he would say as well in the church age book as i've already said this book revelation is the consummation of the scriptures it is even placed exactly right in the canon of scripture at the end now you can know that uh no why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it should i would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it is that symbol there is nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word now i want you to just go back in your mind to matthew 16 jesus says and upon this rock i'll build my church so therefore that means there is other rocks right but there's a particular rock of the revelation of who jesus christ is that rock is the church is the rock that the church is built upon the revelation of who he is now jesus would give the parable of the wise and the foolish man the the foolish man built his house upon sand now i remember from brother isaac preached that um message on sand a few years ago that sand is actually just rock that's been crushed down to powder right if you if you reverse the process you have a whole rock but if you crush it down it's it's it's a whole bunch of small rocks that's just now what we call sand so now he said the foolish man built his house upon the sand now we know that sand is man's reasoning right it's just shifting sands it just moves with moves with the wind you know it's you know that you know it has no firm firm foundation i mean when storms come um jesus said that when the storms came the house was built upon the sand fell down and great was the loss of the house but he said a wise man digs down until he hits rock i mean so he's not just willing to walk with god i mean because it's a nice idea and someone else told them that or you know you know this is what everyone else is doing and these are nice people it goes beyond that but they you know a real believer will dig down through through the sand oh this is an idea and well i'm a good person i've done nothing wrong therefore the lord's got to accept me and look at you know my upbringing and different things you know that's all man's reasoning there's nothing we can give to god to earn salvation amen i mean there's nothing jesus paid it all that day on calvary i mean it's a very important revelation to have that the blood has cleansed us from all sin amen that we are free we've been loosed amen from sin by the power of the blood amen hallelujah and then so now so the wise man digs down through all religious reasoning until he hits the revelation of god's word and then he just pushes that out and he builds his house there yes and then the lord says that those storms may come and go that house is gonna stand amen amen so now storms are gonna come right there's gonna be winds there's going to be storms there's going to be rain there's going to be typhoons monsoons hurricanes however you want to stay at cyclones and you know all those things happening but you know so there's going to be good points in life and bad points in life hard points in life but but a house that's built upon the rock of revelation of who jesus christ is it's going to stand you can see it in david's life when he's there at ziglag and the amalekites have come in and taken all his family away and taken his men's family away and even as men got to the point where they were consenting to stone david but says but david encouraged himself in the lord why because he had a rock that his life was built upon the revelation of who you know jesus christ was or god was to him in that day hallelujah but if his if his life was built upon shifting sands of just reasoning well i could be a good king i could do it better than saul look i'm from bethlehem i'm from a noble house here you know uh everyone likes me you know i've got an influence over the people and you know we can you know i can sing better than saul i can create music and i can you know i can minister this kind of way and you know but if it's all reasoning if it was only reasoning in david's life then he would have fallen apart at ziggler true but because his life was built upon the divine revelation i'm going to the throne no matter what comes amen he could stand there and he could go to the rock because he encouraged himself in the lord his god amen and we know the rest of the story don't we god gave him instructions go pursue and you'll recover all amen hallelujah and they did it i'm so glad for that yes amen so there's nothing such as prevailing power as a revelation of the world why because it's the gates amen i mean sorry it's the rock that the church is built upon now if we go to second samuel i'm just gonna i'm just gonna keep reading from david here second samuel 22 and 29 for thou art my lamp oh lord and the lord will lighten my darkness for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall as for god he his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god god is my strength and power he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hein's feet and sitteth me upon my high places he teacheth my hands to war so that above steel shall be broken in my arms thou hast also given me the shield of my salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great and then in verse 47 and the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation it is god that avengeth me that bringeth down the people under me and that bringeth me forth from my enemies thou also has lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou has delivered me from the violent man therefore i give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen will i sing praises unto thy name he is the tower of salvation for his king enjoys mercy to his anointed unto david and to his seed more then psalms 62 1 a psalm of david truly my soul waited upon god for he cometh from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not greatly be moved how long will he imagine mischief against a man you shall be slain you shall be sorry ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be in as a totaling fence thou they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless from their mouth but they curse inwardly selah my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength my refuge isn't god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sealer i mean so i mean so and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength is the revelation of my strength and my refuge is in god hallelujah see david knew that god was his rock amen east brother brown says in the message shalom now if you noticed in the scripture reading here in psalms it kept saying god is my rock do you know that a rock represents in the bible what it represents a rock in the bible represents the revelation of god see god is my revelation he is see the entire the revelation of the word is the rock he says i like the way david speaks that the rock you notice so many times god is my rock you know what a rock is referred to in the bible a rock is a revelation like peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god he said blessed are thou simon son of jonas and upon this rock this revelation god revealed it to me flesh and blood never revealed this but my father which is in heaven upon this rock this revelation i'll build my church and david here crying out god is my rock my revelation hallelujah now it's very important now as i was saying in the beginning when when israel was at mizpah there and god fought their battle discomforted the philistines he had already done that before and god was already one who fought the people's battles right he was always he was already that way but it had to be revealed to them they had to yeah they it had to be made known to them that god could fight their battles and he still did because god doesn't change there's got to be the same thing with you and i the lord i trust will drop into our hearts god fights our battle i mean he's already defeated the devil that down calvary satan doesn't have the own keys to his own house right he's a completely defeated being he's nothing but a bluff but may it be lord reveal that to us amen that we know in our hearts the devil's defeated right that we know in our hearts that victory is certain because if we realize or if we have the revelation that victory is certain hallelujah we're going to press the battle and then we're not going to wonder does the word work we know it works yes sir amen we know god is victorious amen brother braham said in spiritual adoption he says if he will reveal to you this morning by the revelation that this is the end of your suffering this is the end of your sickness all devils out of torment will never shake that foundation though every doctor says it's wrong for upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell cannot prevail against it though it would be against it yet it cannot prevail for when the enemy comes unlike a flood the spirit of god will raise a standard against it every time you see it you get it now jesus being revealed to his disciples so if we could just reveal you know if the lord could just reveal to us by revelation this is the season of the end of our suffering right this is the end of the season of unbelief spirits that fight against us amen unbelief that comes against this worry and strife that now is the season addiction whether it's drugs or alcohol whatever it may be amen could be that it could be anything anything that hinders your walk bound you down this is the time amen god is here to reveal to us that this is the end of our suffering where the lord has come i mean to give us a full restoration a full deliverance amen from our past from our flesh from from spirits to maybe travel down the family line wherever it may be this if if the lord could just reveal to us this is the season of the end of all of our sufferings not just physical sickness i mean but spiritual things that bother us amen but now god is present i mean to deliver us you know we don't have to stay bound amen well you know things fight against us but if if the law could just drop into our hearts actually no no the lord's taking care of it all he's already defeated that devil that down calvary and god proved himself in this this hour that we live i mean he proved to us that he has defeated everything and there's nothing that can be named that our lord has not defeated amen he defeated cancer he defeated all seconds i mean i love it where where lazarus was four days in the grave you know i think of people can have uh you know permanent effects you know from sickness you know i was thinking about little abigail you know how they're saying you know because that autoimmune disease that you know um you know was fighting her brain and you know and and and the doctors were saying well you know you can you know um you know they were telling susannah and emerson you know she may never become normal again but i was thinking when all this was going on you know lazarus was brain was bit was what was already rotten he was four days in the grave this is how bad that condition was you know his brain was four days rotten in the grave the noses sunken eyes had gone and yeah the body was already decaying but the resurrection in the life stood to his tomb and called him by name and we know that if jesus did not call lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection anybody said lazarus come forth and a man whose body was rotten four days in the grave came out healthy normal and well he had no side effects he didn't have any lingering effects of being dead in his body rotten his mental faculties were fully restored his immune system fully restored his body fully all the organs everything he could see he could hear he could speak he could reason now fully restored hallelujah so if if god can do that if our lord jesus can do that for a man who is dead in the grave four days how much more a person who's alive almighty that maybe just being in the hospital or the other thing about abigail they say your brain is you know might never recover but you know they're expecting a full recovery now amen this is the doctors we always believed in a full recovery dropped into brother emerson's heart early in the trial he says they'll you know we're going to smite this thing with the arab guys deliver until it's totally destroyed so you know and now of course abby's home and well and amen so we praise the lord for that but you know you think about there's no situation in life amen where well in my opinion that is too far nothing is too hard for the lord nothing is too hard there's nothing too impossible he doesn't have a hard basket he doesn't procrastinate because something's too difficult to do there's nothing too difficult to the lord and if god could just drop it in our hearts that he's already provided i mean deliverance and healing and salvation not just for ourselves but for our family i mean he's already released through the power of his word all power to deliver sickness and heal and cast out devils you know you know in the church of the living god this morning is is the power to heal all the sick to raise the dead aiming to cast out the devil aiming to bring peace aiming to cast out anxiety and worry and unbelief and troubling spirits and addiction in the church the living god right now lays that power yes hallelujah if god is in you amen that power is in you right let's just not just have it in some kind of abstract way of the church you got to say no it's in me and me amen that same one that conquered hell there in the grave and conquered all things is now living in me hallelujah so i pray this morning if god could just reveal to us amen that he has already conquered all sickness and this is the season of the end of our suffering amen amen david would say uh this is in um this is in psalms 119 verse 18. he says open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law so david's praying now this is david is a man after god's own heart we know and david is asking lord open my eyes and and and that word open actually means to actually take off a covering unveil my eyes lord that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law so it's not like david couldn't read the law you know he had the first you know he had the law of moses but david's looking lord revealed the wondrous things out of the lord reveal the supernatural things reveal the mysterious things reveal the high things lord jesus this was this is his cry and it should be the same cry for us lord amen open my eyes lord that this open book that we have received this word that's come open in this hour lord reveal the wondrous things out of it hallelujah reveal i mean reveal who i really am amen that because remember we're living in a day that we would know as we are knowing hallelujah this is the other that we would know so so we would know as god knows us so as god thinks of us we would think about ourselves the same way yeah i mean so if he knows us as his beloved hallelujah then that revelation will come into our hearts i am my i my beloved's beloved amen hallelujah you know if he looks at us as sinless virtuous the bride of jesus christ made in his image the image of the word amen the god god made flesh and a people i mean overcoming i mean made to you know made to sinners throne as he sat down overcame and sat down at his father's throne amen if you know if that's how we are known then lord jesus may we know as we are known amen hallelujah because many people you know they they they wrestle with the fact does god love me and you know or or when i get to the other side is he going to be pleased with me well i just want to say this you know god is looking god is looking for people who will receive him amen this is what god's looking for and many times we you know we don't want to beat ourselves up on what we think is our performance i think if we you know serve the lord let serve the lord with our whole hearts amen right but he's looking for people that will receive him hallelujah and so now if we have received and you think about why is he why is he quickened us in this hour why has he made us alive in him have you ever thought about you know there's a purpose every season or every yeah every season there's a people that god has sent to the earth to fulfill the promised word of that hour right so moses was there to fulfill the deliverance out of egypt joshua is there after moses aiming to bring the people into the promised land samuel was there to anoint saul and then david to be king david was there to become king over israel to have solomon solomon was there to build the temple now it's very easy to look back and say yes these ones were there and they fulfilled god's word nehemiah and ezra were there to rebuild jerusalem and the temple you know you know john the baptist was there to forerun the lord jesus christ the lord was there to redeem all of humanity as god and flesh the apostles were there and mean to to to take the gospel into into all nations right you know we know these things you know looking backwards and say well of course the apostle paul ran his race and you know he you know you know he did that which was pleasing to god he had that crown of life look at all the things he did but you know he fulfilled his portion yeah and i believe if we're fully surrendered to god we will fulfill our portion amen and what is god looking for he's looking for people that love him that serve him they give their whole life to him that everything that that his choices amen are their choices that their choices aren't theirs but their choices are his choices lord what would you have me do in this hour is this pleasing to you you know it's not so it's not based on our merit of of what we've done for him it's those that can receive him look at the woman at the well she was lost and undone she wasn't even welcome in her society she had to come to the well at a time when the other woman didn't come to the well but she had something in her brother brown says she had representation in heaven and the very reason she had representation in heaven was the fact that when the messiah came and jesus began to discern her life and say go get your husband she says i have none and you know he says you've spoke you know you've told me the truth you've had you've had five and the one you're with us not yours you know she said you know we know we know where messiah comes he will do all these things and she just did i mean he just said to her i am the messiah he that speaks to thee am he now she didn't have to sit down for a big five hour discussion of how that works she just believed it hey man he dropped her water pot she ran into the sea the brother graham says the reason that she could do that is because she had representation in heaven yeah i mean the scrubs and pharisees they they heard the same kind of words they saw jesus do the same kind of things but they called him beelzebub they rejected him because they had no representation in heaven so the very reason that we receive well the very fact that we receive the word shows us i trust it does i mean it's transformed our life shows us that we have representation in heaven now what is that representation in heaven that is our theophany our eternal body waiting for us up in glory when the apostle paul would say you know the if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved i have one waiting in heaven already eternal in the heavens amen so now god you think about it if i have representation in heaven god can't change that representation amen right he can't take my theophany because what i've done here on this earth and you know i've disappointed him whatever more take that theophany make it nothing and then i'm not going to get there no he already made up his mind he has so many wedding garments that he's going to dress people in if i can put it that way right he has every place at the wedding supper feast and then he knows he's going to sit at the table and the reason that we've responded to him in this hour and we've given our lives and he's transformed us as proof as evidence that we have a place in that wedding's upper table that we have representation in heaven amen if his holy ghost has come into your life change your nature the things you once did you don't do no more you become a new creature in christ the things you love you used to love you can't stomach anymore you hate them you can't do them and the things you would never used to do now you do and you love amen what's happened and and and who did it god did it yes it wasn't you that did it and there's god that did it many people try and do it but that's just being but that's just their life being built on sands of man's ideas though they may be good ideas but those who we're god has really come and transformed their life and made them where they begin to read the scripture and they begin to see actually my life is a fulfillment of that scripture i mean i can turn the other cheek i can let go of past hurts you know i can't forgive i mean i can't pray for those who despitefully use me i can't love the unlovable hallelujah you know i can't turn the other cheek i can forgive i mean i can intercede i can accept a genuine love for lost and dying world hallelujah you know those kind of people god has transformed their lives amen and god's actually changed them and what does that show you have representation in heaven amen and god can't give that representation hallelujah that's a good rock to be built upon amen amen when this world was falling apart you say no no i'm built i'm in my god is my rock he's my revelation hallelujah praise our god has he done a work in your life hey hallelujah and if he's done started to work hey i'd start confessing it yes sir amen member because he's the high priest of our profession hallelujah he can only work that means he can only work as we profess his word yes lord right hallelujah if you professor you're backslidden you'll be backslidden right if you profess i'm an overcomer and god's going to see me through this you're going to overcome hallelujah if you profess that the blood has cleansed you amen the reality of it will come into your life yes sir hallelujah isn't that right yes it's right praise our god i'm beginning to feel religious amen hallelujah so it's the so he said now um open david again he says open thou mine eyes that i may behold the wondrous things out of thy law so he's saying so those things that david wanted to behold they were already in the law but he was praying god would open them make them real to him right and it should be i trust the same thing with us because you know in this word is a body change amen and this word is salvation and this word is deliverous now if i had the message i just put it together because we know the message reveals christ in the scripture right it's not in another book and reveals jesus christ in here in here is the dead in christ coming out if it's revealed not just ink on paper now i'm talking about when it's divinely revealed into the believer's life hallelujah so it's like lord open my eyes that i'll see wondrous things in your word praise our god amen we have so many things you know brother and says we should be like prospectors amen we should be we should be looking down through the scripture for nuggets you know we should be prospecting and you know there's a lot of mines around the world i know i think in the johannesburg region that what's happened is as as they you know they do mining but then what happens is all the tailings and all the all the rock and stuff that they think there's no value of them and yes they make big heaps of it but then what happens is technology gets better then they go back through the tailings they go back through those which was just a rubbish dump and they remind that and they get all the precious things out so maybe some things you know you say well i've already mined through the scripture i've already mined through the message you know i've you know i've read it all i've seen it all i'll say no go back through what you call tailings yeah because what you call tailings there's there's gold in there oh yeah and then there's precious metals on there i can say there's rare earth metals in there i mean there's things of great value in there i mean we should dig back through because you'll find that the things that you just placed on the shelf or place to one side saying oh there's no value in that because of this you'll find i mean there's greater riches than you can even fathom amen hallelujah it'll make you spiritually a very rich man or woman if it's received in revelation now zechariah is um is speaking here in zechariah 4 1 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see it thou i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top they're off and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side thereof now you can keep reading down but we won't just to save time but heroes here is zechariah this is how the believer you know can be whereas asleep but yet there's all these things around us and the angel lord needs to come and wake us up out of the sleep to recognize what's already there you see many times it's not us you know we already have victory yeah we have total deliverance yes amen we have total victory but the lord needs to open our eyes to make us cause us to realize we have it yeah you follow me this is what we need is is for the lord and this is what we should pray for lord reveal to me who i am in you right reveal to me who i am and you that i will see where you've placed me because if you think about we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and that is a position of power and authority that by i say the new birth god quickening us he places us up in that position but many times i say lord help us that we would actually our eyes would come open that we would realize we're already seated in a place of power and authority over every devil over every sickness over every trend in society over everything that would sway us left and right and catch our attention and you know everything that would make us feel cold look warm and powerless we already have we're already in a position i mean to overcome all those things but lord open our eyes that we would see where we are remember zechariah was there but he was like in a dream but the angel lord had to come down and wake him up and then the then the angel began to ask him what do you see now i heard um brother wayne lawson he was preaching in um there in canada cloverdale camp it was tremendous i think i had it last weekend but he but he made a very um uh very astounding statement he said there's a big difference if i can get this right uh there's a big difference between looking for something and actually and actually finding it and seeing it for what it is see many people are looking for something they think there's some great big revival you know that's going to happen or you know oh there's the bride's revival and god's going to do incredible things and you know oh we you know we need something to come to make it happen that's looking for something but why you know but there's a big difference for looking for it to actually realizing it's already here and seeing it right we are living in a time you think about what god has done in the sound he's revealed himself in his fullness remember brother braham says that the opening of the seals reveals christ right the the seals have come off the book so now we're not wondering who we are anymore we know who we are we know who our god is we know what he's done i mean we've seen the full power of of of the blood being manifested in this hour hallelujah amen we know where we're going we know where we came from glory amen you know the lord has spiritually revealed this to us so but the thing is now if we're looking for something else you're gonna you know i'll go into this later maybe maybe another service but yeah i've been trying i've been i mean want to get into um where the former and the li formula and the latter rain run together in the end time and and we know you know i just want to say that's already happening amen because if we need someone else to come remember revelation is given the highest order that revelation is given through is through a vindicated prophet it's not through a bible school it's not through man's ideas it's a waste or a prophet amos 3 7 says the lord will do nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophets and if you don't study through the study through the new testament you see that there are still prophets even into today and it says the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be finished as he declares to his servants the prophets and we know we've already received that prophet to reveal the full word of god back to us again yes we're not looking for another one to come to open the book to us we've already had one come he's opened the book revealed jesus christ so now everything that has been promised to the bride is already here it's already here right rapturing faith is here quickening power is here amen the power to raise the dead from the grave is here the power to change these bodies is already within the believer amen overcoming power is here the bride's revival is here hallelujah those things are already here the former ladder rain running together to quicken the people i mean it's already here yes right now are you following me yes it's already here the thing is i say god and now i'm probably talking to myself more than anything god open my eyes amen that i would see in full clarity where we are right now amen because it's already here just like zechariah was asleep but all those things were around him but the angel had to come and awaken him up that he would see the candlesticks and different things going on i pray oh god may your great holy angel come may may the angel of your presence come to each one of us open our eyes mean that we would see where we are amen that you are our rock of revelation amen that that you have come to quicken us i mean that that these bodies would be changed amen all former latter reign are falling the bride's revival is going on amen that god is already here to pour himself out amen he yes he's in hosea sorry maybe i've been pondering it you know well i've been pondering off and on but he said hosea that he will come to you amen in that former ladder reigns just the lord himself coming to a people you know on the seventh seal brother braham says that yeah you know the seventh seal is actually christ himself yes yeah right it's actually christ himself the seventh seal now we know some people think that the seals are in a um what do you call it a um chronological order where it's the first and the second third and fourth and you know and and sure the first four that way but the others kind of overlapping different things but you know the seventh seal is christ himself where jesus himself showed the seven seals in in matthew chapter 24 and he actually lays out the first one to six but for the seventh he says but when the son of man no man knoweth the hour when the son of man will come again and that's actually the seventh seal why see it's the lord coming down and as you know as that mighty angel with the open book i mean to make himself one with the bride of christ amen now brother and says about the seventh seal he says it's like a firecracker or firework going off you know a fight finger goes off and when a bit fires off and explodes and another bit fires off and it explodes another bit far up faster explodes he says it's the end of all things it's a cycle where the end of all things is happening so now what's going to happen first well you know um the church edge is going to end that that fires them you know cracker and blows off then yeah yeah then the next thing is the millennium sets in but that's a space of time and then eventually that's going to fire it's going to blow it's going to be done and there's going to be the white throne judgment different things and eternity's going to roll on so it's actually now we're living in a cycle of the end of suffering nature of the end of suffering humanity it's the end of sickness it's the end of sorrow and pain we're actually in a cycle where these things are going to come to an end it's an end of time right we're actually in that cycle who's who's with me just now right now hallelujah so now if that has already happened oh i mean you'd say rather if that is in progress of happening then the first thing that needs to happen is actually it anchors into our hearts the revelation amen that now is the end of our suffering we don't have to be we don't have to serve the devil no more i mean we don't have to be under his bondage no more we don't have to put up with family spirits or you know cultural spirits or unbelief or pain or hurt or our past or we don't those things aren't meant to rule us we're meant for them right those things are meant to be under our feet than every devil in hell amen it's not meant to rule us but we meant to put it under our feet now is the season of the end of the cycle of of humanity living under the curse of the devil all right hallelujah but what it does is as as one cycle ends another one begins right so now if we can take when it comes to time as time comes to an end eternity begins to roll along so it's a cycle where time begins to end but eternity now is actually overlapping with time and then now eternity is going to roll on and time ends now we're living in a time where we're the cycle of pain or even revival and death you know these things that hold us down now is the season where it's coming to an end but i pray and and i'm just gonna i'm gonna wrap it up with this but i pray that the lord would reveal to us that all those things have been defeated hallelujah defeated sickness has been defeated complexes have been defeated hallelujah spirits that hang around and trouble us we don't have to put up with them anymore hallelujah we don't have to put up with those things the lord has come not physically but you know his word is here amen to break every cycle generational problems they've come to an end you don't have to put up with them anymore you know there was a season where israel had to put up with being beaten in egypt there was a season they ruined they couldn't help it they were stuck in this way but then god came down hallelujah and they were liberated by the power of god and now they they didn't have to be beaten by slave masters anymore but they were free from them they were living in a different season hallelujah they were the same people but they're in a different season you know there were seasons where israel was like the philistines would afflict them or the or the midianites of different ones but then the season changed where they they didn't have to be under the bondage of those people no more but they were now free in their own land and it's the same thing with you and i israel many times if you read through the book of judges in different places they were in their land they were living in the promise but they weren't living according to the promise they were they reflected by the midianites or the philistines of different ones but they called upon god and god broke that season that they didn't have to be slave ma yo yo in in slavery no more amen hallelujah we're living in our friends we've got us here to give a full liberation yes and we don't and if we could just realize that our lives are built upon divine revelation that god has now don't look at your present condition and the things that you're wrestling with don't look at those things look at what god has made real to you hallelujah because that's your rock right because here's our rock of revelation and if we can just look at those things instead of looking at you know trouble in here things that bother us physical conditions if we can look at who our god is of divine revelation then the lord can come and fight our battles you know you realize you're a son of god it does something to you doesn't it you realize you're doing it to you

it's not any affliction not any trouble that rules us but we rule it you begin to realize that i mean that you're not just another kind of a person upon the earth but you've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb where where the angel gabriel said to mary all said to joseph you shall call his name jesus for he so he shall save his people from their sins and you begin to realize i'm one of his people because i've been saved i've been delivered from my sins hallelujah amen has come into effect in my life i'm a new creature hey that does something for you doesn't it i mean it really does something for you that the lord is not gonna you know the rapture cycle is not gonna finish and we're gonna be stuck here it does something for you when you realize that you're part of that rapture cycle i mean you're part of the dead in christ rising because you're going to be transformed with them and you're going to meet the lord in the air together it does something for you it does something for you when you realize that you know you don't have to go through a great tribulation you don't have to stand through you know you stand before a white throne judgment why because he took our judgment that day on calvary he took the fullness of our judgment amen and now we are we have been judged guiltless because he took our judgment that damn calvary and we're gonna rule and reign with him and where and the saints will judge the earth it does something for us doesn't it all right let you do something real good for you you realize we are the sons and daughters of god and jesus said

revelation in there that we desire to want to enter in because it's free to everyone to enter in but not everyone go everyone goes there but the the fact that we've been granted access to to fellowship with almighty god that revelation to be able to just go back there i was i thought this is this is the grandest thing ever for a mortal man this is a this is a pinnacle of man's existence
