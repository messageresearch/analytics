========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] welcome back to church everyone I mean it's good to be back I mean and you know I think I think one of the one of the reasons why the Lord has blessed our fellowship here is that it hasn't really taken a hiatus away from church for all of us to really appreciate Church I think we appreciated it before this and we appreciate it after this you know it's not suddenly like well I didn't realize how great church was although we we think about more like that we didn't I don't think we as a fellowship left a net beforehand you know in and and you know when you've got that sort of attitude that's when the Lord can really bless but that being said it's nice to be back streaming doesn't quite do it but I don't know that it will catch on you know the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as a romantic manner of summer's and even more as you see the Day approaching and and you know we've got we've got a spirit in us and around us that that that you can't really feel over the digital medium you know we're a spirit and when we gather together the the warmth that is the Holy Ghost in our lives we all come together and it creates an atmosphere and it creates a warm atmosphere a friendly warm atmosphere you know when you go in places where it's cold where where there's a lot of death you know there's no life than each person's spirit the atmosphere it feels really cold but you know in a fellowship you come together like this and it's the opposite you know and as you sing the songs and that the word comes and things and as the day goes on there the atmosphere gets warmer and warmer it's like I was trying to dry all these boots close to the fire last night it's a fun little project cuz you sort of move them all and you do this and it and but it's kind of like as they all get warmer they kind of just get warmer or warmer they've all the insides warm up and even when you're moving them around they're all kinda they go faster and faster because they're getting warmer it's kind of like when you're cooking food to you know brother nd after a while you everything in your pan is really hot and it's just gets hotter and hotter but that then that's what it is like amongst us you know as we fellowship that the atmosphere gets more so let's um let's just stand and we'll just come up the service to the Lord and then I've just got a few little things I have to notice as an N we'll begin worship heavenly father we're so grateful Lord that we can gather back here again Lord with saints of like precious faith and we appreciate the means that we have to be able to do this Lord and as I said earlier Lord I believe that any one of our hearts we always did Lord and I thank you that that each person here is sincere and loves you Lord and lost fellowship Lord an end and we want to gather in this place together so that we enjoy meeting each other we enjoy meeting the Christ in each other and on but moreso Lord we would like to meet you this morning Lord Jesus and have your spirit dwell amongst us Lord and work in our lives and touch us in a way that only you can Lord Jesus Lord so we are so thankful to be here was so thankful this opportunity well may we lay hold upon it lay hold upon this opportunity and and just put our minds in an atmosphere where you can work Lord may we put off any thoughts that would hinder the direction of leading towards you maybe just put those thoughts aside Lord may we enter into worship enter into the ministry may bless our day bless our fellowship Lord forgive us of every Sun we've committed Lord and we just come boldly before your throne of grace this morning Lord knowing that we have a faithful high priest Lord that that can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities Lord we don't have a foreign God that doesn't understand but you were made like unto us Lord of the seed of Abraham as a human Lord to understand what we go through and we just thank you that asset Almighty God that we meet this morning Lord and the and the holiest of holies Lord say we just want to come up the service to you we just thank you so much Lord for this time we can gather once again we just commit ourselves to you in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord I can't say this on live ado let's give the Lord give I don't know if we can do the whole shake touch but you can give everyone in it an elbow a mean so we've yet I just have to run through a few things we've got the signer net that brother cube in a different ones would have given you at the door there so brother cube in see if maybe they might send you little things so maybe switch your phones on silent if you haven't already and these hand sanitiser by the front door there as well brother there were there was a we're having a little vote and I think brother kuben has already picked up most of your little um yes or no papers so that that would be done there's a lunch afterwards and then we have a at 3:30 we're going to aim for a service back here at 3:30 um yeah but it will be most of us would be at the fellowship there so we'll know when it's going to be on and I think that's all thought I missed anything brother bin did I get over yeah I think I'd like to get these things out of the way first because it's kind of disruptive when you put them when you're in worship you don't really feel like talking about hand sanitizer or anything like that doesn't seem to fit the atmosphere praise the Lord who loves the Lord this morning amen it's very nice to see all your faces it is very nice and I really I really appreciate this fellowship and I really appreciate the every person in it that do their different roles and I appreciate brother Ben as a our pastor that the the labor of love and his wife that they put in and and everyone else that there over the years have come in and just found their their place than the body and faithfully Serbs week after week to help everybody else out you know and and to help us all out on our journey you know I wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for this fellowship I wouldn't be where I am if it wasn't for this fellowship and and the fellowship is not the hardware but it's the it's the people you know it's each different one and you have all blessed my life and different ways and and my family's life so I really appreciate that and I think each person could say the same about each other that we've all blessed each other as we just surrender ourselves to the Lord and let the Lord move through our life and minister through us and I believe is us eight years who's here right right way way back at the beginning will you hear sister Christine I think it was um I'm gonna get started soon but I know this is quite carnal but one of my nice memories was women were way back in the first church that used to leak everywhere we use if they have the buckets and under different places that leaked in you had to be queue for you didn't sit under a spot like if it wasn't raining the buckets were going in it will start raining and you get dripped on a certain dish in the last like there's quite kind of what I used to say I said I liked after church we always have fish and chips you remember that we used to go to they that yeah I can't really do that as much these days a little bit older but um but we were every Sunday we would always hang there would only be about three or four families but by the Lord's grace each one is coming and it's been a real blessing in it so it's been a really enjoyable journey and as long as we keep the Lord's Center we keep the right attitude we respect our pastor and we respect each other we pretty much won't go wrong you know so we just continue doing what we're doing just loving the Lord I mean so now we're going to get into some worship now we've actually chosen all local songs this morning songs that have with different ones have written over the years so that's what we're going to be

the Lord no we love brother just a Lundy in the family and they mean I mean let's just go - lets go - well I just want to read a scripture from Luke 17 then we're gonna go to revelations 19 but I just want to read this because um this is how I feel Luke 17 verses 11 to 219 I mean I trust everyone's got their um special and everything for this afternoon I mean you know as I said we're here to celebrate life hallelujah Luke 1711 and it's um it's nice to see everyone you know it's it's real nice you know I'm glad I'm glad it's over for us I mean but I trust that through this whole lockdown the Lord's proven himself alive in your own life that it's not it's not four walls that makes him live but it's him and you that makes him live has she had blood makes him live anew amen so this just read here this is this is from Luke 17 verse 11 it says and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers that stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves under the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God hallelujah amen and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine there aren't they there are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto Him arise go thy way thy faith has made the whole I don't wanna just go off and you know I want to come back and give thanks go thanks our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah glory to God amen let's let's now go to revelations 19 and we're going to read here well familiar scripture that we're going to go to revelations 20 and then Matthew 8 so I trust you don't mind standing for a bit I mean I appreciate the songs amen praise the Lord amen the music and the atmosphere and amen revelations 19 6 can you just turn me down a bit on on on these things and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters is a voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth now your voices actually this is a speaking of you this is your voice you're part of this voice I mean let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints talk about you hallelujah and he saith unto me bling I write blessed are they which are called in to the marriage supper of the lamb hello blessed how are you today oh yeah the scripture should be personal I mean we're blessed because we're being called and knowing that we have responded to the call amen and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren and have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy now let us go to revelations chapter 20 and verse 7 just just over the next page I think we should just have a jubilee I think we should just rejoice hallelujah and when the thousand years was expired Satan had shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of Homer's as the sand of the sea and they went up on the Britt's breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the Saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them now I like this verse this this verse 10 I like it and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever you know that feeling that you know when he was cast out of your life I mean that's going to be a feeling that's never gonna range I mean that word caste means he's gonna be thrown Holly he's not gonna willingly go he's gonna be chucked in hallelujah and then just as a bit of a context we're gonna go to Matthew 8 and verse 28 and 29 hallelujah that's why I believe in here we're in revelations 19 hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth glory to God hallelujah you shouldn't be that happy I don't know I can be a lot more happier you know we should be a lot more have Matthew eight and twenty eight and behold of him Matthew 18:21 yes and when he was come yes and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gadarenes I mean I mean good generous sorry there met him two possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceedingly fierce so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus thou son of God now notice these next words art thou come hither to torment us before the time so they know they've got a time of torment coming right thank you and glory let's just say it's a word of pressure Lord Jesus we just come with such Thanksgiving Lord you've washed us white as snow you have made us new creatures we're walking in units of life Lord we don't need to fear nothing about us because you're with us or God you're with us in the boat Lord and we just come to give you glory Lord this truly is as Lord I believe every service every day should be a celebration of life and Lord we're so thankful we can gather Lord together as a people once again to give you praise Lord we know it's more than just having church and slaw we worship you you come down among us father Lord we just want to give you the highest place Lord I pray you'd move on every life this morning laws father lord I just pray you or just touch each life Lord may we may we not forget what you've done for us Lord and what you are doing Lord and where we are going where our enemy is going father we just want to give you glory this day we thank you Lord the Lord you've lightened our paths on this end time but we're not stumbling and darkness wandering and then presuming but we know who we are we know in whom we have believed and we know we were going so father I pray you bless each one here and those who couldn't make it Oh God although I pray you touch their lives as well Loree think of sister Chantal Lord may heal her body father touch of body for your glory bless asterik family Lord oh my Robin Lord Jesus bear Portia bless her as well or brother motto as well or be as portion my god you know announcer streaming and I do not know who but Lord might be like they're here little matter be in your presence my Godfather may not be looking and just just observing but maybe Lord participating father may you granted our God bless each one here Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may you may have your seats this morning amen so I want to if I could title this I want to I want to speak about the devil saying I've seen that look before now we understand that there was a war in heaven you know I love the Bible because it tells us what happened in the beginning what's going to happen in the end you know all the middle bits just really detailed but the main thing is we started in the beginning we and again continue in the end right so you know I think we should just rejoice hallelujah so you know we we we read we read The Devil's end I mean we read that he will be cast into the lake of fire and you know no doubt he must be really panicking about now right you know you know this this this um this uh you know this epidemic has has spread through the world but I believe it's just made the bride stronger I mean it's made her love the Lord more it's made its has made her appreciate I mean the reality of having their sins washed away I mean it actually makes having the token the Holy Ghost in our lives more of a reality I trusted have for you I mean so you know it hasn't stopped earlier as the Apostle Paul would say but the Word of God is not bound Palio so so it hasn't shut us down Amen it's just actually lifted us up because we must remember the Prophet told us that that national pressure will put the churches together in the world constituted national pressure will do it but the power of God will lift the bride off the earth I mean so it's not going to lift this up the best pressure is not gonna lift us up the power of God will this word we have received is going to take us up into glory I mean but if you see everything around the world is being pushed together let's unite let's do this you know but but you know the power of God will take us up in the glory I mean then I trust that you've seen in your own lives the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ I mean in these last few weeks these eight or nine or I know how long it's been since we've seen each other I mean but you've seen the power of God manifested in a greater way you've seen them living your families more I trust you have I mean there's such a reality I mean when we can more than just talked about being under the blood you know and just saying oh you know you've got to be under the blood just like these lights were and you know you know before they left Goshen so I'm trying to slow down you know you know but but it became it to me it became a reality I'm actually I'm not worried about a plague or a pestilence amen spiritual death can't hit me because I'm under the blood hallelujah and I'm safe and secure amen so so we read The Devil's end and he will be cast as like a foreign and as I said before no doubt he must be panicking and we will read actually he has great rest at this time because he knows he has but a short time because you know you gotta think about it he he he stood there if I could just maybe dramatize this a little bit you know he stood there in the Garden of Eden when the first prophecy was spoken and he is actually walked watching God fulfill his word and he keeps fulfilling it and he keeps fulfilling it remember the end says he's gonna burn so he's walking towards his own destruction the devil is so keep singing fulfilled he keeps singer fulfilled he tries to stop a being fulfilled he can't stop living fulfill he keeps he tried to stop Moses he couldn't stop Moses he tried to stop David he couldn't stop David he tried to stop a larger he couldn't stop Elijah he tried to stop the early church he couldn't stop the early church he tried to stop them during the Reformation couldn't stop them during the Reformation tried to stop the bride now can't stop the bride now he cannot stop the bride coming to her position taking a rapture he cannot do it but he tries with all his might but there's such a burning passion in the Bride of Christ hallelujah amen that he cannot stop it and now we're well we're nearly in the concordance in the maps you know yeah pick out something if that was prophesying he can't stop that either and the cover and the cover you know so you know but you know he's the devil is in such a way he can't stop it now you'd think you know people have more sense than him because people actually come to realization I should just quit and try something else you know someone who's actually in their right mind you know when God deals with someone and they're in the right mind if they're really smart they'll just give up and quit and say Lord take my life you're dealing with me Here I am Amen yeah but the devil's made in such a way men because deceived people deceive and the devil is the most deceived being I say person if I use that word and all of creation cause he thinks somehow he can just slip it in in the end and somehow win but newsflash ain't gonna happen because God doesn't know everything but just that one bit and he's gonna see what's gonna happen God knows him from the beginning imagine fighting enemy imagine if we went to war against anyone in the world and when you're exactly real time what they'd be doing what troops I'd have what weapons what they'd be planning imagine you could not that you're you how could you lose a war if he knew exactly no real time no no no like a guess and we think they'll do this and based on our intelligence I'll do this and it can be accurate but imagine real time and he's gonna scratch his head here and he's gonna do this here and the devil's you know you know the enemy is gonna come here with us you'd know exactly how to combat that phone but you think that that enemy is crazy to think he can win that war because because his adversary knows exactly what it's going to do doesn't mean oh I'll try this but but he knows he's going to try that you know and this is how the devil is somehow he thinks he's gonna win but God knows exactly down to the picosecond what he's gonna do what he's thinking hallelujah just like you know you know like the king of Syria was was was getting annoyed during the days of Elijah you know because he had seen troops this way and the Prophet God would tell the king of Israel know they're coming this way go this way and he got so frustrated I've got I've got a spy here what if he's a traitor and and his generals were actually smile with him say no no no they've got a prophet who actually knows the secrets in your bedchamber don't know how the general knew that but but I think he was smart enough so actually nothing he just knows what you're thinking about and your private life and that just goes to show you know God knows everything we're thinking about and God knows what the devil's thinking about hallelujah so so we don't need to worry how God will be right on time doesn't matter how dark it may get all this is a close-run thing no no no no no no huh you know how God likes a bit of drama this is all the great big driver to him brother for him see I mean so you know he likes it to come close mean hallelujah snatch away amen so but the devil thinks he can win but my Bible tells me he cannot win amen and this word has stood the test of time every critic has come against it has been proven wrong I mean this is the Word of God right hallelujah so we don't have to worry we just give God the praise hallelujah amen so so the devil now he thinks he can win now let's read let's go to let's go to Revelation chapter 12 as I said if I could title it I'd say the devil would say oh I've seen that look before hallelujah revelations 12 and we're gonna read from verse 7 I love it I'm on the Lord's side he's not on my side I'm on his side hello there is a big difference now revelations 12 and verse 7 and there was war in heaven this is before there was an earth there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels now I love these next words and prevailed not doesn't say he won or nearly 190 he just lost a mint and prevent neither was there their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out he didn't choose to go he didn't just retreat he was cast out but he throws something oh he cast out oh I need that I mean but you know he didn't know let's make her a treat boys no no no he was cast out even as Jesus would would would tell his disciples when they were commissioned to go cast out Devils Jesus says I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning so as the church was rising in power Satan was being cast out hallelujah amen now which deceiveth the whole world that he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our you the baptism the name of Father Son Holy Ghost is the umbilical cord that ties the people to Rome and they have ceded their ownselves why because the doctrine ties them but we're free people we're free people we've been liberated hallelujah we're are free people this hour a minute this is a message of liberation hallelujah a true liberation you say well all but the devil all that all but this is not for me it is for you it doesn't matter what state you find yourself in what's going on in here just just reject it in the name of Jesus Christ accept your god-given rights I've done too much I've done to this now that's irrelevant hallelujah I mean this is an hour of liberation and we just happen to find ourselves being liberated hallelujah amen so now here he comes Moses into the throne room of Pharaoh and the devil says I've seen that look before why cause now that same one that cast him out of heaven has now come down to earth he's veiled in a prophet and he's saying let my people go I've said it before but they weren't Moses people now God's people why God was speaking first person through a man does God really do that yeah sure David would write the sounds my God my God why Zell forsaken me and he was looking at Calvary so now there was a contest and the first thing that Moses did was take his rod throw it down on the ground and became a serpent he picks it up by the tail and it becomes a rod now remember the the the insignia of Pharoah was a was a Cobra and he was considered not more than a king but a god king and so the reason that Moses would would would take that rod and throw it down turn to a snake and then lift her back up again turn to a rod again is that God was actually telling the devil devil my prophet under the blood of bulls and goats can loose you and can bind you he can loose you he can bind you he has full control over you devil it doesn't matter what you try and do what you think you can do I mean he is unstoppable and you will not be able to stop him no no way amen and then it's exactly the same thing with you and I I'm in under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean could we have a real service I mean if a man can do that under the blood of bulls and goats to liberate his people how much more people under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean to liberate their family liberate their loved ones liberate those ones around them hallelujah where's the powder bind and the powder loose but the problem is many times we don't address our enemy when he needs to be addressed amen you have the power to bind you have the power to loose the enemy but you've got to open your mouth and you've got to do it amen that doesn't mean you go over to people's out I know you do that in prayer but love will cast the devil out brother Bram you know you're a woman would come to her and say brother Brown my husband doesn't love me doesn't accept what I believe in you know what are we gonna do what should I do I'm gonna try to cast the devil and he just got mad he said what you do is you make his favorite pie does that God works make his favorite pie when he comes home put it down in front of him sit on his lap tell him you love him hallelujah see you need wisdom hey do it right it's not usurping that's what a home that would be right it takes love sometimes it takes love but in prayer you address yours you you you talk to the devil you tell him amen so we know the end of the story Moses came and Pharaoh said I'll not let my people go you I mean your people go he had in his heart because of his pride he wasn't willing to actually say you know what you can take them but because of his pride and his arrogance see he said no I'll not let them go and Moses hid fun and plague after plague Pharaoh tried to compromise the devil loves to compromise with us you know sure they can come to church but this or this but this and we say no full liberation will not leave one hoof behind remember God God was now availed in Moses and then and then Pharaoh you know eventually death strikes yes to let them go as God said he would as God said he would remember God told Moses before he ever went to Egypt you'll come back to this mountain again you'll come worship here again you'll bring the people here what happened that's was exactly what happened I mean so there was there was a there's that contest and and Moses God and Moses won the battle and then now every time a prophet would rise up the devil would try and destroy them but now we're the same thing now when Elijah came stomped into Ahab's a halfs throne room the devil maybe I've seen that look before hallelujah I've seen that look before maybe Joshua you know he was there with Moses and he would you know you know he was he was Moses minister and so on but after he met the captain of the host of the Lord maybe took on a different look hallelujah and maybe the devil said oh I've seen this I thought it I thought that looked left when Moses died but remember God may take his man or his woman be never leave says he never takes his spirit just like the devil will take his man but will will leave his spirit upon the earth right so there always be somebody somebody amen where the devil look and say I've seen that look before but he's not sure mean because like with Jesus if thou be the Son of God I think I've seen this before but if they'll be and the same thing he'll do with you you really dare one he said well you don't eat down to him nothing but I met God he's now veiled behind my skin so Elijah stopped in to Jezebel strode Andrew may have certain room says it's not going to be rain or Dew - I call for it is a contest went on and the devil said I've seen this look before then maybe the devil breathed a sigh of relief when the fiery chariot came and took Elijah away that wasn't the end of it remember there's always been the devil's devil all the way down through all the way down through the ages this being a devil's devil hallelujah hallelujah you know I said this in Cape Town and they looked at me like wow what do you mean Oh either deal anyway you know so there's always been member because God changes his form right he changes his a morph a or his form so the external appearance may be different but he is the same on the inside hallelujah Goliath would make his boast here was the devil's champion and he'd make his boast for forty days bring me a man bring me a man we don't know come on let's not get messy here just pick your champion I'll fight him we don't know Lindsey I you know if I win you serve me you know if he wins will serve you and and there was a Devil's champion he has anointed this warrior of gas this mighty Goliath but there's a shepherd boy that had been anointed little shepherd boy been anointed by a predestinate and ordained prophet of God and says when when when David was anointed the Spirit of God was with him from that day on and so here was one that God was in and and and Goliath boasts fell on the wrong is that day I mean it fell on a lot of ears for forty days but then there was another set of ears that that that that that heard that boast and it's amazing because when the devil comes and challenges there's something that rises up and God's children I mean that's and God says I accept the challenge I accept your challenge devil every said David wasn't saying all what I said I'll go find him it's just one you guys can you big you got armor you know come on well if you won't do it I'll do the job you know and and and I think there's something in the Bride of Christ so an else won't do it although I'll take the devil's challenge this word is true Jesus Christ is alive I mean sorry so here was now Goliath and sure he disdained David cuz he is but a youth but I think maybe the devil said I've seen this look before it wasn't an 80 year old man now it's enough no 13 or whatever your old boy I've seen this look before and then David begins to prophesy I'm gonna cut your head off and all of these ones as well he picks up five stones of the brook because because Goliath had brothers and he just realized well if I gotta kill them all well I guess we got 24 hours in a day with miles get it done Holliday it should be the same thing with you and I just kill one devil at a time you say I've got a lot of problems in my life just take one at a time I've got a pride problem kill that one I've got a last problem then kill that one I've ever stop and spurt kill that one I mean I've got this pornographic demon kill that one I've got whatever it is just that one and then that one then that one well you say I've got a big to-do list well how do you do it to-do list the first one and you do the next thing on the list you do next thing so just kill them one at a time and many times you say well how do I overcome this just do the opposite you know it's like a you know a cancer feeds off your body and then you know the best way well okay I'm not a doctor but you know how do you kill a cancer the one way to kill a cancer is you actually stop it from being able to feed so if your body dries up and there's no life and anymore and there's nothing for the cancer to feed on what happens the cancer it dies if you kill the if it can't feed it all die starve the devil that's what I'm getting to just just starve the thing maybe he'll push your order no no no no no you're gonna stop if you're gonna if you're gonna sit here and try to get me to do those things you're gonna starve to death because that thing member he puts a desire to have for certain things that is actually a spurt feeding on it you take an alcoholic you take a smoke you take anything there's such a desire because there's a spurt actually feeding on that thing so what do you do starve the thing remember draw nigh to God resist the devil resist the devil draw nigh to God and He shall flee from you it's very simple you draw nigh to God and resist the devil remember it's not the it's not the power of positive thinking you've got to draw nigh to God then resist the devil and he shall flee hallelujah amen to this there's David he prophesies I'm going to take your head off I'm gonna kill all these ones if I have to remember came on his ground remember there's something about God God is a jealous God our God is a jealous God my he doesn't want to share us with no spirit nothing of the world he doesn't want us to be you know he doesn't want to be the weekends with this guy and then him the rest of the week you know that's not how God works he's a jealous God so when when the devil lays a finger on God's property then the devil's got Jesus Christ on his hands hallelujah brother Brian was saying deep calls to deep the other deal will be to watch out I mean cuz if he ever touches one of God's children then he's got Jesus Christ on his hands ha see see you've got a you recognize a mean it's not you fighting the battle it's not you just alone and you've got to work out how to know God sees and God remembers hello yeah he doesn't remember a thing cuz they're under the blood of Jesus Christ but there's no blood for the devil there's no redemption for him there's no forgiveness of sin I mean the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't shared for Satan hallelujah so but God has a long memory hallelujah and it's accurate it doesn't morph inform as time goes by you know many times we as we get older we we we think about our childhood and we want to kind of go back and live in that little childhood but many times it's actually a composite of all these nice memories put together in one and we and we seem to remember that's exactly how it was but in reality that's wasn't how it was maybe I'm just talking about me but you know you know you think about your child I wish I could go there and have this and but then also you're only thinking about it as a child so you don't know the full picture of maybe the struggles of your parents what's going on and the family whatever you don't see that because you just see what you're seeing and you want to go back to that that way and it's actually a whole bunch of memories been merged into one you know God's memory ain't like that God's memory is as accurate exactly how it was you know so so God has a long memory and he remembers what the devil did he's gonna take him to account amen so now David was David was he killed Goliath hallelujah and then all the way down through the devil said I've seen this look before and then finally there came 400 years of silence between Malachi and Matthew and now there was a prophet in the land whose name was John and the devil looked at this man and he wasn't like all the other religious fellows in the world he was rugged he was a yo you you know here's one who lived there in the wilderness honey and locusts was his meat but there was a look in his eyes and he'll begin to speak a word and had power and it began to draw people and the devil said you know I've seen this look before but then the one that he has come to point out came our Lord Jesus came down in the and the word met the prophet in the water and then here comes here comes the word comes and meets the prophet in the water and then Jesus is baptized by John comes out of the water the Spirit of God descends upon him like a dove and then the devil and then and in the spirit of God leads Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted the devil comes and he begins to look at him face to face he begins to have a conversation with him and no doubt he looked at those eyes remember he saw him part down through the prophets but now he was the fullness here was that same one that cast him out of heaven was now standing in flesh and was looking at his enemy imagine that and he says if thou be the Son of God and then he had in his mind I've got to destroy this one I've got to destroy this one and he couldn't actually do it until the Lord said now it's my time I know man take my life from me I lay it down and if I lay it down I'll pick it back up again how this is the devil see now I'm gonna destroy this thing I'm gonna I'm gonna destroy this one and he thought he had him he thought he had him and then no doubt finally he's dead on the cross the devil now goes back into hell maybe sits on his lazy boy chair thinking finally I can rest my tormentor is dead Oh No you know where I'm going we just enjoy it hallelu ain't pen it so here's so so here he is he thinks he's finally won he thought he had him with Abel thought he had him with Moses thought he had him with Elijah all the way down through and then finally the hell door of Hell gets busted open and that one that came down and flesh now came down into hell he wasn't Carson to hell he wasn't thrown there he came down and the devil maybe rocks out out of his chair oh now I've got you I thought I had you as a well thought I had you with the prophecy now I've got you and then and then our Lord Jesus says Satan my blood is on the cross I am the red I am the Virgin born son of God I mean I purchases purchase the salvation of my children of the whole world I am in charge him give me the keys he held it in the grave hallelujah he rips them off a site and then ascends up hallelujah and then finally ha ha ha our Lord Jesus goes into another place where the people are being tormented there waiting as my girls called the waiting room that's a good waiting room to be in and then it all comes open and they've been having fellowship Abraham said I saw this look and a man called Melchizedek and then and then he became a play man on the plains of Mamre told us that we could have the promised son I saw a look and then and then Isaac said yes I saw you know I saw that same kind of look and then J and then Jacob said I wrestled with a man and he had that same kind of look that you're describing Abraham I mean he changed my walk I may change you from a trauma from a supplanted to a prince with God and in Moses say yeah I saw that look too I mean as a as a voice out of a burning bush and different things and you know they and then Joshua said I know exactly who you're talking about I saw him as the captain of the host of law with a soldier I saw that look at his face in the more than a man to me it's such a hitter face it looked like one word could turn the world upside down and then and then one look just commanded love and respect and hallelujah I mean and then Daniel will say yes I saw him to a man Ezekiel said yes it's a well within the will hallelujah all the way down through and then John would say i baptize hallelujah he became flesh I saw that look and then the thief on the cross made me here's the last one I saw that look - he had a crown of thorns on his head blood pouring out of himself how live but he looked at me and I looked in there I've never seen eyes like that before I tell you when you look into the eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll see that's a different kind of look hallelujah and then the door comes open and then our Lord Jesus steps into paradise and then they look at him saying we've seen this look before hallelujah and here he is hallelujah and it wasn't a torment it was a rejoicing here's the one we love here's the one we served as the one we walked with holy all the days of our life hallelujah glory to God and they said children you don't hit the wait in this waiting place no more let's go up a little higher holy then he emptied out paradise let's send it on high came up into the glorious City than that a call came from them lift the upper gates and open the up ye everlasting doors of the King of glory shall come in and there is a response from the from the battlements anchors the King of glory and what they say the Lord of glory the Lord mighty in battle he is the king of glory hallelujah so it wasn't a torment to them the one that they had been waiting for all their lives had now come and carried them away hallelujah yeah and the devil now though hopefully it's over oh no oh remember the devil who know as a god God can talk me in the devil hallelujah you know finally it's all done and the end the disciples they're all locked up in the effort you oh gee this earth don't belong to him it belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter he says man I could say something right now but I better not it is the title deed of our Redemption the seven sealed book it's the title deed you wait till we get into those seals he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inherence that he inherited by becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us you know you have a victory you you want to share it with everyone come rejoice with me how I said the Lord you know you know he won the greatest victory over hell death and the grave says come down joy with me come rejoice children holy the sync question settled amen amen now Oh Satan the possessor of it now the squatter talking about the earth he's finally he don't want to give it up right quick we find out here and a little later on the on in the scriptures I'm thinking over here in another chapter and he didn't want to give it up right away but he he had to fight over it but finally when he was brought to a showdown he's cast into the lake of fire that's right Jesus the name Jesus and the gospel has four titles of son do you know that Jesus has four titles of son and the Gospels one is the son of David one of them as the son of Abraham another the Son of Man and other the Son of God now watch when our kinsman redeemer became Jesus Christ he become the son of David which is an heir to the throne glory he aired the throne by being a son of David God back there that he said God told back there that he would never leave David never leave David without a seed and Christ is the son of David and he became our kinsman redeemer and waiting getting a place ready where he can reign with us as the son of David he's yet to the throne as the son of Abraham he's our heir to the rural ground amen is that right he's a niche of the royal great aim in Palestine and all that's in her Abraham seat he was a son of Abraham and as a son of man what the son of man what did man lose he lost the earth so as the son of he is heir to everything in the earth all this he's got and has and has to give it back to us then he's returning back I mean then as the son of God here and here it's all things as a son of David he's heir to the throne and son of Abraham he's heir to the Royal grant as son of man he's heir to the earth as son of God he's heir to all things in heaven and earth oh my that's our redeemer our kinsman redeemer now notice oh this does me so good this is where I really get feeding now let your hearts loose to God just a few minutes listen to the Satan as a squatter he don't legally own this he said two thousand years to fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it but Christ came as the kinsman redeemer and redeemed it back to us but Satan possesses it do you know after a while this great fights over he'll be cast into the lake of fire see he'll be done away with and all them who worships with him but the ears of salvation will come with Christ now he's a squatter now remember in the Old Testament if a man lost his inheritance and a squatter came on his land he could not hold it any longer for annihilation from the owner until 50 years of Jubilee after 50 years the years of Jubilee came by and the year of Jubilee when the year of Jubilee came along when everything went back to its original beginning again all the slaves they went back to the original beginning if a man was hoeing in the field and the trumpet sounded and he heard he had throw down the hoe and so no more slave I go back home to my family everything was given back if a squatter was on the ground he had to get off the ground that's all he had to get off the ground because why the legal owner was coming back he had to give away hallelujah one of these days the kingdoms of this world will fall and the legal owners will come in of in one of these days amen now there was a time this is really where I wanted to get to now there was a time when it was a dispute from the fortieth day from the beginning of the first day of the cleansing of the sanctuary or Christ went to Calvary there was 40 days into the Ascension it was in debate where the Satan's group would take it and say that he did not raise from the dead they begin to start out a proclamation along there saying said the apples come install his body by night you've read the Bible and they said that his people come and stole him by night and paid the soldiers money to say that but it was in question then everybody was in question well really maybe it does belong to the organization and the whole thing belongs to it but on the 50th day was the day of Pentecost and the legal owner came down hallelujah and showed it was no organization it was a filling of the Holy Ghost earnest money to his church that it would not be controlled by organizations and so forth it would be the earnest money of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with power and the love of God amen doesn't that just do something to you paulius on the day of Pentecost remember the devil thought finally it's done my torment is gone and there was fifty days now of a dispute going on but then he said the legal owner came down the Lord Himself came down into the upper room and now it was not just God behind one one man so so it wasn't just one man having the look now 120 had that same look I mean cuz the Holy Ghost came and dwelt in then and now the devil looked at these ones coming out staring like drunk people rejoicing shouting hallelujah the words being fulfilled glory amen and he looked at them and says now we really got trouble this thing spreading this thing sprinting talk about a pandemic hallelujah everyone should get sick with this thing hallelujah Amen see you know I know six the wrong word but you know what I mean but begin to spread now the Devils are now really got trouble and it spread from 120 I think 3,000 and 5,000 in then he tried to persecute it they're gonna try to throw him in jail this is I'm gonna rid the world of this thing and it just spread like fire hallelujah amen because the disciples were led by the Holy Ghost they sold everything that they had gave it to the church because when when the when the time came Bheema God always repairs his children before time what's what has been happening all this time God's preparing us Ilia so so he prepared the church that they had no roots and Jerusalem anymore that when persecution came and they had to leave they could just leave and they took the wood with them and then it began to spread and it began to spread and then and then the devil anointed a man called Saul of Tarsus and he was determined I'm going to destroy the singing you know he had his ambition but God has his ambition I mean you remember people may be fighting mice you and they fascinate turn against it but God's got his ambition hallelujah and this one was determined I'm going to throw them in prison go do whatever but then he met that same God on the road to Damascus and I believe his countenance would have changed hallelujah lujah and then the devil said oh I've seen this look before so he tried to throw him in prison tried to drown him tried to do all kinds of things against Paul couldn't stop it just like God can't stop I mean the devil can't stop you devil couldn't stop Paul he can't stop you he says I've been distressed I've been beaten up in shipwrecked I've been all these bad you know thrown in prison whatever more let it stop him didn't stop him same thing with you and I I just want to give you a bit of encouragement this morning doesn't matter what you may be facing the devil can't stop you you'll fulfill the word in your life hallelujah and then so the devil got crafty if we can't beat them join them you know that saying can't beat them join them so he brought in people and then you know you read about X 15 it says now the Pharisees who believes in Jesus see if people have to become Jews before they became can become Christians I'll say pretty bluntly they didn't actually become Christians they were still Pharisees they hadn't been converted they hadn't been changed because they tried to bring their old life in with them so why well is that the devil saying well I can't beat him so I'll join them sorry so I brought these people in brought what confusion false doctrine things in to try and destroy the life and that's what happens the devil the devil wants to try and stop the moving of the Holy Ghost he wants to stop the power of the gospel manifesting that's what he wants to do he doesn't mind if we come to church become formal maybe but your pomp and ceremony whatever it may be and quiet and yeah but he doesn't mind that but what he minds is when God fills a person and then God uses that person to shake the world hallelujah killer yellow the Prophet said the day of Pentecost that it wouldn't stir too much but when Peter and John went by the gate of gate called beautiful and there's that crippled man they said silver and gold we have none as we have give under the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk then he really rolled out of his lazy boy and then that's when the persecution began to strike why because it was God in action and the people and that's what the devil wants to stop is actually God in action in our lives that's why he brings stressful atmospheres and trouble in the home and you know turmoil different things he's trying to stop God manifesting you got to be mindful what's going on hallelujah so the devil said can't beat them join them so then now finally the church fell they thought in the Dark Ages I've got it it's all sealed away can't happen I've won I know you know the church was prophesied it had to go that way it was prophesied that it had to God I'm going to the ground had be a death a barrel in a resurrection I mean so the devil flaw finally I've got it but then God begin to move and there are people like John Wycliffe well before Luther well before even HUS oh no just before house actually you know actually even before that there was Columbo we know who Columbus church age messenger he founded a Bible School there and one of the islands of Northwest Scotland and Bible historians say for the next 900 years the most of the evangelical mission work in Europe came out of their Bible School God knows how to prepare things you know we think Oh how's it going to happen our God knows how to prepare things hallelujah so so and then and then they influence John Wycliffe and John Wycliffe just had a real simple burden the people should be able to read the Bible in their own language if Y should be in Latin we're not letting people we're English people however they spoken those days is different to the English now but you know it a burden maybe going to translate the Scriptures because he was so burdened by the ignorance of people you know meaning you know see so he had a burden and then and then that happened and endow John Wycliff influence his teachings went to Bohemia and they influenced John HUS and and John HUS he basically had the same revelation that Luther had but a hundred years before and because remember there's the death of Baral in a resurrection and the devil said no no no it's gonna stay in the ground and God says oh no no no no no no read the end of the book boy it's got to come forth he says no no no it's gonna stay no no no no God says no that's got to come forth hallelujah so so so John has had a burden and and it was even a you know amazing change there where actually the congregation would sing as opposed to acquire and he believed the just shall be lived by faith a thing is very close to what Luther believed and now the devil said I've seen this look before it was only impartial for me see I've seen this look before and he had him burnt at the stake but John Huss said in a hundred years a man will raise up with these same teachings you'll not be able to stop him hundred years later Luther now this thesis on the on the wooden burg Church just or wherever it was the Reformation was on and then now the devil said well if I can't beat him I'll join him but you can't stop the life of God but now the devil it's been vexing him ever since I must stop these people I must stop the life of God and then finally when finally when it was all scrupled up there's a man came in this day Elijah the Prophet a man with the spirit of Elijah and God made him in the water sit as John the Baptist fall on the first come across your message will fall on the second coming holy what happened God came down he what he didn't fall he wasn't cast down he came down why because now he's gonna gather his bride Holly and now he's gonna gather his bride and what he saw remember this message restores us back to the original Bible faith it doesn't give us another Bible this is the message this is the message right this is the message I've preached when I was in the face went up to Papua New Guinea I preached I never mentioned brother Branham I mentioned that I just preached the scripture and now a psalm a saying how where'd you get this wrong because they could see it in the scriptures they saw we're at the end time they saw you know the conditions where we are they saw everything because I just showed it out of the scripture because the message just just shows us the Bible it's not as something else remember we have we are restored back the original faith in the father's reginal Pentecostal father's before the ephesian church ever started their age well we've been restored before they foul hallelujah so so the devil's you know he begins to see now God comes down veils himself and a man brother Bram says I'm just a man I'm full of failures I make mistakes I'm bad with saying saying crowd sizes you know he tells us all those things right right on my man my words are foul his word doesn't fail be seized of I've told you the truth let him come and prove it and then every demon didn't matter what affliction it was it was cast out I meant cancer by the multitude whatever it was people crippled up people demon-possessed out of their mind they didn't stay that way they didn't stay that way why cuz the Conqueror in heaven had now come down into the end time and it was now manifesting his victory at Calvary amen in this age hallelujah Holly and now the devil's has now really got trouble because you know what God does you know the Bible says in Corinthians chapter 11 that the woman is the glory of the man the man is not the glory of the woman the woman is the glory of the man so the woman is actually the man's glory so now the Lord just takes the bride Satan this is my glory this is what I've done God not ashamed of you he's proud of you he's proud of you her little old me absolutely little old you and he takes you up it says Satan this is what my blood does this is what was prophesied what I told you I would do these are the living evidence these people are the living evidence of what I said I'd do is happening and there are lives hallelujah hallelujah and then and now the devil says I've seen that look before and then when you meet Jesus Christ for yourself there's a change no one needs to tell you you know something happened you were there I mean you were there when it happened when the word became a living reality I mean when you seen I remember I remember when I read this book Holly and I heard about a kinsman sipping forth loosing the seals and it became it wasn't a doctor I said let's least if out of eternity amen take my life open my life up say this is who you're meant to be Holly you're not made to be this man from New Zealand you're from heaven hello more than adoption experience the book coming open as they sadly some people say the book still closed well maybe to them it is but to me it's not why cuz the lamb came forth to me okay just like Calvary is not a story it's a reality I mean you're there when he died he saw his blood pour out Holly saw your atonement being made hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God why cause you're bad happened to you no one else can tell you had the experience you know that your sins are washed away that burden of sin was taking all your guilt and your shame everything was carried away that day why cuz you were there huddled here and now the devil says now I've got trouble but I'll say this there's no more death burial resurrection it's just resurrection now this is a resurrection season there's no death barrel I mean the the devil can't beat us and he can't join us Jesus says I've no part in him he has no part of me we have to come that realization devil you have no part of me I have no part of you there's not there's no partnership there's nothing we have nothing there's no mutual meeting agreement between us nothing here is no part of me I have no part in him there's actually once God has come down and cut any kind of separation anytime between Gardens I mean I mean between man and Satan you just got to realize that now I'm we say but I get sick that's irrelevant the body needs changing and we go boy I tell you what holy hallelujah amen if he's filled with the Holy Ghost he's gonna change my body if he saved me he's gonna change my body I mean every set me free is gonna change my body if his word became real to me he's gonna change my body hallelujah hallelujah amen so now there's no death bear is real it's just resurrection so the devil says now I really have trouble cuz he can't stop you he can't stop you in the name of Jesus Christ he can't he'll try put doubts and put hurts and try mickey shell up yet i'll make you just kind of operate as this little kind of believe it not this life isn't to go forth there's a heartfelt
