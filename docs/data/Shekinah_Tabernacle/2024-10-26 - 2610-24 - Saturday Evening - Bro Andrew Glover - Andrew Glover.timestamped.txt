[1:00:18] the book of Jeremiah the first chapter I
[1:00:21] want to look here in Jeremiah chapter 1
[1:00:25] and verse number 4 and then we'll read
[1:00:27] in the Book of Daniel and then we want
[1:00:29] to turn to St John 15 amen Jeremiah
[1:00:33] chapter 1 and verse four the Bible says
[1:00:36] then the word of the Lord came unto me
[1:00:38] saying before I form thee in the belly I
[1:00:42] knew thee and before thou camest forth
[1:00:45] out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[1:00:48] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[1:00:52] so this didn't happen after he was born
[1:00:54] but when he was born and he was walking
[1:00:56] or moving into the Fulfillment of an
[1:00:58] ordination upon his life then said I ah
[1:01:02] Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am
[1:01:05] a child but the Lord said unto me say
[1:01:08] not I am a child for Thou shalt go to
[1:01:11] all that I shall send thee and
[1:01:14] whatsoever I commanded thee Thou shalt
[1:01:17] speak be not afraid of their faces for I
[1:01:21] am with thee to deliver thee saith the
[1:01:23] Lord then the Lord put forth his hand
[1:01:25] and touched my mouth and the Lord said
[1:01:28] unto me behold I have put my words in
[1:01:32] thy mouth so it's not going to be
[1:01:33] Jeremiah's words it's going to be the
[1:01:36] words of the Lord see I have this day
[1:01:38] set thee over the Nations and over the
[1:01:41] kingdoms to root out to pull down to
[1:01:44] destroy to throw down to build and to
[1:01:48] plant amen I think that's powerful the
[1:01:50] word of the Lord in the mouth of a
[1:01:52] prophet is going to tear down it's going
[1:01:55] to destroy
[1:01:56] it's going to root out but then it's
[1:01:58] also going to build and it's going to
[1:02:00] plant or positionally place now in the
[1:02:03] Book of Daniel the 9th
[1:02:05] chapter The Book of Daniel uh the ninth
[1:02:09] chapter I want to read there and I want
[1:02:10] to read in the first verse of Daniel
[1:02:13] chapter 9 and verse one and you that
[1:02:15] study brother brandham you know that
[1:02:16] he'll tell us that Daniel uh is the Book
[1:02:19] of Revelation in the Old Testament in
[1:02:22] Daniel chapter 9 and verse one in the
[1:02:24] first year of Darius the son of azurus
[1:02:27] of the seed of the mes which was made
[1:02:29] King over the realm of the Chaldeans in
[1:02:32] the first year of his Reign I Daniel
[1:02:35] understood by books the number of the
[1:02:37] years whereof the word of the Lord came
[1:02:41] to jermiah the prophet that he would
[1:02:44] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[1:02:47] of Jerusalem and I sat my face unto the
[1:02:51] Lord God to seek by prayer and
[1:02:54] supplication with fasting
[1:02:56] and sackcloth and Ashes now in the book
[1:02:59] of St John chapter 15 I know tonight
[1:03:02] that as Believers uh this scripture here
[1:03:05] is memorized in our hearts in St John
[1:03:08] chapter
[1:03:09] 15 and verse number 16 I love the words
[1:03:13] of our Lord Jesus he says ye have not
[1:03:17] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[1:03:21] ordained you that you should go and
[1:03:24] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:03:26] should remain and that whatsoever ye
[1:03:29] shall ask of the father in my name he
[1:03:32] may give it to you amen we ask the Lord
[1:03:35] this evening to add the blessing to the
[1:03:37] reading of his word as you can have your
[1:03:38] seats here uh this evening I want to by
[1:03:41] the help of the Lord for just a few
[1:03:42] moments tonight amen from those uh
[1:03:45] various passages of scripture I want to
[1:03:47] speak to you on this ordained to the
[1:03:50] message by the spirit amen ordained to
[1:03:54] the message by the spirit now I believe
[1:03:57] that we are living in a very special
[1:03:59] time believe we're living in an hour
[1:04:01] amen where the time has come to preach
[1:04:04] the message I believe if there's ever
[1:04:05] been a time a season an age a generation
[1:04:09] that the message of the hour ought to be
[1:04:11] taught and ought to be preached in our
[1:04:13] churches I believe now is the time to do
[1:04:15] it you know I believe that this is the
[1:04:18] time amen that by the preaching of the
[1:04:20] gospel and the teaching of the word amen
[1:04:22] that the people of God are moving into
[1:04:25] higher high
[1:04:26] amen and deeper depths of the message of
[1:04:29] the hour you know I believe that the
[1:04:31] message of the hour amen is bringing a
[1:04:33] stability to the body of Christ and it
[1:04:36] is positionally placing every adopted
[1:04:39] son and daughter of God underneath the
[1:04:41] headship of the word now as ministers I
[1:04:44] believe that we are under a commission
[1:04:47] Amen to establish the people in the word
[1:04:50] amen and to establish the word in the
[1:04:52] people brother B said in Satan's edting
[1:04:54] he said the thing of it is is today he
[1:04:57] said we don't try to establish the word
[1:04:59] of God in the people's hearts he said we
[1:05:01] are trying to establish ourselves he
[1:05:04] said the churches are trying to
[1:05:06] establish the doctrine of the church
[1:05:08] amen in a person's heart but we are
[1:05:10] commanded to establish the word of God
[1:05:14] see Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:05:16] enticing words amen of man that your
[1:05:18] faith might rest up in the knowledge of
[1:05:20] man but I come to you in the power and
[1:05:23] the manifestation of the holy ghost that
[1:05:26] your faith would rest in God now I think
[1:05:29] of the words of Peter when he would say
[1:05:31] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[1:05:33] you always in remembrance of these
[1:05:35] things amen though you know them amen
[1:05:38] and be established in present truth now
[1:05:41] listen this is the hour amen that we're
[1:05:43] not establishing the church in what God
[1:05:46] has done amen or what God is going to do
[1:05:49] amen but this is The Hour That by the
[1:05:51] preaching of the unsearchable riches of
[1:05:54] Christ we are esta establishing a
[1:05:56] generation in the present truth of what
[1:05:59] God is in the hour that we're living in
[1:06:01] you know recently I was listening to a
[1:06:03] tape and brother bradam was there and he
[1:06:05] was ordaining some brothers into the
[1:06:07] ministry does God ever change his mind
[1:06:09] about his word he actually comes to a
[1:06:11] brother here in uh 1965 he says now here
[1:06:15] does anybody know brother Merlin anthon
[1:06:16] he's new he's new to me and somebody
[1:06:19] speaks up they say oh he's with the
[1:06:21] Salvation Army brother said oh that's
[1:06:23] right I remember him sure I know him see
[1:06:25] his face didn't look familiar to me just
[1:06:27] then at this time he said now how many
[1:06:30] knows this to be a man of God he said
[1:06:32] how many believes that God is working
[1:06:34] with him raise your hand he said now how
[1:06:36] many will pray for him now listen to the
[1:06:38] prophet he said now brother we know that
[1:06:40] you're coming from a great group of
[1:06:42] people the Salvation Army they're are
[1:06:44] great people he said the Salvation Army
[1:06:47] does a great work out on the street he
[1:06:49] said we can say nothing against the
[1:06:51] Nazarene or the Pentecostal church or
[1:06:53] the Salvation Army or any of them they
[1:06:55] are our Brethren he said but you see we
[1:06:58] believe that we are carriers of a great
[1:07:01] message amen for this very hour that
[1:07:04] we're living in he said now you want to
[1:07:06] do that with us amen I find it amazing
[1:07:09] as I study several places where brother
[1:07:11] Brandon will ordain men to preach the
[1:07:14] word amen he makes it very clear and
[1:07:16] very emphatic amen that he is ordaining
[1:07:19] them to preach the message amen if if a
[1:07:23] Baptist was ordaining a Baptist he would
[1:07:25] ordain him Amen to carry Baptist
[1:07:27] Doctrine if a Pentecostal was ordaining
[1:07:30] a Pentecostal he would ordain them to
[1:07:32] carry Pentecostal Doctrine but clearly
[1:07:35] when a prophet would ordain a man amen
[1:07:37] to preach the gospel he was ordaining
[1:07:40] him Amen to preach Christ as he has been
[1:07:43] revealed amen through this end time
[1:07:45] message now I'll say this I don't
[1:07:47] believe this is the time Amen to get
[1:07:50] casual with this message I don't think
[1:07:52] this is the time amen I can't ever I
[1:07:54] can't ever speak of that without
[1:07:56] thinking of a of a of a of a of a a
[1:07:58] legacy or a amen a legendary sermon of
[1:08:00] our brother bisc he preached years ago
[1:08:02] on proven accuracy of the spoken word he
[1:08:05] said now this is not the time to become
[1:08:08] deluded with the message of the hour and
[1:08:10] you know tonight I say it's an hour
[1:08:12] where men amen are presuming and they're
[1:08:14] adventuring and they're going beyond the
[1:08:16] teachings of a prophet they're digging
[1:08:18] over into psychology and they're pulling
[1:08:20] things out of reformers and they've been
[1:08:22] going back and studying what this
[1:08:24] Theologian thought and amen trying to
[1:08:26] put it underneath the umbrella of the
[1:08:28] message amen but I say if God has called
[1:08:31] us and God has given us the grace to see
[1:08:33] and understand amen the things that
[1:08:36] we're seeing and understanding I say if
[1:08:38] there's ever been a time to die to
[1:08:40] everything else apart from the words of
[1:08:43] the seventh angel I say now is the time
[1:08:46] to do it amen education is not going to
[1:08:49] Rapture this bride theology is not going
[1:08:51] to change our bodies amen but the
[1:08:54] Revelation that is coming in this
[1:08:56] generation amen without form without
[1:08:58] fashion without any controversy of man
[1:09:01] but it's come to the church pure is the
[1:09:03] only thing that will change our bodies
[1:09:05] when I think of these things I think of
[1:09:07] how God Amen reveals things amen but he
[1:09:11] only reveals them to those who he has
[1:09:13] ordained to see them 1965 he said well
[1:09:17] that's the way Christ is himself the
[1:09:19] gospel the message is when you once see
[1:09:23] the message of the hour amen there's
[1:09:26] nothing else you can see but that that's
[1:09:28] all everything else is gone amen the
[1:09:31] rest of it is just a filler see amen
[1:09:34] when you once see the message listen
[1:09:38] when you once see the message you can't
[1:09:40] see anything else when you once hear the
[1:09:43] eagle scream you can't hear anything
[1:09:46] else let me say this I don't believe God
[1:09:49] is just calling and ordaining men to
[1:09:52] preach this message but I believe he's
[1:09:54] ordaining Bel belever amen by the spirit
[1:09:57] of Truth to carry this message he said I
[1:10:00] think if ministering Brethren today
[1:10:01] would just not take it from an
[1:10:03] intellectual standpoint but would find
[1:10:05] them a place on the backside of the
[1:10:07] desert on those sacred Sands where Satan
[1:10:10] cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief
[1:10:13] and stay there until a message comes
[1:10:15] from God and positionally places you in
[1:10:19] the ministry then all the Devils out of
[1:10:21] Torment couldn't shake you from it
[1:10:24] because you know you are caught I think
[1:10:27] each Christian ought to do that before
[1:10:29] you come out and confess the Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] confess you have the baptism there ought
[1:10:34] to be such a personal contact with God
[1:10:37] until all the intellectuals in the world
[1:10:40] Amen couldn't explain it from you
[1:10:42] because you know you've been there
[1:10:44] you've had the witness and you know it's
[1:10:46] so what is this message calling for it
[1:10:49] is calling for believers Amen to come in
[1:10:52] personal contact with God
[1:10:56] but the prophet of God said we get so
[1:10:58] sour down on theology amen till we don't
[1:11:00] know nothing about the spirit he said I
[1:11:03] hope you love me after this amen but
[1:11:05] that's what it is I mean Pentecost too
[1:11:07] that's right just shouting and dancing
[1:11:09] around amen doesn't mean you know
[1:11:11] anything about the spirit it is a
[1:11:14] personal contact face to face that's
[1:11:17] what you need he said that's the kind of
[1:11:19] church amen that God is fixing to raise
[1:11:22] up when they come together in unity in
[1:11:25] power and in spirit let me just say this
[1:11:28] I cannot help what others do amen I
[1:11:30] can't help what other preachers feel
[1:11:32] amen is important to preach to the
[1:11:34] people I cannot help what other people
[1:11:36] have done with the message amen but ask
[1:11:39] for me in my house amen I am ordained to
[1:11:42] the message of William Brandon I am
[1:11:44] ordained to say what a prophet said I am
[1:11:47] ordained to believe what a prophet T
[1:11:49] listen the prophet of God said my
[1:11:51] friends I don't want to hurt your
[1:11:52] feelings but I am responsible for for a
[1:11:55] message and that message is this come
[1:11:58] out of this mess oh Church of the Living
[1:12:02] God Amen and if I ask you to come out
[1:12:04] amen then where am I going to take you
[1:12:06] to when I take you to the brandham
[1:12:08] Tabernacle it's got as much fault as any
[1:12:10] of the rest to them but there's one
[1:12:12] place I can take you to where you're
[1:12:15] safe and protected from death and that
[1:12:17] is in Jesus Christ which is God's
[1:12:20] provided place of worship listen this
[1:12:23] message is not the car
[1:12:25] amen of you from one tradition to
[1:12:27] another it's not carrying You from One
[1:12:30] denomination to another this message is
[1:12:32] carrying you amen back to where you come
[1:12:35] from listen you didn't come from Leota
[1:12:38] so you can't stay in Leota my Bible says
[1:12:41] I have come from God and I must go back
[1:12:43] to God so God must provide something to
[1:12:47] take me back to where I come from and
[1:12:49] denomination won't do it emotions won't
[1:12:52] do it feelings won't do it but the
[1:12:55] revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:57] quickened in the soul of a Believer will
[1:13:00] carry them beyond the Realms of time and
[1:13:02] will transport them into eternity hey I
[1:13:05] believe and I believe what Jeremiah said
[1:13:08] when he said before I formed thee in the
[1:13:09] belly I knew thee and before thou camest
[1:13:12] forth out of the womb amen I Sanctified
[1:13:15] thee and I ordained thee a prophet un
[1:13:17] the nation look at this word ordained it
[1:13:20] means to
[1:13:21] employ in other words before Jeremiah
[1:13:24] was born he already had a job in the
[1:13:26] kingdom of God he didn't have to go
[1:13:29] apply for a job amen he was born with a
[1:13:32] job that word ordained means to devote
[1:13:35] it means to consecrate it means to
[1:13:37] dedicate I love what the prophet of God
[1:13:40] said he said Jeremiah before he was even
[1:13:42] brought forth amen from his mother's
[1:13:44] womb God said he knew him and he
[1:13:48] Sanctified him and he ordained him a
[1:13:50] prophet over the nation before he ever
[1:13:53] come from his mother womb amen before
[1:13:56] Jeremiah ever was born amen God already
[1:13:59] knew him so that when he was born amen
[1:14:03] by the seed on the inside of him he
[1:14:05] would know the God who knew him listen I
[1:14:08] can't I can't get off my notes and
[1:14:09] preach here but I want to and then in
[1:14:11] the last days there will be a people who
[1:14:13] will know their God and they will be
[1:14:16] strong and they will do great exploits
[1:14:19] listen the world is looking for that
[1:14:21] people but tonight I'm looking at that
[1:14:24] people the world is looking for that
[1:14:26] generation who would declare the
[1:14:29] salvation of Jesus Christ but God who is
[1:14:32] rich in Mercy has allowed me to hear the
[1:14:34] voice of the seventh angel and it was
[1:14:37] not an uncertain sound it was a certain
[1:14:39] sound and here's what he said amen if
[1:14:42] you ever was a Son of God you always was
[1:14:45] a Son of God so the only thing this
[1:14:48] message is doing is Awakening you to
[1:14:51] your true identity of who you are in
[1:14:53] Jesus Christ
[1:14:55] my then you're not just here as a
[1:14:57] denominational child you are here as a
[1:14:59] child of God let me say this you have
[1:15:02] been born into the world for a specific
[1:15:06] purpose I love what the Bible says as
[1:15:08] many as received him to them gave he
[1:15:11] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:15:14] them that believe on his name listen
[1:15:17] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:15:20] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:15:23] but of God now listen most Moses had a
[1:15:25] specific purpose it was to deliver the
[1:15:28] people that were in bondage I think of
[1:15:31] Israel they had a specific purpose that
[1:15:34] their purpose brother says was that
[1:15:35] their bloodstream amen would be the
[1:15:37] cleanest for out of that would come the
[1:15:40] lineage of the Messiah let me say this
[1:15:42] the Messiah was none other than our Lord
[1:15:45] Jesus Christ who would fulfill the
[1:15:48] office of Redeemer Amen to those who
[1:15:50] would need Redemption so Jesus the
[1:15:52] Redeemer had a specific purpose
[1:15:55] Jesus said no man come to me except the
[1:15:58] father draws him first it's nothing you
[1:16:00] can do about it see Jesus didn't come to
[1:16:03] the calvary Amen to die for a haphazard
[1:16:06] purpose he didn't come there and say
[1:16:08] well maybe I'll die and it'll be so
[1:16:10] pathetic some people will see that I die
[1:16:12] and maybe they'll come and serve the
[1:16:14] Lord no Jesus come for a specific
[1:16:17] purpose to redeem those who God by forn
[1:16:20] knowledge elected to come to him to
[1:16:23] fulfill the words of the lord it's not
[1:16:26] of him that willth amen not of him that
[1:16:28] runneth but it is of god that showeth
[1:16:31] Mercy listen I don't know if you know
[1:16:33] who you are amen but you are not The
[1:16:35] Condemned of the Lord you are the
[1:16:37] redeemed of the Lord and my Bible says
[1:16:40] the redeemed of the Lord amen shall say
[1:16:43] so listen I think it's time Amen to
[1:16:45] remember we might have been born in sin
[1:16:48] we might have been shaping in iniquity
[1:16:50] but there was a soul on the inside of
[1:16:52] you and let me say this your flesh is
[1:16:55] not the real you your spirit is not the
[1:16:57] real you but you got a soul on the
[1:17:00] inside of you and that soul is the real
[1:17:04] you that's why I don't believe from my
[1:17:07] flesh I don't believe from my spirit I
[1:17:09] believe this message from my soul
[1:17:12] because it has redeemed my soul God
[1:17:14] didn't make you and I just to see if he
[1:17:16] could do it he made us for a purpose
[1:17:19] therefore is a purpose of us all being
[1:17:21] here he said you're not here just to be
[1:17:24] another human being you are here because
[1:17:27] God Amen has made you for a specific
[1:17:30] purpose you're not here just to eat the
[1:17:32] food that God growed or to live in the
[1:17:34] house that manmade or to wear the
[1:17:36] clothing that someone fashioned you are
[1:17:38] here for a specific purpose no matter
[1:17:41] how little you are how big you are how
[1:17:44] important you are how unimportant you
[1:17:46] are you are here to serve a purpose just
[1:17:49] as my finger is here for a purpose my
[1:17:52] nail on my finger is for a purpose my
[1:17:54] eye in every part of our bodies is to
[1:17:56] serve a purpose listen if it was not put
[1:17:59] here just to see what it would look like
[1:18:00] when it was put here it was put here to
[1:18:03] serve its purpose it was God's divine
[1:18:06] plan to do so are y'all ready for this
[1:18:09] and if we're here for a purpose then
[1:18:11] there is nothing can destroy us until
[1:18:14] God's purpose is fulfilled that ought to
[1:18:17] make you shout aloud in the house of God
[1:18:20] there is nothing the devil can do to
[1:18:22] destroy you until the purpose that God
[1:18:25] sent you on the earth to fulfill has
[1:18:27] been fulfilled nothing can harm us until
[1:18:30] the purpose that God has for us has been
[1:18:33] made manifest you know what I say I say
[1:18:36] devil get out of my way get out of the
[1:18:38] Church of the Living God's way I know
[1:18:41] who I am and I know why I'm here
[1:18:44] hallelujah I'm not just here to take up
[1:18:47] space I'm here on assignments come on
[1:18:50] church amen when I flew down to New New
[1:18:52] Zealand amen I didn't get off the plane
[1:18:54] and walk around and ask where I could
[1:18:56] preach or if there was a church open or
[1:18:59] if somebody would let me say something
[1:19:01] in their puppet I came here amen under
[1:19:03] an assignment I had a specific place to
[1:19:06] go I had a specific time to be there oh
[1:19:09] Church of the Living God that's why
[1:19:11] we're not wandering through denomination
[1:19:14] because God sent a message and he sent
[1:19:16] us to an AGS to fulfill the promises of
[1:19:19] that message when God calls you when God
[1:19:22] calls you to be something brother B said
[1:19:24] if God wants you to be a certain thing
[1:19:26] he brings you to this earth to be that
[1:19:29] and you will be it well tell that devil
[1:19:32] God didn't call me here to be defeated
[1:19:34] so I ain't going to be defeated he
[1:19:36] didn't call me here to be depressed so I
[1:19:39] refused to be depressed he didn't call
[1:19:41] me here to be confused amen so I refuse
[1:19:45] to walk underneath the influence of
[1:19:47] Babylonian confusion but he called me
[1:19:50] here to be an overcomer he called me
[1:19:53] here to be a messiah
[1:19:55] hallelujah amen when God calls he calls
[1:19:58] by a Divine call I think of what Isaiah
[1:20:01] said in Isaiah 426 he said I the Lord
[1:20:04] have called thee in righteousness and
[1:20:06] will hold thine hand and will keep thee
[1:20:09] and will give thee for a covenant of the
[1:20:11] people amen for a light of the Gentiles
[1:20:14] I want to say this as plain as I know
[1:20:16] how God has called you and he has
[1:20:19] ordained you amen by his Spirit to this
[1:20:23] message
[1:20:25] somebody shout back
[1:20:26] message oh say it like you're awake
[1:20:29] message I know it's got an embarrassing
[1:20:32] to say it but I'm not embarrassed to say
[1:20:34] I am a follower of the message of the
[1:20:37] hour listen I know it's gotten ashamed
[1:20:40] Amen to stand behind a pull pit and read
[1:20:42] a quote but I'm not ashamed to say what
[1:20:45] a prophet said listen amen somebody say
[1:20:47] well if you say it you're going to lose
[1:20:48] your reputation news flash I don't have
[1:20:51] one so I'm a very dangerous person I
[1:20:55] don't have a reputation to keep I have
[1:20:57] been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:00] I have been redeemed from the hand of my
[1:21:03] enemy and God has opened my eyes to see
[1:21:06] my purpose in this age is to believe
[1:21:08] what William brandham taught on every
[1:21:11] scripture in the age I'm living
[1:21:13] in hallelujah hallelujah listen that's
[1:21:16] the dangerous thing about somebody that
[1:21:18] don't have a reputation I don't have to
[1:21:20] worry about keeping it I was a nobody
[1:21:23] when God called me I was a nobody on the
[1:21:26] Backwoods of East Tennessee amen hunting
[1:21:29] and fishing and enjoying nature but God
[1:21:31] saw fit to open my eyes to this word
[1:21:34] listen I refuse I refuse to believe
[1:21:37] anything apart from what a prophet has
[1:21:40] revealed in the age I'm living
[1:21:43] in Hallelujah somebody say you lost your
[1:21:47] mind brother Andrew I've come too far to
[1:21:49] turn back now I sitting over in my room
[1:21:51] today and just looked at the calendar
[1:21:54] and 15 years ago today I preached my
[1:21:56] very first sermon as a 13year old boy 15
[1:22:00] years amen I've spent studying this
[1:22:02] message and listen to these tapes if you
[1:22:05] think I'm going to back up now and let
[1:22:07] some intellectual ungodly devil confuse
[1:22:09] the minds of the redeemed of the Lord
[1:22:11] you're crazy I say let this mind that
[1:22:14] was in Christ Jesus be also in you and
[1:22:18] whatever the word done in him it'll do
[1:22:20] the same thing in
[1:22:22] you you're here for a purpose this then
[1:22:27] is the message I love that which we have
[1:22:30] heard of him and we declare unto you
[1:22:33] that God is
[1:22:34] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:22:38] look at this word message it is an
[1:22:41] announcement it is a promise it is the
[1:22:43] act of promising it is a promise given
[1:22:46] or to be given it is a promise good or
[1:22:50] blessing brother BR comes along and why
[1:22:52] it had to be Shepherd the high of Heaven
[1:22:55] came down to make himself known to the
[1:22:58] lowest of the earth he was bypassing all
[1:23:01] between to make himself known to Common
[1:23:04] herdsmen amen coming to give these
[1:23:07] common herdsmen the greatest message Of
[1:23:10] All Times listen when God decided to
[1:23:13] declare himself on Earth he did not go
[1:23:15] to the temples and employ the rabbis he
[1:23:18] did not go to the temples and employ the
[1:23:21] lawyers and the scribes but he had
[1:23:23] already employed some Shepherds On The
[1:23:25] Backs side of the hills there had been
[1:23:28] many great Messengers we could think of
[1:23:30] Noah's day and the prophets and the
[1:23:32] great priests the Great learn men the
[1:23:34] Kings the potentates the monarchs but
[1:23:36] here comes here he comes with the
[1:23:38] greatest of all the messages what was
[1:23:41] the message are you ready for this
[1:23:43] Messiah is here now yes sir and to make
[1:23:47] that known he bypassed all the trained
[1:23:51] and made it known to Humble Shepherds
[1:23:53] now sometimes I get to studying and
[1:23:55] brother N I just get to thinking about
[1:23:57] things and sometimes I maybe get a
[1:23:59] little far out there amen but I just got
[1:24:01] to thinking one day that God had to
[1:24:03] choose some dumb old Shepherds that
[1:24:05] didn't have no education to run and tell
[1:24:08] the people Messiah is here because if he
[1:24:10] would have taken some educated men they
[1:24:12] would have made education the filter for
[1:24:15] the greatest message that ever come that
[1:24:17] the Messiah was on the earth and they
[1:24:19] would have so diluted it and watered it
[1:24:21] down to where he couldn't be the Messiah
[1:24:23] because of his background and he
[1:24:25] couldn't be the Messiah because of what
[1:24:27] city he come out of but God just found
[1:24:29] some old Shepherds that didn't have
[1:24:32] nothing better to say than just to say
[1:24:34] what a prophet said oh Church of the
[1:24:36] Living God can I tell you something amen
[1:24:39] God will bypass Aristocrats he will
[1:24:41] bypass hierarchies and he will raise up
[1:24:44] somebody on the islands of New Zealand
[1:24:47] that don't have no social standing they
[1:24:49] got a lot of stars and a lot of things
[1:24:51] against them but he's just looking for
[1:24:53] somebody who will declare the Messiah is
[1:24:57] here now in 1960s a prophet walked to a
[1:25:01] platform and he said this is my message
[1:25:03] it's different from the pastor it's
[1:25:05] different from the Evangelist he said my
[1:25:08] message my Ministry is to declare him
[1:25:11] he's here see God passed somebody's and
[1:25:14] declared the key message the greatest
[1:25:17] message by noodies somebody wonders why
[1:25:20] that we shout like we shout and why we
[1:25:23] Rejoice like we rejoice
[1:25:25] somebody told me one time brother Taz
[1:25:27] they said there's a lot of odd people
[1:25:28] around that message there's a lot of
[1:25:30] weird people around the message there's
[1:25:32] a lot of strange people and I got to
[1:25:34] thinking about that and then it dawned
[1:25:36] on me you know why because this is the
[1:25:38] only message he gives everybody
[1:25:42] chance it don't matter where you come
[1:25:44] from it don't matter what social
[1:25:46] standing what level of Education who
[1:25:48] your mama was who your daddy was there
[1:25:51] is a message that has returned us back
[1:25:54] to that day on Calvary and the cross is
[1:25:57] still Level ground for every man woman
[1:25:59] boy and child hallelujah what is this
[1:26:02] this is an announcement it is a
[1:26:04] revealing that Christ is in his church
[1:26:07] he said upon my heart the Holy Spirit
[1:26:09] has laid this warning of conviction the
[1:26:12] church in this day should have this
[1:26:13] message because I believe that it is the
[1:26:16] most outstanding of the messages of the
[1:26:20] Bible because it reveals Christ in his
[1:26:23] church at this time then no one can have
[1:26:27] faith or know what they're doing or
[1:26:29] where they're going unless they have
[1:26:31] something to base their thought and
[1:26:33] their faith
[1:26:34] upon therefore if the scripture has
[1:26:38] revealed Christ to us in these last days
[1:26:41] and the condition of the time it would
[1:26:44] do good us to search it and find out
[1:26:47] where we're at listen we are in the lay
[1:26:49] out ofan age which is supposed to
[1:26:52] receive a message but it will won't be
[1:26:54] any kind of message it will be a
[1:26:57] scriptural message as a matter of fact
[1:26:59] Malachi 4 said amen that it would be a
[1:27:02] restoration message that would turn our
[1:27:05] hearts amen back to the faith of the
[1:27:07] original fathers can I say this we are
[1:27:10] not looking for a message we have the
[1:27:13] message come on Amen it's time to
[1:27:16] Rejoice Church we're not looking for the
[1:27:19] message we are in possession of the
[1:27:22] message when you're looking for
[1:27:24] something there's no room to Rejoice but
[1:27:26] when you found what you're looking
[1:27:28] for come on I can prove it to you by the
[1:27:31] Bible and St Luke chapter 15 The Bible
[1:27:34] says a woman lost the coin and she swept
[1:27:37] the entire house and said help me find
[1:27:39] the peace that was missing while she was
[1:27:41] sweeping or looking there was no
[1:27:44] rejoicing but the very minute she found
[1:27:47] the peace that was missing her looking
[1:27:49] turned into a rejoicing there was a
[1:27:52] Shepherd who had lost a sheep and he was
[1:27:54] searching for the sheep and while he was
[1:27:56] looking there was no rejoicing but when
[1:27:59] he found the Sheep he called all of them
[1:28:01] together and said Rejoice with me for
[1:28:04] the one that I had lost has been found
[1:28:06] well let's not stop there let's go to
[1:28:08] the prodical son there was a son who was
[1:28:12] out of his position in the father's
[1:28:14] Kingdom and the father knew he was going
[1:28:16] to return and the very minute that boy
[1:28:18] broke across the hill on his way back to
[1:28:21] his father's house his father said bring
[1:28:23] the patted calf bring forth the best
[1:28:26] robe put a pair of shoes upon his feet
[1:28:29] Put a Ring upon his hand and rejoice
[1:28:32] with
[1:28:34] me it ain't time to look it's time to
[1:28:37] Rejoice it's the king's message people
[1:28:40] say why do you all say that message of
[1:28:41] the hour thank you for asking 1965 the
[1:28:44] Rapture he said many of you strangers
[1:28:46] perhaps hear these men get up and make
[1:28:49] these remarks about a message of the
[1:28:51] hour and so forth what they're getting
[1:28:53] at is God's promise of this hour that
[1:28:57] what he promised he would do and we see
[1:29:00] him scripturally vindicating exactly
[1:29:03] what he said he would do in the same
[1:29:05] manner listen it foretold it hits
[1:29:08] exactly perfectly each time because it's
[1:29:11] God saying it recognizing your day and
[1:29:14] it's message don't you see the message
[1:29:16] of the hour can't you recognize where we
[1:29:18] are at the message itself from the
[1:29:22] scripture interprets to you the hour
[1:29:25] that we're living in see it's the
[1:29:27] interpretation then can I say this the
[1:29:30] bride of Christ is the living
[1:29:33] interpretation of the word of God in
[1:29:35] this hour 1963 question answers on the
[1:29:38] seals brother Brandon would the bride of
[1:29:40] Christ have a Ministry before the
[1:29:42] Rapture oh sure that's what's going on
[1:29:45] right now see the bride of Christ amen
[1:29:48] certainly it is the message of the hour
[1:29:53] the bride of Christ she is consisting of
[1:29:55] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:29:57] and pastors is that right the bride of
[1:29:59] Christ sure she's got a Ministry it's a
[1:30:03] great ministry it's the ministry of the
[1:30:05] hour but it will be so humble now let me
[1:30:09] say this the message of the hour is the
[1:30:12] promise to see Jesus like you all
[1:30:15] remember zakus amen what he wanted to do
[1:30:18] he wanted to see Jesus the prophet of
[1:30:20] God said so he climbed up the tree and
[1:30:22] he got up there and he found where two
[1:30:25] limbs come together and they met in the
[1:30:27] trunk of the tree and there he sit down
[1:30:30] now that's a good place to sit see we're
[1:30:32] two ways meet yours and God's your idea
[1:30:35] and his that's a good time to sit down
[1:30:38] and take it over your own thoughts about
[1:30:41] him and what his word says He is what
[1:30:43] you think he is and what the word says
[1:30:46] He is listen that's a good place to sit
[1:30:49] down listen what the message of the hour
[1:30:52] is to your thinking what the message of
[1:30:54] the hour is to his word listen there's a
[1:30:57] big difference between the message of
[1:30:59] the hour to your thinking and the
[1:31:01] message of the hour to his word
[1:31:04] according to your thinking some have
[1:31:05] made it legalism according to your
[1:31:08] thinking some have made it condemnation
[1:31:10] and judgment and a bunch of dos and
[1:31:12] don'ts and rituals and ideas but
[1:31:14] according to God's word it is the shout
[1:31:18] of the king in the camp according to
[1:31:20] God's word it is the evening l
[1:31:23] prophesied by Zechariah according to
[1:31:25] God's word it is the quickening power of
[1:31:28] Romans chapter 8 according to God's word
[1:31:31] it is the announcing that the Rapture is
[1:31:34] in progress by the authority of the word
[1:31:36] of God listen I don't care what your
[1:31:38] thinking thinks about this message you
[1:31:40] say why because I don't care what mine
[1:31:44] thinks well we might as well preach
[1:31:47] somebody told me one time hey said
[1:31:48] brother Andrew you need to come over my
[1:31:49] house and sit down and let me share you
[1:31:51] my ideas and views on this subject and
[1:31:54] then you can go preach it I said brother
[1:31:56] save your time I ain't going to go
[1:31:58] preach it he said 'why not I said cuz I
[1:32:00] don't even preach my own views so why
[1:32:03] would I preach yours if I Don't Preach
[1:32:06] mine see I'm employed to a message I'm
[1:32:10] dedicated to a message God called me to
[1:32:13] a message I can't say nothing else but
[1:32:16] what my employer tells me to
[1:32:19] say hallelujah what do you say this
[1:32:22] message is then I'll tell what a prophet
[1:32:24] said he said we're not come together to
[1:32:26] talk about the message we are come
[1:32:28] together to get in the message are y'all
[1:32:31] ready for this and the message is
[1:32:35] Christ that ought to put a devil on the
[1:32:38] run right there the message is Christ he
[1:32:42] is the
[1:32:43] word that's right we're to get into it
[1:32:46] to get beneath
[1:32:50] it so we don't get above the message
[1:32:56] we get in it and we get under it we get
[1:33:01] beneath it that's what we're supposed to
[1:33:03] do see the message of the hour is this
[1:33:06] apply the token in Exodus 12 he said I
[1:33:10] will pass through the land of Egypt but
[1:33:14] I will pass over you and the plague
[1:33:16] shall not be upon you see pass over you
[1:33:20] because you're under the token
[1:33:22] Hallelujah amen he's got to pass over
[1:33:25] you because of what you're
[1:33:28] under Hallelujah he's got to go over
[1:33:32] your home because of what you're under
[1:33:35] he only recognizes the token that's the
[1:33:38] message of the hour that's the message
[1:33:40] of this day that's the message of this
[1:33:42] time in the name of Jesus Christ receive
[1:33:46] it come on Rahab amen everything around
[1:33:50] you is coming down but brother B said
[1:33:52] this he said but anyone knows about the
[1:33:54] Bible knows that that Harlot was
[1:33:57] predestinated listen I am a firm
[1:33:59] believer that Joshua was a predestinated
[1:34:02] ordained prophet of God who sent two
[1:34:04] spies into the land of come on who sent
[1:34:08] two spies in the land amen and found
[1:34:10] rahab's house oh Church found rahab's
[1:34:13] house and said apply the token and
[1:34:16] whatever is underneath this token when
[1:34:19] the battle breaks out will be spared
[1:34:21] from destruction I love what brother
[1:34:24] says he says Rahab stopped the two spies
[1:34:26] and he said this he said Rahab she
[1:34:29] looked at him and said are you sure they
[1:34:31] said oh we're confident everything she
[1:34:35] said everything that I get underneath
[1:34:36] this token will be spared they said
[1:34:39] everything everything under oh God
[1:34:42] everything underneath that token will be
[1:34:45] spared in the hour of the war brother B
[1:34:47] said like this he said Rahab went to
[1:34:49] work she got her mama under that token
[1:34:52] she got her babies and her family
[1:34:54] everybody she could because she knew
[1:34:57] there was a destruction on its way oh
[1:34:59] Wellington New Zealand hear me tonight
[1:35:02] there's a judgment coming there's a
[1:35:04] tribulation coming but before judgment
[1:35:07] comes there's a message that has been
[1:35:09] revealed and if you can go to work and
[1:35:11] get your family and your babies and your
[1:35:13] loved ones underneath this token
[1:35:16] everything underneath this message will
[1:35:18] be
[1:35:20] spared Hallelujah I don't care how it
[1:35:23] looks right now that's the word of the
[1:35:24] Lord and I believe
[1:35:27] it
[1:35:29] Hallelujah somebody say well that's
[1:35:31] crazy he said she believed the
[1:35:40] message now I know the devil hates these
[1:35:43] kind of
[1:35:44] quotes but let's just get it out in the
[1:35:49] open William Mary and brandom the real
[1:35:52] brother brandom never taught stay home
[1:35:53] and not go to
[1:35:58] church the real brother bam never taught
[1:36:00] that
[1:36:02] hogw now come on Church brother Ben can
[1:36:05] I
[1:36:06] preach are you hearing me but men
[1:36:09] without the Holy Ghost have got a hold
[1:36:11] of quotes and misinterpret them and now
[1:36:14] they say things like see we're following
[1:36:16] Rahab who didn't have a church to go to
[1:36:19] so she just played tapes in her home so
[1:36:21] if you want to be the bride be like
[1:36:24] Rahab and just stay home and play a tape
[1:36:27] listen I know I was born at night but it
[1:36:29] wasn't last
[1:36:30] night and I'm not ignorant I know this
[1:36:33] there was no other churches for her to
[1:36:35] go to in Jericho but a devil has invaded
[1:36:38] this message and it's got entire
[1:36:40] families and churches staying home and
[1:36:43] pushing play and letting the church sit
[1:36:45] empty when they say well there's nowhere
[1:36:47] to go to that is a Lie from the pits of
[1:36:49] Hell there's people sitting at home
[1:36:51] streaming churches hundreds and
[1:36:53] thousands miles away with five churches
[1:36:55] within 20 minutes of their house I'll
[1:36:57] tell you what it is it's a lukewarm
[1:36:59] devil that's trying to squash the
[1:37:01] authority of the ministry of the Bride
[1:37:04] of Jesus Christ but on the infallibility
[1:37:06] of Hebrews 10:25 I say forsake not the
[1:37:10] assembling of yourselves together that
[1:37:13] much more as you see the day
[1:37:16] approaching come on get out of this layo
[1:37:19] of see of lukew stream of nonsense we're
[1:37:22] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:29] it's a devil it's not the message it's a
[1:37:33] devil and I don't care what name we tack
[1:37:35] to it you show me one quote where
[1:37:37] brother ever T that nonsense but I'll
[1:37:39] show you hundreds where he said if God
[1:37:41] is in your heart you can't wait for them
[1:37:43] doors to get open he said if God is in
[1:37:46] your heart and you've been saved you
[1:37:48] won't stay home on Wednesday night and
[1:37:50] watch We Love Sushi he said you'll go to
[1:37:52] prayer meeting and you'll pray until the
[1:37:55] Holy Ghost comes in the church and
[1:37:57] changes
[1:37:59] situations that's what the real brother
[1:38:01] brandham
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:07] taught I don't know it's the message or
[1:38:10] nothing either we believe what he taught
[1:38:12] or we don't believe it at
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:17] all y'all forgive me but I guess it's
[1:38:20] the Evangelist coming out tonight get
[1:38:22] back in the house of
[1:38:25] God get off your pity party get off of
[1:38:28] your excuses get off of who didn't shake
[1:38:30] your hand and who didn't give you a
[1:38:32] cookie and who didn't invite you over
[1:38:34] for tea and get back in the house of God
[1:38:37] and begin to be what God called you to
[1:38:39] [Applause]
[1:38:49] be I think that devil got out of here
[1:38:53] we're
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] Believers and if anybody tells you
[1:38:59] different take them back to where the
[1:39:00] Prophet
[1:39:03] said well I guess that spirit's just
[1:39:05] lingering but I'm sorry I'm not a coward
[1:39:07] I won't back
[1:39:09] up we're going to have an entire gener
[1:39:12] we're already got entire generation that
[1:39:14] don't know what it means to go to church
[1:39:16] they don't know how to be deacons oh God
[1:39:19] they don't know how to conduct a church
[1:39:21] service because a devil CRA up out of
[1:39:23] hell and has convinced this generation
[1:39:25] that the house of God is not important
[1:39:28] but if this is the last sermon I ever
[1:39:29] preach let my voice go on record and say
[1:39:32] this the house of God is the most
[1:39:35] important place you'll go for the entire
[1:39:37] week it's where you pray together it's
[1:39:39] where you shout together it's where you
[1:39:42] sing and you enjoy the blessings of
[1:39:44] Elohim I say Old Church of the Living
[1:39:47] God rise and Shake yourself and put your
[1:39:50] walking shoes on and walk back to the
[1:39:52] house of God
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:56] and back the man of God back the message
[1:39:59] of the
[1:40:02] hour this is a message it's not a
[1:40:06] playground this is a message it's not a
[1:40:08] boys club it's not a social hall it's
[1:40:11] not a community center it's a place of
[1:40:15] transformation it's more than just
[1:40:17] seeing who can out sing who and who can
[1:40:19] out preach who and who can write a
[1:40:21] better song than who it's about a place
[1:40:23] where the pillar of fire comes down and
[1:40:26] lives are changed and homes are put back
[1:40:30] together hallelujah hallelujah I believe
[1:40:33] in a good oldfashioned Paul's Revival
[1:40:35] and the Bible Holy Ghost back in the
[1:40:38] church
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:41] again we know that God somebody shout
[1:40:45] amen out told me my or
[1:40:49] something but it's the truth anyhow
[1:40:53] now we know that God is perfected in
[1:40:55] threes the
[1:40:59] message my brother Andrew I would I stay
[1:41:01] home and listen why would I go to church
[1:41:03] and listen to a preacher that's got
[1:41:04] mistakes when I can stay home and listen
[1:41:06] to a
[1:41:07] prophet well obviously you ain't listen
[1:41:09] to much
[1:41:10] tapes cuz I listen to him every day of
[1:41:13] my life and he tells me over and over
[1:41:15] and over I'm a man I make mistakes I've
[1:41:17] got shortcoming
[1:41:23] either we believe it or we don't and if
[1:41:26] we don't let's get away from it but if
[1:41:28] we do let's give everything we are to
[1:41:31] it let's give everything we are to this
[1:41:35] message we know God is perfected in
[1:41:37] threes right brother says it like this
[1:41:40] he says now paraphrasing this message of
[1:41:43] the hour is going to come to us by a
[1:41:45] Vindicated Prophet which will have which
[1:41:47] will have three pools in his ministry in
[1:41:51] 1962 he says this and is this the sign
[1:41:53] of the in sir he says now is this that
[1:41:55] third poll he told me three or four
[1:41:57] years ago see the first PLL you remember
[1:42:00] what happened I tried to explain it he
[1:42:02] said don't do
[1:42:03] it the second pull he said don't try and
[1:42:07] I pulled anyhow but then he said now
[1:42:10] there's a third pull coming somebody say
[1:42:12] this with me a third pull
[1:42:15] coming there's a third pull coming but
[1:42:18] don't try to explain it you see he said
[1:42:20] now you know how I approach this tonight
[1:42:22] I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my
[1:42:25] church to say something you draw your
[1:42:27] own conclusion
[1:42:29] 1962 at the changing of the ministry he
[1:42:32] says the third pull is coming he said in
[1:42:35] paragraph 398 of the same sermon he said
[1:42:37] works that I do more than this shall you
[1:42:38] do see now watch he was in one person
[1:42:41] then but he's in the whole church now if
[1:42:44] this is the third pull then there's a
[1:42:46] great ministry line ahead I don't know I
[1:42:50] can't say I don't know so the third pull
[1:42:52] is coming there's a great ministry line
[1:42:54] ahead but in 1963 in the indictment he
[1:42:57] says may there come forth a Revival of
[1:42:59] the just and a great power come among
[1:43:02] the church just before it's going it's
[1:43:05] not hard to pray that because you
[1:43:07] promised it and we're looking Lord for
[1:43:09] that third pull that we know that it
[1:43:12] will do great things for us in our midst
[1:43:14] so the third pull is coming the third
[1:43:17] pull will have a great ministry now he
[1:43:19] says we're looking for that third pull
[1:43:21] 1963 why Christ speak God give me
[1:43:24] courage to take the sword of the word
[1:43:27] that he put in my hand about 33 years
[1:43:30] ago and hold it and March forward to the
[1:43:33] third pull is my prayer so now we've
[1:43:36] gone all the way from the third pull is
[1:43:38] coming to now we have a sword in our
[1:43:41] hand and he's marching forward to the
[1:43:43] third pole but in 1963 Christ is the
[1:43:46] mystery of God revealed he says
[1:43:48] paragraph 637 of course being spiritual
[1:43:51] you watch spiritual things not knowing
[1:43:53] this God Knows It But if you'll turn and
[1:43:56] look at the clock it's on the dot two
[1:43:58] o'clock the second pull amen the end of
[1:44:02] the second pull the third pull is at
[1:44:05] hand now we've gone all the way from the
[1:44:07] third pull is coming to now the second
[1:44:10] pull has come to its end and the third
[1:44:13] pull is at hand look at this word at
[1:44:15] hand it means
[1:44:19] nearby it means readily accessible it
[1:44:22] means when needed amen it is close in
[1:44:25] time I love this one brother Chris it
[1:44:27] means it's about to happen so when a
[1:44:30] prophet announces the third pull is at
[1:44:32] hand he's saying it's about to happen
[1:44:35] Daniel 12:4 thou oh Daniel shut up the
[1:44:39] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:44:41] of the end for many shall run to and fro
[1:44:44] and knowledge shall be increased in
[1:44:46] Revelation 13 blessed is he that readeth
[1:44:48] they that hear the words of this
[1:44:50] prophecy and keep those things which are
[1:44:53] written therein for the time is at hand
[1:44:56] Revelation 22:10 he saith unto me seal
[1:44:59] not the Saints of the prophecy of this
[1:45:02] book listen for the time is at hand in
[1:45:07] Daniel 12 he was told to seal it up
[1:45:09] until the time of the end but in
[1:45:12] Revelations 1 and 22 he says this the
[1:45:16] time is at hand brother BR picks this up
[1:45:19] in the church age book he said now the
[1:45:21] time was not at hand previous ly but in
[1:45:23] the wisdom and the economy of God the
[1:45:26] mighty Revelation though fully known to
[1:45:29] God could not come forth hither to he
[1:45:32] said thus we immediately learn a
[1:45:34] principle that the revelation of God for
[1:45:37] each age can only come in that age and
[1:45:40] at a specific time listen I'll say it
[1:45:43] like this a specific time to a specific
[1:45:46] people comes at a specific Revelation to
[1:45:49] accomplish a specific work look at the
[1:45:52] history of of Israel the revelation of
[1:45:54] God to Moses came only at a specific
[1:45:57] time in history and even more
[1:45:59] specifically it came as the people Cried
[1:46:02] unto God Jesus himself came at the
[1:46:05] fullness of time he being the complete
[1:46:07] revelation of the godhead but in this
[1:46:09] age leonos the revelation of God will
[1:46:14] come in its due time it will not falter
[1:46:18] and neither will it be premature think
[1:46:21] on this and heed it way
[1:46:23] for we are in the end time today now
[1:46:26] look here the third pull is at hand how
[1:46:29] can I overcome 63 paragraph 31 he says I
[1:46:33] can feel that the third pull is
[1:46:35] beginning to
[1:46:37] move you see within me Look Away to
[1:46:41] Jesus 63 paragraph 38 so now I'm going
[1:46:43] to say something to you now that I
[1:46:45] haven't said all along and that is the
[1:46:47] thing we've looked forward to for so
[1:46:49] long for at least many years four or
[1:46:51] five years or maybe longer the third
[1:46:53] pull has now been Vindicated and I'm
[1:46:57] sure you all know what it is let me say
[1:47:00] this only the spiritual will catch the
[1:47:02] third pull he goes on to say everyone
[1:47:04] knows that he said the third pull is
[1:47:07] properly identified we know where it is
[1:47:10] oh God I love this the third pull is
[1:47:14] here Church of the Living God we've gone
[1:47:17] all the way from the third pull is
[1:47:18] coming to now he says the third pull is
[1:47:21] here he said it's so safe
[1:47:23] I mustn't say much about it now watch
[1:47:25] the third pull then see It'll be
[1:47:28] absolutely to the total lost but it will
[1:47:31] be for the bride and the church
[1:47:34] hallelujah hallelujah the third pull is
[1:47:37] to the lost but it's for the bride
[1:47:40] listen Church there is no more doubt in
[1:47:42] my mind he says I know what the third
[1:47:44] pull is and I know what it does Shalom
[1:47:48] 64 he said the one time he said about
[1:47:51] the third pull how it would come by this
[1:47:53] one way then by knowing the heart and
[1:47:56] then the spoken word the first pull was
[1:47:59] to deal with the healing of the flesh
[1:48:02] the second pull was the Discerning of
[1:48:04] the spirit but when you come to that
[1:48:06] third pull it was going beyond the flesh
[1:48:09] it was going beyond the spirit the third
[1:48:11] pull come to the soul oh we all know
[1:48:15] that's the identification he says we
[1:48:17] know what the third pull is we all
[1:48:19] understand that you got your tape see I
[1:48:22] think it'll lay dormant for a little
[1:48:23] while until that great hour of
[1:48:25] persecution comes on that's when it'll
[1:48:27] be it'll speak it'll be manifested just
[1:48:30] like the five straight signs without
[1:48:32] failure now let me just go ahead and go
[1:48:34] all the way to the end of the message
[1:48:35] and not stop if that's okay what is or
[1:48:39] the anointed ones at the end time rather
[1:48:40] notice the very day when this messenger
[1:48:43] not when he starts on but when he begins
[1:48:45] to declare his message see the first
[1:48:47] pull is healing the second pull is
[1:48:50] prophesying but the third pull is the
[1:48:53] opening of the word it's the Mysteries
[1:48:56] revealed and there's no more higher
[1:48:58] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:49:02] but the only way he can be Vindicated is
[1:49:04] by the word and
[1:49:06] remember and remember the third pull was
[1:49:10] the opening of them Seven Seals to
[1:49:13] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:49:15] sealed in the word can I just go ahead
[1:49:18] and cut to the Chase and get it out
[1:49:19] there in the open is that okay the third
[1:49:22] pull is the
[1:49:25] message you were not ordained to a first
[1:49:27] pull you were not ordained to a second
[1:49:30] pull you was ordained to a third pull
[1:49:33] which was the opening of the word the
[1:49:36] revealing of the mysteries of God he
[1:49:38] said so I've Got My Mind Set On this
[1:49:40] message that's that third pull it's the
[1:49:43] one I must be loyal and reverent to what
[1:49:46] is the message friends it is the opening
[1:49:49] of the word in the church and by the
[1:49:51] power of the Revelation you are being
[1:49:54] transformed into the bride by the word
[1:49:58] brother B said here you are not years
[1:50:00] later you're just as much alive tonight
[1:50:03] as you was when you talked to the woman
[1:50:05] at the well it's God manifested in flesh
[1:50:08] amen now in the flesh of his bride for
[1:50:11] the bride and the husband is the same
[1:50:13] self flesh these two are one the church
[1:50:18] is becoming the bride by believing the
[1:50:21] word so that the word in the church
[1:50:23] becomes the same it's the word in the
[1:50:26] church that's making it the Bride come
[1:50:29] on friends it's not the church you go to
[1:50:31] that makes you the bride it's not the
[1:50:33] preacher you follow that makes you the
[1:50:35] bride what makes you the bride is the
[1:50:40] word the word in the flesh redeemed
[1:50:43] flesh transforming you into the word
[1:50:46] bride of God now I love in
[1:50:49] 1961 comes along and he preaches a
[1:50:51] series to us in three Parts you all got
[1:50:53] the books I know he calls it Daniel 70
[1:50:56] weeks he said now the first part is
[1:50:58] going to be Gabriel's instructions to
[1:51:00] Daniel you all familiar with that series
[1:51:02] let me see your hands you're familiar
[1:51:03] with Daniel 70 weeks he said see the
[1:51:05] six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to
[1:51:08] Daniel and then the last one was the
[1:51:10] 7eventh week of Daniel now when he opens
[1:51:12] that series he says we're speaking on
[1:51:15] Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying
[1:51:18] in to instruct him about the future
[1:51:23] my goodness while Daniel was in prayer
[1:51:26] Gabriel the Angel come in to instruct
[1:51:30] him now brother B said this he said I am
[1:51:33] Desiring an
[1:51:36] understanding he says not to be puffed
[1:51:38] up but what he was wanting was he was
[1:51:41] wanting Revelation to Enlighten the
[1:51:43] people of the future by the word are you
[1:51:47] with me the revelation of the message is
[1:51:51] the enlightening of the church of the
[1:51:52] future by the word it's not by
[1:51:56] charts it's not by eschatology teachers
[1:51:59] he said see I've been visiting the
[1:52:01] library in Kentucky some of those
[1:52:02] ancient astronomy of the calars and
[1:52:04] times and picking up from libraries and
[1:52:05] so forth all the ancient books that I
[1:52:07] can what little I can do in having my
[1:52:09] trust solemnly in Christ Jesus to reveal
[1:52:12] it to me because I do not want it to say
[1:52:15] I know this and I know that he knows my
[1:52:17] heart but I want it that I might
[1:52:20] Enlighten his people therefore or I
[1:52:23] believe he will give it to me I remember
[1:52:26] one time there was a guy a preacher and
[1:52:27] then he was on his way out of the
[1:52:29] message and he was doing everything he
[1:52:30] could to tear the message down you know
[1:52:32] everybody could get to listen he had
[1:52:33] something to say so one day he made the
[1:52:35] mistake AC crossing my
[1:52:37] path he said well brother Andrew he said
[1:52:40] I'll tell you right now he said one of
[1:52:41] these days you're going to find out amen
[1:52:43] that brother brandom studied Matthew
[1:52:45] Henry and Clark and all these
[1:52:47] commentaries and it's going to blow your
[1:52:49] mind he said you don't know that but one
[1:52:51] day you will I said brother I already
[1:52:53] knew that he kind of jumped back and he
[1:52:55] looked at me kind of bug eyed he said
[1:52:57] how did you know that I said cuz I got
[1:52:59] books and tapes where brother Bram told
[1:53:01] me he'd done that
[1:53:04] himself hello he says right here I'm
[1:53:08] going to libraries to find what I can on
[1:53:12] Daniel 70 weeks but beyond the education
[1:53:15] I am ried on spiritual Revelation to
[1:53:18] come into my heart and reveal to me the
[1:53:21] word of God what is this Revelation no
[1:53:24] matter how complicated it is God can
[1:53:26] break it down and he can make it so
[1:53:28] simple I love to study about Daniel do
[1:53:31] you all know that Daniel was about 12 or
[1:53:33] 14 years old when he went into
[1:53:37] captivity the Bible says in Daniel 18
[1:53:40] but Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[1:53:42] would not defile himself with a portion
[1:53:45] of the king's meat brother comes along
[1:53:47] in Investments and says Daniel was a
[1:53:50] prophet he said the words of God the
[1:53:52] Bible was invested to Daniel to manifest
[1:53:56] to the people that God still lived and
[1:53:59] Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[1:54:01] would not defile his investment so God
[1:54:05] ordained Daniel Hallelujah God ordained
[1:54:08] Daniel as a child before he was born to
[1:54:12] receive the investment of the word of
[1:54:14] God concerning the future of Israel
[1:54:16] through the prophet Jeremiah's message
[1:54:19] oh Church of the Living God list it's a
[1:54:22] parallel Daniel's day parallels our day
[1:54:26] see where Daniel was he was in Babylon
[1:54:28] which you know what Babylon means it
[1:54:30] means
[1:54:32] confusion remember said like this he
[1:54:34] said here we are privileged tonight to
[1:54:37] see the message of God and the angel of
[1:54:40] God in the day of confusion he said
[1:54:43] we're living in a day of confusion we're
[1:54:44] living in a day that when men and women
[1:54:46] hardly know what to do he said
[1:54:48] everything seems to be in a turmoil
[1:54:50] everything it seems to be there's so
[1:54:52] many ways to look he said that Satan to
[1:54:55] do that now amen y'all forgive me but
[1:54:58] brother Chris tried to get out of here
[1:54:59] easy this morning but I'm just going to
[1:55:01] go and read a quote okay American and
[1:55:03] Canadian people are the worst confused
[1:55:06] people in all the
[1:55:07] [Applause]
[1:55:09] world God bless you Buddy ain't going to
[1:55:12] put all that on us
[1:55:14] Americans I'm just
[1:55:18] kidding I'm going to find one on New
[1:55:20] Zealand I guarantee you I will
[1:55:23] the worst of all the confus now come on
[1:55:25] Church you all know that's the truth men
[1:55:28] going in women's bathrooms and women
[1:55:30] going in men's bathrooms and all of a
[1:55:33] sudden we live in a day and time where a
[1:55:34] baby can be born and live 15 years
[1:55:37] nature says it's a boy mama says it's a
[1:55:39] boy daddy says it's a boy science says
[1:55:42] it's a boy come on everything identifies
[1:55:45] that child as a boy but some morning he
[1:55:47] wakes up and says I think I'm a
[1:55:50] girl you see what's happening it's
[1:55:52] because it's a day of confusion what's
[1:55:56] happening is is God is bringing things
[1:55:58] to an end but before he oh God before he
[1:56:02] brings it to an end he forewarns now
[1:56:05] there's different ways that he gives us
[1:56:07] to Mark the times like if you look at
[1:56:09] lot amen lot marked it by Angels if you
[1:56:13] look at Abraham he marked his time by
[1:56:16] the visitation of the Angel of the Lord
[1:56:18] Elohim if you looked at Rahab she marked
[1:56:22] her by Messengers if you look at Noah he
[1:56:25] marked his by Revelation but if we'll
[1:56:27] slow down here and read in in Daniel 9:2
[1:56:30] it says this in the first year of his
[1:56:33] Reign I Daniel understood by
[1:56:38] books I Daniel understood by books the
[1:56:41] number of years look at this word
[1:56:43] understand it means to discern to
[1:56:46] distinguish to consider diligently amen
[1:56:49] the years the Lord the Lord came to
[1:56:50] Jeremiah the prophet he he would
[1:56:52] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[1:56:55] of Jerusalem and I set my face un the
[1:56:58] Lord God to seek by prayer and
[1:57:01] supplication with fasting and sackcloth
[1:57:04] and asked by Angels Abraham by Elohim
[1:57:08] Rahab by Messengers Noah by Revelation
[1:57:11] but Daniel by
[1:57:13] books is this okay Daniel discerned the
[1:57:17] Times by the books he was reading and
[1:57:20] those books was moving him am to
[1:57:23] desperation said when the vision came in
[1:57:26] BC 538 from 606 Le 68 years he had been
[1:57:31] in Babylon amongst heathens and still
[1:57:34] had the victory my goodness 68 years in
[1:57:39] a heathen Empire but Daniel still had
[1:57:42] the victory by the books he was
[1:57:46] reading oh Church of the Living God hey
[1:57:49] you got some books you know what they're
[1:57:51] called they're called spoken word books
[1:57:53] they're called a seven seal book They're
[1:57:55] called a church age book They're called
[1:57:57] an adoption book listen friends we're in
[1:57:59] the middle of Leona but I want to put
[1:58:02] that devil on notice I have not lost the
[1:58:07] victory I still have the victory in my
[1:58:10] soul hey Daniel stood alone but he had
[1:58:14] some
[1:58:15] books 68 years he was undefiled before
[1:58:18] God without the baptism of the Holy
[1:58:21] Ghost with without the blood of Jesus
[1:58:23] Christ to make intercession for him with
[1:58:25] only the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:58:28] heers listen in Heathen Traditions
[1:58:30] Daniel no church to go to no songs to
[1:58:33] sing but Daniel the Prophet of the Lord
[1:58:36] would consult Jeremiah's
[1:58:40] books and if the church listen he said
[1:58:43] oh what a shame it is to us he said
[1:58:45] those books caused Daniel to go into
[1:58:47] prayer and supplication he said now
[1:58:50] listen he said how can spend wasteless
[1:58:53] time
[1:58:54] gambling swiming holes on Sunday I know
[1:58:58] this ain't popular preaching no more but
[1:58:59] it's still in the
[1:59:01] message no time for the Lord just run
[1:59:04] down and if the pastor speaks on
[1:59:05] something or other you don't like you
[1:59:06] just get up and go
[1:59:08] out if the church holds too long while
[1:59:11] you're dissatisfied look at our
[1:59:13] condition look at what we're doing and
[1:59:16] compare our life with
[1:59:19] Daniel no church no Fellowship was Tor
[1:59:23] down and burned down his City and his
[1:59:26] people was captive but for 68
[1:59:31] years he held the victory by laying in
[1:59:35] Jeremiah's books oh Church see before I
[1:59:39] I want you to catch this before Daniel
[1:59:41] went into captivity there was a Prophet
[1:59:44] Jeremiah who was ordained to bring a
[1:59:49] message and brother tazwell there was a
[1:59:51] day in
[1:59:52] who was ordained to receive the message
[1:59:56] Jeremiah was ordained to bring B said
[1:59:59] like this he said this he said see in
[2:00:02] Jeremiah in Jeremiah CH
[2:00:04] 25:3 I will bring upon that land of all
[2:00:06] my words which I pronounced against it
[2:00:08] even all that is written in this book
[2:00:12] which Jeremiah hath prophesied against
[2:00:14] all the nations now listen friends amen
[2:00:17] God smoked that now now you all know
[2:00:19] that there was a true Prophet right
[2:00:22] and whenever there's a true Prophet
[2:00:24] there's always a false prophet that
[2:00:26] comes behind the true prophet and now
[2:00:28] there was a false prophet followed
[2:00:30] Jeremiah and he says this he said listen
[2:00:32] he said don't you all worry he said God
[2:00:35] told me amen listen God done told me
[2:00:38] that what Jeremiah said ain't right B
[2:00:40] said but God smoke that false prophet
[2:00:42] and took his life that same year because
[2:00:45] God had told his true Prophet that there
[2:00:47] was 70 years now I just want you I just
[2:00:50] want you to catch something with me okay
[2:00:52] okay are you with me Daniel is in
[2:00:54] captivity and he goes before the Lord to
[2:00:57] receive a revelation concerning his
[2:01:00] future and he does it but when he goes
[2:01:02] before the Lord bam said this he says
[2:01:05] Gabriel appeared to reveal not only what
[2:01:06] he was asking about but to tell him all
[2:01:10] the way down what was determined for the
[2:01:12] Jewish race all the way to the
[2:01:16] consummation don't you all love studying
[2:01:18] a prophet brother he says this he said
[2:01:21] he asked ask a little
[2:01:24] bit are y'all ready for this Daniel went
[2:01:28] before God and ask a little bit but he
[2:01:31] got the whole
[2:01:37] thing some of y'all can Shout with me on
[2:01:39] this point you remember when you got
[2:01:42] saved you were just looking for
[2:01:44] salvation you were just looking for a
[2:01:46] better way to live you were just looking
[2:01:48] to get free from tormenting spirits and
[2:01:50] free from your first na
[2:01:52] and listen you weren't looking for all
[2:01:54] these things but there was a seed in
[2:01:56] your
[2:01:57] soul and you just said God save me and
[2:02:01] Deliver Me From The Wretched Man I am
[2:02:03] but God who is rich in Mercy he didn't
[2:02:06] just give you a little bit he gave you
[2:02:08] Seven Seals he gave you the serpent seed
[2:02:11] he gave you predestination he gave you
[2:02:13] the seven trumpets he gave you the seven

[2:02:20] the Living God if anybody got a rightous
[2:02:23] shout is the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[2:02:27] just asked for a little bit but we got
[2:02:29] the whole
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:33] thing Glory Glory Glory we got the whole
[2:02:37] thing church we got the whole word and
[2:02:41] when Daniel received that my
[2:02:45] goodness when Daniel received that I
[2:02:48] love what the Bible says the Bible said
[2:02:51] Jeremiah
[2:02:54] made them
[2:02:55] drink in other words Jeremiah I give you
[2:02:59] this message but don't you sit
[2:03:03] still don't you stay in one place but
[2:03:06] prophesy to all the nations you see he
[2:03:09] just put the word out there and it made
[2:03:12] them all mad at
[2:03:15] him now notice Here We Go Again Jeremiah
[2:03:21] didn't stay home
[2:03:28] Jeremiah didn't just stay in one little
[2:03:30] spot but he made all the nations to
[2:03:33] drink of it now what was he making them
[2:03:35] drink of the wine of the word listen and
[2:03:39] Daniel drank it I love this and Jeremiah
[2:03:42] took the word of the Lord the wine of
[2:03:43] his word and the wine is the power of
[2:03:46] His word see wine has a power and wine
[2:03:50] is an intoxication
[2:03:52] it's got a power behind
[2:03:54] it so Daniel was in captivity looking at
[2:03:58] all these Heathen Traditions no
[2:04:00] Fellowship no blood No sacrifice no
[2:04:04] Fellowship to go to no songs to sing but
[2:04:07] he had some
[2:04:09] books and Daniel got to drinking and
[2:04:12] eating on those books you know what the
[2:04:14] Bible says the Bible says he got drunk
[2:04:16] on the wine of Jeremiah's message now

[2:08:52] bags but they were full of some
[2:08:54] intoxication brother

[2:09:31] can't I can't but if you get drunk one
[2:09:34] time you'll look at that mountain and
[2:09:37] say I'll climb you if it takes me all my
[2:09:40] life we've laid down and said I can't
[2:09:42] take the Rapture I can't overcome I
[2:09:45] can't believe this message but I say to
[2:09:47] you tonight hear ye the word of the Lord
[2:09:50] there is a stimulation of Revelation
[2:09:53] there is an intoxication of the holy
[2:09:56] ghost in the house of
[2:09:58] God it'll cause you to get drunk till
[2:10:00] you believe things that you don't think
[2:10:02] will ever
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:05] happen what are you saying preacher I'm
[2:10:08] saying God oh my I've run out of
[2:10:11] time God opened the
[2:10:16] revelation of Israel's future through a
[2:10:19] prophet's message Jeremiah
[2:10:22] and he ordained a 12 14y old boy the
[2:10:26] Bible says he put this
[2:10:31] treasure in
[2:10:35] earn brother said do you see what God
[2:10:37] did he never revealed it to the hind
[2:10:39] prudent so they could fuss about it all
[2:10:41] this time but he put it in an Earthly
[2:10:43] vessel and he created himself his own
[2:10:47] son Christ Jesus and in the last days
[2:10:50] now he's opening the and showing it to
[2:10:52] his church kept it in an Earthly vessel
[2:10:55] so it wouldn't rot or rust listen it's
[2:10:58] been kept wrapped in the vessel of the
[2:10:59] earth that was redeemed out of the Earth
[2:11:01] come up on Easter morning where death
[2:11:02] seals couldn not hold him any longer but
[2:11:04] he broke the seals and Rose up and prove
[2:11:06] himself in the last days he's alive he's
[2:11:08] in his church and in this last days he's
[2:11:13] revealing it by his own presence among
[2:11:15] his people he got somebody he can get
[2:11:18] the world out of and the things out of
[2:11:22] the church anty out of so he can speak
[2:11:25] through them and reveal and open these
[2:11:27] seals listen just the same as Gabriel
[2:11:31] come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to
[2:11:33] the
[2:11:34] church in the last days to reveal these
[2:11:38] great deep secret things I've run out of
[2:11:40] time but can I could I could I buy five
[2:11:42] minutes 10 minutes would that would that
[2:11:44] honestly be okay Revelation and
[2:11:47] understanding has come to you and has
[2:11:50] made you a prophetic class of people let
[2:11:52] me say this understanding brother says
[2:11:54] this in the last days we're given the
[2:11:56] understanding by the word that we're
[2:11:58] going to understand it because it'll
[2:12:00] come an Ephesian to it now brother B
[2:12:03] goes in this he says I understand
[2:12:04] there'll come scoffers in the last days
[2:12:06] I understand there'll be tidle waves in
[2:12:08] the last days I understand there'll be
[2:12:10] fearful sights I understand organization
[2:12:12] women will Bob off their hair in the
[2:12:14] last days they'll wear short clothes and
[2:12:15] walk with highill shoes tinkling as they
[2:12:17] go in the last days I understand the
[2:12:19] morale will be very low in the last days
[2:12:21] understand that preachers will be false
[2:12:23] shepherds in the last days and they'll
[2:12:24] compromise will not feed the people the
[2:12:26] word of God but will'll go after Creeds
[2:12:28] and things instead but I
[2:12:31] understand there'll come a voice in the
[2:12:33] last days crying out of the Wilderness
[2:12:35] calling the people back to the original
[2:12:38] message back to the things of God I
[2:12:41] understand by the books these things
[2:12:43] will take place listen friends you're
[2:12:46] not here as just church members you are
[2:12:48] here as people who have come underneath
[2:12:51] the influence of prophetic word you say
[2:12:54] influence yes sir brother B said this he
[2:12:56] said we could just give you scripture
[2:12:57] after scripture see the last stage is a
[2:13:00] prophetic message to the church calling
[2:13:02] them back to the original word will you
[2:13:08] agree with me we have come under
[2:13:10] prophetic
[2:13:12] utterance can I say this as clear as I
[2:13:14] know how we are not going back to the
[2:13:17] second pull
[2:13:22] hello we're not going backwards Church
[2:13:25] we're going
[2:13:27] forward why would we go back to the
[2:13:29] permissive will when we have the perfect
[2:13:32] will the Bible says in the days of the
[2:13:34] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[2:13:36] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[2:13:39] be finished as he has began as he had
[2:13:41] declared rather to his servants the
[2:13:43] prophets he said now to this to do this
[2:13:46] is prophetic utterance of the spirit
[2:13:47] that foresees what will be what has been
[2:13:51] and what is now brother said this when
[2:13:53] prophetic utterance comes you see now
[2:13:55] now how many will obey prophetic
[2:13:57] utterance he said you see well if I told
[2:14:00] you to put that crutch on his shoulder
[2:14:02] and he would not have done it he had
[2:14:03] have went right back out there just as
[2:14:05] crippled went back home in a worse shape
[2:14:07] than he was when he come see it always
[2:14:09] does that just what the inspiration says
[2:14:11] do what the holy spirit is giving that
[2:14:13] prophetic utterance if it surely knows
[2:14:15] your life and who you are and knows what
[2:14:18] you have been it'll know what you will
[2:14:22] be can I say this this Prophet has
[2:14:25] already been in your
[2:14:29] future he's already been in your future
[2:14:33] he says I believe that I was born as a
[2:14:35] prophetic utterance many people call it
[2:14:37] one thing or another I don't know what
[2:14:39] it is he said don't have to be anything
[2:14:41] called anything but just so it gets the
[2:14:43] results for the Lord Jesus and his
[2:14:46] people listen prophetic utterance come
[2:14:49] underneath the fourth anointing which
[2:14:51] was the eagle the prophetic age listen
[2:14:54] when God would lead his people by
[2:14:56] prophetic utterance now let me say this
[2:14:59] to you when prophetic utterance comes in
[2:15:01] the church it brings a real
[2:15:05] change in other words things look
[2:15:09] hopeless
[2:15:11] situations look
[2:15:16] permanent Journeys look like they have
[2:15:19] final destinations
[2:15:21] decisions look like they can never be
[2:15:24] changed but I'm reminded the valley of
[2:15:26] dry
[2:15:30] bones I'm reminded that Ezekiel walked
[2:15:33] out there and he looked across this
[2:15:35] entire valley of dry bones brother Taz
[2:15:39] it looked
[2:15:40] final brother Isaac it looked like it
[2:15:42] was over it looked like it was the end
[2:15:46] but but Ezekiel walked out there and he
[2:15:48] said Can these bones live
[2:15:52] again Lord thou
[2:15:55] knowest son of
[2:15:59] man

[2:23:07] changing do you know things are
[2:23:09] happening right here in this meeting and
[2:23:10] you may not see it feel
[2:23:13] it but according to the message of the
[2:23:15] hour brother man would leave thousands
[2:23:17] of meetings and he would say this he
[2:23:18] would say Pastors in the the days to
[2:23:21] come you're going to hear testimonies of
[2:23:22] what God has done months and years after
[2:23:25] I'm
[2:23:26] gone Church of the Living
[2:23:29] God you know why because it wasn't
[2:23:36] him it was the prevailing
[2:23:38] Revelation that had been restored to the
[2:23:41] church let me say this God just needs
[2:23:44] somebody to say what a prophet
[2:23:48] said God just needs somebody
[2:23:51] to call these this message these
[2:23:53] promises present
[2:23:58] tense God needs
[2:24:00] somebody God needs a young person to
[2:24:03] stand up and say this is more than a
[2:24:06] religion this is more than something
[2:24:08] daddy preaches or mama taught me this is
[2:24:14] god this is my hope this is my future
[2:24:21] I don't know how else to say that than
[2:24:23] this break open the books
[2:24:27] [Music]
[2:24:28] again break them
[2:24:31] open he said brother Andrew I don't I
[2:24:33] don't I just don't think things can
[2:24:36] change the doctor

[2:24:43] third pool say about
[2:24:46] it do we do do
[2:24:50] do we
[2:24:52] believe or do we just take the doctor's
[2:24:54] word as the final say
[2:24:56] something you know I say this God just
[2:24:58] needs somebody to preach this message
[2:25:01] somebody say well I tell you right now
[2:25:02] by the preach of the message things
[2:25:03] can't change hey you've come too late to
[2:25:05] tell us
[2:25:07] that several years ago brother brother
[2:25:09] Wayne Lawson was over in Norway
[2:25:11] preaching and while he was preaching he
[2:25:13] would standing there and somebody say
[2:25:14] well
[2:25:15] people I guess I'm just feeling too much
[2:25:17] at home right now but people say people
[2:25:20] say some really let me be correct with
[2:25:22] this they say some really silly things
[2:25:25] they say like you can't preach the
[2:25:27] depths of the message and Powerful
[2:25:28] things happen in the church you're
[2:25:29] getting too
[2:25:31] intellectual well brother Wayne stands
[2:25:33] there and just reads the scripture
[2:25:34] there's a seven stars in the right hand
[2:25:36] that names all six of them and he says
[2:25:38] now let's come down here to the seventh
[2:25:39] one and he says oh here it is he said
[2:25:41] it's a man named William brandom and he
[2:25:43] said ever devil in hell hates that name
[2:25:46] hates that name being mentioned because
[2:25:48] the devil knows that is the Fulfillment
[2:25:49] of just preaching the identification of
[2:25:51] the seven star and a woman sitting there
[2:25:53] with leukemia said
[2:25:57] amen she just said amen and when she
[2:25:59] said amen the leukemia left her
[2:26:02] body come on hands wasn't laid on her
[2:26:05] but somebody was preaching the
[2:26:08] message few years ago I was out in
[2:26:10] Cloverdale at brother bisc preaching on
[2:26:12] a Wednesday night just standing there
[2:26:14] preaching on the third pull and the word
[2:26:15] of God in the church and I didn't know
[2:26:17] brother Murphy Wong's daughter was
[2:26:18] sitting there brother Murphy daughter
[2:26:20] and her husband there was sitting there
[2:26:22] I didn't know him from nobody I was just
[2:26:24] preaching the word and I said you know
[2:26:26] when God come down in a prophet's voice
[2:26:28] and spoke those squirrels into existence
[2:26:30] I said he didn't come down there and say
[2:26:31] abracadabra abadoo I rub my hand over
[2:26:34] this squirrel residue and make a
[2:26:36] squirrel out of you I said he didn't do
[2:26:39] that there was no squirrel DNA there but
[2:26:42] he spoke the word and when he spoke the
[2:26:45] word god backed up the word and creation
[2:26:48] by the spoken word brought curls into
[2:26:50] existence I just stood there and said
[2:26:52] that same gge in this building right
[2:26:54] here
[2:26:55] tonight next year I went back little I
[2:26:58] know that when I said that brother
[2:26:59] Murphy's daughter was sitting there and
[2:27:01] her and her husband had been Desiring a
[2:27:03] child and hadn't been having to have a
[2:27:05] baby and they went to the doctor and the
[2:27:07] doctor said you'll never have a child
[2:27:08] without having a surgery said there's
[2:27:10] something missing in your body and you
[2:27:12] won't be able to have a child brother
[2:27:14] brother brother Murphy told me the
[2:27:15] testimony he said they went through a
[2:27:17] prayer line and they believed God was
[2:27:19] their healer but this was the powerful
[2:27:21] thing that just got me I said brother
[2:27:22] Murphy amen he said do you know what
[2:27:24] happened I said I don't have a clue what
[2:27:26] happened he said well last year when you
[2:27:28] said that on Wednesday night he said my
[2:27:30] daughter went home and she believed if
[2:27:33] God Did It for squirrels he could do it
[2:27:34] for her he said the next morning she
[2:27:37] took a pregnancy test he said and she
[2:27:40] came to Camp with a positive pregnancy
[2:27:43] test he said brother Andrew right
[2:27:45] there's the
[2:27:46] baby without a surgery but the third
[2:27:49] pull come among the church and somebody
[2:27:52] remembered it was more than just a
[2:27:54] cliche it was God fulfilling his word oh
[2:27:57] I say here tonight the same God is right
[2:28:00] here in this
[2:28:01] building I don't know what's missing but
[2:28:04] I know what God can do he can put
[2:28:05] something
[2:28:08] there I'm not a crazy man I believe this
[2:28:11] message I've seen people Changed by the
[2:28:14] preaching of this

[2:28:20] don't know why I'm testifying but I'm
[2:28:21] just here brother Ben several years ago
[2:28:24] out at Mall's Youth Camp I was standing

[2:28:32] was a hot I mean it was ringing wet
[2:28:35] sweating what you mean nothing it was
[2:28:39] hot and I'm just standing there

[2:28:42] away and all of a sudden a strike a a
[2:28:44] streak of lightning come through and hit
[2:28:46] the power lines we're outside it starts
