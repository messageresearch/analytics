to the House of Gold this morning amen it's it's good to be here and you know we've probably some of us have traveled a long way to get here and made an effort but I believe every effort that we make

continually the spirit of God and that's what we need every day to in order to to um overcome you know we don't overcome our own strength it's not by might it's not by power but it's by my spirit

have everyone in the house of the Lord today God bless you amen great to have so many visitors praise the Lord God bless you in the back there um amen so just a announcement so 2 30 today we've got our AGM um and also it was Bella's birthday yesterday so she was once happy birthday Bella for yesterday there she is praise the lord it's also unfortunately meet us last Sunday with us but yes after suicide to pray for you before you go back to Auckland but yeah godspeed and the Lord be with you um amen I think that's all I have so we're just gonna go to uh Ephesians 5 and read from verse 21. this is a bit of a um refresher I was just thinking on these things I guess you know Wedding Bells are in the air and all those things so but the last time I preached on these kind of subjects was back in 2015 or 16 so it's been a while um so I think these things are always good to go through again so Ephesians five I'm going to read from verse 21. and so if you're not married well this will help you in the future and if you are I hope it helps you in the present so amen so uh Ephesians 5 and 21. says here submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord as the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones first cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband amen so that's bar heads in a word of prayer this morning as we approach this great throne of grace oh Lord how great Lord truly your lord your love shall Evermore endure Lord how true that is oh God if every every stalker on the Earth was a quill o God and the Sea the Inca Lord and every man ascribed by trade Lord we could never ever just just put in words Your Love towards us Lord your redeeming love Lord towards Adam's Fallen race Lord Jesus we want to thank you so much we can bow our heads in your presence once again and give you thanks lord for keeping us for another week and we just want to ask father may you come anoint your word Lord as you've anointed the song service may you come and anoint this part of the service oh God may you Quicken your word to every heart father and Lord not only to us here Lord in this building but anyone who's not here today Lord if they be sick in body or away or wherever they may be Lord be their portion and their strength dear God we just want to humbly come before you and say Lord have your way have preeminence take over o God and speak what you want spoken and do what you want done Lord for your good pleasure we ask these things Lord that you'd receive all the honor glory and praise in Jesus Christ name amen amen God bless you may have your seats this morning so I want to um I want to I use the same title but so I'm not using the same notes but you know it's like any kind of some restaurants you order the same thing you get a different meal so this is kind of this kind of place anyway so I want to go into what women want now it's very important that we understand one another amen it's very important we understand one another now it's the uh uh we we see here in the scripture that that as as Christ is with his bride so husbands are with their wives and vice versa now brother Brown would speak about in the you know in the beginning we know that when Adam was created he was male and female in one body and then God took the feminist part out of him and made Eve so and then and then even before the fall her name was actually Adam as well because their identity was in one name and so Adam so so Eve was not taken out of the Dust of the earth like the you know like the female say say deer or you know the doe and the male Buck was taking out different parts of the earth they were taken out of the same body out of the Same Spirit the same nature so when they are separate but the all the feminist part of Adam was put into even and this is why you know we have this uh you know there's a saying uh Men Are from Mars a woman Are from Venus you know different makeup different spiritual makeup and that's true because we're one's masculine and one's feminine but it's very important that we can understand one another who wants to understand the opposite sex I mean who wants to understand this spouse and you know it's very important because if we go into first Peter if we just read the scripture here and um we have it here in First Peter 3 and 6 to 9. it's very amazing how how the relationship with with husband and wife will hinder prayers or it will actually can say boost prayers if I put it that way so either either and and it's not to do with how the wife visits how the husband is you know God puts a lot of responsibility in his in in his headship for us right he puts full responsibility for our welfare our care our our provision you know the Rapture everything he puts it on upon himself not upon us right and it's the same thing with with husbands wives you know the husband's office is incredibly powerful you know I don't know if I share this testimony but uh maybe I did but you know um when when Brother Andy and Ira in South Africa there was a there was a um there's a sister from the Congo and and her husband had been back in the Congo for over a year and she was in South Africa not working had I think four children had to look after extended family and she and she was in the hospital and the doctors said um called her husband that was still in the Congress go come see your wife because she's going to pass away and um and but then as soon as the husband came to South Africa to be with his wife she started getting better and the doctors didn't understand why that's because he was not in his position and because all the burden and the pressure and the stress was upon her and she couldn't physically provide and even the amount of money he was sending to her to to look after the family wasn't even enough to pay rent and so all that sickness basically the sickness in her body was because of her spiritual problem because he wasn't in his position but when he came back to be part of the family like he should have been she started to get well so it's amazing the the the impact we have on one another amen that that husbands have on their wives and amen so uh we're here are we and yes we are in First Peter I'm just don't know why where's that first part of that gone oh first Peter three okay first Peter three six and nine so I've got a lot of it here so so it's easier now even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters yeah as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement now we know brother Bram said the reason that Sarah called Abraham Lord is because of his conduct because of what he did he did not he he earned that respect yeah respect is earned you know it's not it's not a forced given thing respect must be earned by conduct and character and so it says here now likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife is under the weaker vessel and as being ears together of the grace of life that your prayers are not hindered so so the husband's wife the husband's prayers can be handed because they're not dwelling with their wife according to knowledge they don't have an understanding about how to live with them you know it's very easy for two people to live in a house very important I mean I mean very easy but it's very vital that you know how to dwell with one another I mean so sometimes you know things can be going sideways in the family and things in the trouble and all these things it's because the husband is not dwelling with his wife according to knowledge or understanding it's amazing where it says to giving giving honor unto the wife now now this word honor it yeah it means it means a you know a value but by analogy is to esteem especially of the highest degree and so to to give honor and you know this word honors used quite a few places in the scripture such as you know children your honor your parents and different things but you know it says that the husband should honor his wife and and esteem them in the highest degree you know so so we shouldn't um never think we should never think little of one another we should always think of the highest when we think of one another especially when we think of our families our spouses we should always honor them esteem them as the greatest person in the world I'm glad someone believes what I'm saying here praise Lord God bless you brother but we should never ever think little of our spouses because if we have a revelation we are one then you know we will always hold them to the highest degree because we're part of each other we're not two separate people and just because of a marriage ceremony we're now married don't know we're become one flesh amen that we are one person as Adam and Eve they were in two bodies but they were one person so we are two uh you know one person but in two bodies if I can put it that way amen so it's very important you know because we have to we have to look at each other with the mind of Christ now the Bible tells us that we do have the mind of Christ if you have the baptism of the holy spirit this morning you have the mind of Christ it means you can think like God you think God's thoughts because his mind is in you and it's not a learned behavior but it's by his his spirit being in your life him dwelling in your soul you have his mind you have his thinking now we understand of course these bodies have to be changed so our carnal mind is still there but if you have the mind of Christ you can actually take every thought subject to the word of God and if it's if it's contrary to the word you can you can bin it right but if it's if it is the word of God you can meditate upon it amen so it says in First Corinthians 2 and 16 for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct them but we have the mind of Christ so the believer has the mind of Christ by the baptism of the holy spirit so it's very important when we think about ourselves our families our spouses the only right way to think about them is how he thinks about us that's the only way to think about one another I mean so so he he has held Us in the highest esteem right he put his own life secondary to your life he put greater value in you than he did it on himself because if he valued himself higher than you he would never have gone to Calvary he would never have taken one beating one whipping one nothing because he would have put his own life ahead of you but because he put He put your life at higher value than himself he went to Calvary gladly he saw the joy set before him which was you redeemed amen so so he put you think he it was God and flesh it wasn't just a prophet or a religious you know teacher Jesus was Emmanuel God With Us so he put your life higher than the life of God that's the value he put upon yourself so so if if that's how he thought about you and you have the mind of Christ who you should think that way about one another amen that you should put your spouse or your family at greater value than yourself amen and you should think about them in the highest degree they should think it's the greatest privilege to be part I think it's for me it's the greatest greatest privilege to be part of my family I think it's an honor to be to be to be my darling's husband to be the you know father of my children I think to me it's a it's an honor I think they're awesome family I'm so proud to be part of them that's how I think about them I'm not ashamed of them I don't think they're useless you know we should never speak negative about one another you know it's so important that we should never ever speak negative now I'm gonna you know we should never ever call one another stupid or useless or dumb and that and that will never measure up we should never those words should never come out of our mouth to anyone we should never ever because that's the devil thinks humanity is stupid Humanity's useless Humanity's dumb that's what the devil thinks of you and I but that's not what God thinks about us he would say in in Zephaniah 3 and 7 the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing Hallelujah that's God's thoughts remember if we have the mind of Christ we'll think like this I mean that that he will he he rejoices over us so if he rejoices over us us as us as husbands should Rejoice over our family amen we should have joy in our family think of a it should give us joy when we think of our family irrespective of of how well they're doing how bad they're doing they can be they can be living the worst life possible but if they're family it should give you a joy and a love for them why because they're part of you so it's not based on performance and how they're doing and how their grades are or their job or their pay packet whatever no that's irrelevant if they're part of you they're part of you and you should Joy over them you should rejoice in them because God because we're part of whom he rejoices over us he Delights us because we're part of him Hallelujah amen because we know we do not become the Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth we we are born again because we are Sons and Daughters of God I mean we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost because we are Sons and Daughters we don't become Sons and Daughters by receiving the Holy Ghost we receive it because we are that's what the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 4 because you are Sons he sent for the spirit of a weak whatever father because you are you don't become you are that's why you receive amen that's so powerful that's why the blood atones for you because you are you don't become you are already you just wake up God real quickens you opens your eyes spiritually you realize I'm from God I'm going back to him I'm his child amen so he Delights this because we're part of him and he can't lose a part of himself amen he could not lose one of his children but he he Delights in us because of who we are not what we think we are and our performance and you know man's always look at this and I did this and look at me and look how great this no God doesn't look that way he loves us because of we're part of him because we're part of him and we should love our families the same way we should have that Revelation that it's not you know that it's that that that that the same life that's in me is in my family the same DNA the same character traits good or bad they're in there because they're part of me I can't deny them any more that I could deny myself amen I don't understand these these these parents that connect basically disown their children and you know say they're not that that's not how God thinks praise the lord we should never think a negative thing amen says in Isaiah 62 and 4 thou shall know Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any will be termed desolate but thou shall be called Hezbollah and I land Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married Hallelujah that's why Hezbollah means the Lord delighteth in thee he Delights in you today hey you may have had the worst week of your life he Delights in you I mean you're the workmanship of his hands amen he's proud of his achievement you may not be proud of yourself he's proud of you he's a loving father he cares he doesn't want to hide you in the corner and you know keep you away from you know the public or whatever more because he's ashamed he's not ashamed of his children says in Hebrews that he's not ashamed to call us brethren Hallelujah family amen that's what God think now that's God's mind and we have the mind of Christ we should think the same way Hallelujah remember these things are not learned behavior of his life as the word comes into you you'll manifest these things Hallelujah so if I get a bit noisy and happy and shouty but you know this is how I feel God God loves us God cares God's interested in you and I he's not this indifferent God that stands there and doesn't care about what you're going through he cares what you're going through amen because you're part of him he's concerned about you and I although it doesn't matter how big small whatever he cares about you and I Hallelujah that's why we should never ever speak a negative God never in his Bible tells us we're stupid we're useless we're about to nothing that you won't find that in the scripture you won't find that about you in this book amen you won't find it in the message that's for sure it means if God does not say those things about us and his word why should we say those things about you you know about one another amen we need to especially your children there you know their character their attitudes you know their driving life to express what the Lord has made them to be can be shaped so powerfully by how we speak to them amen yo you think of girls girls need to know they're treasured remember okay I'll just I'll just throw it in because you know you know what you need from God man the relationship you need from God that's what your wives need from you it's that simple it's really you know you know this is not rocket science or it's actually a very simple thing so and and and I'll break that down so so what you need from God is what our wives need from us praise the Lord because remember if you're because there's husband and wife are so is Christ in the church see so it's very actually quite a very Elementary thing but you see you know girls they need to be treasured you think about yo I need to know I'm Treasure by God I need to know that that I matter to him that I'm not just a number not like in some big you know you know some schools are in the thousands and yo yo a student's just a number they just go through a machine and the other teachers don't really care and you know we're not like that to God we're not just a number we're not just a name in the Lamb's Book of Life no to him you are the name in the book amen because of because if he went to Calvary for one he would have done it all the same if he sent the message for one person to go on a Rapture he would have had brother Brown go through all the trials all the testing all the hardship to preach all those sermons just for you Hallelujah do you think God wouldn't do such a thing absolutely amen you see the things here to do to get his children to move into their position you look at Esther and the things that God had to cause to happen to get her on the throne incredible things a lot of hardship Wars had to happen invasions had to happen Nations had to cease to be for the Babylonians to come and the meats and Persians all those things for her to come to the throne and do what she had to do God will move this whole earth to get you into your place if he needs to he's not afraid he's not afraid to do what he has to do to get you there to tend to hand to Jehovah World War II to get the Jews back in the Homeland because he has a burden for those people there's 144 000 he's going to reveal himself too they've been blinded for two thousand years but their eyes are going to come open soon and very soon as the Gentile eyes are becoming dim amen their eyes are coming open so don't let the anointing on this age come upon you and blind you to what God is doing amen but let your eyes be open say Lord anoint my eyes with I said that I would see your word see you in your program in this very hour Amen to girls they need to feel treasured they need to know that they are special that they're beautiful they're not just a number but they're important and they're a vital part of the family it's very important that we tell them that they're beautiful that they're special that they're clever they can do anything amen amen they're not just a person that you know you know because a wife is more than just a a a a chief cook a bottle washer and someone that does the laundry and vacuums the house that is not a wife that's just a maid but we should so we should never ever let our wives become diminished just to a mate it's more than that we're not just the maid in the in the kingdom of God we're the bride of Christ he shares our heart with us he cares about us you know you know he walks with us he wants to have experiences with us amen that's what God wants to do so we should do the same thing with our spouses amen so girls need to know that they're treasured they're special they're beautiful they're not just a number they're important they're a vital part of the family they are worthy yes Hallelujah thou worthy amen they're very see that isn't that what I know that don't you want to know that that you're worthy he made you worthy so you can Rejoice amen amen amen to boys they need to know they have what it takes to be the man of the house boys need to know they have what it takes that they can actually take over from Dad amen you need to instill that in your boys they have what it takes already within them they are more than able to be the man of the house to to be the leader they have what it takes because they want to know as you're growing up you know do I measure up and who do they look to their father for the for the for the recognition because a mother can never lead a son into manhood it takes a man to initiate a man into manhood so it's so important that we're instill into our boys our young men and I'm proud of our young men I'm proud of you young man I'm very proud of you you have what it takes to be a Son of God Amen to walk into a Rapture to to to to find the kingdom of Hell by your prayers to be spiritual leaders you have what it takes within you never let the devil tell you you'll never make it you'll you'll be built to make it you've been made different amen you must know this the devil wants to tremble manhood down to nothing to a spineless coward I mean by this but sons of God are rugged we can take a knocking remember we don't we don't tap out we just jump back in I mean the devil may knock us down but get back up I mean you're built to be a spiritual leader that's why the devil wants to put a chain around your neck of you know social media or sport or popular some nonsense and drag you around by some some filthy Harlot amen but God wants you to walk with him Amen to never ever be bowed down and try and match this world no we're made different amen so so so so so our young men they need to know they have what it takes Amen to be a leader to be a provider to be a shield to be a hero to be the champion to be the spiritual priest of the home you must know this what you're built to be and fathers you must instill that in your sons amen don't let you no one else is going to do it they're looking to you I am aware of a mandate from God to raise the Next Generation amen that if we aren't the ones that go in the if we go all by the way the grave the next generation is the one who take the Rapture you say well it could be tomorrow it could be no sure but we've got to plan long term I mean because it's not just old people that go on the Rapture young people go on the Rapture children go on the Rapture teenagers are going in the rapture amen so we've got to realize that there's no Generations in this church we're all the same generation we maybe have a few more gray hairs or whatever but no we're we're all the same age in the Lord amen it's not it's not the young people here in the No No we're all the same we're fighting all together praise the Lord amen so we should you know we must hold hold our children our families in the highest esteem because they are part of us I trust that you have that Revelation amen that it's not just a you know you're a married couple and not just two individuals that have maybe the same surname but they are part of one another hey man and it should be now when you think of those individuals you should think about the same ones I mean I mean you know both of them at the same time so you think about I just wrote this down I didn't ask for permission but you think about Eden Lundy you don't think of just Ed you think of Iran Lundy we think of London you think about Lundy and Ed right because they're one person right they're one and the same they're not two individuals that are last name no dear no no they're they make the whole and that should be the same with all of us here with you know you know that are married we should think about the site your husband and wife as one you can't think of one without the other you can't have one without the other amen that's that's exactly how it should be hallelujah amen so we we must give one another the highest honor amen it says here sorry we're still in um we're still in First Peter there finally be of one mind having compassion one of another Lover's Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but culturalized blessing knowing that ye are there to call that you should inherit a blessing I mean but but don't give evil for evil amen the devil always try and get in and cause fasting and fighting in a home we're not immune to that right but but we have the power to stop it having to break that cycle it doesn't just continue on Amen so if evil comes and Trouble Comes and weakened contrise give blessing because why we're called to inherit a blessing praise the Lord amen now it says here to dwell with one another that that word means to reside together amen and and the primary uh word that that that makes the word dwell it speaks about a union so not just individuals in the house but we are one I mean the family unit is one and praise the Lord Amen brother Bram said when when when Eve was taken out of Adam he said now in the beginning they were one Adam and Eve God when he made man he made him a jewel person both male and female he separated them in flesh and put him here on Earth and flesh and the female part was still in spirit look friend God was so careful don't let it leave you God never got a handful of dust and Maiden Eve she it would have been a different creation she was not a creation she was a byproduct and God goes over into the heart of Adam this rib right under his heart and takes a ribbon makes the wife and the Very part of Adam's spirit that was in the woman those two are one soul body Spirit there one they are perfect Oneness I thought they're so interesting as he says look God was so careful you know you know Medical Science has actually proven that you can actually remove a ribbon a certain way it'll grow back because people say well where's the missing word from a man if God did that well God's the perfect surgeon and medical science has actually proven you can remove a rubber same way it'll grow back so I believe he would have taken the rib just just here the fifth rib on the left-hand side right by the heart then take in the other um you know feminist Spirit out of him and he made Evie says look God was so careful see God was so careful when he made you and I it wasn't just yeah yeah it wasn't a haphazard thing that we're here today and he said that they are perfect Oneness they don't become perfectly one they are perfect Oneness before the fall so God was showing that that that their lives were a manifestation of perfect Oneness Adam knew how to dwell with Eve he had perfect understanding of her and she had perfect understanding of whom I believe because they they were perfectly one now we may befallen now in the YO in these Fallen bodies rather but if we're being Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ we can have this perfect Oneness even in this Fallen flesh because God wants to prove his victory on this side of of the Rapture right he wants to prove to the devil that his achievement is a restoration of Adam and Eve even in this Fallen World yeah it's amazing how Adam and Eve they fell in God's Garden of Eden be it God in his great uh Power and mercy has made a people to stand in Satan's Eden Hallelujah that's you and I we are built to stand in this day Adam and he fell in Paradise but we are standing in the world that is in chaos Hallelujah God made us to stand in chaos Amen to be perfectly one with our spouses praise God I'm glad about that aren't you Hallelujah so so men must we must understand how to dwell with our wives according to knowledge amen that's very important now now it says in Proverbs 15 1 and 2 a soft answer turneth away wrath but Grievous words stir up anger the tongue of the wise uses knowledge you're right but the mouth of fools poorth out foolishness amen so so a soft answer turns away wrath that's why we read at the end of their first Peter that we should not contr you know not give evil for evil or rallying for railing but contrast blessing known that you are down to call that we that ye should inherit a blessing so it's not about just saying woman be quiet you don't understand and just just toughen up and deal with it that's not dwelling according to knowledge amen but you've got to be able to have an understanding that you can actually speak to one another to actually meet one another's needs now I'm just gonna go through this list and um he says here in Romans 12 and 9 let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate uh uh affection one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another so it's a great secret now if you prefer one another look see see the Lord put your care and Welfare ahead of himself he put you first in himself second and if we can put our families first and ourselves second we'll be successful selfishness has caused this world to go to nuclear war greed and selfishness if we can get that out of ourselves amen what will it do it'll do the opposite it won't be world war three it won't be Armageddon in your home it'll be the millennium I mean if we put our our spouses above ourselves their needs before ours just like the Lord put our needs before his amen then then we can be successful now as I said here that we should we should understand so as as the Lord uh as as we men want a relationship with the Lord so our wives want it from us right it's really that straightforward amen because in Ephesians 5 which we read in our opening scripture Paul is basically saying husbands you've got to be like God you've got to be like Christ in order amen that that that that that that that you get really the most of what you really need out of marriage out of one another because remember when the husband comes to his position then the family follows right because remember we it's like you take us now we would not we were not born into our right position in Christ okay some of you are honest some of you are just maybe asleep some of you are just Angels Wings put them away we were born in sin shaped iniquity come to all speaking lies right we were we were born chaotic we were born chaotic but the Lord was never in chaos he was always in his position so when he began to reveal himself when his words started to become alive to us it brought us into our position amen so so he was in his position in the family and then he by him revealing his heart his word to you and I brought brings us into our position because you know adoption is really because of relationship you know adoption or positioning placing as a son or daughter of God is Not based on our performance it's based on relationship you know it's like brother Brown would dramatize about the um tutor and the you know and and the son you know and the and the tutor you know we you know we know in the scripture we might find it later on my Note somewhere but you know we were under tutors right until the fullness of time would come when the Lord revealed himself we're positioned you know as a as a son or daughter of God but brother man would dramatize about how the tutor would say to the son okay I'm gonna go up this hill I'm gonna go here I'm going to go here can you go with me and then and then the son would say well as long as you're holding my hand I'm gonna get there right so I've become a full trust because of a relationship now we know the Tudor is the father right the tutor is God the Holy Ghost and God are not two different beings they're the same God right so the tutor that leads us is God himself but but if you look into the adoption series it's really adoption or the Sons and Daughters of God becoming positionally placed in Christ is because of relationship it's when the son or daughter of God when you fully trust the Lord and fully surrender then God will take you into your position amen so it's not based on your performance it's not based on how smart you are and how wise and whatever more and you know your ability now it's your relationship with the Lord that matters that's what will take you into your adopted position hey man I may sound very simplistic but it's very powerful it's adoption is based on relationship amen so the Lord so we're in chaos the Lord was never in chaos he reveals himself to us then we come into our position we come into order so it always works that way down never works up it always works down I mean from the head down amen so that's why the Apostle Paul is basically saying husbands you've got to be like if you want to be a real husband you've got to be like Christ in order to bring your wife and your family into into their positions right so now this may sound like an impossible task but it's not Hallelujah I mean God doesn't put something on his children and say now you work it out you know this is not like building some big kids hit something without instructions right even actually the one who designed it there to fix it you're like brother bran would say there was a mechanic and he was trying to fix this car and he's trying all different kind of things and he just couldn't get it going and pulls the engine out pulls everything out puts it back in pulls it out puts it back in changes all these parts the thing won't go and then a man just walks into the garage and he says hold on well you know what's going on he said this and this and this and this he says just change that and do that and do that for the mechanic he was wise I'll say well this guy seems to know what you know he seems to know what he's talking about I've tried everything it hasn't worked and then he does that puts the key in the ignition and it just purrs like a purse like a lion the engine it goes off and then in the mechanical Club says how do you know how this thing works is well I'm the chief designer I made it you know it's the same thing with us right it's like we try and change things and do things and do all kinds of things but when the chief designer comes in and says look this is how my word is this is you know just surrender to me and I'll show you how to go through life I'll show you how to have a family I'll show you how to walk in my word see amen it's so it's why it's relationship amen so now so we need to so so when God so so it's not impossible if we really want to know what our wives want from us Brothers we can then then we can look into the description say what do we want from the Lord right because as we're we're actually all women here we are we are we're all in the economy of God female because we're the bride of Christ that's why when sometimes say ladies first for lunch you know why because we're actually all feminine right in in the economy of God so that's why when we can we can look about what God what we want from the Lord we can see what our spouses want from us so this is a no particular order and this is not a complete list okay but you know we want unconditional love our spouses want our wise what unconditional love from us we want unconditional love from God I mean it's not based on condition if you do this I'll do this no we want an unconditional love amen we want love that's not shared with another right and our wives don't want a love that's shared with someone else amen we want acceptance of Who We Are that we don't have to change our personality we don't have to change our hair color our height our width or whatever no we want to be accepted by the Lord Who We Are Who Wants to be accepted because of who they are yeah who they are praise the Lord if I'm loud I'm loud if I'm quiet I'm quiet but God accepts me anyway praise the Lord amen we want understanding you want to be understood by the law day our wives want to be understood amen we want Security in the relationship amen we don't want to be hung you know am I going to make it today and you know am I in the bride today and you know you look at your I don't have a smart watch but you know if you had to go to spiritual metrics on that thing you know I'm tracking way down no we don't want that kind of relationship with God amen we want Security in the relationship and he wants you to be secure in your relationship with him he wants you to know that you know that you know that you're past from Death to life amen that you're going on the Rapture he wants that in your heart doesn't have to be a lightning bolt from the blue because to put that Revelation in your soul you're part of him he can't lose you amen because you're part of him and you're going right who wants that kind of security you know because remember it's not based to CC the problem is former ages the Pentecostal age brother Ram said they're great legalists and so that of course comes into the message because people came out that Pentecostal works-based religion right but God wants you to realize it's not by works you're saved it's by grace and the Bible definition of Grace is a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection in the life amen so if if Grace has come upon your heart then it'll be reflected in your life that that is divine grace you see Abraham walked by Grace God said leave this land go to another land whatever Grace Came Upon Us heart and it was reflected in the life he started walking hallelujah amen and we're the children of Abraham so it should be the same thing with you and I amen we should be a Divine influence why am I a Believer a Divine influence Came Upon My Life what was that Divine influence it was the open Word Came Upon My Life As now and you know it's now influencing me where once I was going into darkness going away from God didn't care about him but then an influence came his influence Came Upon My Life I started walking with him what's that Grace found you hey man we didn't find Grace amen Grace found us I mean you can look at all the scriptures about your like Esther found Grace your favor in the sight of the king Hallelujah great Esther found that in his sight it wasn't the other way around it was just God yo you're the king said I find favor in this one Hallelujah amen that's the same thing with you and I and the reason that she found Grace or favor is because she listened to her guy who knew the heart of the king we've had a hair guy in this day brother Branham right he knew the heart of God he'd stand in Christ the mercy God revealed say I'm going to tell you what was on the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world and someone said how he studied for that was his Bible in a concordance he got crisis of mystery God revealed Hallelujah threefold manifestation of God who else has stood there I I haven't heard another preacher so I'm going to tell you what was in the back part of God's mind and now here it is I've never heard that before have you heard that before some denominational guys say look I'm gonna tell what's in the back part of God's mind no Hallelujah why because there's a haggai in this day so this is how you dress it's how you dress in the word your attitude your Meek humble Spirit you should have and this is how you approach the king and different things amen praise the Lord amen Security in the relationship amen we provision well we want to be provided for we want to be comforted amen he Comforts all those who mourn we want to be comforted we don't want to say just you know God doesn't say just hard enough you know just get over it no he allows us to pour our grief and our sorrow and whatever we you know he listens when we just pour it out Hallelujah and then and then when you end up you know finishing all that you may nothing may not have changed but you feel better who feels better yo yo that's like David would say you keep all my tears in a bottle Lord he poured out a lot of Tears a lot of heart to be poured out before God and he says God you keep all those things it's not just Idle Words that come before the Lord amen comfort amen we want a relationship that is unique to us alone see we want to feel the most special with God right amen hey relationship that is unique amen so it's not our buddies that are our that that know our deepest desires and Ambitions and hopes and dreams that's our spouse because remember our spouse should be our best friend I'm not ashamed to say Christine's my best friend what's a good day a good day is me just having coffee with her hanging out I've I enjoy that time Hallelujah so that's how you should be your spouse should be your best friend and if if they are not your best friend you need to check up on your relationship amen because your friends are not one with you your spouse should be amen we want attention from God right we're not just a hobby for him we're not just a side project we're actually the very purpose of his being Hallelujah well that's a big statement No we're the purpose of us being he didn't Express his attributes to Jupiter or the fish or the whales or the elephants no he expressed all his attributes to his sons and daughters amen all of his heart he didn't express it to the Milky Way he's not interested actually in the Milky Way he's interested in you why'd he put the Milky Way there that you'd look up and say there's a God Amen why'd he put the fly and all the all the ecosystem of the earth why do you put it there you'd look at it say this must be a crater behind this thing how can all these different organisms become in such a perfect without man's dabbling in Perfect Harmony Phil said well that takes billions of years listen I've I've studied chemistry I studied people say yo yo they're still trying to work out how life started they're trying to work out was it a lightning bolt that hit some primeval super was it a volcano or was it a hydrothermal vent system deep under the ocean they can't work it out because the very laws of chemistry forbid actually pre-life even forming but yeah they try and make it happen but it can't happen because it took God amen and now that's just basic basic life forming pre-life they call it they can't actually get it chemically because it actually because because how they think it happens they won't have a chemistry lesson it's against the basic laws of science for the chemicals of of even the most basic amino acids in the more complicated ones to form and be there and start replicating who's ever gone on YouTube you just you just Google put it on the chat about about all the Machinery that takes takes takes your DNA to make an enzyme or a protein man you look at a car manufacturing plant that's nothing compared to what's going on billions of times in your body every day building a Tesla building of even an aircraft carrier or anything that's nothing compared to what's going on in your cells right now it doesn't just go oh we'll make a protein and Boop no there's all these different different things and even even to get the thing fold in the right shape man it's super complicated and and evolutionary say oh that's just that's an argument saying well it's too complicated therefore it can't evolve no it is too complicated because without any of those things cystic fibrosis is because of protein or saying doesn't the cystic fibroid that's a Sickle Cell uh anemia in your body it's because something's not folding right that's why I have people it's that simple things don't fold right you know anyway I'll put that on the chat no the most complex thing you build the space shuttle nothing compared to what's going on in here and people think that's a great achievement yet we have life in these bodies and God just said let there be and here we are we're fearfully and wonderfully made you know and and and and but these five senses aren't here to contact God but Faith contacts God and God gives you that Faith to contact him amen why because he wants we want his attention but he wants our attention I trust he's got your attention even today amen we want to be we want to have forgiveness and not to be reminded of our mistakes and failings you want God to bring up remember if he wanted to he could have a perfect record every moment of every day every thought every emotion every look everything and just have it perfectly but he takes his blood and he puts that in the sea of his forgetfulness and what makes God one of the things makes him so great is he has the ability to forget hello that's why the things are so vexus in our spirit sometimes he's forgiven us of them but you say we say Lord forgive me that I did this and he looks in his book he looks in his uh record this is the only blank page I can wait I have one you know he looks at his he looks at his record of your life because he's like he's like you know he's like hold on what are you what are you asking about and he doesn't do it this way so hey Angel you know whatever your name is go get the record of their life because they're asking me to forgive them about such and such and I can't remember that the angel gets out of the book and says you're right Lord it's gone and the only word that's written across your book is actually pardoned by the blood of Jesus Christ but then we take a blank page and we want to make it such a big thing Let It Go if you have confessed it sincerely unto the blood of Jesus Christ made right whatever you need to make right God will tell you if you need to do just let it go because God don't remember why should we you say well why is it in my mind I think God allows us to remember these things that we remain thankful thank God I'm not that person thank God I don't have that weight on me anymore I'm free indeed Hallelujah amen so we should never remind one another of our past mistakes and failings amen because we don't want to be reminded we want nothing to come between us praise God we want nothing to come between us there should be nothing between our soul and our savior right there should be nothing between spouses this is what I want I believe sisters is this what you want from your husbands amen you want to be you want to you want to be led you want to have leadership not just someone that pays the bills and goes to work but there's actually a vision for the family yeah yo yo yo there's a vision this is what we want to do this year this is what we want maybe maybe even a natural thing hey we want to buy a house we want to do this project we want a god holiday here there should be a you know there should be a vision projected we want to get closer to the Lord we want to know each other better the other you know there should be that kind of leadership in the home amen we want to be treasured not taken for granted we want to be treasured who wants to be treasured by God you're the apple of his eye you're the jewel in his crown you're his greatest achievement amen you're his greatest achievement look what calvary's achieved he may not it may be a bit underwhelming in your mind now but wait till you gathered around the throat I could I pray I can say the same thing I say look what Calvary achieved maybe he he would say it to us look what my blood has done look what my sacrifice has done here you are you're on your way to Darkness but I said Satan you can't touch one of my children you may lead them for a season in life but there came a time when I Quicken them to my word I draw them to myself and now here they are redeemed because they're because they have a gene seed of God in them Hallelujah hey man brother Brown sees more about the Jane seed of God in his last few Services he does his entire Ministry because he's wanting us to see that we're a gene seed of God we're part of him amen so we want to be treasured we're his jewels Hallelujah amen some of you are looking at me like really yeah really we need to have the mind of Christ we need to think about ourselves as Christ thinks about us we need to think about one another as he thinks about us if you have his Spirit you have his mind amen because the devil always tries to tell us we're not worth anything I've had people tell me that the reason they didn't have children is because well we just one big part of a gene pool thank you science they were working in science really no God doesn't look at you just a gene pool you know just this big gene pool of humanity God doesn't view you like that God views you as a as a part of himself one of his sons and daughters you're very special to him if that's all you get out of the service you're special to God you're not a special case you're special to him that's a very different thing we want to be wanted we don't want to be tankered for granted you know comes a time while we're married this is this and you know someone says a joke you know you know your wife was um complaining you know you know you know they're having counseling whatever and said you know my husband never tells me that he loves me and he just said well I told her when we got engaged and got married and if it changes I'll let her know they've been married for decades it should never be their way you know every time the spirit of God comes and the word becomes alive God's saying I love you I love you I treasure you you're mine I Delight in you you're everything to me I can't live without you Hallelujah you're the reason I'm the reason am I being is actually because of you my thoughts are towards you of Peace you come to an expected end Hallelujah what's that end you'll be around the throne Eternal when the devil's not even Cinders and Ashes you'll still be Hallelujah you're gonna realize that when the word you know something bless you in the scripture God saying I love you I care for you amen this is a bit mushy no it's not mushy you we believe in heartfelt religion around this place probably so we want to be wanted amen we don't want to be taken for granted we don't just want to be a you know someone who washes the dishes I'm like separation well this is you know we don't want a working relationship this is your job description this is my job you keep your description I'll keep the mind in this business will run fine now this is not how this works I know there's a heartfelt love a Oneness of Body Soul and Spirit amen between husband and wife praise the Lord Hallelujah who's happy so far are we okay this this shouldn't shock anyone okay this this should not be shocking say well I've heard this before good praise a lot because remember the the family because remember God brother Ram said when Adam and Eva put in the garden God said this is my masterpiece he had a masterpiece family in the garden so what is he doing he's rebuilding Masterpiece families praise the lord we know ultimately the Masterpiece he was the first part Christ was the first part of the Masterpiece brother Ram says that now for two thousand years he's been making the second part of his Masterpiece what's that the E the second Eve as Christ was the second Adam so we are the second Eve amen but now that Masterpiece is not just the bride collectively around the world for seven Church ages and Christ that Masterpiece should be reflected in your home of a perfect Oneness perfect relationship Amen in spite of trouble strain whatever more there should be a perfect Oneness in the home between husband and wife amen remember because love must be tested Faith must be tested see it's it's easy to say you believe when there's Miracles maybe we're just having a Sunday night at camp and God just pours himself out I believe everything Lord but when you pray and it seems like nothing's answered do you still believe that's when faith is actually tested that's when it's actually proven to see what's within you that you say I don't see anything happening but do you still believe remember Jesus said blessed are those who don't see yet belief Hallelujah so Faith must be tested love must be tested amen but we have been built to to overcome every test amen now brother M tells the story of two married couple I mean two two couples that he married one I don't have their first account of it but this is from um this from the door inside the door in 1960 this is the second property but he married a very wealthy couple and then he married a very poor couple the wealthy couple was they lived in a big mansion on the hill but the poor couple they lived in a boxcar that they turned into a house so so they made a tiny home raised a lot they've made a tiny home but I your one's way better than this one but you know so but then uh later he said I'm gonna go check up on this you know you're on these two couples so so he goes up to the big mansion and he hears them you know fussing and fighting and yelling because you know they had been out partying the night before and she was dancing with some other man and he was jealous and all the stuff going on and you know but but then when he came to throw a knock you know it all went quiet opened the door and they were hit you're hand in hand how you doing it's oh we're doing really well and so it's all manufactured because behind closed doors they are fighting like cats and dogs B they put on a Persona when someone else comes along we shouldn't be that way what you see is what you should get right Hallelujah behind closed doors in the public we should be the same Hallelujah sure there may be trouble we're not immune from trouble and misunderstandings but God gives us Grace to overcome those things and work through them and when you work further you should be closer together than you were in the very beginning praise the Lord amen so then he saw those two he said as manufactured it'll never last but then he thought well I'll go down and look at this couple who's married uh and they and they live in the boxcar she said now now this to me this encapsulates my whole sermon okay he says now one day I thought I'd find out what become of this couple I'd live uh I'd married and lived in a boxcar so I was working for the Public Service Company I was a lineman there for 17 years I went out on the river and kind of played the part of a hypocrite put on my spurs on for um on and safety and went walking down along the river like I was watching polls I slipped up and I seen his old Chevrolet out there with the headlights wide on with baling wire and I went up towards the door I heard them talking and he just got him a job off the pwa or what it was they worked on there and it worked at some lumber company that was making eight or ten dollars a week that was pretty good money and uh he had that taken that old boxcar put newspapers up and tacky buttons he asked a question who knows what a tacky button is he says well what part of Kentucky are you from he says now take car board put a tack in it and push it in the wall and paper and newspapers he had brought down some old boxes and they had made a table out of it but brother if I'd ever found heaven on Earth it it was she was sitting on his lap he had his old hat out mashed uh uh the top of it in had poured his paycheck out and they had so much there laying here for food so much for insurance and so much he said honey I want to get you that dress so bad I believe it was about a dollar and a quarter something like that she said but honey I appreciate that one arm around him like that and he looked up at her and I was standing there like a hypocrite watching you know and so they begin to count this money out and they didn't have enough to go all the way around he said well I worked till I've been working so hard the little dress hangs in the window there it's a dollar and a quarter couldn't we just get the um couldn't we just let the insurance go something she said no honey I appreciate it oh he just put his arms around her and I stood up and turned uh um around this way looked up on the top of the hill I could see the house of the other the Steeples on top of the house I thought which is the rich man which one would you want to take Billy if you're going to take your choice let me have a real true wife one that loves me let me live down here in a boxcar for I tell you happiness and contentment money cannot buy money cannot buy love it's the real things now now let's just break this down here now this is a great secret to a successful marriage and family now it's obvious that they are content with their positions that's not that's not a surprise to anyone right you know because we know the Bible says that it says in first Thessalonians 6 perverse disputings or maybe it's Timothy so I've just got a t oh yeah Timothy First Timothy six and five perverse disputings of men of crop minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself so people who preach as Prosperity Doctrine and say if you're rich then then God's blessed you and it's godliness we just read that that's a lie I mean it's supposing gainer's godliness from such withdraw themselves as people of crap Minds The destitute of the truth says but godliness with contentment is great gain all right man and contentment means a state a state of happiness and satisfaction he says for we brought nothing into this world and is certain we carry nothing out and having food and Raymond let us therefore be content now contentment when it comes to world I mean your material Goods really stems from a a a a a a a a emotional contentment within the home remember because your uh Brothers we're not here just to supply the physical needs of our family but the emotional needs and they're actually more important than the money needs right because because you can supply everything under the Sun but there's no emotional connection with the family no relationship that will do that will amount to nothing I mean but if there's a real good solid relationship between husband and wife between between parents and children emotional needs are being met amen then that is that that is an incredible thing but the world doesn't you know that's why there's so much mental health trouble in this country is because families do not know how to connect with one another it's all about just just entertainment and and and worldly positions and having a good time but there's no depth of relationship I'm in between between husband and wife and between parents and children I mean so it's very you know it's very um it's very easy to see that they're content in in what they have so we should never complain about how little we have or how tight our budget is because if we begin to do that we forget the blessings we have already so we should never ever complain well I can't do this I can't buy this I can't do this I can't afford this it's not what it's about if you focus on those things and how much money you do not have then you miss the blessings you have right so we should never complain about having not enough money we should be thankful for what God has given us and remember God owns everything right he owns this Earth he owns the cattle on a thousand hills and the Hills and all the precious metals underneath and all these here in the uh you know he he owns every element he has an unlimited bank account and he gives you what you need from that bank account you gotta trust that he'll provide your needs not your wants but your needs he will look after you he looks after The Sparrows and the whatevers you're worth more than many sparrows the Lord Jesus said so never ever look at the restrictions of life when it comes to material things but just be thankful for what you have right and never let that dictate your life it should be your love and joy and the Holy Ghost should be the thing that drives your life and God will look after the rest amen now because it says in Philippians 4 19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus so he'll Supply our needs Hallelujah but you see but their happiness and love is based more on on more than that contentment it's actually the husband is actually in his god-given position in the relationship see he loves his wife now he showed it by being unselfish with any extra money they might have so he wasn't saying now look this is for them food this is for the insurance and now this extra bit well I want to have a selfish hobby that excludes you from my life he didn't talk like that right he was saying no honey I want to give this extra bit I want to buy you this dress right now this is showing by because he's thinking of her welfare before himself right he's not interested in he wants his wife to have a dress he wants her to be pretty he wants because the thing is when we give those things to our wives we they feel more treasured hey if God gives us a great camper a great service don't you feel more treasured right so so same so it should be now physically right now I'm not a gift person so I said Lord see I I preached myself mother I preach to you people right but we want our wives to feel treasured not just you know not just part of the furniture but there are all they're our world praise God so he expresses it by he thinks about her and her well-being and her needs before her his own and also he includes her in the decision making he said well I'm the head of this family I'm Sovereign no no remember the wife has part of your brain sometimes it's a greater portion than the one we possess okay I'll just anyway that's how I feel about me but but you see he was including her in the decision making because he didn't say nut I'm gonna cancel the insurance we don't need it we trust God blah blah blah you know I'm gonna buy this for you no he included her in the decision making so she is feeling that her input mattered that her her life not just her keeping the boxcar tidy and whatever and doing the dishes and feeding no but her emotional and her mental input into the marriage mattered and that's how she feel even more valued who's following me today amen so so he brought her into the decision-making process and he genuinely was was he didn't just do it out of a show or trying to earn some brownie points he genuinely wanted to buy her the dress and cancel the insurance but because she said uh no keep that well you know whatever you know he respected what she was saying we have to remember that that part of our brain is not in our bodies right we have to bring there should be a Oneness in decisions amen shouldn't just be the husband plows on does what he wants and disregards the wife no there should be a Oneness in decisions amen is that okay they say that's modern thinking no that's perfect Oneness amen God says to Moses I'm going to wipe out Israel what does Moses do stands in the Gap remember what you promised and remember what you've done he actually brought Moses into the decision making if I can put it that way Moses is the bride of Christ and he stood in the gap for Israel and they weren't asking Moses can you pray for us because God's going to deal with us no God just revealed the secret to his bride if I put it that way I'm going to wipe these I'm sick of These Guys these guys are being a pain to you because they were no he he God told Moses that and Moses said no but Lord remember your word and what you've done whatever and it said Moses God repented of what he was going to do he changed his if I say God can God change his mind well God stood on the breach and Moses and you know amen it was Christ and Moses interceding for the people of Israel right but but God didn't just just wipe out Israel and say and then Moses wakes up one morning where's or where's all these 12 tribes gone and God says oh I'm starting with you no he brought Moses into the decision-making process is that okay he interceded amen you know God says I'm gonna go wipe outside him Abraham says what if you find 50. because God said to Abraham well before he says Sing Abraham's my friend will will I withhold from whom what I'm about to do he's actually God brought him into this is actually my plan this is what I'm doing this is why the message because we're the bride we actually see this world is falling apart and we say well God told us this ages ago you know well the prophet preached on this he told me in through the Prophet this is what's going on and we're not surprised by it we don't have to go on some YouTube conspiracy theory to see what's going on we've already been told it's been sitting on tape for 50 odd years it's been sitting there oh you know people say have you seen what's on stuff or what's on NCAA Herald or Radio New Zealand news or whatever today I said no no I read it eight years ago that's actually those reporters are slow man my one's way better than them amen why because God just like he said to Abraham will I withhold from Abraham what I'm about to do well he actually because God was Abraham was a friend of God God actually told him this is what I'm about to do and this is this is how we should be leading our families families this is what we're about to do this is what I'm gonna do and then of course Abraham began to intercede because lot was down there what if you find 50 he goes down and down and down and then Lotus daughters were pulled out and his wife and so on so you know we can't just go on like dictators and not not give any respect and honor to the other other part of our brain praise God amen what does that do it makes us feel makes our wives or even husbands feel valued right because remember we are the manifestation of God's heart right and you're seeing a you're seeing a marriage the wife can be fallen apart and the husband can look like he's got it all together but really what's on the inside of him is being manifested on her right this is how just like that sister I say against Africa on the point of death because but but he looked fine but because he wasn't in his position what was going on in him obviously he I know what he was doing in the Congo he said he was doing business but I didn't really believe him um but you know but what was going on in him was manifesting on her and it's the same thing with us you know the man can look like he's got it all together but the wife's falling apart so what's in him is on the outside of her you'll you'll follow what I'm trying to say amen because men can hide things for a lot better we can we can hide our emotions we're more stoic but just comes out of the wife amen that's why you know brother M said now the you see the state of the church you look at the sisters in the church and then people have taken that in the past say woman you better line up because we're the bride of Christ but Brother Brad never preached a sermon is your wife worthy of the Gospel he preached is your life worthy of of the Gospel right so so if things are falling apart on the outside it's because Lord you've got to do something on the inside here I'm not in my position sure we'll have troubles and you know things and we'll go through things right but Lord there's something going on in here speaking of my own family now you know if something's going on there then it's got something's going on here first so Lord help me in here that there's good praise the Lord amen but many times people put pressure on the wife you've got to line up and do this and no no no you've got to line up there's something in you you've let creeper and some Idol some you know your affections have gone sideways trouble whatever it is you're gonna come back in humility and say Lord I want my family I want my family to come back in line and my relationship all these different things praise God Hallelujah so friends as we as we leave it about there do you want perfect Oneness in your home your perfect one between you and your spouse do you want to dwell husbands with them according to knowledge you know one of the greatest things you know people say an abusive husband I mean and an abusive father is a problem actually no a a father that's distant and negligent can be just as bad and that will imprint on children and then when they come to and they get married those same complexes now manifest in the marriage right but now as husbands we're going to realize and and wives too we're going to realize that that we bring a lot of baggage with us right a lot of bags we don't pack ourselves you know it's not like get on the airline they ask you a question did you pack these bags you enter into a marriage and did you pack these bags a lot of them say no I didn't want that complex I didn't want that trouble I didn't want a a distant father that didn't show his love for me especially that's so harmful for daughters because they begin to realize am I valued do I matter do I do I actually matter in this marriage am I part of the family am I actually or you know you know where's my standing with you because I never knew that from their father so now it's imprinted upon them but thanks be to God that God can Minister through the husband in such a way to take that out of the wife probably that she can become stable she can become you know knowing who she is comfortable in her position comfortable in her role in the home and all those things why because of the husbands in his position she'll come into her position amen but we've got to look at the scripture and not look at the problem remember the problem is not the solution the word is the solution I surrendered life to the word is the solution to every problem praise God I mean should I read that list one more time and then I'll then the actually as the musicians come up or read this list one more time so we want unconditional love I love that is not shared with another acceptance of Who We Are we want to be understood we want Security in the relationship provision we want comfort a relationship that's unique to us alone it's not to to to to our buddies or whatever more you know that our spouse should be our best friend that we can share our deepest desires Ambitions dreams and fears worth we want attention we want forgiveness and not to be reminded of our mistakes and failings we want nothing to come between us we want leadership we want to be treasured we want to be wanted we want to be valued and that's what our wives want from us Brothers amen so praise the Lord we know what women want could write a self-help book and make millions but it's already in the Bible but it's that simple you know what you want from God then you know what your husband I mean your wife wants from you and then you can take advice Versa and then we won't know what God wants from us amen maybe that'll be
