[8:20] that with all my heart there's a few
[8:23] housekeeping rules that we want to take
[8:24] care of firstly this morning we've got
[8:26] new families in the church so we need to
[8:28] put this in place firstly for the fire
[8:32] exits in this place as we come in is a
[8:34] first exit or first entry and exit and
[8:36] the second one is the kitchen doors to
[8:39] your right there's a key on the door
[8:40] unlock the staircase going down and we
[8:43] assemble just on the side there's a
[8:46] carpark anyway I just on the side of the
[8:48] building downstairs do not cross the
[8:49] road so all kids if you're going out
[8:52] with mom and dad or you're running out
[8:53] before that please assemble down at the
[8:55] carpark and do not cross the road
[8:58] everyone will be accounted for
[9:00] afterwards
[9:00] and we will let you know when the place
[9:02] is safe if in case of emergency so yes
[9:07] there's a few things that we want to
[9:09] bring to bring delight we've worked with
[9:12] the Sunday School teachers last week and
[9:15] we set out the classes and for the
[9:16] armaan would have sent your messages as
[9:19] to who's in whose class and where our
[9:21] kids for fallen we changed from four
[9:24] classrooms to three so it's the three
[9:27] classrooms on our on our left and the
[9:30] names are all been given out as the
[9:32] lambs the Lions and the Eagles kids the
[9:38] classrooms I'd be set by the teachers
[9:40] and also spoken to the appearance so
[9:43] enjoy these classes make the best of it
[9:46] our brothers and sisters as the teachers
[9:49] in the classroom do a great job and we
[9:52] just want to thank each one of them the
[9:53] teachers also we want to thank thank the
[9:56] teachers that were there last year they
[9:59] did a great job there as well and we
[10:01] know that the Lord is using the gifts in
[10:03] our church each one with a young or old
[10:07] big or small each one's got a place to
[10:11] play or a part to play with in this
[10:13] church group and we're just thankful for
[10:16] that
[10:16] be it a musician be it a song lead or
[10:19] beat anyone even like David sitting in
[10:22] the back learning how to do the overhead
[10:25] it's wonderful to see how the Lord moves
[10:28] you know whether I'm the person playing
[10:31] that little triangle at the back thing
[10:32] just at the end of the song but I'm they
[10:35] all right so just think of yourself the
[10:39] same all right
[10:40] well it's a little triangle or with it's
[10:41] the song leading enjoy yourself be free
[10:45] in the spirit lift
[10:46] let the Lord work with you right so our
[10:50] gifts need to come out not only in the
[10:52] church but outside as well with our
[10:54] families with our friends without work
[10:56] colleagues so use that what the Lord has
[10:59] given you few things that we need to
[11:03] bring to light the church is a special
[11:08] holy sanctuary we want to try to keep it
[11:11] that way yes we are getting bigger big
[11:13] in numbers
[11:14] greater numbers but this is the space
[11:18] that we got to work with so please work
[11:21] with us as a church we want to keep the
[11:24] place holy and clean and quiet
[11:26] especially within the service after the
[11:28] service when parents or younger ones are
[11:31] praying and and and talking to God and
[11:34] if the past days praying for people in
[11:37] front try to keep our kids quiet
[11:40] moms and dads assist the other parents
[11:44] that are out in front getting prayer
[11:46] assist with their kids support sisters
[11:49] and brothers that are getting prayed for
[11:51] kids close your eyes be quiet at that
[11:54] time just let us humble ourselves while
[11:57] the play is carrying on it's very
[12:00] important that we have a breakthrough we
[12:02] enter in so please if our kids are the
[12:06] ones that need to be spoken to parents
[12:09] speak to our kids we love them dearly we
[12:11] want them not to lose that opportunity
[12:14] to be in the Lord's presence so each kid
[12:19] if you can close your eyes while mommy
[12:21] they are praying that will be really
[12:22] grateful
[12:23] I know y'all can do it because you'll do
[12:25] it in the sunday-school class and you're
[12:26] not wonderful and we'll love each one
[12:28] and each one learns from each other
[12:30] so we just want to bring these House
[12:32] Rules out the instruments in front for
[12:37] our song leaders and our worship team in
[12:41] front this instruments are really costly
[12:43] so parents if you'll see your kids come
[12:46] out to the front to touch the
[12:47] instruments or play with the instruments
[12:48] please refrain from that we don't want
[12:51] that
[12:51] we got instruments that stay in the
[12:54] church at all times our brothers and
[12:57] sisters have brought these instruments
[12:58] to the church some the church head as
[13:00] their instruments from the church but
[13:02] please respect that do not touch the
[13:05] instruments even after the church
[13:06] service or even only having a
[13:09] get together here in the church hold
[13:11] please
[13:12] do not touch the instruments I'm very
[13:18] guilty of the next one and I put my hand
[13:21] up first brothers and sisters we love
[13:23] each other we share with each other we
[13:25] bring stuff to the church to hand over
[13:28] to another brother to bless another
[13:29] sister to bless the kids can we get all
[13:32] those blessings done outside church we
[13:36] don't want clothes passed around food
[13:38] pass around or anything brought into the
[13:41] sanctuary that's supposed to be outside
[13:43] so if we want to bless another brother
[13:45] and sister please do that outside the
[13:48] church or after the church service we
[13:51] don't want to bring stuff into the
[13:53] church and leave it to the back for
[13:55] someone and they don't pick it up and
[13:57] then it builds up and builds up we got
[13:59] lots of things that we have to get rid
[14:00] of in the church and it's the people
[14:03] that are cleaning the church or putting
[14:04] up with this and packing it up and
[14:06] moving it around please refrain from
[14:08] that the kitchen facility out the back
[14:10] and the toilets out the back use it
[14:13] respect it anyone using the facilities
[14:16] please respect the facilities if the
[14:18] facilities are not clean when you come
[14:20] into church let me know please and we
[14:23] will address it
[14:24] the kitchen out the back used make sure
[14:27] you tidy up behind yourself same with
[14:29] the toilets parents when our kids are
[14:31] going to the toilets if you've seen one
[14:33] that wind and another one is going hold
[14:35] them back till one comes back sometimes
[14:38] the kids congregate at the back and we
[14:41] don't know what's happening at the back
[14:42] while we are worshiping so if you see
[14:44] one kid is going and your kid wants to
[14:46] go hold them back for a few seconds
[14:47] while the other one comes back so just
[14:49] allow the spirit to move and not to
[14:52] hinder it so when our kids gone to the
[14:53] back mom and dad are thinking where's
[14:55] the kids why are they in the back just
[14:57] we want to try to cut that away our
[14:59] space is getting confined we can only do
[15:01] so much in this space that we got but
[15:03] I'll just ask of you to respect at the
[15:05] house of the Lord thank you very much
[15:07] thank you
[15:10] alright now before you get up I just
[15:15] want to share something first this
[15:17] morning I wrote a song called take me
[15:19] home and we're gonna sing it as a
[15:21] congregation I'm not going to do it as a
[15:23] special because I think you guys are
[15:25] smart enough to pick it up quite quickly
[15:27] it's been shared it around a bit so some
[15:31] of you know it and all of that but I
[15:33] have a lot of strugglers in my life I
[15:36] know you guys are don't because you guys
[15:38] are so good but I have a lot of
[15:41] struggles and my ultimate prayer is that
[15:46] he takes me home and that is that is my
[15:50] prayer and and the chorus talks about
[15:52] you know take me home where the waters
[15:55] are sweet take me home where his
[15:56] fountains are deep with the storms fall
[15:58] asleep and but until then you know my
[16:04] prayer is that he builds my faith my
[16:06] hope my peace and my joy because those
[16:10] are the things that keep us going every
[16:11] day every day that's what keeps us going
[16:15] you know he's gave us his promises he
[16:17] gave us his word he gave us his blood
[16:20] you know we've been talking about these
[16:21] things so many times over the last month
[16:24] you know applying the blood you know
[16:28] understanding his word standing on his
[16:30] promises those are the things and and
[16:33] the fact that is in me you know and
[16:35] that's why I wrote the song is it's so
[16:38] that when I go through one of my mini
[16:40] struggles I would remember these things
[16:43] and we'll see it and and I'll sing it to
[16:46] you now we're going to sing it to you
[16:48] later
[16:49] I'll just do a verse a pre-chorus and
[16:52] the and the chorus and then now we'll

[55:16] just happens you don't realize they're
[55:17] there I mean anyway we're gonna read
[55:21] this bit of a I want to take this from a
[55:24] different angle this is just from the
[55:25] from Jesus raising Lazarus from the from
[55:28] the dead and it says here Jesus
[55:37] therefore again groaning in himself
[55:42] cometh to the cave cometh to the grave
[55:45] it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
[55:47] jesus said take away the stone marry the
[55:50] sister of him that was dead said unto
[55:52] Him Lord by this time he stinketh for he
[55:55] hath been dead for days jesus saith unto
[55:58] her said I not unto thee that if thou
[56:01] wouldest believe thou should have see
[56:03] the glory of God
[56:04] then he took away the stone from the
[56:07] place where they did then they took away
[56:09] the stone from the place where the deed
[56:11] was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes
[56:13] and said father I thank thee that thou
[56:16] has heard me and I knew that thou
[56:18] hearest me always but because of the
[56:21] people would stand by I said it that
[56:24] they may believe that thou has sent me
[56:26] and when he thus had spoken he cried
[56:29] with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and
[56:31] he that was dead came forth bound hand
[56:35] and foot with grave clothes with so with
[56:40] grave clothes and his face was bound
[56:43] about with a napkin jesus saith unto
[56:45] them loose him and let him go amen may
[56:50] the Lord bless us would you may have
[56:51] your seats this morning now I want you
[56:54] to sorry
[57:01] sorry ok that's alright now I want to
[57:07] just so I want to speak on a subject
[57:10] just from the scripture it may seem a
[57:12] bit odd but I want to speak about
[57:14] subject of fulfill your scripture we
[57:17] have a word to fulfill you know we don't
[57:19] just sit by and you know you know God
[57:21] has linked his plan with men it is it is
[57:26] unseparable God works through man God
[57:29] has always worked through man and he is
[57:32] waiting on you you have a part to play
[57:35] in his plan of redemption you have a
[57:37] part to play and so there has to be
[57:40] sorry
[57:41] oh yeah so that's just the second part
[57:43] brother Bernie just say yeah so you can
[57:44] read it we have a part two we ever we
[57:47] have a scripture to fulfill amen we have
[57:50] a part to play and I'm going to show you
[57:52] in the scripture let's go to mark this
[57:54] is not on my notes I'm sorry but this
[57:57] has got a few Gospels before we'll go to
[57:59] will go to mark and me and the end of
[58:02] the Gospel of Mark I want to encourage
[58:05] you this morning fulfill your Scripture
[58:07] I mean we've got to work to live and we
[58:10] know it's him in us living it but we've
[58:12] got a scripture to fulfill Amen is a
[58:15] portion of the word that the bride has
[58:17] to manifest upon the earth so let's not
[58:20] you know I just encourage you this
[58:22] morning fulfill fulfill your scriptures
[58:25] I mean so he sees here in mark so I
[58:27] don't have this on the overhead but but
[58:29] the book of Mark chapter 16 and we'll
[58:32] read from verse 15 now do we
[58:35] I just want to make sure you're there
[58:38] hey there yep okay and he said unto the
[58:41] emphasis Jesus instructions there's
[58:43] after he he he's come out of the grave
[58:46] he's speaking to his disciples and he
[58:49] said unto them go ye into all the world
[58:50] and preach the gospel to every creature
[58:52] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[58:55] be saved and he that believeth not shall
[58:57] be damned and these signs shall follow
[58:59] them that belief so the believed of
[59:02] these signs shall follow them and my
[59:03] name they shall cast out Devils they
[59:05] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[59:07] take up serpents and if they drink any
[59:09] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[59:11] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[59:13] shall recover
[59:14] so then after the Lord had spoken unto
[59:16] them he was received up into heaven and
[59:19] set on the right hand of God and they
[59:21] went forth preaching everywhere the Lord
[59:23] working with them and confirming the
[59:26] word with signs following
[59:28] Amen so it says then the Lord went with
[59:31] them confirming the word so God tied
[59:34] himself into us into his church I've
[59:36] commissioned you gone to all the world
[59:38] preach the gospel wherever you find the
[59:41] devil cast them out I mean these signs
[59:43] will follow you you don't have to
[59:45] manufacture anything they'll follow you
[59:47] hallelujah is wherever you go there'll
[59:49] be signs and wonders Amen you don't you
[59:52] know and remember you don't have to go
[59:54] by well HEVs all these things manifested
[59:57] me they shall in their season maybe once
[1:00:00] or twice it doesn't matter but the signs
[1:00:02] will follow the believer but we believe
[1:00:04] first I mean we believe first signs do
[1:00:07] not lead us signs follow us you take you
[1:00:10] take King Saul King Saul Samuel told him
[1:00:13] you know you'll go here so you know and
[1:00:16] you'll find your donkeys and all these
[1:00:17] things signs lead King Saul but signs
[1:00:19] follow David I mean so I want to be like
[1:00:22] King David signs followed him I mean the
[1:00:24] anointing came upon him when he was a
[1:00:26] shepherd boy and in he and he killed the
[1:00:28] lion and he killed the bear and they
[1:00:31] killed Goliath the sign followed I'll
[1:00:33] conquer everything that comes against me
[1:00:35] hallelujah so that's the signs will
[1:00:38] follow them the belief and the devil is
[1:00:41] always put well it's even in my Bible
[1:00:43] here some of the old manuscripts they
[1:00:45] don't have this part well and then some
[1:00:47] people say it's well it's not inspired
[1:00:49] and I just say well if it's not inspired
[1:00:51] and it works how much more scripture
[1:00:53] that is it that is inspired it'll work a
[1:00:55] whole bunch more but it's all inspired
[1:00:57] to me hallelujah so God works with his
[1:01:01] people amen he sees this way are we back
[1:01:07] on now this is this is brother Bernie
[1:01:11] season and the cool of the evening he
[1:01:13] had come down so this is an Eden this is
[1:01:15] in the Garden of Eden and the cool of
[1:01:17] the evening he had come down and
[1:01:18] communion with him and there he lost and
[1:01:21] there he lost that fellowship because
[1:01:23] sin would not let him do it because it
[1:01:25] was a separation between God and man and
[1:01:27] then
[1:01:28] he was made flesh and dwelt among us in
[1:01:30] order that he could he could come back
[1:01:33] again to man and live and man and
[1:01:36] restore a man to a stage of communion
[1:01:39] with him again remember this is men a
[1:01:41] woman he's talking about and give him
[1:01:43] back his god-given right that's what he
[1:01:46] did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:49] that's the father again God the Father
[1:01:52] dwelling in you working out his plan to
[1:01:54] finish his plan of redemption working
[1:01:57] through you making you say me making me
[1:02:01] a co-worker with him giving you a place
[1:02:05] giving you a part for your fallen lost
[1:02:08] brother and sister giving you his spirit
[1:02:11] giving you a spirit and his love to go
[1:02:14] hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of
[1:02:16] Eden Adam Adam right now that's what the
[1:02:20] Holy Spirit does to a man or to a woman
[1:02:23] when it strikes their into their heart
[1:02:25] and takes its abode there's a thirst and
[1:02:28] a hunger in for lost souls amen
[1:02:32] so he makes you a co-worker with him you
[1:02:35] have a part to play
[1:02:36] you got to fulfill your scriptures
[1:02:39] hallelujah amen no now I want to show
[1:02:46] you a couple of examples I've read there
[1:02:48] from mark but I want to show you this
[1:02:49] because I walk because people say well
[1:02:51] God will do it God will take care of
[1:02:53] everything you know and he will but he's
[1:02:56] relying on us he's relying on us
[1:03:00] prophecy has to be fulfilled and he uses
[1:03:03] men to fulfill his word so this is a
[1:03:06] classic example here is an ex chapter 10
[1:03:09] Cornelius now you can read it if you
[1:03:11] want I'm not going to read it but this
[1:03:12] is this is Cornelius as a Gentile and
[1:03:15] he's been praying and and he's a
[1:03:17] believer but he doesn't know that G yet
[1:03:19] the Messiah is coming he's a believer in
[1:03:21] the Old Testament what we would call the
[1:03:23] Old Testament and he's praying and an
[1:03:25] angel appears to him and the angel
[1:03:27] doesn't preach him the gospel the angel
[1:03:30] doesn't tell him that the Messiah has
[1:03:31] come and he's been crucified and he took
[1:03:34] and he took your sins upon his shoulders
[1:03:36] went up Calvary descended into hell took
[1:03:39] the keys of held into the grave of Satan
[1:03:41] on high victorious now he's alive
[1:03:44] forevermore and he's put out a spirit
[1:03:46] upon all flesh the angel didn't say
[1:03:48] anything about it
[1:03:49] yeah you see it go get Peter because God
[1:03:52] always works through his body I mean and
[1:03:55] and that's the rest of the part he so
[1:03:57] the angel instruction go get Peter
[1:03:59] because Peter cuz God works through his
[1:04:02] body I mean and Peter was part of the
[1:04:05] body hallelujah so so the angel said I
[1:04:08] mean so Cornelius sent some men they
[1:04:10] went and got Peter Peter came to
[1:04:12] Cornelius house they had a service God
[1:04:15] came down filled the Gentiles hallelujah
[1:04:18] and and here we are today glory to God
[1:04:22] so God always uses men he always uses
[1:04:26] man now we have a num now I read that
[1:04:32] scripture about Lazarus being raised
[1:04:34] it's because you notice Jesus now he was
[1:04:37] the crater and flesh all God was the
[1:04:40] fullness of Godhead bodily then he was
[1:04:42] everything God is I mean it wasn't a
[1:04:45] portion of God in a man it was all God
[1:04:46] in a man so he created all things the
[1:04:49] crater built a body for redemption and
[1:04:52] dwelt in it I mean to bring us salvation
[1:04:53] now he could have walked to the tomb and
[1:04:56] he could have see it's don't move and
[1:04:58] the stone would have moved and then what
[1:05:00] he said Lazarus come forth and that it
[1:05:02] would have come forth and then he could
[1:05:03] have said grave clothes be gone and they
[1:05:05] would have been gone but he didn't do
[1:05:07] that he he so there were people there
[1:05:10] and he said move the stone away and
[1:05:14] someone maybe who's been strong enough
[1:05:16] that their entire life had been built
[1:05:19] for that moment God uses God use God
[1:05:22] trained John the Baptist for thirty
[1:05:24] years I mean he was 30 when he started
[1:05:27] his ministry he was about he was a child
[1:05:30] eight or nine history tells us when he
[1:05:32] went into the wilderness I mean and God
[1:05:35] trained him all that time teaching him
[1:05:38] revealing himself to him in the
[1:05:39] wilderness then he'd be used for six
[1:05:41] months God does these things God will
[1:05:45] God will train someone just for a little
[1:05:47] bit I mean I mean train them for a long
[1:05:50] time just to use them a little bit and
[1:05:51] that's their port that's the scripture
[1:05:53] they have to fulfill
[1:05:55] hallelujah and so now there are people
[1:05:58] there I don't know how big the stone was
[1:06:00] but maybe there are people there that
[1:06:01] was strong enough we know how to move
[1:06:03] the stone so God brought these gifts
[1:06:06] these gifts were there
[1:06:07] amen to fulfill the word hallelujah
[1:06:10] because without anyone moving the stone
[1:06:12] Lazarus could maybe be a lively stuck in
[1:06:14] a tomb God uses God uses our hands our
[1:06:18] feet our mouth our voices our hearts
[1:06:21] Amen he's looking for willing vessels
[1:06:23] that will there'll be full prisoners as
[1:06:25] we heard about on Wednesday I mean he
[1:06:27] can manifest himself through so so there
[1:06:30] are people there due to roll the stone
[1:06:31] away and they're now here and then he
[1:06:34] says Lazarus come forth he comes back to
[1:06:36] life but he's covered in these great
[1:06:37] clothes now he was all wrapped up and
[1:06:41] maybe there's someone there who knew how
[1:06:43] to unwrap a body so maybe they are
[1:06:46] taught and how the you know how the
[1:06:48] body's prepared and everything for
[1:06:50] burial and then so he says now you loose
[1:06:52] him and let him go he didn't loosen the
[1:06:55] people had to loose him
[1:06:56] are you following me so that said
[1:06:58] whoever loosed them took the grave
[1:07:00] clothes off and they had a part to play
[1:07:02] I mean for him to come out of the grave
[1:07:05] so the body not you know the body was
[1:07:08] working that this person would come back
[1:07:10] to life I mean and they would be free I
[1:07:12] mean from what bound then hallelujah
[1:07:16] it's the same thing well it's a body
[1:07:17] work it's not a one-man band
[1:07:20] hallelujah it's not a one-man band it's
[1:07:22] a body work and we all have our part to
[1:07:25] play and it doesn't matter if you you
[1:07:28] know it doesn't matter if you're the
[1:07:30] person just they just found the first
[1:07:31] part of the but to unravel or if you did
[1:07:34] all the hard work unraveling it or
[1:07:36] whatever it was as long as you depart to
[1:07:38] play that's the main thing is as brother
[1:07:41] kuben said amen
[1:07:43] praise God if I've got a triangle at the
[1:07:45] end of the song Tinh hallelujah as long
[1:07:48] as you're part of the symphony that's
[1:07:50] the main thing that's the main thing so
[1:07:53] we're going to fulfill our part you're
[1:07:55] gonna find your part and fulfill it and
[1:07:57] you'll begin to find yourself when God
[1:08:00] gets ahold of your life he'll begin to
[1:08:02] move you into that part even and even
[1:08:05] and maybe against your own reasoning
[1:08:08] he'll begin to move you a certain way
[1:08:09] and you and you'll find him living
[1:08:12] through and be so natural hallelujah
[1:08:15] he's moving you into your place now I
[1:08:20] want to go to Genesis Genesis chapter uh

[1:09:18] are we Genesis 15:13 okay wonderful
[1:09:21] now and he said unto Abraham this is God
[1:09:25] speaking know of a surety that thy seed
[1:09:28] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[1:09:31] not this and shall serve them and they
[1:09:34] shall afflict them for hundred years and
[1:09:36] also that nation whom they shall serve
[1:09:39] will I judge and afterwards afterwards
[1:09:42] shall they come out with great substance
[1:09:45] and thou shalt go to thy father's and
[1:09:48] peace there shall be buried in a good
[1:09:50] old age but in the fourth generation
[1:09:52] they shall come hither again for the
[1:09:55] iniquity of the EM rights is not yet
[1:09:57] full now this is a prophecy God is
[1:10:02] telling them who became Abraham that his
[1:10:05] children are going to go down into Egypt
[1:10:06] they're gonna become slaves they're
[1:10:09] gonna be afflicted but I'm gonna bring
[1:10:11] them out with a mighty hand this is this
[1:10:12] is the prophecy so this word had to be
[1:10:14] fulfilled and then at the right timing
[1:10:17] God got a man in his hand and this man
[1:10:21] was Moses
[1:10:22] Moses was born to fulfill the scripture
[1:10:24] because God was going to bring them out
[1:10:27] with a mighty hand but God uses men for
[1:10:29] his plan hallelujah so so when God was
[1:10:32] speaking this to his son Abraham he
[1:10:34] already had in his mind I'm gonna have a
[1:10:36] man called Moses born and he's going to
[1:10:38] go through some trials he's going to go
[1:10:40] through some hardship
[1:10:42] hallelujah he'll be raised in Pharaoh's
[1:10:44] house I mean but he won't stay in
[1:10:45] Pharaoh's house he will esteem following
[1:10:48] Christ greater riches than all of this
[1:10:51] great superpower of Egypt hallelujah God
[1:10:54] headed in his mind already
[1:10:55] I mean God just God is not looking upon
[1:10:58] the earth and saying well maybe I can
[1:11:00] get this one or maybe I can persuade
[1:11:01] this one or how can I kind of push these
[1:11:04] ones into a corner that they'll say yes
[1:11:06] he had he had you in his mind to fulfill
[1:11:09] the scripture hallelujah but we have to
[1:11:12] yield to him I mean give ourselves to
[1:11:14] him Lord I want to see your word
[1:11:16] fulfilled in me Amen so now he comes
[1:11:20] Moses now and we know he is raised in
[1:11:23] Pharaoh's house
[1:11:24] I meant any and he kills an Egyptian he
[1:11:28] knew his mother was was his nurse and
[1:11:31] she began to just pour into him at a
[1:11:33] young age
[1:11:34] you're the deliverer God visited us
[1:11:37] before you're born now and we were
[1:11:40] praying we are stirred up we wait a
[1:11:42] burden now is the season for this
[1:11:44] prophecy we don't want to be slaves
[1:11:46] anymore
[1:11:47] hallelujah and God came to us and we
[1:11:50] knew you you're going to be the child do
[1:11:53] you think you would not pour that into
[1:11:55] them amen because you may not live long
[1:11:58] enough to see the fulfillment how lujah
[1:12:01] you'd you if you were her you were to
[1:12:03] pour it unto Him

[1:12:09] are you talking about what do you mean

[1:12:14] has promised us a land and you're gonna
[1:12:17] God is going to use you to take us to
[1:12:19] that land I may not know how he'll do it
[1:12:22] but he's going to use you to do it you'd
[1:12:25] pour it you and say all become the best
[1:12:27] Prince you can it isn't Egypt wonderful

[1:12:35] and you're gonna walk with him now I'm
[1:12:38] gonna just put it in your lap friends we
[1:12:41] may believe the rapture maybe at this
[1:12:43] right moment but we're going to prepare
[1:12:45] for the future and it should be out it's
[1:12:47] our god-given privilege to tell our
[1:12:49] children if we be not the ones that are
[1:12:52] alive and remain someone's going to be
[1:12:54] here to fulfill it so I would pour it
[1:12:57] unto them your bodies are going to be
[1:12:59] changed the same God you feel I'm in the
[1:13:02] when he steps into the place that one is
[1:13:05] going to change the atoms in your body
[1:13:07] hallelujah it may not be me all we did
[1:13:09] in the grave waiting but I'll come forth
[1:13:12] first hallelujah because if you die if
[1:13:14] you're alive
[1:13:15] you win if you're in Christ that is I
[1:13:18] mean so I pour it unto them afar as you
[1:13:21] Jesus loves us I mean he's our Father
[1:13:24] I mean he's redeemed us his blood is
[1:13:26] more than enough hallelujah we have full
[1:13:29] redemption I mean his word is true make
[1:13:32] sure you pour that into your children
[1:13:33] your word is his word is true God is not
[1:13:36] a man that can lie I mean this this is
[1:13:40] being made fun of it's been diminished
[1:13:42] and I'll put the message in here - it's
[1:13:45] been ridiculed it's been diminished
[1:13:47] people say it's man's ideas it's not
[1:13:49] man's ideas this word has been proven
[1:13:52] over and over and over and over again
[1:13:56] this is God and print don't diminish it
[1:14:00] - someone's opinion and the culture of
[1:14:02] the day and this is how they did things
[1:14:04] forget those things God didn't write his
[1:14:07] word just for a culture he's the same
[1:14:09] yesterday today and forever I mean so
[1:14:11] it's word applied there it applies now
[1:14:13] it'll play tomorrow it will apply next
[1:14:16] week it is true
[1:14:18] Amen I just stand on his word so I may
[1:14:21] not understand all things but Lord your
[1:14:23] word is true I know you inspired men and
[1:14:26] you bypass a mental ideas
[1:14:28] you took their hands whatever hand they
[1:14:30] were they begin to write hallelujah
[1:14:33] they wrote down imagine being Moses tell
[1:14:36] them you're the weakest man in all the
[1:14:37] earth tell them you had a temper
[1:14:39] hallelujah I mean if he was writing
[1:14:42] Abraham's life and Abraham could stand
[1:14:44] there he would say don't write that I
[1:14:46] back slid don't write that I denied that
[1:14:48] that Sarah
[1:14:49] my wife just to preserve my embody yeah
[1:14:52] don't write all of my shame and all my
[1:14:54] failings please don't write it but it
[1:14:56] was God writing it was God writing and
[1:14:58] it wasn't just in Genesis all the way
[1:15:00] through hallelujah
[1:15:03] so now Moses Moses is commissioned he
[1:15:07] knows well before he's commissioned he
[1:15:09] knows he said he knows he is the
[1:15:11] deliverer and so she is now is the
[1:15:13] opportunity he kills one Egyptian this
[1:15:16] is man trying to fulfill the scripture
[1:15:17] in his own strength amen Ollie and he
[1:15:20] tries to deliver Israel he ends up
[1:15:23] killing one man and he's on the run
[1:15:25] and God has to take him this is why we
[1:15:28] have to go through a molding brother
[1:15:31] Bram speaks about thee about the burning
[1:15:33] sands where men are molded into Saints
[1:15:37] the burning deserts of experience where
[1:15:40] men are molded into Saint each is how we
[1:15:42] thank you Lord for these things and God
[1:15:45] will take us that's a good thing it's a
[1:15:48] good thing I don't want to be molded
[1:15:49] into this world I'll be molded into him
[1:15:52] how Elysee it's a good thing so he had
[1:15:55] to take Moses and get Moses out of Moses
[1:15:57] see he could pour himself into Moses and
[1:15:59] use him for what he should have been
[1:16:01] doing hallelujah and then so now he goes
[1:16:04] to UM and then now he's ready and then
[1:16:08] he goes to fulfill of Scripture and he
[1:16:13] does it the thing is he does it
[1:16:15] he's an 80 year old man with a wife two
[1:16:18] kids going down into Egypt you know and
[1:16:22] he and he takes over let my what he
[1:16:25] wanted to achieve
[1:16:26] he achieved under the blood of bulls and
[1:16:29] goats under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:16:31] he delivered a people out of the
[1:16:33] greatest nation at that time he did it
[1:16:36] that's under the blood of bulls and
[1:16:38] goats how much under the blood of Jesus
[1:16:40] Christ do you think King David when he
[1:16:46] would he when he would begin to write as
[1:16:48] the heart Penna for the water Brooks so
[1:16:50] most soul Long's after thee and he had
[1:16:53] such a desire Amen to be where God was
[1:16:56] and to serve him and to love him he was
[1:17:00] just under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:17:02] do you think if he came into this age he
[1:17:06] would be rejoicing thank you
[1:17:08] I always forget something when I come
[1:17:10] here I appreciate it
[1:17:12] he would have you know here he is under
[1:17:15] the blood of bulls ago she has this
[1:17:16] longing take me into your tabernacle I
[1:17:20] want to be where you are my heart longs
[1:17:24] for you but there's a separation between
[1:17:26] him and God because because he was just
[1:17:30] under the blood of bulls and goats but
[1:17:32] now how do you think he would feel
[1:17:34] coming into this age and then he would
[1:17:37] actually say do you mean God has
[1:17:39] released a power that actually change it
[1:17:41] can change your heart of a person that
[1:17:43] God could more than just anoint but he
[1:17:45] can end well hallelujah he'd get beside
[1:17:48] himself his cup would really run over I
[1:17:51] mean do you mean God can actually more
[1:17:53] than just anoint you but he can dwell in
[1:17:55] you I mean there's more than just you
[1:17:57] know it being anointed in the anointing
[1:17:59] leaves but a spurt and dwells I mean
[1:18:02] that you become the dwelling place the
[1:18:04] Almighty God he'd get excited you mean
[1:18:07] God has released a power you can be this
[1:18:09] kind of person hallelujah that's more
[1:18:11] than just a longing but you be get to
[1:18:13] live out that longing you get to
[1:18:15] actually that longing gets met hello
[1:18:19] beautiful fill out Scripture amen now we
[1:18:25] have I'm just gonna talk from my heart
[1:18:27] for a little bit God came to Mary now we
[1:18:30] can go all through the Bible remember he
[1:18:32] told me he told the children of Israel I
[1:18:35] give you the land it's your land but
[1:18:38] they had to go fight I mean they had a
[1:18:40] part to play
[1:18:41] he says I'll Drive them out before you
[1:18:43] but you're gonna go fight so the land
[1:18:45] was given the land was given but they
[1:18:47] had to go possess that land it's the
[1:18:50] same so and the people who looked at the
[1:18:52] promise who looks at the promise the
[1:18:55] people don't look at don't look at what
[1:18:57] you may be facing and the Giants in your
[1:18:59] life look at the promise look at the
[1:19:02] promise that's the thing only belief
[1:19:04] don't worry about the circumstance look
[1:19:06] at the promise if God said that I would
[1:19:08] be I'd be more than a conqueror I am
[1:19:11] more than a conquerer doesn't matter
[1:19:13] what enemy I've got to conquer it's
[1:19:15] gonna die I'm gonna win Alleluia
[1:19:19] so they the people who looked at the
[1:19:21] promise you know the Bible says forget
[1:19:24] the things which are in the past Paul
[1:19:26] the Apostle Paul forgetting the things
[1:19:28] which are in the past now that's pretty
[1:19:31] straight what does that mean forget it
[1:19:33] forget the things which are in the past
[1:19:35] press onto the mark of the high calling
[1:19:37] they meant so don't worry about my oh
[1:19:40] you say well I failed just coming to
[1:19:42] church place it under the blood forget
[1:19:44] about it I mean don't worry about any
[1:19:46] you know oh but I did this and I did
[1:19:48] this and I seen this I should have done
[1:19:50] that put it under the blood walk on
[1:19:53] forgive the things which are in the past
[1:19:55] don't worry about those things God
[1:19:57] allowed those things you know God allows
[1:19:59] us to fail God allows us to fall on our
[1:20:02] face do you know that I mean he he
[1:20:05] allows it to happen that you will know
[1:20:07] this by his blood it's by his Spirit
[1:20:10] that's how you live it's not you doing
[1:20:12] it sometimes we think I'm such a good
[1:20:14] Christian he is determined there's a lot
[1:20:29] of proud people in this world but he
[1:20:31] does not want pride there's waste pride
[1:20:33] before the fall but I'm so humble
[1:20:36] I'm doing so well and we can become
[1:20:38] proud in our humility if it's if it's
[1:20:40] man-made false humility and he tries you
[1:20:51] and he test your knee he allows things
[1:20:53] because he has a perfect picture of you
[1:20:55] an eternity
[1:20:57] he has a perfect picture but then we
[1:20:59] have to come to a spot and you gonna
[1:21:01] come through experience it's only by you
[1:21:04] I've only by you molding and shaping me
[1:21:09] why do you fall on your face you realize
[1:21:11] I have this in me we we war with this
[1:21:15] humanity I do quite a lot but God
[1:21:18] allowed us to be built in such a way
[1:21:21] he's not surprised you have the
[1:21:23] personality you have he's not surprised
[1:21:26] you have the traits you have he knew
[1:21:28] you'd have them he has the ability to
[1:21:32] change you but sometimes he leaves you
[1:21:34] know sometimes you know which I cannot
[1:21:37] be more suberin
[1:21:38] why can't be more you know expressive
[1:21:41] and God says but I didn't make you that
[1:21:43] way we're gonna be comfortable in our
[1:21:45] own shoes right but there's some things
[1:21:49] like temper and indifference and
[1:21:51] unforgiveness that all those things we
[1:21:53] received you know I mean to have those
[1:21:54] kind of things you know I trust that
[1:21:56] comes out okay now so Moses now they
[1:22:00] were told they'll receive the land and
[1:22:02] those who believed that they fulfilled
[1:22:04] the scripture that they would possess
[1:22:06] that land now God gives us the ability
[1:22:10] to fulfill our scriptures
[1:22:12] amen he gives us the ability he is Mary
[1:22:15] now he's Marian this has to be us the
[1:22:18] angel comes to Mary there's a prophecy a
[1:22:20] virgin shall conceive and many many
[1:22:23] people thought that was going to be
[1:22:25] their daughter but for 800 years about
[1:22:28] it just sat there in the scripture then
[1:22:30] finally for the right season and the
[1:22:33] right person because when God as I said
[1:22:35] about Moses when God was speaking
[1:22:37] through Isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[1:22:39] God had in his mind Mary and she'll be
[1:22:42] in a certain city in a certain time
[1:22:44] that'll be her and then the angel comes
[1:22:47] to her you're going to have the promised
[1:22:49] son you're going to fulfill this part of
[1:22:51] the scripture and she just said let it
[1:22:53] be unto me according to thy word
[1:22:56] hallelujah this has going to be let it
[1:22:58] be unto me according to thy word
[1:23:00] hallelujah
[1:23:01] and then God caused a virgin to conceive
[1:23:04] a following me and she fulfilled her
[1:23:07] part of the scripture Jesus knew the
[1:23:12] Scriptures he had to fulfill
[1:23:15] he says for this cause I've come into
[1:23:17] the world he knew he was the Lamb of God
[1:23:19] and he spent about six hours talking to
[1:23:24] the Opus and his friend on the way to
[1:23:26] Emmaus and Luke chapter 24 starting at
[1:23:29] Moses he went through all the prophecies
[1:23:31] and everything that he fulfilled in you
[1:23:35] had come to fulfill the scripture now
[1:23:38] here we are
[1:23:40] here we are in this day
[1:23:42] we've got scriptures to fulfill I mean
[1:23:45] God started his work
[1:23:46] remember the apostles the life member
[1:23:49] their book of Acts is not the Acts of
[1:23:51] the Apostles
[1:23:51] it's the Acts of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:23:53] Apostles that is the true name of the
[1:23:56] book of Acts and the book of Acts is
[1:23:58] still being written
[1:24:00] hallelujah it's still being manifested
[1:24:02] it doesn't stop with whatever the last
[1:24:05] chapter of the book of Acts is it's gone
[1:24:06] right through history and it's now here
[1:24:09] and we are still writing a book of Acts
[1:24:11] I mean we're still writing a book of
[1:24:13] Acts but God is still using the same
[1:24:15] program he uses his body upon the earth
[1:24:18] to fulfill his word now we can't just
[1:24:25] talk about the scripture we have to
[1:24:28] become the scripture I mean we have to
[1:24:31] the word has to become manifest many
[1:24:34] times we just talk about Jesus and the
[1:24:35] word became manifest at him but that's
[1:24:37] just the man what about the what about
[1:24:39] the woman the bride the word has to
[1:24:41] become manifested in her amen
[1:24:44] so now see if I'm find this we have to
[1:24:55] be sensitive now this may be a bit rough
[1:25:00] pieces and the unfailing realities of
[1:25:02] living God I've often thought this and
[1:25:04] we're closing Church listen to these
[1:25:06] remarks I've often thought what what why
[1:25:09] how we've deprived ourselves how we've
[1:25:11] robbed god of his plan by not
[1:25:13] surrendering our lives completely to him
[1:25:15] everything that we have to to him how
[1:25:18] that we have disallowed his program how
[1:25:21] we've lingered and have made him to wait
[1:25:23] and wait and wait trying to find
[1:25:25] somebody that he could work through
[1:25:27] trying to find a man somewhere that he
[1:25:30] could put confidence in some men that
[1:25:32] would surrender everything you say well
[1:25:36] God God has his timing but he gave us a
[1:25:39] free moral agency he doesn't step over
[1:25:42] he doesn't force you to do anything he's
[1:25:44] a gentleman he's a gentleman he's
[1:25:47] waiting on you that some man would
[1:25:51] surrender everything
[1:25:53] that his plan would be done God's
[1:25:57] waiting on us friends he say well he
[1:26:00] putting a whole works burden upon us no
[1:26:02] I'm not
[1:26:03] I want his plan to be manifested in our
[1:26:06] lives not just individually but but as a
[1:26:08] body God has a plan
[1:26:11] there's scriptures when we read about
[1:26:13] the book of when we read the New
[1:26:15] Testament a lot of its prophecy amen and
[1:26:18] then when he talks let's go to this go
[1:26:20] to he Ephesians chapter 4 my prayer is
[1:26:26] let's not plateaued
[1:26:28] let's mature let's grow in grace let's
[1:26:32] become more like him every day I mean
[1:26:34] let's not just just take it casually and
[1:26:36] eyes and everything wonderful no let's
[1:26:39] let's thank him for what he's done but
[1:26:42] we got a word to fulfill we've got a
[1:26:44] scripture to fulfill let's go to
[1:26:48] Ephesians chapter 4 I know
[1:26:49] read this a few times but let's just
[1:26:54] keep this in the forefront of our minds
[1:26:57] sofie's anne's 4 and verse 12 we just
[1:27:00] read from here we can't let's not just
[1:27:06] be let's not be satisfied
[1:27:09] you know yo we have salvation I trust if
[1:27:13] you have eternal life rejoice and the
[1:27:16] fact he died for you just rejoice in
[1:27:17] that amen Jesus is paid at all ma'am he
[1:27:21] doesn't let's just I just pray for my
[1:27:24] heart because many times you say well
[1:27:25] how could I for Phil it I can't fulfill
[1:27:27] it I'm unworthy I'm not able God took a
[1:27:29] bunch of slaves out of Egypt and He
[1:27:32] fulfilled his word God took fishermen
[1:27:35] prostitutes demon-possessed people all
[1:27:38] different kinds of people you know when
[1:27:40] he is here in the days of his flesh and
[1:27:42] he made them into the church to fulfill
[1:27:45] his word that's why I forget the things
[1:27:48] which are in the past don't weigh where
[1:27:50] you've been put it make sure it's under
[1:27:52] the blood and you've made it right but
[1:27:55] just walk on walk on you know the devil
[1:27:59] is a very good historian
[1:28:01] he's a very good historian we're not
[1:28:03] called to be historians
[1:28:05] he's a prison guard he's the great I am
[1:28:08] Devils I say and look back and you did
[1:28:11] this and he did this and this is back
[1:28:12] here and no gods present he's fulfilling
[1:28:15] his word here today right now I mean
[1:28:19] Sophie jhin's 4 and 12 yep okay so for
[1:28:24] the perfecting of the Saints now that
[1:28:26] we're perfecting it as a maturing for
[1:28:29] the work of the ministry for the
[1:28:30] edifying of the body of Christ till they
[1:28:32] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:28:35] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[1:28:37] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:28:40] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:28:42] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:28:44] to and fro and carried about with every
[1:28:46] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[1:28:48] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:28:50] and wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:28:53] truth and love may grow up into him in
[1:28:56] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:28:58] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:29:00] together and compacted by that which
[1:29:03] every joint supplieth according to the
[1:29:06] effectual working in the measure of
[1:29:08] every part maketh increase of the body
[1:29:11] until the edifying of itself in love
[1:29:14] this is what we are aiming becoming I
[1:29:17] mean every joint supplieth I mean she
[1:29:21] can be in the sunday-school you can just
[1:29:23] sing in the service and God comes down
[1:29:25] you can pray I mean you can be praying
[1:29:28] before the service praying for one
[1:29:29] another
[1:29:30] amen in your prayer closet and you see
[1:29:32] God coming and answer your prayers
[1:29:34] that's a joint in the body and remember
[1:29:36] it's normally though yes you know it's
[1:29:38] like my body that it's the unseen parts
[1:29:41] which are really the most valuable amen
[1:29:45] you don't see my brain but if it got
[1:29:47] removed you would know its unseen I mean
[1:29:51] you can break a little bone like break a
[1:29:53] little toe bone or something and you
[1:29:55] would never ever normally think about
[1:29:57] that part of you until it's hurting
[1:29:59] it's very you'll fight it's very
[1:30:01] important when it's hurting I need this
[1:30:04] to be fixed it's like every part of the
[1:30:07] body it's all important it's all going
[1:30:10] to be there amen and it doesn't matter
[1:30:12] it doesn't matter what part of the body
[1:30:14] we are we can be very visible we may be
[1:30:16] very invisible
[1:30:18] the invisible parts often are more
[1:30:20] important than the visible parts brother
[1:30:23] Bram said the reason is meetings as
[1:30:24] successful as people are praying for
[1:30:26] them people praying for the service you
[1:30:28] may never see those people you may never
[1:30:31] hear them on tape but they are praying I
[1:30:33] mean they're asking that God would come
[1:30:35] and meet you you know take that man of
[1:30:38] God Minister his word heal the sick amen
[1:30:41] set the captives free you never see them
[1:30:44] on tape but they are very important he
[1:30:46] said the success of my meetings of those
[1:30:48] people the unseen part the unseen part
[1:30:53] and that's why we've got to fight for
[1:30:55] full your scripture whatever part of the
[1:30:58] body you are I mean we can all be
[1:31:01] preachers or deacons or song leaders or
[1:31:03] musicians or whatever but we've got a
[1:31:05] role we've got a part of the body that
[1:31:08] we are there's a reason everyone is
[1:31:10] valuable in the body of Christ
[1:31:13] there's no just oh you're a few warmers
[1:31:16] or you know people who are just there to
[1:31:18] fill out a place that we're all
[1:31:20] important we're all important we're all
[1:31:23] needed and that's the reason that that
[1:31:25] we've been gathered together it's like
[1:31:27] every Church God brings different gifts
[1:31:29] to complement the other gifts that every
[1:31:32] joint would supply hallelujah we're all
[1:31:35] important in the body but we're going to
[1:31:37] fulfill our part of the body I just may
[1:31:40] be speaking kind of broad terms this
[1:31:42] morning but I want you to think about it
[1:31:43] I mean we're not here just as a hip hat
[1:31:45] for haphazard reason just to go through
[1:31:48] emotion but we have scripture to fulfill
[1:31:51] hallelujah so we have to grow and to the
[1:31:55] fullness of the statue of Christ
[1:31:56] it takes us word to do it amen
[1:31:59] it takes us word to do it and that's why
[1:32:01] brother Brahim says we should pray for
[1:32:03] revelation more than anything else I
[1:32:06] meant more than more money or a nicer
[1:32:09] house pray Lord reveal your word to me I
[1:32:12] may have read it a million times but I
[1:32:15] may have caught nothing I want to make
[1:32:18] it more than just in here it's more than
[1:32:20] memorizing scriptures and quotes but
[1:32:22] it's got an anchor in here and produce a
[1:32:24] life I mean that's what it needs to do
[1:32:26] and that's why revelation will produce a
[1:32:28] life and will produce a character you
[1:32:31] see Mose
[1:32:32] he was raised in Pharaoh's house he was
[1:32:35] he was going to be the next Pharaoh
[1:32:36] potentially now royalty member the
[1:32:39] Pharaohs in those days they were gods
[1:32:41] and I've said this quite a few times but
[1:32:43] the Pharaoh in Egypt he was a God and
[1:32:45] flesh so Moses was going to become of
[1:32:48] that he was a little meek little quiet
[1:32:49] fellow when he was there I'm the Prince
[1:32:52] of Egypt he would have had a persona
[1:32:54] around him but then he comes into the
[1:32:57] backside of the desert God malts then
[1:32:59] he's ready he goes up Mount Sinai God
[1:33:02] comes down delivers his word and then he
[1:33:07] writes he's the meekest man and all the
[1:33:09] earth what how did he become that way
[1:33:11] because God revealed himself that's a
[1:33:14] characteristic of the you know that's
[1:33:16] the nature of God coming into someone
[1:33:18] under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:33:21] hallelujah now he received the
[1:33:23] revelation that made him that way the
[1:33:25] scribes and Pharisees they had they had
[1:33:28] the revelation Moses received they
[1:33:31] learned that revelation they studied
[1:33:34] that revelation they read it they stated
[1:33:37] it they were proud arrogant people it
[1:33:39] didn't produce a character of Christ on
[1:33:41] them you follow me one's gone very quiet
[1:33:44] maybe you're thinking a little bit
[1:33:46] that's why it's got to go revelation
[1:33:49] reveal your word to me every scripture
[1:33:52] every message Lord whatever your mind is
[1:33:56] in that word transmitted it down into me
[1:33:59] that it will produce a character and me
[1:34:02] hallelujah that's what we need
[1:34:07] we've a word to fulfill you know we
[1:34:10] oftentimes we talk about a rapture
[1:34:12] that's part of the scripture we're to
[1:34:14] fulfill amen but we're going to go back
[1:34:17] and we're going to look at now and and I
[1:34:19] want in this service but maybe later
[1:34:22] our husbands treat wives and wives treat
[1:34:25] husbands and our children I mean parents
[1:34:27] treat children and children parents
[1:34:29] that's fulfilling Scripture you say it's
[1:34:32] just a common everyday thing for
[1:34:33] husbands to love their wives and wives
[1:34:35] love their husbands and you know fathers
[1:34:39] not to provoke their children you know
[1:34:40] and you know make them angry that they'd
[1:34:42] be discouraged and every thinks that's
[1:34:44] fulfilling Scripture
[1:34:45] you say that's just a common everyday
[1:34:47] thing the Scriptures everyday common
[1:34:49] things it's not just some big theory out
[1:34:52] there somewhere it comes down into flesh
[1:34:55] hallelujah and it manifests are you
[1:34:57] following me we've got a scripture to
[1:34:59] fulfill you know you gotta go back into
[1:35:02] you go back into the scripture
[1:35:04] remember our ingo the fullness of
[1:35:06] redemption is the change of the body to
[1:35:08] the adoption the would yo the change of
[1:35:10] the body that's that's in the future but
[1:35:12] it's got to start happening now I mean
[1:35:15] because because as our nature and
[1:35:17] character becomes like our theophany
[1:35:19] amen like like how God sees us our
[1:35:22] eternal body that's reserved in the
[1:35:23] heavens as that becomes we as the
[1:35:26] character become more like that image
[1:35:28] and as that image comes together as one
[1:35:30] in the rapture will go amen because God
[1:35:34] has a picture of us God's molding our
[1:35:36] character he knows the end goal he's a
[1:35:38] very good project manager he's a very
[1:35:42] good project manager he knows now this
[1:35:44] is what my goal is I'm gonna have a
[1:35:46] people made in my image and I know and
[1:35:49] and that's not some lofty term for him
[1:35:51] he knows exactly what that is for each
[1:35:52] of us amen
[1:35:54] and so now he's got stages on a timeline
[1:35:58] of how I'm going to get them in
[1:36:00] hallelujah so that's why I say the image
[1:36:03] he has in his mind of you you have to
[1:36:06] become like that image which is this
[1:36:10] made flesh I mean that's why we read the
[1:36:13] scripture I heard Francois Lipper card
[1:36:15] say it just just as a comment he said
[1:36:17] when he reads this Bible and I've tried
[1:36:20] to get on board he says when he reached
[1:36:21] the word he does it he lays himself
[1:36:24] before God say God as I read your word
[1:36:27] now make me like your word it's not a
[1:36:31] now I'm going to study this thing out
[1:36:32] and work how it goes and see how this
[1:36:34] happens and no you let yourself before
[1:36:36] him and say Lord what I read and the
[1:36:39] character this is a revelation of a
[1:36:41] person it's the same thing with the
[1:36:43] message you know there's a character
[1:36:45] coming forth through that message goes
[1:36:47] beyond doctrine and terminology but
[1:36:49] there's a life being manifested and so
[1:36:52] as we hear that message and read the
[1:36:54] Bible and pray should be Lord change me
[1:36:57] he's looking for people made in His
[1:36:59] image we have to fulfill it's gonna be
[1:37:01] it's not just part like in like in
[1:37:04] Luther's day or Wesley's day of the
[1:37:05] Pentecostal day this is they had part of
[1:37:08] it and they'll be there like we'll be
[1:37:10] there but he's looking for a people make
[1:37:11] totally in his image
[1:37:13] hallelujah and that's the part of the
[1:37:15] scripture where to fulfill amen
[1:37:18] we're not just gonna be he's he's going
[1:37:21] to take in a rapture mature people amen
[1:37:26] no don't get the scars all but I'm down
[1:37:28] here and it's up there how do you know
[1:37:30] that you're down here and it's up there
[1:37:33] what we look at ourselves how we view
[1:37:35] ourselves and how God views us can be
[1:37:38] miles apart one into the universe to the
[1:37:42] other and we can look at ourselves and
[1:37:43] say but I've never been victorious now
[1:37:46] there's just the devil telling you these
[1:37:47] things you'll never overcome you think
[1:37:50] you'll be there you call yourself a
[1:37:52] Christian you have no right that it
[1:37:54] editor know Lord what have you said I am
[1:37:59] you you believe it and then you receive
[1:38:02] it
[1:38:03] amen you don't receive it then believe
[1:38:06] it you believe it and then you receive
[1:38:07] it Abraham you're going to have a
[1:38:10] promise son we're gonna have a sudden
[1:38:12] Sarah 25 years later here's the son but
[1:38:16] he believed it and then he received it
[1:38:19] hallelujah
[1:38:20] you can take it all through the
[1:38:21] scripture that's how we have to be I'm
[1:38:27] not gonna go on much longer but I want
[1:38:29] you to think about it you say well how
[1:38:31] can I grow to the fullness of statue of
[1:38:32] Christ how can all that know Lord and he
[1:38:35] started to work in you
[1:38:38] have you given castle your cares upon
[1:38:40] him because he cares you have you laid
[1:38:42] yourself totally surrendered to him and
[1:38:45] that's his word have you given yourself
[1:38:47] Lord whatever your word says I want to
[1:38:50] do it because I love you that's my
[1:38:52] motivation it's not that I earn some
[1:38:55] name or become famous and some Christian
[1:38:58] realm or whatever I'm not interested in
[1:39:00] that we're not building a kingdom an
[1:39:02] earthly Kingdom I mean for some church
[1:39:04] brand to go forth or something forget
[1:39:06] that kind of thing we're here that
[1:39:08] people would become one with Jesus
[1:39:10] Christ I mean that be united with him it
[1:39:13] doesn't matter if there's no name on the
[1:39:15] building if there is a who cares about
[1:39:16] that stuff when I understood and you
[1:39:19] know that kind of thing well people that
[1:39:20] become 1 have a true spiritual
[1:39:22] relationship with Jesus Christ that's
[1:39:24] the reason we're here hallelujah that we
[1:39:27] would grow to the fullest of his image I
[1:39:29] don't care if I'm not even a footnote in
[1:39:32] history I don't care about that kind of
[1:39:35] thing I'm not interested I trust you all
[1:39:37] the same kind of way I'd rather be an
[1:39:40] unknown who cares what people say I want
[1:39:43] to serve Him amen and we all have a
[1:39:46] reward up there who cares about the
[1:39:48] praise of men down here doesn't matter

[1:44:18] a testimony let's have a microphone
[1:44:28] hello everybody I'm Fe and I'm from
[1:44:33] Greece Oh forgive my English is not my
[1:44:36] first language a year ago I had an awful
[1:44:41] pain and and they found that the hottest
[1:44:51] stone in my gallbladder and I had to
[1:44:53] remove my god brother and then we moved
[1:44:58] here to Wellington and I saw a
[1:45:00] specialist and I asked him if I should
[1:45:04] have another scam before the surgery and
[1:45:08] he said no need if you had it once it's
[1:45:11] there
[1:45:12] God bloggers are like stone factories
[1:45:15] and if it had passed through your system
[1:45:19] it would have been with so much pain
[1:45:22] that you would have known so I trust him
[1:45:26] and I was in the waiting list for the
[1:45:30] surgery during the time I was reading
[1:45:33] provost branham's story and he talked
[1:45:40] about a lady having a stone cold bladder
[1:45:43] and so I prayed and I asked him to heal
[1:45:46] me last Wednesday I went to surgery and
[1:45:51] the doctor before asked me if I wanted
[1:45:55] to keep the stones another yeah it would
[1:45:58] be funny to show it to my daughter in
[1:46:00] love but it and after the surgery I said
[1:46:04] Oh have my stones and he said no stones
[1:46:08] you complied I was totally normal there
[1:46:12] was no story stone in it
[1:46:14] nothing it was completely normal
[1:46:17] I said how that happened is that I don't
[1:46:22] know if the stones had gone through your
[1:46:25] system you would have known because you
[1:46:27] would have heard so much and felt so
[1:46:32] blessed in her I thought I said to God
[1:46:35] wait since he heard me white
[1:46:38] to allow the surgery to happen why and
[1:46:43] then I remembered that last Sunday
[1:46:46] before the surgery I came here and I had
[1:46:49] a list of things that I wanted to pray
[1:46:51] for and I couldn't concentrate and I
[1:46:54] said God I forget the list please make
[1:46:59] my faith stronger because that's the
[1:47:02] most important everything else is gonna
[1:47:04] happen if my faith is strong and I
[1:47:07] realized that if I hadn't been through
[1:47:09] the surgery I wouldn't have known that I
[1:47:27] mean I got is real yeah amen I mean
