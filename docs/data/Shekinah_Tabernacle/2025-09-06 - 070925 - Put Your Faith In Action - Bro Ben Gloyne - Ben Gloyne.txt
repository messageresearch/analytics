TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. I've been there. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you all this morning. Good to see you all. It's good to be here and have an opportunity this morning to worship the Lord, to meet with him and to be refreshed and renewed by his presence. And today is also um Father's Day. Two things I want to say about that. I always loved my father. There was never a time in my life where I didn't love my father where I I've never never never run him down. I never ever never really dishonored him willingly. Maybe when I was a kid or teenage years. No, even then I never did. Always loved my father. And it's a good for a person to love their father. And um it's a very powerful concept because it's the only it's the first the Bible calls it the first commandment with promise is if we honor our father and mother then our days will be long upon the earth. And it it has to be that way because the natural always has to type the spiritual. There's always got to be there's got to be a picture painted you know. And in the natural we honor our natural father, natural mother, our parents. then we get a a long life here. And in the spiritual, if we honor our heaven spiritual heavenly father, then we get a long life, very very long life, eternity. And that it it just has to work that way. So let's um stand this morning and just approach our heavenly fathers this morning. Lord, we thank you for our natural fathers, Lord, that some are this way, some are that way, some we know, some we don't, Lord, and and we we get this what's called the grab bag of life where where we just get a different lot each one, Lord. But we thank you, Lord, that we can all have the same heavenly father, Lord, that there's a great spiritual heavenly father that loves us and that cares for us and that but treats us like sons and daughters. Lord, you you encourage us when we go the right way and you discourage us when we go the wrong way, Lord, because you have a you have such a fatherly love for us, Lord, and you care for us. And we read in your word, Lord, that you call us the apple of your eye, Lord. And we often experience that ourselves with our own children. We if they're in the playground playing or if they're somewhere, we always seem to look at our own ones. We know what they're up to, what they're doing cuz they they attract us, Lord. Lord, and we know that wherever we are, your eyes is always upon us, Lord, that you're looking upon us cuz we attract you, Lord, because we are your sons and daughters. So, we just come this morning, Lord, to worship and to praise you. May you just bless us, Lord. May you minister to us in a powerful way. Bless Brother Ben as he brings your word, Lord. May he just step aside and let you speak through him as we always experience that he does, Lord. So, we thank you for that. We thank you for the anointing that he has in his life, Lord, to minister and to be a pastor. We just pray a blessing upon him and his family, Lord. just just bless us this morning, Lord, as we enter into your your courts with praise and thanksgiving in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Amen.

So why don't we just let him change our lives this morning. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. Thank you. Musicians. Amen. Praise the Lord. I believe he's present among us. Don't you? Amen. His word said, "Where two or three gathered in my name, there I am in the midst." So, why don't we as we worship the Lord this morning, just express yourself as you just imagine you had a had a one-on-one audience with the Lord Jesus. What would you tell him? What would you express? I tell you what, you can have that this morning. Have a one-on-one conference with our God. I mean, he's not here to tell you where you've gone wrong. He's tell you where you've gone right, what he's done for you, and everything he's done. Amen. So, why don't you just have that one-on-one conference with God, amen, this morning. I mean, he's not ashamed of you. He's proud of you. He's pleased with you. He's our father. Amen. Happy Father's Day, Fathers. Amen. Praise the Lord. So all those wrong turns you would undo and all those things, he took those to Calvary. Regrets and shame and guilt, he took it all away. So why carry it? Amen. Why Why let it rule you? Amen. Why don't you let his faith rule you and let's praise God today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's great to have everyone here today. Amen. Great to have David here. God bless you, bro. Welcome. Good to have you. God bless you. Amen. Good to see you. Amen. It's It's great to have Susanna here. God bless you. Amen. God bless you, Richley. Great to have you here. Amen. It's great to have Kim and Shantel and the boys here. God bless you. Amen. Amen. I trust you all feel at home. Amen. Let's just gather around the fire and have a good time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's um let's go to um let's go to Mark chapter 2. Um and and also we have a brother somewhere from Shakina Glory Tabernacle. Oh, him. Hi. Hi, bro. That's Arman by the way. Amen. Great to have you here. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so are we here? Can we drive this? Yes. So, so Mark, I just got to rearrange this a bit. Let's just kind of go here a bit. Okay. So, Mark chapter 2. Amen. You know, they call uh the book of Mark is, you know, the you the works book as in the fa you the ox anointing, you know, what the Lord did. I call it the faith book. It's faith in action. And we're going to read this. I know I I I read this a few uh services ago, whenever that was the other day. Um but I just want to go into this a bit more because I really enjoy this story phenomenally. So I pray this will be a real blessing. Amen. So Mark 2:3-12 says here, "And they came unto him bringing one sick of Pauly which was born of four. And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken it up, they let down the bed uh wherein the sick of Pauly lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the Pauly, "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee." But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reason and and reasoning in their hearts, "Why do this man thus speak blas blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?" And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reason within themselves, he said unto them, "Why reason ye these things in your hearts? Whether it is easy to say to the sick of Pauly, "Thy sins be forgiven thee." Or say, "Arise, take up thy bed and walk." But that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he saith to the sick of the pulsey, I say unto thee, arise, take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. And immediately he arose, took up the bed, went forth before them all, and so much they all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we're just going to go to uh Hebrews chap 11 and we're going to read just just a few verses. Hebrews 11 and 32-35. Amen. Just say amen when you're when you're there or you're scrolled there or whatever you've done to get there. Just say amen when you're there. Amen. In Hebrews 11 and and uh 32-35 says, "And what shall I more say? For the time shall fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barack, of Samson, of Jeffany, of David, also in Samuel, and of the prophets, who through faith subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in the fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. women received their dead to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better salvation. Amen. So let's pray this morning. If you have a need, you just want to slip your hand up to the Lord. Say, "Lord, I just want time with you this morning." Amen. Gracious Father, we're so thankful we can let you change our lives. And Lord, I I'm standing in front of a room full of people, Lord, that have done that, Lord. And you've transformed them, Lord. You have taken us from glory to glory. the person we were, we aren't anymore because of your great grace, Lord. The power of your blood. And I pray, Father, this morning as we come before you, Lord, as a people. I pray you would anoint every soul, Lord. Touch every life, Father. Touch every spirit, dear God. All that we are, our bodies that are sick, Father, our spirits are sick, dear God. I pray you'd touch each one, Lord Jesus. Lord, may may there be another move of your spirit as we sung, dear God. A reawakening, a rekindling of a flame, Father. May you grant it. Anoint your word to um our lives. And may you have preeminence in our lives. And father, we also always want to remember those who couldn't be here today. Be there a great portion, Father. And Lord, I just want to commit our lives into your hands. Take control, Lord. We just want to step out of the way that you can have your way. Grant it, dear God. Meet every need, Lord. You see the need behind every hand that's raised. We commit them all to your to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, I want to talk about if I could have a bit of a title this morning. I want to talk about your faith. And if a subtitle I say put it put it in action. &gt;&gt; Faith is not a passive thing. It's not a stagnant thing. It's not a stillframe thing. Faith is alive. It moves. It grows. It quickens. As we read there in uh Hebrews chapter 11, you know, through faith they subdue kingdoms. They wrought righteousness, obtain promises, stop the mouths of lions. So faith is a very active thing. Amen. It's not stagnant. Amen. It moves. Amen. And I tell you what, where if you let the faith of God control your life, I mean, you're going to go into action. Amen. You're going to do things. You're not going to sit there stagnant and maybe wondering and hoping and praying that, you know, because I think a lot of times we pray for needs, but really it shouldn't just be, "Lord, help us." It should be, "Lord, show us how to put our faith into action. &gt;&gt; Guide us, Lord. Channel our faith. Show us how to approach every problem." Amen. Because faith is alive. Amen. You see these men, they would um Sorry, did I have it there? Um, you know, you see these men. This is uh it's been cut out, but this is the picture of uh you your the man being lowered into the presence of Jesus through the roof. Now, as I've said a while ago, I just want to just just bring it back home again, you know, but you know, the scripture says when Jesus saw their faith, it wasn't the man's faith that had anything to do with it. It was the faith of the four friends. And many times we we for some reason we look at the circumstances. We look at the state of someone. We look at what they're going through. We look at their attitude towards the Lord. And we kind of let that kind of dictate our faith being put into action. It's got nothing to do with the other person. &gt;&gt; Amen. That man's faith, it doesn't even say if he believed or not. It was the faith of the four friends. One brought him healing, but two brought him forgiveness of sins. Amen. So it was a powerful their faith was powerful. All they needed to do was get him to have a conference with God and God would do the rest. And I believe the same faith of those four friends, friends, is in you. Amen. That faith that brought the crippled man there is in you. Cuz many times we think of people, we think, "How on earth God could you ever touch them? They're not in a right frame of mind. They're not even in faith. They're in unbelief." And I tell you what, friends, what was before unbelief was faith. What was before sin? A savior. What was before sickness? A healer. Amen. What was before anyone being lost was a deliverer, was a savior, was a keeper, was a healer, was God. Amen. So before a spirit of unbelief ever came by, you know, out of Satan a perversion, right? There was faith. And faith is more powerful than unbelief. Amen. Faith drives unbelief away. Amen. Faith causes God's promises to be manifested. Faith subdues sin. Amen. Faith Faith has got muscles. Amen. It's not a weak thing. It's not some little pansy kind of a emo kind of a guy. No, faith is rugged. I mean, faith has got hair on its chest. It's got muscles. Amen. Faith is not afraid of nothing. I mean, it it it it doesn't be intimidated. Faith cannot be intimidated. Faith cannot pull back. I know faith goes forward. Amen. It's time, I believe, to take the word of God and go forward in faith. Amen. To take God at his word and not look at the trouble, not look at the circumstances. Amen. They did not see problems. They just saw a solution. Amen. The solution was unorthodox, but they got there. Amen. And I think it should be the same way with you and I. We should become very unorthodox in our approach &gt;&gt; because the devil knows how certain things should be and he always says well if it runs according to certain parameters then the outcome's going to happen. Example Goliath challenged uh Israel for a champion. &gt;&gt; He got a shepherd boy. God answered in an unorthodox way according to Goliath's idea of a fight. And Goliath had his shield was armor bearer guy. I think what a loser of a guy, you know, carrying a shield for a dead beat. Anyway, but then you know, Goliath had his spear. Then then then here comes a guy who's not armored like him, doesn't fight like him. His fighting stance is different. His approach to battle is different. It was completely unorthodox to what Goliath thought that a battle should happen, you know, a one-on-one combat cuz God works in an unorthodox way, but yet it's according to his word. Amen. So, so David came and and also as a slinger, he was very unorthodox because you think a slinger, he's got a missile weapon. He wants to have a distance between him and his opponent, especially a guy with a spear. But what does he do? He runs towards Goliath. &gt;&gt; It was completely unorthodox. You know, Goliath, no doubt, when he saw David, he's asking questions. How he saw him fight, he was asking questions. And then the last thing he died with was, "How on earth did this happen?" &gt;&gt; Why? Because David came in an unorthodox way, but yet according to the word. And the reason he stood according to the word, he said, "Because this guy's an uncircumcised Philistine, I've got a covenant with God. He's on my ground because that battle was in Judah, which was in David's inheritance." And so when the enemy came into David's ground, that enemy had to go, right? But you see, Saul and his army were fighting an orthodox way according to what Goliath was dictating. Why should we ever fight things according to what the devil puts upon us? I mean, we your family try and push and they, you know, fuss and there's fighting. Why should we respond in kind? Why should we agree? Why should we become like the atmosphere of unbelief? Why can we not live in an atmosphere of faith and push back a fussing, fighting, quarreling spirit? Why cannot we we do it in love? Amen. That's putting faith into action. Who's with me this morning? Amen. We don't ever want to just sit back in a corner and say, "Well, we're just some passive little little thing and we're just this helpless damsel in distress." I tell you what, friends, you're not a damsel in distress. Amen. No. Why? Cuz you got the King of Glory in you. Amen. He's come to take over your battle. Amen. You've got the full armor of God. You're not you're not there just just weakless. You you're not defenseless. You don't have any weapons. You've got the mightiest weapon. I mean, you got the best armor, the best equipment that any soldier could ever have is what you carry. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we need to put our and and I'm not saying you don't do this, but I think friends, if if there's a day to put faith into action, it's today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not let's not just sit back and you know even even the apostle Paul would say now I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. His life was dynamic. Amen. The faith that he had you know brought revelation healed people cast out devils. Amen. Established people in the faith caused people to receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. cause cause deliverance to take place. He was led by that faith. Amen. His life was not stagnant. It was not still frame. It wasn't just a plateau of a walk. No, he says, "Let's press to the mark of the high calling in Christ." I mean, let's apprehend that which has apprehended me. Amen. See, it was not a stagnant thing cuz faith is cannot stagnant. It cannot be still. It must grow. It must expand. Amen. And this word, this message to me, to me, you can see it's the word of God based on one thing. Denominations have gone down in depth of revelation. It's just become a social gospel and just casual and mind over matter kind of stuff. And you can tell that's why it's not the the word. But the word expands, it grows. It gets deeper. Amen. As the apostle Paul would say that you'd know the height and the depth and the breadth of the love of God. I mean, you know the full extent of the magnitude of his grace and his power. I mean, not just some plateau stagnant thing become a very deep, rich alive. I trust that's your experience today. I mean, where the word has got better, it's got richer, it's got greater. Why? Because faith grows. Amen. It doesn't sit still. It doesn't become No, it fully grows. And we live in a day where faith cannot plateau. Why? Cuz the Because the son of man has been revealed. Christ has been fully manifested in this day. So faith cannot plateau. Amen. You can never get to a point where you think you know it all. It's been all revealed to you. You can never get to that point. If you've got to that point, you realize one thing. You're at a dead end &gt;&gt; of a wrong destination. Amen. Cuz there's always more. There's always more to experience. There's always more to be real. Amen. You say, "Well, I've read the Bible." Read it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Read it again. Well, you say, "I've heard that message before." Listen to it again. You'll get something new. Amen. God, because in his season, God will minister certain parts of it that you didn't need in a previous season. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, faith does not does not stagnate. &gt;&gt; Amen. And faith is an individual affair. &gt;&gt; It's not a group thing. We're not we're not going to heaven because we're in a group or we come to Shikina Tabernacle or any other message church around the world. We don't go to heaven because we're part of the grouping. No, it's in it's an individual walk. It's you and God. I mean, God wants to walk with you. He wants to talk with you. He wants to reveal himself to you. He wants to know what's on your heart. He wants you to express yourself back to him, not as a group, as an individual. I mean, so faith is individual. So, it's not based on what anyone else is doing. These guys, these guys weren't interested in what the crowd was doing. They did not let their faith be dictated to by the mob. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's, you know, there, you know, we can't get in because of the press. They didn't say, "Well, I guess our faith has got to be according to the press of the people." No, their faith was according to we must get our friend to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so faith is an individual thing. That's why we can't stand on mommy's faith, daddy's faith, uncle's faith, brother's faith, pastor's faith. You can't stand by someone else's faith. It's your faith. What's being revealed to you, what is real to you. And I say we should be with a great depth of sincerity. Lord, make my faith alive. Amen. Don't let it be stagnant. Don't let it don't let my senses become numb where I'm so blinded by the things of the world that my faith has been become uh disabled because brother Ram says either the glamour of the world will paralyze your faith or your faith will paralyze the world. And I think we should give this world a big paralysis. Amen. It should be in a coma. Amen. Around us because our faith so paralyzes it. Amen. That what? That it's it doesn't paralyze our faith. &gt;&gt; It's a constant battle. But greater is you that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need Oh, the world's so bad and dark and scary. No. The light is so bright. Amen. Christ is so present. Amen. This word is so alive. We don't need to be afraid to go anywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter where he leads us. If he's leading us, it's okay because he's present. Amen. &gt;&gt; He won't lead you up a creek without a paddle. No, he will prove himself. You just keep walking with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith is an individual thing. The Apostle Paul was not worried about what the others were doing. He was walking by the revelation of the son of God. Amen. It's got to be the same thing with us. It's got to be an individual walk. Oh, but the church is doing this or not doing this. Who cares what the church is doing? Oh, my parents are doing this. Who cares about them? What are you doing? &gt;&gt; What is your faith doing? What are you doing with the word that's been given into your hand? Amen. You say, "Well, if brother so and so does it, I'll do it." Who cares about that person? Why are we waiting for others to step into the battlefront when God wants you to step into the battlefront? I mean, God wants you to pray and intercede and be a witness. He's not waiting for me. He's waiting for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In your walk, I'm talking about, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz the sons of God are led by the spirit of God. Amen. And he'll always lead us into a greater walk with him into the reality of his word. He will never lead us out of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So why, you know, we must not just sit back and wait for the crowd to do something. &gt;&gt; God wants you. &gt;&gt; He wants to inspire your life. Amen. When the Lord found me in Christ Church as a drunk university student, I just had such a faith everyone's going to believe this cuz I met him or he found me. Amen. I didn't wait for I didn't had to go ask someone about what to do. I had a burden. &gt;&gt; I had a burden. Everyone must know this Jesus. Let my Jesus change your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did I have a lot of wisdom? Probably not. But I knew he was alive. Amen. I knew God would direct my steps. Amen. But I didn't wait till I started to go to the message church there, Brother Greg. So I didn't say, "Brother Greg, what should I do now?" I had a burden. &gt;&gt; And that's the thing is if someone gets the Holy Ghost, they get a burden for souls. I mean, they get a care for the love, you know, for the church. They get a care for their friends and things. They don't they're not just passive or someone else. No, faith becomes active. Faith becomes alive and faith wants to make contact with someone else that they can meet the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we need a fire. Amen. We don't need a bit of bunch of useless New Zealand spirit floppy nonsense, you know, just floating along. Forget that thing. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm a Kiwi, so I can say it. And if you're not a Kiwi, say it anyway. We're not part of this country in that way. &gt;&gt; Oh, she'll be right. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Faith gives absolute power. &gt;&gt; Excuses are just excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. These guys had excuses why they could have just quit up and said it was too hard to get him there. &gt;&gt; If it was just a human intellectual faith, they would have given up. But their faith, real faith does not take no for an answer &gt;&gt; for an obstacle. It doesn't quit. Faith is prevailing. Faith makes you perseverant. Faith gives you a determination. Faith gives you such a grit that you won't quit. You can't. Amen. You may humanly you may say, "What's the point?" But there's something greater in you driving you. Who's ever had a burden where you humanly you don't want to do it, but there's something just it just grates at you. You've got to do it. Who's ever? Now, that's a burden. It's not a nice idea. It's a burden that you got to that something drives you to get you out of your comfort zone. You've got to do it. And &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we all here today? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is what faith does. Faith is not a &gt;&gt; Faith is rugged. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm a sister." You can have rugged faith. I mean, there's a lot of women in the Bibles were heroes of faith. When the men didn't do it, the sisters stood up and did the job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, you can take the same thing with Peter in the prison. And I don't have it here in my notes, but he was asleep. He was asleep. He was condemned to die the next morning. He fell asleep, but they had a prayer meeting &gt;&gt; and and you know that, you know, they had a prayer meeting because their faith said, "Lord, we're going to intercede for our brother." &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe he's still got a job to do, Lord. &gt;&gt; Peter was asleep. Who who took the angel into his prison? It wasn't Peter. &gt;&gt; It was the believers praying for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That same faith is in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't do that kind of thing. Yeah, you can because God is writing another book of Acts or a continuation of the book of Acts. And that book of Acts is being written here &gt;&gt; in the believers around the world, the book of Acts is being written. That's why we have testimony after testimony. It's a book of Acts. &gt;&gt; I mean, and even your everyday life overcoming for God, raising your children, providing and all those things, that's the book of Acts being written &gt;&gt; because we live a supernatural life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram said, "We look at the martyrs and we think, how on earth could we ever stand and be a martyr like they did in the dark ages?" But he said, "We fail to recognize the same faith that they had is the same faith we have and daily overcome in this world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Faith works. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, it's an individual thing. Moses's parents were not waiting for anyone else to decide to hide babies. They believe that the time had come that the prophecy of Abraham was going to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; They knew it was the season where a deliverer was going to come and they were going to be carried out of Egypt. They believed it was time. Did they wait for everyone else to start doing it? No. It became their faith. It was God dealing with individuals. Amen. Of um Amra and Jehooked, the family, right? And you know, Brother Brand would dramatize it in his sermon, lifting him up out of history. I tell you what, if you ever need a shot in the arm, go listen to that sermon. Lifting him up out of history. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are people who lift God out of history. He's not a God of the past. He's the great I am. He's the present God. Amen. And faith will lift him up out of history. And brother Braram said that God is anxiously waiting for someone to call him up out of history. May we be that people today. I mean, may we be that people today where we want a Lord. We don't want a God of the, you know, of the future even. Oh, it'll be better one day. No, today's the day. &gt;&gt; I mean, why not bring the promise today? Oh, one day when the conditions get right. No, faith is actually the only condition you need. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Amram perhaps one of the only ones of the nation which climbed up the little little stairst steps regardless of how tired he was. Each night he'd call on the God of Abraham, the one he had learned had come to Abraham and come to Job and come to Isaac and come to Jacob. in the hours of distress. And surely if he was God in their day, he would be God in that day. And if he was in Moses' day, he is God today. He just needs to be called up out of history. Called on the scene of action. &gt;&gt; Faith does it. God wants us as individuals to call him up out of history. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I've got to wait for the I've got to wait for a prayer meeting to be organized. You can be the prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got to wait for some outreach to be organized. You can be the outreach. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why not? Why not let God motivate your faith? &gt;&gt; Why not stand up and say, "Lord, I'm willing to be used. I'm willing, Lord, to be a vessel. However you want me to be a witness, Lord, however you want me to be part of the church, Lord, I'm willing to do it." &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at people who are reluctant to do anything. You guys are amazing volunteers. &gt;&gt; Okay? But why don't we let our faith go? Lord, take us higher. &gt;&gt; Take us out of our comfort zone, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the woman with the unjust, you know, Jesus told the story of the woman and the unjust judge. That woman badgered that judge &gt;&gt; until she got an answer. &gt;&gt; And and he's basically saying, "You be like her to me. You You start trying to bug me. Get on my hands. Let your faith go into action where you pray until you get an answer. Until a peace comes that you know God's answered your prayer. Just pray until." How long will it be? It could be 5 seconds. It could be however long. But we don't just want to sit there and just go through emotions. No, we should pray until we get an answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith Faith gets a hold of the hem of his garment. Amen. Faith actually stops Jesus in his tracks. Amen. Faith caused him to stand still and begin to address our situation. Amen. That's what faith does. Many times we think, "Oh, if we could just been back there where Jesus was in a body or back there in the prophet state." The same God is here today. Amen. The same one by faith you can touch. Amen. The same one here, you can put your faith into action and get a hold of. &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not fear the king's commandment. They weren't worried about what the enemy was going to do. Why? Because their faith was greater than their circumstances. The faith, their faith was greater than what the government had put in place that every Hebrew boy had to die. They weren't looking at that. &gt;&gt; They were looking at the promise. Cuz faith is a revelation. It's revealed to you. Amen. It's not something a nice idea. It's not some catchphrase or something that feels good. No, it's a revelation that anchors into your heart. Amen. So, what did they do? They took God at his word and they hid him. Amen. Praise the Lord. I just want to find this way because the law of faith is far greater is a power that's far greater than all the forces of hell. Amen. He says, he says, "Oh my, let it be uh uh let it be King Pharaoh, whoever it was when that little old housewoman raised up and looked at that child. She wasn't afraid of what the king said. This is the mother of Moses he's speaking about. That's the second power. We're going to talk on the power of the devil. Sure, he's got power to reign um and reign of death. But the second power was given was faith. And faith puts Satan to shame. Certainly it does. And that little housewife held that little baby in her arms. And she wasn't afraid of the king's commandment. She didn't care what the king said. She knowed God was able and God would keep his word. &gt;&gt; Faith declares that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Faith does not say, "I hope God's word will work." Faith knows he's able to keep his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if we could only accumulate that kind of a faith tonight would be kind of a faith living among us. Uh mainly moving in our beings, moving through the church. Not just the emotional faith, but a real solid faith that won't take no for an answer. Know that God said so and that settles it. He says, "I love it." Amen. So real faith that is settled in the hearts that's not based on emotion. Because faith is not emotion, but emotion brings faith, &gt;&gt; right? It's not it's not that kind of thing. No, it's something that settles in our heart that we know God is more than able to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it's a revelation to you, he has done it. &gt;&gt; You just walk into it, but it's yours. &gt;&gt; You possess it. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not, oh, hope it's going to work. No, you know it's already there. Abraham knew Isaac was coming &gt;&gt; when it became a revelation to him. He didn't have to hope. Maybe one day he knew Isaac was on his road. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the kind of faith we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see what happens is is the enemy wants to oppress us by wrong ideas. I'm just going to make a big segue then we're going to segue back. Okay. I just failed to put this in. I was in Well, this made sense to me at 12:30 last night. So, you know, I'm sure today it makes sense. Makes the same sense. So, Ecclesiastes 7:7, this is Yeah, I really like this verse. says surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyth the heart. Amen. So there's an oppression that can make so someone who's wise. Now I believe I'm looking at some of the wisest people in the world because we have the mind of Christ that makes you wise. Amen. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and and we have and we fear the Lord with a reverential love and trust, right? And a fear, godly fear. So we're actually wise people. Amen. Wisdom is not based on how many diplomas and degrees and doctorates you have. If you can have those things, those things are fine. But it doesn't make you wise. It's the wisdom of God makes you wise. Amen. But you see what happens is oppression can make someone who's wise mad because it becomes something that is is is is twisted in our minds and it can force us down. It can oppress us. You see, you know, they speak today a lot about I'm sorry, this is quite a segue, but they speak a lot about today about emotional intelligence. Who's heard about emotional intelligence? How emotionally intelligent are you as a person? Right? Now, emotional intelligence is actually spiritual intelligence because your emotions are your spirit, &gt;&gt; right? If you didn't have a human spirit, one, you'd be dead. Two, you wouldn't feel anything, &gt;&gt; right? Because but so we all have a spirit realm, a soul, a body, and a spirit. That's you. You're a triune being. &gt;&gt; Okay? So emotional intelligence is really spiritual intelligence. Now this is just from just from the web. It says from from helpgu.org. Emotional intelligence. What is an emotional intelligence? Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, emphasize uh emphas emphasize u empathize whatever that is. Feel sorry for people. Understand their feelings. I man I wish English was my second language. overcome challenges and diffuse conflict. So, someone who's emotionally intelligent can do those things or spiritually, I want to use the word spiritually intelligent, right? You're in tune with your spirit. You can you can and now this is me. This is sh uh uh definitely not Google. The believer should be able to evaluate their own emotions, feelings prayerfully, and take them to the Lord because we want to have our faith in the right place. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be segueed by things we shouldn't be bothered by. Okay. Now, if we have this wait, we go here. Isaiah says that he is, you know, he said that the Lord is our counselor. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, a counselor gives counsel, &gt;&gt; you know, and what we need to do is let the counselor counsel us. &gt;&gt; Not just remember with us and God, it's not one way communication where we just pour it all out and then we just walk on. He needs to counsel us back. Right. He needs to talk to us back. Okay. And yeah, I know. Well, duh. Yeah, I know. But, you know, he speaks to us, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; Right. So, in order in order because there's many things in life that that if we don't take it to the Lord, these things can can actually make us mad because someone who's mad, their spirit's been crushed. It doesn't operate like it should. Like, who's ever had a big bruise or broken arm or something? I say an oppression has come into your limb, right? Something's broke. it it can't operate like it should. &gt;&gt; Okay? And it's like our faith or like us as a person, if that oppression comes in, the enemy wants to take the truth, pervert it, and make it an oppression. Amen. So you take you know for example you know so um you take a teenager who's going through puberty massive rush of hormones sexual development and you know the centers of their brain the you know there's the check and balance part of their brain and and and and the risk takingaking part is fully mature but the check and balance part is still very infant. So they start doing crazy things. Hormones come into your body start being attracted to the opposite opposite sex and all these things. Now that's part of life. That's human feelings. That's natural. It's good. &gt;&gt; Okay. But then the devil can pervert that and say, "Oh, you like that person or you're attracted to that person. Oh, you're lusting. Therefore, you're committing adultery. Now you're condemned." Cuz he twists those things. Right? But you see now if you come back to the right balance and realize, no, this is part of being a human being. And God made you that way to be attracted to to your mate, &gt;&gt; right? And it's part of two becoming one. It's a good thing. Okay. So, if it's out of balance, it can become an oppression. But if it's a, you know, and then and then of course going through puberty and stuff, you realize what's happening to me. Yeah. Because I saw this skit and I don't have it here. I probably wouldn't play it here, but you know, there's this British comedy thing and there's like this kid. I mean, I mean, they're all adults playing it, but there's the kid, right? And they're like a happy normal like you they're just before puberty behaving, well, everything. And then suddenly it's like a buttons pushed. They become like a caveman and can only grunt and just start fussing and arguing and things. &gt;&gt; Right. It's part of human development. &gt;&gt; Right. We've all If you've been through puberty, you've been through that. &gt;&gt; Yep. Right. And brother says you just got to bear with them. That's &gt;&gt; right. Give them some understanding. Give them, you know, you were there, right? &gt;&gt; They're there. Don't be so hard. become their friend. &gt;&gt; Remember, you want to put faith into action, &gt;&gt; right? If you have wisdom, you can put faith into action, right? It's not just now I've got to put a straight jacket on them and keep them from everything. No, you've got to navigate with them through life because one day they're going to leave home and you're not going to be around. How are they going to be then? You know, it's we have to raise our children in such a way they become sensible, sane, Holy Ghost filled adults. We got to create an environment. Now, I probably I trust, you know, I trust we're here together, right? But, you know, we got to raise them in such a way that they can, sure, they'll make mistakes. They'll do crazy stuff, but there's got to be a home, a place that's safe they can come back to. And it should be mom and dad. &gt;&gt; Our host, our our relationship should be a sanctuary. should be a place like a citadel where they can run into when things are bad and they've done dumb stuff and they can, you know, the devil wants them to sit with it and say, "Well, you just gone and you're lost. You've gone too far." That's an oppression, right? And it's the same thing if you take a woman who's going through menopause or pre premenopause or however you say it. Everyone knows the, you know, because one day they're fine and then they get hot flashes up and down. Feelings go everywhere. And what's the first thing we think about? I'm under attack. A spirit's got me. I'm fighting this thing. And it can become a a loop of prayer and fasting when they're trying to pray away something that's just part of life, &gt;&gt; right? And so, but when you realize that, you can just relax. &gt;&gt; It's a season. God will take you through it, &gt;&gt; right? And you'll come out the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it easy? Well, it's it it's hard being a teenager. I did not enjoy being a teenager. I'm glad I'm an old guy now, &gt;&gt; right? But I didn't I didn't enjoy those years, especially from 18 to about 22 was terrible. &gt;&gt; But thank God I made it, &gt;&gt; you know, and it's like so because you don't know how you you just have no idea what you're up to, right? But God gets you through, &gt;&gt; right? And we got to have that in mind. They're going to get through this. &gt;&gt; Just like sisters going through menopause, you're going to get through it. It's okay. You may feel, man, man, I feel like I'm dying or what's wrong? Something's killing me. No, you're just going through a change of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll get through it. God will guide you through it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. But don't let it become a loop of you start to fight against something that you know, try and pray something away that's just part of life. You know, it's like a young person who's now realized they're attracted to someone, they want to start a relationship, all these things. And you know, you can't kill that part of you. You can't you can't cut that desire part off. We're all red-blooded. &gt;&gt; God built you a certain way. He wants you to be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't let it become an oppression. We don't need to be stressed, worked up, or worried about these things. It's just us going through a natural change of life. Amen. Now, here's a scary picture. Equations. I liked math. I wasn't very good at it, but I liked it. We expect now, now there's an answer we want, right? 1 + 1 equals 2. 1 + 50 million does not equal two. Okay? So, if we want the right answer, we need the right numbers to get the right answer or the right conditions to get the right answer. Okay? So now if we look at the whole fact this so see you know if you take social media use for example they say it's a way to feel connected and to build meaningful relationships but the studies have come in the the numbers are in guys &gt;&gt; the numbers are in guys it makes people more depressed detached and alienated from society it does not bring people together it disconnects people but now if you but but but if the answer to the equation is I want to be connected and feel like I'm part. See, this is why people people get into addiction is because I feel disconnected. &gt;&gt; And this is drugs, pornography, any any addiction in the world is because of a lack of connection with their peers and their family. It really does boil down to such simple things. &gt;&gt; So the thing is if your answer like that C squed in the middle for example, if that was meant to be I want to be connected and have meaningful relationships, but then I just but then I have the A squ is just I'm just going to be alienated in my room on social media more. you're not going to get to be connected. You see, it's actually you're doing the opposite of what you actually want. Okay? Now, faith can look beyond those things. See, we got to put our faith into action in everyday life. You know, we got to think now, why am I why am I why are my kids alienating themselves? Why are they wanting to hide away in a different kind of a world? Faith can bring them back. &gt;&gt; You got to let faith come into action and bring them out of that thing. And that doesn't mean I'm going to put you in a solitary confinement room, padded cell. That's not that's not faith. That's just fear and control. &gt;&gt; Amen. But faith will give you the tools to actually get because remember they're going through things. They're not really coping in life. The and we all even adults, we have periods where we don't really cope. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's okay. We have times like that. We feel overwhelmed. David, King David said, "When my heart's overwhelmed, Lord, lead me to the rock that's higher than I." Amen. Lead me to the revelation that's greater than my my my emotions, my mental state. &gt;&gt; Amen. Show me who I am in your word again, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That brings stability and peace. So, so people become more disconnected and things because of these things, but they're trying to become more connected. You got to change your your uh variables in your equation to get the right answer. I mean, it's the same thing with a with a wife, with a woman who will test love by constantly pushing their spouse away. They're actually testing to see if he loves her or not. But how do they do it? By pushing them away. But what's the answer really to that equation? Will be a distance in a relationship. Though though the fact is is they actually want to be connected. They want to know their spouse better. But what they do? They push them away. They're testing love. That ain't going to help. This is how women are built. I've heard because I'm not one. And then what the men do? So they get this test by being pushed back whether they hold themselves up in a cage in a cave. They become a caveman, a man in the wilderness getting away. I've just got to go pray. I've just got to spend some time with the Lord. Faith will bring your family into that worship. &gt;&gt; Faith will bring the family together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see the whole the the answer is meant to be being connected and a proof of love. But it's by pushing away. You'll never get what you want that way. You got to do the opposite. Remember Einstein said, "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results." Faith will change our method. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to look beyond the current circumstances. Faith does that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is a long range vision. Now, we can all relax. I'm going to go back to these things again. Okay? Faith has long range vision. It doesn't lower its sights. It holds to the target. Amen. Any good shooter knows that. See? See, it's long range. It's a telescope. It's a binocular. You don't look around here. You don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is. See, you don't use that. But use binoculars to look a way off. And faith does that. Faith picks up God's binoculars both on both sides, the Old and New Testament, and sees every promise that he made. Faith sees out yonder. And faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here, he looks to the end. He don't drop his sights down and look this way. He looks out yonder. He keeps the cross here dead center on the word. That's what faith does. That's the faith that is in man that does those things. &gt;&gt; So you see all these circumstances around you. Faith doesn't look at that. Faith looks at the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thine and thy house shall be saved. Amen. I'll put my word in thy mouth of thy seed and thy seed seed henceforth forever. Amen. This is this is the promise. Amen. The promise is we'll be one. Amen. Husband and wife will be one. Body, soul, and spirit will be one. Faith looks at that promise. Faith doesn't look at circumstances. Faith looks beyond &gt;&gt; those things. And I believe I'm looking at people of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who won't who who don't react based on how they're being treated because love is not divine love is not conditional. I mean, divine love is not based on how you're treated. It loves anyway. &gt;&gt; I mean, and divine love is the only thing that will conquer because it conquers all. &gt;&gt; Arguments don't. fussing doesn't. Amen. Well, I want to win an argument. I want to do this. I tell you, oppression, a gift of arguing can just can can just destroy the heart. And because that second part of that verse is, you know, sure um and a gift destroyth the heart. Who knows someone who can argue really well? They should be a criminal lawyer or a politician. Someone can misuse that gift and destroy someone. Not only destroy that person, but destroy themselves. because they will begin to think, man, they can just talk their way out of anything. There there's always things come in life. You know, you isn't it interesting? We think we can always do a certain thing and it'll always work. God will cause conditions to come in where you're talking or what you think you can do to get out of it won't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was a great military commander. He found himself on the back side of desert with a hightempered wife. &gt;&gt; God knew how to work, man. because he you know because being a being like a god in Egypt you think I can just talk my way in everyone just have complete obedience then he finds himself shepherd backside of the desert no palace no servants no nothing no army to command and he can't even his words don't work against this woman knows how to bring us to place we realize what we think we can do doesn't work &gt;&gt; amen you see a you know a gift of arguing to win an arg argument can destroy the heart of that person. We're not meant to break people down. We're not called to break our spouses or break We don't We're not building soldiers in the modern way because it says, you know, they say when they train a soldier, you got to break the civilian to make the soldier. We aren't here to do that. We we're under a different mandate. I mean, we're not building cannon fod here. We're building sons and daughters of God, powerhouses of the Holy Ghost. I mean, so God doesn't break our spirit and crush us. And we shouldn't do that to one another. No, we should build up one. They say, "Well, I could really win that argument." It's not about winning an argument. This isn't some talent show or some quiz game where you're trying to win points. &gt;&gt; I mean, cuz some people they can argue till the cows come home, but they they're empty inside because they've destroyed people. People they love the most. They've destroyed them. Why? Because they've they've actually used that gift to have a good argument to destroy. There's no wisdom in it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. Don't fuss. I like that. Amen. When the family gets in a fuss, don't fuss with them. Your mother said, "I ain't having you go up there that old church anymore. Well, you all think about it. You're letting your hair grow out. You look like some old grandma." Don't fuss with her. Say, "Okay, mother. It's all right. I love you just the same. I'll be praying for you as long as I live." See, now don't fuss. See, temper breeds temper. First thing you know, you grieve the Holy Spirit away from you. You'll be fussing back. Then the Holy Spirit takes its flight. Temper breeds temper. Love breeds love. Be full of love. Amen. Jesus said, "This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another." That's right. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what? 1 plus one equals two. Temper plus fussing equals hatred and division. &gt;&gt; Right? Oh, but I'm going to win. They're so dumb. &gt;&gt; I can prove my point. This is not a House of Representatives. This ain't Parliament, man. &gt;&gt; Your family should not be the government, the opposition, and the Greens. &gt;&gt; Okay? We're all on the same team. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever your party is. Well, we're the Jesus party. Okay? But you know what I mean, right? We Oh my. Faith creates. You know, you're a little creator. So, I'm just reading a bit here. You're a little creator yourself. You know that. I mean, certainly you've seen people you just love to be around. You don't know why. Just that loving type of person. Have you seen that? Just as kind. They like to be around them. See, they create an atmosphere. They live by that. They walk. They talk. It's their conversation. Because faith creates an atmosphere of love. You want to know you got revelation? What atmosphere is around you? I mean, because a human faith which is not revelation will produce a bitterness, a hatred, division, a strife, an envy, a superiority. That's human faith. That's emotional faith. Amen. But revelation faith produces the love of God. Brings a peace, a security, a calmness. People can come in the door, they can be tore up, fussing, fighting trouble, but they step into a different atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And that goes away, goes away, goes away. Why? Because there's a atmosphere of faith in the house. Amen. But you see, we've got to overcome, &gt;&gt; right? We do not win in a vacuum. I've never seen in my life a rugby team playing against another rugby team and the other rugby team is not on the field. &gt;&gt; There's always there's always two teams, &gt;&gt; right? You have to defeat. Doesn't matter how good you are, you've got to beat the other team. &gt;&gt; You've got to tackle them. You got to block them. You've got to get the ball past them. You have to actually put your skills, I say your faith into action to win the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't just sit there on the field and say, "Well, I'm going to win today." and you're sitting cross-legged on the halfway mark. But that's how some people operate in faith. Well, they think it's faith. I'm waiting for God to do something. God wants to use you. Amen. God does not make us overcomers by a flick of a switch. We have to surrender our human will over to his. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we got to realize because there's a promise in this day. To him that overcometh, &gt;&gt; you'll sit on his throne. Right? And so now to be an overcomer, we have to surrender our human will to his. &gt;&gt; Because remember, when the Lord fills us with the Holy Ghost, he fills our soul. He comes and dwells in our soul. He cleanses out our spirit, but it's the same human spirit, right? Our body is the same old body. We have to surrender our members to him that he can overcome. We got to surrender our members to him, our spirit to him that faith can rule. &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust this is all right just now. Amen. We've because remember we do not he does not change our spirit that it becomes a robot. We're not robots. Out of our own will we serve God. Amen. So now we've got to put our faith into action like a rugby team on the field. They've got to really put on the gear. Go win the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but I'm waiting for another team to win. But you're on the field. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for another halfback to make that kick. You're the halfback or the prop. You know, you're in that position and it's not someone else. If someone you're on the field whether you like oh someone else will do it for me. God wants you to overcome. He wants your faith to be put into action but you've got to be willing for it to go into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a re faith is a revelation. Now God as I said in the beginning he deals with us as individuals. Right? He's not waiting for anyone else. Now everyone in the scripture that comes to the Lord that's not really a group thing. It's individuals like this like the centurion came to him said Lord my servant is is is sick. He's going to die you know and Jesus says and I don't know if I have it there but he said I think in the previous verse he says you know Jesus says well I'll come I'll come heal him. But the centurion says I'm not worthy you even come under my roof but speak the word only and my and my servant will live. Now this centurion had great faith. Jesus marveled saying I have never found faith like this in Israel. Amen. The people who should have this kind of faith don't have it. It's a it's a pagan centurion. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's a gentile has this kind of a faith. And this is gentile faith. Amen. Gentile faith believes that when God speaks his word, it's exactly the same as him physically coming laying hands on a person and touching them and making them well. Amen. Because God and his word are the same thing. This is third pull faith. Amen. This centurion had faith in the spoken word of God and he believed it had power. He believed it was present. He believed it could work. Amen. Hey, that's why he said just speak the word, Lord Jesus. I tell you what, friends, the Lord has spoken his word. Amen. He has sent his word, amen, into this generation. This message is God's word come to the earth. Amen. And why he sent his word and healed them. Amen. And delivered them from their destructions. Amen. I believe, friends, that we have lived out this scripture. Amen. We're being delivered from our destructions. Amen. We are on our way to a sinner's grave. Amen. into a lost lost abyss of a hell. Amen. But God rich in mercy sent his word your way. Amen. Someone was praying. Amen. For you. Amen. That you would come to the knowledge of Christ. Amen. That the faith of God would come into your life and change you. Amen. It's like in Hallelujah. Back in 2007 when I met the Lord, there was Sister Vanessa here in Wellington. Never met her in my life. Was praying. Brother Caben was praying, "Lord, raise up a pastor in this place." &gt;&gt; Amen. Christine had a revelation. Maybe my husband's not even saved yet. &gt;&gt; Faith works. &gt;&gt; I'm a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. That faith works. Amen. I was doing my own thing, walking around my own life, but faith got a hold of me. Amen. Someone's prayers were touched heaven, came down upon the earth, and God be to speak. God be to move and I realized, Lord, I need you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was their faith. Amen. I'll tell you what, people on the other side of the country were taking ceiling tiles off of my life. I mean, to get me into the presence of Jesus Christ. Did they know me? They didn't need to know me. Amen. God knew me. That was the main thing. And God was inspiring their faith to pray. Amen. And I'm a testimony of answered prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And time would fail us to speak of everyone else that God has moved on. But what happened? They stood out in faith. They didn't wait for someone else to pray. No, I'm going to pray. I know God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I can go before his throne of grace anytime I want. No, God's put it on my heart to pray. I'm going to let God pray through me this prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he sent his word and healed. I tell you what, friends, the Lord is present. Amen. We don't have to wait till some special meeting. I'm looking forward to camp. I tell you, God is present. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you know if this if this centurion had that kind of a faith where Lord send your word and your word is the same as you coming that is gentile faith in the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if only we were there 2,000 years ago. The same Jesus, &gt;&gt; the same king of glory, just not in his physical body, but the same God is present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To meet our need. Hallelujah. Amen. And the Sarapheneician woman wasn't waiting for anyone else to go to the Lord. She wasn't even waiting for her daughter to get to a nice kind of condition and take her with because faith doesn't look at the condition of the person in need. &gt;&gt; Faith declares the answers here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And her faith has a had a lot of obstacles, had a lot of trouble because remember she went to the Lord and and and and he said to his disciples, I'm not even sent to the house of Israel. I mean to them. I'm not even sent to the Gentiles. I've only been sent to the lost sheep of Israel. The Lord himself was trying to discover discourage her humanly. But he knew her faith. &gt;&gt; Cuz faith goes beyond excuses. Oh, my past and my problems and my pride and my shame and you don't know what I've been through. Well, Jesus went to hell for you. He hung on Calvary to take your sins away. Amen. He was despised and rejected of men. He died of a broken heart. Amen. He knows he was acquainted with grief. If you're acquainted with something, you know it really well. Amen. He He went through the worst things a man could ever go through. So what excuse do we have? &gt;&gt; None is the answer if you're wondering. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she had an afflicted daughter tormented by an evil spirit. She wasn't looking at the state of her daughter to say, "Well, now's the time." No, she got to the master. And as I said, he tried to discourage her. You know the bread is not even you know you know the children's bread not even sent to the dogs and all these things called her a dog you got read the scripture but her faith looked beyond those things &gt;&gt; he knew her faith &gt;&gt; he said truth Lord but even the even the dogs get the crumbs under the table so she came cuz faith brings a humility faith does not get offended amen faith brings a real humility she said Lord I'll take anything I can get amen I know I just get crumb. Hallelujah. And because that crumb's part of the whole loaf, I get the whole loaf. Amen. A part of his word is all of his word. Amen. One promise is all of his promises. I put it that way because it's all connected. It's the same thing. It's not a disconnected thing. Amen. And what happened? He said, "Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt." &gt;&gt; She got her answer. &gt;&gt; Cuz faith does not know problems. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't know hindrances. You may be hindered, but your faith won't be hindered. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go, she had many hindrances, but her faith didn't have any. I mean, you might have a lot of hindrances. Who looks at hindrances? We need to look beyond a hindrance. &gt;&gt; I'm tired. I can't do this. I'm busy. All these kind of No, let's look beyond those things. Faith goes through those things. I think faith is a bulldozer. &gt;&gt; It just plows through. Hallelujah. There's a big rock or a big log or a big excuse in the way. Plowed. You've got to let it plow through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person that starts out to meet Christ will find a lot of hindrances, but your faith don't have any. Faith don't have no hindrances. Faith has hairs on its chest, great big muscles. Reason rises up and says, you know, it's reasonable. Faith puts its muscles out, sticks out its big chest, says, "Shut up. Sit down." And reason jumps over in the corner and takes a stool. Amen. Faith has got muscles. He means what he says. That's what we need tonight. That's what the four square church needs. what that what the Pentecostal group needs. It's what the whole world needs. What I need, it's what you need. We ought to be ashamed to admit it. But we need a faith that will hold on to God's word. Say it's true. Meet the devil and say, "Thus sayith the Lord." And we got to cast down reasoning. Amen. Reasoning is not reasonable compared to faith. No. Faith declares a promise and we keep the promise. And we're not willing to back up with anything else. You say, "Well, I'm weak in faith. I don't have a lot." I tell you what, you just start taking God's word and start swinging it. Amen. You may just be able to cut a little bit with those weak faith muscles just to be justified. You've made a hole. Amen. Then then you get a bit more strength because the more you use something, you develop those muscles. When you take God at your take God at his word, you're developing faith. You're letting it grow. Those faith muscles get stronger. Then you swing again. You get sanctified. You've cut a bigger hole. It's bigger than the first dog. Why? Because you're getting stronger. Amen. Then you cut again. You cut through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I mean, you cut a real big hole. I mean, you step through that hole. Then you step into every divine promise. And every enemy that comes against you once you've gone through there, you just start cutting them down and cutting them down. Like Caleb said about the giants in the land, they're bred for us. They're going to be our daily food, our sustenance. It's going to make us strong. I mean, so when an enemy comes against you, sickness, depression, trouble, anxiety, spirits, whatever it is, you got to realize this thing is a is a target dummy to make me strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. This thing is to develop my faith muscles. It's not to It's not here to destroy me. I'm actually here to destroy it. Amen. That when I destroy it, I become stronger. I believe the Lord more and more stable. Amen. I'm not troubled no more as I used to be. I can take God at his word more. I've got greater confidence in him. Amen. Why? Because faith muscles have been developed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but you don't know where I've come from. Don't matter where you come from. It don't matter what you've done. &gt;&gt; I mean, faith realizes that everything is under the blood. Amen. Faith realizes he took our guilt, our shame, our pain, our past. Oh, but I should have known better. I willfully did it. Faith declares it's under the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith declares there's no condemnation that they're in Christ Jesus. Amen. Faith declares it. Amen. Faith declares you're as righteous as Jesus Christ is righteous. Oh, what right do you have to take the word? Faith declares you have the right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He would not have put a faith in your heart. Amen. Unless he wanted you to use it. He didn't give you something say, "Oh, look at this and isn't it neat?" No, he wants it to go into action in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to finish with a couple things, then we're going to maybe we'll jump to this. God heals him many ways. Praise the Lord. I'm glad he's not a one hit wonder. Actually, no. He is forget that. I'm glad he does things in different ways. I'll say it that way because he is a one hit wonder. Amen. Meet the Lord. Seal the day of your redemption. That's the one hit. Then you become a wonder. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now God heals in many ways. Now, this is faith in faith in action. Cuz sometimes if we just, you know, if we have such a narrow mind, God has to do a miracle and that's it. Or God has to do it this way and that's it. No, no. We got to let God use what he wants to use. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God heals in many ways. The doctor asked me not long ago, "What is your opinion of medicine, Brother Brandham?" I said, "Well, God is the only one that can heal, sir." I said, "The Bible don't lie, and the Bible said, "I'm the Lord that heals all all your diseases." And I said, "The Bible can't lie." I said, "God heals by medicine. God heals by love. God heals by understanding. God heals by care. God heals by prayer. God heals by miracles. The whole thing, God heals. That's all." So, you got something in your life or in your family. God wants to heal by care. That's your faith going into action. Oh, but I'm praying God's going to do something and you're his instrument in the in the situation. Oh, I pray God really work in my family. You're there. &gt;&gt; Let him live through you. Oh, this is too natural. No, things are more supernatural than you realize. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every hero of faith in the Bible realized, Lord, I'm here for the job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God could have stepped into Egypt himself and delivered Israel. He says, "Moses, I'm sending you." &gt;&gt; He could have pulled up Rahab and her family out of Jericho and dropped her out of Jericho before it was destroyed. He sent two spies in. &gt;&gt; He gave her a token. &gt;&gt; She had to put her faith into action. &gt;&gt; Right. Oh, but I'm waiting for God to do something. He's waiting on you most of the time. I'm talking about myself, too. God's waiting on us to step out and take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God heals by prayer. God heals by go, you know, by miracles. The whole thing is God. He heals by understanding. See, many times what happens is frustration is the result of we don't understand a way forward. Isn't it? People get, "Oh, why is why is my son this way? Why is my daughter this way? Why is the economics why why is this going on?" If you had wisdom, if God gave you wisdom about the situation, you wouldn't be frustrated, &gt;&gt; right? Because you can see now a way forward. You see the way of escape. But there's always frustration comes because we don't see the way out. Well, then what do you do? Lord, show me how I should be in this situation &gt;&gt; because your promises are true. Show me how you can use my faith that that promise comes to pass. Praise the Lord. All of all uh all there is to it. He is the healer. Uh we haven't got a medicine that can create and create a cell in your hand to heal. Create in your body to heal. We can uh move a tooth. We can cut out an appendix, take out a gallbladder. But who healed? God. No medicine will build tissue, only God. Life builds tissue. God is the only healer. And we're talking on that. &gt;&gt; But then now also he says he look the right mental attitude towards any divine promise will bring it to pass. Faith gives you the right mental attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've never seen someone who's got a revelation of a promise that's talking down. &gt;&gt; Remember unbelief or frustration will speak negative. That's why we must never confess negative. Amen. We must always confess positive and faith declares the promise. He doesn't declare the circumstance. Amen. It's like, you know, like like David wasn't declaring Goliath being Goliath. He just declared, "You going down, boy." &gt;&gt; I mean, cuz faith declared your head's mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what faith declares. It doesn't look at the circumstance. Don't be caught up in your You say, "But it's so real." Yeah, I know. But faith is more real cuz faith is eternal. Amen. These things are temporal. Amen. You got to realize when you're in a trial it can feel so real. When you step out the other side just becomes a memory. &gt;&gt; Well, was it real? No, it came and went. Eternal things are real. The word is the only real thing. All these things are temporal. I mean, there'll come a time where where even this country will, you know, if time would go on, this country how it is will not be how it is. It will be a memory. Who's ever gone back to their childhood home? &gt;&gt; Is it exactly the same as you left? because it was temporal. &gt;&gt; Oh, but my memory of it so real and so vivid. That's fine. But it's a temporal place, right? But the word is eternal. And so faith is the only real thing. &gt;&gt; Revelation is the only real thing because it's fixed. It's eternal. It doesn't it doesn't, you know, move with time. It's it's constant. &gt;&gt; That's why it's always important to have the right mental attitude towards towards any divine promise. Never think negative. Never let a doubt come into you. Blast that doubt out with the dumbbellar shotgun of the word. Amen. You destroy that thing. You watch it go to a million pieces. You blast that thing out. Never ever let that thing roost in you. &gt;&gt; Every divine promise is for you. Let's just say that. Every divine promise is mine. Every &gt;&gt; Amen. Every divine promise is mine. &gt;&gt; Every divine promise is &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need to repeat this anymore. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's for him. No, it's for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I'm going to wind this up real quick. Okay. Now, this is from the Amplified um Bible version. For if we in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision or uncircumcision means anything, but only faith activated and expressed and working through love. Faith workketh by love. It says in the King James, "But only faith activated and expressed and working through love." That's what works. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you got to let your faith be activated and expressed and worked through love. That's why you got to have a divine love. Never get a fussy negative attitude towards anybody. Love everybody. Have a right mental attitude. Amen. Because you'll see that that power will bring a resurrection. Brother Bram told the story of the little lady, you know, you know, the mother with the baby who died in Mexico that morning. They're having a meeting. You know, she she she took him to the doctor. The baby was pronounced dead. But faith began to move in that in that Catholic woman's heart. She had a revelation. If I can just get my baby to that man, that preacher man. Amen. God is going to bring the baby's life back. So that was in the morning. She was carrying that baby dead form all day under a blanket. She got into the meeting. She couldn't get a prayer card. But faith does not look at circumstances. It looks at the promise. Amen. So what did she do? She was pushing through all the ushers she could. Imagine imagine a little Mexican lady holding a baby trying to push men out of the way, causing a disturbance. She didn't care what what was the trouble she was causing in the church. Amen. She didn't see fa. When faith gets a hold, you begin to praise God. You're not conscious of what is happening around you. You're not worried about, oh, I'm going to upset this person. No, cuz faith has got a hold and you're worshiping God. Amen. And it's in that kind of an atmosphere, I mean, God can begin to work. So, there she was pushing users out of the way, causing a whole whole big ruckus there in the meeting. But she was determined. I must get my baby to that man. And then so finally, you know, there's a, you know, um, this is all going on. And then, and then Brother Bram actually said to Jack Moore, well, you go pray for the baby because she doesn't know who I am. And, you know, just to calm her down and all these things. But then, but then the prophet saw a vision of the baby coming back to life. What did that? It was her faith. &gt;&gt; Her faith brought that baby back to life. It wasn't the prophet's faith. Faith. It was her faith. Amen. So, what happened is she came forward. Now she's saying all the Catholic things, padre and all these things and rosaries and all these things being a Catholic but no but you know he said stand up don't do that you know and then what did he do he put he he he put his hand on the little fellow Amen and God showed a vision there and that mother's love had touched you in some way why faith is activated by love amen what the the the mother's love touched the Lord &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. And what it do? That baby let out a big squeal, started screaming at top of the voice. I mean, woman faded everything. That little baby was was restored back to life by Jehovah God who felt the love of that mother pressing for her baby. Certainly, it was. &gt;&gt; If God can do that through a Catholic lady, &gt;&gt; can he not do it through you and I? Can he not bring a resurrection? You say, "Well, my my family's dead in trespasses and sins." I tell you what, let your love touch the throne of God. I mean that divine love touch the throne of God and they may be far away in the world somewhere God will begin to work. I mean God will begin to call them. &gt;&gt; I say no it can't work. Yes it can. Amen. Yes it can. Amen. If a woman can bring her baby back to life by love touching the throne of God. How much more you and I with a revelation of faith that God is present. God is able. Amen. God is here to meet every need. Amen. Can we not Amen. touch the throne of God and God can do the impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith does the impossible. Amen. And that impossible doing faith is in you and I this morning. So I say friends, let's put our faith into action. Amen. Don't be afraid of nothing. Don't stand back. No. Faith presses the battle. Amen. We're not here to push back for the devil and say, "Well, we're just going to live this way and this is how it is." No. Push forward. Amen. Take God in his word and let God put a revelation in your heart and then let that revelation live out of your life and you'll see the impossible be done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We could, you know, we could think about, oh my Robin with that tumor in her throat. Impossible for it to disappear. But she surrendered her life to the Lord's hands. Lord, if I live or if I die, I'm in your hands. She got anointed with oil and prayed for her and God made that tumor disappear. &gt;&gt; Amen. What? God did the impossible. &gt;&gt; How many other things do we have? Impossible things that have happened in life. Why? Because faith has been put into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet this morning, shall we? Let's have the musicians this morning. But I encourage you this morning, friends, let God use your faith and put it into action, and you'll see the supernatural be done. Amen. You'll see impossible things happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? He's a miracle working God. He heals by many different ways. Amen. He There's no case too hard. You say, "Well, we just got to let let the natural things run its course." No, we don't. God interrupts nature. He made it. Amen. And you say, "Well, this healing is going to be this way. This has got to happen this way." No. Let God do it his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll see incredible things happen. I believe, oh, my friends, we can pull roofs off. We can take tiles away.
