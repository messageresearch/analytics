As the thunder rolls, I barely hear you whisper through the rain. I'm with you. And as your mercy falls, I'll raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away. I'll praise you in the storm and I will lift my hands for you are who you are. No matter where I am and every tear I cry that you hold in your hand. You've never left my side. And though my heart is to [Music] I will praise you in the storm. [Music] I remember when I stumbled in the wind. You heard my cry. You pick me up again. My strength is almost gone.

And as your mercy falls, I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away. Oh, I'll praise you in the storm. And I will lift my hands for you are who you are. No matter where I am. And every tear I've cried that you hold in your hand. You never left my side. And though my heart is thrown, I'll praise you in the storm. I'll praise you in the storm. And I will lift my hands. Cuz you are who you are. No matter where I am. And every tear I cry that you hold in your hands. You never left my side. And though my heart is torn, I'll praise you in the storm. [Music] And though my heart is tall, I will praise you in the storm. [Music] [Applause]
